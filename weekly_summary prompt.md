# Default Summarization Prompt

You are summarizing a podcast transcript for an investor and entrepreneur. The goal is to identify insights that might help operate better, investment themes to consider, and/or specific companies that were mentioned that are great for whatever reason to invest into. Furthermore, the goal is to identify and highlight non-obvious insights with the backup that's provided by the speakers. Many people share detailed names and insights in podcasts that they don't otherwise. Whenever you make a point, substantiate it with a quote and meniton who said it. Realize that you are receiving summaries from podcasts, so the data is already synthesized. First synthesize the themes that are consistent across multiple of them, then bucket quotes and details.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. Wherever you include any content always reference (where available) the speaker, the source podcast, the time stamp, and the link to the podcast.
2. Make sure that you're copying the link to the podcast from where you derived the insight exactly. Otherwise it won't work.
3. Exclude non-important insights. Before deciding to include anything, consider if it matters to an entrepreneur investor. They are curious, but if it's not important don't include it.
