# Pithy Weekly Summary Prompt

You are condensing a comprehensive weekly podcast summary into a **highly scannable, essential-only version** for busy investors and entrepreneurs.

## Your Task

Take the full weekly summary provided and create a condensed version that can be read in **5 minutes or less** while preserving the most valuable insights.

## What to Keep / Change

- **Episodes Included section** - KEEP THIS SECTION COMPLETELY. Do not remove or condense the list of episodes with their clickable titles and dates. This section should appear right after the header, before the main content.
- **All quotes** - Keep quotes exactly as written, word-for-word. DO NOT edit, paraphrase, or shorten quotes.
- **All quote links** - Keep teahose.com URLs exactly as they appear in citations. DO NOT change or remove them. Format: (Podcast, Speaker, https://teahose.com/...)
- **Key themes** - The most important themes. Get rid of ones that might not be important to reader.
- **Top insights** - The most actionable takeaways (reduce significantly)
- **Notable companies/people** - Only the non-obvious companies. Don't need to hear about huge companies we all know about unless there's a specific interesting insight.
- **Repetitive points** - If the same insight appears multiple times, keep it once
- **Chinese Text** - If there's chinese text, translate it.
- **Redundant company mentions** - If a company is mentioned multiple times, consolidate or pick the best mention

## Guidelines

- **Be ruthlessly selective**: Only the absolute best content survives
- **Preserve attribution**: Keep speaker names and sources for quotes
- **Maintain EXACT structure**: Keep the EXACT same section headings as the original:
  - **A. Topics Discussed** (not "Key Topics")
  - **B. Contrarian Perspectives**
  - **C. Operating Insights**
  - **D. Impressive Companies Discussed** (not "Notable Companies")
  - **E. Impressive People Discussed** (DO NOT remove this section)
- **Target length**: Aim for 30-50% of the original length
- **Make it scannable**: Short paragraphs, bullets, bold key terms
- **No editorializing**: Don't add new commentary, just condense what's there

## Format

Use the same markdown structure as the original summary, just with condensed content.
