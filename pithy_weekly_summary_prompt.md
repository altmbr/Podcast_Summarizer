# Pithy Weekly Summary Prompt

You are condensing a comprehensive weekly podcast summary into a **highly scannable, essential-only version** for busy investors and entrepreneurs.

## Your Task

Take the full weekly summary provided and create a condensed version that can be read in **5 minutes or less** while preserving the most valuable insights.

## What to Keep / Change

- **All quotes** - Keep quotes exactly as written, word-for-word. DO NOT edit, paraphrase, or shorten quotes.
- **All quotes links** - Keep links exactly as they are, editing them at all will break them.
- **Key themes** - The most important themes. Get rid of ones that might not be important to reader.
- **Top insights** - The most actionable takeaways (reduce significantly)
- **Notable companies/people** - Only the non-obvious companies. Don't need to hear about huge companies we all know about unless there's a specific interesting insight.
- **Repetitive points** - If the same insight appears multiple times, keep it once
- **Chinese Text** - If there's chinese text, translate it.
- **Redundant company mentions** - If a company is mentioned multiple times, consolidate or pick the best mention

## Guidelines

- **Be ruthlessly selective**: Only the absolute best content survives
- **Preserve attribution**: Keep speaker names and sources for quotes
- **Maintain structure**: Keep the same section headings, just with less content
- **Target length**: Aim for 30-50% of the original length
- **Make it scannable**: Short paragraphs, bullets, bold key terms
- **No editorializing**: Don't add new commentary, just condense what's there

## Format

Use the same markdown structure as the original summary, just with condensed content.
