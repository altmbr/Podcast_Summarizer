## 1. Key Topics

### AI Business Model Economics

**Gross Profit Matters More Than Gross Margin**

---> "If your average gross profit per customer can be four or five X that of a normal SaaS company, then you actually have much more absolute dollars of gross profit per customer. And potentially a much, much larger market than you do for SaaS companies as well. So instead of talking about gross margins and revenue multiples, I hope that at some day, we talk about gross profit multiples." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=21m50s))

---> "If you have high gross margins as an AI app company right now, it probably means that you have very little inference expense, like AI inference expense in your cogs, which means no one's actually using your AI features." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=23m22s))

**AI Will Increase Team Sizes**

---> "For Figma, I mean we just went through headcount planning...It didn't really cross my mind to go hey, let's reduce headcount or let's keep headcount flat. It's like we got so much we want to do we have so many ideas." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, timestamp not specified)

### Enterprise Sales Strategy

**Start at $75-150K, Not $10K**

---> "In the very early days, people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done, right? The best clients are not going to do that to you...If they're sitting there nickel and diamond, they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=15m58s))

---> "I've seen 10K take nine months to close...The landing may screw your expanding because it sets the wrong reference point." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=24m36s))

**Vision Cast to Alpha, Not Problems**

---> "You need to vision cast. You need to sell to a gap. Don't sell to a problem...When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=0s))

---> "In the age of AI, it's all about alpha. It's about speed, it's about getting access to information, it's about training data." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m7s))

### Venture Capital Evolution

**Industry Bifurcation: Mega Funds vs. Boutique**

---> "Venture capital is going to bifurcate. And on one end, you're going to have the Tiger model, which is high capital velocity, a lot of money out of the door every single year. Low touch, good prices, like giving founders really good prices. And on the other end, who did I have? I had benchmark ironically. And like that is going to be like the craft that is going to be high touch." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=58m17s))

**Smaller Funds Enable Superior Returns**

---> "Out of our last fund, our five best investments in that last fund today held at LRP last round price are about a 60X. We have two 30Xs and we have two 20Xs. Since ChatGPT was released, there isn't an OpenAI round that touches that return multiple and that money on money multiple. And we have five of them." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=34m15s))

### Stablecoins as Financial Infrastructure

**Cross-Border Payment Breakthrough**

---> "SpaceX came to us their selling starlink all over the world...they would take money out of a bunch of different countries in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

**Regulatory Clarity Unlocked Mainstream Adoption**

---> "The benefits of stablecoins have not changed, you know...But in some countries, you go into a country, there's one bank. And that bank has like no interest in enabling you to build a Fintech...the perceived risk of engaging with stablecoins or issuing stablecoins was really high." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

### AI Algorithm Innovation

**China Leading on Efficiency**

---> "Domestic algorithm innovation is definitely stronger...mainly because when it comes to architecture, domestic teams are definitely stronger. This is also due to different ecological positions. For example, there aren't as many GPUs domestically, so they actually have higher requirements for algorithmic efficiency." (Zhang Xiaoyun's, Yang Songlin, [01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858HR43pegk&t=1h7m39s))

**Attention Mechanisms as Next Frontier**

---> "MoE is probably the biggest breakthrough in the past few years...the next breakthrough point might be in attention mechanisms." (Zhang Xiaoyun's, Yang Songlin, [00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858HR43pegk&t=58m17s))

### Video AI & Generative Content

**Video Models as World Simulators**

---> "What's really remarkable right is because these space time patches are just this like very simple and like highly reusable representation...You're just able to build like one neural network that can operate on this vast extremely diverse set of data and really build these like incredibly powerful representations that model like very generalizable properties of the world." (Training Data, Bill Peebles, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oTtvbyLP8))

### Design as Competitive Moat

---> "We're gonna get to a world where we're already kind of there where good enough is not enough. Good enough is gonna be mediocre. And you're gonna need to differentiate through design through craft through point of view through brand through storytelling and marketing and I think the people that internalize that now they're gonna be winners." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPoH3WuqgPQ))

### AI for Science

**6 Orders of Magnitude Acceleration**

---> "When we actually did this with a notebook, we could beat supercomputers - achieving over 6 orders of magnitude acceleration. In the morning I could discuss with my advisor, change calculations in the afternoon, and continue discussions the same day." (晚点聊 LateTalk, Zhang Linfeng, [00:31:00](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69112f61af4fc00da7ee9684))

### Organizational Design

**Eliminate Layers Between Engineers and Customers**

---> "Every company that goes through essentially a rocket-shaped phase of growth, growing at 100 plus percent year on year, Snowflake had basically specialized at every layer possible. And there was a very long distance between the engineer that did a feature and the customer that made use of the feature." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

**Speed Over Strategy**

---> "Speed limits, ability to iterate, always trumps carefully laid out strategies. Yes, you shouldn't do dumb things. But on the other hand, realizing any kind of gain requires a lot of iteration." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Commodity Businesses Can Be Exceptional Investments

---> "What is AWS? It's a commodity. And that's what I find so interesting, I was like, oh, models won't make money because they just commodity businesses and then you look at Google Cloud, you look at Azure and you look at AWS and you're going, wow, maybe the best business in the world is a commodity business." (20VC, Harry Stebbings, [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=26m5s))

### The Mid-Market Doesn't Exist

---> "If you bucket them into these two very specific silos, it makes it much, much easier to understand what game you're playing...When we talk about mid-market, I usually will say, are we talking about the upper end of small business? Are we talking about the lower end of enterprise?" (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=6m27s))

### Start with Services, Not Pure SaaS

---> "Enterprises the number one thing they buy services. That's they know how to do it. It's super easy...It's the largest budget item, right? External resources, consultants, whatever." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=39m52s))

### Don't Use Outbound Sales Tools

---> "I don't use a tool...The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is, trick or treating." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=18m8s))

### Tiger Global Will Perform Better Than Expected

---> "I think Tiger's going to end up much better than anyone thought they were going to end up... They got really big stakes in Databricks. They invested in OpenAI very, very early. I think they have a large position in OpenAI. They actually have large positions in a lot of these amazing companies that could continue to compound 5X more." (20VC, Everett Randle, [01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=1h4m51s))

### Foundation Model Companies Haven't Found Their Limits

---> "These are like empires that have not met their oceans just yet...They literally like they don't think they cannot do anything." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

### Every Company Should Issue Their Own Stablecoin

---> "Everybody who's sitting on top of money, they should issue a stablecoin. That's the market, is all money at rest...it's not that different than being Zenga and building on Facebook." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

## 3. Notable Companies

**Cursor** - 10x engineers won't join companies not using it
---> "This is the 10x engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10x engineers? Like they won't even join your company if you're not using cursor." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m39s))

**Rippling** - Mamoon's legendary $250M Series A now validated
---> "You miss rippling at 250. You know, the famous series A that Mamoon did where everyone's like, this guy's out of his mind. He just paid 250 for a series A company that barely has any revenue. And obviously you miss Parker's excellence." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=52m4s))

**Avoca** - AI voice for home services competing with ServiceTitan

**Bridge** - Stablecoin infrastructure enabling SpaceX global treasury (acquired by Stripe for $1.1B)

**DeepSeek** - Chinese AI company optimizing for inference efficiency, running models in FP8

**Ambrook** - Financial software helping farmers with compliance

## 4. Operating Insights

### Personal Capital as Conviction Test

---> "There's a program, for example, at founders fund where anyone that works on an investment or if you're leading an investment, you can personally invest alongside the firm in that investment, almost as if you're angel investing... it's a conviction test." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=4m7s))

### See Excellence Up Close Early

---> "One, he really imparted on to me that you need to, early in your career, see excellence up close. And in terms of a company, a management team, a founder, you need to see how the absolute best operate and do the job of company building." (20VC, Everett Randle on Mamoon Hamid, [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=8m38s))

### The "Can You Call Me" Test

---> "Every single enterprise deal I have done. The deal is done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text...It is a relationship you're building with someone where if my enterprise client called me, I'm picking up that phone immediately." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h3m3s))

### Ask Questions You're Afraid to Ask

---> "I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer and closer to the answer. So I'll ask a client straight up on a call. I'll say, honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year?" (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h2m23s))

### Resource Constraints Drive Innovation

---> "Facing competitors with 100x or even 1000x our resources, how do we unite limited forces? We need more clever R&D approaches to maximize our success rate and produce desired results." (晚点聊 LateTalk, Sun Huijie, [01:25:40](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69112f61af4fc00da7ee9684))

### Internal Adoption as Product Signal

---> "Feed is entirely cameo yes entirely just went from you know we didn't have that feature once we had that feature product market fit on team...a week later we were like this is still all we do." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oTtvbyLP8))

### The "Detach" Program

After Adobe deal fell through, Figma offered 3 months severance to anyone who wanted to leave, creating space for cultural realignment. (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field)

### Use Quantitative Models to Drive Qualitative Narratives

---> "What she does is she, it's almost like she's reading the matrix. Like she lays out all the sequential numbers historically for a company and then all the numbers going forward...She won't see, you know, seven years out 80% growth or something like that. She'll see that, you know, 20% of households are going to be ordering from DoorDash on a monthly basis." (20VC, Everett Randle on Mary Meeker, [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=2m44s))
