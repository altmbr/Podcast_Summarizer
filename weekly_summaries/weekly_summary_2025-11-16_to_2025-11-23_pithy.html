<p><strong>A. Topics Discussed</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI Infrastructure and Compute Constraints</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Data center permitting and power availability are the primary bottlenecks, not algorithmic innovation.</p>
<p>-&gt; "In the US, I am honestly worried that many data center operators were stuck in permitting...data centers are the critical infrastructure for building the digital economy" (20VC, Andrew Ng, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/20VC/AI%20Fund%E2%80%99s%20GP%2C%20Andrew%20Ng_%20Biggest%20Bottlenecks%20in%20AI%20%26%20How%20LLMs%20Can%20Be%20Used%20as%20a%20Geopolitical%20Weapon_">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<p>-&gt; "you can even run computations where you're using multiple metro areas and a long distance high speed length to communicate between multiple metro areas" (Stanford AI Speaker Series, Jeff Dean, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/Stanford%20AI%20Speaker%20Series/Stanford%20AI%20Club_%20Jeff%20Dean%20on%20Important%20AI%20Trends">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI Agents Require Continuous Human Training</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Agents need daily oversight to maintain quality—not set-and-forget automation.</p>
<p>-&gt; "Our agents will ebb and flow oddly, depending on how much time the humans put in. It's the war time I put in with our agent. Wow, shocker, the better the output is" (SaaStr, Amelia Ibarra, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/SaaStr/6%20Months%20Later%2C%20How%20Our%20AI%20SDRs%20Actually%20Work%20as%20AI%20Runs%20GTM%20with%20SaaStr%27s%20CEO%20and%20Chief%20AI%20Officer">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<p>-&gt; "You go in Gmail. And like, all of a sudden there's like a scheduling and they can textually pop stuff and it helps you schedule on the fly with a bunch of AI. And you're like, yup, that's how you deploy it" (More or Less, Sam Altman, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/More%20or%20Less/Google%20Just%20Won%20AI%2C%20TikTok%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CSelf-Control%20Badges%E2%80%9D%2C%20ChatGPT%20Enters%20Group%20Chats">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>End-to-End Neural Networks Over Modular Systems</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The autonomous vehicle playbook: replace hand-coded modules with unified learned models.</p>
<p>-&gt; "the classical robotics approach at the time was to take a perception, planning, mapping, control...our pitch was that, okay, we think that the future of robotics is not going to be a system that's hand engineer to drive with a lot of infrastructure like high-definition maps" (Training Data, Alex Kendall, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/Training%20Data/How%20End-to-End%20Learning%20Created%20Autonomous%20Driving%202.0_%20Wayve%20CEO%20Alex%20Kendall">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<p>-&gt; "At this point, we are almost 10 million trajectories being collected in the wild...those trajectories are not just like, oh, pick up a cup. These long trajectories with like walking with navigation" (No Priors, Tony Zhao, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/No%20Priors/No%20Priors%20Ep.%20141%20_%20With%20Sunday%20Robotics%20Co-Founders%20Tony%20Zhao%20and%20Cheng%20Chi">Read Summary</a>)</p>

<li><strong>Stablecoins as Global Financial Infrastructure</strong></li>
</ol>

All over Africa, all over Central America, all over Asia...His user base is growing by 30 million users a quarter" (All In, Chamath Palihapitiya, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/All%20In/Epstein%20Files%20Fallout%2C%20Nvidia%20Risks%2C%20Burry%27s%20Bad%20Bet%2C%20Google%27s%20Breakthrough%2C%20Tether%27s%20Boom">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Product Design: Comprehension Over Friction Reduction</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Making software "easier" by removing clicks often makes it harder to understand.</p>
<p>-&gt; "It became an assumption that you should always be trying to remove friction when the challenge is really comprehension. If your software kind of stops me and asks me to make a decision, and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid" (Lenny's, Stewart Butterfield, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/Lenny%27s/Mental%20models%20for%20building%20products%20people%20love%20ft.%20Stewart%20Butterfield">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CEO as the Only Advocate for Speed</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone else in the organization has incentives to slow down. Speed dies without executive enforcement.</p>
<p>-&gt; "there's ultimately only one person in the organization. There's only one constituency for speed and it's you as the CEO...everyone else in the organization can sort of solve for all of their problems by just extending the timelines" (Long Strange Trip, Parker Conrad, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/Long%20Strange%20Trip%20w%20Brian%20Halligan/Parker%20Conrad%E2%80%99s%20Revenge%20Fantasy">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<p>Translation of Chinese quote: "We've become extremely flat...I've flattened it to the point where I can directly see their code and experimental results at the frontline level."</p>
<p>-&gt; "我们变平化了...我一直变平到最一线单之内，我可以看他们的代码，看他们的实验结果" (Zhang Xiaojun Business Interviews, Liu Xianming, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/%E5%BC%A0%E5%B0%8F%E7%8F%BAJ%C3%B9n%EF%BD%9C%E5%95%86%E4%B8%9A%E8%AE%BF%E8%B0%88%E5%BD%95%20%28Zhang%20Xiaojun%20Business%20Interviews%29/120.%20Xpeng%27s%20Newly%20Appointed%20Liu%20Xianming%27s%20First%20Interview_%20Language%20is%20Poison%2C%20Remove%20the%20L%2C%20Simplicity%20is%20Beauty%2C%20Leadership%20Change%2C%20Xpeng%27s%20AI%20Transformation">Read Summary</a>)</p>

<li><strong>Open-Weight AI as Geopolitical Soft Power</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>China's strategy to distribute open AI models globally creates lasting influence.</p>
<p>-&gt; "Open way models is a tremendous source of geopolitical influence...the country of origin of the model they end up using will be delivering some answer" (20VC, Andrew Ng, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/20VC/AI%20Fund%E2%80%99s%20GP%2C%20Andrew%20Ng_%20Biggest%20Bottlenecks%20in%20AI%20%26%20How%20LLMs%20Can%20Be%20Used%20as%20a%20Geopolitical%20Weapon_">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>B. Contrarian Perspectives</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI Alignment as Slavery Infrastructure</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>-&gt; "Most of AI is focused on alignment as steering... If you think that we're making our beings, you'd also call this slavery" (A16z Podcast, Emmett Shear, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/A16z%20Podcast/Emmett%20Shear%20on%20Building%20AI%20That%20Actually%20Cares_%20Beyond%20Control%20and%20Steering">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aligned AI Still Dangerous in Human Hands</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>-&gt; "The problem is you... okay great we can steer the super powerful AI and now the super powerful AI is... this incredibly powerful tool is in the hands of a human who is well meaning but has limited finite wisdom" (A16z Podcast, Emmett Shear, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/A16z%20Podcast/Emmett%20Shear%20on%20Building%20AI%20That%20Actually%20Cares_%20Beyond%20Control%20and%20Steering">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Success Teaches More Than Failure</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>-&gt; "there's a lot of, I think, talk about, you know, failure being sort of this positive thing that you've learned a lot from. And actually, I think you don't learn a whole lot from failure. And you learn a lot more from success" (Long Strange Trip, Parker Conrad, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/Long%20Strange%20Trip%20w%20Brian%20Halligan/Parker%20Conrad%E2%80%99s%20Revenge%20Fantasy">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Everyone Should Still Learn to Code</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>-&gt; "We saw some senior business leaders advise people to not learn to cope on the grounds that AI will automate it. We'll look back on that as some of the worst career advice ever given" (20VC, Andrew Ng, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/20VC/AI%20Fund%E2%80%99s%20GP%2C%20Andrew%20Ng_%20Biggest%20Bottlenecks%20in%20AI%20%26%20How%20LLMs%20Can%20Be%20Used%20as%20a%20Geopolitical%20Weapon_">Read Summary</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reducing Clicks Usually Wrong Goal</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>-&gt; "You could make any action in your app a single click or tap by just exposing every single possibility on one screen... And obviously that's terrible. So why do people think that a little bit of that is good?" (Lenny's, Stewart Butterfield, <a href="https://teahose.com/podcast/Lenny%27s/Mental%20models%20for%20building%20products%20people%20love%20ft.%20Stewart%20Butterfield">Read Summary</a>)</p>

<li><strong>Act Small as Long as Possible</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>-&gt; "I used to think that it I was like I want to become a big company so I have to act corporate.
