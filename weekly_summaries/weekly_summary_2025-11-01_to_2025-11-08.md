**1. Topics Discussed**

-> 1. **OpenAI's Business Model and Revenue Trajectory**
--> 1.a. The $1.4T spending commitment controversy is misleading
---> "The 1.4 trillion, it's super important to remember. This is over a period of five or six years. I estimate about half of that spending is going to be borne by the partners. So now we're talking 700 billion dollars in spending. Spread that over five or six years. In the out years, you're probably talking about 150 billion dollars of CapEx to open AI." (All In, Brad Gerstner)
---> "We will end the year on a 20 billion dollar forward run rate, which means December revenue will be 1.666 billion at least." (All In, Sam Altman via Chamath)
--> 1.b. OpenAI's consumer retention is exceptional
---> "The cohort curves are things of dreams, right? This is the retention rate, the engagement rate is people stay with the service longer...they are the verb at the moment. It's theirs to lose in consumer." (All In, Brad Gerstner)

-> 2. **AI Infrastructure as National Imperative**
--> 2.a. Private sector is funding unprecedented AI buildout
---> "It's a national imperative that we accelerate the build out of AI infrastructure across the country. The $4 trillion that Jensen Huang has estimated will be built out over the next five years is 10 times the size of the Manhattan project that was totally federally funded. And this is all being privately funded." (All In, Brad Gerstner)
---> "The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it's a power." (BG2, Satya Nadella)
--> 2.b. Government "backstop" is regulatory reform, not bailout
---> "There's not going to be a federal bailout for AI. Not going to happen. We have five major frontier model companies right now. And if one of them fails, hey, it's going to go out of business and the other ones are going to replace it." (All In, David Sacks)

-> 3. **China AI Competition and State Regulatory Fragmentation**
--> 3.a. 50 state regulatory frameworks create massive disadvantage
---> "We are right now running with one hand tied behind our back. We are going to have to deal with 50 different sets of legislation from state legislators who think they know what AI is. They don't." (All In, Chamath Palihapitiya)
---> "25% of the bills going through state legislatures are in four states. California, New York, Colorado, and Illinois. In other words, the biggest blue states...If they end up creating the regulations, I just think it's naive to think that the AI companies won't write their models to those regulations of the blue states." (All In, David Sacks)
--> 3.b. Chinese models already gaining adoption
---> "Cursor 2.0 launched this week. My team at 8090 use it. It's an incredible product. Guess what they did? They swapped out Anthropic for an open source Chinese model." (All In, Chamath Palihapitiya)

-> 4. **Enterprise AI Implementation Crisis**
--> 4.a. Internal enterprise teams are failing to deliver AI
---> "Engineering teams at these orgs are filled with people that themselves don't actually really believe in AI, don't use code gen tools, think it's all super over-hyped...But the consequence of that for the companies is that they can't build the product." (Lightcone, Jared)
---> "Apple, a company with infinite resources and infinite access to the smartest people in the world, cannot make a good calendar app. So if that's true for Apple, how could any normal company let alone an internal IT system, let alone like Deloitte or Ernst & Young...most of the time, the output of something like that is bad." (Lightcone, Speaker_00)
--> 4.b. Startups gaining unprecedented enterprise access
---> "The enterprises would certainly prefer to buy these solutions from established software companies...but they fundamentally can't build the products...Then as if you can actually build something that works, the enterprises will talk to you because they have no other options." (Lightcone, Jared)

-> 5. **Stablecoins as Global Financial Infrastructure**
--> 5.a. Cross-border payments already transformed
---> "The first use case was predominantly cross-border payments. And it was taking money...from Colombian pesos to US dollars, via stablecoins. And for a bunch of reasons, it was cheaper and faster." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams)
---> "SpaceX came to us their selling starlink all over the world...they would take money out of a bunch of different countries in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams)
--> 5.b. Stablecoins create open financial stack
---> "You open source your financial stack. And the companies who are building on top of this are behind today, but basically making a bet that the cumulative power of all the builders in the world is going to create a better application over in years." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams)
---> "Stablecoins are like Starlink for, you know, money...Once it's in zero gravity, it's super efficient to actually move the data around, move the money around, but the ground stations on the ground have to be built." (Cheeky Pint, Henry Stern)

-> 6. **Video AI as World Simulators**
--> 6.a. Scale creates emergent physics understanding
---> "What's really remarkable right is because these space time patches are just this like very simple and like highly reusable representation...You're just able to build like one neural network that can operate on this vast extremely diverse set of data and really build these like incredibly powerful representations that model like very generalizable properties of the world." (Training Data, Bill Peebles)
--> 6.b. Sora respects physics over user intent
---> "If let's say like the text input to SORL is a basketball star wants to like shoot a hoop...If he misses in the model, SORL will not just like magically guide the basketball to go into the hoop...it will actually defer to the laws of physics most of the time." (Training Data, Thomas Dimson)

-> 7. **Iterative AI Deployment Philosophy**
--> 7.a. Society co-evolution requires gradual release
---> "For opening across the board, it's really important that we kind of like iteratively deploy technology in a way where we're not just like dropping bombshells on the world when there's like some big research breakthrough. We want to co-evolve society with the technology." (Training Data, Thomas Dimson)

-> 8. **Consumption-Based Sales Model Transformation**
--> 8.a. Daily compounding requires different AE behavior
---> "I have a saying, I have a few sayings with my team and one of them is each of vegetables...in a SaaS world, you can go for 89 days not really doing anything from a sales standpoint on the 90th day of the quarter, you can go do the big elephant deal...that doesn't work in consumption. It compounds." (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)
--> 8.b. Customer Success should be eliminated
---> "I subscribe to the Frank Slootman thought of no CS. I don't believe in CS...In consumption, you can't choose that. You're on that account and you're going to be the one overseeing a lot of that program management." (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)

-> 9. **AI Job Displacement Timeline**
--> 9.a. Rapid displacement creating political crisis
---> "I think displacement in a lot of roles is going to happen very quickly and it's going to be very painful and a large political problem. Like I think we're going to have a big populist movement around this and all the displacement that's going to happen." (No Priors, Brendan Fudy)
--> 9.b. Young workers already experiencing unemployment
---> "I can tell you from the front lines, hiring young people and being at startups with young people in them and talking to them about their contemporaries as companies cut and they use AI to solve problems, they're saying hiring young people and training them is not as rewarding or efficient as training an AI to do the same task." (All In, Jason Calacanis)

-> 10. **Early Capability Discovery as Competitive Advantage**
--> 10.a. Finding capabilities before they're obvious
---> "He showed me GPT-3, which at the time was public, and I was, first of all, just incredibly surprised that no one was talking about GPT-3 and no one was using it in any way, shape or form...We took about 100 landlord tenant questions...and 86 out of 100 was yes [that attorneys would send AI answers without edits]." (No Priors, Winston Weinberg)

---

**2. Contrarian Perspectives**

-> 1. **The AI Bubble Narrative is Astroturfed**
---> "Three big tech billionaires who are on the left contributed over a billion dollars to these Duma think tanks...they have spun up hundreds of these astroturfed organizations that are spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars to spread these Duma narratives...Right now, the two biggest narratives that we're seeing on social media and in mainstream media are number one, the idea that there's a huge AI bubble right now...The other biggest narrative is that AI is on the verge of superintelligence and we're all going to get replaced. Also fake. In other words, AI is completely real and super powerful. These two things are contradictory." (All In, David Sacks)

-> 2. **Federal Preemption is Pro-Innovation for AI**
---> "Republicans have muscle memory around what happened during the Biden years...But now we have a completely different situation...Republicans are in power in Washington and the states are making a bunch of bad decisions with respect to AI...Let's get President Trump, not Gavin Newsom or J.B. Pritzker or Kathy Hochul or Jared Polis, the ability to write the rules." (All In, David Sacks)

-> 3. **Entrepreneurship Should Be Scientific, Not Random**
---> "Why it is that the entrepreneurial process was supposed to be random, improvisational, kind of idiosyncratic, almost emotional, gamey...We take hard earned money. We deploy it to do things that are damn near impossible...people treat it like, oh well, you know, it didn't work. There's 20 different things we tried. One of them worked. That I don't know, as an engineer by background as a scientist, I just thought that what we do, especially in healthcare, especially in climate, especially in agriculture, food security, you can't think of this as shots on goal." (No Priors, Noubar Afeyan)

-> 4. **Every Company Should Issue Their Own Stablecoin**
---> "Everybody who's sitting on top of money, they should issue a stablecoin. That's the market, is all money at rest...let's say you build a giant platform on top of a stablecoin. And then over time, that stablecoin changes the economic game...it's not that different than being Zenga and building on Facebook." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams)

-> 5. **Social AI is More Human Than Traditional Social Media**
---> "It's actually strangely more social than a lot of social networks, even though it's all AI generated content." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai)

-> 6. **The Instagram Algorithm Defense**
---> "We did it for a reason...what was happening on Instagram over time was because it was chronologically ordered...if they're posting 20 times a day, your friends not...you'd have 20 natural geo posts, and then one picture that you actually were they cared about, that you never really scrolled to." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai)

-> 7. **Authenticity Beats Professionalism in Enterprise Sales**
---> "What's funny is this is a good example of when you meet, especially young founders, often they try to like dress up. Like they'll just dress up in a suit and they like copy Microsoft's homepage or something. And they shouldn't do that. Like they should just try to be a little bit more authentic. Like it's actually fine to be a startup." (Lightcone, Speaker_00)

-> 8. **Consumption Pricing Eliminates Need for Discounting**
---> "In consumption, you get 100% value of what you consume. And so the discount, why are you giving a discount to begin with? Yeah, there's some economies of scale, so some economic unit economics are deserved, but it's typically a much smaller discount as a result." (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)

-> 9. **Cyber Attacks Will Be the New AI Arms Race**
---> "I think that later on it becomes so destabilizing that China just says we're going to do something preemptive like do a cyber attack on your data center. And the US might do that to China...Hey, if you try and use this to crush us, we will prevent that by doing a cyber attack on you." (No Priors, Dan Hendricks)

-> 10. **Tether Will Never Pay Yield Despite Competition**
---> "The areas where Tether is most successful, which is in trading, there is no need to pay yields back. And the network effects there are really material." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams)

**3. Impressive Companies Discussed**

-> 1. **OpenAI / Sora**
---> "We will end the year on a 20 billion dollar forward run rate, which means December revenue will be 1.666 billion at least." (All In, Sam Altman via Chamath)
---> "The cohort curves are things of dreams, right? This is the retention rate, the engagement rate is people stay with the service longer...they are the verb at the moment. It's theirs to lose in consumer." (All In, Brad Gerstner)
---> "Almost 100% of people who get past the invite code all that on the app end up creating on day one. When they come back, it's like 70% of the time they come back, they're creating." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai)

-> 2. **Harvey (RV)**
---> "We took about 100 landlord tenant questions...we gave it to three landlord tenant attorneys...86 out of 100 was yes [they would send answers without edits]...we met with the C suite of OpenAI a couple weeks after." (No Priors, Winston Weinberg)

-> 3. **Glean**
---> "At rubric, we grew fast. We had a lot of information across 300 different SaaS systems and nobody could find anything in the company...One of our largest customers, they have more than one billion documents inside their company." (No Priors, Arvind Jain)

-> 4. **SpaceX**
---> "SpaceX came to us their selling starlink all over the world...they would take money out of a bunch of different countries in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams)

-> 5. **Bridge (acquired by Stripe)**
---> "Water conditions under which we think we can be successful here...they need to be able to work with competitive endeavors and have us competitive to Stripe itself...it's way too early in market development to try and verticalize the stack." (Cheeky Pint, Henri Stern)

-> 6. **Tactile AI**
---> "Tactile that's building sort of like a high level, like a business decision engine for banks in particular...The banks themselves, like city bank and JP Morgan, have tried to build this kind of software themselves, and it's to in each case, it's taken years, three to five years and tens of millions of dollars to actually get this implemented, whereas Tactile was able to build a rest API that makes decisions in real time." (Lightcone, Jared)

-> 7. **Abridge**
---> "I was sitting at dinner last week and my son asked me, mommy, why aren't you working right now? I literally took my phone out and explained to him that Abridge is a new tool that lets mommy come home early and eat dinner with her family. I started to tear up and looked over at my husband who then said, mommy's going to be able to eat dinner with us every night now." (No Priors, Customer feedback via Shiv Rao)

-> 8. **Databricks**
---> "We owe a lot of dashboards, as you might imagine, as a data and AI company. My favorite is one that we call morning coffee...it looks at your consumption on a daily basis, your gainers, your losers, your any new use cases that were created." (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)

-> 9. **Flagship Pioneering**
---> "I started a company in 1987 when 24-year-old immigrants didn't start companies in this country...One of the things that interested me was why it is that the entrepreneurial process was supposed to be random, improvisational...I just thought that what we do, especially in healthcare, especially in climate, especially in agriculture, food security, you can't think of this as shots on goal." (No Priors, Noubar Afeyan)

---

**4. Operating Insights**

-> 1. **Test AI Capabilities Against Real Professionals Blind**
---> "We took about 100 landlord tenant questions...we gave it to three landlord tenant attorneys...86 out of 100 was yes [they would send answers without edits]...We called/emailed the general counsel of OpenAI. And we sent him these results. And his response basically was, oh, I had no idea the models were this good at legal." (No Priors, Winston Weinberg)

-> 2. **Build Exception Reporting as Diagnostic Waterfall**
---> "Is the rep making their number from a consumption? Yes, great. No, they're not making that over. Do they have pipeline? Yes. Okay, pipeline will usually lead to consumption over time...No pipeline. Do they have activity? Yes, well, usually activity will build to pipeline...No activity. How's their training and enablement?" (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)

-> 3. **Use Internal Adoption as Product Signal**
---> "Feed is entirely cameo yes entirely just went from you know we didn't have that feature once we had that feature product market fit on team...a week later we were like this is still all we do." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai)

-> 4. **Non-Obvious Product Decisions Create Defensibility**
---> "I was never actually that afraid of competitive pressure in that crazy product phase because I was like, we sort of had these all these non trivial decisions that are obvious in retrospect, but we're not obvious at the time that we're sort of building on top of each other." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai)

-> 5. **Mandate Proactive Customer Optimization**
---> "I'm always telling my team to go talk to their customers every 90 days and offer up optimization opportunities. How do you spend less with me?...if you go and you're proactive on that, then the next workload or use case comes my direction." (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)

-> 6. **Use AI to Reverse-Engineer Competitive Positioning**
---> "I tell my team, do you think your competition's not doing that? Why don't you say, I'm this person that a competitor competing against Databricks at this account? How should I compete? And then you have the playbook. So like, you know, there's a little bit of reverse engineering that happens there." (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)

-> 7. **Latest Feed as Product Feedback Mechanism**
---> "One of my favorite ways to get product feedback it is so diverse the type of stuff people are doing...the latest feed which is just like the fire host of everything." (Training Data, Thomas Dimson)

-> 8. **Know When NOT to Integrate After M&A**
---> "Companies are sort of standardization machines...the natural tendency is like, okay, great, you know, we're going to do things this driveway now. And there are some places where it's valuable to do things this driveway...but it's an incredible art to, okay, these are things that we're going to standardize. These are things where, yeah, you know, you guys are going to stay doing it the startup way." (Cheeky Pint, Patrick Collison via Henri Stern)

-> 9. **Field Time is Irreplaceable Despite Data**
---> "There is no substitute to be perfectly clear for being in the field with your team though. You will see very quickly who's real and who's not...It's a tool to take you from good to great, not from mediocre to great...there's no substitute for it still to this day in my opinion." (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)

-> 10. **Create Rotating New Product Introduction Teams**
---> "I've seen companies that have a new product introduction specialist team. It's a confined thing that they build and then it has whatever the new product is to flavor the year. And then the next year, as the company innovates, it moves on to the next product because the team, the core team has learned how to pick up that new product that prior year." (Theory Ventures, Chris Klayko)
