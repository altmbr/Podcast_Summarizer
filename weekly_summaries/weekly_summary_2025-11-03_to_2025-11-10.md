## 1. Topics Discussed

### 1. AI Business Model Economics

#### 1.a. Gross Margin Percentages Are Misleading for AI Companies
---> "If your average gross profit per customer can be four or five X that of a normal SaaS company, then you actually have much more absolute dollars of gross profit per customer. And potentially a much, much larger market than you do for SaaS companies as well. So instead of talking about gross margins and revenue multiples, I hope that at some day, we talk about gross profit multiples." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=21m50s))

---> "If you have high gross margins as an AI app company right now, it probably means that you have very little inference expense, like AI inference expense in your cogs, which means no one's actually using your AI features." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=23m22s))

#### 1.b. AI Will Increase Team Sizes, Not Shrink Them
---> "I talked to these founders and they're proud of like how much they've accomplished with so few people...and they also say when I talk to them all the longer, I'm really trying to hire you got near referrals for me. Yeah, cuz like they are desperate for more people to go help with all the problems they now have at scale." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, timestamp not specified)

---> "For Figma, I mean we just went through headcount planning...It didn't really cross my mind to go hey, let's reduce headcount or let's keep headcount flat. It's like we got so much we want to do we have so many ideas." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, timestamp not specified)

### 2. Enterprise Sales Strategy

#### 2.a. Start with $75-150K Price Points, Not $10K
---> "In the very early days, people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done, right? The best clients are not going to do that to you...If they're sitting there nickel and diamond, they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=15m58s))

---> "I've seen 10K take nine months to close...The landing may screw your expanding because it sets the wrong reference point." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=24m36s))

#### 2.b. Vision Cast to Alpha, Not Problem-Solving
---> "You need to vision cast. You need to sell to a gap. Don't sell to a problem...When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=0s))

---> "In the age of AI, it's all about alpha. It's about speed, it's about getting access to information, it's about training data." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m7s))

### 3. Venture Capital Model Evolution

#### 3.a. The Industry is Bifurcating Between Mega Funds and Boutique Firms
---> "Venture capital is going to bifurcate. And on one end, you're going to have the Tiger model, which is high capital velocity, a lot of money out of the door every single year. Low touch, good prices, like giving founders really good prices. And on the other end, who did I have? I had benchmark ironically. And like that is going to be like the craft that is going to be high touch." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=58m17s))

#### 3.b. Smaller Fund Sizes Enable Superior Cash-on-Cash Returns
---> "Out of our last fund, our five best investments in that last fund today held at LRP last round price are about a 60X. We have two 30Xs and we have two 20Xs. Since ChatGPT was released, there isn't an OpenAI round that touches that return multiple and that money on money multiple. And we have five of them." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=34m15s))

### 4. Stablecoins as Global Financial Infrastructure

#### 4.a. Stablecoins Enable Cross-Border Payment Innovation
---> "The first use case was predominantly cross-border payments. And it was taking money...from Colombian pesos to US dollars, via stablecoins. And for a bunch of reasons, it was cheaper and faster." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

---> "SpaceX came to us their selling starlink all over the world...they would take money out of a bunch of different countries in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

#### 4.b. The Genius Act Unlocked Mainstream Business Adoption
---> "The benefits of stablecoins have not changed, you know...But in some countries, you go into a country, there's one bank. And that bank has like no interest in enabling you to build a Fintech...the perceived risk of engaging with stablecoins or issuing stablecoins was really high." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

### 5. AI Algorithm Innovation Dynamics

#### 5.a. China Leading on Efficiency Through Constraint
---> "我觉得国内算法创新肯定是更强的...主要是因他们是架构的话，那肯定是国内更强的。我觉得这也是有一些生态地位不同吧。就比方说国内没有那么多卡，然后他们其实对这个一批神奇的要求是更高的嘛" (Zhang Xiaoyun's, Yang Songlin, [01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858HR43pegk&t=1h7m39s))
[Translation: Domestic algorithm innovation is definitely stronger...mainly because when it comes to architecture, domestic teams are definitely stronger. This is also due to different ecological positions. For example, there aren't as many GPUs domestically, so they actually have higher requirements for algorithmic efficiency.]

#### 5.b. Attention Mechanisms as Next Frontier After MoE
---> "我觉得Moe它可能是近几年就是突破最大的一个在加个方面就是突破最大的一个方案嘛...然后下一个突破点可能就在个探讯嘛" (Zhang Xiaoyun's, Yang Songlin, [00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858HR43pegk&t=58m17s))
[Translation: MoE is probably the biggest breakthrough in the past few years...the next breakthrough point might be in attention mechanisms.]

### 6. Video AI and Generative Content

#### 6.a. Video Models as World Simulators
---> "What's really remarkable right is because these space time patches are just this like very simple and like highly reusable representation...You're just able to build like one neural network that can operate on this vast extremely diverse set of data and really build these like incredibly powerful representations that model like very generalizable properties of the world." (Training Data, Bill Peebles, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oTtvbyLP8))

#### 6.b. Optimizing for Creation Over Consumption
---> "The magic of this technology is that everybody is a creator. And so we want this feed to be optimized for you to create, to inspire you to create...almost 100% of people who get past the invite code all that on the app end up creating on day one." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oTtvbyLP8))

### 7. Design as Competitive Advantage

#### 7.a. Design Will Differentiate as AI Commoditizes "Good Enough"
---> "We're gonna get to a world where we're already kind of there where good enough is not enough. Good enough is gonna be mediocre. And you're gonna need to differentiate through design through craft through point of view through brand through storytelling and marketing and I think the people that internalize that now they're gonna be winners." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPoH3WuqgPQ))

### 8. AI for Science Revolution

#### 8.a. From First Principles to Machine Learning Acceleration
---> "When we actually did this with a notebook, we could beat supercomputers - achieving over 6 orders of magnitude acceleration. In the morning I could discuss with my advisor, change calculations in the afternoon, and continue discussions the same day." (晚点聊 LateTalk, Zhang Linfeng, [00:31:00](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69112f61af4fc00da7ee9684))

#### 8.b. Building the "Microscopic Dassault"
---> "In 2020, we proposed a 5-year plan to build a complete microscopic industrial R&D platform... Past industrial software utilized solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, electromagnetics well, but quantum mechanics - humanity's ultimate science dream - hadn't been well utilized." (晚点聊 LateTalk, Sun Huijie, [00:54:10](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69112f61af4fc00da7ee9684))

### 9. Organizational Design for Speed

#### 9.a. Eliminate Layers Between Engineers and Customers
---> "Every company that goes through essentially a rocket-shaped phase of growth, growing at 100 plus percent year on year, Snowflake had basically specialized at every layer possible. And there was a very long distance between the engineer that did a feature and the customer that made use of the feature." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

#### 9.b. Speed Over Strategy in Uncertain Environments
---> "Speed limits, ability to iterate, always trumps carefully laid out strategies. Yes, you shouldn't do dumb things. But on the other hand, realizing any kind of gain requires a lot of iteration." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

### 10. Silicon Valley Culture Shift

#### 10.a. From "Tech Bro" to Professional Etiquette
---> "The era of the young technologist with ripped jeans and a t-shirt that doesn't understand and disobeys all the rules of a local community. Because you're still important even though you're an asshole. I think it's just over. People are now scared of Silicon Valley. It's not some small side show." (More or Less, Sam Altman context, [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=0s))

---> "I think the story you need to show up now is like, I can bring a lot. I can give more than I get. I have the technology. You can trust me to back it up. But I also have respect for existing in your space." (More or Less, [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=1m7s))

---

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### 1. Commodity Businesses Can Be Exceptional Investments
---> "What is AWS? It's a commodity. And that's what I find so interesting, I was like, oh, models won't make money because they just commodity businesses and then you look at Google Cloud, you look at Azure and you look at AWS and you're going, wow, maybe the best business in the world is a commodity business." (20VC, Harry Stebbings, [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=26m5s))

---> "When they were when Coreweave was first raising in private markets, I was like, oh my god, this is the reselling a commodity. You know, there are middleman, there are broker of compute, it's going to be low margin yada yada yada. How wrong was I? You know, it's a I mean, maybe it's the markets down a little bit. But last time I checked, it was a $60 billion public company." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=26m41s))

### 2. The Mid-Market Doesn't Exist
---> "If you bucket them into these two very specific silos, it makes it much, much easier to understand what game you're playing...When we talk about mid-market, I usually will say, are we talking about the upper end of small business? Are we talking about the lower end of enterprise?" (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=6m27s))

---> "What is a mid-market hire? It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB. And if you bleed those two games, you're going to lose. They're so distinctly different." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=7m16s))

### 3. Start with Services, Not Pure SaaS
---> "Enterprises the number one thing they buy services. That's they know how to do it. It's super easy...It's the largest budget item, right? External resources, consultants, whatever." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=39m52s))

---> "The idea is that once you sell that service, once you get that foot in the door, then it's to guide them towards the product. Hey, you're spending so much here, why don't we move it?" (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=40m42s))

### 4. Don't Use Outbound Sales Tools - Go Manual
---> "I don't use a tool...The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is, trick or treating." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=18m8s))

### 5. Tiger Global Will Perform Better Than Expected
---> "I think Tiger's going to end up much better than anyone thought they were going to end up... They got really big stakes in Databricks. They invested in OpenAI very, very early. I think they have a large position in OpenAI. They actually have large positions in a lot of these amazing companies that could continue to compound 5X more." (20VC, Everett Randle, [01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=1h4m51s))

### 6. Foundation Model Companies Haven't Found Their Limits Yet
---> "These are like empires that have not met their oceans just yet...They literally like they don't think they cannot do anything." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

### 7. Social AI Is More Human Than Traditional Social Media
---> "It's actually strangely more social than a lot of social networks, even though it's all AI generated content...once we had that feature product market fit on team all everything we were generating was all of each other." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oTtvbyLP8))

### 8. Pure Linear Attention Cannot Handle Long Context
---> "像全线性的这个网络的话，他可能从理论上面他就没有辦法做那種長文本Task，因為他的那個阿恩的那個狀態數目是很定的，然後隨著那個Contest他那個長度增加的話，那他早晚會存不下。" (Zhang Xiaoyun's, Yang Songlin, [00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858HR43pegk&t=38m58s))
[Translation: Pure linear networks theoretically cannot handle long-text tasks because the hidden state size is fixed, and as context length increases, it will eventually run out of storage capacity.]

### 9. US Banking Fragmentation Is a Competitive Advantage
---> "The Fintech ecosystem, just overall, has been very concentrated globally. Like in the US, we don't appreciate how many banks there are. And how many of them are willing to support all these different crazy Fintech ideas...But in some countries, you go into a country, there's one bank. And that bank has like no interest in enabling you to build a Fintech." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

### 10. Every Company Should Issue Their Own Stablecoin
---> "Everybody who's sitting on top of money, they should issue a stablecoin. That's the market, is all money at rest...it's not that different than being Zenga and building on Facebook." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

---

## 3. Impressive Companies Discussed

### 1. Cursor (AI Coding Assistant)
---> "We're investors in cursor... I am not a believer in in some of the companies that have raised a ton of money and have not released a product or like haven't... you got to get developers hands on the product." (20VC, Everett Randle, [01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=1h18m11s))

---> "This is the 10x engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10x engineers? Like they won't even join your company if you're not using cursor." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m39s))

### 2. Rippling (HR/IT Platform)
---> "You miss rippling at 250. You know, the famous series A that Mamoon did where everyone's like, this guy's out of his mind. He just paid 250 for a series A company that barely has any revenue. And obviously you miss Parker's excellence." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=52m4s))

### 3. Avoca (AI Voice for Home Services)
---> "Lemlist led around in Avoca, is the company's name... How much do you spend on ServiceTitan? And at the time, it's like, oh my god, like $150 billion entry price, can we really make a good return on this investment?" (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=19m54s))

### 4. SpaceX (Using Stablecoins for Treasury)
---> "SpaceX came to us their selling starlink all over the world...And they need to repatriate all those funds to the US because they fund their business out of the US. And so they started using us to bring currencies back to the US...they would take money out of a bunch of different countries in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc))

### 5. DeepSeek (Chinese AI Company)
---> "Defc我觉得他们非常追求之中，比较说这个Tenants他们在Fp8上跑，这种之类的，我觉得他们Infer应该在他们算法迭代的过程中应该换一拳会比较高一点。" (Zhang Xiaoyun's, Yang Songlin, [01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858HR43pegk&t=1h41m41s))
[Translation: DeepSeek is very focused on implementation, for example running models in FP8 precision. I think inference optimization has a relatively high weight in their algorithm iteration process.]

### 6. Ambrook (Farmer Financial Software)
---> "Ambrook's amazing company trying to help farmers with their financial situation and like figure out how to make it so they can do taxes better and deal with all the compliance and forms they come along with it. And I think that they have a real opportunity in front of them." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPoH3WuqgPQ))

### 7. Until Labs (Cryogenics)
---> "Their moon shot goal [is whole body reversible cryogenics], but along the way there's a real problem to solve where organs, you might have an organ come available, but you have a very limited time window to get it to a recipient. And if you're able to basically use that same tech to be able to vitrify the organ and then rewarm it...then you have a longer period of time to go make that match and that can save a ton of lives." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPoH3WuqgPQ))

### 8. Figma (Design Platform)
---> "Close beta was launched summer 2015, GA October 2016, didn't start charging till summer 2017...And every time we [added features] we'd see just that retention would go up." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPoH3WuqgPQ))

### 9. Jelly (Authentic Social Media)
---> "What Ickram's working on has been for a while is this idea of effectively filter-less, authentic social media and the revival that's going to happen around that as the world gets disassociated from humans and polished. Jelly is the authentic real version... It's front cam, back cam, real conversations, real people not edited, you know, kind of record video on the fly." (More or Less, [00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=44m11s))

### 10. Bridge (Stablecoin Infrastructure - Acquired by Stripe for $1.1B)
---> Context: Bridge provides stablecoin payment rails for companies like SpaceX, enabling global treasury operations and cross-border payments at significantly lower costs than traditional methods.

---

## 4. Operating Insights

### 1. Personal Capital Commitment Tests True Conviction
---> "There's a program, for example, at founders fund where anyone that works on an investment or if you're leading an investment, you can personally invest alongside the firm in that investment, almost as if you're angel investing... it's a conviction test. Because if you're sponsoring some pro-rata of a company that's like doing okay but not great, but the founder really wants you to do pro-rata to not blow up the round, but you're not doing some of your portion of the individual side of that investment and your angel investment, Peter can go to you and say, do you not think this is better than having your money in the S&P?" (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=4m7s))

### 2. See Excellence Up Close Early in Career
---> "One, he really imparted on to me that you need to, early in your career, see excellence up close. And in terms of a company, a management team, a founder, you need to see how the absolute best operate and do the job of company building. Because if you don't see that, relatively early in your career, it's much, much harder to spot it in the wild. And you also don't know the bar to hold your other founders and your other management teams too." (20VC, Everett Randle on Mamoon Hamid, [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=8m38s))

### 3. The "Can You Call Me" Test for Relationship Quality
---> "Every single enterprise deal I have done. The deal is done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text...It is a relationship you're building with someone where if my enterprise client called me, I'm picking up that phone immediately." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h3m3s))

### 4. Ask Questions You're Afraid to Ask
---> "I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer and closer to the answer. So I'll ask a client straight up on a call. I'll say, honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year?" (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h2m23s))

### 5. Forced Innovation Through Resource Constraints
---> "Facing competitors with 100x or even 1000x our resources, how do we unite limited forces? We need more clever R&D approaches to maximize our success rate and produce desired results." (晚点聊 LateTalk, Sun Huijie, [01:25:40](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69112f61af4fc00da7ee9684))

### 6. Building Cross-Disciplinary Talent From Scratch
---> "We found no single major or education stage produced ready people. Those studying chemistry don't know algorithms, those knowing algorithms can't do software engineering. So we had to train people ourselves from sophomore/junior year." (晚点聊 LateTalk, Zhang Linfeng, [00:58:05](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69112f61af4fc00da7ee9684))

### 7. Use Internal Adoption as Product Signal
---> "Feed is entirely cameo yes entirely just went from you know we didn't have that feature once we had that feature product market fit on team...a week later we were like this is still all we do." (Training Data, Rohan Sahai, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oTtvbyLP8))

### 8. The "Detach" Program: Proactive Cultural Reset
---> After the Adobe deal fell through, Figma offered 3 months severance to anyone who wanted to leave, creating space for cultural realignment and ensuring remaining team members were truly committed. (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field, [timestamp not specified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPoH3WuqgPQ))

### 9. Use Quantitative Models to Drive Qualitative Narratives
---> "What she does is she, it's almost like she's reading the matrix. Like she lays out all the sequential numbers historically for a company and then all the numbers going forward. And it's almost like she's, you know, reading the matrix code as it comes down. And she's seeing what the company will become on an eight to 10 year time horizon when she sees what the numbers are... She won't see, you know, seven years out 80% growth or something like that. She'll see that, you know, 20% of households are going to be ordering from DoorDash on a monthly basis. And she can visualize that." (20VC, Everett Randle on Mary Meeker, [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=2m44s))
