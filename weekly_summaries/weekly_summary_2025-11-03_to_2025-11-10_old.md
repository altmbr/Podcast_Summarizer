## 1. Key Themes

### 1. AI Business Model Economics

**Gross margin percentages mislead in AI** - Focus on absolute gross profit per customer, not margins. High margins in AI apps often signal low AI usage.

---> "If your average gross profit per customer can be four or five X that of a normal SaaS company, then you actually have much more absolute dollars of gross profit per customer. And potentially a much, much larger market than you do for SaaS companies as well. So instead of talking about gross margins and revenue multiples, I hope that at some day, we talk about gross profit multiples." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=21m50s))

---> "If you have high gross margins as an AI app company right now, it probably means that you have very little inference expense, like AI inference expense in your cogs, which means no one's actually using your AI features." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=23m22s))

**AI increases team sizes** - Despite productivity gains, successful AI companies are aggressively hiring, not shrinking.

---> "For Figma, I mean we just went through headcount planning...It didn't really cross my mind to go hey, let's reduce headcount or let's keep headcount flat. It's like we got so much we want to do we have so many ideas." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field)

**Commodity businesses win** - AWS, Azure, CoreWeave prove commodity infrastructure can be exceptional. Models may follow this pattern.

---> "When they were when Coreweave was first raising in private markets, I was like, oh my god, this is the reselling a commodity. You know, there are middleman, there are broker of compute, it's going to be low margin yada yada yada. How wrong was I? You know, it's a I mean, maybe it's the markets down a little bit. But last time I checked, it was a $60 billion public company." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=26m41s))

### 2. Enterprise Sales Playbook ($1M-$10M)

**Start at $75-150K, not $10K** - Low entry prices set wrong reference points and take just as long to close.

---> "I've seen 10K take nine months to close...The landing may screw your expanding because it sets the wrong reference point." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=24m36s))

**Vision cast to alpha, not problem-solving** - Sell opportunity and competitive advantage, not pain relief.

---> "You need to vision cast. You need to sell to a gap. Don't sell to a problem...When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=0s))

---> "In the age of AI, it's all about alpha. It's about speed, it's about getting access to information, it's about training data." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m7s))

**The mid-market doesn't exist** - Every deal is either upper-end SMB or lower-end enterprise. Mixing these strategies kills execution.

---> "What is a mid-market hire? It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB. And if you bleed those two games, you're going to lose. They're so distinctly different." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=7m16s))

**Start with services** - Enterprises buy services first. Use this as entry, then migrate to product.

---> "Enterprises the number one thing they buy services. That's they know how to do it. It's super easy...It's the largest budget item, right? External resources, consultants, whatever." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=39m52s))

**Don't use outbound tools** - Everyone uses the same databases. Go manual to find uncontacted prospects.

---> "I don't use a tool...The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is, trick or treating." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=18m8s))

### 3. VC Model Evolution

**Industry bifurcating** - Mega funds (Tiger model) vs. boutique craft funds (Benchmark model). Middle ground disappearing.

---> "Venture capital is going to bifurcate. And on one end, you're going to have the Tiger model, which is high capital velocity, a lot of money out of the door every single year. Low touch, good prices, like giving founders really good prices. And on the other end, who did I have? I had benchmark ironically. And like that is going to be like the craft that is going to be high touch." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=58m17s))

**Small funds deliver superior multiples** - Benchmark has five 20X+ investments in latest fund—better returns than OpenAI for any single investor.

---> "Out of our last fund, our five best investments in that last fund today held at LRP last round price are about a 60X. We have two 30Xs and we have two 20Xs. Since ChatGPT was released, there isn't an OpenAI round that touches that return multiple and that money on money multiple. And we have five of them." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=34m15s))

**Tiger will outperform expectations** - Large early positions in Databricks, OpenAI will compound significantly.

---> "I think Tiger's going to end up much better than anyone thought they were going to end up... They got really big stakes in Databricks. They invested in OpenAI very, very early. I think they have a large position in OpenAI. They actually have large positions in a lot of these amazing companies that could continue to compound 5X more." (20VC, Everett Randle, [01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=1h4m51s))

### 4. Stablecoins as Infrastructure

**Cross-border payment breakthrough** - SpaceX repatriates funds from Africa/Latin America via stablecoins—cheaper and faster than traditional rails.

---> "SpaceX came to us their selling starlink all over the world...they would take money out of a bunch of different countries in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams)

**Genius Act unlocked adoption** - Regulatory clarity removed perceived risk, enabling mainstream business use.

---> "The benefits of stablecoins have not changed, you know...But in some countries, you go into a country, there's one bank. And that bank has like no interest in enabling you to build a Fintech...the perceived risk of engaging with stablecoins or issuing stablecoins was really high." (Cheeky Pint, Zach Abrams)

**Every company should issue stablecoins** - All firms sitting on money should tokenize it. Market opportunity is "all money at rest."

### 5. AI Algorithm Innovation

**China leads on efficiency** - Resource constraints drive superior algorithmic innovation and architectural breakthroughs.

---> "我觉得国内算法创新肯定是更强的...主要是因他们是架构的话，那肯定是国内更强的。我觉得这也是有一些生态地位不同吧。就比方说国内没有那么多卡，然后他们其实对这个一批神奇的要求是更高的嘛" (Zhang Xiaoyun's, Yang Songlin, [01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858HR43pegk&t=1h7m39s))
[Translation: Domestic algorithm innovation is definitely stronger...mainly because when it comes to architecture, domestic teams are definitely stronger. This is also due to different ecological positions. For example, there aren't as many GPUs domestically, so they actually have higher requirements for algorithmic efficiency.]

**Attention mechanisms next frontier** - After MoE's breakthrough, attention optimization is the next major leverage point.

**Pure linear attention fails at scale** - Theoretical limits prevent handling long context due to fixed hidden state size.

### 6. Design as Differentiation

**"Good enough" becomes mediocre** - As AI commoditizes baseline quality, design, craft, and brand become critical differentiators.

---> "We're gonna get to a world where we're already kind of there where good enough is not enough. Good enough is gonna be mediocre. And you're gonna need to differentiate through design through craft through point of view through brand through storytelling and marketing and I think the people that internalize that now they're gonna be winners." (Uncapped Founders, Dylan Field)

### 7. Speed Over Strategy

**Eliminate org layers** - Remove distance between engineers and customers to accelerate iteration.

---> "Every company that goes through essentially a rocket-shaped phase of growth, growing at 100 plus percent year on year, Snowflake had basically specialized at every layer possible. And there was a very long distance between the engineer that did a feature and the customer that made use of the feature." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

**Iteration trumps planning** - In uncertain environments, rapid experimentation beats careful strategy.

---> "Speed limits, ability to iterate, always trumps carefully laid out strategies. Yes, you shouldn't do dumb things. But on the other hand, realizing any kind of gain requires a lot of iteration." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

## 2. Companies to Watch

**Cursor** - The 10x engineer's IDE. Investors report developers won't join companies not using it.

---> "This is the 10x engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10x engineers? Like they won't even join your company if you're not using cursor." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m39s))

**Rippling** - Mamoon's famous $250M Series A valuation initially mocked, now validated. Unified HR/IT platform.

**Avoca** - AI voice for home services. Competes with $150B ServiceTitan by focusing on AI-first approach.

**Bridge** - Acquired by Stripe for $1.1B. Stablecoin infrastructure powering SpaceX treasury operations and cross-border payments.

**DeepSeek** - Chinese AI company prioritizing inference efficiency (FP8 precision) over raw scale.

**Ambrook** - Financial software for farmers. Solving compliance, taxes, and farm operations.

**Until Labs** - Cryogenics for organ preservation, enabling longer transplant windows. Moonshot: reversible human cryogenics.

**Jelly** - Authentic, unfiltered social media. Front/back camera, no editing, real-time video.

## 3. Tactical Takeaways

**Personal capital as conviction test** - Founders Fund requires team members to co-invest personally. Creates accountability for pro-rata decisions.

---> "There's a program, for example, at founders fund where anyone that works on an investment or if you're leading an investment, you can personally invest alongside the firm in that investment, almost as if you're angel investing... it's a conviction test." (20VC, Everett Randle, [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=4m7s))

**See excellence early** - Early-career exposure to exceptional operators sets your quality bar permanently.

---> "One, he really imparted on to me that you need to, early in your career, see excellence up close. And in terms of a company, a management team, a founder, you need to see how the absolute best operate and do the job of company building. Because if you don't see that, relatively early in your career, it's much, much harder to spot it in the wild." (20VC, Everett Randle on Mamoon Hamid, [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=8m38s))

**The "Can You Call Me" test** - Enterprise deals close via text when relationship quality is high. If they call instead of text, something's wrong.

---> "Every single enterprise deal I have done. The deal is done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text...It is a relationship you're building with someone where if my enterprise client called me, I'm picking up that phone immediately." (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h3m3s))

**Ask scary questions** - Directly ask if deal will close this year. Truth accelerates progress more than politeness.

---> "I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer and closer to the answer. So I'll ask a client straight up on a call. I'll say, honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year?" (Lenny's, Jen Abel, [01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h2m23s))

**Use internal adoption as signal** - If your team doesn't use your product daily post-launch, you don't have product-market fit.

**The "Detach" program** - After failed Adobe acquisition, Figma offered 3 months severance to anyone wanting to leave. Created cultural realignment and commitment test.

**Small-scale validation first** - Test architectural changes at 7B parameter scale before committing to expensive large-scale training.

**Stage organizational change** - Roll out in phases: leadership alignment first (quarters), then product/eng reorganization, then broader changes.

**Quantitative → qualitative** - Mary Meeker reads financial models like the Matrix, translating numbers into future customer behavior narratives.

## 4. Notable Quotes

**On Silicon Valley culture shift:**

---> "The era of the young technologist with ripped jeans and a t-shirt that doesn't understand and disobeys all the rules of a local community. Because you're still important even though you're an asshole. I think it's just over. People are now scared of Silicon Valley. It's not some small side show." (More or Less, [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=0s))

**On foundation model limits:**

---> "These are like empires that have not met their oceans just yet...They literally like they don't think they cannot do anything." (No Priors, Sridhar Ramaswamy, [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg))

**On video AI as world simulators:**

---> "What's really remarkable right is because these space time patches are just this like very simple and like highly reusable representation...You're just able to build like one neural network that can operate on this vast extremely diverse set of data and really build these like incredibly powerful representations that model like very generalizable properties of the world." (Training Data, Bill Peebles)

**On forced innovation:**

---> "Facing competitors with 100x or even 1000x our resources, how do we unite limited forces? We need more clever R&D approaches to maximize our success rate and produce desired results." (晚点聊 LateTalk, Sun Huijie, [01:25:40](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69112f61af4fc00da7ee9684))
