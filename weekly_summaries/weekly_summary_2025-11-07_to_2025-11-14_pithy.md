## A. KEY THEMES

### 1. The AI Infrastructure Question

**Is the spending justified?**

→ "This is over a period of five or six years. I estimate about half of that spending is going to be borne by the partners. So now we're talking 700 billion dollars in spending. Spread that over five or six years. In the out years, you're probably talking about 150 billion dollars of CapEx to open AI. So he's probably, you know, sitting there saying on any said, we're going to have over 100 billion of revenues." - Brad Gerstner, All In Podcast, [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uYEPfiBMAE&t=4m29s)

→ "Google's head of AI and infrastructure, speaking at a conference here recently...Are seven and eight year old TPUs have 100% utilization" - David Friedberg, All In Podcast, [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpg9eSAYr0A&t=8m3s)

**The scaling wall:**

→ "Right now there's a lot of manual work going into making these models better. In the true pre-training scaling era to the GPT-2, 3.5 maybe up to four, it felt like you can just put more data in there and just it just got better. Whereas now it feels like there's a lot of labeling work happening. There's a lot of contracting work happening." - Amjad Masad, A16z Podcast, [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191Ojd7Rq6s&t=7m16s)

### 2. Enterprise Sales Reinvented

**Start at the top, price high:**

→ "Early adopters are those logos, because they have to continue to stay at the number one spot. So they'll take tons of swings to continue to stay in the number one spot...those number one logos are like, if you can give me just a slight bit of alpha, just a tiny bit, that's where I get promoted." - Jen Abel, Lenny's Podcast, [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=22s)

→ "In the very early days, people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done, right? The best clients are not going to do that to you...If they're sitting there nickel and diamond, they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them." - Jen Abel, Lenny's Podcast, [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=15m58s)

**Sell vision, not problems:**

→ "You need to vision cast. You need to sell to a gap. Don't sell to a problem...When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity." - Jen Abel, Lenny's Podcast, [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=0s)

### 3. Post-Phone Computing

**AI rings and wearables:**

→ "the AI computing device on the edge that's using inference to interact with you is going to be the thing" - Sam Altman, More or Less Podcast, [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA20Sk63yYE&t=8m28s)

**Voice is a trap:**

→ "There's a huge mind trap that exists among builders in the space where they somehow think that voice is the main interface...You can't use that device if you're laying in bed with someone who's sleeping. You can't use it in a crowded space. You can't use it at the office" - Eugenia Kuyda, A16z Podcast, [00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KfrrWRl3FA&t=46m44s)

### 4. Housing: Supply, Not Subsidies

→ "LA CD council held a vote...they limited the amount that a landlord can increase the rent every year...That creates a disincentive for capital, for investors to buy new buildings or put money into upgrading buildings or put money into building new buildings" - David Friedberg, All In Podcast, [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpg9eSAYr0A&t=4m41s)

→ "Austin rent has gone down 20% in the last three years because we build units...If you make $130,000 a year, your rent is going to be 10%, 15% max of your income" - Jason Calacanis, All In Podcast, [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpg9eSAYr0A&t=30m15s)

### 5. Microsoft's Strategic Positioning

**Fleet flexibility over scale:**

→ "we didn't want to just be a host for one company and have just a massive book of business with one customer. That's not a business. You can't build an infrastructure that's optimized for one model. If you do that, you're one copy away. Some MOE like breakthrough that happens when your entire network topology goes out of the window, then that's a scary thing" - Satya Nadella, Dwarkesh Podcast, [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-boBsWcr5A&t=10s)

**Trust as competitive moat:**

→ "the United States is just an unbelievable place it's just unique in history right it's 4% of the world's population 25% of the GDP and 50% of the market cap and I think you should think about those ratios and really and reflect on it that 50% happens because quite frankly though trust the world has in the United States whether it's its capital markets or whether it's its technology" - Satya Nadella, Dwarkesh Podcast, [01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-boBsWcr5A&t=1h17m57s)

### 6. Fund Size Determines Returns

→ "Out of our last fund, our five best investments in that last fund today held at LRP last round price are about a 60X. We have two 30Xs and we have two 20Xs. Since ChatGPT was released, there isn't an OpenAI round that touches that return multiple and that money on money multiple. And we have five of them." - Everett Randle, 20VC Podcast, [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=34m15s)

→ "I don't think as Ravya Hamant or even Ben and Mark at this point, I don't think that they can go to LPs and say, hey, this basket of funds that we're making you invest party pursue across, we're going to get you five X net on that." - Everett Randle, 20VC Podcast, [01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=1h2m55s)

## B. CONTRARIAN TAKES

**Low margins = product-market fit:**

→ "If you have high gross margins as an AI app company right now, it probably means that you have very little inference expense, like AI inference expense in your cogs, which means no one's actually using your AI features." - Everett Randle, 20VC Podcast, [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=23m22s)

**Angel investing is suboptimal:**

→ "I view angel investing a little bit like playing roulette. I like to play poker. It has better odds. I look at private equity or buying businesses more like poker." - Andrew Wilkinson, My First Million, [00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=36m36s)

→ "When I first started out, I got in the habit of angel investing. I have $30 million or something tied up in angel investment completely illiquid. I have no access to it. I'd much rather own stocks and real estate or something." - Andrew Wilkinson, My First Million, [00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=37m47s)

**Government support drives prices UP:**

→ "Fannie and Freddie combined have issued or supported about $8 trillion of home loans...that capital is actually excess liquidity that can, in fact, drive prices up. And much like we've seen in many other markets, like education with student loans or like healthcare with Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, and so on, when the government gets involved and provides capital to quote support a market and make it more accessible, the prices skyrocket" - David Friedberg, All In Podcast, [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpg9eSAYr0A&t=7m36s)

**The entry-level job crisis:**

→ "One thing I worry about is the deleterious effect of LLMs in the economy and that say LLMs effectively automate the entry level job, but not the experts job... you have a lot of really good QA people now managing hundreds of agents and you effectively increase the productivity a lot, but they're not hiring new people because the agents are better than new people." - Amjad Masad, A16z Podcast, [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191Ojd7Rq6s&t=15m25s)

**Winner's curse for model companies:**

→ "if you're a model company, you may have a winner's curse, you may have done all the hard work, done unbelievable innovation, except it's kind of like one copy away from that being commoditized" - Satya Nadella, Dwarkesh Podcast, [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-boBsWcr5A&t=0s)

**M&A rarely advances the mission:**

→ "I think it is a fantasy to believe that you can sell your company...for the mission. And I think in theory, this can happen sometimes, but it is so, so rare...And I think more likely than not, you'd be disappointed with that outcome." - Kyle Vogt, Uncapped Founders Podcast, [00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQoFbvyWEy8&t=41m24s)

## C. NOTABLE COMPANIES

**Palantir**
→ "What they do is completely unique and completely differentiated. There is no alternative in the market for it. That's why they trade it such a huge premium to sales" - Chamath Palihapitiya, All In Podcast, [00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpg9eSAYr0A&t=16m42s)
- Trading at 137x sales vs. 13x for competitors; $480B on $3.5B run rate

**Flexport**
→ "Our take is that we can make the price of shipping anything by ocean container shipping between 8 and 10% cheaper over the next few years and AI is a big part of that." - Ryan Peterson, Lightcone Podcast, [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmxaMdUbHA&t=0s)
- Automated 50% of work in 2025, targeting 90-95%

**Cursor**
→ "cursor 2.0 launched this week. My team at 80 90 use it. It's an incredible product. Guess what they did? They swapped out and thropic for an open source Chinese model" - Chamath Palihapitiya, All In Podcast, [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uYEPfiBMAE&t=18m51s)

**Replit**
→ "Agent V1 could run for like two minutes, agent V2 ran for 20 minutes. Agent 3 we advertise it as running for 200 minutes. It just felt like it should be symmetrical, but like it's actually runs kind of indefinitely. Like we've had users running it for 20 plus hours." - Amjad Masad, A16z Podcast, [00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191Ojd7Rq6s&t=46m51s)
- Revenue: $2-3M to $150M; 70% create on return visits

**Serato**
→ "$45 million of revenue, $15 million of EBITDA. It's been growing like crazy, moving into a SaaS model from licensing." - Andrew Wilkinson, My First Million, [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=13m6s)
- Hardware integration creates moat against AI commoditization

## D. OPERATING INSIGHTS

**Match capital to revenue flexibility:**
→ "I think you have to build in an expense structure that has the flexibility. So if the numbers don't show up that you have the ability to extend your, you know, your obligation" - Brad Gerstner, All In Podcast, [00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uYEPfiBMAE&t=35m22s)

**Ask questions you're afraid to:**
→ "I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer and closer to the answer. So I'll ask a client straight up on a call. I'll say, honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year?" - Jen Abel, Lenny's Podcast, [01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h2m23s)

**Co-author pricing with clients:**
→ "I will say, listen, this is a $150,000 engagement. I will co-author it with you where we can make this a little bit bigger if you need something else. We can make it a little bit smaller in year one, but in year two it steps up. Like, how do we get this done? So when you go to bat, it's a win." - Jen Abel, Lenny's Podcast, [01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h5m15s)

**Verify-in-the-loop enables autonomy:**
→ "I remember reading deep seek a paper from Nvidia about how they used deep seek to write CUDA kernels. And they were able to run deep seek for like 20 minutes if they put a verify on the loop, like being able to run tests or something like that. And I thought, okay, so what kind of verify can we put on the loop?" - Amjad Masad, A16z Podcast, [00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191Ojd7Rq6s&t=47m2s)

**Reorganize for accountability:**
→ "Every company that goes through essentially a rocket-shaped phase of growth, growing at 100 plus percent year on year, Snowflake had basically specialized at every layer possible. And there was a very long distance between the engineer that did a feature and the customer that made use of the feature." - Sridhar Ramaswamy, No Priors, [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDMhKgpqkg&t=3m21s)
