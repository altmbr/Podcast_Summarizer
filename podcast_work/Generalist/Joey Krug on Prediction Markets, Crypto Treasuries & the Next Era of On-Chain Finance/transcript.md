[00:00:00] You dropped out of school and then built what was really this first crypto prediction market called auger.
[00:00:04] Mario: How did that idea come to you?
[00:00:06] Joey Krug: If you have markets where you can basically bet respectfully on anything,
[00:00:09] Joey Krug: that's the ultimate vision of capitalism.
[00:00:11] Joey Krug: And I was really drawn to this vision as well.
[00:00:13] Joey Krug: If you can have markets on any future state of the world,
[00:00:15] Joey Krug: you can then use that information for lots of other things.
[00:00:18] Joey Krug: We're now seeing East Treasury companies, Salana Treasury companies.
[00:00:22] Mario: How do you think it changes the structure of this market?
[00:00:24] Mario: I think it probably works less well as you go down the list of assets
[00:00:28] Joey Krug: in the same reason that a small microcaps stock can't really issue that much debt.
[00:00:32] Joey Krug: People want to buy Apple bonds or Goldman Sach bonds.
[00:00:35] Joey Krug: They don't really want to buy just small to mid cap.
[00:00:37] Joey Krug: We've talked about some of these regulatory changes that have been made
[00:00:40] Mario: under the Trump administration and how much hostility there was under the Biden administration.
[00:00:44] Mario: I think most have served saying,
[00:00:46] Joey Krug: I remember under the Biden amendment for a crypto,
[00:00:48] Joey Krug: wasn't the SEC actually tried to take the position at a point that stable coins were a security.
[00:00:52] Joey Krug: Even though like if you buy USDC, you can't really make money.
[00:00:58] Prediction markets are having a moment.
[00:01:03] Mario: Over the past two years, these exchanges have gone from curiosities to possibly the future of finance.
[00:01:09] Mario: Increasingly, platforms like Polymarket attract billions in monthly volume
[00:01:13] Mario: from traders keen to speculate on just about anything.
[00:01:16] Mario: From political races, to sports events, to the number of tweets Elon Musk will post the Niggivin timeframe.
[00:01:22] Mario: Today's guests, Joey Krueg, saw the opportunity in prediction markets
[00:01:25] Mario: long before the rest of the world.
[00:01:27] Mario: Building the first decentralized player in 2014,
[00:01:31] Mario: and then backing Polymarket as a partner at Founders Fund nearly a decade later.
[00:01:35] Mario: In this episode, Joey unpacks his history with the concept.
[00:01:38] Mario: Why the moment is finally right for prediction markets to take off,
[00:01:42] Mario: and how he expects them to develop.
[00:01:44] Mario: We also cover the crypto treasury movement,
[00:01:47] Mario: including Founders Fund's investment in ETH Treasury player BitMine,
[00:01:51] Mario: and finish with Joey's thoughts on the state of the crypto markets.
[00:01:55] As a note, our discussion covers tradable assets,
[00:01:57] Mario: so please remember that none of this is financial advice.
[00:02:01] Mario: And with that in mind, let's get to the conversation.
[00:02:04] Mario: I'm Mario, and this is the generalist.
[00:02:07] Every revolution in AI creates one question that never changes.
[00:02:11] Mario: Can you trust the output?
[00:02:13] Mario: AI for work is incredible, but without trust, it's just leading to faster mistakes.
[00:02:19] Mario: The challenge isn't building an AI that can answer questions,
[00:02:22] Mario: it's making sure those answers are right.
[00:02:25] Mario: That's where Guru comes in.
[00:02:26] Mario: It's the AI source of truth that connects everything your company knows.
[00:02:30] Mario: So every insight, every answer, every recommendation,
[00:02:34] Mario: is grounded in verified knowledge,
[00:02:36] Mario: not outdated information or hallucinations.
[00:02:39] Mario: When your teams and your AI share one trusted foundation,
[00:02:43] Mario: everything moves faster, with fewer Redoos, fewer Blind Spots,
[00:02:47] Mario: and more confidence in every decision.
[00:02:49] Mario: Because in the age of AI,
[00:02:51] Mario: truth isn't just power, it's protection.
[00:02:54] Mario: See what Guru is doing for thousands of companies
[00:02:56] Mario: like Spotify, DHL, and Stripe at GetGuru.com.
[00:03:01] Mario: That's GetGuru.com.
[00:03:04] This episode is brought to you by Auth0.
[00:03:06] Mario: Auth0 is an easy to implement adaptable authentication
[00:03:10] Mario: and authorization platform.
[00:03:12] Mario: Think easy user logins, social sign-on, MFA,
[00:03:15] Mario: and robust roll-based access control.

[00:03:31] Mario: to manage user logins, roles, and permissions.
[00:03:34] Mario: Auth0's new offering, Auth4GNI,
[00:03:37] Mario: is currently available for developer preview.
[00:03:39] Mario: Secure your AI agents and integrate
[00:03:41] Mario: with the GNI ecosystem using features like user authentication,
[00:03:45] Mario: token vault, which calls third-party APIs on a user's behalf,
[00:03:49] Mario: async authorization, and fine-grained authorization for RG.
[00:03:54] What typically takes 50 plus lines of code
[00:03:56] Mario: is reduced to just a few, so you can focus on building
[00:03:59] Mario: the AI apps yourself rather than worrying about how to secure them.

[00:04:12] Mario: Joey, I'm so excited to have you here.
[00:04:14] Mario: Ever since we met through the Founders Fund piece,
[00:04:17] Mario: I remember being really struck by what a sharp and interesting person you are
[00:04:23] Mario: with a really unique perspective on crypto.
[00:04:25] Mario: So, yeah, thrilled to have you here.
[00:04:27] Mario: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:04:29] Mario: Amazing. Well, I'm excited to get into a lot of different pieces today,
[00:04:32] Mario: including some of your story and some of the pieces of the crypto market
[00:04:37] Mario: that you've been involved in.
[00:04:39] Mario: Particularly, I think, prediction markets
[00:04:40] Mario: has been a big part of your story both as a builder and as an investor.
[00:04:44] Mario: But maybe to start out, I wanted to circle back
[00:04:47] Mario: to part of your origins, which I remember really struck me
[00:04:51] Mario: when we talked back in the day, which is that I think you told me
[00:04:56] Mario: that in your early days as a kid, some of the first quote-unquote
[00:05:00] Mario: investing you did was was betting on horse races.
[00:05:03] Mario: How did that start?
[00:05:05] Mario: Yeah, that's right.
[00:05:06] Joey Krug: So, I used to be really, I still am really into horses and horse racing.
[00:05:12] Joey Krug: And when I was a kid, I used to go riding a lot.
[00:05:16] Joey Krug: And I just remember one year watching the Kentucky Derby on TV.
[00:05:23] Joey Krug: And there was a big long shot hay out for the horse that won.
[00:05:28] Joey Krug: I kind of looked at it and I was like, that's interesting.
[00:05:30] Joey Krug: I wonder if there's a way you could predict which horses are more
[00:05:34] Joey Krug: like they'd win and then bet on that to make money.
[00:05:39] Joey Krug: Which usually is the start of a story where things are about
[00:05:42] Joey Krug: to go south.
[00:05:44] Joey Krug: But in my case, I was able to actually, I basically borrowed $20
[00:05:49] Joey Krug: from my mom and started looking into it and built a really
[00:05:54] Joey Krug: simple linear model system, literally just in Excel,
[00:05:59] Joey Krug: where I'd get all this historical data about all the horses
[00:06:02] Joey Krug: in a given race.
[00:06:03] Joey Krug: And then I'd look at all the races on any given day.
[00:06:06] Joey Krug: And then pick two or three bats to make basically.
[00:06:10] Joey Krug: Wow.
[00:06:11] Mario: It's fascinating to me that clearly the odds were not sharp enough
[00:06:16] Mario: to sort of have done that sort of work.
[00:06:18] Mario: Where was the edge in that model out of curiosity?
[00:06:20] Mario: I think one example where there's probably the most extreme edge was
[00:06:23] Joey Krug: like, if you have a track where it's like really muddy and really rainy,
[00:06:28] Joey Krug: there's some horses that just, I don't know if it's genetics
[00:06:31] Joey Krug: or just like personality, but some horses really
[00:06:33] Joey Krug: love to run in the rain.
[00:06:34] Joey Krug: And so that's one example where there's massive mispricees
[00:06:39] Joey Krug: because there's horses that look really good on paper,
[00:06:41] Joey Krug: but they've only ever read, only ever ran,
[00:06:44] Joey Krug: like a clear sunny day where the track super dry and fast.
[00:06:47] Joey Krug: Versus there's some horses that just really
[00:06:49] Joey Krug: outperform when the track is super muddy and filthy.
[00:06:52] Joey Krug: That's one example where it doesn't happen very often,
[00:06:54] Joey Krug: but you come across that scenario where this horse
[00:06:56] Joey Krug: has really good past performance in the rain.
[00:06:59] Joey Krug: That's one market dislocation.
[00:07:01] Joey Krug: Another one is like, people are really bad.
[00:07:04] Joey Krug: All this stuff is much more efficient now,
[00:07:06] Joey Krug: but back then people are really bad at like,
[00:07:09] Joey Krug: you look at a horse and it's one of its last few races,
[00:07:12] Joey Krug: but the distance on those races are significantly shorter
[00:07:16] Joey Krug: than the race it's about to be run.
[00:07:18] And you have a horse that's maybe gotten, you know, second,
[00:07:21] Joey Krug: but it has run that long distance before.
[00:07:24] Joey Krug: That horse is usually undervalued
[00:07:26] Joey Krug: relative to the one that's going up in distance
[00:07:28] Joey Krug: because it's just like a new thing for the horse
[00:07:31] Joey Krug: and they tend to underperform.
[00:07:32] Joey Krug: Stuff like that is sort of what what surface is.
[00:07:35] Mario: I love these sorts of stories because, you know,
[00:07:37] Mario: I think when you're a kid, especially you,
[00:07:39] Mario: you haven't necessarily have your mind, you know,
[00:07:42] Mario: trained or warped or sort of molded into these strict ways.
[00:07:46] Mario: And so you can see just sort of the natural way
[00:07:49] Mario: people's brains work.
[00:07:49] Mario: And so clearly this was something that, you know,
[00:07:51] Mario: almost congenitally or behaviorally,
[00:07:54] Mario: you're predisposed to look for these opportunities
[00:07:57] Mario: in a way that has certainly served you as an investor today.
[00:08:01] Mario: It sounds like you were, you know,
[00:08:02] Mario: obviously a very technical child, so to speak.
[00:08:06] I believe that I read that you started learning
[00:08:10] Mario: AppleSoft Basic, which is not the most common type of code
[00:08:14] Mario: that someone would traditionally learn to learn to code.
[00:08:18] Mario: How did that happen?
[00:08:19] Mario: Yeah, that's kind of funny because sometimes, you know,
[00:08:24] Joey Krug: just like over the years, like in business, you know,
[00:08:27] Joey Krug: come across people that are, you know,
[00:08:28] Joey Krug: and they're like 50s or 60s and, you know,
[00:08:31] Joey Krug: somehow the subject of like how did you start programming comes up?
[00:08:34] Joey Krug: And often they will have started programming on AppleSoft,
[00:08:37] Joey Krug: you know, Basic, right?
[00:08:38] Joey Krug: And they're surprised when, you know,
[00:08:40] Joey Krug: I'm like, yeah, me too.
[00:08:41] Joey Krug: For me, that was just, when I was in middle school,
[00:08:45] Joey Krug: my dad got me an old, an old Apple II computer
[00:08:48] Joey Krug: that he just bought on eBay.
[00:08:51] Joey Krug: And, you know, it was like, hey, like you should,
[00:08:53] Joey Krug: you know, learn to program on this.
[00:08:55] Joey Krug: And, you know, it got me like,
[00:08:57] Joey Krug: what are two books about Basic?
[00:08:59] Joey Krug: And I just started writing, you know,
[00:09:01] Joey Krug: really, really simple programs,
[00:09:05] Joey Krug: which is kind of a good way to start, you know,
[00:09:08] Joey Krug: because there's not that much you can do,
[00:09:11] Joey Krug: like you're basically just using like a command prompt
[00:09:13] Joey Krug: or terminal and writing, you know, text-based programs.
[00:09:17] Joey Krug: There's not really, like in theory,
[00:09:19] Joey Krug: I think you can, you can, you know, write a server
[00:09:22] Joey Krug: and AppleSoft Basic, but like, that's not the kind
[00:09:24] Joey Krug: of stuff most people did.
[00:09:24] Joey Krug: It was just sort of like mostly local programs
[00:09:26] Joey Krug: running on the machine.
[00:09:27] Joey Krug: So it's pretty like contained way to start programming,
[00:09:29] Joey Krug: which I think is actually pretty,
[00:09:31] Joey Krug: was a pretty good way to start.
[00:09:32] Joey Krug: Really interesting.
[00:09:34] Mario: And so you sort of, you know,
[00:09:36] Mario: we're obviously interested in computers
[00:09:37] Mario: and you had sort of this investor sensibilities,
[00:09:40] Mario: whether you would have thought of it that way
[00:09:42] Mario: or not at the time, when did sort of crypto
[00:09:44] Mario: enter the picture?
[00:09:45] Mario: Was this, you know, somehow discovering
[00:09:48] Mario: the Bitcoin white paper and finding that fascinating?
[00:09:50] Mario: Was it, you know, something that happened a little later?
[00:09:53] Joey Krug: Yeah, I mean, crypto, I first came across through gaming.
[00:09:57] Joey Krug: I used to play a lot of video games when I was a kid
[00:10:01] Joey Krug: and I had this computer that had to,
[00:10:04] Joey Krug: to like AMD, radion, 6870, VPUs.
[00:10:07] Joey Krug: And I used to be into like overclocking it,
[00:10:09] Joey Krug: you know, making it on faster than stock.
[00:10:12] Joey Krug: And there was this form where someone
[00:10:15] Joey Krug: that basically posted like, hey, there's this software.
[00:10:17] Joey Krug: If you run it, you can earn money kind of like out of thin air
[00:10:22] Joey Krug: with your graphics card.
[00:10:25] Joey Krug: And I came across that as like, that sounds like a scam,
[00:10:27] Joey Krug: but also, you know, this is a really popular thread.
[00:10:29] Joey Krug: So, you know, maybe there's something here
[00:10:32] Joey Krug: and it turns out it was like, I think the program
[00:10:35] Joey Krug: was GPU minor and, you know, it's reminding Bitcoin
[00:10:37] Joey Krug: on your GPU and that's sort of how I first came across it.
[00:10:41] Joey Krug: And then I didn't read the white paper until like,
[00:10:43] Joey Krug: maybe a month later, because I had some of these,
[00:10:45] Joey Krug: you know, bitcoins that had mined
[00:10:47] Joey Krug: and I was like, you know, should I sell this
[00:10:49] Joey Krug: or, or is there something real here?
[00:10:50] Joey Krug: Like, is this a scam or not?
[00:10:52] Joey Krug: And that's when I actually read the paper
[00:10:53] Joey Krug: and kind of thought it was a cool idea.
[00:10:55] Joey Krug: Wow, that's amazing.
[00:10:56] Mario: So you were, I assume like in high school
[00:10:59] Mario: or even, you know, sort of mining Bitcoin in your room
[00:11:03] Mario: on your GPUs effectively.
[00:11:05] Mario: Yep, that's right.
[00:11:07] Mario: Wow.
[00:11:08] Mario: And so then you read the white paper,
[00:11:09] Mario: you know, you go to college study computer science
[00:11:11] Mario: before sort of dropping out.
[00:11:13] Mario: It was the white paper sort of a moment
[00:11:16] Mario: where you're like, hey, actually, you know,
[00:11:17] Mario: the way that I see computer science
[00:11:18] Mario: is gonna be through this paradigm
[00:11:20] Mario: or how did it sort of go from maybe this curiosity
[00:11:23] Mario: to a thing where you're saying, hey,
[00:11:25] Mario: I'm actually gonna step out of school
[00:11:27] Mario: and try and build something in this space.
[00:11:30] Mario: I'd always been really interested in medicine as well
[00:11:34] Joey Krug: for a bunch of other reasons that you can get it to
[00:11:37] Joey Krug: at some point if you want, but basically,
[00:11:38] Joey Krug: I was interested in medicine and I always thought that like,
[00:11:41] Joey Krug: you know, if you're really interesting,
[00:11:43] Joey Krug: you know, if you were like a doctor
[00:11:44] Joey Krug: who could also program, I thought that would be,
[00:11:47] Joey Krug: you know, maybe there's something interesting
[00:11:49] Joey Krug: that you could build if you did that.
[00:11:50] Joey Krug: Then went to school and then, you know,
[00:11:54] Joey Krug: kind of two things happened.
[00:11:55] Joey Krug: One, I sort of thought about, yeah, I love school,
[00:11:58] Joey Krug: but I also thought about, you know,
[00:12:00] Joey Krug: if you're a doctor, you need to do another four years
[00:12:02] Joey Krug: plus probably another four in like residency, you know,
[00:12:04] Joey Krug: kind of at the same time, the price of it claim was rising.
[00:12:08] Joey Krug: There's all this interesting stuff happening in crypto.
[00:12:12] Joey Krug: The Ethereum white paper kind of just came out
[00:12:14] Joey Krug: and like none of the professors were teaching courses
[00:12:17] Joey Krug: on crypto anyways.
[00:12:18] Joey Krug: I mean, now you can take courses about it in Stanford
[00:12:21] Joey Krug: where you can like, you know, write smart contracts
[00:12:23] Joey Krug: and you know, do stuff with zero knowledge proofs,
[00:12:26] Joey Krug: but back to the time, especially in undergrad,
[00:12:28] Joey Krug: like that didn't exist.
[00:12:29] Joey Krug: And so I found myself just reading lots of papers
[00:12:32] Joey Krug: about crypto and, you know, buying and selling crypto
[00:12:35] Joey Krug: and sort of kind of thought that like,
[00:12:37] Joey Krug: I may as well just leave school and build something
[00:12:39] Joey Krug: in the space as opposed to spending another three years there
[00:12:43] Joey Krug: and not really learning anything about crypto anyways
[00:12:47] Joey Krug: beyond what I was doing on my free time.
[00:12:48] Joey Krug: And so I may as well just do that full time
[00:12:51] Joey Krug: with sort of the high level logic.
[00:12:53] Mario: You had an amazing breadcrumb that I can't help but follow,
[00:12:56] Mario: which is that you have this interest also in healthcare
[00:12:58] Mario: and this idea of a, you know, a doctor who can code.
[00:13:01] Mario: I think would have been really prescient
[00:13:03] Mario: if you look at some of the sort of the stuff
[00:13:05] Mario: with, you know, computational biology, biotech,
[00:13:07] Mario: you know, all of these things that have also grown
[00:13:09] Mario: in sophistication in the time period since,
[00:13:12] Mario: where did that sort of interest originate from?
[00:13:14] Mario: And, you know, to the extent that you have sort of the latitude
[00:13:17] Mario: to explore that interest today, how does it,
[00:13:21] Mario: yeah, how does it influence how you think?
[00:13:22] Mario: Yeah, I mean, we're a resonator,
[00:13:24] Joey Krug: it was kind of way back.
[00:13:28] Joey Krug: Also when I was in middle school, like roughly fifth grade,
[00:13:31] Joey Krug: my brother got this really, really rare disease called,
[00:13:34] Joey Krug: help atypical hemolytic urenec syndrome.
[00:13:36] Joey Krug: It's basically a kidney disorder
[00:13:39] Joey Krug: where your red blood cells basically
[00:13:43] Joey Krug: like destroy themselves.
[00:13:45] Joey Krug: It's called hemolysis.
[00:13:46] Joey Krug: And I ended up just spending a ton of time,
[00:13:48] Joey Krug: actually dropped out of school for the first time,
[00:13:52] Joey Krug: then just homeschool myself for a year.
[00:13:53] Joey Krug: And so I could spend time in the hospital with him
[00:13:56] Joey Krug: and also research like any potential treatment for it.
[00:14:00] Joey Krug: Eventually came across this drug called Solaris,
[00:14:03] Joey Krug: which is, which is used for this other blood disorder called PNH,
[00:14:07] Joey Krug: but it's sort of, if you give a patient who has AHUS
[00:14:12] Joey Krug: to not have to say the whole mouthful every time.
[00:14:15] Joey Krug: If you give, if you give a patient with AHUS, Solaris,
[00:14:18] Joey Krug: it also basically effectively treats them
[00:14:21] Joey Krug: and makes them 100% normal.
[00:14:23] Joey Krug: And so we basically, it's a really long story,
[00:14:26] Joey Krug: but basically we got my brother to this doctor
[00:14:29] Joey Krug: at the University of Iowa who was doing,
[00:14:32] Joey Krug: like the first trial with like five patients
[00:14:34] Joey Krug: with his disease with this drug.
[00:14:37] Joey Krug: And the company is called Alexion Pharmaceuticals.
[00:14:40] Joey Krug: And hindsight, I should have bought this stock as well.
[00:14:43] Joey Krug: But didn't think about that back then,
[00:14:45] Joey Krug: but he's on it now, it's actually a newer version
[00:14:48] Joey Krug: that's longer lasting and 100% normal versus it was a disease
[00:14:53] Joey Krug: that had like a 95% 5 to 7 year mortality rate
[00:14:58] Joey Krug: prior to this drug assisting.
[00:15:01] Joey Krug: So that's what got me into medicine,
[00:15:02] Joey Krug: because there's just all this really interesting stuff
[00:15:06] Joey Krug: you can do.
[00:15:07] Joey Krug: I think the other thing that kind of may be interested
[00:15:09] Joey Krug: in that was like, there's kind of just this like
[00:15:11] Joey Krug: wide disparity between what certain doctors
[00:15:13] Joey Krug: were aware of as well.
[00:15:14] Joey Krug: I think AI is like narrowing that,
[00:15:16] Joey Krug: but like he was at Wash You in St. Louis.
[00:15:18] Joey Krug: The doctors there basically didn't believe
[00:15:21] Joey Krug: this drug would work and were like,
[00:15:23] Joey Krug: yeah, there's nothing we can do versus,
[00:15:26] Joey Krug: this man and doctor, Iowa,
[00:15:28] Joey Krug: was running this trial that worked and made him basically
[00:15:33] Joey Krug: 100% better within six months.
[00:15:36] Joey Krug: And so that's sort of how I first got interested in
[00:15:39] Joey Krug: and it.
[00:15:40] Joey Krug: That is an astonishing story.
[00:15:43] Mario: I mean, it's sort of wild to me because it's clear
[00:15:46] Mario: that even as a kid, you must have been one extremely high
[00:15:51] Mario: openness that you're like,
[00:15:53] Mario: I'm open to the idea of this new kind of money.
[00:15:57] Mario: And also I'm open to this different type of drug,
[00:15:59] Mario: but also I'm at risk of using jargon
[00:16:03] Mario: that is too tech jargony, but very high agency
[00:16:05] Mario: that you're, you know, you know, has a kid thinking
[00:16:09] Mario: about these solutions and able to sort of broker these things.
[00:16:12] Mario: So yeah, wow, I mean, it's really remarkable.
[00:16:16] Mario: Yeah, do you find yourself spending time on that
[00:16:19] Mario: in your sort of nights and weekends?
[00:16:21] Mario: I feel like everyone sort of needs a place
[00:16:24] Mario: very different from their work life to go,
[00:16:26] Mario: you know, almost think about something totally different.
[00:16:30] Yeah, I mean, my nights and weekends are basically two things.
[00:16:33] Joey Krug: Yeah, one is, you know, kind of looking into what's going on
[00:16:37] Joey Krug: in medicine or biotech.
[00:16:40] Joey Krug: Just always been interested in it kind of sparked
[00:16:43] Joey Krug: from that story, but then I've also spent some
[00:16:46] Joey Krug: a bit of time on like Sean Lee when I at FoundersFounder
[00:16:48] Joey Krug: looking at some companies in this base as well,
[00:16:51] Joey Krug: priced in more time, you know, over the years there.
[00:16:54] Joey Krug: But I think the other area is trading.
[00:16:58] Joey Krug: I do a lot of, you know, trading in public markets,
[00:17:01] Joey Krug: which is a good, a good way to stay sharp and also has a faster,
[00:17:05] Joey Krug: faster feedback leap than, than, you know, VC,
[00:17:08] Joey Krug: but also informs your world view for investing in privates.
[00:17:11] Joey Krug: And so that's the other nights and weekends thing that I do.
[00:17:15] Joey Krug: I love it.
[00:17:16] Mario: That's a great union Yang to sort of come back to, you know,
[00:17:20] some of these early formative crypto experiences.
[00:17:23] Mario: I'm going to jump around a little bit because there are pieces
[00:17:26] Mario: that I really want to dig into that I think are especially
[00:17:29] Mario: relevant to the way the markets are today,
[00:17:32] Mario: the place the market is in today, but to sort of jump
[00:17:35] Mario: back in where we left off, you dropped out of school
[00:17:37] Mario: and then built what was really this sort of,
[00:17:40] Mario: I think the first crypto prediction market called auger.
[00:17:43] Mario: How did that idea come to you?
[00:17:45] Mario: Because it's one that has really found its place in the sun,
[00:17:49] Mario: you know, maybe a decade later.
[00:17:51] Mario: It was one of the first use cases talked about after,
[00:17:54] Joey Krug: after a theory I kind of came out.
[00:17:56] Joey Krug: It was one of the use cases, you know, first,
[00:17:58] Joey Krug: first mentioned the Ethereum white paper even,
[00:18:00] Joey Krug: like Vitalik wrote about it and I didn't know that.
[00:18:02] Joey Krug: I wrote a couple of blog posts.
[00:18:04] Joey Krug: Yeah, so it wasn't like a novel idea,
[00:18:06] Joey Krug: but it was sort of an idea I was interested in kind of
[00:18:10] Joey Krug: dating probably back to the horse racing, you know, betting stuff.
[00:18:15] Joey Krug: Where I sort of thought that back then,
[00:18:19] Joey Krug: you couldn't really bet on sports on horse racing in the US.
[00:18:22] Joey Krug: You had to use these offshore places where, you know,
[00:18:24] Joey Krug: it was just like, you're betting against the Buffy, right?
[00:18:27] Joey Krug: And I always thought that that should be a market.
[00:18:29] Joey Krug: So that was one reason I was interested in it.
[00:18:31] Joey Krug: But then the other reason was that I thought that,
[00:18:34] Joey Krug: like Shane from Polymarket talks about all this all the time,
[00:18:35] Joey Krug: but we both kind of read some of the same papers from like Hayek
[00:18:38] Joey Krug: and there's also like these two economists,
[00:18:42] Joey Krug: Arrow and DeBro that had this idea of like complete markets
[00:18:45] Joey Krug: or complete securities where if you have markets
[00:18:47] Joey Krug: where you can basically bet respectfully on anything,
[00:18:51] Joey Krug: that's sort of like the ultimate, you know,
[00:18:53] Joey Krug: at least in their view, ultimate vision of capitalism.
[00:18:55] Joey Krug: And I was really drawn to this vision as well.
[00:18:58] Joey Krug: It's like, if you can have markets on any future state of the world,
[00:19:03] Joey Krug: you can then use that information for lots of other things.
[00:19:07] Joey Krug: It's that sort of like the intellectual reasons why I was interested in it.
[00:19:11] Mario: Super interesting, you know, I think probably
[00:19:13] Mario: the vast majority of listeners will have heard of prediction markets.
[00:19:16] Mario: But for some reason, someone hasn't,
[00:19:18] Mario: I think you encapsulated it so well there, this idea that yet,
[00:19:20] Mario: betting on anything can be a presidential election
[00:19:23] Mario: and a mayoral election, it can be, you know,
[00:19:26] Mario: what the fed rate are going to be in a certain period of time.
[00:19:30] Mario: It can be if China's going to invade Taiwan
[00:19:32] Mario: and being able to, you know, do that in a sort of centralized location
[00:19:37] Mario: where there's, you know, lots of liquidity, hopefully,
[00:19:39] Mario: and you know, a sort of robust system of resolution.
[00:19:43] Mario: It's interesting to me because I think there's a lot of people
[00:19:45] Mario: who actually came to crypto sort of nerds
[00:19:47] Mario: sniped by what you were doing with auger and prediction markets in general.
[00:19:51] Mario: Like I remember talking to Dan Romero from Farcaster
[00:19:55] Mario: and he mentioned that that was like something
[00:19:57] Mario: that really got him excited about crypto in general.
[00:20:01] Mario: What do you think it is about that concept
[00:20:04] Mario: that like seems to really intrigue smart people?
[00:20:06] Mario: I think, you know, when I go back to it's like,
[00:20:08] Joey Krug: okay, if you look at Bitcoin, you know,
[00:20:11] Joey Krug: the thing that intrigues people about it is it's like this first,
[00:20:13] Joey Krug: you know, what do you call it, a monetary or gold
[00:20:17] Joey Krug: like asset that's, you know, kind of digital and independent of any government.
[00:20:20] Joey Krug: And then if you look at smart contracts, you know,
[00:20:23] Joey Krug: they enable you to basically do that for anything in the financial system.
[00:20:26] Joey Krug: And then so the next kind of level of logic is like,
[00:20:29] Joey Krug: well, okay, he has smart contracts.
[00:20:31] Joey Krug: What's kind of the most logical thing to do?
[00:20:34] Joey Krug: Well, it's to create a financial market that's, you know,
[00:20:37] Joey Krug: independent of the traditional financial, you know, institutions
[00:20:39] Joey Krug: where you can basically speculate on anything you could possibly want to speculate on.
[00:20:45] Joey Krug: And, you know, not only that, but you can create these markets, you know,
[00:20:48] Joey Krug: fairly quickly in a matter of minutes.
[00:20:51] Joey Krug: And it basically kind of democratizes like, you know,
[00:20:55] Joey Krug: most people have seen like the big short, if you remember the scene where they're going around,
[00:20:58] Joey Krug: getting all these as the agreements in place with, you know,
[00:21:01] Joey Krug: the big banks take on the specific bets they want to make.
[00:21:03] Joey Krug: And, Deary, like, you could get a really informed counter-party
[00:21:08] Joey Krug: who's willing to let you speculate millions of dollars on almost anything
[00:21:11] Joey Krug: and fit it under a swap agreement, right?
[00:21:14] Joey Krug: In practice, you know, if you go to JP Morgan and say,
[00:21:17] Joey Krug: hey, I'd like to bet $10 million that, you know,
[00:21:20] Joey Krug: Russia invades Ukraine or whatever, yes, they're going to be like,
[00:21:23] Joey Krug: what are you talking about?
[00:21:26] Joey Krug: Yeah.
[00:21:26] Joey Krug: And so I think people are interested in prediction markets because it allows you
[00:21:30] Joey Krug: to basically take the same kind of intellectual underpinnings,
[00:21:33] Joey Krug: things like Bitcoin and smart contracts and then apply them to any,
[00:21:37] Joey Krug: any financial market where it's just like a pure, you know, free market
[00:21:41] Joey Krug: where anyone, you know, globally can trade them.
[00:21:44] Joey Krug: And so I think that's sort of why people got excited about this idea.
[00:21:48] Mario: And also just even for folks that, you know,
[00:21:50] Mario: maybe don't see themselves as the speculator themselves,
[00:21:54] Mario: there is just this value of having this crowd wisdom or, you know,
[00:21:59] Mario: what, you know, it's probably better ways to really describe it.
[00:22:01] Mario: But getting to see the odds or the, you know,
[00:22:05] Mario: the prognostications of a group of people that are actually putting some,
[00:22:09] Mario: some amount of asset at risk to sort of justify their opinions,
[00:22:13] Mario: it gets you sort of closer to truth hopefully,
[00:22:16] Mario: or at least the perceptions people have of that moment,
[00:22:20] Mario: which I think is, you know, now extremely valuable.
[00:22:22] Mario: I find myself going to the polymarket and CalShi and looking and saying,
[00:22:27] Mario: you know, okay, what are the odds in this race?
[00:22:29] Mario: Or, you know, what are the sort of the view of the world right now?
[00:22:32] Mario: So there's this sort of informational aspect that is really valuable.
[00:22:36] Yeah.
[00:22:37] Joey Krug: Yeah, I think that's totally right.
[00:22:38] Joey Krug: Like I go to polymarket multiple times a week just to inform my view of the world
[00:22:42] Joey Krug: and often it's like interesting trades you can do around that too.
[00:22:46] Joey Krug: Like what one, like one small example, you know,
[00:22:49] Joey Krug: for someone who's like skeptical of this idea, right?
[00:22:52] Joey Krug: Like one small example right now is like you go to polymarket
[00:22:55] Joey Krug: and there's a greater than 50% chance that the United States does a military
[00:22:59] Joey Krug: action in Venezuela by the end of the year.
[00:23:02] Joey Krug: Like you'd be asked, we'll see, well, on the street,
[00:23:04] Joey Krug: they would probably say it's below that, right?
[00:23:05] Joey Krug: You know, like one example, like I'm buying a couple stocks that are exposed
[00:23:09] Joey Krug: to Venezuela right now because I think like,
[00:23:11] Joey Krug: yeah, it's probably miss priced.
[00:23:13] Joey Krug: There's a bunch of different things like that.
[00:23:14] Joey Krug: If you go back to the tariff stuff, you know,
[00:23:17] Joey Krug: earlier than in the year where prediction markets were like super, super
[00:23:21] Joey Krug: useful to understand what's actually going on.
[00:23:23] Joey Krug: So, you know, to come back to what you were doing with auger,
[00:23:28] Mario: why was it structurally that crypto was such an unlock for this idea?
[00:23:32] Mario: You've sort of mentioned parts of it there.
[00:23:34] Mario: But yeah, well, you know, if you sort of put yourself back into your,
[00:23:37] Mario: your teenage self there, what were the,
[00:23:38] Mario: the sort of theses that you were operating under?
[00:23:41] The unlock for crypto for prediction markets is,
[00:23:43] Joey Krug: and it's sort of similar for, for, you know,
[00:23:46] Joey Krug: why crypto is useful for other things as well is one,
[00:23:49] Joey Krug: it's, it's inherently a sort of global market.
[00:23:53] Joey Krug: So, you know, you just need an internet connection and a way to access,
[00:23:57] Joey Krug: you know, back of auger, you need to east to bet, you know,
[00:24:00] Joey Krug: now you can use stablecoins.
[00:24:01] Joey Krug: And then the second thing that it does is,
[00:24:06] Joey Krug: and this is probably kind of a bit more slept on thing.
[00:24:08] Joey Krug: But if you look at sportsbooks,
[00:24:10] Joey Krug: part of the reason their fees are so high is one,
[00:24:12] Joey Krug: they're taking the other side of every bet, so it's not a market.
[00:24:15] Joey Krug: But I think the other reason if people don't think about as much
[00:24:19] Joey Krug: is a lot of payment methods are reversible.
[00:24:22] Joey Krug: So, there's the risks that you, you know,
[00:24:24] Joey Krug: bet $500 on the Yankees game,
[00:24:27] Joey Krug: and then charge it back and say,
[00:24:28] Joey Krug: I'll actually, I didn't make that bet.
[00:24:29] Joey Krug: Someone wants to stolen my card.
[00:24:30] Joey Krug: And so you have to price that in,
[00:24:32] Joey Krug: crypto doesn't have that problem,
[00:24:34] Joey Krug: because it's, you know, once you send it,
[00:24:35] Joey Krug: it's settled and there's no way to kind of reverse
[00:24:39] Joey Krug: like a stablecoin transaction,
[00:24:41] Joey Krug: the exception of some obscure edge cases,
[00:24:44] Joey Krug: like if you're, you know, a terrorist or something.
[00:24:46] Joey Krug: And so I think that's another reason.
[00:24:50] Joey Krug: And I think the third reason is that
[00:24:52] Joey Krug: it's sort of just the most efficient way
[00:24:53] Joey Krug: to operate or run financial markets.
[00:24:57] Joey Krug: Like if you think about, you know,
[00:24:59] Joey Krug: how you would create something like this
[00:25:02] Joey Krug: and, you know, kind of the traditional finance landscape,
[00:25:05] Joey Krug: like you can, you can do it,
[00:25:07] Joey Krug: but it's just a lot clunkier.
[00:25:09] Joey Krug: And it's a lot harder to kind of share the liquidity pool,
[00:25:13] Joey Krug: you know, in countries outside the US.
[00:25:15] Joey Krug: And you end up having some of the same, you know,
[00:25:20] Joey Krug: charge back risks that the sports books have.
[00:25:22] Joey Krug: And so I think back when, you know,
[00:25:24] Joey Krug: I was working on auger, the main unlocks were just like
[00:25:26] Joey Krug: it's global, you know, 24-7.
[00:25:30] Joey Krug: And, yeah, you can create these, these financial markets
[00:25:34] Joey Krug: pretty easily versus having to go through a lot of steps
[00:25:37] Joey Krug: and paperwork and stuff like that
[00:25:39] Joey Krug: that you have to do in that traditional system.
[00:25:41] Joey Krug: And in terms of the, the sort of reasons that auger
[00:25:44] Mario: didn't ultimately work,
[00:25:46] Mario: it feels like a lot of that was just sort of
[00:25:48] hamstrung by the state of crypto infrastructure at the time,
[00:25:52] Mario: you know, the speed of these transactions,
[00:25:54] Mario: the cost of the transactions, what were the pieces
[00:25:57] Mario: that you feel like, you know, even if we'd had,
[00:26:00] Mario: let's say 100% perfect execution,
[00:26:02] Mario: we would have really hit a wall because of XYZ.
[00:26:05] Joey Krug: There's a few reasons.
[00:26:05] Joey Krug: I think some of them were things, you know,
[00:26:08] Joey Krug: in our control and some of the more things,
[00:26:10] Joey Krug: not in our control.
[00:26:11] Joey Krug: I think if you look at, you know,
[00:26:14] Joey Krug: back then, for most of that period,
[00:26:17] Joey Krug: the government was, especially under Biden,
[00:26:19] Joey Krug: the government was quite hostile to crypto.
[00:26:21] Joey Krug: Yeah, true.
[00:26:22] Joey Krug: There was even like a speech,
[00:26:24] Joey Krug: getting by, you know, one of the CFTC commissioners
[00:26:26] Joey Krug: at the time that like, I haven't talked about this before.
[00:26:30] Joey Krug: So this is maybe new to some people,
[00:26:32] Joey Krug: but it's basically like clearly like 100% about, you know,
[00:26:36] Joey Krug: auger.
[00:26:37] Joey Krug: Oh, really?
[00:26:38] Joey Krug: Yeah.
[00:26:39] Joey Krug: And it's about prediction markets.
[00:26:41] Joey Krug: We were the only prediction market, you know,
[00:26:43] Joey Krug: in crypto back then.
[00:26:44] Joey Krug: And it was saying that, you know,
[00:26:46] Joey Krug: developers of smart contracts should be held liable
[00:26:49] Joey Krug: for the actions that take place using those smart contracts,
[00:26:52] Joey Krug: which is sort of, sort of like saying that, you know,
[00:26:55] Joey Krug: Microsoft should be held liable.
[00:26:56] Joey Krug: Someone might still rant some note with word.
[00:26:58] Joey Krug: It's really absurd.
[00:27:00] Joey Krug: But also a lot of the legal stuff, you know,
[00:27:03] Joey Krug: hamstrung us because we were trying to build it
[00:27:05] Joey Krug: with kind of, you know, one and a half arms behind our back,
[00:27:10] Joey Krug: said to speak, where there's a million things we could have done
[00:27:13] Joey Krug: to make it like so much easier and faster and quicker to use.
[00:27:16] Joey Krug: But we just took the maximally decentralized approach.
[00:27:19] Joey Krug: Because the thing we were optimizing was that like,
[00:27:21] Joey Krug: if the government ever did Suez and it went to court,
[00:27:24] Joey Krug: we wanted to win, which meant that we did like almost nothing.
[00:27:27] Joey Krug: You know, we didn't create the markets on auger.
[00:27:28] Joey Krug: We never traded it in them.
[00:27:29] Joey Krug: We never market made in them.
[00:27:31] Joey Krug: We never resolved them ourselves.
[00:27:34] Joey Krug: We didn't even host the website.
[00:27:36] Joey Krug: And so it was like, you know, there,
[00:27:38] Joey Krug: there's a million reasons why it was just so hard to use.
[00:27:41] Joey Krug: And I think, you know, like if you, you went back and looked
[00:27:44] Joey Krug: in like the auger discord is public.
[00:27:47] Joey Krug: A lot of those chats are public.
[00:27:48] Joey Krug: You can see, you know, it's almost always a legal reason
[00:27:50] Joey Krug: why we took something that was clunky or harder to use
[00:27:53] Joey Krug: as opposed to like a, you know, UX reason.
[00:27:57] Joey Krug: I think that was a big part of it.
[00:27:59] Joey Krug: And I think another big part of it, even if,
[00:28:01] Joey Krug: even if we took all the legal risk and, you know,
[00:28:05] Joey Krug: I hate the second piece was just that the,
[00:28:08] Joey Krug: the kind of like tech and infrastructure wasn't ready.
[00:28:10] Joey Krug: Like when auger started, eventually there,
[00:28:13] Joey Krug: he's got built by companies like Alchemy,
[00:28:14] Joey Krug: but when auger started, there weren't even like, you know,
[00:28:18] Joey Krug: Ethereum node, RPC endpoints where you could talk
[00:28:20] Joey Krug: to an Ethereum node.
[00:28:21] Joey Krug: You had to spin up your own node to use auger at day one.
[00:28:23] Joey Krug: Also transactions were very expensive, you know,
[00:28:26] Joey Krug: on Ethereum.
[00:28:28] Joey Krug: In auger was kind of fairly gas and efficient as well.
[00:28:31] Joey Krug: Like doing a trade in auger would cost like $50, you know,
[00:28:34] Joey Krug: no one wants to pay $50 to do a $500 bet or whatever.
[00:28:38] Joey Krug: And so there are kind of all these reasons
[00:28:39] Joey Krug: that, you know, that's kind of gotten solved by layer two.
[00:28:41] Joey Krug: The infrastructure is a lot better, faster and cheaper.
[00:28:44] Joey Krug: Stable coins are a lot more widespread.
[00:28:46] Joey Krug: It's a lot easier to enrapt into crypto.
[00:28:48] Joey Krug: And so I think even if we took out a legal risk,
[00:28:50] Joey Krug: it probably wouldn't have taken off
[00:28:51] Joey Krug: like the timing was just wrong.
[00:28:53] Joey Krug: We were way too early.
[00:28:54] Joey Krug: But, you know, hopefully we, we, like,
[00:28:57] Joey Krug: inspired some people to build in the space.
[00:29:02] Joey Krug: So, yeah, that's sort of my, like, sort of my read of it.
[00:29:08] Joey Krug: Like maybe, maybe auger's, auger's Napster
[00:29:10] Joey Krug: and Polymer could spot a fire, something like that.
[00:29:13] Joey Krug: I love that.
[00:29:14] Mario: Yeah, and idea ahead of its time
[00:29:17] Mario: that certainly did inspire a lot of people.
[00:29:18] Mario: And I think brought a lot of people into crypto
[00:29:21] Mario: and intrigued a lot of people to sort of, you know,
[00:29:24] Mario: go forward in your career a little bit.
[00:29:26] Mario: You know, after auger, you became sort of co-CIO
[00:29:28] Mario: of Pantera Capital, which I, only in researching this episode,
[00:29:33] Mario: did I learn that it's a Tiger Cup,
[00:29:36] Mario: which, you know, sort of a,
[00:29:37] Mario: I didn't necessarily expect that
[00:29:39] Mario: from a really early crypto fund.
[00:29:42] Mario: But anyway, you went to Pantera
[00:29:44] Mario: and then, you know, landed at Founders Fund.
[00:29:45] Mario: And this is sort of where the, you know,
[00:29:47] Mario: I feel like the prediction market story comes full circle,
[00:29:51] Mario: which is that Founders Fund led the series A
[00:29:53] Mario: and has become a, you know, very large investor
[00:29:56] Mario: in, in Polymarket.
[00:29:58] How did, you know, Polymarket first come up on your radar?
[00:30:02] The first time I came across it was, was a long time ago
[00:30:05] Joey Krug: where back when I was doing auger,
[00:30:06] Joey Krug: Shane, I did sent me an email and, you kind of a list of like,
[00:30:11] Joey Krug: there's a good email, it's like a list of all the UI, UX stuff
[00:30:13] Joey Krug: that was, that was wrong with it.
[00:30:15] Joey Krug: And, you know, I sort of agreed with like 90% of it.
[00:30:21] Joey Krug: But a lot of, we just couldn't, couldn't do,
[00:30:23] Joey Krug: did do kind of all this stuff I just kind of went through.
[00:30:27] Joey Krug: And, and then I think maybe a year later,
[00:30:30] Joey Krug: I forget that exact timing on it.
[00:30:31] Joey Krug: But a year later, he was just like, you know,
[00:30:33] Joey Krug: decided to create Polymarket and build a prediction market
[00:30:37] Joey Krug: and wanted to basically kind of build a vision
[00:30:40] Joey Krug: that he thought made sense for it.
[00:30:42] Joey Krug: And we sort of stayed in touch, like in loose touch
[00:30:47] Joey Krug: off and on over the years.
[00:30:49] Joey Krug: And then the thing I kind of always told him was like,
[00:30:51] Joey Krug: if you get to, if you get to like clear
[00:30:54] Joey Krug: kind of product market fit, you know, I will invest,
[00:30:59] Joey Krug: was basically what I said.
[00:31:00] Joey Krug: And I was like, you know, prediction markets
[00:31:02] Joey Krug: is probably like the hardest idea to build
[00:31:04] Joey Krug: because so many people have tried it.
[00:31:06] Joey Krug: It's so like intellectually interesting.
[00:31:09] Joey Krug: Everyone wants it to exist, you know,
[00:31:11] Joey Krug: but it's still just really, really tough.
[00:31:13] Joey Krug: I guess it's probably the hardest digital idea,
[00:31:14] Joey Krug: like, like, usually it's probably the real world,
[00:31:17] Joey Krug: you know, thing that's harder.
[00:31:18] Joey Krug: But that's sort of what I said.
[00:31:20] Joey Krug: And then, you know, I kind of gave him a benchmark
[00:31:22] Joey Krug: where I was like, you know, if you get to like
[00:31:24] Joey Krug: four or five million dollars in volume a week
[00:31:27] Joey Krug: and it's sort of repeatable,
[00:31:28] Joey Krug: that seems like real enough to me that I would,
[00:31:31] Joey Krug: I would take a bet on it.
[00:31:32] Joey Krug: And then he called me, you know, late 2023
[00:31:34] Joey Krug: and said, hey, we hit the number.
[00:31:36] Joey Krug: Do you want to do on an invest?
[00:31:38] Joey Krug: And I said, you know, let's talk about it.
[00:31:41] Joey Krug: And it's also looped Napoleon and because he's also interested
[00:31:45] Joey Krug: in prediction markets and betting.
[00:31:48] Joey Krug: And we ended up, you know, agreeing to invest
[00:31:51] Joey Krug: pretty quickly.
[00:31:52] Joey Krug: And so that's sort of how it started.
[00:31:54] Mario: That's amazing.
[00:31:55] Mario: It is, it's funny.
[00:31:56] Mario: You mentioned the Napster Spotify example,
[00:31:59] Mario: but it really has that echo even from, you know,
[00:32:01] Mario: the connection to Founders Fund, right?
[00:32:03] Mario: Obviously Sean Parker, you know,
[00:32:05] Mario: goes to Founders Fund and finds Spotify
[00:32:08] Mario: after, you know, founding Napster.
[00:32:10] Mario: So there's a fun symmetry there.
[00:32:12] Mario: Had you looked at a bunch of these other
[00:32:15] Mario: prediction markets sort of along the way
[00:32:17] Mario: and considered investing in them.
[00:32:19] Mario: Like, was it really just, hey,
[00:32:21] Mario: this is the one that seems to be breaking out.
[00:32:23] Mario: And so, you know, this is the one to bet on.
[00:32:26] Yeah, I looked at ones over the years
[00:32:28] Joey Krug: because given the auger history, you know,
[00:32:30] Joey Krug: I'm kind of one of the first people that people think
[00:32:33] Joey Krug: to pitch, you know, when it comes to prediction markets.
[00:32:37] Joey Krug: But not really had the right, you know,
[00:32:39] Joey Krug: kind of like founder market fit that probably market had.
[00:32:42] Joey Krug: And then I think the other thing
[00:32:45] Joey Krug: that I really liked about Polymarket relative to,
[00:32:48] Joey Krug: you know, anyone else I ever talked to was sort of that,
[00:32:51] Joey Krug: the crazy kind of role at this focus on like the UI UX
[00:32:55] Joey Krug: and the user and like why Shane is building it
[00:33:00] Joey Krug: and those sorts of like founder reasons
[00:33:02] Joey Krug: that are relevant to why Founders Fund likes to invest
[00:33:05] Joey Krug: in stuff.
[00:33:05] Joey Krug: I think it was very clearly.
[00:33:06] Joey Krug: I think even in the memo we sent out
[00:33:09] Joey Krug: about Polymarket to the rest of the Founders Fund team,
[00:33:12] Joey Krug: I think there was a line there that was something like,
[00:33:14] Joey Krug: you know, if anybody can do it, it's this team.
[00:33:18] Joey Krug: If they don't do it, it's probably not going to work
[00:33:20] Joey Krug: for another five, 10 years was sort of the,
[00:33:22] Joey Krug: the Ralph mental model.
[00:33:24] Mario: What were the sort of founder market fit pieces
[00:33:27] Mario: that really spiked in terms of Shane
[00:33:29] Mario: and when you looked at the team that made you think,
[00:33:32] Mario: okay, this is, this is the folks that if anyone's going
[00:33:34] Mario: to do it, it's going to be these guys.
[00:33:36] Mario: I think the way I describe it is like,
[00:33:39] Joey Krug: if you look at, if you look at Shane,
[00:33:41] Joey Krug: he's basically super, super obsessed about just like,
[00:33:44] Joey Krug: they're being more efficient markets
[00:33:45] Joey Krug: and they're being a way to basically get data
[00:33:49] Joey Krug: about kind of anything in the real world
[00:33:50] Joey Krug: that people care about.
[00:33:52] Joey Krug: You know, I think one of the kind of frequently used lines
[00:33:55] Joey Krug: is like, if it's on the front page of the New York Times,
[00:33:56] Joey Krug: like there should probably be a probability on it
[00:33:59] Joey Krug: for how real it is and probably markets
[00:34:01] Joey Krug: the best place to go to get that.
[00:34:02] Joey Krug: The other like founder thing is this sort of,
[00:34:05] Joey Krug: extremely strong perseverance and relentlessness.
[00:34:08] Joey Krug: You know, he did take the legal risks that we did it
[00:34:12] Joey Krug: and there was kind of the first CFTC settlement
[00:34:15] Joey Krug: and then after buying loss, there was the FBI raid
[00:34:20] Joey Krug: and I think a lot of people like reasonably probably
[00:34:24] Joey Krug: would have just folded and not wanted to take on
[00:34:29] Joey Krug: the extreme risk, but he sort of had this extremely
[00:34:34] Joey Krug: high conviction that this needed to exist.
[00:34:37] Joey Krug: It was right, you know, the government was wrong
[00:34:41] Joey Krug: to be going after them and that he wanted to build it anyway.
[00:34:45] Joey Krug: And I think that that is just sort of,
[00:34:49] Joey Krug: it's impossible to fake and then it's also really good
[00:34:52] Joey Krug: for rallying people like around you to your cause.
[00:34:55] Joey Krug: And if you think about like what's important
[00:34:57] Joey Krug: for a founder to be able to do, it's able to have a clear
[00:35:00] Joey Krug: compelling vision and then get other people to support that
[00:35:03] Joey Krug: whether that's, you know, investors, people on the team,
[00:35:06] Joey Krug: partners of the business and, you know, I think
[00:35:09] Joey Krug: he really spiked on all those things.
[00:35:12] Joey Krug: And then the second piece that I kind of alluded to earlier
[00:35:14] Joey Krug: is just like this really high obsession about product
[00:35:18] Joey Krug: and having like wanted to have the product for himself,
[00:35:21] Joey Krug: you know, sort of sort of thing, I think is really,
[00:35:24] Joey Krug: is really a big part of that as well.
[00:35:26] Mario: You mentioned sort of the interest of the CFTC
[00:35:29] Mario: and the FBI raid for folks that, you know,
[00:35:31] Mario: maybe didn't chart that story.
[00:35:33] Mario: What was sort of the, the pricey of what happened
[00:35:36] Mario: and how he was, you know, able to sort of manage that process.
[00:35:39] Mario: So the short story of it is basically, you know,
[00:35:43] Joey Krug: the first version of Polymarket, it's completely global.
[00:35:47] Joey Krug: Based on smart contracts, I didn't block USIPs or anything.
[00:35:52] Joey Krug: It goes under the Biden emin, they had to settle
[00:35:54] Joey Krug: to CFTC and basically block USIPs for very obscure reasons.
[00:35:59] Joey Krug: The US government says that prediction markets are swaps.
[00:36:03] Joey Krug: And there's kind of a great Matt looking piece
[00:36:06] Joey Krug: which is like everything as a swap.
[00:36:08] Joey Krug: That if you Google that, it's kind of interesting to read.
[00:36:10] Joey Krug: And then if you fast forward, you know, it's like 22-ish,
[00:36:13] Joey Krug: something like that.
[00:36:14] Joey Krug: And then it's 2022-ish.
[00:36:15] Joey Krug: And then if you fast forward right after, you know,
[00:36:18] Joey Krug: Polymarket predicted the Trump election win
[00:36:21] Joey Krug: and Biden lost roughly a few days, maybe a week,
[00:36:26] Joey Krug: after the election, you know, the FBI raided Shane's part
[00:36:29] Joey Krug: and took all his electronics and phone and everything.
[00:36:32] Joey Krug: It's kind of sort of unclear exactly what,
[00:36:35] Joey Krug: the thing they're trying to get at or go after was,
[00:36:38] Joey Krug: I don't like it after really kind of fully yod explained.
[00:36:42] Joey Krug: But and eventually ended up getting, you know,
[00:36:46] Joey Krug: basically dropped, you know, earlier this year.
[00:36:49] Joey Krug: But that's sort of what I was referring to as, you know,
[00:36:52] Joey Krug: they burst into his apartment at like 8 a.m. or whatever.
[00:36:54] Joey Krug: And, you know, took all his stuff and he didn't give up,
[00:37:01] Joey Krug: like I spoke to him, you know, like at the AR-2 after
[00:37:04] Joey Krug: and he seemed as good as spirits as usual,
[00:37:10] Joey Krug: which is just crazy, crazy, impressive.
[00:37:13] Joey Krug: And yeah, it's hard.
[00:37:15] Joey Krug: It's like I would be pretty sad if the FBI raided me.
[00:37:18] Joey Krug: To maintain your focus.
[00:37:20] Joey Krug: Yeah.
[00:37:21] Joey Krug: But, you know, he stayed focused and on track.
[00:37:24] Joey Krug: And, you know, they, I think they just did more,
[00:37:27] Joey Krug: more volume than the election month, you know, last month.
[00:37:30] Joey Krug: So it's crazy where, you know, again, another,
[00:37:35] Joey Krug: another situation where like, you see,
[00:37:37] Joey Krug: look at what the pie market's done over the last year.
[00:37:39] Joey Krug: You think for a majority of that, you know,
[00:37:41] Joey Krug: they were again, fighting with one hand behind their back
[00:37:44] Joey Krug: because the government was incorrectly trying to go after them.
[00:37:47] Joey Krug: Now that they're not, you know, imagine what they'll do
[00:37:49] Joey Krug: with like 100% full focus, this sort of,
[00:37:52] Joey Krug: how I think about it.
[00:37:54] Mario: Yeah, I mean, also just from, you know,
[00:37:55] Mario: the perspective of your investment,
[00:37:57] Mario: it feels like it was astonishingly well timed
[00:38:00] Mario: and that you, you know, guys first invested ahead of the election cycle.
[00:38:05] Mario: And I think there were, you know,
[00:38:06] Mario: probably a lot of folks that were questioning, you know,
[00:38:10] Mario: okay, maybe it works during an election period,
[00:38:12] Mario: but it's going to cool off and, you know,
[00:38:14] Mario: this is going to crater to, I don't know,
[00:38:16] Mario: 5% volume, 1% volume, you know,
[00:38:18] Mario: however bearish I suppose you want to be.
[00:38:20] Mario: And, you know, while there obviously has been a correction,
[00:38:23] it seemed that there has been still this sort of
[00:38:26] Mario: growing variety of use cases and sort of a higher base,
[00:38:31] Mario: you know, naturally there are these spikes.
[00:38:32] Mario: But was that something that you felt confident about at the time
[00:38:36] Mario: that you were making your better?
[00:38:38] Mario: Was that sort of one of the pieces that felt like an unknown even to you?
[00:38:42] Mario: The way I think about this stuff is always like,
[00:38:44] Joey Krug: what's the market pricing versus what are we pricing, right?
[00:38:48] Joey Krug: And I think, you know, in this case,
[00:38:51] Joey Krug: the way I thought about it was like,
[00:38:53] Joey Krug: the market was pricing that there'd be like a 90% decrease in volume.
[00:38:56] Joey Krug: You know, that was, she scored Twitter,
[00:38:58] Joey Krug: that was the common sentiment.
[00:38:59] Joey Krug: We thought that was wrong.
[00:39:00] Joey Krug: You know, our view is sort of that like,
[00:39:02] Joey Krug: or at least my view is sort of that,
[00:39:04] Joey Krug: you know, maybe there'd be like a 50% decrease
[00:39:06] Joey Krug: and then it would kind of take a while to rebound.
[00:39:08] Joey Krug: But there wouldn't be this like 90% drop.
[00:39:12] Joey Krug: And the reason behind that was like,
[00:39:13] Joey Krug: if you looked, you know,
[00:39:15] Joey Krug: probably markets volume,
[00:39:16] Joey Krug: I think the percentage was like 50,
[00:39:18] Joey Krug: maybe 60% elections, like there was still this chunk
[00:39:21] Joey Krug: that was not elections.
[00:39:23] Joey Krug: And so to think it would drop a ton,
[00:39:25] Joey Krug: you had to believe that all the users that came in
[00:39:28] Joey Krug: for the election would just leave and not trade anything else.
[00:39:31] Joey Krug: But that wasn't really what it looked like
[00:39:33] Joey Krug: from, you know, the underlying data,
[00:39:34] Joey Krug: which is all on chain and you can, you know, verify it.
[00:39:38] Joey Krug: And so, you know, I think it's probably,
[00:39:41] Joey Krug: the volumes have performed probably better than,
[00:39:44] Joey Krug: we thought they would have a year ago.
[00:39:46] Joey Krug: But, you know, we sort of priced in them doing better
[00:39:50] Joey Krug: than the market did.
[00:39:51] Joey Krug: And so I think it's like, we think about edges and investor,
[00:39:53] Joey Krug: you don't have to protect everything 100% precisely.
[00:39:56] Joey Krug: You just have to, you know,
[00:39:57] Joey Krug: the delta between you and the market
[00:39:59] Joey Krug: thanks just has to be wide enough to be right.
[00:40:01] Joey Krug: When I sort of looked at some of the data over the past year,
[00:40:03] Mario: it's clear that, you know,
[00:40:05] Mario: polymarket has seen the most volume
[00:40:07] Mario: of any of the prediction markets.
[00:40:09] Mario: But that it is sort of, you know,
[00:40:11] Mario: I don't know if you would say it's closing
[00:40:12] Mario: or it's quite close with CalShi in particular.
[00:40:15] Mario: When you look at sort of the way this space shakes out,
[00:40:21] Mario: how do you, yeah, how do you see it progressing?
[00:40:23] Mario: Is this a winner takes all space
[00:40:25] Mario: or, you know, certain parts of it sort of cordoned off
[00:40:28] Mario: to in a winner takes all dynamic?
[00:40:31] Joey Krug: If you look at financial markets in general,
[00:40:33] Joey Krug: historically anyways, they tend to be, you know,
[00:40:36] Joey Krug: basically do opales.
[00:40:38] Joey Krug: So, you have Coinbase and Binance.
[00:40:40] Joey Krug: You have, you know,
[00:40:43] Joey Krug: you know, CME and CBOE,
[00:40:44] Joey Krug: you have New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.
[00:40:48] Joey Krug: It's that's one lens.
[00:40:49] Joey Krug: Like maybe there's a dual ophthalm thing.
[00:40:51] Joey Krug: Why do you think that is out of curiosity?
[00:40:53] Joey Krug: I think it depends on each,
[00:40:54] Joey Krug: like if you look at the Binance and Coinbase one,
[00:40:56] Joey Krug: that's a clear split of just like international
[00:40:58] Joey Krug: versus you know, predominantly Western US markets.
[00:41:02] Joey Krug: If you look at,
[00:41:04] if you look at the like options in futures markets,
[00:41:07] Joey Krug: like CME, CBOE, I think that one was probably more
[00:41:10] Joey Krug: of like a product type split.
[00:41:13] Joey Krug: In the fact that they just been around for so long
[00:41:15] Joey Krug: that it's sort of naturally developed
[00:41:17] Joey Krug: where there's one place to trade grain futures,
[00:41:19] Joey Krug: another one where you predominantly trade oil futures,
[00:41:21] Joey Krug: you know, so on and so forth.
[00:41:22] Joey Krug: And the liquidity kind of concentrated.
[00:41:26] Joey Krug: I don't have a good explanation
[00:41:27] Joey Krug: for New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.
[00:41:29] Joey Krug: Then I'm sure there is one.
[00:41:30] Joey Krug: I just haven't looked into that too much.
[00:41:32] Joey Krug: If you tied this back to like probably market
[00:41:34] Joey Krug: and Cal if you get other people trying to compete,
[00:41:37] Joey Krug: I think, you know, the US versus international lens,
[00:41:41] Joey Krug: I think you know, probably markets
[00:41:42] Joey Krug: that the clear winner internationally,
[00:41:44] Joey Krug: and then they're about to launch in the US.
[00:41:48] Joey Krug: I guess, and then comes with market categories.
[00:41:50] Joey Krug: You know, if you look at again, you know,
[00:41:53] Joey Krug: probably markets roughly,
[00:41:54] Joey Krug: bank sports is like 40 something percent.
[00:41:57] Joey Krug: And the rest is other things.
[00:41:58] Joey Krug: Cal, she's like 90% sports,
[00:42:00] Joey Krug: which is another interesting lens.
[00:42:02] Joey Krug: But I guess to more roughly answer the question,
[00:42:05] Joey Krug: I do think it'll end up being a bit more
[00:42:08] Joey Krug: of a lot of side to do all of these
[00:42:09] Joey Krug: and then the other Stock Exchange is like,
[00:42:12] Joey Krug: I'm not the models closer to, you know, Uber versus Lyft,
[00:42:16] Joey Krug: than, you know, Nizy versus NASDAQ.
[00:42:19] Joey Krug: There's a bunch of different like vectors upon which
[00:42:21] Joey Krug: the competition will be fought.
[00:42:22] Joey Krug: But I think when it comes to like product,
[00:42:27] Joey Krug: I'm pretty bullish on probably market,
[00:42:30] Joey Krug: being able to ship like the best consumer product,
[00:42:32] Joey Krug: which I think is where most value capture
[00:42:35] Joey Krug: will end up kind of long run here.
[00:42:38] Mario: You mentioned that this, you know, Shane has maybe
[00:42:41] Mario: this product sensibility and this sense of what the UX should be
[00:42:44] Mario: back to even, you know, emailing you at augur and saying,
[00:42:47] Mario: here's what you should be doing.
[00:42:49] Mario: When you, when you look at it today,
[00:42:50] Mario: what are the pieces of the polymarket product that you think,
[00:42:54] Mario: hey, it's actually really important that this thing that,
[00:42:56] Mario: you know, maybe doesn't look that significant
[00:42:58] Mario: is done in XYZ way or is represented this way.
[00:43:03] Joey Krug: I think for the non-US product,
[00:43:06] Joey Krug: I think part of it is like,
[00:43:08] Joey Krug: I do think crypto is like the ideal market structure
[00:43:11] Joey Krug: or something like this where if you're having to,
[00:43:15] Joey Krug: say, have like a decentralized system,
[00:43:18] Joey Krug: you know, you can look at like UNISWAP as an example.
[00:43:20] Joey Krug: If UNISWAP was instead a centralized exchange where,
[00:43:24] Joey Krug: you know, they had to KYC people from like 150 countries.
[00:43:27] Joey Krug: Yeah.
[00:43:28] Joey Krug: I think the liquidity pool would just be a lot,
[00:43:30] Joey Krug: a lot less deep.
[00:43:31] Joey Krug: Another interesting factor on the product side is,
[00:43:35] Joey Krug: you look at kind of the different players in this space.
[00:43:38] Joey Krug: There's sort of a split, I think,
[00:43:42] Joey Krug: in terms of like, do you view production markets
[00:43:45] Joey Krug: as a betting exchange,
[00:43:49] Joey Krug: like in like the sense that like bet there is a betting exchange?
[00:43:53] Joey Krug: Or do you view them as like a financial exchange?
[00:43:56] Joey Krug: And a lot of people would probably like
[00:43:59] Joey Krug: mean that sentence on Twitter and say,
[00:44:01] Joey Krug: you know, it's just sports betting or whatever.
[00:44:03] Joey Krug: But to concretize it and make it something that's actually like
[00:44:07] Joey Krug: something that you can discuss and it's not just qualitative,
[00:44:10] Joey Krug: if you look at that fair, you know,
[00:44:11] Joey Krug: they take 50% of the winnings of the market makers
[00:44:13] Joey Krug: on the platform, 50% of their profits.
[00:44:17] Joey Krug: If you look at some of the other players
[00:44:18] Joey Krug: in the production market space, you know, like,
[00:44:21] Joey Krug: the fees are quite high and you're talking multiple percent.
[00:44:24] Joey Krug: If you look at most financial exchanges,
[00:44:26] Joey Krug: the fees are very low, you know, we're talking basis points.
[00:44:29] Joey Krug: And so one lens is like,
[00:44:32] Joey Krug: do you view this as an actually,
[00:44:34] Joey Krug: as actually as an exchange?
[00:44:35] Joey Krug: Yes.
[00:44:36] Joey Krug: Or do you in the financial market sense
[00:44:37] Joey Krug: or do you view it more as like betting?
[00:44:40] Joey Krug: And I think, you know, the probably market ethos
[00:44:42] Joey Krug: is closer to the financial market exchange.
[00:44:45] Joey Krug: And I think as a result,
[00:44:46] Joey Krug: especially once they launched in the US,
[00:44:48] Joey Krug: I think the volumes are just gonna skyrocket
[00:44:52] Joey Krug: because it will be like the most efficient,
[00:44:53] Joey Krug: most liquid place to trade.
[00:44:57] Joey Krug: I think that's one ethos difference.
[00:44:59] Joey Krug: And then I think, I probably can't talk about the US product,
[00:45:02] Joey Krug: but it should launch, you know, hope,
[00:45:04] Joey Krug: maybe by the time this is, this podcast is out,
[00:45:06] Joey Krug: you know, in a few weeks.
[00:45:06] Joey Krug: And I think the user experience when that's just so,
[00:45:10] Joey Krug: so much slicker than anything else
[00:45:12] Joey Krug: that I've seen in the space.
[00:45:14] Joey Krug: Like it's something where, you know, once it's out,
[00:45:17] Joey Krug: I look very forward, much, much, very forward to using it myself,
[00:45:22] Joey Krug: probably multiple times a week.
[00:45:24] Joey Krug: I think it'll be really, really cool.
[00:45:25] Joey Krug: One of the, you know, things that has,
[00:45:29] Mario: has maybe been tricky for some of these,
[00:45:32] Mario: these markets and Pauli market has had issues with this
[00:45:34] Mario: in the past is like how you manage resolution.
[00:45:37] Mario: And sometimes you think these things will be straightforward
[00:45:40] Mario: and they end up being more complicated
[00:45:42] Mario: than you might ordinarily imagine,
[00:45:44] Mario: you know, the example that I think comes to mind most
[00:45:46] Mario: is the, you know, is Zelensky wearing a suit at XYZ event.
[00:45:50] Mario: And he sort of is, he sort of isn't.
[00:45:53] Mario: And, you know, that's when they start to be these questions
[00:45:55] Mario: about, you know, how manipulatable are these different markets,
[00:46:00] Mario: et cetera, et cetera.
[00:46:01] Mario: How do you sort of like get comfortable with the constraints
[00:46:05] Mario: and the different trade-offs that, you know,
[00:46:08] Mario: these companies make and particularly the ones
[00:46:11] Mario: that Pauli market makes?
[00:46:13] Yeah.
[00:46:14] I mean, I think this is a problem
[00:46:17] Joey Krug: that I thought a crazy amount, probably too much about,
[00:46:20] Joey Krug: you know, when I was building auger, you know,
[00:46:22] Joey Krug: we spent all this time on the resolution system.
[00:46:25] Joey Krug: And I think in terms of outcomes, it worked pretty well,
[00:46:28] Joey Krug: but in terms of speed, it was just, you know,
[00:46:30] Joey Krug: horrendously slow.
[00:46:32] Joey Krug: And so that was wrong trade-off.
[00:46:36] Joey Krug: I think if you look at kind of the state of things today,
[00:46:39] Joey Krug: yeah, I think one lens is that you know,
[00:46:42] Joey Krug: nobody has as perfect even the big sports books
[00:46:45] Joey Krug: sometimes according to the betters, you know,
[00:46:47] Joey Krug: will pay it, pay things out wrong.
[00:46:48] Joey Krug: It's a problem for the industry writ writ large.
[00:46:53] Joey Krug: I think the suit, the suit thing, you know, is one word.
[00:46:56] Joey Krug: There's an incentive for, you know, competitors
[00:46:58] Joey Krug: to create, you know, fun around those stuff.
[00:47:00] Joey Krug: Like if you read the, if you read what the actual designer
[00:47:04] Joey Krug: posted, you know, he says that it was like
[00:47:08] Joey Krug: cut from separate fabric, which according to some of my friends
[00:47:11] Joey Krug: and sort of the fashion space, that means it's not a suit.
[00:47:15] Joey Krug: But ignoring, ignoring like the specifics of that market,
[00:47:19] Joey Krug: I think it is a kind of staying that needs to be addressed
[00:47:22] Joey Krug: for it large.
[00:47:23] Joey Krug: I think the best way that I can think of to addressing this
[00:47:26] Joey Krug: is probably actually to utilize like AI
[00:47:28] Joey Krug: in terms of like writing the market descriptions.
[00:47:31] Joey Krug: You know, I think, I think maybe doing this
[00:47:34] Joey Krug: to some extent already, but I think the companies
[00:47:36] Joey Krug: in the space should basically provide like their draft,
[00:47:40] Joey Krug: you know, description to like, you know,
[00:47:42] Joey Krug: GPT-5 Pro or whatever.
[00:47:44] Joey Krug: And have it analyze it like a really, you know,
[00:47:48] Joey Krug: it key, you know, lawyer would,
[00:47:51] Joey Krug: and just try to cover as many edge cases as possible.
[00:47:55] Joey Krug: The one caveat is that you still want,
[00:47:56] Joey Krug: like you want to cover all the edge cases,
[00:47:58] Joey Krug: but you also want to hue to like,
[00:48:00] Joey Krug: what is the common sense person's understanding of what happened?
[00:48:04] Joey Krug: You also want to cover edge cases of like, you know,
[00:48:08] Joey Krug: I think like technically there's,
[00:48:10] Joey Krug: there's some types of like pajamas that are very technically
[00:48:13] Joey Krug: or a suit because they're cut from the same cloth, right?
[00:48:15] Joey Krug: Like you don't want it to be a wear of pajamas
[00:48:17] Joey Krug: and then be like, oh yeah, it was a suit, you know,
[00:48:20] Joey Krug: and so there's a lot of these edge cases,
[00:48:22] Joey Krug: but I think this is probably one of the things in the space,
[00:48:26] Joey Krug: like AI probably is actually uniquely suited at helping with.
[00:48:30] Joey Krug: Really interesting.
[00:48:31] Mario: Okay, well, I'd like to maybe move on to one other part of,
[00:48:35] Mario: you know, the crypto landscape that I know you've been involved in
[00:48:38] Mario: and that I think feels like a big part of the market today,
[00:48:41] Mario: which is really the sort of emergence of crypto treasury companies.
[00:48:47] Mario: I feel like that's been, you know,
[00:48:49] Mario: something that has really gathered a ton of steam
[00:48:52] Mario: over the past 18 months and Founders Fund is involved
[00:48:56] Mario: with one of the sort of front running
[00:48:59] Mario: East treasury companies.
[00:49:00] Mario: How did you first get involved with Bitcoin?
[00:49:03] Yeah, you had, you know, East position,
[00:49:05] Joey Krug: then, you know, bullish on East for a while,
[00:49:08] Joey Krug: it's sort of been a tough cycle for East,
[00:49:10] Joey Krug: but when we came across BitMine,
[00:49:14] Joey Krug: you know, that was sort of kind of two or three
[00:49:18] Joey Krug: things kind of converging at once.
[00:49:20] Joey Krug: Once was that this sort of, you know,
[00:49:22] Joey Krug: treasury narrative thing had started to happen.
[00:49:24] Joey Krug: Two was that we knew one of the kind of creators of it
[00:49:29] Joey Krug: is this guy Shen from this fund called Mosakes
[00:49:32] Joey Krug: and he was actually, you know,
[00:49:34] Joey Krug: found one of the founders of Workrise,
[00:49:36] Joey Krug: which is one of our portfolio companies.
[00:49:38] Joey Krug: So we knew him, there was some level of trust there.
[00:49:41] Joey Krug: And then, Tom Lee, I'd known a bit, you know,
[00:49:43] Joey Krug: off and on over the years or passed across a little bit.
[00:49:47] Joey Krug: And if you look at what these vehicles do, you know,
[00:49:51] Joey Krug: in my mind, it's basically they are a way to, you know,
[00:49:56] Joey Krug: accumulate an asset,
[00:49:58] Joey Krug: popularize by Michael Saylor with MicroStrategy.
[00:50:01] Joey Krug: In this case, it was, you know, with ETH,
[00:50:03] Joey Krug: BitMine sort of launched at a time when ETH was pretty,
[00:50:06] Joey Krug: you know, in my opinion, oversold like it was like the low 2K
[00:50:09] Joey Krug: range, they had kind of a combination of two things that I think
[00:50:12] Joey Krug: is really important to make this work.
[00:50:14] Joey Krug: One is like the capital markets expertise with Shen,
[00:50:17] Joey Krug: Mosakes is a hedge fund, he ended up starting to hedge fund.
[00:50:20] Joey Krug: And then Tom Lee also with the capital markets expertise,
[00:50:23] Joey Krug: but also like the branding and marketing and awareness
[00:50:27] Joey Krug: building that he's really good at.
[00:50:28] Joey Krug: That combination of things is why we decided to invest.
[00:50:31] Joey Krug: And I think that the ETH ones have some kind of interesting
[00:50:35] Joey Krug: elements to them that I think make sense for them to trade it.
[00:50:38] Joey Krug: Not a crazy premium, but still maybe a slight premium,
[00:50:41] Joey Krug: which is like, if you look at ETH staking,
[00:50:44] Joey Krug: the ETFs, since they can be mentioned and redeemed,
[00:50:47] Joey Krug: won't be able to stake 100% of their ETH
[00:50:49] Joey Krug: even when the SEC approves it.
[00:50:50] Joey Krug: And so if you have a capital structure where the corporation
[00:50:53] Joey Krug: to basically stake the ETH,
[00:50:55] Joey Krug: one, you can stake 100% of the ETH,
[00:50:57] Joey Krug: and then two, the other interesting dynamic is that you basically
[00:51:01] Joey Krug: get, you know, capital gains treatment
[00:51:03] Joey Krug: because the company is the one paying the tax on the stake
[00:51:08] Joey Krug: versus it being directly income to you as a shareholder,
[00:51:13] Joey Krug: which is like somewhat interesting.
[00:51:15] Joey Krug: And I think there probably be some demand for that
[00:51:16] Joey Krug: from capital markets.
[00:51:18] Joey Krug: Those are kind of like the longer term reasons why it's interesting.
[00:51:21] Joey Krug: And then the more shorter term, like why be invested
[00:51:23] Joey Krug: or kind of tied to the people, like almost, you know,
[00:51:26] Joey Krug: anything else we do, that's sort of where it starts.
[00:51:28] Joey Krug: You know, that's such an interesting point
[00:51:31] Mario: on the sort of difference between an ETH treasury company
[00:51:35] Mario: and a Bitcoin treasury company.
[00:51:37] Mario: There are these sort of quirks to it.
[00:51:40] Mario: For folks that maybe haven't really followed this
[00:51:42] Mario: as a trend in the crypto markets.
[00:51:45] Mario: Like what is the value of someone, at least in theory,
[00:51:49] Mario: investing in micro strategy, which, you know,
[00:51:51] Mario: is a Bitcoin treasury company versus an ETF
[00:51:54] Mario: versus the underlying asset?
[00:51:56] Let's start with, you know, the underlying first,
[00:51:58] Joey Krug: the underlying, you know, benefits of that
[00:52:00] Joey Krug: are it's created 24, seven.
[00:52:04] Joey Krug: You can just set it to any exchange that you have an account with.
[00:52:07] Joey Krug: And you can, you can trade it there.
[00:52:08] Joey Krug: You know, it's self custodial.
[00:52:10] Joey Krug: If you're, if you're really, really libertarian
[00:52:13] Joey Krug: and you know, think that the government's kind of
[00:52:15] Joey Krug: sees your Bitcoin or something, I don't, I don't think that.
[00:52:17] Joey Krug: But, you know, if you were paranoid about that,
[00:52:19] Joey Krug: you know, purely self custodial spot is a good way to go.
[00:52:24] Joey Krug: And there are people who live in countries
[00:52:26] Joey Krug: where like that is actually a valid concern, right?
[00:52:29] Joey Krug: And then if you go kind of, you know,
[00:52:31] Joey Krug: one step up, you have the ETS, for the ETF,
[00:52:34] Joey Krug: I think the benefit there is just convenience.
[00:52:37] Joey Krug: Like if you buy, you know, a Bitcoin or ETF
[00:52:40] Joey Krug: and your interactive brokers account,
[00:52:42] Joey Krug: even if your computer gets hacked or whatever,
[00:52:44] Joey Krug: like you kind of have the legacy financial rails
[00:52:46] Joey Krug: to protect you there, like, you know,
[00:52:49] Joey Krug: it's not like you're gonna wake up one day
[00:52:50] Joey Krug: and all your ether Bitcoin is stolen.
[00:52:55] And then, and then I think when it comes to the treasury companies,
[00:52:59] Joey Krug: these are sort of more like a higher beta
[00:53:01] Joey Krug: kind of supercharged version of the underlying asset
[00:53:04] Joey Krug: where they own, you know, ether Bitcoin.
[00:53:07] Joey Krug: There's sort of a couple of reasons why one might be willing
[00:53:10] Joey Krug: to pay, you know, a premium for that.
[00:53:13] Joey Krug: Think about a company like, you know, Apple
[00:53:15] Joey Krug: or Tesla or Facebook.
[00:53:16] Joey Krug: There's like debt for it that you can trade.
[00:53:18] Joey Krug: You see some exposure to it, it's higher yields
[00:53:20] Joey Krug: and like, treasuries, but you don't really have the same downsides
[00:53:23] Joey Krug: you have as investing in, you know, underlying meta stock
[00:53:27] Joey Krug: as an example.
[00:53:28] Joey Krug: For, you know, Bitcoin and Ethereum,
[00:53:31] Joey Krug: prior to Sailor, that didn't really exist.
[00:53:34] Joey Krug: And so he basically created this way
[00:53:36] Joey Krug: if people buy, you know, convertible bonds
[00:53:38] Joey Krug: where it's collateralized by Bitcoin,
[00:53:40] Joey Krug: there's some sort of capital stack.
[00:53:42] Joey Krug: They get, you know, some amount of upside Bitcoin does well
[00:53:46] Joey Krug: that they're able to invest out of, you know,
[00:53:48] Joey Krug: via debt structure and it's lower downside.
[00:53:53] Joey Krug: And there are people who want to invest in that
[00:53:55] Joey Krug: or who can only invest in those sorts of vehicles
[00:53:57] Joey Krug: that do want exposure to crypto.
[00:53:58] Joey Krug: They can't buy the underlying.
[00:53:59] Joey Krug: So there's like this interesting financial instrument
[00:54:01] Joey Krug: that he created as a result that has some value.
[00:54:04] Joey Krug: And then you can debate around the margins like,
[00:54:06] Joey Krug: you know, what is the premium of buying
[00:54:07] Joey Krug: Micro-Traditional Stock that it's worth
[00:54:09] Joey Krug: in exchange for him providing that service?
[00:54:11] Joey Krug: You know, and I think like my idea is that the answer isn't zero.
[00:54:15] Joey Krug: Probably not three acts either.
[00:54:17] Joey Krug: You know, it's, it's, but I think that's sort of the notion
[00:54:21] Joey Krug: of why you would buy it because he's basically selling this service
[00:54:25] Joey Krug: and as an equity holder, you know,
[00:54:27] Joey Krug: you're basically getting the monetization of that service
[00:54:30] Joey Krug: or the benefits of it sort of the high level way
[00:54:32] Joey Krug: that I would think about it.
[00:54:34] And the fact that we're now seeing, you know,
[00:54:37] Mario: East Treasury companies, Salana Treasury companies,
[00:54:40] Mario: you know, other ones coming up the pike,
[00:54:42] Mario: like do you see that as, I don't know,
[00:54:45] Mario: simply mimetic behavior?
[00:54:47] Mario: Is it telling us something about the maturation
[00:54:50] Mario: of this market and the players in it?
[00:54:52] Mario: How do you think it changes the structure of this market?
[00:54:56] Yeah, I mean, it's definitely mimetic.
[00:54:58] Joey Krug: Like we've, Napoleon and Peter, I've talked about that
[00:55:01] Joey Krug: to some degree as well.
[00:55:02] Joey Krug: Like there's, in some ways, I'm like,
[00:55:03] Mario: this is, you guys must have had an alarm bell going off
[00:55:06] Mario: in making this investment because there is such a mimetic quality,
[00:55:09] Mario: in a way.
[00:55:10] Joey Krug: Right.
[00:55:11] Joey Krug: Yeah, so there's some mimetic element to it,
[00:55:13] Joey Krug: which I think like, you know, if you think about financial markets,
[00:55:15] Joey Krug: if you're, if you're early to a mimetic phenomenon,
[00:55:18] Joey Krug: that's good, that's kind of the classic sorrows argument,
[00:55:21] Joey Krug: if you're late to it, it's bad.
[00:55:22] Joey Krug: One thing that people kind of overcomplicate,
[00:55:25] Joey Krug: it's like you sometimes, especially last year,
[00:55:27] Joey Krug: you see on Twitter, all you see we'll talking about,
[00:55:29] Joey Krug: you know, oh, Michael Saler is buying all the Bitcoin,
[00:55:31] Joey Krug: you know, there's, there's not any real demand.
[00:55:34] Joey Krug: And it's like, well, if you zoom out,
[00:55:35] Joey Krug: one layer more, it's trash from that.
[00:55:37] Joey Krug: It's like, why is Michael Saler buying the Bitcoin?
[00:55:40] Joey Krug: It's because people are buying his stocks,
[00:55:41] Joey Krug: they want Bitcoin exposure.
[00:55:43] That's really, there's still someone who's like,
[00:55:45] Joey Krug: you know, pressing the buy button.
[00:55:47] Joey Krug: Yeah.
[00:55:48] Joey Krug: So that is then triggering that inflow.
[00:55:49] Joey Krug: It's not like, Saler is just magically, you know,
[00:55:51] Joey Krug: printing all this money, yeah.
[00:55:52] Joey Krug: But then there, even like the stock issuance,
[00:55:55] Joey Krug: he does that then buys Bitcoin, someone is buying that stock,
[00:55:58] Joey Krug: which is really, you know, in a world without Michael Saler,
[00:56:01] Joey Krug: I think that money would have eventually found its way
[00:56:03] Joey Krug: to crypto, but he's created a way for people to buy it
[00:56:06] Joey Krug: that for whatever reason, like the idea of maybe getting
[00:56:11] Joey Krug: some extra, you know, beta on this like bond trade
[00:56:13] Joey Krug: that we talked about, or maybe they just can't buy,
[00:56:16] Joey Krug: it's spot or ETS for some reason, like,
[00:56:18] Joey Krug: there are certain asset managers that can only trade
[00:56:20] Joey Krug: underline stocks, and so a hack you way to buy Bitcoin
[00:56:23] Joey Krug: is, or ETS is to just buy one of the treasury companies, right?
[00:56:26] Joey Krug: Yeah.
[00:56:27] Joey Krug: And then to answer your question about the medic,
[00:56:29] Joey Krug: or the Mimesis, you know, of other companies doing this,
[00:56:34] Joey Krug: I think it probably works less well as you go down
[00:56:36] Joey Krug: the list of assets in the same reason that like, you know,
[00:56:40] Joey Krug: a small microcaps stock can't really issue that much debt.
[00:56:46] Joey Krug: You know, it's like people want to buy Apple bonds
[00:56:49] Joey Krug: or Goldman Sach bonds, they don't really want to buy
[00:56:52] Joey Krug: like, the small mid cap.
[00:56:55] Joey Krug: Yeah.
[00:56:56] Joey Krug: Hems is maybe sufficiently large.
[00:56:57] Mario: That's not a punch on it, Hems, but just that sort of
[00:56:59] Mario: comes to mind.
[00:57:01] Mario: For yeah, like three years ago,
[00:57:02] Mario: I went and I've wanted to buy Hems bonds.
[00:57:03] Mario: Exactly.
[00:57:04] Mario: As an example, taking a step back and reminding listeners
[00:57:08] Mario: that none of this is financial advice as, you know,
[00:57:11] Mario: I'm sure they know, what is your view on the state
[00:57:15] Mario: of the crypto markets today?
[00:57:16] Mario: Like, where does it feel like we are in the cycle?
[00:57:19] Mario: There hasn't really been any sort of euphoria this cycle.
[00:57:24] Joey Krug: You know, in prior cycles, there was,
[00:57:27] Joey Krug: there's, there are points where it got super, super crazy.
[00:57:30] Joey Krug: I think maybe the craziest this cycle got was some of them,
[00:57:32] Joey Krug: some of the meme coin stuff on, on Salana.
[00:57:35] Joey Krug: But even then, that didn't get really that crazy.
[00:57:37] Joey Krug: That was, it was more of like, it was more of like a new version
[00:57:41] Joey Krug: of like batting or gambling almost because like,
[00:57:44] Joey Krug: with a small exception, there's a few that,
[00:57:45] Joey Krug: that did actually persist.
[00:57:46] Joey Krug: Most of these, you know, traded way up and then traded way down.
[00:57:49] Joey Krug: Yeah.
[00:57:50] Joey Krug: Versus in prior crypto cycles, you had assets that for years
[00:57:53] Joey Krug: traded really like way, way up.
[00:57:54] Joey Krug: Maybe that's like two and a half people got burned last cycle.
[00:57:58] Joey Krug: Maybe it's that like more money is flowing into like sports betting
[00:58:01] Joey Krug: and production markets and stuff.
[00:58:04] Joey Krug: Maybe it's just that we've kind of been through
[00:58:07] Joey Krug: like this like rolling consumer recession kind of thing
[00:58:11] Joey Krug: in the US where like the vibes are bad, like the Kylox Gamal
[00:58:14] Joey Krug: thing, like I think that's real like,
[00:58:16] Joey Krug: do you look at the,
[00:58:17] Joey Krug: when she getting consumer sentiments,
[00:58:19] Joey Krug: been kind of negative recently.
[00:58:21] Joey Krug: Maybe that's why retail hasn't come in.
[00:58:23] Joey Krug: But then I think on the flip side,
[00:58:25] Joey Krug: you know, you do have a lot more,
[00:58:26] Joey Krug: a lot more institutional inflows.
[00:58:28] Joey Krug: And you know, people that are just kind of fairly long-term
[00:58:31] Joey Krug: investors that you know buy Bitcoin Reath
[00:58:33] Joey Krug: and kind of just hold it and sit on it
[00:58:35] Joey Krug: as a small percentage of the portfolio,
[00:58:37] Joey Krug: but the portfolio is very large.
[00:58:38] Joey Krug: So it ends up making for a good amount of net inflows.
[00:58:42] Joey Krug: You know, I think you kind of combine those things.
[00:58:45] Joey Krug: It sort of feels like you look at prices today.
[00:58:49] Joey Krug: I don't know, I doesn't really feel like anything's like
[00:58:52] Joey Krug: crazy expensive or crazy undervalued.
[00:58:54] Joey Krug: It kind of just feels like we're in this like,
[00:58:56] Joey Krug: you know, into Regnum period or you know,
[00:58:59] Joey Krug: purgatory or whatever.
[00:59:00] Joey Krug: And I think I tend to be pretty bullish,
[00:59:06] Joey Krug: you know, there's a lot of fundamental catalysts coming
[00:59:08] Joey Krug: over the next couple months.
[00:59:09] Joey Krug: You have, you know, you have the next East Hard fork,
[00:59:13] Joey Krug: you know, upgrade, which I think is positive
[00:59:17] Joey Krug: because if they, if they ship it, you know,
[00:59:18] Joey Krug: that'll be two in a single year,
[00:59:20] Joey Krug: which kind of means they'll reverted
[00:59:22] Joey Krug: to a faster shipping cadence.
[00:59:24] Joey Krug: You have, you know, the Clary Act,
[00:59:26] Joey Krug: which I think will be a huge deal
[00:59:28] Joey Krug: because it basically legalizes.
[00:59:30] Joey Krug: But it's sort of, it's already legal,
[00:59:31] Joey Krug: but it makes it official that it's legal, you know,
[00:59:33] Joey Krug: the kind of overall crypto market structure
[00:59:35] Joey Krug: in the United States.
[00:59:36] Joey Krug: And then I think that'll be big for, for Connick Martin.
[00:59:39] Joey Krug: It's a lot more institutional inflows.
[00:59:41] Joey Krug: And then you have kind of some macro,
[00:59:44] Joey Krug: positivity with, you know, continued rate cuts
[00:59:46] Joey Krug: and the Fed ending, ending quantitative tightening,
[00:59:50] Joey Krug: which sort of, if you look at all,
[00:59:52] Joey Krug: they tend to really not do very well
[00:59:55] Joey Krug: when the Fed is still tightening.
[00:59:57] Joey Krug: And then you have the government shutdown,
[00:59:58] Joey Krug: which I think hopefully gets resolved
[01:00:00] Joey Krug: for the next week or two.
[01:00:01] Joey Krug: Yes.
[01:00:02] Joey Krug: And I don't really have the mechanism, why?
[01:00:04] Joey Krug: But crypto historically is underperformed
[01:00:06] Joey Krug: and government shutdowns for wherever reasons,
[01:00:08] Joey Krug: of ironic, but maybe it just goes back to the vibes thing where people are just like not
[01:00:17] Joey Krug: bullish because they just feel like stuff is broken or something.
[01:00:19] Joey Krug: I don't know.
[01:00:20] Mario: Yeah, you're not in the mood to take new risk in that way for whatever reason.
[01:00:24] Mario: Maybe I sort of remember covering this in the Founders Fund series that we published
[01:00:28] Mario: in the generalist that you guys made a pretty remarkable and prescient investment into Bitcoin
[01:00:34] Mario: and ETH primarily in sort of the summer of 2023 when I think the first buys were somewhere
[01:00:40] Mario: around like 30K for Bitcoin.
[01:00:42] Mario: And I remember hearing, I think that you guys had basically exited the Bitcoin position
[01:00:47] Mario: but were maybe still holding ETH.
[01:00:50] Mario: What is your sort of model for ETH and what needs to happen and why it's maybe still
[01:00:56] Mario: worth hanging on to given that you've maybe made a different call with Bitcoin?
[01:01:02] Mario: I think the high level logic there is basically that ETH tends to run and outperform later
[01:01:10] Joey Krug: in the cycle.
[01:01:12] Joey Krug: Often after Bitcoin has topped, you guys people sort of rotate into it.
[01:01:18] Joey Krug: And then I think that's sort of part of it.
[01:01:25] Joey Krug: And then I think part of it is that the narrative got so oversold, especially during April
[01:01:32] Joey Krug: where there's kind of the narrative that like Slana has everything in ETH just going away
[01:01:38] Joey Krug: and it was a real bummer vibe on X.
[01:01:42] Joey Krug: Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:43] Joey Krug: And the Ethereum Foundation can't ship and all this stuff.
[01:01:46] Joey Krug: And I think sort of the new leadership at the ETH seems pretty strong.
[01:01:51] Joey Krug: They do look like they're going to ship this upcoming hard fork in early December.
[01:01:55] Joey Krug: And so I think sort of holding on to the ETH is more kind of like an ETH is probably some
[01:01:59] Joey Krug: mean version and repricing that will take place.
[01:02:03] Joey Krug: Because also if you look at kind of fundamental usage, it's still the number one platform
[01:02:08] Joey Krug: for stablecoins, polymarkets on polyon and Ethereum layer 2, or investors in this other
[01:02:13] Joey Krug: company called LIDER, which is one of the top-couple perpetual decentralized exchanges.
[01:02:20] Joey Krug: They're also in Ethereum layer 2.
[01:02:22] Joey Krug: And I think they've proven that you can actually get a really smooth onboarding experience
[01:02:28] Joey Krug: as an ETH layer 2.
[01:02:29] Joey Krug: It's pretty easy to deposit and withdraw funds.
[01:02:31] Joey Krug: I do some of my own trading there now at this point.
[01:02:35] Joey Krug: And so yeah, I think sort of like kind of got way oversold and became very contrarian
[01:02:40] Joey Krug: this spring.
[01:02:41] Joey Krug: And I think there's probably some room to go on ETH this sort of by this model.
[01:02:47] Joey Krug: Alongside these catalysts, the Clarity Act where basically clarifying that DeFi is legal,
[01:02:54] Joey Krug: ETH is the number one beneficiary of that.
[01:02:56] Joey Krug: And so similar to all the media, you saw around stablecoins in the summer.
[01:03:00] Joey Krug: I hate the same thing happens around the Clarity Act whenever that passes over the next couple
[01:03:05] Joey Krug: of months.
[01:03:06] Mario: We've talked about some of these regulatory changes that have been made under the Trump
[01:03:11] Mario: administration.
[01:03:12] Mario: And how much hostility there was under the Biden administration.
[01:03:17] Mario: You shared, I think you'll have to remind me where you were on stage.
[01:03:21] Mario: Maybe it was ETH Denver talking about some of the pieces of operation choke point that
[01:03:27] Mario: you sort of got to see maybe now firsthand, but heard from folks that went through
[01:03:31] Mario: it firsthand.
[01:03:32] Mario: Yeah, I'd be curious to hear that story.
[01:03:36] Mario: And maybe a few months later, if folks came out of the woodwork after you gave that speech
[01:03:41] Mario: and shared that and maybe even more of those sort of horror stories came to light.
[01:03:47] Mario: On the operation choke point stuff, where you basically have had all the banks cracking
[01:03:54] Joey Krug: down on crypto.
[01:03:56] Joey Krug: People have definitely shared that more.
[01:03:58] Joey Krug: I think after that talk, I made a tweet about it where I'd be like, you know, we'd
[01:04:02] Joey Krug: treat this if you had a bank account shut down as a result of being in crypto and is kind
[01:04:06] Joey Krug: of one of the more viral tweets that I've had.
[01:04:10] Joey Krug: And the Trump ad meant it's definitely kind of reversed all that stuff.
[01:04:16] Joey Krug: You know, a lot of the banks that wouldn't bank me or some of them have reached out now
[01:04:22] Joey Krug: offer me to join their private wealth management.
[01:04:26] Joey Krug: I've ignored all those because you didn't want me back in the day.
[01:04:30] Joey Krug: Yeah, yeah, it's like, so I think that stuff seems to have gotten fixed.
[01:04:36] Joey Krug: I think the other thing is just that's been even a bigger deal has been kind of all the
[01:04:41] Joey Krug: regulatory stuff like, you know, under the, under the by-demand, there was this thing,
[01:04:46] Joey Krug: you know, the SEC was just infuriating, you know, they'd say, come in and talk to us.
[01:04:51] Joey Krug: But, you know, probably like 95% of the founders I know who tried to get a meeting, you know,
[01:04:58] Joey Krug: they would have met with them.
[01:04:59] Joey Krug: And then the very few that did get a meeting, you know, the SEC would kind of just listen.
[01:05:04] Joey Krug: And then, you know, usually later use anything they said against them in some, you know, BS
[01:05:10] Joey Krug: lawsuit.
[01:05:11] Joey Krug: I think like the most observed thing, I remember under the by-demand for crypto, was that
[01:05:18] Joey Krug: the SEC actually tried to take the position at one point that stablecoins were a security.
[01:05:23] Joey Krug: Even though like if you buy USDC, like you can't really make money, you know, it's, it's
[01:05:29] Joey Krug: paid to a dollar, that's the entire point.
[01:05:33] Joey Krug: And, you know, there are some like very obscure legal arguments you can use to say that it
[01:05:37] Joey Krug: is, but like everybody knows it's not like practice.
[01:05:41] Joey Krug: It's like trying to say this guy is, you know, green or something.
[01:05:45] Joey Krug: It's just like it doesn't have any real logic to it.
[01:05:48] Joey Krug: But yeah, so I hate the Trump admin is basically fixed, you know, essentially all that stuff.
[01:05:53] Joey Krug: The new SEC chair seems really good.
[01:05:56] Joey Krug: The new, you know, person that they're hopefully getting confirmed soon for the CFTC seems
[01:06:01] Joey Krug: really positive.
[01:06:02] Joey Krug: So I think that's taken a complete, complete 180.
[01:06:05] Joey Krug: What, you know, taking clarity as as red, let's say, what are the sort of other pieces
[01:06:11] Mario: that maybe feel like they're, they're still missing or you would still like to see, you
[01:06:17] Mario: know, further action on.
[01:06:19] I think the other, you know, area that, you know, probably doesn't get into the clarity
[01:06:25] Joey Krug: act that I think would be good is, you know, there's kind of these like regulatory exemptions
[01:06:29] Joey Krug: for like spot exchanges that are decentralized, like you know, swap and things like that.
[01:06:35] It's kind of unclear whether they're going to exempt and probably not, you know, things
[01:06:39] Joey Krug: like decentralized perpetual exchanges, you know, things like hyper liquid and, and,
[01:06:43] Joey Krug: and lighter and stuff like that.
[01:06:46] Joey Krug: You know, the same thing for, for prediction markets.
[01:06:50] Joey Krug: Like anyone in financial markets, you know, would, would clearly tell you that a global
[01:06:55] Joey Krug: liquidity book is just going to be far more liquid and better than, you know, where probably
[01:07:01] Joey Krug: markets currently have an end up, which is, which is you have, you know, US exchange.
[01:07:07] Joey Krug: And then you have kind of the offshore one.
[01:07:09] Joey Krug: I think a much better like long term, you know, think over many years regulatory structural
[01:07:15] Joey Krug: would be sort of like what, um, Pester Pierce kind of proposed the SEC back in the day,
[01:07:21] Joey Krug: which is you have this idea that it's like, DeFi should exist.
[01:07:24] Joey Krug: You should be able to trade on it.
[01:07:25] Joey Krug: It should be legal.
[01:07:26] Joey Krug: It shouldn't, it should not be illegal.
[01:07:28] Joey Krug: And, but the one negative of trading on DeFi is that you don't get the regulatory protections
[01:07:34] Joey Krug: if you trade on a, on a regulated platform.
[01:07:36] Joey Krug: And then if you want those regulatory protections, um, you can build like a regulated thing on
[01:07:42] Joey Krug: top of it.
[01:07:43] Joey Krug: And so I think like if you look by 10 years, like the ideal way, there's something like
[01:07:46] Joey Krug: poly markets should work is you have the core platform, decentralized smart contracts
[01:07:51] Joey Krug: based, the liquidity books completely global.
[01:07:54] Joey Krug: And then in the US, you, you can also trade on that if you want, but then there's also
[01:07:58] Joey Krug: like a thing on top that feeds directly into the same liquidity pool.
[01:08:02] Joey Krug: And that has kind of the regular regulatory licenses.
[01:08:04] Joey Krug: If you're, um, you know, Citadel and you want to bet, you know, $100 million on, on
[01:08:10] Joey Krug: some, you know, Fed action or something, yes, that's probably what you use because you
[01:08:14] Joey Krug: want the full regulated financial and, you know, system, but you still get the same, same
[01:08:18] Joey Krug: share of liquidity.
[01:08:20] Joey Krug: Like that's, yeah, that's, that's sort of for like over a five to 10 year horizon.
[01:08:24] Joey Krug: That's the way I hope this stuff goes.
[01:08:26] Joey Krug: Um, versus right now, you know, kind of feels like we're trying to, you know, the market
[01:08:31] Joey Krug: structure of having these things be separate, doesn't really make sense.
[01:08:33] Joey Krug: And like it's very clear that the smart contract based way of doing it is, is superior.
[01:08:38] Joey Krug: And so it's just like a matter of time and do knows how long that takes, but that's, that's
[01:08:42] Joey Krug: sort of the one thing that I think probably doesn't get done in this admin.
[01:08:45] Joey Krug: I think there's probably people in the admin who do want it to happen, but it's, it's more
[01:08:48] Joey Krug: like, you know, it's Congress, you got to be practical and get what you can get done
[01:08:52] Joey Krug: versus trying to, you know, get everything all at once.
[01:08:56] Joey Krug: Yes.
[01:08:57] Mario: Well, before we maybe go into a wrap up question, one, one final thing that I was curious
[01:09:03] Mario: to hear about is maybe how your investing lens has changed since joining Founders Fund,
[01:09:10] Mario: you know, obviously when I sort of looked back at your medium post announcing that you
[01:09:16] Mario: were going to Founders Fund, you talked about how prescient Peter had been in sort of predicting
[01:09:21] Mario: the contours of cryptocurrency back in the late 90s.
[01:09:26] Mario: And you know, the value of being part of a really high quality generalist investing
[01:09:31] Mario: team on and how that can influence your thinking positively.
[01:09:35] Mario: So after I guess a couple years of this or maybe longer, yeah, how is that maybe change
[01:09:40] Mario: the way you think about your work?
[01:09:42] Mario: A bunch of different ways.
[01:09:43] Mario: You know, I think one of the, you know, one of the things when I first joined Founders
[01:09:48] Joey Krug: Fund is there's like a, I forget who someone on the investment team sent me a link and
[01:09:52] Joey Krug: it's all the historical, you know, annual meeting talks, Peter's given.
[01:09:56] Joey Krug: And I kind of just flipped through all the slides of them and, you know, one of them
[01:10:01] Joey Krug: is this thing where there's a slide and it's like Michael Jordan and it's a slide of
[01:10:06] Joey Krug: him when he was playing baseball.
[01:10:09] Joey Krug: And then there's another slide, you know, right after where he's playing basketball.
[01:10:13] Joey Krug: And I forget what the slide said, but it's something like, you know, counter market fit
[01:10:16] Joey Krug: is probably like the number one thing.
[01:10:18] Joey Krug: You know, incredibly important.
[01:10:21] Joey Krug: You know, Michael Jordan was not a very good baseball player, but world class at basketball.
[01:10:25] Joey Krug: That's something I think a lot about, you know, it's Founders Fund in the name.
[01:10:31] Joey Krug: It's about backing the best founders.
[01:10:33] Joey Krug: But then I think this is other aspect of like, is this the right founder for a different
[01:10:37] Joey Krug: market and product that they're building?
[01:10:39] Joey Krug: And then I think the other really interesting thing is there was another slide like this.
[01:10:44] Joey Krug: I've heard Peter talk about this sense as well.
[01:10:46] Joey Krug: It's like this notion that really great founders, they're not like this like, you know,
[01:10:52] Joey Krug: checklist.
[01:10:53] Joey Krug: In fact, they're really, really great at some things and really, really bad other things.
[01:10:57] Joey Krug: And I think that's probably true for greatness writ large.
[01:11:01] Joey Krug: And that's really interesting thing.
[01:11:02] Joey Krug: So then it sort of forces the question when you go out investing.
[01:11:05] Joey Krug: I think one of the things, you know, that we do well at Founders Fund is try to zero
[01:11:09] Joey Krug: and on like one of the most important one or two questions for whether this will work.
[01:11:14] Joey Krug: And then also, you know, how do those tie into who the founder is and what they spike at
[01:11:18] Joey Krug: and, you know, what they're bad at.
[01:11:22] Joey Krug: And that's probably one one area.
[01:11:25] Joey Krug: And then I think the other thing, you know, that is kind of the fact of the way I invest
[01:11:29] Joey Krug: is just looking at things from the lens of like, you read like, you're at a one, Peter
[01:11:34] Joey Krug: talks about this a lot.
[01:11:35] Joey Krug: But it's like, you know, people really underestimate the power law.
[01:11:38] Joey Krug: And then there's kind of this notion that like getting to scale matters a lot.
[01:11:45] Joey Krug: And you know, I think if you look at that, like one way to apply it to crypto that I've
[01:11:51] Joey Krug: kind of applied it to is if you look at things like Polymarket as one example, we, you know,
[01:11:57] Joey Krug: we doubled down again in them, you know, earlier this summer.
[01:12:02] And some of these, I know, I thought that that was like a two expensive price, you know,
[01:12:06] Joey Krug: they raised it way, way higher price, you know, a few months later because the traction
[01:12:11] Joey Krug: forexed.
[01:12:12] Joey Krug: And I think it just comes from like people tend to really underestimate the power law.
[01:12:17] Joey Krug: And how there's many cases where something that, you know, feels expensive actually isn't
[01:12:23] Joey Krug: or something that feels not expensive is actually incredibly expensive.
[01:12:27] Joey Krug: And I guess the last thing on this question, you know, our growth team recently kind of
[01:12:32] Joey Krug: did this analysis of like, if you look at companies and how long it took them to get
[01:12:35] Joey Krug: from of the ones that made it, how long it took them to go from like, you know, 10 billion
[01:12:39] Joey Krug: to 100 billion market cap and then 100 billion to a trillion.
[01:12:43] Joey Krug: It's actually faster for the larger scale within tech, which is kind of surprising.
[01:12:51] Joey Krug: Now of course, the hard part is making sure you're in those companies is supposed to
[01:12:55] Joey Krug: the ones that that failed.
[01:12:57] Joey Krug: Yes.
[01:12:58] Joey Krug: Which makes being really selective, really important.
[01:13:01] Joey Krug: But I think, you know, those sorts of lenses are, you know, some of the things I thought
[01:13:06] Joey Krug: about that hadn't realized how important they were prior to being at Founders Fund.
[01:13:10] Joey Krug: And then some of them are just, you know, like the, the growth one is kind of counterintuitive.
[01:13:15] Joey Krug: But empirically true.
[01:13:17] Joey Krug: What a thoughtful answer.
[01:13:18] Joey Krug: I'm going to be mulling that one over for a while, I think.
[01:13:22] Mario: Well, as a, as a final question, I always like to ask guests, if you had the power to
[01:13:28] Mario: assign a book to everyone on earth to read and understand, what is the book you'd want
[01:13:33] Mario: to assign people?
[01:13:34] Joey Krug: I think one, one book that's just really good is there's this book about the history of
[01:13:40] Joey Krug: hedge funds.
[01:13:41] Joey Krug: A lot of people listening to this have probably heard of in the power law and the venture
[01:13:44] Joey Krug: side, which I actually haven't, haven't read.
[01:13:48] Joey Krug: But the same author wrote this book called More Money from God and it's a history of, you
[01:13:52] Joey Krug: know, a lot of history of financial markets and of hedge fund investing and trading.
[01:13:58] Joey Krug: It's probably the, probably the most interesting investing book I've ever read, but maybe alongside
[01:14:04] Joey Krug: like Soros, the Alchemy of Money or Finance, whatever the title is.
[01:14:08] Joey Krug: Because both of them provide like a really insightful window into how like really great investors
[01:14:14] Joey Krug: thought about the investments they were making at the time that they made them.
