[00:00:00] The history of Felicia suggests that even in these hot markets when other folks have leaned in and gotten burned,
[00:00:06] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you've managed to be strong enough on the selection that those vintage is still looking.
[00:00:11] Mario (Last Name Unknown): There has been many instances where we picked the company just right and we were off by a 10X on the entry value.
[00:00:18] Aydin Senkut: So everybody looked at only that side and said there is no way it's going to work.
[00:00:22] Aydin Senkut: But what they missed is the revenue growth that materialized after was 30X, 50X, 100X.
[00:00:28] Aydin Senkut: So while we were 10X wrong on the entry price, we were absolutely on the rest of the revenue growth,
[00:00:34] Aydin Senkut: but I even have a much, much larger factor.
[00:00:36] Aydin Senkut: One of the investments that you've made is in skill day-eye.
[00:00:39] Mario (Last Name Unknown): How have you thought about the way AI begins to enter the physical world more?
[00:00:43] Mario (Last Name Unknown): We're going to have a ton more robots in the next 10 to 20 years.
[00:00:46] Aydin Senkut: I doubt it's going to take jobs away.
[00:00:47] Aydin Senkut: It's just going to do jobs that people are not meant to do, but they're doing it because there is no other way of doing it.
[00:00:53] Aydin Senkut: I do think it's going to be a happy coexistence.
[00:00:55] Aydin Senkut: We're going to have a lot of robots and they're going to take more drudgery out of our lives.
[00:01:04] When Eidon Senkut started as a solo GP in 2006,
[00:01:08] Mario (Last Name Unknown): most LPs rejected him, giving him little chance of succeeding as an investor.
[00:01:13] Nearly two decades later,
[00:01:14] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Eidon has transformed Felicis into a Silicon Valley franchise,
[00:01:18] Mario (Last Name Unknown): now on its 10th fund, a $900 million vehicle.
[00:01:22] Mario (Last Name Unknown): While many VCs insist on the importance of specialization,
[00:01:26] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Eidon has kept Felicis genuinely generous.
[00:01:30] From Shopify to Adyen to Canva to Crusoe,
[00:01:34] Mario (Last Name Unknown): the firm has found billion dollar outcomes across nearly every imaginable category,
[00:01:38] Mario (Last Name Unknown): including in companies that many others overlooked.
[00:01:42] In today's episode, Eidon and I discuss how he scaled Felicis from a one-man operation
[00:01:47] Mario (Last Name Unknown): into a well-oiled machine, his framework for evaluating opportunities across wildly different sectors,
[00:01:54] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and why he's betting aggressively on AI despite the sky high valuations.
[00:01:59] Mario (Last Name Unknown): We also cover his approach to portfolio construction,
[00:02:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and what he learned from working with Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
[00:02:07] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I'm Mario and this is the generalist.
[00:02:11] Every revolution in Eid creates one question that never changes.
[00:02:15] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Can you trust the output?
[00:02:17] Mario (Last Name Unknown): AI for work is incredible, but without trust, it's just leading to faster mistakes.
[00:02:22] Mario (Last Name Unknown): The challenge isn't building an AI that can answer questions,
[00:02:26] Mario (Last Name Unknown): it's making sure those answers are right.
[00:02:28] Mario (Last Name Unknown): That's where Guru comes in.
[00:02:30] Mario (Last Name Unknown): It's the AI source of truth that connects everything your company knows.
[00:02:34] Mario (Last Name Unknown): So every insight, every answer, every recommendation,
[00:02:38] Mario (Last Name Unknown): is grounded in verified knowledge, not outdated information or hallucinations.
[00:02:43] Mario (Last Name Unknown): When your teams and your AI share one trusted foundation,
[00:02:47] Mario (Last Name Unknown): everything moves faster, with fewer reduce, fewer blind spots,
[00:02:51] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and more confidence in every decision.
[00:02:53] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Because in the age of AI, truth isn't just power, it's protection.
[00:02:58] See what Guru is doing for thousands of companies like Spotify, DHL, and Stripe at GetGuru.com.
[00:03:04] Mario (Last Name Unknown): That's GetGuru.com.
[00:03:07] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Well, Eidon, I'm super excited to have you here.
[00:03:10] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I've admired your career for a long time.
[00:03:12] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And I remember the last conversation we had very well and really enjoyed it.
[00:03:18] Mario (Last Name Unknown): So lots to get into today.
[00:03:20] Looking forward to it.
[00:03:22] I'd love to start a little bit with your origins, because you started Phileasus as a solo capitalist.
[00:03:29] Mario (Last Name Unknown): The language of that term hadn't come to the fore yet,
[00:03:33] Mario (Last Name Unknown): but you were a solo GP running a strategy that really was your own.
[00:03:39] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And that has evolved into a real franchise over the past 16 years, such that you guys recently
[00:03:46] Mario (Last Name Unknown): announced a 10th fund, 900 million.
[00:03:49] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And so I'd love to begin this conversation maybe by closing the gap between
[00:03:54] Mario (Last Name Unknown): where you are today and how you started out.
[00:03:57] Mario (Last Name Unknown): How did a boy from Istanbul wind up in Silicon Valley?
[00:04:01] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I kind of feel like I lived in five, six different lives.
[00:04:07] Aydin Senkut: When I was a kid, I couldn't be farther from the truth of today here.
[00:04:12] Aydin Senkut: But it was really interesting.
[00:04:13] Aydin Senkut: My dream as a kid when I was seven, eight years old was always to travel around the world,
[00:04:18] Aydin Senkut: meet people, do something, and whatever it is, it's to learn languages, to learn other cultures,
[00:04:24] Aydin Senkut: to discover other countries.
[00:04:26] Aydin Senkut: I was very lucky that I was able to get into actually a German school in Turkey.
[00:04:32] Aydin Senkut: And that allowed me to then use the language.
[00:04:36] Aydin Senkut: Afterwards, I came to the US for college and then ended up working in countries like Morocco,
[00:04:42] Aydin Senkut: Switzerland, Germany, Brazil, and then came back to the US for grad school.
[00:04:50] And all of those things, I think, just gave me a little different flavor,
[00:04:55] Aydin Senkut: which then allowed me to make the jump to Silicon Valley.
[00:04:59] Aydin Senkut: And that was a crazy story too, because I was not really an engineer,
[00:05:03] Aydin Senkut: so I had to really push to get my first chances and intern.
[00:05:06] Aydin Senkut: And I ended up coming here about 30 years ago.
[00:05:09] Aydin Senkut: And the languages and the experience of having lived abroad has always served me well.
[00:05:14] Aydin Senkut: It's actually what differentiated me at Google.
[00:05:17] Aydin Senkut: And it allowed me my first product job there.
[00:05:21] Aydin Senkut: And then I did international sales.
[00:05:23] Aydin Senkut: And that allowed me to get this ability to, wherever I am, relate to people.
[00:05:29] Aydin Senkut: And I think this is interesting because it's one of the most underrated aspects of venture capital.
[00:05:34] Aydin Senkut: Everybody thinks about the numbers, but it's really about people.
[00:05:37] Aydin Senkut: And what's really interesting is, even today,
[00:05:40] Aydin Senkut: one of the things that makes Felicia's different is a lot of our most successful companies
[00:05:45] Aydin Senkut: tend to be global and international.
[00:05:47] Aydin Senkut: So in some ways, I am living the dream, the crazy imagination I had as a little kid.
[00:05:53] Aydin Senkut: And that's what I feel like.
[00:05:55] Aydin Senkut: I'm working and loving what I do.
[00:05:58] Aydin Senkut: And I have that enthusiasm of an eight-year-old.
[00:06:02] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Amazing. Well, I think we're going to go into a lot of those different pieces of the story.
[00:06:09] One of the things that struck me when I was researching you a little bit was that
[00:06:13] Mario (Last Name Unknown): your parents were entrepreneurs.
[00:06:15] Mario (Last Name Unknown): So you must have grown up with seeing what it really took from a very early age.
[00:06:22] Yes, indeed.
[00:06:22] I'm an only child, both my parents were entrepreneurs, different paths,
[00:06:27] Aydin Senkut: and different learnings.
[00:06:29] Aydin Senkut: My mom started as a VP of HR.
[00:06:32] Aydin Senkut: And that was really interesting because whenever I went to visit her at work,
[00:06:35] Aydin Senkut: I was fascinated by how she did what she did.
[00:06:40] Aydin Senkut: You know, she had this elaborate system of like really getting to know people and what made them
[00:06:44] Aydin Senkut: tick and what was really great about what she did is it was very much skill-based.
[00:06:49] Aydin Senkut: And then later on she joined a recruiter.
[00:06:51] Aydin Senkut: And then she just wanted to do it in her own way.
[00:06:54] Aydin Senkut: And then she had her own recruiting firm.
[00:06:56] Aydin Senkut: And what was really cool is she worked until she was 81.
[00:07:01] Aydin Senkut: Wow.
[00:07:01] Aydin Senkut: And four in firms employed her all the way from Denmark to Israel to Bulgaria in like crazy countries,
[00:07:09] Aydin Senkut: where she had no background.
[00:07:10] Aydin Senkut: And they're like, look, you're so good at what you do.
[00:07:12] Aydin Senkut: We want you to go to these countries and still do what you do in Turkey for us.
[00:07:17] Aydin Senkut: And she would take my dad with her.
[00:07:19] Aydin Senkut: My dad on the other hand, you know, I came in, they met in college.
[00:07:23] Aydin Senkut: They were college sweethearts.
[00:07:24] Aydin Senkut: I came pretty early so he had to kind of pick something very quickly.
[00:07:29] Aydin Senkut: And our family business was textiles, which was a big industry in Turkey.
[00:07:33] Aydin Senkut: And the big difference there is that was good as it lasted.
[00:07:38] Aydin Senkut: But it was a commodity business.
[00:07:39] Aydin Senkut: And as long or as soon as kind of cheaper textiles came to Turkey from Asia,
[00:07:45] Aydin Senkut: his business was pretty much done.
[00:07:47] Aydin Senkut: And so it was a very important lesson that stayed with me that it wasn't just important to be an
[00:07:52] Aydin Senkut: entrepreneur, but what you did really mattered.
[00:07:55] Aydin Senkut: And I kind of realized that strategically, you know, like being in a line like I am now,
[00:08:02] Aydin Senkut: it's very much like skill and capital base.
[00:08:05] Aydin Senkut: It's very asset light.
[00:08:07] Aydin Senkut: Also, it's kind of like very much adapting to the times.
[00:08:09] Aydin Senkut: In fact, it's ahead of times.
[00:08:11] Aydin Senkut: So the likelihood to get disrupted is a lot lower versus if you're in a traditional
[00:08:15] Aydin Senkut: industry, you have a factory.
[00:08:17] Aydin Senkut: You have a whole team of people, you know, like you have very thin margin for error and you're
[00:08:23] Aydin Senkut: at the mercy of what's happening in the markets in the world.
[00:08:26] Aydin Senkut: So that's something that really stayed with me.
[00:08:28] Aydin Senkut: On the other hand, I also have to say that for those that are brave enough and lucky enough
[00:08:33] Aydin Senkut: to be an entrepreneur, I think this is the best thing in the world.
[00:08:36] Aydin Senkut: You know, like some people have the personality.
[00:08:39] Aydin Senkut: They're not really made to be employees.
[00:08:41] Aydin Senkut: They're made to be like, you know, like do crazy things, like take some chances.
[00:08:45] Aydin Senkut: And risk, do original things.
[00:08:47] Aydin Senkut: And sometimes the best way to do that is as an entrepreneur as a founder,
[00:08:51] Aydin Senkut: which I'm sure you would appreciate.
[00:08:52] Aydin Senkut: Yes, definitely.
[00:08:54] Mario (Last Name Unknown): You were employee, I think 63 at Google.
[00:08:57] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And I imagine that was a very special group of people at the time that you joined.
[00:09:02] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I imagine the talent density must have been pretty remarkable.
[00:09:05] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I wonder what you remember of those early people and that early company.
[00:09:09] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I remember a lot of stuff and here's a crazy story.
[00:09:11] Aydin Senkut: The reason why I was 63 and not 30, actually my offer came in when there were 30 employees.
[00:09:17] Aydin Senkut: But it took over three months for my H1B to transfer.
[00:09:22] Aydin Senkut: And I still have these nightmares that I think if we were in today's climate,
[00:09:26] Aydin Senkut: I don't even know if I would have made it.
[00:09:27] Aydin Senkut: So I'm very grateful for those early days.
[00:09:30] Aydin Senkut: Coming back to Google, look, the one thing that stuckly stood out for me is how smart the people were.
[00:09:37] Aydin Senkut: Everybody around me I felt was super smart.
[00:09:39] Aydin Senkut: Not only were they super smart, they were super talented.
[00:09:42] Aydin Senkut: And one thing that stood out for me is how unique and individual each one of them were.
[00:09:48] Aydin Senkut: And how a different take they had on everything.
[00:09:51] Aydin Senkut: If you were to ask me one thing that stayed with me from my Google days,
[00:09:55] Aydin Senkut: where I was for six years through its IPO, is that whenever we faced a big problem or
[00:10:00] Aydin Senkut: whenever we had something big to do, we never took a standard way to do it.
[00:10:05] Aydin Senkut: We never went the art of the orthodox way.
[00:10:07] Aydin Senkut: We were always very creative.
[00:10:09] Aydin Senkut: We always did something very unique and unusual and something that I never thought would work.
[00:10:14] Aydin Senkut: Or I'm like, oh my god, this is crazy.
[00:10:16] Aydin Senkut: Like, wow, this is a totally different way of tackling it and long behold.
[00:10:20] Aydin Senkut: Not only did we do it, but it also turned out to be, wow, that's a great way or best way to do it.
[00:10:26] Aydin Senkut: And I think that training was really important because in essence, what we do,
[00:10:31] Aydin Senkut: if you're like, hey, what is the venture capital business?
[00:10:34] Aydin Senkut: It's a business about outliers.
[00:10:36] Aydin Senkut: The only way you can be successful is to be an outlier yourself,
[00:10:39] Aydin Senkut: to identify other outliers and appreciate them before it's obvious,
[00:10:44] Aydin Senkut: hopefully, of a chance to partner to invest with them.
[00:10:47] Aydin Senkut: And so the best way to train for that is to be in an outlier company, see how it operates,
[00:10:53] Aydin Senkut: how it does things, just to kind of get that DNA.
[00:10:56] Aydin Senkut: And I thought it was fantastic training in that way.
[00:11:00] Mario (Last Name Unknown): To what extent did seeing Larry and Sergey and Eric Schmidt
[00:11:06] Mario (Last Name Unknown): sort of operate that business and the extreme level of growth that that company went through
[00:11:13] Mario (Last Name Unknown): sort of impact what you started to look for in entrepreneurs.
[00:11:16] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Like, did you find yourself almost trying to pattern match against these three very remarkable
[00:11:22] Mario (Last Name Unknown): people? Was it perhaps more abstract than that?
[00:11:26] Mario (Last Name Unknown): No, I mean, definitely, whatever you learn and your experiences really stay with you.
[00:11:31] Aydin Senkut: And it wasn't just the three of them.
[00:11:33] Aydin Senkut: Like, we had a person who ran like data centers and infrastructure for Google.
[00:11:38] Aydin Senkut: We used to joke that he was like, dark way there.
[00:11:40] Aydin Senkut: He would negotiate with data centers and like, I don't know,
[00:11:43] Aydin Senkut: a couple of them went bankrupt after that.
[00:11:45] Aydin Senkut: And like, I never ever want to negotiate against that guy.
[00:11:48] Aydin Senkut: But like, everybody that did something like the person who did like,
[00:11:52] Aydin Senkut: the web spider was like only 18 years old.
[00:11:54] Aydin Senkut: And he was really special. He's still like a dear friend.
[00:11:57] Aydin Senkut: Everybody was unique and individual and super strong and some way and super smart.
[00:12:03] Aydin Senkut: But something's really stuck with me at the end.
[00:12:06] Aydin Senkut: For instance, like, everything that I did with Larry, every single thing he asked,
[00:12:11] Aydin Senkut: nothing less than 10X would be acceptable to him.
[00:12:14] Aydin Senkut: So every time he asked us to do something, it had to be 10X better, 10X faster or 10X cheaper.
[00:12:20] Aydin Senkut: And his concept was very simple.
[00:12:23] Aydin Senkut: If somebody just asked you to do something better, say 20% better, 30% better.
[00:12:28] Aydin Senkut: On surface, it looks like, yeah, it's great.
[00:12:31] Aydin Senkut: But the thing is, you can do that with a marginal improvement.
[00:12:34] Aydin Senkut: But if somebody asks you a 10X change, you have to completely change the way you think.
[00:12:40] Aydin Senkut: You have to completely rethink the way you do things.
[00:12:43] Aydin Senkut: So that really stayed with me.
[00:12:45] Aydin Senkut: The other interesting thing was, for instance, Larry basically said no all the time.
[00:12:51] Aydin Senkut: I mean, I think like his vocabulary was no 99% of time.
[00:12:56] Aydin Senkut: And then maybe like, yes, every now and then and then some other words.
[00:13:01] Aydin Senkut: And I mean, I'm dramatizing a little bit.
[00:13:03] Aydin Senkut: But the whole point of that is he was very razor sharp focus and very much of the mind
[00:13:08] Aydin Senkut: that do very, very few things well.
[00:13:10] Aydin Senkut: But make sure that those things are things that matter.
[00:13:13] Aydin Senkut: The other thing that I observe, especially like Sergei, it was so fun to work with him.
[00:13:17] Aydin Senkut: Even though both Larry and Sergei were only PhD students, they were never in a corporation
[00:13:21] Aydin Senkut: or worked a single day in their lives.
[00:13:24] Aydin Senkut: They had an amazing business instinct as well.
[00:13:27] Aydin Senkut: So they were special that there are a lot of people that are academically smart.
[00:13:31] Aydin Senkut: But to combine that with a commercial instinct is pretty rare.
[00:13:36] Aydin Senkut: And when Eric Schmidt joined, all he did was kind of button things up.
[00:13:40] Aydin Senkut: It was really funny. We were 500 people.
[00:13:42] Aydin Senkut: And he's like, what?
[00:13:43] Aydin Senkut: Like you guys are still writing this on quickbooks.
[00:13:46] Aydin Senkut: You know, we made a net suite implementation and so on and so forth.
[00:13:49] Aydin Senkut: So it was a really great combination and a really great kind of distillation of duties.
[00:13:54] Aydin Senkut: And the other interesting thing was like they were really committed.
[00:13:57] Aydin Senkut: This was not just the job.
[00:13:58] Aydin Senkut: I mean, I used to see Larry at 9 p.m. 10 p.m. at night.
[00:14:02] Aydin Senkut: When his day job was over, he would go to his office and basically configure or create servers.
[00:14:09] Aydin Senkut: And he's like, I'm like, Larry, why are you doing that?
[00:14:11] Aydin Senkut: Can we not buy servers?
[00:14:12] Aydin Senkut: He's like, why would we buy servers?
[00:14:14] Aydin Senkut: Like they're not really done for the way that we want them to work.
[00:14:18] Aydin Senkut: And CPUs are so cheap, storage is so cheap.
[00:14:21] Aydin Senkut: I'm would be pretty good at configuring it myself.
[00:14:25] Aydin Senkut: And not only will it be cheaper, but it will be the exact machines as we need.
[00:14:28] Aydin Senkut: Like he could have easily taken an easy way out and say,
[00:14:31] Aydin Senkut: why am I doing this at 10 p.m.
[00:14:33] Aydin Senkut: We can just buy servers.
[00:14:35] Aydin Senkut: But even there, like every single thing he did was very much perfectionist.
[00:14:39] Aydin Senkut: It's very much down to the smallest details.
[00:14:41] Gosh, I love stories like this so much to really see what obsessiveness and perfectionism looks like in action.
[00:14:47] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And also that extreme focus.
[00:14:48] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I mean, it's funny.
[00:14:50] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I rhyme so directly with one of those famous Steve Jobs quote about,
[00:14:54] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you know, focus isn't saying no to things that aren't a good idea.
[00:14:58] Mario (Last Name Unknown): It's saying no to something that you know is a great idea.
[00:15:00] Mario (Last Name Unknown): But doing it anyway, because there's something even more important.
[00:15:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): When did the idea of investing sort of come into your mind as something that you were interested in and that you
[00:15:10] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you maybe thought you would be good at?
[00:15:12] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Honestly, it also started when I was a kid.
[00:15:14] Aydin Senkut: You know, I don't think about it as much.
[00:15:17] Aydin Senkut: But again, when I was seven, eight years old,
[00:15:19] Aydin Senkut: I joke like only Turks and Brazilians.
[00:15:22] Aydin Senkut: We were two countries that had 100% inflation for 20 years.
[00:15:25] Aydin Senkut: And what ended up happening is when I was seven, eight years old,
[00:15:28] Aydin Senkut: you know, families have different dinner conversations.
[00:15:30] Aydin Senkut: Our dinner conversation every night.
[00:15:32] Aydin Senkut: Are we going to buy German marks French, French, Swiss,
[00:15:35] Aydin Senkut: French?
[00:15:36] Aydin Senkut: Are we going to buy real estate because you couldn't keep it in the local currency?
[00:15:40] Aydin Senkut: I mean, 100% means every year whatever you have,
[00:15:44] Aydin Senkut: like it's essentially lost most of his value or at least half of his value.
[00:15:48] Aydin Senkut: So that meant that from the very early age, regardless of Matt,
[00:15:52] Aydin Senkut: regardless of finance, everything I was doing was around,
[00:15:56] Aydin Senkut: how can I think about like compounding returns and where would money appreciate the most?
[00:16:01] Aydin Senkut: So it kind of become a second nature.
[00:16:04] Aydin Senkut: It was great training.
[00:16:05] Aydin Senkut: The other thing was I used to read all my parents,
[00:16:09] Aydin Senkut: like Fortune and Business Week magazines.
[00:16:11] Aydin Senkut: And I used to see like these incredible companies and CEOs and the stocks.
[00:16:16] Aydin Senkut: And I'm like, wow, it would be amazing to be able to buy and sell this
[00:16:20] Aydin Senkut: or maybe become a CEO one day.
[00:16:22] Aydin Senkut: And you know, you have to start with a dream.
[00:16:24] Aydin Senkut: And little did I know that there was this really interesting
[00:16:27] Aydin Senkut: part of finance called venture capital.
[00:16:30] Aydin Senkut: And when I left Google and I wanted to tackle this,
[00:16:32] Aydin Senkut: I went through a bunch of other ideas,
[00:16:34] Aydin Senkut: but realized that those sounded greatest hobbies.
[00:16:37] Aydin Senkut: But as a business, again, I went back to my parents' beginnings.
[00:16:42] Aydin Senkut: And I didn't want to tackle anything where there was,
[00:16:45] Aydin Senkut: you know, anything that could be disrupted by the markets or was not asset life and all of that.
[00:16:51] Aydin Senkut: And when it came to the idea of venture capital,
[00:16:56] Aydin Senkut: I'm like, this is great because honestly, all you need is capital,
[00:16:59] Aydin Senkut: a great strategy and execution.
[00:17:02] Aydin Senkut: So from an entrepreneurship point of view,
[00:17:04] Aydin Senkut: it felt like the best opportunity.
[00:17:07] Aydin Senkut: But the other scary thing about it is I've never done it.
[00:17:10] Aydin Senkut: I didn't have a network.
[00:17:12] Aydin Senkut: I didn't have a team.
[00:17:14] Aydin Senkut: All I had was some capital and a crazy idea.
[00:17:17] Aydin Senkut: But that's what the founders and entrepreneurs need sometimes and go all in.
[00:17:22] Aydin Senkut: So I did and I went all in.
[00:17:24] Had you made a few angel investments during your time at Google
[00:17:27] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that it's sort of given you a flavor of it?
[00:17:30] I did not.
[00:17:31] Aydin Senkut: I did.
[00:17:32] Aydin Senkut: It was complete cold turkey cold start.
[00:17:35] Aydin Senkut: And what was really interesting is the beginning was even crazier.
[00:17:40] Aydin Senkut: I actually was a little bit afraid in the beginning.
[00:17:42] Aydin Senkut: I'm like, wow, like, you know, maybe, you know,
[00:17:45] Aydin Senkut: I should really be more conservative.
[00:17:47] Aydin Senkut: It was also crazy in the sense that I was expecting my first child.
[00:17:51] Aydin Senkut: My first one son was on the way.
[00:17:52] Aydin Senkut: And you know, when you're expecting a child, you know,
[00:17:55] Aydin Senkut: the dads become very conservative as well.
[00:17:57] Aydin Senkut: So my initial reaction is maybe this is really crazy.
[00:18:00] Aydin Senkut: I'm going to fail my wife, my family.
[00:18:02] Aydin Senkut: Like, let me go get a job.
[00:18:03] Aydin Senkut: Maybe learn the roles before I tackle this crazy thing.
[00:18:07] Aydin Senkut: But the people that I interviewed basically said,
[00:18:09] Aydin Senkut: I wasn't an engineer.
[00:18:10] Aydin Senkut: I wasn't seeing you enough at Google.
[00:18:12] Aydin Senkut: I mean, I told the story many times.
[00:18:14] Aydin Senkut: But the reality is, look, everybody goes through setbacks and disappointments
[00:18:18] Aydin Senkut: and what seemed like, you know, initial failure or something like that.
[00:18:23] Aydin Senkut: And to me, everything that happened in my life,
[00:18:25] Aydin Senkut: like every single good thing happened on the back of some disappointment of failure.
[00:18:30] Aydin Senkut: And this was similar in the sense that those rejections became rocket fuel.
[00:18:34] Aydin Senkut: And we always talk about like starting a company.
[00:18:37] Aydin Senkut: And why did you do that?
[00:18:38] Aydin Senkut: But I think the motivation and, you know, the fire and the impetus to succeed is equally important.
[00:18:43] Aydin Senkut: If not more important.
[00:18:44] Aydin Senkut: So for me, that was really like the big catalyst.
[00:18:48] Aydin Senkut: It's not that just I wanted to do it.
[00:18:51] Aydin Senkut: But I also really now needed to do it and not only do it,
[00:18:54] Aydin Senkut: but be so good at it to prove all the naysayers wrong.
[00:18:57] Aydin Senkut: That said, like, I could not do this thing.
[00:18:59] Aydin Senkut: I was not fit to be a VC.
[00:19:01] Aydin Senkut: That's it.
[00:19:02] Aydin Senkut: I mean, honestly, this is one of the reasons why I relate to our founders that we work with so much.
[00:19:07] Aydin Senkut: Because a lot of them early on are told the idea is terrible.
[00:19:11] Aydin Senkut: It won't work.
[00:19:12] Aydin Senkut: You know, like what they are thinking about is crazy.
[00:19:15] Aydin Senkut: Or they are thinking about it the wrong way.
[00:19:17] Aydin Senkut: I've been in their shoes.
[00:19:18] Aydin Senkut: And there is nothing like being in someone's shoes to feel like you're one of them.
[00:19:23] Aydin Senkut: And they feel like they're one of you.
[00:19:24] Aydin Senkut: It all worked out.
[00:19:25] Aydin Senkut: It all worked out.
[00:19:26] Aydin Senkut: But it was a crazy beginning.
[00:19:28] When you fast or you rewind to that first fund,
[00:19:32] Mario (Last Name Unknown): which I think it ended up being a $41 million fund.
[00:19:35] Mario (Last Name Unknown): If I'm remembering correctly, what was the sort of strategy that you were going into it with?
[00:19:40] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Like, did you have really specific ideas about, you know, this is the number of positions
[00:19:44] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I really care about.
[00:19:45] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And these are the parts of the ecosystem where I think I can be most effective.
[00:19:51] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I think about a lot of the newer solo capitalists now and being able to sort of understand
[00:19:56] Mario (Last Name Unknown): how someone who's really grown from that position so much for the seeing where it starts is so valuable.
[00:20:01] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I mean, look, there was a lot of strategy and design surprisingly.
[00:20:04] Aydin Senkut: Nothing was really left a chance.
[00:20:07] Aydin Senkut: Honestly, one of the great things about getting the opportunity to do this for four years
[00:20:12] Aydin Senkut: with my own capital as a solo GP is that I made 100 investments.
[00:20:17] Aydin Senkut: It was one of the best times to invest.
[00:20:19] Aydin Senkut: Even in four years, I already had 12 exits.
[00:20:23] Aydin Senkut: Wow.
[00:20:23] Aydin Senkut: By the time we were doing our first fundraise.
[00:20:25] Aydin Senkut: So I think it's a little bit different than today.
[00:20:29] Aydin Senkut: There are a lot of great people on the scene, but not as many that can say,
[00:20:33] Aydin Senkut: not only did I have one, but I had a dozen exits.
[00:20:36] Aydin Senkut: It's a really great validation that the strategy is working.
[00:20:40] Aydin Senkut: The other interesting thing was, look, venture fundraising is much more difficult
[00:20:45] Aydin Senkut: and different than people think.
[00:20:47] Aydin Senkut: Limited partners have a very traditional way of thinking about things.
[00:20:51] Aydin Senkut: And they want you to do what traditionally work.
[00:20:55] Aydin Senkut: So if you have an idea that's really different, it's very, very difficult to get limited partners
[00:20:59] Aydin Senkut: to buy it.
[00:21:00] Aydin Senkut: On the other hand, it was also interesting that you're basically telling them,
[00:21:04] Aydin Senkut: this is an original.
[00:21:06] Aydin Senkut: If you were to follow the other ideas, you're going to keep investing in the exact same funds.
[00:21:10] Aydin Senkut: Then what's the impetus to invest in a new fund?
[00:21:12] Aydin Senkut: And so for me, it was really simple.
[00:21:14] Aydin Senkut: I did quite a bit of benchmarking and analysis and realized that there were two or three things
[00:21:21] Aydin Senkut: that was very difficult for the incumbent VC firms in Silicon Valley to do.
[00:21:26] Aydin Senkut: Number one, they had this sense that if you're going to do venture, it needs to be local
[00:21:31] Aydin Senkut: because you need to keep a close eye on the companies.
[00:21:34] Also, they wanted to have control of the company in case something wrong, you know,
[00:21:38] Aydin Senkut: you replaced the founder.
[00:21:39] Aydin Senkut: So they were very inflexible and wanted to have high ownership.
[00:21:43] Aydin Senkut: And they also had this attitude that in order to do venture capital investing,
[00:21:49] Aydin Senkut: you need to be expert in an area, which meant that as an investor,
[00:21:53] Aydin Senkut: you would always be in a narrow field.
[00:21:54] Aydin Senkut: Yes.
[00:21:55] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And I know one of the topics we're going to chat a little bit later on is to be a journalist.
[00:21:59] Aydin Senkut: I had a completely different strategy I told listen.
[00:22:02] Aydin Senkut: If I try to be very good at those things that the other firms are already excellent at,
[00:22:07] Aydin Senkut: that is not a very high probability way of making my way to the top.
[00:22:12] Aydin Senkut: So I had to do something completely different.
[00:22:15] Aydin Senkut: Not only would I be really good at that, but that also had to be something where the existing
[00:22:21] Aydin Senkut: firms would be very hard pressed to do well.
[00:22:24] Aydin Senkut: So I basically said, you do not need to have offices internationally and you do not need to
[00:22:29] Aydin Senkut: be next to the companies you invest.
[00:22:31] Aydin Senkut: Not coincidentally, a lot of our great successes have been for international.
[00:22:35] Aydin Senkut: Because I lived in these countries, I knew the cultures.
[00:22:38] Aydin Senkut: That's where my inherent advantage was, right?
[00:22:40] Aydin Senkut: So I did not feel like I need to go to that country, have an office.
[00:22:45] Aydin Senkut: The other thing is, look, I felt that if you were intellectually curious,
[00:22:49] Aydin Senkut: you did not need to be a subject expert.
[00:22:51] Aydin Senkut: If you understand what's really important about an area,
[00:22:54] Aydin Senkut: you can still make the investment.
[00:22:55] Aydin Senkut: Like, I can make a biotech investment.
[00:22:57] Aydin Senkut: I don't need to be a doctor or a VP of Genentech to be able to make good investments.
[00:23:02] Aydin Senkut: In fact, in some crazy way, it's better that you're not an expert.
[00:23:05] Aydin Senkut: Because if a crazy father comes and say, you know what, we're going to do some things
[00:23:09] Aydin Senkut: in a very different way, you're the expert.
[00:23:11] Aydin Senkut: Your first reaction is, I've been doing this for 20 years.
[00:23:14] Aydin Senkut: The only way to do that is the standard way.
[00:23:17] Aydin Senkut: And this probably has less chance of succeeding.
[00:23:20] Aydin Senkut: In some ways, the only way you can be more imaginative,
[00:23:23] Aydin Senkut: a little bit bolder, is to be in this situation where, like, wow, you know,
[00:23:27] Aydin Senkut: like, just maybe this can work.
[00:23:29] Aydin Senkut: And then the last thing is so much of traditional venture was concentrate capital,
[00:23:35] Aydin Senkut: few number of companies.
[00:23:37] Aydin Senkut: And that never really made sense to me.
[00:23:38] Aydin Senkut: I mean, I had a different thinking on it.
[00:23:40] Aydin Senkut: And this is where, again, my, you know, four years of solo investing,
[00:23:45] Aydin Senkut: 100 companies, I felt that at then, like, the traditional venture model is about 20 companies
[00:23:50] Aydin Senkut: per fund. And I always felt like 50 to 100 companies, roughly 50 to 70 companies per
[00:23:56] Aydin Senkut: fund is the right size.
[00:23:58] Aydin Senkut: And what I basically like found, and maybe one day I'll, I will be able to bring a
[00:24:01] Aydin Senkut: mathematical model in front of you.
[00:24:03] Aydin Senkut: The odds of improving the returns and reducing the risk drastically goes up until about,
[00:24:09] Aydin Senkut: you have 50 to 70 companies in a fund.
[00:24:11] Aydin Senkut: How do I know this?
[00:24:12] Aydin Senkut: Because we have 10 funds.
[00:24:14] Aydin Senkut: And we had situations where we had about 80 companies per fund.
[00:24:17] Aydin Senkut: And my first fund and 100 companies, so I could totally see how the end made a huge contribution
[00:24:24] Aydin Senkut: in terms of how many more unexpected winners the portfolio had.
[00:24:28] Aydin Senkut: And because the portfolio size was really small, small ownership did not matter as much.
[00:24:32] Aydin Senkut: Right? So like, there is all these things that everybody is like, well, that's never going to work.
[00:24:37] Aydin Senkut: That's never going to work.
[00:24:38] Aydin Senkut: But in some ways, it's a little bit lazy because they're also not trying to understand
[00:24:43] Aydin Senkut: your reasoning.
[00:24:44] Aydin Senkut: Like, they're not saying, like, well, maybe it could work.
[00:24:46] Aydin Senkut: Can you help explain to me?
[00:24:47] Aydin Senkut: I'm like, yes, it actually works.
[00:24:49] Aydin Senkut: If it's 5 million of investment and you own 1% of the company,
[00:24:53] Aydin Senkut: for that to be a fund driver is not a huge like push and probability, right?
[00:24:56] Aydin Senkut: Like, even at $41 million.
[00:24:58] Aydin Senkut: And then we did crazy things with the first fund.
[00:25:01] Aydin Senkut: Like, our first major investment was in Angry Birds.
[00:25:04] Aydin Senkut: And the whole run was bigger than our fund.
[00:25:06] Aydin Senkut: And what people didn't understand why we did that is because I realized that all my peers
[00:25:12] Aydin Senkut: were going to continue investing in the exact same seed companies, continue to go to Demodan,
[00:25:18] Aydin Senkut: all of that.
[00:25:19] Aydin Senkut: And I'm like, I'm going to do something that nobody probably is going to do or nobody even expects.
[00:25:24] Aydin Senkut: What was really great is like the international background and the comfort of
[00:25:28] Aydin Senkut: having lived in four continents and having been in 50 countries,
[00:25:32] Aydin Senkut: I felt like I could be home at anywhere and come up to speed in an instant
[00:25:36] Aydin Senkut: and convince those founders that we would be a great partner for them.
[00:25:39] Aydin Senkut: Wow, so interesting.
[00:25:40] Mario (Last Name Unknown): So many threads there that I'm excited to dig into.
[00:25:43] Mario (Last Name Unknown): One that I hadn't fully appreciated and I really should have is the way in which your
[00:25:48] Mario (Last Name Unknown): international background does map to so many of these winners.
[00:25:52] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I mean, Angry Birds, the company's Rovio maybe.
[00:25:54] Mario (Last Name Unknown): You'll have to...
[00:25:55] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Yep, that's it.
[00:25:56] Aydin Senkut: The Scandinavian company.
[00:25:57] Aydin Senkut: That's the one.
[00:25:58] It is Finnish company.
[00:25:59] Aydin Senkut: Finnish company, right?
[00:26:00] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Adyen Netherlands.
[00:26:02] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Canva Australia.
[00:26:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Yeah.
[00:26:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): You know, Shopify, I guess Canada.
[00:26:06] Mario (Last Name Unknown): But so many of these really do map in that way.
[00:26:09] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I wonder which other ones maybe come to mind for you that you think.
[00:26:12] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Only because I'm sort of a man of the world,
[00:26:15] Mario (Last Name Unknown): was I able to catch this before the folks that were still on Sand Hill Road?
[00:26:19] Mario (Last Name Unknown): A hundred percent.
[00:26:20] Aydin Senkut: I mean, even some of the more recent investments like NADN,
[00:26:24] in Berlin, Germany, or Times,
[00:26:27] in Dublin, Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.
[00:26:29] Aydin Senkut: Again, the funny thing is we did not invest in those companies
[00:26:33] Aydin Senkut: because of the country they were located in.
[00:26:36] Aydin Senkut: Sure.
[00:26:36] Aydin Senkut: We just were enamored with those founders
[00:26:39] Aydin Senkut: and we were enamored with the markets they were in.
[00:26:42] Aydin Senkut: And it just so happened that they were not in Silicon Valley.
[00:26:45] Aydin Senkut: So I think the adage was Silicon Valley is so strong
[00:26:48] Aydin Senkut: and it's such incredible talent density.
[00:26:50] Aydin Senkut: Don't get me wrong.
[00:26:51] Aydin Senkut: We have a lot of amazing companies ourselves in Silicon Valley.
[00:26:54] Aydin Senkut: That's where we're based.
[00:26:56] Aydin Senkut: But I always had this sense that,
[00:26:58] Aydin Senkut: hey, there is all this incredible talent around the world
[00:27:02] Aydin Senkut: and just because they're not in Silicon Valley,
[00:27:03] Aydin Senkut: doesn't mean that they can't build and scale a company,
[00:27:07] Aydin Senkut: the likes of which that we've seen in Silicon Valley.
[00:27:10] Aydin Senkut: It's a lot more common here,
[00:27:11] Aydin Senkut: but that doesn't mean that it can't happen anywhere else.
[00:27:14] Aydin Senkut: And lo and behold,
[00:27:15] Aydin Senkut: like we kept doing that company after company,
[00:27:18] Aydin Senkut: country after country.
[00:27:19] Aydin Senkut: And again, it's just one of those really cool things
[00:27:22] Aydin Senkut: because one of the things that people don't appreciate
[00:27:25] Aydin Senkut: as much about venture is not only do you have to be right,
[00:27:27] Aydin Senkut: but you have to be right before it's obvious to anybody else.
[00:27:31] Aydin Senkut: So this is something that I think we truly owned
[00:27:34] Aydin Senkut: in terms of, hey, talent is truly global.
[00:27:37] Aydin Senkut: Opportunity is truly global.
[00:27:39] Aydin Senkut: And I'm really happy that we kind of were the Vanguard.
[00:27:42] Aydin Senkut: And now if you look at some of the traditional VCs,
[00:27:45] Aydin Senkut: like Sequoia has many more offices
[00:27:47] Aydin Senkut: and it's much more international and even many funds
[00:27:51] Aydin Senkut: that said they would never invest internationally
[00:27:52] Aydin Senkut: or would require a local office
[00:27:54] Aydin Senkut: or would not invest like a cross-sector
[00:27:56] Aydin Senkut: or have now started doing that.
[00:27:58] Aydin Senkut: And I'd like to think that we were there first
[00:28:00] Aydin Senkut: and we were the original and kind of like,
[00:28:03] Aydin Senkut: essentially like shown people that idea can work.
[00:28:06] Aydin Senkut: Hmm.
[00:28:07] The other piece that I really wanted to dig into was,
[00:28:10] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you know, the extent of the diversification
[00:28:12] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that you practiced because I'm a much, much, much earlier investor
[00:28:17] Mario (Last Name Unknown): in my career have, you know,
[00:28:19] Mario (Last Name Unknown): a much less successful than you have,
[00:28:21] you know, the track record you've pulled together.
[00:28:22] Mario (Last Name Unknown): But I've always felt that it must be so hard
[00:28:26] Mario (Last Name Unknown): to create the level of outlier returns
[00:28:28] Mario (Last Name Unknown): with such a diffuse portfolio at scale.
[00:28:32] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Like maybe you can do it on an earlier fund.
[00:28:33] Mario (Last Name Unknown): But from what you were saying,
[00:28:35] Mario (Last Name Unknown): it sounds like you've managed to still with quite large portfolio size,
[00:28:40] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you know, maintain that level of performance.
[00:28:42] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Am I sort of understanding that right?
[00:28:43] Mario (Last Name Unknown): That you're still having sort of 70 companies per vintage?
[00:28:47] Look, I think we have about 35 to 60 companies per vintage.
[00:28:52] Aydin Senkut: Maybe, maybe four E's,
[00:28:54] Aydin Senkut: let's just say that if the traditional size is 2025,
[00:28:58] Aydin Senkut: Yep.
[00:28:59] Mario (Last Name Unknown): We have doubled it.
[00:29:00] Aydin Senkut: Let's call it 50, right?
[00:29:01] Aydin Senkut: Because we have some funds where we have a little bit less,
[00:29:03] Aydin Senkut: some funds we add a little bit more.
[00:29:06] The reality is the following.
[00:29:07] Aydin Senkut: When you have too small of a fund size,
[00:29:10] Aydin Senkut: what ends up happening is, first of all,
[00:29:12] Aydin Senkut: you don't have enough N,
[00:29:14] Aydin Senkut: right?
[00:29:14] Aydin Senkut: Like the chances that you're going to have great winners
[00:29:16] Aydin Senkut: from 20 companies versus 50,
[00:29:18] Aydin Senkut: there's a statistical difference that
[00:29:21] Aydin Senkut: 30 more shots on goal definitely makes a big difference.
[00:29:24] Aydin Senkut: The second thing is when you have a small portfolio
[00:29:27] Aydin Senkut: and all of them are high ownership and something goes wrong.
[00:29:31] Aydin Senkut: Now, like it essentially jeopardizes the rest of the portfolio.
[00:29:34] Aydin Senkut: What was really great about having at least like about 50 companies
[00:29:38] Aydin Senkut: is that we did not put the same size check
[00:29:41] Aydin Senkut: and all the same in every company.
[00:29:43] Aydin Senkut: It was always a little bit asymmetric in the sense that,
[00:29:46] Aydin Senkut: I mean, this is the thing about venture capital.
[00:29:48] Aydin Senkut: Sometimes like not only is everything so obvious and clear,
[00:29:51] Aydin Senkut: you can back up the truck and sometimes it's like,
[00:29:53] Aydin Senkut: wow, like I must be literally insane to be doing this
[00:29:57] Aydin Senkut: and you just do not want to like write a big check.
[00:29:59] Aydin Senkut: And so the way that we have managed risk
[00:30:02] Aydin Senkut: is to never treat everything as binary.
[00:30:05] Aydin Senkut: Like yes or no, we kind of treated as a spectrum.
[00:30:07] Aydin Senkut: So all of these things helped us.
[00:30:09] Aydin Senkut: And then the other thing that I was obsessed with,
[00:30:11] Aydin Senkut: the concept is a little bit talk in this book called
[00:30:14] Aydin Senkut: Antifragile by Nicholas Nassim Talab.
[00:30:16] Aydin Senkut: Yeah.
[00:30:17] Mario (Last Name Unknown): But, you know, I'm a very deep student of finance.
[00:30:20] Aydin Senkut: I was obsessed with investing.
[00:30:22] Aydin Senkut: And one of the things that I really wanted to show is
[00:30:26] Aydin Senkut: this business is all about risk.
[00:30:28] Aydin Senkut: And LPs and like, you know, venture capital is like,
[00:30:31] Aydin Senkut: well, like we have this one fund that's 10X,
[00:30:33] Aydin Senkut: but then sometimes there are bad ventages.
[00:30:35] Aydin Senkut: And to me, that was not acceptable.
[00:30:37] Aydin Senkut: I wanted every fund, every one of our funds to be successful.
[00:30:41] Aydin Senkut: And one of the ways I wanted to balance risk with the returns
[00:30:46] Aydin Senkut: is I thought if you have a higher end,
[00:30:48] Aydin Senkut: and let's say that you have a view of the world
[00:30:51] Aydin Senkut: that you kind of have a feeling that there are maybe five or 10 areas
[00:30:54] Aydin Senkut: where there are going to be great companies.
[00:30:55] Aydin Senkut: Instead of only choosing one, if you did all of them,
[00:30:58] Aydin Senkut: and we can talk more about this in general
[00:31:00] Aydin Senkut: as versus specialist battle,
[00:31:02] Aydin Senkut: but I thought, hey, wouldn't it be great
[00:31:05] Aydin Senkut: if we had a portfolio size and a strategy that allowed us
[00:31:08] Aydin Senkut: to be in all of the sectors that we believed in?
[00:31:11] Aydin Senkut: So then what's really great is a lot of these sectors
[00:31:14] Aydin Senkut: are not correlated to each other.
[00:31:16] Aydin Senkut: So depending on what happens in the world,
[00:31:19] Aydin Senkut: maybe not all of them will succeed,
[00:31:21] Aydin Senkut: but they will succeed in different ways,
[00:31:23] Aydin Senkut: in which case, like some of the great ones
[00:31:26] Aydin Senkut: can make up for the other ones that did not work out really well.
[00:31:30] Aydin Senkut: Versus in a much more concentrated portfolio,
[00:31:32] Aydin Senkut: in a much narrower focus,
[00:31:34] Aydin Senkut: if something goes wrong or if the world changes,
[00:31:37] Aydin Senkut: now you're stuck with a strategy that's completely out of fashion.
[00:31:41] Aydin Senkut: It's useless, similarly, like the portfolio
[00:31:43] Aydin Senkut: has too much exposure to one area,
[00:31:45] Aydin Senkut: and there is nothing else to make up for it.
[00:31:47] Aydin Senkut: So again, having grown up with a lot of risk
[00:31:51] Aydin Senkut: and haven't seen a lot of like crises
[00:31:54] Aydin Senkut: or companies that went out,
[00:31:56] Aydin Senkut: I wanted to have a strategy that was just not great for returns,
[00:31:59] Aydin Senkut: but also equally resilient.
[00:32:01] Aydin Senkut: And I thought this strategy can really work
[00:32:04] Aydin Senkut: and luckily for us, it really did work in this way.
[00:32:06] Aydin Senkut: And so you have that diversification for the resilience,
[00:32:09] Mario (Last Name Unknown): but it sounds like you're sizing the initial checks
[00:32:11] Mario (Last Name Unknown): very differently based on how much conviction
[00:32:14] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you have in the company to start with,
[00:32:16] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and then probably concentrating very aggressively
[00:32:19] Mario (Last Name Unknown): in the ones as they grow that you feel like have the most upside.
[00:32:23] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Is that sort of the way the pieces come together?
[00:32:25] Mario (Last Name Unknown): That's absolutely the concept.
[00:32:27] Aydin Senkut: And I think I also need to be humble
[00:32:29] Aydin Senkut: is that look, we've done really well with company picking
[00:32:32] Aydin Senkut: and concentration of capital is not easy.
[00:32:34] Aydin Senkut: And that's one of the reasons why we went
[00:32:36] Aydin Senkut: from $41 million fund to like $925 million fund today,
[00:32:42] Aydin Senkut: not to mention like the real inflation,
[00:32:44] Aydin Senkut: like I feel like we've gone at least 4x,
[00:32:47] Aydin Senkut: you look at the price of gold,
[00:32:48] Aydin Senkut: like 900 million of today is like $225 or $10, 15 years ago.
[00:32:54] Aydin Senkut: But the companies also need a lot more money today.
[00:32:59] Aydin Senkut: And so you kind of need a fund size
[00:33:01] Aydin Senkut: to not just be able to make enough bets,
[00:33:04] Aydin Senkut: but to have enough capital and reserve
[00:33:05] Aydin Senkut: that you still have some capital left over
[00:33:08] Aydin Senkut: to concentrate into the winners.
[00:33:09] Aydin Senkut: Yep, that totally makes sense.
[00:33:10] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Thanks for walking me through that.
[00:33:12] Mario (Last Name Unknown): We did talk a little bit about this,
[00:33:14] Mario (Last Name Unknown): this sort of generalist approach.
[00:33:15] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And for very obvious reasons,
[00:33:17] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I love that this is the way that you see the world.
[00:33:19] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And it makes instinctive sense to me.
[00:33:23] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Why do you think it's still so common in Silicon Valley
[00:33:27] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that so many people find it hard to imagine
[00:33:29] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that someone could be effective across so many sectors?
[00:33:31] Mario (Last Name Unknown): It is probably one of the hardest things to do in venture.
[00:33:34] Aydin Senkut: Honestly, if you ask me,
[00:33:37] Aydin Senkut: the one thing that I'm most proud of
[00:33:39] Aydin Senkut: is that we have literally touched virtually
[00:33:43] Aydin Senkut: every area of technology and we have succeeded,
[00:33:45] Aydin Senkut: even though we have zero background.
[00:33:47] Aydin Senkut: Like we've done, well, consumer, you can argue,
[00:33:50] Aydin Senkut: I was at Google, so I did have a little bit of a background.
[00:33:53] Aydin Senkut: But the companies we invested were maybe not related
[00:33:56] Aydin Senkut: to what Google was doing.
[00:33:57] Aydin Senkut: So like whether it's consumer or e-commerce or Fintech,
[00:34:01] Aydin Senkut: later on, AI, security, infrastructure, developer tools,
[00:34:06] Aydin Senkut: I mean, we tackled areas like hardware,
[00:34:08] Aydin Senkut: literally we had no background in.
[00:34:11] Aydin Senkut: And so I think like, I want to come back
[00:34:13] Aydin Senkut: to this generalist approach versus specialist approach.
[00:34:17] Aydin Senkut: The way that I think about them
[00:34:18] Aydin Senkut: is a very first principles way.
[00:34:20] Aydin Senkut: So I think most people misunderstand generalists.
[00:34:23] Aydin Senkut: Generalists is not about, okay, we have this big area,
[00:34:25] Aydin Senkut: we're going to spray and pray and we get lucky
[00:34:27] Aydin Senkut: and after we get lucky, we can say, well, of course,
[00:34:30] Aydin Senkut: we were right, that is not the point.
[00:34:32] Aydin Senkut: I think the way that I see generalists is different.
[00:34:35] Aydin Senkut: The way that I think about it is generalists,
[00:34:36] Aydin Senkut: you start from a much larger universe.
[00:34:39] Aydin Senkut: So imagine you and I are both investors.
[00:34:42] Aydin Senkut: And there are two different ways we can go about the world,
[00:34:45] Aydin Senkut: which is, hey, here's the universe of all great companies.
[00:34:48] Aydin Senkut: The generalist approach says, we're going to start
[00:34:50] Aydin Senkut: with all of them and then based on what we think
[00:34:53] Aydin Senkut: like has the highest potential of growth
[00:34:56] Aydin Senkut: and what's happening in the markets,
[00:34:57] Aydin Senkut: we're going to hone in on the ones
[00:34:59] Aydin Senkut: that are best in a risk reward.
[00:35:02] Aydin Senkut: I think what people misunderstand about generalists
[00:35:04] Aydin Senkut: is because you're starting with the top of funnel
[00:35:07] Aydin Senkut: that is so large, does not mean you're trying
[00:35:09] Aydin Senkut: to boil the ocean.
[00:35:10] Aydin Senkut: It means that you have a much larger universe to pick from.
[00:35:13] Aydin Senkut: And the conventional wisdom says,
[00:35:15] Aydin Senkut: well, you are not qualified to pick the best ones
[00:35:18] Aydin Senkut: from a large universe because you're not specialists.
[00:35:21] Aydin Senkut: And I think that wisdom is not right
[00:35:24] Aydin Senkut: and we have practiced it now like we're on our 10th fund
[00:35:27] Aydin Senkut: and I think we have great data to show
[00:35:29] Aydin Senkut: that you do not have to be an expert to make good picks.
[00:35:32] Aydin Senkut: The specialist instead says, hey,
[00:35:34] Aydin Senkut: you know what, the specialist approach will save you
[00:35:37] Aydin Senkut: because you know the sector so well
[00:35:39] Aydin Senkut: that you're going to pick the best companies.
[00:35:41] Aydin Senkut: I think in nuance that it misses,
[00:35:43] Aydin Senkut: it means that now you're starting
[00:35:45] Aydin Senkut: with a very small group to begin with, right?
[00:35:48] Aydin Senkut: Like let's say that, hey, it's only like enterprise.
[00:35:50] Aydin Senkut: It's only this.
[00:35:51] Aydin Senkut: Well, in a large universe of companies
[00:35:53] Aydin Senkut: that's a small percentage.
[00:35:55] Aydin Senkut: So first of all, you're starting with a much smaller base,
[00:35:58] Aydin Senkut: right?
[00:35:59] Aydin Senkut: And then on top of it, you're looking for outlier companies.
[00:36:03] Aydin Senkut: Well, in the general universe,
[00:36:05] Aydin Senkut: you're going to have cons more outliers.
[00:36:07] Aydin Senkut: In a specialist area, mostly what's going to happen
[00:36:10] Aydin Senkut: is well, we kind of ran out of outliers,
[00:36:12] Aydin Senkut: but we basically said we are going to specialize.
[00:36:14] Aydin Senkut: Now you're going to find more and more niches
[00:36:17] Aydin Senkut: that go into smaller and smaller parts of the market.
[00:36:20] Aydin Senkut: And so like instead of investing in all number ones,
[00:36:23] Aydin Senkut: now you're investing, well, we need to invest in number seven
[00:36:26] Aydin Senkut: because we told the world, you know, we're a fintech firm.
[00:36:29] Aydin Senkut: Like, why would you like, I want to invest in Stripe
[00:36:31] Aydin Senkut: or Adian, I don't want to invest in Stripe or Adian
[00:36:34] Aydin Senkut: of Indonesia or Malaysia, that is not what gets me up in the morning.
[00:36:38] Aydin Senkut: Like, I want to find like companies
[00:36:40] Aydin Senkut: that completely dominate the sectors around the world.
[00:36:43] Aydin Senkut: So that's the concept behind generalist versus specialist.
[00:36:47] Aydin Senkut: The other interesting thing that most people never talk about
[00:36:51] Aydin Senkut: or think about is that it's also very risky to be specialists,
[00:36:55] Aydin Senkut: right?
[00:36:56] Aydin Senkut: Like, imagine if you were a consumer person,
[00:36:58] Aydin Senkut: there was quite a long time where consumer produced
[00:37:01] Aydin Senkut: a few good companies, but the rest of the companies did not do well.
[00:37:04] Aydin Senkut: Or enterprise was really, really hot.
[00:37:06] Aydin Senkut: I mean, 10 years ago, SaaS, it was all about SaaS.
[00:37:09] Aydin Senkut: Today, I mean, it's kind of like a debt sentence to be in SaaS.
[00:37:13] Aydin Senkut: AI is disrupting every area of SaaS.
[00:37:16] Aydin Senkut: And if you basically stuck to that and you were a SaaS fund,
[00:37:19] Aydin Senkut: you're going to have a very hard time.
[00:37:21] Aydin Senkut: So this is the curse of being a very narrow specialist
[00:37:25] Aydin Senkut: that not only does it limit your options,
[00:37:28] Aydin Senkut: but it is also always at the mercy of the markets.
[00:37:30] Aydin Senkut: And if something happens, it does not give you a lot of options.
[00:37:33] Aydin Senkut: So now you have to go back to your LPs.
[00:37:35] Aydin Senkut: Like, actually, I was wrong to be a specialist in this.
[00:37:38] Aydin Senkut: Now I'm going to go to this Neurion.
[00:37:40] Aydin Senkut: They're like, how are you going to do this Neurion?
[00:37:42] Aydin Senkut: And do you see how it works versus we always said we're a generalist.
[00:37:46] Aydin Senkut: So we were always true to our world.
[00:37:48] Aydin Senkut: Yes.
[00:37:48] Aydin Senkut: We always said we're going to pick from a large universe.
[00:37:51] Aydin Senkut: But if you look at all of our 10 funds,
[00:37:53] Aydin Senkut: the mix on each, every single one of them is different.
[00:37:56] Aydin Senkut: And we perfectly picked all the interesting markets
[00:38:00] Aydin Senkut: that we thought were poised for great growth,
[00:38:03] Aydin Senkut: basically five to 10 years before that growth actually happened.
[00:38:07] Yes.
[00:38:08] Mario (Last Name Unknown): The specialist is able to do what is locally the best deal
[00:38:12] Mario (Last Name Unknown): versus the generalist can do what is absolutely the best deal.
[00:38:15] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Perhaps there's a tradeoff in some level of precision
[00:38:17] Mario (Last Name Unknown): between the two you could argue, but I'm not even convinced
[00:38:20] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that's always the case.
[00:38:22] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I wonder what this approach sort of says
[00:38:25] Mario (Last Name Unknown): about your investing lens as you might define it.
[00:38:29] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Do you find yourself much more founder driven
[00:38:33] Mario (Last Name Unknown): than your peers, for example?
[00:38:35] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Because I think that's one of the ways
[00:38:37] Mario (Last Name Unknown): the generalist strategies can work,
[00:38:39] Mario (Last Name Unknown): is if you're able to almost pierce through the really thorny
[00:38:42] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and complex details of a certain sector, which it's impossible
[00:38:46] Mario (Last Name Unknown): for you to gain the amount of industry knowledge
[00:38:49] Mario (Last Name Unknown): as someone who spent 20 years in two hours with a founder.
[00:38:53] But if you're able to analyze this person in a certain way,
[00:38:56] maybe it doesn't matter as much.
[00:38:57] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And so I wonder how you sort of find those short cuts
[00:39:02] Mario (Last Name Unknown): or those efficiencies.
[00:39:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Look, my personal take on that is people are lazy,
[00:39:07] Aydin Senkut: so they just want to look at success and say,
[00:39:09] Aydin Senkut: oh, all the success it was because of this one factor.
[00:39:12] Aydin Senkut: It's so much easier to say, it was all only the founders.
[00:39:16] Aydin Senkut: Now, having said that, let me tell you that
[00:39:19] Aydin Senkut: the most important ingredient in all of that is the founders.
[00:39:23] Aydin Senkut: In fact, going back to what you asked me about Larry
[00:39:25] Aydin Senkut: and Sergei is that the other cool thing about Larry
[00:39:28] Aydin Senkut: and Sergei were not just that they spent tens of thousands
[00:39:32] Aydin Senkut: of hours and they were really good at what they did,
[00:39:35] Aydin Senkut: but they could explain to you the most complex things
[00:39:38] Aydin Senkut: in less than a minute and make you feel smart.
[00:39:40] What I want to say is, look, let's just put something to rest.
[00:39:45] Aydin Senkut: I think without exceptional founders
[00:39:46] Aydin Senkut: is very, very difficult to succeed.
[00:39:48] Aydin Senkut: So founders definitely is the foundation that we look for.
[00:39:52] Aydin Senkut: But I'm going to say, yes, but an ad that even some
[00:39:58] Aydin Senkut: of the very best founders, sometimes when
[00:40:00] Aydin Senkut: they faced a very difficult market or at a really bad time,
[00:40:05] Aydin Senkut: things have not worked out really well.
[00:40:07] We can always find a few things where like, oh, yeah,
[00:40:10] Aydin Senkut: but the best founders pivot and find a way, yes,
[00:40:13] Aydin Senkut: but statistically speaking, you're looking at one or 5%
[00:40:17] Aydin Senkut: or 10% of the cases.
[00:40:18] Aydin Senkut: Nobody ever talks about the 90% of the cases
[00:40:21] Aydin Senkut: where the pivot didn't work.
[00:40:23] Aydin Senkut: Now, we're always here to make it happen
[00:40:24] Aydin Senkut: and to support the founders.
[00:40:26] Aydin Senkut: All I'm going to say is that it's kind of like you look
[00:40:30] Aydin Senkut: at a championship team and yeah, it was all the quarterback
[00:40:33] Aydin Senkut: or it was only the coach.
[00:40:34] Aydin Senkut: The reality is, yes, it was the quarterback, it was the coach.
[00:40:37] Aydin Senkut: It's the 100,000 hours that they train.
[00:40:40] Aydin Senkut: It's the fact that they pick different strategies.
[00:40:42] Aydin Senkut: It's the fact that they took the right risk
[00:40:44] Aydin Senkut: at like 15 different games.
[00:40:46] Aydin Senkut: We really want to simplify things and say, okay, that's it.
[00:40:50] Aydin Senkut: Like we found the secret.
[00:40:52] Aydin Senkut: The reality is there is like 20 secrets.
[00:40:54] Aydin Senkut: There is so much more nuance that goes into it.
[00:40:57] Aydin Senkut: And again, like not to take it away from the founders.
[00:41:00] Aydin Senkut: I mean, I have so many great examples of founders
[00:41:03] Aydin Senkut: where like when there is nothing,
[00:41:05] Aydin Senkut: they will something to existence
[00:41:07] Aydin Senkut: and it's just incredible how they're able to do that.
[00:41:10] Aydin Senkut: A good example of that is Scott Morton at Revel.
[00:41:12] Aydin Senkut: I mean, he was the top engineer at SpaceX,
[00:41:15] Aydin Senkut: wrote all the software for fucking records.
[00:41:17] Aydin Senkut: And then one day he's like, you know what?
[00:41:19] Aydin Senkut: There is no definitive infrastructure company
[00:41:22] Aydin Senkut: for critical hardware, including space
[00:41:24] Aydin Senkut: and other industries like utilities, dams, all of that.
[00:41:27] Aydin Senkut: And literally there is nothing that exists.
[00:41:30] Aydin Senkut: He just says, I'm gonna do it.
[00:41:31] Aydin Senkut: And all of a sudden, like he's able to attract incredible talent.
[00:41:34] Aydin Senkut: And next thing we know in like 12 to 18 months,
[00:41:38] Aydin Senkut: he has his first prototypes already working.
[00:41:40] Aydin Senkut: I mean, I've never seen a founder like be able to do that.
[00:41:43] Aydin Senkut: It's a little bit of the equivalent of like Moses went
[00:41:46] Aydin Senkut: to Egypt and parted the sea.
[00:41:48] Aydin Senkut: We literally are working with founders like that today.
[00:41:50] Aydin Senkut: And I will never take that away from them.
[00:41:52] Aydin Senkut: But what market they tackle
[00:41:56] Aydin Senkut: and at what time they tackle is also equally important.
[00:41:59] Aydin Senkut: For instance, I think we are essentially
[00:42:02] Aydin Senkut: in the beginning years of a huge space age.
[00:42:05] Aydin Senkut: We're gonna have tons more satellites.
[00:42:07] Aydin Senkut: We're gonna have a lot more things happening in space.
[00:42:10] Aydin Senkut: So this is actually very timely
[00:42:11] Aydin Senkut: because SpaceX had to do everything they did from scratch.
[00:42:16] Aydin Senkut: And interestingly like at Google,
[00:42:17] Aydin Senkut: we did a lot of things custom for which there is like,
[00:42:20] Aydin Senkut: now platforms today, we forest us build our own thing
[00:42:23] Aydin Senkut: which Amazon with AWS turned into a huge cloud business.
[00:42:27] Aydin Senkut: We literally had our internal AWS cloud 25 years ago.
[00:42:31] Aydin Senkut: We build it, we build everything from scratch.
[00:42:33] Aydin Senkut: Now you don't have to do everything from scratch.
[00:42:35] Aydin Senkut: So it's just to say that, yes, everything starts
[00:42:39] Aydin Senkut: with amazing founders, but there is also a lot more nuance to it.
[00:42:42] Aydin Senkut: Yes, absolutely.
[00:42:43] Mario (Last Name Unknown): To push on that question, maybe a little more.
[00:42:47] Have you ever seen a situation in which you felt
[00:42:50] Mario (Last Name Unknown): it was a truly top basis point founder
[00:42:54] Mario (Last Name Unknown): who didn't find a way to succeed?
[00:42:57] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Maybe not even that company, but the next one.
[00:43:00] Mario (Last Name Unknown): My feeling is that if you find someone that good,
[00:43:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): ultimately they almost always figure it out
[00:43:05] Mario (Last Name Unknown): somewhere along the line.
[00:43:07] Aydin Senkut: I think one of the things is yes, they do figure it out
[00:43:09] Aydin Senkut: and I will not take it away from them.
[00:43:12] Aydin Senkut: And I think what some of the things that happens is like,
[00:43:15] Aydin Senkut: look, I mean, everybody's dream is like,
[00:43:18] Aydin Senkut: we're gonna be great and take the company public,
[00:43:20] Aydin Senkut: but the reality is sometimes you know,
[00:43:22] Aydin Senkut: you're part of an acquisition and your product is still serving,
[00:43:26] Aydin Senkut: you know, hundreds of millions, if not billions of people.
[00:43:29] Aydin Senkut: So you have succeeded, maybe the company didn't go public,
[00:43:32] Aydin Senkut: but it's still succeeded in the way you originally dreamed of.
[00:43:35] Aydin Senkut: So I guess the thing is, look,
[00:43:37] Aydin Senkut: the very best founders do figure it out and do make it work.
[00:43:41] But it might not be in the way that people have expected.
[00:43:44] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Yes, yes.
[00:43:45] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I imagine you've had to reinvent Felicis a lot over the years,
[00:43:50] Mario (Last Name Unknown): as the founder of it, as you look back on the decade
[00:43:55] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and a half plus now,
[00:43:57] what have been the different sort of form factors
[00:43:59] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and maybe what have been the hardest transition points
[00:44:02] Mario (Last Name Unknown): along that journey?
[00:44:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Frankly, imagine that one of the first transition points
[00:44:06] Mario (Last Name Unknown): of going from a solo GP to entrusting other people
[00:44:11] Mario (Last Name Unknown): to make investments and to share this sort of mental space
[00:44:14] Mario (Last Name Unknown): with you must have been a really significant one.
[00:44:17] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Definitely, it was a very steep
[00:44:19] Aydin Senkut: and also very gratifying learning experience,
[00:44:22] Aydin Senkut: but I think that needs to take us back to our origins.
[00:44:27] Aydin Senkut: And what was really interesting is,
[00:44:29] Aydin Senkut: you and I just talked a little while ago about strategy
[00:44:31] Aydin Senkut: and how we try to be different than standard VCs.
[00:44:34] Aydin Senkut: So now I'm gonna go to the heart of it
[00:44:37] Aydin Senkut: and it is, I looked at all the other VCs
[00:44:40] Aydin Senkut: and I really tried to think,
[00:44:42] Aydin Senkut: like what is one thing that all of these incredible VCs
[00:44:46] Aydin Senkut: that came before my time, not good at,
[00:44:49] Aydin Senkut: and what is one single thing that could be my true north
[00:44:52] Aydin Senkut: and define our franchise for decades to come.
[00:44:55] Aydin Senkut: And what I basically ended up at is traditional VCs
[00:44:59] Aydin Senkut: at the moment they succeed.
[00:45:01] Aydin Senkut: They become very rigid and stagnant.
[00:45:03] Aydin Senkut: All of them had some kind of a turning point.
[00:45:06] All of them started with a dream
[00:45:08] Aydin Senkut: and then they have some really great bets
[00:45:10] Aydin Senkut: like incredible returns and right at that point,
[00:45:13] Aydin Senkut: they are like don't change anything.
[00:45:15] Aydin Senkut: You know what, I was walking my dog and whatever,
[00:45:19] Aydin Senkut: like it was the morning and we were based and like,
[00:45:21] Aydin Senkut: and then okay, great, this work,
[00:45:23] Aydin Senkut: so absolutely keep it, don't change anything.
[00:45:26] Aydin Senkut: I'll piece really like it because clearly something worked.
[00:45:29] Aydin Senkut: And what people don't understand
[00:45:30] Aydin Senkut: and what I observe at Google with super high growth
[00:45:34] Aydin Senkut: is that that's actually when you're most vulnerable.
[00:45:37] Aydin Senkut: Actually, that's the point at which you should be willing
[00:45:40] Aydin Senkut: to question everything and figure out like anything
[00:45:44] Aydin Senkut: that can be improved and changed
[00:45:45] Aydin Senkut: because if you don't do that, somebody else will
[00:45:48] Aydin Senkut: and you will get disrupted.
[00:45:50] Aydin Senkut: So that's both the blessing and the curse
[00:45:52] Aydin Senkut: of Silicon Valley and technology is that it's always like crazy.
[00:45:56] Aydin Senkut: It's always a battlefield.
[00:45:58] Aydin Senkut: You think you won the battle and then somebody braver
[00:46:00] Aydin Senkut: and somebody crazier comes along.
[00:46:02] Aydin Senkut: And if you haven't adapted, like all of a sudden,
[00:46:04] Aydin Senkut: you're a dinosaur and then you get crushed
[00:46:06] Aydin Senkut: or killed in the battlefield.
[00:46:07] Aydin Senkut: So I basically said, I can fail at everything,
[00:46:12] Aydin Senkut: but one thing that will define this franchise
[00:46:14] Aydin Senkut: that we will never, ever fail or cannot fail
[00:46:17] Aydin Senkut: is learning and adapting rapidly.
[00:46:19] Aydin Senkut: I literally said, that's our constitution.
[00:46:22] Aydin Senkut: If our firm is a constitution, that is our constitution.
[00:46:25] Aydin Senkut: But by the way, this means that learning and adapting rapidly
[00:46:29] Aydin Senkut: doesn't mean that your strategy changes all the time.
[00:46:31] Aydin Senkut: It doesn't mean that you're flailing and spraying and praying.
[00:46:35] Aydin Senkut: It just means that it's the same strategy,
[00:46:37] Aydin Senkut: but you can apply it in different ways.
[00:46:40] Aydin Senkut: And do you see how it's perfect with the generalist approach
[00:46:43] Aydin Senkut: because that essentially gave us the flexibility
[00:46:46] Aydin Senkut: of when we saw opportunities in the market
[00:46:48] Aydin Senkut: and I'll give you an interesting example
[00:46:51] Aydin Senkut: where there was a really interesting turning point
[00:46:53] Aydin Senkut: in the history of Felices where we didn't
[00:46:55] Aydin Senkut: analysis of all the successes and realized
[00:46:57] Aydin Senkut: we had nothing in AI or very few things in AI
[00:47:00] Aydin Senkut: and security and infrastructure.
[00:47:02] Aydin Senkut: So we made a hard pivot into those areas.
[00:47:05] Aydin Senkut: I feel like the defining aspect of what we do
[00:47:07] Aydin Senkut: is our strategy always remain the same
[00:47:09] Aydin Senkut: are differentiator or being the trusted brand by founders
[00:47:14] Aydin Senkut: and doing right by founders always stayed the same
[00:47:17] Aydin Senkut: and we scaled it, but all other aspects we learned
[00:47:20] Aydin Senkut: and adapted, right?
[00:47:21] Aydin Senkut: Like we started as a solar firm, then we were three people.
[00:47:24] Aydin Senkut: Now we have research.
[00:47:25] Aydin Senkut: We're doing 20 different things
[00:47:27] Aydin Senkut: that I would have never even imagined
[00:47:29] Aydin Senkut: that we would be doing today.
[00:47:30] Aydin Senkut: Yes.
[00:47:31] Aydin Senkut: Strategy, same generalist approach,
[00:47:33] Aydin Senkut: but the practice and application
[00:47:35] Aydin Senkut: and what sector we choose today versus 10 years ago
[00:47:38] Aydin Senkut: is so different.
[00:47:39] Aydin Senkut: The team is very different.
[00:47:41] Aydin Senkut: What I love about that is the thing
[00:47:43] Aydin Senkut: that kills civilizations and cultures
[00:47:45] Aydin Senkut: is the inability to adapt.
[00:47:48] Like why did the Roman Empire die?
[00:47:49] Aydin Senkut: Like why did all of these great civilization
[00:47:52] Aydin Senkut: let go become extinct?
[00:47:53] Aydin Senkut: It's because they could not keep up with the time.
[00:47:55] Aydin Senkut: And so that to me was the thing that
[00:47:57] Aydin Senkut: if we are the fastest adapting, fastest learning team,
[00:48:02] Aydin Senkut: culture, adventure, we will always have a place
[00:48:06] Aydin Senkut: in the upper echelon of venture
[00:48:07] Aydin Senkut: as long as we are able to make it there.
[00:48:09] Amazing.
[00:48:10] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I love that theory, this willingness
[00:48:11] Mario (Last Name Unknown): to rethink things and prevent against that stagnation
[00:48:15] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that as you say success often breeds.
[00:48:19] Mario (Last Name Unknown): On the subject of avoiding stagnation,
[00:48:22] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you guys have been I think very aggressive
[00:48:25] Mario (Last Name Unknown): in investing in AI
[00:48:27] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and doing it at almost every altitude
[00:48:30] Mario (Last Name Unknown): it feels like you have crucible at the energy layer.
[00:48:33] Mario (Last Name Unknown): You have some orchestration plays with NADN
[00:48:36] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and infrastructure, super base
[00:48:39] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and some of these bespoke model companies.
[00:48:42] Mario (Last Name Unknown): How have you thought about the right way
[00:48:44] Mario (Last Name Unknown): for a felices to be involved in this
[00:48:46] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and why have you been willing to lean in so aggressively
[00:48:50] Mario (Last Name Unknown): such that it seems like a lot.
[00:48:53] Mario (Last Name Unknown): That is, I would imagine the majority
[00:48:55] Mario (Last Name Unknown): of the firm's activity at this point.
[00:48:57] 100%.
[00:48:58] Aydin Senkut: This is a really great thread
[00:49:00] Aydin Senkut: because I think about it a lot
[00:49:02] Aydin Senkut: and I was just talking to a VC club
[00:49:05] Aydin Senkut: at a really well-known university
[00:49:08] Aydin Senkut: and I'll tell the students the following.
[00:49:10] Aydin Senkut: Venture business is very simple.
[00:49:11] Aydin Senkut: There is only one thing you need to do
[00:49:13] Aydin Senkut: which is you need to find companies
[00:49:15] Aydin Senkut: that have hockey stick,
[00:49:17] Aydin Senkut: revenue inflection curves
[00:49:19] Aydin Senkut: and be in these companies
[00:49:20] Aydin Senkut: before the steep part of the inflection happens.
[00:49:23] Aydin Senkut: That's it, that's venture.
[00:49:25] Aydin Senkut: I didn't less than a minute.
[00:49:26] Aydin Senkut: You do that right and consistently,
[00:49:29] Aydin Senkut: no matter what you do, you're going to succeed.
[00:49:31] Aydin Senkut: Notice I did not talk anything about sectors.
[00:49:33] Aydin Senkut: I did not say anything about stages.
[00:49:35] Aydin Senkut: I did not say anything about the economy
[00:49:37] Aydin Senkut: or markets, nothing else.
[00:49:39] Aydin Senkut: I did not say anything about valuations.
[00:49:41] Aydin Senkut: All of these things are excuses.
[00:49:43] Aydin Senkut: Sometimes it's a great analogy in F1.
[00:49:45] Aydin Senkut: Like, you know what, they complain.
[00:49:48] Aydin Senkut: Oh, it's terrible, it's rain
[00:49:50] Aydin Senkut: and the best drivers,
[00:49:51] Aydin Senkut: whether it's dry, whether it's rain,
[00:49:54] Aydin Senkut: whether it's a challenging circuit,
[00:49:55] Aydin Senkut: whether it's night,
[00:49:56] Aydin Senkut: whether it's day, whether it's street,
[00:49:58] Aydin Senkut: whether it's like whatever.
[00:49:59] Aydin Senkut: This is the thing that comes to my mind
[00:50:02] Aydin Senkut: is that, you know, people complain about the markets.
[00:50:04] Aydin Senkut: Oh, AI is a bubble.
[00:50:06] Aydin Senkut: No, valuations were really high.
[00:50:08] Aydin Senkut: And we can find companies
[00:50:09] Aydin Senkut: not only across all the sectors and all the Geos,
[00:50:12] Aydin Senkut: but also when the markets are up,
[00:50:13] Aydin Senkut: when the markets are down,
[00:50:14] Aydin Senkut: when it's really expensive,
[00:50:15] Aydin Senkut: when people think there is a bubble.
[00:50:17] Aydin Senkut: Because what they're not doing is
[00:50:19] Aydin Senkut: they're basically looking at things
[00:50:20] Aydin Senkut: that they can't control,
[00:50:22] Aydin Senkut: but there has no impact in how they choose companies.
[00:50:25] Aydin Senkut: The only thing that matters for the companies
[00:50:27] Aydin Senkut: is whether you can find a hockey stick curve.
[00:50:29] Aydin Senkut: So now, how does this translate into AI?
[00:50:31] Aydin Senkut: In my 20 years of doing this,
[00:50:33] Aydin Senkut: AIH is the first one
[00:50:36] Aydin Senkut: where I have seen these growth curves,
[00:50:39] Aydin Senkut: the hockey stick growth curves,
[00:50:40] Aydin Senkut: happen at the most insane velocity
[00:50:43] Aydin Senkut: and the sharpest steepness, right?
[00:50:46] Aydin Senkut: Like, to give you an example,
[00:50:47] Aydin Senkut: even like the Google Edge,
[00:50:49] Aydin Senkut: Google went public in six years.
[00:50:50] Aydin Senkut: Shopify went public in six years.
[00:50:52] Aydin Senkut: I need to look up the exact time,
[00:50:54] Aydin Senkut: but like these companies got
[00:50:55] Aydin Senkut: 200 million of revenues,
[00:50:57] Aydin Senkut: let's say between four and eight years.
[00:50:59] Aydin Senkut: 10, 20 years ago,
[00:51:00] Aydin Senkut: getting to 100 million of revenues in four to eight years
[00:51:04] Aydin Senkut: was considered exceptional.
[00:51:06] Aydin Senkut: Today, you have not won,
[00:51:08] Aydin Senkut: but multiple companies,
[00:51:09] Aydin Senkut: maybe soon to be dozens,
[00:51:11] Aydin Senkut: that are rocketing from zero to 100 million on revenue
[00:51:14] Aydin Senkut: in 12 months or less.
[00:51:15] Aydin Senkut: Not only are they doing that,
[00:51:17] Aydin Senkut: they are doing that
[00:51:19] Aydin Senkut: with probably about 10% or less of the people
[00:51:22] Aydin Senkut: that traditional companies did.
[00:51:24] Aydin Senkut: Because one of the great things about AI,
[00:51:25] Aydin Senkut: like you would have hired in so many different roles,
[00:51:28] Aydin Senkut: and like I don't need to hire
[00:51:29] Aydin Senkut: in that many different roles.
[00:51:30] Aydin Senkut: Like there are some like edge things
[00:51:32] Aydin Senkut: that I can like rely on AI,
[00:51:34] Aydin Senkut: and instead of like a team of 100,
[00:51:37] Aydin Senkut: I can do this with a team of 10.
[00:51:38] Aydin Senkut: Now you can move a lot faster.
[00:51:40] Aydin Senkut: You don't have to hire a lot of middle management.
[00:51:42] Aydin Senkut: So it's not just a steep revenue growth,
[00:51:45] Aydin Senkut: but also you can probably do that more profitably.
[00:51:48] Aydin Senkut: And this is what I want to get to is that people again,
[00:51:51] Aydin Senkut: are very lazy and they're only looking at one aspect
[00:51:53] Aydin Senkut: and drawing conclusions.
[00:51:55] Aydin Senkut: Oh, AI, it certainly must be a bubble.
[00:51:57] Aydin Senkut: You know, that's not gonna work.
[00:51:58] Aydin Senkut: And yes, it's true.
[00:51:59] Aydin Senkut: There are companies that do not have
[00:52:02] Aydin Senkut: a durable technical advantage,
[00:52:03] Aydin Senkut: but there are very few companies
[00:52:05] Aydin Senkut: that not only do they have the durable technical advantage,
[00:52:08] Aydin Senkut: not only do they have growth,
[00:52:09] Aydin Senkut: but they're also gonna be able to get the profitability.
[00:52:12] Aydin Senkut: And if they do,
[00:52:13] Aydin Senkut: they're gonna become invincible
[00:52:14] Aydin Senkut: and it's not gonna be bubble.
[00:52:15] Aydin Senkut: And this is the reason why, for instance, you know, like 2021,
[00:52:19] Aydin Senkut: people can't stop talking about it.
[00:52:21] Aydin Senkut: You know, we made some of our best investments in 2021
[00:52:24] Aydin Senkut: when the market was at its peak.
[00:52:26] Aydin Senkut: And everybody thought we were crazy,
[00:52:28] Aydin Senkut: that's gonna be a horrible vintage.
[00:52:30] Aydin Senkut: Those companies are gonna be like,
[00:52:31] Aydin Senkut: I cannot tell you how many LP meetings I had to take
[00:52:35] Aydin Senkut: to explain to them, but no, like we can pick companies
[00:52:39] Aydin Senkut: even in that environment.
[00:52:40] Aydin Senkut: And we did, like I actually had to look back
[00:52:43] Aydin Senkut: just to make sure whether it's an A&N or super base,
[00:52:46] Aydin Senkut: those were some of the most expensive investments
[00:52:49] Aydin Senkut: we've ever made.
[00:52:50] Aydin Senkut: Highest valuation and conventional wisdom is
[00:52:53] Aydin Senkut: that certainly is not gonna work out.
[00:52:55] Aydin Senkut: And it worked out.
[00:52:56] Aydin Senkut: Not only did it work out,
[00:52:58] Aydin Senkut: it worked out exceptionally well.
[00:52:59] Aydin Senkut: Despite the fact that we paid maybe 10x
[00:53:02] Aydin Senkut: what people thought we would pay,
[00:53:04] Aydin Senkut: the company's grew their revenues by 100 to 500x.
[00:53:07] Aydin Senkut: And so that means that what on surface look like a terrible move
[00:53:12] Aydin Senkut: ended up being a genius move
[00:53:13] Aydin Senkut: because everybody else were like cold on their tracks.
[00:53:17] Aydin Senkut: We were aggressively pursuing those companies
[00:53:19] Aydin Senkut: and those funders are like, you know what?
[00:53:21] Aydin Senkut: Nobody at the courage or the insight
[00:53:24] Aydin Senkut: or the imagination to see what we see, but you did.
[00:53:28] Aydin Senkut: And that's basically our brand today, right?
[00:53:30] Aydin Senkut: Like when funders look at our brand and our firm,
[00:53:33] Aydin Senkut: what I want them to see is like,
[00:53:35] Aydin Senkut: these people have been brave enough,
[00:53:37] Aydin Senkut: even when things were tough,
[00:53:38] Aydin Senkut: even when valuations were crazy,
[00:53:40] Aydin Senkut: even when markets were really crazy,
[00:53:42] Aydin Senkut: they still go to their funders
[00:53:43] Aydin Senkut: and have this incredible conviction
[00:53:45] Aydin Senkut: and partner with them,
[00:53:46] Aydin Senkut: even in those most difficult situations.
[00:53:49] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Okay, so interesting.
[00:53:49] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I wanna make sure I'm sort of following
[00:53:52] Mario (Last Name Unknown): the way this hangs together because it strikes me as,
[00:53:55] Mario (Last Name Unknown): on the one hand, it's, you know,
[00:53:56] Mario (Last Name Unknown): there are parts of it that are on trend,
[00:53:58] Mario (Last Name Unknown): but I think there's also a depth behind it
[00:54:00] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that is maybe built on some contrarian principles.
[00:54:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): So I think one of the things you're saying is that yes,
[00:54:06] Mario (Last Name Unknown): maybe there are these companies
[00:54:07] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that are getting done at two 300X revenue,
[00:54:12] Mario (Last Name Unknown): but as long as you can pick the ones
[00:54:14] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that are actually likely to have a durable technical mode,
[00:54:19] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you're happy to pay even a few years,
[00:54:21] Mario (Last Name Unknown): let's say in advance of where they're, you know,
[00:54:24] Mario (Last Name Unknown): let's say reasonable valuation
[00:54:26] Mario (Last Name Unknown): or durable multiple might settle at,
[00:54:28] Mario (Last Name Unknown): because you think they might really be
[00:54:30] Mario (Last Name Unknown): sort of game-changing, world-changing companies.
[00:54:32] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And the history of Felicia suggests that even in these hot markets,
[00:54:37] Mario (Last Name Unknown): when other folks have leaned in and gotten burned,
[00:54:41] Mario (Last Name Unknown): you've managed to be strong enough on the selection
[00:54:45] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that those ventages still look good.
[00:54:47] Is that right?
[00:54:48] Aydin Senkut: 100% and the best way to summarize it is follows
[00:54:51] Aydin Senkut: just so that the math makes sense.
[00:54:54] I'm gonna simplify it a little bit.
[00:54:56] Aydin Senkut: Let's just call it VC101.
[00:54:59] Aydin Senkut: And here's the interesting thing.
[00:55:01] There has been many instances
[00:55:03] Aydin Senkut: where we picked the company just right,
[00:55:06] and we were off by a 10X on the entry valuation.
[00:55:09] Aydin Senkut: So everybody looked at only that side
[00:55:11] Aydin Senkut: and said there is no way it's gonna work.
[00:55:14] Aydin Senkut: But what they missed is the revenue growth
[00:55:16] Aydin Senkut: that materialized after was 30X, 50X, 100X.
[00:55:21] Aydin Senkut: So while we were 10X wrong on the entry price,
[00:55:25] Aydin Senkut: we were absolutely like on the estimating the revenue growth,
[00:55:29] Aydin Senkut: by even a much, much larger factor.
[00:55:31] Aydin Senkut: And so that's the thing, like to be successful,
[00:55:34] Aydin Senkut: it's not only that you need to be right on the valuation side.
[00:55:38] Aydin Senkut: In fact, it's the opposite
[00:55:39] Aydin Senkut: because if you're basically a cheaper one, say,
[00:55:41] Aydin Senkut: wow, I'm basically gonna think that's too expensive,
[00:55:44] Aydin Senkut: I'm gonna go for the cheaper companies,
[00:55:46] Aydin Senkut: you're forgetting the most important part
[00:55:48] Aydin Senkut: which is the revenue growth never materializes.
[00:55:50] Aydin Senkut: So you will only be successful
[00:55:52] Aydin Senkut: if the revenue growth materializes.
[00:55:54] Aydin Senkut: It does not matter that you were paying a much higher price,
[00:55:59] Aydin Senkut: but you have to be in those companies
[00:56:01] Aydin Senkut: where the revenue growth is like 50X, 100X, 1000X.
[00:56:04] Aydin Senkut: Because without that, we're never gonna get to the point
[00:56:06] Aydin Senkut: that we wanna get to anyway.
[00:56:08] Aydin Senkut: So that's the part that people don't talk about.
[00:56:10] Aydin Senkut: To be able to like understand what are the dynamics,
[00:56:13] Aydin Senkut: what are the ingredients, to be able to like,
[00:56:16] Aydin Senkut: look at a company when none of this is done,
[00:56:18] Aydin Senkut: when all of this is like in air, and uncertain,
[00:56:22] Aydin Senkut: and say, you know what, we have the imagination,
[00:56:24] Aydin Senkut: we have spent so much time trying to understand the space
[00:56:27] Aydin Senkut: and these founders, we think that this company
[00:56:30] Aydin Senkut: and these founders are the most likely
[00:56:32] Aydin Senkut: to be able to produce that growth.
[00:56:34] Aydin Senkut: And that's the thing, like that's what we're really good at.
[00:56:36] Aydin Senkut: And it happened literally over and over again
[00:56:39] Aydin Senkut: across all the different markets, all the different GOs,
[00:56:42] Aydin Senkut: all the different stages of investment.
[00:56:45] Aydin Senkut: And that's why I tell RLP, like if I showed you the time
[00:56:48] Aydin Senkut: we invested in the growth that ensued, 20 investments.
[00:56:51] Aydin Senkut: Every single one in the looks like C, only 10% were C.
[00:56:54] Aydin Senkut: Some of them were Series B, some of them were Series C,
[00:56:57] Aydin Senkut: some of them were Series A.
[00:56:58] Aydin Senkut: This is why I'm like throwing twitches
[00:57:01] Aydin Senkut: when people talk about markets or stages,
[00:57:03] Aydin Senkut: it's just like go back to the essence.
[00:57:05] Aydin Senkut: That's the essence of venture capital,
[00:57:07] Aydin Senkut: to be able to find companies that are
[00:57:09] Aydin Senkut: these extreme growth companies.
[00:57:11] And it's because these companies are the ones
[00:57:13] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that matter so much that, you know,
[00:57:15] Mario (Last Name Unknown): if you have to pay up for the access to the number one
[00:57:18] Mario (Last Name Unknown): versus, you know, getting a steal of a deal
[00:57:21] Mario (Last Name Unknown): for the number 10 in a market, you know,
[00:57:24] Mario (Last Name Unknown): there's no real value in that scenario where you're
[00:57:27] Mario (Last Name Unknown): getting a better valuation because, you know,
[00:57:30] Mario (Last Name Unknown): the number one business is going to run away
[00:57:32] Mario (Last Name Unknown): with it over a period of time.
[00:57:33] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And so then that makes me wonder
[00:57:35] Mario (Last Name Unknown): if you even need to care in a way about whether this is
[00:57:41] Mario (Last Name Unknown): an AI bubble or not, because in some respect,
[00:57:43] Mario (Last Name Unknown): it doesn't matter, right?
[00:57:44] Mario (Last Name Unknown): If you're always just going to believe that you pick
[00:57:47] the biggest winner, you know, it all should work out
[00:57:50] Mario (Last Name Unknown): in the bull case, right?
[00:57:52] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Not only that, but let me go back to the point that I made.
[00:57:57] People are looking at it again very simplistically.
[00:58:00] Aydin Senkut: Oh, it's an AI bubble.
[00:58:01] Aydin Senkut: What they're not paying attention is that there are
[00:58:04] Aydin Senkut: seven different markets or 10 different markets
[00:58:07] Aydin Senkut: that are coupled to that.
[00:58:08] Aydin Senkut: So it's not just AI.
[00:58:09] Aydin Senkut: What is the raw material of AI is data.
[00:58:11] Aydin Senkut: Who manipulates data?
[00:58:13] Aydin Senkut: Companies like NADN, which is data translation.
[00:58:16] Aydin Senkut: Companies like SuperBase, which actually store the data
[00:58:18] Aydin Senkut: and make it actionable.
[00:58:20] Aydin Senkut: We are talking about AI way while everybody's looking
[00:58:22] Aydin Senkut: at the chip while the processing actually happens
[00:58:25] Aydin Senkut: in data centers, you know, 100 years ago,
[00:58:27] Aydin Senkut: when the greatest wealth was created, it was all about oil.
[00:58:30] Aydin Senkut: And the people that made the most money were the refineries.
[00:58:33] Aydin Senkut: That's the data centers of today.
[00:58:35] Aydin Senkut: Then you look at what is the most important resource
[00:58:37] Aydin Senkut: for data centers is energy.
[00:58:39] Aydin Senkut: We actually do not have a scarcity of chips.
[00:58:42] Aydin Senkut: What we do have a huge scarcity of energy, right?
[00:58:45] Aydin Senkut: So like the energy is going to benefit from that.
[00:58:47] Aydin Senkut: Basically, where I'm going with this is people
[00:58:49] Aydin Senkut: are looking at it too simplistically,
[00:58:52] Aydin Senkut: because some of these things are such high numbers,
[00:58:54] Aydin Senkut: and it is not what people expected.
[00:58:57] Aydin Senkut: They're thinking that, oh, like some of it must be wrong.
[00:59:00] Aydin Senkut: And don't get me wrong, some of it is wrong, right?
[00:59:02] Aydin Senkut: Like just like everything, like internet wave,
[00:59:04] Aydin Senkut: like people basically thought a lot of these websites
[00:59:08] Aydin Senkut: on the web that sold things didn't amount to anything.
[00:59:12] Aydin Senkut: But Google that was built in became a trillion dollar company,
[00:59:15] Aydin Senkut: right? Like every one of these areas
[00:59:17] Aydin Senkut: where people thought, oh, this is really bad,
[00:59:19] Aydin Senkut: some companies really, really got it right.
[00:59:22] Aydin Senkut: And not only did they get it right,
[00:59:24] Aydin Senkut: but they got it right, 100,000 times more
[00:59:26] Aydin Senkut: than what people expected.
[00:59:28] Aydin Senkut: Yes. How can I say that?
[00:59:29] Aydin Senkut: Because I was one of those early people that said,
[00:59:32] Aydin Senkut: oh, God, please let Google be a billion dollar company,
[00:59:34] Aydin Senkut: it became a four trillion dollar company.
[00:59:36] Aydin Senkut: Wow. I was off by not one, not two, three zeros,
[00:59:40] Aydin Senkut: three orders of magnitude, right?
[00:59:42] Aydin Senkut: Like it not only became a multi billion dollar company,
[00:59:45] Aydin Senkut: it became a multi trillion dollar company.
[00:59:47] Aydin Senkut: Yes. One of the investments that you've made
[00:59:50] Mario (Last Name Unknown): is in skill day, which is in the sort of robotic space.
[00:59:53] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Obviously, an important part of the AI ecosystem.
[00:59:56] Mario (Last Name Unknown): But in many ways, it still feels a little bit like the younger
[01:00:01] Mario (Last Name Unknown): sibling that gets attention every once in a while,
[01:00:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): but maybe not as much as some of the flashier applications.
[01:00:06] Mario (Last Name Unknown): How have you thought about the way AI begins
[01:00:08] Mario (Last Name Unknown): to enter the physical world more?
[01:00:10] Mario (Last Name Unknown): And why was skilled one of the companies
[01:00:13] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that you were sort of most interested in?
[01:00:15] One of our most favorite companies,
[01:00:17] Aydin Senkut: I mean, so many interesting things.
[01:00:20] Aydin Senkut: Let me start by some really cool anecdotes.
[01:00:22] Aydin Senkut: Before we made the skilled investment,
[01:00:25] Aydin Senkut: we made six robotics investments,
[01:00:27] Aydin Senkut: and virtually all of them failed.
[01:00:29] Aydin Senkut: And not just failed, but failed miserably,
[01:00:31] Aydin Senkut: like absolute abject failure.
[01:00:33] Aydin Senkut: So any other traditional VC would have said,
[01:00:35] Aydin Senkut: you know what, six failures are enough.
[01:00:38] Aydin Senkut: Do not make this mistake again,
[01:00:40] Aydin Senkut: but this is the reason why our culture
[01:00:43] Aydin Senkut: is learning and adapting rapidly.
[01:00:45] Aydin Senkut: So your initial reaction would have been
[01:00:47] Aydin Senkut: all like it's AI boom, why robotics?
[01:00:50] Aydin Senkut: Here is like a couple of secrets.
[01:00:52] Aydin Senkut: The reason why it's different now,
[01:00:53] Aydin Senkut: why skilled was really interesting
[01:00:55] Aydin Senkut: is that all the other robotics companies
[01:00:57] Aydin Senkut: were trying to make the robots do one simple thing,
[01:01:01] Aydin Senkut: and the programming was all about making the robot
[01:01:03] Aydin Senkut: do one thing over and over again,
[01:01:05] Aydin Senkut: and literally took them years.
[01:01:07] Aydin Senkut: Like people don't learn to walk like that.
[01:01:09] Aydin Senkut: I mean, babies just like go fumble
[01:01:11] Aydin Senkut: and do stupid things sometimes like fall out
[01:01:14] Aydin Senkut: and like I'm like sometimes like God, you know,
[01:01:15] Aydin Senkut: my two sons, only if you knew like the moments
[01:01:18] Aydin Senkut: where they came really close to doing something.
[01:01:20] Aydin Senkut: Really crazy when they were like toddlers,
[01:01:22] Aydin Senkut: but that's how we learn.
[01:01:23] Aydin Senkut: And then after that, you never think about like,
[01:01:25] Aydin Senkut: oh, like you're walking like,
[01:01:27] Aydin Senkut: oh, I'm just stepping here, whatever.
[01:01:29] Aydin Senkut: So you're inherently understanding movement, right?
[01:01:32] Aydin Senkut: And so the reason why I got excited about skilled
[01:01:35] Aydin Senkut: is unlike all the areas of AI,
[01:01:37] Aydin Senkut: this concept of how will robots generally learn skills
[01:01:41] Aydin Senkut: and that's why the company's skilled,
[01:01:43] Aydin Senkut: the data for that did not exist.
[01:01:45] Aydin Senkut: So the company had to master synthetic data.
[01:01:48] Aydin Senkut: They were one of the first to master reinforcement learning.
[01:01:51] Aydin Senkut: So they got many, many different things right?
[01:01:54] Aydin Senkut: It's because the founders,
[01:01:55] Aydin Senkut: the two founders have been doing this for well over a decade.
[01:01:58] Aydin Senkut: They were the best experts in this field.
[01:02:00] Aydin Senkut: Like whether it's meta, Google,
[01:02:02] Aydin Senkut: like a lot of the things they did were based
[01:02:04] Aydin Senkut: on the papers that these founders wrote.
[01:02:06] Aydin Senkut: You know, this is really interesting
[01:02:07] Aydin Senkut: because it looks like essentially it reminds me
[01:02:11] Aydin Senkut: of Microsoft when the PC wave happened,
[01:02:14] Aydin Senkut: Microsoft said we're not gonna build the PCs.
[01:02:17] Aydin Senkut: We're just gonna be the operating system for all the PCs.
[01:02:19] Aydin Senkut: Yes.
[01:02:20] Aydin Senkut: So I think that's the second thing that I learned from robotics
[01:02:22] Aydin Senkut: is that if you're trying to do both software and hardware,
[01:02:26] Aydin Senkut: it is very, very difficult.
[01:02:27] Aydin Senkut: And also building hardware is really costly.
[01:02:29] Aydin Senkut: I'm not saying that skilled will never build hardware.
[01:02:32] Aydin Senkut: I just love the fact that they really focused on software first.
[01:02:35] Aydin Senkut: And they said our software not only has to be very good,
[01:02:39] Aydin Senkut: so good in fact that you can take the cheapest robots
[01:02:42] Aydin Senkut: that are literally a hundred times less precise
[01:02:45] Aydin Senkut: and make them more precise than the robots
[01:02:48] Aydin Senkut: that cost a hundred times as much,
[01:02:50] Aydin Senkut: just because the software is so good in managing them.
[01:02:52] Aydin Senkut: This is literally what Microsoft did with PCs.
[01:02:55] Aydin Senkut: They were competing with these elegant work stations
[01:02:58] Aydin Senkut: and software made the PCs shine.
[01:03:00] Aydin Senkut: And then the last thing is look,
[01:03:02] Aydin Senkut: a lot of times when these investments are made,
[01:03:06] Aydin Senkut: this is like a really good insight.
[01:03:07] Aydin Senkut: So I thought about, hey, you know what?
[01:03:09] Aydin Senkut: Let me think about it.
[01:03:10] Aydin Senkut: Let's say that we're using our imagination of robotics works,
[01:03:14] Aydin Senkut: what could be the kind of positive impact?
[01:03:16] Aydin Senkut: And then I did the simple calculation.
[01:03:19] Aydin Senkut: If you take US, Western Europe and Japan,
[01:03:21] Aydin Senkut: there are 190 million low skilled jobs.
[01:03:24] Aydin Senkut: And if you basically say like $25,000 a year,
[01:03:27] Aydin Senkut: which skill can easily offer
[01:03:29] Aydin Senkut: and if you can charge like multiples of that,
[01:03:32] Aydin Senkut: but I'm like, wow, like you don't even have to replace all of them.
[01:03:35] Aydin Senkut: 0.001 would be a $10 to $50 billion company.
[01:03:39] Aydin Senkut: Not value revenue.
[01:03:41] Aydin Senkut: 10 to $50 billion at a 10x multiple,
[01:03:44] Aydin Senkut: that is almost on this way to become a trillion dollar company.
[01:03:47] Aydin Senkut: And it's 0.001% of the market.
[01:03:50] Aydin Senkut: The reason why I'm telling you this,
[01:03:51] Aydin Senkut: the margin of error is so great.
[01:03:54] Aydin Senkut: Like even if they capture the tiny piece of the market,
[01:03:57] Aydin Senkut: not even one, but one 1000 of a percent,
[01:04:00] Aydin Senkut: it's gonna be a huge company, right?
[01:04:02] Aydin Senkut: And so that's the thing, like people are like,
[01:04:04] Aydin Senkut: oh, like robotics is crazy, it never work,
[01:04:06] Aydin Senkut: like it's not gonna scale whatever.
[01:04:08] Aydin Senkut: No, it actually will work.
[01:04:10] Aydin Senkut: We're gonna have a ton more robots in the next 10 to 20 years.
[01:04:13] Aydin Senkut: And they're gonna do a lot of things.
[01:04:14] Aydin Senkut: And I doubt it's gonna take like jobs away.
[01:04:18] Aydin Senkut: It's just gonna do jobs that people are not meant to do
[01:04:20] Aydin Senkut: or should not be doing, but they're doing it
[01:04:23] Aydin Senkut: because there is no other way of doing it.
[01:04:25] Aydin Senkut: And like there are so many jobs that are unsafe.
[01:04:27] Aydin Senkut: It's risky.
[01:04:28] Aydin Senkut: People are getting killed, getting injured.
[01:04:31] Aydin Senkut: People are doing the job at night
[01:04:32] Aydin Senkut: because you know what, they need to do something.
[01:04:35] Aydin Senkut: And I just feel like we're gonna use people
[01:04:37] Aydin Senkut: for different things where hopefully it'll be like,
[01:04:40] Aydin Senkut: better value at jobs.
[01:04:41] Aydin Senkut: So I don't think it's like one or the other,
[01:04:43] Aydin Senkut: like all robots will come, not all of us will have jobs.
[01:04:46] Aydin Senkut: I do think it's gonna be like this kind of happy coexistence.
[01:04:49] Aydin Senkut: We're gonna have a lot of robots
[01:04:51] Aydin Senkut: and they're gonna take more drudgery out of our lives.
[01:04:53] Aydin Senkut: And then hopefully we can do more,
[01:04:56] Aydin Senkut: a higher value, higher order of things as humans.
[01:04:59] Aydin Senkut: I think I'm right in saying the Felicis
[01:05:01] Mario (Last Name Unknown): hasn't invested in one of the sort of large general purpose labs,
[01:05:05] Mario (Last Name Unknown): like an open AI and then fropic,
[01:05:08] Mario (Last Name Unknown): even the European sort of offerings like Mistral.
[01:05:12] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Has that been a concerted strategy
[01:05:15] Mario (Last Name Unknown): or more just a consequence of sort of
[01:05:17] Mario (Last Name Unknown): when your own AI strategy came to the fore
[01:05:20] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and the opportunities that came in front of you?
[01:05:24] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I'm curious maybe that what that says
[01:05:26] Mario (Last Name Unknown): about how you see this sector.
[01:05:27] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Yeah, I mean look,
[01:05:29] first I need to start by being very humble.
[01:05:32] Aydin Senkut: I have to say that I think I drastically underestimated
[01:05:36] Aydin Senkut: and tropic and open AI.
[01:05:37] Aydin Senkut: And this is the thing.
[01:05:38] Aydin Senkut: I think human beings, you look at large numbers.
[01:05:41] Aydin Senkut: I look at the valuations,
[01:05:43] Aydin Senkut: I mean, I look at what these companies were doing
[01:05:45] Aydin Senkut: and I think I underestimated the value they can capture.
[01:05:48] Aydin Senkut: So I think the right thing to do here is to say
[01:05:52] Aydin Senkut: we've done really well in many areas of AI.
[01:05:55] Aydin Senkut: I think we should have taken
[01:05:56] Aydin Senkut: and tropic and open AI a lot more seriously.
[01:05:59] Aydin Senkut: The growth that they've been able to capture,
[01:06:00] Aydin Senkut: the value they've been able to capture.
[01:06:02] Aydin Senkut: If you basically say,
[01:06:04] Aydin Senkut: hey, like what's your biggest regret?
[01:06:07] Aydin Senkut: I'm gonna go back to 2008 and talk about Airbnb,
[01:06:10] Aydin Senkut: but what is your biggest regret in the age of AI?
[01:06:13] Aydin Senkut: I feel that we should have taken this much more seriously
[01:06:16] Aydin Senkut: and taken a bet in one of the large model companies,
[01:06:19] Aydin Senkut: whether it's entropic open AI.
[01:06:21] Aydin Senkut: You can make pros and cons for each one of them differently.
[01:06:24] Aydin Senkut: I'm not really sure I would put my strul in this bucket,
[01:06:27] Aydin Senkut: but I will certainly say entropic and open AI
[01:06:29] Aydin Senkut: are special companies each in their different way
[01:06:32] Aydin Senkut: and I will be the first to admit and own
[01:06:35] Aydin Senkut: and this is part of the learning and adapting fast culture
[01:06:38] Aydin Senkut: is that you have to be very honest with yourself.
[01:06:40] Aydin Senkut: You know what, that was a miss.
[01:06:41] Aydin Senkut: Yep.
[01:06:42] That was a big miss.
[01:06:43] Aydin Senkut: We way underestimated that because the cool thing about that
[01:06:47] Aydin Senkut: is we are talking about growth,
[01:06:50] Aydin Senkut: but there is yet another angle to it.
[01:06:52] Aydin Senkut: We have not talked about growth at scale.
[01:06:55] These companies have been able to grow at scale.
[01:06:58] Aydin Senkut: Like, I don't know,
[01:06:59] Aydin Senkut: like we talk about zero to 100 million,
[01:07:01] Aydin Senkut: but I don't know how many companies could go
[01:07:03] Aydin Senkut: from 30 million to 3 billion in as record of a time, right?
[01:07:07] Aydin Senkut: Like when cars, it's always like zero to 60,
[01:07:10] Aydin Senkut: but the harder thing to nail is like,
[01:07:13] Aydin Senkut: I don't know, like 60 to 200.
[01:07:14] Aydin Senkut: Like, it becomes exponentially more difficult
[01:07:17] Aydin Senkut: to go from 60 mile per hour to 200 mile per hour.
[01:07:21] Aydin Senkut: So I am just acknowledging that I think
[01:07:24] Aydin Senkut: those two companies have really done something special
[01:07:27] Aydin Senkut: and I just look at the valuation numbers and I joke.
[01:07:29] Aydin Senkut: But we are very aware of it.
[01:07:31] Aydin Senkut: We got some other things.
[01:07:33] Aydin Senkut: I mean, we still made foundational model bets
[01:07:35] Aydin Senkut: where it's runway or pull side or skilled.
[01:07:38] Aydin Senkut: Yes.
[01:07:39] Aydin Senkut: They're just not building generalist models.
[01:07:41] Aydin Senkut: They're building specialist models.
[01:07:42] Aydin Senkut: But again, nothing takes away from the fact
[01:07:45] Aydin Senkut: that I think, and tropic and open IR are going to be huge company.
[01:07:49] Well, I'm sorry to bring it up in that case,
[01:07:51] Mario (Last Name Unknown): but nature of the game is, you know, very well.
[01:07:53] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Nature of the game.
[01:07:54] Mario (Last Name Unknown): All good.
[01:07:55] Mario (Last Name Unknown): You mentioned Airbnb, and that's one that I feel like
[01:07:59] Mario (Last Name Unknown): a lot of folks look back on as, you know, maybe they're big miss.
[01:08:02] Mario (Last Name Unknown): What was it that that didn't work for you
[01:08:05] Mario (Last Name Unknown): at the time or that you missed?
[01:08:06] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Well, let me be very specific.
[01:08:09] Aydin Senkut: I have an email still from 2008, directly from Brian Cheske.
[01:08:13] Aydin Senkut: This is even before YC invested, by the way.
[01:08:16] Aydin Senkut: It's like, I didn't.
[01:08:16] Aydin Senkut: We really enjoyed our meeting with you.
[01:08:18] Aydin Senkut: We really feel you should invest in our company.
[01:08:21] Aydin Senkut: And you still have a chance to do that
[01:08:23] Aydin Senkut: at $2.5 million valuation.
[01:08:27] Aydin Senkut: For a $60 billion or $100 billion company,
[01:08:30] Aydin Senkut: one of the biggest lessons I learned.
[01:08:32] Aydin Senkut: And this is why, again, I'm going to keep going back over
[01:08:34] Aydin Senkut: and over to this is that this is why I want learning
[01:08:38] Aydin Senkut: and adapting rapidly to be our core values
[01:08:40] Aydin Senkut: that while the decision was academically correct,
[01:08:43] Aydin Senkut: it was practically very wrong.
[01:08:45] Aydin Senkut: Essentially, what happened is I thought,
[01:08:47] Aydin Senkut: it's what a wonderful idea, but the reputational risk
[01:08:51] Aydin Senkut: of something going wrong can kill the company early on.
[01:08:55] Aydin Senkut: Right?
[01:08:55] Aydin Senkut: Like if your Airbnb and something bad happens
[01:08:57] Aydin Senkut: in one of the houses like, I don't know,
[01:08:59] Aydin Senkut: something like really bad or illegal,
[01:09:01] Aydin Senkut: that would kill the brand.
[01:09:03] Aydin Senkut: But what ended up happening is the community was so strong
[01:09:07] Aydin Senkut: that the community basically self-policed itself
[01:09:10] Aydin Senkut: and something bad did not happen.
[01:09:12] Aydin Senkut: Where am I going with this?
[01:09:13] Aydin Senkut: Not only was it a miss, and it is a very visceral miss,
[01:09:16] Aydin Senkut: but basically what happened is,
[01:09:19] Aydin Senkut: this is the thing about venture that is so tough,
[01:09:22] Aydin Senkut: is that your biggest misses are not the companies,
[01:09:26] Aydin Senkut: you're saying yes, it's just the ones that you're saying no,
[01:09:29] Aydin Senkut: that end up being great companies.
[01:09:31] Aydin Senkut: Because if you're not in those best companies,
[01:09:33] Aydin Senkut: your returns will not be as good as the very best ones.
[01:09:36] Aydin Senkut: But just to kind of like put an example
[01:09:39] Aydin Senkut: of how you can take lemons and turn them into lemonade,
[01:09:42] Aydin Senkut: one of the reasons I ended up finding adianne
[01:09:45] Aydin Senkut: investing in it, I also missed an underestimated Uber.
[01:09:48] Aydin Senkut: I'm a very avid driver, and I'm like,
[01:09:50] Aydin Senkut: why would people want their own drivers?
[01:09:52] Aydin Senkut: I had to eat my words on that one as well.
[01:09:55] Aydin Senkut: But what ended up happening is after missing out
[01:09:57] Aydin Senkut: on Airbnb and Uber, it basically like dawn on me
[01:10:01] Aydin Senkut: that it was like an era where even Google and Facebook
[01:10:04] Aydin Senkut: were having difficulty with international payments,
[01:10:06] Aydin Senkut: I'm like, look, there might be yet one more chance
[01:10:10] Aydin Senkut: to play this.
[01:10:11] Aydin Senkut: Yes, maybe we cannot invest in Airbnb and Uber anymore,
[01:10:15] Aydin Senkut: but if the international growth is going to be staggering
[01:10:18] Aydin Senkut: for them, there will be an international payments company
[01:10:20] Aydin Senkut: that's going to capture this.
[01:10:22] Aydin Senkut: And that ended up being adianne.
[01:10:24] Aydin Senkut: So the only thing that I'd like to get a tiny little bit
[01:10:27] Aydin Senkut: of credit is it was a big failure and set back.
[01:10:31] Aydin Senkut: And instead of saying, OK, it doesn't matter.
[01:10:33] Aydin Senkut: I have big ego.
[01:10:34] Aydin Senkut: We will find great ones.
[01:10:35] Aydin Senkut: I said, no, I'm not going to let this rest.
[01:10:38] Aydin Senkut: I'm going to go find yet another company and turn that lemon
[01:10:41] Aydin Senkut: into lemonade.
[01:10:42] Aydin Senkut: And adianne became one of our biggest exits ever.
[01:10:45] Aydin Senkut: And it was very interesting because when adianne
[01:10:48] Aydin Senkut: first got in the US, it was the only company I literally
[01:10:52] Aydin Senkut: remember calling Wall Street Journal.
[01:10:53] Aydin Senkut: And they're like, actually, we don't even
[01:10:55] Aydin Senkut: know what this company is.
[01:10:56] Aydin Senkut: We don't even have it in our database.
[01:10:58] Aydin Senkut: That's how under the radar it was.
[01:11:00] Aydin Senkut: And this is where every VC in the US was investing in Stripe.
[01:11:04] Aydin Senkut: So again, going back to that, not only do you have to be right,
[01:11:08] Aydin Senkut: but you have to be right and in minority.
[01:11:11] Aydin Senkut: You can't be right with 100, 500 other people.
[01:11:13] Aydin Senkut: You have to be right and be in the small minority
[01:11:17] Aydin Senkut: where it's not obvious to everybody else.
[01:11:19] Aydin Senkut: That's a great story.
[01:11:20] Mario (Last Name Unknown): To finish, I always like to ask a more abstract philosophical
[01:11:25] Mario (Last Name Unknown): question or two.
[01:11:26] Mario (Last Name Unknown): One of them is, if you had unlimited resources
[01:11:29] Mario (Last Name Unknown): and no operational constraints, what
[01:11:31] Mario (Last Name Unknown): is an experiment you would like to run?
[01:11:32] Mario (Last Name Unknown): It would require a little bit of design.
[01:11:35] Aydin Senkut: But I think one of the things we're obsessed with is,
[01:11:37] Aydin Senkut: like, truly understanding what makes uplier founders.
[01:11:41] Aydin Senkut: And I don't know if like a huge longitudinal study
[01:11:44] has ever been done.
[01:11:45] Aydin Senkut: In fact, I did a little bit of Google search.
[01:11:48] I think one of the largest studies ever done
[01:11:51] Aydin Senkut: was only 1,000 people.
[01:11:52] Aydin Senkut: And I think the only large scale human study was COVID.
[01:11:57] Aydin Senkut: Because everybody was going through it.
[01:11:59] Aydin Senkut: But if we had unlimited resources,
[01:12:02] Aydin Senkut: again, privacy safe, opt-in, or however
[01:12:05] Aydin Senkut: is statistically designed to be relevant,
[01:12:07] Aydin Senkut: but again, respecting people's privacy,
[01:12:10] Aydin Senkut: I would love to do some kind of very detailed study
[01:12:14] Aydin Senkut: of founders and what are the elements and personality
[01:12:18] Aydin Senkut: aspects or whatever.
[01:12:20] Aydin Senkut: Like, what in their backgrounds really spikes?
[01:12:23] Aydin Senkut: Because I feel like all these founders are very talented.
[01:12:27] This is the thing.
[01:12:28] Aydin Senkut: It's not just as simple.
[01:12:29] Aydin Senkut: So many of them are brilliant.
[01:12:31] Aydin Senkut: So many of them are great.
[01:12:32] Aydin Senkut: All of them are very brave.
[01:12:33] Aydin Senkut: But then what determines the ones that spike the highest
[01:12:36] Aydin Senkut: and the ones that ended up doing OK, just not great?
[01:12:40] Aydin Senkut: So that would be an awesome thing to do.
[01:12:42] Aydin Senkut: What's the tradition or practice from another culture
[01:12:45] Mario (Last Name Unknown): or time period that you think we should adopt today?
[01:12:47] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I'm going to mention something from my heritage
[01:12:50] Aydin Senkut: as a Turkish-born American.
[01:12:53] Aydin Senkut: We have this concept in Turkey called Misafir Parvarlik.
[01:12:57] Aydin Senkut: It's just about hospitality.
[01:12:59] Aydin Senkut: And it's not just hospitality as in, hey,
[01:13:02] Aydin Senkut: you're nice to strangers.
[01:13:03] Aydin Senkut: But if you have a guest, the guest
[01:13:07] Aydin Senkut: is basically treated as if it's the most important member
[01:13:10] Aydin Senkut: of your family.
[01:13:11] Aydin Senkut: You literally, truly make them feel at home
[01:13:13] Aydin Senkut: and you care for them.
[01:13:15] Aydin Senkut: And the reason why I'm mentioning that
[01:13:16] Aydin Senkut: is honestly the essence of everything we do
[01:13:20] Aydin Senkut: for the founders at Felicia's putting them first.
[01:13:23] Aydin Senkut: That literally is that culture.
[01:13:24] Aydin Senkut: I always like to think of my grandmothers.
[01:13:27] Aydin Senkut: I didn't get a chance to meet my grandfathers.
[01:13:29] Aydin Senkut: But my grandmothers were the epitome of that.
[01:13:32] Aydin Senkut: And in some ways, we have these cute little traditions
[01:13:35] Aydin Senkut: like everybody that comes to our office,
[01:13:37] Aydin Senkut: we always give them a chocolate or something sweet as they leave.
[01:13:40] Aydin Senkut: It's just this sense that everybody
[01:13:43] Aydin Senkut: should feel special when they're interacting with us,
[01:13:46] Aydin Senkut: especially founders.
[01:13:48] Aydin Senkut: So it's a little bit of a cultural touch
[01:13:50] Aydin Senkut: and in a world that's so polarized and stressed
[01:13:52] Aydin Senkut: and a grumpy, we want to add a little bit more happiness
[01:13:56] Aydin Senkut: and a little bit more kindness.
[01:13:59] Aydin Senkut: Hopefully we're doing our part and we can scale it.
[01:14:01] Aydin Senkut: I love that.
[01:14:03] Mario (Last Name Unknown): Final question.
[01:14:04] Mario (Last Name Unknown): If you had the power to assign a book to everyone on earth
[01:14:06] Mario (Last Name Unknown): to read and understand, what would you like to assign?
[01:14:09] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I'm going to pick one of the latest books that I've read
[01:14:12] Aydin Senkut: that was really impactful for me.
[01:14:14] Aydin Senkut: It's a book called Clear Thinking by Shane Parrish.
[01:14:18] Aydin Senkut: He was a Canadian intelligence operative.
[01:14:21] Aydin Senkut: And the reason why the book is really interesting is,
[01:14:23] Aydin Senkut: every time I read a book, all this is a great story
[01:14:26] Aydin Senkut: or it's like talked about this one thing,
[01:14:29] Aydin Senkut: the interesting aspect of this book
[01:14:31] Aydin Senkut: is all about decision making
[01:14:33] Aydin Senkut: and how we normally make decisions
[01:14:35] Aydin Senkut: where we're kind of defaulting to things that are not obvious
[01:14:38] Aydin Senkut: to us and it really impacts our decision making.
[01:14:40] Aydin Senkut: And when you think about it,
[01:14:42] Aydin Senkut: if you could get one thing right
[01:14:44] Aydin Senkut: that could scale throughout your whole life,
[01:14:47] Aydin Senkut: I think that would be making better decisions.
[01:14:50] You would have a better family, you would have a better career,
[01:14:52] Aydin Senkut: you would have a better personal life.
[01:14:54] Aydin Senkut: And so what I liked about this book is it broke down
[01:14:57] Aydin Senkut: and said, this is four different ways,
[01:15:00] Aydin Senkut: whether we realize it or not,
[01:15:01] Aydin Senkut: we default to these different things
[01:15:04] Aydin Senkut: and we think that we're making conscious decisions,
[01:15:07] Aydin Senkut: but they're really like reactions
[01:15:09] Aydin Senkut: and we kind of program.
[01:15:10] Aydin Senkut: So it essentially says like the way to like unwind that
[01:15:14] Aydin Senkut: or break that like kind of futile process
[01:15:17] Aydin Senkut: is like take a little bit longer
[01:15:19] Aydin Senkut: or whenever you're about to make like a reactionary decision,
[01:15:22] Aydin Senkut: like put things so that you can move as fast
[01:15:25] Aydin Senkut: or is more difficult, so you don't basically like make
[01:15:27] Aydin Senkut: a decision in a rush that you later regret.
[01:15:30] Aydin Senkut: So I love the book, it's not a very long book,
[01:15:32] Aydin Senkut: it's an easy read.
[01:15:33] Aydin Senkut: So I would highly recommend it,
[01:15:35] Aydin Senkut: clear thinking by Shane Parish.
[01:15:37] Aydin Senkut: Amazing, he's also the author and founder,
[01:15:39] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I think of a great website called Farnham Street
[01:15:43] Mario (Last Name Unknown): that I would also recommend folks check out.
[01:15:45] Mario (Last Name Unknown): I'm sure you're familiar with it.
[01:15:47] Very familiar, I is one of the few like daily newsletters
[01:15:50] Aydin Senkut: that I love is very inspiring, very positive,
[01:15:53] Aydin Senkut: highly recommended Farnham Street.
[01:15:55] Aydin Senkut: Amazing, well, it has been so lovely to chat with you
