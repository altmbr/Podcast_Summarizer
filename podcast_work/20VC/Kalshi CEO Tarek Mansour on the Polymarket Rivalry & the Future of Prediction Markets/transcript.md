[00:00:00] kind of what happened with Kalshi in the election
[00:00:01] Tarek Mansour: was a bit of a tragedy for T-moment for our industry.
[00:00:03] Tarek Mansour: Kalshi is one of the fastest growing companies
[00:00:05] Harry Stebbings: on the planet.
[00:00:06] Harry Stebbings: In the last week, they announced their $1 billion
[00:00:08] Harry Stebbings: raise and $11 billion valuation.
[00:00:11] Harry Stebbings: Dave Tanarak joins me for his only interview
[00:00:13] Harry Stebbings: following these announcements.
[00:00:14] Harry Stebbings: An industry truly becomes an industry when there's a rivalry.
[00:00:18] Tarek Mansour: Without polymarket, we wouldn't have pushed our marketing
[00:00:21] Tarek Mansour: and pushed our product as hard.
[00:00:23] Tarek Mansour: Did you ever cross-past with SPF?
[00:00:25] Harry Stebbings: And what did you learn from observing FTS's implosion?
[00:00:29] Ready to go?
[00:00:30] ["FTS's Plays in the Sky"]
[00:00:41] Tara, dude, it is so fucking good to have you on the show.
[00:00:44] Harry Stebbings: I mean, holy cow, what a round page Kalshi's been on my friend.
[00:00:48] Harry Stebbings: Thank you so much for coming back.
[00:00:50] Harry Stebbings: Thanks for having me, super excited.
[00:00:53] Now, dude, I've got to start on the main thing.
[00:00:55] Harry Stebbings: A billion dollars.
[00:00:57] Harry Stebbings: The first thing I have to ask, why does Kalshi
[00:01:00] Harry Stebbings: need a billion dollars?
[00:01:02] Harry Stebbings: That's a good question.
[00:01:03] Tarek Mansour: But what we've realized in the last, I would say,
[00:01:07] Tarek Mansour: six to nine months given the sort of acceleration
[00:01:10] Tarek Mansour: of what we've seen is, I think the opportunity
[00:01:14] Tarek Mansour: of that ahead of us is maybe even bigger
[00:01:16] Tarek Mansour: than we had all possibly imagined.
[00:01:18] Tarek Mansour: There's a few symptoms of that.
[00:01:20] Tarek Mansour: So one, I don't know if you know this, Harry,
[00:01:21] Tarek Mansour: but Kalshi this year is at this scale, at least,
[00:01:27] Tarek Mansour: I think the fastest-going company in America outside of AI.
[00:01:29] Tarek Mansour: I think Anthropics is going faster.
[00:01:31] Tarek Mansour: And I'm not sure about my core and core server,
[00:01:33] Tarek Mansour: but we're growing at that pace of that rate.
[00:01:38] Tarek Mansour: And number two, what we're seeing, which is even more important,
[00:01:41] Tarek Mansour: the qualitative thing that we're seeing
[00:01:43] Tarek Mansour: is there's a real and rare shift in consumer behavior.
[00:01:46] Tarek Mansour: People are turning from passive watchers of events
[00:01:50] Tarek Mansour: or news or sports or other things
[00:01:52] Tarek Mansour: that they engage with in real life to active participants.
[00:01:55] Tarek Mansour: That natural behavior of wanting to predict the future
[00:01:58] Tarek Mansour: or debating about something is stirring into activity on Kalshi.
[00:02:01] Tarek Mansour: That is rare.
[00:02:02] Tarek Mansour: When you see this shift in consumer behavior,
[00:02:03] Tarek Mansour: I mean, you've seen it in Airbnb with the host
[00:02:05] Tarek Mansour: and Uber with riders, when you're seeing a new class
[00:02:09] Tarek Mansour: of people in the Skatees prediction market traders
[00:02:12] Tarek Mansour: becoming a thing, that's indicative of a very, very
[00:02:14] Tarek Mansour: massive opportunity ahead of us.
[00:02:15] Tarek Mansour: And when you have a massive opportunity ahead of you,
[00:02:18] Tarek Mansour: you want to go big, you want to go big.
[00:02:20] Tarek Mansour: And so we're just really scaling up for that option here.
[00:02:23] Totally got you.
[00:02:24] Harry Stebbings: What does billion dollars get for you
[00:02:26] Harry Stebbings: that you couldn't do without?
[00:02:28] Harry Stebbings: I think one, so, okay, we are at a point right now
[00:02:30] Tarek Mansour: where so we're growing incredibly fast.
[00:02:33] Tarek Mansour: We are also profitable right now.
[00:02:37] Tarek Mansour: And so it's a good question.
[00:02:39] Tarek Mansour: I think the next phase is how do we build a global brand?
[00:02:43] Tarek Mansour: How do we build a brand that people know,
[00:02:45] Tarek Mansour: they talk about, they associate with,
[00:02:48] Tarek Mansour: and how do we put the story of the company
[00:02:49] Tarek Mansour: and the story of the brand out there.
[00:02:51] Tarek Mansour: And so there's a lot of marketing that's coming.
[00:02:53] Tarek Mansour: Obviously scaling the team, so we're still 100 people.
[00:02:56] Tarek Mansour: And number two is we're a financial market.
[00:02:58] Tarek Mansour: We're a financial company.
[00:02:59] Tarek Mansour: So as the volumes increase, as liquidity increases,
[00:03:04] Tarek Mansour: as a regulated, like we're federally regulated,
[00:03:06] Tarek Mansour: financial exchange, it's a little bit like a bank
[00:03:08] Tarek Mansour: or some of the kind of regulated clearinghouse you hear about,
[00:03:11] Tarek Mansour: you have reserve requirements and added capital
[00:03:13] Tarek Mansour: on the balance sheet.
[00:03:14] Tarek Mansour: Think of it a little bit as a safety caution.
[00:03:16] Tarek Mansour: Things that adds sort of, it enables us to do things
[00:03:22] Tarek Mansour: like faster, like more capital enables us to do things
[00:03:24] Tarek Mansour: faster in financial services.
[00:03:25] Tarek Mansour: And that's usually a good thing.
[00:03:27] Dude, do you agree with the concept of king making
[00:03:29] Harry Stebbings: that large, large amounts of money
[00:03:32] Harry Stebbings: can annoying to winner in a category?
[00:03:34] Harry Stebbings: Do you believe that that is the thing?
[00:03:37] Harry Stebbings: At least maybe I'll respond to it
[00:03:38] Tarek Mansour: in terms of the calcium strategy.
[00:03:39] Tarek Mansour: Like, at least for the calcium strategy,
[00:03:42] Tarek Mansour: that's not how we think about it.
[00:03:44] Tarek Mansour: I'm maybe a little bit more on the other side,
[00:03:46] Tarek Mansour: which is like a better product will Trump any day.
[00:03:51] Tarek Mansour: Like, and we've seen this a bit like with Doradas
[00:03:52] Tarek Mansour: and Uber Eats, right?
[00:03:53] Tarek Mansour: Like Uber Eats had, I mean, infinite capital to compare
[00:03:56] Tarek Mansour: to Doradas, but Tony about the better product and 21, right?
[00:04:01] Tarek Mansour: And so I don't feel too dogmatic,
[00:04:06] Tarek Mansour: but maybe I'm a slight no on this one.
[00:04:08] Harry Stebbings: What do you think?
[00:04:09] Harry Stebbings: I don't wavoringly do.
[00:04:11] Harry Stebbings: I think we're seeing it today where you're seeing VCs
[00:04:14] Harry Stebbings: essentially choose a category and then just plow money in
[00:04:18] Harry Stebbings: knowing that if you build the right infrastructure,
[00:04:21] Harry Stebbings: it massively increases your likelihood of success.
[00:04:24] Harry Stebbings: If you have the right founders who are good resource allocators.
[00:04:27] Harry Stebbings: Maybe I would.
[00:04:28] Tarek Mansour: I'm not.
[00:04:28] Tarek Mansour: Maybe with the if at the end, right?
[00:04:30] Tarek Mansour: And but the problem is the if is a bit conditional, right?
[00:04:32] Tarek Mansour: Like, oftentimes a lot of money can create like an efficiency
[00:04:35] Tarek Mansour: and like, you know, a company start making a bunch
[00:04:38] Tarek Mansour: of unforced errors when a lot of money comes in.
[00:04:41] Tarek Mansour: But if that if is true, I think
[00:04:42] Tarek Mansour: yet capital tends to be quite a good success
[00:04:44] Tarek Mansour: if the company is a is a is an A plus execution company.
[00:04:48] Tarek Mansour: Did how much of Calhshi's activity is sports betting?
[00:04:52] Harry Stebbings: And how do you respond to people who say,
[00:04:54] Harry Stebbings: it's just a sports betting platform?
[00:04:57] Harry Stebbings: It's pretty similar to what happened last year actually.
[00:05:00] Tarek Mansour: So last year it was, you know, the question I was receiving
[00:05:03] Tarek Mansour: is how much of the activity is elections?
[00:05:06] Tarek Mansour: And, you know, obviously a lot, right?
[00:05:08] Tarek Mansour: Like that was the big talk of the like in the way I would answer.
[00:05:11] Tarek Mansour: He's like, well, how much of the attention right now
[00:05:13] Tarek Mansour: is in the election?
[00:05:14] Tarek Mansour: Like in terms of like what people were talking
[00:05:16] Tarek Mansour: about in October, 2024.
[00:05:18] Tarek Mansour: And if you think about it, I was like, well,
[00:05:20] out of 10 tweets, I see on Twitter 9.5 tweets
[00:05:24] Tarek Mansour: were about the election, right?
[00:05:25] Tarek Mansour: Like, so maybe that will correlate
[00:05:27] Tarek Mansour: with the volume on Calhshi and I did, right?
[00:05:29] Tarek Mansour: It was it was exactly that.
[00:05:31] Tarek Mansour: And you're seeing the same thing happen with sports.
[00:05:33] Tarek Mansour: But like per unit of time, it really is about
[00:05:36] Tarek Mansour: what is most on top of people's minds.
[00:05:38] Tarek Mansour: So yes, Sunday NFL Sunday is massive in America.
[00:05:41] Tarek Mansour: And that's on top of people's minds.
[00:05:43] Tarek Mansour: But when there's a Fed decision,
[00:05:44] Tarek Mansour: that's on top of people's minds.
[00:05:45] Tarek Mansour: And that's where the trading volume is.
[00:05:47] Tarek Mansour: When there's a Mamdani election,
[00:05:48] Tarek Mansour: that's when the trading volume is.
[00:05:50] Tarek Mansour: So the volumes will basically ebb and flow
[00:05:51] Tarek Mansour: with whatever is in the news,
[00:05:52] Tarek Mansour: whatever is trending on X,
[00:05:54] Tarek Mansour: whatever is on top of people's minds.
[00:05:56] Tarek Mansour: And I think it's a matter of time
[00:05:58] Tarek Mansour: till basically like, you know,
[00:05:59] Tarek Mansour: we're seeing incredibly strong evidence
[00:06:02] Tarek Mansour: or attraction in the culture markets, for example.
[00:06:04] Tarek Mansour: I actually think like what's happening with Taylor Swift,
[00:06:07] Tarek Mansour: you know, movies and how successful
[00:06:09] Tarek Mansour: are they going to be?
[00:06:10] Tarek Mansour: Anything around culture like that,
[00:06:12] Tarek Mansour: that is massive on address,
[00:06:13] Tarek Mansour: on address tab right now.
[00:06:15] Tarek Mansour: And it's a matter of time till like,
[00:06:16] Tarek Mansour: you know, we scale a number of markets,
[00:06:17] Tarek Mansour: we scale a liquidity and I think those one day
[00:06:19] Tarek Mansour: will be very big.
[00:06:19] Tarek Mansour: So sports is very big right now,
[00:06:21] Tarek Mansour: but I don't think it's kind of like a,
[00:06:23] Tarek Mansour: I think it's a moment in time.
[00:06:24] Harry Stebbings: It's funny, I spoke to pretty much every one
[00:06:26] Harry Stebbings: of your investors by the way,
[00:06:27] Harry Stebbings: before the show, including Colin at Sandwich.
[00:06:29] Harry Stebbings: Yeah.
[00:06:30] Harry Stebbings: He didn't told me about investing back in 2019
[00:06:33] Harry Stebbings: because it was the biggest time
[00:06:34] Harry Stebbings: he had ever seen in potential.
[00:06:37] Harry Stebbings: And I thought that was an interesting and bold statement,
[00:06:39] Harry Stebbings: which I completely agree with you
[00:06:40] Harry Stebbings: when you look at the untapped element of movies
[00:06:42] Harry Stebbings: to culture and everything in between.
[00:06:45] Harry Stebbings: With that, you have people realize that untapped arm
[00:06:48] Harry Stebbings: and you see Robin Hood come in with alternate products.
[00:06:52] Harry Stebbings: How do you think about Robin Hood's entry?
[00:06:54] Harry Stebbings: I know Vlad pretty well.
[00:06:55] Harry Stebbings: I'm always very impressed by their product suite.
[00:06:57] Harry Stebbings: How do you internally think about that?
[00:06:59] Harry Stebbings: I think that, maybe let me answer that question generally
[00:07:02] Tarek Mansour: and then specifically.
[00:07:04] Tarek Mansour: So in 2024, we won the fight against the government.
[00:07:07] Tarek Mansour: We sued the government and then we won that fight in October 7th, 2024.
[00:07:12] And I think that has accelerated prediction markets.
[00:07:14] Tarek Mansour: That has really spirited them into the mainstream.
[00:07:17] Tarek Mansour: And this has continued into this year.
[00:07:20] Tarek Mansour: And when you see this type of, like I would say, success,
[00:07:24] Tarek Mansour: I think this kind of what happened with Calcine
[00:07:26] Tarek Mansour: in the election was a bit of a chat GPT moment for our industry.
[00:07:28] Tarek Mansour: And what happened with chat GPT and opening eyes,
[00:07:31] Tarek Mansour: everybody flocked, right?
[00:07:32] Tarek Mansour: Everyone was like, well, there's a gold mine here.
[00:07:34] Tarek Mansour: We're going to go after it.
[00:07:35] Tarek Mansour: And so that's happening in a prediction market.
[00:07:38] Tarek Mansour: And I always think of it as like, I think there's two markets.
[00:07:39] Tarek Mansour: There's either small markets that not a lot of people
[00:07:43] Tarek Mansour: will care about or massive markets that a lot of people
[00:07:46] Tarek Mansour: will care about as long as you live in a free open market
[00:07:49] Tarek Mansour: in a free open society.
[00:07:53] Tarek Mansour: And obviously, I'm running a free market.
[00:07:54] Tarek Mansour: So I have to believe in competition, right?
[00:07:56] Tarek Mansour: And so it's great.
[00:07:58] Tarek Mansour: Like this competition, I was seeing from CME,
[00:08:00] Tarek Mansour: from obviously Drought King's Fandall,
[00:08:02] Tarek Mansour: from some of the offshore players, some of the startups,
[00:08:05] Tarek Mansour: some of the brokers is a sign that I think
[00:08:07] Tarek Mansour: the opportunity has is massive.
[00:08:09] Tarek Mansour: It's a very big opportunity.
[00:08:11] Tarek Mansour: On specific enrollment, I mean, incredible company,
[00:08:13] Tarek Mansour: amazing execution.
[00:08:17] I think Vlad has been able to sort of move into new products
[00:08:20] Tarek Mansour: pretty successfully.
[00:08:21] Tarek Mansour: And you know, they've been incredible partner of ours
[00:08:26] Tarek Mansour: on the prediction market front.
[00:08:27] Tarek Mansour: So I think them kind of pushing for more innovation
[00:08:29] Tarek Mansour: in space, I think is a very positive thing.
[00:08:31] Tarek Mansour: You know, I think it's going to make all of us get better.
[00:08:34] Tarek Mansour: And we're very excited about it.
[00:08:35] Tarek Mansour: Totally get you know, share that on flat.
[00:08:37] Harry Stebbings: Just such a good dude.
[00:08:38] Harry Stebbings: It's so funny dude.
[00:08:39] Harry Stebbings: I had him on the show when the market cap was in the dumps
[00:08:42] Harry Stebbings: and fuck me, he was in the dumps.
[00:08:44] Harry Stebbings: And I had him on the show when the market cap was riding high.
[00:08:46] Harry Stebbings: And this man was like lighter than air.
[00:08:48] Harry Stebbings: He was so happy, he was so positive.
[00:08:52] Harry Stebbings: I was like, whoever says that your happiness
[00:08:54] Harry Stebbings: is not correlated to market cap light.
[00:08:58] Harry Stebbings: Why is the competition so intense with polymarket?
[00:09:03] Harry Stebbings: We're great friends with Alex at Deal.
[00:09:05] Harry Stebbings: The deal we're at playing and you and polymarket
[00:09:08] Harry Stebbings: are similar in ferocity.
[00:09:10] Harry Stebbings: That's probably even trumps you.
[00:09:12] Harry Stebbings: But why is your so intense?
[00:09:15] Harry Stebbings: There's a little bit of spectacle around these things.
[00:09:16] Tarek Mansour: You know how like, when I had to ask this question,
[00:09:18] Tarek Mansour: I think a little bit about boxing, you know,
[00:09:20] Tarek Mansour: I always wonder like, do these boxers actually hate each other
[00:09:23] Tarek Mansour: or like are you doing it for the show, right?
[00:09:25] Tarek Mansour: Like do they go back and you know,
[00:09:26] Tarek Mansour: after they punch each other kind of in the wing event
[00:09:29] Tarek Mansour: or whatever, do they go back, you know,
[00:09:32] Tarek Mansour: in the back room and they sort of like,
[00:09:34] Tarek Mansour: you know, hang with each other and you know,
[00:09:35] Tarek Mansour: I don't know like, you know,
[00:09:36] Tarek Mansour: the Davi Char and move on.
[00:09:38] Tarek Mansour: I always wonder that and probably there's some truth to that.
[00:09:40] Tarek Mansour: I look, I think people like rivalries
[00:09:43] Tarek Mansour: and like they, you know, they sort of like scale them
[00:09:48] Tarek Mansour: and amplify them and grow them.
[00:09:50] Tarek Mansour: And you know, it's more fun to watch a calcium polymarket
[00:09:54] Tarek Mansour: than to not watch a calcium polymarket.
[00:09:58] Tarek Mansour: And I get you, but like replaying hate deal
[00:10:02] Harry Stebbings: and deal hate replay.
[00:10:03] Harry Stebbings: I don't know if they do.
[00:10:04] Tarek Mansour: I don't know if there's that.
[00:10:05] Tarek Mansour: I mean, look, we've had our differences
[00:10:07] Tarek Mansour: and we've had real conflicts.
[00:10:09] Tarek Mansour: Then there's no question about that.
[00:10:10] Tarek Mansour: And I think both companies have made mistakes in the past.
[00:10:13] Tarek Mansour: Maybe the fortunately neither of us have maybe escalated
[00:10:16] Tarek Mansour: to that level, to the replay and deal level.
[00:10:19] Tarek Mansour: But like, you know, we made a mistake last year
[00:10:22] Tarek Mansour: with the, you know, we had a, you know,
[00:10:24] Tarek Mansour: both of us have been sort of playing games
[00:10:26] Tarek Mansour: against each other for years now
[00:10:28] Tarek Mansour: because we're competitors.
[00:10:29] Tarek Mansour: And there was one last year that sort of, you know,
[00:10:32] Tarek Mansour: they promoted and there's like a whole backstory to it.
[00:10:34] Tarek Mansour: That was a mistake made a clear to the team,
[00:10:36] Tarek Mansour: like don't ever do this again.
[00:10:37] Tarek Mansour: Can I just, what do you learn from it?
[00:10:39] Harry Stebbings: You know, I specifically, for example,
[00:10:41] Harry Stebbings: when I left my old fund, you know,
[00:10:43] Harry Stebbings: I was very quick in leaving and I really
[00:10:45] Harry Stebbings: left no time for transition.
[00:10:46] Harry Stebbings: I was quite thoughtless in my old partner.
[00:10:49] Harry Stebbings: And I really regret that.
[00:10:50] Harry Stebbings: I'm like, I should have given more time,
[00:10:52] Harry Stebbings: been more thoughtful and caring.
[00:10:54] Harry Stebbings: And with the benefit of hindsight,
[00:10:56] Harry Stebbings: I would have done it differently.
[00:10:58] Benefits of age, when you reflect
[00:11:01] Harry Stebbings: on the mistake that you mentioned that,
[00:11:03] Harry Stebbings: is there a takeaway for you?
[00:11:05] Harry Stebbings: I think it's like, the way I think of it is like,
[00:11:07] Tarek Mansour: I think the, what I'm really,
[00:11:10] Tarek Mansour: what I'm learning over time is that an industry
[00:11:12] Tarek Mansour: truly becomes an industry when there's a rivalry
[00:11:15] Tarek Mansour: because that rivalry will push you,
[00:11:20] will push you to, will push you beyond the,
[00:11:23] Tarek Mansour: like the limits of what you thought you could get to.
[00:11:25] Tarek Mansour: That's just how these rivalries work,
[00:11:27] Tarek Mansour: like Messier Ronaldo, right?
[00:11:29] Tarek Mansour: Like, they're both considered,
[00:11:32] Tarek Mansour: but actually the greatest of all time.
[00:11:33] Tarek Mansour: Well, I think Messier's the greatest of all time,
[00:11:35] Tarek Mansour: but this is the bid for all the day.
[00:11:36] Tarek Mansour: But like, and they live in the same era.
[00:11:37] Tarek Mansour: And I think there's correlation in that.
[00:11:39] Tarek Mansour: I don't, I work causation.
[00:11:40] Tarek Mansour: I don't think this is sort of like,
[00:11:41] Tarek Mansour: you know, they just happen to be born in the same time.
[00:11:44] Tarek Mansour: You know, Tom Brady and Manning,
[00:11:46] Tarek Mansour: and when Tom Brady kind of reflected on that back in the days,
[00:11:49] Tarek Mansour: like, you know, we were like the most ferocious
[00:11:51] Tarek Mansour: on the field and we fought each other.
[00:11:53] Tarek Mansour: But then over time, we got, in some ways,
[00:11:54] Tarek Mansour: he became grateful for that because he realized that
[00:11:57] Tarek Mansour: without Manning being in their advice,
[00:11:59] Tarek Mansour: Versa, he would have never achieved what he achieved.
[00:12:03] Tarek Mansour: And I think that's happening in prediction markets.
[00:12:05] Tarek Mansour: Like, I think that like, without polymarket,
[00:12:08] Tarek Mansour: we wouldn't have, I think like, pushed our marketing
[00:12:13] Tarek Mansour: and pushed our product as hard.
[00:12:15] Tarek Mansour: And without us, they wouldn't have pushed our market
[00:12:17] Tarek Mansour: and their product and maybe also,
[00:12:18] Tarek Mansour: without us the kind of the regulatory piece
[00:12:20] Tarek Mansour: that we've unlocked as hard.
[00:12:21] Tarek Mansour: And so that sort of infighting, I think,
[00:12:23] Tarek Mansour: is going to push both of us to scale this industry
[00:12:26] Tarek Mansour: and reach heights that we honestly
[00:12:28] Tarek Mansour: wouldn't have been able to otherwise,
[00:12:30] Tarek Mansour: which long-term is actually net positive for the customer.
[00:12:32] Tarek Mansour: Like, the net winner of all of this,
[00:12:34] Tarek Mansour: the people that are happiest here,
[00:12:35] Tarek Mansour: is these early evangelists in prediction markets
[00:12:38] Tarek Mansour: that now have seen their market grow
[00:12:40] Tarek Mansour: from this sort of weird corner of the internet
[00:12:43] to like a massive industry, right?
[00:12:45] Tarek Mansour: Like, it literally starting to look like a stock market.
[00:12:47] Tarek Mansour: And a de-respect, shame in polymarket
[00:12:50] Harry Stebbings: more than any other competitor.
[00:12:53] Tarek Mansour: I don't like relatives like that, you know what I mean?
[00:12:55] Tarek Mansour: Like, I think, it depends on what you mean, right?
[00:12:57] Tarek Mansour: There's like, you know, a lot of really great companies
[00:12:59] Tarek Mansour: in the space, you know, especially like bigger companies,
[00:13:01] Tarek Mansour: legacy companies.
[00:13:02] Tarek Mansour: I respect CME a lot, even though they're like an incumbent legacy.
[00:13:06] Tarek Mansour: But as a business, it's really an incredible business
[00:13:09] Tarek Mansour: what they built.
[00:13:10] Tarek Mansour: And the modes that they have, I think, you know,
[00:13:13] Tarek Mansour: obviously some of the traditional players, like,
[00:13:15] Tarek Mansour: you know, drafts can then fend old, they have really effective,
[00:13:18] Tarek Mansour: I would say like marketing machines,
[00:13:20] Tarek Mansour: they're like some of the best spenders of dollars
[00:13:22] Tarek Mansour: on the planet.
[00:13:23] Tarek Mansour: So maybe in an absolute terms,
[00:13:24] Tarek Mansour: let me look, I think they,
[00:13:25] Tarek Mansour: some are like, poly has done an incredible job at marketing.
[00:13:28] Tarek Mansour: They build a good brand.
[00:13:30] Tarek Mansour: And we learn from that.
[00:13:31] Tarek Mansour: And I think, you know,
[00:13:32] Tarek Mansour: Kouchy has gotten really good this year on that front.
[00:13:36] Tarek Mansour: What do you not do in brand today that you would like to do?
[00:13:40] Tarek Mansour: So this week, we've announced,
[00:13:43] Tarek Mansour: well, we've found the first and then the second,
[00:13:45] Tarek Mansour: large-scale news network partnership with the prediction market.
[00:13:49] Tarek Mansour: So we announced CNN, it was a partnership,
[00:13:51] Tarek Mansour: and then CNBC the same thing.
[00:13:53] Tarek Mansour: The next day, and those have always been dream partnerships
[00:13:57] Tarek Mansour: of ours.
[00:13:58] Tarek Mansour: And there's more to come because this idea of just like
[00:14:00] Tarek Mansour: embedding prediction markets in the news.
[00:14:02] Tarek Mansour: You know, there's like so much symbiosis here,
[00:14:04] Tarek Mansour: which is like, the news can get better from prediction markets
[00:14:08] Tarek Mansour: because prediction markets are like this sort of,
[00:14:09] Tarek Mansour: you know, think of it as like the news covers what's happening now.
[00:14:12] Tarek Mansour: prediction markets can extend the news to cover what's about
[00:14:14] Tarek Mansour: to happen next, which is kind of the next sort of
[00:14:17] Tarek Mansour: of next iteration of news.
[00:14:18] Tarek Mansour: And that prediction markets can benefit from the news
[00:14:20] Tarek Mansour: because you can create that habit, which is like,
[00:14:22] Tarek Mansour: I read a market, I read something about whether the Fed
[00:14:24] Tarek Mansour: is going to raise interest in the economy.
[00:14:26] Tarek Mansour: I can maybe directly trade on it and put a position.
[00:14:28] Tarek Mansour: And so they read gel, we weld together.
[00:14:31] Tarek Mansour: There's obviously sports, leagues,
[00:14:33] Tarek Mansour: I think some authority figures and filets,
[00:14:35] Tarek Mansour: but I actually think the bigger thing for us
[00:14:37] Tarek Mansour: that I think we're learning over time that we have to do,
[00:14:40] Tarek Mansour: that we're doing, starting to do a better job at,
[00:14:42] Tarek Mansour: is you just got to tell the story of the company.
[00:14:44] Tarek Mansour: And we haven't done as much of that because, you know,
[00:14:47] Tarek Mansour: what I realized is the story actually resonates.
[00:14:49] Tarek Mansour: And it resonates with our customers,
[00:14:51] Tarek Mansour: it resonates with partners,
[00:14:51] Tarek Mansour: it also resonates with sort of like aspiring entrepreneurs.
[00:14:54] Tarek Mansour: They're starting this kind of, whatever they're starting.
[00:14:58] Tarek Mansour: Because when you look back at the story of CalShi,
[00:15:00] Tarek Mansour: like the one thing I always tell people like that I think
[00:15:02] Tarek Mansour: is the thing that spiked for us.
[00:15:05] Tarek Mansour: And look, I think we're competent,
[00:15:07] Tarek Mansour: I think we're smart, I think we have great strategy,
[00:15:08] Tarek Mansour: we work hard, but I think it's resilience.
[00:15:11] Tarek Mansour: I think we were so deeply committed
[00:15:13] Tarek Mansour: to making this thing work.
[00:15:14] Tarek Mansour: And in some ways, even for me, the beautiful outcome here,
[00:15:19] Tarek Mansour: maybe the outcome is giving us a beautiful lesson,
[00:15:21] Tarek Mansour: which is like, you truly can wall something into existence.
[00:15:24] Tarek Mansour: You really can.
[00:15:25] Tarek Mansour: And it's kind of amazing to see that play out.
[00:15:27] Tarek Mansour: I mean, I've had my doubts over the years, obviously,
[00:15:29] Tarek Mansour: but it really did work out.
[00:15:30] Tarek Mansour: And I think we got to get that story out there.
[00:15:32] Tarek Mansour: Totally get you.
[00:15:33] Harry Stebbings: I spoke to Don Stolter before this show.
[00:15:37] Harry Stebbings: And he asked you, you're tied to that resilience.
[00:15:39] Harry Stebbings: What was your lowest day?
[00:15:41] Harry Stebbings: And what did your mind tell you in that lowest day?
[00:15:45] Harry Stebbings: It's really hard.
[00:15:46] Harry Stebbings: I've had so many low days throughout the last.
[00:15:49] Harry Stebbings: I'm saying, so I'll tell you, are we lost three anchors
[00:15:52] Harry Stebbings: for our fundraiser?
[00:15:54] Harry Stebbings: And I had to cool my mom up, crying,
[00:15:56] Harry Stebbings: walking through London in the rain.
[00:15:58] Harry Stebbings: And she just told me the harder it is,
[00:16:01] Harry Stebbings: the better the story comes out of it.
[00:16:03] Harry Stebbings: Yes, and I always remember that.
[00:16:07] So I think one of the harshest moments
[00:16:11] Tarek Mansour: in the history of the company,
[00:16:12] Tarek Mansour: where we spent three years to get regulated up front.
[00:16:17] Tarek Mansour: Then we got legalized for Asian markets.
[00:16:20] Tarek Mansour: Finally, we could be able to launch.
[00:16:21] Tarek Mansour: Then we got blocked about the launch on the launch.
[00:16:23] Tarek Mansour: And then at the end of 2021,
[00:16:25] Tarek Mansour: we started working on doing the election market
[00:16:29] to get it in time for the 2022 midterm election.
[00:16:34] And we had a team, we bet an entire kind of two years on that.
[00:16:40] And then the government pocket vetoed.
[00:16:43] Tarek Mansour: So they delayed their approval till past the midterms
[00:16:46] Tarek Mansour: to not give it to us in time.
[00:16:48] Tarek Mansour: I think that was the day that that happened,
[00:16:51] Tarek Mansour: you could feel there's a sort of feeling
[00:16:54] Tarek Mansour: that you know in the room that something's changed
[00:16:56] Tarek Mansour: or people just lose confidence in you.
[00:17:00] Tarek Mansour: It's like, because when things like that happen,
[00:17:03] Tarek Mansour: people oftentimes question the strategy
[00:17:05] Tarek Mansour: and they question the decisions.
[00:17:09] Tarek Mansour: And so we lost a lot of the team over it.
[00:17:14] Tarek Mansour: We, I could feel that the trust in the faith
[00:17:17] Tarek Mansour: in the company had kind of plummeted.
[00:17:19] Tarek Mansour: It was zero on that one.
[00:17:21] So very similar actually,
[00:17:22] Tarek Mansour: I, it's one of those moments where you kind of walk out
[00:17:25] Tarek Mansour: of the office and you actually feel physical pain
[00:17:27] Tarek Mansour: in your stomach.
[00:17:28] Tarek Mansour: You know what I'm talking about?
[00:17:29] Tarek Mansour: There's this feeling of hopelessness,
[00:17:33] Tarek Mansour: that it is done, that we're not, this is it.
[00:17:36] Tarek Mansour: And I also called my mom, and I was like,
[00:17:39] Tarek Mansour: I don't think this is it.
[00:17:41] Tarek Mansour: This is the end of the world.
[00:17:43] Tarek Mansour: And then you know, she's religious,
[00:17:48] Tarek Mansour: she's like, well don't worry,
[00:17:49] Tarek Mansour: I asked one of the saints that I let,
[00:17:51] Tarek Mansour: popular in Lebanon, I was like, don't worry at all.
[00:17:53] Tarek Mansour: I asked to say, you know, I got the signs that I need,
[00:17:56] Tarek Mansour: this company is going to be massive.
[00:17:59] Tarek Mansour: And you know, obviously that's a very hard thing
[00:18:02] Tarek Mansour: for me to kind of like stand on.
[00:18:03] Tarek Mansour: But like the one thing that's always been very good
[00:18:05] Tarek Mansour: about Luan and I is like, we have gotten so gut punched,
[00:18:08] Tarek Mansour: so many times in this for the company.
[00:18:10] Tarek Mansour: True really are gut punches.
[00:18:12] Tarek Mansour: And we stood, you know, stood back up.
[00:18:14] Tarek Mansour: And like that one, so we took a day to kind of recover,
[00:18:17] Tarek Mansour: the next day we came back and we were like,
[00:18:19] Tarek Mansour: we're gonna try again for the 2024 election.
[00:18:22] Tarek Mansour: And then we tried another year till the end of 2023,
[00:18:25] Tarek Mansour: then the government blocked it again.
[00:18:27] And then, so that's the second time.
[00:18:30] Tarek Mansour: And then gut punch, same exact deal.
[00:18:34] Tarek Mansour: Plus another big chunk of the team,
[00:18:35] Tarek Mansour: you know, horrible kind of situation.
[00:18:37] Tarek Mansour: You know, this was the moment where we're like,
[00:18:38] Tarek Mansour: we're gonna try third time.
[00:18:40] Tarek Mansour: And this time we're gonna sue the government
[00:18:41] Tarek Mansour: over the selection market.
[00:18:43] Tarek Mansour: So three years just kind of going through
[00:18:45] Tarek Mansour: that absolutely intolerable pain.
[00:18:48] Tarek Mansour: Up until kind of, you know, obviously we got rewarded
[00:18:50] Tarek Mansour: at the end of 2024, we'll be actually one.
[00:18:52] Tarek Mansour: But it took three different trials and three different years.
[00:18:54] Tarek Mansour: The hardest days of the stories that you tell,
[00:18:58] did you ever like down your leadership?
[00:19:00] Harry Stebbings: The answer is yes, right?
[00:19:01] Tarek Mansour: So at times, even even today,
[00:19:03] Tarek Mansour: I mean, you always doubt like, because as, as,
[00:19:07] Tarek Mansour: you know, when you're building a company
[00:19:08] Tarek Mansour: that's just going after a large market and, you know,
[00:19:11] Tarek Mansour: first not working, then it starts working,
[00:19:13] Tarek Mansour: then it goes back to not working,
[00:19:15] Tarek Mansour: and then you do that 10 times.
[00:19:16] Tarek Mansour: And then then it works really really well,
[00:19:18] Tarek Mansour: but then everything starts breaking.
[00:19:19] Tarek Mansour: And this is maybe the phase we're in.
[00:19:22] Tarek Mansour: And then you start fixing some of the things
[00:19:23] Tarek Mansour: but then more things start breaking.
[00:19:24] Tarek Mansour: You have to continuously kind of shift yourself
[00:19:27] Tarek Mansour: as founder and then CEO.
[00:19:29] Tarek Mansour: And evolve yourself.
[00:19:30] Tarek Mansour: And there's always questions like,
[00:19:31] Tarek Mansour: am I gonna be able to kind of do this next phase, right?
[00:19:35] Tarek Mansour: And like, what are you not sure that you're able to do today?
[00:19:38] Tarek Mansour: I think that for us, it's the time at a company
[00:19:42] Tarek Mansour: where we need to evolve into sort of like
[00:19:45] Tarek Mansour: into a more structured organization
[00:19:48] Tarek Mansour: and build the right set of processes and systems
[00:19:51] Tarek Mansour: and the company.
[00:19:53] Tarek Mansour: And we haven't done that before.
[00:19:54] Tarek Mansour: And, you know, well, that's kind of the next big challenge
[00:19:58] Tarek Mansour: or just like, you know, am I gonna scale to the occasion
[00:20:00] Tarek Mansour: and be able to do it while, you know,
[00:20:01] Tarek Mansour: keep accelerating the growth of the company
[00:20:03] Tarek Mansour: and not sort of compromise on the growth?
[00:20:05] Tarek Mansour: And that's a hard problem.
[00:20:06] Tarek Mansour: And the reason all these problems are hard
[00:20:08] Tarek Mansour: is there's no answer, right?
[00:20:09] Tarek Mansour: Like there's no recipe, there's no book.
[00:20:11] Tarek Mansour: It really depends on you, your company,
[00:20:12] Tarek Mansour: the circumstances, you have to kind of go through it
[00:20:14] Tarek Mansour: and you have to go, you have to make a bunch of mistakes
[00:20:17] Tarek Mansour: as you go through it.
[00:20:20] Tarek Mansour: And you never know if it's gonna work out exactly
[00:20:21] Tarek Mansour: the way that you want it to work out.
[00:20:23] Tarek Mansour: So what function do you think is weakest today?
[00:20:28] That's a good question.
[00:20:29] Tarek Mansour: And I think marketing at the beginning of the year
[00:20:32] Tarek Mansour: was kind of a lot of where I spent my time.
[00:20:34] Tarek Mansour: I think like, it's less about some specific department lacking
[00:20:37] Tarek Mansour: but more about like consistency now.
[00:20:40] Tarek Mansour: How do we move that into like a scaled, consistent set
[00:20:44] Tarek Mansour: of habits in the company rather than like a series of sprints?
[00:20:48] Tarek Mansour: Can I ask you a weird one, dude,
[00:20:50] Harry Stebbings: which is like, if the world is financialized by Kowshi,
[00:20:54] is that actually good for the world?
[00:20:56] Tarek Mansour: I think there's two very important dimensions here.
[00:20:58] Tarek Mansour: So the answer is unequivocally yes.
[00:21:00] Tarek Mansour: Like more free markets generally tend to more positive outcomes.
[00:21:04] Tarek Mansour: Always.
[00:21:05] Tarek Mansour: But the thing that struck me is like,
[00:21:07] Tarek Mansour: the current financial markets,
[00:21:09] Tarek Mansour: they don't relate to a lot of people.
[00:21:11] Tarek Mansour: Like, you know, trading stocks or options or futures.
[00:21:14] Tarek Mansour: Like people don't really understand them
[00:21:15] Tarek Mansour: and the game is sort of rigged.
[00:21:17] Tarek Mansour: It's rigged on behalf of like four wall street
[00:21:19] Tarek Mansour: against mainstream against the average person
[00:21:22] Tarek Mansour: because you never can win against wall street
[00:21:24] Tarek Mansour: on like where stock is gonna go or right and option
[00:21:26] Tarek Mansour: and go because they've all the asymmetric information.
[00:21:28] Tarek Mansour: The thing that got me excited about building this
[00:21:29] Tarek Mansour: is like actually there's an opportunity
[00:21:31] Tarek Mansour: to build a financial market for a market
[00:21:33] Tarek Mansour: that relates to anyone, that anyone can relate to.
[00:21:36] Tarek Mansour: And like one of my core beliefs,
[00:21:38] Tarek Mansour: like everyone is an expert on something.
[00:21:40] Like everyone has a, has, you know,
[00:21:42] Tarek Mansour: reads the news about certain things
[00:21:44] Tarek Mansour: or has passion about like specific,
[00:21:45] Tarek Mansour: some like like really the vast majority of people
[00:21:47] Tarek Mansour: have specific passions or really excited about specific vertical.
[00:21:51] Tarek Mansour: And Kowshi is really a way to kind of get them
[00:21:53] Tarek Mansour: to participate in financial market on that vertical
[00:21:55] Tarek Mansour: that is their home turf,
[00:21:57] where they are not kind of facing somebody
[00:21:58] Tarek Mansour: who has more information than them.
[00:22:00] Tarek Mansour: A hedge fund or, you know,
[00:22:01] Harry Stebbings: I'm sure you've seen pro sports traders.
[00:22:04] Harry Stebbings: Yeah.
[00:22:05] Harry Stebbings: They have every insight on every player
[00:22:07] Harry Stebbings: and every injury and every weather win pattern.
[00:22:10] Harry Stebbings: The standards guy girl batting on an NHL game
[00:22:15] Harry Stebbings: on Sunday, I think you said, doesn't have that.
[00:22:17] Harry Stebbings: Is it not just like increasing access
[00:22:19] Harry Stebbings: to a different field where there are different pros?
[00:22:22] Harry Stebbings: I think it's part of it.
[00:22:23] Harry Stebbings: I mean like I don't mean that Citadel and Wall Street
[00:22:26] Tarek Mansour: has asymmetric information.
[00:22:28] Tarek Mansour: For example, our political process
[00:22:29] Tarek Mansour: and you start with the election.
[00:22:30] Tarek Mansour: Like the best traders in the, you know, in politics,
[00:22:34] Tarek Mansour: what bills is gonna pass,
[00:22:35] Tarek Mansour: who's gonna win election,
[00:22:36] Tarek Mansour: they're people that love politics.
[00:22:39] Tarek Mansour: They're not Wall Street.
[00:22:40] Tarek Mansour: Like Wall Street is good
[00:22:41] Tarek Mansour: and they can like get smarter over time.
[00:22:43] Tarek Mansour: But where Wall Street is really good
[00:22:44] Tarek Mansour: is seeing kind of like what hedge fund and mutual fund
[00:22:47] Tarek Mansour: and whatever is buying which stock
[00:22:49] Tarek Mansour: and they can know where a stock is gonna go better
[00:22:50] Tarek Mansour: than the average person.
[00:22:52] Tarek Mansour: But a lot of people have a lot of insight about politics.
[00:22:56] Tarek Mansour: Why?
[00:22:56] Tarek Mansour: Because they've been following politics for a decade or two.
[00:22:59] Tarek Mansour: And you see to the numbers,
[00:23:00] Tarek Mansour: these are some of the most successful traders on CalShi.
[00:23:02] Tarek Mansour: But there's another kind of facet to this,
[00:23:04] Tarek Mansour: to this with straight, very important is that
[00:23:07] the prediction market user is not just a trader.
[00:23:10] Tarek Mansour: Actually, out of every 100 prediction market users,
[00:23:13] Tarek Mansour: maybe there's like one or two traders
[00:23:15] Tarek Mansour: that are actually trading on the market.
[00:23:17] Tarek Mansour: But the rest of the users are getting informed about the world.
[00:23:20] Tarek Mansour: It's really a form of news, it's form of media.
[00:23:22] Tarek Mansour: It's a way to basically comment like, you know,
[00:23:24] Tarek Mansour: get truth about what's gonna happen next.
[00:23:26] Tarek Mansour: In a world where like actually,
[00:23:28] Tarek Mansour: it's been really hard to figure out what's happening.
[00:23:30] Tarek Mansour: And you see this at the every election,
[00:23:32] Tarek Mansour: big election, people flock to CalShi
[00:23:34] Tarek Mansour: because you go on the traditional news networks
[00:23:36] Tarek Mansour: and like, you don't know who won
[00:23:38] Tarek Mansour: until five, six, seven hours after CalShi, right?
[00:23:42] Tarek Mansour: And that's extremely valuable.
[00:23:44] Tarek Mansour: If you can see and get a little bit smarter about the future,
[00:23:47] we can make better decisions over time,
[00:23:48] Tarek Mansour: allocate resources better, and manage risks better.
[00:23:53] Harry Stebbings: And I think that's a very positive thing.
[00:23:55] Harry Stebbings: It's really interesting inside that one out of every 100
[00:23:57] Harry Stebbings: is a trade or one or two is a trader
[00:23:59] Harry Stebbings: and the rest of what I call in social lurkers.
[00:24:01] Harry Stebbings: You know, people sit and watch on the sidelines.
[00:24:04] Harry Stebbings: The question then becomes,
[00:24:06] Harry Stebbings: and a lot of your investors ask this,
[00:24:08] Harry Stebbings: why partner with the legacy media brand like CNN or CNBC
[00:24:12] Harry Stebbings: when you could actually own the vertical,
[00:24:15] Harry Stebbings: you have the money, dude.
[00:24:16] Harry Stebbings: You could build the media brand and the media platform
[00:24:20] Harry Stebbings: and own the entire stack.
[00:24:21] Harry Stebbings: Why partner with legacy?
[00:24:23] Harry Stebbings: And how long before that legacy partnership
[00:24:26] Harry Stebbings: becomes cannibalism?
[00:24:28] Harry Stebbings: I think they're not mutually exclusive.
[00:24:30] Tarek Mansour: And I think that's a fair question.
[00:24:32] Tarek Mansour: I just think that right now we're so early
[00:24:35] Tarek Mansour: that it's hard to think about cannibalism
[00:24:36] Tarek Mansour: or think about any of this is zero sum question, right?
[00:24:40] Tarek Mansour: It was just so early.
[00:24:41] Tarek Mansour: The not-persons people that understand
[00:24:42] Tarek Mansour: deeply on a separate X-Market are still so small.
[00:24:45] Tarek Mansour: There's so much education to do.
[00:24:46] Tarek Mansour: And I think the news and partners like CNN and CNBC
[00:24:49] Tarek Mansour: are really an incredible way
[00:24:51] Tarek Mansour: to get people to understand what these markets are about.
[00:24:54] Tarek Mansour: And at the end of the mission of the company
[00:24:56] Tarek Mansour: is like we want to bring more truth
[00:25:00] Tarek Mansour: to a lot of these processes,
[00:25:01] Tarek Mansour: whether it's the election process,
[00:25:03] Tarek Mansour: right now we're using polls and pundits
[00:25:04] Tarek Mansour: and people say whatever they want,
[00:25:06] Tarek Mansour: or whether or climate or the economy
[00:25:08] Tarek Mansour: and how we make decisions about the economy.
[00:25:10] Tarek Mansour: And the best way to do that is like put it in the places
[00:25:12] Tarek Mansour: where people go and take that information,
[00:25:14] Tarek Mansour: get their information about that.
[00:25:15] Tarek Mansour: So imagine where election night coverage
[00:25:19] is informed by prediction markets,
[00:25:21] Tarek Mansour: which actually work better than what we're doing today.
[00:25:25] Tarek Mansour: That is actually not positive
[00:25:26] Tarek Mansour: and the best way to do it as well.
[00:25:28] Tarek Mansour: Let's go to the place where people are going
[00:25:30] Tarek Mansour: together information about the election.
[00:25:31] Tarek Mansour: And I think the news networks are an amazing way to do that.
[00:25:35] Do you not think you can create the next news now?
[00:25:37] Harry Stebbings: I think we can.
[00:25:38] Tarek Mansour: They're not mutually exclusive.
[00:25:39] Tarek Mansour: Like I think we can do both.
[00:25:41] Tarek Mansour: And there's over time, like there's different,
[00:25:46] Tarek Mansour: I mean, even today, right?
[00:25:47] Tarek Mansour: Like not everybody, like there's not a single news network
[00:25:49] Tarek Mansour: that owns all the audience.
[00:25:50] Tarek Mansour: And there's some news networks,
[00:25:52] Tarek Mansour: like CNBC for finance and business, CNN is for politics.
[00:25:56] Tarek Mansour: And so I think they're not mutually exclusive.
[00:26:00] Tarek Mansour: When you look at activity, what's more important?
[00:26:04] Harry Stebbings: Is it breadth or is it like depth?
[00:26:08] Harry Stebbings: Is there 99% of trading and interest
[00:26:11] Harry Stebbings: in a very small number of inventory?
[00:26:14] Harry Stebbings: Or is that breadth massively important?
[00:26:17] Harry Stebbings: Me and your team were talking before this
[00:26:19] Harry Stebbings: about Luana and doing some PR in Brazil
[00:26:22] Harry Stebbings: and just getting the brand in Brazil.
[00:26:24] Harry Stebbings: Is breadth everything?
[00:26:26] Harry Stebbings: Or is it having the 1% that everyone gives a shit about?
[00:26:30] It's a great question.
[00:26:31] Tarek Mansour: We think about this a lot.
[00:26:34] And the unfortunate truth is the answer
[00:26:36] Tarek Mansour: is kind of like a nuance in between.
[00:26:39] Tarek Mansour: You know, you can all go fully vertical
[00:26:43] Tarek Mansour: because then your product offering is not diverse
[00:26:45] Tarek Mansour: and interesting enough.
[00:26:46] Tarek Mansour: And you can all go fully wide
[00:26:47] Tarek Mansour: because then you don't concentrate enough
[00:26:48] Tarek Mansour: for equity and specific events.
[00:26:49] Tarek Mansour: That's what makes it an interesting marketplace problem.
[00:26:52] Tarek Mansour: It's not an easy problem.
[00:26:54] Tarek Mansour: But like, my mental model for this is you have to have breadth,
[00:26:58] Tarek Mansour: like product diversity and making sure
[00:27:01] Tarek Mansour: that people have enough content to engage with
[00:27:04] Tarek Mansour: and markets that are related to the user,
[00:27:05] Tarek Mansour: the things that they read on X is important, right?
[00:27:07] Tarek Mansour: Like if you, and it's a bit similar to X,
[00:27:09] Tarek Mansour: if you want X, you can read about one specific thing all the time.
[00:27:12] Tarek Mansour: Like that's not gonna make a very interesting experience.
[00:27:14] Tarek Mansour: You have to have diversity,
[00:27:15] Tarek Mansour: even if there's specific topics
[00:27:16] Tarek Mansour: that are a divastory majority of the eyeballs.
[00:27:18] Tarek Mansour: So it's just really a balancing,
[00:27:20] Tarek Mansour: a constant balancing act which in the two.
[00:27:24] Totally get that.
[00:27:25] Harry Stebbings: Can I ask you moving to the fund we spoke about
[00:27:28] Harry Stebbings: coming in news network and that also takes money.
[00:27:31] Harry Stebbings: Dawn said, you fought hard to protect early investors
[00:27:34] Harry Stebbings: pro-radi even when top tier funds
[00:27:36] Harry Stebbings: wanted to squeeze the shit out of us.
[00:27:37] Harry Stebbings: Oh, I see, I see, I see.
[00:27:39] Tarek Mansour: That's interesting.
[00:27:41] Tarek Mansour: My mental model for this,
[00:27:43] Tarek Mansour: we're playing a long term iterated infinite game
[00:27:48] and it's sort of like there's a lot of rounds of that game
[00:27:51] Tarek Mansour: and every decision is around.
[00:27:52] Tarek Mansour: And I think it's very important that throughout the game
[00:27:55] Tarek Mansour: and throughout the rounds,
[00:27:56] Tarek Mansour: you build a reputation that where people can trust you
[00:27:58] Tarek Mansour: and can trust that when you have a trade off ahead of you,
[00:28:02] Tarek Mansour: you will not be quick to basically kind of prioritize yourself
[00:28:09] Tarek Mansour: and you're trying to kind of like do right
[00:28:10] Tarek Mansour: by people to the extent you can.
[00:28:12] Tarek Mansour: And it's the same thing like the people that believe
[00:28:14] Tarek Mansour: that us early, right?
[00:28:16] Tarek Mansour: Like even though maybe we don't need them as much right now,
[00:28:18] Tarek Mansour: is my mental model as you need them
[00:28:19] Tarek Mansour: in terms of a reputation and doing a ride by them
[00:28:22] Tarek Mansour: because that compounds.
[00:28:23] Tarek Mansour: And if you're someone that does ride by people around you,
[00:28:26] Tarek Mansour: over time people are gonna wanna work with you.
[00:28:28] Tarek Mansour: And I think the best people, whether it's investors,
[00:28:30] Tarek Mansour: partners, team members, wanna work with people
[00:28:33] Tarek Mansour: that do ride by them.
[00:28:35] Harry Stebbings: Does Sequoia really move the needle in your company?
[00:28:37] Harry Stebbings: Alphardlein is incredible.
[00:28:39] Yes.
[00:28:41] Harry Stebbings: Yes.
[00:28:42] Harry Stebbings: When I had Alex Boosey's on the show,
[00:28:44] Harry Stebbings: he said that Alfred is the one person he doesn't have
[00:28:47] Harry Stebbings: who he would most like to have.
[00:28:48] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, I know.
[00:28:49] Harry Stebbings: He's wise Alfred.
[00:28:50] Harry Stebbings: He's incredible.
[00:28:51] Harry Stebbings: And what specifically makes you say that?
[00:28:53] Harry Stebbings: Alex, think he's so often over the years of Alfred.
[00:28:57] Tarek Mansour: Alfred is a very unique, very unique investor.
[00:29:00] Tarek Mansour: And in many dimensions, but like a few things
[00:29:04] Tarek Mansour: that I really appreciate and admire about Alfred.
[00:29:07] One, he's not the type of investor.
[00:29:10] Tarek Mansour: He's kind of the entities of what you would usually
[00:29:12] Tarek Mansour: imagine if you see it to be, which is like,
[00:29:14] Tarek Mansour: if he's loved to make strong simplistic statements,
[00:29:18] Tarek Mansour: you know, you tweet something like,
[00:29:19] Tarek Mansour: a way to win is like, have a great team.
[00:29:23] Tarek Mansour: And like, Alfred's answer to everything
[00:29:26] Tarek Mansour: is this sort of very nuanced, in the gray, uninteresting,
[00:29:29] Tarek Mansour: uninspiring answer.
[00:29:32] But it tends to be the right answer.
[00:29:33] Tarek Mansour: It like, and most investors like simple kind of like
[00:29:36] Tarek Mansour: structures and frames like, oh, you know,
[00:29:39] Tarek Mansour: the margin like a compress, so the business
[00:29:40] Tarek Mansour: doesn't be very hard.
[00:29:41] Tarek Mansour: Whereas Alfred is like, well, how is the specific
[00:29:44] Tarek Mansour: compression over time?
[00:29:45] Tarek Mansour: It's actually going to be slower than expected.
[00:29:47] Tarek Mansour: And then you're going to grow.
[00:29:48] Tarek Mansour: And it's kind of a lot of like in the gray, you know,
[00:29:51] Tarek Mansour: math and nuance.
[00:29:53] Tarek Mansour: But that helps push you to get to the right balance
[00:29:56] Tarek Mansour: between this and every decision.
[00:29:59] Tarek Mansour: So one is nuance.
[00:30:00] Tarek Mansour: Number two is he's always, always a kind of counterbalancing
[00:30:03] Tarek Mansour: actor.
[00:30:05] So, and the thing I learn with Alfred is every time,
[00:30:07] Tarek Mansour: so if I go with him with idea A, he will argue for the other
[00:30:10] Tarek Mansour: for not a, and if I go with idea not a, he will argue for
[00:30:13] Tarek Mansour: A always systematically.
[00:30:15] Tarek Mansour: He will always argue the other side, always.
[00:30:18] Tarek Mansour: And this is to push me back to the middle,
[00:30:19] Tarek Mansour: to push me back to like, hey, every decision comes with trade
[00:30:22] Tarek Mansour: offs and every problem solution comes with problems.
[00:30:25] Tarek Mansour: And the last part is like, so again, it's kind of,
[00:30:30] Tarek Mansour: maybe there's a theme here is like, when the company is doing
[00:30:33] Tarek Mansour: poor, Alfred is the most optimistic and will come and like be
[00:30:36] Tarek Mansour: excited and push you.
[00:30:37] Tarek Mansour: And when the company is going well, Alfred gets busy.
[00:30:40] Tarek Mansour: He just wants to make sure that you don't get over your head
[00:30:42] Tarek Mansour: and you're like, you know, don't forget,
[00:30:43] Tarek Mansour: dark times are coming again and like, you know, be careful.
[00:30:46] Tarek Mansour: But he's really been there for us from the early, early
[00:30:48] Tarek Mansour: beginnings.
[00:30:49] Tarek Mansour: He's been a huge believer when at times where people really didn't
[00:30:51] Tarek Mansour: believe, was really hard to believe a couch in,
[00:30:53] Tarek Mansour: in couch in times.
[00:30:54] Tarek Mansour: And he was just like always consistent.
[00:30:56] Tarek Mansour: One of the most bullshit statements I think found as saying
[00:30:59] Harry Stebbings: is proliferated is, oh, you never want people who want to join
[00:31:03] Harry Stebbings: your company because an investor is invested.
[00:31:07] Harry Stebbings: I think that's utter crap.
[00:31:09] Harry Stebbings: Because if Sequoia invest, it does increase the chances of success.
[00:31:13] Harry Stebbings: It means you'll have another round of funding.
[00:31:15] Harry Stebbings: It means more good people want to join and people want to make
[00:31:19] Harry Stebbings: money for their families and make money.
[00:31:21] Harry Stebbings: And so it's completely logical that you will get more people
[00:31:24] Harry Stebbings: want to join post-Square investing.
[00:31:27] Harry Stebbings: Do you agree with me?
[00:31:29] Harry Stebbings: Would you take the stance that don't take people who only
[00:31:31] Harry Stebbings: join because of your investor?
[00:31:33] Harry Stebbings: The best people want to win.
[00:31:35] Tarek Mansour: They want to join a winning team.
[00:31:36] Tarek Mansour: And I think having great investors is one sign out of many others
[00:31:40] Tarek Mansour: that you are on a winning team.
[00:31:42] Tarek Mansour: So I think expecting people to disregard that altogether
[00:31:47] Tarek Mansour: is that probably you're probably pushing out
[00:31:50] Tarek Mansour: or excluding some people that are winners, people that
[00:31:53] Tarek Mansour: really want to win.
[00:31:54] Tarek Mansour: But at the same time, you have to make sure you're picking
[00:31:57] Tarek Mansour: people that are going to do what they're going to really work hard
[00:31:59] Tarek Mansour: and do whatever it takes to win.
[00:32:01] Tarek Mansour: As long as they believe that this is a winning company
[00:32:03] Tarek Mansour: and a winning formula.
[00:32:05] Tarek Mansour: So my answer is I don't think that people that have
[00:32:09] Tarek Mansour: used to go on the cap table as strong signal are bad people
[00:32:12] Tarek Mansour: at all.
[00:32:12] Tarek Mansour: I think no, but I think you still have to do the diligence
[00:32:15] Tarek Mansour: and the interview is this person just joining just for free
[00:32:19] Tarek Mansour: ticket on a ride or is this person joining to make that ride
[00:32:21] Tarek Mansour: cool, accelerate even harder.
[00:32:23] Tarek Mansour: And I'm going to do whatever it takes and work however hard
[00:32:25] Tarek Mansour: to make it happen.
[00:32:27] Tarek Mansour: The answer to that is yes.
[00:32:28] Tarek Mansour: Then by all means, it should hire that person.
[00:32:31] Which invested you not have that you
[00:32:33] Harry Stebbings: would most like to have if Alex is was Alfred?
[00:32:36] Harry Stebbings: Who's yours?
[00:32:37] Harry Stebbings: Well, the most recent round, Neil Meadow came in
[00:32:40] Tarek Mansour: in small capacity.
[00:32:41] Tarek Mansour: I've always wanted to have Neil involved.
[00:32:42] Tarek Mansour: He's just such an incredibly smart person.
[00:32:45] Tarek Mansour: Every time I talk to him, why did you not let Neil come
[00:32:48] Harry Stebbings: in in a bigger capacity?
[00:32:50] Tarek Mansour: It's not like a mostly mean driven.
[00:32:53] Tarek Mansour: We've just chatted towards the end of the round.
[00:32:55] Tarek Mansour: We just decided to do something small.
[00:32:58] Tarek Mansour: I think who do we love to have?
[00:33:03] Tarek Mansour: I have a lot of respect for Rivet and Mickey.
[00:33:05] Tarek Mansour: I have a lot of respect for founders
[00:33:06] Tarek Mansour: for and I have a lot of respect for Alta Mitre.
[00:33:10] Tarek Mansour: A lot of the crossovers in the public funds are also great.
[00:33:13] Tarek Mansour: Learning from people is very important.
[00:33:16] Harry Stebbings: One of your investors asked something
[00:33:18] Harry Stebbings: that they asked not to be attributed, which I'm honoring.
[00:33:22] Harry Stebbings: But they said, did you ever cross pass with SBF?
[00:33:25] And what did you learn from observing FTI's?
[00:33:28] Harry Stebbings: His implosion?
[00:33:28] Harry Stebbings: I got to know who this investor is.
[00:33:30] Tarek Mansour: Yeah, the answer is yes.
[00:33:32] Tarek Mansour: So actually, the funny story is,
[00:33:34] Tarek Mansour: as BF, when I was a freshman at MIT,
[00:33:36] Tarek Mansour: he interviewed me for Jade Street.
[00:33:39] Tarek Mansour: And so I had known him since then.
[00:33:41] Tarek Mansour: And then when he came into the US with the FTIX,
[00:33:43] Tarek Mansour: we met once.
[00:33:45] Tarek Mansour: We were never really close.
[00:33:46] Tarek Mansour: He was also kind of close.
[00:33:48] Tarek Mansour: He was kind of cold towards us when things were going well.
[00:33:51] Tarek Mansour: And I think Galsh has had a history of people
[00:33:54] Tarek Mansour: who are sort of looking down on us a lot.
[00:33:56] Tarek Mansour: And we were a smaller company, and we weren't asked success
[00:33:59] Tarek Mansour: when we were doing the regulated route.
[00:34:01] Tarek Mansour: We were focusing on regulation.
[00:34:02] Tarek Mansour: We're like, we want to do it right.
[00:34:03] Tarek Mansour: We want to do it clean, compliant, regulated first.
[00:34:05] Tarek Mansour: And in those years, it was very unsexy to be that company.
[00:34:10] Tarek Mansour: Like, yeah, the FTIX, everything was crazy.
[00:34:13] Tarek Mansour: And all the unregulated offshore, free-for-all,
[00:34:17] Tarek Mansour: those were the sexy companies.
[00:34:19] Tarek Mansour: Those were the companies breaking rules and winning.
[00:34:21] Tarek Mansour: And we were seeing as sort of the safe, boring doozers.
[00:34:25] Tarek Mansour: Like, we were committed.
[00:34:27] Tarek Mansour: We were like, we are not going to do this
[00:34:30] unless the government approves it.
[00:34:31] Tarek Mansour: I have always been unwavering in my belief,
[00:34:33] Tarek Mansour: saying what do I want to do?
[00:34:34] Tarek Mansour: Regulatory first.
[00:34:35] Tarek Mansour: And the reason is, because I think
[00:34:37] Tarek Mansour: in financial service and healthcare,
[00:34:39] the only way to build something that will last the test of time
[00:34:42] Tarek Mansour: and that will truly go mainstream is to work with regulators,
[00:34:45] Tarek Mansour: to do it clean, to do it right.
[00:34:47] Tarek Mansour: And so maybe the learning came afterwards, which was like,
[00:34:50] Tarek Mansour: you know, at times you have doubts, right?
[00:34:52] Tarek Mansour: Investors like why you're not growing like FTIX,
[00:34:54] Tarek Mansour: why you're not doing this, maybe you should go offshore,
[00:34:56] Tarek Mansour: you should do that.
[00:34:57] Tarek Mansour: And you start doubting yourself.
[00:34:58] Tarek Mansour: And like, maybe the learning was like,
[00:34:59] Tarek Mansour: honestly, just like, stay true to your approach.
[00:35:02] Tarek Mansour: Like, if you really have high conviction,
[00:35:03] Tarek Mansour: forget everything going around you,
[00:35:05] Tarek Mansour: no matter the valuations, no matter what's building,
[00:35:07] Tarek Mansour: stay true to your approach.
[00:35:09] When did you stay true to your approach
[00:35:12] Harry Stebbings: where you should have changed?
[00:35:14] Harry Stebbings: For example, for me, I believe for many years,
[00:35:17] Harry Stebbings: the audio was our platform.
[00:35:18] Harry Stebbings: We don't do video, people don't feel as comfortable
[00:35:21] Harry Stebbings: on video, it should be audio.
[00:35:24] I was stupid and we should have moved to video much sooner.
[00:35:27] Harry Stebbings: Yeah. When did you stay true
[00:35:28] Harry Stebbings: and you should have moved and what did you learn?
[00:35:30] Harry Stebbings: And this is going to sound a little bit unusual.
[00:35:32] Tarek Mansour: I was too product driven for too long.
[00:35:37] Tarek Mansour: Like, I think I was always like,
[00:35:39] Tarek Mansour: we got to build the product and make it absolutely perfect.
[00:35:42] Tarek Mansour: And it needs to grow, you know,
[00:35:44] Tarek Mansour: and grow really fast organically.
[00:35:45] Tarek Mansour: And then we basically do more marketing
[00:35:49] Tarek Mansour: and build a brand.
[00:35:52] Tarek Mansour: And I actually think you have to build both together.
[00:35:56] Tarek Mansour: And I think if I were to do it again,
[00:35:57] Tarek Mansour: I would really be thinking about building both together.
[00:35:59] Tarek Mansour: You're probably going to be perfect, right?
[00:36:00] Tarek Mansour: Like, it evolves and it shifts and it improves over time.
[00:36:04] Tarek Mansour: And the brand, you have to learn it.
[00:36:06] Tarek Mansour: It's a muscle, right?
[00:36:07] Tarek Mansour: The growth in marketing and brand is not something
[00:36:09] Tarek Mansour: that you just turn on all of a sudden.
[00:36:11] Tarek Mansour: It's like, oh, now we're ready to grow.
[00:36:12] Tarek Mansour: It is a muscle.
[00:36:13] Tarek Mansour: It's something you have to embed in your company.
[00:36:15] Tarek Mansour: And so I changed my mind on this, which is like,
[00:36:17] Tarek Mansour: it's not like, maybe it's the YC thing
[00:36:20] Tarek Mansour: which is build a great product and people will come.
[00:36:22] Tarek Mansour: I think build a great product
[00:36:25] Tarek Mansour: but build a great marketing engine
[00:36:26] Tarek Mansour: and scramble to do both at the same time
[00:36:28] Tarek Mansour: is not my best answer to this.
[00:36:30] Tarek Mansour: Do you think we've moved too far in that direction?
[00:36:33] Harry Stebbings: When you look at the, yeah, in the distribution
[00:36:35] Harry Stebbings: is everything, the rage bait.
[00:36:38] Harry Stebbings: The everyone has videos and everyone has a podcast
[00:36:42] Harry Stebbings: and the clueless, I'm going to take pictures
[00:36:44] Harry Stebbings: doing obscene things.
[00:36:46] Harry Stebbings: And the issue, do you think we've moved too far?
[00:36:48] Harry Stebbings: Here's the way I would say, put it, right?
[00:36:50] Tarek Mansour: You take that statement, take streams,
[00:36:52] Tarek Mansour: like maybe you should do marketing
[00:36:52] Tarek Mansour: and not really focus on product.
[00:36:53] Tarek Mansour: Well, that is definitely a recipe for failure, right?
[00:36:56] Tarek Mansour: Like in the order of things, like, you know,
[00:36:59] Tarek Mansour: build a great product, but make sure to think
[00:37:01] Tarek Mansour: about your marketing motion early enough.
[00:37:03] Tarek Mansour: Don't think of it like years late,
[00:37:04] Tarek Mansour: which is what we did, which was a thing of mistake.
[00:37:07] Tarek Mansour: The second is, you know, build a great product
[00:37:08] Tarek Mansour: and then think about your marketing.
[00:37:09] Tarek Mansour: The third is build a great marketing machine
[00:37:11] Tarek Mansour: and then think about your product.
[00:37:12] Tarek Mansour: It's my view.
[00:37:13] Tarek Mansour: Because no matter the number of eyeballs
[00:37:14] Tarek Mansour: and the number you have to build a great product, right?
[00:37:16] Tarek Mansour: Like, you know, there's a lot of people
[00:37:18] Tarek Mansour: that have had massive eyeballs.
[00:37:19] Tarek Mansour: You see influencers and you see celebrities
[00:37:22] Tarek Mansour: with mass eyeballs, you know, they, you know,
[00:37:24] Tarek Mansour: their tweets get tens of thousands,
[00:37:26] Tarek Mansour: if not hundreds of thousands of likes sometimes,
[00:37:28] Tarek Mansour: and they launch a product that doesn't really work, right?
[00:37:31] Tarek Mansour: That's the age-old story of, you know,
[00:37:33] Tarek Mansour: and so I'm not a believer of this whole, like,
[00:37:35] Tarek Mansour: distribution first and that's all that matters.
[00:37:38] Tarek Mansour: And no, I think you have to do,
[00:37:40] Tarek Mansour: you have to have a great product
[00:37:41] Tarek Mansour: that's a precondition to success,
[00:37:42] Tarek Mansour: but you have to also build in today's age
[00:37:45] Tarek Mansour: because technology has become easier, right?
[00:37:47] Tarek Mansour: It's not the building tech is not the way it was
[00:37:50] Tarek Mansour: 10 years, 15 years ago.
[00:37:51] Tarek Mansour: You have to also build a good brand
[00:37:53] Tarek Mansour: and build a marketing machine.
[00:37:54] Tarek Mansour: Chris, your honor and al, though,
[00:37:55] Harry Stebbings: announced last night he was investing in publicity.
[00:37:58] Harry Stebbings: Clearly, fantastic judgment as a fellow
[00:38:01] Harry Stebbings: publicity investor.
[00:38:03] Harry Stebbings: My question to you would be,
[00:38:05] Harry Stebbings: what celebrity would you most like to have in Calhsi?
[00:38:08] Harry Stebbings: That's a very good question for Luana
[00:38:10] Tarek Mansour: because her is a stellar swift.
[00:38:12] Tarek Mansour: And, you know, it's funny because a lot of the coverage
[00:38:14] Tarek Mansour: this week was like tying her to Taylor Swift.
[00:38:15] Tarek Mansour: Now she's richer than Taylor Swift apparently.
[00:38:18] Tarek Mansour: She's richer than Taylor Swift.
[00:38:20] Tarek Mansour: She's just younger, she's just younger.
[00:38:21] Tarek Mansour: I mean, look, my almighty goat is messy, you know,
[00:38:26] Tarek Mansour: and we have talked to,
[00:38:29] Tarek Mansour: I think we are talking to his team right now,
[00:38:30] Tarek Mansour: so we'll figure something out,
[00:38:32] Tarek Mansour: but I think he's the greatest athlete of all time,
[00:38:35] Tarek Mansour: of all time.
[00:38:35] Tarek Mansour: And I think he really embodied, like,
[00:38:38] Tarek Mansour: he's obviously great on the pitch
[00:38:39] Tarek Mansour: and everything is done,
[00:38:40] Tarek Mansour: but like he loves soccer more than anything on this planet
[00:38:45] Tarek Mansour: and you can feel it.
[00:38:46] Tarek Mansour: And you can feel it so heavily
[00:38:48] Tarek Mansour: and everything on his life, right?
[00:38:50] Tarek Mansour: Like he's made it, he's become rich,
[00:38:52] Tarek Mansour: he's become famous, he's,
[00:38:54] Tarek Mansour: and all he cares about is getting on that pitch and winning.
[00:38:57] Tarek Mansour: And you could feel that hunger.
[00:38:59] Tarek Mansour: Like, you know, and the man never really spent
[00:39:02] Tarek Mansour: up seeing Lee, he stayed with the same person,
[00:39:06] Tarek Mansour: you know, was now his wife since he was like,
[00:39:07] Tarek Mansour: I think 14, he has his family
[00:39:10] Tarek Mansour: and that's his kind of like, you know,
[00:39:11] Tarek Mansour: source of joy outside of work,
[00:39:13] Tarek Mansour: but he is so deeply committing to getting that ball
[00:39:16] Tarek Mansour: and scoring and I love that.
[00:39:18] Tarek Mansour: I love that so much because it was just never about anything
[00:39:21] Tarek Mansour: other than the soccer for him and you could feel that.
[00:39:22] Tarek Mansour: You mentioned the humility there,
[00:39:25] Harry Stebbings: they're not getting distracted,
[00:39:26] Harry Stebbings: the one partner focus.
[00:39:28] Harry Stebbings: I'm a bit worried, dude.
[00:39:30] Harry Stebbings: The use of founders today is so much younger
[00:39:34] Harry Stebbings: than it was even before.
[00:39:35] Harry Stebbings: You know, I'm meeting 17 year olds
[00:39:37] Harry Stebbings: with town sheets for $5 million every week.
[00:39:40] And that talented, absolutely.
[00:39:42] Harry Stebbings: And that talent is here.
[00:39:43] Harry Stebbings: But dude, when I was 17,
[00:39:45] Harry Stebbings: my emotional maturity was here.
[00:39:46] Harry Stebbings: And I think most of us was here.
[00:39:48] Harry Stebbings: Do you worry that we are overestimating
[00:39:51] Harry Stebbings: the emotional maturity of a generation
[00:39:53] Harry Stebbings: of very, very young founders?
[00:39:55] Harry Stebbings: Look, I will say that each generation
[00:39:57] Tarek Mansour: is more mature than the prior one.
[00:39:58] Tarek Mansour: So I think that you can definitely feel,
[00:40:00] Tarek Mansour: like I feel like so often times I talk to, you know,
[00:40:03] Tarek Mansour: 17, 18 year olds now and like,
[00:40:05] Tarek Mansour: they're more mature than I was when I was 17, 18.
[00:40:07] Tarek Mansour: As you go through battles and as you go through
[00:40:09] Tarek Mansour: the ups and downs, like, it just humbles you, right?
[00:40:12] Tarek Mansour: Like you have to go through some of that.
[00:40:14] Tarek Mansour: I agree with you that like maybe kind of people
[00:40:16] Tarek Mansour: that are coming at it, like younger people
[00:40:18] Tarek Mansour: that are coming at it clean and the first thing they get,
[00:40:20] Tarek Mansour: like first time they have an idea,
[00:40:22] Tarek Mansour: they get $5 million term sheet,
[00:40:23] Tarek Mansour: they get like maybe a wrong set of expectations
[00:40:26] Tarek Mansour: about what it takes, what are they about to get into?
[00:40:28] Tarek Mansour: And how good they truly are.
[00:40:29] Tarek Mansour: And like, I think when I have been lucky,
[00:40:32] Tarek Mansour: like we really have a massive,
[00:40:34] Tarek Mansour: we've always looked at ourselves as the underdogs
[00:40:37] Tarek Mansour: and had like always a massive ship on our shoulders.
[00:40:39] Tarek Mansour: Like we don't, our internal view of ourselves is not
[00:40:42] Tarek Mansour: like what is almighty beings or where we're always like,
[00:40:44] Tarek Mansour: what are we doing wrong?
[00:40:45] Tarek Mansour: Who's better than us?
[00:40:46] Tarek Mansour: Like we think a lot more that way.
[00:40:48] Tarek Mansour: And in some ways, it's a bit more tiring today,
[00:40:50] Tarek Mansour: but it's made us lucky because we have humbled
[00:40:53] Tarek Mansour: each other over the years.
[00:40:54] Tarek Mansour: We just stay very grounded on like, you know,
[00:40:58] Tarek Mansour: what we're lacking at every stage of growth.
[00:41:00] Tarek Mansour: And like there's a lot of things we're lacking.
[00:41:01] Tarek Mansour: There's so many great people out there, like truly, right?
[00:41:04] Tarek Mansour: Like if you compare yourself to some of the greats,
[00:41:06] Tarek Mansour: like they're all operating on such a different level
[00:41:09] Tarek Mansour: and like there's so much for us to learn.
[00:41:11] Dude, if it's okay with you, I want to do a quick far round.
[00:41:13] Harry Stebbings: So I'd pat pee with questions
[00:41:15] Harry Stebbings: and you give me your immediate thoughts.
[00:41:17] Harry Stebbings: Does that sound okay?
[00:41:18] Yeah, so that's great.
[00:41:20] Dude, what's the prediction market that should exist
[00:41:24] Harry Stebbings: but you're too scared to list?
[00:41:26] That's a great question.
[00:41:28] Tarek Mansour: I think it's markets around like the evolution
[00:41:31] Tarek Mansour: of geopolitical like conflicts.
[00:41:34] And they can have a lot of utility,
[00:41:36] Tarek Mansour: like that information to be very, very useful.
[00:41:38] Tarek Mansour: But I think they have downsides.
[00:41:40] Tarek Mansour: And we always avoid markets that like,
[00:41:42] Tarek Mansour: we try to make our market always orthogonal.
[00:41:45] Tarek Mansour: You can never get paid or not paid based
[00:41:46] Tarek Mansour: on something bad happening.
[00:41:48] It's really hard, isn't it?
[00:41:49] Harry Stebbings: Because how do you balance news and information
[00:41:52] Harry Stebbings: and the benefits that come from transparency
[00:41:54] Harry Stebbings: with the acknowledgement that with that is financialization?
[00:41:59] Is it dilemma for any technology?
[00:42:00] Tarek Mansour: You see this in AI?
[00:42:01] Tarek Mansour: I mean, that's technology, right?
[00:42:02] Tarek Mansour: Technology comes with a lot of positives
[00:42:04] Tarek Mansour: that there's risks and you have to balance between the two.
[00:42:06] Which founder brand in tech?
[00:42:09] Harry Stebbings: Do you think has most brilliantly crafted?
[00:42:13] Harry Stebbings: For example, I think the Colossans brand
[00:42:15] Harry Stebbings: has been expertly crafted,
[00:42:18] Harry Stebbings: phenomenally maintained, it's fantastic brand
[00:42:21] Harry Stebbings: that they should be very proud of, I'm saying nicely.
[00:42:23] Harry Stebbings: But that would be my brand that I aspire to.
[00:42:26] Harry Stebbings: It's a Chanel brand of knowledge and premium.
[00:42:30] I think Eric and Cream have done a very good job
[00:42:32] Tarek Mansour: building a story and a brand around the founders,
[00:42:36] Tarek Mansour: the team, the company I've come to be,
[00:42:39] Tarek Mansour: and the quality of their execution.
[00:42:42] Tarek Mansour: So, you know, learning a lot from those two and others.
[00:42:45] What's the biggest misconception
[00:42:47] Harry Stebbings: people have about CalSheets today?
[00:42:49] Harry Stebbings: People think of CalSheets.
[00:42:51] Tarek Mansour: Yeah, I mean, one of the miscumcidences
[00:42:52] Tarek Mansour: people sometimes think that CalSheets gambling, it's not.
[00:42:55] Tarek Mansour: It's information and news.
[00:42:57] Harry Stebbings: Well, I think when I think about,
[00:42:59] Tarek Mansour: it's a very, very different model.
[00:43:00] Tarek Mansour: In the reason why this, you know,
[00:43:02] Tarek Mansour: it's financial market for two reasons.
[00:43:04] Tarek Mansour: One, it has economic value.
[00:43:05] Tarek Mansour: But the second one, the really core one is,
[00:43:08] in gambling, there's a house.
[00:43:10] Tarek Mansour: You walk into Casino and the revenue of the house
[00:43:13] Tarek Mansour: is equal to its customer's losses.
[00:43:15] Tarek Mansour: That's how they make money.
[00:43:16] Tarek Mansour: They're betting against the house.
[00:43:18] In our model, it's an open, transparent financial market
[00:43:20] Tarek Mansour: that is neutral, you know,
[00:43:22] Tarek Mansour: Harry is trading against somebody else.
[00:43:24] Tarek Mansour: And whether you lose or make money,
[00:43:26] Tarek Mansour: we are not incentivized for either way.
[00:43:28] Tarek Mansour: We make as much money either way.
[00:43:30] Tarek Mansour: We take a transaction fee on top,
[00:43:31] Tarek Mansour: whether you're the same one, whether you win or lose.
[00:43:34] Tarek Mansour: And that's why we, like the dynamic is much more akin
[00:43:37] Tarek Mansour: to the New York Stock Exchange
[00:43:39] Tarek Mansour: of traditional financial markets,
[00:43:41] Tarek Mansour: then like, you know, traditional like, you know,
[00:43:45] Tarek Mansour: Casino or sportsbook.
[00:43:46] Tarek Mansour: One piece of advice on hiring
[00:43:49] Harry Stebbings: that is most controversial, unconventional.
[00:43:53] Harry Stebbings: You know, the vast majority of people
[00:43:55] Tarek Mansour: are not in the top 10%.
[00:43:57] Tarek Mansour: So, you know, it sounds like an obvious statement,
[00:44:00] Tarek Mansour: but like, most people that come to your door
[00:44:02] Tarek Mansour: should probably not be at your company, right?
[00:44:05] It's not, you know, and I think that like,
[00:44:08] I think people always forget that, like, you know,
[00:44:09] Tarek Mansour: most teams are not great teams.
[00:44:11] Tarek Mansour: They can be, right?
[00:44:12] Tarek Mansour: Like, that everybody can be in the top 10%.
[00:44:14] Tarek Mansour: And so, and maybe the way to frame this
[00:44:17] Tarek Mansour: as a contrain or controversial take
[00:44:19] Tarek Mansour: is like, most people are kind of mediocre.
[00:44:22] Tarek Mansour: And not in a bad way, necessarily,
[00:44:23] Tarek Mansour: but just mediocre for the job that you're trying to hire them for.
[00:44:26] Tarek Mansour: And so it's really, really hard to find
[00:44:28] Tarek Mansour: the top five 10%ers.
[00:44:30] Tarek Mansour: I do not think you can only have A players
[00:44:33] Harry Stebbings: if you have a company over 250 people.
[00:44:36] Harry Stebbings: By definition, A players are extremely rare
[00:44:38] Harry Stebbings: if you want to keep that high bar.
[00:44:40] Harry Stebbings: Post 250, I don't think you can.
[00:44:43] Harry Stebbings: Do you agree?
[00:44:44] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:44:45] Tarek Mansour: We're not at 250 yet, so we'll see.
[00:44:48] What are you at today?
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_00: A hundred and change, 110.
[00:44:52] Tarek Mansour: What?
[00:44:53] What's the worst part about your culture?
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_00: That's a weird question.
[00:44:57] Tarek Mansour: We're a little bit chaotic,
[00:45:00] Tarek Mansour: but it's virtue of like very flat, low on process,
[00:45:05] Tarek Mansour: very low on politics,
[00:45:07] Tarek Mansour: and just really focus on product, customer and shipping.
[00:45:10] Tarek Mansour: That's like every decision is product, customer shipping.
[00:45:12] Tarek Mansour: Don't think about anything else.
[00:45:13] Tarek Mansour: And when that happens, we are trading off the bane of not,
[00:45:16] Tarek Mansour: like you're choosing, in my view,
[00:45:20] Tarek Mansour: between two different pains, either product velocity,
[00:45:24] Tarek Mansour: which comes, or, so you either
[00:45:28] Tarek Mansour: cave on product velocity,
[00:45:29] Tarek Mansour: or you cave on my chaos and organization in a company.
[00:45:33] Tarek Mansour: I don't think you can get both.
[00:45:34] Tarek Mansour: I know you love walking meetings.
[00:45:36] Harry Stebbings: What's the most memorable walking meeting?
[00:45:38] Harry Stebbings: And why?
[00:45:39] Harry Stebbings: I do love walking meetings.
[00:45:40] Tarek Mansour: How do you know that?
[00:45:42] Dude, I stalk the shit out of it.
[00:45:45] Yeah, you know why the show's done well,
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_00: and I didn't mean this agony,
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_00: it's just because most people don't prep.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_00: They don't really put the time in to get to know you.
[00:45:52] Harry Stebbings: It's amazing.
[00:45:54] Harry Stebbings: You know I spoke to 23 people before this.
[00:45:56] Harry Stebbings: That's amazing.
[00:45:59] Tarek Mansour: That's amazing.
[00:45:59] Tarek Mansour: Let me think, I think I've had so many walking meetings
[00:46:02] Tarek Mansour: over the years, but I spent a lot of time
[00:46:04] Tarek Mansour: just walking with Victor, Lasart,
[00:46:09] Tarek Mansour: and just sort of thinking about a bunch of different things.
[00:46:11] Tarek Mansour: The thing that I mean to is incredibly smart.
[00:46:12] Tarek Mansour: It's a very, very smart guy.
[00:46:14] Tarek Mansour: And we never just have an agenda.
[00:46:17] Tarek Mansour: We just sort of talk about different constructs
[00:46:19] Tarek Mansour: and try to kind of build mental models of the world
[00:46:22] Tarek Mansour: and what's happening.
[00:46:24] Tarek Mansour: He's just kind of always helped me think bigger.
[00:46:27] Tarek Mansour: And he pushes back on my thinking.
[00:46:29] Tarek Mansour: We have a lot of walking meetings.
[00:46:32] I love him.
[00:46:32] I think he was brilliant on the show.
[00:46:35] Harry Stebbings: Final one for you.
[00:46:36] Harry Stebbings: Your dad was an entrepreneur.
