[00:00:00] Every time that private market valuations came into contact with public market valuations,
[00:00:05] Roelof Botha: private market valuations were found wanting.
[00:00:07] Roelof Botha: And money is a great fruit serum.
[00:00:10] Roelof Botha: Don't tell me what you think. Tell me what you do.
[00:00:12] Roelof Botha: It is possible to lose money on a great company.
[00:00:15] Roelof Botha: It is the spiciest show we've ever done.
[00:00:18] Jason Calacanis: Jason Lampkin, Roryo Driscoll, the biggest news
[00:00:22] Jason Calacanis: intact air wallets at 8 billion or ramp at 32.
[00:00:26] Jason Calacanis: Which would you rather own?
[00:00:28] Jason bail me out here.
[00:00:30] Roelof Botha: I think it's VC condescending to tell the CEO how they're going to work it out.
[00:00:34] Keith Rabois: It is beyond condescending. The great CEOs will figure it out.
[00:00:37] Keith Rabois: I'm going to push back hard on that.
[00:00:39] Roelof Botha: Hard on that.
[00:00:40] Keith Rabois: People are going to see you as condescending, Roryo.
[00:00:42] Keith Rabois: I wouldn't push back.
[00:00:43] Keith Rabois: I disagree.
[00:00:44] Roelof Botha: And they're welcome.
[00:00:45] Roelof Botha: They like you a lot now.
[00:00:46] Keith Rabois: Don't make them think of you as condescending.
[00:00:47] Keith Rabois: It doesn't help with the environment.
[00:00:48] Keith Rabois: No, I'm doing that straight away.
[00:00:49] Keith Rabois: Don't push back.
[00:00:49] Keith Rabois: Take them all again and delete the session.
[00:00:51] Keith Rabois: No, I won't.
[00:00:52] Keith Rabois: There's not your place to tell them how to do it.
[00:00:54] Keith Rabois: It's a great honor Jason.
[00:00:57] Ready to go.
[00:01:09] Guys, it is so good to be back.
[00:01:11] Jason Calacanis: Jason, I am loving this 20 VC swag that we've got going on here.
[00:01:15] Jason Calacanis: It looks fantastic.
[00:01:17] Jason Calacanis: Roryo, we might get you some others out there.
[00:01:19] Jason Calacanis: Swag works.
[00:01:21] Swag works.
[00:01:22] Keith Rabois: It works.
[00:01:23] Keith Rabois: It's a good investment.
[00:01:24] Keith Rabois: It's a good investment.
[00:01:24] Keith Rabois: It is quality swag works.
[00:01:26] Roelof Botha: It's got to be good enough that you want to wear it.
[00:01:28] Roelof Botha: That's the test.
[00:01:29] Roelof Botha: All play with it in the case of a paddle bat.
[00:01:32] Jason Calacanis: Hey, Roryo, we see yours behind you.
[00:01:35] Jason Calacanis: Oh, yeah.
[00:01:36] Jason Calacanis: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:37] Jason Calacanis: The others are paddle battles.
[00:01:38] Jason Calacanis: OK, OK, we're going to start.
[00:01:40] Jason Calacanis: We're going to start.
[00:01:40] Jason Calacanis: We're starting with number one.
[00:01:42] Jason Calacanis: SpaceX pursuing $800 billion valuation
[00:01:45] Jason Calacanis: through secondary sale.
[00:01:47] Jason Calacanis: This is obviously not the first we've seen in recent times
[00:01:50] Jason Calacanis: with SpaceX doing large secondaries.
[00:01:52] Jason Calacanis: It's first time it's obviously been $800 billion.
[00:01:55] Jason Calacanis: How do we think about this?
[00:01:56] Jason Calacanis: News love to hand over to you guys.
[00:01:58] Roelof Botha: It's an amazing cut.
[00:01:59] Roelof Botha: Let's start with that.
[00:02:00] Roelof Botha: It's just an amazing company.
[00:02:01] Roelof Botha: It's actually amazing two companies.
[00:02:02] Roelof Botha: It's an amazing rocket company
[00:02:04] Roelof Botha: and then amazing communications and stalling company.
[00:02:07] Roelof Botha: It's doing $15 billion,
[00:02:10] Roelof Botha: growing plus or minus 30%.
[00:02:14] Roelof Botha: This year, that's a pretty hefty valuation.
[00:02:16] Roelof Botha: I mean, that's, you know,
[00:02:18] Roelof Botha: north of 40 times one rate for a company.
[00:02:22] Roelof Botha: This year going 30.
[00:02:23] Roelof Botha: You could argue maybe there's some extra stalling
[00:02:25] Roelof Botha: growth buried in there.
[00:02:26] Roelof Botha: But I'd remember thinking,
[00:02:29] Roelof Botha: hmm, I'm not sure I'd be a buyer at that price.
[00:02:33] You know, and not even if I don't
[00:02:36] Roelof Botha: so might be looking to my seller.
[00:02:37] Roelof Botha: So yeah, I think there's a huge amount of
[00:02:40] Roelof Botha: Elon, magic overlay and, you know,
[00:02:42] Roelof Botha: so far that magic has worked,
[00:02:44] Roelof Botha: but it's definitely a lot of
[00:02:47] Roelof Botha: non-obvious math baked into the price.
[00:02:49] Roelof Botha: It may segue into the IPOs of 26 and 27.
[00:02:52] Keith Rabois: I think it's going to, our jaws are going to drop
[00:02:55] Keith Rabois: with the IPOs, right?
[00:02:56] Keith Rabois: And one question, I guess it's a minor question,
[00:03:00] Keith Rabois: is there's so many brands that will IPO.
[00:03:02] Keith Rabois: We had 2025, we had no brands IPO.
[00:03:04] Keith Rabois: I mean, we had some good IPOs.
[00:03:06] Keith Rabois: We had some IPOs that traded weak like Figma.
[00:03:09] Keith Rabois: But it's not like folks on the street knew
[00:03:11] Keith Rabois: who Figma or CoreWeave was, right?
[00:03:13] Keith Rabois: Who knows what retail will do to SpaceX and Stripe
[00:03:16] Keith Rabois: and street names like Databricks,
[00:03:18] Keith Rabois: whichever one talks about?
[00:03:19] Keith Rabois: A little facetious there.
[00:03:21] Keith Rabois: But what is the, what do you,
[00:03:23] Keith Rabois: I don't know what the retail premium is for a hot name,
[00:03:25] Keith Rabois: but it could be, it's boosted Tesla over the years for sure.
[00:03:29] Keith Rabois: But I'll push back Jason to say secondary sale,
[00:03:32] Jason Calacanis: and I'll actually just show the lack of need
[00:03:33] Jason Calacanis: for these names to IPO, the fact that you're doing it
[00:03:36] Jason Calacanis: at $800 billion and furthering the discussion
[00:03:38] Jason Calacanis: that we have with Tom Tungers of the lack of need
[00:03:40] Jason Calacanis: for these companies too.
[00:03:42] Jason Calacanis: I actually think it's not going to be a good 26
[00:03:44] Jason Calacanis: because of secondary sales light, these are these prices.
[00:03:48] Keith Rabois: But I mean, the fanthropic really IPOs
[00:03:50] Keith Rabois: at the end of next year, it will just,
[00:03:52] Keith Rabois: we haven't had an IPO like that almost ever.
[00:03:55] Keith Rabois: It will just change the core.
[00:03:57] Keith Rabois: And the amount of liquidity, the scale,
[00:03:59] Keith Rabois: I mean, who knows, if it's worth $800 billion,
[00:04:03] Keith Rabois: or whatever it trades at, these are just not like the VC deals
[00:04:06] Keith Rabois: we just used to do.
[00:04:09] Even just two of them, even, you're right,
[00:04:11] Keith Rabois: maybe talk to the start, maybe these guys never IPO.
[00:04:14] Keith Rabois: But eventually they will want the capital, I think.
[00:04:20] Keith Rabois: And I don't think Databricks andthropic are hiding from an IPO.
[00:04:26] Keith Rabois: I don't think they're doing a stripe.
[00:04:27] Keith Rabois: I think they've been very clear.
[00:04:28] Keith Rabois: They're on a path to an IPO.
[00:04:29] Keith Rabois: We just don't know when Databricks and Anthropic will IPO.
[00:04:32] Keith Rabois: Some of these are destined to go public
[00:04:34] Roelof Botha: in a way that maybe striped shoes is not too.
[00:04:37] Roelof Botha: I think the question will be if you get locked
[00:04:39] Roelof Botha: into a high price on secondary,
[00:04:41] Roelof Botha: even if it doesn't have an IPO block,
[00:04:43] Roelof Botha: even if it's entirely secondary shares,
[00:04:45] Roelof Botha: will you get into this weird dynamic
[00:04:47] Roelof Botha: where it doesn't feel like a win
[00:04:49] Roelof Botha: if the public markets don't think you're worth $800 million
[00:04:52] Roelof Botha: billion, they only think only, did I really say that?
[00:04:55] Roelof Botha: Only think you're worth $400 billion.
[00:04:57] Roelof Botha: And I think that's one of the weird things about
[00:05:01] Roelof Botha: these private grounds providing a high water mark.
[00:05:05] Roelof Botha: Does it make IPO's, for lack of a better word,
[00:05:08] Roelof Botha: emotionally unattractive,
[00:05:10] Roelof Botha: because it's going to not feel like the win you wanted it to be?
[00:05:13] Roelof Botha: I mean, it's worth pointing out.
[00:05:13] Roelof Botha: Does anyone care anymore,
[00:05:15] Keith Rabois: or if it's a down, literally, does anyone care anymore?
[00:05:19] Keith Rabois: I think we've given up caring about a down IPO.
[00:05:21] Keith Rabois: Let's talk about that.
[00:05:22] Roelof Botha: And first of all, you're right.
[00:05:23] Roelof Botha: I mean, I think almost every IPO this year, 2025,
[00:05:28] Roelof Botha: was a down round on the prior private round.
[00:05:31] Roelof Botha: Right?
[00:05:32] Roelof Botha: So, as I said, as people,
[00:05:34] Roelof Botha: every time that private market valuations came into contact
[00:05:38] Roelof Botha: with public market valuations,
[00:05:40] Roelof Botha: private market valuations were found wanting.
[00:05:42] Roelof Botha: So, from a due care perspective,
[00:05:48] Roelof Botha: you survive it, you move on.
[00:05:50] Roelof Botha: It's not like it's not like the end of the world.
[00:05:52] Roelof Botha: The person who obviously does care
[00:05:53] Roelof Botha: is the person who bought in the private markets
[00:05:55] Roelof Botha: at a price that's not now available in the public market.
[00:05:58] Roelof Botha: So, this is back to the...
[00:05:59] Roelof Botha: I don't think care, though.
[00:06:01] Know what I mean is, what I mean is,
[00:06:02] Keith Rabois: it's seriously going into 26.
[00:06:04] Keith Rabois: Of course they care, right?
[00:06:05] Keith Rabois: Especially without a ratchet.
[00:06:07] Keith Rabois: My sense is it's baked into the business model, right?
[00:06:09] Keith Rabois: For Harry, on the off chance,
[00:06:11] Keith Rabois: Errolix is worth less than he paid, okay?
[00:06:14] Keith Rabois: I don't think Harry is going to quit the business, right?
[00:06:16] Keith Rabois: I don't think he has a 3X ratchet on his investment.
[00:06:20] Keith Rabois: I'm just saying, I think it's much like,
[00:06:22] Keith Rabois: that coming out of a hot accelerator,
[00:06:24] Keith Rabois: raising it 60 posts with trivial revenue,
[00:06:26] Keith Rabois: I think even see investors have internalized this, right?
[00:06:28] Keith Rabois: But you are right, it is in the business model.
[00:06:30] Roelof Botha: In the sense, if you think about late stage investing,
[00:06:32] Roelof Botha: and obviously, I think we can stipulate
[00:06:34] Roelof Botha: that 800 billion pre is definitely late stage
[00:06:37] Roelof Botha: by any man's definition.
[00:06:39] Roelof Botha: You're not running any other kind of meaningful risk,
[00:06:42] Roelof Botha: except valuation risk.
[00:06:43] Roelof Botha: So you can cry like a baby
[00:06:45] Roelof Botha: when valuation risk bites you in the ass.
[00:06:47] Roelof Botha: So at one level, not only is it baked
[00:06:49] Roelof Botha: in the business model,
[00:06:50] Roelof Botha: it arguably is the business model.
[00:06:51] Roelof Botha: Just like investing in stocks,
[00:06:53] Roelof Botha: the business model is some go up and some go down, right?
[00:06:56] Roelof Botha: So yeah, I agree, it's not going to be,
[00:06:57] Roelof Botha: oh my god, we'll never do that again.
[00:06:59] Roelof Botha: But what it will lead to is perhaps,
[00:07:01] Roelof Botha: I mean, that's the point in time
[00:07:02] Roelof Botha: at which either those less capital
[00:07:05] Roelof Botha: or more circumspection in the private markets.
[00:07:07] Roelof Botha: I mean, if you continually price something at a high price
[00:07:11] Roelof Botha: and you're continually wrong
[00:07:12] Roelof Botha: and it goes public at a lower price,
[00:07:14] Roelof Botha: at some point, some adult in the room will say,
[00:07:16] Roelof Botha: maybe we should stop doing that
[00:07:18] Roelof Botha: and wait and buy them when they're cheaper, right?
[00:07:20] Roelof Botha: And you're right, it's not the other way.
[00:07:21] Roelof Botha: But that's the, as I look at these,
[00:07:24] Roelof Botha: as I look at 800 billion pre for a $15 billion
[00:07:27] Roelof Botha: revenue business, as I said,
[00:07:29] Roelof Botha: in the absence of the Elon premium,
[00:07:31] Roelof Botha: I think that price would look pretty second
[00:07:33] Roelof Botha: the public markets.
[00:07:34] Roelof Botha: Now, because of the Elon premium,
[00:07:36] Roelof Botha: I freely admit it's just not noble to me in a short term.
[00:07:39] Roelof Botha: I think in the long term, everything,
[00:07:41] Roelof Botha: as we said, is a weighing machine
[00:07:43] Roelof Botha: and the cash flows will dominate.
[00:07:45] Roelof Botha: So they're going to have to do a lot of going to get to that price.
[00:07:48] Roelof Botha: I think the meta point for me,
[00:07:50] Keith Rabois: the change to venture and founders
[00:07:53] Keith Rabois: is even today on X, Harry's probably given this advice
[00:07:56] Keith Rabois: as well, he gives a lot of advice on X.
[00:07:58] Keith Rabois: You'll have an advice, don't raise around it to high price,
[00:08:00] Keith Rabois: you'll come to a credit, do a fair price,
[00:08:02] Keith Rabois: don't take the highest price, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:05] Keith Rabois: I think that advice is as sound as it ever was,
[00:08:08] Keith Rabois: but I think it has an audience of n equals zero.
[00:08:11] Keith Rabois: I don't think anyone cares.
[00:08:13] Keith Rabois: No one cares if they come out of a hot accelerator
[00:08:15] Keith Rabois: and raise at 50 to 60 on a bunch of safes with no rights
[00:08:19] Keith Rabois: and do around it 30 later, they don't care.
[00:08:21] Keith Rabois: They just don't care.
[00:08:22] Keith Rabois: They don't care if, listen, if I need the capital
[00:08:25] Keith Rabois: at 800 billion and the IPO's at 500 billion,
[00:08:29] Keith Rabois: I mean, Elon Musk has to take care of his Twitter investors
[00:08:32] Keith Rabois: in a way, right?
[00:08:32] Keith Rabois: But I don't think most folks,
[00:08:34] Keith Rabois: really, they have the angst we used to have.
[00:08:36] Keith Rabois: I think the angst is gone around mispriced rounds
[00:08:40] Keith Rabois: over priced rounds and good or bad,
[00:08:42] Keith Rabois: I think that advice, there's no audience.
[00:08:44] Keith Rabois: I want to expand this discussion to the broader IPO market
[00:08:49] Jason Calacanis: because we've seen not a huge amount of liquidity come back.
[00:08:52] Jason Calacanis: It not be as exciting or as exuberant as we thought
[00:08:55] Jason Calacanis: it would be in 2025.
[00:08:57] Jason Calacanis: Two questions as directors can be,
[00:08:59] Jason Calacanis: will 2026 be the year of the IPO's?
[00:09:02] Jason Calacanis: And if so, what will be the catalyst to drive that excitement?
[00:09:07] Roelof Botha: When you kind of sent out the note, you said,
[00:09:09] Roelof Botha: what happens if SpaceX and tropic and Databricks go public?
[00:09:13] Roelof Botha: Right?
[00:09:13] Roelof Botha: And just doing the math here, I did it.
[00:09:15] Roelof Botha: It's like 800 billion for SpaceX,
[00:09:17] Roelof Botha: 400 billion for Antropic and 200 billion for Databricks.
[00:09:21] Roelof Botha: That's 1.4 trillion of market cap.
[00:09:26] Roelof Botha: Let's say VC's on an average,
[00:09:27] Roelof Botha: little under half of that plus or minus,
[00:09:30] Roelof Botha: that's 700 billion of money returned to VC.
[00:09:33] Roelof Botha: That would obviously, to state the banal,
[00:09:36] Roelof Botha: be a pretty darn good year.
[00:09:39] Roelof Botha: Now, sobering to realize, it's only about 20% of the total private FMV.
[00:09:45] Roelof Botha: Because the total private FMV adventure is something like 2.8 to 1.9 trillion.
[00:09:49] Roelof Botha: So it's a big chunk in the deficit,
[00:09:53] Roelof Botha: it's not all the deficit, but it would be a great year.
[00:09:57] Roelof Botha: And that's plausible.
[00:09:58] Roelof Botha: The weird thing about power law,
[00:10:00] Roelof Botha: economic math, is it only takes one or two of the top of the power law
[00:10:05] Roelof Botha: to go public, to dwarf 10 billion dollar pre-IPOs.
[00:10:11] Roelof Botha: It's all lost in the noise of the banker fee
[00:10:14] Roelof Botha: if SpaceX goes public and anywhere from 400 to 600 billion dollars.
[00:10:18] Roelof Botha: One of these years will be a bumper year for IPO
[00:10:20] Roelof Botha: and the thing that will make it a bumper year is just like 2012.
[00:10:23] Roelof Botha: You don't remember, but 2012 was a quote,
[00:10:25] Roelof Botha: bumper year for IPOs.
[00:10:27] Roelof Botha: Why?
[00:10:28] Roelof Botha: Because Facebook went public, right?
[00:10:31] Roelof Botha: And the year I came up with 2018 was quote,
[00:10:34] Roelof Botha: a bumper year for IPOs, because Alabama went public.
[00:10:36] Roelof Botha: And both of them were huge and ginormous.
[00:10:38] Roelof Botha: And if you look at the little bar graphs,
[00:10:39] Roelof Botha: it's like, oh, yeah, that was the year of Alabama.
[00:10:41] Roelof Botha: What is the Facebook or Alibaba of 2006?
[00:10:44] Jason Calacanis: Is it SpaceX, anthropical data breaks?
[00:10:46] Jason Calacanis: At 200, I can remember Alibaba,
[00:10:48] Roelof Botha: but SpaceX and Antropic would be bigger than boat.
[00:10:52] Roelof Botha: I mean, I want to say Facebook was around 70 or 80 Bill.
[00:10:55] Roelof Botha: I remember Alibaba being bigger, a couple of hundred billion.
[00:10:58] Roelof Botha: But yes, any of these would be bigger.
[00:11:01] Roelof Botha: At some point in one year, two or three of these
[00:11:03] Roelof Botha: will go out at the same time,
[00:11:04] Roelof Botha: and it'll be like the mother of all years.
[00:11:07] Do we not feel pretty good actually looking at this?
[00:11:09] Jason Calacanis: When you add in an open AI on top of that
[00:11:11] Jason Calacanis: into an H127, which is kind of where people are projecting it to be,
[00:11:15] Jason Calacanis: you're looking at 18 months of pretty phenomenal funnel and liquidity.
[00:11:21] If the market's safe strong and that happens,
[00:11:23] Roelof Botha: the overall return to equity will be extremely good.
[00:11:27] Roelof Botha: I mean, just to say it out there,
[00:11:29] Roelof Botha: because I am Mr. Debbie Downer, right?
[00:11:31] Roelof Botha: Markards are at an all-time high,
[00:11:33] Roelof Botha: both in index terms, which is meaningless,
[00:11:36] Roelof Botha: because they're often at an all-time high.
[00:11:37] Roelof Botha: But just in terms of valuation on a PE,
[00:11:39] Roelof Botha: any kind of SHILL or PE basis,
[00:11:41] Roelof Botha: in a more normalized market.
[00:11:43] Roelof Botha: If all these companies went, going back to,
[00:11:46] Roelof Botha: perhaps disagreeing a little bit with something just,
[00:11:47] Roelof Botha: if all these companies went public and everyone
[00:11:49] Roelof Botha: that was significantly down on the last round,
[00:11:52] Roelof Botha: let's just say instead of being 1.4 trillion,
[00:11:55] Roelof Botha: they're just worth 7,800 billion.
[00:11:57] Roelof Botha: Still the best year ever.
[00:11:59] Roelof Botha: Still three amazing companies go going out.
[00:12:01] Roelof Botha: You could still have a weird feeling of,
[00:12:03] Roelof Botha: oh, maybe I shouldn't have bought it at 800 billion per day.
[00:12:06] Roelof Botha: Or even 400 billion per day.
[00:12:07] Roelof Botha: That's the dilemma here.
[00:12:10] Roelof Botha: I think that net, it would be good overall.
[00:12:12] Roelof Botha: I mean, the capital would come back.
[00:12:14] Roelof Botha: All the prior rounds would make money.
[00:12:16] Roelof Botha: You might just have this odd phenomenon of people going,
[00:12:19] Roelof Botha: that last price was a little,
[00:12:21] Roelof Botha: little reach here than the public,
[00:12:22] Roelof Botha: but you're still in a good shape.
[00:12:24] Jason, do you wanna lose some more money?
[00:12:26] Jason Calacanis: Remember all that?
[00:12:27] Jason Calacanis: I already thought this was gonna happen
[00:12:29] Keith Rabois: at the end of 24,
[00:12:30] Keith Rabois: or do you 50 grand plus interest?
[00:12:32] Wow.
[00:12:33] Keith Rabois: I was too optimistic.
[00:12:34] Keith Rabois: I really thought that we would have a blip in 23,
[00:12:37] Keith Rabois: and 24, all the B2B leaders would come roaring back
[00:12:40] Keith Rabois: because growth stayed high for a while, right?
[00:12:43] Keith Rabois: Through early 2023.
[00:12:44] Keith Rabois: So I thought 2024 was gonna be,
[00:12:46] Keith Rabois: I thought we were gonna have an IPO a day again,
[00:12:48] Keith Rabois: because of the unicorn backlog.
[00:12:50] Keith Rabois: Little did I know they would all stop growing.
[00:12:52] Keith Rabois: Yeah.
[00:12:53] Except the AI ones.
[00:12:55] Keith Rabois: All the, except they would all stop growing.
[00:12:57] Keith Rabois: So, I don't even want,
[00:12:58] Keith Rabois: hopefully the interest rate's like 1% like Elon's loans.
[00:13:01] Keith Rabois: We'll have to figure out, I'm good for it.
[00:13:03] Roelof Botha: I don't, if your plan involves assuming
[00:13:06] Roelof Botha: we ever got to 1% interest rates again,
[00:13:08] Roelof Botha: I'd abandon that plan,
[00:13:10] Roelof Botha: because I can't double down in the bet.
[00:13:11] Roelof Botha: Yeah.
[00:13:12] Roelof Botha: But my bet is out has to happen by the end of 2026.
[00:13:14] Keith Rabois: It is tight, right?
[00:13:15] Keith Rabois: Because it's in 2025, right?
[00:13:17] Keith Rabois: I think I'll take that bet, I'll double down on it.
[00:13:20] Keith Rabois: I think inthropic and data bricks
[00:13:21] Keith Rabois: have an incentive to IPO,
[00:13:23] Keith Rabois: as best I understand it, they have an incentive.
[00:13:25] Keith Rabois: As Rory said, times are great.
[00:13:28] Keith Rabois: And so I think it'll be the,
[00:13:30] Keith Rabois: unless the market crashes for some reason,
[00:13:32] Keith Rabois: I think they're gonna do it when the timing's perfect.
[00:13:34] Keith Rabois: I think they're both gonna IPO in the back half of 26.
[00:13:37] Keith Rabois: And if I, you know,
[00:13:39] Keith Rabois: Harry, if you double down,
[00:13:39] Keith Rabois: in a worst case, we're even, right?
[00:13:42] Keith Rabois: Best case, I get 100 grand,
[00:13:43] Keith Rabois: and you can pay for it out of fees.
[00:13:45] Keith Rabois: So it's really tax, pre-tax.
[00:13:47] Keith Rabois: I think he's right, a direct check for me.
[00:13:49] Keith Rabois: Okay.
[00:13:50] Keith Rabois: 20 VC management LLC.
[00:13:53] Roelof Botha: I do agree with you,
[00:13:54] Roelof Botha: because I think oddly, you know,
[00:13:55] Roelof Botha: onthropic has been, you know,
[00:13:57] Roelof Botha: obviously very different in terms of founding story
[00:14:00] Roelof Botha: and effective arches and angst about AI.
[00:14:03] Roelof Botha: But remarkably sober minded and sensible
[00:14:06] Roelof Botha: and kind of mainstream in terms of the financial plan.
[00:14:09] Roelof Botha: You know, all along,
[00:14:10] Roelof Botha: they've, the state of they're gonna be more efficient,
[00:14:12] Roelof Botha: burn less, they've talked about converging early.
[00:14:15] Roelof Botha: It feels like they will very sensibly go public
[00:14:18] Roelof Botha: when they can,
[00:14:20] Roelof Botha: because in this kind of capital intensive business,
[00:14:22] Roelof Botha: I think at some point,
[00:14:23] Roelof Botha: there will be a strategic advantage to going public.
[00:14:25] Roelof Botha: So, you know, just logically,
[00:14:28] Roelof Botha: it would be the right thing to do.
[00:14:29] Roelof Botha: And they've been pleasantly more logical
[00:14:31] Roelof Botha: than the other player on this space
[00:14:32] Roelof Botha: and more small-sea conservative,
[00:14:34] Roelof Botha: which is ironic, as I say, given the philosophical approach there.
[00:14:37] Roelof Botha: But in terms of finance,
[00:14:39] Roelof Botha: they've been conservative,
[00:14:40] Roelof Botha: and I think they will be
[00:14:41] Roelof Botha: and conservative sensible conventional,
[00:14:43] Roelof Botha: maybe it's a better word than conservative.
[00:14:45] Roelof Botha: The conventional thing to do
[00:14:47] Roelof Botha: when you're valued at 400 billion
[00:14:48] Roelof Botha: and you need to raise a lot of money
[00:14:49] Roelof Botha: would be to out and access the public markets at scale.
[00:14:52] Roelof Botha: So yeah.
[00:14:53] Roelof Botha: Jason, I'm keeping my game, no deal.
[00:14:55] Jason Calacanis: I think you're right.
[00:14:56] Jason Calacanis: I think 2020 sees is when they go out.
[00:14:58] Jason Calacanis: So, I agree with you there.
[00:15:01] Jason Calacanis: I do have a pocketing is 50 grand and moving on.
[00:15:04] Roelof Botha: I love it.
[00:15:05] Roelof Botha: I'm pocketing my 50, baby.
[00:15:06] Roelof Botha: But also, remember, we've been,
[00:15:08] Roelof Botha: I saw it in one of the chart guys I follow is that
[00:15:11] Roelof Botha: from April 15th,
[00:15:12] Roelof Botha: when remember we had the tariffs
[00:15:14] Roelof Botha: on the implosion then,
[00:15:15] Roelof Botha: this has been the most,
[00:15:16] Roelof Botha: the strongest bounce back from a bear market since 1982.
[00:15:20] Roelof Botha: It's been the biggest jump, right?
[00:15:21] Roelof Botha: So where everyone's head was in April
[00:15:23] Roelof Botha: versus where everyone's head is today,
[00:15:25] Roelof Botha: and you should remember,
[00:15:26] Roelof Botha: it can go the other way just as quickly.
[00:15:28] Roelof Botha: You're right.
[00:15:28] Roelof Botha: You can ever think they're filing
[00:15:29] Roelof Botha: and then something can go wrong.
[00:15:30] Roelof Botha: So you're right.
[00:15:31] Roelof Botha: When equities are on all time high,
[00:15:32] Roelof Botha: the window is open
[00:15:33] Roelof Botha: and you know you're gonna need more money,
[00:15:35] Roelof Botha: maybe you should think about,
[00:15:37] Roelof Botha: grab on the moment.
[00:15:38] Roelof Botha: But if inthropics predicting the revenue
[00:15:40] Keith Rabois: is gonna triple next year, okay?
[00:15:43] Keith Rabois: It's difficult to imagine,
[00:15:44] Keith Rabois: even in an amazing market like today,
[00:15:46] Keith Rabois: you're gonna get a much better multiple
[00:15:48] Keith Rabois: than in early 2026, right?
[00:15:50] Keith Rabois: Will it triple from 26 to 70,
[00:15:52] Keith Rabois: almost 80 billion?
[00:15:54] Keith Rabois: I mean, maybe.
[00:15:55] Keith Rabois: But I mean, just the fact that you've got a three X
[00:15:57] Keith Rabois: at that scale kind of in the bag,
[00:15:59] Keith Rabois: that's a good time to IPO.
[00:16:01] Jason Calacanis: Jason, baby,
[00:16:01] Jason Calacanis: I got a new bet for you before we do the BFD.
[00:16:04] Jason Calacanis: The new bet is,
[00:16:05] Jason Calacanis: anthropic going out,
[00:16:06] Jason Calacanis: what price does it go out at
[00:16:08] Jason Calacanis: and rory you're involved in this bet?
[00:16:10] Jason Calacanis: And chance.
[00:16:11] Jason Calacanis: Look, I haven't, but again,
[00:16:14] Roelof Botha: I think I just talked about a private one at 300, 350.
[00:16:18] Roelof Botha: You know, again, looking at public information
[00:16:20] Roelof Botha: when you look at the growth rate,
[00:16:21] Roelof Botha: when they were doing the 170 million dollar round,
[00:16:23] Roelof Botha: you can see the math working.
[00:16:24] Roelof Botha: So you could easily justify a 350 million type valuation
[00:16:28] Roelof Botha: in the public markets.
[00:16:29] Roelof Botha: So that doesn't seem crazy.
[00:16:31] Roelof Botha: I mean, it's amazing as a result.
[00:16:34] Roelof Botha: But Jason's right, one more year of three X growth.
[00:16:37] Roelof Botha: I mean, the thing that would do all this stuff,
[00:16:39] Roelof Botha: as we all said,
[00:16:40] Roelof Botha: we mock would be sustained deacceleration.
[00:16:43] Roelof Botha: But the acceleration was seeing a 10 weight,
[00:16:46] Roelof Botha: but doesn't collapse.
[00:16:47] Roelof Botha: Then that kind of numbers totally plausible.
[00:16:49] Roelof Botha: I'm going to say 500,
[00:16:51] Roelof Botha: which I think ties to the round.
[00:16:53] Keith Rabois: I'm writing this down.
[00:16:54] Jason Calacanis: Jason 500.
[00:16:55] Jason Calacanis: And I'll tell you why.
[00:16:56] Keith Rabois: I'm just listening.
[00:16:57] Keith Rabois: And I think you've got to be careful to use ARR math
[00:16:59] Keith Rabois: when it's really full-weigh growth, most likely, right?
[00:17:01] Keith Rabois: But if they do hit 25, 26 next year,
[00:17:03] Keith Rabois: if it's in the bag,
[00:17:05] Keith Rabois: I'm doing simple math.
[00:17:06] Keith Rabois: 20 times is what data bricks does, 20 times what other,
[00:17:09] Keith Rabois: I mean, it's not even that high for a public multiple,
[00:17:12] Keith Rabois: 20X, right, for the top to the top 10%.
[00:17:14] Keith Rabois: So 20X times 26 is 520.
[00:17:17] Keith Rabois: I'm going to guess 500 billion IPO, right?
[00:17:20] Keith Rabois: And it ties to a mediocre deal in this round, right?
[00:17:23] Keith Rabois: But still a good IRR, right?
[00:17:24] Keith Rabois: If they raise it 300 to 350, the IPO at 500,
[00:17:27] Keith Rabois: that's still a pretty good IRR.
[00:17:28] Keith Rabois: It is funny the way,
[00:17:30] Roelof Botha: I mean, if you think about the two conversations
[00:17:32] Roelof Botha: we've had in Disappoint,
[00:17:33] Roelof Botha: because all my homework done in SpaceX,
[00:17:35] Roelof Botha: and we've blew past it.
[00:17:36] Roelof Botha: But if you think about one company,
[00:17:39] Roelof Botha: we're basically saying one company's going to get roughly 20X,
[00:17:43] Roelof Botha: growing 20, 25X, growing at 300% next year,
[00:17:47] Roelof Botha: up from 10, going 3X next year,
[00:17:51] Roelof Botha: down from 10X this year, 10X and 3X.
[00:17:54] Roelof Botha: And the other one's going to get 40X revenues growing at,
[00:17:57] Roelof Botha: you know, it grew mid 20s this year,
[00:17:59] Roelof Botha: but probably a little more next year,
[00:18:01] Roelof Botha: because the stalling could 40%.
[00:18:03] Roelof Botha: So it's just interesting.
[00:18:05] Roelof Botha: I mean, we talk about these things in the isolation,
[00:18:08] Roelof Botha: but when you zoom out and look across,
[00:18:10] Roelof Botha: would you prefer to buy the thing at 20X,
[00:18:12] Roelof Botha: growing 300% or the thing going at 20%, 30% at 40X?
[00:18:17] Roelof Botha: Hmm, you know, it's just anomalous.
[00:18:20] Roelof Botha: Maybe it does speak to some kind of,
[00:18:22] Roelof Botha: hey, to be fair to SpaceX, it's an N of 1,
[00:18:25] Roelof Botha: it is profitable, it doesn't have a direct competitor,
[00:18:28] Roelof Botha: huge market, but I think a lot of that
[00:18:30] Roelof Botha: is just the great leader of premium.
[00:18:33] Roy, give me a price.
[00:18:36] I, 250, I don't know, I'll actually, I'll pay 250, 400,
[00:18:39] Roelof Botha: you know, I'm not spending it on a company.
[00:18:41] Roelof Botha: Okay, we're going to put 350 down for,
[00:18:43] Jason Calacanis: Roy, I'm going to go for 420.
[00:18:46] Great, great, Harry, great.
[00:18:49] Keith Rabois: Great, great, I'm going to go 500.
[00:18:51] Keith Rabois: Yeah.
[00:18:52] Keith Rabois: Or Harry's 340, I might go,
[00:18:54] Keith Rabois: I'm either going to go 500 or 339, I can't decide which,
[00:18:57] Keith Rabois: but I'm going 500, I'm going 500.
[00:18:58] Keith Rabois: And that's not consumer, other people's time,
[00:19:01] Roelof Botha: trying to think about it's a game theory.
[00:19:02] Roelof Botha: Okay, okay.
[00:19:03] Roelof Botha: The big fucking deal, Netflix acquiring Warner Brothers,
[00:19:07] Jason Calacanis: 82.7 billion dollars, one of the biggest deals.
[00:19:12] Jason Calacanis: First question is, how did we analyze this?
[00:19:15] Jason Calacanis: Second question is, will it even go through?
[00:19:19] Jason Calacanis: How do we think about this?
[00:19:20] Jason Calacanis: First of all, you're right, you say Netflix acquiring,
[00:19:22] Roelof Botha: Netflix hoping to acquire,
[00:19:24] Roelof Botha: but with a lot of opposition from a hostile, from powerment,
[00:19:27] Roelof Botha: I think the big zoom out of venture comment is,
[00:19:30] Roelof Botha: Netflix won, they ate the media industry,
[00:19:33] Roelof Botha: their market cap is $470 billion.
[00:19:37] Roelof Botha: The biggest studio is sub 200 billion dollars,
[00:19:40] Roelof Botha: Comcast is worth $100 billion, Netflix won.
[00:19:44] Roelof Botha: They can ingest this by its 20,
[00:19:47] Roelof Botha: less than 20% delusion and keep powering through.
[00:19:50] Roelof Botha: That's a zoom out comment.
[00:19:51] Roelof Botha: They come to the table here.
[00:19:53] Roelof Botha: I mean, it's just so interesting how,
[00:19:55] Roelof Botha: I matched the other players with one caveat that'll come.
[00:19:59] Roelof Botha: Netflix is a call at $470 billion market cap company,
[00:20:03] Roelof Botha: putting a 100 billion, just under 100 billion bucks
[00:20:06] Roelof Botha: on the table.
[00:20:07] Roelof Botha: Powerment is a sub 20 billion dollar company,
[00:20:09] Roelof Botha: putting 100 billion on the table,
[00:20:11] Roelof Botha: relying on debt plus PE investors,
[00:20:15] Roelof Botha: like the Kushner Fund and a bunch of other funds
[00:20:18] Roelof Botha: to bridge the difference.
[00:20:19] Roelof Botha: Those are very outmatched competitors in this hostile bid.
[00:20:24] Roelof Botha: And again, as I say back to the big picture is,
[00:20:27] Roelof Botha: the outsider, the tech backed,
[00:20:29] Roelof Botha: the venture backed company has basically
[00:20:33] Roelof Botha: a far better business model than any of the studios
[00:20:35] Roelof Botha: and is eventually gone up,
[00:20:36] Roelof Botha: as you're seeing it here, start to eat them.
[00:20:38] Roelof Botha: That's the big picture.
[00:20:40] Do you think it will go through?
[00:20:41] Roelof Botha: That involves knowing,
[00:20:43] Roelof Botha: I mean, there's so many dimensions of going through.
[00:20:46] Roelof Botha: First of all, it's clear, what's clear?
[00:20:48] Roelof Botha: It's clear the board of Warner Brothers Discovery,
[00:20:52] Roelof Botha: which is their technical and WBD,
[00:20:53] Roelof Botha: wants to do this deal.
[00:20:55] Roelof Botha: Paramount and put the thing into play,
[00:20:57] Roelof Botha: but the board's dynamic is,
[00:20:59] Roelof Botha: what do you do as a public board?
[00:21:01] Roelof Botha: You say, what's the certainty of clothes?
[00:21:04] Roelof Botha: The person who is 500 billion dollars plus or minus
[00:21:06] Roelof Botha: is more likely to close than the person
[00:21:08] Roelof Botha: who has 20 billion dollars plus or minus.
[00:21:11] Roelof Botha: I'll go with him.
[00:21:12] Roelof Botha: So they want to get that deal done,
[00:21:13] Roelof Botha: but you have a whole bunch of regular regulators
[00:21:16] Roelof Botha: and then you have political overtones
[00:21:19] Roelof Botha: and we also should put in Hollywood artists
[00:21:21] Roelof Botha: because they're fun too.
[00:21:22] Roelof Botha: From a regulatory perspective,
[00:21:25] Roelof Botha: Netflix is much more concerned for the FTC
[00:21:28] Roelof Botha: because of monopoly power,
[00:21:30] Roelof Botha: a legend monopoly power
[00:21:31] Roelof Botha: because HBO is a streamer and Netflix is a streamer.
[00:21:34] Roelof Botha: Paramount is much more of a concern to the FCC
[00:21:38] Roelof Botha: from a broadcasting license perspective.
[00:21:40] Roelof Botha: So both of them have to go through everyone,
[00:21:42] Roelof Botha: but there's a different institutional,
[00:21:48] Roelof Botha: the different regulatory pushback for each of the two.
[00:21:50] Roelof Botha: All other things been equal, you'd say,
[00:21:52] Roelof Botha: it wouldn't go through kind of just in terms of you.
[00:21:56] Roelof Botha: It's a classic thing.
[00:21:57] Roelof Botha: If you do the near- and analysis,
[00:21:59] Roelof Botha: oh my god, if you just focus on streaming,
[00:22:00] Roelof Botha: the Netflix is big, HBO puts them a little bigger,
[00:22:03] Roelof Botha: they're over 30% everyone rings their hands
[00:22:06] Roelof Botha: and says it's over.
[00:22:07] Roelof Botha: Netflix will say, zoom out, call this entertainment,
[00:22:10] Roelof Botha: take into account YouTube, take into account broadcast TV,
[00:22:13] Roelof Botha: we're still teeny tiny push the throwin'.
[00:22:15] Roelof Botha: That's a known regulatory issue
[00:22:18] Roelof Botha: and it'll get debated and litigated.
[00:22:22] Roelof Botha: The two other things we haven't to talk about,
[00:22:24] Roelof Botha: more than my fun in different ways.
[00:22:25] Roelof Botha: One is more than any end,
[00:22:28] Roelof Botha: more than ever you have political overtones here,
[00:22:31] Roelof Botha: obviously the investor base, even leaving aside,
[00:22:33] Roelof Botha: coach, you know, you obviously have the elephants appear
[00:22:35] Roelof Botha: to be pretty tight with the White House.
[00:22:38] Roelof Botha: You have Trump already commenting
[00:22:39] Roelof Botha: a little bit on the Netflix side.
[00:22:41] Roelof Botha: So you do have the thumbprint of the executive office
[00:22:45] Roelof Botha: probably coming in on this one, he said gently.
[00:22:48] Roelof Botha: And then the really fun one is,
[00:22:50] Roelof Botha: because Hollywood hates the Netflix deal.
[00:22:53] Roelof Botha: And you have to ask yourself why,
[00:22:54] Roelof Botha: it wasn't obvious to me until I did some reading
[00:22:56] Roelof Botha: and like, yeah, Hollywood is all about the creators.
[00:22:58] Roelof Botha: It's not monopoly power screwing the consumers,
[00:23:02] Roelof Botha: it's monopsony power, right?
[00:23:04] Roelof Botha: If Netflix becomes the biggest single buyer of content,
[00:23:09] then if you're making content,
[00:23:10] Roelof Botha: which is what Hollywood does, making, right?
[00:23:13] Roelof Botha: You have to sell to, you know,
[00:23:14] Roelof Botha: that the media buyer for Netflix
[00:23:16] Roelof Botha: becomes the most important person in your life
[00:23:18] Roelof Botha: and your biggest customers.
[00:23:19] Roelof Botha: And they correctly hate that.
[00:23:21] Roelof Botha: And you know, they'll say it's because it'll be bland
[00:23:24] Roelof Botha: and boring content and it will be
[00:23:25] Roelof Botha: because corporations are more boring
[00:23:27] Roelof Botha: with content than individuals.
[00:23:29] Roelof Botha: But it's also, let's get real
[00:23:30] Roelof Botha: because Netflix will exert its power to not overpay.
[00:23:34] So it's always interesting
[00:23:37] Roelof Botha: because regulatory is a poach kind of really focus
[00:23:39] Roelof Botha: on the damage to the consumer.
[00:23:41] And that's not the case here,
[00:23:42] Roelof Botha: but if you're a producer of content,
[00:23:44] Roelof Botha: if you're a name your famous movie star, you like hate this.
[00:23:48] Roelof Botha: You're like, I do not want Netflix to have all that leverage on me
[00:23:51] Roelof Botha: or they'll have me grinding out rom-coms
[00:23:53] Roelof Botha: on a low budget somewhere in Romania.
[00:23:56] Roelof Botha: And I'm not gonna like that.
[00:23:57] Roelof Botha: It's not gonna be fun.
[00:23:58] Roelof Botha: I'm surely an order to capri is terrified about that.
[00:24:01] Jason Calacanis: Yeah.
[00:24:02] Jason Calacanis: Absolutely.
[00:24:03] Roelof Botha: I mean, you might have to go down
[00:24:04] Roelof Botha: into single digit millions for those, you know,
[00:24:06] Roelof Botha: 20 minute movies.
[00:24:08] Roelof Botha: And then hold.
[00:24:10] Roelof Botha: And yeah, so many ways to pile on on that one.
[00:24:12] Roelof Botha: But yeah, interesting.
[00:24:15] Keith Rabois: You know, a small thing that's interesting to me is,
[00:24:18] is the CEO of Zasov, is that your pronounces name?
[00:24:20] Keith Rabois: David Zasov.
[00:24:22] Keith Rabois: Clearly he does not want to do the paramount deal.
[00:24:25] Keith Rabois: Yeah.
[00:24:25] Keith Rabois: It is interesting.
[00:24:26] Keith Rabois: And if you've been, for folks, if you've gone through M&A,
[00:24:29] Keith Rabois: you really want to have two real offers.
[00:24:32] Keith Rabois: Back up, you want to have one real and one fake offer,
[00:24:34] Keith Rabois: like one stop, at least one fake offer.
[00:24:36] Keith Rabois: You can tell Corp.
[00:24:36] Keith Rabois: You have another offer.
[00:24:38] Keith Rabois: But if you've ever had two as a founder,
[00:24:42] Keith Rabois: and I've done both, had two and had a had a pseudo offer,
[00:24:44] Keith Rabois: but when you really have two,
[00:24:45] Keith Rabois: you really think about what you want to do with your life more.
[00:24:47] Keith Rabois: Just the interesting dynamic,
[00:24:48] Keith Rabois: because I just really don't think he wants to go work
[00:24:50] Keith Rabois: for Larry Jr. at Paramount.
[00:24:54] Keith Rabois: It's confusing whether he'll make more money
[00:24:55] Keith Rabois: under that deal or less.
[00:24:57] Keith Rabois: But versus a deal where he gets to control Morris Destiny,
[00:25:01] Keith Rabois: some of the assets stay on as a separate company,
[00:25:03] Keith Rabois: as a founder, and he's not a founder,
[00:25:04] Keith Rabois: as a founder, I would take the Netflix deal in a heartbeat.
[00:25:08] Keith Rabois: And I do think that is some of this,
[00:25:09] Keith Rabois: say, go away Paramount,
[00:25:11] Keith Rabois: because management doesn't want to do the deal.
[00:25:13] Keith Rabois: Management just doesn't want to,
[00:25:14] Keith Rabois: so it'll be interesting when they do attend,
[00:25:16] Keith Rabois: but the hustle offer, right?
[00:25:18] Keith Rabois: If 51% of the shareholders take it
[00:25:20] Keith Rabois: because there, this may be a divergence of interest
[00:25:23] Keith Rabois: at the margin between the two,
[00:25:24] Keith Rabois: but I don't think management wants to do this Paramount deal.
[00:25:27] I thought it was interesting, David Allison said,
[00:25:29] Jason Calacanis: the board have not even responded to Paramount's offer.
[00:25:32] Jason Calacanis: Like no response at all to Roy's point earlier
[00:25:35] Jason Calacanis: in terms of where the appetite is from WBD.
[00:25:38] Jason Calacanis: And it's clear they were talking earlier.
[00:25:39] Roelof Botha: It's clear as Paramount said they put the deal into play.
[00:25:42] Roelof Botha: And then, you know, again, that's the problem
[00:25:44] Roelof Botha: when a small company puts a deal into play,
[00:25:47] Roelof Botha: you know, the company that you're trying to acquire
[00:25:51] Roelof Botha: kind of mentally gets its head around selling itself.
[00:25:53] Roelof Botha: And then it can just decide to sell itself to someone else.
[00:25:56] Roelof Botha: And again, going back to the big picture here,
[00:25:59] Roelof Botha: someone else is a 480-billion dollar market cap,
[00:26:02] Roelof Botha: and you don't.
[00:26:03] And that's what's happening here.
[00:26:06] Roelof Botha: And at the margin, I don't know how important it is,
[00:26:08] Keith Rabois: but at the margin, Netflix also has a revenue arbitrage.
[00:26:11] Keith Rabois: It trades at a much higher multiple.
[00:26:13] Keith Rabois: Yeah.
[00:26:13] Keith Rabois: And then come under a little pressure
[00:26:15] Keith Rabois: when you buy a large asset, but it still remains true.
[00:26:17] Keith Rabois: Netflix, Netflix's equity is cheap,
[00:26:19] Keith Rabois: relatively cheap to buy this asset.
[00:26:22] Keith Rabois: And they may be able to inflate all the assets
[00:26:25] Keith Rabois: to 10 times more revenue, right?
[00:26:27] Keith Rabois: If they do that, this is an incredibly accretive deal
[00:26:29] Keith Rabois: for them versus the most expensive deal Paramount could do,
[00:26:33] Keith Rabois: even if it's due or die, right?
[00:26:34] Keith Rabois: The revenue arbitrage is not to be understated
[00:26:36] Keith Rabois: in a deal like this.
[00:26:36] Keith Rabois: Yeah.
[00:26:37] Keith Rabois: Yeah.
[00:26:38] Though it is interesting, the Netflix stock ticked down slightly,
[00:26:41] Roelof Botha: but I think that's a little short-termest.
[00:26:43] Roelof Botha: I think even aside from the revenue arbitrage,
[00:26:46] Roelof Botha: the beauty of Netflix is, again, zooming out,
[00:26:49] Roelof Botha: because you have global distribution,
[00:26:52] Roelof Botha: you can monetize content better than anyone else.
[00:26:55] Roelof Botha: The value of the, you can pay more for content
[00:26:57] Roelof Botha: because you got more people to sell the content to.
[00:26:59] Roelof Botha: It's just that simple, right?
[00:27:01] Roelof Botha: The business model won.
[00:27:02] Roelof Botha: I think one of the questions you put in here was,
[00:27:05] Roelof Botha: because you know, I'm not gonna lie and say,
[00:27:07] Roelof Botha: I spend my time agonizing about the entertainment industry,
[00:27:10] Roelof Botha: M&A.
[00:27:11] Roelof Botha: Well, I got to say it's passing, poor HBO,
[00:27:14] Roelof Botha: which was so good.
[00:27:15] Roelof Botha: It's been owned by so many dreadful people.
[00:27:17] Roelof Botha: It's, you know, it was founded, it was incubated in time,
[00:27:20] Roelof Botha: then it was time-warner, then time-warner, AOL,
[00:27:23] Roelof Botha: and then dear God AT&T,
[00:27:25] Roelof Botha: and then they finally get out to be Warner Brothers Discovery
[00:27:28] Roelof Botha: and they're kind of on their own doing their thing,
[00:27:30] Roelof Botha: and now they're subject of a hostile takeover.
[00:27:32] Roelof Botha: And poor AT&T idiots made them change their name to Max
[00:27:36] Roelof Botha: and have you reload the app, and it's all,
[00:27:38] Roelof Botha: it's, I mean, they've taken the best high-end TV product
[00:27:42] Roelof Botha: in history and just trashed at two
[00:27:44] Roelof Botha: five different corporate owners.
[00:27:45] Roelof Botha: So whoever gets this thing, please be nice to HBO.
[00:27:48] Roelof Botha: It was great once.
[00:27:49] Roelof Botha: I have, you know, emotional connection.
[00:27:51] Roelof Botha: But I actually think that the fun question you asked
[00:27:53] Roelof Botha: how he was, you know, what other examples of this will,
[00:27:57] Roelof Botha: this is the digital world, the Zoom out comment here,
[00:28:00] Roelof Botha: is this is the digital world taking over old school industries,
[00:28:04] Roelof Botha: yet another old school industry is world over and died, right?
[00:28:08] Roelof Botha: You know, and I think that's a super question.
[00:28:10] Roelof Botha: And I thought it was a good one, you know, and, you know,
[00:28:13] Roelof Botha: I was thinking about it a lot,
[00:28:14] Roelof Botha: because what is the other industries,
[00:28:16] Roelof Botha: if you're a shockwave that are,
[00:28:17] Roelof Botha: where do you see for else?
[00:28:19] Roelof Botha: I think there's a bunch, and that's the interesting thing,
[00:28:21] Roelof Botha: because when I started in the 90s,
[00:28:24] Roelof Botha: yeah, IT was exactly that.
[00:28:25] Roelof Botha: It was information technology,
[00:28:27] Roelof Botha: and most of it was sold to corporations
[00:28:29] Roelof Botha: to effectively account for that shit, you know,
[00:28:31] Roelof Botha: like you had computers to account people to account money,
[00:28:34] Roelof Botha: to account, that's all it did, hence the name.
[00:28:36] Roelof Botha: I mean, IT, information systems, those boring names,
[00:28:40] Roelof Botha: and that's still the bulk of, you know, core IT investing,
[00:28:45] Roelof Botha: you know, you have software to 1B to B, right?
[00:28:48] Roelof Botha: But the amazing thing, this is to your point, how he said,
[00:28:50] Roelof Botha: and only since the last 25 years,
[00:28:54] Roelof Botha: digitization, eight or a couple of industries,
[00:28:57] Roelof Botha: I mean, the obvious big ones at eight is, it ate advertising.
[00:29:01] Roelof Botha: I mean, you know, Facebook and Google have 70%
[00:29:03] Roelof Botha: of not just all digital advertising, but all advertising.
[00:29:06] Roelof Botha: Thanks for playing newspapers,
[00:29:08] Roelof Botha: thanks for playing broadcast TV, they won, right?
[00:29:12] Roelof Botha: So from 95 on, venture backed Silicon Valley startups,
[00:29:16] Roelof Botha: ate the advertising industry and took all the money,
[00:29:19] Roelof Botha: and now you're seeing the second big one,
[00:29:21] Roelof Botha: the second, I mean, you know, madmen,
[00:29:22] Roelof Botha: it looked like it was fun to be an advertising in New York,
[00:29:25] Roelof Botha: and now little tech weenies in Silicon Valley,
[00:29:27] Roelof Botha: we just did it to Hollywood, like thanks for playing guys,
[00:29:31] Roelof Botha: I know you have these cute studio businesses,
[00:29:33] Roelof Botha: but we've got distribution on the internet,
[00:29:37] Roelof Botha: we've got algorithms for predicting which software works,
[00:29:39] Roelof Botha: we're gonna take over your, you know,
[00:29:41] Roelof Botha: your sexy Hollywood business too.
[00:29:43] Roelof Botha: And so you're right, how he what's next?
[00:29:45] Roelof Botha: And I was thinking, it was a great question,
[00:29:46] Roelof Botha: I started, I mean, to me, you actually talked about it
[00:29:49] Roelof Botha: last time, the next one is Fintech.
[00:29:52] Roelof Botha: What point does someone like Revolut say,
[00:29:54] Roelof Botha: oh, I woke up and realized,
[00:29:55] Roelof Botha: I'm the largest market cap company, bank company in New York,
[00:29:58] Roelof Botha: maybe I'll buy one of you branch baby thingies,
[00:30:00] Roelof Botha: like Amazon bought Whole Foods, right?
[00:30:04] Roelof Botha: Cause that's the third one that got swallowed,
[00:30:05] Roelof Botha: retail got swallowed, I mean, if you think about it,
[00:30:07] Roelof Botha: they swallowed advertising completely,
[00:30:09] Roelof Botha: they swallowed a lot of entertainment, not all of it,
[00:30:11] Roelof Botha: they swallowed a good slug of retail,
[00:30:13] Roelof Botha: probably bank is gonna go that way,
[00:30:15] Roelof Botha: and you know, at some point maybe auto.
[00:30:17] Roelof Botha: I mean, it's just amazing over an elongated period of time,
[00:30:21] Roelof Botha: just the power of digital software enabled technology
[00:30:26] Roelof Botha: in conjunction with the internet to just, you know,
[00:30:29] Roelof Botha: each entirely destroy and consume other businesses.
[00:30:33] Roelof Botha: Before we move to some of the biggest AR deals
[00:30:35] Jason Calacanis: that we've seen go down, couple of,
[00:30:37] Jason Calacanis: I thought we were super interesting and you can choose,
[00:30:40] Jason Calacanis: like Tiger's new $2.2 billion fund, downsizing.
[00:30:45] Jason Calacanis: I know it sounds crazy, $2.2 billion is a huge amount of money,
[00:30:48] Jason Calacanis: but from the lofty heights of 21, it's a big change,
[00:30:53] Jason Calacanis: anything of note that we should think about here?
[00:30:56] You know, I thought the most,
[00:30:57] Keith Rabois: I should have copied down the exact number,
[00:30:59] Keith Rabois: I thought the most interesting thing in the reporting
[00:31:00] Keith Rabois: was that, so the idea to raise a prior fund
[00:31:03] Keith Rabois: about $2.2 billion, right, 23.
[00:31:04] Keith Rabois: The only idea that nine deals this year,
[00:31:06] Keith Rabois: versus 100 and some odd in 2021.
[00:31:10] Keith Rabois: I think what's just interesting is,
[00:31:11] Keith Rabois: this is a super smart group of folks,
[00:31:12] Keith Rabois: I think both strategies are of the moment.
[00:31:14] Keith Rabois: I think I actually think the Tiger strategy in 2021,
[00:31:17] Keith Rabois: when we had an IPO a day,
[00:31:19] Keith Rabois: in every recurring revenue company could IPO
[00:31:21] Keith Rabois: at a couple hundred million in revenue,
[00:31:22] Keith Rabois: growing 50% with 140% NRR,
[00:31:25] Keith Rabois: I think that was the strategy of the day.
[00:31:27] Keith Rabois: Now, Tiger seed itself, re-inflate with Open-A and others,
[00:31:30] Keith Rabois: it's seen everything we've talked about,
[00:31:31] Keith Rabois: the huge growth, the unlimited growth for the winners,
[00:31:34] Keith Rabois: and now they've tilted to that strategy,
[00:31:37] Keith Rabois: and I think growth investors probably should
[00:31:39] Keith Rabois: tilt to the strategy of the day.
[00:31:41] Keith Rabois: But I just think it's interesting,
[00:31:43] Keith Rabois: and we'll see what the 2029 fund does,
[00:31:47] Keith Rabois: but doing nine deals at that scale is pretty tight,
[00:31:50] Keith Rabois: it's a pretty concentrated focus, isn't it?
[00:31:53] Keith Rabois: It is, I get them credit.
[00:31:54] Roelof Botha: I just want to stay, I'll stop,
[00:31:56] Roelof Botha: because it takes up, look,
[00:31:57] Roelof Botha: the guy who wanted that has got billions of dollars
[00:31:59] Roelof Botha: doesn't need the grace, right?
[00:32:01] Roelof Botha: It speaks to a love of the game that he says,
[00:32:04] Roelof Botha: I'm going to swallow my pride,
[00:32:06] Roelof Botha: because I don't think he's going to say
[00:32:07] Roelof Botha: the 21 fund was success or the right idea.
[00:32:09] Roelof Botha: You might get bailed out by some of your big investments
[00:32:12] Roelof Botha: like Open-A-I, but you don't look back.
[00:32:14] Roelof Botha: We all have periods as investors that we look back
[00:32:17] Roelof Botha: and we don't look back on in pride, where you go.
[00:32:20] Roelof Botha: I got that wrong, and I'm sure a team of smarter
[00:32:22] Roelof Botha: to come and looks back in 2021,
[00:32:24] Roelof Botha: and says, that was hubris, and I was wrong.
[00:32:27] Roelof Botha: And I give him huge credit for not going,
[00:32:29] Roelof Botha: and now I'm just going to take my $2 billion,
[00:32:31] Roelof Botha: $5 billion, and stay in my house in Palm Beach or whatever.
[00:32:35] Roelof Botha: I'm going to get back in the game
[00:32:36] Roelof Botha: where there's a smaller fund,
[00:32:38] Roelof Botha: take the little bit of knots from the knockers
[00:32:41] Roelof Botha: that say you are, and just do my job and do it well.
[00:32:43] Roelof Botha: So I think it's great.
[00:32:46] Roelof Botha: I think all credit to them.
[00:32:47] Roelof Botha: And what you're seeing is, which is always true,
[00:32:50] Roelof Botha: is that the original strategy they had of
[00:32:51] Roelof Botha: doing the very best deals, doing them late,
[00:32:53] Roelof Botha: doing them with concentration, was a light strategy.
[00:32:57] Roelof Botha: It worked with JD.com in 2012,
[00:32:59] Roelof Botha: or whatever it was when they did that in China.
[00:33:01] Roelof Botha: It worked early on in the internet land.
[00:33:04] Roelof Botha: They got carried away, they made some mistakes,
[00:33:06] Roelof Botha: and now they're sobering up, flying right,
[00:33:08] Roelof Botha: and staying in the game.
[00:33:09] Roelof Botha: So all credit to them.
[00:33:11] And a 20% GB commit is not small.
[00:33:13] Keith Rabois: No, I mean, this is purely putting your...
[00:33:16] Keith Rabois: 20% is at the limit where it's almost not worth doing.
[00:33:20] Keith Rabois: You might as well just direct invest.
[00:33:21] Keith Rabois: You're just not getting enough leverage on your money.
[00:33:23] Keith Rabois: You have always thought, 20% was a weird number, right?
[00:33:25] Keith Rabois: Assuming you have 20% carry, right?
[00:33:29] Keith Rabois: You're not making enough money.
[00:33:30] Keith Rabois: Like all the grief of having LPs
[00:33:32] Keith Rabois: isn't worth it at 20% GB commit, is it?
[00:33:34] Keith Rabois: Well, it is, because you need to make a check size.
[00:33:36] Roelof Botha: The point is that 20%, at 400 million,
[00:33:40] Roelof Botha: you wouldn't be a late stage fund.
[00:33:41] Roelof Botha: No, I think...
[00:33:42] Roelof Botha: You get to write bigger checks,
[00:33:43] Keith Rabois: but you don't make so much more money versus investing.
[00:33:46] Keith Rabois: In theory, you don't make enough money for the grief, I think.
[00:33:49] Keith Rabois: I understand what you're saying.
[00:33:51] Roelof Botha: Actually, the math is easy.
[00:33:52] Roelof Botha: You can do it in your head, it roughly doubles it.
[00:33:54] Roelof Botha: You have 20% of your money, and then you have 20% carry.
[00:33:57] Roelof Botha: So if you two X the fund, half your gains come from your capital
[00:34:00] Roelof Botha: and half your gains come from your carry.
[00:34:02] Roelof Botha: It's easy math, like knowing fees.
[00:34:04] Roelof Botha: Yes, but in theory, now you're right.
[00:34:06] Keith Rabois: This breaks down on late stage funds.
[00:34:07] Keith Rabois: For early stage investing, actually,
[00:34:09] Keith Rabois: I think it's worse because it's harder to get into the deal, right?
[00:34:12] Keith Rabois: It may be the opposite for growth, right?
[00:34:13] Keith Rabois: Jason, you're exactly right.
[00:34:15] Roelof Botha: If you were running...
[00:34:16] Roelof Botha: If you had 400 million if you were own
[00:34:18] Roelof Botha: and you were doing an early stage fund,
[00:34:20] Roelof Botha: you're coming an 800 million dollar fund
[00:34:21] Roelof Botha: to take other people's money.
[00:34:22] Roelof Botha: It's a silly, you're exactly right.
[00:34:24] Roelof Botha: I would argue that on the late stage business,
[00:34:26] Roelof Botha: there's a critical...
[00:34:27] Roelof Botha: Look, you can show up at a 200 million dollar round
[00:34:30] Roelof Botha: with a 30 million dollar check and say, pick me.
[00:34:32] Roelof Botha: That's just not a thing, right?
[00:34:34] Roelof Botha: So he's sizing for the business at hand, and I agree.
[00:34:37] Roelof Botha: I think every LP probably draws a huge amount of comfort
[00:34:40] Roelof Botha: from that check.
[00:34:40] Roelof Botha: I personally think, especially when you're dealing
[00:34:43] Roelof Botha: with wealthy people, where they put their money
[00:34:45] Roelof Botha: is what you want to know.
[00:34:46] Roelof Botha: And I would actually think LP's don't focus on that enough.
[00:34:49] Roelof Botha: I find that enormously we are showing
[00:34:52] Roelof Botha: that someone cared enough to write 20%.
[00:34:55] Roelof Botha: And when things get tough, or when you're trying to...
[00:34:58] Roelof Botha: God forbid, get your capital back versus play the win,
[00:35:01] Roelof Botha: that 400 million will keep these guys focused.
[00:35:03] Roelof Botha: So I think it's great.
[00:35:04] Roelof Botha: Again, I think everything about that's good.
[00:35:06] Roelof Botha: I hadn't picked up on the 20%, but that's awesome.
[00:35:08] Roelof Botha: For folks who might be founders or others,
[00:35:11] Keith Rabois: that's a lot for a fund, right?
[00:35:13] Keith Rabois: I think the average growth fund is about 1%.
[00:35:16] Keith Rabois: And even that can be manipulated
[00:35:17] Keith Rabois: and where you come up with 1%, right?
[00:35:19] Keith Rabois: It can be just maybe one or two of the partners
[00:35:22] Keith Rabois: that are richer are putting the money in.
[00:35:23] Keith Rabois: It can be from loans.
[00:35:24] Keith Rabois: It can be from cashless things.
[00:35:25] Keith Rabois: To Roy's point, you've got to love the game
[00:35:27] Keith Rabois: if you're that rich.
[00:35:28] Keith Rabois: Even if you had a rough couple of funds,
[00:35:30] Keith Rabois: you've got to believe this is worth it, right?
[00:35:32] Keith Rabois: This is so much of the fund.
[00:35:34] Keith Rabois: It's, and money is a great crook serum.
[00:35:37] Don't tell me what you think.
[00:35:38] Roelof Botha: Tell me what you do.
[00:35:40] Roelof Botha: At the end of the day, do you love me?
[00:35:42] Roelof Botha: Do you love the game?
[00:35:42] Roelof Botha: Is one question?
[00:35:43] Roelof Botha: Do you love it?
[00:35:44] Roelof Botha: 400 million is a very different damn question.
[00:35:46] Roelof Botha: And clearly they do.
[00:35:48] Roelof Botha: At 400 million, you exactly right.
[00:35:49] Roelof Botha: 400 million, you win, because you win.
[00:35:51] Roelof Botha: Yeah, because you win.
[00:35:52] Roelof Botha: I also think it pains him greatly
[00:35:54] Jason Calacanis: that their brand has been
[00:35:56] Jason Calacanis: tarnished in the LP community.
[00:35:57] Jason Calacanis: And he will do everything possible
[00:35:59] Jason Calacanis: to make our people money again.
[00:36:01] Jason Calacanis: I think he is wounded and an incredible dude, actually.
[00:36:05] Jason Calacanis: I'm a big fan of Chase.
[00:36:06] Jason Calacanis: Surely I've never met the guy,
[00:36:07] Roelof Botha: but that's how I read it.
[00:36:08] Roelof Botha: Absolutely.
[00:36:09] Roelof Botha: You know, there's a point at which
[00:36:11] Roelof Botha: you're not doing this for the marginal money.
[00:36:13] Roelof Botha: You're doing this because you like it
[00:36:15] Roelof Botha: and you like to do it well.
[00:36:16] Roelof Botha: You take money from LPs, you value that relationship.
[00:36:18] Roelof Botha: I totally agree.
[00:36:19] Roelof Botha: I think that would be a highly disciplined, highly focused machine.
[00:36:23] Roelof Botha: Next, Navine Databricks had a AI
[00:36:26] Jason Calacanis: announces his 500 million dollar seed round
[00:36:29] Jason Calacanis: at a $5 billion price.
[00:36:32] Jason Calacanis: We actually discussed this like months ago.
[00:36:36] Jason Calacanis: I don't know if you remember it,
[00:36:37] Jason Calacanis: but well before it was announced this week,
[00:36:41] it was just announced this week
[00:36:42] Jason Calacanis: and caused a stir at the $500 million seed.
[00:36:46] Jason Calacanis: And I think it just got to be happened.
[00:36:48] Roelof Botha: Sure.
[00:36:48] Roelof Botha: I mean, I think it's, I can't remember who wrote the book.
[00:36:51] Roelof Botha: That's another archipelago
[00:36:53] Roelof Botha: where it perhaps didn't apply as much,
[00:36:54] Roelof Botha: but it was the title was,
[00:36:56] Roelof Botha: once you're lucky twice, you're good.
[00:36:58] Roelof Botha: I'm Navine's done it twice.
[00:36:59] Roelof Botha: I mean, you just look at that and you go,
[00:37:01] Roelof Botha: at this point you can draw a line.
[00:37:02] Roelof Botha: And once you can draw a line,
[00:37:03] Roelof Botha: the VCs are gonna just show up on mass.
[00:37:05] Roelof Botha: It totally makes sense.
[00:37:06] Roelof Botha: Not, you know, and everyone's doing there.
[00:37:08] Roelof Botha: I'm delighted to back, Navine, tweet this morning,
[00:37:11] Roelof Botha: yesterday morning.
[00:37:12] Roelof Botha: Yeah, I mean, and it is true to some extent.
[00:37:14] Roelof Botha: Once there's such a lot of data
[00:37:17] Roelof Botha: in someone who's been successful twice,
[00:37:19] Roelof Botha: you just gotta look at it.
[00:37:20] Roelof Botha: I can totally see how you can extrapolate to that, you know.
[00:37:22] Roelof Botha: Whether the math of,
[00:37:24] Roelof Botha: what kind of seed deal at $5 billion
[00:37:26] Roelof Botha: can give you a three to five X return?
[00:37:28] Roelof Botha: I don't have clarity on that.
[00:37:29] Roelof Botha: It's a lot of enterprise value to be created.
[00:37:32] Roelof Botha: But I know, I know how, I don't know if I,
[00:37:35] Roelof Botha: I know how I'd write that investment memo
[00:37:37] Roelof Botha: if I was writing it for my colleagues.
[00:37:39] Roelof Botha: It would be once you're lucky twice, you're good.
[00:37:40] Roelof Botha: This guy's done it twice back him,
[00:37:43] you know, which is different than saying,
[00:37:44] Roelof Botha: I see a $25 billion outcome here.
[00:37:46] Roelof Botha: I just don't know it.
[00:37:47] Roelof Botha: The one lesson that I've learned from a lot of these deals,
[00:37:49] Jason Calacanis: whether it's thinking machines or this or some others,
[00:37:53] Jason Calacanis: is that although it's $505 billion
[00:37:55] Jason Calacanis: on the sticker price when it's announced,
[00:37:57] Jason Calacanis: there's actually several rounds before
[00:37:58] Jason Calacanis: that Sequoia and Andrewson have done
[00:38:01] Jason Calacanis: that are considerably cheaper
[00:38:02] Jason Calacanis: and the $5 billion sticker seed is actually
[00:38:06] Jason Calacanis: very different to the first two rounds before
[00:38:09] Jason Calacanis: that no one's picked up on.
[00:38:10] Jason Calacanis: I don't know if that's the case in this case
[00:38:12] Roelof Botha: and you might know better than me,
[00:38:13] Roelof Botha: but you're right, we're seeing a lot of that.
[00:38:15] Roelof Botha: It's like, it's just so weird.
[00:38:16] Roelof Botha: It's, you know, if it's the same,
[00:38:18] Roelof Botha: and just for listeners, what you're seeing is,
[00:38:21] Roelof Botha: it can either be different investors doing early rounds
[00:38:24] Roelof Botha: and not get announced,
[00:38:25] Roelof Botha: or even weirder where you see one investor commit,
[00:38:28] Roelof Botha: and they commit some money to you at 300 million,
[00:38:30] Roelof Botha: some money at 500 million,
[00:38:32] Roelof Botha: and some money at a billion.
[00:38:34] Roelof Botha: And from the investor perspective,
[00:38:35] Roelof Botha: they make the commitment and even the checks
[00:38:37] Roelof Botha: at the same time.
[00:38:38] Roelof Botha: So their blended cost is five or six hundred million.
[00:38:41] Roelof Botha: So that's how they, that's their economics and that's the fact.
[00:38:44] Roelof Botha: But the entrepreneur can then announce
[00:38:46] Roelof Botha: a headline billion dollar raise, right?
[00:38:49] Roelof Botha: It feels a little fomo-y,
[00:38:52] Roelof Botha: and you know, obviously the idea is
[00:38:54] Roelof Botha: both do you get attention,
[00:38:55] Roelof Botha: and maybe that the next round investor is foolish enough
[00:38:58] Roelof Botha: not to realize what actually happened here,
[00:39:00] Roelof Botha: and maybe it works, but it's another,
[00:39:03] Roelof Botha: it's a sign when professional economists,
[00:39:05] Roelof Botha: you know, make lists of things that you see in bubbles.
[00:39:07] Roelof Botha: This is widely up there on,
[00:39:09] Roelof Botha: kind of weird stuff you see at top of markets.
[00:39:12] Keith Rabois: But it is, it does work in my limited experience,
[00:39:14] Keith Rabois: because even if you do three rounds at the same day,
[00:39:17] Keith Rabois: at 300, 600, and 900, or whatever it is,
[00:39:20] Keith Rabois: when you're over subscribed,
[00:39:21] Keith Rabois: it's just a message to the new investors,
[00:39:23] Keith Rabois: the price is 900.
[00:39:24] Keith Rabois: It might be, the price might even go to one, too.
[00:39:26] Keith Rabois: Like I've seen it, too.
[00:39:27] Keith Rabois: It's just a step function,
[00:39:28] Keith Rabois: and investors that are,
[00:39:31] Keith Rabois: that are struggling to get into the round, accept it.
[00:39:33] Keith Rabois: They, they act against to it,
[00:39:34] Keith Rabois: because it just is what it is.
[00:39:35] Keith Rabois: As long as there's a rash,
[00:39:36] Keith Rabois: as long as there's a,
[00:39:37] Keith Rabois: I think sometimes in venture,
[00:39:38] Keith Rabois: when deals are hot,
[00:39:40] Keith Rabois: you just have to pay the price that it is in hot deals.
[00:39:42] Keith Rabois: You just have to walk or pay the price it is.
[00:39:44] Keith Rabois: So if you can stare step around,
[00:39:46] Keith Rabois: even in a matter of hours,
[00:39:47] Keith Rabois: so that the outcome is logical,
[00:39:49] Keith Rabois: then investors can either opt-in or opt out.
[00:39:51] Keith Rabois: It is a little douchey,
[00:39:53] Keith Rabois: but it actually leads to a very efficient process
[00:39:56] Keith Rabois: for folks to opt-in or opt out, right?
[00:39:58] Keith Rabois: I mean, YC's been doing this for over a decade,
[00:40:00] Keith Rabois: you know, even in the old days,
[00:40:01] Keith Rabois: you get in before YC demo day,
[00:40:03] Keith Rabois: you paid six pre,
[00:40:04] Keith Rabois: you got an after YC demo day, it was always nine,
[00:40:06] Keith Rabois: there was always a 50%
[00:40:07] Keith Rabois: now the stepups are even higher before after demo day.
[00:40:09] Keith Rabois: So this has been going on since I started investing
[00:40:12] Keith Rabois: in YC companies, right?
[00:40:13] Keith Rabois: In 2014, the first did one.
[00:40:15] Keith Rabois: Everyone had a step up after demo day,
[00:40:17] Keith Rabois: just didn't used to be up to 60 or 100.
[00:40:19] Keith Rabois: Listen, there's not three rounds in a day,
[00:40:20] Jason Calacanis: but it is three rounds in a year.
[00:40:22] Jason Calacanis: Our favorite, the trustee, the trustee Harvey,
[00:40:25] Jason Calacanis: is back, announcing $160 million
[00:40:29] Jason Calacanis: all around La Boundaries
[00:40:30] Jason Calacanis: and $8 billion of valuation,
[00:40:32] Jason Calacanis: just to give the metrics,
[00:40:34] Jason Calacanis: $150 million in an hour,
[00:40:36] Jason Calacanis: growing 300% year on year,
[00:40:39] Jason Calacanis: 98% GDR,
[00:40:41] Jason Calacanis: 168% NDR,
[00:40:44] Jason Calacanis: good numbers,
[00:40:46] Jason Calacanis: small raising comparison,
[00:40:48] Jason Calacanis: 160 million led by Andreson at $8 billion,
[00:40:52] Jason Calacanis: so like less than 2% dilution.
[00:40:55] Jason Calacanis: Thoughts?
[00:40:56] Keith Rabois: You know, it's funny.
[00:40:57] Keith Rabois: First of all, I've joked about this.
[00:40:58] Keith Rabois: I'm, when you can get around for this,
[00:41:01] Keith Rabois: for like 3% or less dilution,
[00:41:02] Keith Rabois: I'm super in favor as an early investor, right?
[00:41:04] Keith Rabois: It's a great deal, especially if we no longer care
[00:41:06] Keith Rabois: about the downside risk.
[00:41:07] Keith Rabois: If we no longer care if it's worthless,
[00:41:09] Keith Rabois: I think it's an amazing deal.
[00:41:10] Keith Rabois: The funny thing is, when I started investing,
[00:41:12] Keith Rabois: I was taught, and in fact,
[00:41:14] Keith Rabois: I was told by one of my anchors,
[00:41:16] Keith Rabois: these kind of deals you can't recognize the markup.
[00:41:19] Keith Rabois: It's too small.
[00:41:20] Keith Rabois: I had a deal like this during the 2021 boom
[00:41:22] Keith Rabois: that quickly got marked up to $3 billion
[00:41:25] Keith Rabois: by a good investor,
[00:41:26] Keith Rabois: but it was 2% of the company, right,
[00:41:28] Keith Rabois: to get into the company,
[00:41:29] Keith Rabois: and I never recognized the round or marked up.
[00:41:31] Keith Rabois: My old piece said, you can't do it.
[00:41:32] Keith Rabois: I guess here, it's 160.
[00:41:34] Keith Rabois: That's not jump changes.
[00:41:35] Keith Rabois: No.
[00:41:36] Keith Rabois: But it's so small.
[00:41:38] Keith Rabois: It's so small.
[00:41:39] Keith Rabois: Is it a real, is it a real valuation?
[00:41:41] Keith Rabois: I don't know.
[00:41:42] Keith Rabois: Just to push on that, right?
[00:41:44] Roelof Botha: 160 over 8 billion is 2%.
[00:41:46] Roelof Botha: I mean, this is the math here.
[00:41:48] Roelof Botha: At 800 billion in SpaceX,
[00:41:50] Roelof Botha: 2% is 16 billion.
[00:41:52] Roelof Botha: They're not doing a $16 billion second.
[00:41:55] Roelof Botha: We just took that valuation seriously half an hour ago.
[00:41:58] Roelof Botha: And the interesting thing is, again,
[00:42:00] Roelof Botha: we set it a million times so there's no,
[00:42:02] Roelof Botha: there's no legal, I mean,
[00:42:04] Roelof Botha: so at 3X is 24 billion.
[00:42:06] Roelof Botha: There's no legal company,
[00:42:08] Roelof Botha: software company,
[00:42:09] Roelof Botha: been work more than 2 billion ever.
[00:42:10] Roelof Botha: So it's 10X that.
[00:42:12] Roelof Botha: The data companies, the West laws,
[00:42:14] Roelof Botha: and the Tom Ves are worth more than 2 billion.
[00:42:17] Roelof Botha: That's, you know what, 5 and 10's a billion.
[00:42:19] Roelof Botha: So still less than this.
[00:42:21] Roelof Botha: So this implies huge time expansion into labor.
[00:42:25] Roelof Botha: And then if you go on the website,
[00:42:27] Roelof Botha: huge time expansion,
[00:42:28] Roelof Botha: I'm sure beyond just legal
[00:42:30] Roelof Botha: into other professional services.
[00:42:32] Jason Calacanis: That's when you have to believe
[00:42:33] Jason Calacanis: if you're going to see this being attractive from you.
[00:42:36] You really do.
[00:42:37] Jason Calacanis: And you also have to see market dominance, I think.
[00:42:40] Jason Calacanis: You also have to be the winner.
[00:42:41] Roelof Botha: Like number two,
[00:42:42] Roelof Botha: this is not the price for the, you know, the number.
[00:42:45] Roelof Botha: Not only the winner, though, Rory,
[00:42:46] Jason Calacanis: I think actually market dominance
[00:42:48] Jason Calacanis: in a way that Uber and Lyft is.
[00:42:49] Jason Calacanis: You can't have a cloud competition there
[00:42:51] Jason Calacanis: where four players take, but there are so many.
[00:42:55] Jason Calacanis: And there are so many fragmentation of this.
[00:42:57] Jason Calacanis: You did GCAI.
[00:42:58] Jason Calacanis: I'm in so I think you need to win the whole market.
[00:43:03] Roelof Botha: That's actually a good comment.
[00:43:03] Roelof Botha: What you're saying to paraphrases,
[00:43:05] Roelof Botha: not the typical apps allegopoly,
[00:43:08] Roelof Botha: but almost like, you know, the way Netflix
[00:43:10] Roelof Botha: to go back to dominate streaming.
[00:43:12] Roelof Botha: It's like not only did I win,
[00:43:13] Roelof Botha: I have 80% market share of street or whatever it, you know,
[00:43:15] Roelof Botha: I'm the winner.
[00:43:16] Roelof Botha: I'm the Uber.
[00:43:17] Roelof Botha: Yeah.
[00:43:18] Roelof Botha: No, you're right.
[00:43:19] Roelof Botha: Because yeah, you got to extract a lot of money.
[00:43:20] Jason Calacanis: But also not the unbundling, Rory.
[00:43:22] Jason Calacanis: As I said, we're seeing this vertical unbundling
[00:43:24] Jason Calacanis: to lots of different niches
[00:43:26] Jason Calacanis: that we are both in and invested in.
[00:43:28] Jason Calacanis: I think you have to believe they subsume all of those
[00:43:31] Jason Calacanis: and be able to expand broader.
[00:43:33] Jason Calacanis: And yeah, and the theory would be first,
[00:43:37] marquee customers in the law firm in particular,
[00:43:40] Roelof Botha: that's the investment thesis, you know, top of class.
[00:43:43] Jason Calacanis: The challenge to that, there is LaGoura,
[00:43:45] Jason Calacanis: 40 millionaire also, a lot less,
[00:43:47] Jason Calacanis: but they're doing 10X euro near growth
[00:43:49] Jason Calacanis: on a smaller base, admittedly.
[00:43:51] Jason Calacanis: Yeah.
[00:43:52] Jason Calacanis: But they are doing very well in Europe.
[00:43:54] Jason Calacanis: Like LaGoura's European progress can't be underestimated.
[00:43:58] Jason Calacanis: And really the analysis from investors today
[00:44:01] Jason Calacanis: is that Harvey won the US and LaGoura winning Europe.
[00:44:05] Jason Calacanis: I think we're making it to dramatic for VCs.
[00:44:08] Keith Rabois: Here's be my analysis, okay.
[00:44:10] Keith Rabois: If Harvey went from 50 to 150 this year, okay.
[00:44:14] Keith Rabois: And 10 to 150 in two years,
[00:44:17] Keith Rabois: I would just draw the, I would just do some classic math
[00:44:20] Keith Rabois: and just draw the chart out, okay.
[00:44:21] Keith Rabois: And my entire life in B2B is a founder or investor.
[00:44:25] Keith Rabois: Every time we try to do too negative on TAM, it bites us.
[00:44:28] Keith Rabois: Now we talked about, what do we talk about,
[00:44:30] Keith Rabois: live in London, to something TAM, what do we call about it?
[00:44:33] Keith Rabois: The TAM trap, dude.
[00:44:34] Keith Rabois: It is TAM trap.
[00:44:34] Keith Rabois: I believe in it, I'm living it with my portfolio.
[00:44:37] Keith Rabois: But.
[00:44:38] Keith Rabois: But we agreed that those were old companies.
[00:44:40] Keith Rabois: I agree.
[00:44:41] Roelof Botha: Yeah, when you go 50 to 150 in one year,
[00:44:44] Keith Rabois: and if the last quarter, last four months,
[00:44:47] Keith Rabois: if the growth's consistent,
[00:44:48] Keith Rabois: so you can see a path to 400 next year,
[00:44:51] Keith Rabois: this is the same multiple we just talked about
[00:44:54] Keith Rabois: for anthropic, 20X.
[00:44:57] Keith Rabois: But did you get a sharp way?
[00:44:58] Keith Rabois: It's not from infinity.
[00:44:59] Keith Rabois: But that's our job as a dumpster is to find out liars.
[00:45:02] Keith Rabois: And if this growth is, here's my point,
[00:45:04] Keith Rabois: listen, I'm a simple man, okay.
[00:45:06] Keith Rabois: I'm a simple B2B guy.
[00:45:07] Keith Rabois: If this growth is durable, okay.
[00:45:09] Keith Rabois: If we're seeing signs that it's durable,
[00:45:11] Keith Rabois: if it has, if it really has 170% NRR
[00:45:13] Keith Rabois: and 98% logo retention,
[00:45:15] Keith Rabois: and it's accelerating at 150,
[00:45:17] Keith Rabois: this is just the bet you do.
[00:45:19] Keith Rabois: You don't pull your hair out
[00:45:21] Keith Rabois: or have to have lengthy dinners about supplanting labor
[00:45:24] Keith Rabois: with AI and whether it'll be 10 trillion tokens,
[00:45:27] Keith Rabois: you just do the deal if the revenue is durable,
[00:45:30] Keith Rabois: and it triples from 50 to 150 in one year.
[00:45:32] Keith Rabois: And the guy that got in at three billion
[00:45:34] Keith Rabois: in the beginning of the year got an insane deal.
[00:45:36] Keith Rabois: It's not that complicated.
[00:45:38] Keith Rabois: Worrying, I can go back to old SaaS spreadsheets
[00:45:40] Keith Rabois: and justify this deal.
[00:45:41] Keith Rabois: But you cannot assume that it will grow infinitum
[00:45:44] Jason Calacanis: at the same growth rates.
[00:45:46] Jason Calacanis: Great, then step out of nature
[00:45:47] Jason Calacanis: and return your last fund to your LPs.
[00:45:49] Keith Rabois: You guys, as usual, are doing the extremes
[00:45:52] Roelof Botha: that lose us the bottom line.
[00:45:54] Roelof Botha: This is a pretty simple map.
[00:45:55] Roelof Botha: This is what I, your point is,
[00:45:57] Roelof Botha: big picture points are fair,
[00:45:58] Roelof Botha: but let's just talk about the numbers behind it.
[00:46:00] Roelof Botha: Because Harry, he's not saying the same.
[00:46:02] Roelof Botha: What we're basically saying is it grew 10X last year,
[00:46:06] Roelof Botha: it grew 3X this year,
[00:46:07] Roelof Botha: this is amazing growth leaning.
[00:46:09] Roelof Botha: That's the sword flow of Jason saying.
[00:46:11] Roelof Botha: And the only argument against it is,
[00:46:13] Roelof Botha: you know, 3X this year is slower than 10X last year.
[00:46:16] Roelof Botha: So probably next year is 2X.
[00:46:17] Roelof Botha: I mean, it all boils down to the same thing is,
[00:46:21] Roelof Botha: these growth rates,
[00:46:22] Roelof Botha: these kind of multiple companies doing 10X growth rate
[00:46:25] Roelof Botha: is not something you saw in SaaS.
[00:46:28] Roelof Botha: So one of two things is true.
[00:46:30] Roelof Botha: Either they'll have that kind of 10X growth rate
[00:46:33] Roelof Botha: and then decline with the same rate
[00:46:36] Roelof Botha: of decline in SaaS companies,
[00:46:38] Roelof Botha: in which case they'll continue to grow
[00:46:39] Roelof Botha: for a long period of time,
[00:46:41] Roelof Botha: or they'll grow fast and they'll slow down fast.
[00:46:44] Roelof Botha: If it goes 10X, 2X,
[00:46:46] Roelof Botha: if it goes 10X, 3X, 50% growth,
[00:46:49] Roelof Botha: then you might have been wrong.
[00:46:50] Roelof Botha: It's the knowing fear.
[00:46:52] Roelof Botha: I mean, you lean into the things that are working,
[00:46:55] Roelof Botha: because I think the alternative,
[00:46:56] Roelof Botha: which is trying to be clever and do things
[00:46:58] Roelof Botha: that aren't working that might work in the future,
[00:46:59] Roelof Botha: is just too hard.
[00:47:01] Roelof Botha: So help me just understand this.
[00:47:03] Jason Calacanis: 10X, 3X totally yeah.
[00:47:05] Jason Calacanis: Then I say it does 2X, okay?
[00:47:07] Jason Calacanis: So 150 turns into 300, fantastic.
[00:47:11] Jason Calacanis: Then I say it goes to 80%.
[00:47:14] Jason Calacanis: That 300 is now.
[00:47:15] Jason Calacanis: How many?
[00:47:16] Roelof Botha: That's exactly the right math to do.
[00:47:18] Roelof Botha: Okay, great.
[00:47:19] Roelof Botha: So then why would you pay 8 billion?
[00:47:22] Jason Calacanis: Because you are paying three years ahead of time
[00:47:24] Jason Calacanis: for a public company multiple that that would be.
[00:47:27] Jason Calacanis: So Jason, you say do the deal.
[00:47:29] Jason Calacanis: I don't understand.
[00:47:30] Jason Calacanis: I'm really naive here.
[00:47:31] Jason Calacanis: I'm not arguing.
[00:47:32] Jason Calacanis: I'm trying to understand.
[00:47:34] Jason Calacanis: You're paying three years ahead of time
[00:47:36] Jason Calacanis: for what that would be in a public market.
[00:47:38] Jason Calacanis: If we go from 150 to 450 next year?
[00:47:42] Yeah.
[00:47:43] They were paying 20X revenue at the end of next year.
[00:47:46] Keith Rabois: So we're paying a year ahead.
[00:47:47] Keith Rabois: We're paying a year ahead if it triples next year.
[00:47:48] Keith Rabois: If they can peg the growth, we're saying,
[00:47:50] Roelof Botha: we're all saying the same thing.
[00:47:52] Roelof Botha: If the growth stays the same at 3X even,
[00:47:56] Roelof Botha: then you earn your way out very quickly.
[00:47:58] Roelof Botha: If it declines even to 2X, which is still amazing growth,
[00:48:01] Roelof Botha: then you could be a little ahead of yourself here.
[00:48:03] Roelof Botha: That's what we're saying.
[00:48:04] Roelof Botha: It's as simple as that, right?
[00:48:05] Roelof Botha: And I go back to I think, I mean,
[00:48:07] Roelof Botha: we published on this like 10, 15 years ago.
[00:48:09] Roelof Botha: In SAS, you could use this following rule of thumb
[00:48:12] Roelof Botha: with a high degree of accuracy.
[00:48:13] Roelof Botha: The growth rate for any year was roughly 85% of the
[00:48:17] Roelof Botha: prior years growth.
[00:48:18] Roelof Botha: So if it's growing at 100, we probably go at 85.
[00:48:20] Roelof Botha: If it's growing at 85, it probably go in the high 60s.
[00:48:23] Roelof Botha: And you're just roughly a thumb, it was roughly right.
[00:48:26] Roelof Botha: The thing here is, instead of saying that
[00:48:28] Roelof Botha: best in class 3X growth, you're seeing best in class 10X growth.
[00:48:32] Roelof Botha: As I say, if that only declines slowly,
[00:48:34] Roelof Botha: if it goes 10X to 6X to 3X,
[00:48:37] Roelof Botha: these are amazing companies and any price can be paid.
[00:48:40] Roelof Botha: If it goes 10X to 3X to 2X, then good prices can be paid,
[00:48:44] Roelof Botha: but you could get ahead of yourself.
[00:48:46] Roelof Botha: And if it ever slows down to sub 100% growth before you hit
[00:48:50] Roelof Botha: just like if any of these things go down,
[00:48:52] Roelof Botha: then you just weigh wrong.
[00:48:53] Roelof Botha: Which is why you do and that it is possible to step back.
[00:48:58] Roelof Botha: It is possible to lose money on a great company.
[00:49:02] Roelof Botha: That's the only, because it's the only risk you're running
[00:49:04] Roelof Botha: when you're paying 8 billion, right?
[00:49:05] Roelof Botha: There's not going to be a risk that Harvey's not one
[00:49:07] Roelof Botha: of the greatest companies.
[00:49:08] Roelof Botha: It's a given.
[00:49:09] Roelof Botha: It's clearly the biggest risk.
[00:49:11] Roelof Botha: There's only one risk you're running.
[00:49:12] Roelof Botha: It's about to where we started actually about price.
[00:49:14] Roelof Botha: You have no operational risk, you have no business market risk,
[00:49:17] Roelof Botha: you have no time risk.
[00:49:18] Roelof Botha: The only risk you're running is you're paying 8 for something
[00:49:21] Roelof Botha: that might be worth 4, and if it's worth 4, you're wrong, right?
[00:49:23] Roelof Botha: So you can be wrong on price.
[00:49:25] Roelof Botha: So far no one has been in AI.
[00:49:27] Roelof Botha: The stuff that's worked has been marked up and marked up again.
[00:49:31] Roelof Botha: And right now that's the right bet to take.
[00:49:33] Roelof Botha: So Jason, to your point, you go back to the short front
[00:49:35] Roelof Botha: of what you're saying is it has been the right bet to take so far.
[00:49:39] It could turn.
[00:49:40] Roelof Botha: And if it does, you'll be, you ever know, be over there skis.
[00:49:42] Roelof Botha: But so far as you say, the person who was agonizing
[00:49:45] Roelof Botha: about his $3 billion bet and biting his nails at the start of the year
[00:49:49] Roelof Botha: is like, oh my god, I'm so smart.
[00:49:50] Roelof Botha: I'm so smart.
[00:49:51] Roelof Botha: I have a two and a half X and you know, six months, right?
[00:49:54] Roelof Botha: Because the momentum kept coming.
[00:49:56] Roelof Botha: I think Harry's though got an important point going back to 2021.
[00:50:00] Keith Rabois: I think in 2021 we kind of reached peak of people paying three years
[00:50:03] Keith Rabois: ahead, right?
[00:50:04] Keith Rabois: In terms of multiples.
[00:50:05] Keith Rabois: Maybe we're back to that.
[00:50:06] Keith Rabois: Maybe and that would be logical, right?
[00:50:08] Keith Rabois: Maybe three years ahead is the limit of EC can do even with the most
[00:50:12] Keith Rabois: optimist.
[00:50:13] Keith Rabois: You got to have, it has to tie to something when you put together the investment
[00:50:17] Keith Rabois: memo, right?
[00:50:18] Keith Rabois: And in the old days, it was one X like box and other is when Rory was there.
[00:50:22] Keith Rabois: Their growth rounds were often at a modest discount, right?
[00:50:24] Keith Rabois: You weren't paying years ahead.
[00:50:25] Keith Rabois: You were actually paying a discount.
[00:50:27] Keith Rabois: And I think it peaked around three years ahead, right?
[00:50:30] Keith Rabois: The classic 100 X ARRs in 2021 were really three years ahead.
[00:50:33] Keith Rabois: Between two and three years ahead.
[00:50:35] Keith Rabois: Yes, and that's why.
[00:50:36] Keith Rabois: So if Harry's asking is that crazy, time will tell, like it might be, it might be PKI bubble
[00:50:43] Keith Rabois: at least.
[00:50:44] Roelof Botha: It was crazy in 2021 because two bad things happen, not one but two, right?
[00:50:49] Roelof Botha: One is you had a recession.
[00:50:52] Roelof Botha: And then on top of that, a lot of those companies became functionally obsolete in terms of where
[00:50:56] Roelof Botha: the excitement was with Chatchee PT.
[00:50:58] Roelof Botha: So that's so paying up in 2020 was a horrible decision.
[00:51:02] Roelof Botha: I do believe in this case, the big advantage you have is, as I say, I think that the direction
[00:51:07] Roelof Botha: of travel is pretty clear here.
[00:51:09] Roelof Botha: I don't think we'll wake up in two years and go, oh my God, we're not using AI for legal.
[00:51:13] Roelof Botha: But that's not a thing.
[00:51:15] Roelof Botha: So you can see why people are leaning in, which is why I go back to my common, you know,
[00:51:19] Roelof Botha: the only remaining risk is some kind of time and competitive dynamics.
[00:51:24] Roelof Botha: Can you get enough of that market and is big enough?
[00:51:26] Roelof Botha: And if you can, you can, if it is, if, which is why the leaders are getting this premium
[00:51:31] Roelof Botha: because you can just say, I'm going to be the leader.
[00:51:33] Roelof Botha: It might take time, but it's a big time.
[00:51:35] Roelof Botha: I got it.
[00:51:36] Roelof Botha: Yeah, it might be we're underestimating a risk that a lot of apps can be jasperd.
[00:51:42] Wait, we might be underestimating.
[00:51:44] Keith Rabois: There might be a GPT 6, 7 and THROPIC 5 risk where we thought we had to stable place in AI.
[00:51:51] Keith Rabois: So of course, Harvey and others are going to win, right?
[00:51:53] Keith Rabois: Because they control the customer, they can swap LLMs out.
[00:51:56] Keith Rabois: But the jasper's of the world and multiple others thought they had winners.
[00:52:00] Keith Rabois: And then AI changed and then they became a very limited value.
[00:52:04] Keith Rabois: So I think there, I don't, I'm not smart enough to know, but I, I don't think we should
[00:52:08] Keith Rabois: assume AI is stable.
[00:52:09] Keith Rabois: And I think that's why there's a code right at open AI because Sam said it's not stable.
[00:52:14] Roelof Botha: And I think I actually saw a good piece.
[00:52:16] Roelof Botha: I, I kind of am the gentleman's name.
[00:52:18] Roelof Botha: And it was very skeptic about most software apps companies in the age of I, his comment was
[00:52:23] Roelof Botha: models will do most.
[00:52:24] Roelof Botha: So you either help make the models, which is, you know, building the AI, or you have to do
[00:52:29] Roelof Botha: very different apps that were only possible in the age of AI.
[00:52:32] Roelof Botha: But the common he was making is exactly that, which is whenever you do an AI app, one
[00:52:37] Roelof Botha: of the nonnegotiable disciplines before you do it is you should go and try and use the
[00:52:43] Roelof Botha: core models to do the same thing.
[00:52:44] Roelof Botha: And you should try and build a functional version of that as simply as, as you can.
[00:52:49] Roelof Botha: And if you can yet even vaguely close to it, you need to pause because I don't think,
[00:52:52] Roelof Botha: I don't think, I don't for what it's worth.
[00:52:53] Roelof Botha: I don't think every app goes away.
[00:52:55] Roelof Botha: I don't think someone wants to maintain their own self force.
[00:52:58] Roelof Botha: But I do think Jason, you write one of the annoying risks in all these investments is,
[00:53:03] Roelof Botha: you know, just model improvement.
[00:53:05] Roelof Botha: I mean, we're seeing it in coding where the models are clearly trying to eat the apps.
[00:53:10] Roelof Botha: Yeah, just there could be, I'll give you an example, I mean, Repplet, Repplet was around
[00:53:13] Keith Rabois: for eight years before Cloud for me to work.
[00:53:15] Keith Rabois: Gamma was around for four years before it worked.
[00:53:18] Keith Rabois: We feel like there's a stable plane, but it could be that as AI evolves, as we're able
[00:53:25] Keith Rabois: to do incredibly complex long context windows deep reasoning in seconds instead of 15 minutes,
[00:53:32] Keith Rabois: I could imagine a new generation of founders develop legal software, other software that
[00:53:37] Keith Rabois: takes advantage of deep thinking and milliseconds, which seems impossible to say.
[00:53:41] Keith Rabois: And all of a sudden, we don't need, I don't want to wait forever for these slow analyses.
[00:53:44] Keith Rabois: Like, all of a sudden, it works like magic again, like it's an order of magnitude better.
[00:53:49] Keith Rabois: And all of these apps, we could say, oh, they'll, they'll just rotate out their LMS,
[00:53:53] Keith Rabois: but it might not be that simple.
[00:53:54] Keith Rabois: At least could all become obsolete in an area of infinite deep reasoning.
[00:53:57] Keith Rabois: They could, I think there's such a good back to our discussion about Sierra's implementation
[00:54:01] Jason Calacanis: within enterprise, which I've seen with Solve, which is like a lot of the defensibility
[00:54:05] Jason Calacanis: the mode, the skill is in the GTM and the implementation.
[00:54:08] Jason Calacanis: And so I don't think it's just quite as simple as like, oh, well, like a new model will
[00:54:12] Jason Calacanis: happen.
[00:54:13] Jason Calacanis: I think that's like a really respectfully civic and valley view.
[00:54:16] Jason Calacanis: No, but see it, no, I disagree.
[00:54:18] Keith Rabois: I think that if you could take a Sierra example with like Macy's or wherever the else
[00:54:22] Keith Rabois: the customer says, if you could ingest all their data, do massive deep reasoning with
[00:54:26] Keith Rabois: a different model and solve customer problems in milliseconds, none of these products work
[00:54:31] Keith Rabois: in milliseconds.
[00:54:32] Keith Rabois: And they all still have, have some set of issues around them, right?
[00:54:36] Keith Rabois: A step people would, would immediately move to a vendor that could be 10 times better
[00:54:40] Keith Rabois: than all of them.
[00:54:41] Keith Rabois: Sierra Finchman, Dinwin, they're, they are 10 times better than what we had two years
[00:54:45] Keith Rabois: ago.
[00:54:46] Keith Rabois: I could, if you've used these products in the field, you can see on the one hand, they're
[00:54:50] Keith Rabois: amazing.
[00:54:51] Keith Rabois: On the other hand, they are slow.
[00:54:53] Keith Rabois: Okay.
[00:54:54] Keith Rabois: On the other hand, they are complicated to set up and ingest data.
[00:54:57] Keith Rabois: On the other hand, hallucinations are a minor issue, but they're not a non-issue.
[00:55:01] Keith Rabois: They're not a non-issue, especially when the answer has to be correct.
[00:55:04] Keith Rabois: So I'm just like, if, as investors, we have to imagine a world where that all goes away
[00:55:09] Keith Rabois: in the next two years.
[00:55:10] Keith Rabois: Okay.
[00:55:11] Keith Rabois: And it's not stable.
[00:55:12] Keith Rabois: And all of our investments could go to zero.
[00:55:14] Keith Rabois: I'm pushing back when you're saying Wilson.
[00:55:18] Jason Calacanis: Well, I'm saying Wilson's in Cinecule, the biggest law firms in the world, have all
[00:55:22] Jason Calacanis: been piloting and building relationships, building implementation pathways, integrating them
[00:55:27] Jason Calacanis: into their workflows for the last year.
[00:55:29] Jason Calacanis: And just because anthropic comes out with a new model that is 3 to 5% better.
[00:55:33] Jason Calacanis: You're not listening to me.
[00:55:35] Keith Rabois: I'm not saying 3 to 5% better.
[00:55:37] Keith Rabois: I'm talking about a step function.
[00:55:39] Keith Rabois: Can we show what we're coming?
[00:55:40] Keith Rabois: How much time do you spend coding with deep reasoning?
[00:55:43] Keith Rabois: How much time?
[00:55:44] Keith Rabois: We benefit from that.
[00:55:45] Keith Rabois: No, you don't, you don't even know what you're talking about here, Harry.
[00:55:47] Keith Rabois: I know what I'm talking about.
[00:55:48] Keith Rabois: You can be crazy.
[00:55:49] Keith Rabois: You can be crazy.
[00:55:50] Keith Rabois: You have to be crazy.
[00:55:51] Keith Rabois: You have to be a critic VC argument that you think because Wilson's in the invested in
[00:55:55] Keith Rabois: Harvey, they're not going to switch in five years.
[00:55:58] Keith Rabois: Oh, shit.
[00:55:59] Jason Calacanis: We sit on top of them.
[00:56:00] Jason Calacanis: Harvey sits on top of it.
[00:56:01] Jason Calacanis: It benefits from it, getting better.
[00:56:04] Jason Calacanis: Okay.
[00:56:05] Jason Calacanis: That is a, like, I, literally today, I'll tell you today, for example, this is not even
[00:56:11] Keith Rabois: what I'm talking about about deep reasoning, right?
[00:56:13] Keith Rabois: But literally today, Repplet change, I don't, don't over talk about Repplet.
[00:56:16] Keith Rabois: I just spend so much time in it, okay?
[00:56:19] Keith Rabois: Now with Repplet, you don't pick your model anymore.
[00:56:20] Keith Rabois: It's all dynamic.
[00:56:22] Roelof Botha: Yeah.
[00:56:23] Keith Rabois: It's all gone.
[00:56:24] Keith Rabois: You don't pick a lock, you don't pick high reasoning, you don't pick short reasoning,
[00:56:27] Keith Rabois: you don't pick anything.
[00:56:28] Keith Rabois: It just, and it rotates Google and others.
[00:56:31] Keith Rabois: That's, I mean, in a way that plays your point, but it's so much change.
[00:56:35] Keith Rabois: It's so much change.
[00:56:36] Keith Rabois: You're right.
[00:56:37] Keith Rabois: But I don't, I don't think you use the deep reasoning enough, I mean, 15 minutes, 10 minutes
[00:56:41] Keith Rabois: to get an answer.
[00:56:43] Keith Rabois: Or I'll tell you, we can, let's find a C.R. implementation because I've tried with
[00:56:46] Keith Rabois: Jack and God and all the rest, they make plenty of mistakes today.
[00:56:49] Keith Rabois: So does Finn and these are great products.
[00:56:51] Keith Rabois: But they don't, they're not 100% right, they're like 90% right.
[00:56:54] Keith Rabois: I do believe that the, the, the main focus, the workflows, the customer commands give you
[00:57:01] Roelof Botha: some kind of lock in.
[00:57:03] Roelof Botha: And if the models move slowly, are you stay on top of them, I think the apps companies
[00:57:07] Roelof Botha: should be fine.
[00:57:09] Roelof Botha: But I do think it's fair.
[00:57:10] Roelof Botha: If you snooze, if you're like, if either the, like, I can imagine, if instead of the
[00:57:14] Roelof Botha: next generation of either a topic or open AI being another incremental turn of the
[00:57:19] Roelof Botha: crime, there was some kind of reasoning step function, which I'm not holding my bread
[00:57:22] Roelof Botha: for, by the way, but some reasoning step function or AGI step function, I can't even
[00:57:26] Roelof Botha: say that without snickering, but you, you could imagine another turn of the crank that made
[00:57:31] Roelof Botha: everything you've done so far, be not the way you do it anymore.
[00:57:34] Roelof Botha: Right.
[00:57:35] Roelof Botha: And as long as that risk is there, at the bare minimum, I mean, what I would say, I haven't
[00:57:40] Roelof Botha: seen any of my companies at the apps level, totally go, oh my God, we used to do this
[00:57:45] Roelof Botha: now.
[00:57:46] Roelof Botha: We don't.
[00:57:47] Roelof Botha: They haven't been to use your phrase, Jasper, right?
[00:57:48] Roelof Botha: But I have seen a lot of them have to wrestle with the offering quite significantly because
[00:57:53] Roelof Botha: some things you thought you could do on economic and then other things that you couldn't do
[00:57:58] Roelof Botha: six months ago, and now we're more compelling.
[00:58:00] Roelof Botha: And what I would say is I tell people, I used to, yeah, as a product market fit, is a rolling
[00:58:05] Roelof Botha: feast at the moment, right?
[00:58:07] Roelof Botha: And it's a moving target, right?
[00:58:08] Roelof Botha: And which is why if you look at all your good apps companies, one of the things you see
[00:58:14] Roelof Botha: is when the new model comes out, they're on at that afternoon, you know, it's pizzas
[00:58:18] Roelof Botha: and late at night and you got to know what's in the box, put it down quickly, right?
[00:58:22] Roelof Botha: Because until this pace normalizes, you can be displaced.
[00:58:27] I guess here's my point.
[00:58:28] Keith Rabois: We'll just see.
[00:58:29] Keith Rabois: I'm just talking about for B to B apps, I don't think, sorry, here, maybe I wasn't being
[00:58:33] Keith Rabois: clear I was making two seemingly conflicting points or making two points at the same time.
[00:58:38] Keith Rabois: I think we haven't even begun to see deep reasoning in B to B apps.
[00:58:41] Keith Rabois: We haven't even started.
[00:58:42] Keith Rabois: We haven't even started.
[00:58:44] Keith Rabois: We are doing relatively simple prompts that can get answers back in a second or two or
[00:58:48] Keith Rabois: less, okay?
[00:58:49] Keith Rabois: You can't wait five minutes for Sierra or Decagon or Finn to give you an answer.
[00:58:53] Keith Rabois: No one's going to wait five minutes for that answer, okay?
[00:58:56] Keith Rabois: And this is part of the code red at OpenAI is they want to move away from reasoning.
[00:59:02] Keith Rabois: But I think when that goes from five minutes to five seconds or better yet, a second,
[00:59:08] Keith Rabois: just like we thought Jasper was amazing, we haven't even begun to imagine what B to
[00:59:13] Keith Rabois: B will do with AI when it can do deep reasoning in a second.
[00:59:16] Keith Rabois: It's just not accessible to B to B apps.
[00:59:19] Keith Rabois: We just can't wait five minutes for Finn to tell us an answer.
[00:59:22] Keith Rabois: I think we just can't wait.
[00:59:24] Keith Rabois: We don't got that time.
[00:59:25] Keith Rabois: I need to find out what happened with my sweater.
[00:59:27] Keith Rabois: It's what I find so funny when people compare the out-of-the-out market to the cloud market.
[00:59:31] Jason Calacanis: Because the thing that you don't have in the cloud market is the promiscuity that you
[00:59:35] Jason Calacanis: do in the LILM market.
[00:59:37] Jason Calacanis: I've spoken to two companies today and they're like the upgrades in Anthropic recently have
[00:59:43] Jason Calacanis: meant full shift to Anthropic away from OpenAI and improvements in our product that we
[00:59:48] Jason Calacanis: really didn't expect, which is amazing.
[00:59:50] Jason Calacanis: We're so grateful to Anthropic.
[00:59:52] Jason Calacanis: But this real shift overnight for them.
[00:59:54] Jason Calacanis: Agreed.
[00:59:55] Roelof Botha: Actually, that segues to clearly you've not capable of keeping us on track anymore,
[01:00:00] Roelof Botha: Harry.
[01:00:01] Roelof Botha: I'll just cover the agenda from my side.
[01:00:03] Roelof Botha: You were going to ask us about the Benioff comment on LILM's being a commodity, which is exactly
[01:00:08] Roelof Botha: where you're going here.
[01:00:09] Roelof Botha: It's a super interesting comment.
[01:00:12] Roelof Botha: Let's start with the point you made.
[01:00:13] Roelof Botha: Yes, I've been struggling to find, because you always try and think an analogy as an investor.
[01:00:18] Roelof Botha: How sticky, slash commoditized, slash profitable, all of these are related terms, but not the
[01:00:25] Roelof Botha: same are the models.
[01:00:26] Roelof Botha: Anyway, you start with the basic comment.
[01:00:29] Roelof Botha: In Cloudland, there was an oligopoly of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, but you couldn't
[01:00:34] Roelof Botha: easily switch between people, not at least, about how I want to be multi-cloud, but no
[01:00:40] Roelof Botha: one's really multi-cloud.
[01:00:42] Roelof Botha: Many of my companies moved from Cloud-A to Cloud-B.
[01:00:44] Roelof Botha: It's two years.
[01:00:45] Roelof Botha: It's millions of dollars.
[01:00:46] Roelof Botha: It's a penalty ass.
[01:00:47] Roelof Botha: Here you're right.
[01:00:48] Roelof Botha: The three, these are APIs.
[01:00:50] Roelof Botha: And most companies have multiple providers on the same system and switch between them.
[01:00:57] Roelof Botha: In fact, Sierra did an interesting piece on how a lot of their application is a constellation
[01:01:03] Roelof Botha: of models.
[01:01:04] Roelof Botha: In real time, you're always looking at multiple things.
[01:01:06] Roelof Botha: You're right.
[01:01:07] Roelof Botha: It's way more fluid in terms of your ability to shift between than anything you've seen
[01:01:13] Roelof Botha: before.
[01:01:15] I do think that's true.
[01:01:17] Roelof Botha: The question is, what does that mean?
[01:01:19] Keith Rabois: Of course, Mark's right.
[01:01:20] Keith Rabois: Mark, just like Repplet today, can auto-rotate models without you knowing it.
[01:01:24] Keith Rabois: Salesforce is and should be doing the same thing.
[01:01:26] Keith Rabois: They have their own LLMs as they talked about.
[01:01:28] Keith Rabois: That's great today.
[01:01:29] Keith Rabois: I think it's an interesting topic for 2026.
[01:01:32] Keith Rabois: Just going back, not to push, but we use Asian for ourselves.
[01:01:36] Keith Rabois: It is great.
[01:01:37] Keith Rabois: I can talk to you how it really works.
[01:01:39] Keith Rabois: It takes about 30 days to train and deploy, and then you've got to keep going and upgrade.
[01:01:43] Keith Rabois: It's great.
[01:01:44] Keith Rabois: It works just as well as the other agents.
[01:01:46] Keith Rabois: One way it works better than all the rest.
[01:01:48] Keith Rabois: Just one way, and it's captain obvious, it is native to Salesforce data.
[01:01:52] Keith Rabois: It actually works better than all their other agents in Salesforce.
[01:01:56] Keith Rabois: We can show you that I can bring it.
[01:01:57] Keith Rabois: It's great.
[01:01:58] Keith Rabois: It's going to be a multi-billion dollar business, note note.
[01:02:02] Keith Rabois: But imagine when instead of taking a month to train, and a couple of other months to iterate,
[01:02:08] Keith Rabois: it can happen in minutes.
[01:02:09] Keith Rabois: This will be nothing like the AI we have today.
[01:02:12] Keith Rabois: We're just starting.
[01:02:14] Keith Rabois: Not only will that make Salesforce a better company, probably, it may disrupt all these
[01:02:18] Keith Rabois: incumbents when all of this can be done instantly.
[01:02:21] Keith Rabois: When the Harvey that we used in 2025 seems just quaint in two years.
[01:02:26] Keith Rabois: What a joke that we had to spend all this time training it and justing it and all the mistakes
[01:02:29] Keith Rabois: it made and the associates.
[01:02:31] Keith Rabois: I don't know.
[01:02:32] Keith Rabois: I think it's very exciting, but I think it makes our investments even less stable.
[01:02:36] Keith Rabois: We've just, this is going to change.
[01:02:39] Keith Rabois: It's going to be very exciting to go from month to training agent to minutes to minutes.
[01:02:45] Keith Rabois: It's going to come.
[01:02:46] Roelof Botha: I think the interesting question on this from the Mark comment was there was an implication
[01:02:50] Roelof Botha: there that because they're quote, swappable, which is true, that the LLMs themselves are
[01:02:57] Roelof Botha: bad businesses.
[01:02:59] That was the implies.
[01:03:00] Roelof Botha: That was the diss.
[01:03:01] Roelof Botha: That was the diss.
[01:03:02] Roelof Botha: I read that as the implies statement.
[01:03:04] Roelof Botha: And it's interesting to say why that's not the case.
[01:03:06] Roelof Botha: Because I don't think it is.
[01:03:09] And I think Mark actually used the analogy of it's like hard disk drives.
[01:03:15] Roelof Botha: And if you eat Clayton questions and it's the prototypical example of a widely competitive
[01:03:19] Roelof Botha: commoditized market where there were 30 providers.
[01:03:23] Roelof Botha: I think the analogy breaks down because if you look what happened in the hard disk market,
[01:03:27] Roelof Botha: capitalism works.
[01:03:29] Roelof Botha: If you have 30 commodity providers and you don't ingest anti-chose 27 on go bust and you
[01:03:36] Roelof Botha: end up with two or three providers, the survivors, and that's what it takes so they can extract
[01:03:41] Roelof Botha: enough profits to survive.
[01:03:43] Roelof Botha: Not 30 people don't get to make it.
[01:03:45] Roelof Botha: And I think so.
[01:03:46] Roelof Botha: If you look at the hard disk market, it was a commodity.
[01:03:49] Roelof Botha: It was a brutally competitive for a while.
[01:03:52] Roelof Botha: It remained a commodity even after it consolidated to three, but they were able to extract enough
[01:03:58] Roelof Botha: profits from it.
[01:04:00] Roelof Botha: Right.
[01:04:01] Roelof Botha: So the implicate.
[01:04:02] Roelof Botha: So I think Mark said, oh my god, this is a commodity market like the hard disk.
[01:04:06] Roelof Botha: It might be true at the start, but there's an embedded common there that isn't true.
[01:04:10] Roelof Botha: I think it's totally plausible that even though there is a fair degree of switching possible
[01:04:18] Roelof Botha: between models, you still will evolve to an industry structure where those model companies
[01:04:24] Roelof Botha: make decent money.
[01:04:25] Roelof Botha: Actually, no smith at a good piece on this, even though he was negative on the common,
[01:04:29] Roelof Botha: but he made a comment, it's a little like, the model companies could be a little like
[01:04:32] Roelof Botha: the airlines.
[01:04:34] Roelof Botha: Super high fixed cost.
[01:04:36] Roelof Botha: Easy to switch.
[01:04:37] Roelof Botha: Right.
[01:04:38] Roelof Botha: And his implied cameras, that's a bad business.
[01:04:40] Roelof Botha: It's not an awful business if you consolidate.
[01:04:44] Roelof Botha: I mean, if the anti-trust people would let them, we'd only have united in San Francisco
[01:04:49] Roelof Botha: and then they just charge through the nose.
[01:04:51] Roelof Botha: So I think you would see consolidation.
[01:04:53] Roelof Botha: How do you think about the volatility of revenues that's inherent in a business where the
[01:04:57] Jason Calacanis: quality derived so much of the switching, so like anthropic, will have suddenly mass
[01:05:03] Jason Calacanis: usage that will drive revenues and then others will lose it very quickly.
[01:05:07] Jason Calacanis: If you're going to be surviving business, you can't live like that in the long term.
[01:05:10] Roelof Botha: It's just too hard.
[01:05:11] Roelof Botha: So the economic, microeconomics will make it happen.
[01:05:16] Roelof Botha: I think it's probably two things.
[01:05:18] Roelof Botha: One is, as the cost enter gets higher, the fixed cost barriers, does not, I don't know
[01:05:23] Roelof Botha: if there's going to be ten of these.
[01:05:25] Roelof Botha: There might be three or four, but I doubt there'll be ten, right?
[01:05:28] Roelof Botha: If it really does cost a lot to make these.
[01:05:30] Roelof Botha: If it doesn't cost a lot to make these models, then you might all bet so off.
[01:05:34] Roelof Botha: That's one way.
[01:05:35] Roelof Botha: And then obviously the second way, and you're seeing it right now, is you say, hey, if
[01:05:39] Roelof Botha: at the API level, I'm a commodity and there's me, OpenAI and Gemini and the Swap in between
[01:05:45] Roelof Botha: us, I have got to grab the apps.
[01:05:48] Roelof Botha: And that's what you're seeing.
[01:05:49] Roelof Botha: I mean, anthropic is grabbing the corning app and obviously OpenAI is grabbing the
[01:05:55] Roelof Botha: Chachypt consumer app, right?
[01:05:57] Roelof Botha: Because you're basically saying, I can't be sitting at the back here and getting swapped
[01:06:02] Roelof Botha: out by some rotational round raven on AI.
[01:06:06] Roelof Botha: I got to own the end user here, right?
[01:06:11] Roelof Botha: So those are two things.
[01:06:12] Roelof Botha: So I think Mark is right about the...
[01:06:14] Jason Calacanis: I don't see the volatility of revenue on the consumer side because you have memory.
[01:06:18] Jason Calacanis: And I think now, I don't know about you guys, but I'm seeing this so much in the other
[01:06:21] Jason Calacanis: forums that I'm using where memory drives so much of the actual end product that I get.
[01:06:25] Jason Calacanis: And that's incredibly sticky and we'll drive a lot of value.
[01:06:28] Jason Calacanis: But on the B2B side where you can have our companies on the B2B switching so easily,
[01:06:33] Jason Calacanis: there isn't that stickiness.
[01:06:34] Jason Calacanis: Well, just two thoughts on the B2B side, we talk about a couple of LMS, but like so many
[01:06:42] Keith Rabois: of the high companies use their own LMS and their Chinese models, cursor zone model, Chinese
[01:06:47] Keith Rabois: model, wind surf.
[01:06:48] Keith Rabois: So like all of our portfolio companies that are using their own LMS, they're not really
[01:06:52] Keith Rabois: using their own LMS, they're using cheap open source or if they could, they would use
[01:06:57] Keith Rabois: Chinese hosted models and sometimes they do because they're a fraction of the cost.
[01:07:00] Keith Rabois: So this is...
[01:07:02] Keith Rabois: We're exactly this all goes, we don't know, but all of these startups that have their own
[01:07:07] Keith Rabois: model, they're Chinese open source models.
[01:07:10] Keith Rabois: They all are including cursor, right?
[01:07:11] Keith Rabois: So there's a whole nother group that is competitive that because they're not raising
[01:07:16] Keith Rabois: massive venture capital and maybe they're inferior in some ways, but if cursor is using
[01:07:19] Keith Rabois: its own model, 30 to 40% of the time, it's not that inferior because cursor is doing pretty
[01:07:24] Keith Rabois: good, right?
[01:07:25] Keith Rabois: So comment number one, Chinese models are already being used by our hot startups.
[01:07:29] Keith Rabois: It is a real threat.
[01:07:30] Keith Rabois: I did number two, you think memory is a mode and permanent and it absolutely is, but
[01:07:38] Keith Rabois: I think why Sam called the code red is imagine today, imagine today when we're doing this,
[01:07:44] Keith Rabois: if chatGPD1 away tomorrow, okay, here's what's changed, Google AI mode's pretty good.
[01:07:50] Keith Rabois: Now it's not going to be our therapist, it's not going to have as much memory, but AI
[01:07:56] Keith Rabois: mode's pretty good, the Google stack's pretty good and if open AI for some reason, just chat
[01:08:01] Keith Rabois: GPD1 away tomorrow, we would survive.
[01:08:04] Keith Rabois: We would survive, we would complain, we would, you know, Keith would have some good comments,
[01:08:08] Keith Rabois: you'd have some comments that Twitter would explode and in a week, we'd be like whatever,
[01:08:13] Keith Rabois: we've moved on, some folks would go to clawed even though we've forgotten about clawed,
[01:08:16] Keith Rabois: but Google's pretty good.
[01:08:18] Keith Rabois: This is why I think Sam called the code red because to open AI is a consumer company and
[01:08:22] Keith Rabois: even said, listen, we're going to do even more on chatGPD, we're going to do less on apps,
[01:08:26] Keith Rabois: we're going to do less on imaging and video, we got to make it good because we would,
[01:08:32] Keith Rabois: we would need a tough spot for a while if Anthropic went away because all our apps wouldn't
[01:08:35] Keith Rabois: work, that would suck, but if chatGPD1 away tomorrow, we'd be fine in a couple days.
[01:08:40] Keith Rabois: We'd lose a little memory, we'd have to rebuild it in Google, but we use Google every
[01:08:43] Keith Rabois: day would not be the end of the world.
[01:08:45] Keith Rabois: I don't know if I buy that.
[01:08:46] Roelof Botha: I mean, yeah, it's not the end of the world because nothing is the end of the world unless
[01:08:49] Keith Rabois: it's the end of the world.
[01:08:50] Roelof Botha: Be worse to lose Netflix.
[01:08:52] Keith Rabois: That has more proprietary use cases than chatGPD.
[01:08:55] Keith Rabois: That's a more interesting comment actually, genuinely, it's like 20 months, it's not true,
[01:09:01] Jason Calacanis: but you could apply that to all of them, including Anthropic.
[01:09:04] Jason Calacanis: I'm genuinely asking you Jason, you're the code of hair and I admit to you on this one,
[01:09:08] Jason Calacanis: you could switch on throw pick out and it would get like a 90% efficiency on all the
[01:09:13] Jason Calacanis: models.
[01:09:14] Jason Calacanis: Netflix, I would just be right.
[01:09:15] Jason Calacanis: Well, there aren't that many.
[01:09:17] Keith Rabois: I do think, look, Anthropic is more enterprise.
[01:09:21] Keith Rabois: In my experience, it is stickier because of that.
[01:09:24] Keith Rabois: There's more work than just moving in a day.
[01:09:27] Keith Rabois: That's why I slightly challenge your point that you're saying consumer was stickier.
[01:09:30] Keith Rabois: I do think memory is a big deal, right?
[01:09:32] Keith Rabois: It's getting really, really, really good at the edge of creepy, but we would just be like
[01:09:37] Keith Rabois: a TV show, we would just shrug and we would just switch the next day.
[01:09:40] Keith Rabois: Life would, the greatest consumer app of all time so far, we'd be fine.
[01:09:46] Keith Rabois: Put me down for now without our stranger things.
[01:09:48] Roelof Botha: I think we would, look, obviously we would get on with life because we three years ago,
[01:09:52] Roelof Botha: apparently we were without this and we were fine, but I think it would leave a significant
[01:09:56] Roelof Botha: gap.
[01:09:57] Roelof Botha: I think, there's no doubt that it's a superior product and you'd miss it.
[01:10:01] Roelof Botha: So I disagree.
[01:10:02] Roelof Botha: I think that, like, let's put the test you do is this.
[01:10:06] Roelof Botha: When we're looking at consumer hardware once, one of my colleagues, give me a mental
[01:10:09] Roelof Botha: test that I actually think was one of the most insightful things I heard about consumer
[01:10:13] Roelof Botha: products ever.
[01:10:15] Roelof Botha: He said, the only test you need to run than this one is this.
[01:10:17] Roelof Botha: If you lost it today, would you go out and buy another one tomorrow morning?
[01:10:22] Roelof Botha: And it's actually, like, if you lose your phone, you instantly go out and get one in the
[01:10:26] Roelof Botha: morning, right?
[01:10:27] Roelof Botha: If I lost our coffee maker at home, I would be down to solar table in an hour, right?
[01:10:33] Roelof Botha: Then there's a lot of things where you go, yeah, I would I take a week, I might get around
[01:10:37] Roelof Botha: to it.
[01:10:38] Roelof Botha: Maybe I wouldn't bother, right?
[01:10:39] Roelof Botha: And it's just a really good test.
[01:10:40] Roelof Botha: And I think in that, using that test for Chachy PT, I think if I lost Chachy PT now,
[01:10:44] Roelof Botha: I'd be like, I gotta go find something and I don't think German has quite there.
[01:10:48] Roelof Botha: So I think it would leave a void, which I think is speaks to their strength because it's,
[01:10:52] Roelof Botha: maybe it's not a, I would die void, but it's 800 million people who will use it.
[01:10:56] Roelof Botha: So I think there's a lot of gravity in those individual consumer users and the habit involved.
[01:11:03] Roelof Botha: I think it's the biggest asset.
[01:11:04] Roelof Botha: But it could be just as sticky as Yahoo!
[01:11:06] Keith Rabois: We survived and moved to Gmail.
[01:11:07] Keith Rabois: It was okay.
[01:11:08] Keith Rabois: It was, but it took a sustained five years of under execution by Yahoo to get that done,
[01:11:13] Roelof Botha: right?
[01:11:15] Roelof Botha: And I think, and I think the Yahoo!
[01:11:17] Roelof Botha: Mail and Gmail were more similar.
[01:11:18] Roelof Botha: I would argue even today, despite all the progress in Germany, I, the Chachy PT experience,
[01:11:23] Roelof Botha: I think is still better controversial take perhaps.
[01:11:26] Roelof Botha: Well, play on it some more.
[01:11:28] Keith Rabois: Let's talk about it in January.
[01:11:29] Keith Rabois: I think you're going to come around to my position that it's, to those are just the same
[01:11:32] Keith Rabois: one that Sam has, which is pretty good now.
[01:11:34] Keith Rabois: I don't think it's going to, I don't think it's going to stop OpenAI's future, but it is,
[01:11:40] Keith Rabois: it is, it is, it is, everything's just unstable, including, including the, including Harvey, I think.
[01:11:46] Keith Rabois: I think what you're seeing with OpenAI is the awareness that they've been massively diversified
[01:11:51] Jason Calacanis: way too much.
[01:11:52] Jason Calacanis: They need to consolidate.
[01:11:53] Jason Calacanis: They need to concentrate.
[01:11:54] Jason Calacanis: They are absolutely aware that they have fumbled all over the last 12 months and they need to massively
[01:11:59] Jason Calacanis: reduce the portfolio products that they have.
[01:12:01] Jason Calacanis: There's a focus on healthcare, there's a focus on codex, and there's a focus on, obviously,
[01:12:06] Jason Calacanis: the consumer products.
[01:12:07] Jason Calacanis: And that is the BFD for them.
[01:12:09] Jason Calacanis: And I think Brad feels the pressure.
[01:12:12] Jason Calacanis: I think Sam feels the pressure and it's game time.
[01:12:15] Jason Calacanis: I just think the way markets work is there's this formative period where there's a lot of
[01:12:19] Roelof Botha: change and then it locks in and then changes much harder to happen.
[01:12:24] Roelof Botha: Remember we talked to Tom Assey, had some congealed grease thing, right?
[01:12:28] Roelof Botha: My mental model is always, it's like the big bang.
[01:12:31] Roelof Botha: Early on in the big bang, everything happens.
[01:12:34] Roelof Botha: And from then on, nothing, yeah, it's just expansion and nothing changes, right?
[01:12:37] Roelof Botha: This is one of those moments in time where how you end up ranking by the end of 26, 27,
[01:12:44] Roelof Botha: probably I think will determine the trajectory for 10 years.
[01:12:46] Roelof Botha: And I think the variance, the high fluctuations we're seeing will steady out.
[01:12:51] Roelof Botha: I can't prove that.
[01:12:53] Roelof Botha: You could have a world where it remains constantly changing.
[01:12:55] Roelof Botha: And in my gut, I think that economics tends to force that kind of stability.
[01:13:00] Roelof Botha: So you really want to be sure that when things start to lock down, you lock down in the
[01:13:04] Roelof Botha: number one position.
[01:13:05] Roelof Botha: Well, just as a reminder, just, I know we'll move on.
[01:13:08] Keith Rabois: But Andreessen said a couple of months ago that 80% of its startups use the Chinese open
[01:13:11] Keith Rabois: source models for AI.
[01:13:13] Keith Rabois: This is what I wanted to go to Jason, which is not a correct quote.
[01:13:18] Roelof Botha: I'm not in Casado, then tweeted and said, that's not quite a correct quote.
[01:13:22] Roelof Botha: I think it was something like only 20% of the time my companies are using open source.
[01:13:27] Roelof Botha: And when they are using open source, I say 8% of that open source is Chinese open source,
[01:13:33] Roelof Botha: which is a very different thing, but still a significant thing.
[01:13:36] Roelof Botha: Right.
[01:13:37] Roelof Botha: Yeah.
[01:13:38] Roelof Botha: Well, it says it.
[01:13:39] Roelof Botha: It's interesting comment here.
[01:13:40] Roelof Botha: What it says is that there is a demand, no surprise for a quote, quote, cheap open source
[01:13:43] Roelof Botha: model.
[01:13:44] Roelof Botha: And given that both, you know, I deal formally idealistic, now highly commercial,
[01:13:50] Roelof Botha: open entities have stopped providing, you know, state of the art open source models.
[01:13:54] Roelof Botha: There is a latent demand for that, which for their own good reasons, which we can speculate
[01:13:57] Roelof Botha: about in the second, the Chinese tech industry appears willing to fill.
[01:14:02] Roelof Botha: I mean, even though the market tells him to stop doing it, it was kind of nice when Zuckerberg
[01:14:07] Roelof Botha: was willing to fund R&D development and keep churning out excellent lambers for everyone
[01:14:11] Roelof Botha: to leverage.
[01:14:12] Roelof Botha: Jason, should US startups be able to leverage Chinese models?
[01:14:17] Jason Calacanis: Listen, assuming there's no security issues, I don't care.
[01:14:20] Keith Rabois: I think the issue that I don't fully understand inference because for most cases, if you're
[01:14:25] Keith Rabois: running a Chinese open source model on Amazon, it's really not any cheaper.
[01:14:30] Keith Rabois: Like you're not saving that much.
[01:14:32] Keith Rabois: You save a little bit of money.
[01:14:33] Keith Rabois: You've got to pay for the model, but the inferences where most of the cost is.
[01:14:37] Keith Rabois: So I think there's still this gray area where it where obviously it works for cursor,
[01:14:42] Keith Rabois: right?
[01:14:43] Keith Rabois: It's scale.
[01:14:44] Keith Rabois: Exactly where it works.
[01:14:45] Keith Rabois: I don't know, but look, as long as we're not sending data back in a way we shouldn't,
[01:14:50] Keith Rabois: I could more importantly listen, I just want to make money like everyone.
[01:14:52] Keith Rabois: It's 2020 going into 2026, Eric, don't tell me about it as an investor.
[01:14:56] Keith Rabois: This is an area of unlimited greed.
[01:15:00] Keith Rabois: I don't want to hear about it.
[01:15:01] Keith Rabois: We're going to forget about it in a week anyway.
[01:15:03] Keith Rabois: We already forgot about real and deploying.
[01:15:05] Keith Rabois: We forgot about all of it.
[01:15:07] Keith Rabois: I just want to make money and be quiet.
[01:15:09] Keith Rabois: Okay, just don't talk about it.
[01:15:10] Keith Rabois: I just want to make money.
[01:15:11] Keith Rabois: Question on quote, Harry's, should we use Chinese open source models?
[01:15:15] Roelof Botha: You have to break it into two.
[01:15:17] Roelof Botha: Are there national security issues, are regulatory issues?
[01:15:20] Roelof Botha: And it's the job of the government to figure out that and we should take our lead from
[01:15:23] Roelof Botha: that.
[01:15:24] Roelof Botha: If the government says no, you should abide by the law.
[01:15:25] Roelof Botha: If the government said yes, you should at least take that into account and you can
[01:15:28] Roelof Botha: say there's not national security issues.
[01:15:30] Roelof Botha: Frankly, and then separately from that, you have the business issues.
[01:15:33] Roelof Botha: Is it good value?
[01:15:34] Roelof Botha: Is it cost effective and all that stuff?
[01:15:36] Roelof Botha: I mean, I think the interesting thing is because, you know, Harry, I've watched your
[01:15:39] Roelof Botha: little dispute with Keat on air wallets on Twitter, but hang on, let me finish right.
[01:15:43] Roelof Botha: The odd thing is I can't quite figure out what I'm, the national security guidance on
[01:15:47] Roelof Botha: China is quite confusing because obviously we're now back to selling them advanced Nvidia
[01:15:52] Roelof Botha: processors.
[01:15:53] Roelof Botha: I think the logic is some version of they're going to figure that out and it was so
[01:15:57] Roelof Botha: shallow to them.
[01:15:58] Roelof Botha: So it's not clear to me where we can say we can do it and where we can not.
[01:16:01] Roelof Botha: And then separately, if you can do it legally, then after that, it's just practical functional
[01:16:06] Roelof Botha: if the models work and you do what you can.
[01:16:08] Roelof Botha: Sorry, that was a little long and convoluted.
[01:16:11] Jason Calacanis: So I'm getting into a very dangerous zone because Keith Roboy is a friend and an LP of mine
[01:16:19] Jason Calacanis: and air wallets is a seven million dollar investment of mine.
[01:16:24] Jason Calacanis: And so I'm screwed both ways on who ever wins and loses in this one, but air wallets raises
[01:16:30] Jason Calacanis: 330 million and an 8 billion dollar valuation led by a leaf-exil ad adition for a big
[01:16:39] Jason Calacanis: investor in Stripe.
[01:16:40] Jason Calacanis: And then in the last few days, Keith Roboy has been very public in stating that there is
[01:16:46] Jason Calacanis: a data concern about the data flows that will go back from air wallets to potential Chinese
[01:16:53] Jason Calacanis: officials, government, you name it, whatever institution that is.
[01:16:57] And that is the news.
[01:16:58] Jason Calacanis: Based on our conversations, we had a billion in ARR, 8 billion revenue.
[01:17:02] Keith Rabois: Why is it so cheap?
[01:17:03] Keith Rabois: Because it's an excellent, excellent payments company.
[01:17:08] Roelof Botha: And it'll be valued like payments companies and payment companies.
[01:17:10] Roelof Botha: I mean, excellent growth rate, excellent payments company with an Asia discount.
[01:17:13] Roelof Botha: Right?
[01:17:14] Roelof Botha: It knows cheap in the context of it's not the AI magic pixie thus.
[01:17:18] Roelof Botha: So you probably would have a higher and then on top of that, you have the Asia discount.
[01:17:21] Roelof Botha: You're exactly right.
[01:17:22] Roelof Botha: But Roboy, it's doing the same revenue that RAM does.
[01:17:25] Jason Calacanis: It has more integrations and more underlying infrastructure.
[01:17:29] Jason Calacanis: It is absolutely the Asia discount.
[01:17:31] Jason Calacanis: Okay.
[01:17:32] Keith Rabois: Let's assume it's growing the same as RAMP and has the same gross margins, right?
[01:17:35] Keith Rabois: It's the same ARR.
[01:17:37] Keith Rabois: Let's assume, maybe the margins are different, but let's assume it's the same for the sake
[01:17:39] Keith Rabois: of argument.
[01:17:40] Keith Rabois: It's trading at a quarter of the price, right?
[01:17:43] Keith Rabois: I get why it's dual headquartered in SF.
[01:17:45] Keith Rabois: But maybe that's the answer.
[01:17:47] Keith Rabois: I like, I literally don't know.
[01:17:48] Keith Rabois: It just seems a quarter of the price.
[01:17:50] Keith Rabois: It seems a bit of a wrap.
[01:17:51] Keith Rabois: I completely agree with you, which is kind of why it's such an obvious idea.
[01:17:56] Roelof Botha: I'm not sure.
[01:17:57] I mean, okay, I think some portion of it is the significant portion of the Asia discount.
[01:18:02] Roelof Botha: I also think, what is it if it's not that worried?
[01:18:05] Roelof Botha: I would like to know.
[01:18:06] Jason Calacanis: I think it's a slight, I mean, one as I think RAMP has versus the median fentech, you're
[01:18:11] Roelof Botha: taking the other extreme RAMP has an extraordinarily good revenue multiple.
[01:18:15] Roelof Botha: I think most, I mean, my, my wider comment is, fentech modibles tend to be significantly
[01:18:19] Roelof Botha: more bounded than open-ended AI multiples.
[01:18:22] Roelof Botha: Well, you write it's the most extreme.
[01:18:24] Roelof Botha: No, but I would, I would actually push back and say, look at Brax at $13 or $14 billion
[01:18:29] Jason Calacanis: with a much worse growth rate, much less, much less profitable and 400 million less in
[01:18:35] Jason Calacanis: error.
[01:18:36] Jason Calacanis: Yeah.
[01:18:37] Roelof Botha: I agree with that.
[01:18:38] Roelof Botha: Between that median one and where you come out, that is some kind of Asia discount.
[01:18:40] Roelof Botha: You exactly right.
[01:18:41] Roelof Botha: My point is between that and RAMP, I would argue because obviously different RAMs and
[01:18:45] Roelof Botha: Rx, and I think that's the high end execution, etc., etc.
[01:18:48] Roelof Botha: And those two things in the discount is all I'm saying.
[01:18:51] Roelof Botha: But yes, let's stipulate to advance the conversation that there's a significant Asia
[01:18:55] Roelof Botha: discount in here.
[01:18:59] Jason Calacanis: And then the question, so the five percent is a lot.
[01:19:01] Jason Calacanis: Yeah, it's a huge amount.
[01:19:02] Jason Calacanis: The question for me becomes actually, when is that shared?
[01:19:06] Jason Calacanis: Because in the case of a bite dance, it's never shared.
[01:19:09] Jason Calacanis: And bite dance is still the massively discounted versus the method, despite it being a
[01:19:14] Jason Calacanis: phenomenal business, both in margin and revenue scale.
[01:19:17] Jason Calacanis: First of all, I think that the bite dance situation is trickier because one, bite dance
[01:19:21] Roelof Botha: itself is clearly a Chinese company.
[01:19:24] Roelof Botha: And then what you really talking about, I talk about the bite dance is going to be the
[01:19:27] Roelof Botha: fact that you have the whole TikTok dynamic because that's a, you know, immediate company
[01:19:30] Roelof Botha: present in the phones of millions of Americans who has an end owner that is ultimately based
[01:19:37] Roelof Botha: in China.
[01:19:38] Roelof Botha: So that's that discount.
[01:19:40] Roelof Botha: And I think I'm saying bite dance is just the overall company with the size of the
[01:19:44] Roelof Botha: money.
[01:19:45] Roelof Botha: Well, there should be a China discount, not just because of us because, you know, for
[01:19:49] Roelof Botha: all the problems of our government, the Chinese government, the dictator of China, said about
[01:19:53] Roelof Botha: five years ago, you shouldn't be doing social media, you should making hardware shit.
[01:19:57] Roelof Botha: And he has completed on-travel power.
[01:19:59] Roelof Botha: So there's a reason there's a discount.
[01:20:01] Roelof Botha: The reason there's a discount is the, you know, the, the one party dictatorship that
[01:20:05] Roelof Botha: wants the country doesn't think those are good businesses.
[01:20:08] Roelof Botha: So it's not like it's a Chinese discount for nothing.
[01:20:10] Roelof Botha: Now the question is, there's a too much.
[01:20:12] Roelof Botha: Can we just depreciate?
[01:20:13] Jason Calacanis: Sorry.
[01:20:14] Jason Calacanis: I know.
[01:20:15] Jason Calacanis: I know.
[01:20:16] Roelof Botha: But you mentioned bite dance and dress.
[01:20:17] Roelof Botha: I know.
[01:20:18] Roelof Botha: I know.
[01:20:19] Jason Calacanis: I'm just pushing.
[01:20:20] Jason Calacanis: I mean, you know, Zoom, Zoom has many more engineers than I am.
[01:20:23] Jason Calacanis: So this is what I'm going to say.
[01:20:24] Roelof Botha: So you know, you mentioned bite dance.
[01:20:25] Roelof Botha: So I went down that route.
[01:20:26] Roelof Botha: What you really talk about in the context of air wallet and many other companies is something
[01:20:30] Roelof Botha: like the following.
[01:20:32] Roelof Botha: These are absolutely not companies that were headquartered in China.
[01:20:38] Roelof Botha: Not owned by Chinese investors.
[01:20:40] Roelof Botha: They are, you know, US or international companies, international in the case of air wallets,
[01:20:44] Roelof Botha: I think, basically based in Australia, that are headquartered in Australia, subject to
[01:20:49] Roelof Botha: Australia in law, etc, etc.
[01:20:51] Roelof Botha: So the idea, so when someone says that's not like a Chinese company, that's a gross,
[01:20:55] Roelof Botha: that's incorrect.
[01:20:56] Roelof Botha: What is true, however, is if you have a significant number of engineers are data centers based
[01:21:05] Roelof Botha: in China, then you will also subject to Chinese law just as when you have data centers
[01:21:10] Roelof Botha: in Europe, you get the Europeans on your case.
[01:21:12] Roelof Botha: And when you have, and if you're a European country based in America, you get the Americans
[01:21:17] Roelof Botha: on your case.
[01:21:18] Roelof Botha: All the superpowers, if you lump Europe kindly into that, any of those countries are entities
[01:21:23] Roelof Botha: in the case of Europe.
[01:21:25] Roelof Botha: Yeah.
[01:21:26] Roelof Botha: Regardless of where company is headquartered, they have a regulatory role to the extent
[01:21:29] Roelof Botha: you're operating in those companies, in those countries.
[01:21:32] Roelof Botha: So some of the questions to you is, if Zoom has more engineers than air wallets does,
[01:21:39] Jason Calacanis: why are we not holding them to the same account, Microsoft and Apple do too.
[01:21:44] I think it's a great question, and I think every one of those, to the extent that these
[01:21:50] kind of issues start to crop up, I think it's going to be a thing.
[01:21:53] Roelof Botha: I mean, once you start doubting the other side's bonafide is things to get worse.
[01:21:59] Roelof Botha: And it's probably true to say, if you have critical mass of engineers, and a particular
[01:22:04] Roelof Botha: of service center based in China, you should assume just based on the standard Chinese
[01:22:07] Roelof Botha: law that government entities have the right of inspection.
[01:22:11] Roelof Botha: Just as in similar, not quite the same way, when you're based over here, you have all the
[01:22:16] Roelof Botha: rights of inspection that you as government would have and access to information.
[01:22:19] Roelof Botha: Right.
[01:22:20] Roelof Botha: I think we're a more rule of law country, but I still think if all three of the big entities,
[01:22:25] Roelof Botha: including, as I say, Europe as the other, has some version of that.
[01:22:28] Roelof Botha: So if you choose to put your back end data center or back end employees in China, you're
[01:22:33] Roelof Botha: taking on that risk, and you're vulnerable to this kind of statement where someone says,
[01:22:37] Roelof Botha: oh my god, your key information is flowing through a Chinese data center, flowing through
[01:22:42] Roelof Botha: Chinese employees, maybe it shouldn't be.
[01:22:44] Roelof Botha: The further apart the country has grown, the more this kind of thing gets problematic.
[01:22:48] Roelof Botha: If you were trying to sell one of these companies, the embedded risk in China would be a key
[01:22:53] Roelof Botha: consideration.
[01:22:54] Roelof Botha: You know, a US domicile company buying one of these companies, we're thinking about that.
[01:23:00] Roelof Botha: You probably will struggle to get some US government contracts.
[01:23:04] Roelof Botha: It's just going to be a thing more and more.
[01:23:05] Roelof Botha: So I think you're just going to see a gradual separation.
[01:23:08] Roelof Botha: You'll just examine the risks and go, why would I, you know, you can get great engineers.
[01:23:13] Roelof Botha: I can save 20, 30 percent.
[01:23:15] Roelof Botha: But in return, I get involved in arguments and Twitter, but more importantly, I probably
[01:23:19] Roelof Botha: get precluded from government contracts.
[01:23:21] Roelof Botha: I have an extra layer of due diligence.
[01:23:24] Roelof Botha: It's just too hard.
[01:23:26] Roelof Botha: Just like all those Chinese companies that, you know, went public in the US, right, let
[01:23:32] Roelof Botha: me give you the counter example, because we all see it from our perspective.
[01:23:35] Roelof Botha: And I do think we are the good guys, but it's also interesting to step into other party
[01:23:39] Roelof Botha: shoes.
[01:23:40] Roelof Botha: A lot of Chinese companies went public in the US and the SEC said, as part of being public
[01:23:45] Roelof Botha: in the US, we want to have access to your audit papers, including the audit papers for
[01:23:49] Roelof Botha: the, your Chinese, come for your Chinese auditors.
[01:23:53] Roelof Botha: They said no.
[01:23:54] Roelof Botha: And as a result of that, we pushed a lot of them off being listed in the US.
[01:23:58] Roelof Botha: You know, you're going to see this kind of thing happening more and more.
[01:24:01] Roelof Botha: I mean, look, we're not even friends with Europe anymore after our national security
[01:24:05] Roelof Botha: policy.
[01:24:06] Roelof Botha: So you're probably going to see some of the same thing.
[01:24:08] Roelof Botha: I mean, we're dealing with a gradual unwinding of globalization.
[01:24:11] Roelof Botha: And this is what it looks like.
[01:24:13] And to your point about you know, and except Keith yelling at you, the competitors are
[01:24:17] Roelof Botha: going to be the people who use it first.
[01:24:19] Roelof Botha: Because if I was an all-American FinTech company, I'd have my all-American flag out there
[01:24:23] Roelof Botha: and say, these guys are a bunch of commies.
[01:24:26] Roelof Botha: They have commies looking at your data where, you know, our stuff is in Texas.
[01:24:30] Roelof Botha: We win.
[01:24:31] Roelof Botha: And that's going to happen.
[01:24:33] Roelof Botha: Gettie, I think the thing I would say to Jason's point about, no one cares.
[01:24:36] Jason Calacanis: No one cares.
[01:24:37] Jason Calacanis: You know, I know Alex very well at deal when I'm not commenting on what happened there.
[01:24:42] Jason Calacanis: But zero-chon.
[01:24:43] Jason Calacanis: I know Jack and I know Alex.
[01:24:45] Jason Calacanis: Zero-chon.
[01:24:46] Jason Calacanis: Well, I suspect, listen, a couple things.
[01:24:49] Keith Rabois: First of all, I suspect this won't lead to churn.
[01:24:51] Keith Rabois: I think this is probably an offensive to dent progress.
[01:24:54] Keith Rabois: Right.
[01:24:55] Keith Rabois: Let's be clear.
[01:24:56] Keith Rabois: I believe you that it helped.
[01:24:57] Keith Rabois: I do think the goal is to impede, right?
[01:24:59] Keith Rabois: Whether it worked or not.
[01:25:01] Keith Rabois: I would just say two things.
[01:25:02] Keith Rabois: One, just the, I don't know the CEO.
[01:25:04] Keith Rabois: He seems ultra-impressive from afar, not just from the recent press,
[01:25:07] Keith Rabois: but from following for a while in social media.
[01:25:09] Keith Rabois: You just, when this happens, you just have to be clear.
[01:25:11] Keith Rabois: You have to not, you have to not only say no as US data sent to China,
[01:25:15] Keith Rabois: you have to make it unimpeachable.
[01:25:17] Keith Rabois: You just have to remove the objection.
[01:25:18] Keith Rabois: An objection has been added to a sale.
[01:25:20] Keith Rabois: Let's just step back for a minute.
[01:25:21] Keith Rabois: Two thoughts.
[01:25:22] Keith Rabois: One, an objection has been added to a sales process.
[01:25:25] Keith Rabois: Maybe to derail a financing, maybe to limit the size of the round.
[01:25:29] Keith Rabois: Who knows?
[01:25:30] Keith Rabois: Who can really link to the timing of the round?
[01:25:32] Keith Rabois: So it's an objection.
[01:25:33] Keith Rabois: Is there maybe a racist element to it that I don't like?
[01:25:36] Keith Rabois: It feels like it.
[01:25:37] Keith Rabois: It feels racist to me.
[01:25:38] Keith Rabois: I don't like it.
[01:25:39] Keith Rabois: But my point is, from a sales perspective,
[01:25:41] Keith Rabois: it's an objection.
[01:25:42] Keith Rabois: A lot of are going to come up, right?
[01:25:44] Keith Rabois: Maybe ramp as a security issue next week they have to deal with.
[01:25:46] Keith Rabois: For example, okay, you got to deal with it.
[01:25:48] Keith Rabois: If I know my data isn't going to China 100%,
[01:25:52] Keith Rabois: I think outside of the US government, the objection's over.
[01:25:56] Keith Rabois: I do think to Rory's point, in my experience,
[01:25:58] Keith Rabois: you're never going to get a government contract.
[01:25:59] Keith Rabois: But so what, the world's big.
[01:26:01] Keith Rabois: You're just never going to get a government contract.
[01:26:02] Keith Rabois: So what, that's just life.
[01:26:03] Keith Rabois: The only cut I would add, I actually got my God sentence.
[01:26:08] Roelof Botha: I never thought I'd say defending Kiwa.
[01:26:09] Roelof Botha: Well, I don't think it's racism.
[01:26:11] Roelof Botha: I look, I genuinely don't.
[01:26:13] Roelof Botha: I think, you know, we're in a very difficult way.
[01:26:14] Roelof Botha: I don't think he is racist,
[01:26:15] Roelof Botha: but I think there could be an element of racism here.
[01:26:18] Keith Rabois: It's very easy to pick on someone that,
[01:26:21] Keith Rabois: my understanding is not Chinese, is Chinese Australian.
[01:26:23] Keith Rabois: And they did it with Eric Wannard Zoom.
[01:26:25] Keith Rabois: It was very racist for a while.
[01:26:27] Keith Rabois: It was very racist when people wanted to make it a Chinese company.
[01:26:29] Keith Rabois: Harry's right.
[01:26:30] Keith Rabois: They do have a large Chinese presence.
[01:26:31] Keith Rabois: It was a vulnerability for Zoom, right?
[01:26:34] Roelof Botha: I'll disagree.
[01:26:34] Roelof Botha: I don't want to devolve down to it.
[01:26:36] Roelof Botha: I think there are legitimate security questions.
[01:26:39] Roelof Botha: Because when you read the laws of the relevant countries,
[01:26:42] Roelof Botha: just like our laws can seem very own.
[01:26:44] Roelof Botha: Just let's give another example.
[01:26:46] Roelof Botha: When the Europeans get all bent out of shape
[01:26:48] Roelof Botha: about our lack of privacy laws
[01:26:51] Roelof Botha: and they put up their own weird laws to stop,
[01:26:53] Roelof Botha: because they're worried about us,
[01:26:55] Roelof Botha: that's just a mirror image of this.
[01:26:56] Roelof Botha: Right?
[01:26:57] Roelof Botha: I don't think this phenomenon is driven by anything other than,
[01:27:02] Roelof Botha: you know, large country blocks with very different perspectives,
[01:27:05] Roelof Botha: not increasingly being uncomfortable with how the other,
[01:27:09] Roelof Botha: you know, countries, our systems are governed
[01:27:12] Roelof Botha: and wanting to exert power in a world where they can.
[01:27:14] Roelof Botha: It was great when we were the dominant power.
[01:27:16] Roelof Botha: Everybody did what we wanted.
[01:27:17] Roelof Botha: And it was freaking awesome.
[01:27:18] Roelof Botha: And everybody did what we wanted
[01:27:19] Roelof Botha: because they wanted to be in our game.
[01:27:21] Roelof Botha: Right?
[01:27:22] Roelof Botha: Now for whatever reason, we've convinced ourselves
[01:27:24] Roelof Botha: that that was bad.
[01:27:25] Roelof Botha: And now we're going to have a world where people don't want
[01:27:27] Roelof Botha: to do what we want.
[01:27:28] Roelof Botha: And we're going to find it to bigger pan of the ass.
[01:27:30] Anyway, all right, Boris, this has been fantastic.
[01:27:32] Jason Calacanis: I'm going to push you to three companies, okay?
[01:27:34] Jason Calacanis: And you've got to pick one, okay?
[01:27:36] Jason Calacanis: Oh, yeah.
[01:27:37] Jason Calacanis: I know, Roy, you love it.
[01:27:38] Jason Calacanis: No, no.
[01:27:40] Jason Calacanis: I always do it because I know that you're,
[01:27:42] Jason Calacanis: you know, you do it to humiliate.
[01:27:44] Jason Calacanis: No, no, no, no, you humiliate.
[01:27:46] Jason Calacanis: To force great thinking.
[01:27:49] Jason Calacanis: Air wallets at 8 billion or ramp at 32,
[01:27:53] Jason Calacanis: which would you rather own?
[01:27:55] Jason Calacanis: If let's assume the revenue and the growth rates are the same,
[01:27:58] Roelof Botha: and I don't think they are.
[01:27:59] Roelof Botha: I don't have the time.
[01:27:59] Roelof Botha: But I think ramp is a more enterprisey product.
[01:28:01] Roelof Botha: And air wallets is more money movement.
[01:28:04] Roelof Botha: So, but I so I think that's a significant point,
[01:28:07] Roelof Botha: but just to give you an interesting discussion
[01:28:09] Roelof Botha: versus a boring one, if I was on the air wallet explored,
[01:28:13] because I don't think it's quote unquote a Chinese company,
[01:28:15] Roelof Botha: I think it's a perfectly normal lost railing company,
[01:28:18] Roelof Botha: I would put in an 8 billion and a part of my closing condition
[01:28:20] Roelof Botha: would be within 24 hours,
[01:28:22] Roelof Botha: we do not have a single paid employee in China.
[01:28:25] Roelof Botha: And we locate the entire service organization
[01:28:27] Roelof Botha: to some other jurisdiction.
[01:28:29] Roelof Botha: Get out.
[01:28:30] Roelof Botha: Then I would do it at 8, if they are equivalent.
[01:28:33] Roelof Botha: Because I think that's something you can do.
[01:28:34] Roelof Botha: I'm going to give him credit.
[01:28:35] Roelof Botha: I think madness did a great job on that.
[01:28:36] Roelof Botha: I think it's very much not a, you know,
[01:28:38] Roelof Botha: I think Benchmark did a good job of making it very much
[01:28:41] Roelof Botha: a company from people who used to live in China, right?
[01:28:44] And I'm not saying that, I'm just saying
[01:28:46] Roelof Botha: that would be a value-ad moment.
[01:28:48] Roelof Botha: And I've had that with another company
[01:28:49] Roelof Botha: where I'm not going to mention in,
[01:28:51] Roelof Botha: we had a significant Russia presence.
[01:28:52] Roelof Botha: And this was before 2014.
[01:28:54] Roelof Botha: And I was like, let's just hire people somewhere else.
[01:28:57] Roelof Botha: It's not worth the extra 20%.
[01:28:59] Roelof Botha: So I think the same thing here.
[01:29:00] Roelof Botha: I would do air wallets at eight or nine.
[01:29:02] Roelof Botha: I would go on that board and I would say,
[01:29:04] Roelof Botha: figure your location strategy and get relocated
[01:29:07] Roelof Botha: out of China within the next 12 months.
[01:29:10] Roelof Botha: I wouldn't make that a condition at all.
[01:29:11] Keith Rabois: I would just trust Jack to figure it out.
[01:29:13] Keith Rabois: I think obviously he's obviously,
[01:29:15] Keith Rabois: he's well aware of the issues.
[01:29:17] Keith Rabois: He's well aware of the trade-offs.
[01:29:19] Keith Rabois: He's well aware of the trade-off.
[01:29:21] Keith Rabois: He's very global.
[01:29:22] Keith Rabois: I think it's VC condescending to tell the CEO
[01:29:26] Keith Rabois: how they're going to work it out.
[01:29:27] Keith Rabois: I think it is the kind of VC.
[01:29:29] Keith Rabois: I think it is beyond condescending.
[01:29:32] Keith Rabois: The great CEO's will figure it out.
[01:29:34] Keith Rabois: I'm going to push back hard on that.
[01:29:36] Roelof Botha: Hard on that.
[01:29:37] Keith Rabois: But people are going to see you as condescending
[01:29:38] Keith Rabois: where I wouldn't push back.
[01:29:40] Roelof Botha: I disagree.
[01:29:40] Roelof Botha: And they're well aware of the economy.
[01:29:41] Roelof Botha: They like you a lot now.
[01:29:42] Roelof Botha: Don't make them think of you as condescending.
[01:29:44] Keith Rabois: It doesn't help at the end of the year.
[01:29:45] Keith Rabois: Don't push back.
[01:29:46] Keith Rabois: Take them all again and delete this.
[01:29:47] Keith Rabois: No, I won't.
[01:29:48] Roelof Botha: There are a few things where it is a board's
[01:29:50] Roelof Botha: place to say something.
[01:29:51] Roelof Botha: And this is one of them where you're like strategic fatal error
[01:29:55] Roelof Botha: risk is exactly what a board has to do.
[01:29:57] Roelof Botha: The ability to sell the company something a board has to work.
[01:30:00] Roelof Botha: And I remember this other case, say to CEO, look,
[01:30:03] Roelof Botha: you will limit your pool of buyers dramatically
[01:30:06] Roelof Botha: if you have this significant exposure to this thing.
[01:30:09] Roelof Botha: How you get rid of that, you can talk about as a CEO.
[01:30:12] Roelof Botha: But it is one of the few things where you as a board member
[01:30:15] Roelof Botha: might have a little more perspective than someone.
[01:30:17] Roelof Botha: Because when you're down in it, you can go,
[01:30:18] Roelof Botha: that's silly.
[01:30:19] Roelof Botha: It's wrong.
[01:30:20] Roelof Botha: You know these people that trust where it is.
[01:30:21] Roelof Botha: It's not really an issue.
[01:30:22] Roelof Botha: They don't have access to the data.
[01:30:24] Roelof Botha: And one of the roles that a board member
[01:30:25] Roelof Botha: was to say, step back, dude, everything you're saying
[01:30:28] Roelof Botha: is true, but when it goes to ship no one will care.
[01:30:30] Roelof Botha: Why pay the tax?
[01:30:32] Roelof Botha: How much extra would it cost?
[01:30:33] Roelof Botha: So I disagree.
[01:30:34] Roelof Botha: That would be one where I would think that would be something
[01:30:36] Roelof Botha: you should say.
[01:30:37] Roelof Botha: But this is good, because we're meant to have disagreements.
[01:30:40] OK.
[01:30:40] Oh, woo.
[01:30:43] Keith Rabois: I think you just do the deal at Airwalex
[01:30:45] Keith Rabois: and trust him to figure it out.
[01:30:46] Keith Rabois: I think it's that simple.
[01:30:47] Keith Rabois: And I think ADEX AirR is a good deal.
[01:30:51] Keith Rabois: You trust great founders to figure it out.
[01:30:52] Keith Rabois: I think it's a fine deal.
[01:30:53] Keith Rabois: It sounds like a dislocation in the market.
[01:30:55] Keith Rabois: And you could do worse than invest in a dislocation in the market.
[01:30:59] Keith Rabois: Cow she raised $1 billion out 11 billion.
[01:31:03] Jason Calacanis: That doesn't seem like a dislocation in the market.
[01:31:05] Keith Rabois: That seems like a location in the market.
[01:31:07] Keith Rabois: Right.
[01:31:07] Keith Rabois: Yeah.
[01:31:08] Keith Rabois: A very precise heat seeking missile.
[01:31:12] Keith Rabois: Just like Maverick and his team of Tom Katz hit that,
[01:31:16] Keith Rabois: right?
[01:31:17] Keith Rabois: Right in the movie.
[01:31:18] Keith Rabois: The same position.
[01:31:19] Jason Calacanis: The market.
[01:31:20] Jason Calacanis: It's a thing you can have cow she at $11 or you can have polymarket at $13.
[01:31:25] Jason Calacanis: I would wish everyone is better for insider trading.
[01:31:27] Keith Rabois: I'm going to do, right?
[01:31:29] Keith Rabois: Because that's really the exciting part, right?
[01:31:31] Keith Rabois: Either betting illegally on sports or even better
[01:31:34] Keith Rabois: is betting illegally on betting legally on confidential Google
[01:31:39] Keith Rabois: information and meta information like they're doing, right?
[01:31:41] Keith Rabois: This is a great time to be an engineer.
[01:31:43] Keith Rabois: You don't have to be Nancy Pelosi to make money legally
[01:31:45] Keith Rabois: out of confidential information anywhere.
[01:31:47] Keith Rabois: You could just be a senior engineer at Metter Google
[01:31:49] Keith Rabois: and make millions on the side.
[01:31:51] Keith Rabois: It's a great time to be alive.
[01:31:53] Keith Rabois: He's come up great time to be alive.
[01:31:55] Keith Rabois: I'm just in case anyone doesn't know this.
[01:31:58] Roelof Botha: He doesn't know this.
[01:31:59] Roelof Botha: This comments are driven by an anonymous prediction market
[01:32:03] Roelof Botha: person that made literally millions of dollars betting on things
[01:32:06] Roelof Botha: like what will the number one query term on Google be today
[01:32:11] Roelof Botha: and getting it right like sequential days and a roll leading
[01:32:14] Roelof Botha: the suspicious mind to assume that they have in fact access
[01:32:17] Roelof Botha: to that data.
[01:32:18] Roelof Botha: Correct, Jason?
[01:32:19] Roelof Botha: You exactly right.
[01:32:20] Keith Rabois: Well, also, Pony Pony is bet on opening I news.
[01:32:21] Keith Rabois: He's doing great.
[01:32:22] Keith Rabois: Just being able to sell 20 million every two years isn't enough.
[01:32:25] Keith Rabois: Now he can day trade on the information.
[01:32:27] Keith Rabois: These are great days.
[01:32:28] Keith Rabois: No, I think you're exact.
[01:32:30] Roelof Botha: These are great days.
[01:32:32] It is quite a phenomenon that will probably result
[01:32:35] Roelof Botha: in some level of regulation because you have bought insider
[01:32:39] Roelof Botha: trading on these kind of arcane information
[01:32:42] Roelof Botha: and you're beginning to increasingly see concerns in the sports
[01:32:46] Roelof Botha: gambling side that do you have, especially when you can do
[01:32:49] Roelof Botha: these micro bets.
[01:32:50] Roelof Botha: It's one thing to say, am I going to throw the game for my bet
[01:32:54] Roelof Botha: on the side?
[01:32:55] Roelof Botha: But if you can actually bet that in the third quarter,
[01:32:58] Roelof Botha: you will XYZ out late will score, will only score one,
[01:33:02] Roelof Botha: whatever, basket or whatever, you can have these micro bets
[01:33:07] Roelof Botha: that don't change the thing.
[01:33:08] Roelof Botha: And you really are very vulnerable to person betting
[01:33:11] Roelof Botha: on something that they can control, either themselves or to someone else.
[01:33:14] Roelof Botha: So I think these are really interesting.
[01:33:16] Roelof Botha: As I said before, these are super interesting bets.
[01:33:19] Roelof Botha: God, I wish I was in one because it's interesting.
[01:33:21] Roelof Botha: But there's a cesspit of issues coming here.
[01:33:26] Roelof Botha: And if there was a turn to regulation ever, there's going
[01:33:30] Roelof Botha: to be a bunch of congression.
[01:33:31] Roelof Botha: In about three or four years, just like the quiz games in the 50s,
[01:33:35] Roelof Botha: there's going to be a bunch of congressional hearings where someone's
[01:33:37] Roelof Botha: going to be asking the Calhoun and Pony market CEO,
[01:33:40] Roelof Botha: how did this guy get that Y27 days in a row?
[01:33:43] Roelof Botha: Do you know your customer and he's going to go, it's all crypto based.
[01:33:48] Roelof Botha: I don't know what they're going to say.
[01:33:50] Roelof Botha: Maybe that's not how we're going to roll anymore.
[01:33:52] Roelof Botha: It's good times.
[01:33:53] Roelof Botha: It is.
[01:33:54] Roelof Botha: But super interesting because you can also assume that the back
[01:33:58] Roelof Botha: to the value of prediction markets just kind of taking both sides of this argument,
[01:34:02] Roelof Botha: you can assume that people betting these arcane things really strongly,
[01:34:05] Roelof Botha: almost certainly have inside information.
[01:34:07] Roelof Botha: So in fact, you get to know.
[01:34:09] Roelof Botha: I mean, that's the whole way prediction markets are meant to function.
[01:34:12] Roelof Botha: I mean, because there's two levels of, I want to say,
[01:34:15] Roelof Botha: there's the, I know the information.
[01:34:17] Roelof Botha: So I'm just betting with inside information.
[01:34:19] Roelof Botha: And the good thing about that is it's actually,
[01:34:21] Roelof Botha: it's why inside of information used to be legal.
[01:34:23] Roelof Botha: It's actually contributing to the information in the system because it's a fact.
[01:34:27] Roelof Botha: It's correct.
[01:34:28] Roelof Botha: And then you have the even more and videos thing where the person betting
[01:34:31] Roelof Botha: not only knows the information, but can manipulate the information,
[01:34:35] Roelof Botha: which is where you go from merely inside of trading,
[01:34:38] Roelof Botha: which is illegal to something worse than that,
[01:34:40] Roelof Botha: where you're actually changing the outcome by virtue of betting on it.
[01:34:44] Roelof Botha: And that's the point of which the thing stops working.
[01:34:46] Roelof Botha: And that's where we have Pakistan play cricket.
[01:34:49] By the way, how are you, yeah, someone,
[01:34:51] Roelof Botha: we mind how are you guys doing in the ashes at the moment?
[01:34:54] And that's a wrap to the show, baby.
[01:34:57] Jason Calacanis: Great times, great times.
[01:35:01] Jason Calacanis: Boys, this has been so much fun.
[01:35:03] Jason Calacanis: As always, Jason, you brought some spice today.
[01:35:07] Jason Calacanis: I loved it.
[01:35:08] Jason Calacanis: There were always condescending and I need to go and learn code and do a wrap-plit.
[01:35:13] Jason Calacanis: You were all fighting.
[01:35:14] Jason Calacanis: Oh, it's a more time-unreasoning, that's all.
[01:35:16] Jason Calacanis: No, I do. The 20 VC jumper is giving you superpowers.
[01:35:19] Jason Calacanis: You're a star.
[01:35:20] Jason Calacanis: It's all in the sweater.
