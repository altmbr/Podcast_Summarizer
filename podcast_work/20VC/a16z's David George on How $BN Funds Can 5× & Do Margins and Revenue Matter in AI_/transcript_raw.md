[00:00:00] Our best performing fund in the history of the firm is actually a $1 billion fund.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: David George is a general partner at recent horrors where he leads the firm's growth investing.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_01: His team has bats him incredible defining companies of this era.
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_01: He's now investing behind a new generation of AI startups.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_01: If you overweight the fear of future theoretical competition,
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: you can always talk yourself out of making an investment.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_00: The number one way to measure a company is ultimately return on investing capital.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_00: On the roast margin point today, I'll say this.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_00: We give a little bit more of a pass than we used to.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: At what point does the industry price even for open AI become more to good use of dollars?
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_01: We have to constantly reassess this.
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_01: So what I just don't understand that I would love to is flow.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: Can you help me understand flow?
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_01: Because I think the world kind of scratched that head.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_01: Why did it make sense to you when it didn't make sense to anyone else?
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_01: You remember what I said earlier about investing behind strength of strengths?
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Ready to go.
[00:01:12] David, dude, I am so excited for this.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_01: I've been looking forward to this one for a while and I feel like I'm at your prep now.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_01: I've just listened to you on embass like the best.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: So I'm ready to go, dude.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: Let's do it.
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I actually spoke to most of your partners beforehand.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_01: And they said to me that I have to start with a show that we did with Everett Randall.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: An Everett Randall said on the show that you cannot look LPs in the face and tell them you'll
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_01: do a 5X with the fun sizes you have.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: How do you think about responding to the notion that one can't say to their LPs,
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_01: you'll do a 5X with large funds?
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: Well, Harry, it is great to be back with you.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_00: I love hanging out with you.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_00: So I'm glad we're diving right in.
[00:02:00] Yeah, as it relates to fun sizes, so our funds consistently beat small, large, diversified,
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_00: concentrated venture funds.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_00: So our larger funds have out-of-formed or smaller ones and our larger ones actually have
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: similar multiples of money to our smaller ones across strategies.
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_00: So I would start by just saying this.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: And venture, we have two customers.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: We've got the LPs and we have founders.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_00: On the LPs side, money is going to flow to where the highest returns and bestverse reward are.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: And so I think our fund sizes or a reflection of that.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: Our best performing fund in the history of the firm is actually a $1 billion fund.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: So it's a large fund, right?
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: In that fund, Databricks has returned 7X to fund so far.
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_00: Coinbase has returned already DPI 5X of the fund.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_00: In that fund, we also had GitHub, Digital Ocean,
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_00: Lyft, and many other things.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: So to me, you can kind of see it in the data in our returns already.
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: It's about the number of winners you capture.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_00: And if the big ones are great, that can really work out.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: So I think the idea that large funds can't have great returns is just not true in our experience.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: So private markets have changed.
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_00: Tech waves create bigger opportunities.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: So let me just talk about each.
[00:03:17] The private markets have grown 10X over 10 years, right?
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: So it's over $5 trillion of market cap now in our market.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: We actually just looked at the 50 top IPOs from 2017 to 2025.
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_00: And if you disaggregate where the dollars of return come from,
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: 47% of the dollars of gain happens between the C and the Series B.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_00: And 53% of the dollars of gain happen from Series C plus.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: So it's actually a lot of dollars.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: I was actually surprised when we looked at this,
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: but there's a tremendous amount of dollars of gain that happened in the later stage.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: And that's 17 to 25 IPOs.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_00: That actually skews a little bit heavily toward when companies were still going public
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_00: when they were smaller.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: So the size of outcomes is huge.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: Again, we've got 5 trillion of private market cap.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_00: If you look at our LSV funds, the aggregate market cap in those funds has ranged between 700
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_00: billion to 1.5 trillion.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: So there's just large companies.
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_00: And if you apply ownership sumptures that relative to generating 3X or 5X returns,
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: it's pretty manageable.
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_00: So that's the private market and the conditions that have changed.
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: And we can talk a bunch about that.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_00: Tech waves tend to create massively different value.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: I mean, this is very well covered.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_00: But the big story of mobile social,
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_00: SaaS, cloud e-commerce all at once was 25 trillion of market cap creation.
[00:04:41] And if that started from scratch today, given the public private market dynamic that I just
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: described, so much of that value creation would take place in the private markets.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: So we're in winning any one of this new big tech wave.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: I never would have expected in the last wave that companies like Salesforce would be worth $230
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: billion.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: Or service now would be worth $175 billion.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: A crowd strike, $130 billion or dordash, $100 billion.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: But here we are.
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_00: And if you look at what's happening in the private versus public markets now,
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_00: the size of the winners from a new tech wave, that's going to happen in the private markets.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: Can I share with the extension of private markets,
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: you worried that essentially companies are not going out for so long that they are getting
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_01: competed by new private companies before they get a chance to get out.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_01: You can look at the dynamic between Axon and Flux safety as a good example of that.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: Well, Axon is eating away at part of Flux safety's business.
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_01: Well, they replace them in Atlanta, a cool part of Flux business.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_01: And both are private and they're eating away at each other in a world by one of them would have
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_01: gone public in that time in a traditional world.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't think that whether it's public or private has much to do with the competitive
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_00: dynamics, to be honest.
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_00: But it does in terms of liquidity for venture investors.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_00: Like, yeah, well, we've led three rounds in Flux safety.
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_00: We led their last round too.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_00: And so we're still quite bullish about Flux safety.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_00: You could talk about the increasing competition with Axon.
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_00: The real story of that one is that the market is actually embracing technology now, finally.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_00: And so it used to be that historically selling into law enforcement was a terrible category.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_00: And now it turns out that it's a wonderful category.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: If you actually have the most compelling products, you can get tremendous amounts of market share.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_00: And so I don't worry about that dynamic at all.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: And frankly, I think the more some of those companies have stayed private,
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: it's been to our benefit because we've been able to increase our ownership over time.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: Are you able to take money off the table with the essential private market?
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: Given how big a name you are and how big a position you often have, you're just a big piece of
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_01: a cap table for someone like me, it's much easier to sell out in a later round.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_01: Are you able to and do you have that discussion internally of, hey, we should take chips off the
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_01: table now? We could, but we historically have not. And so for the most part, for the companies
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: that have decided to stay private, we've been really excited to stay in them, keep backing on,
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_00: and that's probably the strategy that we'll continue to have.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: You know, I think this staying private dynamic is a little bit overblown because I think there's
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: some idiosyncratic reasons why certain companies have stayed private. And many companies,
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_00: many CEOs that I talk to, they are very happy to be public or they're excited to go public.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, I tell our CEOs all the time, I've been fortunate to work with a bunch of public
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: companies. Never one of them has said I regret going public. And so I think for most of the companies
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: that we're talking about, they'll wait longer than they had historically, but they will still end
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: up going public. Seriously? Yeah, I mean, I don't mean that horribly. I don't meet many public
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_01: CEOs who don't tell me they wish they were private. No, I mean, look, I think there's tremendous
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: benefits to being public. Now, there's huge benefits for being private as well, which we can talk about.
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_00: But, you know, you could look at many of the public companies that are out there that had
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_00: difficult paths and they would say, you know, they wouldn't trade it. Can you, genuinely? Can you
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: tell me what those benefits would be? It's easier access to capital in some cases. So, there are
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_00: select few private companies that have very easy access to capital in the private markets.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_00: I think there's a trade-off in the private markets where you actually have a more expensive cost
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: of capital, even if you have access to a lot of it. So, I think you can get a cheaper cost of
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: capital in the public markets. And it's a little bit... You needn't still got a cheaper cost of
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: capital in the public. That public, to me, is more expensive to say. Private is, we've given more
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_01: elasticity on price to pay to me, no? Oh, I don't think so. I don't think so. The companies that we
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_00: invested in, I'm very excited about them in the private markets. And I think if they were...
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_00: When you look at a rapid or a lovable price where it is, it's like price at the same price as
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_01: wix. And wix is doing it to billion of profit. Yeah, I'm not close enough to those to know. I don't
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_00: thought, well, we're not close enough though. The comps are very, very sharply contrasting what we're
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_01: saying that. That actually publishes harder and privacy cheaper cost of capital. Yeah, look,
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_00: we're not close to those companies. I'm not close enough to know how they're valued relative to
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_00: their performance. I can say in our portfolio, the companies that we have invested in over the last
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_00: year or so, I'm pretty confident that if they were in the public markets, they probably have access
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_00: to capital at a cheaper cost. I always remember watching... I think it was John Colossan, say, like,
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_01: oh, I'm not going to do the accent because I'm sure the accent, which is the one I'm not an actor.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_01: You already have the good one. You don't need to mess with it. Stop it. So too kind. And I don't
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_01: want John to be on the friend me, because I'll sound like a Russian. But I don't understand why I
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_01: would go public. I don't need some 25 year old associate to tell me that I need to plan more
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_01: efficiently. Yeah. For certain companies, it's a huge benefit. For somebody like Strive that can
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: get a pretty liquid market in the private markets, I get it. For them, I think the biggest benefit
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: is not so much that because I think in the fullness of time, if you're transparent, you tell
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_00: a good story, you share with the public markets, they'll understand your business. I think the
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_00: biggest advantage is the avoidance of volatility in your stock price and sort of employee management.
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_00: And so, I think if you can kind of steadily grow or control your stock price in the private
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_00: markets, even if it's a slight discount to where you would be in the public markets, I get the
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: benefit of that, for sure. And we've seen some of our companies that have been able to do that.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: Strive, SpaceX, Databricks, it's worked to their advantage, for sure.
[00:11:02] Is there anything else that you think is complete bullshit or that people don't see about the
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_01: extension of private markets and the opportunity that's opened up for fun sizes like yours with this
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_01: extension? I think the biggest thing that's missing is just the change in what that means for asset
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_00: classes. So it used to be that you could get access to great companies in the public markets that are
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_00: small cap. It turns out that's fewer and further between now. So we just did an analysis on this.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it turns out that the number of public companies has been cut in half over the last 20 years.
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, the companies that we're talking about, you know, many of them would already be in the
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_00: public markets and they're not. And so, you know, if you look at where the returns are getting
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_00: generated, the returns are actually getting generated in the private markets before they go to
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_00: the public markets. And now if you look at what remains in small cap land in the public markets,
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_00: you know, there are definitely some high quality companies, but the quality has deteriorated.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_00: A friend of mine just shared this analysis with me that showed the return on invested capital
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: of the Russell 2500 over the last 30 years. And if you look at the ROIC, which to me is like the
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_00: easiest measure of the quality of the company, the ROIC of the Russell 2500 over the last 30 years,
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: it's gone from 7.5% steadily down to 3%. So like more than cut in half. And so, and that's a pretty
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_00: steady decline. I mean, it ebbs and flows with economic cycles. So I think the biggest thing that's
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_00: missing is probably, you know, a reality that we have to adapt to and how we run our business.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_00: But it's also a reality for, you know, institutional investors and LP community that the asset class
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_00: is no longer, you know, a sort of bespoke small thing. It's like the grown up leagues, you know,
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_00: it's the big leagues. Like if you just look at the size of the private technology high quality
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: companies, it dwarfs the size of private equity, you know, private equity technology in the US. And so,
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: you know, that that's a major, that's a major shift. And we've had to adapt our business to it
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_00: in a big way, right? Like if the companies stay private longer, we got to give them new stuff. They
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_00: have to be multi product. They have to be multi channel. They have to be international. And with AI,
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_00: it's happening much, much faster. So we've changed our business as well. But I think the market reality
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_00: is just historical views of what the asset classes are. Do not reflect what they actually are today.
[00:13:29] Completely agree. So I'm an institutional investor with a $10 billion endowment fund.
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_01: How should I change my asset allocation between P venture publics given that blurriness
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_01: merging lack of clarity that you just mentioned? What would you genuinely advise me?
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_01: I'm heavily biased. And, you know, look, I recognize that many of the endowments have kind of,
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: they have a starting position, which is, you know, I think many have probably
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_00: find themselves a little bit over allocated to privates. And so I don't know how to assess that
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: relative to the future outlook. But if I take the future outlook only, where do I think of the
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: most attractive opportunity set? Like if you just start with where the 10 most valuable companies
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_00: in the world are today versus 25 years ago, like eight of the top 10 are US West Coast-based
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_00: technology companies. And, you know, they were venture backed. And so if you assume that the future
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: is likely to be, you know, something similar to what's happened in the last 20 years,
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: I think the most interesting place to be is this asset class, you know, which has exposure to what
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_00: those next generational kind of dominant companies can be. And so, you know, I think the allocation
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_00: should reflect this sort of melding of what used to be part of the public markets than no longer is.
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_00: That's sort of a, you know, a newer asset class. And so that's one piece of it. You know, my friends
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_00: in private equity do an amazing job. They have incredible returns. Do they have better returns than
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_01: me? If you were to look, I'm, my compliance guy doesn't let us talk about returns. But if you were
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: to look at our returns or the top performing venture funds, let's just call it that relative to,
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: you know, top performing PE funds, the top performing venture funds are performed. And so,
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: you know, I think that's historical, but I think it's going to be, you know, more extreme in the
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_00: future because I think AI and the effective implementation of AI is going to be the most important
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_00: thing for companies over the next 10 years. There's so many things that I want to talk about. You
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_01: said that the eight out of the 10 in US, candidly, would you buy after a mile about Europe?
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_01: Like if you have a US covered, you've got eight out of the 10. You've got dominant market share
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_01: silicon, body to retain the title as AI center. Can't like, obviously I'm in London. I'm not
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_01: going to be offended. But is that what you would say? No, not at all. I mean, there's great entrepreneurs
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: in Europe. And we've backed a bunch, right? Like we, we backed Maddie from 11 labs and he's doing
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_00: an extraordinary job building what we think is a generational market leading company. You're shaking
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: your head. Yeah, I tonned it down at seed. You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: bet a thousand. But you did another one of yours. I tonned down at seed that keeps me up every day,
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_01: every day. Yes, there's amazing. There's amazing entrepreneurs deal deal deal. Oh, deal.
[00:16:31] Uh, two on 12. Deal. My favorite thing about deal, um, I mean, Alex is just absolutely relentless.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: He, so I recently, I had some post, I think it was, um, you know, an announcement of something,
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_00: you know, that I posted on LinkedIn. Somebody had commented a CFO of a growth stage company had
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: commented on it. And I immediately get a screenshot from Alex circling the comment. And he said,
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_00: can you introduce me to this guy? He looks like a great deal customer. And I'm like, man,
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_00: this guy is always selling. Uh, and so in a market like that, like that is exactly what you need.
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_00: I love it. Did I paint him on a Sunday morning? I said, Hey, a project Europe company. This is
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: like very young founders on the age of 25 with no employees. Uh, it wants to be a deal customer
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_01: who's the lowest personal team, much, who's showing shooting to a team. Me, you can do it now,
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_01: please. I'll take the cool today. I was like, do this like, but there's one person. He's
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_01: alder. It's cool to meet him. It's actually, it's actually amazing. He's, he's, he's relentless.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_00: And, and you know, look, like this is very much the kind of founder that I love. One thing I do
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_01: worry about when we look at this stage of the market, especially when it comes to this prices that
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_01: we're like taking venture risk in terms of probability stage of company, but at prices that were
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_01: previously very, very mature companies. How do you respond and think about that? Taking venture
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_01: risk at super high mature company prices? I think there are certain instances where it makes sense.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I would agree with you that there are many instances in the market where that doesn't make
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_00: sense. Uh, I think there are certain instances where some degree of likelihood of success is very,
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: very, very high despite, despite, you know, a very early stage. And so, you know, as an example,
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_00: my partner Sarah, um, led around a character AI and, you know, is extremely early stage. And,
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_00: you know, we, we invested at a, you know, what you would call a gross stage price. But we knew that
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_00: the likelihood of some degree of success in backing known was extremely high. And so, you know,
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_00: it worked out that way and it's go for extremely, extremely special people like that. Uh, you know,
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_00: we're, we're comfortable to step into those situations. So, which you argue for deals like that,
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_01: actually, the risk is not the entry price because you've got the lick craft, which means like,
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_01: someone like norm, he's always going to get bought for whatever the lick profits, like whatever
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_01: 100 or 200 million, obviously. Yeah, we almost never make an investment saying like, oh, we've
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: got the liquidation preference. Um, but, you know, there are certain situations like that where,
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_00: you know, we feel like it's pretty asymmetric. And so, you know, backing known, you feel like
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_00: there's a pretty safe downside. And there's an extremely high upside. I think the, the kinds of
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_00: people, you know, I say people because these, you know, some of these are like earlier stage people
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_00: best, the kinds of people like that that warrant an investment decision, you know, a thought process
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_00: like that. I think are extremely small. I mean, the list is five people, I think.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_00: Love that. I speak to Brian Kim on your team. And he asked me, do you see as part of the
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_01: growth fund's charter to fix the errors of a mission from your venture team? Very much so.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_00: And what we do in partnership with the early stage team. So this is, this is like our whole model,
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_00: right? Um, you know, we talk about mistakes we make all the time. And we have some very,
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_00: I have very painful errors of a mission at the growth stage too. I think if you think about
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_00: what our business is, we're never going to have at the early stage 100% market share of all the
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_00: best deals. And so, you know, by having a growth fund, we can come later. And, you know, we call
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_00: it like the fix the mistake fund internally when we're joking around. But we do that in close
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_00: partnership with our early stage teams. So we always join team meetings. We're always talking to
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_00: each other. You know, what do you, you know, asking the early stage team like, hey, what series aes,
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_00: do you wish you had done that you passed on? You know, which seeds do you feel like you passed on?
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_00: And so when you have a situation like what you described with Maddie, and you say, you know,
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_00: you're pulling your hair out that you that you didn't do the seed, you know, that's okay. Come back
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_00: and, you know, come back and fix the mistake at the B or the C. And so it's a huge part of our
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_00: charter. By the numbers about half of what we do is follow on from existing venture companies.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_00: And then from a dollar standpoint, another 15% is follow on from existing growth stage companies.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: And then about a third or so is fully net new companies. And when we're doing the fully net
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: new companies, we have a pre existing relationship with those founders from the early stage every time.
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_00: And so definitely, can you tell me on the 15 15 50 is follow on, but 15 is what follow on of a
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_01: different kind of an originated growth fund investment. So the thing that's important about that is,
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_00: you know, when we invest, I don't know, two thirds of the time or so, it's into a company that we
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_00: have a pre existing relationship with either at the early stage or the growth fund. So the 50 is,
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_00: you know, we did the 11 labs growth round and we did, you know, thankfully, Jennifer and Brian did
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_00: the early stage round. The 15 would be, we led two more rounds in flock safety or, you know,
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_00: we led another round, you know, into Figma or, you know, we put more money into SpaceX. So
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_00: something that was originated, you know, or Waymo, something that we originally did out of the growth
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_00: fund. What did the Van Schaffandee that you didn't double down into with the benefit of hindsight,
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_01: you're like, motherfucker, we should have done. Oh, man, there's many of these. We don't, we don't
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_00: get it right all the time. I think the most relevant are like, we passed and then we ended up fixing
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_00: our own mistake. So, you know, for example, you know, with deal, you know, there was a round in
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_00: between when Ani Schled the series A and then we co led the series C and, you know, we obviously
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_00: wish that we had done that. What do you learn from that? Yeah, I have this too. I actively,
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_01: like, what do I learn from missing 11 labs from missing deal? My takeaway is very simple. I
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_01: thought I was smarter than markets. I thought I could forecast what open AI's product roadmap
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_01: would be in the case of 11 labs. And actually, I should have just 100% backed up the truck on
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_01: amazing found, but same with Alex the deal, payroll ADP paychecks.com. Yeah. But Alex is amazing.
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_01: Just by what's your takeaway from missing that B, which is is a mistake. Yeah. I think often the
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_00: takeaway is when we make an investment, we should always be investing in strength of strengths
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_00: as opposed to lack of weaknesses. And so this is a philosophy that comes from Ben that if you have
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_00: spiking strengths in a founder and a company, it's okay if their weaknesses are concerns.
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_00: Often the mistake will manifest itself as the fear of future competition,
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_00: like the fear of theoretical competition. So that's the perfect articulation of what you just
[00:23:47] SPEAKER_00: had for 11 labs and say, oh my gosh, aren't the labs going to do it? It's the old VC trope of,
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: you know, well, isn't Google going to do it or what happens if Facebook does this. And so
[00:23:58] if you overweight the fear of future theoretical competition, you can always talk yourself out of
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_00: making an investment. And so we try really, really hard not to do that. Other other mistakes,
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_00: you know, if we pass on great companies, it's because, you know, it's not because they're,
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_00: you know, the market leader, it's not because they have a good business model. It's because we
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_00: think the market might be too small. Those are mistakes too. Like we always underestimate the size
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_00: of a market and we have fun stories about that all over the place. We do, but it's just certainly
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_01: I just did a show where the guests talked about the time trap, which is like, why SaaS is like Japan,
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_01: which is like shrinking population, shrinking seats. And actually, time's being smaller than we
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_01: thought. And whether it's your drop boxes or your Twilios or your Pager duties.
[00:24:48] Yeah, look, I think many of the incumbents, I call them the new incumbents and the new incumbents are
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_00: in much better position. I would say then like the license, you know, license incumbents
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_00: when SaaS came along. If I were to rank order the level of disruption that is coming for these
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: companies, business model shift is number one. And so, you know, we can talk about examples where
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_00: that's most in practice today, you know, Sarah and Kimberly from our side led investment investments
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_00: in Decagon. Customer service is the most obvious one where you can certainly price, you know,
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_00: based on completion of a task. And it's better, faster, cheaper value props than customers. So,
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_00: if you are going to compete with a seat-based customer service thing, look out, that's hard.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_00: And that's a business model shift. So, that's like the most disruptive piece. The second most
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_00: disruptive piece I would argue is UI and workflow. And then the third most disruptive piece is access
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_00: to data. So, what data do you actually access? And so, if you have all three of those that undertake
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_00: major change at the same time, I think you've got a really good chance for a startup to come and
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_00: beat, beat the income, the new income, and if you will. I just never in a million years would have
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: thought that the big software companies could be as large as they are. And so, I have to think that
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_00: this next wave probably presents the opportunity for this next generation to be much larger than the
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_00: than the previous generation. And it doesn't mean, you know, they have to go eat all labor,
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_00: which is like, we have that on slides too. But I don't think in practice that's actually what
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_00: happens. I think in practice, what actually happens is there's massive surplus that gets
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_00: delivered to end customers. And you can still create much bigger companies than the previous
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_00: generation. I do think it does go about this is a great question though, which is like, we have
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_01: to see the transition of spend from technology budgets, also from human labor budgets to technology
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: because if we don't, then the time for technology spend just stays the same. And we've all just
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_01: overpaid a shit ton. Yeah, but the problem. So the only flaw in that logic is that has to be product
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_00: driven, not top down driven. Like that needs to be pulled from the market. That needs to be
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_00: like slapping the customers in the face that there's a value prop for them to go do that. As
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: opposed to CIOs or CEO saying, you know, we need to do AI stuff. And so let's shift labor, you know,
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_00: spend the I would say there's some encouraging data points. If you look at recent earnings reports,
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_00: there are a couple of companies and you got to like look kind of deep for these. But there are a
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_00: couple of companies that have started to show signs of actually running their business differently
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_00: and showing really high ROI from AI. So do you have you heard of C.A. Robinson?
[00:27:54] Laiya. It's a truck brokerage. So they take customers, you know, who need to ship stuff
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_00: and trucking companies and they broker deals between the two so that they can ship things.
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_00: And most of the industry in the US is actually intermediated. You know, it's not direct, you know,
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_00: it's not direct like the trucking industry is very fragmented. So this is a this is a large business.
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_00: And you know, historically they've had like football field sized call centers of people making phone
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_00: calls and connecting dots. They just disclosed in their last earnings that they saw a 40%
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_00: productivity increased, increased measured in shipments per person per day in their core business
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_00: since the end of 2022. 40% increase. It's an incredible and it's it's AI driven. And so what's
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_00: actually happened is their operating margin has gone up 680 basis points. And so, you know,
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: like that's very effective implementation of AI. And so, you know, people always ask they're like,
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_00: oh, well, is there real usage, you know, are we in a bubble all this stuff? But that just proves
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_01: that that just proves what I said to be true though, which is like the transition of human labor
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_01: to technology is fundamentally necessary for us to have a great business. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_00: think it will happen. I think we'll have I'm saying you're seeing green shoots. I don't think it
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_00: necessarily means that every SaaS company is doomed. But, you know, even Microsoft has reduced their
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_00: head count by 6% over the last year or so. I do think it means you're going to tap out there.
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_01: You know, sadly, I'm a big child and Monday.com in Juolingo. And you know, one of our recent
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_01: guests who's a dear friend of mine is like, yeah, but there's exactly the problem. There's no human
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_01: labor replacement there. And unless you have a human labor replacement story in public markets,
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_01: today, you're not going to get the premium. Yeah. And I think that I think we'll see that. And I
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_00: think we'll see that. And I think it will come with a business model shift. I think, I mean,
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_00: you know, you're talking about the public markets like in the public markets today, you are guilty
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_00: until proven innocent. It's the it's the full flip side of our criminal justice system where you are
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_00: assumed that you are doomed by AI unless proven otherwise. And so I think there's probably opportunity.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_00: And you can see the way the, you know, the stock prices, you know, have gone.
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_00: I fortunately, that's not our world. I don't have to play in that world. We get to bet on the next
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_00: thing. But I do think that, you know, there's going to be a huge opportunity to shift that.
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_01: Speaking of the huge opportunities, some companies are taking advantage of them. And the
[00:30:28] SPEAKER_01: revenue scaling, dude, is just so much faster than any of us have ever seen before. We see the
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_01: race to 100 million error. I think you guys just did gamma, which is a product that awesome
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_01: products. Grant, it's got very fast 100. Does revenue mean as much as it used to when it's
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_01: gained so quickly and also seem so transient? Okay. So this is a great question because I think
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_00: this is where you have to be really discerning in the market. It does mean the same as it has before.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_00: If it is high retention and high engagement. And so this is the, the bar has actually gone up
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_00: significantly for us when we look at AI companies because it grown so fast. And so you can't actually
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_00: look at years of renewal behavior, but you can look at shorter cycles of retention. And you,
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_00: most importantly, can look at engagement. And so if people are using the product a lot and getting
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_00: a lot of value out of it, that's a really good leading indicator. And we can take comfort in that.
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_00: But we have spent way more time focused on that than we did in the previous generation.
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_00: It's so what makes companies like AMSO special, again, this is one of Sarah's deals.
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_00: One, heavily organic customer acquisition and two, really high engagement and retention.
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_00: And so we talked about the engagement and retention piece. It's magic when you have ease of
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_00: customer acquisition. You know, I've talked about this before. But you know, this is one of the
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_00: most impressive things that we're seeing in the AI companies. 11 labs has this. Chat GBT has this.
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_00: XAI has this where it's organic customer acquisition or, you know, very low cost sales acquisition,
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_00: a bridge, Harvey companies where like the market is just absolutely starving for their product.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_00: That's a really good sign. And so just because it grows really fast, doesn't mean it's going to
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_00: end up transient or lower quality. But the bar for assessing that is way higher than it used to be.
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_00: Totally. Yeah, that. The bar for other companies is also way higher. It seems. And my question to
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_01: that is, dude, I'm sitting on a lot of great enterprise software companies. And then, you know,
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_01: we were I was always taught, dude, that you're going to get great funding if you travel, travel,
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_01: double, double is travel, travel, double, double dead in this new world. I don't think it's dead
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_01: in this new world. I tend to think that companies are the number one way to measure a company is
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_00: ultimately return on invested capital. And so the way you do that with an early stage company,
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_00: mostly is efficiency of customer acquisition. And so not every company needs to go, you know,
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_00: zero to a hundred like it depends on what market they're in. But I do think the companies with AI,
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_00: if there's very sort of starving and customers, momentum gives you high momentum gives you a chance
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_00: to build a moat. And I think that's the most important thing about this sort of debate about
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_00: how high of growth is good enough. It's been on the market you're in. And some markets like they're
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_00: not going to move as fast, but in the markets that are moving really fast, if you're not moving
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_00: really fast, that's a risky place to be. But I think the most important thing about momentum is just
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_00: it's relative to your peer set. And so if your peer set is growing really fast and your
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_00: direct competitors are growing really fast, and it's high retention and customer acquisition is
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_00: relatively easy, you need to be growing really fast too. But the opportunity cost of cash is so
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_01: real. I grew to my other CEO of the day with the company in turn. I'm just like I completely agree,
[00:34:09] SPEAKER_01: it could be a very good way to build a very solid business over a long period of time. But the
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_01: opportunity cost of my cash is I could be in the next gamma Harvey lovable you name it. And so yeah,
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_01: it's it's good, but is it the best place for my precious dollars and for my LPs precious dollars?
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And you know, I think we spend all of our time thinking about like where is their market
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_00: pull? Right? Because those are the best places where you can build a company. Like all those
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_00: companies that you describe, there's extreme market pull. And the reason they've grown really fast
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_00: is not because they've poured tons of money into hiring sales reps. The reason they're going
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_00: very fast is because there's tremendous customer pull for them. And so we look for you know, we look
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_00: for those markets. I believe that Kingmaking does exist. And Kingmaking for those that don't
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_01: know is when a finance is able to bluntly invest so much that they are unable able to annoying
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_01: to winner in a category. And that then leads to moats and everything that comes with it and ultimately
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_01: winning. Do you believe that Kingmaking exists or do you disagree that it exists? As we think about
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_00: investing in companies, so we always seek to invest in the winner. If the investment thesis is
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_00: our investment is going to make them a winner, it's probably a pretty flimsy investment thesis.
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_00: Now, an investment that we make in a company that is already attracting resources, hiring really
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_00: well, able to raise capital well, able to deploy more money into go-to-market, able to deploy
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_00: more money into R&D, it can generally help. Like this is the whole theory of preferential
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_00: attachment, which is, you know, why increasing returns to scale is a concept, right? Even if you're
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_00: not a network effect driven business, if you're salesforce.com or, you know, workday or service
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_00: now or crowd strike, the more you become the leader, the more resources come your way and the easier
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_00: things get for you potentially. And so we look for situations like that. I would contrast it
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_00: with situations, you know, like the original Softbank Vision Fund did a lot of really good things.
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_00: Honestly, they did a bunch of really good things and... Lightward, I genuinely want to be
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_00: educated today because I immediately shivered. They were early to figuring out that there would be
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_00: a huge opportunity in AI. So, you know, they famously were in Nvidia in that fund. You know, and they
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_00: did some really good investments like Slack, like Gardenet. The one piece of it was missing, in my
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_00: opinion, was that capital as a weapon was a viable strategy. So capital as a weapon in enterprise
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_00: is really, really hard to do because you physically have to hire people, you have to hire sales reps,
[00:36:52] SPEAKER_00: you have to hire marketing people, etc. Capital as a weapon in consumer. Most of the time, it doesn't
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_00: really work. Like I would say TikTok is maybe the exception, maybe Uber. But, you know, the thing
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: that maybe was wrong about it was we can king make if we just put the capital into the companies
[00:37:14] SPEAKER_00: and then that will allow them to win. But that's a bit of an adverse selection machine where the
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_00: companies that opt into that as their winning strategy are the ones that maybe don't have as good
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_00: of a reason to win or competitive advantage in the first place. And so if that money is going to go
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_00: back to consumers or drivers or whatever it is in that case and just get funneled back to Google
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_00: and Facebook. Like I don't think that king making for that is necessarily a good strategy. But,
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_00: you know, investing a lot of capital, having a brand that gives a seal of approval,
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_00: it can definitely help make a company succeed. And I think Mark and Ben have described it well
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_00: in the past. What are we giving to our founders? Partially, what we're giving to our founders is
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_00: a loan on our brand, a seal of approval. And often especially for those stage companies,
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_00: it really can help with hiring. Have you heard the talk track of what story you want to
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_00: be? We talk about that. You know, we, there's sort of a barbelling of the retail market. And
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_00: you know, there's basically, there's Amazon of Walmart on the one end, on the other end,
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_00: there's like extremely high-end retail. So we can move out Chanel, but yeah. Yeah, Chanel,
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_00: Zanya, this is where Europe really thrives. Yeah, there's scale players and then there's
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_00: specialists. And I think, you know, we're obviously a scale player. I think the risk is everything
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_00: in between, right? Department stores that have general merchandise, but don't have scale.
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_00: For example, and that's a very risky place to be. So our strategy is very much scale, build scale.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_00: And the reason we do that is because it gives a huge advantage from a resource's standpoint
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_00: to our portfolio companies. Totally get that and understand. Do you mind being like cool
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_01: boomer then? Like, it doesn't mean that really, but like, I love you, dude, but that looks like a
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_01: beautiful lower piano. There's nothing about you. There's nothing about you that screams
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: Walmart. Let's, we're happy to call ourselves Amazon.com, you know, customers love it. We're
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_00: very well served. We're Amazon. We're not Walmart. Okay, got you. Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: We mentioned like, he making competitive categories there. One, I just can't get over to,
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_01: and I've tweeted this is the customer support category because there's just like 50,
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_01: like there's so many. And like, Brat and Sierra is obviously like, you know, the OG of OGs of SaaS.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_01: Like, can you help me? Why am I wrong on being so confused by this space? Because there's just
[00:39:54] SPEAKER_01: something, something for every vertical. Yeah, well, I think there's a good reason why there's
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_00: excitement in the space. It's better, faster, cheaper already today with today's model quality,
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_00: with the reasoning capabilities, you know, with the cost of the models. And so you don't need to
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_00: believe any future state of a different product or a different, you know, model capability.
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_00: The functionality is there. And so, you know, I think there's good reason why, you know, we,
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_00: we, you know, we put on the EBCs for our portfolio companies. Every time Tecagon appears in one of
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_00: these EBCs, there's extremely high interest and, and, you know, most of the time conversion to a deal.
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_00: So I think the market pull, the market size is what is most interesting about that space.
[00:40:45] You know, Jesse and Ashman, this is, again, this is not my deal. It's Seren Kimberleys, but
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_00: they are special founders. They're really, really good. They're relentless. They're the kind of
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_00: founders that we really love to back. If you look at like SaaS and cloud markets, about half of them
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_00: are winner-take vast majority, like the overwhelming majority. And about half of them,
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_00: you know, they're sort of, sort of, break up of market share. So for example, you know, you
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_00: mentioned deal like payroll, payroll market, like payroll market is not a winner-take vast
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_00: majority market. There are many markets like this in SaaS and cloud. And so it's possible that,
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_00: you know, Tecagon is the winner and they move really fast on product and they win the market
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_00: based on having the best product and the best distribution and all the things that we talk about.
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_00: You know, or it's also possible that, you know, it's a, it's a sort of, you know, kind of more
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_00: distributed market, sort of like payroll. Either way, the growth is staggering. The market pull
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_00: is staggering. Tecagon for us is a great company. Love Jesse and love that. But how do you
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_01: just think about like the willingness to pay up ahead of time? Because that's kind of way,
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_01: you're going, which is that you're just paying so far ahead of time. You know, 10 billion for
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_01: Sierra is, is, is, is, is brand amazing. Yeah, but you legitimately are paying a fuck time I had
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_01: a time. Yeah, I don't know. We've, we've, we've not been close to that. Obviously, we're,
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_00: you know, we're existing investors in, in Tecagon. And so it's hard for you, but you would
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_00: take a gun on. How do you get you to say, okay, well, if the market continues in this way,
[00:42:18] SPEAKER_01: because if you map out expect to growth rates, you have to map out with a fricking LSD
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_01: gosses to see where this lands. Like you have to like, I'm not sure I would agree with that,
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_00: actually. Okay. I'm taking a company, not Decagon, at 50 million an error. You have to expect
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_01: that it will 5x to get to 250. And then 4x to get to a billion. And then 3x to get to 3 billion.
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_01: And then, which is all pretty optimistic, fucking growth rates. And then with a 6x in public
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_01: markets will 7x. We're looking at it, what 3x on the cash on the price that we're paying today.
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_01: Wow, that's not a good opportunity cost dollar span. I've been historically surprised at how good
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_00: the best companies can be and how fast they can grow, especially in markets that are early in
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_00: ings with a big technology shift. So I'm very optimistic. Those are abstract numbers. I also don't
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_00: think that every great high growth company will end up trading for six times in the public markets.
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_00: There are some that are going to trade higher based on very high growth rates or high cash flow.
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_00: And so it's hard to debate an abstract financial case. But for most of these companies that we've
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_00: backed, these winning apps, they're growing faster, 3x faster than predecessor, SaaS, and cloud
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_00: companies. And so, sure, high valuations from the outside, I think in many of those cases,
[00:43:48] everyone shits on them for margins. Do you think that's a really weak argument to shit on AI
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_01: apps? And do you think we'll just see the transformation of those margins pretty quickly over
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_01: the next two to five years? The history of technology inputs would suggest that the margins will
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_00: rationalize and the margins are going to go up. There's a high amount of uncertainty today.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_00: So it's possible that this next generation of companies is 50% gross margins. And you know,
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_00: that's if they're delivering a ton of value growing really fast, that's totally fine.
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_00: Today, the input costs per token have gone down massively, but token usage has also
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_00: gone up massively with the introduction of reasoning. So in the last year and a half or so,
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_00: it's been a bit of a muddy picture on the input costs. I think over time that will rationalize,
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_00: will go down. I think the market structure will end up sort of like cloud for the models where,
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_00: cloud costs for the average end customer are fine. And clouds in oligopoly and they make
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_00: high profits. I think the model companies that serve APIs will be relatively oligopolistic.
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_00: They'll probably have reasonably high margins. And the end customers will be pretty high-served or
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_00: well-served. On the gross margin point today, I'll say this, we give a little bit more of a pass
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_00: than we used to. And if we ever see a company that pitches us as an AI company and they have
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_00: SaaS gross margins, we ask a lot of questions because it probably means that people aren't actually
[00:45:24] SPEAKER_00: using the AI features. I do want to ask this too because I did listen to the show with Patrick.
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_01: And there was something that was interesting and struck me with it where you said, you look for
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_01: greatness lying where others don't. And the art of the pig more, in determining beauty where
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_01: it's not obvious. And I thought it was kind of interesting. And again, you can shit on me for
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_01: this. But your biggest position is the Andrew or Stripe and Open AI, which struck me as not exactly
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_01: diamonds in the rough. But my point being, I'm going to answer in a different way, which is
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_00: what I mean by finding beauty or opportunity is most of the time it's seeing a magnitude of
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_00: greatness that isn't totally obvious on the surface. And so when we've made original investments in
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_00: some of those companies, we invested in Andrew in the growth fund when they had one program of
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_00: record. And it was and it was border towers. And the bet was, can they be massively multi-product?
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_00: And now they have many, many programs of records, some of the coolest products in the market.
[00:46:46] SPEAKER_00: Open AI, we invested before they had Tragicipatee. And so often there's an opportunity
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_00: where we see things that may be great in the future, even if the companies themselves are already
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_00: great or hot. We set up our errors of a mission. What error of a mission lingers on your mind? What
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_01: company are you not in that you would most like to be in and why? So for me, it's Ravalued. It
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_01: actually upsets me every day that I'm not in Ravalued. I use it. I love it. It upsets me.
[00:47:18] I have a lot of errors of a mission. I have many dating back like deep in my career.
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_00: Door to Ashley, it's 700. What one really lingers? For me, it's Ravalued and Deal.
[00:47:34] Yeah, for current companies on the model side, Anthropic has done a really great job. We're not
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_00: investors in Anthropic. They've done a really good job. It's one of those cases where
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_00: similar to cloud, if you could own all of AWS, Azure, and GCP is independent companies.
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_00: That would suit you pretty well. That's one of those markets that was not winner-take-all,
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_00: even though it's a scale market. It's sort of oligopolistic. If the model companies turn out to be
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_00: similar, given how much we expect demand to grow, that's probably one. Do you think the market
[00:48:16] will evolve with OpenAI winning consumer and Anthropic winning dev and B2B?
[00:48:22] Yeah, I think they actually will diverge in pretty meaningful ways. This is sort of what we've
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_00: seen in historical technology markets, but I think each will try and remain competitive in their
[00:48:35] SPEAKER_00: spaces. B2B Anthropic is certainly putting more resource after it today. OpenAI is going to have
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_00: a really good B2B business. They already do. I think that market is going to be pretty competitive.
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_00: General B2B API usage and moving up into the application stack, both of them are obviously
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_00: trying to do that. That market is going to be pretty competitive. I think Google will play
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_00: some part in that market, but the big head-to-head competition will come between OpenAI and Anthropic.
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_00: On the consumer side, I think it's ChatGPT, like ask my family in Kentucky. What do they use?
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_00: What is AI? They know ChatGPT. They use ChatGPT extensively. Google is going to take a crack
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_00: at NAR, trying to compete in that market. But I think brand and the best product in the
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: market can take you a really, really long way. As we have underwritten future rounds of OpenAI
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_00: or later rounds of OpenAI, it's very much with the mind of consumer. At what point does the
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_01: entry price do you think for OpenAI become not a good use of dollars? This is one thing where I'm
[00:49:53] SPEAKER_01: permanently reflecting on it myself. Whereas if you think it's a $2 trillion company, well,
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_01: you can still see a 4-inch remit. At what point does the opportunity cost no longer make it worth it?
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_01: We have to constantly reassess this. Again, you should look back at our investment case for
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_00: investing in Databricks in 2019. We did an investment out of our growth fund. It was one of our
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_00: first investments. It was a large growth fund investment in fund 1 at $6 billion. In our investment
[00:50:25] SPEAKER_00: case, never what they predicted. We have to constantly push ourselves and think about
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_00: I've been surprised at how big and absolute dollar terms the companies can be and how good they
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_00: can be. We constantly have to push ourselves on this. The example I always use is Google and Facebook
[00:50:48] SPEAKER_00: 10 years ago, Google and Facebook were monetizing their users at like one-seventh of what they
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_00: are today. It's hard to forecast that. It's hard to model that. It would be limiting to think
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_00: you're ever at an in-state of productivity or in-state of new products. We've been surprised. We
[00:51:08] SPEAKER_00: like to invest in the ones where there's a theory on how the core market can be bigger than we
[00:51:13] SPEAKER_00: would expect or others would expect. Stripe is an example of this. SpaceX with Starlink is an
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_00: example of this. Wemo when we invested as an example of this. We also like to invest in the ones
[00:51:25] SPEAKER_00: where we feel like the founders have an advantage in figuring out the next product. And so Andrew
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_00: is a perfect example of this. We knew border towers would be a huge product line. But with the team,
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_00: we were also pretty high confidence that they were going to figure out a bunch of other stuff.
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't have predicted that they figured out autonomous fighter jets, which is pretty awesome.
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_00: But the best ones, the best ones who know their markets the best, who have market leadership,
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_00: who are product people, who are tech people, they tend to find the next product areas. And that's
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_00: what we want to find. At scale and at scale you are, do you just say, hey, we have to invest in
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_01: competitors. You can't not. No, we don't. When we invest, we try to avoid conflicts, best we can.
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_00: Especially if we're on the board. It's the trickiest part of scale of our business.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_00: And we don't always get it right there. We need to delicately do it between funds and be like,
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_01: oh, that's in the early fund. We try not to do that. We try not to do that. I mean, look, the
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_00: the thing that we see that more often happens is companies diverge. More often than they converge.
[00:52:32] SPEAKER_00: And so the perception of what a conflict can be in the future, like often doesn't come into play.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, there are also examples in the opposite where we funded a company and then they pivoted
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_00: and they pivoted it into a different space. And we try and help the founders much we can't
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_00: even if that's the case. What decision did you and Mark and Van most disagree on?
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_01: What was the outcome? What were your views? It's very divergent. How did that resolve itself?
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_01: The biggest one was our original investment in Waymo. So we invested in Waymo in early 2020.
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_00: So we were the only VC fund that invested in Waymo in early 2020. It was extraordinary. I mean,
[00:53:15] SPEAKER_00: the product was magic even at the time. We did demo rides. This was obviously well before.
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_00: They were everywhere on the road. We did demo rides. It could drive smoother than a human. They
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_00: could do unprotected laughs. They could avoid construction sites. They could do all these really
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_00: special things that you wouldn't think that autonomous car could do at the time.
[00:53:38] SPEAKER_00: But at the time, they didn't have a product in the market. I thought the valuation was really high.
[00:53:47] SPEAKER_00: I said, here's all this analysis in our team. We produce those analysis that show that the price
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_00: was really high. Mark and Van were like, it's autonomous driving. What are you talking about?
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_00: This is the endless market size. This can be the biggest company in consumer technology.
[00:54:07] SPEAKER_00: They're the market leader. The way we did it was we invested a small amount at the time,
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_00: just given we were conflicting points of view on it. But that served us well because we kept a
[00:54:17] SPEAKER_00: close relationship with the team and we wrote a much larger check into their most recent round.
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_00: I'm really excited about it. They have a very exciting future. I'm going to San Francisco after
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_00: this. I am going to take Waymo on the freeway up to our office in San Francisco from Palo Alto.
[00:54:36] SPEAKER_00: That's a magical product experience. This is one of those cases. We talked earlier about
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_00: potential future competition. This is one of those cases where there's going to be tremendous
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_00: potential future competition. But the product in the market today is magical.
[00:54:53] SPEAKER_00: There was just an op-ed written in New York Times that was done by a medical professional.
[00:55:01] SPEAKER_00: He said, we now have enough data from Waymo that shows they are 7 to 10 acts safer than a human
[00:55:08] SPEAKER_00: driver. When we see results like this in clinical trials in the healthcare industry,
[00:55:13] SPEAKER_00: we fast-track the drug into full approval and just get it in the market because the benefits are
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_00: so great. He was comparing that to Waymo, which is like, how many deaths are there on the roads per
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_00: year? It would be irresponsible to block this, let alone not fast-track approval of it.
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_00: It's going to be the mother of all markets. I think autonomous driving and robotics are
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_00: maybe the mother of all markets that are coming on AI. I'm always quite annoyed about it because
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: I always see it on social and we didn't have it in London and I've never been in one.
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_01: They'll try to get full on in soon. London is a tough market to enter. You remember what it was
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_00: like for Uber to enter London in the first place. It got brought into the market kicking and screaming.
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_00: But one day in Tokyo, there'll be some of the best international markets possible for autonomous
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_00: driving. That I understand. What I just don't understand that I would love to is flow. Can you help
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_01: me understand flow? Because I think the world kind of scratched their head. Why did it make sense to
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_01: you when it didn't make sense to anyone else? You remember what I said earlier about investing
[00:56:15] SPEAKER_00: behind strength of strengths? Yeah. Adam has extraordinary strengths. He has some of the strongest
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_00: strengths of anybody, any entrepreneur in the market. It doesn't mean that he has no weaknesses.
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_00: But he absolutely spikes in the areas that are most important for the business he's trying to build.
[00:56:35] SPEAKER_00: What would you say there's aught? Because I'm not in those meetings and no one is. I'm fast.
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_01: Where was he world class? He's world class at brand building, company building, product,
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_00: and hiring. When I say, well, those sound like things that are maybe a little fuzzy,
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_00: but they're not. They're the most important ingredients for early stage company building.
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_00: He's surrounded himself with an extraordinary team. He's got an incredible insight,
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_00: which I think is fascinating. Consumers in the US, obviously, home ownership is declining
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_00: rapidly and people are unable to buy homes. There's a whole political and social issue with that.
[00:57:19] SPEAKER_00: But it's the reality of the case. The average renter in the US spends 30% of their disposable income
[00:57:26] SPEAKER_00: on rent. It's the highest amount of spend of any category. Yet it's the only unbranded experience
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_00: in anyone's life. If you think about the food you eat, the clothes you wear, the car you drive,
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_00: the places you go, all of those are branded experiences and consumers pay a premium for that branded,
[00:57:47] SPEAKER_00: better experience. His idea was what if you actually brought brand and a better product experience
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_00: to a renter's life? There's a huge market opportunity for it. There's a great business model
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_00: that goes with it. If there's anybody who can do that, given the intersection of real estate and
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_00: brand, I think it's Adam. If you think about the average entrepreneur walks in off the street
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_00: and pitches us an idea, what is the likelihood that Adam can build a humongous company versus
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_00: the average entrepreneur? It's extremely high. It doesn't mean that it's not without risk, but he
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_00: has extremely strong strengths. That's the theory behind it. The founder of CUM, I walk with every
[00:58:32] SPEAKER_01: week and he always asks me one question. He goes, how often do you meet a founder like this?
[00:58:38] SPEAKER_01: Once a month, don't write the fucking check. Once every six months, probably write the check.
[00:58:43] SPEAKER_01: How often do you meet a founder like Adam? I don't know. You can answer me on your data set,
[00:58:48] SPEAKER_01: but it's probably quite rare in which case you're like, well, then write the fucking check.
[00:58:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, and it's extremely rare. Adam is a learner. He is like a deep
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_00: student of the game that he's in. I'm really excited about Flow, Mark and Ben and I are all
[00:59:08] SPEAKER_00: involved in adjusting for more team. They've proven out the value prop of the product and now it's
[00:59:16] SPEAKER_00: just about scaling. Dude, can I do a quick fire on with you? What have you changed your mind on
[00:59:20] SPEAKER_01: in the last 12 months? Like mine was Andrewson. Oh, that's good. I like it.
[00:59:26] SPEAKER_01: Andrewson and YC. YC is the single biggest buy, I think, in venture. Every great European company is a YC
[00:59:34] SPEAKER_01: company. Everyone. They've crushed international, like for what it's worth. I mean, and they're really,
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_00: really good in the US. Like I, yeah, they're really good. And I'm a big fan of Gary.
[00:59:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I don't know if it's in the last 12 months, but if you think about the moment that all of the
[00:59:57] SPEAKER_00: models started to demonstrate their capabilities, I would say there was a moment in time where we
[01:00:03] SPEAKER_00: thought that the models would eat everything in consumer and enterprise software. And I think
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_00: maybe there's a bit of a shift back toward this in public markets at least that the models are
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_00: going to eat all these application software categories. We've fully changed our mind. I think
[01:00:21] SPEAKER_00: there's going to be application software companies built on top of models in pretty much every
[01:00:26] SPEAKER_00: direction. And so if you look at our investing behavior, it obviously reflects that. That's probably
[01:00:32] SPEAKER_00: a little bit further back. That's probably more like 18 to 24 months ago. But we sort of all thought
[01:00:38] SPEAKER_00: at first, like the models will just do everything and subsume everything. And it turns out there's
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_00: tons of stuff you have to do around the tasks that humans do in order to build a viable product.
[01:00:50] SPEAKER_00: The example I like to give, I know it's a lightning round, but radiology,
[01:00:56] SPEAKER_00: like AI has been able to do a better job than human radiologists, like prior to this whole wave,
[01:01:02] SPEAKER_00: like neural nets were able to do a better job than human radiologists and looking at scans.
[01:01:07] SPEAKER_00: And yet since the proliferation of AI, the number of radiologists has actually gone up.
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_00: It hasn't declined. And so why is that the case? It turns out that radiologists only spend 30 to 40%
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_00: of their time looking at the scans. There's another 60 to 70% of their time doing all the other stuff.
[01:01:29] SPEAKER_00: And so the model companies aren't going to go do the work to figure out how to automate the other
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_00: stuff, the 60 to 70%, but that's what what the opportunity would represent for an independent
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_00: company in that space. Does that make sense? I know it does. And I 100% agree that we've got a
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_01: business called Solve Intelligence, which is like patent law AI. No way they're going there. Agree.
[01:01:50] SPEAKER_01: But I open AI, I have the nuance of like, open AI, I are doing customer support.
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_01: Jam and I and Google have just released, build anything or build anywhere or whatever the
[01:02:00] SPEAKER_01: fuck that lovable competitor is called. They are moving into the application layer in ways that
[01:02:07] SPEAKER_01: we didn't know they would. Yeah, but it's one of them. 30 things in their AI
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_00: divisions that they're trying to do. It's sort of like how AWS and the cloud have service offerings
[01:02:18] SPEAKER_00: for basically everything that you could possibly have. And yet there's still tons of infrastructure
[01:02:22] SPEAKER_00: companies that are independent. Dude, you've met many great founders. One first founder meeting
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_01: that was most memorable. I'm not asking for the best founder. I'm just saying like the most
[01:02:32] SPEAKER_01: memorable first founder meeting. Okay, so there are more extreme success versions of founders that
[01:02:41] SPEAKER_00: I've backed in over time who I've got to know. One of the ones that struck me recently was the first
[01:02:48] SPEAKER_00: meeting I had dinner with one of my partner Santiago with Shiv from a bridge. And I didn't know what
[01:02:58] SPEAKER_00: necessarily to expect. I knew he was a doctor practicing cardiologist. I knew that he was making a
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_00: lot of progress in his market. But he was one of these perfect archetypes where he knows his end
[01:03:11] SPEAKER_00: market. He knows his product. He knows the technology. And yet is a total killer. Like he's this
[01:03:19] SPEAKER_00: great bedside man or cardiologist, but an absolute killer. And so I love going to have those first
[01:03:25] SPEAKER_00: meetings and you can already feel that. Yeah, to remind me of Winston at Harvey, which is like you
[01:03:30] SPEAKER_01: feel the authenticity to the core domain. But then it's like not the elegance of that domain,
[01:03:36] SPEAKER_01: like the aggression of attack founder with the academic nature of the core domain. Do you not
[01:03:41] SPEAKER_01: have any? Yeah, of course. Like this is like, you know, it's actually a really good archetype in
[01:03:47] SPEAKER_00: a lot of the vertical software categories. But you know, you can definitely see it with with those
[01:03:52] SPEAKER_00: folks. And honestly, like speed of execution aggression is a huge part of success in those
[01:03:57] SPEAKER_00: categories. Totally get you. You've got a seed from you've got a series A from and you've
[01:04:02] SPEAKER_01: got a growth firm that you have to invest in other than Andreessen, which you put your money
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_01: into. Obviously 20 VC. Very sweet. Thank you. So I can help you out. So I put my seed hummingbird
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_01: series A benchmark growth, either you or Pat. I'm not just saying that, but I just think scale is
[01:04:27] SPEAKER_01: super important and brand is super important. All Napoleon at founders fund. One of the three.
[01:04:32] SPEAKER_01: I think those guys are all great. I have tons of respect for all those guys. You know, we end up
[01:04:37] SPEAKER_00: doing rounds together. We're in companies together. You know, I think they're all great.
[01:04:41] SPEAKER_00: Who is not in Andreessen? Who you would most like to work with? I think the best would be,
[01:04:49] SPEAKER_00: you know, we partnered a lot with Nat and Daniel when they were still on the field. And so,
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_00: you know, if they wanted to, you know, actually, I guess they were off the field when they're
[01:05:00] SPEAKER_00: investing. They got back on the field to do real jobs now. But if they were to come back off the
[01:05:05] SPEAKER_00: field, I think it would be fun to work with them. My would be Leifixel, the Guides ability to
[01:05:09] SPEAKER_01: predict and forecast markets like 10 year vision plan. I think it's really amazing. All phantom
[01:05:16] SPEAKER_01: clarity of thought phantom could make a fucking plastic bag seem like it's like made by Jesus.
[01:05:23] SPEAKER_01: Seriously, he's amazing. Anything just sounds poetic. Who is the best picker in Andreessen?
[01:05:30] SPEAKER_01: There are a bunch of really, really talented people at the early stage. I love that I get to
[01:05:34] SPEAKER_00: learn from these people all the time. I think the people at the early stage that have developed
[01:05:42] SPEAKER_00: the most clarity of thought on approach to early stage investing. Like, I think it's Dixon.
[01:05:48] SPEAKER_00: You know, he's, you know, he obviously runs our crypto funds now. But, you know, he's,
[01:05:53] SPEAKER_00: he's got a generalist background as well. He's been doing this for a really long time.
[01:05:57] SPEAKER_00: And I think he has the sort of clearest articulation of what our early stage strategy is,
[01:06:01] SPEAKER_00: which has been adopted, I would say, across the firm. But he, I think he has the clearest,
[01:06:07] SPEAKER_00: clearest view on it. When you need to win something internally in Andreessen, who's the
[01:06:11] SPEAKER_01: savage that you bring into win? Mark him that. You can choose one. They're both exceptional.
[01:06:22] SPEAKER_00: It depends on what the founder wants. How does that differ? Love to know. I'll tell you what the spikes
[01:06:29] SPEAKER_00: on both of them from my vantage point. I mean, look, they're both exceptional at like every
[01:06:32] SPEAKER_00: element of the job. You know, Mark can see the future. Like, Mark, if you give Mark any 10-year
[01:06:38] SPEAKER_00: prediction, like, or he will give you 10-year predictions, they're very often right. Like, most of
[01:06:44] SPEAKER_00: the time they're right. And he's often, you know, high on magnitude and it ends up being justified
[01:06:52] SPEAKER_00: in the future. And so, you know, things that may seem, you know, too high or too crazy, like,
[01:06:58] SPEAKER_00: in the fullness of time, he's generally right. He, you know, he knows consumer internet
[01:07:03] SPEAKER_00: extremely well. You know, he spikes there. Ben, Ben is probably the best
[01:07:11] SPEAKER_00: management coach or understanding of executive dynamics and problems that I've ever encountered.
[01:07:20] SPEAKER_00: You know, he also is a futuristic thinker. But, you know, he sort of spikes in that way,
[01:07:26] SPEAKER_00: you know, and then Mark spikes in the, in the seeing the future way.
[01:07:30] Who's the most helpful post investment? I think about the pillars of venture, which is like
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_01: finding, winning and helping. Internally, he's the like, the founders just love him. He helps so
[01:07:41] SPEAKER_01: well. Who internally is the best helper? Obviously, you have portfolio services, I get that.
[01:07:47] SPEAKER_01: I can't pick one of these. There's too many. They're, they're like, I mean,
[01:07:51] SPEAKER_00: yeah, I can't pick one. That it would be unfair to pick one. It's funny. I wouldn't mind.
[01:07:57] SPEAKER_01: Like, I'm not a helper. Yeah, I'm here. I wouldn't be offended if, if, like, I, I mean,
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_00: obviously, I am, but like, but ultimate one, if you could change anything within
[01:08:08] SPEAKER_01: side-owned recent, what would you change? I wouldn't change this. But one of the elements
[01:08:13] SPEAKER_00: about us scaling has been we've had to decentralize the way we run our business, right?
[01:08:19] SPEAKER_00: And so when I first joined the firm, we used to sit around in partner meetings all day
[01:08:26] SPEAKER_00: on Mondays and hear all the pitches from all the various sectors on Mondays and then on Fridays,
[01:08:32] SPEAKER_00: too. And so, obviously, that's not a scalable approach to doing venture, especially given,
[01:08:39] SPEAKER_00: we're in a bunch of different sectors now. But selfishly, at the growth fund side,
[01:08:44] SPEAKER_00: like that was extremely high signal, great information, you know, tons of tons of so
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_00: with all the best thinkers. Did it not make you a better investor? Seeing that, it made
[01:08:56] SPEAKER_00: you so I think we have to go out of our way to go get that information in signal now. And so,
[01:09:03] SPEAKER_00: it's, it actually has made us a better business at the early stage. And then as long as we're
[01:09:08] SPEAKER_00: coordinating right from early stage, you know, through growth, it'll make us better, but we have to
[01:09:13] SPEAKER_00: seek it out and do a little bit more work to get all that information. Final one for you, dude.
[01:09:18] SPEAKER_01: What are you most excited about for today? Like, I look at the world and I'm very excited for the
[01:09:24] SPEAKER_01: first time I'm like, I can tell my mom that there's hope for MS sufferers that they might actually
[01:09:29] SPEAKER_01: be treatment. I like tons of optimism. I like happiness. I think there's not enough of it in the
[01:09:34] SPEAKER_01: world, despite my cynical disposition most of the time. What are you most excited for?
[01:09:40] SPEAKER_01: On the personal side, I'm really excited. And by the way, these are two areas that I think over
[01:09:46] SPEAKER_00: the next 10 years are going to be really exciting and really investable, but they're kind of early
[01:09:51] SPEAKER_00: today. One is personal health. So, you know, it's, it's a little bit related to your point, but more
[01:09:58] SPEAKER_00: health management. I was with a really talented entrepreneur. Well, he's a former large company
[01:10:05] SPEAKER_00: executive and he's thinking about starting a company. And his extreme version of it was, you know,
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_00: tracking and AI coaching that happens for you that explains the trade-offs of every decision
[01:10:16] SPEAKER_00: you make. That's a little bit too extreme, but, you know, more proactive, more involved management
[01:10:22] SPEAKER_00: of personal health. I think it's something that's going to happen. You know, it's one of these
[01:10:26] SPEAKER_00: large consumer categories that hasn't really hit yet. But I think it's going to happen.
[01:10:30] SPEAKER_00: Can you imagine wearing a brace that, and every time I e-picked up a cookie, it's like, hot disease,
[01:10:35] SPEAKER_01: you just took off, you just took off, you know, 17 minutes of your life. So, I think that's too
[01:10:41] SPEAKER_00: extreme, but I do think that there's a positive version of that that, you know, could be, could be
[01:10:46] SPEAKER_00: super valuable. It'd be good for society, but I would love it as a consumer. And I think the
[01:10:51] SPEAKER_00: technology capabilities are going to be there, you know, pretty shortly. The other is robotics.
[01:10:56] SPEAKER_00: You know, we have not made a large investment in robotics, but I think it's going to be the
[01:11:00] SPEAKER_00: largest category in AI, B2C, B2B. You know, there's still kind of debate on what the right form
[01:11:08] SPEAKER_00: factors are, whether it's at home help, whether it's industrial, like all these things. But I do think
[01:11:14] SPEAKER_00: 10 years down the road, we're all going to have like really helpful robotics assistance in B2C and
[01:11:20] SPEAKER_00: B2B. And so I think it's going to be super exciting as a consumer, but I also think as an investor,
[01:11:27] SPEAKER_00: it's going to, it's going to present some awesome opportunities.
[01:11:30] Do you want me to be honest, I feel pretty guilty because I like, I freaking love you. You're
[01:11:34] SPEAKER_01: such a lovely, wonderful dude. You really are. And I feel like I just batted you with hard guys.
[01:11:40] SPEAKER_01: You went hard.
