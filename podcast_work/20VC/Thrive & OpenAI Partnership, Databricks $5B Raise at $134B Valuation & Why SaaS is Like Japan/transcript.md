[00:00:00] Google did a cord red three years ago on them,
[00:00:03] and now they're doing a cord red back.
[00:00:04] Unknown Guest: How much extra in multiple do you pay
[00:00:07] Unknown Guest: for how much extra in growth?
[00:00:09] Unknown Guest: The majority of the public ask on it
[00:00:11] Jason Calacanis: is I think are in a ham trap.
[00:00:12] Jason Calacanis: Overpayment only works when the time is huge.
[00:00:15] Unknown Guest: In finite times, you got a bit more tightly.
[00:00:19] Unknown Guest: The SaaS has become like Japan.
[00:00:21] Jason Calacanis: It's a great economy, but if everyone only has point nine kids,
[00:00:25] Jason Calacanis: I mean, there's only only so many seats to go around.
[00:00:28] Jason Calacanis: I think in the fastest drawing companies that I've invested in,
[00:00:31] Jason Calacanis: no one gives a rat ass about the bottom line.
[00:00:34] Ready to go?
[00:00:46] OK, so this is going to be a live pod,
[00:00:49] Harry Stebbings: which makes me inherently nervous and excited at the same time.
[00:00:54] Harry Stebbings: For those that don't know, this is the show every week
[00:00:56] Harry Stebbings: where we discuss the biggest news in SaaS,
[00:00:59] Harry Stebbings: in tech with no politics.
[00:01:01] Harry Stebbings: And so we're going to start with thrive partnering with OpenAI.
[00:01:07] Harry Stebbings: How do we think about this partnership over to you guys?
[00:01:11] Harry Stebbings: The quick answer would be, we'll definitely talk about it,
[00:01:14] Unknown Guest: but it doesn't matter.
[00:01:15] Unknown Guest: I think the interesting thing, Harry, is that that's not the OpenAI story anymore.
[00:01:19] Unknown Guest: That's the OpenAI story from a day ago.
[00:01:23] Unknown Guest: And the OpenAI story today is almost the exact opposite.
[00:01:26] Unknown Guest: It's the code red, focus on the core.
[00:01:29] Unknown Guest: It's almost like a statement that says,
[00:01:31] Unknown Guest: all the other things we've been doing, we ain't doing them now.
[00:01:33] Unknown Guest: We're just going to be fixing our core product.
[00:01:36] Unknown Guest: We're even pushing on ads,
[00:01:38] Unknown Guest: but they're even pushing on agents for healthcare,
[00:01:40] Unknown Guest: pushing that stuff back and really going all in on no distractions.
[00:01:45] Unknown Guest: So while I think this is an interesting announcement,
[00:01:47] Unknown Guest: and we'll definitely talk about it in a second,
[00:01:49] Unknown Guest: the Zoom Out comment is 24 hours later,
[00:01:52] Unknown Guest: that's not the zeitgeist at OpenAI anymore.
[00:01:55] Unknown Guest: The zeitgeist is, you know,
[00:01:57] Unknown Guest: Google did a code red three years ago on them,
[00:02:00] and now they're doing a code red back.
[00:02:01] Unknown Guest: The one thing that is kind of interesting to it is it's a reminder,
[00:02:04] Jason Calacanis: and this can be a little soul crushing as a founder,
[00:02:07] Jason Calacanis: there's like only a couple of deals that matter to VCs.
[00:02:10] So when you see a VC stand aboard for 20 years,
[00:02:14] Jason Calacanis: and you'll see them always hanging out with this one CO,
[00:02:17] Jason Calacanis: and Thrive has a lot of winners, right?
[00:02:19] Jason Calacanis: But this is a big winner, right?
[00:02:21] Jason Calacanis: And so anything you can do to go deeper with those founders
[00:02:25] Jason Calacanis: on your one or two winners, it's just,
[00:02:28] Jason Calacanis: it's parallel on steroids,
[00:02:29] Jason Calacanis: it's parallel with what you do with your week,
[00:02:31] Jason Calacanis: it's parallel with your deal flow,
[00:02:32] Jason Calacanis: it's parallel with, I mean, it's just,
[00:02:34] Jason Calacanis: so I don't totally get who's giving each other how much equity,
[00:02:38] Jason Calacanis: but I think it's a part about going as deep
[00:02:40] Jason Calacanis: with your winners humanly possible.
[00:02:42] Jason Calacanis: This is OpenAI investing in Thrive Holdings.
[00:02:45] Jason Calacanis: Yeah, yeah, but it's the same people, right?
[00:02:48] Jason Calacanis: It's still going deep on your winners.
[00:02:50] Jason Calacanis: Since I'm turning my VC fund into a holding company,
[00:02:53] Jason Calacanis: I'm putting a billionaire two over there, right?
[00:02:55] Jason Calacanis: And then I'm going even deeper with the number one company
[00:02:58] Jason Calacanis: that I've ever invested in.
[00:03:00] First of all, I think it's a great deal for Thrive
[00:03:02] Unknown Guest: because Jason's right, the whole trick in venture is,
[00:03:06] Unknown Guest: we try and pretend we matter,
[00:03:07] Unknown Guest: but in our hearts, we know our best companies matter,
[00:03:11] Unknown Guest: and the best marketing you can do
[00:03:12] Unknown Guest: is get as close as possible to your biggest deals.
[00:03:15] Unknown Guest: And Thrive, to give them a huge credit,
[00:03:18] Unknown Guest: put a bunch of money in to OpenAI in that,
[00:03:20] Unknown Guest: I think it was a 70 billion round.
[00:03:23] Unknown Guest: And we're there for Sam in the great fiasco of two years ago.
[00:03:28] Unknown Guest: So my guess is he's pretty down loyal.
[00:03:30] Unknown Guest: And this is a chance for them to get a halo effect
[00:03:35] Unknown Guest: as they on this initiative,
[00:03:36] Unknown Guest: and we'll talk about the specifics of the initiative
[00:03:38] Unknown Guest: in a second, but it's a huge halo effect.
[00:03:40] Unknown Guest: Because as you last speak, we've said,
[00:03:41] Unknown Guest: you go in with the OpenAI moniker,
[00:03:44] Unknown Guest: and you get some real attention.
[00:03:45] Unknown Guest: So it's awesome for Thrive.
[00:03:46] Unknown Guest: I agree, the advantage to OpenAI is much less clear.
[00:03:50] Unknown Guest: I'm not sure they're putting in money.
[00:03:52] Unknown Guest: In one of the press releases,
[00:03:53] Unknown Guest: they said they're going to get a lot of specific data
[00:03:56] Unknown Guest: from some of these verticals that Thrive is pushing into.
[00:03:59] Unknown Guest: But my guess is I know who was ecstatic this morning
[00:04:03] Unknown Guest: when that was announced, and who was like, yeah, whatever.
[00:04:06] That's pretty clear.
[00:04:07] Unknown Guest: Okay, we said about the importance of all winners,
[00:04:09] Harry Stebbings: and Brodie, you humbly said there,
[00:04:11] Harry Stebbings: it's all about our kind of star founders.
[00:04:13] Harry Stebbings: Data breaks is one of the stars
[00:04:15] Harry Stebbings: in the last generation or this generation.
[00:04:17] Harry Stebbings: That rumoured to be raising $5 billion
[00:04:20] Harry Stebbings: at $134 billion evaluation.
[00:04:23] Harry Stebbings: It's 32X 2025 sales, which are 4.1 billion.
[00:04:28] Harry Stebbings: They're at 55% year-on-year growth.
[00:04:32] Harry Stebbings: Is this actually cheap?
[00:04:34] Harry Stebbings: How did we analyze this one?
[00:04:36] Well, one called cheap, but reasonably,
[00:04:38] Unknown Guest: I mean, look, possibly reasonably priced.
[00:04:41] Unknown Guest: I mean, you start, because it actually,
[00:04:43] Unknown Guest: it's very convenient right now,
[00:04:45] Unknown Guest: because the direct competitor, Snowflake, is public,
[00:04:48] and exactly roughly the same revenue, around $4 billion,
[00:04:52] growing at 28%, value at 80 billion,
[00:04:56] Unknown Guest: for 20 times the revenues.
[00:04:58] And so it pulls it very nicely,
[00:05:00] Unknown Guest: the big picture of venture question,
[00:05:02] how much extra in multiple do you pay
[00:05:05] Unknown Guest: for how much extra in growth?
[00:05:07] And right here is the work example.
[00:05:09] Unknown Guest: It's like you can buy a profitable company
[00:05:11] Unknown Guest: doing $4 billion with 28% growth at 20 times.
[00:05:15] Unknown Guest: Or you can buy a unprofitable,
[00:05:18] Unknown Guest: but fast or accelerating company at 32, 33 times.
[00:05:23] Unknown Guest: And is that extra 25% of growth?
[00:05:26] Unknown Guest: Because I think Databricks is growing a legend,
[00:05:28] Unknown Guest: they're at 55%, not 25%.
[00:05:32] Unknown Guest: So you're getting 25% to 30% of extra growth.
[00:05:36] And the question is, is that work?
[00:05:39] Unknown Guest: First of all, you agree that's fundamental to the question
[00:05:41] Unknown Guest: you're asking, how much extra revenue multiple do you pay
[00:05:44] Unknown Guest: for how much extra growth?
[00:05:46] Would you agree, Harry?
[00:05:47] Unknown Guest: I agree with that.
[00:05:50] Unknown Guest: And I think what very quickly,
[00:05:53] Unknown Guest: because you do the math,
[00:05:54] Unknown Guest: and there's a bunch of things to do it.
[00:05:55] Unknown Guest: What you said yourself is,
[00:05:57] Unknown Guest: if that extra growth lasts for any length of time,
[00:06:01] extra growths work a shit ton to use a technical term,
[00:06:05] because you just, that compounding keeps going.
[00:06:07] Unknown Guest: So if that growth persists for like three or four years,
[00:06:11] Unknown Guest: then maybe that extra premium is worth every dollar
[00:06:14] Unknown Guest: and then some, then you start saying,
[00:06:16] Unknown Guest: how much extra for how much extra growth?
[00:06:18] Unknown Guest: And you kind of look at the public markets to figure it out.
[00:06:20] Unknown Guest: And then you discover something really funny.
[00:06:22] Unknown Guest: And Jason talked about this,
[00:06:24] Unknown Guest: there is literally only one public company
[00:06:28] Unknown Guest: going more than 30% and that's Palantir.
[00:06:30] Unknown Guest: And for the record, that's going at 50%
[00:06:33] wildly profitable and value that 80 times sales.
[00:06:37] So you just don't have a data set,
[00:06:39] Unknown Guest: publicly to assess this.
[00:06:40] Unknown Guest: I think the simple answer is,
[00:06:41] Jason Calacanis: it would be the second best public company
[00:06:43] Jason Calacanis: if it were public today.
[00:06:46] Jason Calacanis: And so it seems about right.
[00:06:50] Jason Calacanis: I mean, it's a good, it's a fun question.
[00:06:52] Jason Calacanis: The crazy thing is it continues to modestly accelerate.
[00:06:56] Yeah, it's just something that we just haven't seen before.
[00:06:59] Jason Calacanis: It's something we all have to adjust to
[00:07:01] Jason Calacanis: that you can continue to accelerate at this scale.
[00:07:04] Jason Calacanis: It justifies all the craziness we see eventually,
[00:07:08] Jason Calacanis: at least for now, because the headroom is still there.
[00:07:10] Jason Calacanis: I totally agree, Jason.
[00:07:12] Unknown Guest: And I'd forgotten that the reacceleration
[00:07:13] Unknown Guest: changes everything because I was going to say,
[00:07:15] Unknown Guest: when you develop that model of how much extra
[00:07:17] Unknown Guest: is 55 worth versus 25,
[00:07:20] Unknown Guest: you kind of make some of something of gradual deacceleration
[00:07:23] Unknown Guest: and gradual conversions,
[00:07:24] Unknown Guest: because that's the only rational thing to do.
[00:07:26] Unknown Guest: And then you can come up with a number.
[00:07:28] Unknown Guest: It's a high revenue multiple, still a number.
[00:07:30] Unknown Guest: You write, Jason, when when stop starts reaccelerating
[00:07:34] Unknown Guest: at scale, then it's almost hard to figure out the model.
[00:07:37] Unknown Guest: I mean, by definition, if it continues to reaccelerate
[00:07:40] Unknown Guest: just for the record, it's infinitely valuable,
[00:07:42] Unknown Guest: because that's just what the map says, right?
[00:07:44] Unknown Guest: So it's probably not going to be infinitely valuable,
[00:07:47] Unknown Guest: but it just points out the power of reacceleration at scale.
[00:07:51] Unknown Guest: If you can even stipulate, you know,
[00:07:53] going from 50 to 55 to 60 at scale, oh my God, there's each value.
[00:07:59] Unknown Guest: And it's actually, it's the same dynamic.
[00:08:00] Unknown Guest: It's why it's hard to value the big foundation models.
[00:08:04] Unknown Guest: It's the, you know, when a profit went
[00:08:06] Unknown Guest: through that pile of reacceleration this year at scale,
[00:08:10] Unknown Guest: everyone relies the model as well.
[00:08:12] Unknown Guest: And they just have to raise the estimates and raise the value.
[00:08:14] Unknown Guest: And that's why you saw that step function increase in valuation.
[00:08:17] Unknown Guest: Because you said reacceleration is really hard.
[00:08:20] Unknown Guest: We see it maybe one in three companies does it for a single year,
[00:08:24] Unknown Guest: only one in 10 does it for two years,
[00:08:26] Unknown Guest: very rarely seen reacceleration
[00:08:29] Unknown Guest: when you're already at 50% for God's sake.
[00:08:31] Unknown Guest: No, you're exactly right, Jason.
[00:08:32] Unknown Guest: That's the killer factor that makes it hard.
[00:08:35] Unknown Guest: So you end up saying yourself some versions, what you said earlier,
[00:08:37] Unknown Guest: some version of how big is the time?
[00:08:39] Unknown Guest: Because in the end, the only thing that stops something
[00:08:42] Unknown Guest: that's reacceleration at scale is when you hit the wall
[00:08:44] Unknown Guest: of well, you saw to everyone.
[00:08:46] It's a zoom thing.
[00:08:47] Unknown Guest: Yeah, just also reminds you that seeds for suckers.
[00:08:50] When you actually look at the certainty that you have
[00:08:52] Harry Stebbings: that data breaks has the three to five X from here,
[00:08:55] Harry Stebbings: you're absolutely right.
[00:08:56] Harry Stebbings: When you think about opportunity,
[00:08:57] Harry Stebbings: I can put my money here or here, risk adjusted and time adjusted.
[00:09:01] Harry Stebbings: You could make a very coherent case
[00:09:02] Harry Stebbings: that it is a better deal to put your money into a data brace,
[00:09:05] Harry Stebbings: or like your client apart can do with an anthropic at 180 billion,
[00:09:09] Harry Stebbings: that it is put your money into a much less certain series B
[00:09:12] Harry Stebbings: with a seven to 10 year duration from there.
[00:09:16] Yeah, or just a seed pre-seed deal at 60 posts on a safe.
[00:09:22] Jason Calacanis: It's just how it's how the data breaks into like a better table.
[00:09:25] Jason Calacanis: But 60 posts?
[00:09:26] Harry Stebbings: It's quite cheap for a cheap amount.
[00:09:28] Harry Stebbings: Honestly, it's getting worse.
[00:09:31] Harry Stebbings: Snowflakes up year to date 60%.
[00:09:33] Harry Stebbings: And we're seeing the reacceleration of data breaks.
[00:09:36] Harry Stebbings: Did they just both grow into absolute monsters?
[00:09:40] Harry Stebbings: Can they peacefully coexist?
[00:09:42] Harry Stebbings: Do you think one takes majority market share?
[00:09:45] Harry Stebbings: I had wrong grubrisco, their CRO on our 20 sales podcast.
[00:09:48] Harry Stebbings: And he was like data braces technology is five years ahead,
[00:09:51] Harry Stebbings: which I thought was a really interesting statement.
[00:09:53] Harry Stebbings: Do you think they peacefully coexist?
[00:09:55] Harry Stebbings: Does one take monopoly?
[00:09:57] Harry Stebbings: How does that look?
[00:09:58] Harry Stebbings: I mean, Ron was correct.
[00:09:59] Unknown Guest: They came from slightly different places at slightly different times.
[00:10:03] Unknown Guest: Snowflake originally was very much your SQL data warehouse in the cloud.
[00:10:08] Unknown Guest: It was a few years earlier than data breaks,
[00:10:11] Unknown Guest: which was originally I think the Kafka product and all about moving data.
[00:10:16] And more AI use cases even out of the gate.
[00:10:20] So he is correct in that.
[00:10:22] Unknown Guest: I mean, no one's going to coexist peacefully.
[00:10:24] Unknown Guest: They probably hate each other.
[00:10:25] Unknown Guest: And we know they hate each other because they
[00:10:26] Unknown Guest: time their sales event to overlap with each other.
[00:10:30] Unknown Guest: I mean, I would say different now.
[00:10:32] Unknown Guest: They're not going to court and court peacefully coexist.
[00:10:34] Unknown Guest: They're going to struggle and fight against each other
[00:10:37] Unknown Guest: for the next 10 years, just like SAP and Oracle
[00:10:39] Unknown Guest: fought against each other for the last 20.
[00:10:42] Unknown Guest: They're going to want each other's lunch.
[00:10:45] Unknown Guest: And it's going to be a grind.
[00:10:47] I mean, I don't think any of them folds from here.
[00:10:49] Unknown Guest: It's hard to imagine.
[00:10:52] The core value of relational database isn't going away for transactions.
[00:10:56] Unknown Guest: So kind of the Snowflake asset is money good.
[00:10:59] Unknown Guest: And then separately, I think one is correct.
[00:11:02] Unknown Guest: Databricks has more of a advantage in brand new AI-centric data manipulation,
[00:11:09] Unknown Guest: data movement applications.
[00:11:10] Unknown Guest: So both are in good adjacent overlapping markets.
[00:11:13] Unknown Guest: They want a bit of each other's market that's just going to slug it out.
[00:11:17] It probably means at some point,
[00:11:18] Unknown Guest: that someone else margins getting a little bit.
[00:11:20] Unknown Guest: But you've seen it before.
[00:11:21] Unknown Guest: You've seen it as if they were Oracle, Cybase, and InformX.
[00:11:24] Unknown Guest: You've seen it with Workday, SAP, and Oracle.
[00:11:27] Unknown Guest: This is just what, I mean, Jason knows,
[00:11:30] most enterprise software markets tend to be all agape-lies.
[00:11:33] Unknown Guest: And they tend to punch each other for 10 years.
[00:11:36] Unknown Guest: And our little corner of the world that is scale ups and startups,
[00:11:39] Jason Calacanis: these are these Snowflakes.
[00:11:40] Jason Calacanis: The one thing I do know is we're just starting to learn
[00:11:45] what we can do with our data with agents.
[00:11:48] Jason Calacanis: We're just starting to learn.
[00:11:49] Jason Calacanis: And even Snowflake is still learning, right?
[00:11:52] Jason Calacanis: It's new to Snowflake.
[00:11:53] Jason Calacanis: I mean, when we had the CEO of Snowflake at Sastra and Ulynn May,
[00:11:57] Jason Calacanis: just starting to talk about how they were going to use agents, right?
[00:12:00] Jason Calacanis: And now, fast forward to today, it's a couple months later.
[00:12:02] Jason Calacanis: All the Vy platform now can directly access Snowflake data.
[00:12:06] Jason Calacanis: Like, literally, we could fire up our cursor-lovable replet
[00:12:10] Jason Calacanis: and just build an app right now while we're here
[00:12:12] Jason Calacanis: and access our Salesforce data.
[00:12:14] Jason Calacanis: What will that mean to access that data?
[00:12:17] Jason Calacanis: What will that mean for how we think about CRM,
[00:12:20] Jason Calacanis: how we think about where we host and how we exit?
[00:12:22] Jason Calacanis: Like, I'm just not smart.
[00:12:24] Jason Calacanis: I've to even predict what that means in a year,
[00:12:25] Jason Calacanis: because that wasn't even possible a couple weeks ago.
[00:12:27] Jason Calacanis: Can you access every bit of data in Snowflake or Databricks
[00:12:31] Jason Calacanis: in a Fortune 500 company?
[00:12:32] Jason Calacanis: I assume the answer is no.
[00:12:33] Jason Calacanis: I assume a lot of that data is low.
[00:12:35] Jason Calacanis: But that is an epic change that I can't even predict
[00:12:39] Jason Calacanis: the scope of the curve next year, right?
[00:12:40] Jason Calacanis: And so what happens, I know we overuse this word,
[00:12:45] Jason Calacanis: it's not authentic, but what happens when I can use
[00:12:47] Jason Calacanis: easy to use agents where I don't need a lot of engineers
[00:12:51] Jason Calacanis: to access all of my data any way I want to build any report,
[00:12:55] Jason Calacanis: any analytics, any workflow from that.
[00:12:57] Jason Calacanis: I think we're 1% on this journey.
[00:13:00] Jason Calacanis: If I'm out, then we'll empower our data with agents
[00:13:03] Jason Calacanis: we were just learning.
[00:13:04] Jason Calacanis: If I were to push you, honestly,
[00:13:07] Harry Stebbings: and ask the question of will we see our CRM's
[00:13:09] Harry Stebbings: your Salesforce is your hub's boss,
[00:13:11] Harry Stebbings: will they become databases which agents sit on top of
[00:13:14] Harry Stebbings: and feed off, or will these platforms move with the
[00:13:17] Harry Stebbings: agentic world, build their own and not become sheer
[00:13:20] Harry Stebbings: databases alone?
[00:13:22] Harry Stebbings: If I push you, one is the likely outcome.
[00:13:26] I think the fact that Mark Benioff has put 2000 people
[00:13:30] Jason Calacanis: on agent force tells you the future right there.
[00:13:33] Jason Calacanis: He's already got 2000 people on it.
[00:13:34] Jason Calacanis: But it tells you his intentions, it doesn't tell you his ability.
[00:13:38] Jason Calacanis: We are still early on enterprises, and I think
[00:13:42] if Salesforce in particular, they've got two years
[00:13:46] Jason Calacanis: to unlock all this capability I think with the rate of change.
[00:13:49] Jason Calacanis: It's just at Mark has to do it as a case here,
[00:13:52] Jason Calacanis: there's not a lot of time at Salesforce.
[00:13:53] Jason Calacanis: Like traditionally, that's like a major release, right?
[00:13:57] Jason Calacanis: Snowflake turned out to have time.
[00:13:59] Jason Calacanis: Like we might have thought Snowflake was struggling
[00:14:01] Jason Calacanis: at the start of the year, right?
[00:14:03] Jason Calacanis: We don't think Snowflake's right.
[00:14:04] Jason Calacanis: So there is more time in the older enterprises,
[00:14:07] Jason Calacanis: and where that breaks for those that have massive amounts
[00:14:14] Jason Calacanis: of data, I am not smart enough to predict.
[00:14:16] Jason Calacanis: I would not bet against anyone that is managing
[00:14:20] Jason Calacanis: a huge amount of structured and unstructured data.
[00:14:24] Jason Calacanis: I wouldn't bet against anyone.
[00:14:25] Jason Calacanis: What will probably happen is if you want to build agents
[00:14:30] Unknown Guest: that are just using your CRM data and your Salesforce shop,
[00:14:34] Unknown Guest: just like a Microsoft was able to bundle Microsoft products,
[00:14:37] Unknown Guest: you'll probably take the agent from Salesforce
[00:14:40] Unknown Guest: and get a combined thing.
[00:14:41] Unknown Guest: But I think, and to Jason's point,
[00:14:43] Unknown Guest: I think enterprise will want to build more powerful agents
[00:14:46] Unknown Guest: were not just drawing the data from one app by Salesforce,
[00:14:51] Unknown Guest: but drawing the data from maybe five or six different sources.
[00:14:54] Unknown Guest: The more likely architecture for that is some version
[00:14:57] Unknown Guest: of stuff at all in Snowflake,
[00:14:59] Unknown Guest: and then run an agent directly against that.
[00:15:02] Unknown Guest: And I think as you were talking Jason earlier
[00:15:04] Unknown Guest: about what you think with Snowflake,
[00:15:05] Unknown Guest: I remember one of the things we did five or six years ago
[00:15:09] Unknown Guest: that was turned out in retrospective,
[00:15:10] Unknown Guest: very smart is just literally up to stuff all the data
[00:15:14] Unknown Guest: in Snowflake across all the systems.
[00:15:16] Unknown Guest: So over time, you have access to that.
[00:15:18] Unknown Guest: So if I'm a large enterprise and I want to use my internal,
[00:15:22] Unknown Guest: let's say I'm a bank,
[00:15:23] Unknown Guest: I want to use my deposit system plus my Salesforce system
[00:15:26] Unknown Guest: plus something else.
[00:15:27] At a certain size, it won't work easily
[00:15:30] in just a Salesforce so you'll want to go
[00:15:32] Unknown Guest: just like every large enterprise
[00:15:33] Unknown Guest: the dawn of time,
[00:15:34] Unknown Guest: some apps you'll want to build yourself.
[00:15:36] Unknown Guest: And if agents becomes strategically important enough
[00:15:39] Unknown Guest: for super big companies,
[00:15:40] Unknown Guest: then they'll show $5 million and a bunch of Snowflake added
[00:15:44] Unknown Guest: and our data breaks and just build it themselves.
[00:15:46] Unknown Guest: So there's no doubt that AG Force
[00:15:49] Unknown Guest: can get a fair slug of the market,
[00:15:51] Unknown Guest: but I'm also sure that at the high end,
[00:15:54] Unknown Guest: there'll be a bunch of wonderfully bespoke projects
[00:15:56] Unknown Guest: that will make systems integrators
[00:15:58] Unknown Guest: read for the next decade.
[00:15:59] Unknown Guest: Everything we're doing right now in AI is very exciting,
[00:16:02] Jason Calacanis: but I've been thinking a lot about how Gainsight's
[00:16:06] Jason Calacanis: been locked at a Salesforce two weeks.
[00:16:08] Jason Calacanis: I've been thinking a lot about how OpenAI
[00:16:10] Jason Calacanis: just kicked Mixpanel this week permanently off OpenAI
[00:16:15] Jason Calacanis: for security breach.
[00:16:17] Jason Calacanis: And I really think that with agents running everywhere
[00:16:21] Jason Calacanis: with our data, the folks that can securely manage those data
[00:16:25] Jason Calacanis: and the folks that have secure agents
[00:16:27] Jason Calacanis: or seemingly secure agents, they may win.
[00:16:31] Jason Calacanis: We're willing to bend some rules in the age of AI.
[00:16:33] Jason Calacanis: We're willing to bend some rules to move quickly.
[00:16:36] Jason Calacanis: I think security is gonna benefit the incumbents.
[00:16:40] Jason Calacanis: I think we're gonna be worried that our agents are depositing
[00:16:42] Jason Calacanis: our data in a hundred different places
[00:16:44] Jason Calacanis: and are gonna be worried and it's crazy.
[00:16:48] Jason Calacanis: I mean, I love Nick and the Gainsight team,
[00:16:51] Jason Calacanis: but essentially their app has been down for two weeks
[00:16:53] Jason Calacanis: with no known resolution time.
[00:16:55] Jason Calacanis: But Salesforce has kicked them off the platform.
[00:16:57] Jason Calacanis: They kicked Drift off five months ago.
[00:16:59] Jason Calacanis: Drift will never come back.
[00:17:00] Jason Calacanis: It is dead.
[00:17:02] Jason Calacanis: It is completely dead.
[00:17:03] Jason Calacanis: And so I think about those
[00:17:05] Jason Calacanis: and I think about where all these agents are taking our data.
[00:17:09] Jason Calacanis: I might want my agents from Salesforce
[00:17:11] Jason Calacanis: and Snowball and Data Bricks.
[00:17:13] Jason Calacanis: And when things change, we get very excited about new vendors,
[00:17:18] Jason Calacanis: because the incumbents can't do it.
[00:17:20] Jason Calacanis: We get very excited.
[00:17:21] Jason Calacanis: And inherently we take a little bit of risk.
[00:17:23] Jason Calacanis: We try and contain that risk in a pilot
[00:17:26] Jason Calacanis: or in a less critical source of data.
[00:17:28] Jason Calacanis: We always try to measure the risk at the beginning.
[00:17:31] Jason Calacanis: But I wonder, this is our sensitive data flowing.
[00:17:34] Jason Calacanis: And it may not matter for your average startup,
[00:17:36] Jason Calacanis: but I generally am worried we're underestimating security
[00:17:40] Jason Calacanis: and data residency in general.
[00:17:41] Jason Calacanis: I just worry.
[00:17:42] Jason Calacanis: And I feel bad, but I just couldn't imagine
[00:17:44] Jason Calacanis: going through this Gainsight.
[00:17:45] Jason Calacanis: Do you think the world is more,
[00:17:47] Unknown Guest: and become is a more unforgiving now?
[00:17:49] Unknown Guest: Because, yeah, over the last 10 or 15 years,
[00:17:52] Unknown Guest: a lot of companies have had beaches.
[00:17:53] Unknown Guest: Do you think this was more serious?
[00:17:55] Unknown Guest: It is more serious.
[00:17:58] Jason Calacanis: They are literally, so drift at the security breach.
[00:18:02] Jason Calacanis: 700 folks data were downloaded.
[00:18:05] Jason Calacanis: And now a pirate group is asking for millions of dollars
[00:18:09] Jason Calacanis: for each instance.
[00:18:10] Jason Calacanis: And then this happens again, right, with Gainsight.
[00:18:13] Jason Calacanis: I can't speak for Salesforce with a team.
[00:18:15] Jason Calacanis: I mean, 45 billion, but I would be more conservative
[00:18:18] Jason Calacanis: with who I let touch my data.
[00:18:20] Jason Calacanis: We could say it's an OAuth issue, whatever.
[00:18:22] Jason Calacanis: But I don't want this ever happening again.
[00:18:24] Jason Calacanis: One time we can blame Drift
[00:18:26] Jason Calacanis: because it got acquired by another P firm
[00:18:28] Jason Calacanis: that got acquired by another P eu firm.
[00:18:30] Jason Calacanis: But two times I might start locking down my platform.
[00:18:34] Jason Calacanis: The third time I might say, I'm just gonna own all the engines.
[00:18:38] Jason Calacanis: I'm done with these risks, right?
[00:18:41] Jason Calacanis: I don't know, but it's getting worse.
[00:18:45] Jason Calacanis: When people want to steal your data and sell,
[00:18:48] Jason Calacanis: and ransom you from million dollars
[00:18:50] Jason Calacanis: across 700 orgs, including Cloudflare.
[00:18:53] Jason Calacanis: And how many start, how big is the SECOPS team
[00:18:56] Jason Calacanis: and most startups you work with?
[00:18:58] 50?
[00:18:59] Oh, thank you very much, 100.
[00:19:01] Jason Calacanis: How big is the latest deal you did?
[00:19:03] Jason Calacanis: How big is the security team?
[00:19:06] Unknown Guest: And the funny thing is Jason,
[00:19:06] Unknown Guest: both the examples you cited are mature, first and second
[00:19:10] Unknown Guest: generation SaaS companies, not brand new AI first companies.
[00:19:15] Unknown Guest: So what you're saying is new companies
[00:19:19] Unknown Guest: might get tagged with the consequence
[00:19:22] Unknown Guest: of a more restrictive security policy,
[00:19:25] Unknown Guest: even though you could argue it was older companies
[00:19:28] Unknown Guest: that I think in both cases were PE managed
[00:19:31] Unknown Guest: that actually caused the problem,
[00:19:32] Unknown Guest: which is life is unfair, but there you go.
[00:19:35] Jason Calacanis: Probably just before we started doing this,
[00:19:36] Jason Calacanis: it kind of felt like the enterprise was gonna win.
[00:19:38] Jason Calacanis: That service now and everybody was gonna win,
[00:19:40] Jason Calacanis: and then it doesn't feel like that at all.
[00:19:43] Then we saw the numbers take off
[00:19:45] Jason Calacanis: and basically very few incumbents
[00:19:47] Jason Calacanis: grew this year materially, right?
[00:19:49] Jason Calacanis: They varied so, but this could be a piece
[00:19:51] Jason Calacanis: of their revenge at the enterprise.
[00:19:53] Jason Calacanis: You cynically suggest thing that large enterprise software
[00:19:57] Unknown Guest: company could say, I'm using security as an excuse
[00:20:00] Unknown Guest: to cut you all off, but lo and behold,
[00:20:02] Unknown Guest: I have my own agent product right here
[00:20:04] Unknown Guest: which you can now safely buy, Mr. Cousler.
[00:20:06] Unknown Guest: I think it's a good excuse.
[00:20:07] Jason Calacanis: I think if you don't want clean,
[00:20:09] Jason Calacanis: sort of bring all your data, right?
[00:20:11] Jason Calacanis: Which, you know, if I'm clean, I get it.
[00:20:13] Jason Calacanis: If I don't want all of it going out of slack
[00:20:15] Jason Calacanis: or whatever, I mean, many incumbents,
[00:20:17] Jason Calacanis: I think it's the best excuse there is,
[00:20:19] Jason Calacanis: because the existential risk is just too much
[00:20:23] Jason Calacanis: to the vendor, it's not worth it.
[00:20:25] Jason Calacanis: I don't know how many board meetings
[00:20:26] Jason Calacanis: you guys have been in where the first half
[00:20:29] Jason Calacanis: of this presentation was how we're gonna get
[00:20:31] Jason Calacanis: be more secure in the age of AI,
[00:20:33] Jason Calacanis: but for me, it's been close to zero.
[00:20:34] Jason Calacanis: So we've been close to zero in the above
[00:20:38] Jason Calacanis: the full part of the conversation.
[00:20:40] So we spoke about data braces growth.
[00:20:43] Harry Stebbings: I do just want to take the flip side of that,
[00:20:45] Harry Stebbings: which is a less positive or optimistic side.
[00:20:48] Harry Stebbings: Pager duty, 2X, a billion valuation at 500 million
[00:20:53] Harry Stebbings: error, 4% growth.
[00:20:55] Harry Stebbings: We just saw Lissie, it's not on the schedule.
[00:20:57] Harry Stebbings: So this is where Rory gets nuts at me,
[00:21:00] Harry Stebbings: because I just add shit without asking him
[00:21:02] Harry Stebbings: and then expect him on a whim to come up with something
[00:21:04] Harry Stebbings: and normally we can edit out pauses,
[00:21:06] Harry Stebbings: but now he's gonna be extra pissed with me.
[00:21:10] Harry Stebbings: Welcome to my life.
[00:21:12] Harry Stebbings: Event bright, they've been acquired for like 500 million.
[00:21:16] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, that's a premium, right?
[00:21:18] Jason Calacanis: Yeah, so that's 1.5 times revenue.
[00:21:20] Jason Calacanis: 1.5 times revenue.
[00:21:22] Jason Calacanis: With a 50% premium.
[00:21:23] Jason Calacanis: With a 50% premium.
[00:21:25] Harry Stebbings: So new news in stay.
[00:21:28] Harry Stebbings: And we can take the page duty,
[00:21:29] Harry Stebbings: because it's so fresh having that event bright news.
[00:21:31] Harry Stebbings: It is hard to bluntly ask for such immediate thoughts.
[00:21:35] Harry Stebbings: But how do we think about this?
[00:21:37] Harry Stebbings: Bloney, very harsh new reality,
[00:21:39] Harry Stebbings: given the lack of growth and the subsequent pricing from it.
[00:21:42] Harry Stebbings: I'll surprise you, Harry, I'll cover both,
[00:21:44] Unknown Guest: despite the complete lack of notice.
[00:21:46] I think there's two separate things,
[00:21:47] Unknown Guest: and one perhaps is a positive, right?
[00:21:49] Unknown Guest: One is kind of a fact about being public.
[00:21:52] Unknown Guest: When you're public and your stock is floating around
[00:21:54] Unknown Guest: nowhere at a low evaluation,
[00:21:56] Unknown Guest: you're just very vulnerable to this.
[00:21:57] Unknown Guest: Someone comes into view,
[00:21:59] Unknown Guest: they are, you know, you're not growing quickly,
[00:22:01] Unknown Guest: they offer you a 50% premium.
[00:22:03] Unknown Guest: And you get called in, but the board gets called in,
[00:22:05] Unknown Guest: the lawyer gives you the speech about for juice three duties.
[00:22:09] Unknown Guest: And if you can come up with a convincing reason
[00:22:11] Unknown Guest: why you can build better value than that premium,
[00:22:13] Unknown Guest: you should, you're very forced to take it.
[00:22:16] Unknown Guest: Not 100%, but it's a tough place to be, right?
[00:22:20] So I can imagine the conversation at Eventbride.
[00:22:24] I can imagine the conversation two weeks ago at Semvush,
[00:22:27] Unknown Guest: and I'm sure a page with duty
[00:22:28] Unknown Guest: are thinking about the same thing, right?
[00:22:30] Unknown Guest: But now there's two things to say though,
[00:22:32] Unknown Guest: at the wider level.
[00:22:33] Unknown Guest: The first is let's start with the positive.
[00:22:35] Unknown Guest: Someone else, very smart money,
[00:22:38] Unknown Guest: thinks these things are worth buying.
[00:22:39] Unknown Guest: And I think they're looking at it and saying,
[00:22:41] Unknown Guest: you, Mr. Seller, haven't created value here,
[00:22:45] Unknown Guest: haven't found growth, and I think we can.
[00:22:48] And if you look at the three companies we're talking about,
[00:22:50] Unknown Guest: because let's lump in Semvush,
[00:22:51] Unknown Guest: because they were acquired two weeks ago by Adobe.
[00:22:54] Unknown Guest: And Jason and I disagreed,
[00:22:55] Unknown Guest: but we definitely felt someone like Adobe
[00:22:58] Unknown Guest: could do something with that asset.
[00:23:00] I'm not sure what the direction of Eventbride could take,
[00:23:04] Unknown Guest: but I think, and you said in your notes,
[00:23:06] Unknown Guest: how a page with duty has an obvious set of next products,
[00:23:10] Unknown Guest: including AI, agentic products,
[00:23:12] Unknown Guest: around downtime resolution,
[00:23:16] Unknown Guest: that feel obvious to me.
[00:23:17] Unknown Guest: And frankly, I wouldn't be surprised
[00:23:19] Unknown Guest: at an aggressive PE firm said, oh my God,
[00:23:22] Unknown Guest: I can buy this thing, I can then buy some small little
[00:23:26] Unknown Guest: hot AI startup, put them together,
[00:23:28] Unknown Guest: and get this thing back to 20% growth,
[00:23:30] Unknown Guest: value the 10 times and look like a hero.
[00:23:33] So the positive would be other people's smart savvy money,
[00:23:37] Unknown Guest: look at these assets and say,
[00:23:39] Unknown Guest: two times revenue is stupidly cheap, I'll have that.
[00:23:41] Unknown Guest: I hope so, I hope there's more deals.
[00:23:43] Jason Calacanis: We see general catalysts and others doing this,
[00:23:45] Jason Calacanis: let's add AI to services businesses,
[00:23:47] Jason Calacanis: we see a lot of talk of this,
[00:23:49] Jason Calacanis: but right now we're not seeing a lot of these mashed together
[00:23:52] Jason Calacanis: legacy company hundreds of millions
[00:23:55] Jason Calacanis: and B2B and hot AI startups
[00:23:56] Jason Calacanis: and magically flipping it into a 20X, 15X AI
[00:23:59] Jason Calacanis: or a company, I'm not saying it's not coming,
[00:24:01] Jason Calacanis: but we haven't seen pageerduty.com
[00:24:05] Jason Calacanis: and pageerduty.ai,
[00:24:06] Jason Calacanis: magically mashed together into a winner yet, have we?
[00:24:09] Jason Calacanis: Knowing happened and you write JSON,
[00:24:11] Unknown Guest: but the funny thing is, I mean,
[00:24:13] Unknown Guest: I like pageerduty, we looked at the deal 10 years ago,
[00:24:16] Unknown Guest: my then new partner wrote a term sheet,
[00:24:18] Unknown Guest: we should have let him pay a little more
[00:24:20] Unknown Guest: because he was right, we love that market.
[00:24:22] Unknown Guest: And I remember the investment memo from 10 years ago
[00:24:25] Unknown Guest: and it said clearly, summary,
[00:24:27] Unknown Guest: this is a great market, it's gonna tap out
[00:24:30] Unknown Guest: and you have to add a whole series of ad on products
[00:24:33] Unknown Guest: around managing the process of downtime
[00:24:36] Unknown Guest: or security breaches,
[00:24:38] Unknown Guest: managing the process of getting something back up
[00:24:40] Unknown Guest: and we didn't have it at the time,
[00:24:41] Unknown Guest: but now obviously adding AI enabled operational resolution,
[00:24:49] Unknown Guest: and the direction was clear and is clear.
[00:24:52] Unknown Guest: So, you write JSON, they haven't done it,
[00:24:55] Unknown Guest: but I think that that's just a disappointing outcome,
[00:24:58] Unknown Guest: let's just say, right?
[00:24:59] Unknown Guest: I think that the direction of travel should have been clear
[00:25:03] Unknown Guest: and if you've kind of been able to add it,
[00:25:05] Unknown Guest: I think we talk a lot about how distribution
[00:25:08] Unknown Guest: is a huge advantage in software.
[00:25:10] Unknown Guest: I mean, literally every ops team on the planet
[00:25:13] Unknown Guest: uses pageerduty and for God's sake,
[00:25:17] Unknown Guest: it's pretty obvious what to add here people, get it done.
[00:25:20] Roy, as your views and Json Tear,
[00:25:23] Harry Stebbings: if your views on market size changes an investor,
[00:25:26] Harry Stebbings: given what you just said,
[00:25:27] Harry Stebbings: every ops team on the planet uses pageerduty
[00:25:30] Harry Stebbings: and it's a billion valuation,
[00:25:33] Harry Stebbings: 10% holding, be 100 million buy.
[00:25:36] It's just a very sobering reality
[00:25:39] Harry Stebbings: because your view on market size changed
[00:25:41] Harry Stebbings: when investing today,
[00:25:43] Harry Stebbings: given where else you can put your money
[00:25:46] Harry Stebbings: and the sizes of those markets
[00:25:48] that we're seeing with your lovable and your replas.
[00:25:50] Harry Stebbings: I see more and more folks who I thought would grow out
[00:25:55] Jason Calacanis: of a small town, not grow out enough.
[00:25:59] Jason Calacanis: When I started as a B2B founder quite a while ago,
[00:26:01] Jason Calacanis: everyone seemed to grow out of small towns for the most part.
[00:26:04] Jason Calacanis: Some better than others,
[00:26:06] Jason Calacanis: but it felt like we had time
[00:26:08] Jason Calacanis: and it felt like you had four or five years
[00:26:11] Jason Calacanis: to figure it out at each stage
[00:26:12] Jason Calacanis: and you could see it coming.
[00:26:16] Jason Calacanis: Now it feels like,
[00:26:18] Jason Calacanis: now that the average public SaaS company
[00:26:20] Jason Calacanis: is growing like 16%,
[00:26:21] Jason Calacanis: it feels like no one figured this out.
[00:26:23] Jason Calacanis: Like we've never grown more slowly, right?
[00:26:25] Jason Calacanis: We literally just in my presentation before,
[00:26:26] Jason Calacanis: we looked at this chart,
[00:26:27] Jason Calacanis: no one's ever grown this slowly.
[00:26:29] Jason Calacanis: So if the public guys can't figure this out,
[00:26:32] Jason Calacanis: I mean, I know the next generation of the kids
[00:26:34] Jason Calacanis: should do better than the adults,
[00:26:36] Jason Calacanis: but I'm worried that the majority of the public SaaS companies
[00:26:40] Jason Calacanis: didn't figure this out.
[00:26:40] Jason Calacanis: The majority of the public SaaS companies
[00:26:42] Jason Calacanis: I think are in a Tam trap, a Tam trap.
[00:26:45] Harry Stebbings: It's a good title for the public.
[00:26:46] Harry Stebbings: The Tam trap, a Tam trap.
[00:26:47] Harry Stebbings: The Tam trap.
[00:26:48] Jason Calacanis: I thought it was a big deal.
[00:26:49] Jason Calacanis: I mean, love.
[00:26:50] Jason Calacanis: How did Aaron Levy's in the Drew House Stins
[00:26:53] Jason Calacanis: and the others not figure out?
[00:26:54] Jason Calacanis: And I love them, right?
[00:26:55] Jason Calacanis: I love him.
[00:26:56] Jason Calacanis: How do we not all figure out the Tam trap?
[00:26:57] Jason Calacanis: What hope is there for the rest of us?
[00:26:59] Jason Calacanis: I can give you a fair answer on that.
[00:27:01] Unknown Guest: First of all, I think it's a great kind of division
[00:27:04] Unknown Guest: of the discussion into the Tam trap for the existing.
[00:27:07] Unknown Guest: And then what does it mean for the new AI companies?
[00:27:09] Unknown Guest: And then maybe third, what does it mean for venture?
[00:27:11] Unknown Guest: But let's start on the first one, the SaaS Tam trap.
[00:27:14] Unknown Guest: You keep saying, Jason, how did they not figure it out?
[00:27:16] Unknown Guest: Let me just offer a different perspective.
[00:27:19] Unknown Guest: Maybe there's no answer.
[00:27:20] Unknown Guest: In other words, there's so many SaaS companies.
[00:27:22] Unknown Guest: It's not that everyone was idiots
[00:27:24] Unknown Guest: and couldn't find the market.
[00:27:25] Unknown Guest: I don't believe that at all.
[00:27:26] Unknown Guest: I believe that we made so many companies
[00:27:29] Unknown Guest: that we saturated the markets.
[00:27:30] Unknown Guest: And by the time you got to the point
[00:27:32] Unknown Guest: where you needed to expand beyond your market,
[00:27:34] Unknown Guest: in many cases, there were other venture back SaaS companies
[00:27:37] Unknown Guest: into the adjacent market.
[00:27:38] Unknown Guest: So you just kind of ran out of room, right?
[00:27:40] Unknown Guest: And in fact, I did a blog post of this in 2019
[00:27:43] Unknown Guest: called Hunger Games in SaaS.
[00:27:45] Unknown Guest: And so that's my opinion on that.
[00:27:47] Unknown Guest: So like many of these markets,
[00:27:50] Unknown Guest: it's not that some of the CEOs you cited it is,
[00:27:52] Unknown Guest: it's that you have high penetration of the markets.
[00:27:55] Unknown Guest: There's not a whole, I mean, you know,
[00:27:57] Unknown Guest: take the quintessential one you and I talk about all the time.
[00:27:59] Unknown Guest: You know, the whole thing is that you just zoom.
[00:28:00] Everyone who needed a zoom account has one.
[00:28:02] Unknown Guest: And everyone who has an zoom account has a team account,
[00:28:04] Unknown Guest: the poor bastards.
[00:28:05] Unknown Guest: And they're done.
[00:28:07] Unknown Guest: But there's nothing more to say.
[00:28:08] Unknown Guest: You gotta build a new thing.
[00:28:09] Unknown Guest: So it, and the initial quarter court
[00:28:13] Unknown Guest: obviously it's new thing for zoom pre-AI
[00:28:15] Unknown Guest: was that whole contact center business.
[00:28:18] Unknown Guest: And they couldn't get that acquisition done
[00:28:20] Unknown Guest: and there was already incumbents in the space.
[00:28:22] Unknown Guest: So I think pre-AI you ran out of time, right?
[00:28:25] Unknown Guest: So Harry, to your question, as we've said many times,
[00:28:28] Unknown Guest: overpayment only works when the time is huge.
[00:28:31] Unknown Guest: In finite times, you got a bit more tightly, right?
[00:28:35] And I think it's so funny, I'm gonna anecdot
[00:28:37] Unknown Guest: about page of duty.
[00:28:38] Unknown Guest: When they went public and we did our internal autopsy
[00:28:41] Unknown Guest: because you do, right?
[00:28:43] Unknown Guest: I looked at the model we'd owned over it
[00:28:44] Unknown Guest: five, six years ago and we were accurate
[00:28:46] Unknown Guest: within 3% on the model prediction of revenues.
[00:28:51] Unknown Guest: And all that happened was the market was just willing
[00:28:53] Unknown Guest: to pay more for the asset and now it's not, right?
[00:28:56] Unknown Guest: So I think on the existing space,
[00:28:58] Unknown Guest: it's the time constraint.
[00:29:00] Unknown Guest: And I think you just have to be careful and pride.
[00:29:01] Unknown Guest: Now, the question on the new market,
[00:29:04] Unknown Guest: which I think is believable and credible is,
[00:29:07] is there AI, we've discussed it a million times.
[00:29:10] Unknown Guest: Does the AI labor expansion save us all
[00:29:13] Unknown Guest: and allow us to reach higher on price
[00:29:16] Unknown Guest: and still get these huge towns?
[00:29:17] Unknown Guest: Are we gonna be in the same place eight years from now?
[00:29:20] That's the actually monthly trillion dollar question
[00:29:23] Unknown Guest: as a term.
[00:29:24] Jason Calacanis: Two, one is, can AI allow us to tap more into labor budget, right?
[00:29:28] Jason Calacanis: I think the second one, and I was trying
[00:29:30] Jason Calacanis: to summarize this earlier today, is can AI provide
[00:29:34] Jason Calacanis: so much value that you can charge an order of magnitude
[00:29:37] Jason Calacanis: more than you could charge before?
[00:29:39] Jason Calacanis: Gamma charging $100 a month instead of,
[00:29:42] Jason Calacanis: you know, I only pay eight bucks for Canva, right?
[00:29:45] Jason Calacanis: Or cursor charging $500 a month when I pay $3 for Gira.
[00:29:51] Jason Calacanis: And so you wonder, can we do that?
[00:29:54] Jason Calacanis: We don't talk about Zoom, I try to think about Zoom.
[00:29:56] Jason Calacanis: I can't think of like a better technical founder
[00:30:00] Jason Calacanis: running a leader than Zoom.
[00:30:01] Jason Calacanis: I can't figure out some of my respect more
[00:30:04] Jason Calacanis: on every level as a human, as an engineer,
[00:30:06] Jason Calacanis: as a leader than Eric.
[00:30:09] Jason Calacanis: Why in four years, there's a mean question
[00:30:11] Jason Calacanis: and I don't deserve to even ask it
[00:30:13] Jason Calacanis: because you said, why didn't they capture more tam?
[00:30:16] Jason Calacanis: Why didn't they find a way to add four billion of notetakers
[00:30:20] Jason Calacanis: when there's the trillion notetakers?
[00:30:21] Jason Calacanis: Why didn't they, and I don't know the answer?
[00:30:24] Jason Calacanis: It's not because you're not one of the smartest people
[00:30:26] Jason Calacanis: in the industry thinking about this for a decade,
[00:30:29] Jason Calacanis: but there was no great second act yet.
[00:30:31] Jason Calacanis: There's no great second act.
[00:30:33] Jason Calacanis: And I do work back there, I worry.
[00:30:37] Jason Calacanis: I worry, and this is why I tell founders
[00:30:40] Jason Calacanis: to take their exits and then say no,
[00:30:42] Jason Calacanis: because they can go bigger, but by default take it.
[00:30:46] So many things of that to unpack.
[00:30:48] Unknown Guest: I mean, one is the multi product thing.
[00:30:50] Unknown Guest: I think one of the big takeaways we've had
[00:30:55] is the need to be thinking about that second product
[00:30:58] Unknown Guest: much earlier than you would have thought.
[00:31:00] Unknown Guest: You don't want to wait till you hit.
[00:31:01] Unknown Guest: And what's the term, what was word expression, Jason?
[00:31:04] Unknown Guest: I love that.
[00:31:06] It was good, but I'm just getting what do we call it?
[00:31:07] Unknown Guest: What's a time trap?
[00:31:08] Unknown Guest: The time trap.
[00:31:09] Unknown Guest: Time trap, yeah.
[00:31:10] Unknown Guest: No way to be hit the time trap.
[00:31:11] Unknown Guest: I mean, we were thinking, actually,
[00:31:12] Unknown Guest: we were comparing two of our portfolio come up.
[00:31:14] Unknown Guest: The bus and its inventors to name them.
[00:31:16] Unknown Guest: But we would say one of them has compounded really well
[00:31:20] Unknown Guest: because it's continually added a new product.
[00:31:22] Unknown Guest: That for the first year or two is a couple of million dollars,
[00:31:25] Unknown Guest: but layered it in and now many hundreds of millions.
[00:31:27] Unknown Guest: So I think watching that time trap is key.
[00:31:29] Unknown Guest: But the other thing you said, and it was in the speaker notes,
[00:31:32] Unknown Guest: two is on the AI pricing, if you're pricing
[00:31:36] Unknown Guest: versus labor of value created,
[00:31:38] Unknown Guest: you're getting enormously great prices
[00:31:40] Unknown Guest: because you're saving a lot of labor.
[00:31:42] Unknown Guest: And I think you said in the speaker notes,
[00:31:43] Unknown Guest: what happens when there's two or three of these companies
[00:31:46] Unknown Guest: and the competition goes from, hey, I'm saving you
[00:31:50] Unknown Guest: a thousand dollars of labor a month to, yeah,
[00:31:52] Unknown Guest: I'm saving a thousand dollars of labor,
[00:31:54] Unknown Guest: but there's three providers of the same software, AI software,
[00:31:57] Unknown Guest: and they're all willing to do it for a hundred bucks.
[00:31:59] Unknown Guest: So you're ability to get 500 gets eroded.
[00:32:01] Unknown Guest: And do you start seeing that happen in AI very quickly?
[00:32:07] Unknown Guest: Is it super clever?
[00:32:08] Unknown Guest: I mean, it hasn't yet, I think.
[00:32:09] Unknown Guest: And speaking of the pricing challenges that we have here,
[00:32:11] Harry Stebbings: we have workday coming out saying, seat reductions
[00:32:15] Harry Stebbings: on existential threat.
[00:32:18] Harry Stebbings: We had Jeff Lawson from Twilly on the show,
[00:32:21] Harry Stebbings: with the three of us.
[00:32:22] Harry Stebbings: And he said that we are unwavering
[00:32:24] Harry Stebbings: and you're gonna see the movement away from seats.
[00:32:26] Harry Stebbings: And that is going to happen.
[00:32:28] Harry Stebbings: Can companies still price by seat in the age of AI
[00:32:31] Harry Stebbings: all work day inherently is threatened
[00:32:34] Harry Stebbings: and right to be concerned by this existential threat?
[00:32:38] Harry Stebbings: You know, when Jeff, if folks haven't watched
[00:32:40] Jason Calacanis: it's worth rewatching, he was so good, right?
[00:32:43] Jason Calacanis: And he made that comment that Twilly,
[00:32:46] Jason Calacanis: especially if you were still CEO,
[00:32:48] Jason Calacanis: would have, we be insulated to that
[00:32:50] Jason Calacanis: because it's based on usage, right?
[00:32:52] Jason Calacanis: And in fact, Twilly, I was seeing a little bit of a resurgence.
[00:32:54] Jason Calacanis: Like it has seen some reacceleration.
[00:32:56] Jason Calacanis: And he said he was very worried about seats.
[00:32:58] Jason Calacanis: But he said, I hadn't been in the game in a little while
[00:33:00] Jason Calacanis: and I've been doing AI and working in my shop.
[00:33:02] Jason Calacanis: So I didn't fully, but it has resonated in my mind since,
[00:33:06] Jason Calacanis: which is he is right.
[00:33:08] Jason Calacanis: And everyone is shrinking headcount in tech,
[00:33:12] Jason Calacanis: at least even if they're not shrinking headcount,
[00:33:14] Jason Calacanis: ARR per employee is gonna keep going up.
[00:33:16] Jason Calacanis: I crunched all the data before this morning.
[00:33:18] Jason Calacanis: Everyone is going up, HubSpot 2.8 times more efficient
[00:33:22] Jason Calacanis: than 2021, Salesforce two times.
[00:33:24] Jason Calacanis: Microsoft has said they're already past peak employee,
[00:33:27] Jason Calacanis: permanently past pre-employee.
[00:33:28] Jason Calacanis: We're all gonna figure out how to get more AIR per employee.
[00:33:33] Jason Calacanis: And if you're a leader, you're just gonna run out of seats,
[00:33:35] Jason Calacanis: right?
[00:33:36] Jason Calacanis: Mark was kind of aware of this when he did the pod too.
[00:33:37] Jason Calacanis: So I don't have the answers.
[00:33:40] Jason Calacanis: I mean, in the early days, it probably doesn't matter, right?
[00:33:42] Jason Calacanis: I mean, your model is your model and seats work well
[00:33:45] Jason Calacanis: in some places, but it is existential.
[00:33:47] Jason Calacanis: We are just gonna get more and more efficient.
[00:33:51] Jason Calacanis: One of my biggest worries for investments
[00:33:53] Jason Calacanis: is when startups aren't getting more efficient.
[00:33:54] Jason Calacanis: I'm not talking about profitability, that's an investment.
[00:33:57] Jason Calacanis: I'm talking about where their teams get more bloated
[00:34:00] Jason Calacanis: as they scale.
[00:34:01] Jason Calacanis: I kind of am out.
[00:34:04] When I go to a board meeting and a CMO says,
[00:34:07] Jason Calacanis: well, I couldn't do that, but I need 50 people.
[00:34:10] Jason Calacanis: Or a product guy says, the reason we're late
[00:34:13] Jason Calacanis: is I need another 80 people on the product and engineering team.
[00:34:18] Jason Calacanis: I think it's time to part ways.
[00:34:20] Jason Calacanis: Give them a nice package and a good recommendation.
[00:34:23] Jason Calacanis: And I'm not saying, can we get AIR replace you?
[00:34:26] Jason Calacanis: I want to see you grow 100% next year
[00:34:28] Jason Calacanis: with 50% head count growth.
[00:34:30] Jason Calacanis: Yeah.
[00:34:31] Jason Calacanis: I think that's healthy today.
[00:34:32] Jason Calacanis: The way through early 2023 is I need 200% head count
[00:34:37] Jason Calacanis: to grow 100% and there's still a lot of that DNA
[00:34:39] Jason Calacanis: in the ecosystem.
[00:34:41] Jason Calacanis: It's still ricocheting around.
[00:34:43] Jason Calacanis: Probably in the majority of executives people will talk to.
[00:34:45] Jason Calacanis: It's still ricocheting around.
[00:34:46] Jason Calacanis: So I think all these things just, I don't think the seed is dead,
[00:34:50] Jason Calacanis: but as time goes by, I get more and more worried.
[00:34:53] Jason Calacanis: It feels like Japan.
[00:34:57] Like our population is organically shrinking.
[00:35:00] Jason Calacanis: To just asses become like Japan.
[00:35:03] Jason Calacanis: That's another thing.
[00:35:04] Jason Calacanis: It's a great economy, but if everyone only has point nine kids,
[00:35:08] Jason Calacanis: I mean, there's only only so many seeds to go around.
[00:35:12] Unknown Guest: I want to come back to the last comment first, Alma.
[00:35:14] Unknown Guest: You're coming on two to one.
[00:35:15] Unknown Guest: And you're exactly right.
[00:35:16] Unknown Guest: As I think about it, I hadn't thought it until you said it,
[00:35:18] Unknown Guest: but in 2021, every discussion was some version of look.
[00:35:23] Unknown Guest: To get that extra 10 points of growth,
[00:35:25] Unknown Guest: we're going to be twice as inefficient at the margin
[00:35:28] Unknown Guest: as we were overall.
[00:35:30] Unknown Guest: And the result of that is overall efficiency is deteriorated.
[00:35:33] Unknown Guest: What you're saying now is at the margin,
[00:35:35] Unknown Guest: we're trying to be twice as efficient,
[00:35:37] Unknown Guest: not inefficient at the margin.
[00:35:39] Unknown Guest: So you're exactly right.
[00:35:40] Unknown Guest: Everyone's efficiency is creeping up.
[00:35:42] Unknown Guest: And I think that's obviously independently.
[00:35:44] Unknown Guest: That's totally correct.
[00:35:45] Unknown Guest: And super insightful when you said it.
[00:35:47] Unknown Guest: It's why, and by the way, it might explain why,
[00:35:50] Unknown Guest: even though the growth rates of the public companies
[00:35:52] Unknown Guest: have gone down significantly,
[00:35:55] the valuations on the revenue multiple
[00:35:57] Unknown Guest: have not gone down as much.
[00:35:58] Unknown Guest: And I think it's because in return for slower growth
[00:36:01] Unknown Guest: fast companies, they are at least getting
[00:36:03] Unknown Guest: wildly more efficient fast companies.
[00:36:05] Unknown Guest: And it's not one for one as we've discussed,
[00:36:07] Unknown Guest: but at least it's better than nothing.
[00:36:09] Unknown Guest: But then going back to the existential threat from work day,
[00:36:14] Unknown Guest: I think software prices on value delivered.
[00:36:17] Unknown Guest: And when you couldn't measure value,
[00:36:20] Unknown Guest: all you had was perceived pricing.
[00:36:23] Unknown Guest: And therefore, that's what people went with.
[00:36:24] Unknown Guest: Everyone has to access the software,
[00:36:26] Unknown Guest: everyone pays so much.
[00:36:28] Unknown Guest: Then you had usage pricing starting with AWS,
[00:36:31] Unknown Guest: which was inherently a more rational for buyer
[00:36:36] Unknown Guest: and sell-away to allocate value,
[00:36:38] Unknown Guest: attract value more closely.
[00:36:39] Unknown Guest: And I think the trend in everything
[00:36:40] Unknown Guest: is just to get more efficient.
[00:36:41] Unknown Guest: I think that's how capitalism works.
[00:36:43] Unknown Guest: So to the point, if you're using AI to deliver value,
[00:36:48] Unknown Guest: it's going to be, and if the AI is doing the work,
[00:36:50] Unknown Guest: it's going to be super hard to have a perceived model
[00:36:53] Unknown Guest: because it's irrelevant.
[00:36:54] Unknown Guest: Now, I don't think for a lot of work,
[00:36:56] Unknown Guest: they will be as irrelevant to some.
[00:37:00] Unknown Guest: There are other areas, like, for example,
[00:37:02] Unknown Guest: some areas of Salesforce, you can imagine
[00:37:03] Unknown Guest: to the extent you entirely automate an SDR team,
[00:37:07] it's going to be hard to have a perceived SDR model.
[00:37:09] Unknown Guest: My guess is work, they will still be able to have
[00:37:11] Unknown Guest: some kind of X dollars per month for end employees served,
[00:37:16] Unknown Guest: and then Y dollars per month for HR staff
[00:37:21] Unknown Guest: actually using the software.
[00:37:23] Unknown Guest: But there probably will be less HR staff using the software
[00:37:25] Unknown Guest: to your point Jason, because if have to make work
[00:37:29] Unknown Guest: that HR was doing is now done by AI,
[00:37:33] Unknown Guest: you're not going to get the same price.
[00:37:35] Unknown Guest: Now, maybe you have to, so therefore,
[00:37:36] Unknown Guest: maybe you have to charge on the value delivered
[00:37:40] Unknown Guest: versus simply the seats, and that's a more complex calculation.
[00:37:43] Unknown Guest: And I think that is true.
[00:37:44] Unknown Guest: It's that all our companies are wrestling with this.
[00:37:47] Unknown Guest: You deliver a ton of value in AI,
[00:37:49] Unknown Guest: and maybe now you get the innovation budget, no one cares.
[00:37:52] Unknown Guest: But a year, two years from now,
[00:37:54] Unknown Guest: you're going to have to link as a startup.
[00:37:57] You're pricing to the value delivered,
[00:37:59] Unknown Guest: and you're going to have to measure.
[00:38:01] And it's a lot harder to measure value than seats.
[00:38:03] Unknown Guest: You can count butts and seats pretty easily.
[00:38:05] Unknown Guest: Every login is a butt.
[00:38:08] When you're trying to measure value delivered, that's pretty.
[00:38:10] Unknown Guest: Can we just go back to the gross and efficiency element?
[00:38:13] Harry Stebbings: I always think when you're creating content,
[00:38:15] Harry Stebbings: you have to think of your customer.
[00:38:16] Harry Stebbings: And the customer that I always have in my head
[00:38:18] Harry Stebbings: is the founder on their way to work,
[00:38:20] Harry Stebbings: or the operator on their way to work,
[00:38:22] Harry Stebbings: listening to our podcast or watching it.
[00:38:26] Harry Stebbings: And they're hearing, I want gross, gross, gross.
[00:38:29] Harry Stebbings: And now they're hearing, I also want efficiency efficiency.
[00:38:32] Harry Stebbings: And two million per employee for Gamma
[00:38:35] Harry Stebbings: and lovable at whatever it is.
[00:38:37] Harry Stebbings: Do we just need both now?
[00:38:39] Harry Stebbings: And it is a higher expectation to meet the bar for VCs.
[00:38:43] Harry Stebbings: Or when you are looking at those two,
[00:38:45] Harry Stebbings: I want growth above everything
[00:38:47] Harry Stebbings: and I'm fine to see less efficiency in the early days.
[00:38:50] Harry Stebbings: I think in the fastest growing companies that I have invested in,
[00:38:53] Jason Calacanis: no one gives a rat's ass about the bottom line.
[00:38:56] Jason Calacanis: That's a different metric than how you scale today.
[00:39:00] Jason Calacanis: And then Rory made this point,
[00:39:01] Jason Calacanis: we all made this point before,
[00:39:02] Jason Calacanis: and I admit there's actually fewer and fewer companies
[00:39:06] Jason Calacanis: are true out performers.
[00:39:07] Jason Calacanis: So as soon as your top portfolio coming out performs,
[00:39:10] Jason Calacanis: everyone wants to give it $100 million today
[00:39:12] Jason Calacanis: at every board meeting.
[00:39:13] Jason Calacanis: And no one really cares about efficiency per se
[00:39:16] Jason Calacanis: as long as they can get their money into the deal.
[00:39:18] Jason Calacanis: So I don't think that's the issue.
[00:39:21] Jason Calacanis: I think we're confusing the fact that everybody
[00:39:24] Jason Calacanis: is just generating more revenue per employee.
[00:39:27] Jason Calacanis: But we've talked about before going to like this,
[00:39:30] Jason Calacanis: the iconic data early in the year,
[00:39:31] Jason Calacanis: the fastest growing AI companies,
[00:39:33] Jason Calacanis: even with high inference costs,
[00:39:35] Jason Calacanis: even with AI costs, have the lowest burden multiples
[00:39:37] Jason Calacanis: because their revenue is growing so much faster
[00:39:40] Jason Calacanis: than the inference costs.
[00:39:41] Jason Calacanis: I think that's what we're hoping for is that,
[00:39:43] Jason Calacanis: you know, companies have never gotten
[00:39:44] Jason Calacanis: a hundred million error more quickly.
[00:39:47] Jason Calacanis: If you do, I don't think we care how you get there anymore.
[00:39:49] Jason Calacanis: I don't think we care.
[00:39:52] Jason Calacanis: But we're, but we know deep down that hiring a thousand people
[00:39:55] Jason Calacanis: isn't the way to get to a hundred million in a year.
[00:39:57] Jason Calacanis: You can't hire them that quickly.
[00:39:59] Jason Calacanis: As Maggie said, they're not all gonna be great, right?
[00:40:02] Jason Calacanis: So you literally can't brute force a hundred million
[00:40:05] Jason Calacanis: in 10 months with humans.
[00:40:06] Jason Calacanis: You just, maybe Larry Ellison or Mark Banyoff could,
[00:40:10] Jason Calacanis: but I don't think anyone else,
[00:40:11] Jason Calacanis: there's just not enough calls and I,
[00:40:13] Jason Calacanis: like you can't go from one to a hundred in 10 months
[00:40:15] Jason Calacanis: without massive and bound demand in a lot of AI.
[00:40:18] Jason Calacanis: I think you should break it up in a couple of areas
[00:40:20] Unknown Guest: and then factor as we think about it, Jason,
[00:40:22] Unknown Guest: it's giving me an insight on your eternal question
[00:40:24] Unknown Guest: on employment because big picture divided up into AI startups
[00:40:27] Unknown Guest: and mature companies.
[00:40:29] I think the comment on AOR, efficiency per AI
[00:40:32] Unknown Guest: is very much a mature company comment.
[00:40:34] Unknown Guest: If you're a public company and you wanna grow in 10 or 15%,
[00:40:39] Unknown Guest: you better be kicking off cash
[00:40:40] Unknown Guest: or you'll be in trouble real quickly.
[00:40:42] Unknown Guest: Even if you are kicking off cash, you'll still get Greek.
[00:40:45] Unknown Guest: But those are the companies that are optimizing,
[00:40:48] Unknown Guest: like their AOR per employee
[00:40:50] Unknown Guest: and are just focused on FCS, we can't throw, right?
[00:40:53] Unknown Guest: And that's a very different set of people
[00:40:56] Unknown Guest: with a very sixth set of dynamics than the AI startup.
[00:40:59] Unknown Guest: So we'll come to them in a second.
[00:41:00] Unknown Guest: The public company's grinding on efficiency,
[00:41:03] Unknown Guest: which means, as you say, lower employment and all that stuff.
[00:41:07] Now come to the private AI companies.
[00:41:08] Unknown Guest: I think there's two categories.
[00:41:10] Unknown Guest: There's a small number of companies
[00:41:11] Unknown Guest: which are taking huge amounts of capital
[00:41:13] Unknown Guest: because they need it for model development.
[00:41:16] Unknown Guest: And primarily it's not humans,
[00:41:17] Unknown Guest: it's they got a spend it within video.
[00:41:20] Unknown Guest: So look, no one's telling open AI, the efficient
[00:41:22] Unknown Guest: or if they are, he's clearly not living, right?
[00:41:25] Unknown Guest: Yeah, to a rounding error, those companies,
[00:41:27] Unknown Guest: I would track, as Jason said,
[00:41:29] Unknown Guest: able to get all the money they want,
[00:41:30] Unknown Guest: they're not compute, have relatively small head count,
[00:41:33] Unknown Guest: relatively to their size,
[00:41:34] Unknown Guest: and no one's saying be efficient,
[00:41:36] Unknown Guest: they're just saying grow quickly.
[00:41:37] Unknown Guest: Then separately, at the ads layer,
[00:41:39] Unknown Guest: you think something's quite different
[00:41:40] Unknown Guest: and Gamma's a good example of that.
[00:41:42] Unknown Guest: The interesting thing is,
[00:41:43] Unknown Guest: because of this amazing new capability,
[00:41:47] Unknown Guest: for lack of a better word,
[00:41:48] Unknown Guest: the foundation models,
[00:41:50] Unknown Guest: there are people in apps land,
[00:41:52] Unknown Guest: building a product, shipping it,
[00:41:54] and they're getting such traction
[00:41:56] Unknown Guest: that the traction is ahead of their ability to hire.
[00:41:58] Unknown Guest: I mean, they're lily, there's no way to spend the money, right?
[00:42:00] Unknown Guest: So we're seeing some of these apps companies
[00:42:02] Unknown Guest: be astonishingly capital efficient,
[00:42:06] Unknown Guest: especially at the early stages.
[00:42:07] Unknown Guest: I mean, Gamma's a great example of that.
[00:42:09] Unknown Guest: It's like you ship the product,
[00:42:10] Unknown Guest: it's freaking amazing,
[00:42:11] Unknown Guest: people buy it, they give you credit cards,
[00:42:13] Unknown Guest: but the time you get around to hiring a stale force,
[00:42:15] Unknown Guest: you're doing so much money already
[00:42:16] Unknown Guest: that you're kicking up cash.
[00:42:17] Unknown Guest: So at the apps level, not all the time,
[00:42:20] Unknown Guest: I think some companies are scared of spending,
[00:42:22] Unknown Guest: but we're seeing the combination of hyper growth,
[00:42:25] Unknown Guest: even with the margins,
[00:42:27] Unknown Guest: not as good as fast land, but still 60%.
[00:42:29] Unknown Guest: If you have that,
[00:42:31] then you have quite a tract of profile, right?
[00:42:33] Unknown Guest: Not all of them are that case,
[00:42:34] Unknown Guest: obviously the coding companies have margin issues,
[00:42:37] Unknown Guest: but a lot of the companies are getting a long way,
[00:42:38] Unknown Guest: not a lot of capital and definitely not a lot of employees.
[00:42:43] Unknown Guest: So I think those are the three categories.
[00:42:45] Unknown Guest: And the interesting thing, Jason,
[00:42:46] Unknown Guest: this goes back to something you've been talking about,
[00:42:48] Unknown Guest: and I've been trying to figure out the answer to
[00:42:49] Unknown Guest: what's going on on employment, right?
[00:42:51] Unknown Guest: Or what's the consequence?
[00:42:53] And I've been more at law be fine in the end,
[00:42:55] Unknown Guest: and I still stand by that,
[00:42:56] Unknown Guest: but the interesting thing when I lift
[00:42:58] Unknown Guest: are those three categories,
[00:42:59] Unknown Guest: the one thing they all have in common is,
[00:43:02] Unknown Guest: they all don't need people.
[00:43:03] The big companies can have people
[00:43:05] Unknown Guest: because they gotta be efficient.
[00:43:06] Unknown Guest: The model companies don't need people
[00:43:07] Unknown Guest: because they just need geniuses and GPU,
[00:43:10] Unknown Guest: and the small AI app startups are growing
[00:43:12] Unknown Guest: and they sit down quickly that can hire people.
[00:43:14] Unknown Guest: Hmm, that's not great if you're people.
[00:43:18] It's not.
[00:43:20] Unknown Guest: It's not.
[00:43:21] Unknown Guest: And all of them are AI optimists.
[00:43:23] Unknown Guest: I think all this unemployment thing is bullshit,
[00:43:25] Unknown Guest: but in the near end, what you recognize,
[00:43:27] Unknown Guest: it's why it's a toughish market for tech startups,
[00:43:30] Unknown Guest: for employees in the tech marketplace,
[00:43:32] Unknown Guest: because labor versus capital discussion
[00:43:35] Unknown Guest: is you need more capital relative to labor at the moment.
[00:43:38] Unknown Guest: The topic we have to discuss,
[00:43:40] Harry Stebbings: we talk about rapid the whole time.
[00:43:41] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, I love that.
[00:43:42] Harry Stebbings: Yeah.
[00:43:43] Harry Stebbings: But then Google have come out.
[00:43:45] Harry Stebbings: Yeah.
[00:43:46] Harry Stebbings: With a competitor.
[00:43:48] Harry Stebbings: And I think we've always been waiting for Google
[00:43:50] Harry Stebbings: and chat GPT to come out with one.
[00:43:53] Harry Stebbings: And it's been very good.
[00:43:54] Harry Stebbings: It's tied to Gemini,
[00:43:55] Harry Stebbings: which is obviously blown past a lot of people's expectations.
[00:43:59] Harry Stebbings: When we look at this, how did we analyze this?
[00:44:02] Harry Stebbings: And is this the case of incumbent waiting
[00:44:04] Harry Stebbings: for enough traction in a market
[00:44:05] Harry Stebbings: and then going, thank you very much, Mr. Startup.
[00:44:07] Harry Stebbings: I'm gonna come in now with great models and distribution
[00:44:10] Harry Stebbings: and it's game over.
[00:44:12] Harry Stebbings: Or actually, have they left it too late?
[00:44:14] Harry Stebbings: And lovable, replet,
[00:44:16] Harry Stebbings: have built enough user base,
[00:44:18] Harry Stebbings: enough brand, enough brand trust
[00:44:21] Harry Stebbings: that actually there is still a real dominant threat
[00:44:25] Harry Stebbings: then to Google's new product with it.
[00:44:26] Harry Stebbings: Well, look, for what it's worth,
[00:44:27] Jason Calacanis: I didn't try it, they launched this week.
[00:44:32] Jason Calacanis: They launched a replet lovable clone
[00:44:34] Jason Calacanis: with no database, no OAuth.
[00:44:36] Jason Calacanis: And so it's really,
[00:44:39] Jason Calacanis: they said it's coming soon.
[00:44:42] Jason Calacanis: And sometimes that's okay for big companies.
[00:44:44] Jason Calacanis: So we'll see, we'll see if,
[00:44:45] Jason Calacanis: one thing that hasn't changed is in the age of AI,
[00:44:48] Jason Calacanis: big companies only have so many priorities,
[00:44:50] Jason Calacanis: they can introduce a lot of little tests.
[00:44:53] Jason Calacanis: But at the end of the day,
[00:44:54] Jason Calacanis: it takes a lot of energy and a big company
[00:44:55] Jason Calacanis: to keep a big initiative going
[00:44:57] Jason Calacanis: because there's so much else to support.
[00:44:58] Jason Calacanis: So we'll see, it wasn't impressive on itself,
[00:45:02] Jason Calacanis: but on the other hand,
[00:45:04] Jason Calacanis: it only took Google launch their competitor
[00:45:07] Jason Calacanis: in less than 10 months.
[00:45:09] Jason Calacanis: So you don't get five years anymore.
[00:45:11] Jason Calacanis: I mean, DataDoc just launched their PagerDuty
[00:45:13] Jason Calacanis: competitor like in the last 24 months.
[00:45:15] Jason Calacanis: When does PagerD Founded 2008,
[00:45:18] Jason Calacanis: you don't get that much now,
[00:45:19] Jason Calacanis: you don't even get a year.
[00:45:22] So that, the incisive pace of cloning and competition
[00:45:28] Jason Calacanis: does worry me.
[00:45:29] Jason Calacanis: Man, if you only get months before the big guys
[00:45:32] Jason Calacanis: come into your space if you blow up,
[00:45:34] Jason Calacanis: I mean, it should make sense, right?
[00:45:36] Jason Calacanis: If you go from zero to 200 million in a year,
[00:45:38] Jason Calacanis: you should attract some competition.
[00:45:40] Jason Calacanis: Not only.
[00:45:41] Jason Calacanis: But it's not a free lunch, right?
[00:45:44] Harry Stebbings: But is there something that we take from this?
[00:45:45] Harry Stebbings: Like, Rourgist, you do a GC AI, I think it is.
[00:45:48] Harry Stebbings: Like, we're like, okay,
[00:45:50] Harry Stebbings: they're not gonna go into GC AI,
[00:45:52] Harry Stebbings: but they are gonna go into lovable.
[00:45:54] Harry Stebbings: They are gonna go into Dachagon.
[00:45:56] Harry Stebbings: They are gonna go here.
[00:45:57] Harry Stebbings: Yeah.
[00:45:58] There's themes where they're like,
[00:45:59] Harry Stebbings: they are gonna go and there's themes where we're like,
[00:46:01] Harry Stebbings: hey, model providers,
[00:46:04] Harry Stebbings: the cool question being, hey,
[00:46:06] Harry Stebbings: where will model providers go in the application layer
[00:46:09] Harry Stebbings: and threaten all businesses?
[00:46:11] Harry Stebbings: This is, I mean, competing with coding tools
[00:46:13] Jason Calacanis: is not that big of a jump, right?
[00:46:15] Jason Calacanis: What if whatever happens?
[00:46:16] Jason Calacanis: I like, worried it a deal.
[00:46:18] Jason Calacanis: I think in the last week or scaled it,
[00:46:20] Jason Calacanis: I really liked personally, even though I didn't examine it.
[00:46:22] Jason Calacanis: You did sort of an AI for like,
[00:46:24] Jason Calacanis: wealth management or asset management, right?
[00:46:26] Jason Calacanis: I love this for a lot of reasons.
[00:46:28] Jason Calacanis: I have some questions,
[00:46:30] Jason Calacanis: but Google isn't gonna copy that.
[00:46:31] Jason Calacanis: They're not gonna copy,
[00:46:32] Jason Calacanis: automating trust, estate planning, investment advice,
[00:46:36] Jason Calacanis: tax efficiency here, your investment, legacy planning
[00:46:39] Jason Calacanis: or maybe it doesn't do all of that, the investment.
[00:46:42] Jason Calacanis: Those are spaces where you have incumbents,
[00:46:45] Jason Calacanis: but maybe have some space to run, right?
[00:46:47] Jason Calacanis: Agreed.
[00:46:48] Unknown Guest: The model provider is not the constraint there.
[00:46:49] Unknown Guest: And I, for the record, would say,
[00:46:51] Unknown Guest: I don't think the model provider
[00:46:52] Unknown Guest: will be the competition in many apps.
[00:46:54] Unknown Guest: And going back to where I started,
[00:46:55] Unknown Guest: I think the open AI code red this morning
[00:46:58] Unknown Guest: was frankly, tantrum to it admission
[00:47:00] Unknown Guest: that we need to do our core mission for the next year
[00:47:03] Unknown Guest: and probably less,
[00:47:05] Unknown Guest: foot's around in other things.
[00:47:07] Unknown Guest: I mean, that sound you might hear
[00:47:08] Unknown Guest: is the consumer hardware product slipping out a little, right?
[00:47:12] Unknown Guest: But yeah, no, so I do believe
[00:47:14] Unknown Guest: that more of these apps are defensible.
[00:47:16] Unknown Guest: You know, I think the model providers will be there.
[00:47:19] Unknown Guest: I think coding is obvious.
[00:47:21] Unknown Guest: But even when you get much beyond that,
[00:47:23] Unknown Guest: I think if I was on the board of open AI,
[00:47:25] Unknown Guest: you know, it's gonna be like,
[00:47:26] Unknown Guest: when the chat GPT was and you were worth $2 trillion,
[00:47:31] Unknown Guest: let's not foot's around with, you know,
[00:47:33] Unknown Guest: little vertical markets that can be worth a couple
[00:47:35] Unknown Guest: a hundred million bucks.
[00:47:35] Unknown Guest: Why are you even talking about this?
[00:47:38] Especially when you have a, you know,
[00:47:41] Unknown Guest: everybody poked Paul Google and Microsoft said,
[00:47:44] Unknown Guest: we'll make them dance, open AI kind of laughed at them.
[00:47:47] Unknown Guest: And now they're poking back and you put all your effort
[00:47:51] Unknown Guest: behind that.
[00:47:52] Unknown Guest: We may have seen Pete, the models are gonna do everything.
[00:47:55] Unknown Guest: I mean, they're gonna do coding,
[00:47:56] Unknown Guest: but I don't know if they're gonna expand
[00:47:58] Unknown Guest: into all these verticals at that level, right?
[00:48:00] Unknown Guest: And then yeah, thank you, Jason.
[00:48:01] Unknown Guest: On the range wealth management,
[00:48:04] Unknown Guest: I think the interesting comment,
[00:48:05] Unknown Guest: and again, who always loads to just push our investments,
[00:48:07] Unknown Guest: but I think the big picture story there is,
[00:48:10] Unknown Guest: can you use AI to automate,
[00:48:12] Unknown Guest: not just sell software to wealth managers,
[00:48:14] Unknown Guest: but automate the business of wealth management.
[00:48:17] Unknown Guest: And this is the key sentence that I like,
[00:48:18] Unknown Guest: because I hate the word wealth management.
[00:48:20] Unknown Guest: The idea is you can go much further down
[00:48:24] Unknown Guest: the wealth continuum and give the same kind of product
[00:48:28] Unknown Guest: that the super rich get in terms of managing your stuff,
[00:48:30] Unknown Guest: managing your taxes, which is how he knows
[00:48:32] Unknown Guest: that the UK are now not to 50% and getting higher.
[00:48:36] Unknown Guest: So you wanna be able to manage your fares, file your taxes,
[00:48:40] Unknown Guest: and there's a whole ton of that work
[00:48:41] Unknown Guest: that's done expensively with humans
[00:48:43] Unknown Guest: that can be done really cheaply with AI,
[00:48:45] Unknown Guest: because it really is just follow the law,
[00:48:47] Unknown Guest: fill in the forms, do the work.
[00:48:50] Unknown Guest: And hopefully the idea there is you automate a lot of that,
[00:48:52] Unknown Guest: and then you can deliver a high quality product
[00:48:56] Unknown Guest: to a much broader marketplace.
[00:48:57] Unknown Guest: And one of the big picture things
[00:48:59] Unknown Guest: I think it's always true in investing is,
[00:49:01] Unknown Guest: whenever you see a product that only really rich people have,
[00:49:04] if you can find a way to get that in the hands
[00:49:06] Unknown Guest: of the rest of us, we all want it too.
[00:49:08] Yeah, the only thing is I wondered, sorry,
[00:49:09] Jason Calacanis: didn't mean to interrupt, just on,
[00:49:12] Jason Calacanis: what do we call it, the terrible tam?
[00:49:13] Jason Calacanis: It's a tam trap.
[00:49:14] Jason Calacanis: The tam trap.
[00:49:15] Jason Calacanis: On the wealth management,
[00:49:17] Jason Calacanis: what's the vendor called, sorry, I should know.
[00:49:18] Jason Calacanis: I bring it.
[00:49:19] Jason Calacanis: Range, range.
[00:49:20] Jason Calacanis: So the little echo.
[00:49:22] Jason Calacanis: I love it.
[00:49:23] Jason Calacanis: I get the problem.
[00:49:23] Jason Calacanis: Anyone's lived it that has gone through any of this stuff.
[00:49:26] Jason Calacanis: We can talk about it.
[00:49:27] Jason Calacanis: But I think you do have to be smart about the tam, right?
[00:49:30] Jason Calacanis: Because they're going to charge eight to 10 grand
[00:49:33] Jason Calacanis: for something that you pay a bunch of num nuts now,
[00:49:37] Jason Calacanis: 30, 40, 50 grand a year if you're wealthy, right?
[00:49:39] Jason Calacanis: Maybe more.
[00:49:40] Jason Calacanis: But it's not 10 times the price of the existing product, right?
[00:49:44] Jason Calacanis: You've got to be, you just got to be smart,
[00:49:45] Jason Calacanis: because you can pretend everyone in the world
[00:49:48] Jason Calacanis: will pay you 10 grand,
[00:49:49] Jason Calacanis: but you also have to be rational to get,
[00:49:51] Jason Calacanis: to not have a tam trap, right?
[00:49:54] Jason Calacanis: Because like, wealth friends trying to go public, right?
[00:49:56] Jason Calacanis: In theory, maybe it's a comp.
[00:49:58] Jason Calacanis: In theory, wealth front should be a $10 trillion company.
[00:50:01] Jason Calacanis: I mean, everyone could use this product, right?
[00:50:03] Jason Calacanis: But in reality, there is some tam limitation
[00:50:05] Jason Calacanis: for wealth front.
[00:50:06] Jason Calacanis: I totally agree.
[00:50:06] Jason Calacanis: And it's all about segment.
[00:50:08] Unknown Guest: I love wealth, as a comment here,
[00:50:09] Unknown Guest: the wealth front and betterment,
[00:50:10] Unknown Guest: those, I really love those companies.
[00:50:12] Unknown Guest: Because again, it's back to the same thing.
[00:50:14] Unknown Guest: I get uncomfortable in the wealth discussion,
[00:50:17] Unknown Guest: because like, who gives a damn
[00:50:18] Unknown Guest: what the social wealthy have to deal with, right?
[00:50:20] Unknown Guest: Well, I loved about wealth,
[00:50:21] Unknown Guest: and what I like about these is,
[00:50:23] Unknown Guest: wealth front was saying, even paying 50, 70 bips
[00:50:26] Unknown Guest: to some, to manage your money is crazy,
[00:50:29] Unknown Guest: because we can just put it in this automatic thing
[00:50:32] Unknown Guest: and do it automatically and for 10 bips.
[00:50:35] Unknown Guest: And the thing about those businesses,
[00:50:36] Unknown Guest: your tam comment, it is,
[00:50:39] Unknown Guest: they actually take a long time to build,
[00:50:42] Unknown Guest: because the whole value profit is which are getting you less,
[00:50:44] Unknown Guest: and you just get to come upon more.
[00:50:46] Unknown Guest: But in the end, they're lovely businesses.
[00:50:47] Unknown Guest: And we looked at, actually not wealth on but betterment,
[00:50:49] Unknown Guest: 10 years ago, and we figured it would take about this long,
[00:50:52] Unknown Guest: 10 years to just build,
[00:50:54] Unknown Guest: because if you're charging 1% of assets,
[00:50:56] Unknown Guest: a billion is a lot of money.
[00:50:58] Unknown Guest: If you're only charging one 10th of that,
[00:50:59] Unknown Guest: you need 10 billion to get to the same place.
[00:51:02] Unknown Guest: And if you're targeting people with less money,
[00:51:04] Unknown Guest: by definition, it takes longer.
[00:51:06] Unknown Guest: So these businesses take a long time to build,
[00:51:09] Unknown Guest: but I think when they do, they're way more powerful
[00:51:11] Unknown Guest: than some corner quote, wealth manager that's really good,
[00:51:14] Unknown Guest: because he takes you golfing and gives you a PowerPoint
[00:51:17] Unknown Guest: once a quarter about how badly a bunch of doing
[00:51:19] Unknown Guest: and the really far away.
[00:51:20] Unknown Guest: So I like that.
[00:51:21] Unknown Guest: Or even better, they ask me if I want exposure
[00:51:23] Jason Calacanis: to private equity and venture.
[00:51:25] Jason Calacanis: That's the main value I get from Morgan Stanley.
[00:51:28] Jason Calacanis: Hey Jason, it's your advisor this quarter.
[00:51:30] Jason Calacanis: I can get you into a hot venture fund you've never heard of.
[00:51:33] Jason Calacanis: Stabbing's Lemkin 4.
[00:51:37] Jason Calacanis: The returns are negative at the moment,
[00:51:39] Jason Calacanis: but it's a lengthy J curve and it's a hot deal.
[00:51:41] Jason Calacanis: It's a 3 in 30.
[00:51:42] Jason Calacanis: Yeah, it's a 3 in 30.
[00:51:43] Jason Calacanis: Triple layered SBV.
[00:51:46] Jason Calacanis: Have you ever looked at my account?
[00:51:47] Jason Calacanis: Do you know anything about me?
[00:51:49] Harry Stebbings: OK, I didn't actually, sorry, I didn't mean to be divisive.
[00:51:52] Harry Stebbings: I didn't like this deal.
[00:51:54] Harry Stebbings: I saw this and I thought, oh, god.
[00:51:57] Harry Stebbings: Sorry.
[00:51:58] Harry Stebbings: I didn't see it.
[00:51:58] Harry Stebbings: Why don't you like it?
[00:51:59] Harry Stebbings: What big business and what good business,
[00:52:02] Harry Stebbings: really big, has been built in the wealth management space?
[00:52:04] Harry Stebbings: Wealthfront?
[00:52:05] Harry Stebbings: Well, it's a very good point.
[00:52:08] Harry Stebbings: Just post, post, post, post, post, post, post.
[00:52:11] Harry Stebbings: OK, one very old.
[00:52:12] Harry Stebbings: But we're looking at wealthfront.
[00:52:14] What, 17 years, index and every good investor and that.
[00:52:18] Harry Stebbings: How big is that?
[00:52:20] Harry Stebbings: In the opportunity, close world that we live in.
[00:52:22] Harry Stebbings: But you have to.
[00:52:22] Harry Stebbings: Really?
[00:52:24] Jason Calacanis: The reward for the question is, why does, OK, listen,
[00:52:27] Jason Calacanis: there's a gap.
[00:52:29] Jason Calacanis: There's the wealthfront in Vanguard at the bottom.
[00:52:31] Jason Calacanis: I want to hear Rory's thoughts.
[00:52:33] Jason Calacanis: And then there's the world's crappiest product,
[00:52:35] Jason Calacanis: which are Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,
[00:52:37] Jason Calacanis: which take 1% of your assets and do nothing.
[00:52:40] Jason Calacanis: I can see other than give you loans,
[00:52:41] Jason Calacanis: which are very valuable, right, for folks that don't know.
[00:52:44] Jason Calacanis: Like, literally, if you're sitting on 50 million
[00:52:46] Jason Calacanis: of NVIDIA stock right now, you can sell it
[00:52:49] Jason Calacanis: and pay $25 million in tax or a bank will give you a loan.
[00:52:53] Jason Calacanis: Now, it's not cheap today.
[00:52:54] Jason Calacanis: It's 6%.
[00:52:55] Jason Calacanis: But that's a lot better than 50% if you can do both.
[00:52:57] Jason Calacanis: That's the only product I know.
[00:52:59] Jason Calacanis: They'll tell you they'll help you with your trust.
[00:53:02] Jason Calacanis: They don't.
[00:53:02] Jason Calacanis: They refer you to someone that doesn't call you back.
[00:53:04] Jason Calacanis: They'll tell you how to do with your taxes.
[00:53:06] Jason Calacanis: And they'll tell you we're not allowed to talk about taxes.
[00:53:08] Jason Calacanis: So they can't really do anything except give you a loan.
[00:53:10] Jason Calacanis: There is such a gap in the middle of AI can do
[00:53:12] Jason Calacanis: estate planning taxes all this.
[00:53:14] Jason Calacanis: So Murray challenging me if I'm wrong.
[00:53:17] Jason Calacanis: The question is, if AI enables it,
[00:53:19] Jason Calacanis: then something that was shitty to sorry, Crummy,
[00:53:22] Jason Calacanis: to Harry's point might become great if AI let you do it,
[00:53:25] Jason Calacanis: right, it might become great.
[00:53:26] Jason Calacanis: This episode was brought to you.
[00:53:27] Jason Calacanis: It's like Goldman Sachs, 12 management.
[00:53:29] Harry Stebbings: That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:53:31] Seriously, first of all, I got to tell you just nail
[00:53:33] Unknown Guest: that exactly the value proposition.
[00:53:35] Unknown Guest: Yeah, I like it.
[00:53:36] Unknown Guest: You deliver trust, you deliver a state, you deliver all taxes.
[00:53:39] Unknown Guest: Because when you have to file your taxes,
[00:53:40] Unknown Guest: the fact that you do your estate with one person,
[00:53:43] Unknown Guest: you do your taxes with another person,
[00:53:44] Unknown Guest: you well manage with a third person is absurd.
[00:53:46] Unknown Guest: It should all be on the one move.
[00:53:47] Unknown Guest: But I want to go back to your comment, Harry, on the well front.
[00:53:50] Unknown Guest: Because again, I'm always uneasy just push out companies.
[00:53:52] Unknown Guest: So let's talk about it.
[00:53:53] Unknown Guest: I think an excellent comment it's not ours.
[00:53:55] Unknown Guest: Yes, it's taken a long time to compound to here, right?
[00:53:59] Unknown Guest: But not everything is a tech first
[00:54:02] Unknown Guest: where the adoption cycles are five years.
[00:54:05] Unknown Guest: I think when you launch an investment in a company like
[00:54:07] Unknown Guest: a well front, the adoption cycle of something like that
[00:54:10] Unknown Guest: is going to be 10 or 15 years.
[00:54:11] Unknown Guest: So in my view, it's just on track.
[00:54:13] Unknown Guest: And the fundamentals are lovely.
[00:54:15] Unknown Guest: Because at scale, asset management is a wonderful business.
[00:54:18] Unknown Guest: They are providing a cheaper product than anyone else,
[00:54:21] Unknown Guest: at 10 bips.
[00:54:23] And over, they've lined up a bunch of millennial
[00:54:26] Unknown Guest: and whatever the generation, a little bit, all the 30-year-old
[00:54:28] Unknown Guest: and 40-year-olds.
[00:54:30] Unknown Guest: And over the next 10 or 15 years, that generation's going
[00:54:33] Unknown Guest: to get rich.
[00:54:34] Unknown Guest: They're going to get rich with wealth,
[00:54:35] Unknown Guest: they're going to keep them money there.
[00:54:37] Unknown Guest: And it's going to be a compounding machine.
[00:54:39] Unknown Guest: Just like Charlie Swab was a compounding machine,
[00:54:41] Unknown Guest: when they started in the 70s with cheap brokerage,
[00:54:44] Unknown Guest: it took a long time.
[00:54:45] Unknown Guest: They went through a lot of the actual owned by B of A
[00:54:47] Unknown Guest: and then spun out in the 90s.
[00:54:48] Unknown Guest: I was there.
[00:54:49] Unknown Guest: But in the end, it just compounds.
[00:54:52] Unknown Guest: Because you just over time the only good thing about it
[00:54:55] Unknown Guest: is it does compound.
[00:54:56] Unknown Guest: And early on, wealth management in any form
[00:54:58] Unknown Guest: is a tough business because it takes a long time to build.
[00:55:02] Unknown Guest: But when it does build and wealth runs
[00:55:03] Unknown Guest: is over that gap now,
[00:55:05] Unknown Guest: it's going to be there for the next 30 years
[00:55:07] Unknown Guest: in front of you where there's a lot of your tech companies.
[00:55:09] Unknown Guest: What?
[00:55:09] Unknown Guest: I get you on the compounding machine
[00:55:11] Harry Stebbings: and I share your view in the beauty of those businesses.
[00:55:14] Harry Stebbings: But actually, you're competing for dollars
[00:55:16] Harry Stebbings: against the same people like your Kleiner Perkins
[00:55:19] Harry Stebbings: or like your Andrews and Horits,
[00:55:21] Harry Stebbings: where LPs can put money in their funds or your funds
[00:55:24] Harry Stebbings: at a B and C stage.
[00:55:26] Harry Stebbings: And they are in Gleene and they are in Rapplid.
[00:55:29] Harry Stebbings: And they are in the races to 100 million
[00:55:31] Harry Stebbings: in Fast and Me Never Scene.
[00:55:32] Harry Stebbings: And those LPs are going, wow.
[00:55:35] Harry Stebbings: Those funds are that more exciting.
[00:55:37] Harry Stebbings: And you're going, no, but it's compounding.
[00:55:39] Harry Stebbings: It's Charles Schwab II's coming.
[00:55:42] Harry Stebbings: I promise you, watch the pod.
[00:55:44] Jason Calacanis: I don't know that that's 100% true though, Harry.
[00:55:46] Jason Calacanis: I think it's 80% true, right?
[00:55:48] Jason Calacanis: I think if you're going into raised capital for your fund
[00:55:50] Jason Calacanis: and you're being compared to Gleene and everything else,
[00:55:53] Jason Calacanis: but what I think, what I've,
[00:55:54] Jason Calacanis: I mean, Rory has more experience.
[00:55:55] Jason Calacanis: You get, I think as long as you have the numbers,
[00:55:57] Jason Calacanis: actually LPs are kind of excited
[00:55:59] Jason Calacanis: if you have a slightly different way to get there.
[00:56:02] Slightly, isn't?
[00:56:02] But you've got to have top 10% numbers.
[00:56:04] Jason Calacanis: Do you think so there?
[00:56:05] Harry Stebbings: If you've got companies that are kind of,
[00:56:07] Harry Stebbings: and actually to your point or to our point on like,
[00:56:09] Harry Stebbings: hey, bluntly growth rates are so much higher,
[00:56:12] Harry Stebbings: growth expectations so much higher.
[00:56:13] Harry Stebbings: If it is a slower compounder,
[00:56:15] Harry Stebbings: the net is round as less certain than ever.
[00:56:18] Harry Stebbings: It's less guaranteed.
[00:56:19] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, but LPs are looking backwards.
[00:56:21] Jason Calacanis: If you're sitting on multiple high performing funds,
[00:56:24] Jason Calacanis: you're going to get a fair amount of flexibility today, right?
[00:56:26] Jason Calacanis: I think the point is that it's hard to not be seduced
[00:56:29] Jason Calacanis: by the hottest deals today.
[00:56:31] Jason Calacanis: And by the way, LPs love to see great fall on invest.
[00:56:34] Harry Stebbings: So, I sequir came into this and I'm dreaming.
[00:56:37] Harry Stebbings: But I want to push back a little.
[00:56:38] Unknown Guest: I do take on board your point.
[00:56:40] Unknown Guest: And there's no doubt that the velocity of validation
[00:56:44] Unknown Guest: is super strong for AI companies right now.
[00:56:46] Unknown Guest: If you want to do a deal with the highest probability
[00:56:48] Unknown Guest: of a step up in the next six to nine months,
[00:56:51] Unknown Guest: you should do an AI company that's raised at a billion pre
[00:56:53] Unknown Guest: because 40% of the unicorns in Q1,
[00:56:55] Unknown Guest: it was, I said, 23% last week,
[00:56:57] Unknown Guest: one of my colleagues are correct, it'd be 40%.
[00:57:00] 40% of the unicorns that raised in Q1
[00:57:03] Unknown Guest: to the unicorn for the first time
[00:57:05] Unknown Guest: have already had a follow-on round.
[00:57:07] Unknown Guest: So, I think how are you exactly right?
[00:57:08] Unknown Guest: If you want to buy short-term momentum,
[00:57:10] Unknown Guest: that's a great place to play.
[00:57:12] Unknown Guest: And it's not just short-term momentum,
[00:57:13] Unknown Guest: it's also driven by great performance.
[00:57:15] Unknown Guest: So, yes, that's absolutely a good slug of what you're doing.
[00:57:18] Unknown Guest: But in the end, the market in the end,
[00:57:21] Unknown Guest: the biggest uncertainty is not,
[00:57:24] Unknown Guest: can you get a mark up?
[00:57:24] Unknown Guest: That's nice.
[00:57:25] Unknown Guest: The biggest uncertainty end is,
[00:57:26] Unknown Guest: can you build a big company here or not?
[00:57:29] Unknown Guest: And there's so few times when you can say,
[00:57:31] Unknown Guest: I believe you can build a big company here,
[00:57:34] that you shouldn't then screen out and say,
[00:57:35] Unknown Guest: oh, I can build a big company,
[00:57:36] Unknown Guest: but it might take a little too long.
[00:57:38] Unknown Guest: Because there's a rule in engineering
[00:57:41] Unknown Guest: that you're only as accurate as you're least accurate variable.
[00:57:44] Unknown Guest: In other words, if you have six or seven variables
[00:57:45] Unknown Guest: that goes into something,
[00:57:47] Unknown Guest: your accuracy is determined by the thing
[00:57:49] Unknown Guest: no has a wide as variance.
[00:57:51] Unknown Guest: And if you have high certainty
[00:57:53] Unknown Guest: that something can be a company,
[00:57:55] Unknown Guest: that's the hard thing to do.
[00:57:56] Unknown Guest: If you've got that and everything else,
[00:57:58] Unknown Guest: you can adjust for valuation,
[00:57:59] Unknown Guest: you can adjust for time, et cetera.
[00:58:01] Unknown Guest: I would love to be in wealth front, for example.
[00:58:03] Unknown Guest: I think it's just an awesome company.
[00:58:05] Unknown Guest: And even if you get,
[00:58:06] Unknown Guest: I think that will compound and you'll hold it
[00:58:08] Unknown Guest: and 15, 20 years from now,
[00:58:10] Unknown Guest: and it's going to start to jourid if to AI,
[00:58:12] Unknown Guest: it's not a love that space.
[00:58:13] Unknown Guest: It's where I play once at a time.
[00:58:14] Unknown Guest: Can you, okay, let's do it this way, Harry.
[00:58:16] Unknown Guest: 90, I think, swab went public in either 82 or 83.
[00:58:20] Unknown Guest: It's public today.
[00:58:21] Unknown Guest: It's worth $60, 80 billion.
[00:58:24] And then the five tech companies that went public in 1983.
[00:58:27] Dude, you fucking kidding me.
[00:58:28] Harry Stebbings: I was born in 96.
[00:58:30] Harry Stebbings: But my point is this, tech companies,
[00:58:34] Unknown Guest: they come quick and most them go quick.
[00:58:35] Unknown Guest: Now, by the way, if I'd said 1986,
[00:58:37] Unknown Guest: you could have come back to me and said,
[00:58:40] Unknown Guest: Microsoft, Oracle and Thun,
[00:58:42] Unknown Guest: if I'd said, I think 82, you could have said Apple,
[00:58:45] Unknown Guest: that's why I think I picked 83.
[00:58:46] Unknown Guest: The point is, is that these singular different companies
[00:58:49] Unknown Guest: that are a little like, you know, mid-andals,
[00:58:51] Unknown Guest: these companies that are off the beaten track
[00:58:53] Unknown Guest: and are just a different thing,
[00:58:54] Unknown Guest: they often take longer to compound,
[00:58:56] Unknown Guest: but they end up with more empty space.
[00:58:58] Unknown Guest: And as I say, Schwab has compounded
[00:58:59] Unknown Guest: for three or four decades and God's you with your inner.
[00:59:02] Unknown Guest: I get it.
[00:59:03] Harry Stebbings: I get it.
[00:59:04] Harry Stebbings: I'm sorry.
[00:59:05] Harry Stebbings: I mean, I just think we're playing a relevant game.
[00:59:07] Harry Stebbings: And I think this is the honest truth about new age venture.
[00:59:10] Harry Stebbings: We're playing a relevant game
[00:59:11] Harry Stebbings: where round praises four rounds in a year,
[00:59:13] Harry Stebbings: where media matters more than ever before.
[00:59:15] Harry Stebbings: The all of us here.
[00:59:17] Harry Stebbings: And where you're like, ah, slow compounding coming soon.
[00:59:21] Harry Stebbings: Play flow.
[00:59:21] Harry Stebbings: It's just a tough game.
[00:59:23] Harry Stebbings: And I think LPs are seduced by incredible
[00:59:28] Harry Stebbings: follow-on investors, quick up rounds and numbers still.
[00:59:31] Harry Stebbings: And I'd rather be playing that game
[00:59:34] Harry Stebbings: than the, it's coming.
[00:59:36] Harry Stebbings: And keep it going.
[00:59:37] Unknown Guest: And you write Harry, you shouldn't have been get provided.
[00:59:40] Unknown Guest: You also write about the underlying investments.
[00:59:43] Unknown Guest: And so if you play that game and you're wrong
[00:59:46] Unknown Guest: about the investments,
[00:59:47] Unknown Guest: then you just be the guy who did a large high price runs
[00:59:49] Unknown Guest: and a deal that didn't work.
[00:59:51] Unknown Guest: Right?
[00:59:52] Unknown Guest: So I agree with you.
[00:59:54] Unknown Guest: But again, I go back to my comment.
[00:59:56] Unknown Guest: When you have high certainty that a big company can be built here,
[01:00:00] Unknown Guest: you wait that more highly than everything else.
[01:00:02] Unknown Guest: I think actually Peter Thiel,
[01:00:03] Unknown Guest: as all intelligence venture comments,
[01:00:05] Unknown Guest: when you go back long enough,
[01:00:06] Unknown Guest: you discover Peter Thiel made them already.
[01:00:08] Unknown Guest: I think he said somewhere in his book,
[01:00:10] Unknown Guest: something to the effect of,
[01:00:11] Unknown Guest: all that matters is can you build a big company here?
[01:00:14] Unknown Guest: And literally he said,
[01:00:14] Unknown Guest: because that rule is so hard,
[01:00:17] because it's so hard to find them,
[01:00:19] they have no other rules,
[01:00:21] Unknown Guest: because their perspective is,
[01:00:22] Unknown Guest: once I filter for that,
[01:00:23] Unknown Guest: I can't have any bullshit rules on stage, on sector,
[01:00:27] Unknown Guest: I just want big.
[01:00:28] Unknown Guest: And it's what gave them the courage
[01:00:30] Unknown Guest: to do biotech defense and supper.
[01:00:32] Unknown Guest: And I went out as brilliant of that, obviously.
[01:00:34] Unknown Guest: But I think it's some version of that rule,
[01:00:36] Unknown Guest: which is when you see a company that can be big
[01:00:39] Unknown Guest: and you see it's tracking can be big,
[01:00:41] Unknown Guest: prioritize that over hype and formal.
[01:00:44] Harry Stebbings: Well, can I be absolutely savage?
[01:00:46] Harry Stebbings: Do you have to be in that slow compounding picking,
[01:00:51] Harry Stebbings: which is, because there's two worlds in venture,
[01:00:53] Harry Stebbings: there's obvious and really, really competitive,
[01:00:57] Harry Stebbings: insane growth, really, really obvious.
[01:00:59] Harry Stebbings: And then there's, I'm going to be smarter,
[01:01:02] Harry Stebbings: pick the compounder, see beauty where others don't.
[01:01:05] Harry Stebbings: Do you have to be here respectfully,
[01:01:08] Harry Stebbings: because you're sitting in the Valley at Series B,
[01:01:11] Harry Stebbings: and you're against Andrews and founders fund,
[01:01:14] Harry Stebbings: sequer, and you can't beat them.
[01:01:16] Harry Stebbings: I think you have to do both, and you can do both.
[01:01:19] Unknown Guest: I think again, I'm going back to my commenters,
[01:01:21] Unknown Guest: I'm not sitting here going,
[01:01:22] Unknown Guest: I want to filter for X, Y, or Z,
[01:01:23] Unknown Guest: I want to filter for great companies.
[01:01:26] Then I have to win them, and you're right.
[01:01:27] Unknown Guest: If you're identifying a great AI company in XYZ space,
[01:01:33] Unknown Guest: then you're going to find way more competition,
[01:01:35] Unknown Guest: which means you'll lose, or you'll win,
[01:01:37] Unknown Guest: and you'll pay the market price to win, which won't be cheap.
[01:01:40] Unknown Guest: Right?
[01:01:41] Unknown Guest: And that's one way to make money.
[01:01:42] Unknown Guest: That's most of what we do.
[01:01:44] But you can also go and look at space and we go,
[01:01:47] Unknown Guest: oh, I think this is interesting and differentiated.
[01:01:49] Unknown Guest: And as long as I have the same conviction on the ultimate,
[01:01:52] Unknown Guest: you can do both.
[01:01:54] Unknown Guest: So you're trying to apply a momentum and hardness rule,
[01:01:57] Unknown Guest: and I'm trying to apply a will that be a big company in the end rule.
[01:02:00] Unknown Guest: And I get the interim consequences.
[01:02:02] Unknown Guest: You know, there is no, to be very clear,
[01:02:05] Unknown Guest: someone said it to me 20 years ago was an LP, right?
[01:02:09] Unknown Guest: He said, there's no such thing as blue collar ventures.
[01:02:12] Unknown Guest: It was a brutal comment, but I think it's your point, Harry, right?
[01:02:15] Unknown Guest: Like there's no such thing as off-value,
[01:02:18] Unknown Guest: random and non-cool stuff.
[01:02:19] Unknown Guest: At the end of the day, we're building high-grote companies
[01:02:26] Unknown Guest: and you're not going to make it on value.
[01:02:27] Unknown Guest: You're not trying to choose on value.
[01:02:29] Unknown Guest: You're trying to choose on certainty of a big outcome.
[01:02:32] You know, for what it's worth, listen,
[01:02:33] Jason Calacanis: I think it might be a fool's errand to invest in things
[01:02:38] Jason Calacanis: that you're just very interested in,
[01:02:39] Jason Calacanis: but I think there is an advantage to it.
[01:02:40] Jason Calacanis: And I'll tell you what I'm interested in for 26, 27.
[01:02:42] Jason Calacanis: This is why I like Roy's investment.
[01:02:44] Jason Calacanis: Is, I know this sounds obvious,
[01:02:46] Jason Calacanis: but AI for coatings great,
[01:02:48] Jason Calacanis: but we didn't even figure that out,
[01:02:49] Jason Calacanis: clawed figure that out.
[01:02:50] Jason Calacanis: Cursed it and figured this out,
[01:02:51] Jason Calacanis: repwooded, lovable, and bolted and figured it out.
[01:02:54] Jason Calacanis: I can tell you the story, clawed figured it out,
[01:02:56] Jason Calacanis: and the topic, the guys, you know,
[01:02:57] Jason Calacanis: once they quit open air, they figured it out
[01:02:59] Jason Calacanis: and everyone grafted on this, including gamma.
[01:03:01] Jason Calacanis: What I like is the next generation.
[01:03:03] Jason Calacanis: Can AI take large markets like wealth management
[01:03:06] Jason Calacanis: that don't work today, that can AI really for real
[01:03:10] Jason Calacanis: with clawed seven and everything,
[01:03:13] Jason Calacanis: and utterly disrupted?
[01:03:15] Jason Calacanis: And I think that can be huge.
[01:03:17] Jason Calacanis: And I'll give you an example.
[01:03:19] Jason Calacanis: Like I set up three trusts, okay?
[01:03:21] Jason Calacanis: And the wealth management didn't help at all,
[01:03:24] Jason Calacanis: and then I went to the lawyers, okay?
[01:03:25] Jason Calacanis: And it took me 11 months to set up three trusts.
[01:03:29] Jason Calacanis: And I said, I'm really frustrated.
[01:03:30] Jason Calacanis: This took too long to this guy that's like
[01:03:32] Jason Calacanis: a celebrated trust learner, and so he's like,
[01:03:34] Jason Calacanis: well, good news.
[01:03:35] Jason Calacanis: Most of my clients never even finished them.
[01:03:36] Jason Calacanis: I'm not saying the man I'm investment
[01:03:38] Jason Calacanis: isn't the right thing today.
[01:03:39] Jason Calacanis: If you can come in with AI and magically take
[01:03:41] Jason Calacanis: every single frustrating part,
[01:03:44] Jason Calacanis: how many Americans, like I think the Wall Street Journal
[01:03:46] Jason Calacanis: just said today, the average American retiring
[01:03:48] Jason Calacanis: is like $1.8 million in cash and equity, okay?
[01:03:51] Jason Calacanis: If you can take all the friction out of that,
[01:03:54] Jason Calacanis: all the friction out of retirement, wealth management,
[01:03:57] Jason Calacanis: investing, trust, redeploying, QSPS, and everything,
[01:04:01] Jason Calacanis: because of AI, I think you could build a $20, 40,
[01:04:06] Jason Calacanis: $50 billion company, and I would at least want to take
[01:04:10] Jason Calacanis: the meeting, because this is something that,
[01:04:13] Jason Calacanis: if AI, okay, listen, I'm just interested in intellectually,
[01:04:16] Jason Calacanis: can AI solve some of the biggest headaches that we see,
[01:04:20] Jason Calacanis: that maybe you don't see everything,
[01:04:21] Jason Calacanis: maybe they're an environmental compliance,
[01:04:22] Jason Calacanis: maybe they're in other things, maybe they're,
[01:04:25] Jason Calacanis: but it's at least worth the meeting
[01:04:27] Jason Calacanis: to see if they can utterly disrupt what's done, right?
[01:04:30] Jason Calacanis: Jason, I totally agree.
[01:04:32] Unknown Guest: I really like the pitch here, which is,
[01:04:34] Unknown Guest: it's not the ultra-well, they got a million people
[01:04:36] Unknown Guest: who'll slaughter them and do their work for them
[01:04:38] Unknown Guest: and charge them a gazillion dollars.
[01:04:40] Unknown Guest: It stays the entrepreneur,
[01:04:42] Unknown Guest: it's the doctor, it's the dentist,
[01:04:44] Unknown Guest: who's earning good coin,
[01:04:45] Unknown Guest: because we discussed earlier,
[01:04:46] Unknown Guest: dentists and doctors are well paid,
[01:04:48] Unknown Guest: but their affairs are modestly complex,
[01:04:50] Unknown Guest: but they don't want to screw up their Roth IRA or withdrawal,
[01:04:53] Unknown Guest: they want to leave their house to the kids,
[01:04:55] Unknown Guest: they don't want to have a big estate tax problem,
[01:04:57] Unknown Guest: those are the kind of things more complex than nothing,
[01:05:00] Unknown Guest: but not where you can spend $20,000 on the lawyer to fix it,
[01:05:03] Unknown Guest: that I think that's a huge market.
[01:05:05] Unknown Guest: Even, I'm sure people in the North care know this,
[01:05:07] Unknown Guest: but in the end of the U.S.,
[01:05:10] Unknown Guest: unlike the U.K., everyone has to file their own taxes,
[01:05:14] Unknown Guest: which is just one, I mean, I paid taxes
[01:05:16] Unknown Guest: in Ireland, England and the States,
[01:05:17] Unknown Guest: so I don't, the different systems.
[01:05:19] Unknown Guest: Everyone has to file this God awful tax return every year,
[01:05:22] Unknown Guest: and the many of your affairs get even mildly complex,
[01:05:25] Unknown Guest: you do a rental property, you have a distribution,
[01:05:28] Unknown Guest: you have a capital game,
[01:05:29] Unknown Guest: because an investment you made in a restaurant,
[01:05:31] Unknown Guest: suddenly your tax affairs are complex,
[01:05:33] Unknown Guest: and if you screw it up, you're gonna pay more money.
[01:05:35] Unknown Guest: And those are the people who need that kind of mass market,
[01:05:38] Unknown Guest: wealth advice on how to handle their affairs better.
[01:05:41] Unknown Guest: And right now, it's a disparate group of attorneys,
[01:05:47] Unknown Guest: countenance, and it's quite messy.
[01:05:49] Unknown Guest: And I do think, I like a lot of other markets,
[01:05:51] Unknown Guest: it's a little like healthcare,
[01:05:53] Unknown Guest: that your prior speaker was talking about.
[01:05:55] Unknown Guest: There's a whole bunch of this,
[01:05:57] Unknown Guest: no-able, but nonetheless, complex information,
[01:06:00] Unknown Guest: that has to be assembled and martyled,
[01:06:03] Unknown Guest: and at the right time, the person who has the question
[01:06:05] Unknown Guest: has to get the right answer.
[01:06:07] Unknown Guest: That question can be what form of cancer
[01:06:09] Unknown Guest: is this based on the CT scan,
[01:06:10] Unknown Guest: or how much do I owe to the US government based on these facts?
[01:06:14] Unknown Guest: But you want the right answer at the right time,
[01:06:16] Unknown Guest: and it turns out machines do that a lot better than humans.
[01:06:20] I take away as you need a new wealth manager, Dave.
[01:06:23] Harry Stebbings: Hi.
[01:06:24] Harry Stebbings: Seriously, a go-win-a-go-win.
[01:06:25] Harry Stebbings: Okay, I'm not just doing the go-win-a-go-win.
[01:06:27] Harry Stebbings: How about it?
[01:06:28] Harry Stebbings: I need to introduce you to, to, to, to,
[01:06:29] Unknown Guest: I mean, how-y, one comment here.
[01:06:31] Unknown Guest: I believe you.
[01:06:32] Unknown Guest: Not everyone has a wealth management problem, Harry.
[01:06:34] Unknown Guest: How about, how about we, we, we focus back on the problems
[01:06:36] Unknown Guest: of the people, the founders that are trying to build wealth
[01:06:39] Unknown Guest: rather than you as a rich guy trying to spend it.
[01:06:41] Unknown Guest: Okay, come on.
[01:06:44] I'm the humble pork cost, D'Aurory.
[01:06:46] Jason Calacanis: I believe that I will disrupt some of these categories
[01:06:48] Jason Calacanis: and build huge businesses, okay?
[01:06:49] Jason Calacanis: I believe it.
[01:06:50] Jason Calacanis: Maybe be capital-efficient until you prove it.
[01:06:52] Jason Calacanis: If, if Rory's deal does 100 million growing,
[01:06:55] Jason Calacanis: 150% or 200%, everyone will flood into this.
[01:06:58] Jason Calacanis: Okay, absolutely.
[01:06:59] Jason Calacanis: And say it made, it made no sense back in the day.
[01:07:01] Jason Calacanis: So, I mean, not every founder can directly compete
[01:07:05] Jason Calacanis: with cursor as founders.
[01:07:06] Jason Calacanis: Like, we have to play to our strengths.
[01:07:08] Jason Calacanis: And if you find someone, like, I might have invested,
[01:07:10] Jason Calacanis: just because I'm passionate.
[01:07:11] Jason Calacanis: Maybe it was a bad idea.
[01:07:12] Jason Calacanis: I mean, I, I'm into it, but you might have convinced me,
[01:07:14] Jason Calacanis: maybe just don't spend all of it.
[01:07:16] Jason Calacanis: I think it did.
[01:07:17] Jason Calacanis: It did, it did.
[01:07:18] Jason Calacanis: It did, it did.
[01:07:19] Jason Calacanis: Did he, he'll bring you into the deal.
[01:07:20] Jason Calacanis: Not bring me into the deal.
[01:07:21] Jason Calacanis: I, I think, Chef Harry, because Jason's
[01:07:24] Unknown Guest: readily important point that I think is relevant
[01:07:26] Unknown Guest: to our wider founders.
[01:07:27] Unknown Guest: I think Jason, seriously, your discipline as a founder
[01:07:31] Unknown Guest: on capital is exactly proportional to, you know,
[01:07:34] Unknown Guest: in part two, how hot the market is perceived to be.
[01:07:36] Unknown Guest: And if you're playing a game that's in a market
[01:07:38] Unknown Guest: where you need to make progress before you can raise,
[01:07:40] Unknown Guest: then you, then you don't have the ramp for raises
[01:07:43] Unknown Guest: before Friday's strategy.
[01:07:46] Unknown Guest: You have the capital discipline to prove your point.
[01:07:48] Unknown Guest: In the end, if you prove it, you'll get a lot of money
[01:07:51] Unknown Guest: to get the capital.
[01:07:52] Unknown Guest: But I think Jason, that was a,
[01:07:53] Unknown Guest: frankly, a spot on comment.
[01:07:54] Unknown Guest: We could send you as a board member, literally.
[01:07:56] Unknown Guest: It's like, here guys, little value, if you prove it,
[01:07:59] Unknown Guest: the world will beat beat in the path to your door.
[01:08:02] Unknown Guest: But if you have proof it, you'll be screwed.
[01:08:04] Harry Stebbings: They'll get it done.
[01:08:05] Harry Stebbings: I think that's a great note to close on.
[01:08:07] Harry Stebbings: Guys, thank you so much for being part of a live show.
[01:08:12] Harry Stebbings: There's no Kelsey Quickfire?
[01:08:13] Harry Stebbings: There's no, well, you want to call her Kelsey Quickfire?
[01:08:15] Harry Stebbings: Yeah.
[01:08:16] Harry Stebbings: The one Quickfire is super bass is now at five billion.
[01:08:20] Harry Stebbings: Lovable as at six.
[01:08:22] Harry Stebbings: Now obviously, lovable uses super bass for every instance.
[01:08:26] Harry Stebbings: Would you rather be in super bass?
[01:08:30] Harry Stebbings: Or would you rather be in lovable?
[01:08:32] Unknown Guest: I'll say lovable.
[01:08:33] And I'll tell you why.
[01:08:36] Unknown Guest: I think super bass is benefiting
[01:08:37] Unknown Guest: by the trend of vibe coding.
[01:08:41] Unknown Guest: And lovable is a bet fundamentally.
[01:08:43] Unknown Guest: It's in the front end monetizing on vibe coding.
[01:08:46] Unknown Guest: One of two things happened.
[01:08:47] Unknown Guest: I'd have vibe coding as a category or it's not.
[01:08:50] Unknown Guest: If it's not a category, border the most screwed.
[01:08:52] Unknown Guest: And if it is a category, lovable gets more of the money
[01:08:55] Unknown Guest: than super bass.
[01:08:56] Unknown Guest: Just because it's the front end and it gets,
[01:08:58] Unknown Guest: I don't know, 20 bucks and they pay two over to super bass.
[01:09:00] Unknown Guest: Some version like that.
[01:09:01] Unknown Guest: So if you're in a highly whiskey category,
[01:09:04] Unknown Guest: the dumb best is to be well, if I win, I get a little,
[01:09:07] Unknown Guest: but if I lose, I lose 100%.
[01:09:09] Unknown Guest: You may as well be in for a penny versus in for a pound,
[01:09:11] Unknown Guest: as we would say in the UK.
[01:09:13] Unknown Guest: And the thing about the lovable bet is,
[01:09:15] Unknown Guest: if you win, you're going to win big,
[01:09:16] Unknown Guest: which of course is why a smart young man like you
[01:09:19] Unknown Guest: are in lovable, how are you?
[01:09:21] Unknown Guest: Yeah, I thought I'd put in one pitch for you there, dude.
[01:09:23] Unknown Guest: Thank you so much.
[01:09:24] Unknown Guest: I would take super bass.
[01:09:25] What?
[01:09:25] I would take super bass.
[01:09:26] Unknown Guest: No, I'll tell you what, for what it's worth,
[01:09:28] Jason Calacanis: this is how I'm feeling today because of stability.
[01:09:31] Jason Calacanis: I think super bass is a harder problem to solve.
[01:09:33] Jason Calacanis: Yep.
[01:09:33] Jason Calacanis: And so right now today, this is where I'm conservative.
[01:09:36] Jason Calacanis: I want, there's just so much change.
[01:09:39] Jason Calacanis: I don't know what Google's going to do.
[01:09:40] Jason Calacanis: I would just prefer a harder problem today.
[01:09:43] Jason Calacanis: And even if my returns were the same or lower,
[01:09:45] Jason Calacanis: I mean, I'm sleeping fine.
[01:09:47] Jason Calacanis: But I'm just anxious about cloneable stuff
[01:09:53] Jason Calacanis: and I want hard problems are reassuring.
[01:09:56] Jason Calacanis: Only so many people, I mean, at the end of the day,
[01:09:58] Jason Calacanis: super bass is just, I think, a fork of postgres.
[01:10:01] Jason Calacanis: It's open source that they've redone.
[01:10:02] Jason Calacanis: It can be done again, neon did it, that replete lose
[01:10:06] Jason Calacanis: and data breaks bottom for a billion.
[01:10:08] Jason Calacanis: But data bases are a hard problem.
[01:10:10] Jason Calacanis: You can only lose so much data.
[01:10:11] Jason Calacanis: You can only have so many issues.
[01:10:13] Jason Calacanis: You have to figure this out.
[01:10:14] Jason Calacanis: And five years of investing in a database
[01:10:16] Jason Calacanis: everybody uses, it's, it ain't so easy to turn
[01:10:20] Jason Calacanis: and leave your database, right?
[01:10:21] Jason Calacanis: And so I just, this is what I'm thinking going into next year
[01:10:24] Jason Calacanis: if we want to close.
[01:10:25] Jason Calacanis: This was a year where we didn't, we tolerated a lot of
[01:10:28] Jason Calacanis: term, we only cared about, this was the year of growth,
[01:10:31] Jason Calacanis: but nothing.
[01:10:31] Jason Calacanis: And so's next year.
[01:10:33] Jason Calacanis: But I'd love a little defensibility.
[01:10:34] Jason Calacanis: I just love a little hard friggin problems.
[01:10:38] Jason Calacanis: And, you know, we're past the thin wrapper layer,
[01:10:42] Jason Calacanis: but I'm going, I'm going, where do you pick in
[01:10:44] Jason Calacanis: between levelable and super bass?
[01:10:45] Jason Calacanis: Oh, did I?
[01:10:46] Jason Calacanis: Oh.
[01:10:47] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:10:48] I love all the way back.
[01:10:50] Harry Stebbings: I love all all around.
[01:10:51] Harry Stebbings: We love to lead the student boat.
[01:10:53] Harry Stebbings: They're loyal to his paycheck.
[01:10:54] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[01:10:55] Harry Stebbings: The loveliest thing about this is we were,
[01:10:57] Harry Stebbings: we knew each other well before,
[01:11:00] Harry Stebbings: but the friendship that we have as a three now,
[01:11:02] Harry Stebbings: having done this show is just frickin' awesome.
[01:11:05] Harry Stebbings: Like honestly, it's one of the highlights of my week
[01:11:08] Harry Stebbings: doing this show every week.
[01:11:10] Harry Stebbings: And I've never said this both of you guys.
[01:11:12] Harry Stebbings: I so appreciate the friendship that we have.
[01:11:15] Harry Stebbings: And thank you for doing the show with me,
[01:11:16] Harry Stebbings: because it's always so much fun.
[01:11:18] Harry Stebbings: I learn so much.
[01:11:19] Harry Stebbings: I get so many messages from founders who learn so much.
[01:11:22] Harry Stebbings: So thank you for putting up with me both of you.
[01:11:24] Harry Stebbings: And that's not always easy.
[01:11:26] Harry Stebbings: Yup, but you're awesome.
[01:11:27] Harry Stebbings: And thanks for everyone that's stuck it out.
[01:11:28] Harry Stebbings: You're the end.
[01:11:29] Harry Stebbings: You're the end.
[01:11:30] Unknown Guest: Thank you guys.
