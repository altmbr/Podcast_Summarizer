# Podcast Summary: 20VC with Harry Stebbings, Jason Calacanis, and Rory O'Driscoll

## 1. Key Themes

### The SaaS TAM Trap: Why Public Companies Have Stopped Growing

The most profound theme discussed was what Jason coined "the TAM trap" - the reality that most public SaaS companies are caught in markets that have reached saturation. Jason observed: "The majority of the public SaaS companies I think are in a TAM trap...How did Aaron Levy's and the Drew Houston's and the others not figure out? And I love them, right? I love him. How do we not all figure out the TAM trap?" [[00:26:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=26m32s)

Rory offered a sobering explanation: "Maybe there's no answer. In other words, there's so many SaaS companies. It's not that everyone was idiots and couldn't find the market. I believe that we made so many companies that we saturated the markets. And by the time you got to the point where you needed to expand beyond your market, in many cases, there were other venture back SaaS companies into the adjacent market. So you just kind of ran out of room." [[00:27:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=27m10s)

The data supports this: the average public SaaS company is now growing at just 16%, the slowest growth rate ever recorded in the sector.

### Efficiency Over Profitability: The New Operating Model

A critical insight emerged about how companies should think about scaling in the AI era. Jason articulated the shift: "I think in the fastest growing companies that I've invested in, no one gives a rat's ass about the bottom line. That's a different metric than how you scale today...everybody is just generating more revenue per employee." [[00:39:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=38m50s)

The evidence is compelling: HubSpot is 2.8x more efficient than 2021, Salesforce is 2x more efficient, and Microsoft has announced they're "permanently past peak employee." Jason emphasized: "When I go to a board meeting and a CMO says, well, I couldn't do that, but I need 50 people. Or a product guy says, the reason we're late is I need another 80 people on the product and engineering team. I think it's time to part ways." [[00:34:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=33m54s)

### The Seat Pricing Existential Crisis

Workday's recent comments about seat reductions being an "existential threat" revealed a fundamental challenge for SaaS companies. Jeff Lawson from Twilio stated on a previous show that "we are unwavering and you're gonna see the movement away from seats." Jason explained the dynamics: "Everyone is shrinking headcount in tech, at least even if they're not shrinking headcount, ARR per employee is gonna keep going up...We're all gonna figure out how to get more AIR per employee. And if you're a leader, you're just gonna run out of seats, right?" [[00:33:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=32m58s)

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Seeds Might Actually Be for Suckers (At Scale)

Harry made a provocative argument that challenged conventional venture wisdom: "When you actually look at the certainty that you have that Databricks has the three to five X from here, you're absolutely right. When you think about opportunity, I can put my money here or here, risk adjusted and time adjusted. You could make a very coherent case that it is a better deal to put your money into a Databricks, or like your client apart can do with an Anthropic at 180 billion, that it is put your money into a much less certain series B with a seven to 10 year duration from there." [[00:09:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=8m51s)

This turns traditional venture capital theory on its head - that early stage offers the best risk-adjusted returns.

### OpenAI's "Code Red" Signals Model Providers Won't Dominate Apps

Contrary to fears that foundation model companies would consume the entire AI value chain, the discussion revealed a different trajectory. Rory observed: "The OpenAI story today is almost the exact opposite. It's the code red, focus on the core. It's almost like a statement that says, all the other things we've been doing, we ain't doing them now. We're just going to be fixing our core product." [[00:01:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=1m16s)

Rory concluded: "I don't think the model provider will be the competition in many apps...I think if I was on the board of OpenAI, you know, it's gonna be like, when the chat GPT was and you were worth $2 trillion, let's not foot around with, you know, little vertical markets that can be worth a couple a hundred million bucks." [[00:47:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=47m13s)

### The Slow Compounder Thesis in a Momentum-Driven World

Rory defended investing in slower-growing, longer-duration companies in an environment obsessed with rapid markups. Using Wealthfront as an example, he argued: "I think when you launch an investment in a company like a Wealthfront, the adoption cycle of something like that is going to be 10 or 15 years...At scale, asset management is a wonderful business." [[00:54:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=53m55s)

His philosophical stance: "When you have high certainty that a big company can be built here, you weight that more highly than everything else...all that matters is can you build a big company here? And literally he [Peter Thiel] said, because that rule is so hard, because it's so hard to find them, they have no other rules." [[01:00:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=1h0m1s)

- Jason: "It would be the second best public company if it were public today." [[00:06:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=6m31s)
- "The crazy thing is it continues to modestly accelerate...It's something we all have to adjust to that you can continue to accelerate at this scale." [[00:06:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=6m42s)

### **Range**

**Description:** AI-powered wealth management platform

**Why Mentioned:** As an example of AI disrupting a traditionally inefficient market

**Quotes:**
- Rory: "The idea is you can go much further down the wealth continuum and give the same kind of product that the super rich get in terms of managing your stuff, managing your taxes...You automate a lot of that, and then you can deliver a high quality product to a much broader marketplace." [[00:48:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=48m30s)
- Jason: "I set up three trusts, okay? And the wealth management didn't help at all, and then I went to the lawyers, okay? And it took me 11 months to set up three trusts." [[01:03:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=1h3m11s)

### **Wealthfront**

**Description:** Automated investment service

**Why Mentioned:** As an example of a slow-but-steady compounder that builds long-term value

**Quotes:**
- Rory: "Wealthfront was saying, even paying 50, 70 bips to some, to manage your money is crazy, because we can just put it in this automatic thing and do it automatically and for 10 bips...they're lovely businesses." [[00:55:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=55m13s)
- "Over time the only good thing about it is it does compound. And early on, wealth management in any form is a tough business because it takes a long time to build. But when it does build and wealth front is over that gap now, it's going to be there for the next 30 years." [[00:55:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=54m52s)

### **Mark Benioff (Salesforce CEO)**

**Description:** CEO of Salesforce

**Why Mentioned:** For Salesforce's massive investment in AI agents

## 5. Operating Insights

### Start Building Second Products Much Earlier Than You Think

Rory emphasized: "One of the big takeaways we've had is the need to be thinking about that second product much earlier than you would have thought. You don't want to wait till you hit...the TAM trap." [[00:31:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=30m50s)

He provided a successful example: "We were comparing two of our portfolio companies...one of them has compounded really well because it's continually added a new product. That for the first year or two is a couple of million dollars, but layered it in and now many hundreds of millions." [[00:31:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=31m2s)

### Target 50% Headcount Growth for 100% Revenue Growth

Jason articulated the new efficiency standard: "I want to see you grow 100% next year with 50% head count growth. I think that's healthy today." This contrasts sharply with pre-2023 norms where companies would add 200% headcount for 100% growth. [[00:34:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=34m18s)

### Security Will Become a Competitive Moat

Jason highlighted emerging risk: "I really think that with agents running everywhere with our data, the folks that can securely manage those data and the folks that have secure agents or seemingly secure agents, they may win...I might want my agents from Salesforce and Snowflake and Databricks." [[00:16:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=16m17s)

He cited concrete examples: Gainsight has been locked out of Salesforce for two weeks following a security breach, and Drift was permanently removed after 700 customer instances were compromised and held for ransom. "One time we can blame Drift...But two times I might start locking down my platform. The third time I might say, I'm just gonna own all the engines." [[00:18:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=18m12s)

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The Innovation Budget Window Is Closing Faster Than Expected

An easily missed but critical point: Google launched a competitor to Replet/Lovable in less than 10 months from when those products gained traction. Jason observed: "You don't get five years anymore. I mean, DataDog just launched their PagerDuty competitor like in the last 24 months. When was PagerDuty founded? 2008. You don't get that much now, you don't even get a year." [[00:45:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=45m5s)

This has profound implications for AI startups banking on having time to build moats before incumbents respond. The "innovation budget" period where buyers will tolerate experimental vendors is compressing dramatically.

### The Employment Paradox: All Three Market Segments Don't Need People

Rory identified a troubling pattern that went largely unexamined: "The interesting thing when I lift out those three categories [mature public companies, foundation model companies, and AI app startups], the one thing they all have in common is, they all don't need people. The big companies can't have people because they gotta be efficient. The model companies don't need people because they just need geniuses and GPU, and the small AI app startups are growing and they're sitting down quickly that can hire people." [[00:43:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P-Zf8mDsk&t=42m53s)

This suggests a structural challenge in the tech employment market that may persist longer than many expect, with implications for talent availability, wage dynamics, and potentially social stability in tech hubs.
