[00:00:00] Google did a cord red three years ago on them,
[00:00:03] and now they're doing a cord red back.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_02: How much extra in multiple do you pay
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_02: for how much extra in growth?
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_02: The majority of the public ask on it
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_00: is I think are in a ham trap.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: Overpayment only works when the time is huge.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_02: In finite times, you got a bit more tightly.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_02: The SaaS has become like Japan.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: It's a great economy, but if everyone only has point nine kids,
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: I mean, there's only only so many seats to go around.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_00: I think in the fastest drawing companies that I've invested in,
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_00: no one gives a rat ass about the bottom line.
[00:00:34] Ready to go?
[00:00:46] OK, so this is going to be a live pod,
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_01: which makes me inherently nervous and excited at the same time.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_01: For those that don't know, this is the show every week
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: where we discuss the biggest news in SaaS,
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: in tech with no politics.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_01: And so we're going to start with thrive partnering with OpenAI.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_01: How do we think about this partnership over to you guys?
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_01: The quick answer would be, we'll definitely talk about it,
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_02: but it doesn't matter.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_02: I think the interesting thing, Harry, is that that's not the OpenAI story anymore.
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_02: That's the OpenAI story from a day ago.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_02: And the OpenAI story today is almost the exact opposite.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_02: It's the code red, focus on the core.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_02: It's almost like a statement that says,
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_02: all the other things we've been doing, we ain't doing them now.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_02: We're just going to be fixing our core product.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_02: We're even pushing on ads,
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_02: but they're even pushing on agents for healthcare,
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_02: pushing that stuff back and really going all in on no distractions.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_02: So while I think this is an interesting announcement,
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_02: and we'll definitely talk about it in a second,
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_02: the Zoom Out comment is 24 hours later,
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_02: that's not the zeitgeist at OpenAI anymore.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_02: The zeitgeist is, you know,
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_02: Google did a code red three years ago on them,
[00:02:00] and now they're doing a code red back.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_02: The one thing that is kind of interesting to it is it's a reminder,
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_00: and this can be a little soul crushing as a founder,
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_00: there's like only a couple of deals that matter to VCs.
[00:02:10] So when you see a VC stand aboard for 20 years,
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: and you'll see them always hanging out with this one CO,
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_00: and Thrive has a lot of winners, right?
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: But this is a big winner, right?
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: And so anything you can do to go deeper with those founders
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: on your one or two winners, it's just,
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_00: it's parallel on steroids,
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: it's parallel with what you do with your week,
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_00: it's parallel with your deal flow,
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: it's parallel with, I mean, it's just,
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_00: so I don't totally get who's giving each other how much equity,
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: but I think it's a part about going as deep
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: with your winners humanly possible.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_00: This is OpenAI investing in Thrive Holdings.
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, but it's the same people, right?
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_00: It's still going deep on your winners.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_00: Since I'm turning my VC fund into a holding company,
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_00: I'm putting a billionaire two over there, right?
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: And then I'm going even deeper with the number one company
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: that I've ever invested in.
[00:03:00] First of all, I think it's a great deal for Thrive
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_02: because Jason's right, the whole trick in venture is,
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_02: we try and pretend we matter,
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_02: but in our hearts, we know our best companies matter,
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_02: and the best marketing you can do
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_02: is get as close as possible to your biggest deals.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_02: And Thrive, to give them a huge credit,
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_02: put a bunch of money in to OpenAI in that,
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_02: I think it was a 70 billion round.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_02: And we're there for Sam in the great fiasco of two years ago.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_02: So my guess is he's pretty down loyal.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_02: And this is a chance for them to get a halo effect
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_02: as they on this initiative,
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_02: and we'll talk about the specifics of the initiative
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_02: in a second, but it's a huge halo effect.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_02: Because as you last speak, we've said,
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_02: you go in with the OpenAI moniker,
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_02: and you get some real attention.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_02: So it's awesome for Thrive.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_02: I agree, the advantage to OpenAI is much less clear.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure they're putting in money.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_02: In one of the press releases,
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_02: they said they're going to get a lot of specific data
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_02: from some of these verticals that Thrive is pushing into.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: But my guess is I know who was ecstatic this morning
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_02: when that was announced, and who was like, yeah, whatever.
[00:04:06] That's pretty clear.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_02: Okay, we said about the importance of all winners,
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_01: and Brodie, you humbly said there,
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_01: it's all about our kind of star founders.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: Data breaks is one of the stars
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_01: in the last generation or this generation.
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_01: That rumoured to be raising $5 billion
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: at $134 billion evaluation.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_01: It's 32X 2025 sales, which are 4.1 billion.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_01: They're at 55% year-on-year growth.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_01: Is this actually cheap?
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_01: How did we analyze this one?
[00:04:36] Well, one called cheap, but reasonably,
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: I mean, look, possibly reasonably priced.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_02: I mean, you start, because it actually,
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_02: it's very convenient right now,
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_02: because the direct competitor, Snowflake, is public,
[00:04:48] and exactly roughly the same revenue, around $4 billion,
[00:04:52] growing at 28%, value at 80 billion,
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_02: for 20 times the revenues.
[00:04:58] And so it pulls it very nicely,
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_02: the big picture of venture question,
[00:05:02] how much extra in multiple do you pay
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_02: for how much extra in growth?
[00:05:07] And right here is the work example.
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_02: It's like you can buy a profitable company
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_02: doing $4 billion with 28% growth at 20 times.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_02: Or you can buy a unprofitable,
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_02: but fast or accelerating company at 32, 33 times.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: And is that extra 25% of growth?
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_02: Because I think Databricks is growing a legend,
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_02: they're at 55%, not 25%.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_02: So you're getting 25% to 30% of extra growth.
[00:05:36] And the question is, is that work?
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_02: First of all, you agree that's fundamental to the question
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_02: you're asking, how much extra revenue multiple do you pay
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_02: for how much extra growth?
[00:05:46] Would you agree, Harry?
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_02: I agree with that.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_02: And I think what very quickly,
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_02: because you do the math,
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_02: and there's a bunch of things to do it.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_02: What you said yourself is,
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_02: if that extra growth lasts for any length of time,
[00:06:01] extra growths work a shit ton to use a technical term,
[00:06:05] because you just, that compounding keeps going.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_02: So if that growth persists for like three or four years,
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_02: then maybe that extra premium is worth every dollar
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_02: and then some, then you start saying,
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_02: how much extra for how much extra growth?
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_02: And you kind of look at the public markets to figure it out.
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_02: And then you discover something really funny.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_02: And Jason talked about this,
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_02: there is literally only one public company
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_02: going more than 30% and that's Palantir.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_02: And for the record, that's going at 50%
[00:06:33] wildly profitable and value that 80 times sales.
[00:06:37] So you just don't have a data set,
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_02: publicly to assess this.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_02: I think the simple answer is,
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: it would be the second best public company
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: if it were public today.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: And so it seems about right.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's a good, it's a fun question.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: The crazy thing is it continues to modestly accelerate.
[00:06:56] Yeah, it's just something that we just haven't seen before.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: It's something we all have to adjust to
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: that you can continue to accelerate at this scale.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: It justifies all the craziness we see eventually,
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_00: at least for now, because the headroom is still there.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_00: I totally agree, Jason.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_02: And I'd forgotten that the reacceleration
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_02: changes everything because I was going to say,
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_02: when you develop that model of how much extra
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_02: is 55 worth versus 25,
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_02: you kind of make some of something of gradual deacceleration
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_02: and gradual conversions,
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_02: because that's the only rational thing to do.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_02: And then you can come up with a number.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_02: It's a high revenue multiple, still a number.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_02: You write, Jason, when when stop starts reaccelerating
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_02: at scale, then it's almost hard to figure out the model.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_02: I mean, by definition, if it continues to reaccelerate
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_02: just for the record, it's infinitely valuable,
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_02: because that's just what the map says, right?
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_02: So it's probably not going to be infinitely valuable,
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_02: but it just points out the power of reacceleration at scale.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_02: If you can even stipulate, you know,
[00:07:53] going from 50 to 55 to 60 at scale, oh my God, there's each value.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_02: And it's actually, it's the same dynamic.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_02: It's why it's hard to value the big foundation models.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_02: It's the, you know, when a profit went
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_02: through that pile of reacceleration this year at scale,
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_02: everyone relies the model as well.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_02: And they just have to raise the estimates and raise the value.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_02: And that's why you saw that step function increase in valuation.
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_02: Because you said reacceleration is really hard.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_02: We see it maybe one in three companies does it for a single year,
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_02: only one in 10 does it for two years,
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_02: very rarely seen reacceleration
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_02: when you're already at 50% for God's sake.
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_02: No, you're exactly right, Jason.
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_02: That's the killer factor that makes it hard.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_02: So you end up saying yourself some versions, what you said earlier,
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_02: some version of how big is the time?
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_02: Because in the end, the only thing that stops something
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_02: that's reacceleration at scale is when you hit the wall
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_02: of well, you saw to everyone.
[00:08:46] It's a zoom thing.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, just also reminds you that seeds for suckers.
[00:08:50] When you actually look at the certainty that you have
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_01: that data breaks has the three to five X from here,
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_01: you're absolutely right.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_01: When you think about opportunity,
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_01: I can put my money here or here, risk adjusted and time adjusted.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_01: You could make a very coherent case
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_01: that it is a better deal to put your money into a data brace,
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_01: or like your client apart can do with an anthropic at 180 billion,
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_01: that it is put your money into a much less certain series B
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_01: with a seven to 10 year duration from there.
[00:09:16] Yeah, or just a seed pre-seed deal at 60 posts on a safe.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_00: It's just how it's how the data breaks into like a better table.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_00: But 60 posts?
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: It's quite cheap for a cheap amount.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_01: Honestly, it's getting worse.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_01: Snowflakes up year to date 60%.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_01: And we're seeing the reacceleration of data breaks.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_01: Did they just both grow into absolute monsters?
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_01: Can they peacefully coexist?
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_01: Do you think one takes majority market share?
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_01: I had wrong grubrisco, their CRO on our 20 sales podcast.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_01: And he was like data braces technology is five years ahead,
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_01: which I thought was a really interesting statement.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_01: Do you think they peacefully coexist?
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_01: Does one take monopoly?
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_01: How does that look?
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_01: I mean, Ron was correct.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_02: They came from slightly different places at slightly different times.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_02: Snowflake originally was very much your SQL data warehouse in the cloud.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_02: It was a few years earlier than data breaks,
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_02: which was originally I think the Kafka product and all about moving data.
[00:10:16] And more AI use cases even out of the gate.
[00:10:20] So he is correct in that.
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_02: I mean, no one's going to coexist peacefully.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_02: They probably hate each other.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_02: And we know they hate each other because they
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_02: time their sales event to overlap with each other.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I would say different now.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_02: They're not going to court and court peacefully coexist.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_02: They're going to struggle and fight against each other
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_02: for the next 10 years, just like SAP and Oracle
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_02: fought against each other for the last 20.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_02: They're going to want each other's lunch.
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_02: And it's going to be a grind.
[00:10:47] I mean, I don't think any of them folds from here.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_02: It's hard to imagine.
[00:10:52] The core value of relational database isn't going away for transactions.
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_02: So kind of the Snowflake asset is money good.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_02: And then separately, I think one is correct.
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_02: Databricks has more of a advantage in brand new AI-centric data manipulation,
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_02: data movement applications.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_02: So both are in good adjacent overlapping markets.
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_02: They want a bit of each other's market that's just going to slug it out.
[00:11:17] It probably means at some point,
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_02: that someone else margins getting a little bit.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_02: But you've seen it before.
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_02: You've seen it as if they were Oracle, Cybase, and InformX.
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_02: You've seen it with Workday, SAP, and Oracle.
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_02: This is just what, I mean, Jason knows,
[00:11:30] most enterprise software markets tend to be all agape-lies.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_02: And they tend to punch each other for 10 years.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_02: And our little corner of the world that is scale ups and startups,
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_00: these are these Snowflakes.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_00: The one thing I do know is we're just starting to learn
[00:11:45] what we can do with our data with agents.
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_00: We're just starting to learn.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_00: And even Snowflake is still learning, right?
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_00: It's new to Snowflake.
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: I mean, when we had the CEO of Snowflake at Sastra and Ulynn May,
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_00: just starting to talk about how they were going to use agents, right?
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_00: And now, fast forward to today, it's a couple months later.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: All the Vy platform now can directly access Snowflake data.
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: Like, literally, we could fire up our cursor-lovable replet
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_00: and just build an app right now while we're here
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_00: and access our Salesforce data.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_00: What will that mean to access that data?
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_00: What will that mean for how we think about CRM,
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_00: how we think about where we host and how we exit?
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_00: Like, I'm just not smart.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_00: I've to even predict what that means in a year,
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_00: because that wasn't even possible a couple weeks ago.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_00: Can you access every bit of data in Snowflake or Databricks
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_00: in a Fortune 500 company?
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_00: I assume the answer is no.
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: I assume a lot of that data is low.
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_00: But that is an epic change that I can't even predict
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_00: the scope of the curve next year, right?
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_00: And so what happens, I know we overuse this word,
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_00: it's not authentic, but what happens when I can use
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: easy to use agents where I don't need a lot of engineers
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: to access all of my data any way I want to build any report,
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: any analytics, any workflow from that.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_00: I think we're 1% on this journey.
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: If I'm out, then we'll empower our data with agents
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: we were just learning.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: If I were to push you, honestly,
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_01: and ask the question of will we see our CRM's
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_01: your Salesforce is your hub's boss,
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_01: will they become databases which agents sit on top of
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_01: and feed off, or will these platforms move with the
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_01: agentic world, build their own and not become sheer
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: databases alone?
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_01: If I push you, one is the likely outcome.
[00:13:26] I think the fact that Mark Benioff has put 2000 people
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: on agent force tells you the future right there.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_00: He's already got 2000 people on it.
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: But it tells you his intentions, it doesn't tell you his ability.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: We are still early on enterprises, and I think
[00:13:42] if Salesforce in particular, they've got two years
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_00: to unlock all this capability I think with the rate of change.
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_00: It's just at Mark has to do it as a case here,
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_00: there's not a lot of time at Salesforce.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: Like traditionally, that's like a major release, right?
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: Snowflake turned out to have time.
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_00: Like we might have thought Snowflake was struggling
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_00: at the start of the year, right?
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_00: We don't think Snowflake's right.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_00: So there is more time in the older enterprises,
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_00: and where that breaks for those that have massive amounts
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_00: of data, I am not smart enough to predict.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_00: I would not bet against anyone that is managing
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_00: a huge amount of structured and unstructured data.
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't bet against anyone.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: What will probably happen is if you want to build agents
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_02: that are just using your CRM data and your Salesforce shop,
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_02: just like a Microsoft was able to bundle Microsoft products,
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_02: you'll probably take the agent from Salesforce
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_02: and get a combined thing.
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_02: But I think, and to Jason's point,
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_02: I think enterprise will want to build more powerful agents
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_02: were not just drawing the data from one app by Salesforce,
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_02: but drawing the data from maybe five or six different sources.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_02: The more likely architecture for that is some version
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_02: of stuff at all in Snowflake,
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_02: and then run an agent directly against that.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_02: And I think as you were talking Jason earlier
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_02: about what you think with Snowflake,
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_02: I remember one of the things we did five or six years ago
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_02: that was turned out in retrospective,
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_02: very smart is just literally up to stuff all the data
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_02: in Snowflake across all the systems.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_02: So over time, you have access to that.
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_02: So if I'm a large enterprise and I want to use my internal,
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_02: let's say I'm a bank,
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_02: I want to use my deposit system plus my Salesforce system
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_02: plus something else.
[00:15:27] At a certain size, it won't work easily
[00:15:30] in just a Salesforce so you'll want to go
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_02: just like every large enterprise
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_02: the dawn of time,
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_02: some apps you'll want to build yourself.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_02: And if agents becomes strategically important enough
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_02: for super big companies,
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_02: then they'll show $5 million and a bunch of Snowflake added
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_02: and our data breaks and just build it themselves.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_02: So there's no doubt that AG Force
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_02: can get a fair slug of the market,
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_02: but I'm also sure that at the high end,
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_02: there'll be a bunch of wonderfully bespoke projects
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_02: that will make systems integrators
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_02: read for the next decade.
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_02: Everything we're doing right now in AI is very exciting,
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_00: but I've been thinking a lot about how Gainsight's
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_00: been locked at a Salesforce two weeks.
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_00: I've been thinking a lot about how OpenAI
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: just kicked Mixpanel this week permanently off OpenAI
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_00: for security breach.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_00: And I really think that with agents running everywhere
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_00: with our data, the folks that can securely manage those data
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_00: and the folks that have secure agents
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: or seemingly secure agents, they may win.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_00: We're willing to bend some rules in the age of AI.
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_00: We're willing to bend some rules to move quickly.
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_00: I think security is gonna benefit the incumbents.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: I think we're gonna be worried that our agents are depositing
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_00: our data in a hundred different places
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_00: and are gonna be worried and it's crazy.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I love Nick and the Gainsight team,
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_00: but essentially their app has been down for two weeks
[00:16:53] SPEAKER_00: with no known resolution time.
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_00: But Salesforce has kicked them off the platform.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_00: They kicked Drift off five months ago.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: Drift will never come back.
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_00: It is dead.
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_00: It is completely dead.
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_00: And so I think about those
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_00: and I think about where all these agents are taking our data.
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_00: I might want my agents from Salesforce
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_00: and Snowball and Data Bricks.
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_00: And when things change, we get very excited about new vendors,
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_00: because the incumbents can't do it.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_00: We get very excited.
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_00: And inherently we take a little bit of risk.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_00: We try and contain that risk in a pilot
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_00: or in a less critical source of data.
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_00: We always try to measure the risk at the beginning.
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_00: But I wonder, this is our sensitive data flowing.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_00: And it may not matter for your average startup,
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: but I generally am worried we're underestimating security
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_00: and data residency in general.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_00: I just worry.
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_00: And I feel bad, but I just couldn't imagine
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_00: going through this Gainsight.
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_00: Do you think the world is more,
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_02: and become is a more unforgiving now?
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_02: Because, yeah, over the last 10 or 15 years,
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_02: a lot of companies have had beaches.
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_02: Do you think this was more serious?
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_02: It is more serious.
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: They are literally, so drift at the security breach.
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_00: 700 folks data were downloaded.
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_00: And now a pirate group is asking for millions of dollars
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_00: for each instance.
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_00: And then this happens again, right, with Gainsight.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: I can't speak for Salesforce with a team.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_00: I mean, 45 billion, but I would be more conservative
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_00: with who I let touch my data.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_00: We could say it's an OAuth issue, whatever.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_00: But I don't want this ever happening again.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: One time we can blame Drift
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_00: because it got acquired by another P firm
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_00: that got acquired by another P eu firm.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: But two times I might start locking down my platform.
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_00: The third time I might say, I'm just gonna own all the engines.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_00: I'm done with these risks, right?
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, but it's getting worse.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_00: When people want to steal your data and sell,
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_00: and ransom you from million dollars
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_00: across 700 orgs, including Cloudflare.
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_00: And how many start, how big is the SECOPS team
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: and most startups you work with?
[00:18:58] 50?
[00:18:59] Oh, thank you very much, 100.
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_00: How big is the latest deal you did?
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: How big is the security team?
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_02: And the funny thing is Jason,
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_02: both the examples you cited are mature, first and second
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_02: generation SaaS companies, not brand new AI first companies.
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_02: So what you're saying is new companies
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_02: might get tagged with the consequence
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_02: of a more restrictive security policy,
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_02: even though you could argue it was older companies
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_02: that I think in both cases were PE managed
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_02: that actually caused the problem,
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_02: which is life is unfair, but there you go.
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_00: Probably just before we started doing this,
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_00: it kind of felt like the enterprise was gonna win.
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_00: That service now and everybody was gonna win,
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: and then it doesn't feel like that at all.
[00:19:43] Then we saw the numbers take off
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_00: and basically very few incumbents
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_00: grew this year materially, right?
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_00: They varied so, but this could be a piece
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_00: of their revenge at the enterprise.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: You cynically suggest thing that large enterprise software
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_02: company could say, I'm using security as an excuse
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_02: to cut you all off, but lo and behold,
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_02: I have my own agent product right here
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_02: which you can now safely buy, Mr. Cousler.
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_02: I think it's a good excuse.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: I think if you don't want clean,
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_00: sort of bring all your data, right?
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_00: Which, you know, if I'm clean, I get it.
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_00: If I don't want all of it going out of slack
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_00: or whatever, I mean, many incumbents,
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_00: I think it's the best excuse there is,
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_00: because the existential risk is just too much
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_00: to the vendor, it's not worth it.
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_00: I don't know how many board meetings
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_00: you guys have been in where the first half
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_00: of this presentation was how we're gonna get
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_00: be more secure in the age of AI,
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_00: but for me, it's been close to zero.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_00: So we've been close to zero in the above
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_00: the full part of the conversation.
[00:20:40] So we spoke about data braces growth.
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_01: I do just want to take the flip side of that,
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_01: which is a less positive or optimistic side.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_01: Pager duty, 2X, a billion valuation at 500 million
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_01: error, 4% growth.
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_01: We just saw Lissie, it's not on the schedule.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_01: So this is where Rory gets nuts at me,
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_01: because I just add shit without asking him
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_01: and then expect him on a whim to come up with something
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_01: and normally we can edit out pauses,
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_01: but now he's gonna be extra pissed with me.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_01: Welcome to my life.
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_01: Event bright, they've been acquired for like 500 million.
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's a premium, right?
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so that's 1.5 times revenue.
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_00: 1.5 times revenue.
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_00: With a 50% premium.
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_00: With a 50% premium.
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_01: So new news in stay.
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_01: And we can take the page duty,
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_01: because it's so fresh having that event bright news.
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_01: It is hard to bluntly ask for such immediate thoughts.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_01: But how do we think about this?
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_01: Bloney, very harsh new reality,
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_01: given the lack of growth and the subsequent pricing from it.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_01: I'll surprise you, Harry, I'll cover both,
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_02: despite the complete lack of notice.
[00:21:46] I think there's two separate things,
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_02: and one perhaps is a positive, right?
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_02: One is kind of a fact about being public.
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_02: When you're public and your stock is floating around
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_02: nowhere at a low evaluation,
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_02: you're just very vulnerable to this.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_02: Someone comes into view,
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_02: they are, you know, you're not growing quickly,
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_02: they offer you a 50% premium.
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_02: And you get called in, but the board gets called in,
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_02: the lawyer gives you the speech about for juice three duties.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: And if you can come up with a convincing reason
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_02: why you can build better value than that premium,
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_02: you should, you're very forced to take it.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_02: Not 100%, but it's a tough place to be, right?
[00:22:20] So I can imagine the conversation at Eventbride.
[00:22:24] I can imagine the conversation two weeks ago at Semvush,
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_02: and I'm sure a page with duty
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_02: are thinking about the same thing, right?
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_02: But now there's two things to say though,
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_02: at the wider level.
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_02: The first is let's start with the positive.
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_02: Someone else, very smart money,
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_02: thinks these things are worth buying.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_02: And I think they're looking at it and saying,
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_02: you, Mr. Seller, haven't created value here,
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_02: haven't found growth, and I think we can.
[00:22:48] And if you look at the three companies we're talking about,
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_02: because let's lump in Semvush,
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_02: because they were acquired two weeks ago by Adobe.
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_02: And Jason and I disagreed,
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_02: but we definitely felt someone like Adobe
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_02: could do something with that asset.
[00:23:00] I'm not sure what the direction of Eventbride could take,
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_02: but I think, and you said in your notes,
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_02: how a page with duty has an obvious set of next products,
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_02: including AI, agentic products,
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_02: around downtime resolution,
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_02: that feel obvious to me.
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_02: And frankly, I wouldn't be surprised
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_02: at an aggressive PE firm said, oh my God,
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_02: I can buy this thing, I can then buy some small little
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_02: hot AI startup, put them together,
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_02: and get this thing back to 20% growth,
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_02: value the 10 times and look like a hero.
[00:23:33] So the positive would be other people's smart savvy money,
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_02: look at these assets and say,
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_02: two times revenue is stupidly cheap, I'll have that.
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_02: I hope so, I hope there's more deals.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_00: We see general catalysts and others doing this,
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_00: let's add AI to services businesses,
[00:23:47] SPEAKER_00: we see a lot of talk of this,
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_00: but right now we're not seeing a lot of these mashed together
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: legacy company hundreds of millions
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: and B2B and hot AI startups
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_00: and magically flipping it into a 20X, 15X AI
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: or a company, I'm not saying it's not coming,
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_00: but we haven't seen pageerduty.com
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_00: and pageerduty.ai,
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_00: magically mashed together into a winner yet, have we?
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_00: Knowing happened and you write JSON,
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_02: but the funny thing is, I mean,
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_02: I like pageerduty, we looked at the deal 10 years ago,
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_02: my then new partner wrote a term sheet,
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_02: we should have let him pay a little more
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_02: because he was right, we love that market.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_02: And I remember the investment memo from 10 years ago
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_02: and it said clearly, summary,
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_02: this is a great market, it's gonna tap out
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_02: and you have to add a whole series of ad on products
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_02: around managing the process of downtime
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_02: or security breaches,
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_02: managing the process of getting something back up
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_02: and we didn't have it at the time,
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_02: but now obviously adding AI enabled operational resolution,
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_02: and the direction was clear and is clear.
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_02: So, you write JSON, they haven't done it,
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_02: but I think that that's just a disappointing outcome,
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_02: let's just say, right?
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_02: I think that the direction of travel should have been clear
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_02: and if you've kind of been able to add it,
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_02: I think we talk a lot about how distribution
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_02: is a huge advantage in software.
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_02: I mean, literally every ops team on the planet
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_02: uses pageerduty and for God's sake,
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_02: it's pretty obvious what to add here people, get it done.
[00:25:20] Roy, as your views and Json Tear,
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_01: if your views on market size changes an investor,
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_01: given what you just said,
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_01: every ops team on the planet uses pageerduty
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_01: and it's a billion valuation,
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_01: 10% holding, be 100 million buy.
[00:25:36] It's just a very sobering reality
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: because your view on market size changed
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: when investing today,
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_01: given where else you can put your money
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_01: and the sizes of those markets
[00:25:48] that we're seeing with your lovable and your replas.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_01: I see more and more folks who I thought would grow out
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_00: of a small town, not grow out enough.
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_00: When I started as a B2B founder quite a while ago,
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_00: everyone seemed to grow out of small towns for the most part.
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_00: Some better than others,
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_00: but it felt like we had time
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_00: and it felt like you had four or five years
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_00: to figure it out at each stage
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_00: and you could see it coming.
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_00: Now it feels like,
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_00: now that the average public SaaS company
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_00: is growing like 16%,
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_00: it feels like no one figured this out.
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_00: Like we've never grown more slowly, right?
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_00: We literally just in my presentation before,
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_00: we looked at this chart,
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_00: no one's ever grown this slowly.
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_00: So if the public guys can't figure this out,
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I know the next generation of the kids
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_00: should do better than the adults,
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_00: but I'm worried that the majority of the public SaaS companies
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_00: didn't figure this out.
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_00: The majority of the public SaaS companies
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_00: I think are in a Tam trap, a Tam trap.
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_01: It's a good title for the public.
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: The Tam trap, a Tam trap.
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_01: The Tam trap.
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_00: I thought it was a big deal.
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_00: I mean, love.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_00: How did Aaron Levy's in the Drew House Stins
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_00: and the others not figure out?
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_00: And I love them, right?
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_00: I love him.
[00:26:56] SPEAKER_00: How do we not all figure out the Tam trap?
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_00: What hope is there for the rest of us?
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_00: I can give you a fair answer on that.
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_02: First of all, I think it's a great kind of division
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_02: of the discussion into the Tam trap for the existing.
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_02: And then what does it mean for the new AI companies?
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_02: And then maybe third, what does it mean for venture?
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_02: But let's start on the first one, the SaaS Tam trap.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_02: You keep saying, Jason, how did they not figure it out?
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_02: Let me just offer a different perspective.
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_02: Maybe there's no answer.
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_02: In other words, there's so many SaaS companies.
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_02: It's not that everyone was idiots
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_02: and couldn't find the market.
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_02: I don't believe that at all.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_02: I believe that we made so many companies
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_02: that we saturated the markets.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_02: And by the time you got to the point
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_02: where you needed to expand beyond your market,
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_02: in many cases, there were other venture back SaaS companies
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_02: into the adjacent market.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_02: So you just kind of ran out of room, right?
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_02: And in fact, I did a blog post of this in 2019
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_02: called Hunger Games in SaaS.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_02: And so that's my opinion on that.
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_02: So like many of these markets,
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_02: it's not that some of the CEOs you cited it is,
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_02: it's that you have high penetration of the markets.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_02: There's not a whole, I mean, you know,
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_02: take the quintessential one you and I talk about all the time.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_02: You know, the whole thing is that you just zoom.
[00:28:00] Everyone who needed a zoom account has one.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_02: And everyone who has an zoom account has a team account,
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_02: the poor bastards.
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_02: And they're done.
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_02: But there's nothing more to say.
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_02: You gotta build a new thing.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_02: So it, and the initial quarter court
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_02: obviously it's new thing for zoom pre-AI
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_02: was that whole contact center business.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_02: And they couldn't get that acquisition done
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_02: and there was already incumbents in the space.
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_02: So I think pre-AI you ran out of time, right?
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_02: So Harry, to your question, as we've said many times,
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_02: overpayment only works when the time is huge.
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_02: In finite times, you got a bit more tightly, right?
[00:28:35] And I think it's so funny, I'm gonna anecdot
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_02: about page of duty.
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_02: When they went public and we did our internal autopsy
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_02: because you do, right?
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_02: I looked at the model we'd owned over it
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_02: five, six years ago and we were accurate
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_02: within 3% on the model prediction of revenues.
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_02: And all that happened was the market was just willing
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_02: to pay more for the asset and now it's not, right?
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_02: So I think on the existing space,
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_02: it's the time constraint.
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_02: And I think you just have to be careful and pride.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_02: Now, the question on the new market,
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_02: which I think is believable and credible is,
[00:29:07] is there AI, we've discussed it a million times.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_02: Does the AI labor expansion save us all
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_02: and allow us to reach higher on price
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_02: and still get these huge towns?
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_02: Are we gonna be in the same place eight years from now?
[00:29:20] That's the actually monthly trillion dollar question
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_02: as a term.
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_00: Two, one is, can AI allow us to tap more into labor budget, right?
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_00: I think the second one, and I was trying
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_00: to summarize this earlier today, is can AI provide
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_00: so much value that you can charge an order of magnitude
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_00: more than you could charge before?
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_00: Gamma charging $100 a month instead of,
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_00: you know, I only pay eight bucks for Canva, right?
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_00: Or cursor charging $500 a month when I pay $3 for Gira.
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_00: And so you wonder, can we do that?
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_00: We don't talk about Zoom, I try to think about Zoom.
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_00: I can't think of like a better technical founder
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_00: running a leader than Zoom.
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_00: I can't figure out some of my respect more
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_00: on every level as a human, as an engineer,
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_00: as a leader than Eric.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_00: Why in four years, there's a mean question
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_00: and I don't deserve to even ask it
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_00: because you said, why didn't they capture more tam?
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_00: Why didn't they find a way to add four billion of notetakers
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_00: when there's the trillion notetakers?
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_00: Why didn't they, and I don't know the answer?
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: It's not because you're not one of the smartest people
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_00: in the industry thinking about this for a decade,
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_00: but there was no great second act yet.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_00: There's no great second act.
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_00: And I do work back there, I worry.
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_00: I worry, and this is why I tell founders
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_00: to take their exits and then say no,
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_00: because they can go bigger, but by default take it.
[00:30:46] So many things of that to unpack.
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_02: I mean, one is the multi product thing.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_02: I think one of the big takeaways we've had
[00:30:55] is the need to be thinking about that second product
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_02: much earlier than you would have thought.
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_02: You don't want to wait till you hit.
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_02: And what's the term, what was word expression, Jason?
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_02: I love that.
[00:31:06] It was good, but I'm just getting what do we call it?
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_02: What's a time trap?
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_02: The time trap.
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_02: Time trap, yeah.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_02: No way to be hit the time trap.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_02: I mean, we were thinking, actually,
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_02: we were comparing two of our portfolio come up.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_02: The bus and its inventors to name them.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_02: But we would say one of them has compounded really well
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_02: because it's continually added a new product.
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_02: That for the first year or two is a couple of million dollars,
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_02: but layered it in and now many hundreds of millions.
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_02: So I think watching that time trap is key.
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_02: But the other thing you said, and it was in the speaker notes,
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_02: two is on the AI pricing, if you're pricing
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_02: versus labor of value created,
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_02: you're getting enormously great prices
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_02: because you're saving a lot of labor.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_02: And I think you said in the speaker notes,
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_02: what happens when there's two or three of these companies
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_02: and the competition goes from, hey, I'm saving you
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_02: a thousand dollars of labor a month to, yeah,
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_02: I'm saving a thousand dollars of labor,
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_02: but there's three providers of the same software, AI software,
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_02: and they're all willing to do it for a hundred bucks.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_02: So you're ability to get 500 gets eroded.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_02: And do you start seeing that happen in AI very quickly?
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_02: Is it super clever?
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it hasn't yet, I think.
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_02: And speaking of the pricing challenges that we have here,
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_01: we have workday coming out saying, seat reductions
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_01: on existential threat.
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: We had Jeff Lawson from Twilly on the show,
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_01: with the three of us.
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_01: And he said that we are unwavering
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_01: and you're gonna see the movement away from seats.
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: And that is going to happen.
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_01: Can companies still price by seat in the age of AI
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_01: all work day inherently is threatened
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_01: and right to be concerned by this existential threat?
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_01: You know, when Jeff, if folks haven't watched
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_00: it's worth rewatching, he was so good, right?
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_00: And he made that comment that Twilly,
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_00: especially if you were still CEO,
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_00: would have, we be insulated to that
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_00: because it's based on usage, right?
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_00: And in fact, Twilly, I was seeing a little bit of a resurgence.
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_00: Like it has seen some reacceleration.
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_00: And he said he was very worried about seats.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_00: But he said, I hadn't been in the game in a little while
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_00: and I've been doing AI and working in my shop.
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_00: So I didn't fully, but it has resonated in my mind since,
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_00: which is he is right.
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_00: And everyone is shrinking headcount in tech,
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_00: at least even if they're not shrinking headcount,
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_00: ARR per employee is gonna keep going up.
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_00: I crunched all the data before this morning.
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_00: Everyone is going up, HubSpot 2.8 times more efficient
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_00: than 2021, Salesforce two times.
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_00: Microsoft has said they're already past peak employee,
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_00: permanently past pre-employee.
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_00: We're all gonna figure out how to get more AIR per employee.
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_00: And if you're a leader, you're just gonna run out of seats,
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_00: right?
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_00: Mark was kind of aware of this when he did the pod too.
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_00: So I don't have the answers.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_00: I mean, in the early days, it probably doesn't matter, right?
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: I mean, your model is your model and seats work well
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_00: in some places, but it is existential.
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_00: We are just gonna get more and more efficient.
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_00: One of my biggest worries for investments
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_00: is when startups aren't getting more efficient.
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_00: I'm not talking about profitability, that's an investment.
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_00: I'm talking about where their teams get more bloated
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_00: as they scale.
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_00: I kind of am out.
[00:34:04] When I go to a board meeting and a CMO says,
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_00: well, I couldn't do that, but I need 50 people.
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: Or a product guy says, the reason we're late
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_00: is I need another 80 people on the product and engineering team.
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_00: I think it's time to part ways.
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_00: Give them a nice package and a good recommendation.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_00: And I'm not saying, can we get AIR replace you?
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: I want to see you grow 100% next year
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_00: with 50% head count growth.
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_00: I think that's healthy today.
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_00: The way through early 2023 is I need 200% head count
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_00: to grow 100% and there's still a lot of that DNA
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_00: in the ecosystem.
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_00: It's still ricocheting around.
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_00: Probably in the majority of executives people will talk to.
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_00: It's still ricocheting around.
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_00: So I think all these things just, I don't think the seed is dead,
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_00: but as time goes by, I get more and more worried.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_00: It feels like Japan.
[00:34:57] Like our population is organically shrinking.
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_00: To just asses become like Japan.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_00: That's another thing.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_00: It's a great economy, but if everyone only has point nine kids,
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_00: I mean, there's only only so many seeds to go around.
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_02: I want to come back to the last comment first, Alma.
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_02: You're coming on two to one.
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_02: And you're exactly right.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_02: As I think about it, I hadn't thought it until you said it,
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_02: but in 2021, every discussion was some version of look.
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_02: To get that extra 10 points of growth,
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_02: we're going to be twice as inefficient at the margin
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_02: as we were overall.
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_02: And the result of that is overall efficiency is deteriorated.
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_02: What you're saying now is at the margin,
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_02: we're trying to be twice as efficient,
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_02: not inefficient at the margin.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_02: So you're exactly right.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_02: Everyone's efficiency is creeping up.
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_02: And I think that's obviously independently.
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_02: That's totally correct.
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_02: And super insightful when you said it.
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_02: It's why, and by the way, it might explain why,
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_02: even though the growth rates of the public companies
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_02: have gone down significantly,
[00:35:55] the valuations on the revenue multiple
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_02: have not gone down as much.
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_02: And I think it's because in return for slower growth
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_02: fast companies, they are at least getting
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_02: wildly more efficient fast companies.
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_02: And it's not one for one as we've discussed,
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_02: but at least it's better than nothing.
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_02: But then going back to the existential threat from work day,
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_02: I think software prices on value delivered.
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_02: And when you couldn't measure value,
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_02: all you had was perceived pricing.
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_02: And therefore, that's what people went with.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_02: Everyone has to access the software,
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_02: everyone pays so much.
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_02: Then you had usage pricing starting with AWS,
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_02: which was inherently a more rational for buyer
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_02: and sell-away to allocate value,
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_02: attract value more closely.
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_02: And I think the trend in everything
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_02: is just to get more efficient.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_02: I think that's how capitalism works.
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_02: So to the point, if you're using AI to deliver value,
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_02: it's going to be, and if the AI is doing the work,
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_02: it's going to be super hard to have a perceived model
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_02: because it's irrelevant.
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_02: Now, I don't think for a lot of work,
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_02: they will be as irrelevant to some.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_02: There are other areas, like, for example,
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_02: some areas of Salesforce, you can imagine
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_02: to the extent you entirely automate an SDR team,
[00:37:07] it's going to be hard to have a perceived SDR model.
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_02: My guess is work, they will still be able to have
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_02: some kind of X dollars per month for end employees served,
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_02: and then Y dollars per month for HR staff
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_02: actually using the software.
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_02: But there probably will be less HR staff using the software
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_02: to your point Jason, because if have to make work
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_02: that HR was doing is now done by AI,
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_02: you're not going to get the same price.
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_02: Now, maybe you have to, so therefore,
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_02: maybe you have to charge on the value delivered
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_02: versus simply the seats, and that's a more complex calculation.
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_02: And I think that is true.
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_02: It's that all our companies are wrestling with this.
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_02: You deliver a ton of value in AI,
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_02: and maybe now you get the innovation budget, no one cares.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_02: But a year, two years from now,
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_02: you're going to have to link as a startup.
[00:37:57] You're pricing to the value delivered,
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_02: and you're going to have to measure.
[00:38:01] And it's a lot harder to measure value than seats.
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_02: You can count butts and seats pretty easily.
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_02: Every login is a butt.
[00:38:08] When you're trying to measure value delivered, that's pretty.
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_02: Can we just go back to the gross and efficiency element?
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_01: I always think when you're creating content,
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_01: you have to think of your customer.
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_01: And the customer that I always have in my head
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_01: is the founder on their way to work,
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_01: or the operator on their way to work,
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_01: listening to our podcast or watching it.
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_01: And they're hearing, I want gross, gross, gross.
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_01: And now they're hearing, I also want efficiency efficiency.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_01: And two million per employee for Gamma
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_01: and lovable at whatever it is.
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_01: Do we just need both now?
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_01: And it is a higher expectation to meet the bar for VCs.
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_01: Or when you are looking at those two,
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_01: I want growth above everything
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_01: and I'm fine to see less efficiency in the early days.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_01: I think in the fastest growing companies that I have invested in,
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_00: no one gives a rat's ass about the bottom line.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_00: That's a different metric than how you scale today.
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_00: And then Rory made this point,
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_00: we all made this point before,
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_00: and I admit there's actually fewer and fewer companies
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_00: are true out performers.
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_00: So as soon as your top portfolio coming out performs,
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_00: everyone wants to give it $100 million today
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_00: at every board meeting.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_00: And no one really cares about efficiency per se
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_00: as long as they can get their money into the deal.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_00: So I don't think that's the issue.
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: I think we're confusing the fact that everybody
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_00: is just generating more revenue per employee.
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_00: But we've talked about before going to like this,
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_00: the iconic data early in the year,
[00:39:31] SPEAKER_00: the fastest growing AI companies,
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_00: even with high inference costs,
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_00: even with AI costs, have the lowest burden multiples
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_00: because their revenue is growing so much faster
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_00: than the inference costs.
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: I think that's what we're hoping for is that,
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: you know, companies have never gotten
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_00: a hundred million error more quickly.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_00: If you do, I don't think we care how you get there anymore.
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_00: I don't think we care.
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_00: But we're, but we know deep down that hiring a thousand people
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_00: isn't the way to get to a hundred million in a year.
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_00: You can't hire them that quickly.
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_00: As Maggie said, they're not all gonna be great, right?
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_00: So you literally can't brute force a hundred million
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_00: in 10 months with humans.
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_00: You just, maybe Larry Ellison or Mark Banyoff could,
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_00: but I don't think anyone else,
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_00: there's just not enough calls and I,
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_00: like you can't go from one to a hundred in 10 months
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_00: without massive and bound demand in a lot of AI.
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_00: I think you should break it up in a couple of areas
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_02: and then factor as we think about it, Jason,
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_02: it's giving me an insight on your eternal question
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_02: on employment because big picture divided up into AI startups
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_02: and mature companies.
[00:40:29] I think the comment on AOR, efficiency per AI
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_02: is very much a mature company comment.
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_02: If you're a public company and you wanna grow in 10 or 15%,
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_02: you better be kicking off cash
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_02: or you'll be in trouble real quickly.
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_02: Even if you are kicking off cash, you'll still get Greek.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_02: But those are the companies that are optimizing,
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_02: like their AOR per employee
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_02: and are just focused on FCS, we can't throw, right?
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_02: And that's a very different set of people
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_02: with a very sixth set of dynamics than the AI startup.
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_02: So we'll come to them in a second.
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_02: The public company's grinding on efficiency,
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_02: which means, as you say, lower employment and all that stuff.
[00:41:07] Now come to the private AI companies.
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_02: I think there's two categories.
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_02: There's a small number of companies
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_02: which are taking huge amounts of capital
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_02: because they need it for model development.
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_02: And primarily it's not humans,
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_02: it's they got a spend it within video.
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_02: So look, no one's telling open AI, the efficient
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_02: or if they are, he's clearly not living, right?
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, to a rounding error, those companies,
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_02: I would track, as Jason said,
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_02: able to get all the money they want,
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_02: they're not compute, have relatively small head count,
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_02: relatively to their size,
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_02: and no one's saying be efficient,
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_02: they're just saying grow quickly.
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_02: Then separately, at the ads layer,
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_02: you think something's quite different
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_02: and Gamma's a good example of that.
[00:41:42] SPEAKER_02: The interesting thing is,
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_02: because of this amazing new capability,
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_02: for lack of a better word,
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_02: the foundation models,
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_02: there are people in apps land,
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_02: building a product, shipping it,
[00:41:54] and they're getting such traction
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_02: that the traction is ahead of their ability to hire.
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_02: I mean, they're lily, there's no way to spend the money, right?
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_02: So we're seeing some of these apps companies
[00:42:02] SPEAKER_02: be astonishingly capital efficient,
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_02: especially at the early stages.
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_02: I mean, Gamma's a great example of that.
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_02: It's like you ship the product,
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_02: it's freaking amazing,
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_02: people buy it, they give you credit cards,
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_02: but the time you get around to hiring a stale force,
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_02: you're doing so much money already
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_02: that you're kicking up cash.
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_02: So at the apps level, not all the time,
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_02: I think some companies are scared of spending,
[00:42:22] SPEAKER_02: but we're seeing the combination of hyper growth,
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_02: even with the margins,
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_02: not as good as fast land, but still 60%.
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_02: If you have that,
[00:42:31] then you have quite a tract of profile, right?
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_02: Not all of them are that case,
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_02: obviously the coding companies have margin issues,
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_02: but a lot of the companies are getting a long way,
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_02: not a lot of capital and definitely not a lot of employees.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_02: So I think those are the three categories.
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_02: And the interesting thing, Jason,
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_02: this goes back to something you've been talking about,
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_02: and I've been trying to figure out the answer to
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_02: what's going on on employment, right?
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_02: Or what's the consequence?
[00:42:53] And I've been more at law be fine in the end,
[00:42:55] SPEAKER_02: and I still stand by that,
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_02: but the interesting thing when I lift
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_02: are those three categories,
[00:42:59] SPEAKER_02: the one thing they all have in common is,
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_02: they all don't need people.
[00:43:03] The big companies can have people
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_02: because they gotta be efficient.
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_02: The model companies don't need people
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_02: because they just need geniuses and GPU,
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_02: and the small AI app startups are growing
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_02: and they sit down quickly that can hire people.
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_02: Hmm, that's not great if you're people.
[00:43:18] It's not.
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_02: It's not.
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_02: And all of them are AI optimists.
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_02: I think all this unemployment thing is bullshit,
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_02: but in the near end, what you recognize,
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_02: it's why it's a toughish market for tech startups,
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_02: for employees in the tech marketplace,
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_02: because labor versus capital discussion
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_02: is you need more capital relative to labor at the moment.
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_02: The topic we have to discuss,
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_01: we talk about rapid the whole time.
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I love that.
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_01: But then Google have come out.
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: With a competitor.
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_01: And I think we've always been waiting for Google
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_01: and chat GPT to come out with one.
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_01: And it's been very good.
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_01: It's tied to Gemini,
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_01: which is obviously blown past a lot of people's expectations.
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_01: When we look at this, how did we analyze this?
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_01: And is this the case of incumbent waiting
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_01: for enough traction in a market
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_01: and then going, thank you very much, Mr. Startup.
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna come in now with great models and distribution
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_01: and it's game over.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_01: Or actually, have they left it too late?
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_01: And lovable, replet,
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_01: have built enough user base,
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_01: enough brand, enough brand trust
[00:44:21] SPEAKER_01: that actually there is still a real dominant threat
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_01: then to Google's new product with it.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_01: Well, look, for what it's worth,
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_00: I didn't try it, they launched this week.
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_00: They launched a replet lovable clone
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_00: with no database, no OAuth.
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_00: And so it's really,
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_00: they said it's coming soon.
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_00: And sometimes that's okay for big companies.
[00:44:44] SPEAKER_00: So we'll see, we'll see if,
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_00: one thing that hasn't changed is in the age of AI,
[00:44:48] SPEAKER_00: big companies only have so many priorities,
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_00: they can introduce a lot of little tests.
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_00: But at the end of the day,
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_00: it takes a lot of energy and a big company
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_00: to keep a big initiative going
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_00: because there's so much else to support.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_00: So we'll see, it wasn't impressive on itself,
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_00: but on the other hand,
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_00: it only took Google launch their competitor
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_00: in less than 10 months.
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_00: So you don't get five years anymore.
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_00: I mean, DataDoc just launched their PagerDuty
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_00: competitor like in the last 24 months.
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_00: When does PagerD Founded 2008,
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_00: you don't get that much now,
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_00: you don't even get a year.
[00:45:22] So that, the incisive pace of cloning and competition
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_00: does worry me.
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_00: Man, if you only get months before the big guys
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_00: come into your space if you blow up,
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it should make sense, right?
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_00: If you go from zero to 200 million in a year,
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_00: you should attract some competition.
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_00: Not only.
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_00: But it's not a free lunch, right?
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_01: But is there something that we take from this?
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_01: Like, Rourgist, you do a GC AI, I think it is.
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_01: Like, we're like, okay,
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_01: they're not gonna go into GC AI,
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_01: but they are gonna go into lovable.
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_01: They are gonna go into Dachagon.
[00:45:56] SPEAKER_01: They are gonna go here.
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:45:58] There's themes where they're like,
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_01: they are gonna go and there's themes where we're like,
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_01: hey, model providers,
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_01: the cool question being, hey,
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_01: where will model providers go in the application layer
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_01: and threaten all businesses?
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_01: This is, I mean, competing with coding tools
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_00: is not that big of a jump, right?
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_00: What if whatever happens?
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_00: I like, worried it a deal.
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_00: I think in the last week or scaled it,
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_00: I really liked personally, even though I didn't examine it.
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_00: You did sort of an AI for like,
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_00: wealth management or asset management, right?
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_00: I love this for a lot of reasons.
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_00: I have some questions,
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_00: but Google isn't gonna copy that.
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_00: They're not gonna copy,
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_00: automating trust, estate planning, investment advice,
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_00: tax efficiency here, your investment, legacy planning
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_00: or maybe it doesn't do all of that, the investment.
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_00: Those are spaces where you have incumbents,
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_00: but maybe have some space to run, right?
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_00: Agreed.
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_02: The model provider is not the constraint there.
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_02: And I, for the record, would say,
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_02: I don't think the model provider
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_02: will be the competition in many apps.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_02: And going back to where I started,
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_02: I think the open AI code red this morning
[00:46:58] SPEAKER_02: was frankly, tantrum to it admission
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_02: that we need to do our core mission for the next year
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_02: and probably less,
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_02: foot's around in other things.
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_02: I mean, that sound you might hear
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_02: is the consumer hardware product slipping out a little, right?
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_02: But yeah, no, so I do believe
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_02: that more of these apps are defensible.
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_02: You know, I think the model providers will be there.
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_02: I think coding is obvious.
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_02: But even when you get much beyond that,
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_02: I think if I was on the board of open AI,
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_02: you know, it's gonna be like,
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_02: when the chat GPT was and you were worth $2 trillion,
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_02: let's not foot's around with, you know,
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_02: little vertical markets that can be worth a couple
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_02: a hundred million bucks.
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_02: Why are you even talking about this?
[00:47:38] Especially when you have a, you know,
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_02: everybody poked Paul Google and Microsoft said,
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_02: we'll make them dance, open AI kind of laughed at them.
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_02: And now they're poking back and you put all your effort
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_02: behind that.
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_02: We may have seen Pete, the models are gonna do everything.
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_02: I mean, they're gonna do coding,
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_02: but I don't know if they're gonna expand
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_02: into all these verticals at that level, right?
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_02: And then yeah, thank you, Jason.
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_02: On the range wealth management,
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_02: I think the interesting comment,
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_02: and again, who always loads to just push our investments,
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_02: but I think the big picture story there is,
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_02: can you use AI to automate,
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_02: not just sell software to wealth managers,
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_02: but automate the business of wealth management.
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_02: And this is the key sentence that I like,
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_02: because I hate the word wealth management.
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_02: The idea is you can go much further down
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_02: the wealth continuum and give the same kind of product
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_02: that the super rich get in terms of managing your stuff,
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_02: managing your taxes, which is how he knows
[00:48:32] SPEAKER_02: that the UK are now not to 50% and getting higher.
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_02: So you wanna be able to manage your fares, file your taxes,
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_02: and there's a whole ton of that work
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_02: that's done expensively with humans
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_02: that can be done really cheaply with AI,
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_02: because it really is just follow the law,
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_02: fill in the forms, do the work.
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_02: And hopefully the idea there is you automate a lot of that,
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_02: and then you can deliver a high quality product
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_02: to a much broader marketplace.
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_02: And one of the big picture things
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_02: I think it's always true in investing is,
[00:49:01] SPEAKER_02: whenever you see a product that only really rich people have,
[00:49:04] if you can find a way to get that in the hands
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_02: of the rest of us, we all want it too.
[00:49:08] Yeah, the only thing is I wondered, sorry,
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_00: didn't mean to interrupt, just on,
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_00: what do we call it, the terrible tam?
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_00: It's a tam trap.
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_00: The tam trap.
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_00: On the wealth management,
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_00: what's the vendor called, sorry, I should know.
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_00: I bring it.
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_00: Range, range.
[00:49:20] SPEAKER_00: So the little echo.
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_00: I love it.
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_00: I get the problem.
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_00: Anyone's lived it that has gone through any of this stuff.
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_00: We can talk about it.
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_00: But I think you do have to be smart about the tam, right?
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_00: Because they're going to charge eight to 10 grand
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: for something that you pay a bunch of num nuts now,
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_00: 30, 40, 50 grand a year if you're wealthy, right?
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_00: Maybe more.
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_00: But it's not 10 times the price of the existing product, right?
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_00: You've got to be, you just got to be smart,
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_00: because you can pretend everyone in the world
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_00: will pay you 10 grand,
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_00: but you also have to be rational to get,
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_00: to not have a tam trap, right?
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_00: Because like, wealth friends trying to go public, right?
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_00: In theory, maybe it's a comp.
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_00: In theory, wealth front should be a $10 trillion company.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_00: I mean, everyone could use this product, right?
[00:50:03] SPEAKER_00: But in reality, there is some tam limitation
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_00: for wealth front.
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_00: I totally agree.
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_00: And it's all about segment.
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_02: I love wealth, as a comment here,
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_02: the wealth front and betterment,
[00:50:10] SPEAKER_02: those, I really love those companies.
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_02: Because again, it's back to the same thing.
[00:50:14] SPEAKER_02: I get uncomfortable in the wealth discussion,
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_02: because like, who gives a damn
[00:50:18] SPEAKER_02: what the social wealthy have to deal with, right?
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_02: Well, I loved about wealth,
[00:50:21] SPEAKER_02: and what I like about these is,
[00:50:23] SPEAKER_02: wealth front was saying, even paying 50, 70 bips
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_02: to some, to manage your money is crazy,
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_02: because we can just put it in this automatic thing
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_02: and do it automatically and for 10 bips.
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_02: And the thing about those businesses,
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_02: your tam comment, it is,
[00:50:39] SPEAKER_02: they actually take a long time to build,
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_02: because the whole value profit is which are getting you less,
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_02: and you just get to come upon more.
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_02: But in the end, they're lovely businesses.
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_02: And we looked at, actually not wealth on but betterment,
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_02: 10 years ago, and we figured it would take about this long,
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_02: 10 years to just build,
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_02: because if you're charging 1% of assets,
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_02: a billion is a lot of money.
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_02: If you're only charging one 10th of that,
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_02: you need 10 billion to get to the same place.
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_02: And if you're targeting people with less money,
[00:51:04] SPEAKER_02: by definition, it takes longer.
[00:51:06] SPEAKER_02: So these businesses take a long time to build,
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_02: but I think when they do, they're way more powerful
[00:51:11] SPEAKER_02: than some corner quote, wealth manager that's really good,
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_02: because he takes you golfing and gives you a PowerPoint
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_02: once a quarter about how badly a bunch of doing
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_02: and the really far away.
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_02: So I like that.
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_02: Or even better, they ask me if I want exposure
[00:51:23] SPEAKER_00: to private equity and venture.
[00:51:25] SPEAKER_00: That's the main value I get from Morgan Stanley.
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_00: Hey Jason, it's your advisor this quarter.
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_00: I can get you into a hot venture fund you've never heard of.
[00:51:33] SPEAKER_00: Stabbing's Lemkin 4.
[00:51:37] SPEAKER_00: The returns are negative at the moment,
[00:51:39] SPEAKER_00: but it's a lengthy J curve and it's a hot deal.
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_00: It's a 3 in 30.
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's a 3 in 30.
[00:51:43] SPEAKER_00: Triple layered SBV.
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever looked at my account?
[00:51:47] SPEAKER_00: Do you know anything about me?
[00:51:49] SPEAKER_01: OK, I didn't actually, sorry, I didn't mean to be divisive.
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_01: I didn't like this deal.
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_01: I saw this and I thought, oh, god.
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_01: Sorry.
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_01: I didn't see it.
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_01: Why don't you like it?
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_01: What big business and what good business,
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_01: really big, has been built in the wealth management space?
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_01: Wealthfront?
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_01: Well, it's a very good point.
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_01: Just post, post, post, post, post, post, post.
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_01: OK, one very old.
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_01: But we're looking at wealthfront.
[00:52:14] What, 17 years, index and every good investor and that.
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_01: How big is that?
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_01: In the opportunity, close world that we live in.
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_01: But you have to.
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_01: Really?
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_00: The reward for the question is, why does, OK, listen,
[00:52:27] SPEAKER_00: there's a gap.
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_00: There's the wealthfront in Vanguard at the bottom.
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_00: I want to hear Rory's thoughts.
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_00: And then there's the world's crappiest product,
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_00: which are Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,
[00:52:37] SPEAKER_00: which take 1% of your assets and do nothing.
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_00: I can see other than give you loans,
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_00: which are very valuable, right, for folks that don't know.
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_00: Like, literally, if you're sitting on 50 million
[00:52:46] SPEAKER_00: of NVIDIA stock right now, you can sell it
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_00: and pay $25 million in tax or a bank will give you a loan.
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_00: Now, it's not cheap today.
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_00: It's 6%.
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_00: But that's a lot better than 50% if you can do both.
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_00: That's the only product I know.
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_00: They'll tell you they'll help you with your trust.
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_00: They don't.
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_00: They refer you to someone that doesn't call you back.
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_00: They'll tell you how to do with your taxes.
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_00: And they'll tell you we're not allowed to talk about taxes.
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_00: So they can't really do anything except give you a loan.
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_00: There is such a gap in the middle of AI can do
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_00: estate planning taxes all this.
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_00: So Murray challenging me if I'm wrong.
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_00: The question is, if AI enables it,
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_00: then something that was shitty to sorry, Crummy,
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_00: to Harry's point might become great if AI let you do it,
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_00: right, it might become great.
[00:53:26] SPEAKER_00: This episode was brought to you.
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_00: It's like Goldman Sachs, 12 management.
[00:53:29] SPEAKER_01: That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:53:31] Seriously, first of all, I got to tell you just nail
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_02: that exactly the value proposition.
[00:53:35] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I like it.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_02: You deliver trust, you deliver a state, you deliver all taxes.
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_02: Because when you have to file your taxes,
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_02: the fact that you do your estate with one person,
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_02: you do your taxes with another person,
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_02: you well manage with a third person is absurd.
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_02: It should all be on the one move.
[00:53:47] SPEAKER_02: But I want to go back to your comment, Harry, on the well front.
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_02: Because again, I'm always uneasy just push out companies.
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_02: So let's talk about it.
[00:53:53] SPEAKER_02: I think an excellent comment it's not ours.
[00:53:55] SPEAKER_02: Yes, it's taken a long time to compound to here, right?
[00:53:59] SPEAKER_02: But not everything is a tech first
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_02: where the adoption cycles are five years.
[00:54:05] SPEAKER_02: I think when you launch an investment in a company like
[00:54:07] SPEAKER_02: a well front, the adoption cycle of something like that
[00:54:10] SPEAKER_02: is going to be 10 or 15 years.
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_02: So in my view, it's just on track.
[00:54:13] SPEAKER_02: And the fundamentals are lovely.
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_02: Because at scale, asset management is a wonderful business.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_02: They are providing a cheaper product than anyone else,
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_02: at 10 bips.
[00:54:23] And over, they've lined up a bunch of millennial
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_02: and whatever the generation, a little bit, all the 30-year-old
[00:54:28] SPEAKER_02: and 40-year-olds.
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_02: And over the next 10 or 15 years, that generation's going
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_02: to get rich.
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_02: They're going to get rich with wealth,
[00:54:35] SPEAKER_02: they're going to keep them money there.
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_02: And it's going to be a compounding machine.
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_02: Just like Charlie Swab was a compounding machine,
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_02: when they started in the 70s with cheap brokerage,
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_02: it took a long time.
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_02: They went through a lot of the actual owned by B of A
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_02: and then spun out in the 90s.
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_02: I was there.
[00:54:49] SPEAKER_02: But in the end, it just compounds.
[00:54:52] SPEAKER_02: Because you just over time the only good thing about it
[00:54:55] SPEAKER_02: is it does compound.
[00:54:56] SPEAKER_02: And early on, wealth management in any form
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_02: is a tough business because it takes a long time to build.
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_02: But when it does build and wealth runs
[00:55:03] SPEAKER_02: is over that gap now,
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_02: it's going to be there for the next 30 years
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_02: in front of you where there's a lot of your tech companies.
[00:55:09] SPEAKER_02: What?
[00:55:09] SPEAKER_02: I get you on the compounding machine
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_01: and I share your view in the beauty of those businesses.
[00:55:14] SPEAKER_01: But actually, you're competing for dollars
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_01: against the same people like your Kleiner Perkins
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_01: or like your Andrews and Horits,
[00:55:21] SPEAKER_01: where LPs can put money in their funds or your funds
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_01: at a B and C stage.
[00:55:26] SPEAKER_01: And they are in Gleene and they are in Rapplid.
[00:55:29] SPEAKER_01: And they are in the races to 100 million
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_01: in Fast and Me Never Scene.
[00:55:32] SPEAKER_01: And those LPs are going, wow.
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_01: Those funds are that more exciting.
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_01: And you're going, no, but it's compounding.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: It's Charles Schwab II's coming.
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_01: I promise you, watch the pod.
[00:55:44] SPEAKER_00: I don't know that that's 100% true though, Harry.
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_00: I think it's 80% true, right?
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_00: I think if you're going into raised capital for your fund
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_00: and you're being compared to Gleene and everything else,
[00:55:53] SPEAKER_00: but what I think, what I've,
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_00: I mean, Rory has more experience.
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_00: You get, I think as long as you have the numbers,
[00:55:57] SPEAKER_00: actually LPs are kind of excited
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_00: if you have a slightly different way to get there.
[00:56:02] Slightly, isn't?
[00:56:02] But you've got to have top 10% numbers.
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_00: Do you think so there?
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_01: If you've got companies that are kind of,
[00:56:07] SPEAKER_01: and actually to your point or to our point on like,
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_01: hey, bluntly growth rates are so much higher,
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_01: growth expectations so much higher.
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_01: If it is a slower compounder,
[00:56:15] SPEAKER_01: the net is round as less certain than ever.
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_01: It's less guaranteed.
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but LPs are looking backwards.
[00:56:21] SPEAKER_00: If you're sitting on multiple high performing funds,
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_00: you're going to get a fair amount of flexibility today, right?
[00:56:26] SPEAKER_00: I think the point is that it's hard to not be seduced
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_00: by the hottest deals today.
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, LPs love to see great fall on invest.
[00:56:34] SPEAKER_01: So, I sequir came into this and I'm dreaming.
[00:56:37] SPEAKER_01: But I want to push back a little.
[00:56:38] SPEAKER_02: I do take on board your point.
[00:56:40] SPEAKER_02: And there's no doubt that the velocity of validation
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_02: is super strong for AI companies right now.
[00:56:46] SPEAKER_02: If you want to do a deal with the highest probability
[00:56:48] SPEAKER_02: of a step up in the next six to nine months,
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_02: you should do an AI company that's raised at a billion pre
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_02: because 40% of the unicorns in Q1,
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_02: it was, I said, 23% last week,
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_02: one of my colleagues are correct, it'd be 40%.
[00:57:00] 40% of the unicorns that raised in Q1
[00:57:03] SPEAKER_02: to the unicorn for the first time
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_02: have already had a follow-on round.
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_02: So, I think how are you exactly right?
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_02: If you want to buy short-term momentum,
[00:57:10] SPEAKER_02: that's a great place to play.
[00:57:12] SPEAKER_02: And it's not just short-term momentum,
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_02: it's also driven by great performance.
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_02: So, yes, that's absolutely a good slug of what you're doing.
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_02: But in the end, the market in the end,
[00:57:21] SPEAKER_02: the biggest uncertainty is not,
[00:57:24] SPEAKER_02: can you get a mark up?
[00:57:24] SPEAKER_02: That's nice.
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_02: The biggest uncertainty end is,
[00:57:26] SPEAKER_02: can you build a big company here or not?
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_02: And there's so few times when you can say,
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_02: I believe you can build a big company here,
[00:57:34] that you shouldn't then screen out and say,
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_02: oh, I can build a big company,
[00:57:36] SPEAKER_02: but it might take a little too long.
[00:57:38] SPEAKER_02: Because there's a rule in engineering
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_02: that you're only as accurate as you're least accurate variable.
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_02: In other words, if you have six or seven variables
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_02: that goes into something,
[00:57:47] SPEAKER_02: your accuracy is determined by the thing
[00:57:49] SPEAKER_02: no has a wide as variance.
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_02: And if you have high certainty
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_02: that something can be a company,
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_02: that's the hard thing to do.
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_02: If you've got that and everything else,
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_02: you can adjust for valuation,
[00:57:59] SPEAKER_02: you can adjust for time, et cetera.
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_02: I would love to be in wealth front, for example.
[00:58:03] SPEAKER_02: I think it's just an awesome company.
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_02: And even if you get,
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_02: I think that will compound and you'll hold it
[00:58:08] SPEAKER_02: and 15, 20 years from now,
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_02: and it's going to start to jourid if to AI,
[00:58:12] SPEAKER_02: it's not a love that space.
[00:58:13] SPEAKER_02: It's where I play once at a time.
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_02: Can you, okay, let's do it this way, Harry.
[00:58:16] SPEAKER_02: 90, I think, swab went public in either 82 or 83.
[00:58:20] SPEAKER_02: It's public today.
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_02: It's worth $60, 80 billion.
[00:58:24] And then the five tech companies that went public in 1983.
[00:58:27] Dude, you fucking kidding me.
[00:58:28] SPEAKER_01: I was born in 96.
[00:58:30] SPEAKER_01: But my point is this, tech companies,
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_02: they come quick and most them go quick.
[00:58:35] SPEAKER_02: Now, by the way, if I'd said 1986,
[00:58:37] SPEAKER_02: you could have come back to me and said,
[00:58:40] SPEAKER_02: Microsoft, Oracle and Thun,
[00:58:42] SPEAKER_02: if I'd said, I think 82, you could have said Apple,
[00:58:45] SPEAKER_02: that's why I think I picked 83.
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_02: The point is, is that these singular different companies
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_02: that are a little like, you know, mid-andals,
[00:58:51] SPEAKER_02: these companies that are off the beaten track
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_02: and are just a different thing,
[00:58:54] SPEAKER_02: they often take longer to compound,
[00:58:56] SPEAKER_02: but they end up with more empty space.
[00:58:58] SPEAKER_02: And as I say, Schwab has compounded
[00:58:59] SPEAKER_02: for three or four decades and God's you with your inner.
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_02: I get it.
[00:59:03] SPEAKER_01: I get it.
[00:59:04] SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[00:59:05] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I just think we're playing a relevant game.
[00:59:07] SPEAKER_01: And I think this is the honest truth about new age venture.
[00:59:10] SPEAKER_01: We're playing a relevant game
[00:59:11] SPEAKER_01: where round praises four rounds in a year,
[00:59:13] SPEAKER_01: where media matters more than ever before.
[00:59:15] SPEAKER_01: The all of us here.
[00:59:17] SPEAKER_01: And where you're like, ah, slow compounding coming soon.
[00:59:21] SPEAKER_01: Play flow.
[00:59:21] SPEAKER_01: It's just a tough game.
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_01: And I think LPs are seduced by incredible
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: follow-on investors, quick up rounds and numbers still.
[00:59:31] SPEAKER_01: And I'd rather be playing that game
[00:59:34] SPEAKER_01: than the, it's coming.
[00:59:36] SPEAKER_01: And keep it going.
[00:59:37] SPEAKER_02: And you write Harry, you shouldn't have been get provided.
[00:59:40] SPEAKER_02: You also write about the underlying investments.
[00:59:43] SPEAKER_02: And so if you play that game and you're wrong
[00:59:46] SPEAKER_02: about the investments,
[00:59:47] SPEAKER_02: then you just be the guy who did a large high price runs
[00:59:49] SPEAKER_02: and a deal that didn't work.
[00:59:51] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[00:59:52] SPEAKER_02: So I agree with you.
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_02: But again, I go back to my comment.
[00:59:56] SPEAKER_02: When you have high certainty that a big company can be built here,
[01:00:00] SPEAKER_02: you wait that more highly than everything else.
[01:00:02] SPEAKER_02: I think actually Peter Thiel,
[01:00:03] SPEAKER_02: as all intelligence venture comments,
[01:00:05] SPEAKER_02: when you go back long enough,
[01:00:06] SPEAKER_02: you discover Peter Thiel made them already.
[01:00:08] SPEAKER_02: I think he said somewhere in his book,
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_02: something to the effect of,
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_02: all that matters is can you build a big company here?
[01:00:14] SPEAKER_02: And literally he said,
[01:00:14] SPEAKER_02: because that rule is so hard,
[01:00:17] because it's so hard to find them,
[01:00:19] they have no other rules,
[01:00:21] SPEAKER_02: because their perspective is,
[01:00:22] SPEAKER_02: once I filter for that,
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_02: I can't have any bullshit rules on stage, on sector,
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_02: I just want big.
[01:00:28] SPEAKER_02: And it's what gave them the courage
[01:00:30] SPEAKER_02: to do biotech defense and supper.
[01:00:32] SPEAKER_02: And I went out as brilliant of that, obviously.
[01:00:34] SPEAKER_02: But I think it's some version of that rule,
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_02: which is when you see a company that can be big
[01:00:39] SPEAKER_02: and you see it's tracking can be big,
[01:00:41] SPEAKER_02: prioritize that over hype and formal.
[01:00:44] SPEAKER_01: Well, can I be absolutely savage?
[01:00:46] SPEAKER_01: Do you have to be in that slow compounding picking,
[01:00:51] SPEAKER_01: which is, because there's two worlds in venture,
[01:00:53] SPEAKER_01: there's obvious and really, really competitive,
[01:00:57] SPEAKER_01: insane growth, really, really obvious.
[01:00:59] SPEAKER_01: And then there's, I'm going to be smarter,
[01:01:02] SPEAKER_01: pick the compounder, see beauty where others don't.
[01:01:05] SPEAKER_01: Do you have to be here respectfully,
[01:01:08] SPEAKER_01: because you're sitting in the Valley at Series B,
[01:01:11] SPEAKER_01: and you're against Andrews and founders fund,
[01:01:14] SPEAKER_01: sequer, and you can't beat them.
[01:01:16] SPEAKER_01: I think you have to do both, and you can do both.
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_02: I think again, I'm going back to my commenters,
[01:01:21] SPEAKER_02: I'm not sitting here going,
[01:01:22] SPEAKER_02: I want to filter for X, Y, or Z,
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_02: I want to filter for great companies.
[01:01:26] Then I have to win them, and you're right.
[01:01:27] SPEAKER_02: If you're identifying a great AI company in XYZ space,
[01:01:33] SPEAKER_02: then you're going to find way more competition,
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_02: which means you'll lose, or you'll win,
[01:01:37] SPEAKER_02: and you'll pay the market price to win, which won't be cheap.
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[01:01:41] SPEAKER_02: And that's one way to make money.
[01:01:42] SPEAKER_02: That's most of what we do.
[01:01:44] But you can also go and look at space and we go,
[01:01:47] SPEAKER_02: oh, I think this is interesting and differentiated.
[01:01:49] SPEAKER_02: And as long as I have the same conviction on the ultimate,
[01:01:52] SPEAKER_02: you can do both.
[01:01:54] SPEAKER_02: So you're trying to apply a momentum and hardness rule,
[01:01:57] SPEAKER_02: and I'm trying to apply a will that be a big company in the end rule.
[01:02:00] SPEAKER_02: And I get the interim consequences.
[01:02:02] SPEAKER_02: You know, there is no, to be very clear,
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_02: someone said it to me 20 years ago was an LP, right?
[01:02:09] SPEAKER_02: He said, there's no such thing as blue collar ventures.
[01:02:12] SPEAKER_02: It was a brutal comment, but I think it's your point, Harry, right?
[01:02:15] SPEAKER_02: Like there's no such thing as off-value,
[01:02:18] SPEAKER_02: random and non-cool stuff.
[01:02:19] SPEAKER_02: At the end of the day, we're building high-grote companies
[01:02:26] SPEAKER_02: and you're not going to make it on value.
[01:02:27] SPEAKER_02: You're not trying to choose on value.
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_02: You're trying to choose on certainty of a big outcome.
[01:02:32] You know, for what it's worth, listen,
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_00: I think it might be a fool's errand to invest in things
[01:02:38] SPEAKER_00: that you're just very interested in,
[01:02:39] SPEAKER_00: but I think there is an advantage to it.
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_00: And I'll tell you what I'm interested in for 26, 27.
[01:02:42] SPEAKER_00: This is why I like Roy's investment.
[01:02:44] SPEAKER_00: Is, I know this sounds obvious,
[01:02:46] SPEAKER_00: but AI for coatings great,
[01:02:48] SPEAKER_00: but we didn't even figure that out,
[01:02:49] SPEAKER_00: clawed figure that out.
[01:02:50] SPEAKER_00: Cursed it and figured this out,
[01:02:51] SPEAKER_00: repwooded, lovable, and bolted and figured it out.
[01:02:54] SPEAKER_00: I can tell you the story, clawed figured it out,
[01:02:56] SPEAKER_00: and the topic, the guys, you know,
[01:02:57] SPEAKER_00: once they quit open air, they figured it out
[01:02:59] SPEAKER_00: and everyone grafted on this, including gamma.
[01:03:01] SPEAKER_00: What I like is the next generation.
[01:03:03] SPEAKER_00: Can AI take large markets like wealth management
[01:03:06] SPEAKER_00: that don't work today, that can AI really for real
[01:03:10] SPEAKER_00: with clawed seven and everything,
[01:03:13] SPEAKER_00: and utterly disrupted?
[01:03:15] SPEAKER_00: And I think that can be huge.
[01:03:17] SPEAKER_00: And I'll give you an example.
[01:03:19] SPEAKER_00: Like I set up three trusts, okay?
[01:03:21] SPEAKER_00: And the wealth management didn't help at all,
[01:03:24] SPEAKER_00: and then I went to the lawyers, okay?
[01:03:25] SPEAKER_00: And it took me 11 months to set up three trusts.
[01:03:29] SPEAKER_00: And I said, I'm really frustrated.
[01:03:30] SPEAKER_00: This took too long to this guy that's like
[01:03:32] SPEAKER_00: a celebrated trust learner, and so he's like,
[01:03:34] SPEAKER_00: well, good news.
[01:03:35] SPEAKER_00: Most of my clients never even finished them.
[01:03:36] SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying the man I'm investment
[01:03:38] SPEAKER_00: isn't the right thing today.
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_00: If you can come in with AI and magically take
[01:03:41] SPEAKER_00: every single frustrating part,
[01:03:44] SPEAKER_00: how many Americans, like I think the Wall Street Journal
[01:03:46] SPEAKER_00: just said today, the average American retiring
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_00: is like $1.8 million in cash and equity, okay?
[01:03:51] SPEAKER_00: If you can take all the friction out of that,
[01:03:54] SPEAKER_00: all the friction out of retirement, wealth management,
[01:03:57] SPEAKER_00: investing, trust, redeploying, QSPS, and everything,
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_00: because of AI, I think you could build a $20, 40,
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_00: $50 billion company, and I would at least want to take
[01:04:10] SPEAKER_00: the meeting, because this is something that,
[01:04:13] SPEAKER_00: if AI, okay, listen, I'm just interested in intellectually,
[01:04:16] SPEAKER_00: can AI solve some of the biggest headaches that we see,
[01:04:20] SPEAKER_00: that maybe you don't see everything,
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_00: maybe they're an environmental compliance,
[01:04:22] SPEAKER_00: maybe they're in other things, maybe they're,
[01:04:25] SPEAKER_00: but it's at least worth the meeting
[01:04:27] SPEAKER_00: to see if they can utterly disrupt what's done, right?
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_00: Jason, I totally agree.
[01:04:32] SPEAKER_02: I really like the pitch here, which is,
[01:04:34] SPEAKER_02: it's not the ultra-well, they got a million people
[01:04:36] SPEAKER_02: who'll slaughter them and do their work for them
[01:04:38] SPEAKER_02: and charge them a gazillion dollars.
[01:04:40] SPEAKER_02: It stays the entrepreneur,
[01:04:42] SPEAKER_02: it's the doctor, it's the dentist,
[01:04:44] SPEAKER_02: who's earning good coin,
[01:04:45] SPEAKER_02: because we discussed earlier,
[01:04:46] SPEAKER_02: dentists and doctors are well paid,
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_02: but their affairs are modestly complex,
[01:04:50] SPEAKER_02: but they don't want to screw up their Roth IRA or withdrawal,
[01:04:53] SPEAKER_02: they want to leave their house to the kids,
[01:04:55] SPEAKER_02: they don't want to have a big estate tax problem,
[01:04:57] SPEAKER_02: those are the kind of things more complex than nothing,
[01:05:00] SPEAKER_02: but not where you can spend $20,000 on the lawyer to fix it,
[01:05:03] SPEAKER_02: that I think that's a huge market.
[01:05:05] SPEAKER_02: Even, I'm sure people in the North care know this,
[01:05:07] SPEAKER_02: but in the end of the U.S.,
[01:05:10] SPEAKER_02: unlike the U.K., everyone has to file their own taxes,
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_02: which is just one, I mean, I paid taxes
[01:05:16] SPEAKER_02: in Ireland, England and the States,
[01:05:17] SPEAKER_02: so I don't, the different systems.
[01:05:19] SPEAKER_02: Everyone has to file this God awful tax return every year,
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_02: and the many of your affairs get even mildly complex,
[01:05:25] SPEAKER_02: you do a rental property, you have a distribution,
[01:05:28] SPEAKER_02: you have a capital game,
[01:05:29] SPEAKER_02: because an investment you made in a restaurant,
[01:05:31] SPEAKER_02: suddenly your tax affairs are complex,
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_02: and if you screw it up, you're gonna pay more money.
[01:05:35] SPEAKER_02: And those are the people who need that kind of mass market,
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_02: wealth advice on how to handle their affairs better.
[01:05:41] SPEAKER_02: And right now, it's a disparate group of attorneys,
[01:05:47] SPEAKER_02: countenance, and it's quite messy.
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_02: And I do think, I like a lot of other markets,
[01:05:51] SPEAKER_02: it's a little like healthcare,
[01:05:53] SPEAKER_02: that your prior speaker was talking about.
[01:05:55] SPEAKER_02: There's a whole bunch of this,
[01:05:57] SPEAKER_02: no-able, but nonetheless, complex information,
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_02: that has to be assembled and martyled,
[01:06:03] SPEAKER_02: and at the right time, the person who has the question
[01:06:05] SPEAKER_02: has to get the right answer.
[01:06:07] SPEAKER_02: That question can be what form of cancer
[01:06:09] SPEAKER_02: is this based on the CT scan,
[01:06:10] SPEAKER_02: or how much do I owe to the US government based on these facts?
[01:06:14] SPEAKER_02: But you want the right answer at the right time,
[01:06:16] SPEAKER_02: and it turns out machines do that a lot better than humans.
[01:06:20] I take away as you need a new wealth manager, Dave.
[01:06:23] SPEAKER_01: Hi.
[01:06:24] SPEAKER_01: Seriously, a go-win-a-go-win.
[01:06:25] SPEAKER_01: Okay, I'm not just doing the go-win-a-go-win.
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_01: How about it?
[01:06:28] SPEAKER_01: I need to introduce you to, to, to, to,
[01:06:29] SPEAKER_02: I mean, how-y, one comment here.
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_02: I believe you.
[01:06:32] SPEAKER_02: Not everyone has a wealth management problem, Harry.
[01:06:34] SPEAKER_02: How about, how about we, we, we focus back on the problems
[01:06:36] SPEAKER_02: of the people, the founders that are trying to build wealth
[01:06:39] SPEAKER_02: rather than you as a rich guy trying to spend it.
[01:06:41] SPEAKER_02: Okay, come on.
[01:06:44] I'm the humble pork cost, D'Aurory.
[01:06:46] SPEAKER_00: I believe that I will disrupt some of these categories
[01:06:48] SPEAKER_00: and build huge businesses, okay?
[01:06:49] SPEAKER_00: I believe it.
[01:06:50] SPEAKER_00: Maybe be capital-efficient until you prove it.
[01:06:52] SPEAKER_00: If, if Rory's deal does 100 million growing,
[01:06:55] SPEAKER_00: 150% or 200%, everyone will flood into this.
[01:06:58] SPEAKER_00: Okay, absolutely.
[01:06:59] SPEAKER_00: And say it made, it made no sense back in the day.
[01:07:01] SPEAKER_00: So, I mean, not every founder can directly compete
[01:07:05] SPEAKER_00: with cursor as founders.
[01:07:06] SPEAKER_00: Like, we have to play to our strengths.
[01:07:08] SPEAKER_00: And if you find someone, like, I might have invested,
[01:07:10] SPEAKER_00: just because I'm passionate.
[01:07:11] SPEAKER_00: Maybe it was a bad idea.
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I, I'm into it, but you might have convinced me,
[01:07:14] SPEAKER_00: maybe just don't spend all of it.
[01:07:16] SPEAKER_00: I think it did.
[01:07:17] SPEAKER_00: It did, it did.
[01:07:18] SPEAKER_00: It did, it did.
[01:07:19] SPEAKER_00: Did he, he'll bring you into the deal.
[01:07:20] SPEAKER_00: Not bring me into the deal.
[01:07:21] SPEAKER_00: I, I think, Chef Harry, because Jason's
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_02: readily important point that I think is relevant
[01:07:26] SPEAKER_02: to our wider founders.
[01:07:27] SPEAKER_02: I think Jason, seriously, your discipline as a founder
[01:07:31] SPEAKER_02: on capital is exactly proportional to, you know,
[01:07:34] SPEAKER_02: in part two, how hot the market is perceived to be.
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_02: And if you're playing a game that's in a market
[01:07:38] SPEAKER_02: where you need to make progress before you can raise,
[01:07:40] SPEAKER_02: then you, then you don't have the ramp for raises
[01:07:43] SPEAKER_02: before Friday's strategy.
[01:07:46] SPEAKER_02: You have the capital discipline to prove your point.
[01:07:48] SPEAKER_02: In the end, if you prove it, you'll get a lot of money
[01:07:51] SPEAKER_02: to get the capital.
[01:07:52] SPEAKER_02: But I think Jason, that was a,
[01:07:53] SPEAKER_02: frankly, a spot on comment.
[01:07:54] SPEAKER_02: We could send you as a board member, literally.
[01:07:56] SPEAKER_02: It's like, here guys, little value, if you prove it,
[01:07:59] SPEAKER_02: the world will beat beat in the path to your door.
[01:08:02] SPEAKER_02: But if you have proof it, you'll be screwed.
[01:08:04] SPEAKER_01: They'll get it done.
[01:08:05] SPEAKER_01: I think that's a great note to close on.
[01:08:07] SPEAKER_01: Guys, thank you so much for being part of a live show.
[01:08:12] SPEAKER_01: There's no Kelsey Quickfire?
[01:08:13] SPEAKER_01: There's no, well, you want to call her Kelsey Quickfire?
[01:08:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:08:16] SPEAKER_01: The one Quickfire is super bass is now at five billion.
[01:08:20] SPEAKER_01: Lovable as at six.
[01:08:22] SPEAKER_01: Now obviously, lovable uses super bass for every instance.
[01:08:26] SPEAKER_01: Would you rather be in super bass?
[01:08:30] SPEAKER_01: Or would you rather be in lovable?
[01:08:32] SPEAKER_02: I'll say lovable.
[01:08:33] And I'll tell you why.
[01:08:36] SPEAKER_02: I think super bass is benefiting
[01:08:37] SPEAKER_02: by the trend of vibe coding.
[01:08:41] SPEAKER_02: And lovable is a bet fundamentally.
[01:08:43] SPEAKER_02: It's in the front end monetizing on vibe coding.
[01:08:46] SPEAKER_02: One of two things happened.
[01:08:47] SPEAKER_02: I'd have vibe coding as a category or it's not.
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_02: If it's not a category, border the most screwed.
[01:08:52] SPEAKER_02: And if it is a category, lovable gets more of the money
[01:08:55] SPEAKER_02: than super bass.
[01:08:56] SPEAKER_02: Just because it's the front end and it gets,
[01:08:58] SPEAKER_02: I don't know, 20 bucks and they pay two over to super bass.
[01:09:00] SPEAKER_02: Some version like that.
[01:09:01] SPEAKER_02: So if you're in a highly whiskey category,
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_02: the dumb best is to be well, if I win, I get a little,
[01:09:07] SPEAKER_02: but if I lose, I lose 100%.
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_02: You may as well be in for a penny versus in for a pound,
[01:09:11] SPEAKER_02: as we would say in the UK.
[01:09:13] SPEAKER_02: And the thing about the lovable bet is,
[01:09:15] SPEAKER_02: if you win, you're going to win big,
[01:09:16] SPEAKER_02: which of course is why a smart young man like you
[01:09:19] SPEAKER_02: are in lovable, how are you?
[01:09:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I thought I'd put in one pitch for you there, dude.
[01:09:23] SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much.
[01:09:24] SPEAKER_02: I would take super bass.
[01:09:25] What?
[01:09:25] I would take super bass.
[01:09:26] SPEAKER_02: No, I'll tell you what, for what it's worth,
[01:09:28] SPEAKER_00: this is how I'm feeling today because of stability.
[01:09:31] SPEAKER_00: I think super bass is a harder problem to solve.
[01:09:33] SPEAKER_00: Yep.
[01:09:33] SPEAKER_00: And so right now today, this is where I'm conservative.
[01:09:36] SPEAKER_00: I want, there's just so much change.
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_00: I don't know what Google's going to do.
[01:09:40] SPEAKER_00: I would just prefer a harder problem today.
[01:09:43] SPEAKER_00: And even if my returns were the same or lower,
[01:09:45] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I'm sleeping fine.
[01:09:47] SPEAKER_00: But I'm just anxious about cloneable stuff
[01:09:53] SPEAKER_00: and I want hard problems are reassuring.
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_00: Only so many people, I mean, at the end of the day,
[01:09:58] SPEAKER_00: super bass is just, I think, a fork of postgres.
[01:10:01] SPEAKER_00: It's open source that they've redone.
[01:10:02] SPEAKER_00: It can be done again, neon did it, that replete lose
[01:10:06] SPEAKER_00: and data breaks bottom for a billion.
[01:10:08] SPEAKER_00: But data bases are a hard problem.
[01:10:10] SPEAKER_00: You can only lose so much data.
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_00: You can only have so many issues.
[01:10:13] SPEAKER_00: You have to figure this out.
[01:10:14] SPEAKER_00: And five years of investing in a database
[01:10:16] SPEAKER_00: everybody uses, it's, it ain't so easy to turn
[01:10:20] SPEAKER_00: and leave your database, right?
[01:10:21] SPEAKER_00: And so I just, this is what I'm thinking going into next year
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_00: if we want to close.
[01:10:25] SPEAKER_00: This was a year where we didn't, we tolerated a lot of
[01:10:28] SPEAKER_00: term, we only cared about, this was the year of growth,
[01:10:31] SPEAKER_00: but nothing.
[01:10:31] SPEAKER_00: And so's next year.
[01:10:33] SPEAKER_00: But I'd love a little defensibility.
