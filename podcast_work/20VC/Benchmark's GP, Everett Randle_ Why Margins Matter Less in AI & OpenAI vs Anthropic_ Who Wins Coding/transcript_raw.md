[00:00:00] I think we should not be placing that much emphasis on margins today.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: We need a new taxonomy for AI companies.
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_00: I'm thrilled to welcome Benchmark's newest partner, Everett Randall.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_01: Benchmark are one of the best firms in Benchmark.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_01: Tiger died, and we got six or seven more tigers.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_00: I don't think, rather, you're Hamont, or even Ben and Mark at this point, I don't think
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_00: that they can go to LPs and say, hey, we're going to get you 5x net on that.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_00: And when you're writing billion dollar checks, that is your main product.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: Go talk to the principles, the junior partners, and the associates at those firms.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: And you tell me that capital velocity is not the nor star of those firms.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: I think tigers going to end up much better than anyone thought they were going to end up.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_00: What do you think the biggest threat is to Benchmark being successful in the next 5 years?
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_01: I think...
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_00: Ready to go?
[00:00:57] Ev, I am so excited for this.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: I cannot believe we have not done this before.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_01: I think I've personally timed it pretty well if I'm honest.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_01: I'm rather chuffed with myself.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_01: But thank you so much for joining me today.
[00:01:09] Thank you, Harry.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: I have actually been listening to 20 Minutes VCs since 2017,
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_00: which ironically, I think is the year that you had Peter on the first time.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_00: And it's just been so fun to watch the show and the platform that you've built grow.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_00: This way it's almost like watching a startup become an IPO worthy company or something.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_00: So congrats to you, Harry.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: Do you know what?
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: I've had a man crush on Peter Fenton since that first show.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: I remember he told me that price is a litmus test for your conviction.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_01: And I think about that at least on a weekly basis.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_01: And I've repeated it to my team many, many times.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: Before we dive into Benchmark, you've worked with some of the best from Peter Teal.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: Obviously it found us fund Mary Meeker at Bond, Mamoon Hamid.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_01: One of my big bros at Client & Parkins.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_01: If I would ask you for your biggest takeaway from each,
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_01: what would you say your biggest investing takeaways from each of them?
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_01: One of the things I really love about the asset class that we practice our craft in
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: is that there's so many different ways that you can be successful at it.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: And there's so many different strategies and frameworks that you can employ
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_00: and still generate amazing returns.
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_00: I think in each of the people that you just mentioned,
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: have very, very different styles and different ways of practicing their craft.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_00: I think if I was to lay out for Mary, for Peter, and for Mamoon,
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: kind of what I learned from them specifically, I think with Mary,
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_00: she does such an incredible job.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: Everyone thinks of her as this quantitative investor.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, she had the her time as an equity researcher at Morgan Stanley during the dot com bubble.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_00: And then she came to Client & Parkins obviously.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: And everyone talks about these DCF models she creates and all the numbers that she does.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_00: But she's really the most qualitative investor that I've ever worked with.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_00: And it's probably a surprise to hear that.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_00: But what she does is she, it's almost like she's reading the matrix.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_00: Like she lays out all the sequential numbers historically for a company
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: and then all the numbers going forward.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: And it's almost like she's, you know, reading the matrix code as it comes down.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: And she's seeing what the company will become on an eight to 10 year time horizon
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: when she sees what the numbers are.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: And so she'll look at a door dash model.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: And that was an investment that she, that we had led a KP out of the growth fund at the time.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: And she won't see, you know, seven years out 80% growth or something like that.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: She'll see that, you know, 20% of households are going to be ordering from door dash on a monthly basis.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: And she can visualize that.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: And so from her, I just learned that when you use numbers in venture growth
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_00: and when you want to be quantitatively driven, don't get stuck into a quantitative lens with it.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_00: Actually use that to drive the narrative and drive the story of an investment.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: And that's been, that's been an incredible mental framing that I've used with,
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_00: with someone like Peter Teal, Peter, I think so much of his cleverness and so much of his genius
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_00: is actually in the way that he builds his firms rather even than his investments.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: So the way that he's designed founders fund is that he created, he creates all these incentive structures and mechanisms
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: almost to like constantly be testing your conviction.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: So there's a program, for example, at founders fund where anyone that works on an investment
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_00: or if you're leading an investment, you can personally invest alongside the firm in that investment,
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: almost as if you're angel investing.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_00: And at, you know, first glance, it just looks like this amazing perk that you can have
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: by being an investor at founders fund.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_00: But deeper down, it's a conviction test.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: Because if you're sponsoring some pro-rata of a company that's like doing okay but not great,
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_00: but the founder really wants you to do pro-rata to not blow up the round,
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: but you're not doing some of your portion of the individual side of that investment
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_00: and your angel investment, Peter can go to you and say,
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: do you not think this is better than having your money in the S&P?
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_00: Like why would we give our LPs this allocation in this round if you don't even want to put your own money in this round?
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_00: So there's like a hundred different things like that that exists in founders fund that aren't explicit,
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: like, hey, like, are you have a high conviction, but test your conviction in deeper ways?
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_00: I absolutely love that in terms of a conviction test.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_01: Do you ever just reflect on that fear that if you had that with a younger person,
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_01: say, when you were at founders fund, if you don't have that much liquid cash,
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_01: it is a lot when you have rent and bills.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: And I'm thinking through this as an active partner with you now,
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: because I'd love to implement that in 20 VC,
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_01: but I would hate for people to be scared and then say no to something,
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_01: because they didn't have the cash that could be great.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_01: What do you think?
[00:05:36] It's super valid.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: I think again, if you're at founders fund, you are full in and you're all in,
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: and so I think most of us, most of us that were young at founders fund at the time,
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: all had like debt lines, like, unsecured debt lines that we were using to do these side kind of personal investments.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, it's turned out to be an unbelievable portfolio for myself personally,
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_00: and it's all worked out.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: And so I'm very glad that I had it, but I think that's part of,
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_00: you know, he throughout his entire career has really, again, designed his organization,
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_00: so people are all in.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: He had like a bonus system for PayPal employees if they lived within like a couple miles of the office,
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_00: you'd give them more money.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_00: Like, he just designs the orgs this way, and so there's less pressure for the young folks that don't have
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_00: much net worth yet for sure, but they still expect you to be scrappy and find a way to do it.
[00:06:27] What do you think no one knows about the inner workings of founders fund that they should know?
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_01: From the outside in, I mean, obviously founders fund is a bit of like a black box.
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_00: Everyone's like, wow, the returns are amazing.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: There's a bunch of weird personalities within that place.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: Like, how does it all happen?
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: I think when I was actually doing back channel references on founders fund before joining,
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: something that everyone said to me that they thought was a negative,
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: but ended up being a huge positive.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_00: They're like, oh, you really got to watch out about the culture, because
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: I've heard that they yell at each other during ICs, like investment committee meetings,
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: and like they get super intense.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: And then a few months into the actual job at founders fund,
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_00: I realized that like, yeah, sometimes people did yell at each other at ICs,
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: but it was because it's almost like yelling at your brother or like yelling at your sister,
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_00: or yelling at your best friend.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: Everyone was so secure in themselves and the relationships that they had with each other,
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_00: and they all have extremely deep relationships with each other,
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: that you could actually just be extremely truth-seeking.
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_00: You weren't afraid to step on toes.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_00: You weren't afraid to do anything that might be seen as like,
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_00: oh, you shouldn't say that to a GP or something.
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_00: It was just no holds barred, complete truth-seeking.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: Everyone trying to get to the best answer.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: I remember a few months into the job, I was like on an email thread and just like teed off on Keith,
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: or a boy, our good friend.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: And you know, at any other firm that might be a fireball offenser,
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: you might get tongue lashing for doing that, but at founders fund,
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_00: it was like a pat on the back.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: It's like, yes, it's like, that is how we do things here.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: It's flat.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: We're just trying to get to the truth.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: We're not trying to uphold some political bureaucracy or something like that.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: And then Keith, why do you...
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_00: Actually, that should be fair.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: That is a bold take there for a younger person in their first years.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_01: Paul Don, that's conviction going up against Keith in that way.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: If we go to Mammun, what are the takeaways for Mammun?
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: I think Mammun is just one of the grays.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_01: He's done so well with KP.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: What are the takeaways for Mammun?
[00:08:23] Yeah, Mammun.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_00: I've learned so much from Mammun.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_00: He's a wonderful mentor.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we were talking before the show Harry about the kind that he showed you.
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_00: When you were young, he did the same thing for me.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: I think the biggest thing that Mammun has taught me,
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: and this is a reflection of what he did and has done in his career.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: I think the two biggest things are,
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: one, he really imparted on to me that you need to, early in your career,
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_00: see excellence up close.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: And in terms of a company, a management team, a founder,
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: you need to see how the absolute best operate and do the job of company building.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: Because if you don't see that, relatively early in your career,
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: it's much, much harder to spot it in the wild.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_00: And you also don't know the bar to hold your other founders and your other management teams too.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_00: And so his, like I think he does a very good job of getting younger folks that work at
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_00: Kleiner Perkins or even back at social,
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_00: involved in the very, very best companies in those boardrooms,
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: seeing how they operate.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_00: Because he thinks like once you've seen it,
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_00: and once you know the it of like what makes an A++ team tick,
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: you can one, much easier see that in the wild.
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: And then two, you can really hold the rest of your management teams and founders that you work with
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_00: to that really high standard.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: And I think Mammun more than anyone has just developed this impeccable taste around,
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: like a mix of products, market, and people.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_00: If you think about his huge, huge winners, whether it's Figma, Glean, Ripling,
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_00: they all have like a common through line of the, you know, it's B2B software.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: But it's almost like consumer-like software that demands really high user love and engagement.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: And he's just developed this really, really tight understanding of where he shines and where he has
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: a really deep understanding of companies.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_00: And then he's like really sharp in his taste in doing that.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: And so I think he encourages, he's definitely encouraged me and encourages people that he works with
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_00: to really develop like a specific form of taste around the people and the products and the
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_00: companies that you think are going to be, going to be the big ones.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: He very kindly messaged me the other day and said, hey, I'd love to bring you into one of my deals,
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_01: Revo, and the founders amazing.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: And you'd be great for it.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_01: And I messaged my team just being like, hey, we're doing a deal.
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_01: It's amazing.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_01: Mammun's bringing us in.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_01: We're done.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_01: Diligence over.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_01: And they're like, how I know you can't be serious.
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, it's B2B.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_01: It's kind of PLG.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_01: It's Mammun.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_01: Would you like your job tomorrow?
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_01: So I totally agree and get you there.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_01: Can I just ask before we move to benchmark, you mentioned, I love this dude.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_01: You mentioned Mary Meeker and the mental plasticity that she had around numbers and what the future could be.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_01: Where were you not mentally plastic?
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_01: Where you should have been.
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_01: And what did you learn from that?
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_01: And so like an example for me would be like, I met Alex at deal when it was two on ten.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_01: And I looked at paychecks.com and ADP.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, nah, ship market, incumbents, distribution advantage,
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: crap investment, auto mistake.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_01: I wasn't mentally plastic and I should have been.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: What would yours be?
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_01: An instance where I haven't been, you know, where I haven't, you know, exuded neuroplasticity enough.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_00: I actually have a very recent example of this.
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_00: Was actually the opening eye around at $32 billion.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_00: And you know, I started my career in private equity, which I think gave me a lot of,
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_00: there's a lot of strengths that come from that.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_00: But it's also definitely given me some blind spots,
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_00: inventor that I've like needed to unlearn a little bit.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_00: And when I was at Foundersfront, I was actually extremely positive on opening eye.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: This was like, I left Foundersfront right after Chatchy-P-T came out.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_00: And Chatchy-P-T when it came out was one of those moments where you're like,
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_00: this like, this product is it.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_00: Like, this is so unbelievably cool.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_00: And you could just tell that it was going to be a massive, massive product.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: And then the $32 billion round of opening eye came around when I was at Cliner Perkins.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_00: And all of a sudden I was like, oh man, this structure seems really gnarly.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: You know, they're going to have to convert this somehow.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_00: It's a nonprofit.
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: They're selling these employee units.
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_00: And I think they're going to dilute the hell out of the investor base.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: And so I got spooked and I missed the forest for the trees.
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_00: Both in terms of the structure of the company at the time and the potential future dilution.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_00: By the way, both of those things were very valid risks that, you know,
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_00: I mean, the structure at certain points have almost taken the company down.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_00: And then they have diluted a ton given that they've had to attract all these AI researchers
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_00: and all this incredible talent.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: But it didn't end up mattering.
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: Like, it didn't, like, none of that ended up mattering.
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_00: What ended up mattering is that it, you know, it's had the strongest and highest growth
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_00: trajectory of any technology company in history.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_00: And it's probably the best and most useful product that anyone that uses it has in their pocket.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_00: And so I think Josh Kushner actually does probably the best job of this.
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_00: Where, you know, he talks about his intuitions and, you know, he saw Spotify and just kind of new
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_00: that no matter what he needed to invest in the company and say him with Instagram,
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_00: I still need to learn to trust my intuitions more.
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: Because sometimes I let silly things like that cloud my thinking.
[00:13:38] Josh taught me one of the most valuable lessons that he taught me.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_01: If you're ever willing to do less in a deal, don't do the deal.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: You know, oh, I'm happy to take 10% if it means giving my buddy 3%.
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_01: Don't do that deal. That's a bad signal.
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_01: I remember Vince came on the show when he did that deal.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_01: And he said, Harry, listen, if it's a trillion dollar company, we'll all make money.
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_01: And we laughed at the time.
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_01: And now it's like, oh, it might be a trillion.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_01: It's a trillion dollar company.
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_01: Three trillion, who knows?
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Do you think it'll be a trillion dollar company next year?
[00:14:10] I think it'll be a trillion dollar company next year.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_00: Yes. I think they could probably raise at the end of the year.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you know, end of the year Q2, I think,
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_00: open AI could raise it a trillion dollars.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_00: No problem.
[00:14:22] Would you all to be in open AI at 500 or on Throat Pick at 350?
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_01: Obviously, a client or Perkins, we invested in a Throat Pick and we had this debate a lot
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: internally. And I think everyone kind of, this is like a fun debate, you know,
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: open AI or on Throat Pick at last last round price.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_00: I think they represent relatively different things.
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_00: In terms of downside risk, it's hard to imagine anything that could not
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_00: chat GPT off of its growth trajectory.
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: I don't know what could stop chat GPT from growing at the rate that it's growing.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_00: And so I think that asset alone is just unbelievably valuable and is completely locked in.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_00: There's just no way that it's not going to be the most important kind of consumer destination
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_00: over the next five years and consumer app over the next five years.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: I think where everything else is still kind of hand-to-hand combat is obviously encoding.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_00: I think opening AI has actually done an incredible job with CodeX
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_00: and made up a bunch of progress against Anthropic that they didn't have before.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: And then obviously on everything on the B2B side, I think right now Anthropic probably has
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: a bit of an edge on B2B. They've spent a lot more time and resources towards really mastering
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_00: that kind of commercialization effort there.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_00: And then encoding and Thropic still with Cloud Code and
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: and Sonnet and all the models that they have is probably still a little bit ahead of OpenAI.
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_00: But I think given chat GPT, I think I would probably rather do OpenAI at 500th and
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_00: Anthropic at 350. But I both think that they're relatively good investments even today.
[00:15:50] I would be thrilled with both just in case Darry or Sam are listening.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_01: I'm very happy to take some shares.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_01: Very happy.
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: If you want to help me out here.
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_01: Sam, I'll buy Braggusness if you want that one.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_01: Because he doesn't want me.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: Give us Brad's.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: I won't ask any questions.
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_01: I'll just wear a Sam T-shirt.
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_01: What happens to Curse?
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: Because you see Codex, Crushit actually.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: As you said there,
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_01: Cloud Code has done so well.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_01: What happens to Curse?
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: I mean that with no.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: I'm purely lost on that one.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I think everyone,
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_00: I think the thing that everyone has us to underestimate as far
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_00: is just how immense of a potential market code can be.
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_00: So when you think about Curse,
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: I think a lot of people are like,
[00:16:38] SPEAKER_00: well, they're like relative market share has gone down a lot.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: Because at first it was really just them.
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_00: And then Cloud Code came out.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_00: And then Codex came out.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_00: And now cognition is scaling.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: So instead of like 80% of the market or something,
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_00: maybe they have 25% to 30% of like the overall error in the market today.
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: Well, again, what people are missing is that
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_00: the market of code generation
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: has gone something like, I don't know, over the last two and a half years.
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_00: It's gone from essentially zero to probably like six or seven billion dollars of error.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_00: And something that we used to do at KPN Founders Fund
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_00: is try to identify what are the golden categories.
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_00: And a golden category is a category that
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_00: as like the entire market for a single product adds a billion of net new
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_00: ARR in a single year.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_00: And like if you find a golden category,
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_00: you essentially, if you're especially if you're a multi stage fund,
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_00: you have to have a better net category because it means that it's going to produce really big outcomes.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_00: Instead of adding a billion dollars of net new this year,
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: I think code generation is going to add, I don't know, four or five billion dollars of net new
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_00: across every single product and service that's available for people to buy,
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_00: both on the B2B and B2C side.
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_00: Can I ask, does AI not make every category a golden category?
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_01: And I don't mean that kind of stupidly,
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_01: but like you can cost them the service, of course,
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_01: tens of billions of dollars.
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_01: But even if you think about, you know, much more verticalized software plays,
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_01: could you not apply golden category to everything then?
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_01: And should we not move a billion to 10 billion?
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_01: It does for a lot of categories.
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it remains to be seen, right?
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_00: Because I think, I don't know, if it like,
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_00: let's say, you know, you're doing AI for vets, like veterinarians.
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: Maybe there's just not enough vets that have enough money to actually create
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: a billion of net new in a given year.
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_00: But I do think that, yeah, for so many categories that seemed like,
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_00: you know, maybe they were kind of middleing in size.
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_00: A lot of what AI has been able to do, especially if it can touch
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_00: something that a labor force within a category was doing before,
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_00: we're seeing much, much bigger markets.
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_00: As one example that I'll give you of this impact,
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_00: we at KP were invested in a home services AI business that was essentially a 24-7,
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_00: like its first product is a 24-7 receptionist for,
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_00: you know, HVAC people, home services,
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_00: anyone that would be a service-tightened customer.
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_00: And we were calling customers and we're like, okay, how much do you spend on service-tightened,
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_00: they're like, you know, 250K?
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, okay, well, how much are you spending on this company?
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: And they're like, you know, 250K.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, okay, you have seven products from service-tightened from SAS 2.0
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_00: and you have one product that's just out of beta from this new startup in voice AI.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_00: And you're spending as much on that as you are on service-tightened,
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: like the system of record for everything that you're doing.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_00: And they're like, yeah, well, you know, like we no longer have to staff, you know,
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_00: three receptionists, we can staff two.
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_00: And then we're now able to actually accept calls and book appointments 24-7,
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_00: rather than, you know, the nine-to-four schedule that our receptionists were sitting there.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_00: And so it's driving more revenue and more impact than even service-tightened was doing,
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_00: you know, given that capabilities are just so much broader and real than
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_00: the impacts that SAS can have on companies.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: Ev, are we going to be fast enemies?
[00:19:57] Oh, no.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_00: Was that pro-book?
[00:20:00] No, no, this one, lemary, let around in Avoca, is the company's name.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_00: Oh, thank God. I lost it.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_01: And I didn't know who I lost it to.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_01: And it's exactly that.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_01: Where it's exactly the same way.
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_01: How much do you spend on service-tightened?
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_01: And then it's like the same if not more.
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_01: And you're like, oh my God, that is like one incredibly valuable segment,
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_01: then that we're covering.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_00: And I think it gets to something that I desperately want us to do in the venture industry, which is
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_00: we need a new taxonomy for AI companies.
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_00: And what I mean by that is everyone tries to, like, AI app companies are
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_00: meaningfully different than SAS companies in, like, a dozen different ways.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_00: Yet we keep trying to shove all the metrics from these AI app companies into the frameworks
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_00: that we created for SAS.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_00: What was the proposal on that?
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_01: What metrics do we try and shove in that we shouldn't?
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_01: If you just think about the PNL of a SAS company, you know, Robert Smith, the CEO of the first firm
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_00: that I ever worked at, Vista Equity Partners, always used to say, probably still says,
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_00: SAS is great because it tastes like chicken.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_00: All the businesses are the same.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_00: And the whole thesis behind Vista was that SAS companies are so similar that you can do the same
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: exact things to each of them in the whole, like, Vista Playbook style and make them way more
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: profitable and run a lot more efficiently. And so we're used to, like, oh, like, gross margins
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_00: need to be 80%. Gross retention should be, you know, high 80s percent.
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_00: Net retention should be over 120.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_00: There should be very little capex.
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_00: And like, that's what makes a good company.
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_00: And I think what you're seeing with AI app companies is a very different situation where,
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_00: if they're good companies with a lot of usage, you have a lot of AI inference in your
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_00: cogs that you don't for normal SAS companies.
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_00: And so people are like, oh, you know, these are worse companies because they have worse gross
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_00: margins. But if your average gross profit per customer can be four or five X that of a normal SAS
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_00: company, then you actually have much more absolute dollars of gross profit per customer.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_00: And potentially a much, much larger market than you do for SAS companies as well.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_00: So instead of talking about gross margins and revenue multiples, I hope that at some day,
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_00: we talk about gross profit multiples. And we talk about absolute gross profit dollars per
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_00: customer because if your relationship with a customer can be much, much broader because you're
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_00: taking part of their labor budget or you're giving them more economic value than you would
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_00: if you're having a SAS company, it's just not appropriate to be grading them on a metric
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_00: on like, you know, oh, do they have 80% gross margins?
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_00: It's like, well, if service titan has, you know, $200,000 of gross profit per customer.
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: And this other company has $500,000 of gross profit per customer.
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_00: I don't care that that second company has 50% gross margins and service titan has 75%
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_00: gross margins. It doesn't matter. So I think that's the biggest example is that the contract
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_00: sizes can be much larger, even if the gross margins are lower. But I think there's several others
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_00: in terms of, you know, some, you know, train their own models and so there's, you know, training costs
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_00: in other various changes as well.
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_00: So should we not help me out? Should we not play such emphasis on margins?
[00:23:02] SPEAKER_01: I think we should not be placing that much emphasis on margins today.
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_00: I think the work that we should be doing is trying to understand what is the terminal gross
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_00: margin structure look like for these businesses. And then also what is the absolute gross profit
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_00: dollars in each of these categories that these companies can, can represent? Because it's just,
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_00: again, like I think the folks over at Injus and Horowitz have done a lot of good work in terms
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_00: of evangelizing this idea that like if you have high gross margins as an AI app company right now,
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_00: it probably means that you have very little inference expense, like AI inference expense in your
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_00: cogs, which means no one's actually using your AI features. It's not the easiest thing to understand,
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_00: like what are these AI app gross margin profiles going to look like in five to seven years?
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_00: But I think that like at least trying to go from first principles and reason about what the
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_00: like the gross profit dollar per customer and the gross margins of these companies in five to seven
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: years look like, that is so much more worth doing and it's such a better intellectual exercise
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_00: than trying to compare it to SaaS, which is just a very, very different business and it has a very
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_00: different pricing and business model that isn't going to be as relevant I think over the next 10
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_00: years. It's so interesting. Rory O'Jour school from scale who's basically not my adopted father.
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_01: He doesn't know that so like well done, you've just gained the sun. But he's listening to this show
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_01: like wow, this is a productive show. But he always tells me that fundamentally whether we make money
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_01: from AI or not will be predicated on whether we see the movement from human labor budgets to AI
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_01: software spend. I think exactly to your point there for everyone who's trying to understand
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_01: absolute dollars in terms of profit, your margin can be lower but because the spend is five X,
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_01: your absolute profit is significantly higher on a per customer basis, right?
[00:24:46] Exactly. So let's think about AWS for example, like AWS actually don't know their exact
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_00: gross margins but they're not as high, they're not 80%. Let's say they're like 50 or 60%.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_00: I know that they're operating margins I think are about 30%. The thing about AWS is it is the largest
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_00: line item for essentially any large software business versus anything else that they pay for.
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_00: Like you're paying more for AWS than you're paying for sales force, work day, any other SaaS
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_00: company by a wide, wide margin. It's like in the early 2010s you had companies doing like $150
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_00: million of revenue and people started to be like what is this $30 million COGS line to Amazon
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_00: web services? What in the hell is this? I think that's an amazing example of yeah, does AWS have
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_00: lower gross margins than Adobe? Of course it does. But everyone that uses AWS and is a core customer
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_00: of AWS spends multiples on AWS than they do on Adobe, which is why it's such an unbelievably
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_00: large business, probably a trillion dollar business if it was spun out of Amazon. So like that is the
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_00: idea that I think we need to all get in our heads is like it's not going to be every company,
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_00: it's not going to be every market. But for the right AI companies in the right markets, the size of
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_00: their revenue per customer is going to be so much larger than SaaS that even if they have lower gross
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_00: margins, it's going to be much, much more valuable companies going to that as well. What is
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_01: AWS? It's a commodity. And that's what I find so interesting, I was like, oh,
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_01: models won't make money because they just commodity businesses and then you look at Google Cloud,
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_01: you look at Azure and you look at AWS and you're going, wow, maybe the best business in the world
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_01: is a commodity business to your point. One of the things I've changed my mind on over the last two
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_00: years is that there's these AI inference cloud businesses. So it's like who's going to be the
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_00: AWS GCP Azure of the AI era. And when they were when Corweeve was first raising in private markets,
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_00: I was like, oh my god, this is the reselling a commodity. You know, there are middleman,
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_00: there are broker of compute, it's going to be low margin yada yada yada. How wrong was I?
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's a I mean, maybe it's the markets down a little bit. But last time I checked,
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_00: it was a $60 billion public company. Nebius is a $30 billion public company. There's over a
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: $100 million of public market cap and there's several private players that are growing
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_00: astronomically as well in this AI inference cloud. So I think sometimes we can twist our mind and
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_00: knots over like, oh, is the business quality okay when you have demand like this? Like you have for
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_00: the initial like the initial hyperscaler clouds. And I think we're seeing an even greater
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: co-ordered demand curve for for AI inference. Sometimes you just got to shut your mind up and invest
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: with the momentum. I totally agree in terms of shut your mind up and investing with momentum.
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_01: But it brings me to the other element, which is different than ever before. You mentioned
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_01: now the change from margin to focus on absolute gross dollars per customer. The thing is different
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_01: is growth rates. And I think the thing that I'm struggling with is sustainable versus unsustainable,
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_01: but also being a sucker for momentum and high numbers. How do you think about the importance of
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_01: growth rate optimizing for it versus sustainability? And do we need a new taxonomy around
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_01: growth rate as well? I think we do. I think we again, I think the things that we need to hold
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_00: into our head when we're thinking about, man, you know, we have companies going zero to 100
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_00: and less than a year. We've never seen that. But at the same time, is it easy come, easy go?
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_00: And we had early, you know, we had we had early examples of this. I'm comfortable saying this
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_00: because now the company is rebounded and to my knowledge is doing really well. But I remember when
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_00: people were talking about Jasper, like the two AI investments that started the wave were stability AI
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_00: and Jasper AI. And well, stability, different story. But Jasper, you know, I think it went zero to 100
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_00: very, very quickly, but then actually started shrinking. And it was because it was sort of easy come,
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_00: easy go with the revenue. And they hadn't built enough scaffolding and they hadn't built enough
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_00: like actual true value in order to like really sustain the customer relationships they had
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: and sustain their growth rates. So the way I've actually been thinking about this, especially as
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_00: it relates to, because I think the other aspect of this is that what is the risk for a lot of these
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_00: app layer companies? And who are they at danger against? It's the laps. Like the labs are creating
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_00: apps. They're creating more value of the models and they're giving them directly to users. And
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_00: oftentimes as an app company, you need to be doing better than what $20 a month can get you from
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_00: ChatGPT. And so I think the way to think about it is that for a lot of these categories, the labs
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_00: set the baseline in terms of customer experience. They're like, they're your competition at your
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_00: base layer. And so whatever you can get from ChatGPT or whatever you can get from anything directly
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_00: from the labs apps themselves, you need to be sufficiently differentiated from that because they're
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_00: happy to, you know, charge $20 or $200 per month per user. And a lot of these AI companies want to
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_00: charge a lot more than that in order to have a sustainable business equation and be able to like
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_00: actually do B2B distribution. So I think when you think about like Jasper at first, the issue that
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_00: they ran into was that, you know, people when GPT 4 came out, they started being like, wow,
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_00: like the outputs I'm getting from Jasper are kind of the same that I'm getting for 20 a month
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_00: from opening AI. Like I'm not going to pay, you know, however much more for Jasper, I'm just going
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_00: to use ChatGPT. But I think what they've done now is build sufficiently differentiated workflow
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_00: software and been able to like tie in LLMs through the life cycle of how their users work and
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_00: operate in a way that is sufficiently differentiated and gives them more of a moat. Like I don't think the
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_00: sources of moats have changed from SAS to AI necessarily. Like the seven powers are still the seven
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_00: powers, all the same ways to build differentiation are there. The stakes are just much higher because
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_00: the growth rates are much higher. And the labs are just getting so much better so quickly, especially
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_00: at delivering applications. How do you feel about people who say the moats have changed? The moats
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_01: that was technology is now fundamentally distribution in terms of access to customers and data and
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_01: access to data. And they shifted from technology to those two. Do you disagree with that or do you
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: agree with them? I definitely disagree with that. I think the moat is still fundamentally in
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_00: technology, not in distribution. I think distribution obviously gives you the right to build differentiated
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_00: technology. But I think one of the huge learnings that we've had as an industry is how damn hard it
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_00: is to build good AI products. Like a good AI product is so much different to build than a good
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_00: SAS product. Like you need different people. There's so many different parts of like a good pipeline
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_00: in terms of like where do you bring in LLMs? How do you improve them? Like how does it fit within a
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_00: general workflow? It's not just bringing in the OpenAI API and like using it within the text box
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_00: or something. It's actually extremely nuanced and complex to build an exceptional AI product and
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_00: one that's going to outshine the labs applications themselves. So I still think it's technology. It might
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_00: just be different in terms of like maybe it's not a tech mode in terms of having like a unique
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_00: database that no one's ever built before that's more efficient for X, Y and Z use cases. But it's
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_00: really a talent scarcity and like a talent tech mode where there's just not that many people
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_00: that know how to build these products and build off of these models in a super intelligent
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_00: tasteful way. Which is why you're also seeing people go for a billion dollar contracts and
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_00: make a LeBron money as an AI researcher. How do you bench-mort think about that?
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_01: I struggled with this one too. I mean my fund is 400 million. I believe it's 500 to 600.
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: It's always kind of you guys never really announced funds in the way that most people do because
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_01: it's probably mostly just your money at this stage. But my question to you is like when you see like
[00:32:37] SPEAKER_01: I don't mean to pick on them but like a mirror morality or a periodic labs, great and very
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_01: talented people. But these are 300 million rounds, two billion dollar rounds. Do you just accept
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_01: that is not a world that you play in? It kind of gets to the question that I think some people
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_00: have. I don't think you've had it here. You've been very kind to us. But I think some people
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_00: have asked the question, did benchmark miss AI? Did benchmark not get in on the AI wave because
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_00: they're not in one of the labs or they weren't in mirrors. They weren't in thinking machines or any
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_00: of these investments. And I'm a big believer in Conway's Law. Conway's Law is this programming
[00:33:11] SPEAKER_00: concept that when it's super dumb down for people like us Harry says you ship your org chart
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_00: or the product you ship looks like your organizational structure. I'm a huge believer in that
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_00: for venture capital firms as well. I think you ship your fund size or you invest your fund size
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_00: in your team structure. So if you have a seven billion dollar fund and you have 50 people,
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_00: you definitively need to get in on these mega rounds. It is the only way that you can put a billion
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_00: dollars of capital that work productively in a single shot. And if you don't and it ends up being
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_00: successful, you are now left in the dust where all of your mega you know your mega fund brethren
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_00: got those returns. And now your benchmark poorly against them because you missed one of those
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_00: things. For a firm like benchmark, it might not make any sense at all to invest in a five billion
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_00: dollar financing in a lab. Even though those are good investments because of our fund structure
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_00: and because of our lean size. But our lean size and our smaller fund size also allows us to do
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_00: other things that we think could even generate better returns. So out of our last fund,
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_00: our five best investments in that last fund today held at LRP last round price are about a 60X.
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_00: We have two 30Xs and we have two 20Xs. Since Chatchee BT was released, there isn't an opening eye round
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_00: that touches that return multiple and that money on money multiple. And we have five of them.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_00: And each of them I think have a fair amount of upside even from here today or maybe a lot of
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_00: upside even here from from today. So like you I think you have to kind of choose the game that
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_00: you're going to play and it's based on how big your fund is and how many people you're you have on
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_00: your investment team. But I think there's so many different ways that we can play the game and
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_00: generate maybe even better money on money returns than folks that are investing in the labs even
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_00: though I do think the labs have obviously been amazing investments. Your fund size dictates the
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_01: problem that you're solving for. And I think when you said that about missing the open AI at 30,
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_01: transparently what I thought was that's what like a 15X on a blunt multiple to where it is today.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_01: But with dilution. Okay, let's say 14. I said 12X but with actual dilution, you're looking
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_01: more like a 6 to 8X which don't get me wrong is fantastic. But when you do a comparison to
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_01: your Ligora's to your Langex to your Ciaris to your McCourse to your Firework to I mean like
[00:35:36] we're focused on cash on cash. 100% and again I think it like the lab investments are amazing as
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_00: well but I think again where our job is to if we're going to stay small the only way we're going to
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_00: impress LPs is by having incredible cash on cash returns. Do you worry you need them to stay
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_01: relevant? I agree with you on LPs, I grow on cash on cash but just relevancy with founders and
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_01: with community. Do you worry that you need them to stay relevant? I think it's a question that we
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_00: need to constantly be asking ourselves and I think if we ever find that our network access,
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_00: the close relationships we have and the people we have access to is slipping or we're not getting
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_00: access to the right people or the right network nodes. I think it's something that we always need
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_00: to be sharp on and revisiting but I think if you think about kind of like the cultural touch
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_00: stone founders of today's AI era, is there anyone more than Brett Taylor who represents this wave
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_00: of AI applications? He's like the godfather of AI apps right now and when you think about these
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_00: really cracked young teams in AI, who do people look up to more than Brendan at Mccorp and what
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_00: they've done on the AI infrastructure side? So at least as far even with our strategy, even with
[00:36:52] SPEAKER_00: the trade-offs that we can invest in every single good round, we've still been able to attract
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_00: and partner with and I think build really great relationships with a lot of the founders that
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_00: people look up to in the AI wave and I think our network this far has been exceptional but I do
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_00: think it's an ongoing question because if all there is left is these billion dollar raises
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: in order to like build relationships with these people then that's an ongoing question.
[00:37:18] Well if that happens then all of us will either work for the North Korean Army or for
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_01: Andrison Horowitz, one of the other. They're one in the same to me, Harry. They're one in the same
[00:37:33] Mark and Ben, he said it. You said the word slip and then you said about Mccorp. Now I'm in
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_01: Mccorp a little bit after you guys, sadly, but I did see the article which said about the ownership
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_01: that benchmark had in Mccorp being obviously much less than the traditional and I think it was about
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_01: 10% give or take. I'm not asking specifics about company. I'm just intrigued. How do you think
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_01: about discipline around ownership in a new AI world where everyone's is trending down?
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_01: When I think about benchmarks North stars, like what we really care about in our investment
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_00: strategy and this relates to the ownership that we get in our investments or everyone else gets
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_00: in their investments, we have two North stars related we think about. We want to be the highest ROI
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_00: and closest partner to the founders that we partner with. We want to be their most meaningful VC
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_00: and partner that they have from the moment that we partner with them until the company no longer
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_00: exists. Like it can go public. We're still beyond the board, but you know until the company no longer
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_00: is a going concern and we want to generate the highest money on money returns that any of our
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_00: LPs have in their venture portfolio. But that's basically it. And so I think as the asset class
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_00: evolves, there are ways to really serve those two North stars without having to necessarily get
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_00: 20% ownership or around there every single time. And I think as we're all believers, I think you're
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_00: a believer, we're certainly a believer that the outcomes are much much much larger in today's
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_00: in today's technology landscape than they were 10 years ago, 15 years ago. There's more bites at
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_00: you know, potential $100 billion trillion dollar companies. There's just so many bites at the
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_00: apple in terms of how you can both be a really meaningful partner to the founders and to
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_00: generate really, really exceptional returns. So in the more core case, yes, we didn't get you know
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_00: high teens or 20% ownership, but I think if you talk to the more core folks and who they're most
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_00: impactful VC partners been, I think they would say benchmark. And I think that's going to generate
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: unbelievable returns for LPs. And it's one of those ones that's, you know, you can do the math
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_00: on what the money and money return has been thus far from our ownership stake. And so I think
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_00: sometimes people confuse the inputs for the outputs at benchmark where it's like, oh, like they have
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_00: to have 20% ownership and they only want to invest at 100 posts and all these things. And I think
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_00: that's that couldn't be further from the truth. We really have those two North stars. And whatever
[00:40:04] SPEAKER_00: the asset class allows for in terms of the relationships that we build and how we can deliver the
[00:40:08] SPEAKER_00: best for LPs and our founders, that is that is what we're serving to. And that's what we're
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_00: optimizing for, not some vanilla percentage ownership number. Ironically, I think the last thing I'd
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_00: say on that is like, ironically, I think if you pulled any of our founders and said, you know,
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_00: do you regret the amount that the percentage ownership that you gave to benchmark? I don't think
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_00: you'd get a single one of them to say, no, we gave benchmark too much. And I think that's one of
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_00: the really special things about the history of the partnership. It's my third week. So obviously,
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_00: I've contributed nothing to that. I'm just speaking to the amazing work that that all of our
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_00: current and historical GPs have done for the platform. But I also do think that even when we get,
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_00: you know, and we still often do get really high ownership stakes, I don't think a single founder
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_00: regrets that regrets that partnership. Evan, it seems despite many years in venture, you still
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_01: need a lesson from me, which is regardless of what you did, it was all credit to you for the brilliance
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_01: that happened. It was me. Yeah, I remember doing eBay back in the day. Me and Pierre, we were
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_01: hanging. We basically co-founded the business together. So good. Yeah, I mean, yeah, do you need to work
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_00: on that? You said about, we can take this out if you want to. I pry and you can take out. One of your
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_01: old partners, Deleon, is quite vocal about benchmark. I mean, it's kind of the popcorn gift, you know.
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_01: It is. And you say about being best partner. I think if you can answer it, it's helpful,
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_01: because the Adalienz doesn't help. He says, well, you just fire founders continuously. Is that not
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_01: slightly incongruous being the firm that fires founders and also your best partner? I'll start with
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_00: Deleon's media strategy. Deleon, and you know, love Deleon. He's a close buddy of mine. So I hope he
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_00: doesn't, I don't think he'll mind me saying this because he certainly busts my balls more than
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_00: enough. Deleon has always found an amazing kind of media and Twitter strategy, which is go find,
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_00: someone with like, you know, a stalwart brand or like go find the biggest person on the playground
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_00: and go punch him in the face. And people love it and it gets a lot of likes and it gets a lot of
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_00: clicks. And it helps raise your kind of profile. And it almost like elevates you to their positioning.
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_00: He's in it to Sequoia, an immense amount. He's in it to Andreessen over the years. And we have not
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_00: been spared the clickbait Deleon tweets either. No, I think, I mean, obviously, like every,
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_00: every story has an immense amount of nuance. And what happens between a board and a founder
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_00: and a management team, there's just an immense amount that goes into every single one of those
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_00: decisions. And again, like, I think, you know, times also completely change. Like in the 90s and
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_00: early on, you know, like if you think about, like if you read about or hear about the Google
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_00: investment, it's like, you know, Clientern Sequoia do the Google investment and immediately start
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_00: searching for a professional CEO. And so it like, it used to be like, it used to be the absolute
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_00: norm that it's like, it's not even like, oh, we're going to push the founders out. It's like, no,
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_00: you invest. And then you altogether go look to recruit a CEO. I think 2025 is immensely different
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_00: than 2000. It's immensely different than 2010. It's even immensely different than 2015. And just
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_00: the relationship between boards and founders have changed the relationships between venture firms
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_00: and management teams and companies have changed a lot. I think it's for the better. Obviously,
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_00: I spent a fair amount of time of my career at founders fund. I love the idea of never firing
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_00: founders and, and, you know, having them lead their companies from the moment you partner
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_00: until the IPO and beyond. But at the end of the day, there also, like, I also am a believer in,
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_00: like, basic governance. Like I'm also a believer in, like if you do end up investing in someone who
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_00: breaks the law or someone that's, you know, crossed ethical lines, it is your responsibility
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_00: as a board member to also potentially take remediations and action on behalf of all of the shareholders,
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_00: all of the employees and the company. Like if you take a board seat like we do and you do have
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_00: governance, you ultimately do have at least basic ethical and moral responsibilities. And I think
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_00: it's actually a, a convenience for Dellian and some of the founders fund folks to absolve themselves
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_00: of that weight and that responsibility just by being like, oh, it's not part of our, it's not
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_00: part of our thing. But I think, you know, it's almost out of laziness sometimes more than it is,
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_00: you know, some, some, you know, duty that they find to founders.
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_01: I, I, you know, you said you give me some bangers. I also, you know, give myself spicy ones,
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_01: but I think we're actually too kind on the flip side where we now do not adhere to our
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_01: fiduciary responsibility because we do not want to lose NPS so much. I'm on a company now.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_01: I'm invested in where the board is deliberately obfuscating their fiduciary responsibility
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_01: just to preserve found NPS in case they say something bad. They are not looking after the cap table
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: just because they do not want to piss the CEO off. That is a deliberate obfuscation from your
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_01: responsibilities of protecting shareholders and doing what's best for them. 100%. I completely agree.
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_00: And I also think the best founders, they don't want sick of fans in the boardroom. Like, they don't
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_00: want GPT 40 in the boardroom telling them that everything that they do, they walk on water,
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_00: and that they do nothing wrong. Like they actually want other adults in the room that are going to
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_00: push them, that are going to spar with them, and that are going to make the company better. Can I
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_00: say, have you said about kind of multiple bites at the Apple? I wrote down Apple bites.
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_01: When we look at benchmark over the years, you know, Phantom did air table series C. I think
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_01: Gecko was series C. Langchain was a seed. To what extent will you push the partnership now
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_01: to expand the boundaries of what we call an A and what benchmark does to do more broad
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_01: bites at the cherry or Apple? Yeah, I think historically, again, going back to those
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_00: Norstars that we talk about, I think when you think about the benchmark investment strategy,
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_00: it's helpful to marry the Norstars that we talked about in terms of every investment needs to be
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_00: potentially absolutely astronomical money on money returns for LPs, and we want to be the most
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_00: meaningful partner to our founders. There's a lot of different ways to do that, and so I think you
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_00: marry those Norstars with the personal investing style of each of the GPs. Like each of us is 25%
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_00: of benchmark, and we work really well together and we're a super tight-knit team, but each of us has
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_00: our own styles. And so even if Eric tends to love getting in right at inception and be the first
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_00: check-in and be, you know, really, really in the kind of like primordial soup phase of a startup,
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_00: it doesn't mean that myself or Chethan or Peter are always going to operate exactly at that stage.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_00: We all have our particular preferences. I think Peter does an amazing job of just like following
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_00: his founder conviction, and he doesn't think about stages. Like when he finds a how he, when he finds
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_00: a Brett, when he finds any of these founders, that is what he lets him, that's what guides him,
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_00: and he's like, I'm going to find a way to become the most meaningful partner to this founder,
[00:47:15] SPEAKER_00: and I'm going to find a way for the investment to make them a lot of money for LPs.
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_00: And so I think that is the mindset that we all have, and historically I've done more growth,
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_00: like I focus more on series being beyond than I focused on early stage. So will I do more
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_00: kind of series A, B or whatever we call it these days? Then inception seed investing, especially
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_00: at first, probably. But again, we're guided by those North stars and finding founders that we
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_00: really resonate with. And then typically we're able to find ways to make it work on the back end,
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_00: and for our investments to generate exceptional returns and all those things. So I think, unlike,
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_00: you know, a huge mega fund that is like we have our series A partners, we have our series B partners,
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_00: we have our series C partners, they do Fintech, they do healthcare, they do blah-blah.
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_00: Like we don't think about those things at all. We really just think about our North stars,
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_00: and I think we're realizing more and more that there's just so many different ways that you can
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_00: have 10X, 20X, 30X returns. I spoke to one of your former colleagues and they said, you know,
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_01: have is a phenomenal growth investor, but he's a growth investor. And when I think about what
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_01: matters at different stages, you know, for me in the early stages, it's people. And in the later
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_01: stages, it's market actually sizing depth and just how big something can be. We recently did
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_01: our wallets late at four billion. Incredible. Incredible. But why? Because like, dude,
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_01: fucking B2B payments, like, you know, it's a big market. We've got a lot more room to run.
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_01: How do you think about that shift earlier? Are you nervous about making it? And what changes
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_01: in what matters in your mind? Yeah. I'll be vulnerable with you, Harry, and say that this was
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_00: when I was talking, this was a dinner I was having with Eric, the Sri Anor team.
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_00: And I was having a moment of insecurity when I was talking to him about just the role of being a
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_00: GP of benchmark and saying, like, hey, you know, like I've mostly done growth. And he was like, dude,
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_00: like Bill Gurley was a public market analyst before he came to benchmark. Like, you certainly
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_00: are not going to be the most, you know, the most off the wall higher that benchmark is made.
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_00: That's actually more part for the course for benchmark. And I think also when you look at like,
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_00: who do you think are the amazing investors today? I think they transcend stage. Like, if you look
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: at Pat Grady, does Pat Grady think of himself as a growth investor or is Pat Grady think of himself
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_00: as just an amazing investor? Or maybe he's too humble. He's a pretty humble guy. So maybe he doesn't
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_00: think about himself as an amazing investor at all. But I look at what Pat does. And unlike he finds
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_00: incredible founders in investments that he thinks have an immense amount of upside. And he goes
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_00: and partners with those founders. And so I wouldn't say that I'm an amazing investor yet. I don't have
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_00: the track record yet to say that I am. But like, that is my north star. And that is my goal.
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to work my ass off to do that where I'm just going to find. I think I've been able to
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: kind of like tune my intuition. And even though I've used it to execute on growth stage investing,
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_00: I think if you look at a lot of even the people that we think are growth stage investor, they're doing
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_00: earlier stage companies now and doing a lot of different stages at the same time.
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_00: I thought Pat just did the deals his wife did.
[00:50:20] I'm just kidding. Harvey was. He said it. He said it. He said it.
[00:50:27] Dude, I've known him for 10 years. I've said this. Yeah, you can get away with it.
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_01: I've said it for years. And this is why I think he's just like, I've never met Harry.
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_01: Don't know who this guy is. No idea. I think that does change obviously his price. And it does
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_01: matter at different stages. How do you think about your own relationship to price?
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_01: I think almost by starting my career as a growth investor, it actually really helps me.
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_00: So one of the first investment that I did at Clienter Perkins when I came back in 2022 was SpaceX
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_00: at $150 billion. And at the time, it's like, oh my god, like $150 billion entry price,
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_00: absolute numbers, can we really make a good return on this investment? And having to go through
[00:51:11] SPEAKER_00: the process of saying, hey, let's not focus on just some large absolute figure. Like, let's look
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_00: at the Tam. Let's look at their competitive position in their market. Let's look at what happens
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_00: if this goes right. And let's look at the probability of it going right. And who could potentially
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_00: knock them off their perch to make a knock go right. And when you actually zoomed back and said,
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_00: hey, let's just like take a few zeros off of every single number of the Tam, the valuation,
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_00: the revenue, everything. If you were to like, look at it as a vanilla widget code and just reduce,
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_00: like, you know, two orders of magnitude off of every number, you'd be like, this is an absolute
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_00: no brainer investment with a 10x upside case. So I think like doing, doing later stage investing
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_00: can actually really help you think about price even at the earlier stage because it really makes
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_00: you think about, okay, like I'm going to ignore what feels like a large entry price relative to
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_00: market. Like if you're in a, like if you're in a market where everyone's like, oh, the series A
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_00: markets 100 post. And like if you do something at 200 posts, you're an idiot because that's like
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_00: two x more expensive, then you miss rippling it 250. You know, the famous series A that
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_00: I'm on did where everyone's like, this guy's out of his mind. He just paid 250 for a series A company
[00:52:19] SPEAKER_00: that barely has any revenue. And obviously you miss Parker's excellence. You miss the Tam that he's
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_00: going after. You miss the product sequencing, the differentiation that he's going to build. And you
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_00: miss the, the exceptional team that he had built. And so I think if you can always try to isolate,
[00:52:32] SPEAKER_00: like, hey, I'm not going to care about what's going on in the market. I'm going to care about
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_00: what matters for an investment and how much upside I think there is in a vacuum. I think,
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_00: I think that matters a lot more. And it's something that you can actually get if you start your
[00:52:42] SPEAKER_00: career and growth. Do you remember when Andrew Reed did Figma? And they were like four four
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_01: million an hour on he did it at 400 and everyone was like, this guy is create 100 x what nuts.
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_01: Now I'm one of the first 100 x deals, I think in SAS. And people are like 100 x ARR with the hell.
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_00: And obviously it ended up being, you know, I don't know, 30 40 x unbelievable investment.
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_00: Do you out come scenario planning? Because you said they're about market analysis and trying to do
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_01: top down. This bottoms up. How do you think about that? And do you not worry that it can mislead you
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_01: in the wrong direction? This is a lesson I think I learned from Mary mostly. And it's one of my most
[00:53:20] SPEAKER_00: important frameworks. And that is you should understand what the, what the, the like base case or like
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_00: the base rate future of the company looks like. So if you are like an equity analyst and this was
[00:53:34] SPEAKER_00: your hundredth company that you were doing like a little forward model for and you weren't paying that
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_00: much attention. And you're just like, okay, just triple tripled. So it's going to double double,
[00:53:41] SPEAKER_00: double or like whatever. If you just said like, hey, this is what the market thinks is sort of like
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_00: the baseline of what this company should do. It's actually extremely helpful to lay that all out
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_00: and visualize that. So I don't say like, oh, this is the bowl case. This is the base case. And this is
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_00: the bear case. But I lay out like what is like what are people underwriting to? Because you know,
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_00: let's say at the growth stage, people are underwriting to like a three to five x. What does that look like on
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_00: paper? And then how does that jive with my mental framing of how important this company is going to be
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_00: for its customers, for its market for the US economy in some cases? And I think when you, when you,
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_00: when you have a really, really strong intuition about a company in the middle of an inflection that's
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_00: about to absolutely explode, you look at the numbers that people are underwriting to to get to their
[00:54:24] SPEAKER_00: three to five x. And you say, this company is going to absolutely smoke these projections. It happens
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_00: very rarely, but it's really, really nice because it really gives you the amount of conviction when
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_00: you look and say, oh, this is just like everyone's going to underestimate this thing. And I think the
[00:54:38] SPEAKER_00: other reason why models are not useful beyond that simple framing is that every successful investment,
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_00: you just feel like if you were to model figmas growth, you know, everyone would make fun of you.
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_00: You'd be like, dude, come on, like you're just trying to get this deal done. You know, why would you
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_00: model it growing for this fast for this long? This profitably, like it's never happened in SaaS,
[00:54:56] SPEAKER_00: like you're crazy, or you're just like doing the ICA to service. And so I think beyond being like a
[00:55:01] SPEAKER_00: yardstick to test your conviction, models aren't that useful, but for that, they're really, really good.
[00:55:07] I always remember Ernie from Carvon coming on and being like the amount of investors that would be
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_01: like, hmm, the biggest car showroom is like 300 million dollars market cap. So like this is a bad
[00:55:17] SPEAKER_01: business. And I always think like market comps is such a dangerous one to rotate your mind around
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_01: when investing 100% or you know, figma with designers. And I think David George maybe it was on
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_00: this show or another, you know, talked about how he, you know, under misunderstood and understated the
[00:55:33] SPEAKER_00: tam a figma because he was, you know, he went back to the team and said, well, look at how many
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_00: designers there are in the world. If you just do the P times Q, the price time the quantity of designers,
[00:55:41] SPEAKER_00: you don't get that big of a business. And obviously, figma then ended up penetrating a lot more
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_00: different roles within a company beyond designers. People product market rank one, three, three,
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_01: and order of priority fee. The way you said it, honestly, people product and market. I think the
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_00: people define everything else. They are the upstream engine that makes everything go. They're the
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_00: most important piece to I think the product that the people build tell you a lot about, just tell
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_00: you so much about also the people like it's, it's the greatest evidence of the quality of the people
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_00: is the product that they build. And then market third, obviously, I am a believer that like the market
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_00: you're in, ends up defining the size and then the founder, you know, determines how, how, like,
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_00: what percent of that size you can, you can get in your exit. But I just think it's the most fungible.
[00:56:34] SPEAKER_00: Like I don't think you can turn a non exceptional person into an exceptional person. I don't think you
[00:56:38] SPEAKER_00: can take a team that can't build a good product and make them a team that can build a good product.
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_00: But you can change markets, especially early on in a company's life. Like most of the amazing
[00:56:48] SPEAKER_00: companies and exit stories had some pivot along the road, whether you're talking about slack or
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_00: any of these others. And so I truly think that because it's the most fungible, market is the
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_00: least important of those three things. You said that the change of markets, it was on this show where
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_01: Buglioni said, venture capital has transitioned from a high margin boutique community to a low margin
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_01: commoditized industry. Tears ran down my face with my $400 million fund, which seemed quite poultry.
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_01: Do you agree with him in that statement? You know, I think Doug might have gotten that idea from me.
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_00: And I'm half kidding. But I wrote this piece back in 2021. I think it's the reason why we first
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_00: DMed it was called playing different games. And ostensibly the piece was about the rise of Tiger.
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_00: But what the piece was really about was the rise of a firm level strategy that surrounded itself
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_00: around increasing investment velocity as the core strategy. And so the idea being that you could
[00:57:54] SPEAKER_00: make more money as a firm and as a GP if you invested a lot more money per year, even if you
[00:58:00] SPEAKER_00: thought the forward returns were going to be lower on average per investment. And the idea was
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_00: like Tiger was really the first one to take this idea and really, really run with it. And make it,
[00:58:11] SPEAKER_00: you know, they raised $15 billion or whatever they did in 2021. John Curtis basically deployed it
[00:58:15] SPEAKER_00: all over that 18 month period. And at the very bottom, this is the ironic part of that piece.
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_00: At the very bottom, I said venture capital is going to bifurcate. And on one end, you're going to
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_00: have the Tiger model, which is high capital velocity, a lot of money out of the door every single year.
[00:58:33] SPEAKER_00: Low touch, good prices, like giving, giving founders really good prices. And on the other end,
[00:58:38] SPEAKER_00: who did I have? I had benchmark ironically. And like that is going to be like the craft that is
[00:58:42] SPEAKER_00: going to be high touch. It's going to be the best signal that you can get if you're a founder. And
[00:58:47] SPEAKER_00: they're going to be very, very involved. And then in the middle, I was like, we have the JC Penny funds,
[00:58:50] SPEAKER_00: which is like the dead zone. And I think like the crazy thing to me is like, what happened over
[00:58:55] SPEAKER_00: the last four years, Harry? How many firms have moved towards the Tiger, Tiger side of the spectrum?
[00:59:00] SPEAKER_00: Like Tiger died. And we got six or seven more tigers out of like in the last four years.
[00:59:06] SPEAKER_00: And obviously a lot of these firms are running different strategies, you know,
[00:59:09] SPEAKER_00: Thrive and Founders Fund doing extremely concentrated investments and really high quality companies.
[00:59:13] SPEAKER_00: You have the mega funds like light speed and GC doing their thing. It's a lot of different,
[00:59:17] SPEAKER_00: you know, flavors of capital velocity as a North Star. But there are six to eight firms now doing,
[00:59:24] SPEAKER_00: you know, capital velocity, investment velocity as their North Star. And that was one of the reasons
[00:59:29] SPEAKER_00: why I was really confident in high conviction and joining benchmark. Because if you look, how many
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_00: of those tier one brands have moved more towards the benchmark side of the scale? There's basically none.
[00:59:37] SPEAKER_00: Can I just push you? Do you think the other capital velocity is their North Star? I mean,
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_01: I think Josh would audently push back on that from Thrive. And I don't even think you could apply
[00:59:48] SPEAKER_01: it to light speed and GC. I think they're solving for large checks, which is why they have to be in
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_01: these mega companies because they need to deploy 500 million in some cases. But I don't feel like
[00:59:59] SPEAKER_01: that's solving for velocity in the same way that Tiger. And do you argue back? I do. I would push back.
[01:00:05] SPEAKER_00: Well, there's two things. So I think obviously there's there's different like sub segments of this now.
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_00: So, so like, let's take the actual mega fund. The people that I think are most following this,
[01:00:15] SPEAKER_00: this strategy. If you were to say, well, are GC or light speed or some of these mega funds is the
[01:00:20] SPEAKER_00: strategy investment velocity as a North Star? To answer that question, I would have you go talk to
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_00: the principles, the junior partners and the associates at those firms. You interview 10 of those
[01:00:32] SPEAKER_00: people and you tell me that capital velocity is not the North Star of those firms. And I will see
[01:00:38] SPEAKER_00: victory to you, Harry. I think when you actually look at what's going on at the ground floor, it
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_00: doesn't matter what Robby Herman was saying. When you actually look at what's going on,
[01:00:46] SPEAKER_00: after people actually going and doing these investments, they feel it. They feel that they need
[01:00:50] SPEAKER_00: to get money out that door. And that's the only way that they're getting promoted up those organizations.
[01:00:55] SPEAKER_00: So, I think it's very, very real. On the thrive side, I agree with you. I think that Josh would
[01:00:59] SPEAKER_00: resent that characterization. And it was probably too blunt of a characterization. But again, I think
[01:01:04] SPEAKER_00: subconsciously still is a firm. It's very, very hard to care about. It's hard to care about
[01:01:11] SPEAKER_00: something that's not your main product. And when you're writing billion dollar checks,
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_00: that is your main product. That's what's going to make you all the money. And so if you put
[01:01:20] SPEAKER_00: $3 billion in OpenAI, and it's going to turn into $12 billion, it just so consciously, whether it's
[01:01:25] SPEAKER_00: conscious or not, it is unbelievably hard to then go and be like, we're also going to be the best
[01:01:30] SPEAKER_00: series a firm. And we care just as much about series A. Because why would you? Because 99,
[01:01:34] SPEAKER_00: or not like 95% of the profit that you're going to make in the money in your pocket is going to come
[01:01:39] SPEAKER_00: from the billion dollars you put in Databricks or the $3 billion you put in OpenAI, or any of those
[01:01:43] SPEAKER_00: things that have ended up being your main product. So I think you just can't focus on everything and
[01:01:47] SPEAKER_00: give it all you're all. And I think so even though it's less conscious for those firms like
[01:01:51] SPEAKER_00: Founders Run Thrive, it has become their main product and their main focus consciously.
[01:01:54] SPEAKER_00: If we accept that, people then often move to the, and they're going to do worse, ha ha ha,
[01:02:00] SPEAKER_01: like we accept a lower rate of return because they have the Norwegian tree pension fund.
[01:02:06] SPEAKER_01: Once four percent a year and so that's what they're going for. And then you actually look at
[01:02:10] SPEAKER_01: outcome scenarios and outcome sizes of OpenAI, which will be a trillion dollar company that
[01:02:17] SPEAKER_01: and drop it, which will definitely be a 600, 700 billion dollar company. So which hits 100,
[01:02:23] SPEAKER_01: you know, a billion in error insanely fast. And outcomes are so much larger than we ever anticipated.
[01:02:31] I think they will make a huge amount of money because the outcome sizes have continuously expanded.
[01:02:38] Do you agree? Oh yeah, they're all going to make an immense amount of money. But again,
[01:02:43] SPEAKER_00: let's change the framework from absolute dollars to what you're giving each stakeholder
[01:02:49] SPEAKER_00: of the three legs of the venture stool. So venture has three stakeholders. You have your LPs,
[01:02:54] SPEAKER_00: you have your Founders, and you have each other as GPs within a firm. I don't think as, as
[01:03:00] SPEAKER_00: Ravya Hamant or even Ben and Mark at this point, I don't think that they can go to LPs,
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_00: one of those legs of the stool and say, hey, this, this basket of funds that we're making you
[01:03:10] SPEAKER_00: invest party pursue across, we're going to get you five Xnet on that. I don't think they can say
[01:03:14] SPEAKER_00: that or they at least can't say that with a straight face. And if you look at the recent return data,
[01:03:18] SPEAKER_00: I think it suggests that. So I think they'll be able to make an immense amount of money on an absolute
[01:03:23] SPEAKER_00: basis. But I think a lot of these LPs are in the business to make or inventor to make high money
[01:03:28] SPEAKER_00: on money returns. Like they have PE for the low return stuff and they probably get better liquidity
[01:03:32] SPEAKER_00: from PE. They're here for the high money on money returns. And this is one of the reasons why
[01:03:36] SPEAKER_00: I'm extremely excited about benchmarks, competitive position in today's market. Because we can go to
[01:03:41] SPEAKER_00: LPs, we can say, hey, we're shooting for higher five than five Xnet. We have the historical track record
[01:03:46] SPEAKER_00: to back it up and we have the fund sizes to back it up as well. I mean, you had miles from Carnegie
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_00: Melon come on here and do the awesome math and the very clear math of, hey, do you know how hard it is
[01:03:55] SPEAKER_00: to return 4Xnet on $8 billion, $10 billion. It is immensely hard and it's, it like defies the laws
[01:04:02] SPEAKER_00: of physics. So I think there's a difference between, are they going to make a ton of money and are
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_00: they going to produce the returns that LPs really want this asset class to produce to very, very
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_00: different things. But for now, like the rubber, like the rubber won't meet the road because as you
[01:04:15] SPEAKER_00: mentioned, there's just so much global demand from LPs for exposure to private technology. And they
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_00: are happy to take lower returns. And so I don't think there's any end in sight. But I think on a
[01:04:25] SPEAKER_00: relative basis between all of these different constituents and all these different GPs, there's a huge,
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_00: huge delta and a huge differentiation between who can actually produce venture-like returns.
[01:04:33] SPEAKER_00: Tiger. I think Tiger will do much better than anyone anticipated when you look at their positions
[01:04:40] SPEAKER_01: in scale, open AI, and the protection that they're going to get from a load of lick breaths that
[01:04:45] SPEAKER_01: they do actually have meaning a lot of them will get 1X plus a little bit maybe. Do you think I'm
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_01: wrong in being too optimistic? Or do you think actually the whole ecosystem should on them a
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_01: little bit too early? I completely agree. I think Tiger's going to end up much better than anyone
[01:05:01] SPEAKER_00: thought they were going to end up. I jokingly texted some of my friends and I was like,
[01:05:06] SPEAKER_00: hashtag justice for John Curtis. I actually think everyone put him as this pariah of the personification
[01:05:15] SPEAKER_00: of the excesses of 2021. But again, it might have proven, his strategy might have proven
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_00: prudent and the correct strategy all along because they got really big stakes in Databricks.
[01:05:27] SPEAKER_00: They invested in open AI very, very early. I think they have a large position in open AI.
[01:05:31] SPEAKER_00: They actually have large positions in a lot of these amazing companies that could continue to
[01:05:35] SPEAKER_00: compound 5X more. Again, they'll probably benefit from the liquidation preferences and the beauty
[01:05:41] SPEAKER_00: of having preferred stock for a lot of the things that don't work. In the fullness of time,
[01:05:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure it's not going to be the best portfolio that any LPs ever gotten, but I definitely don't
[01:05:51] SPEAKER_00: think it's going to be a money incinerating fund by any means. I actually think it might end up
[01:05:56] SPEAKER_00: being pretty okay if one Databricks is a $400-$500 billion company and opening
[01:06:01] SPEAKER_00: AI as a multitrally-dollar company. It is hilarious. I do think people gave them too much of a
[01:06:08] SPEAKER_00: hard time probably. I do think they might end up being okay. I love that hashtag. I'm sure
[01:06:15] SPEAKER_01: John will listen to this and be like, yes. Thanks guys. When we were chatting about multi-stage funds
[01:06:22] SPEAKER_01: before and going back and forth on email, you said about how it sucks to be in a mega fund.
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_01: Why does it suck to be in a mega fund, Ev? Because from the outside, it looks
[01:06:32] SPEAKER_01: from like building a firm. The idea of having mega fees, mega offices,
[01:06:38] SPEAKER_01: Fiji water in unlimited supply and more EA's than you have investors. It seems pretty good.
[01:06:46] SPEAKER_01: Can you help me out, Heddy?
[01:06:49] SPEAKER_00: Maybe I should caveat by saying all on a relative basis, these people definitely aren't going
[01:06:54] SPEAKER_00: to the coal mines and laboring all day under the hot sun or something. I know I have so many
[01:07:02] SPEAKER_00: friends at these funds and some of them are probably going to kill me for this part of the conversation.
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_00: But something that I always tell, I've mentored a lot of people that are either coming out of
[01:07:11] SPEAKER_00: private equity or thinking about moving firms in venture growth. One of the first things I say
[01:07:16] SPEAKER_00: to them, I just think about the day to day that I know exists in a lot of these mega funds. If you
[01:07:22] SPEAKER_00: think about it, if there's 50 investors, if you come in and you're the 23rd partner at, I don't
[01:07:29] SPEAKER_00: know, like iconic or one of these places, what companies do you get to cover? That's the first
[01:07:35] SPEAKER_00: problem. You end up getting a very small sliver of the overall market because so many people
[01:07:41] SPEAKER_00: have already laid claim and are the point person on the very best companies with the very best
[01:07:46] SPEAKER_00: founders. You end up being focused on this local maxima where you're like, okay, I have 30 pretty
[01:07:52] SPEAKER_00: good companies that I am the point person on the relationship. I also really need to do investments
[01:07:56] SPEAKER_00: because that's how people get promoted here. I really need to get a couple of these in the portfolio.
[01:08:01] SPEAKER_00: And to me, sometimes it just feels like a little bit of like, it just feels like a different job
[01:08:05] SPEAKER_00: than the craft of venture capital where you're almost playing the lottery where you're like, okay,
[01:08:09] SPEAKER_00: these 30 names that I own, I'm going to try to do two of them. And then if one of them hits and
[01:08:13] SPEAKER_00: is a huge success, then I'm going to get like tenure and I'll get to be a GP and then I'll get more
[01:08:19] SPEAKER_00: coverage and then everything will be okay. But there's just something that's like not, you know,
[01:08:23] SPEAKER_00: it feels almost like a little bit more like investment banking or like a large private equity firm
[01:08:29] SPEAKER_00: than it does. What people think of when they think of like being in a venture capital firm,
[01:08:32] SPEAKER_00: which is like, meet really interesting, you know, founders build genuine relationships with them
[01:08:37] SPEAKER_00: and only do the very, very best investments in partnerships. And I just think it's really
[01:08:41] SPEAKER_00: gotten away with that. And I think it's inevitable. And it's again, like to that Conway's law
[01:08:45] SPEAKER_00: point of venture capital firms, it's just based on the fun sizes and the team structures of these places.
[01:08:51] I agree. And if they get fed up of the private chefs and the ace ups open the bathrooms,
[01:08:56] SPEAKER_01: then they can always go and, you know, put their own fund in the toilet away and do the painful hard
[01:09:03] SPEAKER_01: yards in which case I wish them well. Exactly. I have to say I do agree with you there. I do
[01:09:08] SPEAKER_01: have to ask you, you mentioned that about kind of doing those two deals out of the 30.
[01:09:12] SPEAKER_01: The first deal is really hard, dude. How do you think about your first deal at benchmark? You
[01:09:17] SPEAKER_01: can fall on two sides. Just get it out. You know, it may not be your best, but it's kind of like,
[01:09:24] SPEAKER_01: you know, the first shack. Just get it done. You promised me spacey hairy and you delivered.
[01:09:32] SPEAKER_00: You delivered. Or it's like, you know what? I'm going to wait until I find the perfect company.
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_01: And only when I find the perfect company, am I going to commit to it? Which side do you sit on?
[01:09:46] Yeah, my first investment. I mean, I won't lie to you, Harry, the weight of being a benchmark GP
[01:09:52] SPEAKER_00: exists. Like I definitely feel it. Like it's, it's you're like, wow, like, you know, the people that
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_00: have walked these halls, Bill Gurley, Michalowski, Matt Kohler, incredible people with incredible
[01:10:01] SPEAKER_00: track records. And you feel a lot of pressure to like, live up to the history of this place and
[01:10:07] SPEAKER_00: the history of the brand. I think I got really, really good advice. I won't name the partner
[01:10:12] SPEAKER_00: just so no one can trace back to what company they're talking about. But one of the partners
[01:10:16] SPEAKER_00: coming in was like, look, there's going to be nothing better for you than if your first investment
[01:10:22] SPEAKER_00: sucks. Because once you do one and it fails and you realize it's not the end of the world. And like,
[01:10:29] SPEAKER_00: life goes on and like LP still love us and like, you're not fired, then you feel really comfortable.
[01:10:34] SPEAKER_00: And you start getting into a really, really good rhythm. Whereas like, if your first one's like
[01:10:38] SPEAKER_00: pretty good or like looks really good, you can then feel even more pressure on the second one.
[01:10:42] SPEAKER_00: So though, like, there is something beautiful in having your first BF failure. That doesn't mean
[01:10:46] SPEAKER_00: that I'm going to be looking for a failure out of my first investment. But it was really, really,
[01:10:51] SPEAKER_00: really like, like, relieving. And it was amazing advice to get that look, it's all okay. And if anything,
[01:10:57] SPEAKER_00: failing actually can help you feel more relaxed as you go up to bat the next time.
[01:11:03] Just do one of Delians then. Exactly. Yeah, I'll do like a Swedish satellite antenna company
[01:11:12] SPEAKER_00: or something that Delian did. And then I'll be guaranteed for zero.
[01:11:16] SPEAKER_00: Having said that, obviously, Daddy and I'm joking. Delian's track is pretty fucking good.
[01:11:20] SPEAKER_01: Like, you look at his thought. I mean, I don't think he gets enough credit for the investor that
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_01: he is as well. And like, sold in Portugal where you're like, really, that's a non-obvious pick.
[01:11:32] SPEAKER_01: And like, wow, what a business. Well, the thing I always give Delian crap for is that he does
[01:11:38] SPEAKER_00: have an incredible track, but a lot of it is software. And so he loves to like, he loves to
[01:11:41] SPEAKER_00: shit on software companies and people that invest in software and all these things. And I'm like,
[01:11:45] SPEAKER_00: dude, you source the seed of ramp. You like, Coastal Owns and a godly amount of
[01:11:49] SPEAKER_00: sort health, which is an amazing company. And like, yes, you obviously incubated Varda,
[01:11:53] SPEAKER_00: which is a great company as well on all these things. But I'm like, a lot of your track record is
[01:11:56] SPEAKER_00: in software. But no, I honestly, I think a lot of people at Founders Fund have very underrated
[01:12:00] SPEAKER_00: track records. I think Matthias Ventiane, I think he's the most underrated venture capitalist that
[01:12:05] SPEAKER_00: exists today. He's so quiet. He's never, you know, online, you know, boasting about himself or
[01:12:10] SPEAKER_00: anything, but Delar app, trade republic. Why? I met him when he was in London and we had dinner
[01:12:16] SPEAKER_01: and he was doing the trade republic deal then. Yeah. What, why do you say he's the most underrated?
[01:12:22] SPEAKER_01: I just don't, I don't think a lot of people know about him. Like I just don't think like,
[01:12:26] SPEAKER_00: you know, he's not online. I don't know. I think he might want to go into his name there,
[01:12:29] SPEAKER_01: trade republic. So trade republic, Delar app, which I'm sure you know, enter down in line
[01:12:35] SPEAKER_00: America. And then he's just, he's an instrumental, you know, the growth team over there is quite small.
[01:12:40] SPEAKER_00: You know, you got Napoleon, you got Matthias and you got a few other, like a mean and a few other
[01:12:43] SPEAKER_00: people. And he's just, he's just played a pretty big role in a lot of the really good growth
[01:12:49] SPEAKER_00: investments as well. So I just think like first someone who also is ostensibly a growth investor,
[01:12:53] SPEAKER_00: he's done a ton of really good early stage things. Yeah. And he's humble and nice. He's that one
[01:12:58] SPEAKER_01: of those perfect kids at school. You're like, oh, God. I don't know about nice. He's a, some people
[01:13:02] SPEAKER_00: don't think he's very nice, but he's a, he's a sweetie at heart. Ouch. Um, you know what? I
[01:13:08] SPEAKER_01: spoke to Henry from stored before. And he said, you got to ask, what's the most ridiculous story
[01:13:14] SPEAKER_01: you remember from the 2021 times? Oh my gosh. I mean, there were so many just absolutely absurd ones.
[01:13:22] SPEAKER_00: Again, I was at founders fund. So we were spending a fair amount of time in Miami. And I remember
[01:13:27] SPEAKER_00: distinctly, I think I might have been like the third Miami tech week or something. And I think it
[01:13:31] SPEAKER_00: was like December of 21 or maybe January of 22 when it was pretty clear that like the bubble was
[01:13:37] SPEAKER_00: bursting from COVID and like equity valuations were starting to get slash like 30, 40% in public
[01:13:41] SPEAKER_00: markets. And we were just doing like these, there's like, we had some like very, very decadent
[01:13:46] SPEAKER_00: party where like, I think like vanilla ice was performing or something. And like, like we're in
[01:13:52] SPEAKER_00: Miami, there's always crypto people, which is like, oh my God. And I was sitting around and I was
[01:13:55] SPEAKER_00: like, this reminds me exactly of the scene in the dark night rises where like Anne Hathaway is dancing
[01:14:00] SPEAKER_00: with, um, you know, Bruce Wayne. And they're at this like fancy party. And she's like, I don't know
[01:14:05] SPEAKER_00: how you could think that you guys could, you know, do this glamorous like decadent stuff while like
[01:14:10] SPEAKER_00: Gotham is burning. And I was like, wow, we're at that party today. I was like, we're like,
[01:14:14] SPEAKER_00: Gotham is burning like, it's about to come to us. But for this time, you know, this is like the last
[01:14:19] SPEAKER_00: decadent thing that we're going to be doing. And I just feel like 2021, there was just, it was all
[01:14:23] SPEAKER_00: like that. There was just so many just ridiculous things where I look back and it's like, why did we
[01:14:27] SPEAKER_00: ever think either one, this like investment was a good idea or two, why were we like, you know,
[01:14:31] SPEAKER_00: doing doing these like very decadent things in Miami, it just seems ridiculous and hindsight.
[01:14:35] SPEAKER_00: I am so here for a dark night reference, by the way. So I love that scene. Well,
[01:14:40] SPEAKER_01: I do love it. Finally one before we do a quick fire, which is just like, you can think that
[01:14:46] SPEAKER_01: Gotham is burning today, actually in a lot of ways when you look at the state of the world.
[01:14:51] SPEAKER_01: And you can also look and go, Christ, we're so early in the adoption and inflection of AI
[01:14:57] SPEAKER_01: that this is just the start. And I hold these two opposing thoughts in my mind. And I'm kind of
[01:15:03] SPEAKER_01: stuck, which one to adopt. How do you feel? I feel, I feel the same. I think today relative to
[01:15:12] SPEAKER_00: call it the dot com boom and bust. I think if you really think deep down about what happened
[01:15:18] SPEAKER_00: in that era, let's say you did the Amazon series A, for example, there was a point in time four
[01:15:25] SPEAKER_00: years later where it had IPO'd and then it was down 80% from IPO. But if you had held to today,
[01:15:33] SPEAKER_00: you know, I forget if the Amazon A was 40 posts or whatever it was, but you went from 40 posts to
[01:15:39] SPEAKER_00: multiple trillions of dollars in value. So I think today is very similar in that there's going to
[01:15:46] SPEAKER_00: be a ton of companies that are pump fakes that do end up going to zero or that go down 90%. But I
[01:15:53] SPEAKER_00: think it's really important to position yourself so that you can survive the inevitable crash on
[01:15:57] SPEAKER_00: the other side. And if you end up in these really incredible companies that end up still enduring
[01:16:03] SPEAKER_00: and defining the next 20 to the 30 years of technology, you're going to be paid so many like in
[01:16:10] SPEAKER_00: so many multiples of what you would get in a normal cycle. And so I think we think and we stay
[01:16:16] SPEAKER_00: up all night thinking about like, well, what is going to be the Amazon and the Google and the
[01:16:19] SPEAKER_00: Microsoft of this era? And then also I think it goes to our strategy where like, let's constrain
[01:16:23] SPEAKER_00: our fun sizes. Let's be careful about what we do so that we don't get too over our skis where we
[01:16:28] SPEAKER_00: can easily weather a crash and LPs aren't going to go fleeing once there's a crash because we've
[01:16:33] SPEAKER_00: been very careful with our capital and we haven't incinerated billions of dollars or something like that.
[01:16:37] SPEAKER_00: I think benchmark could invest in Elizabeth Holmes doing Theronos take two and you'd still get LPs
[01:16:43] SPEAKER_01: queuing out the door thinking that Fenton has seen something that no one else has seen. Maybe we should
[01:16:50] SPEAKER_00: maybe we should. I think she's still in jail, but whenever she comes out, maybe we should.
[01:16:54] SPEAKER_00: It's about being contrarian and right. The terrifying thing is she has like, quote, tweeted me,
[01:16:59] SPEAKER_01: agreeing with me more times than I like. And I'm always like, this is a bad sign.
[01:17:04] SPEAKER_01: You're like, wait a minute. Apparently that's not her. Like, I release, I saw something on Twitter
[01:17:08] SPEAKER_00: where someone's impersonating her is what I saw. Apparently she doesn't actually have access. So
[01:17:13] SPEAKER_00: maybe it's one of your super fans. That's that's reassuring if so because I'm, I'm always like,
[01:17:19] SPEAKER_01: shit, delete, tweet, delete, tweet. Dude, I could talk to you all day. I want to do a quick
[01:17:25] SPEAKER_01: far out. So I say a short statement. You give me your immediate thoughts. What do you change your
[01:17:30] SPEAKER_01: mind on most in the last 12 months? I think honestly that the quality of the AI cloud business model.
[01:17:37] SPEAKER_00: Again, I was very negative at negative on it when like, where we was first coming up. I was like,
[01:17:42] SPEAKER_00: oh, this is reselling a commodity. Actually, I think there's a lot of interesting things that that
[01:17:46] SPEAKER_00: people are doing in the demand for AI inference is just so astronomical that at least for now and
[01:17:52] SPEAKER_00: for the next few years, I think it's going to overcome all business quality and like business
[01:17:55] SPEAKER_00: equation concerns. I think at some point, like they'll probably, you know, Corbyn, all these things
[01:17:59] SPEAKER_00: will probably go down like 70%. But obviously, I thought that back when it was raising at $3 billion
[01:18:04] SPEAKER_00: and now it's a $60 billion public company where the investors have been able to get liquidity. So
[01:18:08] SPEAKER_00: I was definitely wrong. Which pumped company today will have the steepest fall, do you think?
[01:18:15] I am not a, I mean, we're investors in cursor. I am not a believer in in some of the companies that
[01:18:21] SPEAKER_00: have raised a ton of money and have not released a product or like haven't, haven't like, I'm a
[01:18:27] SPEAKER_00: huge believer in like, you got to get developers hands on the product. So I think there's a couple
[01:18:31] SPEAKER_00: companies that have raised like billions of dollars and they're like, oh, we're going to build
[01:18:34] SPEAKER_00: the best thing ever, but they don't actually have products that a lot of developers are using.
[01:18:38] SPEAKER_00: And I think that like that is going to be a root awakening because you have like AI products
[01:18:42] SPEAKER_00: get better via usage. Oftentimes, if you have the right environments, it's like Cloud Code,
[01:18:48] SPEAKER_00: Codex, cursor, the companies in the apps with the highest amounts of usage are going to improve
[01:18:52] SPEAKER_00: the fastest and leave everybody in the dust. Tell me, you've got Bond, you've got Founders Fund,
[01:18:57] SPEAKER_01: you've got KP, all fantastic firms. But one firm where you got to put your money for the highest
[01:19:04] SPEAKER_01: cash on cash, which one should I think? Maybe Founders Fund is just because they have a very unique
[01:19:09] SPEAKER_00: ability to incubate companies. And so I think when you think about like, Androle, like the fun
[01:19:14] SPEAKER_00: that Androle is in, it's just going to be like such an ungodly return on that capital. And so
[01:19:20] SPEAKER_00: I think it's become a really, really competitive market. I'm the only way that you can like,
[01:19:24] SPEAKER_00: fend off how hard it is to buy equity is to sell equity or produce equity. And the way you produce
[01:19:29] SPEAKER_00: equity is by incubating companies. And every few funds or every like five to 10 years, they've
[01:19:34] SPEAKER_00: incubated an unbelievable company. Obviously, Scott Nolan over there is the most recent to do it. And
[01:19:38] SPEAKER_00: so I think that's just a way to get differentiated returns that are hard to produce from anyone else.
[01:19:42] SPEAKER_00: Totally agree with you. Um, phenomenal. And when you look back, just no one has so reliably
[01:19:48] SPEAKER_01: had such good performing funds at scale, them and index. It's crazy. Yeah, unbelievable.
[01:19:55] SPEAKER_01: Okay, totally got you. Can you take me to the moment where you said in your head, yeah, I'm
[01:20:00] SPEAKER_01: going to do benchmark. Was it a dinner? Was it a coffee? Was it a walk? When did you go? Yeah.
[01:20:05] SPEAKER_01: I think I think I said you had a benchmark when I was 22 entering the industry. Honestly, you know,
[01:20:10] SPEAKER_00: like you enter the industry, you read eboys, I'm reading all of Bill Gurley's blog posts, like,
[01:20:16] SPEAKER_00: it is a mythical place and it is one that it's one that you enter the industry as like a young investor.
[01:20:21] SPEAKER_00: And you think if I really work my ass off and I get pretty lucky, maybe one day I'll be able to
[01:20:26] SPEAKER_00: compete for a seat there. So when it comes true and they give you the envelope with the offer and
[01:20:31] SPEAKER_00: it's, I don't know, it's almost like a childhood fantasy of like doing the Yankees or something.
[01:20:35] SPEAKER_00: Like it's super surreal. So obviously the people matter most and that was really important during
[01:20:40] SPEAKER_00: your recruiting process was I felt unbelievable alignment and just really a level of closeness with
[01:20:45] SPEAKER_00: Peter, I can chase them. But beyond that, I think the firm itself, it's just one of these mythical
[01:20:50] SPEAKER_00: seats that you dream about from the day that you enter the asset class. It's not real Madrid.
[01:20:54] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, I know the bad about. I'm a few. I'm a few. I played FIFA in high school, but I don't,
[01:20:59] SPEAKER_00: I don't, yeah, I think it's like, yeah, I think it's like, yeah, like playing for real.
[01:21:02] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, you grow watching Rinaldo and you're like, oh my god, like I could go play for real
[01:21:07] SPEAKER_00: one day. And it's like, little chat shit that I'm so happy at Chelsea. I love being at Manu.
[01:21:11] SPEAKER_01: And then Ronaldo gets the real Madrid offer and you're like, yeah, old traffic. It's not so great.
[01:21:16] Not so great, is it? Not it's not it's sunny. I totally, I love that. Tell me, what's the biggest
[01:21:24] SPEAKER_01: miss for you, dude? And how did that change your mindset? Biggest miss. We talked about it a little
[01:21:29] SPEAKER_00: bit, but biggest miss has to be open AI at 32. I think obviously every like it was kind of a
[01:21:34] SPEAKER_00: hard to feel around, I think. Like obviously they did it, but it was, it was very non obvious at the time.
[01:21:40] SPEAKER_00: And it was just one of those ones that is just so unbelievably painful because you missed the
[01:21:44] SPEAKER_00: forest for the trees. You let these like the structure thing and the dilution thing trick you out
[01:21:49] SPEAKER_00: of investing in what is maybe going to be the largest tech company of all time. And also just
[01:21:53] SPEAKER_00: like being in that ecosystem, like it's just such an unbelievable group of people that you, you,
[01:21:58] SPEAKER_00: like I think even if it was just an okay return, you'd still want to be involved with Brad and Sam
[01:22:02] SPEAKER_00: and all the people over there that have, that have like defined a lot of what the AI industry is
[01:22:06] SPEAKER_00: today. And yeah, so that that one's, that one hurts to this day. What do you think the biggest
[01:22:11] SPEAKER_01: threat is to benchmark being successful in the next five years? I think the thing that is most
[01:22:18] SPEAKER_00: dangerous and the biggest risk to benchmark not being successful over the next two decades
[01:22:22] SPEAKER_00: is stasis. I think that we need to be dynamic. We need to always be evolving with the asset class
[01:22:28] SPEAKER_00: while staying true to our North stars. I am very much a believer that we don't have to
[01:22:34] SPEAKER_00: leave our North stars or bastardize our true North in order to continue to be involved with
[01:22:40] SPEAKER_00: the very, very best companies. But at the end of the day, being involved with the very, very best
[01:22:44] SPEAKER_00: companies is the currency by which we all live in this asset class. And that has to be the most
[01:22:50] SPEAKER_00: important thing. And if there's ever a situation where we're letting our North stars or we're letting
[01:22:54] SPEAKER_00: something else wag, you know, the tail wag the dog and the dog being getting involved with the
[01:22:59] SPEAKER_00: very, very best founders but building the best companies, that's when we need to reevaluate
[01:23:02] SPEAKER_00: our strategy and what we're doing. An ultimate one. Are you ready to lose all of your friends in
[01:23:07] SPEAKER_01: your new partnership? Who's the best picker in benchmark? I think the, I'll go with like a data,
[01:23:14] SPEAKER_00: I'll do a data driven one, which I think like, I think just Peters, I think, I mean, honestly,
[01:23:19] SPEAKER_00: I think Eric is the most underrated picker. I think when you look at just some of the, like,
[01:23:23] SPEAKER_00: he's just done some like really low key things that have ended up being like unbelievable,
[01:23:27] SPEAKER_00: like, I'll have cerebris, which, you know, well, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, at some point in
[01:23:30] SPEAKER_00: the future that's going to be an unbelievable company. He's like, a lot of these like sneaky,
[01:23:33] SPEAKER_00: absolute bangers, but I think if you go back and look at just like, okay, percent of series A's that
[01:23:38] SPEAKER_00: ended up being generational companies, I think, I think, you know, I mean, Peter also has the
[01:23:43] SPEAKER_00: advantage of being in the game for, for 20 plus years, but it's got to be Peter. I also think Peter
[01:23:47] SPEAKER_01: is possibly the greatest salesman I've ever met. His ability to manipulate language to sell
[01:23:53] SPEAKER_01: his position is, it's really beautiful. I, I, I win in my first pitch with him my first week,
[01:23:59] SPEAKER_00: and like, my jaw was on the floor more than the founder. I was like, I have so much to learn from
[01:24:04] SPEAKER_00: this guy. I'm like, I've never seen someone with a, like, that, that practices the craft of like
[01:24:10] SPEAKER_00: infinite EQ and hospitality and just word craft like he does. It's, it's unbelievable to witness.
[01:24:14] SPEAKER_00: You weren't like, wait a minute, this is just like being in a room with Dallion.
[01:24:20] Dallion is more of a blunt instrument, I would say. Uh, dude, he's going to fucking either hate me
[01:24:25] SPEAKER_01: or love me for this show. I've no idea. Probably a mix of both. Dude, final one for you. I like
[01:24:31] SPEAKER_01: optimism. What are you most excited about for the next 10 years? I think over the next 10 years,
[01:24:37] SPEAKER_00: the only thing that's ever made me less of a capitalist than I am is realizing that capitalism
[01:24:42] SPEAKER_00: is really, really good at optimizing things and making them more efficient. And when the, the,
[01:24:46] SPEAKER_00: you know, the laser beam of capitalism moved from like cars and like TVs and electric goods and
[01:24:52] SPEAKER_00: making them cheaper and moved to the minds of people. I think it actually has had a lot of negative
[01:24:56] SPEAKER_00: consequences. Like, you know, when social media had its rise, the thing it was optimizing for was
[01:25:01] SPEAKER_00: how do we get people to glue their faces to the screen for as long as possible? I think that's,
[01:25:05] SPEAKER_00: that's been actually like a, like a significant negative and probably the only negative that
[01:25:09] SPEAKER_00: technologies had on on society thus far. But I think like when, when we look at what's happening in
[01:25:14] SPEAKER_00: AI and the way that it's going to be able to, like I, like Peter always, like Peter T. L always
[01:25:19] SPEAKER_00: talks about how the most important thing to keeping our society harmonious and functional is growth
[01:25:25] SPEAKER_00: because as soon as this pie stops growing, things get a lot worse and people get a lot worse to
[01:25:30] SPEAKER_00: each other because it's zero sum. Like unfortunately, you're seeing a fair amount of that over where you
[01:25:34] SPEAKER_00: live, Harry. And I think like when you think about the determinants of GDP growth being basically
[01:25:40] SPEAKER_00: population and GDP per capita and how much the birth rate is slowing, I think AI is going to be
[01:25:46] SPEAKER_00: unbelievably good at continuing GDP growth. And I think continuing GDP growth and just growth
[01:25:51] SPEAKER_00: of the economy and continuing growing a pie and having the middle class grow and having just everyone
[01:25:56] SPEAKER_00: feel more and more prosperous over time is the most single important variable in continuing a
[01:26:02] SPEAKER_00: harmonious functional society. And I think it's going to do that in speeds over the next 10 years.
[01:26:06] You know, I've honestly, I love doing this show. But I've done it for 10, 11 years. And
[01:26:12] SPEAKER_01: not every show is as brilliant as this by any means. And it shows like this, which made me go like,
[01:26:17] SPEAKER_01: this is why I still love doing what I do. And so thank you for being so brilliant. Seriously,
[01:26:22] SPEAKER_01: this was so much fun. And I just couldn't be through it more thrilled with this show.
[01:26:27] Thank you, Harry. It's been, it's been so awesome. Just, just staying with you. And next time we'll do a
[01:26:30] SPEAKER_00: pint and land the next time I'm out there.
