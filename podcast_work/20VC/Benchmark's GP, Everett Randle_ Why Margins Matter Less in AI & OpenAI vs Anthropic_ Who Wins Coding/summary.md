# [Podcast Summary: Everett Randle (Benchmark) on 20VC with Harry Stebbings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc)

## 1. Key Themes

### Theme 1: AI Companies Require a New Financial Framework Beyond SaaS Metrics

Traditional SaaS metrics like 80% gross margins are misleading for AI companies. The focus should shift to **absolute gross profit dollars per customer** rather than gross margin percentages.

**Substantiation:**
"If your average gross profit per customer can be four or five X that of a normal SaaS company, then you actually have much more absolute dollars of gross profit per customer. And potentially a much, much larger market than you do for SaaS companies as well. So instead of talking about gross margins and revenue multiples, I hope that at some day, we talk about gross profit multiples." - Everett Randle [[00:22:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=21m50s)

He illustrated this with a home services AI company: "How much do you spend on ServiceTitan? They're like, you know, 250K? And it's like, okay, well, how much are you spending on this company? And they're like, you know, 250K. And it's like, okay, you have seven products from ServiceTitan from SaaS 2.0 and you have one product that's just out of beta from this new startup in voice AI." [[00:19:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=19m20s)

### Theme 2: Venture Capital Is Bifurcating Into Two Distinct Models

The industry is splitting between high-velocity mega funds deploying massive capital and boutique firms like Benchmark optimizing for cash-on-cash returns.

**Substantiation:**
"Venture capital is going to bifurcate. And on one end, you're going to have the Tiger model, which is high capital velocity, a lot of money out of the door every single year. Low touch, good prices, like giving founders really good prices. And on the other end, who did I have? I had benchmark ironically. And like that is going to be like the craft that is going to be high touch." - Everett Randle [[00:58:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=58m17s)

He noted the industry shift: "Tiger died. And we got six or seven more tigers out of like in the last four years." [[00:59:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=58m50s)

### Theme 3: Fund Size Determines Investment Strategy and Returns Profile

Smaller fund sizes enable different strategies and potentially superior cash-on-cash returns compared to mega funds constrained by deployment requirements.

**Substantiation:**
"Out of our last fund, our five best investments in that last fund today held at LRP last round price are about a 60X. We have two 30Xs and we have two 20Xs. Since ChatGPT was released, there isn't an OpenAI round that touches that return multiple and that money on money multiple. And we have five of them." - Everett Randle [[00:34:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=34m15s)

On mega funds: "I don't think as Ravya Hamant or even Ben and Mark at this point, I don't think that they can go to LPs and say, hey, this basket of funds that we're making you invest party pursue across, we're going to get you five X net on that."

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Perspective 1: Lower Gross Margins in AI Companies Are Actually a Positive Signal

High gross margins in AI companies may indicate low product usage, while lower margins suggest heavy AI inference usage (product-market fit).

**Substantiation:**
"If you have high gross margins as an AI app company right now, it probably means that you have very little inference expense, like AI inference expense in your cogs, which means no one's actually using your AI features." - Everett Randle [[00:23:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=23m22s)

### Perspective 2: Technology Moats Still Matter More Than Distribution in AI

Contrary to popular belief that distribution is the new moat, building exceptional AI products remains the primary competitive advantage.

**Substantiation:**
"I definitely disagree with that. I think the moat is still fundamentally in technology, not in distribution... How damn hard it is to build good AI products. Like a good AI product is so much different to build than a good SaaS product. Like you need different people. There's so many different parts of like a good pipeline in terms of like where do you bring in LLMs? How do you improve them?" - Everett Randle [[00:31:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=30m54s)

### Perspective 3: Commodity Businesses Can Be Exceptional Investments

The narrative that models/infrastructure are "just commodities" ignores that AWS, the world's best infrastructure business, is also technically a commodity.

**Substantiation:**
"What is AWS? It's a commodity. And that's what I find so interesting, I was like, oh, models won't make money because they just commodity businesses and then you look at Google Cloud, you look at Azure and you look at AWS and you're going, wow, maybe the best business in the world is a commodity business." - Harry Stebbings [[00:26:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=26m5s)

Everett added: "When they were when Coreweave was first raising in private markets, I was like, oh my god, this is the reselling a commodity. You know, there are middleman, there are broker of compute, it's going to be low margin yada yada yada. How wrong was I? You know, it's a I mean, maybe it's the markets down a little bit. But last time I checked, it was a $60 billion public company." [[00:26:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=26m41s)

### Perspective 4: Market Selection Is the Least Important Factor (People > Product > Market)

While conventional wisdom often prioritizes market size, the best founders can pivot markets, making people and product more critical.

**Substantiation:**
"The way you said it, honestly, people product and market. I think the people define everything else. They are the upstream engine that makes everything go. They're the most important piece... But I just think it's the most fungible. Like I don't think you can turn a non exceptional person into an exceptional person. I don't think you can take a team that can't build a good product and make them a team that can build a good product. But you can change markets, especially early on in a company's life. Like most of the amazing companies and exit stories had some pivot along the road, whether you're talking about slack or any of these others." - Everett Randle [[00:55:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=55m48s)

### Perspective 5: Tiger Global Will Perform Better Than Expected

Contrary to the narrative of Tiger as a cautionary tale, their portfolio positioning suggests strong returns ahead.

**Substantiation:**
"I think Tiger's going to end up much better than anyone thought they were going to end up... They got really big stakes in Databricks. They invested in OpenAI very, very early. I think they have a large position in OpenAI. They actually have large positions in a lot of these amazing companies that could continue to compound 5X more. Again, they'll probably benefit from the liquidation preferences and the beauty of having preferred stock for a lot of the things that don't work." - Everett Randle [[01:05:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=1h4m51s)

## 4. Operating Insights

### Insight 1: Personal Capital Commitment Tests True Conviction

Founders Fund has a mechanism where investors can personally invest alongside the fund in deals, creating accountability.

**Substantiation:**
"There's a program, for example, at founders fund where anyone that works on an investment or if you're leading an investment, you can personally invest alongside the firm in that investment, almost as if you're angel investing... it's a conviction test. Because if you're sponsoring some pro-rata of a company that's like doing okay but not great, but the founder really wants you to do pro-rata to not blow up the round, but you're not doing some of your portion of the individual side of that investment and your angel investment, Peter can go to you and say, do you not think this is better than having your money in the S&P?" - Everett Randle [[00:04:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=4m7s)

### Insight 2: See Excellence Up Close Early in Your Career

Exposure to exceptional companies and management teams is essential for calibrating what "great" looks like.

**Substantiation:**
"One, he really imparted on to me that you need to, early in your career, see excellence up close. And in terms of a company, a management team, a founder, you need to see how the absolute best operate and do the job of company building. Because if you don't see that, relatively early in your career, it's much, much harder to spot it in the wild. And you also don't know the bar to hold your other founders and your other management teams too." - Everett Randle on Mamoon Hamid [[00:08:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=8m38s)

### Insight 3: Use Quantitative Models to Drive Qualitative Narratives

Financial models should reveal the future story, not just predict numbers.

**Substantiation:**
"What she does is she, it's almost like she's reading the matrix. Like she lays out all the sequential numbers historically for a company and then all the numbers going forward. And it's almost like she's, you know, reading the matrix code as it comes down. And she's seeing what the company will become on an eight to 10 year time horizon when she sees what the numbers are... She won't see, you know, seven years out 80% growth or something like that. She'll see that, you know, 20% of households are going to be ordering from DoorDash on a monthly basis. And she can visualize that." - Everett Randle on Mary Meeker [[00:02:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=2m44s)

## 5. Overlooked Insights

### Insight 1: The "Yardstick Test" for Investment Conviction

While quickly mentioned, this is a powerful framework: Model what the market expects as baseline returns, then test if your conviction suggests the company will "absolutely smoke these projections."

**Substantiation:**
"You should understand what the base case or like the base rate future of the company looks like... If you just said like, hey, this is what the market thinks is sort of like the baseline of what this company should do. It's actually extremely helpful to lay that all out and visualize that... when you have a really, really strong intuition about a company in the middle of an inflection that's about to absolutely explode, you look at the numbers that people are underwriting to to get to their three to five x. And you say, this company is going to absolutely smoke these projections." [[00:53:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=53m10s)

This framework bridges quantitative rigor with qualitative conviction in a unique way - it's not about believing your model, but about using market consensus as a measuring stick for your differentiated view.

### Insight 2: GDP Growth as the Ultimate Social Stabilizer

Briefly mentioned but profound: AI's primary value to society may be sustaining GDP growth as birth rates decline, which is essential for social harmony.

**Substantiation:**
"Peter T.L always talks about how the most important thing to keeping our society harmonious and functional is growth because as soon as this pie stops growing, things get a lot worse and people get a lot worse to each other because it's zero sum... When you think about the determinants of GDP growth being basically population and GDP per capita and how much the birth rate is slowing, I think AI is going to be unbelievably good at continuing GDP growth. And I think continuing GDP growth and just growth of the economy and continuing growing a pie and having the middle class grow and having just everyone feel more and more prosperous over time is the most single important variable in continuing a harmonious functional society." - Everett Randle [[01:25:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7bhb3NEFc&t=1h25m15s)

This reframes AI investment from pure financial returns to civilizational importance - the companies that successfully augment human productivity may be essential infrastructure for social stability.
