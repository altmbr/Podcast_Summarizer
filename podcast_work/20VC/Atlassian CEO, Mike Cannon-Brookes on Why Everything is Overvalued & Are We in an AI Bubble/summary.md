# Podcast Summary: Atlassian CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes on Valuation, AI, and the Future

## 1. Key Themes

### The AI Era is Creating Unprecedented Chaos and Opportunity

Mike describes the current period as a transformative but uncertain time that will be remembered as "crazy" in retrospect. He emphasizes the Cambrian explosion nature of innovation happening now.

"One of the only predictions I think I would make accurately is 10 years from now we'll look back and say, man, you remember that era? That was crazy. That 3, 4, 5 year period was just a complete up and down turmoil. And there'll be some things where people will say, remember that thing? Man, we all thought that was going to be huge and it was nothing. And everyone else being like, yeah, no one saw this thing coming and it was massive." [[00:13:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=13m1s)

The company is dealing with this uncertainty through quarterly reassessments of their fundamental hunches and maintaining close customer contact as an anchor during the storm. They're making strategic bets on multi-model infrastructure and refusing to build foundational models themselves, instead focusing on rapid deployment and integration.

### Design Will Be the Key Differentiator in the AI Era

Cannon-Brookes argues that as software becomes cheaper to create, design (lowercase "d") becomes exponentially more valuable. He frames this as fundamental design thinking, not just visual aesthetics.

"I think what is underwritten is the importance of design. When you have any major technological transition, we're back to an era of fundamental design. We are rethinking entire swaths of the world... In an era where arguably software gets cheaper to create, we can argue about that maybe, but there will certainly be far more software, probably a fairly safe assumption, far more technology. What differentiates it is probably how it feels and how it works. And that's very hard to copy." [[00:19:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=19m14s)

Atlassian has "really beefed up the size, the quality, the talent on a design team" and is doing foundational work on delivering AI to users who don't need to understand technical concepts like "probabilistic and deterministic" or "what a model is." [[00:21:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=20m53s)

### AI Will Create More Jobs, Not Fewer

Counter to conventional wisdom, Cannon-Brookes believes both the number of software developers and total technology output will increase dramatically.

"Five years from now we'll have more engineers working for our company than we do today. More software developers working for our companies. We will create far more. They will be more efficient. But software is technology creation is not output bound. It's like the demand supply is very off the charts. What I mean by that is we don't have a shortage of ideas for new technology that we want. Find me a software company or a technology company that gets to the end of its roadmap." [[00:26:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=26m40s)

The company is hiring more graduates this year than last year, and Cannon-Brookes believes graduates coming in with native AI skills will "shake up the existing world of talent in a positive way" similar to how Loom entered businesses through younger employees who were natively comfortable with video communication.

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Most Things Are Vastly Overvalued - Including in AI

When asked about investment strategy in the current environment, Cannon-Brookes was blunt about valuations while acknowledging the difficulty of identifying winners.

"Most of the things are vastly overvalued, probably true. Some of the things will be worth far more and are undervalued. And their far more is probably overweight. All of the things that are overvalued, like as classically happens, right? For all the dot coms that went bust, Amazon turned out to be quite a good business." [[00:14:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=14m35s)

He highlighted the circular revenue problem: "Some AI company, let's just call them, give $100 million to a model company who then give $150 million to a cloud provider, who then gives $200 million to Nvidia by chips. And everyone's like, look, how much revenue we've all got. And you're like, yeah, but you're all like losing $50 million on the way through." [[00:15:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=15m14s)

### Business Applications Won't Collapse - They'll Proliferate

Directly challenging Satya Nadella's view that business applications will collapse in the agent era, Cannon-Brookes argues for continued proliferation and specialization.

"There's an old adage in enterprise software that every single piece of enterprise software can be replicated with email and Excel. It's quite true. You can do any application you want with email and Excel... There's a reason we don't all just sit there and email Excel is still very used, very popular. But at the same time, they are not used for large scale things... What we've seen over the last 10 years is the opposite. We've had a Cambridge explosion of SAS apps to do more and more and more specific tasks. But they do the task much better." [[00:22:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=21m50s)

He doesn't believe in a future where all apps "just disappear into some God-like Siri agent that we just talked to. I'm not a believer in that world view. I don't think it's likely to happen." [[00:22:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=22m47s)

### Wouldn't Pay 10X for AI Coding Tools

When asked if he'd pay 10X the current price for AI coding assistants, Cannon-Brookes was the only CEO among many asked who said no, citing competitive dynamics and the fact that coding is only 10-30% of a developer's job.

"No, probably not. I mean, maybe 10 times a point... Because I think the competitive vector between them is not going to let you do that, firstly. In terms of switching costs. One of them charged 10X, you just switched to the other one. Secondly, they're all good at different things. So there's a reason our engineers have access to all of them." [[00:35:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=35m17s)

He emphasized that "coding is a pretty small part of a software developer's job. Different surveys, 10%, 20%, 30% of the week is spent writing code... Search is probably about the same amount of time as writing code for most software developers." [[00:36:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=36m0s)

## 3. Companies Identified

### Loom (Acquired by Atlassian)

Loom was acquired by Atlassian three years ago and has become particularly valuable in the AI era. The company is being used as a case study for how new communication paradigms enter enterprises through younger employees.

"We acquired Loom 3 years ago now. It was a massive acquisition. It was a bold bet. I don't think it's particularly any different than the two we've just done. It's done very well. It's a fantastic product, fantastic team that cranking away. And it's been a fantastic thing for the AI era." [[00:14:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=13m53s)

"One of the ways that Loom gets into businesses, Loom being a video and communications tool, is through graduates, because young people coming into businesses use a lot of business tools and I like, man, this is so inefficient. Young people that ticked Toc Snapchat generation... They are natively used to FaceTime and video calls and voice notes. This is a very common communication factor for them... When they come into a business and they use Loom to communicate, the business goes, man, those people are more productive." [[00:33:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=33m34s)

### Browser Company (DX Investment)

Mentioned as one of the recent strategic investments Atlassian has made, though details were limited in the discussion. Part of the portfolio of moves made in the last 18 months. [[00:12:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=11m53s)

### Williams Racing (Sports Investment)

Referenced as part of Cannon-Brookes' sports investing activities outside of Atlassian's core business operations. [[00:12:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=11m53s)

## 4. Operating Insights

### The Co-CEO Structure Requires 60-80% Overlap

Cannon-Brookes provided specific guidance on what makes co-CEO relationships work, based on his two-decade experience with Scott Farquhar.

"I once described it that Scott and I are probably somewhere between 60 and 80% overlap. If we're 100% overlap, we do exactly the same thing well. There's not much point in having two of us. If we're 0% overlap, you're going to have a lot of conflict. So you need to have enough sort of shared spot in the middle where you understand what the goals are, but also time when you're just like, well, I'm doing my thing and you're doing your thing." [[00:07:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=7m12s)

He advised new Spotify co-CEOs: "You've got to be as open as possible, dealing with conflicts, dealing with perceived conflicts. You've got to be very careful to try to keep balance... At the same time, you have to have a swim lane." [[00:06:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=6m42s)

### The "If I Can't Convince Him" Decision-Making Framework

Rather than having formal tiebreaker mechanisms (despite having scissors-paper-rock in early shareholder agreements), the real operating principle was more elegant.

"I've always lived by the maximum. If I can't convince him that something's a good idea, it's probably not. That is a really good marker that something is probably not a good idea and vice versa. I think he would say probably the same thing, which meant, you know, if you did disagree, maybe you tried to lobby the other person, convince them for a while. If you couldn't convince him, it was a good idea. We didn't do the thing." [[00:09:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=9m1s)

### Make Hunches, Then Reassess Quarterly

Rather than trying to be certain in uncertain times, Atlassian makes explicit bets while maintaining the flexibility to change course.

"We've said for two and a half years now we need to make bets. We need to make not in the same way you just used the word, sorry. We need to make choices or opinions about how we think things are going to evolve. But we need to be willing to change those. So we have various hunches, I would say, that we've made, that we said, hey, we think over the next three years this is going to be what happens. But about every quarter we reassess those sets of fundamental choices." [[00:16:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=16m33s)

### Build Multi-Model Infrastructure on Purpose

One of Atlassian's key strategic bets has been building for a multi-model future rather than betting on a single AI provider.

"Very early on, we thought they would likely be multiple foundational models that were competing. And hence we've built our technology to be multi model on purpose in almost every way. And that we were not going to make foundational models. It's unlikely we'd be able to compete to train our own models. However, we have to get good at something. And what we are good at is adopting and delivering the value of that model in software to our customers very, very quickly." [[00:18:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=18m28s)

## 5. Overlooked Insights

### The "Founder's Job is to Fight the Entropy of Ambition"

Cannon-Brookes quoted what appears to be a powerful operating principle that he attributes to "Tobes" (likely Tobi Lütke of Shopify given the context).

"My favorite quote of Tobes is, once told me that the founder's job is to fight the entropy of ambition." [[00:00:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=11s)

This brief mention suggests a deeper philosophy about organizational decay and the unique role of founders in maintaining high standards and ambitious goals as companies scale. The concept of "entropy of ambition" - the natural tendency for organizations to become less ambitious over time - is profound but wasn't explored further in the conversation.

### The Financial Professional Writing Python Example

While discussing vibe coding, Cannon-Brookes casually mentioned an example that reveals a massive shift in how work gets done:

"I will have people in finance who are quote unquote vibe coding and application to solve a financial problem for themselves. Where previously they might have tried with Excel or they might have filed a ticket with IT or they just wouldn't have bothered. They're writing Python code to do crazy complex analysis. The cost of that code is so small that they maybe do it three or four times. They throw it away. It didn't work." [[00:29:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqzQ1UweEg&t=29m46s)

This wasn't framed as revolutionary, but represents a fundamental shift in organizational capabilities. Finance professionals writing and iterating on Python code multiple times for single-use analysis represents a complete reimagining of knowledge work that transcends traditional software development categories. The casualness with which this was mentioned suggests this is already happening at scale within Atlassian.
