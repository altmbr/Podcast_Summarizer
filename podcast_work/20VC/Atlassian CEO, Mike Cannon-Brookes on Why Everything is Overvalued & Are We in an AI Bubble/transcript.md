[00:00:00] reasonable men live within the boundaries and so you need unreasonable men to change things and move the world forward.
[00:00:05] Mike Cannon-Brookes: One of the only predictions I think I would make accurately is 10 years from now we'll look back and say,
[00:00:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: man, you remember that era? That was crazy.
[00:00:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Most of the things are vastly overvalued.
[00:00:13] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Five years from now we'll have more engineers working for our company than we do today.
[00:00:16] Mike Cannon-Brookes: More software developers working for our companies.
[00:00:18] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We will create far more. They will be more efficient.
[00:00:21] Mike Cannon-Brookes: My favorite quote of Tobes is, once told me that the founder's job is to fight the entropy of ambition.
[00:00:27] Ready to go?
[00:00:30] Mike, I'm so excited for this dude. I am like one of the biggest at Lassian fans.
[00:00:35] So thank you so much for joining me, stay dude.
[00:00:37] Thanks for having me on there. Pleasure.
[00:00:39] Not at all. Now Scott calls you and this was from one of your team members that I heard. He calls you the unreasonable man.
[00:00:57] Why does he call you the unreasonable man as a starting point?
[00:01:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I know it's after George Bernard Shaw. His sort of famous quote that the all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
[00:01:12] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Because the unreasonable man is the one who doesn't believe in boundaries, makes changes, etc.
[00:01:18] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse, but reasonable men live within the boundaries.
[00:01:23] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So you need unreasonable men to change things and move the world forward.
[00:01:28] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And he's always been his nickname for probably two decades now.
[00:01:32] Do you think you're an unreasonable man?
[00:01:35] I think it's not an unfair term.
[00:01:38] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It sounds very negative, doesn't it? So I think in the way that he means it, yes, it's probably pretty apt.
[00:01:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I tend to get frustrated when things don't work the way I think they should.
[00:01:49] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And just try to change them because it seems like the logical thing to do, rather than accepting that they can't work.
[00:01:55] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Sometimes that leads you into trouble and other times it leads you into doing things that hadn't been done before.
[00:02:02] I am a massive fan of David Goggins, that Navy SEAL who basically tells you to just continue through suffering.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: And he says that the worst thing is to become civilized. A civilized person is mediocre.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: Lathagy, which is very strange for European to be saying this.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: But yes. So I totally agree with you in terms of benefits of unreasonable men.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_00: You said that you get frustrated when things don't work the way you think they should.
[00:02:28] What is most pressing to you that doesn't work the way you think it should today?
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_00: Look, I think the people who come with the systemic minds and create technology or getting to technology
[00:02:41] Mike Cannon-Brookes: because they see it's creative potential. They're inevitably thinking, I can take this thing and that thing and put them together and make that.
[00:02:49] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Why hasn't anybody done that yet? And then they just kind of go and make that thing.
[00:02:53] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Sometimes it works wonderfully, sometimes it's horrible and nobody knows about it.
[00:02:57] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So I think there are plenty of things that don't work in the world.
[00:03:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Doesn't necessarily mean that don't work. There could be better.
[00:03:03] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Right. And we, you know, at last, it's in the builders business of building technology.
[00:03:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And we're trying to make better technology every single day.
[00:03:10] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's plenty of things that we haven't done yet that we want to go do.
[00:03:14] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Obviously in the AI era, there's lots changing there.
[00:03:17] Lots changing in the global energy world, climate world.
[00:03:20] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And I still don't understand why my dishwasher is so complicated.
[00:03:23] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So we can go any which way.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: Tish, I've got no idea how to turn on the dishwasher.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: So you're still ahead of me. It's fine.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: And you and Scott were two of the most famous co CEOs.
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_00: And really kind of pioneered the structure and tech for a long time.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: Now obviously you're solo CEO.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_00: I just love to hear your reflections on what were your biggest lessons from being such successful co CEOs for years.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: And what worked and what didn't with the benefit of hindsight?
[00:03:52] Look, I think there's no doubt that last year wouldn't be where it is without Scott,
[00:03:59] Mike Cannon-Brookes: probably without both of us, without the relationship.
[00:04:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's really hard starting a company.
[00:04:03] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's really hard building something.
[00:04:05] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's probably even harder doing it on the far side of the world from most of the other people who are doing similar things.
[00:04:10] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And so having two equal parties, I think, in motivation, experience.
[00:04:17] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We've always talked about this is a really important part of what made it successful.
[00:04:21] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And by equal, yes, equal, I don't know, shareholding wise, equity wise.
[00:04:25] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But equal in terms of age, life stage, equal in terms of naivity and experience and wisdom.
[00:04:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think that really helped because there's not you'd go into a room and be like,
[00:04:36] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't know how to do this.
[00:04:37] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And he goes, I don't know how to do it.
[00:04:38] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Well, we've got to figure it out.
[00:04:39] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But you have someone who's at a very balanced, let's say, stage of all of those sorts of things.
[00:04:46] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I remember when we both started having kids was around the same age.
[00:04:49] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We both got married around the same time.
[00:04:53] That really helps because when you have a kid, you're like, oh my God, this is really hard.
[00:04:57] I didn't get any sleep last night kind of thing.
[00:04:59] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And that goes for a long time.
[00:05:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's really helpful to have someone else who's in a similar situation.
[00:05:04] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And you can sort of talk through it and work through it.
[00:05:06] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And we've juggled and balanced for decades.
[00:05:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think that's one thing that really made it work is the equality and the balance.
[00:05:13] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And the, you know, that sort of world.
[00:05:16] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think the second is he's far better at this than I am.
[00:05:20] And I know he said the same thing.
[00:05:22] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think it really helps to think the other person is just far better than you are at pretty much everything.
[00:05:26] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Because you're both stretching to try to be as good as the other person.
[00:05:30] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If that makes any sense, right?
[00:05:32] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I know it's been said long with partners.
[00:05:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You want to believe your partners out of your league.
[00:05:35] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Because then you're like, oh, I better show up.
[00:05:37] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And if both partners believe the other person's out of their league, it really makes sense.
[00:05:41] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It, dude, you can't, David Gorgins is a good analogy for Scott in terms of his ability to tolerate shit, get through and keep going.
[00:05:49] Mike Cannon-Brookes: The man works so hard like he, he lifts a high bar so you felt for 20 plus years.
[00:05:56] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I had to keep that high bar right.
[00:05:58] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'd say lastly, look, good friends.
[00:06:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I mean, you got to, you got to laugh a lot about these sorts of things.
[00:06:04] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You're going to go through all the ups and downs over many, many decades.
[00:06:08] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think we're both pretty grounded people and just had a lot of fun with it.
[00:06:13] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We've been on the right of a lifetime and you just got to enjoy that right.
[00:06:18] Mike Cannon-Brookes: They're the really helps. They'll just have a beer and hang out and enjoy it.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_00: Two of my dear friends, Alex Nordstrom and Gustav Sodistrim, who've just become the two co-CEOs of Spotify,
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_00: in a really interesting new structure, obviously replacing Daniel.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: What advice would you give to them entering this structure, knowing all that you know?
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: Knowing a bunch of those people and getting myself in trouble.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: I...
[00:06:45] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Demo, it's just between us, dude.
[00:06:47] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think the advice would be that you've got to be as open as possible,
[00:06:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: dealing with conflicts, dealing with perceived conflicts.
[00:06:56] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You've got to be very careful to try to keep balance.
[00:07:02] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Right, you've got to have balance to the force.
[00:07:04] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's a yin yang kind of element to any of these partnerships that has to work.
[00:07:08] At the same time, you have to have a swim lane.
[00:07:13] That's what the magic is somewhere in the both of those things.
[00:07:17] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I once described it that Scott and I are probably somewhere between 60 and 80% overlap.
[00:07:22] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If we're 100% overlap, we do exactly the same thing well.
[00:07:25] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's not much point in having two of us.
[00:07:27] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If we're 0% overlap, you're going to have a lot of conflict.
[00:07:30] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So you need to have enough sort of shared spot in the middle where you understand what the goals are,
[00:07:35] Mike Cannon-Brookes: but also time when you're just like, well, I'm doing my thing and you're doing your thing.
[00:07:39] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But in the Alaskan history, you know, at various times,
[00:07:43] Mike Cannon-Brookes: both of us were in the whole business where someone was off on sabbatical or getting married or something else like this.
[00:07:51] Mike Cannon-Brookes: For, I don't know, periods of up to maybe six months.
[00:07:54] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And at other times, we moved the various functions around.
[00:07:57] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think both of us probably ran all the functions for various times.
[00:08:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Anywhere from a few years to, you know, I ran probably sales and marketing for 13 years,
[00:08:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: probably the longest of any single function staying with a single person, right?
[00:08:10] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And then moved to Scott for four years.
[00:08:12] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And so there were swim lengths.
[00:08:14] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You have to have an understanding in roles and responsibilities to make it work.
[00:08:18] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But you also have to have quite a lot of shared, shared context, shared understanding
[00:08:22] Mike Cannon-Brookes: and that equality was really important.
[00:08:24] Mike Cannon-Brookes: When did you most vehemently disagree?
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_00: And how did it resolve itself?
[00:08:28] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Well, look, firstly, our first shareholder agreement did have actually in there
[00:08:34] Mike Cannon-Brookes: that if we couldn't agree on something, we'd go to a game of Scissors Paper Rock Best of Three.
[00:08:40] We never got into any bigger disagreements when that shareholder agreement was actually governing the company.
[00:08:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Don't worry, there's a large public company that's no longer in the bylaws.
[00:08:48] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But it was for probably well over a decade.
[00:08:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I always knew I'd lose this as a Paper Rock game, Best of Three.
[00:08:56] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Therefore, we didn't do any disagreements that required imposition the use of that clause.
[00:09:04] I think we look, we've disagreed over acquisitions, we've disagreed over strategic directions, etc.
[00:09:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I've always lived by the maximum.
[00:09:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If I can't convince him that something's a good idea, it's probably not.
[00:09:14] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That is a really good marker that something is probably not a good idea and vice versa.
[00:09:18] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think he would say probably the same thing, which meant, you know, if you did disagree,
[00:09:24] Mike Cannon-Brookes: maybe you tried to lobby the other person, convince them for a while.
[00:09:27] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If you couldn't convince him, it was a good idea.
[00:09:29] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We didn't do the thing.
[00:09:31] It worked pretty well.
[00:09:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There was no real, I would say, major, major disagreements that were sort of epic, singular points
[00:09:39] Mike Cannon-Brookes: that business went one way or the other.
[00:09:42] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We've been in the same boat for a long time.
[00:09:45] I remember him telling me the story of him actually being on honeymoon and being in Safari
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: and being completely off-grid.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_00: And you having to get hold of him.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: I remember what for and like him had to go to some random ass village.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, geez, this is why I don't leave London.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_00: I get clients when I leave a delivery room zone.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: So it's not a good thing for me.
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we had a security incident.
[00:10:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Our first sort of major security incident decades ago now.
[00:10:12] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And I needed to contact him for various legal reasons.
[00:10:17] Mike Cannon-Brookes: He had to be notified.
[00:10:19] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And so he landed in a bush plane somewhere in Africa and got a radio message, I believe,
[00:10:23] Mike Cannon-Brookes: saying, when you can call Mike and he's like, hundreds of corners.
[00:10:26] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So we sorted out.
[00:10:29] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's a good example of where you need co-founders better to have two of us in the situation.
[00:10:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We had a replacement.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_00: And going back to the unreasonable man and you know, being the sole CEO.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_00: You know, when I reflect on your last 18 months respectfully, and I hope this isn't rude of me,
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: it's probably the most aggressive but also obvious example of like founder mode in action.
[00:10:50] Do you think that's a fair description?
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_00: And was it a deliberate I want to make some big bold moves to show the market?
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_00: I'm here to really play.
[00:11:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'm going to violate the old media will never disagree with journalists, but you said you're not a journalist, that's all right.
[00:11:05] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Hey, you disagree with me, please.
[00:11:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:11:08] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I mean, it's interesting.
[00:11:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't think I've seen a characterised that way.
[00:11:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's certainly no intention to be like, let's go make some bold moves.
[00:11:15] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If anything, I bring him all the time and be like, hey, what do you think about this idea?
[00:11:21] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I get all the credit and all the debit now.
[00:11:23] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So that's interesting.
[00:11:25] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Anyone who knows about technology companies knows it's a little bit like when a new Prime Minister comes in in England or Australia, right?
[00:11:32] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Suddenly, the interest rates go up or down a month after they've come in and it's their fault.
[00:11:35] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And they're like, oh, yeah, I wasn't here for the last five years of running the economy.
[00:11:38] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So suddenly I get the credit or, you know, many of the things that we've obviously done over the last 18 months were planned many, many months, years, quarters in advance of that.
[00:11:48] But if I push you then, again, you disagree with me.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_00: I'm not a journalist, so you can tell me I'm a VC, so you can legitimately tell me I don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_00: And then you would be right.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_00: But like, you know, the sports investing with Williams, love Williams, by the way, which you said to show with James.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_00: He's fantastic.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: Awesome, dude.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_00: But like Williams, the acquisitions, browser company DX, some of the smaller ones.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_00: These are pretty big bold strategic decisions that I imagine were not longer term planning.
[00:12:18] Yes and no. Some of them are certainly longer term planning.
[00:12:21] Other ones I would say, again, to the characterization that it's a desire to sort of stamp some sort of like,
[00:12:27] Mike Cannon-Brookes: oh, now Scots out, I can do the things I've never able to do beforehand.
[00:12:30] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Like, there's literally zero of that, right?
[00:12:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's no doubt the AI era, whatever in the last couple of years has been a little bit busy.
[00:12:38] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And there's a little bit going on in technology.
[00:12:41] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So I think for every company, it's probably a more active period.
[00:12:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If you're really trying to compete, if you're really trying to create, this is the time when A, you should love it.
[00:12:51] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And B, it's a little bit of chaos, right?
[00:12:54] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's not a linear period.
[00:12:56] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It is a period where you need to invest in things.
[00:13:00] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You need to make some bets.
[00:13:02] It's a very creative period.
[00:13:04] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I tell people, time, there's the reason we got into technology.
[00:13:06] Mike Cannon-Brookes: This is amazing. This is like one of the most exciting periods.
[00:13:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We will all look back at this.
[00:13:11] I guarantee you, one of the only predictions I think I would make accurately is 10 years to now will look back and say,
[00:13:16] Mike Cannon-Brookes: man, you remember that era? That was crazy.
[00:13:18] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That 3, 4, 5 year period was just a complete up and down turmoil.
[00:13:23] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And there'll be some things where people will say, remember that thing?
[00:13:25] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Man, we all thought that was going to be huge and it was nothing.
[00:13:27] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And everyone else being like, yeah, no one saw this thing coming and it was massive.
[00:13:30] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So I do think it is a verdant, creative kind of Cambrian experience.
[00:13:35] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And we have kind of Cambrian explosion period, which will create change.
[00:13:40] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I do think it's a time when founder driven businesses, you need to make some decisions, make some real actions.
[00:13:48] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That is certainly true.
[00:13:51] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I do think some of those decisions have been in planning for a while.
[00:13:56] You know, again, in terms of acquisitions, we acquired Loan 3 years ago now.
[00:14:03] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It was a massive acquisition. It was a bold bet.
[00:14:06] I don't think it's particularly any different than the two we've just done.
[00:14:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's done very well. It's a fantastic product, fantastic team that cranking away.
[00:14:13] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And it's been a fantastic thing for the AI era, right?
[00:14:17] Mike Cannon-Brookes: As we said at the time, acquisition, it was one of our more pressing choices.
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_00: You said there about the craziness of this time.
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: It is. And I find that quite hard because I'm looking at this as an investor going,
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: what is sustainable? What is not sustainable?
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_00: And I'm trying to assess your ability in a world of complete unknowns.
[00:14:36] How would you advise me, Mike?
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_00: Look, I think you've got some very difficult choices as an investor in the current time.
[00:14:45] Most of the things are vastly overvalued, probably true.
[00:14:49] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Some of the things will be worth far more and are undervalued.
[00:14:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And their far more is probably overweight.
[00:14:55] Mike Cannon-Brookes: All of the things that are overvalued, like as classically happens, right?
[00:14:59] Mike Cannon-Brookes: For all the dot coms that went bust, Amazon turned out to be quite a good business.
[00:15:04] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That makes it particularly hard in this era to be an investor.
[00:15:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Secondly, we aren't in an era where we have a durable business model for a lot of these things.
[00:15:13] So the old argument that, you know, some AI company, let's just call them,
[00:15:18] Mike Cannon-Brookes: give $100 million to a model company
[00:15:24] Mike Cannon-Brookes: who then give $150 million to a cloud provider,
[00:15:28] Mike Cannon-Brookes: who then gives $200 million to Nvidia by chips.
[00:15:31] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And everyone's like, look, how much revenue we've all got.
[00:15:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And you're like, yeah, but you're all like losing $50 million on the way through.
[00:15:37] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's a pretty good adage, but maybe they'll make it up in scale, right?
[00:15:41] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We all, I don't think anybody really, really knows.
[00:15:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We know that it's a foundational technology.
[00:15:46] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We know that it changes so many things.
[00:15:49] Where the monetary value and the fundamental value lies on the fire end of it,
[00:15:55] Mike Cannon-Brookes: in terms of how the business models shake up,
[00:15:58] Mike Cannon-Brookes: if you think about the search error and advertising and all these things, right?
[00:16:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't think that's known.
[00:16:03] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think anyone who tells you that they know it is probably not telling you the truth.
[00:16:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It does not mean that there isn't real value there, right?
[00:16:12] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It does mean it makes it very hard for you to be an investor.
[00:16:14] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'll agree with that.
[00:16:15] Mike Cannon-Brookes: How does that then reflect on how you behave?
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: Because you have to play the game on the field.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_00: You have to make bold bets.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_00: How does that reflect on what you do?
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_00: I think what we've tried to do is a couple of things.
[00:16:28] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Firstly, we've said for two and a half years now we need to make bets.
[00:16:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We need to make not in the same way you just used the word, sorry.
[00:16:37] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We need to make choices or opinions about how we think things are going to evolve.
[00:16:43] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But we need to be willing to change those.
[00:16:46] So we have various hunches, I would say, that we've made, that we said,
[00:16:50] Mike Cannon-Brookes: hey, we think over the next three years this is going to be what happens.
[00:16:53] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But about every quarter we reassess those sets of fundamental choices.
[00:16:58] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I can go through a bunch of them.
[00:17:00] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But I think that's one that you have to do as a business.
[00:17:02] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You have to be willing to walk away from those hunches that you have.
[00:17:05] But at the same time, you have to make them.
[00:17:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You can't be in this era of, oh, I'm not really sure what's going on in all these different areas.
[00:17:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Secondly, I think you have to listen to your customers very deeply.
[00:17:15] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Because in an era where everything's swimming around,
[00:17:19] Mike Cannon-Brookes: and there's a lot of noise, let's just say in the world about what is and isn't.
[00:17:25] Oftentimes you've got to find this stable thing, which is to go back to the customers and say,
[00:17:29] Mike Cannon-Brookes: do you feel this way?
[00:17:31] And talk to enough of them that you get internal conviction about what is or isn't happening.
[00:17:38] You've got to talk to the right customers, you've got to talk to enough of them.
[00:17:41] That is definitely true.
[00:17:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But those are the people that fund me for whatever business you're in.
[00:17:47] They will hopefully tell you and help be a rock in a storm.
[00:17:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Let's just say of change.
[00:17:55] And I think you have to make some bets in the way that you did use it.
[00:18:00] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You have to make some, take some risks and try to change your position.
[00:18:06] You said about having a thesis or a belief on a market or an evolution and then revisiting it.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_00: What belief did you have that proved to be wrong?
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_00: How so?
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_00: And what belief did you have that proved to be right?
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: I'd just love to understand one on each side of the table.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_00: We made a couple that I think are proving to be right.
[00:18:26] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't know, no, no, anyone could say that they've been proven to be right.
[00:18:29] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That's probably a little bit arrogant at the current time.
[00:18:32] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Firstly, very early on, we thought they would likely be multiple foundational models that were competing.
[00:18:38] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And hence we've built our technology to be multi model on purpose in almost every way.
[00:18:46] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And that we were not going to make foundational models.
[00:18:49] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's unlikely we'd be able to compete to train our own models.
[00:18:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: However, we have to get good at something.
[00:18:55] And what we are good at is adopting and delivering the value of that model in software to our customers very, very quickly.
[00:19:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So if you think, okay, there's going to be a new model about every three months and there's going to be four to six companies competing.
[00:19:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: What we need to be able to do is pick up a new model, test it, work out whether it's better in a certain case, deploy it and get it out to customers.
[00:19:13] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That is an expertise that we need to build and we have built.
[00:19:16] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And that's proven to be, I think, a really good bet.
[00:19:20] Mike Cannon-Brookes: A second one for us is that it's really all about design.
[00:19:24] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Yes, data is really important.
[00:19:26] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Yes, models and fundamentals and all these different things are important.
[00:19:31] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think what is underwritten is the importance of design.
[00:19:35] If you look at any lowercase D and I don't mean graphic design like how it and how it the colors.
[00:19:42] Mike Cannon-Brookes: When you have any major technological transition, we're back to an era of fundamental design.
[00:19:48] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We are rethinking entire swaths of the world.
[00:19:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: The triad example actually is pull to refresh on your phone.
[00:19:56] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We never really had this design device until we had phones and then suddenly people like, you know what?
[00:20:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: One app did it and everyone copied it because it worked really well.
[00:20:04] In AI, we're facing that very much more.
[00:20:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't believe the world will just end up as a chat box.
[00:20:10] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Otherwise, we'd all just use the terminal R computers, but it is an entry point.
[00:20:14] And so there's a lot of foundational design being done really fascinating, good design all over the place.
[00:20:19] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Even where some of it fails, like most good design, you're like, I see what they were trying to do.
[00:20:26] We have very, very heavily invested in design in the AI era.
[00:20:32] In an era where arguably software gets cheaper to create.
[00:20:37] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We can argue about that maybe, but there will certainly be far more software, probably a fairly safe assumption, far more technology.
[00:20:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: What differentiates it is probably how it feels and how it works.
[00:20:48] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And that's very hard to copy.
[00:20:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think that's another one of our big bets that we've made internally.
[00:20:57] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We've really beefed up the size, the quality, the talent on a design team, which was already pretty well classed to start with.
[00:21:03] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And really doing a lot of foundation design around delivering AI to end users and customers that don't have to understand what the words probabilistic and deterministic mean and what a model is and all these other things.
[00:21:16] When I hear you talk about the centrality of design, I think about satin as all this statement, business applications will collapse right in the agent era.
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_00: They are essentially crud databases with a bunch of business logic.
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_00: How do you feel about that reflecting on your centrality of design?
[00:21:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's very easy to make a big statements in the current era because it can't be proven wrong.
[00:21:39] Hence the statements could theoretically have some value of right.
[00:21:42] Do I believe that all business applications, maybe all applications full stop?
[00:21:47] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I guess you could argue every piece of application is just a crud piece of software.
[00:21:51] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Emails just the same thing, right?
[00:21:53] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't know if it's a business application or a consumer application.
[00:21:56] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I still believe there is a role for software to solve certain purposes.
[00:22:00] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's an old adage in enterprise software that every single piece of enterprise software can be replicated with email and Excel.
[00:22:06] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's quite true.
[00:22:08] You can do any application you want with email and Excel.
[00:22:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You can replicate any communication app.
[00:22:14] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You can replicate any business process app.
[00:22:16] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's a reason we don't all just sit there and email Excel is still very used, very popular.
[00:22:20] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But at the same time, they are not used for large scale things.
[00:22:24] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We have HRA systems and CRM systems and project management systems and lots of communication systems from Zoom and Slack and all the things.
[00:22:32] They're all very specific versions you might argue of email and Excel.
[00:22:36] But they serve a very specific purpose.
[00:22:39] Mike Cannon-Brookes: What we've seen over the last 10 years is the opposite.
[00:22:42] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We've had a Cambridge explosion of SAS apps to do more and more and more specific tasks.
[00:22:47] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But they do the task much better.
[00:22:50] I don't think we know in the AIRF all those apps just disappear into some God-like Siri agent that we just talked to.
[00:22:57] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'm not a believer in that world view.
[00:22:59] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't think it's likely to happen.
[00:23:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I do think AI is going to have to change all of those applications in massively fundamental ways.
[00:23:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That may mean some of them end up disappearing and others end up profiting.
[00:23:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I can believe in that world view.
[00:23:13] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't think that they're all just simple crud apps.
[00:23:17] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think that's usually someone talking their book.
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_00: I very much bind to, I think it's Alan Roosevelt statement that kind of bad discussions are about other people.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_00: Media-Oka ones are about events and smart discussions and good discussions about the future and ideas.
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_00: When we look forward, you said that you don't believe the chatbot is kind of the interface of AI in the future.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_00: What do you think is the interface for AI in the future with that in mind?
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_00: That's a good question.
[00:23:44] Look, I think that's what we're all trying to create.
[00:23:46] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's one of the fascinating questions around today.
[00:23:50] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's a reason why fundamental design is such an important skill and talent I would argue in the next few years, maybe forever.
[00:23:57] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But right now, it's hugely important.
[00:23:59] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think that interface is going to be probably it's safe to say far more evolutionary.
[00:24:05] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So I don't know if there will be an interface.
[00:24:08] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It might be that AI is rewriting interface.
[00:24:10] Mike Cannon-Brookes: In theory, AI can generate some code, write the code to create a new interface for every single screen you look at.
[00:24:16] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't think we'll probably see that.
[00:24:17] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It will be too discombobulating for users.
[00:24:19] Mike Cannon-Brookes: They'll get lost.
[00:24:20] Mike Cannon-Brookes: They'll be like, wait, everything's moving all the time.
[00:24:22] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If you watch users in any user study, they like knowing that I go to this button.
[00:24:26] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I click the thing and that happens and I go to this thing and that happens.
[00:24:28] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So they're going to want stability in their interfaces.
[00:24:31] Mike Cannon-Brookes: They're not going to want this dynamically changing always interface.
[00:24:34] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But we can generate new interfaces pretty quickly.
[00:24:37] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I suspect it might look a lot more like today than we think.
[00:24:43] But it will be a lot smarter.
[00:24:45] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It will do very different things and there will be a lot less click to value ratio.
[00:24:51] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There is no doubt that a lot of software requires you to click or type to indicate what you want to do a lot.
[00:25:00] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Take the other extreme prompting and writing into a text box.
[00:25:04] Mike Cannon-Brookes: At some point, my prompt gets so long to be specific to the thing I want.
[00:25:08] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'm just giving you a damn button that I can click and a slighted move in some UI interfaces.
[00:25:13] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Somewhere between the two is probably where it is.
[00:25:16] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It may be a combination of modern existing software UI and prompt based layers.
[00:25:23] Mike Cannon-Brookes: In lots of people playing with this terminology where you can customize software with a prompt.
[00:25:27] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Microsoft Word has a lot of buttons at the top of it.
[00:25:31] And you said, you know what?
[00:25:32] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I want to be able to edit a prompt in Microsoft Word that says what type of person I am and that changes the UI.
[00:25:37] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't understand the whole sum of the tool bar there.
[00:25:41] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'm just like completely lost as to what they do.
[00:25:43] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I never used them, but I'm not a lawyer.
[00:25:45] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't live in that world.
[00:25:46] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'm like, well, just turn all that stuff off because I'm going to tell you who I am and then I'm going to,
[00:25:49] Mike Cannon-Brookes: it's going to redesign the interface for me.
[00:25:51] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I can see that totally happening.
[00:25:53] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But again, this is back to all where we need fundamental design in so many of our data to applications
[00:25:58] Mike Cannon-Brookes: and what makes it such an exciting era to be building technology.
[00:26:02] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Does the democratization or the cheapening of software creation make software more or less valuable?
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_00: Does it make design more or less valuable?
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: How does it change discovery with an infinite supply?
[00:26:17] I do think it makes design more valuable.
[00:26:20] Good design.
[00:26:21] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Scars resources probably get more valuable and I think good design is quite scarce.
[00:26:27] I don't know.
[00:26:31] There's no doubt in my mind that we will create far more technology.
[00:26:35] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We often get asked this, is do you think all software developers are going away?
[00:26:39] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I said no.
[00:26:40] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I was on a panel with, or speaking right before I should say Matt from AWS.
[00:26:45] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We both violently agree that five years from now we'll have more engineers working for our company than we do today.
[00:26:50] Mike Cannon-Brookes: More software developers working for our companies.
[00:26:53] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We will create far more.
[00:26:55] Mike Cannon-Brookes: They will be more efficient.
[00:26:57] But software is technology creation is not output bound.
[00:27:04] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's like the demand supply is very off the charts.
[00:27:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: What I mean by that is we don't have a shortage of ideas for new technology that we want.
[00:27:17] Find me a software company or a technology company that gets to the end of its roadmap.
[00:27:22] Like the roadmap is unlimited in length and we will keep coming up with new ideas.
[00:27:26] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We will keep in creativity.
[00:27:27] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We will come up with new ideas for things that we want to build into our software.
[00:27:31] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Maybe crap ideas, maybe good ideas.
[00:27:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We'll have to build them and test it and see.
[00:27:36] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I like to be an optimist and think we will end up with far more technology firstly and secondly far better technology.
[00:27:43] Because I can afford if things are cheaper to build, quote unquote, or more efficient.
[00:27:48] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Maybe I can build them two or three times to get it right.
[00:27:51] Plenty of technologies built once and you kind of use it.
[00:27:54] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It doesn't really work very well but it works well enough.
[00:27:57] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And some teams somewhere was like, I got to move on.
[00:27:59] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'm out of time, I'm out of budget.
[00:28:01] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I have to move on to building something else.
[00:28:03] Maybe if they had three attempts at it, they would have made it better.
[00:28:06] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So we all live, I'm hope, with a world of better technology and far more technology.
[00:28:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's a lot of problems to go through.
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_00: I do want to jump on a lot of that.
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_00: But we see your cloudflowers, your salesforce, adopt Microsoft even, adopt vibe coding environments
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_00: that replicate a lovable or a wrap plate.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_00: Have you internally discussed doing the same with Atlassian?
[00:28:29] Do you mean using those vibe coding environments?
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_00: No, in terms of creating an environment where within in Atlassian home people can vibe code within large enterprises.
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_00: Sure. I'm in Barcelona and we're launching one at the moment.
[00:28:42] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So yes. I don't think this is going live in the next 24 hours, so that's fine.
[00:28:47] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Yes. There's no doubt that that's there.
[00:28:49] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But again, it's about focusing on this.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: What was the thought process behind that?
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_00: Because you've got to then believe that vibe coding is a category will be a sustainable and enduring category in software creation.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_00: Do you believe that?
[00:29:03] It might depend on a definition of vibe coding.
[00:29:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I believe that there is a large group of people who we may or may not call software developers,
[00:29:14] who will want to be able to create technology of a certain quality or level or that meets a certain set of standards.
[00:29:22] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Maybe the design standard software security standards, whatever it is.
[00:29:26] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I'm not sure whether we'll call these people software engineers.
[00:29:30] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't think it really matters.
[00:29:31] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I think it becomes one of these annoyingly not useful debates.
[00:29:35] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If you ask me in Atlassian, I will end up with far more generalists.
[00:29:40] Mike Cannon-Brookes: People, I will end up with a wider organization.
[00:29:43] And people will do far more things and their jobs will hopefully be more fulfilling because of it.
[00:29:48] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I will have people in finance who are quote unquote vibe coding and application to solve a financial problem for themselves.
[00:29:56] Where previously they might have tried with Excel or they might have filed a ticket with IT or they just wouldn't have bothered.
[00:30:01] They're writing Python code to do crazy complex analysis.
[00:30:05] Mike Cannon-Brookes: The cost of that code is so small that they maybe do it three or four times.
[00:30:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: They throw it away. It didn't work.
[00:30:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That is not what I would argue is software development.
[00:30:14] That is a financial professional who's trying to get their job done and has a new set of tools to go get it done.
[00:30:19] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Marketers making websites.
[00:30:21] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You might argue is kind of the same thing.
[00:30:23] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There's lots of these examples where it's like people whose job wouldn't say I'm a developer, but I'm now making technology.
[00:30:28] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That's a great thing.
[00:30:30] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I don't think it means there's less role for the core technologists to do.
[00:30:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: In fact, they're probably building more and more platforms.
[00:30:36] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So we are trying to build in our for our maker audience.
[00:30:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Again, we have a huge community of app vendors and creators and customers who make technology apps that run on top of the Alassian platform.
[00:30:54] We want to help them make high quality applications that solve business problems on top of the Alassian platform at the lowest cost possible.
[00:31:02] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Now, you can do that by writing code for a very complex application that does a lot of things.
[00:31:07] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Or you might vibe code something really simple.
[00:31:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If by vibe coding, you mean largely writing prompts and spitting out an application.
[00:31:13] Mike Cannon-Brookes: If it fits into the design language of Alassian and it runs well and it's secure and it's compliant, that's great.
[00:31:19] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It'll probably mean our customers make, I think, far more apps or more apps per customer than they ever did beforehand.
[00:31:27] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But a lot of them maybe they're thrown away, right?
[00:31:29] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And that's okay. That's fine. That's great.
[00:31:31] Mike Cannon-Brookes: So there's going to be a big spectrum.
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_00: The spectrum is a ball ball in some respects between what we wouldn't consider traditionally developers and then the really valuable engineers and developers.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: The question becomes, you said we will have more software engineers.
[00:31:46] Will we have the entry level?
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_00: Will we have the kids studying CS who come in and they're decent, but they're definitely not a 10X engineer and they're not specialists.
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_00: What does the future look like for them?
[00:32:00] I think we'll have far more of them.
[00:32:03] Maybe that's a bold bit.
[00:32:06] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We're hiring more grads this year than we did last year.
[00:32:09] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We want to do the year before.
[00:32:11] Mike Cannon-Brookes: In some ways, look, if you think about it's purely an economic question, which is dangerous when it comes to talent, if someone was going to be a 10X engineer 10 years ago, I would argue that person is probably still a 10X engineer today.
[00:32:22] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Maybe there are 100X engineer because they've got all these new tools, right?
[00:32:27] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That's probably down to the person, their learning style, their ability to ingest information and how they solve problems, etc.
[00:32:34] Maybe the average engineer is going to be a 10X engineer and those 10X engineers are now 100X engineers.
[00:32:40] It will come down to how they solve those problems, firstly.
[00:32:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Secondly, I still have a bandwidth constraint of the number of people I have in R&D and engineering to build the ideas that the business could profitably build.
[00:32:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: That is still a constraint and I think will be I believe forever, but it's certainly a constraint that we've lived with for a long time.
[00:32:58] Mike Cannon-Brookes: It's not going away today.
[00:33:00] Lastly, we've seen this with LUM, fascinatingly, in a very different context.
[00:33:05] There's a good chance that those graduates come in with a different view on what it means to be a software developer and shake up the existing world of talent in a positive way for my business, where the existing talent either figures out, man, these graduates are doing things better than me.
[00:33:22] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I better copy that or maybe I should go to something else, right?
[00:33:26] Mike Cannon-Brookes: The reason I say we saw this with LUM is one of the ways that LUM gets into businesses, LUM being a video and communications tool, is through graduates, because young people coming into businesses use a lot of business tools and I like, man, this is so inefficient.
[00:33:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Young people that ticked Toc Snapchat generation, I can't count myself unfortunately in that generation, I don't think anymore.
[00:33:50] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I've never really understood Snapchat, but I try.
[00:33:54] They are natively used to FaceTime and video calls and voice notes.
[00:33:59] Mike Cannon-Brookes: This is a very common communication factor for them that maybe you might argue someone has been in the workforce for 44 years, is not used to.
[00:34:06] Mike Cannon-Brookes: When they come into a business and they use LUM to communicate, the business goes, man, those people are more productive.
[00:34:14] Mike Cannon-Brookes: The entire business starts communicating that way or a majority of it becomes a norm in a standard, right? Because they come in with a different expectation.
[00:34:21] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I do wonder if the grads, if you're a grad today, say you're half way through your university degree, you're about to finish a computer science.
[00:34:28] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You're surely using all of the coding AI assistants and everything else.
[00:34:33] Mike Cannon-Brookes: You are hyper productive compared to what a grad would have been 10 years ago. You're going to go into a business. That business is going to say, well, that talent is amazing.
[00:34:40] I need to do more like that. They're going to bring in those skills to businesses.
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_00: Can I ask you, when you look at the engineering team stay in Atlassian, what are the dominant tools that have changed productivity meaningfully?
[00:34:52] Mike Cannon-Brookes: I have to talk my own book, but Rover Search.
[00:34:57] Look, we use our own tool, Rover Dev. We have many, many code creation tools. We use Rover Dev. We use Curse, we use Copilot.
[00:35:05] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We use a lot of things. We've been very liberal. They're quite cheap these tools.
[00:35:09] Would you pay 10X the price of those tools?
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_00: No, probably not. I mean, maybe 10 times a point.
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_00: I've asked 10 CEOs this at least, and you're the only one who said no.
[00:35:21] Because I think the competitive vector between them is not going to let you do that, firstly.
[00:35:27] In terms of switching costs. One of them charged 10X, you just switched to the other one.
[00:35:31] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Secondly, they're all good at different things. So there's a reason our engineers have access to all of them.
[00:35:37] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And they choose to pick up a tool for certain reasons. Sometimes it's preference.
[00:35:41] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Sometimes it's for the task at hand or the type of thing they're trying to do.
[00:35:45] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Most of them are pretty good at Greenfield development. I'm blank and I want to start something.
[00:35:50] Some of them are very bad at long form. I want to manipulate this piece of code across 500 repositories around my organization.
[00:35:56] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Some of them are very bad at ingesting a large code base. And they will all get better at different things.
[00:36:00] Mike Cannon-Brookes: But there will be like anything preferences and styles and strengths of weaknesses.
[00:36:06] Secondly, coding is a pretty small part of a software developer's job.
[00:36:10] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Different surveys, 10%, 20%, 30% of the week is spent writing code.
[00:36:15] You might argue in the best companies it's close to 50% of the week spent writing code.
[00:36:21] Mike Cannon-Brookes: There are meetings and finding things and finding people and finding APIs and understanding the code base.
[00:36:28] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Search is probably about the same amount of time as writing code for most software developers as a professional.
[00:36:35] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Debugging, quote unquote, at the large scale.
[00:36:39] Something's gone wrong in production, getting an alert and error.
[00:36:42] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Okay, let's figure out what's going on.
[00:36:44] Mike Cannon-Brookes: Yes, there will be AI tools for that as well. There are plenty of AI obstacles.
[00:36:47] Mike Cannon-Brookes: We sell one. There are many others that are trying to help you with the operation of software, the running of systems and services.
[00:36:53] Mike Cannon-Brookes: And I think that will get even more because if you have found the right solution,
