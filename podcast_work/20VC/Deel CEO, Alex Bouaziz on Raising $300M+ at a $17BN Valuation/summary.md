# [Podcast Summary: Alex Bouaziz, CEO of Deel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk)

## 1. Key Themes

### Building Wartime Resilience Through Profitable Growth
Deel has maintained profitability for three years while executing aggressive M&A and scaling globally. Alex stated: "I think I'm in constant war time, sadly. September was our first 100 million revenue month, which is a very exciting milestone for the business." [[00:00:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=0s) This approach has proven critical during their litigation with Rippling, where their financial strength sent a clear market signal. Alex noted: "I think this round, this new investors are bored as always being with us, kind of shows for where we stand as a company towards this type of mitigations." [[00:00:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=4s)

### M&A as Core Growth Engine - The Unconventional Playbook
With 13 acquisitions completed, Deel has developed a unique integration strategy. Alex explained their approach: "We basically bring the product, rebuild all of the front end inside of Deel, why being connected to the back end of the current company. And that happens in like two months...In parallel, we're rebuilding the full back end of the product inside of Deel natively." [[00:45:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=45m44s) Their most successful acquisition, Payspace (over $100M), accelerated their payroll infrastructure development by 5-10 years. The key principle from Alex's father: "The only way to get a great deal done if both parties come out of the equation five years later saying we're happy this deal was actually happened." [[00:48:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=47m55s)

### Brand Marketing as the Next Frontier for B2B Infrastructure
Despite generating $100M+ monthly revenue, Deel is pivoting to brand awareness. Alex candidly admitted: "The thing about brand marketing is I actually don't know the subject well enough." [[00:31:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=31m45s) He drew parallels to Revolut's evolution: "Nick is my favorite founder...when I look at deal and growth over the next few years, the only way for us to be what I think we can be, which is a hundred billion dollar plus company that truly changes how I tried and pay always perceive...is for a brand to be aligned and for the brand to be much more known." [[00:29:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=29m6s)

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### CMOs Should Be Engineers, Not Traditional Marketers
Alex shared insights from board member Ben Horowitz: "In his mind, most chief marketing officers are not good. The truth is, I actually agree with him...the best CMOs have encountered of the last few years are the ones that are just able to be so much more first principle into understanding what's going on and going really deep into the data instead of being super superficial. And you don't usually get that from a traditional CMO background. So like the contrary, since me and him have kind of developed is that your CMO should be an engineer." [[00:26:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=26m19s) He cited the best example as "Alex Schultz from Meta. He's also the VP of analytics...He is this unicorn of he's an artist visionary creative with an engineer analytics growth engine." [[00:27:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=26m57s)

### Geographic Diversification Should Start Early, Not After Product-Market Fit
Contrary to conventional wisdom about focus, Alex advocates: "One move we did pretty early on is higher salespeople in different Geos pretty early on just to understand the market. So instead of having like a lot of salespeople just in one country, like hiring a few salespeople into other countries and kind of say like go and figure it out was really helpful for us." [[00:41:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=41m39s) Despite Harry pushing back on defocusing concerns, Alex maintained: "I don't think having one person running around when you're like 10 people, 20 people trying to sell something is defocusing." [[00:42:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=42m38s)

### Raising at the Highest Price Isn't Always Optimal
When asked if founders should always raise at the highest price, Alex said: "No, because I think I mean, there is a very valuable option...And it depends what you want in life. And it depends how big your business is actually going to be." [[00:22:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=22m16s) This contradicts the prevailing wisdom in venture-backed startups, showing maturity about long-term business building over short-term valuation optimization.

### Build vs. Buy Timing - Earlier Than Most Think
Alex identified his biggest mistake: "I think we under invested in our internal tools and processes...the moment that which we should have started should have been a lot earlier. Because when we knew we were on the path of like we know where we're going, we can start making longer investments and longer bets." [[00:37:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=36m58s) His trigger point: "A couple hundred percent year on your growth, press profitability is a good sign when we started years." [[00:37:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=37m15s)

### Pro-Rata Rights Should Be Earned, Not Guaranteed
Alex firmly stated: "I think pro-rata should be earned." [[00:22:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=22m8s) This challenges the standard VC expectation of automatic pro-rata rights in subsequent rounds, suggesting investors must add value to maintain their position.

## 3. Companies Identified

### **Payspace** (Acquired for over $100M)
South African payroll infrastructure company - most impactful acquisition. "They basically had been building the payroll infrastructure we wanted to build for the last few years...15 year old business, three brothers and one brother from another mother...They had built payroll infrastructure that could scale in multiple countries because they were forced into it from the get go." [[00:53:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=53m24s) Alex called it "probably the Instagram to our Facebook" [[00:55:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=55m43s) and noted it fast-tracked their payroll engine development by 5-10 years.

### **Hofy** (Harry Stebbings portfolio company)
IT asset management company acquired by Deel. "We acquire the Huffy, for example, a company you invested in, which is doing amazing for us. It's grown almost 100% year-on-year." [[00:40:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=40m27s) Alex predicted: "I actually think it will be a 10 billion AR company." [[00:44:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=44m30s)

### **Revolut**
Alex cited Nick Storonsky as "my favorite founder. Probably the person I look up to the most in many different ways." [[00:29:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=28m52s) He learned from Nick's approach to treating Revolut "like an incubation unit for new product testing...26, 27 new product bets where he gives people a two million bucks a year." [[00:48:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=48m40s)

### **Klarna**
Alex mentioned Sebastian from Klarna as instrumental in their knowledge base strategy: "Sebastian, actually from Clarina, who is thinking about AI 24/seven and probably one of the sharpest mine in terms of like integrating AI into your business...he came to me and he said, you know, I'm actually building our own knowledge base inside of a week EGS internally." [[00:34:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=34m42s)

### **Airwallex**
Referenced as an example of a great business not getting enough attention: "I love Jack too...the business is like one of the best businesses that I don't think people know enough about. But because it's not in my...And it's like, it's kind of a mix...Because as a founder, you want to be super focused on your business. But if you look at Jack's growth, it's like outstanding." [[00:06:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=6m40s)

### **Kalshi**
Alex praised founder Tariq: "I would have said Tariq a year ago from Kalshi...He was one of the most underrated funders I ever knew. And then the guy just turned the heat around like fucking crazy." [[00:38:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=38m22s)

### **Kry** (Swedish healthcare)
Founded by Johannes: "He's one of the most underrated funders I've met...he's the right mix of clear finger first principle and at the same time relentless. And he's got that like hands on fire that someone that has built a 4,000 plus people company." [[00:59:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=59m5s)

## 4. Operating Insights

### The Knowledge Base as Competitive Moat
Deel built a proprietary knowledge base with "20,000 articles and 70,000 different data points changing every year" [[00:34:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=34m18s) covering global employment, benefits, and payroll. Alex called it "probably one of the best investments in the word we could have ever done because like every single time you come and talk to us, we're able to get the right data almost straight away about the very specific use case." [[00:35:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=35m9s) This infrastructure enables AI applications without hallucination risks.

### Cross-Sell Overlay Model for Product Expansion
To solve the verticalization vs. cross-sell dilemma, Deel uses: "We basically have what we call our cross-sales people and they sell the product that we feel are fully mastered inside of the company...And then we have what we call those over-latives...that is brought by the core of your team when this is an interesting product for the customers." [[00:40:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=40m2s) This allows specialized selling while building toward full integration: "Some of your product become mature enough...that you can bring some of those products into the core team." [[00:41:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=40m58s)

### Aggressive Integration Timeline Reveals Acquisition Quality
Alex emphasized: "Integration, we didn't talk about this, is the most important part of doing M&A really well...If there's reluctance from many parts of the business to integrate, it probably means that it was bad acquisition." [[00:57:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=57m27s) Their integration playbook gets sales teams selling acquired products within 2 months while rebuilding backend infrastructure in parallel over 3-12 months.

### Building Internal Infrastructure Over SaaS at Scale
Alex cited the example of building their own CRM system: "Over the last year, we built our own GRI like product internally...being able to write your own tickets is very critical. And like no software is really agile enough to be able to do this." [[00:36:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=36m13s) The result: "Automatically create the right ticket, automatically routing it to the right person and cutting the time at like 90% in terms of resolution." [[00:36:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=36m34s) The principle: "That only comes from being able to build a lot of your internal infrastructure. And is the dumbest thing to do when you're small. But it's the smartest thing to do, I think as your scale." [[00:36:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=36m47s)

## 5. Overlooked Insights

### The Secondary Buyback Signal as Competitive Intelligence
A brief but significant comment: "We've been buying every single secondary on the market every single time they could. So a lot of people were kind of looking at us, like announcing one billion in the hour and being like, what's going on there? We don't really understand it." [[00:06:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=6m11s) This reveals Deel systematically bought back shares at $1B+ valuation during their "quiet period" from 2021-2024, indicating extraordinary confidence in their metrics when others couldn't see them. This is a powerful signal that most observers missed - a company buying its own stock aggressively while profitable and growing fast is the ultimate insider vote of confidence.

### The 60% Revenue from Expansion/Cross-Sell Metric
Almost casually mentioned: "60% of our revenue actually comes from cross-out today. So, so Cross-Sale is actually a big part of what we do. Well, expansion, Cross-Sale and expansion as well for our customers." [[00:39:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPG52e3xwCk&t=39m37s) This is an extraordinary retention/expansion metric that suggests incredibly strong unit economics and product-market fit across their platform. Most SaaS companies struggle to get net retention above 120-130%; having 60% of revenue from expansion implies something closer to 160%+ NDR, which is world-class and rarely discussed in the interview.

**Overall Assessment**: Alex demonstrates unusual operational maturity for a founder of his age, combining aggressive growth (13 acquisitions, expanding to 150+ countries) with financial discipline (3 years profitable). His willingness to challenge conventional wisdom (early geo expansion, CMOs as engineers, earned pro-rata) while maintaining relationships (fair M&A deals, keeping founders happy) suggests a sophisticated understanding of long-term value creation over short-term optimization. The $17B+ valuation at $1.2B+ ARR (14x multiple) with continued profitability positions Deel as a potential decacorn outcome in global employment infrastructure.
