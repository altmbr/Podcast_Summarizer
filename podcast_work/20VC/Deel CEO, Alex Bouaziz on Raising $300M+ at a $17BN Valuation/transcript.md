[00:00:00] I feel pretty confident that the same way we've been winning in the marketplace
[00:00:02] Alex Bouaziz: we'll win in the quarter of lose, we just need to play that.
[00:00:05] Alex Bouaziz: I think I'm in constant war time, sadly.
[00:00:07] Alex Bouaziz: September was our first 100 million revenue month,
[00:00:09] Alex Bouaziz: which is a very exciting milestone for the business.
[00:00:11] Alex Bouaziz: This round, this new investors are bored as always
[00:00:14] Alex Bouaziz: being with us, kind of shows for where we stand as a company
[00:00:17] Alex Bouaziz: towards this type of mitigations.
[00:00:19] Ready to go?
[00:00:30] Alex, dude, it has been like three years.
[00:00:34] Harry Stebbings: It's been a while since we last sat down and chatted on the show.
[00:00:38] Harry Stebbings: You've been actually working really hard
[00:00:40] Harry Stebbings: instead of talking to podcasters like me.
[00:00:42] Harry Stebbings: But thank you for agreeing to do this, man.
[00:00:45] Harry Stebbings: Well, thank you for having me.
[00:00:46] Alex Bouaziz: We actually did a stage together, not too long ago,
[00:00:49] Alex Bouaziz: right in Paris, or something like that.
[00:00:50] Alex Bouaziz: I was actually pissed about that.
[00:00:52] Harry Stebbings: You know why?
[00:00:53] Harry Stebbings: Because you were so good, and we didn't have it recorded.
[00:00:56] Harry Stebbings: And I actually wanted to use it for a podcast.
[00:00:59] Harry Stebbings: And the team, well, I know this was an apocos session, Harry.
[00:01:02] Harry Stebbings: I'm like, damn it, we missed a chance to put some great ads in.
[00:01:05] Harry Stebbings: Fuck that.
[00:01:06] Harry Stebbings: Well, I'm very excited to do this with you.
[00:01:08] Alex Bouaziz: It's been a while.
[00:01:09] Alex Bouaziz: And thank you for being a great friend and amazing.
[00:01:12] Alex Bouaziz: Dude, you've got some exciting news.
[00:01:14] Harry Stebbings: So I'm going to start with the exciting news.
[00:01:16] Harry Stebbings: What is the exciting news that we've got today?
[00:01:19] Yes.
[00:01:20] Alex Bouaziz: Well, it's been a while actually since we've raised primary money.
[00:01:23] Alex Bouaziz: We did a small round in, I think, 2023.
[00:01:26] Alex Bouaziz: But since then, I think the last time we raised significant primary capital was in 2021.
[00:01:31] Alex Bouaziz: So I think the big news for us is we're actually going to announce around
[00:01:34] Alex Bouaziz: of over $300 million at over $17 billion plus evaluation.
[00:01:38] Alex Bouaziz: So it's going to be a big deal for us.
[00:01:40] Alex Bouaziz: And we're super excited to share that with the rest of the world.
[00:01:43] Alex Bouaziz: And actually the company, because you're getting there,
[00:01:45] Alex Bouaziz: you're getting this a bit early.
[00:01:46] Alex Bouaziz: Dude, I'm thrilled and honored.
[00:01:49] Harry Stebbings: Really, I was so touched when you said, you know, we could do this.
[00:01:52] Harry Stebbings: Over 300 at over 17.
[00:01:54] Harry Stebbings: Who's doing the round?
[00:01:56] Harry Stebbings: So I'm genuinely so excited about our investors.
[00:02:00] Alex Bouaziz: So it's actually co-led by three investors.
[00:02:03] Alex Bouaziz: The first one is Rubit Capital, which is our new investor.
[00:02:06] Alex Bouaziz: It's actually the first time that they invest into deal.
[00:02:08] Alex Bouaziz: And maybe we'll talk about this after.
[00:02:10] Alex Bouaziz: But I've been, I actually love the team there.
[00:02:13] Alex Bouaziz: I've been trying to get them to invest into deal for
[00:02:16] Alex Bouaziz: since our series, AIFA and Galaxy.
[00:02:18] Alex Bouaziz: And then by our amazing and long-standing investors
[00:02:21] Alex Bouaziz: from Andreessen Horowitz and Kwa Tu.
[00:02:24] Alex Bouaziz: So both of them actually are co-led in this round.
[00:02:27] I got you.
[00:02:28] Harry Stebbings: By the way, I love Rubit dearly.
[00:02:30] Harry Stebbings: Nick and Mickey are some of my favorites.
[00:02:32] Harry Stebbings: Three great investors there.
[00:02:34] Harry Stebbings: Dude, massive congrats.
[00:02:35] Harry Stebbings: Why was now the time to do it, by the way?
[00:02:37] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, and it's quite interesting,
[00:02:39] Alex Bouaziz: because deal has been a profitable company for three years now.
[00:02:42] Alex Bouaziz: So we've been generating cash, which is always a great thing to do.
[00:02:46] Alex Bouaziz: And we have a needed investment for quite a long time.
[00:02:49] Alex Bouaziz: I think there's a couple of things here that were very critical for us.
[00:02:52] Alex Bouaziz: First, we've been pretty aggressive on the M&A front.
[00:02:57] Alex Bouaziz: I think we've done about 13 acquisition,
[00:02:59] Alex Bouaziz: which really helped us grow really fast.
[00:03:01] Alex Bouaziz: Build new products, bring amazing funders in,
[00:03:04] Alex Bouaziz: and really kind of take over a big part of the global payroll market share.
[00:03:08] Alex Bouaziz: So bringing in from new fresh capital,
[00:03:10] Alex Bouaziz: and resetting the valuation is also something that's important
[00:03:13] Alex Bouaziz: to the actual value of the company.
[00:03:15] Alex Bouaziz: The second part is, like I was telling you,
[00:03:17] Alex Bouaziz: I think, Mickey and Nick are some of the best investors in the world.
[00:03:21] Alex Bouaziz: I wanted them involved in the business for a very long time.
[00:03:25] Alex Bouaziz: Then wanting to invest with the Qatud team,
[00:03:27] Alex Bouaziz: with the 16z team was a great opportunity.
[00:03:30] Alex Bouaziz: And it just made sense to go for it when they came with the offer.
[00:03:35] Dude, I would be in trouble from the Twitter sphere.
[00:03:39] Harry Stebbings: If I didn't progress this conversation,
[00:03:42] Harry Stebbings: and say there was obviously a lot of publicity around the replaying story,
[00:03:48] Harry Stebbings: was the latest with the long-standing litigation with Reappling?
[00:03:52] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, so obviously I can talk about ongoing mitigations.
[00:03:56] Alex Bouaziz: I think it's unfortunate that the way they're trying to compute
[00:03:59] Alex Bouaziz: is through media and through headlines and things like that.
[00:04:02] Alex Bouaziz: But I think the thing that really matters is how the business has been growing.
[00:04:07] Alex Bouaziz: Actually, we're going to announce as well that September was our first 100 million revenue
[00:04:11] Alex Bouaziz: month, which is a very exciting milestone for the business.
[00:04:14] Alex Bouaziz: And I think this round, this new investors,
[00:04:18] Alex Bouaziz: our board has always been with us,
[00:04:19] Alex Bouaziz: kind of shows for where we stand as a company
[00:04:22] Alex Bouaziz: towards this type of litigation.
[00:04:23] Alex Bouaziz: And we're looking forward on building for our customers and being focused on delivering.
[00:04:30] It's so hard, dude, because I just have questions that come up
[00:04:34] Harry Stebbings: and made a conversation.
[00:04:36] Harry Stebbings: I'm like, oh, I'm getting in trouble with this.
[00:04:38] Harry Stebbings: Do you ever feel like you are chastised for not being a valley company?
[00:04:42] Harry Stebbings: And what I mean by that is that Reappling have the Silicon Valley illuminati around them.
[00:04:46] Harry Stebbings: And in the same way for me,
[00:04:48] Harry Stebbings: like there are some media companies, which I'm not going to name because they'll hate me for it.
[00:04:52] Harry Stebbings: But like, they just have the Silicon Valley, the Colossans and the YCs around them,
[00:04:56] Harry Stebbings: which annoying them.
[00:04:58] Harry Stebbings: And I feel chastised for not being there and not being in their circles.
[00:05:03] Harry Stebbings: Do you feel the Reappling in a circle and deal outside of it?
[00:05:06] Harry Stebbings: So I think I can't really come in on Reappling.
[00:05:09] Alex Bouaziz: I would say that
[00:05:11] Alex Bouaziz: we're kind of in the middle.
[00:05:13] Alex Bouaziz: You know, we're not, I'm not a Silicon Valley based founder,
[00:05:16] Alex Bouaziz: but we do have a way to combine it as an investor.
[00:05:19] Alex Bouaziz: Right? They were one of our early backers.
[00:05:21] Alex Bouaziz: So I would say that there is advantages into being in the valley.
[00:05:25] Alex Bouaziz: Right? I think seeing a lot of people and them understanding the business very thoroughly is very important.
[00:05:31] Alex Bouaziz: I think a good example for us is looking at deal from outside of the valley.
[00:05:36] Alex Bouaziz: You know, a lot of people, we kind of went, you know,
[00:05:39] Alex Bouaziz: you're the hero until you kind of become the villain and then back to the hero story
[00:05:42] Alex Bouaziz: because people were kind of looking at us thinking,
[00:05:45] Alex Bouaziz: hmm, they're growing so fast. It's so amazing.
[00:05:46] Alex Bouaziz: They're growing so fast. It's so amazing.
[00:05:48] Alex Bouaziz: Hard, they're growing so fast, right?
[00:05:50] Alex Bouaziz: And like, if you're not in the valley and people don't understand you,
[00:05:53] Alex Bouaziz: they can, you know, have a lot of questions.
[00:05:55] Alex Bouaziz: And, you know, if you're not there to answer them,
[00:05:57] Alex Bouaziz: you're not in the psych conversation.
[00:05:58] Alex Bouaziz: It's a bit harder.
[00:05:59] Alex Bouaziz: Not that it matters to be honest, because it hasn't mattered to us.
[00:06:02] Alex Bouaziz: Actually, I think a good learning for me is
[00:06:05] Alex Bouaziz: pros and cons on this. I'm not 100% sure how I feel towards it.
[00:06:09] Alex Bouaziz: But the fact that we didn't raise money since 2021,
[00:06:13] Alex Bouaziz: if you were not really counting 2023,
[00:06:15] Alex Bouaziz: it means that actually didn't spend a lot of time with investors.
[00:06:18] Alex Bouaziz: So no one actually knew our numbers apart from our shareholders.
[00:06:21] Alex Bouaziz: We've been buying every single secondary on the market every single time they could.
[00:06:26] Alex Bouaziz: So a lot of people were kind of looking at us,
[00:06:28] Alex Bouaziz: like announcing one billion in the hour and being like,
[00:06:31] Alex Bouaziz: what's going on there? We don't really understand it.
[00:06:33] Alex Bouaziz: So, you know, it was, having maybe that would have been a good learning
[00:06:36] Alex Bouaziz: opportunity to spending more time with investors on my side,
[00:06:38] Alex Bouaziz: just that they really understand how fast we're growing
[00:06:40] Alex Bouaziz: and why we're actually growing, which is the most important part.
[00:06:43] I see it with one of our companies, also Air Wallix,
[00:06:46] Harry Stebbings: which is an incredible business.
[00:06:47] Harry Stebbings: I don't know.
[00:06:48] Harry Stebbings: I love Jack too.
[00:06:50] Harry Stebbings: And the business is like one of the best businesses that I don't think people know enough about.
[00:06:54] Harry Stebbings: But because it's not in my...
[00:06:56] Harry Stebbings: I'm not sure.
[00:06:56] Harry Stebbings: And it's like, it's kind of a mix, right?
[00:06:58] Alex Bouaziz: Because as a founder, you want to be super focused on your business.
[00:07:01] Alex Bouaziz: But if you look at Jack's growth, it's like outstanding, right?
[00:07:04] Alex Bouaziz: And you're thinking, okay, like it's an Australian founder and not based in the value.
[00:07:08] Alex Bouaziz: How is this business growing as fast when some similar businesses in the US are not growing
[00:07:11] Alex Bouaziz: as fast?
[00:07:12] Alex Bouaziz: And I think there is value into actually spending time educating investors
[00:07:16] Alex Bouaziz: that maybe your investors of tomorrow, especially if you go public eventually as well.
[00:07:20] Alex Bouaziz: So I'd say that that was maybe a small mistake we made where the fact that we've been profitable
[00:07:25] Alex Bouaziz: kind of like made us not go out in the market as much.
[00:07:29] Can I ask you, in terms of lessons, if we're honest, what have you learned about playing
[00:07:34] Harry Stebbings: offense versus defense in terms of going through this public dispute as a CEO?
[00:07:41] Again, I didn't pay attention too much to it because I knew I know where we stand,
[00:07:45] Alex Bouaziz: I know the facts.
[00:07:46] Alex Bouaziz: And I think having our board behind us has been really helpful.
[00:07:50] Alex Bouaziz: I think it's always interesting, right?
[00:07:52] Alex Bouaziz: Like this wartime versus Pistime CEO concept as well, right?
[00:07:56] Alex Bouaziz: Funnily enough, Ben is like my board member.
[00:07:59] Alex Bouaziz: I spend a lot of time with him, so it's always amazing to learn from him.
[00:08:02] Alex Bouaziz: I think there is moments where you need to understand where you're strong and where you're not strong,
[00:08:07] Alex Bouaziz: right? Like which fields do you play in?
[00:08:08] Alex Bouaziz: When do you play your hands and how do you do it?
[00:08:10] Alex Bouaziz: We took an approach that really worked for us, which is like focus on what we know how to do best,
[00:08:16] Alex Bouaziz: focus on like navigating the stories in the places that are important for us and telling our truth.
[00:08:20] Alex Bouaziz: And I think that was the best thing to do.
[00:08:22] Alex Bouaziz: There's still a lot of work to be done, to be very honest with you.
[00:08:24] Alex Bouaziz: And I'm pretty, you know, I feel pretty confident that the same way we've been winning in the
[00:08:29] Alex Bouaziz: marketplace, we'll win in the quarter of a row, so it's just we just need to play it out.
[00:08:32] Alex Bouaziz: I do think one interesting thing, which I was telling you about, is like, I've learned a lot
[00:08:36] Alex Bouaziz: about the media as well. It's like, you know, I've never really looked at it from this eyes,
[00:08:41] Alex Bouaziz: but you see like those big tech journals that are kind of going and like making up stories for
[00:08:47] Alex Bouaziz: clicks, which you know, when I was a bit younger or maybe like an early stage funder, like, you know,
[00:08:53] Alex Bouaziz: our dream was to get on like some of those articles, right? And like when you see the things that
[00:08:58] Alex Bouaziz: they can publish with unnamed sources that are completely false, with no retractions and
[00:09:03] Alex Bouaziz: things like that, you kind of start thinking that in many ways there's something super broken
[00:09:07] Alex Bouaziz: about media and I'm looking forward to someone solving that problem really.
[00:09:11] Alex Bouaziz: Did you flee to Dubai?
[00:09:14] Alex Bouaziz: No, I'm very happy living in Tel Aviv and I've been living here for the last five years,
[00:09:18] Alex Bouaziz: you know, you can come visit. You say you don't really think about it. Do you really not?
[00:09:23] Harry Stebbings: And you said like you go through here or villain here? When you're villain, do you really not?
[00:09:28] Harry Stebbings: It hurts me when I have shit about me and it's nothing compared to what you got.
[00:09:32] Harry Stebbings: No, of course, I mean, you know, the person that gets a bit more pissed is maybe my wife because
[00:09:36] Alex Bouaziz: she reads some of the stories and she's like, I know that's not true. I know that's not true,
[00:09:39] Alex Bouaziz: which is kind of like funny. On my side, I try my best not to write always because there's so
[00:09:45] Alex Bouaziz: many things that are happening in the business. Our customers give us our trust and they understand
[00:09:48] Alex Bouaziz: where we're going. I think a lot of the facts also make it a lot easier to explain many of the things
[00:09:54] Alex Bouaziz: that are being said and are not true. So I don't think about it. I definitely don't think about
[00:10:00] Alex Bouaziz: as much as maybe in March, right? When I had to deal with like the early stage of the litigation,
[00:10:04] Alex Bouaziz: but now it's like old school, old news for us until we really can beat it out in the court of
[00:10:08] Alex Bouaziz: the low. So I think I'm being rigorous enough where I try to focus on my customers because that's
[00:10:14] Alex Bouaziz: the only way, right? And if anything, I think it's proven to be the right way of dealing with it
[00:10:19] Alex Bouaziz: and we've been able to really grow in the last two quarters, which actually shows for an amazing
[00:10:23] Alex Bouaziz: resilience of the business as well, right? I think you actually mastered the comm strategy in a
[00:10:28] Harry Stebbings: very different world. And I don't know if this was a very, I'm sure it was delivered and so it's
[00:10:32] Harry Stebbings: true. But when you think about the cadence of comms today, when OpenAI gets a $100 billion
[00:10:37] Harry Stebbings: or investment from Nvidia, it's super interesting for 30 minutes. And then it's like, what next?
[00:10:42] Harry Stebbings: And the speed of news cycles is so fast, the best way to get over something is to say nothing.
[00:10:47] Harry Stebbings: The worst thing to do is to start a response. And then it becomes something that's a
[00:10:52] Harry Stebbings: desperately bad mistake. Yeah, there's different ways of dealing with this in general. I think my stance
[00:10:58] Alex Bouaziz: is, you know, when I feel right in my shoes and I know what I'm doing and know where we're going,
[00:11:03] Alex Bouaziz: there is no point in trying to fight useless battles, right? Like, let's win in the court of law,
[00:11:08] Alex Bouaziz: let's put this behind us just like, you know, I don't know if you saw, but we had something in January,
[00:11:13] Alex Bouaziz: a similar lawsuit that we believe came from a similar company and you know, putting that to bed was
[00:11:20] Alex Bouaziz: the best way of showing that we know what we're doing and we're doing great. So I spoke to many of
[00:11:24] Harry Stebbings: your ambassadors before. Yeah, honestly, it was super lovely because I know most of them already.
[00:11:31] Harry Stebbings: But like, Yasmin and Nish, many more. And they all said that you're the most hands-on CEO that they
[00:11:37] Harry Stebbings: work with. And dude, like, I introduced you to a project Europe company for context. This is like
[00:11:45] Harry Stebbings: two, three teenagers building an amazing business. And I'm like, who should I introduce some to on
[00:11:49] Harry Stebbings: your team? And you're like, me? And I'm like, no, no, no, this is like a junior A job, no disrespect
[00:11:55] Harry Stebbings: to junior A's, but like, you're the only CEO who would be that hands-on. Let me and they said,
[00:12:00] Harry Stebbings: you're the most hands-on CEO they work with. How do you respond when you think about how hands-on you
[00:12:07] Harry Stebbings: are and your approach? So I think being hands-on is very critical for the business as you grow. I
[00:12:13] Alex Bouaziz: think the worst mistake you can make as the company's scale is to be too far away from the business to
[00:12:19] Alex Bouaziz: really know what the problems really are. And I think this is kind of like a cultural point for
[00:12:24] Alex Bouaziz: retail, right? Tup down all of my leaders are hands-on. And then if my leaders are hands-on,
[00:12:29] Alex Bouaziz: middle management is hands-on and I see this the exact same way. So I think cultured is always
[00:12:34] Alex Bouaziz: been very important for us as a business. It's always been very important for me. And it really
[00:12:38] Alex Bouaziz: helped me navigate different paths of growth, new products, or even spotting gaps into the organization.
[00:12:45] Alex Bouaziz: Right? I think every company at more than 50, 100 people start having flows in their designs,
[00:12:51] Alex Bouaziz: in their org in terms of response time, in terms of how things are happening. And if you are
[00:12:56] Alex Bouaziz: 10,000 fits about kind of looking down at like the organization, hoping to figure out what's wrong,
[00:13:03] Alex Bouaziz: it just doesn't really work. So being actually even being seen by our customers, because it's not
[00:13:08] Alex Bouaziz: just you, right? And our investor, my customers, I get a lot, we're not that we get that many, but I
[00:13:13] Alex Bouaziz: get people pinging me about, hey, like I have a problem with this, etc. directly. That really does
[00:13:17] Alex Bouaziz: help me have a better view of like what's wrong in the organization in everyday basis. And when
[00:13:23] Alex Bouaziz: you're growing at the pace where we are, right? Like billions in our profitable business, acquisitions,
[00:13:29] Alex Bouaziz: 7,000 people around the world today, like it's very easy to lose sight of what's going on if you're
[00:13:34] Alex Bouaziz: not really hands-on and really focused. Dude, how many direct reports do you have speaking of being hands-on?
[00:13:40] Alex Bouaziz: Not that many, I'm not Jensen at all. I have like 20 or a little over 20. The thing is my direct
[00:13:49] Alex Bouaziz: report is really strong. So I've never had one on ones with them, I've never truly had performance
[00:13:56] Alex Bouaziz: reviews with them. I can't give them continuous feedback all the time and we talk all the time.
[00:14:00] Alex Bouaziz: We work all the time. And that is I think a much better setup from a year-arkey perspective than
[00:14:05] Alex Bouaziz: the traditional. I only have a few reports and I talk to them on the day-to-day, like on the
[00:14:11] Alex Bouaziz: one-on-one cadence every week or whatever it that is. If you don't do one-on-one cadence every week,
[00:14:16] Harry Stebbings: how do you think about building that continuous information flow, especially when you're not in
[00:14:19] Harry Stebbings: the office? But how do you have that tight feedback loop together? I speak to them all the time.
[00:14:25] Alex Bouaziz: Literally, if you take any of my reports, they get messages from me,
[00:14:30] Alex Bouaziz: or they send me messages every day. The way I view my job is I'm here to enable. So what's
[00:14:37] Alex Bouaziz: broken, what's not working, why is it not working, what can I do to make it better for you? Is it
[00:14:41] Alex Bouaziz: resources, is it just prioritization, is it re-arguing? My job is kind of like looking at the different
[00:14:48] Alex Bouaziz: parts of the organization and being present for you to be your best self, right? And do your best work.
[00:14:53] Alex Bouaziz: And being hands-on with them in the problems they see every day really enables me to do that.
[00:14:57] Alex Bouaziz: Dude, 996 and hustle culture is more pronounced than ever before. You said about that kind of
[00:15:03] Harry Stebbings: work ethic, hunger. How do you feel about the 996 obsession today? I wish I worked at 996. I think
[00:15:10] Alex Bouaziz: I worked a little harder than that personally. And I think most of my leadership does too, but I just
[00:15:15] Alex Bouaziz: don't think it works. That scale, really, right? I think there's moments in the company where you
[00:15:22] Alex Bouaziz: need to push hard and there's moments where things are a bit more in control. Actually, like,
[00:15:28] Alex Bouaziz: to break down this in like different organization, like not everybody needs to be going at a thousand
[00:15:33] Alex Bouaziz: miles per hour is all the time, right? Some parts of their organization at a very specific moment
[00:15:38] Alex Bouaziz: need to. And as long as you're in control and you're pushing for the right places at the right time,
[00:15:43] Alex Bouaziz: you're not going to burn through amazing times, right? So being actually being hands-on is very
[00:15:48] Alex Bouaziz: helpful in there, right? When you're able to say, okay, you know what? Like, that product is not
[00:15:52] Alex Bouaziz: good enough. Open the war room. Everybody's going to work more than 996 for a couple weeks to get
[00:15:58] Alex Bouaziz: it ready. That makes a lot of sense to me. If you're just pushing the pedal all the time, you're just
[00:16:02] Alex Bouaziz: not going to do it. You're not going to do yourself a favor and your team is just not going to work out.
[00:16:06] Alex Bouaziz: Does being rich help you be a better leader? I've done less seconder is than you think, actually.
[00:16:14] Alex Bouaziz: So, I think being rich as an investor makes you a better investor. You see upside, not downside.
[00:16:23] Harry Stebbings: You're actually able to align more with founders because your career is not on the line. You've
[00:16:28] Harry Stebbings: already got enough money. It's fine. And you're much more level. I'm torn on this.
[00:16:35] Alex Bouaziz: Because I do think, and I'm not going to name anyone, but I do think that a lot of my friends
[00:16:43] Alex Bouaziz: that have built amazing businesses go through like this awkward phase where they've made enough money
[00:16:50] Alex Bouaziz: to not work as much anymore. And a lot of things happens in their life because they get pulled
[00:16:55] Alex Bouaziz: by so many different external topics that want their attention. And the business starts stagnating
[00:17:02] Alex Bouaziz: a little bit because I do think like founders create a lot of momentum within organization
[00:17:07] Alex Bouaziz: until they actually get pulled back. And when they see the businesses not as growing anymore,
[00:17:12] Alex Bouaziz: they start having maybe some troubles with their board and things like that. So,
[00:17:17] Alex Bouaziz: I actually do think it has a form of a negative impact if you're not
[00:17:23] Alex Bouaziz: thought out about how you're going to manage this at scale and how this is going to impact your day
[00:17:27] Alex Bouaziz: to day work. How does it have a negative impact? I mean, it's just very pragmatic, right? Like,
[00:17:34] Alex Bouaziz: if you've never had money and you suddenly have a lot of money on your bank account and you start
[00:17:38] Alex Bouaziz: spending it on a lot of different things, then your mind is just somewhere else. Right? So,
[00:17:43] Alex Bouaziz: I would say that's just like a B tier founder. And I'm being direct with that, but like,
[00:17:49] Harry Stebbings: okay, no, no, it's your founders as well. I'm seeing it happen with amazing founders. It's easy to
[00:17:55] Alex Bouaziz: get lost. And I think eventually you get a big reminder of why you're here and get your
[00:18:02] Alex Bouaziz: ask because no matter how many of them has made money, it's the beginning not as much as
[00:18:08] Alex Bouaziz: it can be a lot of money, but it's not as much as the potential of money they can make over time.
[00:18:13] Alex Bouaziz: Right? And there's a lot of people eventually on your capital, they're here to remind you that
[00:18:18] Alex Bouaziz: if trusted, you will have a lot of money and they want you to deliver on the promises you have. So,
[00:18:23] Alex Bouaziz: I'm pretty, again, if you're very thought out about what it means to you and how you're going to
[00:18:29] Alex Bouaziz: manage this and how it's going to affect your life over time, then it's fine because it is going
[00:18:34] Alex Bouaziz: to affect your life, right? And I've seen that trap happen to a few of my friends, but thankfully,
[00:18:39] Alex Bouaziz: they've turned it around big time so I can say anything. But did you ever get high on your own
[00:18:44] Harry Stebbings: supply? We mentioned both being young that I was a little bit younger than you. I definitely got
[00:18:50] Harry Stebbings: high on my own supply at 21, 22, thinking I was the shit. Maybe. I think there's a moment
[00:18:57] Alex Bouaziz: where you're like, hutch it, everybody wants to invest. You're getting termships left and right
[00:19:02] Alex Bouaziz: where you start being inconsiderate, but I actually kind of like have gone through enough cycles now,
[00:19:10] Alex Bouaziz: although it's not been exactly a long time, where I actually kind of regret not having being
[00:19:16] Alex Bouaziz: some of those times slightly nicer or more considered that I was. And I see it with some of my friends
[00:19:22] Alex Bouaziz: or some people that are raising like crazy runs right now where my take is like at some point,
[00:19:26] Alex Bouaziz: everything that goes up must go down. And at that point in time is when you start thinking,
[00:19:32] Alex Bouaziz: maybe I shouldn't have done this or I shouldn't have done that, right? And I think I don't think
[00:19:38] Alex Bouaziz: I was that intense on this. I'm sure some people I think I was if it was, it wasn't ever intentional,
[00:19:44] Alex Bouaziz: so I'm sorry. But I do think that over time it happens to founder is that build companies that
[00:19:50] Alex Bouaziz: have significant traction for sure at that amount of time. Dude, what's the craziest VC story you
[00:19:55] Harry Stebbings: have of like term sheets flying to see you name it? Like you were and all one of the hottest
[00:20:01] Harry Stebbings: companies in the world, but also you're trying to. It was still hot. Thank you. Yeah, just scaled.
[00:20:08] Harry Stebbings: What's the one of the craziest stories? I have some crazy stories that are not good stories,
[00:20:13] Alex Bouaziz: so I can't really share those ones. One of our investor at our series, a calling me about COVID
[00:20:19] Alex Bouaziz: and telling me, you guys, you need to fire everyone and stop doing whatever you're doing because COVID
[00:20:25] Alex Bouaziz: is going to kill the company and me answering to them, no, we're doing okay. We're actually going
[00:20:29] Alex Bouaziz: to raise a series A and then and getting back channels from this saying like, yeah, the guy
[00:20:36] thinks your car, etc. He thinks that you're bullshitting for your for your series and there's
[00:20:41] Alex Bouaziz: nothing that's going to happen. And then me going back to two weeks later with a term sheet from
[00:20:45] Alex Bouaziz: Andrewson Ho, it's telling them, look, this is my series A, but you weren't very nice to me, so
[00:20:51] Alex Bouaziz: you're not getting your pro rata. That was a funny story for sure. I would say, look, if you
[00:20:55] Alex Bouaziz: wanted like a crazy story, I mean, we did raise $700 million from my living room in Tel Aviv,
[00:21:00] Alex Bouaziz: right? Like on Zoom without meeting any of our investors. What would tell me this?
[00:21:05] Harry Stebbings: Sorry. It was. Give me everything around we raised was during COVID, 2021, 2021, 2022. I was in
[00:21:11] Alex Bouaziz: Tel Aviv, you know, so I did raise most of the capital we had in the company without meeting our
[00:21:17] Alex Bouaziz: investor. Actually, you know what? The ribbit guys flew in to see me and I flew like we kind of
[00:21:23] Alex Bouaziz: met halfway in a country. And that was the first time I ever had a closing dinner in my life. So
[00:21:29] no way. Did you not want that? Like before I make an investment rule number one from 2021
[00:21:36] Harry Stebbings: mistakes, I will not invest in as I meet a founder in person. It's just led to bad investment
[00:21:40] Harry Stebbings: decisions. So much is learned from me seeing you. Dude, I love you as a person. When I see you,
[00:21:47] Harry Stebbings: I feel your energy, your charisma. You need to be in person. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, I agree with
[00:21:54] Alex Bouaziz: you 100%. But you know, in 2020, 2021, I couldn't be in person. And this is when we raised most
[00:22:00] Alex Bouaziz: of our money. So and we didn't do any big fundraiser until this one. No, right? So that was my
[00:22:05] Alex Bouaziz: experience, right? That from fundraising, we were actually meeting, uh, meeting people.
[00:22:09] Alex Bouaziz: Dude, do you think pro-rata should be an actual right? No, I think pro-rata should be earned.
[00:22:18] Do you advise founders always raise at the highest price? No, because I think
[00:22:26] Alex Bouaziz: I mean, there is a very valuable option, a very valuable option. And I think that the higher you are,
[00:22:31] Alex Bouaziz: the harder it is to get done. Um, and it depends what you want in life. And it depends how big your
[00:22:37] Alex Bouaziz: business is actually going to be. I think trying to go for the home run, I'm very glad I did,
[00:22:44] Alex Bouaziz: in terms of like, the ambition, we still have a lot of work to do, but I'm very glad that we
[00:22:47] Alex Bouaziz: went for the billion dollar valuation and all of those things. You could have backfire as well.
[00:22:52] Alex Bouaziz: So I think that was much more than I, from my part, which worked out, okay? But I do think that
[00:22:58] Alex Bouaziz: there is some optimization where you need to think about the future of the company and
[00:23:03] Alex Bouaziz: highest valuation does not always mean best outcome for the business and the people.
[00:23:07] Do you think venture investors do actually add value? I mean, you know, I think in recent
[00:23:11] Alex Bouaziz: role, it has been a big tremendous value. And I'm not saying that for like, they helped me find
[00:23:15] Alex Bouaziz: board members, they helped me place amazing people in the business. I think general
[00:23:19] Alex Bouaziz: government, and recent than the vast. And recent has been top tier by far. And they've always
[00:23:24] Alex Bouaziz: been super supportive through rainbows and unicorns all the way to shit storms. They stood by us,
[00:23:31] Alex Bouaziz: no investor ever did. I think in a journey, if you can get investors that are value aligned with
[00:23:37] Alex Bouaziz: you and that truly care about the business, not just the return, then you can make good friends
[00:23:43] Alex Bouaziz: that you can entrust yourself with. It's a long and tough journey. The hard thing is they do,
[00:23:48] Harry Stebbings: like today, and this is fundraising on the ground in venture today. Founders run a more transactional
[00:23:55] Harry Stebbings: process than ever. I meet you today. You say, hey, Harry, rounds moving fast. I need a decision
[00:24:01] Harry Stebbings: by Friday. It's Wednesday. But that means you didn't spend time with me before. You're coming in
[00:24:06] Alex Bouaziz: at the last minute to jump in on the round. That's already more or less done. No, because they've been
[00:24:11] Harry Stebbings: told by their prior around investors do not take an investor meeting until you're fundraising.
[00:24:15] Harry Stebbings: Don't build relationships. And so, yeah, that's a mistake. I think building a relationship with
[00:24:20] Alex Bouaziz: great people is helpful. And I think there's a lot of ways for funders to make those meetings
[00:24:24] Alex Bouaziz: useful. For example, I would have never taken a meeting with an investor building up the relationship.
[00:24:29] Alex Bouaziz: The outcome of that meeting wouldn't be, for example, two or three business intros of
[00:24:33] Alex Bouaziz: potential customers. They value for you. They value for me. If I can get a bit more value,
[00:24:38] Alex Bouaziz: it's even better. G share numbers in those meetings. I share high level numbers. Why not?
[00:24:43] Alex Bouaziz: The thing is that most of your numbers are available if someone really wants to figure them out. It
[00:24:49] Alex Bouaziz: doesn't truly matter. I don't believe in hiding numbers. The way I think about venture capital
[00:24:55] Alex Bouaziz: transactions is not them giving like sure, very early on is them giving you money to try to build
[00:25:00] Alex Bouaziz: something. No, it's going to fail. But as you grow as a company and there's a brighter future
[00:25:04] Alex Bouaziz: and a clearer vision of where it's going, I see this much more as a transaction where it's
[00:25:08] Alex Bouaziz: you selling them a part of your business for them bringing you value, which goes beyond money.
[00:25:13] Alex Bouaziz: Do you know Mickey taught me one thing? He said, Harry, you've never won or lost. You're only
[00:25:18] Harry Stebbings: ever ahead or behind. This is an infinite game. Remember that. It was especially about relationships
[00:25:26] Harry Stebbings: and the value of long-term relationships and not being here for the quick win or getting something
[00:25:30] Harry Stebbings: good. Nothing to do your other advice from Mickey just yet, but I'm excited about them.
[00:25:35] Harry Stebbings: It was fucking great. How important is investor brand? You have big brands behind you now with
[00:25:41] Harry Stebbings: your Andresons, with your ribbits, with your code. Does investor brand really make a difference?
[00:25:46] Harry Stebbings: I think so. I think if you want to assemble the best team in the world, you're going to have
[00:25:50] Alex Bouaziz: the best investors in the world. I think in many different ways, they can help you attract
[00:25:54] Alex Bouaziz: down, they can help you attract more capital, they can help you navigate through complex situations
[00:25:59] Alex Bouaziz: that they have lived before. Every time I talk to Ben, it's crazy the amount of knowledge that he
[00:26:05] Alex Bouaziz: has. It's crazy the amount of pattern matching that he has in terms of how the best. What's your
[00:26:10] Alex Bouaziz: Yoda knowledge from Ben? I gave him mine from Mickey. Come on.
[00:26:14] Alex Bouaziz: Oh, Yoda knowledge. I hope he doesn't get mad at me for saying that one.
[00:26:18] Alex Bouaziz: But in his mind, in his mind, most chief marketing officers are not good. The truth is,
[00:26:29] Alex Bouaziz: I actually agree with him. And for a while, I was looking for a CMO with this experience,
[00:26:34] Alex Bouaziz: that experience, that experience. And what I've realized is like, the best CMOs have encountered
[00:26:40] Alex Bouaziz: of the last few years are the ones that are just able to be so much more first principle into
[00:26:45] Alex Bouaziz: understanding what's going on and going really deep into the data instead of being super superficial.
[00:26:52] Alex Bouaziz: And you don't usually get that from a traditional CMO background. So like the contrary,
[00:26:55] Alex Bouaziz: and since me and him have kind of developed is that your CMO should be an engineer.
[00:27:02] Do you want so funny? The best CMO in the world to me is Alex Schultz from Metta. He's also the VP
[00:27:07] Harry Stebbings: of analytics at Metta. He is engineering mind. He's a physicist also, but he's also incredibly creative.
[00:27:15] Harry Stebbings: And he is this unicorn of he's an artist visionary creative with an engineer analytics growth engine.
[00:27:24] Harry Stebbings: That's not the classic CMO background. So like there's amazing people who had brand,
[00:27:28] Alex Bouaziz: there's amazingly, quite lots of different things. I think if you want to efficiently drive
[00:27:33] Alex Bouaziz: marketing strategy at like a high-entence growth company, you've got to be much more engineer
[00:27:38] Alex Bouaziz: in my ground. Like that was sitting with the CMO of Whiz who is like, having one of the strongest
[00:27:44] Alex Bouaziz: CMOs have made in a long time. You should probably interview her. She's like, Asaf's magic weapon.
[00:27:50] Alex Bouaziz: Right now. Yeah. And like the way she just fought through
[00:27:55] Alex Bouaziz: some things that are just accepted in marketing. Right. Oh, we're spending X amounts of money on
[00:28:00] Alex Bouaziz: paid ads. And that's returning X kind of like, you know, taking over the role, kind of going back and
[00:28:04] Alex Bouaziz: saying, okay, that is a lot of money. Let's go back. Let's understand. Let's deeply understand how
[00:28:09] Alex Bouaziz: this works. And like I think being able to like cut spend by half, but increasing the number of
[00:28:13] Alex Bouaziz: leads by half, but just going really deep into understanding the problem. Only people that care
[00:28:18] Alex Bouaziz: about truly understanding how the system work deeply can get done is what I found to be the right
[00:28:24] Alex Bouaziz: people for all roles, but specifically for marketing, given how much money goes there.
[00:28:28] Harry Stebbings: Insane amounts. It's a lot of saying, you know, this is an age old statement, which is, you know,
[00:28:32] Harry Stebbings: 50% of my marketing spends very efficient and 50% totally wasted. I just have no idea.
[00:28:37] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, just 50% for me is a lot of money, right. So actually, you want to make sure I'm
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_00: optimized on this. Yeah, don't be so tight, dude. Listen, uh, Revolut, I interviewed Nick. And he
[00:28:48] Harry Stebbings: was like, the biggest mindset change I've had is actually in the value of brand marketing.
[00:28:53] Do you think brand marketing is as valuable? Yes. And this is new to me.
[00:28:59] Alex Bouaziz: By the way, Nick is my favorite founder. Probably the person I look up to the most in many
[00:29:02] Alex Bouaziz: different ways. He knows that. So it's a, it's a aligned. Yes, a thousand percent. But no,
[00:29:10] Alex Bouaziz: not before. So I think when I look at deal and growth over the next few years,
[00:29:16] Alex Bouaziz: the only way for us to be what I think we can be, which is a hundred billion dollar plus company
[00:29:22] Alex Bouaziz: that truly changes how I try and pay always perceive and really disrupts this, this whole market
[00:29:28] Alex Bouaziz: is for a brand to be aligned and for the brand to be much more known, right. And that didn't
[00:29:36] Alex Bouaziz: actually matter to me two, three years ago. But today, when I see the path to get to the numbers
[00:29:42] Alex Bouaziz: we want, which is not insane, by the way, like what I told, what I love to tell investors is like,
[00:29:47] Alex Bouaziz: okay, today we have, have you done any consumer deals or are you like anti-consumer? No, I've done
[00:29:52] Harry Stebbings: consumer deals. Okay. Like what would you say to, like if I was a company coming to you and telling
[00:29:56] Alex Bouaziz: you, okay, today we have 1.5 million people getting paid on deal. We're going to get this to 10
[00:30:00] Alex Bouaziz: million people. Like, would you think that's crazy? No. Okay. So 10 million people given that
[00:30:07] Alex Bouaziz: today were over a billion in in in in our would mean that quite a bit more revenue, right. So
[00:30:12] Alex Bouaziz: given this, basically you need to get 10 billion in error to be the 100 billion dollar. Exactly.
[00:30:17] Harry Stebbings: But you can also push that to rent further. Like again, consumer investors, if I was telling you
[00:30:21] Alex Bouaziz: that we will do payroll for a hundred million people over the next few years, it's not that crazy.
[00:30:27] That's quite crazy. That's actually harder to believe. When you actually look at time and when
[00:30:32] Harry Stebbings: you look at what you mean everyone needs payroll, every single person in the world gets payrolled
[00:30:36] Alex Bouaziz: almost, right? Like, okay, maybe not every single person or most people in the world get payrolled,
[00:30:39] Alex Bouaziz: right? Yeah. I mean, hey, there's actually what's your time? Every single worker in the world.
[00:30:46] Yes. No. Like, I don't think it works for all parts of all companies. One, it doesn't
[00:30:52] Harry Stebbings: work for all geographies too. You're not working in Japanese agriculture, my friend.
[00:30:59] Harry Stebbings: I do payroll for oil and gas for agriculture companies for airlines. You're wrong. We do payroll
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_00: for a lot of people. And then you actually look at assumptions on market take. There's always
[00:31:11] Harry Stebbings: going to be, okay, let's do this. In five years time, what does the market map look like? Is that
[00:31:18] Harry Stebbings: like one winner who gets 80% or is this like a 25, 25, 25, 25? It depends how much I spend on
[00:31:25] Alex Bouaziz: brand awareness. No, really? No, no, it doesn't. I think we can be very aggressively winning most of
[00:31:32] Alex Bouaziz: the market. I actually think the gap between 10 to 100 million over the next five to 10 years is
[00:31:36] Alex Bouaziz: not that big. If the brand is known, if we build infrastructure, that really changes. Where would
[00:31:40] Harry Stebbings: you most like to spend on brand marketing that you haven't yet? Do you want to do an F1 car?
[00:31:46] Harry Stebbings: Well, we'll do some of those actually. So you'll see some of them coming already in the works.
[00:31:51] Alex Bouaziz: The thing about brand marketing is I actually don't know the subject well enough. So you're going
[00:31:55] Alex Bouaziz: to have to give me a little bit of time to get educated in terms of how this works properly and
[00:31:59] Alex Bouaziz: we'll probably make a bunch of mistakes in the meantime, but we're going to try really hard.
[00:32:04] Alex Bouaziz: I do think this value into F1, into football, into golf, and things like that. For us, it's an
[00:32:11] Alex Bouaziz: interesting thing to navigate because I want to be able to make both sides of the equation happy.
[00:32:16] Alex Bouaziz: So if we own B2B assets that we can bring, customers at events, and things like that, it's great for
[00:32:23] Alex Bouaziz: short investing into our customers and getting them to be excited about the company. But at the same
[00:32:28] Alex Bouaziz: time, if I can get the end user and the funds excited, I think there's like a long-term value
[00:32:33] Alex Bouaziz: line brand here as well. Where would you most like to cut spend that you haven't cut,
[00:32:38] Harry Stebbings: spend or can't cut, spend? At Dill, I would love to cut spend on the pure paid marketing side.
[00:32:46] Alex Bouaziz: I think that'd be cool. And I think that comes from brand awareness. The bigger your brand,
[00:32:50] Alex Bouaziz: the less you need to pay for leads. So that's very aligned in terms of where we want to go.
[00:32:55] Alex Bouaziz: Obviously, Dill is a very operations heavy business. Because we have made a couple thousand
[00:33:02] Alex Bouaziz: people in operations around the world. And I think over time, with AI and with a lot of the
[00:33:06] Alex Bouaziz: infrastructure we're building, we'll be able to have the best performers to add the business and
[00:33:11] Alex Bouaziz: reach off all there a little bit. Where's AI impacted Dill and Lose? We spoke before about
[00:33:16] Harry Stebbings: speaking about the future. When you look forward, where do you think AI will impact Dill and Lose
[00:33:21] Harry Stebbings: function wise? Pure operations, right? Automating through agents, task 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
[00:33:27] Alex Bouaziz: they're being done manually today until they're fully automated through tech, right? Just being
[00:33:31] Alex Bouaziz: able to bring a managed AI type of software is a huge game-changing, really a big game-changing
[00:33:39] Alex Bouaziz: impact for us. GAs managed today. We use a competitor and them until one of them becomes good enough
[00:33:46] Alex Bouaziz: for our solution. But I really like the man who's a guy, so I think they might be it.
[00:33:50] Harry Stebbings: But they're not good enough today. No, because it's early. Do you have AI customer service tools?
[00:33:57] Alex Bouaziz: Yeah, we built a lot of AI stuff. So one super interesting thing, Dill, that has actually been
[00:34:02] Alex Bouaziz: probably the best investment we've made at the company is we built our own knowledge base. So two,
[00:34:07] Alex Bouaziz: three years ago, I was talking to one of my board members and telling them how we have that
[00:34:13] Alex Bouaziz: very unique knowledge, global employment, global benefits, global payroll, very detailed,
[00:34:21] Alex Bouaziz: very detailed, minion cyclopedia, until with 20,000 articles and 70,000 different data points
[00:34:28] Alex Bouaziz: changing every year. I was talking to my board member, we were keeping this in Google Doc and
[00:34:33] Alex Bouaziz: Notion. I was like, I think this is going to be one of the biggest things I'd do. If we can
[00:34:39] Alex Bouaziz: actually know our knowledge and onus, it's going to just make such a big difference for how we
[00:34:45] Alex Bouaziz: operate. And I was jamming at night with Sebastian, actually from Clarina, who is thinking about AI
[00:34:52] Alex Bouaziz: 24, seven and probably one of the sharpest mine in terms of like integrating AI into your business.
[00:34:57] Alex Bouaziz: And I was like, Sebastian, I need to do something about this. And he came to me and he said,
[00:35:01] Alex Bouaziz: you know, I'm actually building our own knowledge base inside of a week EGS internally. And he's
[00:35:06] Alex Bouaziz: working really well. And I'm like, shit, that's actually brilliant, right? Because you can build
[00:35:10] Alex Bouaziz: parameters, you can build your own infrastructure. And then you can layer AI on top of your own data.
[00:35:15] Alex Bouaziz: So you're in full control. And there is no hallucination actually on the data itself. And we did
[00:35:19] Alex Bouaziz: that like over the last two years. And it's probably one of the best investments in the word we could
[00:35:24] Alex Bouaziz: have ever done because like every single time you come and talk to us, we're able to get the
[00:35:27] Alex Bouaziz: right data almost straight away about the very specific use case we're talking about, which is
[00:35:31] Alex Bouaziz: impossible for most other people to get, you know, what have you not invested in internally that
[00:35:36] Harry Stebbings: with the benefit of hindsight you would like to have done? I think you learn lessons from mistakes.
[00:35:42] Alex Bouaziz: I think we under invested in our internal tools and processes. I told you I look up to Nikolat.
[00:35:49] Alex Bouaziz: And Nick's mentor is build everything. If you want everything, you do everything. So I don't
[00:35:53] Alex Bouaziz: know if you know about revenue builds, everything. And I think he's right. I think in many ways,
[00:35:59] Alex Bouaziz: like yeah, software is a lot of sass are not tailored enough to the different applications that we
[00:36:05] Alex Bouaziz: want to build. And owning most of the software makes a significant difference in many different places.
[00:36:10] Alex Bouaziz: But let me give you a very small project that we're very excited about. A very like a strong example.
[00:36:17] Alex Bouaziz: Over the last year, we built our own GRI like product internally. So basically like ticket
[00:36:23] Alex Bouaziz: management and scale because being able to route the right tickets to the right person. So
[00:36:27] Alex Bouaziz: you have a pro and your customer. You want to talk to payroll. You want to talk to HR. You want to talk
[00:36:30] Alex Bouaziz: to finance whatever that is being able to write your own tickets is very critical. And like no
[00:36:34] Alex Bouaziz: software is really agile enough to be able to do this. And now what we're launching like this week
[00:36:38] Alex Bouaziz: internally is like debit to just as a salesperson, as a CSM at whatever within the company, being able to
[00:36:44] Alex Bouaziz: type your problem. And like basically with AI automatically create the right ticket, automatically
[00:36:49] Alex Bouaziz: routing it to the right person and cutting the time at like 90% in terms of resolution that we can
[00:36:54] Alex Bouaziz: have. And like that only comes from being able to build a lot of your internal infrastructure. And
[00:36:57] Alex Bouaziz: is the dumbest thing to do when you're small. But it's the smartest thing to do, I think as your
[00:37:02] Alex Bouaziz: scale. And the moment that which we should have started should have been a lot earlier. Because when
[00:37:08] Alex Bouaziz: we knew we were on the path of like we know where we're going, we can start making longer investments
[00:37:13] Alex Bouaziz: and longer bets. We should have like transitioned this a little bit. What is the sign that you should
[00:37:18] Harry Stebbings: transition to build on? I think a couple hundred percent year on your growth, press profitability is
[00:37:25] Alex Bouaziz: a good sign when we started years and other example, right? Like building your own peril engine
[00:37:31] Alex Bouaziz: like I'm kicking to you about earlier is like a very bold move, right? It's something that you go
[00:37:36] Alex Bouaziz: like, why would you do this? Right? Like pay fit is a unique one in friends just doing peril in
[00:37:41] Alex Bouaziz: France. Gus toys a unique one in the deck, a corn in the US just doing peril in the US, right? So
[00:37:47] Alex Bouaziz: building our own internal infrastructure from ground up with the ambition of running out the
[00:37:52] Alex Bouaziz: hundred plus countries is like something that most people will look at and go, you're a little crazy.
[00:37:57] Alex Bouaziz: And that's true. It's like a very crazy play actually. But you know, when you're four years into
[00:38:02] Alex Bouaziz: the business, you're profitable, you're on path to grow really fast. You can have some decisions
[00:38:07] Alex Bouaziz: to make, right? Like how big of a company do you really want to build? Can you make a lot of those
[00:38:11] Alex Bouaziz: long term plays that you think are going to be significant for the value of the company and for
[00:38:15] Alex Bouaziz: your customers? And that's where we kind of got into a place where we're like, okay, do we want to be
[00:38:20] Alex Bouaziz: an acquisition outcome with a great one to three products? Or do we want to actually own the rails?
[00:38:24] Alex Bouaziz: Like the actual like, yes, close to the metal as possible in a way that no one has ever done before.
[00:38:30] Alex Bouaziz: And I think you can only start making those plays when you are, you know, truly profitable and
[00:38:36] Alex Bouaziz: truly growing at the pace where it's okay to take a couple hundred people and build the infrastructure
[00:38:40] Alex Bouaziz: that's going to serve you tomorrow. I think my biggest takeaway from Nick actually is how he treats
[00:38:44] Harry Stebbings: Ravallute in some ways like an incubation unit for new product testing. And he has like 26, 27 new
[00:38:50] Harry Stebbings: product bass where he gives people a two million bucks a year and then really measures cadence
[00:38:56] Harry Stebbings: and how they progress. I'm not there yet. I'm not there yet. I think for me what's the most important
[00:39:00] Alex Bouaziz: is we've kind of gone through. It's an interesting phase at the company today. We've gone through
[00:39:04] Alex Bouaziz: having two amazing products into having now like 10 and like for me the most important is making
[00:39:10] Alex Bouaziz: that system work amazingly well together. So like I'm not really looking to launch like 10 new
[00:39:15] Alex Bouaziz: products next year. It's not really my thing. It's more like how do we give the best end to end
[00:39:19] Alex Bouaziz: HR and payroll experience to our customers. And then when I get into a place where I'm like, okay,
[00:39:24] Alex Bouaziz: we've kind of like killed the market the same way we had for like global payroll, you are, etc.
[00:39:28] Alex Bouaziz: Then that's when we might make more more new bets. How do you do sales teams that because when
[00:39:33] Harry Stebbings: you have 10 products, you think like verticalization is great. They can really know the product,
[00:39:37] Harry Stebbings: really know the problem. But then it's really hard to do the cross-out while and they'll be sweet.
[00:39:43] Harry Stebbings: What's the winning solution? Yeah, well, here's an interesting data point for you. I know you love
[00:39:47] Alex Bouaziz: data. 60% of our revenue actually comes from cross-out today. So, so Cross-Sale is actually a big part
[00:39:54] Alex Bouaziz: of what we do. Well, expansion, Cross-Sale and expansion as well for our customers, right? So we
[00:39:58] Alex Bouaziz: do well and they want to open new countries or they just hire more people and things like that.
[00:40:02] Alex Bouaziz: So the way we've done this is basically, and I think it's pretty similar to like a couple other
[00:40:08] Alex Bouaziz: big organizations like Oracle and others, but it works pretty well for us. We basically have what
[00:40:12] Alex Bouaziz: we call our cross-sales people and they sell the product that we feel are fully mastered inside
[00:40:19] Alex Bouaziz: of the company, right? From an enablement perspective, from like an experience perspective,
[00:40:22] Alex Bouaziz: from like an end-to-end perspective, we feel like we're in full control. Our core is we'll have,
[00:40:28] Alex Bouaziz: we'll quickly ramp up and quickly be the best in the market at selling this. And then we have what
[00:40:32] Alex Bouaziz: we call those over-latives. So it's like our IT business. So we acquire the Huffy, for example,
[00:40:37] Alex Bouaziz: a company you invested in, which is doing amazing for us. It's grown almost 100% year-on-year.
[00:40:42] Alex Bouaziz: It's very specialized, right? And we're building a lot of IT products. So you have an over-lative
[00:40:46] Alex Bouaziz: that is brought by the core of your team when this is an interesting product for the customers.
[00:40:51] Alex Bouaziz: But at the same time, it's a standalone and a lend product. So you can actually, you can actually
[00:40:55] Alex Bouaziz: have leads that are only interested in this and they will be the ones selling it before moving
[00:40:58] Alex Bouaziz: into a core. And we do this across like all of the different products. So immigration, global payroll,
[00:41:04] Alex Bouaziz: like some of all of those different products. And like an interesting thing is over time,
[00:41:08] Alex Bouaziz: some of your product become mature enough and your organization and your data and your knowledge
[00:41:11] Alex Bouaziz: becomes mature enough that you can bring some of those products into the core team, right? That's
[00:41:15] Alex Bouaziz: like our holy grail is for things to be so smooth that I can bring one of those products into the
[00:41:20] Alex Bouaziz: core team rather than having over-lays on that front. Totally get you. Can I ask you,
[00:41:25] Harry Stebbings: when you think about building out the sales team, what's been the biggest lesson for you
[00:41:29] Harry Stebbings: and how you've done it successfully? It is a freaking hard part to scale. One thing I always
[00:41:33] Alex Bouaziz: tell early stage founders that we didn't really well actually and really helped us. Because if you
[00:41:39] Alex Bouaziz: think about Dill's revenue split today, 50% comes from the US and all over 35% comes from Europe.
[00:41:45] Alex Bouaziz: And the rest is like kind of rest of the world and we're growing all parts. One move we did
[00:41:49] Alex Bouaziz: pretty early on is higher salespeople in different Geos pretty early on just to understand the market.
[00:41:56] Alex Bouaziz: So instead of having like a lot of salespeople just in one country, like hiring a few salespeople
[00:42:01] Alex Bouaziz: into other countries and kind of say like go and figure it out was really helpful for us. Because
[00:42:06] Alex Bouaziz: it really helped us ramp up across all markets really fast and having a strong understanding of what's
[00:42:10] Alex Bouaziz: going to work. What's not going to work and how we should reshare for strategy. For example, we launched
[00:42:15] Alex Bouaziz: Japan two years into the business and like it didn't work for the first year and a half.
[00:42:22] Alex Bouaziz: And then eventually we changed country leads with all of the learnings from the first one.
[00:42:26] Alex Bouaziz: And now it's doing really well. And all of this kind of happens in parallel where like a lot of
[00:42:30] Alex Bouaziz: people are like yeah, it's going to defocus you. You shouldn't be doing that. I'm like,
[00:42:34] Alex Bouaziz: higher sales guys, if you sell or if she sells and if they do, amazing. You can ramp up and hire
[00:42:39] Alex Bouaziz: more of them. If they don't, then it's fine. You'll let them go and change them.
[00:42:42] Alex Bouaziz: I get you, but how do you think about defocusing? I don't think having one person running around
[00:42:48] Alex Bouaziz: when you're like 10 people, 20 people trying to sell something is defocusing. The only thing that
[00:42:52] Alex Bouaziz: can be defocusing is if they come and start telling you, you know, for Brazil, I need this specific
[00:42:57] Alex Bouaziz: thing for this country and in that dispute. And here you just say like no sell what you have. But I
[00:43:01] Alex Bouaziz: really don't think having salespeople in different places is defocusing and that really helped us
[00:43:05] Alex Bouaziz: move really fast in shaping go to market. Let's not clearly work. And so this is a hilarious
[00:43:11] Harry Stebbings: debate because I know shit and you know everything having lived it. But like, I don't agree.
[00:43:16] Harry Stebbings: If it works, they need more time and more resources. And if it doesn't, you need to do something
[00:43:22] Harry Stebbings: about it. So it does objectively defocus you. Like I think of this with our media company's day,
[00:43:27] Harry Stebbings: we could do new shows. We could do different types of shows. We could do politics. We could do
[00:43:32] Harry Stebbings: consumer fashion food. We can defocus. When what we do? When it comes to sell, I don't think
[00:43:40] Alex Bouaziz: I don't think there is any defocus because if they sell it works, then if it works, you'd be the
[00:43:44] Alex Bouaziz: happiest person in the world to give them more resources. If it doesn't work, it's okay. You tried.
[00:43:49] Harry Stebbings: You said 50% US, 35% Europe, 15% out. Yeah, maybe it's 30% Europe, but in those numbers.
[00:43:56] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, kind of bullpaw. Yeah, sugar. When you were a hundred billion market cat, 10 billion in
[00:44:04] Harry Stebbings: revenue, what are those numbers then? I think you'll be more or less the same.
[00:44:09] Alex Bouaziz: More change. It hasn't changed from one million AR to this stage. So I don't think it will change.
[00:44:15] Alex Bouaziz: That's fascinating. You mentioned, Huffy, one really interesting element is 13 acquisitions in six
[00:44:23] Harry Stebbings: years. It's a lot. And all of your board members told me I had to touch on this. And they're really
[00:44:27] Harry Stebbings: successful, which is also a surprise. Not all really successful, but we've made the most of them.
[00:44:32] Alex Bouaziz: Let's put it that way. Huffy is really successful. Huffy is very successful. This is what you
[00:44:37] Alex Bouaziz: buy them in the first place. Yeah, I actually think it will be a 10 billion AR company. I think
[00:44:40] Alex Bouaziz: DLIT, so basically what we do with acquisitions, we have quite an interesting playbook. I think that's
[00:44:46] Alex Bouaziz: what most of the investors were mentioning you. What we do is we do two types of acquisitions.
[00:44:52] Alex Bouaziz: We either hire other do acquisitions that are core to our market. And then we, in a way,
[00:44:58] Alex Bouaziz: buy the team, buy the revenue, bring them in house and kind of, you know,
[00:45:03] Alex Bouaziz: repaint, replace their infrastructure with ours pretty fast. And we're pretty good at this,
[00:45:07] Alex Bouaziz: actually. Or we buy smaller companies that are in adjacent domains that we want to get into.
[00:45:14] Alex Bouaziz: And what we usually do is we don't try to patch things together. We take the founders and we rebuild
[00:45:20] Alex Bouaziz: full infrastructure from ground up. And the way we do this is kind of interesting because
[00:45:25] Alex Bouaziz: he really worked for us. So theory of sales. Most salespeople take nine months to a year
[00:45:34] Alex Bouaziz: to be comfortable selling a product. And in that process, you're going to have a couple
[00:45:39] Alex Bouaziz: earlier adopters, which are actually the best people in your organization. They're willing to
[00:45:43] Alex Bouaziz: try to sell something new because they're curious and they want to. And what happens with acquisition
[00:45:49] Alex Bouaziz: and the way we operate is we basically bring the product, rebuild all of the front end inside of
[00:45:54] Alex Bouaziz: Dill, why being connected to the back end of the current company. And that happens in like two
[00:46:00] Alex Bouaziz: months. So we can basically like launch the product that we've just acquired in the space of two
[00:46:03] Alex Bouaziz: months. And then give it in the hands of our sales organization so they can start learning how to
[00:46:08] Alex Bouaziz: sell it. In parallel, we're rebuilding the full back end of the product inside of Dill natively.
[00:46:14] And in the period of like depending on how complex the product is, it takes us like one,
[00:46:18] Alex Bouaziz: like three months to 12 months to rebuild the full back end and migrate all of the customers
[00:46:22] Alex Bouaziz: and all of those things in parallel. But in parallel, your sales org start selling your product.
[00:46:27] Alex Bouaziz: The early adopters see DIT and they start selling it. And it doesn't work as well sometimes. And it
[00:46:33] Alex Bouaziz: takes time to ramp up, time to fix bugs and they hate you for having sold this. But over time,
[00:46:39] Alex Bouaziz: you learn so much that you can really quickly, quickly close the gap and build the best product,
[00:46:43] Alex Bouaziz: really, really fast. So that when the organization decided itself that it's ready, which is usually
[00:46:48] Alex Bouaziz: nine months later, you can actually start ramping it up and selling it much more aggressively because
[00:46:52] Alex Bouaziz: it's amazing and it really works. If we were in doing this, you would basically spend 12 months
[00:46:57] Alex Bouaziz: integrating and then start sending and have another delta of like 12 months to be able to really
[00:47:03] Alex Bouaziz: reach the scale that you're going to market in needs to have. So that like very interesting
[00:47:08] Alex Bouaziz: playbook of like integrating the front end, giving it to your sales org, migrating all the
[00:47:13] Alex Bouaziz: customers in parallel in the back end, like really paid dividends to us and all of the acquisitions we
[00:47:17] Alex Bouaziz: have have grown by like hundreds, if not thousands of percent in the last few years.
[00:47:20] Alex Bouaziz: Dude, after 13 acquisitions, you do build a real nose for deal-making. And you're a deal-maker.
[00:47:29] Harry Stebbings: I love you for many reasons, but you're a brilliant deal-maker. What have been your big lessons on
[00:47:35] Harry Stebbings: how to price a company when you're buying it? How to incentivize founders with re-ups, with stock,
[00:47:42] Harry Stebbings: with cash comp? What are those lessons?
[00:47:45] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, I have one funding principle on this actually who came to me from my father.
[00:47:51] Alex Bouaziz: So my father in his past life did over 50 plus M&A. That's actually how he grew his business.
[00:47:56] Alex Bouaziz: And one thing he taught me on deal-making was the only way to get a great deal done. If both
[00:48:05] Alex Bouaziz: parties come out of the equation five years later saying we're happy this deal was actually
[00:48:11] Alex Bouaziz: happened. So structuring the deal in a way that's fair for both sides. Not even if you have the
[00:48:18] Alex Bouaziz: upper hand, right? Making it in a way that like you look back on this and say, hey, you know what,
[00:48:24] Alex Bouaziz: as the founder of the other business, I'm so happy this deal went through is the most important part.
[00:48:29] Alex Bouaziz: So whether it's on retention package, whether it's on like how many people from the team you
[00:48:33] Alex Bouaziz: keep, whether it's on like how brutal you are about the integration. Like a lot of the things that
[00:48:38] Alex Bouaziz: go there need to be aligned so that you're optimizing for both sides to be really happy about the deal.
[00:48:44] Alex Bouaziz: And it's not obvious because like a lot of those negotiations transparently like we have the
[00:48:49] Alex Bouaziz: upper hand as the company that's buying right. So we could be assholes and be like whatever,
[00:48:54] Alex Bouaziz: you know, I'll just get the best deal possible. But sometimes we'll over optimize on like the outcome
[00:48:59] Alex Bouaziz: of the acquisition down the line versus the best deal we could get. It's now a good time to buy.
[00:49:04] Harry Stebbings: Are you seeing a lot of companies who are not in the AI wave and not doing insane, insane,
[00:49:11] Harry Stebbings: lovable growth where they fool an out of favor with venture investors and you have the chance
[00:49:16] Harry Stebbings: to pick them off at good prices? Yes, of course. And I think this fundraiser is definitely going to
[00:49:22] Alex Bouaziz: be helping on on that front and doing more acquisitions. That was one of the reasons we also raised
[00:49:28] Alex Bouaziz: the capital. I think, you know, as you know, venture capital always comes in flavor of what's
[00:49:36] Alex Bouaziz: what's everybody looking at at the moment, right? So this comes in circles, right? And in cycles,
[00:49:43] Alex Bouaziz: right? Eventually things will shift and I think the companies that are maybe not AI first or in
[00:49:48] Alex Bouaziz: that AI hype just need to kind of hold tight and make sure that they deliver for the customers and
[00:49:52] Alex Bouaziz: stay close to the customers and kind of rise above the noise. And if they can do that, I think
[00:49:57] Alex Bouaziz: they'll come up on the stronger hands. If they cannot do that and they're amazing, then we're
[00:50:02] Alex Bouaziz: always looking to buy. How do you think about the founder packages in terms of like cash versus stock,
[00:50:08] Harry Stebbings: more cash less cash? How do do those incentive plans? Right. It's situational. Sometimes we make
[00:50:16] Alex Bouaziz: acquisitions where we really want the funder to stay. And sometimes we actually don't think the
[00:50:21] Alex Bouaziz: funder is needed. So I'm going to assume we're talking about the part where we do on the funder to
[00:50:27] Alex Bouaziz: stay. Yeah. Why not? Like it's not a bad thing, right? Like when you get to a point where you've
[00:50:33] Alex Bouaziz: worked for seven, eight years in your business, there's kind of two ways to behave, right? First
[00:50:39] Alex Bouaziz: way of behaving is acting like you're going to be there for the next five years and then leaving
[00:50:43] Alex Bouaziz: after one year, which I've seen many people do. Or there is just being honest, like, hey, is this
[00:50:48] Alex Bouaziz: what you want to do for the rest of your life? Is this where you want to work? Like if you give
[00:50:51] Alex Bouaziz: you the resources, if we give you the infrastructure, you want to be here for a long time. And I, again,
[00:50:55] Alex Bouaziz: you cannot always measure those conversations and you're not maybe not always going to get the
[00:51:01] Alex Bouaziz: right honest answer. But having is important to have like frank and honest conversations here. And
[00:51:06] Alex Bouaziz: like, for example, going back to to Huffy, when we acquired Huffy, like, I was not going to run
[00:51:12] Alex Bouaziz: the IT, right? Like it's so far out of my scope in terms of like truly understanding the business,
[00:51:17] Alex Bouaziz: the buyer, the profile, what we need to build, et cetera, that like if you remove Samy and Michael,
[00:51:22] Alex Bouaziz: it's going to be very tough, right? So like the alignment here has to be very package-equity-oriented.
[00:51:26] Alex Bouaziz: It has to be very aligned that like they're going to be here for a long time and they're here to
[00:51:29] Alex Bouaziz: really build some other companies, you know, it's a bit different to where, actually, if anything,
[00:51:35] Alex Bouaziz: I don't even need the leadership, right? I just want the customers to infry and a few other things
[00:51:38] Alex Bouaziz: that they have, right? So being very upfront around like, hey, this is what we're going to need,
[00:51:42] Alex Bouaziz: just set you up for a better relationship. This is what I told you before. It's about keeping people
[00:51:45] Alex Bouaziz: happy. I've made the mistake of keeping a fund there for a year or two into a business where he
[00:51:50] Alex Bouaziz: wasn't needed anymore and it's sad. It just doesn't, you know, they lose their grid, they lose their
[00:51:56] Alex Bouaziz: their effects and it just doesn't work out. So having this conversation, I think it's part of
[00:52:00] Alex Bouaziz: creating a deal where both sides of the equation come out happy. The beautiful thing about Ventures,
[00:52:05] Harry Stebbings: it's the most forgiving business in terms of your buy price because the upside is exponential.
[00:52:12] Harry Stebbings: It's very different to P. Well, you know what, you got like a two to three X banded up,
[00:52:16] Harry Stebbings: right? In most cases, if you spend 50% more than you should, you're fucked. If you buy
[00:52:22] Harry Stebbings: Huffie, I'm just taking bullshit numbers here because I really can't remember, but if you buy
[00:52:27] Harry Stebbings: Huffie or X company at 75, not 50, if you do it well, it doesn't make a difference. How price
[00:52:38] Harry Stebbings: do you want to buy? I like to play fair market value. So revenue, growth, quality of the team,
[00:52:46] Alex Bouaziz: growth margins, potential of the business, you know, we'll pay depending on like how, and in
[00:52:53] Alex Bouaziz: that case, adding a full new line of business to deal, which is very critical, right? Not just
[00:52:57] Alex Bouaziz: being core product. We'll pay the right price. We won't overpay, we won't underpay, and we're
[00:53:03] Alex Bouaziz: known to pay the fair price. So, you know, if it was a between a 50 and 100, I'll go at 75,
[00:53:08] Alex Bouaziz: probably. Stack rank, many were in review. What's number one acquisition you've made best performing?
[00:53:18] In terms of what infrastructure, long term of the business impact or revenue? It could be either,
[00:53:24] Harry Stebbings: it could be impact through revenue, it could be impact through infrastructure. But
[00:53:29] Harry Stebbings: pay space. So, pay space is a company, amazing company. We acquired them about a year plus
[00:53:34] Alex Bouaziz: ago, 15 year old business, three brothers and one brother from another mother, that's how they like
[00:53:40] Alex Bouaziz: to talk about themselves in South Africa. And they basically had been building the payroll infrastructure
[00:53:47] Alex Bouaziz: we wanted to build for the last few years. We looked at every single company in the market,
[00:53:54] Alex Bouaziz: and I have a very aggressive corporate team as you may realize. And nothing, nothing was good.
[00:54:00] Alex Bouaziz: Most of the infrastructure, most of the technology, most of the teams were very weak. And we just
[00:54:05] Alex Bouaziz: stumbled upon that team in South Africa that not only understood payroll really well, but were forced
[00:54:12] Alex Bouaziz: to build global payroll because South Africa was such a tiny market that they had to
[00:54:17] Alex Bouaziz: expand to all countries in Africa in order to be able to create a real business that can really
[00:54:21] Alex Bouaziz: scale to their ambition. And we got realizing they had built payroll infrastructure that could
[00:54:27] Alex Bouaziz: scale in multiple countries because they were forced into it from the get go. And we met them and
[00:54:33] Alex Bouaziz: we looked at the product and we said, that is probably one of the best product we've ever seen.
[00:54:37] Alex Bouaziz: We're just going to bring it in house, give them the resources and just start building out on top
[00:54:42] Alex Bouaziz: of this, like all of the infrastructure we really need. One year into this, we've got infrastructure
[00:54:47] Alex Bouaziz: in Singapore, in Canada, Australia, in India, in Malaysia, and we're building 10 to 15 new
[00:54:53] Alex Bouaziz: engines per year. And that is giving such an incredible experience to our customers.
[00:55:00] Alex Bouaziz: If I would have gone into building payroll engines and infrastructure on my own, it would have
[00:55:05] Alex Bouaziz: taken me five to 10 years to get it right. That just fast-tracked everything we could do in like,
[00:55:12] Alex Bouaziz: literally short-term, or timeline, by five plus years in terms of getting it right.
[00:55:16] Alex Bouaziz: How much did you pay for it? Over 100 million dollars. It's pretty much over 100.
[00:55:23] Harry Stebbings: It's a nice rule, which is like you can say over-axe.
[00:55:26] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, over 100 million dollars. A bit more than that. But it's like, look, I think
[00:55:32] long-term strategy of the company, the quality of the funders, of the people of the product,
[00:55:39] Alex Bouaziz: and how much it helps from an infrastructure perspective, from a gross margin perspective,
[00:55:46] Alex Bouaziz: from an experienced perspective, is probably the Instagram to our Facebook.
[00:55:53] That's fascinating. Okay, on the flip side, you humbly said, not all of work.
[00:56:00] Harry Stebbings: You don't, I'm not expecting you to name a company. I don't want to name them. I'm not expecting
[00:56:04] Harry Stebbings: you to name a company. Name the founder. That's what I'm talking about.
[00:56:11] Harry Stebbings: But like, take me to one that didn't work. What were the lessons for you from that that impacted
[00:56:17] Harry Stebbings: how you think about the playbook? I think the ones that didn't work were mainly
[00:56:24] the ones where we said, why not instead of hell, yeah. So, you know, they come to us and they
[00:56:32] Alex Bouaziz: are at the end of the line. They have some revenue. They have something that's
[00:56:35] Alex Bouaziz: adjacent enough for it to be kind of relevant, but not in scope enough for me to truly care.
[00:56:43] And, you know, it's there. So, you're like, why not? And I've learned a lot from this. So, you
[00:56:49] Alex Bouaziz: know, we get a decent amount of acquisition in balance. If it's not a hell, yeah, I just don't
[00:56:52] Alex Bouaziz: go for this anymore. And that was like a big lesson for me. And we, you know, we did it one sort,
[00:56:59] Alex Bouaziz: what I will say, we always managed to make the best out of all of the acquisition. So, if it wasn't
[00:57:04] Alex Bouaziz: for, like, if it wasn't that hell, yeah, we still, most of the time, got really, really great talent.
[00:57:12] Alex Bouaziz: Out of this, that's shaped the company in many different ways. But now I won't go to the
[00:57:18] Alex Bouaziz: stronger as much. I won't just hire the person if I collect them. I totally agree with you.
[00:57:24] Harry Stebbings: How quickly do you know if it's not great? Pretty quickly. Yeah. We're pretty aggressive on
[00:57:29] Alex Bouaziz: integration. I think integration, we didn't talk about this, is the most important part of doing
[00:57:32] Alex Bouaziz: M&A really well. And we've got a team that's really good at it, you know, combining our HR team,
[00:57:37] Alex Bouaziz: we've our dev core dev team and our operations team. I think we can execute really fast on
[00:57:42] Alex Bouaziz: acquisitions and integrations. If there's reluctance from many parts of the business to integrate,
[00:57:48] Alex Bouaziz: it probably means that it was bad acquisition. 13 acquisitions six years with the new round,
[00:57:55] Harry Stebbings: you obviously reset the price. You have kind of a more opportunity to buy in 24 months. What is that?
[00:58:01] Harry Stebbings: It's a real value, you know. We could have risen even more and had to hire a price to. Yeah,
[00:58:07] you could do. How much could you have raised that? 20? I could have raised that higher, but
[00:58:13] Harry Stebbings: not with the people I wanted. There we go. What is the 13 acquisitions in 24 months?
[00:58:20] We're very opportunistic. I want the best funders to join us if we can acquire, acquire them,
[00:58:27] Alex Bouaziz: and they're really talented. We've been doing, you know, there'll be some news about this pretty soon,
[00:58:33] Alex Bouaziz: actually, consolidation in the market. We're starting to see a lot of companies that raise a lot
[00:58:37] Alex Bouaziz: of money in our space that want to join forces. And we've actually acquired one company that
[00:58:42] Alex Bouaziz: in the UK, a very known company in the UK in our space, and you'll know about it pretty soon.
[00:58:47] Alex Bouaziz: So that's it. You know, this and chance that we'll do a bunch of them. I wouldn't put
[00:58:52] Alex Bouaziz: a specific number on this, but like 20, like 30, like, no, probably in the next 24 months, between
[00:59:01] Alex Bouaziz: five to 10 months likely. Okay. We've already done one. So, you know, nine to go. I can't wait to
[00:59:08] Harry Stebbings: get offline. Then you can tell me what this is. I didn't know if it's one of mine. Is it one of
[00:59:12] Harry Stebbings: mine? No, it's not one of yours. He's already done. So you wouldn't know. I'm going to be honest,
[00:59:16] you did acquire another one of mine, I think, and I didn't realize until I saw the list of acquisition.
[00:59:22] Harry Stebbings: Which one? I think Atlantic money. Oh, yeah, we did. Yeah. Great example. I mean, they're a great
[00:59:28] Alex Bouaziz: team. And they, you know, brought us licenses in our payment infrastructure. We're building our
[00:59:34] Alex Bouaziz: parallel infrastructure. We're also building our payment infrastructure. They made us win two years
[00:59:39] Alex Bouaziz: in terms of how fast we could get our structure. You're profitable. Is that a strategic decision?
[00:59:44] Alex Bouaziz: Other plans in the space are not. I think our principle. So I think I told you this before, but when
[00:59:50] Alex Bouaziz: we raise our series A, and maybe you can ask an issue about this, we had to raise 4.3 million
[00:59:56] Alex Bouaziz: dollars in our seed run. We showed up to our series A pitch meeting with Andrew Since team,
[01:00:01] Alex Bouaziz: having burned, I think, 400K a year and a half later. So what I'm trying to say here is,
[01:00:08] Alex Bouaziz: as a funding principle, we've always favored sustainable growth. Right? So what's important for
[01:00:15] Alex Bouaziz: me is for the business to be sustainable over growth. And then if we can grow as well, amazing.
[01:00:23] Alex Bouaziz: And the reason for that is if I'm a company in HR and I'm burning 300 million dollars a year,
[01:00:30] Alex Bouaziz: I really, as a customer, I really want to put my team on that platform because the uncertainties
[01:00:36] Alex Bouaziz: behind it is pretty big. And for me, what's most important is to have a long-term partner that
[01:00:42] Alex Bouaziz: can really scale with me. One thing that's interesting in our good market is as we grew, we started
[01:00:47] Alex Bouaziz: signing like four or five years deals, or even seven years deals. Because payroll is something
[01:00:53] Alex Bouaziz: super stable, something you invest in, not something you change every year. It's not a type of
[01:00:57] Alex Bouaziz: software that you want to change on a yearly basis. And being able to show super strong financials,
[01:01:03] Alex Bouaziz: where you're like, hey, we're 15, 17% of beta, we're generating profit, we've been generating
[01:01:08] Alex Bouaziz: profit for three years. It's such a strong signal that you can build with us in the future and for
[01:01:13] Alex Bouaziz: the long term. So it made sense for us. If you look at YC, it's a very valuable source of getting
[01:01:21] Harry Stebbings: in early. Who gets more YC companies? You're a rippling. I have no idea. I think that YC funders are
[01:01:31] Alex Bouaziz: more and more international and they move to the big area. So by design, I think a lot of them
[01:01:37] Alex Bouaziz: understand the value of deals straight away and want to hire from back home. But the truth is now
[01:01:42] Alex Bouaziz: we do everything. We do us payroll, we do HR, we kind of like the full stack solution for
[01:01:46] Alex Bouaziz: early stage funders as well. So I think our market share there is pretty high.
[01:01:50] Alex Bouaziz: If you had to IPO in the next 12 months, what would you most need to change about deal?
[01:01:56] 12 is a bit short. Give me a bit more time. Why is 12 short? No, seriously, like genuinely,
[01:02:02] Harry Stebbings: at a billion in revenue and profitable and growing the way you are. Legitimately, it's not that at
[01:02:08] Harry Stebbings: this stage, this is a personal choice. No, it's more. There's like socks compliance infrastructure,
[01:02:14] Alex Bouaziz: there's some leadership high risk we need to have in place in order to be able to go out. There
[01:02:18] Alex Bouaziz: is these things to be done there. And my take is you want to have like four or five clean quarters
[01:02:24] Alex Bouaziz: with your exacting before you go public as well. So there's a couple different things that play here.
[01:02:28] Alex Bouaziz: What would need to change most significantly? One. The public? Yeah. I think it's just about being ready.
[01:02:36] Alex Bouaziz: Right? Like if our infrastructure is ready, if our compliance is ready, if our leadership team
[01:02:40] Alex Bouaziz: is ready, which I'm just reiterating from my last answer, then you know, we'll consider going
[01:02:45] Alex Bouaziz: out. That's kind of our plan. Totally. If you want to be a public company CEO,
[01:02:50] think that as long as I'm the best person to run this business, no matter whether it's public
[01:02:54] Alex Bouaziz: or private, I would like to be the one running it. Best and most thing about working with your dad.
[01:03:00] I love working with my dad. There is honestly not a lot of negative things before
[01:03:05] Alex Bouaziz: working with my dad. I think the best thing is wholeheartedly trust him. And he's able to drive
[01:03:10] Alex Bouaziz: a lot of decisions in a way that comes with experience that I don't have. I'd say if you want to say
[01:03:16] Alex Bouaziz: one negative thing is like a lot of people have a strong misconception of working with family,
[01:03:22] Alex Bouaziz: at least in the United States, which was like a little weird to me. But most of the people that know
[01:03:28] Alex Bouaziz: us very well, they understand the dynamics between the two of us and how we work. And the closer you
[01:03:34] Alex Bouaziz: are to us, the more you understand how valuable the relationship really is. I work with my brother.
[01:03:38] Harry Stebbings: And actually, I think the trust that you have with a brother, a father, or whatever family
[01:03:44] Harry Stebbings: is so special, the only last night I have is there has to be a hierarchy, which is like a co-ceo
[01:03:49] Harry Stebbings: ship. No, the hierarchy is thankfully, I think, you know, my dad kind of looks at the business and
[01:03:57] Alex Bouaziz: and understands that I'm leading it and allows me to despite sometimes his very strong opinions,
[01:04:02] Alex Bouaziz: allows me to make the mistakes that I want to make. Whereas he had the strongest opinion
[01:04:07] Harry Stebbings: if disagreed with him. Many times, actually, we disagreed all the time. I think he hates that story,
[01:04:13] Alex Bouaziz: but the biggest thing he disagreed on with me, which actually was the best decision we ever made
[01:04:20] Alex Bouaziz: as a company, was building up our infrastructure for our employer, a freckard product. Basically,
[01:04:27] Alex Bouaziz: the way I'm playing a freckard work is we enable you as a company to be able to hire anyone anywhere
[01:04:33] Alex Bouaziz: without having a local entity. We have local entities all around the world and we employ people
[01:04:37] Alex Bouaziz: on your behalf. As a more risk-overs person and, you know, at acting CFO at the time, looked at the
[01:04:44] Alex Bouaziz: business and told us, hey, if you actually own the infrastructure, you take on so much liability.
[01:04:52] Alex Bouaziz: Let's work with partners, which was how the old school model was. At the beginning, I push back
[01:04:58] Alex Bouaziz: and I said, you know, partners, they work on Windows Vista, they don't have the same care for
[01:05:02] Alex Bouaziz: customers, they don't understand service the way I think about service, the way you think about
[01:05:06] Alex Bouaziz: service, which is service of today, it's not going to work. When your CFO says, like, too much risk,
[01:05:14] Alex Bouaziz: you're like, okay, we'll try. We try for two months and I can back and I said, open the entities.
[01:05:21] Alex Bouaziz: Which he pushed back on until he decided not to and today our employer freckard product generates,
[01:05:26] Alex Bouaziz: I think, over 25, 30 million dollars a month right. So best decision for the business ever.
[01:05:32] Alex Bouaziz: Yeah, that. I love the way you chose the way you want. The good thing is,
[01:05:38] Alex Bouaziz: everybody is super aligned. We just want the best for the business, the best for shareholders,
[01:05:42] Alex Bouaziz: the best for our employees and having people that you can look at in the eye and tell the true
[01:05:48] Alex Bouaziz: fact because anyway, you trust each other is a huge advantage. By the way, people don't realize
[01:05:57] Alex Bouaziz: that my co-founder is like my sister. I have three sisters, so I wouldn't say the sister
[01:06:03] Alex Bouaziz: that I never had, but she's my fourth sister in many way. I think when you are a lot of people
[01:06:08] Alex Bouaziz: like to think about funding companies with people as marriage, I think about a bit more as family
[01:06:14] Alex Bouaziz: for the sake of my wife being happy. I think this type of relationship is super critical and the
[01:06:19] Alex Bouaziz: more trust you can establish, the better. If it's trust that was given by nature, even better,
[01:06:26] Alex Bouaziz: if not, you need to build that type of trust over time.
[01:06:29] Alex Bouaziz: Did I want to do a quick fire round with you? I say a short statement, you give me your immediate
[01:06:34] Harry Stebbings: thoughts. What if you change your mind on in the last 12 months, being much more prepared
[01:06:41] Alex Bouaziz: across different topics? We had policy situations, litigations, PR. I think a lot of those things
[01:06:50] Alex Bouaziz: there showed and exposed a lot of things in the company that we hadn't thought about. I don't
[01:06:55] Alex Bouaziz: exactly wake up thinking, we need to be really strong at policy. We need to be really strong at
[01:06:59] Alex Bouaziz: litigation. We're much more prepared and we're consistently thinking about where do we need to
[01:07:06] Alex Bouaziz: reinforce ourselves, which is external to purity product and customer experience, which maybe
[01:07:11] Alex Bouaziz: we didn't do as much before. Are you a wartime or a peacetime CEO? I think I'm in constant
[01:07:17] Harry Stebbings: wartime, sadly. Do you kind of enjoy the fight? Is there a massacred stake? Enjoyment.
[01:07:27] I like fighting people in product and go to market. I want you to kick my ass because you build
[01:07:33] Alex Bouaziz: a better product. I'm going to give you a round of for your money because I'm pretty decent at
[01:07:38] Alex Bouaziz: building good products. I love the fight when it comes to fighting through who is going to serve
[01:07:45] Alex Bouaziz: a customer better. I think there are some amazing companies in our space building that way.
[01:07:50] All of the money that flew into this space and the quality of the people that we have just makes
[01:07:54] Alex Bouaziz: it a super, super interesting fight. Other fights, not my style. I'm not a very nice to just
[01:08:01] person. How would you have liked to repent for a brave? Well, I think you should read Arlos
[01:08:06] Alex Bouaziz: at Indelaware. Three years of poor way of competing in the market. You should have a read. Again,
[01:08:14] Alex Bouaziz: I think a lot of those things are tied to old stories and old demons and we're in the crossroad,
[01:08:20] Alex Bouaziz: but it's okay. It's not deterring us and we're able to perform for customers. So it's all that
[01:08:25] Alex Bouaziz: matters. Which founded you think is most underrated today? I would have said Tariq a year ago from
[01:08:32] Alex Bouaziz: Kalshi. Did you introduce me to him? Three or four years ago? Yes, he was one of the most underrated
[01:08:38] SPEAKER_00: funders I ever knew. And then the guy just turned the heat around like fucking crazy. And he's not one
[01:08:45] SPEAKER_00: of the most hype companies in the world. So I've actually learned to love two founders that I think
[01:08:52] Alex Bouaziz: are some of the most underrated founders in the world. And I think their companies are amazing
[01:08:58] Alex Bouaziz: and everything they'll touch in the future will be just as amazing. I don't know if you know them,
[01:09:02] Alex Bouaziz: but the first one is Johannes from Kri. Dude, he's in project Europe. I met him through project
[01:09:08] Harry Stebbings: Europe. He invested in it. What a dude. He's one of the most underrated funders I've met.
[01:09:15] Alex Bouaziz: So like very clear figure. Why do you say that with him? I think he's the right mix of clear
[01:09:21] Alex Bouaziz: finger first principle and at the same time relentless. And he's got that like hands on fire
[01:09:31] Alex Bouaziz: that someone that has built a 4,000 plus people company usually induces. And on the same spirit,
[01:09:40] Alex Bouaziz: I don't know if you know Fred from Boy. But those two guys, I've been falling in love with Swedish
[01:09:45] Alex Bouaziz: tech recently. I think a lot of people have it. I've been falling in love for the last three years.
[01:09:50] Alex Bouaziz: And those are two of the people that I've met that I know are going to either take those companies
[01:09:56] Alex Bouaziz: to huge numbers or build new businesses that are going to be just significant. Why have you been
[01:10:02] Alex Bouaziz: falling in love with Swedish tech? I think the mentality of the funder there is really good. I think
[01:10:07] Alex Bouaziz: they're good people, honest people that truly care about building great companies and great product.
[01:10:14] Alex Bouaziz: There are those told giants that are sweet at the same time. They're in the ecosystem where like
[01:10:19] Alex Bouaziz: it's some reminds me in many ways of the Israeli ecosystem where it's a very tight-knit community.
[01:10:25] Alex Bouaziz: If you look at the successful Swedish funders as well, right? Like the clarinas of the word or
[01:10:30] Alex Bouaziz: the Spotify's of the word. Daniel Sebastian, they kind of paved the way for those funders to be
[01:10:35] Alex Bouaziz: able to build great companies. And I think they've really capitalized on this in the way that no one has
[01:10:39] Alex Bouaziz: had. How do you feel when I say this? I love riding your hand as two, but I think they're both in
[01:10:43] Harry Stebbings: really shitty markets. I bet on the funder in that kind of business. Remember? I do, but do that
[01:10:50] Harry Stebbings: scale you got to fucking add in some more. No, for sure, but I think they're going to have very
[01:10:54] Alex Bouaziz: long cars. So, oh, I agree. And if they're listening, let me do your seed of your next company.
[01:11:00] Harry Stebbings: Who do you not have on the board that you've most like to have on the board?
[01:11:04] Well, he's going to love this. I really, really love Alfred and in from Sequoia.
[01:11:13] Alex Bouaziz: You know, he's going to be sad about that one. He passed on my seed run when I had no idea what I was
[01:11:18] Alex Bouaziz: doing. Me and Shul met him in a coffee shop during or right after YC. And I've just learned to
[01:11:27] Alex Bouaziz: know him over the years. And just like, I actually think he's one of the best investors in
[01:11:31] Alex Bouaziz: the world. Why? He cares about funders in a way that's very rare. And he understands the businesses,
[01:11:42] Alex Bouaziz: a lot more deeply than a lot of board members want to. And I saw that firsthand, right? I mean,
[01:11:47] Alex Bouaziz: Alfred is on the board of Kalshi and Tariq is a very close friend. And I think the impact
[01:11:51] Alex Bouaziz: Alfred has had on the business is very significant. Same thing for Dordash and others. I think he's
[01:11:57] Alex Bouaziz: the right mix of sweet, sharp and well-advised person that has seen things before. And I think he was
[01:12:07] Alex Bouaziz: an operator before as well. Can I ask you, why do you not have sequoia on the cap table?
[01:12:13] Alex Bouaziz: Ask him, not me. Suddenly they invested in every competitor you can think of.
[01:12:19] I have a great relationship with the team. Honestly, I think... You mind investors doing
[01:12:23] Alex Bouaziz: competitive investing. Not as much as I used to. Obviously, if you're investing in a competitor
[01:12:29] Alex Bouaziz: that I care about, right? Then I cannot share as much as I can. I used to share with you. But
[01:12:36] Alex Bouaziz: I've grown to careless. And in that specific case, I just... I have a great relationship with the
[01:12:42] Alex Bouaziz: with the sequoia team. I think Rola, Sean, Juliano, all of those guys are amazing. And like, you know,
[01:12:48] Alex Bouaziz: I get to work with them in different ways. But you just ask me, like, you know, who would I have
[01:12:54] Alex Bouaziz: wanted on the cap table that I don't have today? It's definitely them and it's probably definitely
[01:12:58] Alex Bouaziz: offered. Final one, when you look forward, I like to end on a tone of optimism. What are you most
[01:13:04] Harry Stebbings: excited for for the next five, ten years? Like, what is this gives me fucking energy? Look, the way
[01:13:10] Harry Stebbings: I think about our business, which a lot of people find super boring, I actually think this is
[01:13:15] Alex Bouaziz: why you passed. Not because you don't think there's a lot of potential into payroll, but because you
[01:13:20] Alex Bouaziz: think it's a boring business. I don't think it's boring because the way I think about this, and this is
[01:13:24] Alex Bouaziz: what really drives me, right? When I think about payroll HR, I think about such significant moment
[01:13:31] Alex Bouaziz: in the life of people. It's where you get your paycheck. It's where you get your your pay slips,
[01:13:36] Alex Bouaziz: your mortgage letter, your business visa, your payments, right? It's where you submit your expenses.
[01:13:41] Alex Bouaziz: So it's like a place that you interact with all the time in like very unique key moments and
[01:13:47] Alex Bouaziz: events in your life, and it's like super disregarded, right? I've never had someone come up to me
[01:13:52] Alex Bouaziz: and tell me, I fucking love my payroll software. It's the best thing I've ever used, right? And I'm
[01:13:56] Alex Bouaziz: like, when you're in such critical moments of the life cycle of people, right? New jobs, like
[01:14:02] Alex Bouaziz: uncertainty, like, you can build such a strong relationship with your end users if you actually
[01:14:08] Alex Bouaziz: care to invest into the relationship you have there. And you can create going back to Brenda
[01:14:13] Alex Bouaziz: Wereness. I think a very, very strong brand where hopefully one day people will tell you, well,
[01:14:18] Alex Bouaziz: I fucking love my payroll software. Like, deal is the place I want to be hired on is the place I
[01:14:22] Alex Bouaziz: want to be paid. And that gets me excited, right? Like building the first truly global brand that
[01:14:28] Alex Bouaziz: you love as an end user to get paid on and that really shares your value and understands your
[01:14:35] Alex Bouaziz: moments is like what really in the long term of the business gets me excited. I got to ask one more,
[01:14:41] Harry Stebbings: you said critical moments in life. I've just become an uncle. And I'm going into the dad direction.
[01:14:49] Harry Stebbings: I just want to ask for my brother, what's your single biggest advice to my brother on what it
[01:14:55] Harry Stebbings: takes to be a great papa? She's like six months old. Well, she's older than mine, so it's a
[01:15:00] SPEAKER_00: tougher to say my baby three months old. Yeah, only go one. It's my first baby. So it's been a
[01:15:06] Alex Bouaziz: very fun year as you can realize. How do you go to help? No, not yet. My parents and my wife's
[01:15:14] Alex Bouaziz: parents are super helpful. She's still little. I want to spend time with her. That's the perk of
[01:15:19] Alex Bouaziz: remote work. She, you know, I'm seeing her truly grow up, which is very unique. And I very value
[01:15:24] Alex Bouaziz: this in a way that most people can't understand. But you do you do secondary so you can have a
[01:15:31] Harry Stebbings: night, Nanny. That's why secondary exists. I maybe we were jinxing it. I think my daughter realized
[01:15:38] Alex Bouaziz: that anything was not going to happen for now. So she decided to sleep through the night. But no,
[01:15:42] Alex Bouaziz: look, we were very lucky that, you know, my wife has a nice, Matt, Matt live policy and we're
[01:15:48] Alex Bouaziz: able to deal with her and she's three months old. She's like changed how I view the world in many
[01:15:53] Alex Bouaziz: different ways. And you know, she definitely is a very life changing moment. I never realized what
[01:16:00] Alex Bouaziz: people like what people really meant by this. But like in the back of your head, the thinking about
[01:16:05] Alex Bouaziz: the like small moments you're going to get to spend with her is like, it's a big deal. So I think
[01:16:09] Alex Bouaziz: your brother would probably would have tips for me more than the opposite. But the one thing I would say
[01:16:12] Alex Bouaziz: is like, here, this is where remote work actually shines, right? Like actually you get to see
[01:16:17] Alex Bouaziz: her every day and a lot more. I think then the average dad dude, I so appreciate the friendship.
[01:16:22] Harry Stebbings: I so appreciate you. Thank you so much to this. This has been fantastic dude.
[01:16:26] Harry Stebbings: Well, thank you so much for taking the time. And by the way, I think you're the first podcast
[01:16:29] Alex Bouaziz: I do in a while. So I don't know if that means that I'm back to less working, but I don't think so.
