[00:00:00] The PE on Nvidia is to give that sound bite that I love.
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_00: It's lower than the PE on Costco.
[00:00:05] Right?
[00:00:05] I don't care about your talk.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to hear about your pilot.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_00: I want to smell that your team is in high progressive mode.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_00: If it is, I think you can come back.
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_00: I do not think you can push your team too hard.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_00: I think you should push them as hard as the business needs to go.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_00: And if they leave, it's great.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: Salesforce could be the next Google.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: It could be in 18 to 24 months.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_00: We could be like, oh my God, Asian Force crushed it.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: All these startups, we didn't need them
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_00: because Asian Force is so good.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_01: The great American tech Mag 7 suck more of their world's
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_01: profit dollars out of the rest of humanity.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: Go team.
[00:00:37] Ready to go?
[00:00:49] My word, we get to do it in person.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_02: It is very exciting to be at the new upgrade of 20 VC Studios.
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_00: It's exciting here.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: I mean, thank you.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_02: I'm, Roy, we miss you.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_02: It's not the same without you here, but thank you for joining us.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: You're welcome.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: You'll survive.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_02: You know what we will, but we want to start with the news of the day.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_02: Anthropics mega AI deal.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_02: So Anthropics secured up to $15 billion from Microsoft and NVIDIA,
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_02: pushing valuation to $350 billion with commitments for $30 billion
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_02: in Azure Compute.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_02: You can see I'm learning from prior episodes
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_02: and setting the context.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_02: Let's start there.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_02: How did we analyze that?
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_02: How do we break that down?
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_00: It was pretty funny watching Twitter this week.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_00: We're like a week ago, they're like, open AI is dominant.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_00: Three days ago, it was like Gemini 3 Pro is Mark Benningoff's,
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_00: like, I'll never go back to Chatchee BD again.
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_00: And today, it's Cloud 4.5 has killed crushed everything.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: My point is, like, there's just no stability, right?
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_00: There's no stability in seed investing.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_00: There's no stability in Anthropics.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_00: So my meta learning, which I wouldn't even have had a couple weeks ago,
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_00: is more power to them because I think you need infinite capital
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: when there's no stability, like you need infinite capital.
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_00: I just, it's just so funny.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_00: I mean, literally three days ago, it was Gemini today.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: It's Anthropic.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: What will it be next week?
[00:02:15] Yeah.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I might argue that the stability of the commentator's stability
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_01: might be a lot weaker than the stability of the actual market share
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: of the incumbents.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_01: It's, yeah.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_01: In other words, a lot of, you know, we kind of run from God well
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_01: to God well, on opinions.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: But there was a bunch of stuff in it, but in the announcement.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_01: I mean, first of all, you glossed over the key fact,
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_01: it was from Microsoft.
[00:02:37] This was the Nvidia Microsoft commitment to Anthropic.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: And Microsoft was the, you know, was, you know, in a monogamous
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: relationship with OpenAI and then OpenAI wanted an Open
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: Marriage and Microsoft said, well, if you want an Open Marriage,
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: I want one too.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_01: So this is probably inevitable in the context of that.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: So that's probably the first big piece of news from it, which is,
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: it's the Microsoft and then the structure of the day, it's the usual thing.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_01: You know, you get $15 billion, you promise to spend $30 billion.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_01: That structure we've seen before.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: And then the other interesting thing kind of, you didn't mention it,
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: but in the same announcement, I think, Anthropic also said they're going to
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: break Brown down a physical data center.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_01: So that's another one of the model companies saying it's not enough to rely on
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: compute from your service providers, be it Azure, be it AWS.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_01: They also are looking at doing physical data centers themselves.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_01: So it's what you said, Jason, it's another chapter in the infinite capital
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_01: and everybody's sleeping with everybody wore.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_01: Have we just decided we just don't care about round trip revenue,
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: like many things in this era we just given up caring.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: There's so many things we used to care about in the past.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: And now we just want to get rich with AI, we don't care.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: In a bull market, nobody cares about everything.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: And then in a bear market, everybody discovers why you were meant to care.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_01: And now we're in the don't care part of the trade.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_01: And you know, and again, as we said before, provided it works, it's all fine.
[00:04:05] Right.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_01: And for what it's worth, if you're a chip provider and you have to stick some
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_01: money in one model provider, this one feels like a pretty good bet.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_01: Zooming out of all the round tripping deals, I would argue,
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: Microsoft and traffic and video deal probably has better principles and upside than most.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_01: I mean, some of the other round tripping deals look like they're already, you know, a bit shaky.
[00:04:28] Totally get you there.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_02: You said about kind of the importance of verticalization in terms of the data center
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_02: play that's added onto that deal.
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_02: I think another very important bit in use was Google train, Gemini 3.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_02: Obviously people very impressed with the quality of Gemini 3, Benny often included.
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_02: And saying that it's trained on its own TPUs, their own chips for people that are on
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_02: wire of TPUs, Elon's AI company X AI developing its own AI inference chips, question of verticalization.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_02: As we said there with owning the data center layer, does everyone now need to own the chip
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_02: player as well as we see more and more with TPUs with Elon?
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_02: Is that the next phase of verticalization?
[00:05:08] As you guys know, I use a replete two hours a day, a little less on my London trip.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: No, but it's good to learn, right?
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm in the top one for sending users.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_00: Lovable's great too.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: You know, they added Gemini 3 Pro the day came out as did everybody, right?
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_00: I instantly used it.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: It was great.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_00: It actually wasn't so much better.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_00: Okay?
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_00: That what everyone said is it's better for design.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: Lovable said it, Rebel everyone said it.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: I would say it was 20% better for design.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_00: But that wasn't the interesting part is I used it.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: It worked great.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: And then in my next prompt, I rolled back to Claude.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: It was fine.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_00: I also did a lot of work.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: Not only other different models, but abstracting a couple of layers above.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: We're switching between TPUs and models and I don't care.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: And I'm not saying these aren't huge issues, but the idea that NVIDIA is unstoppable
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_00: because of the software and hardware connection because we have to have GPUs.
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_00: I know there's a lot of truth there, but literally as an end user, I went right back and forth
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_00: from today.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_00: No issue.
[00:05:59] TPUs, GPUs, LLMs, all in the space of 60 seconds, or maybe three minutes.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: I think I want to build a little bit on that.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I think, and let's just talk about TPUs first of all, not at gunned chip level.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_01: The big picture question is, you're asking is does every large, vertical integrated
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: company have to do their own chips versus buying from NVIDIA?
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_01: And the reason you post that question is Google obviously has their own TPUs, which is
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_01: an internal chip, which I believe for what they do is faster.
[00:06:32] I think the interesting thing here is what you got to do is separate 90% by the way,
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_01: by customer count of NVIDIA's customers.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_01: If you're spending a million, two million, five million, ten million within NVIDIA,
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_01: it's in the noise and you're not going to design the mountain, build your own chip.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_01: That would be madness.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_01: The odd thing about the NVIDIA business, unlike most other businesses, is four or five
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_01: of their customers account for 80% of the revenue, something like that, 70, 80%.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_01: Looking at the other side, if you're spending, like Google is spending 90 billion this year
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_01: on CapEx.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_01: You're roughly a thumb is around 40% of the total dollars are on compute.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_01: So if they were buying NVIDIA chips, they'd be spending, you know, what's that, 36 billion
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_01: dollars on compute, on really just on chips.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: If you're spending 36 billion dollars, and then that 36 billion dollars is, you know,
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_01: knowing NVIDIA at 75% plus gross margins, which means you're handing NVIDIA, if you were
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_01: buying all that from NVIDIA, you're handing them north of 20 billion dollars a year of
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_01: profit at the margin.
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_01: At that point, you say to yourself, well, you know, it's hard to build a chip.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_01: And if I was spending 10 million, I wouldn't bother.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_01: It's probably going to cost me, you know, back when venture guys did chips, it was 200 million
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_01: bucks to get to a chip.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: Probably today it's a billion.
[00:07:48] But if you're spending 20, if you're giving someone 20 billion dollars a profit a year,
[00:07:53] and you can say to yourself, maybe I can invest a billion, maybe a billion a year for
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: five years, get a compelling chip, you got to look at that.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_01: And the reason all that makes sense is just how concentrated the customers are.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: And it's the old rule.
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_01: The more customers you have, the easier it is to charge them a little more and the harder
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_01: is for them to take your margin back.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: Like when Intel was winning in the CPU wars, they had, you know, pick a number 100 million
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_01: customers, because we're all customers.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: We all get two on a buck for our Pentium.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_01: Nobody cared.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_01: In this case, NVIDIA has five or six customers that are spending the vast bulk of the revenue
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_01: with NVIDIA that make in 75% gross margins.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_01: So every one of those big customers should be saying, it's damn hard to build a semiconductor.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: I probably a little bit, just a great one point Jason made.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_01: I don't think that it's easy to build a TPU that can also be rolled out to everyone
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: with all the cutest support that NVIDIA has.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_01: But even if it's just used internally, first of all, and I can save that 20 billion dollars
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_01: of profit, hell, I got to look at that.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: If I'm Google, I got to look at that if I'm Amazon, but definitely going to look at that
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_01: if I'm Tesla.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_01: So yeah, I think that's an interesting medium term pressure point on the NVIDIA profitability
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_01: story.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_01: It's not overnight and it's not going to make sense for most people.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_01: You have to be pretty damn smart technically to ship a comparable ship.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: But in a world where you only have six customers that matter, having one of them say, I got
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_01: a better product myself, is a significant event.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_00: Especially if I'm open AI, which is burning even more money on Thropic, right?
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: I've got to be thinking, man, if I'm waiting for, if I could cut two thirds of the cost of
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_00: my compute, think about my business.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: I go from one of the biggest cash, hemorrhaging businesses of all time to a profitable
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: business.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: Maybe two thirds isn't quite the number, but I'd be relentless about, I mean, the bar keeps
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: going up.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_00: We talk about it.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately, if I can cut 20 billion, 30 billion, all of it, it's a big deal.
[00:09:57] I replay what we've just said in the last five minutes.
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_02: It is the most obvious threat to Nvidia's business.
[00:10:04] What are Nvidia thinking about this internally?
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_02: Jensen must see this very clearly.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_02: How does he respond and how do they protect their business in the wake of being so concentrated
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_02: and losing those customers?
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, first of all, there's a reason why they sponsor the core weeds and the next generation
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_01: of Neoclouds because they're like, those guys ain't going to build their own ship.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_01: So a simple, humble 20 billion market cap company does not have the capacity to build
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: their own ship.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: It suits them to have the market for cloud, compute in AI be a little more diversified
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_01: than concentrated.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_01: Anything that can make that happen is in their favor.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_01: To some extent, that's all they can do.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_01: They don't have a ton of leverage over Google.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_01: And obviously now Google is starting to talk about selling those TPUs to others.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: It's a threat.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_01: Now what they would say and they would be correct is for most uses because they have such
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_01: dominance, such validation of the CUDA software layer, for most customers, it's going to be
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_01: too much brain depth to switch from the GPU you know and love to something new, right?
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: Because there's probably significant activation energy, right?
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_01: And that's going to be true for most customers.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_01: The long tail of Nvidia customers aren't going to do it.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_01: But you write Harry.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_01: The threat is all you have to do is peel off one or two of those big margin cows and
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_01: you're done.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_01: Now the funny thing is the only thing that perhaps, and this will be interesting to watch,
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: that perhaps protects them is the biggest potential alternative customers for the Google
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: TPU or Google Sworn enemies.
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_01: You know, they should, you know, Microsoft, Amazon, maybe open AI to the extent they wanted
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: to data sense would be the obvious next places to go because they're the other people who
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_01: are doing so much compute that it will be worth their while to try and digest TPUs.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_01: So that will be, and that's interesting from Google's game theory perspective.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_01: Do they do that?
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_01: Take the capital or do they continue to just keep it in house and have a structural cost
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_01: advantage?
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_01: Don't have the answer there, but it's outside and video is, I think Harry, I rambled
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: a little, but to your point, it is to some extent, there's only so much you can do if
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: you only have five customers and one of them wants to diversify away from you.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_01: It's the core risk of McCall, of search, of cheering, of all of these data providers, being
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_02: that they have all two customers that are more than 50% there after you've all of them.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_02: And the fact that you're taking all the risk that you're willing to underwrite there is
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_02: that actually it's not a core function of matter or Amazon or Microsoft, and they won't
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_02: go after the data acquisition market themselves because they can just spend the money with
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_02: them and it's good enough.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_02: I actually think going to the opening the show, I actually think we're just ignoring the
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_00: risk because the Nvidia's numbers are just too good.
[00:12:44] No, that's what we're all doing.
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_00: We're ignoring it.
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_00: This is systemic risk.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: We've all, I mean, back in the day, Twilio losing Uber is a customer 12% of a revenue
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: gone.
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_00: This would be much bigger, but when the numbers are there, we're just ignoring it.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: We're just ignoring it.
[00:13:01] You don't wish you invested in Nvidia five years ago?
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: I mean, of course you do.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: You've got to play the game on the field, even public market investors have to play the
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: game on the field.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_00: So do you think Nvidia is overvalued today?
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_02: I mean, no, the amount of compute, I mean, what did Google's head of infrastructure say
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_00: this week?
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_00: Google needs a thousand times more compute in five years than it is today?
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_00: A thousand X.
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's difficult to believe Nvidia won't be a leader in that time.
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_00: So over simplifying where all the chips will go and black will go, that's a lot of growth
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_00: to invest in a thousand X on compute, if not chips, a thousand X.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: That's better than most SaaS companies right now.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: I don't know many SaaS companies predicting a thousand X growth at scale.
[00:13:43] But I want to take that apart, but I actually want to go back to the first question you asked
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_01: to kind of, you know, customer concentration because they often think it's interesting
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_01: for people who listen, you know, to get a sense of, you know, not just in the public
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_01: markets, but how we all think of it as investors because you're absolutely right, Harry, the
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_01: big question on all the data labeling is a good example.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_01: Any of the AI compute coattached bets was there's only four or five customers here, right?
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_01: And the logic you had to use was in the hyper-grote period, your customers be it open AI or someone
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_01: else, it's not going to have time to optimize for efficiency, they're going to be running fast.
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_01: And in that period of time, you know, you can create huge value when we saw scale AI
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_01: created huge value.
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_01: And then you're right, the fear would be when things slow down and people start moving
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_01: from optimizing effectiveness to optimizing efficiency, then those businesses get tough.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_01: And as an investor, you're always tempted to do them.
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I was, I will admit, I was scared of the data labeling companies and I was wrong.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_01: There was a period of a couple of years where they clearly worked and worked really well.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_01: The interesting thing will be they will they continue to work for the next, you know, three
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_01: to four years if in fact, you know, dollars get a little more scarce.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_01: I mean, how do you, I mean, how do you guys, two guys think about those kind of, you know,
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_01: whenever, how do you think about investing a company that logically only has four or five big customers?
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_01: Specifically on the data labeling market, this is one where I've interviewed the founders
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_02: of churing scale, McCall, invisible, I've pretty much interviewed all of them, search.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_02: And the one thing that made me actually feel incredibly comfortable investing in the category
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_02: was understanding the specialized data requirements that the large providers need.
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_02: I hadn't quite thought about the very verticalized data requirements, whether it's surgical data,
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_02: whether it's bookkeeping, accounting data, that all of these different players are going so deep into.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_02: And it's so specific. And in some cases, strange and weird, that the large customers are never
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_02: going to churn or pull away from them because they are so verticalized.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_02: And when I got comfortable with that, I was like, oh, I'm okay to take this risk and underwrite it
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_02: because I don't think they're going to churn.
[00:15:54] That's super helpful and insightful, Howard. Yeah, because you're right.
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: If you only have a small number of customers, then you know at some point they're going to optimize.
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_01: So then you get into you have to have something they can optimize around.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_01: And then after, if you have that, then the last skill you need to have,
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_01: the next skill you need to have as a CEO is an ability to play extremely good poker.
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_01: Because you know, you got to look them in the eye and say, I know that your 20 million dollar
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_01: contract is my biggest contract. But I also know that my data is your most important data.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_01: So, and you write, there's drama, there's tension, but you write, you wouldn't want to be doing a
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: commodity data labeling play when they start to get to efficiency. ASMR that sells primarily to
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_01: TSMC is the same dynamic, you know, one seller, one buyer to a rounding error. And it's manager,
[00:16:38] SPEAKER_01: it's not like you can't build businesses in that space, but you have to have something really
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_01: unique to avoid them pounding you all over. The kind of deciding fact of the swing vote in favor
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_01: of taking the risk and those kind of deals is the speed at which the underlying market is moving
[00:16:55] will dictate it is kind of they get out of jail free card. It says, yeah, it because in theory,
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_01: you know, you could say you've only got three customers, they will grind you down.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_01: But if they've just got other shit to do for the next five years, going to business,
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_01: they never get around to it. Right. It's interesting. So I think that's to some extent what's
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_01: happened in the last four or five years, but in the day live and then zooming out the Nvidia
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_01: business at a higher level. Yes, maybe in some logical world, maybe all of Microsoft Amazon
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_01: and Google should already have had their own TPU equivalent because they shouldn't know
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_01: to do this. But there's bigger fish to fry for a long time. And you're in a one fast world.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_01: If you're in video and you're saying, but I have the product now, it's ready to ship. You want to
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_01: get your compute rolling. You can, you know, you can make money for a long time, even in a concentrated
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_01: market. It's only when it slows down. And that's why if I look back on the day with a label thing,
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: how it is the earlier you are, what the more hyper growth you have ahead of you, the easier it is
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_01: to be undifferentiated. And by the time the growth slows down, you better either be differentiated
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_01: as Jason was, you better be excited. Well, I'll tell you, just listen, it's all that matters
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_00: is growth today, right? I mean, even Palantir is extremely concentrated at its scale compared to
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_00: what we're used to. It's part of the AI world. But the wonderful thing about the
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_01: triple digit customers, doesn't it? I want to go back to the Nvidia overvalued question.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_01: I phrase it differently. I mean, it gets to the same thing. If you look at today's revenue,
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_01: it's not overvalued. The PE on Nvidia is to give that sound bite that I love. It's lower than
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_01: the PE on Costco. And it was, you know, we talked last week about the earnings before they came out.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_01: And we recognized it was an odd time because the show would come out after it. But it all played
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: out exactly what we thought, which is there was no surprise on the earnings because all the
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_01: hyperscalers had announced the quarter week month beforehand. And they'd all said, right now we
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_01: are buying more stuff. We are a capex. We are constrained by capacity. So there was actually no data
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_01: in the Nvidia earnings earnings, right? Of any significance. The question is the valuation of
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_01: Nvidia is effectively a function of the end demand for compute, right? So if you want to figure it
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_01: as long as the demand continues roughly where it is today, Nvidia is far less aggressively priced
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_01: as I say them, Costco are then Cisco in the in 99, right on a PE basis. The question so effectively
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_01: isn't video of overvalued question really translates to is the demand for compute as it manifests
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_01: in 2526, a steady state demand or is it a cyclical peak and you know, two, three years from now,
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_01: we're not going to be spending 90 billion dollars. That's the primary question. You write the
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_01: secondary question is the whole TPU and substitute question. But I would argue the first one is the
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_01: primary one. As long as the hyperscalers and the model provider model companies continue to invest
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_01: massively aggressively in compute, then with the exception of the substitute risk in video business
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_01: is safe. So you're really saying at the margin what you're saying is is Microsoft going to increase
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_01: another 30% next year is on topic on invest and compute. And right now all those answers to those
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_01: questions are yes. I mean, you know, kind of my takeaway on the recent kind of you can call them
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_01: convulsions when things only move by 5% is not some kind of great correction. It's more the markets
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_01: doing a pretty decent job of saying all you companies that are investing who's doing it? Well,
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_01: Google you can invest more. Your stock goes up. Who's doing it badly? Oracle you. Your stock
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_01: goes down and the market is doing what your markets are meant to do, which is send a signal. Right.
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_01: And right now the signal that's not sending is oh my god, don't invest in anything, which obviously
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_01: would be catastrophic for Nvidia and for all of us because it's 7% of everyone's S&P. The market
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_01: sending a signal that says those of you that have good businesses investing are doing just fine,
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_01: go team, go Google, go Microsoft. And those of you that are a bit out there on the risk
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_01: continuum probably should be thinking about that as a dual-lingor shareholder on feeling the
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_02: pain. Yeah, it's been brutal 70%. Proocial. You know, it's funny on the hyper scale,
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_00: a hyper scale is presaging in video, right? You're right. There shouldn't be any surprise because
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: they've already said what's happening. I mean, I remember my first fund. I had a hedge fund invest.
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_00: The only reason they invested was to get that data from the portfolio. Like if you have a portfolio
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_00: company with direct linear exposure to Nvidia, you will know in real time how Nvidia is going to
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: be doing. If you have one-to-one exposure, that was his only goal. Basically, I'll give you
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: infinite money. I just want exposure to public companies through your startups.
[00:21:24] I love that. Before we move on, I do just want to talk.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_02: How do you need it? It's an interesting question.
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_00: Rory, you said the word thrash a couple of minutes ago. Before we move on from this kind of
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_02: court debate on the core incumbents, Sam Altman did a memo internally within OpenAI and he said
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: we were in war mode against Google regarding their increasing capabilities and the increasing
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_02: competition in the space. Does this incitement of war mode ever work? How did we feel about Sam
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_02: catalyzing the troops into this proactive state? I've never seen it work. Folks of doing this,
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_00: all the leading public companies say, we've got to work harder when we're in war mode. It's AI,
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_00: and listen, I just have always wondered who are they talking to?
[00:22:13] Who are they talking to? There must be a handful of folks that it works on, but
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_00: who really cares enough to go into war mode? They're already working as hard as they want to be.
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_00: I've just wondered, it's not to Wall Street is the message. I don't think.
[00:22:31] Is it to let VPs know they're going to get fired? It's just something that CEOs want to say.
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_00: They want to tell folks it's time. We've got to step up. I've almost never seen anybody react
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_00: to that. War mode as a metaphor for rallying the troops. I don't know if it works or not. I
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_01: always find it a little odd. Have you been in peace mode until now? Did you just suddenly discover
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_01: there was a war? It's also such a weird question. I also for what it's worth. Don't love the metaphor.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_01: Let's be honest, we're a bunch of pampered, west coast, elite,
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_01: app computer people. If you want to war, the US Marines will still take an applicant and you
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_01: can have a real war. Otherwise save the metaphor for someone who cares. So not a fan of the war
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_01: mode thing. Whether it works or not, in my view, is independent of the metaphor. Maybe the better
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_01: question is to Jason's point is forget the metaphor, forget the war, forget the work harder
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_01: because you all work hard. What exactly are you going to do today that you weren't doing yesterday?
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_01: That would be an interesting question. I will say across every professional experience of
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_00: Ed from start up to scale up to VP at a Fortune 500 tech company, nothing happens when you're not
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_00: in hyper aggressive mode. Nothing happens. You think it does and you get releases out, but it's
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_00: only when you find a way to get that you can call it war mode, but nothing happens when you're
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_00: not in hyper aggressive mode. It seems like it happens, but just keeping up with the release,
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_00: with the TPU schedule, with the bug fixes, with the patches. I mean, if you've ever worked in a
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_00: tech company, especially a software company, just fixing the bugs could take all year.
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_00: Like, we can't do it, Rory. I know you want to launch that feature, but we have 12 years of
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_00: technical debt. What about the OAuth doesn't work? You get endless excuses from the team, okay?
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_00: Because it's true. Because you have decades of technical debt and 100 features and you just
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_00: promised a big customer you'd have this feature that still doesn't come out. And now NUMNUT's
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_00: Lemkin or Steppings wants us to do even more. So you can't get anything done in
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_00: let your hyper aggressive mode, like mobile for Facebook. I just don't know if telling the troops
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_00: works. I've never seen it work, but you do got to go into hyper aggressive mode because
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_00: I think what he's saying is if we evolve at our current pace, we're going to fall behind. It's
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_00: just that simple. That's what he's saying. We're going to fall behind. I really think when you look
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_00: at when I meet with startups, especially when you when you invest later because your money's already
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_00: in, right? When they're not in hyper aggressive mode, I don't want to say I lose confidence in
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_00: case anyone's watching, but I lose confidence because you're just not going to get anywhere. I need
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_00: to see, especially today, when folks are falling behind an AI, right? When you have companies at scale
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_00: falling behind, I don't care about your talk. I don't want to hear about your pilot. I want to
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_00: smell that your team is in hyper aggressive mode. If it is, I think you can come back. What if I
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_00: don't smell it? If you have no chance? What are signs or smells that suggest hyper aggressive T?
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_02: Founders will be listening to this. The management team, there's a tension in the management team
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_00: to move faster. Every single person in the management team says, we are shipping product faster.
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_00: I am selling harder. I'm getting on the road more. I am generating more leads. Every single person
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_00: on your management team is sweating it and they're executing faster. You can just see they come to
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_00: your board meeting, they come to whatever and there is velocity in every area. We just don't,
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_00: how many oftentimes do you truly see velocity increase in a board meeting? Not that common, right?
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_00: That's hyper aggressive mode. Everyone is on line on this somehow. This is makes a great CEO.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_00: This is very hard for a CEO to do. Everything is anti-inertia. Everything slows down even in an
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_00: early stage startup, right? Then when you come in and everyone's sweating and they're like, you know,
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_00: we ship twice the story points twice the software is last quarter and we're still falling behind
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_00: and I'm pissed. But these days in the area of great job, I just don't see it enough and that's
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_00: what you need. You need to make your team hyper aggressive. It is an unnatural state. If I push
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_00: you, if I push you both, who will win the consumer? Is it open AI and the app roll out that they
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_02: are clearly going to do over the next few years or will Google retain the consumer, the search layer
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_02: and the app layer that they have today? I'm going to maybe be be tripe. But I think Sergey brought
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_00: back high progress in this to Google. He's clear in the interviews. He, he, you know, he just
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_00: did. He said, I came in. We weren't even allowed to use our own tools. We're not used our own
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_00: coding tools. We're not allowed to use our own chips. He's like, I got rid of that in a week. I
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_00: heard arguments. I got rid of it in a week. That's what you need. Sergey had to come as great as
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_00: the leadership is. I think Sergey had to come back and make it hyper aggressive. I don't think he
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: was the only point, but, but you need that. You need that. And I just, most of the startups that I
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_00: see that aren't found or run are unable to get back to hyper aggressive mode. They're just, it is
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: impossible for them. I'm not saying it hasn't happened with Sasha and, and, but look at our,
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_00: how many folks in your portfolio without a founder can switch into hyper aggressive? No,
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_00: so you're saying Google over, I have to, this is a 20v7. Yeah, but this is a, will Google retain
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_02: the consumer? Yes. The app suite that they have will open a, I continue to eat more and more
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_02: and more of Google's core business. And we will see a much more shared lens. Well, listen,
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_02: I think the same thing most people on X2, I think the Google products are great. I use it every day.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_00: I use, in fact, I don't even care whether I use AI overviews or chat, eb, or a
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_00: topic, but I'm, I actually prefer AI overviews because I don't have to leave Google. That,
[00:27:47] that's a great product. I mean, I mean, we're, uh, so is Gemini 3 pro. These are great products.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_00: There's no, we, you're not giving me any reason to leave. They're great. They're truly great software.
[00:28:00] I want, I'll answer this question. I actually do want to come back to the leadership thing because I
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_01: want to chat a little bit about that and maybe learn something. But going back to the first question,
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_01: the Google question, if you listen to the Overwatch stuff a while ago, you know, Google, you know,
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_01: six, nine months ago, it's like, oh my god, Google's dead. I was all over what,
[00:28:20] obviously, execute really well in cloud in the model. And fundamentally, the core search
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_01: business has not declined nearly as much. There was an interview, an interview, I think,
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_01: I can't remember the woman's name. The head of search in Wall Street Journal and she'd
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_01: talked about how search, yes, some things like that. But search volume is going up as people
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_01: ask more questions. So it was, it's clear that the decline of search isn't going to be precipitous.
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_01: That's my clear takeaway from that. Exactly. I got that one wrong. And they're going to be able to
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_01: get some such. At the same time, I do believe there has emerged a new and separate consumer category
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_01: of, you know, paid subscription for advanced AI. And I think JGPD is a good position at place.
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_01: I mean, they have 800 million users, 5% of them are paying. I don't see all those users
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_01: quote unquote going back to Google. I think they've carved their niche,
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_01: big niche in the attention economy. And, you know, I don't see it as an either R,
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_01: even if the search business slows down. I think Google, I think Chachi P can charge,
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_01: can build a defensible large, enormously large consumer business to minor extent at the extent of
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_01: Google. And to a more macro extent than the, you know, a few dollars from everyone, right?
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I do think the advertising dollars, you know, we're getting close to the point where the
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_01: digital advertising spend across Google, Facebook and Amazon, even before Chachi PD exists, is
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_01: getting a very, is becoming a super high percentage of the total ad spend. So if Chachi PD is
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_01: going to get their share of that, either we're going to have to grow the pie overall,
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_01: or, you know, someone's going to have to lose a little bit. So it's that net. I don't think it's
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_01: an either R. I think Google's proven, you know, reports of that are greatly exaggerated. But I don't
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_01: think it just, I mean, I saw in the memo, I leaked in the memo that Altman made a reference to
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_01: growth falling to 5% in a year or two. And obviously, the therapist called that catastrophizing.
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_01: When you postulate something that's so awful, like this kind of is going, you know,
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_01: not of 500% year on year. If it went to 5% year on year, that would be the single most catastrophic
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_01: growth decline in history. So, but in terms of likely outcomes, independent of the human dynamic,
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_01: the likely outcome for me is Chachi PD continues to build this compelling consumer product,
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_01: can command, differentiated market while at the same time Google search does not quote, unquote
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_01: go to zero. The pie expands, you know, the great American tech, tech mag seven suck more of the
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_01: world's profit dollars out of the rest of humanity. Go team. Okay, we'll speaking of expanding pies.
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_02: Drone out of the room. I don't know, but that's it pie.
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_02: Speaking of expanding. I did, I want to go back. I did like, I mean, I did, the leadership
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_01: I didn't say I for me, because I'm not a good rarer type leader. I might was interested in Jason's
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_01: come and I'm reflecting on it because I tend to be more the step back person, which I think is why
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_01: I'd be a mediocre CEO and I'm okay as an investor. It was a great question. What are the signs you
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_01: know as an investor? When do I look at my companies and go, God, this guy's running hot, right? And
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_01: I've been thinking about it. It's a super question. And it's generally when at least once or twice a
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_01: year, I think to myself, I, Mr CEO and I have one or two in mind, I push in your team too hard.
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_01: Even I don't love the war metaphor mode. You are correct. It's only the wily intense ones,
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_01: the wily driven ones that really have excellence. And I'm reflecting on my very best excellent
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_01: companies. And everyone's no other CEO would just lose his shit. And he, because he or she would be
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_01: just so exasperated by the lack of progress and the drive they felt to win, that you'd have
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_01: that tension. And the bigger the team, the more people you have, the more simply you have to
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: communicate. And therefore you probably use simpler metaphors. And therefore you probably have to
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_01: go for some kind of it's a war we got to win. Because that's what it takes to motivate 5,000
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: people and point them in the one direction. Well, I don't know if it's the five thinking on it.
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_00: I actually don't think you said you sometimes advise your CEOs to go easier on your team.
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_00: I don't think you have to go easier on anyone great ever. Everyone great, every great leader,
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_00: every great VP executive is going just and they're rare. They're rare. They're going just as hard
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_00: or in some ways harder than the CEO. The CEO's job is harder. A lot of executives don't get how hard
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_00: it is to be at the top. But in their own domain, right? CTO, CRO, they are going harder than the CEO.
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_00: And so if this was 2021 at people everyone would say I'm being toxic, same as this. It's not.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_00: Okay, we're going to 2026. I do not think you can push your team too hard. I think you should push
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_00: them as hard as the business needs to go. And if they leave, it's great. It's terrific because
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_00: they're not going to get you there. And maybe that's what Sam's doing. He's saying to us, there is
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_00: complacency is set in. People, everyone's getting to sell 20 million at a time. Turnover is high.
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_00: And it worked for a while. And now the competition is up. And I maybe he's talking to 20 people. And he's
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_00: saying I need you guys to go even harder. And maybe half will leave and half will do it. I think
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_00: that may be the whole message. But I honestly think the founders, my number one abit of advice
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_00: is do not go easy on your team. Love them. Back them up. Don't pick at them. Don't back where
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_00: they're good. Let them run where they're good. But push them even harder. The best ones will always
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_00: step. They might cry or lose it for a couple days, but they will step up. Generally in your best
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_01: companies, you're exactly right. Some people crash out because they just can't take it. And my
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_01: point is, how do you know the motor was running at full speed? The answer is you're here in occasional
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_01: gear grind. And your job as a board member was to check in on the gear grind and go, oh, okay,
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_01: I can live with that gear grind. It's okay. Right. They're doing the right thing. Let them all go for
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_00: 2026. Let them go. Yeah. Because they're not going to get you anywhere. They're not going to get
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_00: you anywhere. The folks that it's too hard. They the jobs too hard, right? Yeah. I think you've got
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_01: to keep the fast people on the fastest growing portfolio company now. The last portman in the
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_00: CRO set stood up and said, I want to do more than the stretch plan next year. Calmly, not
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_00: in a friend. I want to do more than that. And here's and gave a data driven reason why. No one
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_00: asked him to do it. You want that out of your team in the age of AI or you're just going to fail.
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_00: You can push to the point of delusional. You can push to just one level just below that. But I
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_01: actually think that's the technique to just really drive the team to the point where they just
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_01: just out realistic and then just take it down one notch because it's look. It doesn't work if you
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_01: lose your entire team and actually it could segue off to the disc you made this discussion on the
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_01: war thing. As you point out in the last two years since the chat GPT since the open AI board change,
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_01: you have lost an entire team at open AI. And you know, you know, you isn't it? Well, not all of them.
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_00: You kept Greg. Yeah, you don't want to lose your entire team. So the question is how hard can you
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_01: push while not blowing the whole thing up? Anyway, you rather not creating an anthropic when your team
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_00: leaves to let alone thinking machines and all that. You don't want to force two of your best
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_00: people out and they build your top competitor. We thought about Warmo. There is no category more
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_02: competitive today. It would seem than the customer service customer support market Sierra,
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_02: Bratt Taylor, formerly, close year of Salesforce started Sierra reached a hundred million
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_02: error within two years. It announced over the last week. The last round was at $10 billion. It
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_02: raised 350 by green ocean September. It's a hundred X error as of today. How did we analyze
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_02: this very fast scaling to a hundred in error? Does it justify the price paid? And does it show that
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_02: customer support is going to be so much of a bigger market than any of us previously thought?
[00:36:06] Well, I'll tell you what I can tell you from this from the street having having a lot of investment
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_00: in this space. It's not a criticism of Sierra or Decacon or others, but the whole category,
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_00: the enterprise side of it, is massively overselling what they can deliver today. Now,
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_00: so did Repplet and Loveable at the start of this year. The reputable Microsoft, everyone said,
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_00: give us one mine and we will build your Salesforce, okay? That is much closer to truth today than it was
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_00: in the early year, bordered on fraud. Now it's becoming reality. So many folks, I know have bought
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_00: next generation AI support tools and have not deployed them at all or barely deployed them or
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_00: there's no AI working. And so it's not that it can't happen. Like it will, I believe in it. And
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_00: there's few categories AI can disrupt more than support, but I will tell you if you dig deeper,
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_00: you'll find a lot of deployments haven't even happened or half there are untrained or broken.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_00: So it's a lot of getting CIOs and others excited. It's a lot and this is as oversold today as
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: vibe coding was earlier this year, but I'm not saying it won't catch up. I'm not being cynical. I've
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_00: just managed to oversold. It is clear that yeah, support alongside coding is one of the two
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: largest and most obvious markets for LLM. So this is kind of, this is big, huge category that can
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_01: totally work. So you start with that. Red Taylor is obviously widely talented and Sierra has a
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_01: great name, especially at the high end. I actually think the category is working and you know,
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_01: I literally did a reference call with someone and they said, look, we evaluated Sierra, we evaluated
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_01: all these other names. And you know, before LLM's and I had an investment in a company that was
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_01: pre LLM customer support, our resolution rate was around 23%. You know, as we could solve 23%
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_01: of calls, maybe up to 30, with LLM's, with these new modern things, you can solve 60%, which means
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_01: on a number of call bases, you can significantly reduce your customer support. So I think there is
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_01: some meaning for value there. I'm sure at times it's overstated, but if this isn't a market for
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_01: LLM's in the enterprise, then nothing is. Right. So let's leave that to one side. The real question,
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_01: I think is, you know, how does the math work from here? Like it's, you know, it's 100 million
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_01: and it's trading at 10 billion. And what would it take? And I just kind of laid it out in my head.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_01: It's like, you went from 10 million to 100 million in the last year. So you 10x. So say you 5x next
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_01: year, that's 500, 3x a year after one and a half billion, 2x a year after 3 billion, you know,
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_01: go to 3 billion a year and slow down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then you go four and a half
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_01: billion and then five. So over the next five years, right? You've got a 10x, 5x, 3x, 2x, 50% growth
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_01: and then slow down a little to 20% growth. And you're at 5 billion in five years for context.
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_01: Service cloud today, which is the largest cloud within Salesforce is 8 billion. So you know, you're
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_01: getting 5 billion out of that marketplace. At that point, you know, if you're valued at the
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_01: Salesforce multiple of five or six times, you know, you work 25 billion. So it's a 2.5x. What it
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_01: highlights is the amount of growth you have to underwrite to make the math work. Right. So then you
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: zoom out of level as something we said last week that I believe when you're dealing with hyper growth
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_01: markets, it's all about the time. And if you the crude math I just did, which is if this company goes
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_01: faster than any other enterprise software companies in five years, it's doing 5 billion dollars,
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_01: which passes the sanity test of service cloud doing eight today. Right. What that says to me is
[00:39:38] SPEAKER_01: if all you are is a next generation software play, you're probably not going to get that growth
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_01: because that would have to come dollar for dollar from service cloud. It goes back to what Jason
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_01: says. The only way this math works is if you eat a huge slug of the labor and because you eat the
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_01: labor instead of the, you know, 20 billion dollar software market for services, you eat the 200
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_01: billion dollar a year services market for customer support agents. It's got to go from 100 million
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_00: error to a billion to justify the valuation on its face, right. It's got to go 100 to a billion a
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_00: year. Will will that happen? Can you even deploy in the enterprise at that pace, right, versus
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_00: self-serve? We'll see, right. But we'll see if they go from 100 now to a billion at the end of
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_00: the next year. Should we, we can make a calcium has any company down 100 million to a billion.
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_02: By the yes, on topic, easy. Yeah. Caster and on throwing. What? Caster will be one. How much,
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_02: but how much of that revenue is self-serve to there's a certain amount of human capital you want to
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_00: need to deliver this amount of revenue in the enterprise, right? Because let me tell you,
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_00: if Brett Taylor walks into a Fortune 500 company and says, give me 10 million dollars and I can
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_00: replace half your support team. Trust me. He will not leave that he will leave the building with a 10
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_00: million dollar contract. Mark Benioff was great at this too. He would go in back in the day when
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_00: when enterprise asked was booming, he would go to big company, you would say, what's your number one
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_00: problem, Harry? And Harry would say, well, I can't get this website in this e-commerce and Mark would
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_00: say, just give me 10 million dollars. And I will get this for you. That was the price. And he was
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_00: magical at it. And Brett's going to be even better, even though Mark's the best there ever is,
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_00: because he was the CTO Facebook and the CoC of Salesforce. He's got, there's no one got a better
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_00: package than Brett. So he can get 10 million dollar checks, but can he get 100 next year and deliver
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_00: training and FDEs? It'll just be interesting to watch, right? It's a lot to deliver. I think Jason,
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_00: you're exactly right. Going for 100 to a billion on API business is very different than going from
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_01: 100 million to a billion in a business where each 10 million dollar contract is a huge amount
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_01: of change management in a large corporation in America. And I think the physics of diffusing
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_01: this technology in a DNA enterprise will be the rate limit on how fast this company can grow.
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_01: It won't be raw demand. It won't be the talent of the CEO. It won't be the product. It will
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_01: literally be, can you really roll out, you know, what is it? 110 million dollar customers are,
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_01: you know, a thousand one million dollar customers in a year where each one of them has their own
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_01: special sauce, their own dynamics, their own integrations. I think there's a physics to how fast you
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_01: can grow in enterprise software, even with huge demand when that's the amount of change management
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_01: has to happen. So I think that would be the rate limiter here, right? Nothing else.
[00:42:22] I haven't sold to the enterprise. They might not realize how true. I mean, literally, I think if
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_00: Brett Taylor could sell 10 million to anybody. Great. It's not just that he's so smart or charismatic.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_00: It's that literally enterprises are complex to change. They're looking for the best person
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_00: in the world that can solve their problems. Like what's my big problem? And if you can dramatically
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_00: increase the KPIs and support for me and Brett is the guy, I will give you the 10 million bucks.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_00: It's not for you and me to be hard to get 10 million dollar. You and I might have to start with
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_00: a 10 K contract or 100 K, but literally I'm not being facetious. Brett can get multiple 10 million
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_00: dollar checks. So as goofy as the sounds is I know the sounds goofy and this is with total respect.
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_00: The 100 million almost to me isn't impressive. It's not impressive because I think he can
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_00: will it out of the ether with this background. A billion next year with a thousand FDs, somehow he's
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_00: got to go higher and deploy that that to me. It was magic like that will be magic because they will
[00:43:16] SPEAKER_00: give him a hundred million dollars. He might even be able to walk into one of the biggest fortune
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_00: 50 companies and get a hundred million contract from one like Palantir. They would give it to Brett.
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_00: If he promised the moon, they would give him a hundred million bucks. I think the zoom out comment
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_01: you write about and it's something you kind of learn is to see a lot of enterprise software over time
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_01: is this big companies and big leaders have big problems and there's only a small number of people
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: that can take their problems to and if you look at large technology companies over the last 40 or
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_01: 50 years, the ones that become dominant in an enterprise waves are the ones who have one way or
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_01: the other project to the CEOs and CIOs of the largest companies in America. If you have a problem
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_01: in the sector, we will make it go away like Cisco. They started off with routers, but over the next 10
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_01: or 15 years, they bought pretty much anything you needed for the network and I think when you
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_01: know, Chambers was running his thing. The big picture value proposition was, hey Mr. CIO,
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_01: if you have any networking problems, we'll just buy whatever we need and make it go away. Therefore,
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_01: you can safely give me 50 or a hundred million bucks. IBM back in the day, same thing and you're
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_01: right Jason, I think someone as talented as Brett Taylor in the new world of AI can do what I think
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_01: C3 tried to do and failed. Palantir is doing, which is walk into a CEO and say dude, you told your
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_01: board that a top two initiative for 2026 is Nick XYZ Corporation AI enabled and I can help you
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_01: with that. Give me a 20 million dollar check. I absolutely agree. I think that is a thing and it's
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_01: frustrating because all the little companies who are run by ordinary folks can't do that, but that's
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_01: the magic of being a successful proven enterprise leader for 20 years. So I agree, I think you can
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_01: access that kind of business and it's a very powerful positioning. I think it's all about the
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: physics. To me, the assumption you have to make as an investor with this goes back to the very
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_02: wise statement that you said Rory, many shows go, which I think do literally every single day,
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_02: which is the bet within AI is will we see the transition from human labor to softwares band?
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_02: And if we see that and we see cost, cool centers go and all of the cool center costs go,
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_02: then it will go to these players and then we have 100 billion dollars the error. The question
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_01: is, as is always the case when something is obviously true, valuation expands to recreate risk.
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_01: In other words, there's a point at which you do any of these deals all day every day, right?
[00:45:39] SPEAKER_01: The real question is, at 100 times one way revenues, can you make the math work? And that I think
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_01: is a lot harder. Are you ready for an uncomfortable question for Rory? And he can throw it back on me
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_02: when we move to lovable. Okay. You mentioned intercom there, intercom doing say 300, 400 million in
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_02: revenue at two and a half, you don't need to comment on these numbers, but two and a half billion,
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_02: three billion in price versus Sierra doing a hundred million at a 10 billion dollar price.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_02: But the gross rates are wildly different. How do you think about which one you'd rather be?
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_02: I think board can make a ton of money. And I think I'm very happy with my bet and I'd come
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_01: with a company. I think they've done an amazing job in a way that's very few SaaS companies have
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_01: of transitioning to an AI first world. And the growth rate of their AI product is frankly comparable
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_01: to Sierra's without kind of revealing details that the company should choose to reveal.
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_01: So I'm not sitting here. In fact, I feel frankly broadly speaking pretty smart. I think got some
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_01: very nice AI growth rate alongside an existing SaaS business at a very attractive price. So I feel
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_01: pretty damn good here. Thank you. And I think, but I think the meta point is all these companies
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_01: can do well. Multiple companies, not all that's a stupid statement, Robby. Not all of them can do well,
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_01: but there will be more than one winner as this market segment. I will say at a higher level,
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_00: not nothing against this bet, but man, today having to support an install base versus getting to
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_00: invest just an AI native customers, it's a drag. It is a drag. It is a drag. And I was literally
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_00: with the portfolio company. It's got 45 million of AI revenue growing, about 100%. Okay, now listen,
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_00: that's not a level or but it's pretty good. Okay. And then it's got 50 million of pre-AI revenue
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_00: growing zero. Okay. So what do you and the problem is they are and I think this is probably true at
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_00: Fin and Intercom. They are an exorably linked, but they're not the same product. It's it kind of
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_00: sucks. We may change our mind in a year and say, my God, that install base was the greatest thing
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_00: ever to leverage for AI, but right now, man, it feels like a drag to have to have a couple thousand
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_00: pre-AI customers to make happy. It feels like a drag. We're recording my profound opposition to that.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_01: I disagree. And I'll tell you why. I actually think every incumbent in these markets has one huge
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_01: advantage and one huge disadvantage. And I'm going to say it clearly. I think the advantage is
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_01: the customer base and the data structures and the access to the data on your existing,
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_01: what the company is doing because I think for something like sales, our customer support,
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_01: the truth is it's going to be a combo package for a long time to come, some automation and then
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_01: some human agents and being able to move seamlessly between them both has huge advantages.
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_01: Right. I think the disadvantage that every large existing incumbent has is they can't get out
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_01: of their own frickin way. Right. And therefore, they can't leverage the asset they have while at the
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_01: same time in bracelet AI technology. And I think that frankly something that Intercom did really
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_01: well. But it's really all that. And I think you're your point. In theory, it's an asset, right.
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_00: In theory, it's great to have an install base, all of its data, rather than an new AI company,
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_00: hoping to have that data, all that in theory. The problem isn't that. That isn't asset. And that's
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_00: why I might change my mind in 12 months. The problem is all the technical debt, all the feature debt,
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_00: all the features you've promised those thousand customers, those 5,000 cultures that don't give a
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_00: rat's ass about your shiny new AI feature. The fact you have to keep them happy, okay. And not
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_00: let them deteriorate. That can consume the majority of your engineering development time. It really
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_00: can. I'd love to hear Oh, he's very, I'd like to hear his honest thoughts. I suspect what they did
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_00: in Intercom. You would know better than me. I suspect they did what you have to do, which is you,
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_00: you they don't get so much. The old customers, because there's only so many engineers, 100, 500,
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_00: and a thousand 50. If you, your existing customers can consume all of your story points and all of
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_00: your engineering time, all of it. You have 10 years of debt. And if you're a new AI company,
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_00: you don't have the data. It's a huge negative. Don't get me wrong. But the ability to run,
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_00: that's when we talk, when VCs talk about endlessly about how native AI customers are better,
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_00: I want to gag with the spoon. But I think they're sometimes they're better because they're four
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_00: really smart people. Sometimes they're just better because they don't have a thousand complaining
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_00: customers to support. I'm just saying right now, I feel like it's a liability. But in a year,
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_00: I may think it's the greatest thing, like looking at agent force right now. It's early, right? But we
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_00: sales source could be the next Google. It could be in 18 to 24 months. We could be like, oh my god,
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_00: agent force crushed it. We all these startups. We didn't need them because agent force is so good.
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_00: I know it sounds crazy, right? I may change my mind. But right now, the startups I invested in with
[00:50:21] SPEAKER_00: large install bases, I feel like it's a friggin cement shoes. But again, I would disagree. I think
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_01: that the great advantage, like you made a comment on you have a comment there's a 45 million dollars
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_01: of AI revenue and then a whole bunch of customers who don't care about the AI revenue at all. And
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_01: that was the revealing sentence. I think I don't think that's the experience you're seeing in some of
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_01: these cases where when you have an obvious, anyone who is running a customer support organization
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_01: knows they're going to be embracing AI, right? And a successful company goes in and says, we're
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_01: going to help you on that journey. It's unimaginable to me to think of a customer support
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_01: executive who's running their business and saying, no, I'm not going to do any say I stuff. I just
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_01: really like paying people in the Philippines down the phones. But the debt is real, right? And how
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_00: much you can do for them is real. I mean, I did an interview for G2 with the CEO of Zendesk and
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_00: every customer has AI is and I'm not an expert in Zendesk, but he was very direct because they're
[00:51:13] SPEAKER_00: private now is right. But the base version of Zendesk, which you get with AI, it's about 20%
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_00: automated. That's about as well as you can do without training, okay? And to get this thin level
[00:51:23] SPEAKER_00: of experience or better or decagon or Sierra, you got to train the thing for a month or three weeks
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_00: with FDs and the rest. And so it's not that they both don't benefit. It's just, I think it's an
[00:51:35] SPEAKER_00: asset and a hindrance. I think if we look at some of our fastest growing companies, they don't have
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_00: they don't have cement shoes. I'm not saying there comes the exception of the robot, they just
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_00: don't have cement shoes, right? I agree. I think it takes frankly, I think really excellent
[00:51:49] SPEAKER_01: management and a certain going back to the, oh God, I can't believe it. Going back to the war mode
[00:51:53] SPEAKER_01: comment, which again, I didn't love what I'm changing my mind. I think a lot of lead product
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_01: leadership and clarity of vision to make it happen, you know, I don't I think you're seeing in
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: Benny off trying to figure out how to do that. But it's the bigger the organization, the harder it
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_01: is. I think the team and then it comes done a really nice job of doing that, right? It's hard.
[00:52:10] Well, let me put it differently. Intercom did it. Let's stipulate. Oh, and did it. And it's great.
[00:52:13] SPEAKER_00: This is why I think most of our unicorns will fail because you've got to be as good or better
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_00: than Owen to make this transition. Most of them are going to fail. When I look at some of
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_00: these B2B unicorns, they just, it's so hard to do both. It's so hard. I've got 200 million
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_00: ARR Rory. I'm growing 20%. I know I have to do AI, but I just, I can barely get the team to do what
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_00: I'm doing unless you have this aggressiveness war mode great CEO. There's just no way you can do
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_00: both. There's no your typical PE company can barely get a release out of your. I agree. I think
[00:52:46] there's two things that stop you. And I think as is usual when you and I talk Jason, you emphasize
[00:52:50] SPEAKER_01: one and I emphasize the other, which is okay. Right? There are the two challenges you typically have
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_01: is one I call it the management challenge, which is what you emphasize. Oh, you got all this
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_01: old stuff you got to do this news. It's hard to do. It's hard to do both. So you just got to be
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_01: good manager. But then the second thing I would argue the predecessor thing is there's got to be
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_01: some obvious linkage between the two. But if you've got this SaaS company in the old world that does
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_01: X and there's no obvious X plus AI equivalent, you're just on an island and then deciding, oh, I'm
[00:53:18] SPEAKER_01: going to do something new in SaaS. It's screwed. You're screwed. Right? If all you have is I have
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_01: customers who might want to buy SaaS in the future, AI in the future, they buy SaaS today, you're
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_01: screwed. The only time you have even a chance to do it is when both kind of organically go together.
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_01: I'll give you another example of that. I think Gong is a very interesting company that was, you know,
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_01: pre GPT AI, right, call recording. And I think they're doing a decent job of navigating that terrain
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_01: and adding all the LLM stuff on top. But it's not because they're management geniuses. Maybe they are.
[00:53:49] SPEAKER_01: It's more fundamentally because there was an obvious path from here to there. Right? In some other
[00:53:55] SPEAKER_01: areas where the SaaS thing doesn't have an AI equivalent, you're on an island and then you're
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_01: right. There's nothing you can do. You could be God's gift, the management and you're screwed. Right?
[00:54:05] SPEAKER_01: And you know, I'm trying to think of examples of that without trying anyone under the bus.
[00:54:09] SPEAKER_01: But there are deals where you look and you just go, hmm, I'm not sure we need you in this AI
[00:54:13] SPEAKER_01: first world, baby. And that's not good. You said the fastest growing companies and how it's
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_02: tied to kind of AI native customers. One that's really tied to this, like the AIR hit revenue milestone
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_02: does it justify price. Lovable hit for 200 million in AIR or two acts what it was in just four months.
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_02: Rumor 6.3 billion dollar around in terms of new price valuation being 6.3 billion dollars.
[00:54:38] SPEAKER_02: Is that justified when you see the growth rate hitting 200 million in AIR are fall lovable?
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_02: I don't know, but I will tell you for folks that are critics, I don't have the numbers, right?
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_00: I can tell you this is like an old saster lesson. I really think we have to do in the age of AI.
[00:54:52] SPEAKER_00: You've got to segment your customer base. So what I mean is I assume at the low end the
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_00: churn approaches 50% or higher. Okay. The one then low just did in music. What's it called? We use it.
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_00: Soon, right? They just said they have they only retain 20% of their customers in the earth level.
[00:55:10] SPEAKER_00: But I just did a presentation of Repplet to show it all my apps at all hands. And when I was there,
[00:55:14] SPEAKER_00: they closed a pretty large seven figure deal when I was there. Okay. So my the point is there's no
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_00: way that's going to churn as a multi year seven figure deal. Anything less than a couple years
[00:55:26] SPEAKER_00: mathematically is it? So like you've got to what I would almost want to do is take lovable and
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_00: Repplet and segment them and say listen, there's a high end here that's probably got 140 to 160%
[00:55:36] SPEAKER_00: or I'm pretty confident of it. There's a classic mid pack that my guess is with upsells and stuff is
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_00: approaching 100% retention. And then there's a part of the bottom is worse than we're used to.
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_00: It may have 40% retention or 30%. But that's not unprecedented. Like almost every mobile subscription app
[00:55:53] SPEAKER_00: has like we know from ever to cat is like 20 or 30% retention. So I just think I would almost want to
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_00: put a not only set bar chart mine, but almost draw black line through the bottom. If I or and just
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_00: call that marketing spent like that bottom is just marketers. They're just folks to get the word out.
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_00: They and they're all over social media. And I'm betting in the next two, right? The 100% and the
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_00: 160% in our and even if that's half of lovable's it's it's I think it's a decent bet, right? And I
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_00: also that's why I also think as these guys grow their NRR will go up and the churn will go down
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_00: just because for classic enterprise reasons those big customers are going to be stickier.
[00:56:28] They're just going to be stickier. I'm just always thinking about the opportunity cost of cash and
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_02: where I put my money to make the most money to Roy's brilliant to Roy's shut up to Roy's brilliant
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_02: point on Harry. That's great. But what about me? It's now worth more than wicks. Two billion in
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_02: error admittedly the growth rate for which is 14% year on year. But they have base 44 which is
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_02: growing very, very fast to just announce that 50 million in error. So you have to believe that
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_02: either wicks is very undervalued or lovable is very overvalued. It's a tough one. You know what the
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_00: tough part is for all public companies? It shows you're not getting credit for checking the AI box.
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_00: Hurray to wicks you went from nothing to 50 million in vibe coding. If you were if that means
[00:57:10] SPEAKER_00: you're this percent of wicks or I mean a replica level you should be worth a couple extra billion.
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_00: The market saying no it's not enough. You're as a public company you're being judged the public
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_00: company. You're not being judges Sierra. It's tough because every public company is out there hustling
[00:57:23] SPEAKER_00: their AI story. And if you look at I'm not sure it's working at all. I think it's necessary but not
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_00: sufficient to get what you need to be paleteer. That's what the public market's want and they're
[00:57:33] SPEAKER_00: saying wicks ain't paleteer. It's not a 50 million. It's not enough. Show me 500 million.
[00:57:38] But I would I would caveat that all you can conclude is right now the public markets
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_01: aren't giving it full credit which is different than saying the strategy is right or wrong. I mean
[00:57:49] SPEAKER_01: as we just discussed everyone's dumping on Google nine months ago and now the stock's up two point
[00:57:54] SPEAKER_01: something X right is that yeah markets are fickle things they you know change their mind. I mean
[00:57:59] SPEAKER_01: the question is is it the right strategy for wicks? Do you have to add some kind if you're in the
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_01: website buildings business which is what they have been it seems almost inevitable you have to add
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_01: this otherwise you're not relevant agree that's kind of step one and then the question is so
[00:58:16] SPEAKER_01: directly they're doing the right thing let's start with that right and then you can measure
[00:58:20] SPEAKER_01: how well they're doing it in terms of adoption what percentage of the customers are using this
[00:58:24] SPEAKER_01: product isn't out on the side and just the game or is it a core part of their product you know
[00:58:28] SPEAKER_01: measuring kind of with industrial logic not financial logic how well they're doing and then you
[00:58:33] SPEAKER_01: can start saying how do you compare that bet to the lovable bet right and that's the way you have
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_01: to do it it's it's a two billion dollar business versus two and a million dollar business it's
[00:58:42] SPEAKER_01: probably got better churn retention but only a small percentage of his AI and then on the other
[00:58:47] SPEAKER_01: hand you have lovable it's all AI but you have massive churn you know it could well be that the
[00:58:52] SPEAKER_01: public markets are undervaluing one of the private markets are both valuing the other right in the end
[00:58:57] SPEAKER_01: it'll throw up based on in the short term you know it's the old cliche in the short term markets are
[00:59:03] SPEAKER_01: avoiding machine and in the long term they're a weighing machine if wicks pulls off their strategy
[00:59:09] SPEAKER_01: they'll get valued for it in the end did all lovable if they don't it if you know it's the
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_01: Jason comment if they don't if you can overcome the inertia if you just tick the AI box but don't
[00:59:19] SPEAKER_01: actually make it court or what you're doing then you write fast forward five years and it'll be
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_01: lovable as the king of website generation and who was wicks they didn't make it through the
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: the turn but but I think not in the end have me into remarks I just into remarks it's just a reminder
[00:59:35] SPEAKER_00: to founders and everybody two two billion AR are growing 14% as we as we do this here and I the
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_00: market cap 5.24 billion for ways yeah so generally once you descend into low growth and that's
[00:59:48] SPEAKER_00: different for public companies and private companies you're worth I mean if you're worth anything
[00:59:52] SPEAKER_00: you might be worth nothing to start up you're worth in the three to five X AR range and this
[00:59:56] SPEAKER_00: isn't even that this is this is this is this is less than three and so it's a it's just it's a
[01:00:02] SPEAKER_00: top I just think man it's this you know I just got back before this I I was over at one of our
[01:00:07] SPEAKER_00: joint LPs at horse the bridge and we were talking about the pulse and I'm like man it's the best
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_00: of time and ever in startups but man go and public and type you know it's tough out there and this is
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_00: two and a half times revenue for wicks it's just I'm not saying it's worth more on a DCF basis or
[01:00:22] SPEAKER_00: whatever where he can help me there but it's brutal to be worth less than three X AR right an
[01:00:28] SPEAKER_00: SCM rush just you look oh my god it got acquired for what Adobe for one point on one point yeah that
[01:00:33] SPEAKER_00: was that was three times revenue with a 50% premium or 100% premium I think 100% premium right
[01:00:39] SPEAKER_00: doubled that's with a massive premium because of Adobe paid up it's now as a bootstrap companies
[01:00:44] SPEAKER_00: that's a fun story but brutal it's just it's a reminder to founders that are hiding or things
[01:00:50] SPEAKER_00: or they they got the 2023 message that all that matters is getting profitable like it's just a brutal
[01:00:56] SPEAKER_00: world when growth slows it's a brutal world and even if you inject AI and even if you add base 44
[01:01:01] worries right it may be a great story in 2027 right you can draw the math but it's not a magical
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_00: solution day it's brutal and it's brutal across our portfolios that have have a little bit of AI
[01:01:11] SPEAKER_00: that hasn't led to lovable growth it's brutal because what are they doing I mean wicks is doing
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_01: about two billion a year and it's 50 million of um bum bum bum uh base 44 thank you very much so
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_01: it's yeah it's two percent of revenue a two percent of revenue it's you know it's to a
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_01: rounding error discuss I mean because the odd thing is at that point you discard now the interesting
[01:01:31] SPEAKER_01: thing is if they could upsell 10 15% of their business to that whether adding two 300 million
[01:01:36] SPEAKER_01: you write JSON the multiple for companies doing 10 or 15% is pitiful the multiple for public companies
[01:01:42] SPEAKER_01: doing north of 25 is compelling right yeah it could double if they if they do 250 next year right it
[01:01:48] SPEAKER_00: could double their market cap more than you more than double your market cap they have to send
[01:01:52] SPEAKER_01: themselves can I drive 15% penetration of the AI product across my customer base and if I can make
[01:01:57] SPEAKER_01: that happen it's great you let's be clear to our public traders Harry if base 44 really can
[01:02:03] SPEAKER_00: ape lovable and replicate everyone should pile into wicks because all things being equal the
[01:02:08] SPEAKER_00: multiple should radically inflate if you can do 250 million and this is air I guess this isn't
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_00: gap but if you can do 250 million of air our next year that's massive over growing 14% of 2
[01:02:19] SPEAKER_00: billion right it's massive you should pile you should put as much of the 401k into wicks as you
[01:02:25] SPEAKER_00: can this is the great the great undiscovered public company it is unless the public markets continue
[01:02:30] SPEAKER_02: to not give you credit for it as they've not given you credit for the zero to 50 and base 44 that
[01:02:36] SPEAKER_02: no we're always making the point that you go into the interim tier okay if you look at multiples
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_00: you go from the three to four acts tier and then actually the public companies you get a really
[01:02:44] SPEAKER_00: good deal if you're in the middle tier and if you're in the top tier like Ruber Compalentere you get
[01:02:48] SPEAKER_00: the the deal that cliff from Canva wanted he wanted that deal because it's better than
[01:02:52] SPEAKER_00: pre-part but I think that middle one is still around eight to twelve XAR this middle group of like
[01:02:57] SPEAKER_00: in the 20s right so getting above 20 as a public company it's like it's easier said than done but
[01:03:04] SPEAKER_00: it's so worth it like you should buy anything you can to get yourself into the 20s anything you can
[01:03:09] SPEAKER_00: agree because I just reject the whole give you credit I mean in the short term as a get in the
[01:03:14] SPEAKER_01: short term maybe the public markets quote unquote don't give you credit but I dislike that expression
[01:03:18] SPEAKER_01: because it implies that it's some merit in the end everyone's just a set of discounted future cash
[01:03:24] SPEAKER_01: lows if you point the revenue line up and the P&L line goes up with it in the end the market will
[01:03:30] SPEAKER_01: re-rate you and give you value I just believe because that's just the way capitalism works but
[01:03:34] SPEAKER_01: sorry if you if you look at something like Palantir which is detached from rationality and detached
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_02: from a decent model then it proves you wrong no in the short term things can be wildly wrong and one
[01:03:45] SPEAKER_01: of two things will happen it will continue to it'll grow at 70% for the next 15 years and grow
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_01: into its market cap are the price will correct right no in the short term prices are often
[01:03:56] SPEAKER_01: widely wrong in capitalism but in the end it goes out you my point is this you can't chase you
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_01: can't chase the pricing you have to run your business and in the end you know the markets will catch
[01:04:09] SPEAKER_01: up with what you're doing well I think I think to go to Harry's point where I think you'd agree
[01:04:12] SPEAKER_00: I just don't think the market believes base 44 is going to accelerate with grace right they're
[01:04:17] SPEAKER_00: just waiting it because I look at going if I just pull them up in my little tier on sassarday I
[01:04:22] SPEAKER_00: if you're growing less than 20% of a of a cherry pick basket 5.1 XAR weeks is lower it's not in my
[01:04:27] SPEAKER_00: basket 20 to 30 11.8 XAR and then the 30% plus which is rubric Palantir and Figma average 23.7 XAR
[01:04:36] SPEAKER_00: but but Palantir and rubric push that up you want to go from 5X to 11.8 X but the markets are saying
[01:04:43] SPEAKER_00: we don't buy we don't we don't we don't buy it or possibly they don't care like show me the money
[01:04:48] I don't care are they just saying when we're are they're saying when you do call me and we'll give
[01:04:54] SPEAKER_01: it to you call me when I see it yeah call me next year but but again I totally agree I think markets
[01:05:00] SPEAKER_01: pay up for growth and it's why all these people who in 2022 will I just get profit all the wrong it's
[01:05:05] SPEAKER_01: a necessary but not sufficient creation necessary but not sufficient condition in the end to get
[01:05:11] SPEAKER_01: we're in the growth business and you got to be growing right so the question gets back to can they
[01:05:16] SPEAKER_01: make that happen and it's funny you mentioned Sam Rush there which for the listeners is a company that
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_01: does search engine optimization it's a bootstrap company been around the long time was public pretty
[01:05:28] SPEAKER_01: much with sleepy company and Adobe just recently bought them for you know what was about two billion
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_01: Jason right yeah 1.9 billion and my guess is and it's funny it's top of my my guess is that was
[01:05:40] SPEAKER_01: because there's this whole new emerging market now for LLM you know quick oh my gosh my brain
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_01: and so engine up my page and DEO yeah yeah exactly and you're basically optimizing your your
[01:05:55] SPEAKER_01: equivalent of your search results but on LLM's which I think is a great market and one we've
[01:05:59] SPEAKER_01: looked at and clearly Adobe said let's buy the old school player and you know maybe allow us to
[01:06:05] SPEAKER_01: parlay entry into that new market which was just super interesting I remember thinking that because
[01:06:10] SPEAKER_01: I'd been looking at that market and hadn't ultimately been able to get an investment done and I
[01:06:14] SPEAKER_01: remember thinking hmm if I was a public investor I'd look at SCM Rush I'd buy one of those geo products
[01:06:21] SPEAKER_01: and I try and do the same trick of jamming it through the channel and at you know at two times one
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_01: rate revenues it wouldn't take a lot to make a pop but lo and behold Adobe got their first and
[01:06:32] SPEAKER_01: said no we'll take that well the interesting things what they said was publicly they didn't buy it as
[01:06:37] SPEAKER_00: to jam it through the channel they bought it because it was the number one thing the customers
[01:06:41] SPEAKER_00: were asking for yes agreed and I you know when I obviously started the same thing
[01:06:45] SPEAKER_00: Adobe remember the marketing cloud is a huge amount of revenue and their typical customer is not
[01:06:50] SPEAKER_00: a 20 vc portfolio company startup it's a pretty mature CMO okay that is trusting Adobe to
[01:06:57] SPEAKER_00: execute their marketing strategy and they're worried about LLM's and GM they don't know what to do
[01:07:02] SPEAKER_00: I actually I know Harry's investment in I love Harry I actually think this is a horrible category
[01:07:06] SPEAKER_00: but but the demand at this moment it's just like a lot of things now I need an SDR I need a Geo
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_00: solution so the demand is off the chart so Adobe needed a solution today and they bought what they
[01:07:18] SPEAKER_00: could get right but I think it's a horrible category with me I am actually totally with you my
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_02: bad is this company peak is a complete founder bat and to be fair the trash is insane it's like
[01:07:31] SPEAKER_02: 15x and demand is off the chart it's mine is off the charts but what you're seeing is like the
[01:07:35] SPEAKER_02: commoditization of the pure discovery and analysis segment because there's really two segments
[01:07:40] SPEAKER_02: as discovery analysis where you rank and then there's like hey what you should do as a result how
[01:07:45] SPEAKER_02: you can improve it and then we'll do that for you and you're seeing the commoditization where
[01:07:48] SPEAKER_02: you've seen Spencer at amplitude really sad product which now is the same yeah they vibed it
[01:07:54] SPEAKER_02: and so my question to you actually worry which is we're given that I'm an investor in this
[01:07:58] SPEAKER_02: but me and Jason are agreed why do you not think we're going to see the commoditization of this
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_02: category and why do you like it I think I'll tell you why I think commoditization is with all
[01:08:09] SPEAKER_01: due respect not a useful word right I mean you know because it's an implied statement of
[01:08:16] SPEAKER_01: wrong badness of economic badness about and as I remind people you know oil is a commodity
[01:08:21] SPEAKER_01: but as the movie landmine tells as the film series landmine tells me we make three billion
[01:08:25] SPEAKER_01: a profit every damn day make an oil right so I don't think commoditization conveys something
[01:08:30] SPEAKER_01: I think what is I like that market because I think what you see in markets that really work are
[01:08:37] SPEAKER_01: a wedge product that has high urgency to spend right which means in the near term you get explosive
[01:08:44] SPEAKER_01: growth and then over the medium term there's up there's a there's a set of expansion opportunities
[01:08:51] SPEAKER_01: beyond the original point product that allows you to grow with your customers in expand and I think
[01:08:55] SPEAKER_01: that's exactly the case here discovery upfront is the core need and you know you've got a bunch
[01:09:00] SPEAKER_01: of companies like profound and evertune and all those guys doing that and then you're going to add
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_01: on over time content generation and all it takes to make sure you show up and I think this is a lot
[01:09:10] SPEAKER_01: to be built on top right I'll tell you listen for what it's worth and this is this is the whole
[01:09:16] and what sorry what your portfolio company called peak dot a I love it's an exception to the rule
[01:09:20] SPEAKER_00: I view the what what there is a category of snake oil AI of which geo is one of them okay and I'll
[01:09:27] SPEAKER_00: tell you why it's snake oil and it's going to die in 26 or 27 I'll tell you why it's snake oil
[01:09:31] SPEAKER_00: just just bear with me okay so listen saster itself we're multi we're not as big as 20 BC but we're
[01:09:36] SPEAKER_00: multi channel we have a lot going on I get about five million to our blog okay about five million
[01:09:42] SPEAKER_00: views a year from SEO okay our traffic is up 50% this year and our SEO is down 8% okay
[01:09:50] SPEAKER_00: so I've tried all the tools I don't have time I don't have a team I carry is my team is all agents
[01:09:54] SPEAKER_00: now like it's shrunk okay but I care enough about SEO that I'll try the tools right if I if
[01:09:59] SPEAKER_00: especially itself serve nothing's friggin actionable nothing's act nothing's useful useful to me now when
[01:10:06] SPEAKER_00: I was at Adobe and I would sit in these meetings and the marketers would come in and they'd be like well
[01:10:11] let me tell you how we did this year week at Adobe we had seven trillion impressions on Facebook it's
[01:10:15] SPEAKER_00: like when it was just like performative metrics I get why everyone's going to buy a G tool okay I get
[01:10:20] SPEAKER_00: why you can sell 50 million a hundred million of this because you need to walk into the meeting and
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_00: show what's going on I cannot find a single thing that is actionable put more things on Reddit doesn't
[01:10:31] SPEAKER_00: help me okay and AI tool the right content I have 10,000 pieces of content your crappy AI content
[01:10:37] SPEAKER_00: is not gonna I'm not saying and I know maybe I'm an extreme example but I literally I've tried all
[01:10:42] SPEAKER_00: the tools that let me I literally cannot find one thing that's action I'll tell you the really bad
[01:10:47] SPEAKER_00: sign with this category okay with AI if you have to put in your credit card immediately this is a
[01:10:52] SPEAKER_00: bad sign a terrible sign today if your AI is good okay and you don't need FTEs and like a massive
[01:10:59] SPEAKER_00: army let me try let me give me a few credits okay let me I what's the music one again so so no
[01:11:06] SPEAKER_00: see you see no we use it all it's asked I forgot so I went to use it again today I forgot I use it
[01:11:10] SPEAKER_00: they gave me another 50 credits and I upgraded but I did three songs for free how come I can't
[01:11:15] SPEAKER_00: Geo for free if it's so great I did a great on ever I did you go on ever
[01:11:19] SPEAKER_00: terrible sign if I can't try your AI up for free you're an era fraud you're trying to get my credit card
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_00: before you can provide any value and if you look at all the ones that are exploding half of them
[01:11:30] SPEAKER_00: not the Mercurs are half of the ones we talk about are massive PLG plays right and you can't take
[01:11:34] SPEAKER_00: the credit card in 60 seconds and grow this way you can't you got to let them do a couple lovable
[01:11:39] SPEAKER_00: prompts you gotta let me do a song you gotta let me try chat GBT free and so I think all these scams
[01:11:44] SPEAKER_00: are gonna make a lot of revenue it's like the old SDR's pre-clod for they're all terrible too
[01:11:50] SPEAKER_00: as you know they didn't work and so we're gonna see a bunch of things that are that have massive
[01:11:54] SPEAKER_00: budget and don't work and they're just gonna turn I'm gonna make it I'm gonna I'm gonna make
[01:11:59] SPEAKER_02: a bet here or I'm gonna put a $5,000 bet on that peak is gonna be his one okay five grand okay
[01:12:06] he's working I'll believe you I'll even help them if I can help them I'll help them and I want to
[01:12:10] SPEAKER_00: legit I have introduced into the biggest CMOs the biggest the hardest companies they fucking love
[01:12:16] SPEAKER_02: peak yeah they love peak do they even know what they're talking about I find a lot of
[01:12:20] SPEAKER_00: females don't even know what they're talking about an AI I disagree Jason I actually genuine comment
[01:12:25] SPEAKER_01: here and kind of I do think I understand your point about you know how actionable is the
[01:12:31] SPEAKER_01: information but look you were at Adobe marketing stepping back another decade before you were there
[01:12:37] SPEAKER_01: I was an investor in armature which is the company that became the Adobe marketing cloud when
[01:12:41] SPEAKER_01: they bought it in 08 or 09 right so and way back when you call snake or and I mean let me encapsulate
[01:12:49] SPEAKER_01: the point you're making because there's some fruit to it but then let me make the counter-argument
[01:12:53] SPEAKER_01: what you're basically saying is at some level these tools just tell you how you're showing up on
[01:13:00] SPEAKER_01: on the LLMs just like way back in the day analytics told you what was going on in your website
[01:13:08] SPEAKER_01: you're like why do I do with this information the thing is you have to know the information
[01:13:13] SPEAKER_01: especially in a larger corporation even if initially you can't do anything with it step one is if
[01:13:19] SPEAKER_01: you're the VP of marketing at a large corporation and your CEO comes in and says I typed in
[01:13:25] SPEAKER_01: lori al into the web's into um chachi pt last night and they said 10 mean things about us what the
[01:13:31] SPEAKER_01: fuck right you better have an answer to that right you simply and and and initially for that first
[01:13:37] SPEAKER_01: year just giving that high price VP of marketing an answer is worth 30 grand because the world I
[01:13:44] SPEAKER_01: mean because one thing I've internalized about you know all these media types is every add every
[01:13:50] SPEAKER_01: market here knows in the end you just have to go where the people are and you have to show up with
[01:13:55] SPEAKER_01: the people are and when the people went to Yahoo from TV you had to show up there or went to
[01:13:59] SPEAKER_01: went to Google from here they want to go there when I went to Facebook you had to go there right
[01:14:03] SPEAKER_01: and the people are going to use they're using answer engines they're using llms and you have to
[01:14:09] SPEAKER_01: know how you show up there and it's different it's not like you can advertise so there's going to be
[01:14:15] SPEAKER_01: a market for the selling snake oil when it's unactionable but you're right you're that's I have no
[01:14:20] SPEAKER_00: doubt you can do 50 million here very quickly after you just but you write what's going to have to
[01:14:25] SPEAKER_01: happen and all these companies are going to do it I think they're got the opportunity to you have
[01:14:29] SPEAKER_01: to then figure out how you what do you do with that information how do you make it actionable right
[01:14:33] SPEAKER_01: because let me tell you what they're not going to do Jason no marketing on the plan of this going to
[01:14:38] SPEAKER_01: say I now know I show up shitty on llms but it's not actionable mr CEO so we're just fucked
[01:14:45] SPEAKER_01: settle in and die right no because the CEO is going to go come in and he's going to say I don't
[01:14:49] SPEAKER_01: give a damn how you do it you figure out how to get us on the front page of chat GPT saying
[01:14:55] SPEAKER_01: lori alla whatever product is so for whatever it is is awesome right are you going to lose your job
[01:15:00] SPEAKER_01: so I mean again if all the so let's go on point yeah I think there is a billion dollar
[01:15:07] SPEAKER_00: air opportunity here I think there's a billion dollar opportunity in AI sales I just I
[01:15:14] SPEAKER_00: I and marketing I haven't seen it yet in an eight geo there is if you do all of this for real I'll
[01:15:18] SPEAKER_00: give you a hundred grand okay and you you actually increase the number of qualified visitors to my
[01:15:26] SPEAKER_00: website by 50 percent everyone in the world will give you a hundred grand like if you can do the
[01:15:30] SPEAKER_00: cursor I know we all hate the cursor of whatever pitch but somewhat a lot of folks say they built
[01:15:35] SPEAKER_00: the cursor of marketing I will buy it I have not seen it as soon as they do this will be a billion
[01:15:40] SPEAKER_00: dollar air opportunity in 36 months but the snake oil isn't going to do it little tiny point
[01:15:45] SPEAKER_00: solutions they get you 5 percent of the way there that amplitude clones isn't going to do but there
[01:15:49] SPEAKER_00: is a built like there is so much money for actually doing that making it actionable there is so much
[01:15:55] SPEAKER_00: my everyone is their SEO is down there's going to be in my opinion two levels of actionable they'll
[01:16:00] SPEAKER_01: be actionable you know right now where it's like oh my gosh this is what the lm's are saying about
[01:16:04] SPEAKER_01: you figure out where they're driving that in driving that information which is typically via
[01:16:10] SPEAKER_01: the search that the lm does and then figure out how to get nice things said there that's kind of
[01:16:14] SPEAKER_01: the action was today and you're right that's loosely coupled at best right but look the big
[01:16:19] SPEAKER_01: shoe that's going to drop and it goes back to the first conversation is when Shaqqqt starts
[01:16:24] SPEAKER_01: allowing advertising right then you know the dynamics of this business change a lot right and
[01:16:30] SPEAKER_01: if they're going to be advertising there's going to be monitoring of advertising and then you
[01:16:34] SPEAKER_01: write then the wall of money is going to hit here and then people are going to want to know how to
[01:16:39] SPEAKER_01: measure it and how to track it and how to influence it so I think that's the big picture bet here and
[01:16:43] SPEAKER_01: again I like the space I take on board your comments on the product but go when chat gbt allows
[01:16:50] SPEAKER_02: advertising worry what happens to the players in this market are they hurt or are they helped
[01:16:56] you can imagine a world where you could go either way I mean if you look at one of the interesting
[01:17:02] SPEAKER_01: what we talked about scmwash the outcomes in search engine optimizations haven't been amazing
[01:17:08] SPEAKER_01: samwash is actually the biggest outcome at two billion in a way that all the other stuff like
[01:17:12] SPEAKER_01: website analytics and email analytics all had much bigger outcomes so you could argue that
[01:17:19] SPEAKER_01: if the chat gbt version of advertising is similar to google then the platform gets all the money
[01:17:26] SPEAKER_01: and doesn't allow a ton of kind of ancillary products to thrive and maybe it's only a so-so outcome
[01:17:32] SPEAKER_01: right and maybe that's the case a lot depends on how chat gbt whatever chat gbt implements between
[01:17:37] SPEAKER_01: advertising and commerce you know how much of a role is left for ancillary players that's what you
[01:17:43] SPEAKER_01: you know quite know that at this stage right you can argue that the midterm question on these
[01:17:48] SPEAKER_01: companies is there's some element of platform risk and and will they allow enough gap but in the
[01:17:54] SPEAKER_01: other hand it's a complex enough problem that if you're a large corporation spending a lot of money
[01:18:00] SPEAKER_01: to improve how you quote unquote show up in AI intuitively there's going to be spend there will it be
[01:18:06] SPEAKER_01: 200,000 per company are two million per large corporate I don't know that's the risk in the deal
[01:18:10] SPEAKER_01: and I obviously you can tell from the way I'm murdering I don't have clarity on that but intuitively
[01:18:15] SPEAKER_01: I go back to my first principles if all the people are showing up in the LLM's then all the advertisers
[01:18:21] SPEAKER_01: are going to want to show up in the LLM's and if you can help them get there you can probably clip
[01:18:26] SPEAKER_01: some of that money that's the very unsuattled thesis final one before we do it would you rather
[01:18:32] SPEAKER_02: break is any love that where do we want to go we've got Figma obviously IPO price in my day are now
[01:18:39] SPEAKER_02: Oracle down 40% we can do Cal she's new round any preference that we can talk about Figma is
[01:18:47] SPEAKER_00: definitely maybe we should talk about I just feel like it's a Debbie Downer I mean it was like
[01:18:52] SPEAKER_00: I mean it was Figma IPO was so exciting right it was just everyone was captivated by it
[01:18:58] SPEAKER_00: almost beyond what it deserved right almost at a consumer level almost at a Google or
[01:19:02] SPEAKER_00: Facebook level and to be a broken IPO at least for a while it's just it's just a bummer for
[01:19:09] for we when we talked about a little bit last week for just the feeling that liquidity was back
[01:19:13] SPEAKER_00: and IPO is back it's just a bummer maybe Bill Gurley thinks it's great because they got a good deal
[01:19:17] SPEAKER_00: but it's a super active IPO market is great for everyone from VC down to founder it's just a big plus
[01:19:24] SPEAKER_00: having a meh IPO market is not going to help any of us I don't think it's meh I mean I think look
[01:19:28] SPEAKER_01: I would argue that it goes back to what I said earlier voting versus a weighing machine right
[01:19:33] SPEAKER_01: the professionals all looked at the stock and said we should transact at 35 which is roughly the
[01:19:38] SPEAKER_01: same valuation Adobe offered two years ago which totally makes sense you'd only bid 40 year or two
[01:19:43] SPEAKER_01: in an M&A and then all the retail madness took over and it was worked it was valued at a hundred
[01:19:48] SPEAKER_01: and something and now over time yeah the voting stops and the weighing begins and now it's
[01:19:55] SPEAKER_01: pretty much priced exactly what they thought it was worth six months ago I would argue it you know
[01:20:00] SPEAKER_01: in the end the markets are efficient and it's a great outcome lighting up everybody it's $17 18
[01:20:05] SPEAKER_01: billion market cap for an awesome company yeah you are the process has been a bit of a Debbie
[01:20:09] SPEAKER_01: Downer to your point Jason but they intrinsic again intrinsic valuation wins out in the end
[01:20:15] SPEAKER_01: capitalism works it is it is a reminder though if you if you turn down a deal you better want it
[01:20:20] SPEAKER_00: to go public because it's not just down from Adobe you've got to take in delusion and time
[01:20:25] SPEAKER_00: value of money right I tried to write it up on saster I think it's like 30 or 40 percent lower
[01:20:30] SPEAKER_00: than Adobe deal adjusted for time delusion and risk 30 to 40 percent lower so you better when
[01:20:34] SPEAKER_00: you say no you better and that granted they didn't say no they said yes and yes and yes so who knows
[01:20:42] SPEAKER_00: what what really what really is going through everybody's minds but but just you know it's just it's
[01:20:48] SPEAKER_00: just it's just it's just it's just tough to not be above that that that number and you know we've
[01:20:54] SPEAKER_00: already forgotten about whiz it seems like three generations ago right but we and it seems you
[01:20:59] SPEAKER_00: know it seems almost quaint compared to cursor but maybe it ends up being one of the greatest
[01:21:03] SPEAKER_00: to you know the deals smartest deals of all time right to be clear you're talking about there the
[01:21:08] SPEAKER_01: whiz decision to sell for 32 billion which deal is still pending but it's got you it's not
[01:21:15] SPEAKER_01: us regulatory clearance now unlike poor figma who didn't are in indeed much worse poor little i
[01:21:21] SPEAKER_01: robots a lumbar who didn't get clearance and then pretty much one bankrupt because they couldn't
[01:21:26] SPEAKER_01: sell their company so yes anti trust has had an invidious influence it just would be nice if
[01:21:32] SPEAKER_00: everyone could IPO next year that needs IPO and I'm not being facetious it would be nice if the
[01:21:37] SPEAKER_00: market was overheated if it didn't quite make sense if figma was trading at twice its IPO price
[01:21:43] SPEAKER_00: and it could actually lift some folks that were a layer below figma you know it would be nice
[01:21:48] SPEAKER_00: of folks at 200 growing 30 percent that are still in that second tier nominally right that we
[01:21:53] SPEAKER_00: talked about right there it'd be nice if they could calmly IPO next year with with with over
[01:21:58] SPEAKER_00: demand IPO's over subscribed IPO's and just free up liquidity and portfolios I'm not being facetious
[01:22:04] SPEAKER_00: it would be great if if if we just had a little more froth on the market do you think we all
[01:22:07] SPEAKER_00: gonna see any opening of the IPO markets next year I don't think we're going to see it I don't
[01:22:12] SPEAKER_00: think we earned it this year I don't think we earned it I don't think I don't think we have so many
[01:22:17] SPEAKER_00: you're better than figma you're better than net scope it's a high bar in IPO's it tends to be
[01:22:23] SPEAKER_01: Pavlovian people do things when the the last thing they did felt good and Jason's right is that
[01:22:29] SPEAKER_01: these IPO's don't feel good so it won't be easy to have more now the way you make things easy
[01:22:35] SPEAKER_01: is price I mean price is one way to make things easy the other is the kind of companies that go
[01:22:40] SPEAKER_01: public so you know if the overall equity markets stay roughly okay then there's lots of companies
[01:22:48] SPEAKER_01: that can choose to go public if they want to because they're above the bar the question is will
[01:22:53] SPEAKER_01: they want to and that's more a function of your individual company decisions or whether they want
[01:22:57] SPEAKER_01: to or not but I'm with you Jason it would be great a more wide open window would be good for many
[01:23:03] SPEAKER_01: on many different dimensions I just feel like adventure we're acting as if these liquidity
[01:23:08] SPEAKER_00: windows are way open and I get challenged but I don't see it I don't see the IPO market way open
[01:23:13] SPEAKER_00: I don't see billion dollar M&A deals from P firms and everyone happening every week
[01:23:18] SPEAKER_00: the limited visibility I have on billion dollar M&A in my portfolio or with friends it's happening
[01:23:23] SPEAKER_00: but it's stressful no one's sitting there just writing thrown billion dollar chips into the
[01:23:28] SPEAKER_00: middle of the table because it's the age of AI like in some ways they did in 2021 right so it
[01:23:33] SPEAKER_00: there is more stress in the equity in the system than we think with these open AI and strike
[01:23:38] SPEAKER_00: secondaries I think there's and it's just a bummer we didn't de-stress it this year but that's our job
[01:23:42] SPEAKER_00: we you know I mean we still have our fees we still have our fees to get us through these rough
[01:23:46] SPEAKER_00: patches right but I'm not gonna let that happen no I'm not I take fees it's good it's success only
[01:23:56] SPEAKER_00: at 20 yeah we're 30 fun we go big on the carry where's the same worry told worry told me they
[01:24:02] SPEAKER_02: don't do fees either so I just fully updated doesn't it yeah no fees I mean look in the end for most
[01:24:08] SPEAKER_01: normal fun size despite the cynicism the truth is you make your big money on carry right A for all
[01:24:14] SPEAKER_01: the obvious reasons and B it's taxed advantage so yes it would be really great if the window opened
[01:24:20] SPEAKER_01: and the scary thing going back to linking it to the AI thing is whatever year that goes by
[01:24:25] SPEAKER_01: the probability is that the next crop of IPOs will be AI first companies from
[01:24:31] SPEAKER_01: 2022 are pre-Ai pre-22 companies that have clawed their way into AI land and the probability goes
[01:24:38] SPEAKER_01: down that those three four hundred companies that are unicorns pre-2022 that aren't making the
[01:24:45] SPEAKER_01: transition will ever get out right and every year that goes by as a tech debt mounts as the
[01:24:50] SPEAKER_01: new world order becomes clearer the probability of most of those companies getting out has to decline
[01:24:55] SPEAKER_01: and that's the scary thing and then we're going to have to maintain a 2021 mark if you haven't seen
[01:25:01] SPEAKER_00: massive AI progress what do you think is becoming into the year at scale I don't it's very hard
[01:25:07] SPEAKER_01: to imagine any 2021 mark that's been maintained that hasn't been validated or anywhere close to it
[01:25:12] SPEAKER_01: and we wouldn't and haven't I mean everyone ever they're all been marked down I think they have I
[01:25:16] SPEAKER_01: mean I think most people I mean I can't imagine look I regularly for my bedtime reading I
[01:25:22] SPEAKER_01: eyeball the list of unicorns by year and you just look at it and you go oh that's good that's good
[01:25:27] SPEAKER_01: oh no no no no yeah I'm not even close right I mean I think there's enough data that says you
[01:25:32] SPEAKER_01: know 40 I mean the various surveys you know the secondaries might be representative but yeah I don't
[01:25:38] SPEAKER_01: think that if you have a 21 mark that you have it that hasn't been validated since then if you're
[01:25:45] SPEAKER_01: trading at six times revenues and you've grown into it then yeah you if you're still trading at
[01:25:50] SPEAKER_01: 20 times revenues you might want to think about it I'm asking for myself do you think six x is okay
[01:25:54] SPEAKER_00: if you've grown into a five or six x the it's it's growth adjusted it's all the things you talk
[01:25:59] SPEAKER_01: about it's it's good look the truth is if you're in a boring I mean we see it on sandwich at
[01:26:04] SPEAKER_01: you three or four times you sit you cited wicks it's way or four times you know on the other hand
[01:26:08] SPEAKER_01: with 25 percent growth you get to 12 I mean the interesting thing is how fine-grained it is you know
[01:26:13] SPEAKER_01: small percentage points of revenue growth here between 15 and 25 have massive consequences
[01:26:20] SPEAKER_01: in terms of value which actually is a whole theme for some of you know as you talk to CEOs how
[01:26:26] SPEAKER_01: easy it is to move from you know not great to awesome with just a little bit of re-exceleration
[01:26:32] SPEAKER_01: you're right but you know why it's so much harder than it looks because if you're growing 15% or so
[01:26:37] SPEAKER_00: or in the in the teens probably the majority is from price increases in today that's you know it's
[01:26:42] SPEAKER_00: fake growth it is price increases or stuff jam down the channel and maybe it's a couple percent
[01:26:48] SPEAKER_00: from new logos but if you're increasing effective pricing eight to nine percent a year even with
[01:26:53] some retention issues the truth is it could be half the growth right so it's not that that doesn't
[01:26:58] SPEAKER_00: count it just makes it much harder to get into the 20s no in the end exactly you're not going to get
[01:27:02] SPEAKER_01: into 20s on pricing increases you're going to get into you're not even going to get into 20s
[01:27:06] SPEAKER_01: probably on NDR you're going to get into 20s because new people want your product which is why
[01:27:12] SPEAKER_01: you know which is why you're going right back to grow and all that if you cut our end in the
[01:27:16] SPEAKER_01: downturn you're probably screwed if you don't have that compelling second product that you built in
[01:27:21] SPEAKER_01: 22 23 24 you know you're just in a tough place okay we're going to do a quick fire where this is
[01:27:29] SPEAKER_02: your favorite would you rather yeah okay yeah would you rather be in wicks or would you rather be
[01:27:35] SPEAKER_02: in loveable um from avenge that's a good question this is from a mate money perspective
[01:27:43] SPEAKER_02: I'll go at loveable at the margin um you know I I bought come this interesting I don't have clarity
[01:27:52] SPEAKER_01: on how wicks is vibe called product does roll out across the rest of the organist if I had
[01:27:57] SPEAKER_01: clarity on that I would take wicks all day every day because I think you could make a four or
[01:28:00] SPEAKER_01: five X would be liquid but I don't have a thesis on it I mean you you started my inner comment
[01:28:05] SPEAKER_01: that I had a clear thesis there I don't have in wicks if I spent the time maybe I would but in the
[01:28:10] SPEAKER_01: absence of data you know it's it's a presumed guilty it presumed innocent in the absence of data to
[01:28:16] SPEAKER_01: the contrary the prior is that the AI first company has the edge in terms of growth so I'll go at
[01:28:22] SPEAKER_01: lovable at the margin but I'm a bit nervous at six billion just to be clear a bit well my so this
[01:28:30] SPEAKER_00: and I watched your interview with the base 44 guys pretty good I mean we knew it was good right did
[01:28:34] SPEAKER_00: you think it was good yeah he's pretty good yeah I feel like I know this space pretty well now
[01:28:38] SPEAKER_00: listen of course he's a founder he he me he should know all the stuff but his fluidity in the space
[01:28:44] SPEAKER_00: and his knowledge of where it's gonna go and how to play it like pretty impressive so here's my
[01:28:48] SPEAKER_00: question Harry to you and is he gonna stay if he's gonna stay for because it felt like he's gonna
[01:28:54] SPEAKER_00: stay okay but if he's really gonna stay 24 months I'm going wicks just on financial engineering nothing
[01:28:59] SPEAKER_00: against lovable if he's gonna stay if he's gonna leave I'm putting my money in lovable if I have
[01:29:03] SPEAKER_00: to pick but he's gonna stay on the way on the way of rain that may or will stay yeah so I'm not sure
[01:29:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna do it but if you promise me he'll stay for 24 months I'll go in on because that arbitrage
[01:29:12] SPEAKER_00: to that second bucket is so palpable but he's got to stay yeah really good I didn't know when they
[01:29:18] SPEAKER_00: bought it I've used I've used base 44 but he's he's yeah if I was on his comp committed I've done
[01:29:25] SPEAKER_01: this with some of my existing companies I would have that guy on an accelerated equity grant
[01:29:30] SPEAKER_01: program based on upsell of the new AI product across existing customer base that would make him
[01:29:37] SPEAKER_01: wildly wealthy double or treble he's already hit if he got the penetration of the 20% and if he's
[01:29:44] SPEAKER_01: as good as you say that's because that's the mission here if you can get penetration as product
[01:29:48] SPEAKER_01: the 20% you go in it you go and you probably jump two buckets Jason you probably jump to the 25
[01:29:52] SPEAKER_01: bucket yeah the problem is he could probably raise it a billion now on a new startup that's the
[01:29:58] SPEAKER_00: problem so you got to compete with that now that's not liquid right but how do you if you're running
[01:30:02] SPEAKER_00: wicks how do you compete with the fact that I mean listen he he in a sense he sold really cheap
[01:30:06] SPEAKER_00: right looking back on it the time it seemed like a an internet time it any time it seemed like a
[01:30:10] SPEAKER_00: fair deal it did it did the only thing I'll say and I'm not sharing because I don't know anything I
[01:30:15] SPEAKER_02: do know from him directly that there is a variable package yeah and so he unwaveringly has
[01:30:21] SPEAKER_02: upside if he hits not he's starting over in the old days like 24 months ago a guy like him would
[01:30:26] SPEAKER_00: start over and instead of raising it 10 pre he'd raise it 50 pre for his next company or 60 now
[01:30:32] SPEAKER_00: he can raise it a billion pre for his next startup and I'm not saying it's liquid but it's a siren
[01:30:37] SPEAKER_00: call yeah no he's aggressive a billion and we'll give you 150 to start from end reason keep going
[01:30:45] I've got one to know to if you're ambitious it's a tough one to say no to 150 million to start
[01:30:50] SPEAKER_00: base 45 I don't know a lot about a lot but I know how to design compliance you could give that guy
[01:30:55] SPEAKER_01: a package of wicks that makes it work his while absolutely because there's only one thing that
[01:30:59] SPEAKER_01: matters in that damn thing it's like get that damn penetration to 20 or 30% and you have a thing and
[01:31:04] SPEAKER_01: if not you have a 2x revenue growth 4x revenue growth thing so it's pretty you know going back to
[01:31:09] SPEAKER_01: where we started this mission clarity I mean call it war mode call it what you like mission clarity
[01:31:14] SPEAKER_01: is worth a lot right the mission clarity for that company is take this existing customer base
[01:31:20] SPEAKER_01: who should be using five coding to build this stuff may you have the product you've bought the
[01:31:24] SPEAKER_01: part that you have the founder make it happen but here's a question if there were 2 billion today
[01:31:28] SPEAKER_00: and he if he does 250 next year then there let's say there were 5 billion because of multiple
[01:31:33] SPEAKER_00: inflation which is worth right you got to pay him 300 million because he's added 3 billion
[01:31:38] SPEAKER_00: in your market you got to give him an Elon package to stay you got to give him 10% of it you got
[01:31:43] SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to devolve down to numbers that and that I'll get shown back in my face every one of my
[01:31:48] SPEAKER_01: two e-nodes and I got to run to I would quit if you didn't give me 300 million Roy we miss you in
