[00:00:00] In my career working in AI, I have yet to meet a single person that ever felt like they
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_00: had enough computer.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_01: I could not ask for a bad-a-guest.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_01: Andrew Ng globally recognized leader in AI.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_01: Data centers are the critical infrastructure for building the digital economy.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: I think that open-way models is a tremendous source of geopolitical influence.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: The work I think the velocity when China's government makes an all-nation commitment is
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: an all-industrial commitment.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: That's actually a very powerful force today, wouldn't underestimate.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: My friend Martin Martin Castado, that was very memorable.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: I actually told him to be here.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_01: I love Martin, very, very special man.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_01: I want to start with something that you've said before.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_01: You said AI is the new electricity, and when I think about electricity and where we are
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_01: today, I want to understand the bottlenecks.
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_01: Everyone seems to suggest that it really is about data, compute, and algorithms.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: Is that the three parameters to which we should think about bottlenecks?
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: If so, which one do you think is the biggest bottleneck?
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_01: I would say the two biggest bottlenecks right now, it may be, I think, electricity is one
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_00: of them.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_00: In the US, I am honestly worried that many data center operators were stuck in permitting.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_00: I know that local community support is important, and some people don't want the data center
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_00: there.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: Once we build roads and railways as the infrastructure for a certain generation, data
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: centers are the critical infrastructure for building the digital economy.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_00: So lack of electricity in America and in a number of Western countries is a problem.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: In contrast, I see China building power plants left and right, including nuclear.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_00: So that would be interesting dynamic.
[00:02:09] Seven conductors is another bottleneck.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: AI is so complicated.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: I think we also need more data.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_00: We also need more better algorithms.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: All of this worth working on.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: In the short term, some constraints with electricity and some conductors.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: Can you talk to me about the constraints around semiconductors that you think are most
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_01: pressing that most people don't realize?
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_01: First, in my career working in AI, I have yet to meet a single AI person that ever felt
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: like they had enough compute.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: So you know, get us any amount of compute, we will use it all up and say we still don't
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: have enough.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: So this is the constraint for the last 20 years or so.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_00: But what I'm seeing is with the rise of Gen.A.I., there are very valuable workloads.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_00: For example, AI is just a coding.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's fantastic.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_00: It's making us so much more productive.
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: But if you use cloud code enough, sometimes you get really limited and I find that many
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: companies have really have access demand, which is a very rare problem to have.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: But so many people are one more own inference, one more tokens generated.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: And we just don't have the semiconductors and data centers and electricity to meet the
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: demand.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: But you know, there's a lot we could do with AI token generation and it's frustrating
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: when we can't, when the supply side, we can't supply enough to people that want it on the
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: demand side.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_00: You know, you get very limited if you use too much.
[00:03:36] How should I think about that?
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_01: Insatiable need for more compute and the improvements that come from it.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: With the recognition that many people say GPT-5 was the example that scaling laws have
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: been reached to certainly stand and a focus on efficiency has been a transition.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: How should I balance this suit to seemingly differing opinions?
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_01: So it is true that on token generation is getting more efficient and cheaper.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: In fact, if you look at OpenEI's Open Weight model, they actually release models.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: They are very efficient to run.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_00: So I think they did a good job with was it like a 120 billion parameters or something with
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: I think 5.7 billion active.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: So it's a very efficient model to run.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_00: But despite the cost of token generation falling, our demand for it is, you know, insatiable.
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: One interesting thing that's happened in AI is if we look at where the buckers of value,
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: one of the big buckers of value is AI-acistic coding.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_00: And I think this harkens back to an earlier era.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: In a previous generation, I think Google came to dominate horizontal information discovery
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_00: like web search.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: But there's room for lots of verticals when the internet was being built.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: So we wanted with, you know, with travel, loss in expedia, for sale for travel, bunch
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: of folks for sale in retail, bunch of others for sale in transportation, social media,
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_00: and so on.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: What's seen now is, um, CHI-GBT has such a strong consumer brand.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_00: Uh, CHI-GBT seems to be the dominant player in the new new gen horizontal information discovery.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: I think Gemini with his channel advantage to control Vandro and Chrome, you know, is a,
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_00: is a serious player as well.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_00: But if that's where horizontal information turns out to be, then there's still plenty
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_00: of room for lots of verticals to be built out.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_00: And one of the clear buckles that really valuable verticals is AI coding assistance where
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: cloud code is, you know, I use that every day.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_00: Love it.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: Open the eye, uh, uh, uh, codex has a lot of momentum as well.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: But it's clearly making developers so much more productive and efficient that the demand
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_00: is just through the roof for less, less use more and more of this.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_00: One thing I find exciting is I often look at AI coding assistance as a harbinger for
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_00: what might happen to other job functions as well as the, uh, marketing tools become
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: more efficient as the air recruiting tools were more efficient.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_00: I find it's to become more efficient.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_00: So I often look at AI coding assistance as a, uh, you know, maybe a foreshadowing when
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_00: we happen as well to other sectors as the tools get better for them too.
[00:06:16] I had Joel Pinot from cohere and former Facebook on the show recently and she said that AI coding
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_01: assistance are in the same place that maybe image generation was in 2016, 2017 in terms
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: of maturity.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_01: Do you think that's a first state of the environment today or do you not think so?
[00:06:36] I don't know.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: I think it spreader along.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: I think in 2016, image generation wasn't super valuable.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: Uh, I don't remember it being that valuable back then, but I think today, AI coding assistance
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: is really, actually, uh, AI fund, my, uh, head of engineering recie.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: I would say, hey, let's think about standardizing on tools and, you know, basically, he said,
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_00: you know, I need these tools and you have to pry them out of my code dead hands.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: I think I think our developers feel really strongly.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: I myself, I don't ever want to have to code the game with what AI coding assistance.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_00: So I think the tools are really working well, but still with a lot of, uh, headroom for
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_00: how much better can get.
[00:07:17] I do just want to go back to the kind of the core board one is we said, they're about
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_01: all extra sting.
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_01: We said they're about semi conductors.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_01: I think when we look at like the build out of data centers today, as you said, regulation
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_01: has been a big part of preventing that in a lot of ways.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_01: Do you think Trump has done more to help or to hurt the progression of AI in the United
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_01: States from an infrastructure perspective?
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_01: Over the last few years, the US federal government has done some good things and some less
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: helpful things.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: Um, I feel like clearing out unnecessary regulations has been a very good move.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_00: Um, even last year, uh, the bipartisan Schumer AI insight forum, I, I, I think there are
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: a lot of people lobbying the US government to pass cycling regulations.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: You know, there are a lot of hyped up AI safety narratives saying AI could lead to human
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_00: extinction, which is kind of ridiculous statement.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: Um, uh, to try to get cycling anti competitive regulations passed often to try to shut down
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: open source open weight.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_00: Fortunately, we'll be back a lot of that.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_00: But I think the bipartisan Schumer insight forum did a really good job digging to the truth
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: and concluding that the America should be investing in AI rather than you're passing
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: unnecessary regulations to slow it down.
[00:08:28] Um, I think Trump did a good job, um, uh, and then his whole team, David Saxon, Christian
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: and so on, did a good job clearing out unnecessary regulations, uh, on the flip side.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: One of America's huge competitive advantages has been this ability to attract talent, uh,
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: including high school talent, as well as your frankly young talent that may not currently
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: be high school, but could be high school in the future.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_00: And so I think, um, to the extent that America is, uh, uh, uh, not investing as much in
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: attracting talent, I think that would be an unforce error.
[00:09:04] Um, and then I think lost the, you know, investments in science, right?
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_00: I think, uh, I think helping our institutions of higher education, uh, have the resources
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: to train our grad students to invest in science and technology, I think that's really precious.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: And so anything that damages that I think will also be very unfortunate.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: If I gave you a regulatory magic wand, Andrew, what would you change that would have the
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_01: most significant needle moving impact?
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_01: America is fortunate to have a lot of very smart people wanting to come here, uh, to do
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: really challenging, really tough problems.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_00: Um, many of our Nobel laurels are immigrants, uh, you know, Einstein, Kanagawa's Abbas
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_00: and I think continuing to cultivate America, um, as a place to track great talent to work
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: together in, in a place, in a, in a democratic nation that, that respect the rule of law,
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: I think that would, uh, help us move ahead.
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_00: Um, I think that, uh, securing the semiconductor supply chain would be very valuable as well.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: A lot of friends in Taiwan, I love Taiwan, uh, and also, um, America's dependency on TSMC,
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: uh, is concerning, in case anything happens.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_00: Um, and then I think making, and then frankly, there's one very funny thing that happened
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: in society, which is, um, there was a recently a pure report showing, I think, how much
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_00: America's, you know, uh, uh, think AI would be good for them, enthusiastic for it versus
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: non-inthusiasm.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: And even though a lot of the technologies were invented in America, um, a lot of people
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: don't trust or don't like AI.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_00: The joys of what I do, Andrews, I get to speak to incredible people and then kind of cross-reference
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_01: what they say.
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_01: You know, David Cahn from Secours said, hey, a really useful barometer for effectiveness
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_01: is Kan AI replaced the bottom 5% of capabilities of what, what workforce does.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_01: Joel from cohere said, no, that's crap.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_01: Uh, the real question is, can it 10X people's ability, forget the bottom 5% can it 10X?
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_01: How do you think about a barometer for success of the workforce with AI with those in mind?
[00:11:24] In the case of software engineering, it is accelerating the rating of codes.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: Uh, there are so many projects that used to take, you know, six engineers half a year
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: to build that today, I or one of my engineers can build in the weekend.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_00: I hope that we never have to go back to coding without AI assistance again because the
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_00: acceleration, the productivity boost is, is, is incredible.
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_00: And we're, for example, one weekend, I thought, oh, I want to, you know, my daughter, I
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_00: want to flash cars for my daughter to practice multiplication.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_00: She wants to practice multiplication.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_00: She want to flash cars.
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_00: So I thought I could either drive to the store and buy a bunch of flash cards for her.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: Or if you just, you know, use AI to write code for me to generate and print out a bunch
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_00: of flash cards.
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_00: And so I did the latter.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_00: And so does a very low economic value task, both AI as a coding, it could get that done
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_00: very quickly.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_00: Do you think vibe coding is an enduring market?
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_01: Like do you think everyone will want to code?
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: An accessibility is important.
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_01: Or do you think blunt nature allows builders to build better and more efficiently?
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_01: I think we need all of the above.
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: You know, I've had mixed feelings about determine vibe coding, but nitpicking terminology
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: aside, I think everyone should learn to code.
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_00: What I'm seeing is for a lot of job rules that aren't just software engineering, people
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_00: that can code can get more done than people that can't code.
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: For example, I think my, my, my marketer wanted to run as user survey once.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: And she wanted, you know, something for people to give live feedback.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: And she looked the app store, couldn't find anything.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: So she said, you know what?
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to spend two days to code that.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_00: It take a, take a two days, but my, uh, uh, marketer then build a little mobile app where
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_00: users could swipe, you know, left or right to give feedback on some marketing messages.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_00: We want to use the test.
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_00: And because of that, we're able to run user experiments, get feedback.
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_00: And so it helped her do her job better as a marketer.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: Whereas in contrast, a marketer, they couldn't code a little app to, you know, let people
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_00: swipe around and give feedback.
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_00: They were just not helping me to do this.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: We're not have gone to feedback.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: We're not having to move forward today.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_00: My best recruiters, not only today screen resumes by hand, they are writing prompts to
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_00: get AI to help them screen resumes.
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: Um, as been interesting, we would, which is amazing, but going to your point on my
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_01: old people shouldn't be fearful and they are fearful.
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_01: You, you, you see that that would lead to efficiency gains, which mean headcount reductions.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_01: If you can screen so much more with AI, I'm not into this kind of fear mungering.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_01: So, but like, if you can screen a lot more with AI, I don't need my three other analysts.
[00:14:14] I think there's a small subset of jobs that, you know, frankly are in trouble.
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_00: Uh, but I think for the vast majority of knowledge workers, uh, actually, we, she's one
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: thing about a hype.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: Um, AI is amazing.
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: There's lots of can't do.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_00: So this phantom, a GI, someday with AI, I think, and do everything a human can do.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_00: I think we're very far away from that.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_00: I'll say, no, like decades away, maybe even longer.
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_00: And the trick is if AI could do 30% of her recruiters job, you know, who knows, maybe
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_00: 50% although that feels a little bit high.
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: There's another lights, 50 to 70% of stuff that we still need the human to do.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_00: But there's also clear that if you use a and someone doesn't, that's actually a huge
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_00: difference in what you can accomplish.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_00: So better go much better off using AI.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_00: But because AI can't do everything, there's still plenty of work.
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_00: There was still many humans to do for a lot of job roles.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: Do you not think we have a white collar talent pipeline problem though, which is whether
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_01: you're a consultant or you're a legal associate in the junior ranks, a lot of what you can
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_01: do is being replaced by AI.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_01: And they are actually cutting juniors.
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_01: You're seeing this across the board.
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_01: And so what's the fear is we're going to have this talent hole where in 10 years time,
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_01: there's no juniors to go up into seniors because we've replaced them.
[00:15:33] Yeah, I don't think this is dire as that.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: I think there is a big problem, but I don't think it's exactly that problem.
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_00: So let me tell you what I'm seeing in software engineering.
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_00: The most productive engineers I know, they're not fresh college strats.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_00: They are people of 10, 20 years of experience or whatever and really on top of AI and
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_00: know the AI tools and understand the AI code.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: So those people experience and on top of AI move faster than anything the world has seen
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: even 102 years ago.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_00: One tier down is actually a fresh college strats that are really on top of AI.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_00: So I've hired quite a few people, fresh college strats that for whatever reason through the
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_00: social network community really learned the AI tools and they move really fast.
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_00: But they're not as good as people experience of that no AI.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: One tier down for the fresh college strats is the people with 10 years of coding experience,
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_00: but who had a comfortable job and for whatever reason is still coding like us, 2022 before
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_00: tragedy, those people I just don't hire people like that anymore, but there are people
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_00: that you know, they're the comfortable job.
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_00: They kept coding the old way and they just did not learn AI.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: I think those people may get into trouble at some point.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_00: But there's one other one which is the tier that isn't trouble, which is the fresh
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_00: college strats that don't know AI.
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: One unfortunate thing is university curricular is slow to change.
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_00: And so I actually feel pretty bad that even today there are universities graduating CS
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_00: undergrad that have not made a single call to single API on the internet.
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_00: And imagine graduating a CS undergrad that has never heard of cloud computing.
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_00: I was like, what is a cloud?
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I don't need to just run things.
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_00: That's weird.
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_00: You just can't be a CS major and not know how to do things in the cloud.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_00: And I'm feeling like I'm getting a point where I don't think it's right.
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_00: I feel like we've got to not train CS majors without also making sure they know how to
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_00: use AI to help them with coding, without also making them know the AI building blocks.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_00: The university curriculum, and that's the cohort of students that enter in the job market
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_00: that's really struggling.
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_00: But the fresh college grads know AI.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_00: We can't find enough of them.
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_00: So many businesses love to hire those fresh college grads.
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_00: I just want to touch on the 10X100X engineers that you said are just amazing, amazing.
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_01: We're seeing pay packets, compensation brands, large than they've ever been, you know,
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_01: three and a half billion dollars in certain cases for a single engineer.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_01: Are these justified pay packages given the impact that they are having on companies
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_01: enterprise value?
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_01: Or is this bubble like pay packages that we should be concerned by?
[00:18:19] I don't know.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_00: It's very hard to say.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_00: I know a number of people that got a really huge pay packet.
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_00: So I'm actually very happy for them.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: I think it's great.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_00: The funding going into, you know, pay AI people really well.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: Do you think I mean it nicely?
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_01: Do you think it's a $100 million for an engineer?
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_01: I worry that you're just not going to be as productive.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_01: If I give you $100 million overnight, God, you might buy a nice house and go and hold
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_01: it and, you know, you lose a bit of efficiency.
[00:18:47] I don't know.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_00: I have lost so many friends that, you know, for whatever reason have made a lot of money.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_00: Many of them just keep working really, really hard.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: But equally before and after, you know, they wound up making a little bit of money.
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_00: So I find that a lot of the tech culture, we do stuff because it's fun because it's
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_00: just, you know, hopefully, hope other people is a way to change the world.
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_00: I find that a wealth makes people become lazy much less than one might guess.
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm intrigued to see how you think about this.
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_01: You said all the different ways that it could impact many different verticals there.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_01: And you said we over-hype, you know, doomsday scenarios and everything in between.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_01: And you know, Andre Capatli, you're recently said, AGI will just blend into 2% GDP growth,
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_01: which I thought was sounded a little bit unexciting to be honest, Andrew.
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_01: I wanted some seismic shift in productivity increase.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: Do you think a blend into 2% GDP growth is what you expected?
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_01: Or do you expect a much more significant 5%, 6% like mass or sound at soft bank expires?
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_01: I hope you can get much closer to 5, 6 or more percent GDP growth.
[00:19:56] When looking at the future, it turns out one of the most expensive things into this world is intelligence.
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: This is why it's so expensive, at least in the US, to hire a highly skilled doctor to advise us on the medical condition.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_00: Or a highly skilled tutor to patiently teach our kids, because that intelligence training up that wise doctor,
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_00: wise teacher, wise advisor is very expensive.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_00: But with AI, we finally have a path to make intelligence cheap.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: And so in the future, if everyone can be assisted by an army of smart, well-informed staff on all of these topics under the sun,
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_00: that currently only the relatively wealthy in society can afford to hire people for,
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_00: then individuals will be so much more empowered and able to get so much more done.
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_00: And that highly empowered individual, you know, lies will be so different than the GDP growth will be, will be massive.
[00:20:53] Totally yet, I have an agree.
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_01: Kind of speaking about that democratization of knowledge there and the benefits that come from it.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_01: You said a word before, which was open about the kind of open weights ecosystem we've seen.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_01: We've seen this reversion back to like a closed world in a lot of cases.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_01: How do you feel about the reversion back to a closed?
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_01: And how do you analyze the state of play to day in that open versus closed?
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_01: It's still very dynamic.
[00:21:20] I think it is so for a lot of American companies, the leading frontier model is often cut close.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_00: And then the one tier down model, not quite as good as releases open.
[00:21:31] I think it's much better than nothing.
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm actually grateful for all the teams that are releasing open source open weight models.
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_00: And then the other dynamic is China, especially has been really taking the lead,
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_00: or well, taking a lead or getting up there in terms of releasing tons of really good open weight models.
[00:21:53] So I would say if not, it's kind of not whatever predicted decade ago that China AI would end up being more open than America AI.
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_00: And I think why do you think China is wanting an open AI world?
[00:22:11] It turns out that openness is great for a country's development.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_00: So it turns out that when a team releases open source software, circulation of knowledge is much faster to the close by community.
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_00: And so what I see is when when a team in China releases an open way model, then yes, of course,
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_00: American can take advantage of it.
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_00: But the China economy benefits even more from it.
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_00: Because when something is open, it's easier for teams to call each other and say,
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_00: Hey, buddy, how does this really work?
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_00: I'm having trouble with this model.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_00: It's just that circulation of knowledge is really valuable for innovation.
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_00: And when the US has more close models, and when teams are trying to pay these $100 million salaries to extract talent,
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_00: then that circulation of knowledge becomes very slow and it slows down the rate of American and European innovation.
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_00: With the commoditization of the model there, though, and the opening of it,
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_01: it actually increases the premium on manufacturing and the ability to manufacture at scale,
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_01: which China have a much greater ability to do than US.
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_01: Do you not think that actually leads a lot of that thinking around why they want to remove the strength of US models?
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_01: In addition to increase innovation and circulation of knowledge, which the open way models helps with,
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_00: I think that open way models is a tremendous source of geopolitical influence.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_00: So, for example, if someday, you know, some kid in some developing nation,
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_00: ask a question about a publicly sensitive topic or ask, hey, where are the national borders in this case?
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_00: Or what is the history of this development?
[00:23:58] The country of origin of the model they end up using will be delivering some answer.
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, whether the answer is used towards one nation's values or under the nation's values is actually tremendous source of influence and soft power.
[00:24:16] Like on our open way models are a key part of the AI supply chain and China releasing, you know, free,
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_00: low cost of free models and to that key part supply chain means is really starting to build up a lead, right?
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_00: In build up a commanding user base and that too will be a source of.
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_00: And this is why I think nations with a strong medium entertainment industry, it turns out self-career has vastly proportionate,
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_00: disproportionate influence because of their leading entertainment industry.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_00: So people listen to whatever your k-pop or whatever and that buys the nation a lot of influence.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_00: Hollywood was a tremendous source of soft power for America.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_00: Painters such envision that the American dream talks about the values of freedom and democracy.
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: And I think this is another frontier of communications and soft power.
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_00: You have the most fascinating perspective having obviously spent many years at Google and then obviously by do as well.
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_01: And so having been on both sides of the table in certain respects,
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_01: we have this kind of strange binary polarization of the AI race China versus the US.
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_01: Do you agree with that positioning of China versus the US in an AI race?
[00:25:34] I think there's a lot of room for corporation and then also some places that will be competitive.
[00:25:42] So for us, while people sometimes even me talk about the AI race, there's no single vision that finished line.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_00: It's not one race is AI is a general purpose technology and you could be better aware of
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_00: it coding, better aware of answering questions, better aware of it helping with you know,
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_00: marketers and finance and so on. So AI has many different capabilities and there's no one finish line.
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_00: And even with one capability, I think we're going to keep on improving for a long time.
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_00: So I feel like because of PR goals, AGI has been high type as this is a finish line.
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_00: But I don't think it's a finish line. It's just what have continually improving capabilities for
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_00: you know, decades to come. Having said that nations with stronger AI capabilities are going to be more
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_00: powerful. The citizens will be more prosperous. The economies will grow faster.
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_00: So I think there is so to the extent that different nations and centers are not aligned nations with
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_00: more powerful AI capabilities would be the do more. Just like you know, if a country is a
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_00: fantastic electricity grid in another country, you know, because power villages and so on,
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_00: well, one country can just use electricity grid to do more manufacturing or industrial world.
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_00: Just do a lot more that way. Do you don't think we still underestimate China's ability though?
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I think we definitely do it in Europe, but I think in the US, respectfully, I see a lot of
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: US arrogance around your positioning. And then you go to China and you've been to China and
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_01: spend a huge amounts of time in China, you realize the speed and the intensity with which they move.
[00:27:11] It's a different level to both Europe and the US.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, to be fair, I think US, Europe, China all have problems as well. But having said that,
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: I think the work I think the velocity when China's government makes an all-nation commitment,
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_00: it's all industrial commitment. That's actually a very powerful force with kind of state level
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_00: investments in semiconductors in this education system. So, you know, like K-12 kids being trained
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_00: to use AI, businesses also use AI, share knowledge, and then sometimes, you know, built the stuff
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_00: and also saw internationally with state apparatus that may or may not be the whole. That's actually a
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_00: very, and then a control over rare earth elements. So I think that whole of economy, whole of country
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_00: efforts is actually a very powerful force that I wouldn't underestimate.
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_00: Given that, like, we shouldn't underestimate it, do you think it's right that we have export
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_01: controls on chips? You know, obviously Nvidia has had a lot of export controls back and forth.
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_01: Do you think that's right or not? I think the export control on chips is largely backfire.
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_00: The way that the US, and I think the way the US first put restrictions on Huawei,
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_00: and then later on, you know, exported Nvidia and AMD and other semiconductors that really incentivized
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_00: China. So before the export controls, semiconductor development in China, it was not, frankly,
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_00: wasn't moving that fast. It was a nice area, though, some investment. But when America did that,
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_00: then China really accelerated its semiconductor development. And so America incentivized China
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_00: to do this, and it is paying off a China. I think your number of Chinese companies are
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_00: building offerings that the individual chips are less powerful, but maybe a much larger number
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_00: of chips trying to build offerings competitive with certainly the last generation of Nvidia,
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_00: maybe increasingly the current generation. So I think if I were to analyze just purely, you know,
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_00: US national self-interest, I think that a certain course China to accelerate a semiconductor
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_00: industry in a way that may not be hopeful to the US long term. I sit in Europe, obviously,
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_01: living London, you told me you were born in London before this. My question to you is,
[00:29:38] it transparently feels like we are very far behind. And people say, you've already lost.
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_01: How do you feel about Europe's position in a very new world? And what can Europe do
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_01: to regain some semblance of equality between the US and China?
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_01: If I had one wish for the European regulators, we'll have quite a few European regulators.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_00: I was hearing things like, we want to believe it as in regulating AI and that's a competitive
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_00: advantage. And with all due respect, that's not a competitive advantage. So my one wish for Europe
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_00: is start regulating so much and just focus on investing and building. The thing is,
[00:30:15] it's still early in the days of AI. It's still early in the game. And Europe has plenty of
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_00: smart people, let people work hard. Don't force them to not work hard. Let people that want to work
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_00: hard work hard and start over regulating and just going to invest and build stuff.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_00: Where do we most need to be investing? Where we are not investing enough?
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: There's tons of capital going into data centers and in fraud. We can debate is there a bubble?
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_00: Not we definitely do not lot of investments. Are we, you know, it gets into the point where
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_00: people are using such esoteric financial instruments to find cash for it that there'll be a bubble?
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_00: We could debate that, right? So we definitely do a lot of investments, but when does
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_00: we become over investment? That's a that's an interesting question. The other place that I think
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_00: we need to invest in a lot is not just the in fraud data center foundation model layer,
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_00: but the application layer because of others having spent billions of dollars to train DCI models,
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_00: we can now access them for hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars or whatever for tens of
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_00: dollars. So it's wonderful to build tons of applications that just were not possible before.
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_00: Now, from a VC investment perspective, I heard some multiple VCs is
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_00: the cost of trying something out so low that there are fewer ideas. It's not quite sure where to put
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_00: massive amounts of capital to work at the application layer. In fact, it looked a lot of the
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_00: application layer investments. Sometimes it feels like, you know, firms are putting on a hundred
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_00: million dollars so that they can pay open and in the traffic. So the open and in the traffic can
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_00: be there, which is where all the money is is ending up. Having said that, there's so many valuable
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_00: bets to be placed at the application layer to just build stuff. But the dilemma is you could do
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_00: it in a very capital efficient way. So if someone wants to say, I want to put 10 billion dollars to work,
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_00: you know, yes, you can build 10 billion dollars worth of data centers. We know how to spend that
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_00: money, but how do you spend 10 billion dollars in building applications that the problem is almost,
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_00: it only cost me a million dollars to try an idea out. So how do I spend 10 billion dollars? It's
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_00: kind of a problem and also another problem, but I think we should. It does it because when you look at
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_01: AI margins, what margins for AI application layer companies, they're terrible. They make no money,
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_01: they cost a lot of money to build because you have large engineering teams that build them.
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_01: They don't, they cost more or not less. I think it still varies. I'm seeing a lot of
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_00: re-enchoose of software applications that were not that expensive to build. And if your
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_00: LM token usage is not, you know, the majority of you expense. If you look at a raplet or a
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_01: lovable 80% of that pass through is too anthropic. Yeah. So the dynamic that I'm excited about is,
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_00: it turns out, I think anthropic, I think that as LM token costs continue to come down,
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_00: we'll see how the economics change, right? Right now, LM token, it's just expensive, but
[00:33:33] hopefully that will change and the value created is really large. Actually, you know, I remember
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_00: an earlier era in early days of food delivery, for example, I saw this in both the US and China.
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_00: There's lots of VC subsidized eating, right? You know, it was great. We could eat food delivery.
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_00: It was basically VC subsidized. I think we're seeing that right now with a lot of VC subsidized,
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_00: you know, AI coding. The laws of physics, so the laws of finance says that at some point, right,
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_00: this can't go on forever, but where it settles down will be that I think there will be some very
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_00: valuable businesses that are not perpetually VC subsidized, but navigating this crazy VC subsidy
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_00: world to get a good outcome takes a lot of skill. But having said that, I still want to say,
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_00: the lot of smaller applications that are not yet doing these, you know, hundreds of millions of
[00:34:27] SPEAKER_00: dollars, maybe they're doing millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars of revenue that
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_00: haven't been quite expensive to build into operate. And that I think we'll, we'll see continue
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_00: to grow. Speaking of kind of the smaller niches, so to speak there, that continue to grow,
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_01: how do you think about the question of, you mentioned earlier brilliantly that articulation,
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_01: kind of horizontal, and then the verticals beneath them and Google and now OpenAI being a horizontal,
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_01: how do you think about the question of a world of large monolithic models versus much smaller,
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_01: much more efficient, much more specialized models? How do you think about that? And has your mindset
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_01: changed around which will be more dominant? I think it's good. It'll be all of the above. We
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_00: all have large models and size models and tiny small models. And the reason I'm confident about that
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_00: is because the nature of intelligence is diverse, right? Sometimes we do intellectually really easy
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_00: tasks. Like if someone asked me, I don't know, when, when, oh, like, oh, yesterday, my daughter,
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_00: well, she must spell the word butterfly. So I need to tell her how to spell butterfly. Is it low,
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_00: you know, is it easy intellectual task? And sometimes I'm sitting down thinking for hours about some,
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_00: you know, complex, technical problem, right? And that's, that's really hard. And so intelligence
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_00: has a range of things we want to do. And so the set of things we want AI to do too has a huge
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: range. If you want AI to do basic grammar check and spell checking, you don't need a trillion
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_00: per ounce of model. Use a tiny model, maybe run it locally, just do that. But we wanted to do
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_00: complex reasoning to write a piece of code. Then yes, having a powerful model is going to do better.
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_00: And so I'm actually very confident we'll end up with a huge range of models, small and large,
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_00: to do the huge range of tasks. Just like we have humans do a range of tasks, it's difficult to
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_00: say with AI. Does that mean that you disagree with Andre Kapati when he said that agents,
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_01: useful agents importantly, useful agents are a decade away. I disagree with that. I think we're
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_00: seeing useful agentic workflows right now. So AI fun, our team has built so many agentic workflows
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_00: for so many tasks where, you know, we just could not even do the task, but for agentic workflow.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_00: Can you give me an example I'm fascinated? Over a year ago, we thought that it was actually
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_00: after one of the Biden Trump debates, you know, for better or worse, we thought that
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_00: tariff compliance may become an issue. Maybe unfortunately, we turned out to be right.
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_00: But so last year, I think it was around August, we started building, started exploring building
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_00: technology to help with tariff compliance. And by the way, I don't think you've seen these
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_00: tariff compliance docs, but frankly, when I look at what it takes to follow these, this paper work,
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_00: it makes me wonder, oh my god, what is this? So, you know, you say imported bicycle,
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_00: you know, then you look at the specs of the bicycle, how much does it cost? The size of the wheels,
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_00: there are all these rules and regulations to import the bicycle. It just makes me go, oh my god,
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_00: our humans really doing this. So we built agentic workflows to read the tariff compliance documents
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_00: carefully, get the spec for what someone's employed carefully, try to match mixed suggestions.
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_00: And so this is now one of our portfolio companies called Gaier Gaier Dynamics, that, you know,
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_00: because of the increased complexity in tariff compliance has been doing pretty well, right?
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_00: And so I find that we just could not have done this without agentic workflows. With medical
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_00: assistance, we have different startups, we have a portfolio of companies, medical assistance,
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_00: operating in India, AI assistance, Caledis, you know, helping process legal documents,
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_00: many of these workflows we just could not do. So I find that they're useful AI agentic
[00:38:28] SPEAKER_00: workflows already today. And the large businesses do, not just our startups, when we look at the
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: hyperscalers and I chat to friends in some of our large businesses, there's a bunch of internal
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_00: workflows that, you know, we just could not be doing without these AI agents. When we think about
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_01: the core of a business, it's margins. And most of these business don't have margins.
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_01: Do you care about margins when investing today or with absolute respect and it sounds
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_01: disrespectful? Do you take the kind of utopian view that it will just correct itself with time and
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_01: with efficiency gains? At some point, the laws of physics, I think, or the laws of finance or
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_00: something, margins do matter. But one of the tricky things about AI is, we know the technology is
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_00: going to change. So we don't build, assuming the technology will be stagnant, we do build,
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_00: assuming the technology will evolve. So one, one obvious one, token prices have been rapidly
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_00: falling, right? Depend on who you believe falling 80% year in year or whatever. Kind of,
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_00: frankly, when we build prototypes, we routinely just not worry about token costs because the first
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_00: most important thing is this build a product that uses love. And then what we find is after
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_00: a build something that should happen to me a few times now, we'll build something and not
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: worry about the cost. And then, you know, we use a start to use it. And then our API build starts
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_00: climbing. And then it is really like kind of you're looking at this every few weeks and go,
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_00: well, this game really expensive, this costing me salary of one engineer cost me more than two
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_00: engineers cost me more than a whole bunch of engineers is all right. But fortunately, when that
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_00: has happened, almost every time so far, we've been able to use techniques to bend the cost
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_00: curve back down even faster than the rate at which token prices are falling in the market.
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_00: And so I find that absolutely margins are important. But when you have a view for whether technology
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_00: is going, then it lets you not build for the margins today. But what you can forecast them being
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_00: in the future. And I think that's an important distinction. But we don't take a blind utopian,
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_00: you know, AGI blah blah blah view either. I think that's also overly simplistic.
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_00: How do you think about defensibility in the AI? Well, a lot of people suggest that the time to
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_01: copies reduce significantly. And the defensibility itself is questioned in AI. Do you agree with that
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_01: and the questioning of defensibility today or not? Motes are changing. So I find that motes tend to be
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_00: a function of the industry rather than the function of the technology. So AI as a technology
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_00: doesn't really offer an answer to the motes for most businesses. So if you're building AI,
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_00: you know, for drones or a legal or whatever, the mote is more of a function of that industry.
[00:41:15] But one thing that is changing with regard to motes is previously software used to be a
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_00: mote. Right? If you know, invest it 10 years, the bill of software is really hard to replicate that.
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_00: That one mote is much weaker than before. But other motes like are you trying to use AI to
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_00: accelerate to build a two-sided marketplace, which can be very defensible or, you know,
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_00: are you building for a consumer morphicals who are enterprise? Are there any brand and
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_00: reputation all the effects? Right? They can help you build defensibility there. So I find that
[00:41:47] the software mote has changed, but other motes tend to be analysis based on the industry.
[00:41:52] So software motes have changed. Fantastic. And so we now have margins that matter,
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_01: but we have a little bit more elasticity there. The software mote has changed in terms of like
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_01: the ability to stay relevant for large enterprises. What are the single biggest barriers that
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_01: are preventing large enterprises from implementing AI aggressively and prevent themselves being
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_01: extinct? I think it's very, most large enterprises
[00:42:22] SPEAKER_00: is actually people and change management. Not data. It's not data. I think it's definitely not
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_00: data. Not the data is not important, but that's definitely not the bottleneck. I think data has been
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_00: data. So the interesting thing about AI hype is there's almost always a gem of truth in the hype.
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_00: It's just that it's been hyped up, you know, 10 times more than the reality. And maybe actually,
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_00: let me give one example. That would come back to data. There's been this buzz about, oh, with AI,
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_00: we'll have unicorns with one employee, right? It's like a thing. And it's fine. If you want to build
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_00: a unicorn starter, put in dollar with one employee girlfriend, it's a good thing to do. But frankly,
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_00: if you're doing it, if you're a billion dollar valuation, you could afford to pay two employees
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_00: or even 10. So why do you need to hype it all the way up to say, let's do this with just one
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_00: employee, right? So that it is true that team size is our shrinking. We'll get more done with smaller
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_00: teams. So that is true. But the hype is then saying, let's build a unicorn with one starter.
[00:43:22] SPEAKER_00: I find that a lot of AI hype is so hard to disentangle because there's a gem of truth in it. It's just
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_00: been hyped up a lot more. So on data, data is important. But it turns out that data is very verticalized.
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_00: And you don't need as much of it to get started as you want. And as you think. So for example, you
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_00: know, landing AI does a lot of work with financial institutions, healthcare, a lot of financial
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_00: institutions that plenty of transactions are, you know, take the PDF file, turn it to own,
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_00: ready, mock down, text, go process that, find value in that. Like for example, I don't know, we could
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_00: take a SEC followings large complex financial tables, very accurately turn those financial tables
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_00: into Excel spreadsheets, then go get your analysts or AI to analyze that and draw conclusions. So you
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_00: could do that. So often with the strappiness, looking internal data, looking at your public data,
[00:44:21] SPEAKER_00: you can often get some stuff going. And it turns out that a lot of internet data is kind of general
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_00: purpose data. Most of the world's data is actually private, right? And then so a lot of businesses
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_00: actually are very valuable transaction data, you know, sales data, product data, manufacturing
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_00: data, logistics data, and all that data with a strappy team that knows how to use it can actually
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_00: start to build something, get value of it. Not to say more data wouldn't be even better, but you're not
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_00: stuck to even take the first few steps on that data. And you're, I speak to many CEOs of these
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_01: size businesses and they say, Harry, are you kidding me? You think we can get security and
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: permissioning for our data and our enterprise? No, we don't have Slack, we don't have notion,
[00:45:08] SPEAKER_01: everything is custom built. You know, you're seeing the likes of JP Morgan Goldman Sachs,
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_01: absolutely refuse any chat GPT building internal systems. Is that the world that we inhabit for
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_01: enterprise AI adoption? I think we get there. So I find that a lot of enterprises are adopting
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_00: OM's, you know, CHIGBIA, many others. I think today there's still businesses that are still on
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_00: prem rather than on the cloud, but we're making progress and it'll take actually one thing about AI,
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_00: did this height that we have AGI in two years or whatever, I think that's just for the, that's just
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_00: I, I, for most visual definition of AGI, that's just not going to happen. And just as how long I'll be
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_00: now into the cloud era, but we still have an awful lot of on prem jobs. I think that AI adoption,
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_00: it will be wonderful. There will be tremendous GPT growth is also going to take much longer than
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_00: the hype says it will. I actually think that a decade from now, we will still be working to
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_00: identify valuable applications in enterprises and building them. Having said that, we will make a lot
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_00: of progress over the next one or two years, but we're not going to be done, you know, even 10 years
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_00: from now. What else does everyone think they know about AI? And it's adoption and implementation
[00:46:26] that they get wrong? Even earlier this year, we saw some senior business leaders advise people to
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_00: not learn to cope on the grounds that AI will automate it. We'll look back on that as some of the
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_00: worst career advice ever given. As coding becomes easier with AI assisting us, a lot more people
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_00: should learn to code, not fewer. And I'm already seeing, I mentioned the mark for the example,
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_00: just now we're bugging it up for feedback, swiping. But I think for a lot of job functions, people that
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_00: know how to tell computer exactly what they wanted to do, so the computer can do it for you,
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_00: they'll just be more powerful. And for the foreseeable future, the language of precisely telling
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_00: computers what you wanted to do is coding. It doesn't mean you should write code by hand.
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_00: Write thing code by hand is becoming obsolete, right? You don't really don't do that, not,
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_00: but they get AI to write code for you. And people can do that, it would be more effective and
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_00: more powerful and more fun. If we're that early, where a decade's time, we're still going to be
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_01: looking and identifying areas where it can improve meaningfully, do we have enough money to
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_01: fund both the energy and the compute requirements for that 10-year period? Sam Altman has said he
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_01: needs a trillion dollars, he needs the energy of Japan. If we're 10 years out before we have,
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_01: still not that much improvement, do we have the money to fund it?
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_01: I think we'll see plenty of improvement over the next two years. But I think we still won't be
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_00: done getting even more improvements 10 years from now. One place where super promising is AI
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_00: system coding. So we're seeing real productivity gains, real returns. It's really changing the way
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_00: software is written. It's really been fantastic. Frankly, selling me with my friends is just
[00:48:15] SPEAKER_00: calling so much more fun with AI to help us out than with our, so we are seeing returns just
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_00: be clear. But we still won't be done growing this 10 years from now. But if you look at the
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_01: term, the secret success in AI investing is will we see a transition from software budgets to
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_01: human, from human labor budgets, sorry, to software budgets? And if we have that, then holy grail,
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_01: me and you will make a lot of money with our funds and fantastic news because the terms have
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_01: massively increased or the spends massively increased. If we're like, hey, we're not going to
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_01: actually lose any people, then actually we don't see that transition from human labor budget to
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_01: software. Do you think we won't see that transition? So to me, the question is, is AI mostly for
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_00: cost savings or is it for growth? And I know that it's difficult to change work for those. A lot of
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_00: companies tend to think cost savings, but maybe here's the problem. Does actually one pattern I see,
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_00: let's say I have a work task that has five steps. And let's say each step takes 20% of my effort.
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_00: Maybe I'm underwriting approvals. Do I prove this low? No, no, no. Let's say for simplicity,
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_00: five steps, each six, 20% of my effort. If you can automate one of those steps,
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: is a 20% cost savings. It could be great if you're a low margin business, but it doesn't feel
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_00: like a game changer. So what I find is that the more valuable users of AI, it actually requires,
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_00: it often requires rethinking that workflow. And the pattern I see is instead of taking a 20%
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_00: cost savings, which you could do, that's fine, nothing wrong with that. The two patterns to then
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_00: getting growth is, it's either do more or do it faster. So in the case of underwriting,
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: making loans, if instead of saving 20% of my human labor, if I can now rework the workflow
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_00: to turn around my disease making time. So instead of someone needing to wait two weeks before
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_00: loan officer looks at it, but we can just give you an initial answer in 10 minutes. That changes
[00:50:21] SPEAKER_00: the product unless you drive growth. So that's a faster pattern. And then there's also the more pattern.
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_00: So another example, there are a lot of businesses that could do high touch, you know, say cost
[00:50:34] SPEAKER_00: for service only for expensive high-end clients, right? But if you can now serve a much larger group
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_00: of people, or let's say financial advice instead of giving high-touch financial advice to small
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_00: group of people, if we can now deliver that closer service a lot more people, then that can
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_00: change the product unless you drive growth. So instead of cost savings, if AI lets you do something
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_00: way faster, or lets you take a toss and do it a thousand times more instead of serving a small
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_00: number of people, let's serve a lot more people because it's not economic to do so. These are the
[00:51:06] SPEAKER_00: two patterns I've seen to drive value increases. And I think that would be important for unlocking
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_00: GVG growth. You said economic to do so. Do you think it's crucial that we see vertical ownership
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_01: in terms of, see, Nvidia own models as well as chip player? And we're seeing Facebook build out
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_01: data centers more than anyone. We're seeing everyone build out data centers. Is it important that we
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_01: own every layer of the stack? Or actually, will we see individual participants own horizontal
[00:51:37] SPEAKER_01: list of the stack? I think this will evolve over time. I'm going to make an analogy. In the early days
[00:51:43] SPEAKER_00: of say the computing industry, it was a vertical player set one because if you want to connect the
[00:51:51] SPEAKER_00: keyboard to your computer motherboard, which is a CPU, is it okay if your keyboard has a plus
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_00: minus five volts and your CPU has some other voltage? Is that okay or not? So we didn't know where
[00:52:03] SPEAKER_00: the API boundaries or if your CPU has memory later in a certain way, a compute and your
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_00: math accelerator, they needed to interoperate with each other. So before we wound up having a clear
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_00: conception of where they draw lines and whether the API boundaries, the integrated players, IBM
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_00: back in the day, could solve all the problems and build valuable working products. But as the
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_00: industry mature, we started to stand as like, for example, now we're the USB standard before
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_00: they were other standards. So now you make a computer, sometimes makes the keyboard, we plug them
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_00: together and it all works. So when the industry is in mature, it turns out where to draw those
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_00: boundaries so that different participants do their part and have a slow interoperate. That's less
[00:52:50] SPEAKER_00: clear. But then as the industry matureness and this your more standards for ever want to publish
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_00: and compress our model on the internet, what's the foul format for that? You're starting to see
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_00: more standards then that makes it easier for kind of individual players to do something and still
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_00: have it fit into the broader ecosystem. So do you think then like Zuck and Sam are right to be
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_01: spending as much as they are on data centers or should they be patient and wait for the maturation
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_01: of the industry where they can then be horizontal? I think the open eyes investments have paid off
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_00: to date. It is possible to over invest at some point but I don't know if that is the point and then
[00:53:29] SPEAKER_00: I think also the financial instruments being used by many players to shift risks around have
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_00: been really interesting. I find that overly complex user financial instruments to shift risks
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_00: is sometimes increases the risks of there being a bubble at some point. So that's something to
[00:53:51] SPEAKER_00: watch out for. Do you worry about the circular deals? It's something to keep an eye on. I'm not
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_00: alarmed by them but it is, I think things could be more frappier, less frappier, things could be
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_00: more of a bubble and less of a bubble and these are signs of things feeling a little bit more
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_00: bubble-ish. When does a sign turn into a big concern for you with these? I think you mentioned
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_00: the sequer article on the 600-Billion dollar problem of AI. I am concerned about that but
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_00: essentially my concern for different layers of the stack is different. So what I'm seeing is for
[00:54:28] SPEAKER_00: the application layer there is very clear ROI. I think it's fantastic because someone else trained
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_00: these models who can build applications for you know $100,000 or a million dollars inside
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_00: the ROI. Then I think it is calibrating to the right level of infrastructure investment
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_00: that is tricky. But having said that, it is also the same time very clear that we do need more
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_00: let's see more data centers and more semiconductors. That too is very clear. So we should be investing
[00:54:55] SPEAKER_00: a lot and I'm glad we are. But what exactly is the right amount to invest? I think that's the tricky
[00:55:03] SPEAKER_00: question. It should be a lot though. Do you get annoyed by the bubble discussion? I don't get
[00:55:08] SPEAKER_00: annoyed by the bubble discussion. I do get annoyed by the hype. When regulators are calling me up and
[00:55:15] SPEAKER_00: say hey we heard AI could lead to human extinction. Thankfully much less than that now than a couple
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_00: years ago. Instead it comes in should be how we upscaled the workforce, where can we invest?
[00:55:26] SPEAKER_00: Not like how do we slow this thing down? I think the hype has really distorted public perception of
[00:55:32] SPEAKER_00: AI. One downside of the hype too is without public support of AI, things slow down. So for example
[00:55:41] SPEAKER_00: one of my friends works a lot with high school students and he told me that he was talking to a girl
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_00: high school student that was that he was talking to her about maybe pursue a career in AI. And she
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_00: said you know what? I heard AI could have something to do human extinction. I don't want to have
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_00: anything to do with that. And so this hype turned a high school girl away from working on AI
[00:56:06] SPEAKER_00: at a time where it'd be so promising for them to leap into AI. And I think this really causes people
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_00: to make weird decisions both at the individual school student level as well as at the community level
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_00: where when the community shuts down building other data center they could be good for the community
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_00: and good for the world. I think that's also unfortunate. I'd love to move to a quick fire round
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_01: where I say a short statement but kind of staying on that thread because the first question is
[00:56:34] SPEAKER_01: what's your biggest advice to educational institutions to make sure they equip students
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_01: for a generation of AI? Embrace it, update curricula, teach them as much AI as possible. Students
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_00: are going to live in a world where they will be using AI and having a hold of them.
[00:56:53] Got to teach students to do that. I think it'll be different for different fields but one thing
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_00: that is clear is get all your students to learn to code. What's one thing you've changed your mind
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_01: about AI in the last 12 to 18 months? I think my favorite tool is Q-changing. If you ask me
[00:57:09] SPEAKER_00: you know every three months over the last year what my favorite coding tool is my answer
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_00: with a kept on changing. Do you think Anthropic will beat OpenAI in the coding wars?
[00:57:19] SPEAKER_01: Really hard to say. OpenAI has a very strong consumer brand and that's very defensible.
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_00: In contrast, developers are more likely to switch coding tools on the dime. I love Cloud Cloud
[00:57:32] SPEAKER_00: and it's fantastic but I find myself using OpenAI codecs much more over the last month.
[00:57:38] SPEAKER_00: I think OpenAI codecs is actually getting real momentum and then I'm also keeping an eye on
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_00: Gemini CLI which I think is also getting better maybe that faster rate than people I've given
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_00: them credit for. So the coding dev tools and API tools market the mode is weaker than having a
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_00: strong consumer brand so I think that's something that companies have to sort out. Tell me what
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_01: was your biggest takeaway from Baidu? It's such a different company to anything that we used to
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_01: in the West. What was your biggest takeaway? I really appreciated the speed and intensity of
[00:58:13] SPEAKER_00: Baidu and also of the China ecosystem. I think it's really unfortunate that in some parts of the
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_00: United States advising someone to work hard is viewed as publicly incorrect or something.
[00:58:29] SPEAKER_01: In Europe, I'm chastised for it. Oh okay, all right. Hopefully the European viewers won't
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_00: hate me or hate us both for that. I think frankly, I wish people would work
[00:58:41] SPEAKER_00: for us a week and be wildly successful but the practical reality is when people work hard they get
[00:58:48] SPEAKER_00: more done. Now I want to acknowledge that not everyone in every point of their life is in the
[00:58:52] SPEAKER_00: position of work hard. So the week after my kids were born, I didn't work that hard. It took time
[00:58:58] SPEAKER_00: off, spent time with the kids for more than a week but I think we need to respect people in all
[00:59:03] SPEAKER_00: walks of life, including people that for whatever reason are not in the position of work hard at that
[00:59:07] SPEAKER_00: moment. But if someone wants to work hard, go, you know, quote, Steve Jobs, make a dent in the
[00:59:12] SPEAKER_00: universe, let's empower them and celebrate that. If someone for whatever situation can't work hard,
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_00: let's also respect that and maybe celebrate that. But I think this is a moment in time where
[00:59:25] SPEAKER_00: there's so much stuff we could build. People that work hard to learn a lot and build things
[00:59:30] SPEAKER_00: will accomplish a lot. Did you do 996? The term 996 wasn't an explicit term that I use.
[00:59:39] SPEAKER_00: I find that right these days I work, you know, I just, I really love what I do, really doesn't feel
[00:59:46] SPEAKER_00: like work but, you know, I would, on a lot of my weekends, I'm sitting in a coffee shop
[00:59:52] SPEAKER_00: coding away because it's the most fun thing I could do in a Saturday. So I actually don't bother
[00:59:57] SPEAKER_00: to keep track of my hours. I was probably a lot. Was the hardest transition element moving from
[01:00:04] SPEAKER_01: operator to investor? Oh, one thing about AI fund. Yes, we call ourselves a fund, but frankly,
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_00: the way we run the fund day to day, we act much more like operators than investors.
[01:00:17] AI funds adventure studio and I believe our skill set is actually building not just in,
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_00: you know, capital asset allocation or whatever. So we work really hard to screen ideas. We talk to
[01:00:28] SPEAKER_00: customers, you know, I'm sometimes on customer calls myself. And then we bring and found this,
[01:00:34] SPEAKER_00: the work alongside us, we're reviewing the product, giving feedback on the product,
[01:00:38] SPEAKER_00: arguing about pricing. So where my day to day life is much more operator. And yes,
[01:00:43] SPEAKER_00: eventually we have to do the financial diligence and so I really check and do follow on. We do all
[01:00:47] SPEAKER_00: that a lot more. I'm really sorry, Angie, then you are fun, are you an incubator?
[01:00:53] So we call ourselves a venture studio or venture builder. The term we don't incubators usually
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_00: bring in founders that already have an idea. We go earlier than that. We often work of our
[01:01:07] SPEAKER_00: investors and partners to come with an idea. And only after we have an idea, then we go and try
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_00: to find the best founder to co-build, to co-founder company with us. So we don't call those
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_00: incubators. How much ownership do you have them when you make those original investments and
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_01: seed the company? Depends. We end up with some common stock for the SWET equity building
[01:01:30] SPEAKER_00: the company. And then we usually, our first check-in is usually like a million dollars and a
[01:01:36] SPEAKER_00: four million dollar cap. So kind of 20% ownership or safe. And so we're basically getting 20 to 25%
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_01: ownership on entry with a couple of common. Yeah, plus some common for the SWET equity.
[01:01:50] SPEAKER_00: Totally, yeah, you. What do you think is the biggest? To me, but to me, the reason we do this is
[01:01:55] SPEAKER_00: because I find that while there are VCs that do the competitive deal flow thing, the
[01:02:00] SPEAKER_00: middle of many that way, I think my team's biggest contributions is not fighting over hard deals.
[01:02:06] SPEAKER_00: It is finding ideas and creating companies that will not exist, but for the fact that we
[01:02:11] SPEAKER_00: and have founded got together to co-founder together. So I think we just dream of value in the world
[01:02:17] SPEAKER_00: by creating new companies rather than only discovering hot companies to try to, you know,
[01:02:23] SPEAKER_00: put money into. What concerns you most today, Andrew? I love your optimism and your
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_01: open-mindedness. What concerns you on the flip side? The difficulty of bringing everyone along with us.
[01:02:35] SPEAKER_00: In previous ways of economic disruption, like when our nations went from
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_00: mini agriculture to non-agriculture, someone that was a farmer could keep farming until they
[01:02:46] SPEAKER_00: retire, but the kids had to learn the different trade, maybe with the city or whatever.
[01:02:50] SPEAKER_00: The change is so fast this time round that we need people that are alive today to learn new
[01:02:56] SPEAKER_00: schools, as opposed to we need their kids to learn new schools. And that's actually very challenging
[01:03:01] SPEAKER_00: and historically, I don't think we've ever been good at that. You do a lot of interviews, Andrew.
[01:03:06] SPEAKER_01: You speak to many journalists, I'm not a journalist, I've never actually had a job.
[01:03:10] SPEAKER_01: Do you find the quality of interviewers that ask you questions good?
[01:03:16] I think media has an important role to play to curate into silly knowledge.
[01:03:21] I think the quality of questions the reporters are asking has been very clearly trending up
[01:03:27] SPEAKER_00: over time, but there's still the hype element of it that keeps on distorting the information
[01:03:33] SPEAKER_00: ecosystem. Unfortunately, there are financial incentives and your regulatory capture,
[01:03:38] SPEAKER_00: legislative benefit types of incentives, certain types of help, certain types of hype.
[01:03:44] SPEAKER_00: And it does actually went back to the last scene, I won't name any companies.
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_00: But I find that companies with something to lose, whose statements over time have become
[01:03:54] SPEAKER_00: more moderated. So I find that as your established company, you just say more sensible things,
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_00: but there are some companies that I think are a greater existential risk.
[01:04:05] SPEAKER_00: And I find those companies, some of those companies that don't want to name to be the worst
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_00: sources of hype because we've got less to lose, let's just say a bunch of random stuff.
[01:04:15] SPEAKER_01: In many respects, it's a lashing out in desperation, I think. When you look at a dammit, say,
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_01: obviously, brilliant leader, when you look at Assam even or Dario, all of them, I think,
[01:04:25] SPEAKER_01: have moderated their position significantly with the maturing of their companies.
[01:04:31] No comment on individuals, but I think that when you're something to lose, you say more sensible
[01:04:36] SPEAKER_00: things, but when your company faces greater existential risks, sometimes people say weird things
[01:04:42] SPEAKER_00: for fundraising. I like to finish on a tone of optimism. What single thing are you most excited
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_01: for when you look forward to the next decade? So for me, for example, my mother's got amass,
[01:04:54] SPEAKER_01: I think we'll have incredible medical discoveries in some diseases that we haven't really
[01:04:59] SPEAKER_01: made much advancements in for years. That excites me. What excites you?
[01:05:05] Yeah, I'm sorry, I hear about your mother. Thank you.
[01:05:07] What excites me? I want to impart everyone to Bill of AI.
[01:05:12] I think the distance between you having an idea and building it is now much shorter.
[01:05:19] SPEAKER_00: And we need not just software engineers to be creating. So in the future, I hope that a lot of people
[01:05:26] SPEAKER_00: instead of saying, is there an app for that? They'll say, I built an app for that.
[01:05:32] SPEAKER_00: And instead of just being a software user, there'll be a software creator, and we can get there,
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_00: then people all around the world will be much more empowered, get more done, have more fun.
[01:05:43] SPEAKER_00: Andrew, this has been such a joy to do. Thank you so much for putting up with my pride and my
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_01: pressing. You've been amazing and I really appreciate the time. Now, I really enjoy your shows.
[01:05:53] SPEAKER_00: Those are the privilege to be here, party.
