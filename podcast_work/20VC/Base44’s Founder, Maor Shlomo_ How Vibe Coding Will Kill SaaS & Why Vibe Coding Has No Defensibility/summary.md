# Podcast Summary: Maor Shlomo (Base 44 Founder) on 20VC

## 1. Key Themes

### The Vibe Coding Category Will Become the Largest Software Category

Maor believes that vibe coding (AI-powered software development) will eclipse traditional SaaS categories. His thesis is that existing categories like CRM, support systems, and project management will "fold into the vibe coding category." He predicts a future where "it will be easier to build your own Salesforce type of CRM than to actually buy a license to something off the shelf" [[00:05:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=5m31s). This isn't just about technical users - he argues that small businesses specifically will want simpler, more customized solutions without feature bloat, with their own data and code.

"Every software company that needs implementers... maybe in a decade from now is not going to make it. Because software... you'll get to a place where a lot of the current organizational tools that companies are using, you could build your own version or customize your own version" [[00:07:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=7m40s). The key insight is that software will become "more liquid" - you'll start with templates or open source projects and customize them through prompting rather than dealing with one-size-fits-all solutions.

### Strategic Partnership Over Independent Scaling Was the Right Path

Maor sold Base 44 to Wix for $80 million when it had only millions in revenue, facing a critical junction. He could either continue bootstrapped and risk being "eaten by companies that are raising like shit tons of money," raise substantial funding himself, or find a parent company [[00:02:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1m58s). The Wix partnership solved a fundamental problem: "The marketing team is the absolute, in my opinion, very, in my very not objective eyes is the best in the market. They're just aggressive, they're creative, they're absolutely awesome" [[00:03:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=3m15s).

The deal was structured to keep Base 44 "lean, small and startup-y" while leveraging Wix's infrastructure for support, marketing, legal, and operations [[00:03:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=3m37s). Crucially, Maor negotiated financial compensation tied to revenue targets and milestones, so he benefits from the post-acquisition growth that has taken Base 44 to over $100 million in revenue [[00:05:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=5m0s). He maintains "absolutely not" regretting the sale because "this was the whole point... to take a shot at building something that would be huge" [[00:05:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=5m14s).

### Model Provider Dynamics Create Unprecedented Market Volatility

The ease of switching between AI model providers represents a radical departure from traditional infrastructure markets. Maor describes how "in a split second like you change one string in the code and you move like millions in spend to a different provider" [[00:25:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=25m19s). This creates "insane market dynamics" where provider revenue can shift dramatically overnight based on which model is currently best.

"What let's say one of them kind of like stands ahead for like six months... what happens to anthropic revenue right like... switch from all the Cursors and the Claude codes let's say you switch to Gemini or whatever GPT 5.5... this is like such a fast decline but also they had such a fast ascent" [[00:29:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=29m16s). Unlike cloud providers where switching is painful and takes years, LLM switching is trivial. Base 44 constantly optimizes which models to use for different tasks - "Sonnet's like the best designer... but what we found is that like GPT-5... really good at solving hard bugs" [[00:26:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=26m15s).

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Most Software Will Be Built, Not Bought Within a Decade

Maor takes the radical position that traditional SaaS vendors selling one-size-fits-all solutions are doomed. "Salesforce will be bigger or smaller in 10 years time... I think generally from this category, those companies would be smaller. If not like some of them would be eliminated" [[00:11:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=10m58s). He specifically predicts "smaller CRM companies, every software that's basically flaunted on top of a database with some team features and some integrations and does not have a moat" will be eliminated [[00:11:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=11m18s).

The counterintuitive element is his belief this applies even to small businesses who supposedly don't care about owning code and data. He rebuts this directly: "Not necessarily the code and data, but they need something that's simpler and more customized to their needs" [[00:09:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=8m54s). His personal experience trying to set up existing tools for his wife's tattoo business convinced him that "an LLM can code something linear and way better for what she needs, exactly what she needs" without enterprise features and bloat [[00:10:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=9m50s).

### Margin Concerns in AI Applications Are Overblown

While most investors obsess over AI application margins and model costs, Maor dismisses these concerns: "From all things in the industry, I think the margins are the least things that I'm worried about" [[00:00:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=0s). His reasoning has multiple layers. First, "we're taking into consideration that the prices of model will go down to zero at least for tools like Base 44" [[00:30:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=30m15s), so optimizing current costs is less important than growth.

Second, margins are "very decision dependent" - you can change from low to high margin with "just one decision" about service quality [[00:31:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=31m10s). Third, intelligent routing to cheaper models for simple tasks will dramatically improve margins: "change the color of the button from blue to red right I don't really need to use like the heavy sonnet maximum thinking" [[00:32:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=31m53s). Finally, he points to Cursor's strategy of growing fast with expensive models then releasing their own efficient model (Composer) as a blueprint for overnight margin transformation [[00:44:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=43m53s).

### Winner-Take-All Dynamics Don't Apply to AI Coding

Contrary to typical venture capital thinking, Maor argues the vibe coding category will support multiple large winners: "I don't think our notion from the previous age of venture capital of winner takes it all is wrong and I think this category is going to be so big that everybody will take a niche at some point" [[00:55:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=55m42s). When asked to choose between investing in Cursor at $29.3B or Cognition at $12B, he chose Cognition because "betting on Cursor is like betting that it's a winner takes it all market" [[00:56:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=56m3s).

He supports this with evidence: "If you look at all of my competitors and on base 44 we're all growing insanely fast and I think at least I can say about base 44 but maybe the other players like healthy businesses those are going to generate huge returns" [[00:56:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=56m37s). The venture model works on "huge returns" not necessarily winner-take-all dynamics. His confidence in entering an already competitive market stemmed from believing "this is going to be such a big market" with room for differentiated approaches [[00:57:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=56m55s).

## 3. Companies Identified

### **Cursor/Anysphere**

**Description:** AI-powered code editor that integrates LLM assistance directly into the development workflow, focused on professional developers

**Why mentioned:** Discussed as the dominant player in the pro developer segment. Maor uses Cursor internally for Base 44's own backend development and sees them executing a brilliant strategy by releasing their own Composer model to improve margins after capturing distribution.

**Quotes:** "For us and maybe 50% because they have like legacy code and systems for us base 44 was built in the region of LLM... for us it's already closer to 90% like mostly like prompting agents" [[00:55:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=55m28s). When comparing Cursor and Cognition: "I think cognition is going to grow have like more room to grow. I also know that like for our time they'll be able to either replicate the most successful features inside" [[00:56:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=55m57s).

### **Wix**

**Description:** Public website building platform that acquired Base 44 for $80M and provides infrastructure, marketing, and operational support

**Why mentioned:** Praised extensively as the ideal strategic partner with best-in-class marketing, aggressive growth mindset, and focus on product excellence over competitor obsession.

**Quotes:** "The marketing team is the absolute, in my opinion, very, in my very not objective eyes is the best in the market. They're just aggressive, they're creative, they're absolutely awesome" [[00:03:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=3m15s). "Wix for many years was like the underdog... wix's mindset is just like build a great product find the right way to market it doesn't matter what others do" [[01:02:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h2m26s). On valuation: "My very not objective opinion is that wix is very much undervalued today" [[01:01:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h1m30s).

### **Replit**

**Description:** Cloud-based coding platform that started developer-focused and has evolved toward enabling semi-technical users to build applications

**Why mentioned:** Acknowledged as a strong competitor in the vibe coding space, though Maor sees them as more technical than Base 44's target market.

**Quotes:** "Replit is more technical than started as a dev tool and the thing for developers they're doing a good job for the semi-developers" [[00:23:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=23m20s). He mentions their autonomous agent approach: "One of the players that you mentioned for example is doing a really good job with autonomy well kind of like you prompt something and then they go and they run for like 20 minutes or 30 minutes" [[00:33:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=33m1s).

### **Lovable**

**Description:** AI-powered application builder competing in the vibe coding space, recently valued at $6 billion

**Why mentioned:** Cited as a major competitor and example of the rapid growth in the category. Maor respects their European origin and viral success.

**Quotes:** When asked who he doesn't worry about: "I'm not worried about those three [Lovable, Replit, Bolt]" [[00:23:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=23m40s). "I think I have a lot of like great things to say about loveable building it from Europe I think the world is changing" [[01:05:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h4m52s). Regarding their $6B valuation vs Wix: "I'm not sure if a lovable or replit is overvalued I think to be able to say that I need to look at the internals and the economics of those businesses" [[01:02:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h1m53s).

### **Salesforce**

**Description:** Enterprise CRM and cloud software giant, used as the primary example of traditional SaaS that may be disrupted

**Why mentioned:** Central to Maor's thesis about software categories being disrupted by customizable AI-built alternatives, though he acknowledges their resources to adapt.

**Quotes:** "At some point... it will be easier to build your own Salesforce type of CRM than to actually buy a license to something off the shelf" [[00:05:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=5m36s). "Salesforce is so big and so massive that this is like this is one of their modes. Like they can make big bets and like move a lot of stuff... when we're all trying to adapt in this AI era. But smaller players think would be eliminated" [[00:11:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=11m28s).

## 4. People Identified

### **Avishai Abrahami (CEO of Wix)**

**Description:** Co-founder and CEO of Wix, led the acquisition negotiations with Maor

**Why mentioned:** Praised for strategic vision and creating the right partnership structure. Maor credits conversations with Avishai for convincing him to sell rather than remain independent.

**Quotes:** "I remember telling Avishai like if Kelsa was sold to Microsoft, probably the one being Kelsa today. The fact that they were independent and they could build the business, buy themselves how they wanted without kind of like the corporate stuff has gotten them full" [[00:02:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=2m31s). "We had many late night chats where one understood that Wix for a lot of reasons... is a perfect match because we're targeting the same audience. It's the same spirit" [[00:03:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=2m53s).

### **Jack Dorsey**

**Description:** Founder of Twitter and Square, known for building multiple successful companies and ongoing experiments with protocols and new technologies

**Why mentioned:** Named as Maor's dream board member for his builder mindset and long-term strategic thinking.

**Quotes:** "Jack Dorsey... I think he's one of the most brilliant minds and founders and he can see that consistently he builds things sometimes for just the sake of building... building Twitter or building Square building other projects like that's just a mindset of a builder that I think can add tremendous futuristic strategic thinking" [[01:12:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h12m19s). "The already an and the thing that we're trying to build in base 44 is like a builder mindset and I think this is the like the ultimate for me the ultimate guy" [[01:13:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h12m51s).

### **Vlad Tenev (CEO of Robinhood)**

**Description:** Co-founder and CEO of Robinhood, mentioned for their AI adoption metrics

**Why mentioned:** Used as data point showing mainstream tech companies already having 50% of code written by AI, validating the rapid shift happening.

**Quotes:** "I had Vlad Tenev from Robinhood on the show they said 50% of their code is written with AI what will that be in two years 95% or 100% for sure" [[01:05:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h5m10s). Maor responds: "For us base 44 was built in the region of LLM since the rise structure the repository in a way that's going to be very easy for LLM to navigate through... for us it's already closer to 90%" [[01:05:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h5m34s).

## 5. Operating Insights

### Build for Your Own Problems as the Ultimate Product Hack

Maor identifies solving his own problems as "the biggest hack of like how you actually build something that later on you'll use or maybe be successful." Base 44 started when his wife needed a CRM for her tattoo and art teaching business. They tried existing drag-and-drop tools from unnamed vendors and "it was hell, no" [[00:09:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=9m32s). 

"I like a software person, right? I should know how to do that. But like just configuring that and then making it so that it supports her process of how she processes leads and customers... I was like, I know that like an LLM can code something linear and way better for what she needs, exactly what she needs" [[00:09:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=9m38s). This personal pain point led to the entire company's existence and ensured product-market fit from day one. He explicitly states: "This is not something I want to go back into doing something that's like for a customer that I interview a lot and understand the pain points is what's so much fun building base 44" [[01:06:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h6m39s).

### Embrace Throwaway Code to Accelerate Product Iteration

A critical mindset shift for non-technical users is understanding that code is cheap and disposable in the AI era. "There's a mindset that you have to get into which is base 44 is not really a person that's like working for a week and getting back to you... you have to get into a mindset that's like very easy it's very easy to revert or start from scratch" [[01:07:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h7m7s).

Instead of creating detailed PRDs upfront, "build the first version that you know you're going to throw out and for some people it's like emotionally hard to understand like they're going to throw out like tens of thousands of lines of codes... but like all you need is like figure out the product stuff because once you have the product stuff it's like with a few prompts you get to where you like you got to with like hundreds of prompts or thousands of prompts" [[01:07:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h7m33s). The lesson: optimize for learning what you want, not preserving code. "Very easily hitting the revert button when one feature you wanted and you played with it's like not something that engage your point... iterate very fast" [[01:08:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=1h8m0s).

### Measure Sentiment of User Messages as Success Proxy

Rather than traditional metrics alone, Base 44 measures "the sentiment of the messages they send in the chat" because "many people are like speaking with the chat as they would to a human they either tell you okay a fantastic job this is exactly what I wanted... or they cancel out like this is not what I want to know you deleted this button" [[00:37:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=37m39s).

This metric operates in real-time: "We have this metric that we literally measure on a minute to minute basis of like how many of the prompts because nowadays we get like tens of thousands of ones like a minute or whatever... we measure the sentiment and that's how we know how coding agent does what it's being asked to" [[00:38:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=37m57s). When they release updates, "if we release an app blade you see this negativity metric kind of goes down or if when we jump from Sonnet 4 to Sonnet 4.5 you see a major improvement there" [[00:38:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=38m17s). The metrics themselves evolve: "When we started it was mostly around bugs... nowadays it's more about does the agent actually does what is being asking of it" [[00:38:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=38m42s).

### Take Strategic Bets That Are Difficult to Replicate

In a market where "every feature that we put out we know that's going to take either a few weeks or few months for competitor to copy" [[00:34:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=33m58s), Maor focuses on "taking big bets on things that are substantial to your users and will be really hard to copy" [[00:34:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=34m24s). 

The prime example is Base 44's built-in backend: "The whole reason for base 44's existence is the built-in backend, the fact that we built base 44 as a fully overtly integrated platform where for every application you already have a built-in database user management authentication integrations analytics and so on and the thing is that we didn't use a third party provider like Supabase which is what the rest of the industry is using" [[00:34:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=34m39s). This decision was "very courageous" and creates a moat: "This is going to be very hard to replicate and very hard to migrate your whatever millions of users from one from Supabase to a homegrown solution if one of the competitors will try to do that" [[00:35:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=35m12s). For smaller features, "it's a game of velocity" with the right taste [[00:35:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=35m33s).

### Structure Acquisition Terms with Revenue-Based Upside

When selling Base 44, Maor negotiated beyond just the $80M purchase price. "I structured the deal in a way that even financially, I'm compensated for additional revenues and targets and milestones we're hitting" [[00:05:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=5m0s). This alignment meant he directly benefits from the explosive post-acquisition growth to over $100 million in revenue.

This structure solved the regret problem proactively: when asked if he regrets selling given the rapid growth, his answer is "absolutely not" partly because "this was the whole point" of partnering for scale, but also because he's financially participating in that success [[00:05:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=5m14s). The lesson for founders considering acquisition: structure deals where your interests remain aligned with growth outcomes, not just a one-time payout.

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The Billion-Line Codebase as Future Competitive Moat

While discussing margin optimization strategies, Maor casually mentions that Base 44 has "billions almost trillion lines of code" in their platform that they could "fine tune on" to create their own specialized model [[00:45:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=44m53s). This is a barely-explored but massive strategic asset. 

Following Cursor's playbook of releasing Composer after capturing distribution, Base 44 sits on an unprecedented dataset of actual working applications, user iterations, and debugging sessions. "This like very interesting margin take where for some of the prompts you forward to the fast high margin great model users really enjoy it because those models are going to be way faster than like the Sonnet 4.5 heavy models" [[00:45:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=45m8s). The insight: while everyone focuses on immediate model costs, the real value is accumulating proprietary training data at scale. Companies that capture billions of lines of context-rich, working code now will have insurmountable advantages in fine-tuning specialized models later. This dataset moat could be more defensible than any product feature.

### Small Businesses Actually Build Complex, Production-Grade Applications

There's a passing mention that radically contradicts assumptions about the vibe coding market: "Some applications in Base 44 are like millions of lines of code" [[00:12:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=12m48s). This wasn't about enterprises or developer tools - this is happening with Base 44's target users who are often non-technical small business owners.

The profound implication barely explored: if non-technical users are building million-line applications that they "use day to day" [[00:13:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=12m53s), then the market size isn't just "simple tools for small businesses" - it's "complete software infrastructure for every business." The jaw-dropping stat that "Base 44 has like continued to thrive and is now over a hundred million in revenue" [[00:04:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHo7HYwosGg&t=4m33s) from primarily non-technical users building their own software suggests we're witnessing the earliest innings of a complete restructuring of how businesses operate. When tattoo artists are building million-line CRM systems, every single business process is getting rebuilt. The overlooked insight: the vibe coding market isn't a subset of software - it's larger than all current software categories combined.

---

**Key Takeaway:** Maor's journey from solo developer to $80M acquisition to $100M+ revenue product leader reveals that the vibe coding revolution is further along than most realize. His contrarian bets on small businesses building complex software, dismissing margin concerns, and rejecting winner-take-all dynamics are all being validated in real-time. The biggest missed opportunity for investors may be underestimating how quickly traditional SaaS categories will be disrupted by customizable, AI-built alternatives.
