[00:00:00] From all things in the industry, I think the margins are the least things that I'm worried about.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: Base 44 is the story of one entrepreneur who went from an idea to millions in revenue
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_00: and selling to Wix for $80 million. Today, Mayo joins me in the hot seat.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_01: We're taking into consideration that the prices of model will go down to zero.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_01: Me personally, I don't believe in hidden speed bumps. I don't think also we'll hear the world
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_01: like movements of elements. Even with existing models, we're only scratching the surface
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_01: of economic value that you can create. If one person team can get sold for $80 million
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: without people, it means that you'll be able to do a lot more stuff with less people.
[00:00:43] Ready to go?
[00:00:55] Mayo, it is great to have you on the show, dude. I've been so looking forward to this one. I'm
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: a fan of Base 44. What a freaking journey. Thank you for joining me.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_00: Thank you for having me. I'm a fan of 20 of this here.
[00:01:07] Dude, that's very, very kind. Listen, ego flattery will get you everywhere, and I'm
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: raised. I'm very susceptible to it. I was chatting to Michael Eisenberg before this show,
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: and he said, dude, you've got to start with like a quad for like $80 million. Why did you decide to
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_00: sell before we got to anything else? So, it started Base 44 as a bootstrap business
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: after doing a very capital-heavy one, which we'll probably get to in a bit. And it started
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: honestly just for fun. Just I wanted to get back to coding. Everything, I felt like everything
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: in the software industry was changing. Love the fact that like with fellow Lemusner,
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: you can do so much more. And so it started just for fun. And then the traction was insane.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_01: And it started getting to like, you see like 10,000 users, 100,000 users. And then like the
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_01: business was very profitable. And so I stood in this junction of either I'm continuing doing this
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: alone bootstrap thing, which I might get eaten by companies that are raising like shit down
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_01: of money. Or I should raise a lot of funds and go very aggressive and try to build this on my own.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_01: And the third one is like getting to a company that could be like a parent company.
[00:02:25] And try to find something that is like can harmonize with the business and actually push it
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_01: forward. So I remember when I started having the conversations with Wix, I was very worried. And
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_01: I was like, I'm not going to sell. I remember telling a V-Shie like to see how Wix was telling him,
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: if Kelsa was sold to Microsoft, probably the one being Kelsa today. The fact that they were
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_01: independent and they could build the business, buy themselves how they wanted without kind of like
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: the corporate stuff has gotten them full. And then we had many late night chats where one
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_01: understood that Wix for a lot of reasons that many no weeks could understand. And I'm happy
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: to talk about is a perfect match because we're targeting the same audience. It's the same spirit.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_01: The marketing team is the absolute, in my opinion, very, in my very not objective eyes is the
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_01: best in the market. They're just aggressive, they're creative, they're absolutely awesome.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: And if we can structure it in a way where the company itself, the product team stays lean,
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_01: small and start to be like, but all the other stuff we can benefit from the monster that is Wix.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_01: For example, the support and customer care, the marketing stuff, the thing that you don't really
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: want to build like the legal and operation stuff. Then this could be a lot of fun. And we structure
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: the great deal. And I think to me it was like, okay, we have a shot at actually building something
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: that matters. And so I said, for an actual shot of taking this from this low few hundred thousand
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: users to something that might, if we walk hard for wild deals, actually move the needle for a lot
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_01: of people that might actually be a thing that people speak about as, hey, this actually made an
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_01: impact on the world. It was either I raise a lot of money and a lot of funding. Oh, I go and
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_01: join Wix that basically triples my chances at actually building something special.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_01: Today, base 44 has like continued to thrive and is now over a hundred million in revenue.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: It's done so well post acquisition. Everyone's going, God, does he regret selling now?
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: When you look at how fast it's grown and to over a hundred million in revenue,
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: do you regret selling so soon? Absolutely not for all kinds of reasons.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_01: First, I can comment on the revenue stuff in public company and so on.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_01: But one was structured the deal in a way that even financially,
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_01: I'm compensated for additional revenues and targets and milestones were hitting.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_01: And second, this was the whole point. Like, I felt like in my eyes, this is going to be the
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_01: largest category in software industry. Because a lot of existing categories that we're familiar with,
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: CRM and support systems and task management and project management and stuff like that are
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: going to fold into the vibe coding category. And that would be a time, it might be in a few
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_01: months, it might be in a few years where it will be easier to build your own Salesforce type of
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_01: CRM than to actually buy a license to something off the shelf. And the whole point with partnering
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_01: with Wix is let's take a shot at building something that would be huge. And I think without it,
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_01: my chances would be really small. With the greatest of respects, that's wrong. Dude,
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_00: you're not going to have people build their own Salesforce CRMs on the whole. Maybe a tiny, tiny
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_00: portion or build your own intercoms or CRs or decogons. And then do maintenance and updates. Are you
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_00: serious? I honestly think so. It might be not as like the current way that we think about
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: vibe coding. Well, you put on like, hey, build a CRM for me and then you get a fully fledged
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_01: all features inside. It might be that software becomes more liquid. And so maybe you have a
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_01: starting point, maybe you have templates, maybe you have like open source projects that people can
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_01: take and then vibe code their own features and say, okay, this is great. Now I want this
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_01: this version in Arabic from right to left. And I want our own every lead to be able to add my
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_01: pictures of the leader, whatever. And then basically convert and transform the software to something
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_01: that's more what they want. But I think the current model of one size fits all. Doesn't make a lot
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_01: of sense. It's not that everyone will move that it's not that enterprises. It's going to take a lot
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_01: of time, but it makes so much sense for the buyer. Think about it as like the software is going to be
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_01: there's the code will be there's there will not need to share the data with the other with other
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: software vendors and be locked in in like in whatever they could adapt it and create a linear
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_01: version that's way more customized to their needs. I think every I'll go even one step further.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_01: I think every software company that needs implementals. Right. There's like a Salesforce
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: implement or whatever. Maybe in a decade from now is not going to make it.
[00:07:57] Because software and again, like if you take a year back, then yeah, vibe coding wasn't even a
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_01: thing. And building software wasn't even a thing. And maybe it was like a nice toy thing. Maybe
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: you could build like a task management small kind of kind of software. Maybe it could build a nice
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: website. In the year or two, you'll get to a place where a lot of the current organizational tools
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: that companies are using. You could build your own version or customize your own version. And it
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_01: would make so much more sense to you as a buyer. The code will be yours. The data will be yours.
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_01: You'll be able to adapt it to your needs. There's no one size fits all. There's no like feature bloat.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_01: When you buy today like a task management, I don't know, software. It has so many features that
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_01: you don't really need. Do you think small businesses give a shit about that? Give a shit about
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_00: actually owning their own data, owning their own code. If you're a small coffee shop or coffee chain
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_00: or restaurant chain or legal and accounting firm, if that's the bread and butter of which is
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: business, do they need it? Not necessarily the code in data, but they need something that's
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_01: simpler and more customized to their needs. You know how I started Baseball before? My back then
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_01: Gelfa and her wife has a small business. She needed a CRM and she needed some systems for her
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_01: small business. She's a tattoo artist and she teaches like arts and stuff like that. And we tried
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_01: building that with the former version of the, I'm not going to name the software vendor or two
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_01: software vendors that you tried doing that with like the drag and drop and the super customized like
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_01: build your own tables or CRM or whatever. And it was hello, no. And I like a software person,
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_01: right? I should know how to do that. But like just configuring that and then making it so that
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_01: it supports her process of how she processes leads and customers and whatever and she's like,
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_01: this is insane. I was like, I know that like an LLM can code something linear and way better for
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: what she needs, exactly what she needs. And I'm not going to have like this entire features and
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_01: enterprise features and team management stuff and whatever settings and stuff like that was
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_01: going to be super simple for what she needs and could adapt to her needs. And I was like, I know
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_01: LLM's can do that. I just need to provide LLM's with like the right setup, right? They can write
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_01: the code, but she will need a database to keep the leads and she will need some integrations with
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_01: like sending emails and stuff like that. And that's why I started Base 44 and exactly for that.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: And so I think small businesses specifically would want to build something linear and more
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_01: customized to what they need, something that they can understand, something that they can adapt
[00:10:43] and bloated SARS of the pre 2022 era. It's going to be harder for people to use.
[00:10:51] It will sales force be bigger or smaller in 10 years time.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: It might and Mark Benif is a smart person, I'm sure that also in the companies like
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_01: is incredible, so they might adapt. But I think generally from this category,
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_01: those companies would be smaller. If not like some of them would be eliminated.
[00:11:15] Which would you say is most likely to be eliminated? Smaller CRM companies,
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_01: every software that's basically flaunted on top of a database with some team features and some
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: integrations and does not have a mode. I think sales force is so big and so massive that this is
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_01: like this is one of their modes. Like they can make big bets and like move a lot of stuff and
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_01: like go in many different directions when we all try to adapt in this AI era. But smaller players
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: think would be eliminated. You said the word moat there. It's often a criticism of this category.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_00: You know I've had the founders of sales force, Benioff at last in Mike Cannonbrook's
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: Cloudflare, Matt Prince, Dylan, Field from Figma. Even Colpay, the founder of Nothing,
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_00: the phone company has created their own base 44 equivalent. And everyone said this is a business
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: with no moats and you see that in the ability for these people to spin up products in three months.
[00:12:24] Yeah. How do you respond to that statement? I think it's relatively easy
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_01: to create a vibe-coding tool. It's very very very hard to create a platform that can help people
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_01: build products that actually use, that are functional, that are complex enough for real world
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_01: use cases. And for that you need many layers of integrations. You need to adapt and tune the
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_01: agent to handle very complex projects. I think some applications in base 44s are like millions
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_01: of lines of code. And that's eventually the customers and users that you care about because those
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_01: are the ones that will go beyond the hype of, hey look I've built this Monday.com clone with a single
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_01: poem. No, you didn't like it's going to take you like hundreds or thousands of points to get to
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_01: something that you're going to use day to day. And I think the mode in the category is being
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_01: able to get them. And that's like layers of integrations and heavy lifting and building a compute.
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_01: You're almost building like a small cloud because you want to give the element the ability to
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_01: have access to databases and have user management and to have built-in integrations.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_01: And the ability to run schedule tasks because that's what real software does. And you want to have
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_01: the element can like access to many cloud services and integrations. And so you're building an
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_01: entire ecosystem in this platform. But yeah, to build a vibe coding tool that can build some
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_01: websites or a front end that could connect to some APIs, I think it's super easy to do nowadays.
[00:14:01] Does that not take away a lot of the low end of the market though?
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: If you think about that, essentially, if it's able to build like good front and good landing
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_00: pages, good simple projects, then it basically leaves the higher end champion users for the more
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_00: complex service providers like you. Does that not either way and cannibalize a lot of the market?
[00:14:22] I think it depends on like what you call the market. So like for base body floor,
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_01: we almost don't focus on websites, which also goes very well with weeks,
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_01: right? Because weeks does a lot of like websites and marketing websites and e-commerce websites
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_01: and stuff like that. For base body floor, laser focus from alcohol focus from day one is the
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_01: complex applications, the functionality. So if you were looking to build like a
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_01: marketing platform where AI agents can generate content constantly and read your LinkedIn posts and
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_01: see the traction that you're getting in form there, try to digest and then fill in your calendar,
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_01: different like functional, complex stuff that you use day to day. I think early on the vibe
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_01: coding category was focused a lot and still isn't to some degree on like front end and landing
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_01: pages where many use cases were on like websites or e-commerce websites and stuff like that. I
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_01: think this will get commoditized. For the category, there's still a lot to do when you're looking like
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_01: SEO and domain management and like if you're building an e-commerce, there's like a complex business
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_01: you want to integrate with like a full backend like what weeks has or Shopify or whatever.
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_01: But for the functional stuff and the complex applications, the organization applications,
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_01: the personal applications, the full, fully fledged SaaS platforms that build people are building.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_01: I think they won't get commoditized and I think that's not the long market. Also, I think that's
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: the more profitable use cases for tools like ours because at some point, okay, you're building a
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: website, let's say a nice website for your VC firmware or whatever, at some points like, okay,
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_01: this looks pretty. That's it. I'm not going to prompt anymore. And a lot of like the business model
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_01: of this category is around like the credits for prompting. And so at some point, you're like, okay,
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: that's it. I'm done. I have this front end. It probably costs very like not a lot to host it somewhere.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: And I think the more profitable stuff with the higher margin and the more value would have been
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_01: building the complex applications as to use day to day. When you map out this market in like three
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_00: to five years time, can you help me understand what that looks like? Because you've got in my mind,
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_00: like three different entry points, you've got the base 44s, the lovables, and the raplet's in one.
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_00: You've got the figmas, the cloud flares, the Atlassians, the Salesforcees, and like the incumbent
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_00: insertion point. And then you've got the canvas on the other kind of more consumer and I put
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: probably put figma in that with Canva. What happens here? And then sorry, you've also got the cognitions
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_00: and the curses and the pro tools there. Do the pro tools come down and eat your business?
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_00: Do you go up and eat their business? What happens there? It's a very good question. I'll start with like
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_01: what you categorize as incumbents, but I'll actually call it like the different software categories
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_01: that exist. So like let's take a Salesforce or a Monday.con for example, I think a lot of those tools
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_01: will build built in vibe coding tools inside their platform. You can see that like with Monday vibe,
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_01: which is a tool they've built on top of like the Monday.com infrastructure of like boards and like
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_01: the database behind the scenes and the user management, souls, permissions and so on.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_01: And this is what I say when I meant software is going to become more liquid.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_01: So I don't know if Salesforce is planning to do that or but I'm assuming that at some point
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_01: like you'll be able to create your own user interface for Salesforce. And Salesforce would become
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_01: like this system of record where like you can create the UI the q1 and how you want to look at
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_01: a lead or contact or account or whatever. And I think a lot of tools are going to do that because
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_01: this is basically taking kind of like the instead of like configuring different things and building
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: different features, it would allow a lot of extability to existing products. And so you start seeing
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_01: that and you see also like Microsoft building like some vibe coding tools on top of like the
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_01: office and whatever and stuff like I can see a future where a lot of the existing sars tools and
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_01: sars products have a built in vibe coding customizes the software to your needs capability.
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_01: I think it's an interesting take on what's going to happen with the pro players versus the very
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_01: consumerish slash AI upbuilder or visual AI upbuilder. Well, I think for base 44 for example from day one,
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_01: the objective was that you want to need to see a line of code. And that for a lot of our users like
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_01: like seeing code actually like I wouldn't say terrifies them but like it's not what they want to do
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_01: right. You have your lawyer and you want to like create some system for your law film or software
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_01: like there's no need for you to see code and you you should be able to customize and do whatever
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_01: you want just by pointing it. I think the Kelsil and the Windself or cognition of the world are
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_01: doing fantastic job with focusing on the existing dev community and kind of target audience.
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_01: And there's a lot to do there because there's a lot of it's going to take a lot of time for tools
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_01: like and platforms like base 44 and the bolt and lovable of the world to get to a place where you
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_01: can build like the existing whatever x percent of software that we cannot build today. So given
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_01: example, it's very hard to build a firewall today in base 44 right something that will see it on
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_01: your computer will be very like in terms of performance will be very native on your computer will
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_01: like send logs to an centralized server that will analyze it for the organization. So like there's
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_01: existing software products where the AI are built else like base 44 is going to take a lot of time
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_01: to get to if any. And I think that's also a lot of like how we measure internally and one of our
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_01: objectives is like what's the percentage of software that we can build today and how we push it
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_01: forward. So like I'll give another example we're walking now on allowing applications inside base 44
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_01: to use schedule tasks. So maybe you want to build something and like every Monday mornings and then
[00:21:11] SPEAKER_01: email to all your users with a summary of what they did inside your app or whatever. We built a
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_01: personal assistant and you've integrated what's up and you want to tell the personal assistant,
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_01: remind me in two days to pick up the kids or whatever. And so this obviously doesn't exist today
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_01: and building this basically pushes slightly more the type of software that you can build with base 44.
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_01: And we've built like this built in capability to build AI agents and we've integrated it with
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_01: what's up and slack and whatever. So now you can actually build bots not only applications and so
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_01: we constantly measure kind of like that type of software that we can build. And I think the
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_01: cursor and cognition of the world are doing a terrific job with walking on like this
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_01: enormous software projects and especially like enterprise projects and like large very complex
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_01: software that needs a lot of back-and-service and it's like multi anyway very complex
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_01: applications like you want to build a firewall or we internally obviously use Kelser to build our
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_01: own back-and. I don't know where the market will be headed. I'm sure that they will go a bit up
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_01: market and bring in some of like the visual builder that and kind of like them for the less complex
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_01: users and I'm sure that the earlier like the base 44 the bold the lovables of the world will
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_01: go a bit down with like the types of software that you'll be able to build and the software that
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_01: you weren't able to build like a year ago or a few months ago you'll be able to build in a few
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_01: months. It's going to be interesting but this is a huge market it's like a lot of it is like
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_01: depends on like what's that type like you cannot build for any type of users either you
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_01: self the developer where they want to see the code and they want to edit it and they want to
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_01: bring like terminal stuff and you want to run on their computers or yourself there
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_01: the non-technical user which is like complex. Mayo you have lovable you have wraplet and you have
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_00: bolt who's the best and who's the worst. Tough question I think replete is more technical
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_01: than started as a dev tool and the thing for developers they're doing a good job for the semi-developers.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_01: We'll call it this way. Developers probably the hardcore ones will go to kill so
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't say who's the worst. Which ones you not worry about. I'm not worried about those three.
[00:23:50] Wow who are you worried about. I think more about market dynamics and how things will turn out to be
[00:23:57] SPEAKER_01: with the model providers. I think my theory and thesis is that there's always going to be
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_01: huge advantage to the folks who are playing with multiple model providers but if at one point
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_01: one of the model providers will just win the market by a wide margin then the next logical thing
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_01: is to conquer the vibe coding market because this again in my not objective eyes will be
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_01: the largest software category. As long as there's like a fight and there's a race
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_01: then world position to control a very large share of the market and bring in a better solution to
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_01: the market. Who do you think is more likely to do that? Codex or Claude code? Google.
[00:24:51] By far they have the compute. They're moving very fast. If it generates some point wins the race like
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_01: literally wins the race then they have the entire stack including like Google Cloud and whatever
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_01: they need and they have the data and whatever and integrations and then Google suite and so on
[00:25:16] to build an incredible empire. I'm hoping for a tough race and it looks like that right now. By the
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_01: way an insane market dynamics because like obviously spending a lot on AI and like in a split
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_01: second like you change one string in the code and you move like millions in spend to a different
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_01: provider and it bounces back to it depends on like who provides like the best model and the best
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: whatever cost and throughput and so on. Can you give me an example of that? Let's say on the
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_01: coding space there's like you see Claude comes out with like Claude4 and Sonnet4 and you're like
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: perfect let's use that and before that we were like doing a split between Sonnet and Gemini and
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_01: then OpenAI comes up with GPT-5 and so and you try to figure out for all of those folks by the way
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_01: it's like it's not necessarily there's like a better model that you move your entire workload but
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_01: you see that as like places where the model's doing better. So for the PhilSport Sonnet's like the
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_01: best like the best designer and knows how to structure it and it was really good with like writing
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_01: like a project from scratch but then what we found is that like GPT-5 and especially the thinking
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_01: and the poor versions like really good at solving hard bugs and so you move a lot of workload especially
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_01: on the complex applications and very large context IPI calls to OpenAI and so when doing that's like
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_01: you're literally moving hundreds of thousands of spend which is actually just like the simplest change
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_01: and if now I don't know but maybe Gemini3 is going to be better than anything else which is what
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_01: people is now they're saying then we're going to move a lot of spend and a lot of workload overnight
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_01: to a different window and that's like an insane market dynamics to me. I get you it's an insane
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_00: market dynamic because everyone compares the other land market to the cloud market in terms of
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_00: it being a commodity but actually a mega market that will be phenomenal for the providers with a
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: couple of core winners but what you just said there is completely different which is an ease of
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_00: switching that you would never have in the cloud market you do not switch your cloud provider
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_00: with a line of code in seconds multiple times a month. How do you think about that analogy from
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_00: LLM provider to cloud provider given what you just said? Yeah you do not switch a cloud provider
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_01: that's very hard to do right. My previous company we tried doing that it was so painful
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_01: if I've known how tough it's going to be when we started that for like a year long process
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_01: probably wouldn't do it. For the LLM's it's insane how easy it is. I think they're still like so
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_01: I think what we see for the model providers is that they're building multiple tools for multiple
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_01: levels in the value chain so you see all of them having this CLI coding tool and all of them having
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_01: this very high end or end user focused chat product like Gemini and Chagypety and so on.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_01: We'll start seeing them bringing in so Gemini is now everywhere in my Gmail in like a lot of
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_01: like workflows and like building automation and so you start seeing them go up the market of software
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_01: and trying to and and bringing their tools and then model basically to drive consumption
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_01: all across the stack or if it looked like a year ago it was mostly like you could consume it either
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_01: in an API or you could consume it in like this end user type of chat. I don't know it's going to be
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_01: super interesting it's just that to me it's crazy the fact that's like what let's say one of them
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_01: kind of like stones ahead for like six months right something that haven't happened before
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_01: but it's like literally the best model for like six months ahead how will they be able to handle
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_01: the fact it's like so let's say if someone comes out now with with a better stronger and cheaper model
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_01: than Sonnet 4.5 and it stays like that for ontropic for like the next six months like what I'm
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_01: assuming I don't really know it's like what happens to ontropic revenue right like over and I
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_01: okay switch from all the CaleSers and the Cloud codes let's say you switch to Gemini or whatever
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_01: GPT 5.5 or whatever this is like such a fast decline but also they had such a fast fast ascend
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_01: I don't know it's going to be crazy but I don't I don't think I have the right answers to what's
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_01: going to how this market is going to play out obviously we're all hoping that this is going to stay
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_01: a very competitive market where prices will go down I think also when we're making like strategic
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_01: on what will go into optimize and what's not and it's very strange to manage a business like
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_01: base 44 because in some places there's like you see things that you need to either optimize or build
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_01: but you'll take a decision not to do that because you know that future versions of the models are
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_01: not taking off that so one of like the the thing that Vishayan and I were speaking of when
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_01: was speaking strategy is like we're taking into consideration that the prices of model will go down
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_01: to zero at least for tools like base 44 for platforms like base 44 and so this is like a strategic
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_01: decision where you're saying okay I could optimize some and we're doing that but like I will
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: investing a lot of people out here to optimize the costs oh we're taking into consideration just
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_01: the prices the prices of the models are just going down and down and down one of my cool questions
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_00: that I want to understand is the margin structure and when you look at today every dollar that comes
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_00: what percent of that dollar goes back to another and provider depends on the timing the exact
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_01: number I cannot say because we're a public company even though I missed that a lot to kind of like
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_01: show the nicest way to no one shares that but what it does no way that you again educate me
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_00: does no one share it because it's so bad no it's also very decision dependent so like you can
[00:31:20] change it from like low margin to a very high margin and just one decision is just deciding on how
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_01: great of a service they want to give you users I think what will happen eventually with all
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_01: coding agents is that the cheaper open source models are getting way better you always want to play
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_01: with like the strongest models but what will happen and what we're kind of like looking at it
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_01: internally is like building this switch or proxy where when you get a prompt from user maybe the
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_01: prompt is so simple that it doesn't even matter like what model you're getting it was like change
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_01: the color of the button from blue to red right I don't really need to use like the heavy
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_01: sonnet maximum thinking whatever pay a lot for that right I can I can kind of like
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_01: forward this request to a smaller cheaper model and this will also be like a way better
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_01: experience to use or because it's going to be so much faster than than bringing kind of like the
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_01: heavy guns of like their four- and two models and I think doing that and the more models the
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_01: more the smaller or open source models are able to take a larger percentage of the request and
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_01: points obviously margins going to improve drastically I don't think it's bad that's that's my
[00:32:34] I don't think yeah I don't think current margins are bad but I think they're going to get way better
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_00: today they suck then everyone always says oh but we're going to have like model selection
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_00: as exactly as you said there which is we'll be able to intelligent routing on models and I'm like
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_00: okay depends on like I hope so male yeah we all we'll do I think it depends on how like the
[00:33:00] product and the flow that you're building so one of the players that you mentioned for example
[00:33:05] is doing a really good job with autonomy well kind of like you plumb something and then they go
[00:33:11] SPEAKER_01: and they run for like 20 minutes or 30 minutes to and they have like this coding agent it's
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_01: a rap place agent right yeah yeah but like well first what if my my prompt like what if I kind of
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_01: didn't really mean what I just pointed or like okay it went and built like this fully I'm just
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_01: the free user and I just built like a lot of cash right now and like coding and testing and whatever
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_01: and if so I think it depends on like the level of autonomy you want to give and kind of like how
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_01: fast iterations you're giving out to users I don't know the margins but like I'm saying you could
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_01: build a lot by not understanding what the user actually wants but from all things in the
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_01: industry I think the margins are the least thing that I'm worried about the most thing you're worried
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_01: about is Google coming in not really but like their competitive landscape the pace is insane
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_01: like for us every feature that we put out we know that's going to take I'd ever feel weeks or
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_01: few months for competitor to copy and we see there's a lot how does that change how does that change
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_00: what you build it's really interesting I had you know the founder of five Amisha on the show
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_00: from the trail to and he said the time to copy is the single biggest difference in the last two
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_00: years of software right used to be years now it's weeks yeah how does that change what you build
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_00: or how you think you take big bets on things that are if you can find those that are substantial
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_01: to your users and will be really hard to copy so I'll give you one example the whole reasons
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_01: for base 44s existence existence is the built-in backend the fact that we built base 44 as a fully
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_01: overtly integrated platform well for every application you already have a built-in database user
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_01: management authentication integrations analytics and so on and the thing is is that we didn't use
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_01: a third party provider like super base which is what the rest of the industry is using super base
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_01: on the on and we've built it like built-in and we've taken a very courageous kind of like a step
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_01: there and there's still a lot more to build there this is going to be very hard to replicate
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_01: and very hard to migrate your whatever millions of users from one from super base to a homegrown
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_01: solution if you if one of the competitors will try to do that and I think this is a bet that we're
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_01: a deepening further and further and further for other stuff it's a game of velocity of the light
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_01: taking the right UX decisions and having the right taste and just being trying to be there
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_01: before everyone else gets there so there's like I think we started this uh so two weeks ago we came
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_01: up with something called up suggestions very small feature which is very nice like after you
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_01: prompt it gives you like the next steps like okay now we're the dashboard like it gives you kind
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_01: of like suggestions to what to do in your app it took maybe a few days for other competitors to
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_01: copy that but it's fine it's like um that's the game that we're playing now what percent of starting
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_00: uses finish the project it's a good question of what finishing means and I don't think I have the
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_01: answer for that I don't think I have the right move for that deployed application that works
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_01: that's many but that's not the right question the right question is how many get the usage do you
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_01: want kind of how many get to actual usage so many publish the apps and the apps are fully functioning
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_01: at some point you're like bottle test your agent so much to teach it how to query the database and
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_01: how for every like start categorizing the different flows and the different use cases that
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_01: use or prompt it and you make sure that you feed your agent with the right example so many many
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_01: many get to like functioning applications so this is like the saturated benchmark the question is
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_01: how many get to actually usage day to day I don't have the right answer to that what metric is
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_00: user success for you then if there is this nuance and complexity with regards to like success for
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_00: internally what is your metric for you use a success there's a couple first we measure the sentiment
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_01: of the messages they send in the chat which was also will to me but it turns out
[00:37:41] many people are like speaking with the chat as they would to a human they either tell you okay
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_01: a fantastic job this is exactly what I wanted when I was like asking for this feature all they
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_01: cancel out like this is not what I want to know you deleted this button and I want to do this and I want
[00:38:00] SPEAKER_01: to that and so we have this metric that we literally measure on a minute to minute basis of like
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_01: how many of the problems because nowadays we get like tens tens of thousands of ones like a minute
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_01: or whatever in tandem and so we measure the sentiment and that's how we know how coding agent does
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_01: what it's being asked to and you see kind like how if we release an app blade you see kind like this
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_01: this the negativity metric kind of goes down or if when we jump from Sunnett 4 to Sunnett 4.5 you see
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_01: a major improvement there so this is one thing that we measure and again this even the metrics
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_01: change a lot with the business like base 44 because when we started it was mostly around bugs right
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_01: how many times like the model messes up something and the application doesn't work or does like bugs
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_01: and like how things that like break you up nowadays it's going to it's not easy to create bugs in your
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_01: app the elements are really small the the infrastructure is battle tested so it's more about
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_01: does the agent actually does what is a bit asking of it
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_01: does it make the right change without making additional changes or messing up other features
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_01: and you can see for example that again so even if I give the example of like schedule tasks so maybe
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_01: the user asks hey I want you to send me a daily email with like reminders and then the coding
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_01: agent says I cannot do that I don't have the right infrastructure to do schedule tasks and so
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_01: when we add schedule tasks we should see a few numbers like a few percentages kind of like of
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_01: this metric impulse going back to the elements on margin I had Ev Randall who's the new GP at
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_00: benchmark and he said how are you thinking about this wrong we need less of a focus on margin
[00:39:54] SPEAKER_00: and we need more of a focus on gross dollars per customer in other words expanding the spend
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_00: of the customer not the actual margin on a lower spend do you agree with that or do you actually
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_00: know we'll revert back to a margin optimized world where we have open source models as we discussed
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_00: I think 100% right now the big game for our category is growth
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_01: and capturing as much of this insanely big market there's almost no person that
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_01: shouldn't be a user for a platform like base 44 and so obviously it's like growing
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_01: not necessarily the spend of every customer to as many customers as possible the spend's
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_01: going to come down as models would be cheaper so like I don't think it's like let's try and
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_01: grab as many dollars from the customer as possible so I'd say margin is always important keep your
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_01: business going like there's one thing I learned in base 44 is like when you lean and you
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_01: were saying business and you're like a good business that does really good to all other
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_01: aspects of the business and it's not something that I understood in my previous company
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_01: which wasn't like it wasn't like I made fatal mistakes but it's like we were very
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_01: capital heavy and there's something by creating a business that makes sense and is healthy
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_01: in margins and retention and the spend and whatever that allows you to grow later on in a
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_01: sustainable way without at some point hitting the brakes and saying oh well like nothing makes
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_01: sense in our margins or whatever and so I'd say margins is something you should constantly look at
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_01: while knowing or while planning ahead and taking into consideration that the model related stuff
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_01: which is like 99% of the spend or 90% of the spend is changing drastically and aggressively every
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_01: few months when you have that change in spend you have like a less certain revenue as we said
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_00: earlier the transience of spend leads to an anthropic could skyrocket or could not depending on
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_00: where you shift spend can you advise me honestly dude I'm an early stage investor I invest in
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_00: AI apps today and everyone is posting insane fucking numbers like you know you look at yours and
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_00: it's like 100 million you know you're you're lovable in your rap but it's like 200 million how much
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_00: weight should I as an early stage investor place on revenue today that's a very good question which
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_01: also me as myself as an investor like I'm asking myself so obviously like the metrics today is like
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_01: were like different right when I started my clearest company we got to like two million dollars in
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_01: a hour I think it was like a year and a half and everybody were cheering and was saying like this
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_01: is insane and like whatever nowadays is like if you if you can show the the hockey stick of how
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_01: fast you got to 10 million dollars or 20 million dollars everything changes I think it depends on
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_01: like the the model of the company or investing in for me it's like smaller checks into very healthy
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_01: businesses so the thing that I look at the most okay it's faster than your growth obviously that's
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_01: what you want to see this is like the most exciting but there are two things one healthy business
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_01: is like how likely is this business to get eaten by other players the model provides also whatever
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_01: and the second one she's very much related is a vertically integrated business
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_01: um so here's something really cool that that we're looking at right now so Kierzel came out I think
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_01: it was two weeks ago or maybe a few weeks ago with their own model right composer um and this is like
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: and and a nice way to like think about strategy of those types of businesses so think about Kierzel
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: I don't know how the margins were let's take the the kind like that the not optimistic approach of
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_01: saying margins were bad right they were paying so much to the other model providers or whatever
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_01: so this is like an insane strategy it's like grow as fast as you can get to like insane uh distribution
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_01: like every developer that creates full Twitter like probably installs Kierzel and then at some point
[00:44:12] bringing your very efficient model that you trained that is now fast and start moving people from
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_01: the very expensive low margin models into your own model which is likely to be a high margin and then
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_01: again over the night your margins get tremendously better but you you've grown fast as hell and now
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_01: you have the distribution now you can optimize margins because again well it like the margins for
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_01: the models are like that's something that's easy to uh if you decide not easy but like it's very
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_01: doable to change drastically overnight um I think this is a really interesting strategy that
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_01: we're also thinking internally is like grow as fast as you can with the frontier models at some point
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_01: open source becomes really a viable option to maybe fine tune on like the billions almost
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_01: trillion lines of code that we have inside base 44 um and then have this like very interesting margin
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_01: take well for some of the points you forward like to the to the fast high margin great model
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_01: users really enjoy it because those models are going to be way faster than like their son at 4.4
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_01: heavy heavy models so this is like an interesting take when you think about vertically integrated
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_01: applications there's some applications today that I think are going very very fast that that are
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_01: going to have a harder time keeping it this way I remember I don't remember the name of the company
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_01: that was like this company that was like very one of the earliest practical use cases for a
[00:45:43] SPEAKER_01: little lamb there was like an marketing they were generating content and they go super fast you
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_01: probably remember just but AI yeah go super fast and the mode was just like it was absolutely how
[00:45:56] SPEAKER_01: to create mode over there because it was like clearly that there's like okay you like you
[00:46:02] only using a lens right for base 44 is like an entire infrastructure you build like a mini cloud
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_01: that allows applications to send emails generate images use other little limbs to like deploy to
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_01: manage users and whatever so you have something around the lens that makes sense to have like enough
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_01: of a business when I'm investing nowadays I'm thinking can this business if not today
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: did some point in the future vertically integrated self-sustainable like maybe what
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_01: cares I will turn out to be at some point can we just go through it in a helpful way you said
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_00: three elements that revenue growth what revenue growth is exciting then is it just the highest is
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_00: it I need to see one to 10 in the first year which I mean if you're building a stress yeah it's
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_01: gonna be a zero to 10 that's gonna be exciting there's 10 in the year for you me I think this is
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_01: insane zero to 10 is an insane growth for any suspect what I mean honestly now that's that's
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_00: it's it's good but that's quite a lot that do zero to 10 I mean that's a lot insane yeah that's
[00:47:09] SPEAKER_01: one thing it's gonna be there on the exciting piece I'm like when I'm looking to invest I'm not
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_01: necessarily gonna say okay the company has to do zero to 10 how do you determine if they're
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_00: gonna be eaten by models like what is the question or criteria that will help you get comfortable
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_00: with that if most of the value is on the way they prompt the application for a certain thing
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_01: like they've built let's say a photo editor and so there's not a lot of features in a photo
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_01: edit like an AI based like you feed the picture and say okay make me I don't know make me
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_01: prettier or whatever and if a lot of that's gonna be like the UX in the prompt I don't think that's
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_01: that's gonna be a healthy business for the next day I don't think there's like a lot of
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_01: mode if you're building a lot of infrastructure all the company itself is vertically integrated I think
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_01: that's a very interesting take so like you could nowadays build a competitor to Harvey and Spellbook
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_01: that would kind of like teach some little them better way on like how you how to do law or whatever
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_01: all you could build a law firm and I think building a law firm is gonna be very very very very
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_01: interesting because this is not something that a model provider would do or any other kind of like
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_01: same software entrepreneur that wants to do just software and I think there's like an opportunity
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_01: today to build very healthy new age vertically integrated businesses and it could be again a law
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_01: firm it could be buying a hospital basically optimizing everything on every layer and making it the
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_01: I native and maybe in a few years being the first ones to introduce robots into as surgeons or
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_01: and I think nowadays as like opportunities all the cost of finding like in different categories
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_01: softer not softer whatever to build vertically integrated companies and I think if your company is
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_01: just about like how you're prompting an LLM and maybe you're doing a better job with like
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_01: tuning it to whatever legal needs or finally finest need or whatever and the infrastructure that
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_01: you have below it is not very complex it's gonna be how to to have a mode are you angel investing
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_00: today yeah or starting to do you enjoy it very much was carried first but nowadays it's so much fun
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_01: also it's come like you like you have a chance to work with like incredible founders and become like
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_01: at this huge platform shift probably the biggest ones that we're facing and to think with them
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_01: what the hell are we gonna do but also to think with them is like what are the new opportunities
[00:50:03] SPEAKER_01: that are gonna open up they're just like building so coming back to to this crazy idea I said
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_01: earlier like building a lot from like five years ago would seem like the most like bad idea that
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_01: you can think of right building a lot from buying a hospital and optimizing it with AI or whatever
[00:50:21] SPEAKER_01: right building a new bank I think today is like you have this huge platform shift that's so much
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_01: so many exciting discussions when you look at different industries of like thinking
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_01: intuels from now photos from now like what's the craziest thing that we can think of like what should
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_01: we aim for that's barely possible today or not possible today and should be possible in two to four
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_01: years and I think this is like an incredible way to think about angel investing and so much fun
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_01: doing so very risky but very very fun what do you think no one is investing today that everyone should
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_00: be investing today and why do you think everyone is investing today where they should not be investing
[00:51:08] oh wow that's a good question I think the nuts sexy industries again the finance the restaurants
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_01: whatever the the age of most like actually having like entrepreneurs building that end to end
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_01: is where people should be more like investing more into I think a lot of people investing nowadays to
[00:51:35] SPEAKER_01: very fast going like a hockey stick revenue plotting startups which is not where I think unless
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_01: you know a business or an industry very very well I think it's very hard to for investors outside
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_01: to understand if this is going to be with with the motor not so a good example for that is I had
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: the opportunity to invest in like this um agent companies right like the manus the those first
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_01: yeah I don't like I felt like I don't know the industry good enough to understand if at some
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_01: point this would get commoditized by the model companies and so this is like an area that I wouldn't
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_01: invest in because I was like okay this is obviously dangerous like the obviously the more that
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_01: the capabilities that open AI builds into charge of pity and then Google into German and whatever
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_01: they're like they're going to be well like they're going to have like serious and and incredible
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_01: agents and I'm not sure this category even if you get to like kicks insane growth like you can
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: see the manus and the other players like they have this this graph that I think I even like go
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_01: even more aggressive than the than than our industry I'm not sure that there was a lot behind it
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_01: rather than like prompting and given the tools that are for sure going to be part of like
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_01: chat GPT or the Gemini interface or whatever Michael Eisenberg said I had to ask you make the case
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_00: for how you beat cursor when I started base 44 and I said okay I'm going to do this really
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_01: for the non-technical people because at that point and still do most of the industry if you wanted to
[00:53:20] SPEAKER_01: like most of the players in the market if you wanted to build something really functional
[00:53:24] you should have prompted like hey connect the backend and then it will tell you okay bring the API
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_01: key from super based on whatever things like your mom and my mom wouldn't be able to do right
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_01: and so I said okay let's build for the very non-technical folks and then when doing so obviously like
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_01: and and base 44 started getting a lot of traction and obviously like we also got some developers
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_01: and some technical people that said give me the code and like you should invest in like a
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_01: GitHub integration allow me to edit files and whatever and at some point we also implemented that
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_01: but the more time passed and the more the models got better and the more like faster and whatever
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_01: there were less bugs nobody wanted to see the code and it was less important for for people to
[00:54:10] SPEAKER_01: actually be able to manually edit and change and whatever and I think the direction and again
[00:54:17] SPEAKER_01: that we're going to is like more and more and more percentages of like more and more types of
[00:54:22] SPEAKER_01: software will you'll be able to build inside base 44 that nobody wants to see code I don't think it's
[00:54:28] SPEAKER_01: like if you'll get to like this flow state where you're pointing with the AI and it's going to be super
[00:54:32] SPEAKER_01: fast and it's going to be almost immediate every point like you'll see that and it's going to change
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_01: I don't think you want to see the code and I think you want to start saying okay you should look at
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_01: these files and those models and like like run those tests and whatever and I think nowadays
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_01: for some and a growing part of software even the most technical users would prefer building a
[00:54:56] SPEAKER_01: side base 44 than to do it in Kelser and they would don't want to like now set up servers and
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_01: databases and see the code and write tests and collect navigator the files and whatever and
[00:55:08] SPEAKER_01: my guess is that this portion of software that you can build a side base 44 is going to grow
[00:55:15] SPEAKER_01: and I think obviously now there's the experience if you can build it in side base 44 you'd
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_01: be probably prefer to do it in side base 44 than in Kelser. You can invest in cursor at 29.3
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_00: billion or you can invest in cognition at 12 which one would you do? Probably cognition. I think the
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_01: notion of so software building as a category is going to grow insanely fast. I think our notion
[00:55:45] SPEAKER_01: from the previous age of venture capital or winner takes it all is wrong and I think this
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_01: category is going to be so big that everybody will take a niche at some point and so I think
[00:56:01] SPEAKER_01: cognition is going to grow have like more room to grow. I also know that like for our time they'll
[00:56:07] SPEAKER_01: be able to either replicate the most successful features inside. I think they have more room to grow
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_01: where betting on Kelser is like betting that it's a winner takes it all market. Why don't you think
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_00: it's a winner take all and if it's not a winner take all does that still work for a venture model
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_00: all businesses predicated on winner take. Not necessarily our business is predicated or the
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_01: venture capital business is predicated on huge returns right. If you look at all of my competitors
[00:56:40] SPEAKER_01: and on base 44 we're all growing insanely fast and I think at least I can say about base 44 but
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_01: maybe the other players like healthy businesses those are going to generate huge returns they're
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_01: all like fast growing businesses and it's not a winner takes it all market which is also by the way
[00:57:00] why I got into this market in the first place. It's like when I started there was like
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_01: Bolton Lavable were like very viral on on social media and I was like this is going to be such a big
[00:57:11] SPEAKER_01: market. I feel like I have a very interesting take on this market with the back and built in
[00:57:16] SPEAKER_01: like focusing on function on complex apps where most of the other players were focusing back then
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_01: like Fontains and maybe connect the Fontains to super base but it was very hard. I think we're at a
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_01: different ballgame where the I is going to generate so much value that markets are going to grow
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_01: very very fast obviously some will get cannibalized but markets are going to go very very fast
[00:57:40] SPEAKER_01: and the VC model is not necessarily a winner takes it all but it's a huge returns type of
[00:57:47] SPEAKER_01: do you think we will hit a speed bump everyone is very concerned about the AI bubble and not
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_00: delivering on the revenue that we promise do you think that we will have a speed bump where there
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_00: is a sign that we don't deliver the revenue that we promise. I think the question is whether it's
[00:58:03] SPEAKER_01: going to turn out to be a platform play which means when building better models the entire ecosystem
[00:58:09] SPEAKER_01: in the market benefits from or whatever what what will happen is like model companies are going to
[00:58:16] SPEAKER_01: fight. Deer margins would get worse and worse because they will need to lower prices.
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_01: Maybe at some point we need to figure out or correct something better in the early
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_01: lens because maybe we'll hit a wall so this will be the bigger bigger question like is the value
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_01: that nowadays GPT-5 to GPT-5.1 adding is only to open the IOs for the rest of the industry
[00:58:42] SPEAKER_01: or the rest of like the market if it's for the rest of the market I don't think we'll hit a speed bump.
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_01: Me personally I don't believe we'll hit a speed bump. I think even with existing models I don't
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_01: think also we'll hit like a wall with like the the problems of the lens but I think even with
[00:58:57] SPEAKER_01: existing models we're only scratching the surface of economic value that you can create.
[00:59:05] SPEAKER_01: If a 1% team can get sold for $80 million and building a viable business and healthy business
[00:59:13] SPEAKER_01: and profitable business without people it means that you'll be able to do a lot more stuff with
[00:59:21] SPEAKER_01: very like less people and that companies will become more efficient and as a result of that every
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: product that we buy is going to be better it's going to be cheaper I think there's so much more
[00:59:37] SPEAKER_01: to do and this was like with the previous version of fellow lens and I've seen what it makes you
[00:59:44] SPEAKER_01: to build a company that needed to raise or was very capital heavy $130 million and like over
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_01: 100 people and I've seen now in the age of fellow lens how how much better it is or easier to
[01:00:01] SPEAKER_01: build a very lean company I was one person and I think this value is going to trickle down from
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_01: enterprises becoming more efficient many more startups because there's no technical barrier anymore
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_01: to eventually the consumer benefiting from from all of those from all this economic value is going
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_01: how many people are in base 44 to say you know I cannot say five minutes before the conversation
[01:00:29] SPEAKER_01: they told me I cannot say numbers or a number of people or whatever really I don't want to
[01:00:34] SPEAKER_00: private but why is that I don't know I think they're waiting for like the universal subdeaks
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_01: what's the interest in yeah I don't know if it's a good thing to have more or less if I was a
[01:00:48] SPEAKER_00: public company I want to say more because it feels more secure to a less educated investor base
[01:00:53] SPEAKER_00: that doesn't think about AI efficiency within dev teams I think the public pockets nowadays are so
[01:01:00] SPEAKER_01: evacuating and it's very hard to like you have to see consistent results I don't think there's
[01:01:07] SPEAKER_01: the stock kind of behaves the same way that like you see inside a business I don't understand
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_00: male if you look at a lovable a reported six billion dollar price on the latest round or a
[01:01:21] SPEAKER_00: rat petted at three to four and I'm sure they'll raise at six soon because they kind of a
[01:01:25] SPEAKER_00: monatic in that way either they are grossly overvalued or wix is grossly undervalued you have to
[01:01:34] SPEAKER_00: take one of those views which one of those uses right my very not objective opinion is that
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_01: wix is very much undervalued today if we've already spoken about this there's also
[01:01:45] SPEAKER_01: put aside the fact of like product assets and a mode there's like a mode in being big and there's
[01:01:51] SPEAKER_01: a mode in having a marketing team and an organization with experience like ours I'm not sure if
[01:01:58] SPEAKER_01: a lovable or a pleat is overvalued I think to to be able to say that I need to look at the like
[01:02:03] SPEAKER_01: the internals and the economics of those the businesses I don't really know those I'm sorry do you
[01:02:07] SPEAKER_00: not track them very I track the revenue and the things they publish but we're focusing on just
[01:02:12] SPEAKER_01: building a very like and this this is something that wix taught me wix for many weers was like
[01:02:18] SPEAKER_01: the underdog of like other players when I came into wix and I was like and those guys are doing
[01:02:26] SPEAKER_01: this and those guys are doing that and then and they're publishing here they're viral here and
[01:02:30] SPEAKER_01: they're like they're copying our features and whatever and like wix's mindset is just like
[01:02:36] build a great product find the right way to market it doesn't matter what others do it's just like
[01:02:41] SPEAKER_01: you see that purely in the business in the metrics you can see like we've released like the new agent
[01:02:47] SPEAKER_01: like the the version of our agent and like you can see the conversion goes up and you can see
[01:02:52] SPEAKER_01: that like the marketing team tests different things some of them didn't make any sense to me before
[01:02:57] SPEAKER_01: hand and you can see how like the unit economics getting getting better or so one thing that wix taught
[01:03:01] SPEAKER_01: me is like focusing your business focus on a great product it's like there's so much noise out there
[01:03:08] SPEAKER_01: I remember like my my first time I first company 40% of my mind was occupied with what competitors
[01:03:15] SPEAKER_01: are doing and oh no the and for me as well or as like how to grasp that the market is so big
[01:03:21] SPEAKER_01: it's like nobody cares it's like as a category or currently capturing like 10% 15% 20% like it takes
[01:03:29] SPEAKER_01: years and ages until you actually grow to like there's so many people that could use base 44 there's
[01:03:35] SPEAKER_01: so many else there's so many people that could use replete and lovable is like focus on your business
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_01: obviously grow as fast as you can but I don't think it's like I'm trying to sniff around what's
[01:03:43] SPEAKER_01: the unit economics and margins and whatever final one before we do a quick fight raplet cursor
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_00: cognition all very silicon valley businesses are you helped or are you hurt by not being in silicon
[01:03:56] SPEAKER_00: honestly I think the world is changing with my previous company I used to fly out every two
[01:04:02] SPEAKER_01: weeks to silicon valley because this is where things would happen and tough I'm not going to do that
[01:04:10] SPEAKER_01: that again I don't think in any way business is hurting if anything I think the war on talent
[01:04:22] SPEAKER_01: is really tough in silicon valley if you're playing the game of get funded as much as you can so that
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_01: you can build for a lot of cash and conquer a lot of like and that's your way of like conquering
[01:04:36] SPEAKER_01: most of the market awesome like this is what where you should be I think for us also weeks is a
[01:04:45] SPEAKER_01: like is a month self like giving us their back and like that they have like this deep pockets and
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_01: they know what to do and they're like that's my silicon valley right that's the backup that they
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_01: need and also you start to see and I think and I have a lot of like great things to say about
[01:05:02] SPEAKER_01: loveable building it from Europe I think the world is changing there's no I want to do a quick
[01:05:08] SPEAKER_00: fire with you so I say short statement you give me your immediate thoughts I have not been enough I
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_00: had plant anav from Robinhood on the show they said 50% of that code is written with AI
[01:05:20] SPEAKER_00: what will that be in two years 95% or 100% for sure it's like you'll be permitting agents I think for us
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_01: and maybe 50% because they have like legacy code and systems for us base 44 was built in the
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_01: region of of of LLM since the rise structure the repository in a way that's going to be very easy
[01:05:44] SPEAKER_01: for LLM to navigate through and to read the code I think for us it's already closer to 90%
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_01: like mostly like prompting agents single biggest advice for someone non-technical wanting to build
[01:05:58] SPEAKER_00: with these tools I listened to you stay genuinely dude and I'm like wow I really want to build
[01:06:03] SPEAKER_00: a tool that allows me to go through all my LinkedIn followers find everyone who has a certain title
[01:06:09] SPEAKER_00: that would suggest they're an LP in investor and funds categorize them and show them to me
[01:06:14] SPEAKER_00: because they clearly have an interest in me already I could outbound them and turn them into an
[01:06:18] SPEAKER_00: LP in my funds I don't know what to start I'm intimidated so first I'll say step zero is like the
[01:06:26] SPEAKER_01: biggest hack of like how you actually build something that later on you'll use or maybe be successful
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_01: which is exactly what you mentioned is like build something for your own problems this is the biggest
[01:06:37] SPEAKER_01: hack that I learned this is the the easiest way to get some like to get a software that's actually
[01:06:42] SPEAKER_01: usable and this is not something I want to go back into doing something that's like for a
[01:06:49] SPEAKER_01: for customer that I interview a lot and understand the pain points is what's so much fun building
[01:06:53] SPEAKER_01: base 44 and so much easier when I had a use case in mind I was like I'm going to build for my partner
[01:06:59] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to build her a CRM and I'm going to kind of like iterate on this software and whatever
[01:07:05] SPEAKER_01: until it hits them out for people starting out with tools like base 44 there's like a mindset
[01:07:13] SPEAKER_01: that you have so one tip that I constantly give out is like there's a mindset that you have to
[01:07:17] SPEAKER_01: get into which is base 44 is not really a person that's like walking for a week and getting
[01:07:22] SPEAKER_01: back to you with like hey this is what I built and so you have to get into a mindset that's like
[01:07:26] SPEAKER_01: very easy it's very easy to revert or start from scratch and so instead of like going into like
[01:07:33] SPEAKER_01: building a PRD and then feeding it into base 44 is like build the fields version that you know
[01:07:39] SPEAKER_01: you're going to throw out and for some people it's like emotionally hard to understand like they're
[01:07:43] SPEAKER_01: going to throw out like tens of thousands of lines of codes it's going to be okay fine but like all
[01:07:48] SPEAKER_01: you need is like figure out the product stuff because once you have the product stuff it's like
[01:07:52] SPEAKER_01: it's for with a few points you get to where you like you got to with like hundreds of forms or
[01:07:56] SPEAKER_01: thousands of forms so iterations is everything is like it's not anymore about like planning a
[01:08:02] SPEAKER_01: head so that you save developer time and very easily hitting the revert button when one feature
[01:08:10] SPEAKER_01: you want it and you played with it's like not something that any get your point was saying okay this
[01:08:14] SPEAKER_01: is not really a good idea it's like iterate very fast and understand it you're not walking with
[01:08:20] SPEAKER_01: the human therefore it's fine to try out different directions or to just give it like a high level
[01:08:27] SPEAKER_01: idea and see what it comes up with and then form the iterate and so you can start with
[01:08:35] SPEAKER_01: like the highest level of points like build something that will help me I don't know engage my
[01:08:40] SPEAKER_01: audience in LinkedIn and see what the LLM does because it will have ideas that it will implement
[01:08:45] SPEAKER_01: inside application and some of those ideas and say oh this is interesting I didn't really thought
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_01: about this like the fact that you can maybe generate I don't know reach out so that you can
[01:08:56] SPEAKER_01: whatever and see and see the things that you didn't like throw those away take it again and then
[01:09:00] SPEAKER_01: prompt it back and say okay build something that will engage my LinkedIn feature one of the features
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_01: that I didn't like is this and that and then like build around that and so the idea that you can
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_01: throw away things that you don't like and start from scratch or revert or go back is very hard for
[01:09:15] SPEAKER_01: people for people to grasp you made 80 million bucks with the sale well done does money make you
[01:09:22] SPEAKER_00: I don't think money makes you happy I think there's two things that money becomes really valuable
[01:09:29] three things one is your time I don't like like fancy cars so I didn't buy a car but like nowadays
[01:09:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm going with a taxi everyone saves two minutes a month of time or other stuff that I can pay
[01:09:42] SPEAKER_01: instead of like doing or wasting my time one and this is a lot of help in like personal stuff
[01:09:48] SPEAKER_01: especially feel like busy people your tapernules and you want to be with your wife or family or
[01:09:52] SPEAKER_01: whatever so this is a huge benefit second is helping people you care about and helping causes
[01:10:00] SPEAKER_01: that you care about which is big is at some points like there's not a big difference between doing
[01:10:06] SPEAKER_01: X million dollars and 10 X million dollars it's more about like okay you can maybe with your
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_01: family and stuff like that you can support and the third when I'm assuming is like you can use
[01:10:20] SPEAKER_01: the money later on to build the bigger stuff or you have this uh more chest that you can say okay
[01:10:30] SPEAKER_01: next thing I'm going to do or when I'm thinking about come like uh the the what I'm going to do in
[01:10:36] SPEAKER_01: a decade for now and it's like okay let's go to space solve cancer build robots or something like that
[01:10:43] SPEAKER_01: as you can do that you can take a risk here that I just want a Gulf Stream dude okay don't get
[01:10:51] SPEAKER_00: all heavy on me fuck that there's some things that get edited out I leave it to the team to see
[01:11:01] SPEAKER_00: whatever they keep the joy is most interviewers yeah they make you look bad and they look make
[01:11:08] SPEAKER_00: like look really innocent themselves I make myself look bad so you look innocent it's a much better
[01:11:13] SPEAKER_00: deal for you those um I think one of my friends told me that there's like a thing
[01:11:19] where uh after we made the money are like uh and we had this discussion among friends and I
[01:11:24] SPEAKER_01: like this doesn't really change your life and and and my friends were like you're using it
[01:11:29] SPEAKER_01: I don't like what do you mean it's like obviously money makes you happy I like you should buy a
[01:11:32] SPEAKER_01: jet ski have ever seen someone said on the jet ski it's like nobody I agree uh open AI at 500
[01:11:42] SPEAKER_00: billion or anthropika 360 billion which one would you rather be a聖 at every day why moving
[01:11:50] SPEAKER_01: faster they correct something and coding they're very focused on the othering value till um be to be
[01:11:56] SPEAKER_01: customers of they don't have the first move of advantage but I think they have better models and
[01:12:02] SPEAKER_01: when they look at their trajectory are the better positioned for growth you can add one person to
[01:12:10] SPEAKER_00: the base 44 board who would you add and what would you like to learn from them wow that's a good
[01:12:17] SPEAKER_01: question uh jack dosy why I think he's one of the most brilliant minds and founders and he can
[01:12:29] SPEAKER_01: see that consistently he builds things sometimes for just the sake of building so he can see it like
[01:12:36] SPEAKER_01: some of like his latest pet projects like this messaging protocol and like stuff like that and I
[01:12:41] SPEAKER_01: think this is a person that consistently like building quid or building square building other
[01:12:47] SPEAKER_01: projects like that's just a mindset of a builder that I think can add tremendous futuristic strategic
[01:12:55] SPEAKER_01: thinking while also I think that the already an a and the thing that we're trying to build in
[01:13:01] SPEAKER_01: base 44 is like a builder mindset and I think this is the like the ultimate for me the ultimate guy
[01:13:08] SPEAKER_01: what thing or event did you sacrifice for work that with the benefit of hindsight you regret
[01:13:14] SPEAKER_00: not necessarily this time around but um in my previous company I think I missed a lot of my 20s
[01:13:23] SPEAKER_01: and I think for the first few years we sacrificed a lot of time with the family and friends
[01:13:30] SPEAKER_01: missing on many like this is like uh many many different occasions and different uh memories
[01:13:38] SPEAKER_01: and I was so inexperienced that I was trying to compensate for my inexperience with overwalking
[01:13:45] SPEAKER_01: which is fine it's like got me to a good place eventually but I sacrificed many things
[01:13:52] SPEAKER_01: in many friends what thing are frontier labs completely delusional about maybe the mot
[01:13:58] that they have they don't have what they think they have I don't know for how they're thinking about
[01:14:04] SPEAKER_01: this but it's like what's the what's the end game for the race right it's like either it's not
[01:14:12] SPEAKER_01: going to be one win or takes it all and there's going to be like more and more companies getting
[01:14:17] SPEAKER_01: into this market it's going to be like the Chinese players that are now like changing the entire market
[01:14:21] SPEAKER_01: dynamics I think eventually it's like if like it takes one better model or lower price
[01:14:32] SPEAKER_01: to drastically reduce your revenue then I think that or at least they used to be delusional about
[01:14:38] SPEAKER_01: this I don't know if they used to be delusional about this maybe they always like they were always
[01:14:42] SPEAKER_01: planning to build come like up the stack I think nowadays they're doing small things for example
[01:14:47] SPEAKER_01: on topic building cloud code SDK I or cloud code like even if now Gemini 3 comes out and it's a
[01:14:54] SPEAKER_01: better model than cloud in sonnet and still there's going to be a huge number of people staying
[01:15:01] SPEAKER_01: with cloud code because they're used to it and they build some things up the stack penultimate one
[01:15:06] SPEAKER_01: you got married very recently what's your biggest advice on partner selection it shouldn't be
[01:15:13] SPEAKER_01: like this person completes me should be someone that is I'm enjoying this at least so much that
[01:15:20] SPEAKER_01: is identical to you my partner is in their own kind of like a field and a panel she likes the
[01:15:31] SPEAKER_01: same thing that I like she's message she has a DHD like me she likes to paint like me this is so
[01:15:40] SPEAKER_01: much fun picking someone that's like you because as an entrepreneur is like you have to have sympathy
[01:15:47] SPEAKER_01: for the person that's like missing day and night and is constantly walking and you have to understand
[01:15:54] SPEAKER_01: deeply why they're doing that and and that's that that that's like a part of them as a person
[01:16:01] SPEAKER_01: same as it's a part of me as a person so I think having the same mindset is crucial it's very very
[01:16:08] SPEAKER_01: hard to date a founder that's like deep into like building the company zero to one and I think
[01:16:16] SPEAKER_01: having a person and a partner that's like having the same mindset that they're building something
[01:16:22] SPEAKER_01: or they build something is making it so much easier to empathize with final one for you my friend
[01:16:28] SPEAKER_00: you can go back to the night before you start base 44 and you can say oh Mayor you should know this
[01:16:34] SPEAKER_00: future self has learned this today what do you go back and tell yourself that you wish you'd
[01:16:40] SPEAKER_00: known when you started when I was when I was by myself it was curious hell I used to wake up
[01:16:47] SPEAKER_01: every two hours in at night just to check that the platform is up and at some point um base 44
[01:16:54] SPEAKER_01: started going really fast and I was still by myself and people started building like businesses
[01:16:59] SPEAKER_01: and applications on top and there was like I remember this week when started like really going up
[01:17:06] SPEAKER_01: and the infrastructure and the thing that I built didn't didn't hold up and so we have like
[01:17:10] SPEAKER_01: many there's like this week or two or three that they had like four incidents where the platform
[01:17:15] SPEAKER_01: would go down and people were like screaming and shouting at me as like I trusted you and whatever
[01:17:21] SPEAKER_01: and I took it very very hard and it was like it was like emotional very very hard and I wish I
[01:17:28] SPEAKER_01: could have told myself like this is just going to be a bump in the road community is going to
[01:17:33] SPEAKER_01: recover from that and eventually it'll be like as it's like this is going to be sustainable this
[01:17:37] SPEAKER_01: is going to be great don't take like don't take the bumps in the road also consumer or the
[01:17:42] SPEAKER_01: consumer market is so much difference like the the emotional spectrum of the feedback that you get
[01:17:48] SPEAKER_01: is so much wider than building a B2B SaaS that you get like some very not not too positive not too
[01:17:56] SPEAKER_01: negative comments I think handling it better emotionally is important I didn't know that
[01:18:03] SPEAKER_01: dude I've so enjoyed this it's a very free flowing discussion you've been amazingly receptive to
[01:18:08] SPEAKER_00: put up with my romantic advice request as well as my alarm rooting requests thank you so much
