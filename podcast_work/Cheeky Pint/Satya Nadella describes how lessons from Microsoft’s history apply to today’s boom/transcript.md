[00:00:00] Bill was always obsessed, I remember him distinctly saying this in the 90s, he said,
[00:00:04] Satya Nadella: there's only one category in software, it's called information management.
[00:00:07] Satya Nadella: You've got to schematize people, places, and things, and that's it.
[00:00:10] Satya Nadella: The problem is, people are messy. Do people have loyalty to a model or do they have loyalty to an AI brand?
[00:00:16] Satya Nadella: You want an ensemble of models. You have agents intermediating that ensemble so that it meets your needs.
[00:00:23] Satya Nadella: Well, Evan's preference not just be for more intelligence, like I'll go into the picker and manually select
[00:00:28] John Collison: O3 for like, where should I go get ice cream query? It's like a right of passage for certain
[00:00:34] John Collison: software companies to try to take on Excel. Why is it so durable? We sort of don't give it enough credit,
[00:00:39] John Collison: it's like I can make it do everything. The world's the world's most approachable programming
[00:00:43] John Collison: environment. 100% and Peter here is who? Peter is Peter level. He's like an Indian. I know I'm
[00:00:48] John Collison: Peter level. I know him. You're so online. Satya knows who Peter level is. This is why Microsoft is
[00:00:53] John Collison: like a 14 trillion dollar company. Was there anything good to see you? The data,
[00:00:59] John Collison: something? Or is this like a lot of racks? It's the most fun place to go, man.
[00:01:06] Satya Nadella: Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft's CEO in 2014, but he's been with the company for more than
[00:01:11] John Collison: 30 years and has seen a lot. Microsoft has grown by 10X in the time that Satya has been running it,
[00:01:17] John Collison: and he's credited with Microsoft's success, first in cloud, and now in the AI boom.
[00:01:21] John Collison: Cheers, John. That was great.
[00:01:25] So what should people be excited about as Ignite? Ignite conference for us more than anything else
[00:01:31] Satya Nadella: is about making sure that AI is getting diffused inside of the enterprise. I mean, if there is one
[00:01:38] Satya Nadella: thing, it's more about, hey, what does it mean not to just admire somebody else's AI factory or AI
[00:01:44] Satya Nadella: agent, but how to build your own AI factory? Organizing the data layer turns out to be probably
[00:01:50] Satya Nadella: the most complicated thing, which spans the enterprise such that it can meet the intelligence.
[00:01:56] Satya Nadella: And so that's the stuff that I think we'll probably do a lot of. We still don't really have
[00:02:02] deep research in a corporate context. We do. That's what Copilot is about.
[00:02:07] John Collison: But most people day-to-day do not have this. So are they just underusing AI that exists?
[00:02:11] John Collison: Yes, in fact, it's interesting you brought that up because to me, that is the killer feature.
[00:02:16] Satya Nadella: Right. So the biggest thing we did was we took this graph that is underneath what is what I think
[00:02:24] Satya Nadella: is the most important database in any company, which is underneath your email, your documents,
[00:02:30] Satya Nadella: your teams calls, what have you. It's the relationships that by the way, people are not working
[00:02:36] Satya Nadella: in an ad hoc fashion in an unstructured way, but they're all doing it in relation of some business
[00:02:42] Satya Nadella: event. That semantic connection is in people's heads and it's lost. And for the first time,
[00:02:49] Satya Nadella: there's much better recall of that. Why do you think this is under penetrated
[00:02:53] John Collison: than the enterprise? Because I feel like people are using lots of, you know, LLAM tools. They are
[00:03:00] John Collison: uploading individual documents maybe, but I don't think most companies have the all-sing, all-dancing,
[00:03:06] John Collison: all of the company's context is plugged into their everyday AI.
[00:03:10] John Collison: Yeah, in fact, I would say there are two sets of things. It's starting, right? I mean, you know,
[00:03:13] Satya Nadella: when I always say, at least compared to anything we have done in terms of all the office
[00:03:18] Satya Nadella: suites over our history, this is the fastest in that sense because it's change management.
[00:03:24] Satya Nadella: At the end of the day, you've got to get it in, people have to use it. Oh, by the way, in the enterprise
[00:03:29] Satya Nadella: setting, it has got to mean all the discovery has to work, all of the data governance has to work,
[00:03:36] Satya Nadella: we have had to plumb this per view into co-pilot such that anytime I'm trying to retrieve something
[00:03:41] Satya Nadella: that's confidential, it's a label confidential, it's IRM, and so on. So there's been a significant
[00:03:46] Satya Nadella: amount of work and that I think is where we're starting to see the uplift. The other thing I'd say is,
[00:03:52] Satya Nadella: you know, it's one thing to do, we have it work across the Microsoft 365 graph, right? But then
[00:03:57] Satya Nadella: the next thing is, oh, what about your ERP system? The connectors kind of work, but they don't.
[00:04:03] Satya Nadella: Really? Because they're two thin straws, right? You just need a much better data architecture,
[00:04:09] Satya Nadella: where you have to essentially, semantically embed all of these into one layer.
[00:04:14] Satya Nadella: Okay. There's been a vision for decades of your company's data at your fingertips. My favorite
[00:04:23] John Collison: example of this is I really like the book Software on the history of Oracle, and it talks about
[00:04:28] John Collison: Larry Allison doing EBCs, I think they're talking about one in Japan in the 1990s. So it's the late 1990s,
[00:04:34] John Collison: and he is pitching executives on all your company's data in one place. Part of the reason this is
[00:04:39] John Collison: an evergreen pitch is because companies don't actually have all their data at their fingertips.
[00:04:44] John Collison: Companies do not eat their data infrastructure of vegetables, and you know, the pitch to executives
[00:04:49] John Collison: always, you can go answer your questions yourself at the touch of a button as opposed to sending a
[00:04:54] John Collison: request to an analyst who goes and does an investigation for you. Will we finally, this time,
[00:04:59] John Collison: eat our data plumbing? You can push back in the premise, but that's my question. So I think,
[00:05:02] John Collison: in fact, I think if I'm not mistaken, Bill coined this term, information radio fingertips
[00:05:08] Satya Nadella: at a calm deck speech, I think in the 1990s. That's right. Yeah. And that is kind of where,
[00:05:13] Satya Nadella: and so we, and for the longest time, Bill was always obsessed about, like he felt that, in fact,
[00:05:18] Satya Nadella: I remember him distinctly saying this in the 90s, which I picked up in one of the reviews I was
[00:05:23] Satya Nadella: in as a junior guy sitting around and he said, there's only one category in software. It's called
[00:05:27] Satya Nadella: information management. You've got to schematize people, places, and things, and that's it. You
[00:05:32] Satya Nadella: don't have to do anything more because all software, and that was the dream Bill always had, which is,
[00:05:36] Satya Nadella: he wanted, like, for example, he hated file systems because he, they were unstructured. He would
[00:05:40] Satya Nadella: have loved it if everything was a sequel database. And he could just do sequel queries and program
[00:05:45] Satya Nadella: against all information. Like that to him was like an elegant solution to information in your
[00:05:50] Satya Nadella: figurative. The problem is people are messy. And even if people data is structured, it sort of
[00:05:57] Satya Nadella: is not truly available in one index, right? Or one sequel query that I can run again install
[00:06:04] Satya Nadella: of that. So that has been the fundamental challenge of the old world, I would say. I would have
[00:06:09] Satya Nadella: not thought, not of us thought, that somehow this AI thing and a deep neural network at some
[00:06:17] Satya Nadella: scaling will suddenly become the thing that figures out the patterns, right? Not some schematized
[00:06:23] Satya Nadella: data model. In fact, one of the longest time used to always obsess about, oh, how complex do
[00:06:29] Satya Nadella: the relationships have to be, or the data model needs to be to capture the essence of an enterprise,
[00:06:35] Satya Nadella: right? And it turns out it's a lot of parameters in a neural network with a lot of compute power.
[00:06:41] John Collison: George Keshe talks about this release of our motion employee who started five minutes ago,
[00:06:45] John Collison: getting at the point of the models can be arbitrarily smart. And they can do rag and they can
[00:06:49] John Collison: have access to everything in your enterprise, but it's not quite the same as the model actually knowing
[00:06:56] John Collison: something as a model. And so the models, unless you train custom models inside your company,
[00:07:01] John Collison: cannot actually get smarter at what it is that you do. And the thousands of queries, not any
[00:07:06] John Collison: smart, are the first. Where do you think that goes? I think the two things there, I think, I mean,
[00:07:12] Satya Nadella: if I understand his thing, it's all about in context learning or continual learning.
[00:07:16] Satya Nadella: Yes, right. I mean, that's sort of the ultimate thing. And it sort of speaks to the thing I
[00:07:21] Satya Nadella: was saying, which is if you kind of have the models cognitive core separated from its knowledge,
[00:07:26] Satya Nadella: then you have essentially the continual learning formulas. Yes, yes.
[00:07:30] Satya Nadella: The algorithm. And then you just unleash it. At least there are three things to me that are outside
[00:07:37] Satya Nadella: of the model at runtime that I think you kind of have to crack. One is memory. And all forms of memory,
[00:07:45] Satya Nadella: short, long, even like these big challenges of humans are great at long-term credit
[00:07:51] Satya Nadella: assignment, which is how does intuitively, like somebody said to behave the day AI models
[00:07:58] Satya Nadella: can both reward and remember that you how to punish for some mistake because they have the ability
[00:08:06] Satya Nadella: to do long-term credit assignment. That's when you'll know they have real memory. But in any case,
[00:08:10] Satya Nadella: memories one, the second one is entitlements, right? So, which is they have to really respect
[00:08:17] Satya Nadella: all of the permissioning system at runtime, right? Because this is where, because they're
[00:08:21] Satya Nadella: roles, what access do I have? And so the model needs to meet that. And then the action space
[00:08:28] Satya Nadella: all has to work. So, if you bring those three things, because after all, that's the environment.
[00:08:32] Satya Nadella: So, if I have actions, entitlements, and memory with these models, and they have, by definition,
[00:08:37] Satya Nadella: have to be outside of the model, but be built into the model. And I think that's, for example,
[00:08:42] Satya Nadella: in Copilot today, you use OpenAI models, you use even Claude, right? I need the system to work
[00:08:48] Satya Nadella: across both of those. And that, I think, is where the frontier has to move to. Yes, yes.
[00:08:53] Satya Nadella: I've built more AI questions, but I want to ask you some questions about your way of working.
[00:08:59] John Collison: So, what does your day stay look like? And in particular, how are you managing by walking around
[00:09:05] John Collison: what virtual corridors are you wandering to just get a sense for what's going on on Microsoft?
[00:09:12] John Collison: What are your customer engagements actually look like just for a normal day? Not earnings or
[00:09:16] John Collison: not a board meeting or something. Interesting enough, my normal day is it's the two ends of it,
[00:09:22] Satya Nadella: which is the customer stuff. So, there's not a day that I would say I'm not having, many of them
[00:09:29] Satya Nadella: are involved in this. Teams calls for me most of the day, at least two or three of them,
[00:09:34] Satya Nadella: with some customer. It's sort of the most helpful way for me to stay most grounded, I would say.
[00:09:41] Satya Nadella: So, I have at least one or two of those each day. And then, I'd say there is a lot of meeting time.
[00:09:49] Satya Nadella: As a CEO, one of the things I've recognized is there are two types of meetings. One meeting is where
[00:09:58] Satya Nadella: I'm just supposed to convene and keep my mouth shut because convening was the real thing.
[00:10:03] Satya Nadella: It is like don't overperform and just sit and because all the work would have either happened
[00:10:08] Satya Nadella: or will happen after. So, that's kind of one. And then the other meeting, which are the important
[00:10:14] Satya Nadella: meetings where I do need to learn or I need to make a decision or communicate something. So,
[00:10:18] Satya Nadella: meetings is another spot. Then, I must say it's kind of like all over for me, Teams channels.
[00:10:25] Satya Nadella: Right. I am lingering around Teams channels. And they're most helpful. In fact, if anything,
[00:10:32] Satya Nadella: I learn the most there, I meet most people there. So, wandering the halls, I wish I can tell you
[00:10:38] Satya Nadella: that that is the form. But I think Teams is the new wandering the halls. I know that is.
[00:10:44] Satya Nadella: Around the channel. 100%. And then, I meet. The most beautiful thing is for me to be able to,
[00:10:49] Satya Nadella: that's where I make the most connections. I get to know out, he's the person working on Excel agent.
[00:10:55] Satya Nadella: Oh, that's the evil that they're looking. I mean, I learn so much out of it than anything else
[00:11:00] John Collison: I've done. So, our Teams at Microsoft just working away on their product and then Satya pops up and
[00:11:05] John Collison: you know, has a question on their product. Some of it. Like, I wish. I wish. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I wish.
[00:11:10] Satya Nadella: Sometimes I feel like we're way too permissioned. I wish I had more access. Sometimes, in fact,
[00:11:15] Satya Nadella: my biggest complaint is that I can't drop it everywhere I want to. But yes, it's fun to be able to
[00:11:22] Satya Nadella: just go in there. And it sort of normalizes it. And then people are also sharing their opinion with
[00:11:31] Satya Nadella: you. I've noticed that. Yeah. You are famous, at least in small corners of the valley, speaking of
[00:11:38] John Collison: being methodical for staying very connected to what's going on in tech here. And I remember you came
[00:11:46] John Collison: and visited the Stripe Office. Remember that one mission? Yeah. And we were a Pipsqueak company.
[00:11:50] John Collison: I mean, we were probably right after you took over a CEO, I'm guessing. But Stripe is very small.
[00:11:57] John Collison: Microsoft was very big. Actually, before, I think the first time I came to your offices was when I was
[00:12:01] Satya Nadella: running Azure first. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it was even before that. So that would be very
[00:12:05] John Collison: early in in Stripe's journey. Why do you think you do this much more than most other CEOs?
[00:12:11] John Collison: Because other CEOs should want to meet all the startups too. I've always grown up. In some sense,
[00:12:16] Satya Nadella: I grew up even in a Microsoft which had, I have that developer relations, evangelism,
[00:12:23] Satya Nadella: sort of gene in me. I kind of approach. I think a lot of it as, hey, if you don't follow developers,
[00:12:29] Satya Nadella: there are two sort of things that are ingrained in me. One is, if you don't follow where developers
[00:12:33] Satya Nadella: are going, it's hard to sort of be relevant in terms of tech platforms. And then you really need
[00:12:39] Satya Nadella: to understand the new workload in order to build a tech platform. Those are the two things that at least I
[00:12:45] Satya Nadella: kept. And so therefore, the only way, if you're not following startups, it's very hard to know what
[00:12:50] Satya Nadella: is either the platform or the workload. So that's sort of a thing that I've indexed towards.
[00:12:55] Satya Nadella: The other thing is it's just, you know, I derived so much energy out of it. I mean, I've always thought
[00:13:00] Satya Nadella: founders and just magical people who create something from nothing. I mean, it just sort of feels
[00:13:04] Satya Nadella: like a magic trick. So I always think how the heck does one do that? Yeah. It's funny. You say that
[00:13:09] John Collison: about following what the startups are doing. We all those conceives of what Stripe was building
[00:13:17] John Collison: as it was important to build for startups both because today's small startups are tomorrow's
[00:13:22] John Collison: public companies. And we've seen that again, again, on Stripe. But we just felt at an intuitive level.
[00:13:26] John Collison: When we felt this before we could prove it, that what the startups were interested in were often
[00:13:32] John Collison: better product experiences. And so if the startups want stable coins or usage-based billing or what
[00:13:39] John Collison: have you, we should build for those needs, not just because we'll have a good startup business,
[00:13:44] John Collison: but the enterprises will come around. And it took us, I would say, many years to kind of prove
[00:13:48] John Collison: out that model. But now we're really seeing. You know, in fact, I think you guys are a bit of a
[00:13:53] Satya Nadella: gold standard on that. In fact, one of the things that I learned from you guys was that
[00:13:57] Satya Nadella: that I did rediscovering at some level what Microsoft was very good at, which is following the developer,
[00:14:02] Satya Nadella: being where the startups are. And so that's what sort of led me even to GitHub and that and all
[00:14:09] Satya Nadella: of the rest, which is to some degree, the GitHub asset, right? I'll be serious, a great asset. We
[00:14:15] Satya Nadella: needed to one be good storage of an open source ecosystem. Yes. But it also the place where every startup,
[00:14:20] Satya Nadella: like the one thing that everybody does have is their repos in GitHub. And I felt like,
[00:14:27] Satya Nadella: being in that loop was important for us, not just, oh, it's strategically great to have some
[00:14:34] Satya Nadella: position there, to learn simply, and to build better product, I think is sort of well said. Because
[00:14:40] Satya Nadella: the lose sometimes the aesthetic of what is required, what's that friction-free way to deliver,
[00:14:46] Satya Nadella: because the least amount of patience is there. And the time to value, for example, has to be
[00:14:51] Satya Nadella: maximized. Is Microsoft thinking about generated UIs that are personalized, like when you think about
[00:14:57] John Collison: this, software is stuck in the old paradigm of, you know, we write a bunch of software and it
[00:15:02] John Collison: goes to Goldmaster and it, you know, it goes out on disks. And now that same kind of software
[00:15:06] John Collison: is delivered in the cloud, but the UI you want is probably, you know, we can render that exact
[00:15:12] John Collison: UI in real time. Is that a direction you guys would come up with? I think for sure. At some level,
[00:15:17] Satya Nadella: what's happening is on one side, our ability to generate, I mean, if you sort of say you can
[00:15:22] Satya Nadella: generate all code, so therefore you can generate some UX scaffolding around anything that's a lot more
[00:15:28] Satya Nadella: custom, right? So especially, in fact, for the longest time, one of the things that Microsoft was,
[00:15:34] Satya Nadella: what's the difference between a document, a website, and an application, really? And so,
[00:15:41] Satya Nadella: to some degree, yeah, exactly. So you can generate any one of those at any time, depending on what
[00:15:47] Satya Nadella: format you want to present it. But at the same time, interestingly enough, for all the talk of,
[00:15:53] Satya Nadella: hey, all these apps go, take even our good old IDEs. In some sense, IDEs are back, right,
[00:16:01] Satya Nadella: whether it's Excel or, or which, we as code, because the reality is AI generates output. Yep.
[00:16:09] Satya Nadella: I need to make sense of that output. In fact, I need a fantastic editor that lets me do DIFs
[00:16:17] Satya Nadella: and iterations on it with AI. So the idea, I think, in fact, one of the most exciting things is
[00:16:24] Satya Nadella: new classes of highly refined IDs that have even a sort of a telemetry loop with the intelligence
[00:16:31] Satya Nadella: layer. But also, they kind of act more like heads up displays, right? I have thousands of agents
[00:16:36] Satya Nadella: going off. How am I going to make sense of the micro steering of thousands of agents?
[00:16:43] Satya Nadella: And that is what IDEs, slash inboxes, and messaging tools will be, right? Which is, I'm not
[00:16:48] Satya Nadella: messaging one type, one, you know, or dealing with triage of the way I deal with it today, but
[00:16:53] Satya Nadella: it's going to be different. Okay, interesting. So you think, right now, programmers spend all their time
[00:16:57] John Collison: in an IDE, but they're one of the few professions that does that. And your vision is the accountant
[00:17:03] John Collison: IDE, the lawyer IDE, and what is the metaphor of how I will work with agents, right? So it's kind
[00:17:08] Satya Nadella: of like massive macro delegation, right? So there's lots of agents, I go and give a bunch of
[00:17:13] Satya Nadella: instructions to, and they go off and work sometimes for hours, days, let's say, you know, as the models
[00:17:18] Satya Nadella: get better. But they are checking in. And so it's macro delegation micro steering. Yeah. So if you
[00:17:24] Satya Nadella: take that, where does, how does one do micro steering with context, right? It can't come back like,
[00:17:30] Satya Nadella: it can't mean the next notification hell, right? Which is, it sort of notifies me. It has like
[00:17:34] Satya Nadella: five words. I don't know exactly what the real context is or what have you. That, I think,
[00:17:40] Satya Nadella: is where, and that has to be multi app like, right? So that's where I feel like all software
[00:17:46] Satya Nadella: finally when it grows up, it looks like an inbox and a messaging tool. And it can't
[00:17:50] Satya Nadella: be with the blinking screen except this time around. A lot of work got, you know, where to happen.
[00:17:55] Satya Nadella: Is that one app? Is that 10 different apps? Like, it's kind of interesting if you think about
[00:18:00] John Collison: the productivity, speech that emerged. There was, you know, three big apps in, where is Excel and
[00:18:08] John Collison: PowerPoint. But it's interesting that that number was not one and was not 40. It was three. And so
[00:18:15] John Collison: how do you think about this? I think that that's right. I mean, to me, it will be a few, I think. And
[00:18:21] Satya Nadella: in fact, the reductionist person, you know, in me, it says, man, they'll be the same things.
[00:18:26] Satya Nadella: Except the job they do is going to be different. Because I think, you know, a table,
[00:18:31] Satya Nadella: at least as the human level, right? Because we can all talk about like, what tools will agents use
[00:18:36] Satya Nadella: to communicate with each other? Right? That's a different thing, right? Right now, for the RL loop,
[00:18:42] Satya Nadella: they are simulating our production environment. But they will ultimately be more efficient in
[00:18:48] Satya Nadella: creating their own production environments to kind of RL themselves. But let's just leave that
[00:18:53] Satya Nadella: aside. But in order to communicate with us, I feel like we have discovered some good things that we
[00:19:00] Satya Nadella: like. We like spreadsheets and tables. And we like documents in sort of linear form. We like inboxes
[00:19:08] Satya Nadella: or messaging tools. So these are like reasonable UIs. Except the question, I think you asked is,
[00:19:15] Satya Nadella: how does this thing have when it shows up in an IDE with like a set of changes? You have to
[00:19:21] Satya Nadella: help me more than just say, okay, now here is a file, go to that file, like that directed plan,
[00:19:28] Satya Nadella: not just to execute. But for me to do my workflow. Like one of the things that we are experimenting
[00:19:34] Satya Nadella: with is mission control and get up copilot is that, right? Which is, the idea is you go have five,
[00:19:39] Satya Nadella: six different branches in which you fire off all these autonomous agents. They all do their work.
[00:19:44] Satya Nadella: They come back and then your ability to do PR triage is where I think the next idea is born.
[00:19:51] Satya Nadella: I'm struck by a technology how frequently you see the pattern of excitement for and a vision
[00:19:59] John Collison: around a technology being so much earlier than the technology actually being ready. Like the movie
[00:20:05] John Collison: 2001 The Space Odyssey, which is in the 60s. Like that was a voice activated AI with tool use,
[00:20:10] John Collison: you know, capabilities. And it just took 50 years. And then people were excited about the idea
[00:20:18] John Collison: that you could speak to your computer and your text to speech to text. People were excited about
[00:20:22] John Collison: that in the 80s. And only now, I don't know if you're super whisperer or anything like that.
[00:20:27] John Collison: But it's really, it's finally really good. But it wasn't good three years ago, 40 years after the
[00:20:33] John Collison: vision. It's crazy how you bring that up. In fact, I used to have an apartment right next to the
[00:20:38] Satya Nadella: Microsoft campus, that old campus. And I was working on interactive television. This was in
[00:20:42] Satya Nadella: 1994. Yeah. The information super highway. That's right. You know, and there are multiple things
[00:20:49] Satya Nadella: that are studying. My management chain was rick ratcheted who sort of, you know, who reported
[00:20:54] Satya Nadella: to Craig Mundy, who reported to Nathan Merwald. And there was Bill Gates that I was saying, man,
[00:20:58] Satya Nadella: that's a lot of IQ. And of course, we all miss the internet. That is the only thing that's happened.
[00:21:04] Satya Nadella: But I had interactive television. Yes. Switched ATM, I think, to my home. Yeah. In my apartment. So
[00:21:11] Satya Nadella: I had, I remember doing this demo. One of the high stinks things I did as a young guy at Microsoft
[00:21:17] Satya Nadella: was a demo of our first redundant file system, which was the video server where John Malone was the
[00:21:24] Satya Nadella: one who came and sort of, Bill was sort of saying, hey, here's the future of interactive television.
[00:21:29] Satya Nadella: Yes. Yes. Well, it's even great because the disk can go, you know, hair wire and still stream.
[00:21:35] Satya Nadella: And so my job was to remove the disk drive and have the stream continue. But we built essentially
[00:21:41] Satya Nadella: a distributed file system. Yes. And a streaming server. And had an ATM switch network to the house.
[00:21:47] Satya Nadella: And I had like five movies I could watch and I watched them all multiple times.
[00:21:50] Satya Nadella: Okay. So I want to ask you about this because I've talked a lot about this and you're the perfect
[00:21:54] John Collison: person to ask, which is Microsoft saw the internet future that was coming in the 90s. And in
[00:22:04] John Collison: particular, the famous Bill Gates internet title wave memo said, the internet is the one big thing
[00:22:10] John Collison: Microsoft needs to focus on. It wasn't like we're not thinking about the internet. It wasn't
[00:22:13] John Collison: that it was priority number seven of 15. It was like, hey guys, listen up. The only thing Microsoft
[00:22:18] John Collison: should be thinking about is the internet. But the vision for the internet at the time was this
[00:22:24] John Collison: information super highway, which is subtly different from the internet because the thinking was
[00:22:28] John Collison: and it was very sensible thinking, no one has internet to the computer in their home, like a lot of
[00:22:32] John Collison: people don't have a computer in their home. So what people do have is a TV and what they have is
[00:22:35] John Collison: cable, which is a high buttoned with connection. And so we're going to do these set top boxes
[00:22:40] John Collison: on the TV. And that is how people use the internet. Like paying a huge amount of attention to this
[00:22:46] John Collison: coming wave, pretty sensible well thought out solution. And yes, not the right approach. And so
[00:22:52] John Collison: I've seen bring that up in the context of the giant AI. Like what should one take away from me?
[00:22:57] John Collison: So if I look at even my interpretation, it would be actually interesting. I'm not
[00:23:01] Satya Nadella: to spend as much time talking to Bill about that era. And but I felt they were at least as someone
[00:23:07] Satya Nadella: as a sort of entry level employee at that time, even my reading of history was that we
[00:23:15] Satya Nadella: kind of got the internet, but we didn't. Because we wanted to deliver. Remember the quality,
[00:23:22] Satya Nadella: I don't think we believe that TCP IP would work. I mean, at some level, the information highway,
[00:23:29] Satya Nadella: when I look at what we were trying to do was man, this quality of service is a thing, this TCP IP,
[00:23:35] Satya Nadella: what it's just is not going to work. And so therefore, we were competing against AOL on
[00:23:41] Satya Nadella: dial up. And even that sort of, you remember like MSN was an extra 25 network.
[00:23:46] Satya Nadella: Yes, the first version of it. And so then, but that's when Bill like pivoted, right? So the thing
[00:23:52] Satya Nadella: that Bill did was in 95, I guess, in fact, it's funny that right, the Windows 95 was launching.
[00:24:00] Satya Nadella: And then he says, you know what, it's all going to change. So I feel between 92, which is when
[00:24:07] Satya Nadella: I think all of us maybe got our first demo, right? 93 November is when music,
[00:24:12] Satya Nadella: yeah, right? I think something like that. And so we all, you know, we're kind of dancing around it.
[00:24:16] Satya Nadella: So from 93 to 95, there was that two-year period where it was unclear whether this was going to be
[00:24:25] Satya Nadella: the protocol and the full stack and the stack emerged. And by 95 it was clear. And then we pivoted.
[00:24:32] John Collison: Interesting. Okay, so just at that time, it wasn't actually clear that the open internet would win.
[00:24:37] John Collison: Yes. And in fact, there's one more lesson that the interesting thing that I've always watched
[00:24:42] Satya Nadella: and because I think we can parlay this into AI, one is to get the paradigm right.
[00:24:46] Satya Nadella: Yes. Then it's not clear, even if you get the paradigm right, that you may not get what is the
[00:24:52] Satya Nadella: killer app or even the business model. Or what, like that's always been the case, right? Which is,
[00:24:58] Satya Nadella: with the internet, who would have thought that, you know, for the open web, an organizing layer
[00:25:04] Satya Nadella: would be one-proprite or one network effect search engine, right? Because they're organizing
[00:25:10] Satya Nadella: layer of the web, you know, I always say, like there's no such thing as the open web. There's
[00:25:15] Satya Nadella: the Google web. And just because they just dominated it. Should one reflect on the fact that
[00:25:22] John Collison: maybe there was some motivated thinking around our proprietary solution, you know, the Liberty
[00:25:31] John Collison: Media Microsoft joint venture will win. Whereas the open web is what one. And you should maybe caution
[00:25:40] John Collison: organizations where if they're following two possibilities, you know, our information super
[00:25:45] John Collison: highway proprietary system or the open web, companies will somehow have happy thinking towards
[00:25:54] John Collison: the proprietary solution. So you just see what I think the way, you know, when I look back again,
[00:25:58] Satya Nadella: it's interesting, right? So, AOL and MSN kind of, you know, lost outlets call it to the open web.
[00:26:06] Satya Nadella: Except they were replaced by new forms of AOL and MSN. They're called search engines.
[00:26:13] Satya Nadella: They're called app stores. Like the mobile web in fact is fascinating. The open web was a moment in
[00:26:18] Satya Nadella: history. A moment in history. And so the thing that maybe the matter thing for me is organizing layers
[00:26:25] Satya Nadella: will always emerge even in an open ecosystem. And a lot of the category power moves to that
[00:26:32] Satya Nadella: organizing layer. And it's always unclear. Like the last paradigm of, well, this last time at a
[00:26:37] Satya Nadella: search engine today, it's chatbots, is it? Is it how long lasting is that? No one knows.
[00:26:42] Satya Nadella: But it's definitely today. I mean, chat GPT success cannot be denied in terms of what it means
[00:26:49] Satya Nadella: as an aggregation point. Marketplaces, app stores, I've been a thing. What's comes next? You know,
[00:26:56] Satya Nadella: what happens to e-commerce in an agentic marketplace? Oh, an agentic commerce. I think these are the
[00:27:02] Satya Nadella: interesting things that need to be litigated. Well, I want to talk about that in a one-topic
[00:27:06] John Collison: commerce. But actually first, while we're still in the 90s, everyone is making comparisons to the
[00:27:12] John Collison: dot com bubble right now. It's almost a cliche. And I think it's actually a reasonable
[00:27:16] John Collison: comparison. You know, it's a cliche for a reason, which is it is a very
[00:27:21] John Collison: capex intensive build-house for a new paradigm that is in fact a big deal. And yet there's an awful
[00:27:28] John Collison: lot of capex. You were there at Microsoft during the 2000 dot com bubble. And it really was,
[00:27:36] John Collison: you know, Microsoft share price peaked in the late 90s, early 2000s, and then didn't surpass it
[00:27:41] John Collison: until 2016, I want to say. What did it feel like in 1999? In particular, did you know you were in
[00:27:49] John Collison: a bubble or was it like, oh, this is the new, this time it's different. It's interesting. Yeah. So
[00:27:54] Satya Nadella: in fact, I remember I think we probably became the largest market cap company in 2000. We'd
[00:28:00] Satya Nadella: cross gee. I remember that. You know, we were capital-light, let's say, right? That time around,
[00:28:06] Satya Nadella: it was like, I guess I was more like Sam at that time, which is somebody else's capital was being
[00:28:11] Satya Nadella: spent. It was quite honestly when I look back at it, at that time too, the financial cycle aside,
[00:28:21] Satya Nadella: it was clear. The secular trend was clear that this is going to because even the
[00:28:28] Satya Nadella: the business models were also emerging, right? Even for Microsoft, the biggest lesson at that time
[00:28:35] Satya Nadella: was, oh my god, like even our first order play, oh, we got to build a browser, we got to build a
[00:28:41] Satya Nadella: web server, we've got to, you know, have internet protocols everywhere. Oh, we got, we, you know,
[00:28:47] Satya Nadella: we had a web site builder inside of office with front page. We did all the obvious things,
[00:28:53] Satya Nadella: but we realized that just doing the obvious things didn't make sense. We needed to reinvent what
[00:28:58] Satya Nadella: we were doing. Plus, what are the new business models was clear. So in an interesting way, that cycle
[00:29:05] Satya Nadella: kind of came out of nowhere. I mean, it came out of, you know, what was just, you know, whatever,
[00:29:11] Satya Nadella: rational exuberance or what have you. But the correction in some sense washed away a bunch of
[00:29:19] Satya Nadella: stuff, but I would say the idea is persisted. Right? And so to me, I think about what's happening
[00:29:25] Satya Nadella: here, I mean, there are two things, right? The infrastructure itself that's getting laid out.
[00:29:30] Satya Nadella: I think it's got a lot more immediate, like it's not like even the, you know, the gestation period of,
[00:29:37] Satya Nadella: okay, I built up, you know, dark fiber, which, and you know, some internet company will first
[00:29:42] Satya Nadella: scale to a billion users and use this time. This time belongs out the door to buy this stuff. Exactly.
[00:29:47] Satya Nadella: And so this time around, quite frankly, we're behind, right? It was not that, like when I look at
[00:29:52] Satya Nadella: our infrastructure build, right, and demand today, that's the thing that when people say it's all,
[00:29:57] Satya Nadella: you know, there's a bubble like when I look at my earnings, I can have like, I mean, this is the last,
[00:30:01] Satya Nadella: there was a last time I was so supply constrained on power shelves. I haven't heard that comparison
[00:30:07] John Collison: before, which is let's not forget that the dot com bubble, which again was a telecoms bubble,
[00:30:12] John Collison: it was a fiber bubble in a big way. Like it was dark fiber. It was, it was, it was in the name,
[00:30:18] John Collison: it was dark. It was not lit up yet. And this is anything but dark fiber. Yeah, it's not like
[00:30:23] Satya Nadella: any one of us is sitting there and saying, Hey, I have all the GPUs wired up, right? And nobody's
[00:30:28] Satya Nadella: using them. I don't have a utilization problem. I may have a PUE, like, I mean, I want higher utilization
[00:30:34] Satya Nadella: because it's mostly because it's memory bottleneck or whatever, but that is a different, like there
[00:30:39] Satya Nadella: is not a thing that I have that's not sold out. In fact, my problem is I got to bring more supply.
[00:30:45] Satya Nadella: And in that will be perfectly get it, like no one does, right? There's no supply chain operation
[00:30:51] Satya Nadella: that perfectly matches demand and supply. But this time around the build out, you know, they're
[00:30:57] Satya Nadella: given the long lead. Like, for example, one of the things we study a lot is, even when we talk
[00:31:02] Satya Nadella: about our capital, we try to describe it even to the street. Hey, you got to remember these assets,
[00:31:07] Satya Nadella: some of these assets are 20 years. Yeah. Some of these things are four years or five years.
[00:31:13] Satya Nadella: And in fact, you kind of have to make the decisions on those things differently, right?
[00:31:18] Satya Nadella: Having a coal shell that's unused is nothing, right? It's like, yeah, it's kind of like having
[00:31:25] Satya Nadella: campus with five buildings. It's not sort of going to be a problem on Microsoft's balance sheet.
[00:31:29] Satya Nadella: What was our real problem would be, hey, not having warm shells that we can kind of light up?
[00:31:37] Where is the bottleneck these days? Like, is it electricians? Is it shells?
[00:31:41] John Collison: Yeah, I mean, so it turbines. Yeah, the product that is the bottleneck is just a bunch of
[00:31:48] Satya Nadella: powered up shells, right? So if I don't have enough shells that are powered that I can then
[00:31:55] Satya Nadella: roll in my racks and then break them operational. And that's the long lead part, right? Which is you
[00:32:01] Satya Nadella: kind of have to have the land permits, the power permits, get all that done in time. And by the way,
[00:32:08] Satya Nadella: location, right? So I think one of the things that's glossed over, of course, stateside,
[00:32:13] Satya Nadella: United States, we're building a lot. But we have to build all over the world. And there are
[00:32:20] Satya Nadella: data regulations. In fact, more every day, people care about sovereignty in a major, major way.
[00:32:27] Satya Nadella: And so therefore, for us, we have to make sure that the fleet is a global fleet,
[00:32:32] Satya Nadella: a fleet that kind of can deal with all types of workloads, training to data,
[00:32:37] Satya Nadella: to end to inference. And so it's a complex multi variable thing.
[00:32:42] Who should care about data sovereignty? Where Ireland has a bunch of data centers,
[00:32:49] John Collison: but is not particularly wound up on the idea that data should only be in Ireland. And I don't
[00:32:54] John Collison: think it should be super wound up about that fact. But I guess, do you guys just go with whatever
[00:32:59] John Collison: the country wants or do you try to advise on whether you should want data sovereignty or not?
[00:33:04] John Collison: And who should? Yeah. So I think it's obviously a topic that's top of mind for pretty much every
[00:33:10] Satya Nadella: country, every policy maker. And they care. And it there is obviously real legitimate reasons.
[00:33:15] Satya Nadella: The thing that I would say in the AI age, I'm now thinking a little bit differently when
[00:33:19] Satya Nadella: it was sovereignty. What I mean by that is the ultimate sovereignty question is more of the,
[00:33:24] Satya Nadella: what's the future of a corporation? Right? Like I mean, if you sort of start by, you know,
[00:33:28] Satya Nadella: if you go to the core of the course theorem, you say, wow, what the heck, you know, if the model
[00:33:35] Satya Nadella: is the thing that knows everything, why do I even, like, I'm supposed to have some tacit knowledge
[00:33:41] Satya Nadella: that makes the transactional costs inside my organization lower than just being in the marketplace.
[00:33:48] Satya Nadella: So that's a, there are mindbenders. So in fact, one of the ways I think is the sovereignty that
[00:33:53] Satya Nadella: matters is your company sovereignty and age where there are continued learning increasing returns
[00:33:58] Satya Nadella: to a model. So I'm increasingly thinking that, hey, company's ability to have that intelligence
[00:34:05] Satya Nadella: layer that's a scaffold or even weights embedded in the model. Like, so it's not somebody else's
[00:34:11] Satya Nadella: foundation model. It's about do you have sovereignty in your foundation model? So my new concept is
[00:34:18] Satya Nadella: the future of a company is that company has its own foundation model that captures essentially
[00:34:24] Satya Nadella: the tacit knowledge that makes the transactional costs of how knowledge gets accrued and
[00:34:30] Satya Nadella: diffused inside the organization faster. So that's sort of a long speech on sovereignty.
[00:34:37] John Collison: There's two versions that's very interesting. The idea that,
[00:34:41] John Collison: AI maybe just changes the nature of companies. And you're saying that if companies,
[00:34:49] John Collison: some companies are already collections of IP, right? Disney or, which is a Daverix from Elyly here,
[00:34:57] John Collison: that is an IP company in a big way. And some companies are already collections of IP. But right now
[00:35:04] John Collison: that IP is in all the emails and documents and people's heads most importantly, whereas maybe the
[00:35:12] the IP could be in a single model over time. Right. Thought you were going to go with this is just
[00:35:19] John Collison: maybe the, you know, people point out a lot that current companies are modeled after, you know,
[00:35:25] John Collison: manufacturing companies and Alfred Sloan type stuff despite the fact that, you know, we're doing
[00:35:31] John Collison: knowledge work today and not running a little manufacturing line. And do you get more just
[00:35:36] John Collison: weird looking companies? Do you get the, you know, the famous really tiny billion dollar company?
[00:35:40] John Collison: Do you get more highly distributed internet companies? Do you get some dows? I thought that's
[00:35:44] John Collison: where you're going to go with that. Those are also possibilities. So the structure itself could change
[00:35:49] Satya Nadella: and it's going to be more possible for, you know, whatever the few, you know, the one person,
[00:35:54] Satya Nadella: billion dollar company, what have you? That may not happen or dows could happen. But the interesting
[00:36:00] Satya Nadella: question at least for me is, where does tacit knowledge reside? Yes. Right. Clearly it resides in
[00:36:08] Satya Nadella: people's heads and it's the classic know-how that are crews and compounds. Yes. I think it will
[00:36:16] Satya Nadella: also reside and compound as weights in some Laura layer that is unique to your company. Yeah.
[00:36:23] Satya Nadella: So that's kind of my, so in fact, I feel like, you know, the new intellectual property. Yes.
[00:36:30] Satya Nadella: Adelae Lillie or a Microsoft or a Stripe at some point can be also, besides all the humans,
[00:36:38] Satya Nadella: besides all the other artifacts we have. Yes. I think we will also say, oh, they are in some
[00:36:43] Satya Nadella: embedding. Yes. Well, okay, it's funny to say this because Stripe is interesting because it does
[00:36:49] John Collison: not really have strong network effects as a company, you know, when we started building up Stripe,
[00:36:55] John Collison: is very much a single player API experience and we make it easy to start using Stripe. But ultimately,
[00:37:02] John Collison: you never know that anyone else was using Stripe. What's happened as we've scaled up is we now just
[00:37:07] John Collison: have a trust network where we can prevent fraud by virtue of the fact that we've seen most internet
[00:37:13] John Collison: users. And so we have a knowledge for what good and bad looks like. And even the fact that we haven't
[00:37:19] John Collison: seen you before is inherently a little bit suspicious because we've seen, we've seen most people.
[00:37:24] John Collison: And so it becomes a reputation network, kind of like I'm recapture for Google,
[00:37:27] John Collison: yeah, it simply became kind of a reputation network. Anyway, what we're now doing is training a
[00:37:32] John Collison: Payments Foundation model where we're using all the data that we have in the Stripe network. And
[00:37:36] John Collison: you have a much larger, more capable model taking a drug. So anyway, we are trying to do exactly
[00:37:41] John Collison: what you're saying. And so one of the questions for all of us who have, so Len, how do you protect that?
[00:37:47] Satya Nadella: From sort of essentially leaking over to the base foundation model. Is it just like one
[00:37:53] Satya Nadella: capability hop away because it learned how do we even do fraud detection? Is it just some other
[00:37:59] Satya Nadella: multi-dimensional or not? And that I think is the key question. To me, I think we,
[00:38:05] Satya Nadella: there are two arguments, one argument is it's that argument that hey, the models are going to
[00:38:09] Satya Nadella: eat the world. You can kind of easily, oh yeah, after all, everything is just a pattern and I'll
[00:38:15] Satya Nadella: learn it all and what have you. So but then the thing though is you could, to your point about
[00:38:20] Satya Nadella: Stripe, can take multiple models, yes, build this unbelievable sort of, I'll call it, fraud detection
[00:38:28] Satya Nadella: layer. Now that is, you know, model forward. And then there is this memory and tools use and action
[00:38:37] Satya Nadella: space that's all unique to Stripe. That to me is the future of a corporation, whether it's a
[00:38:43] Satya Nadella: farmer company, a payments company, a software company. That I think is the work that we all
[00:38:49] Satya Nadella: are doing and we'll do. And I think that that's, to me, that is sovereignty. Right.
[00:38:57] All right. Oh man. All right. Wow. Okay, this could be a new high score and 474. So new high score.
[00:39:13] I'm still thinking about this discussion we're having about the IDE for people who are on software
[00:39:20] John Collison: engineers and again, I feel like there could be a product in the next 10 years for finance people
[00:39:25] John Collison: where in hindsight, it is obviously the correct UI, but just like the spreadsheet kind of came out
[00:39:31] John Collison: of nowhere as a UI, it may feel like it came out of nowhere at that time. Let me just talk about that.
[00:39:38] John Collison: Speaking of them, the spreadsheets, it's like a right of passage for certain software companies to
[00:39:42] John Collison: try to take on Excel. And it seems to be doing pretty well 40 years in or what have you. Why is it so
[00:39:51] durable? Yeah, it's unbelievable. Right. I mean, it's some level, you know, the idea that
[00:40:02] a tabular for, I mean, I think it's the power of lists and tables. Yes. It's just perfect.
[00:40:08] Satya Nadella: And the malleability of software, right? That was I think the combination. So I think that's
[00:40:14] Satya Nadella: where the durability of a, that's why I'm blinking canvas. It's sort of like it's always going to be
[00:40:20] Satya Nadella: there. We made, add lots of bells and whistles to it. Yes. And the same thing with spreadsheets.
[00:40:25] Satya Nadella: The other thing about the spreadsheet is it's during complete. Right. I mean, that's the other,
[00:40:31] Satya Nadella: yeah, we sort of don't do it enough credit. It's like I can make it to the world's most
[00:40:36] John Collison: approachable programming environment. 100%. I mean, it's kind of like, you know, and you get into it
[00:40:40] Satya Nadella: without even thinking you're programming. And that is the other beauty, right? Which is like,
[00:40:44] Satya Nadella: you know, like AI still, you're mystified and you know, you talked about, oh my god, we need
[00:40:49] Satya Nadella: change management when eggs, spreadsheets came. Nobody talked about change management. They were
[00:40:53] Satya Nadella: just using it. Right. And that to me is the other thing, which is, you know, like somebody was
[00:40:58] Satya Nadella: describing to me, I was meeting the CEO of generally. He joined generally during the fax machine,
[00:41:05] Satya Nadella: right? And he was managing all their insurance agents. And he said to me, like, look,
[00:41:10] Satya Nadella: I still remember the day when emails showed up, excels showed up, and the entire workflow
[00:41:17] Satya Nadella: of how things happened completely were appended and evolved and changed ground up.
[00:41:24] Satya Nadella: Yes. And so to me, I think that that's to your point, what are those things of this era
[00:41:30] Satya Nadella: that will discover that allow the ground up re litigation of the work, the work artifact and
[00:41:35] Satya Nadella: the workflow? It's such an interesting time to be in software. I mean, compared to, you must feel
[00:41:40] John Collison: this. Like, it's just a much more interesting time now than five or 10 years ago. You know, it is
[00:41:45] Satya Nadella: interesting, right? Which is what happened was we were like, you know, cloud, cloud, cloud. Yes.
[00:41:50] Satya Nadella: And you know, if you had asked me, what was the hottest thing in, you know, 2019,
[00:41:56] Satya Nadella: we had built this fantastic multi-region or regionless database that was multi-format,
[00:42:04] Satya Nadella: right? Cosmos DB, which was like, we had, you know, basically a JSON database, we had,
[00:42:10] Satya Nadella: oh, we had a sequel in there. It was the everything database and we were drinking, oh,
[00:42:15] Satya Nadella: and there's region less in blah, blah, blah. And then the pandemic happened.
[00:42:20] Satya Nadella: And then cloud went into another hyper drive. I mean, teams, thank God, just became like the
[00:42:27] Satya Nadella: thing. And then so that was the exciting thing. And lo and behold, you come out of it and you sort
[00:42:34] Satya Nadella: of say, oh, I thought, oh, after the pandemic, we want to get to some stable state. In fact,
[00:42:39] Satya Nadella: I remember a forecast of the cloud, you know, we were saying, what do we do? We overbuilt
[00:42:45] Satya Nadella: during the pandemic. And there was a good eight months where we were all, and then this thing now
[00:42:52] John Collison: has come through. There's a lot of charts of the shape at Stripe, I don't know if it's this way
[00:42:56] John Collison: of Microsoft, where obviously March 2020, you saw this discontinuity, right? Much more
[00:43:01] John Collison: camera activity happening and we saw the rate of online business creation because, you know,
[00:43:06] John Collison: you're business that we're offline only saying, oh, you know, we got to switch to selling online.
[00:43:10] John Collison: And it's just state of that elevated level forever. Obviously, since it's gone up from there,
[00:43:14] John Collison: but there was no matching decline as people went back to, you know, into physical offices and
[00:43:20] John Collison: things like that. It was just a step change and that it stayed at the elevated level forever.
[00:43:25] John Collison: I'm sure you saw some things in that. Yeah, 100% things like that. Yeah, it never came down.
[00:43:29] John Collison: We're talking about commerce. We might as well talk about what we're working on together.
[00:43:32] John Collison: So we are very excited about it. And I think the idea that has always been there is,
[00:43:39] Satya Nadella: which is what's the best way for a merchant-friendly set of rails?
[00:43:46] Satya Nadella: And what is a customer-friendly set of rails, right? Is there a perfect matching?
[00:43:52] Satya Nadella: Conversational sort of commerce is a thing that people have talked about.
[00:43:56] Satya Nadella: And now, I think, with the work that you all have done and others have done, we kind of can
[00:44:01] Satya Nadella: really bring the merchant and the end user and have this agentic sort of experience. So it's
[00:44:07] Satya Nadella: early days. It has to be tastefully done. It has to be done in a way that you own the user's trust.
[00:44:14] Satya Nadella: And so I'm very excited about it. Yeah, we see two differences here because there have been
[00:44:19] John Collison: previous attempts as, you know, buying on Twitter or buying on Instagram and, you know, these kinds
[00:44:23] John Collison: of things. But what's different here is one, you have AI. So all the integrations for the merchant
[00:44:29] John Collison: are much easier. It's much less of a lift than previous times when things like that, this have
[00:44:35] John Collison: been tried. But then secondly, I just think the experience is so compelling as an end user. We're
[00:44:44] John Collison: already seeing this in the early data from the super-early customers that we have. We launched a
[00:44:49] John Collison: few weeks back in chat capacity as well. There's just, it has to work. And again, the data is already
[00:44:56] John Collison: bearing that out. Oh, yeah. Because it's so much easier as an end customer. Yeah, I've been talking
[00:44:59] John Collison: about it like, you know, I'm a bit of a cricket nut. So I kind of, I'm always searching for something.
[00:45:04] Satya Nadella: And, you know, the problem is, you know, whether it's Amazon or Walmart or what, I mean,
[00:45:09] Satya Nadella: the search experience sometimes is hard on the site. So interestingly enough, these chat experiences
[00:45:15] Satya Nadella: first are fantastic, right? And the fact that they point back to the catalog, I mean, the catalog
[00:45:20] Satya Nadella: is still king. Yes. And but now if I can marry the checkout and the catalog, and that to me is where,
[00:45:26] Satya Nadella: I think, the seamlessness. Well, and do you have any experiences? I've found a version that there's
[00:45:30] John Collison: some crucifuval experiences where for product research, using an AI app is so much better than
[00:45:37] John Collison: keyword-based search. It's amazing that up to last year, we thought keyword-based search was an
[00:45:43] John Collison: acceptable way to hunt for. Yeah, in fact, that's anything. Yeah. And the, and the, like the bottom
[00:45:48] Satya Nadella: line is it's kind of like it is creating a custom catalog for you, right? The, I mean, the response
[00:45:52] Satya Nadella: is not like a SERP, right? We were buying furniture in our house and we were just saying,
[00:46:01] John Collison: oh, yeah, we have this much space available in this spot. What do you think is a good
[00:46:07] John Collison: piece that would look good in that spot that meets these dimensions and things like that? But
[00:46:12] John Collison: it's crazy that we weren't doing that previously, you know what I mean? And so all this kind of
[00:46:16] John Collison: customization being able to give vibes, general aesthetics, I'm looking for like something slightly
[00:46:21] John Collison: higher end but not super fancy, you know, it's crazy that you weren't able to, by the way, that's
[00:46:26] John Collison: just the other crazy, crazy thing. I know my wife's, I was an architect and so she sort of has this
[00:46:32] Satya Nadella: node, you know, co-pilot node book in which she has all these architectural pictures and so on.
[00:46:37] Satya Nadella: And you can ask it quite high-level reasoning questions on what I should put in there. Yes.
[00:46:42] Satya Nadella: So it's able to take an architectural sketch or drawing and then take a public catalog or furniture
[00:46:49] Satya Nadella: and put those things together and reason about it. And that type of stuff is pretty magical.
[00:46:54] Satya Nadella: Like, are we on this? We are, as you know, really AI-piled when it comes to commerce at Stripe,
[00:47:00] John Collison: and we think a huge amount will move here and all the merchant conversations we're having
[00:47:05] John Collison: are bearing that out. And the way I think about it is that if you are doing open-ended discovery,
[00:47:12] John Collison: oh, I'm interested in outfit to buy for this occasion. I don't know exactly what I want.
[00:47:17] John Collison: AI will be so much better at helping you with that than the current experiences where you're
[00:47:22] John Collison: know you're clicking to a list of search results or something like that. And then if you're doing
[00:47:26] John Collison: targeted search where I'm looking for a specific object that needs easy to do, I want this component
[00:47:31] John Collison: for my bike, then also being able to specify with AI the exact parameters of the search you have
[00:47:36] John Collison: will be much better. They're like, wait, if you're taking all of the undirected discovery and if
[00:47:43] John Collison: you're also taking all of the highly directed search, isn't that just like all the commerce that
[00:47:47] John Collison: happens in the interest? And the only thing that's left out of that is like recurring staples.
[00:47:52] John Collison: I need to order more pet food that feels to me like the least affected. Though of course you have
[00:47:57] John Collison: to discover the brand of pet food at some point originally, but yeah, that's kind of how we're
[00:48:02] John Collison: thinking about it. And again, the Etsy has been an awesome first partner because all the products
[00:48:07] John Collison: are custom, right? There's no, yeah, that makes a ton of sense to me. I mean, the discovery part
[00:48:14] Satya Nadella: which obviously people like Instagram and others have done a great job. So the question is what's
[00:48:18] Satya Nadella: the discovery layer? We have like, that's one of the obviously personal personalized discovery
[00:48:25] Satya Nadella: layer inspiration for product, you know, what Pinterest is done is interesting. So some layer like
[00:48:30] Satya Nadella: that, yes, married with this conversational interface. And of course, it'll be a rising tide that
[00:48:36] John Collison: lifts all boats where part of what we're doing with this is making merchants product catalogs
[00:48:44] John Collison: remotely discoverable and inventory and everything like that. And then remotely
[00:48:49] John Collison: purchasable where you don't necessarily have to go through the whole flow and their size and
[00:48:52] John Collison: everything like that. You can just do it inside the magic wand co-pilot's experience. And so that
[00:48:57] John Collison: is at like the raw nuts and bolts level what we are doing and what we're wiring up. I think
[00:49:02] John Collison: then lots of exciting is that again, Pinterest played with commerce quite a few years back,
[00:49:06] John Collison: maybe 10 years back. It hasn't taken off as a huge thing. But now if you have all the merchants
[00:49:12] John Collison: who are offering their product catalogs as part of this protocol, then social sites like Pinterest
[00:49:20] John Collison: and Instagram and Twitter get another run at this kind of commerce experience because you've
[00:49:25] John Collison: way more merchant support and adoption for us than you have the first time around. Yeah.
[00:49:28] John Collison: Now, and we have a project called the NL Web and the idea is that, which is to really take every
[00:49:33] Satya Nadella: catalog of every merchant and give it like essentially a website, an NL Web interface. That then
[00:49:42] Satya Nadella: an agent can talk to to be able to interrogate and get the deep search, so to speak.
[00:49:47] Satya Nadella: Yes. Yes. Yes. Because today in some sense, one of the biggest challenges is the quality of
[00:49:52] Satya Nadella: the catalog and the ability to use reasoning to do a deep search. And if you can solve that,
[00:49:58] Satya Nadella: then to your point, every product will find its query. Yes. So we're building out this platform
[00:50:07] John Collison: in agentic commerce where we have some open source protocols like our agentic commerce protocol.
[00:50:12] John Collison: We obviously have the regular Stripe products. People are using us for this. It's
[00:50:17] John Collison: particularly kind of tricky from a payments point of view because you're looking to have an AI app
[00:50:22] John Collison: do payments on behalf of other people across all these different sites on the web without
[00:50:27] John Collison: probably sharing all your payment details like all across the web. It's just interesting payment
[00:50:30] John Collison: things that we're doing. Anyway, we're looking to build a platform business in agentic commerce.
[00:50:35] John Collison: You guys seem to know a thing or two. What advice would you have for us as we build in this
[00:50:42] John Collison: very nascent space, but when the clearliest product market? I mean, I think, I mean, you have done
[00:50:47] Satya Nadella: that, which is one of the things that I would think is what does it mean to participate in this
[00:50:52] Satya Nadella: agentic workflow? For every merchant. So every merchant now will have to sort of come to someone
[00:50:58] Satya Nadella: like Stripe and say, hey, I have a catalog, I have a checkout. Please get me to meet agents
[00:51:07] Satya Nadella: in the most friction-free way. And that done tastefully is why I would think our higher Stripe
[00:51:13] Satya Nadella: for. And I think the merchant onboarding, because I'm assuming the long tail of merchants being able
[00:51:19] Satya Nadella: to click and say, hey, enable me for agentic commerce is going to be the thing that's going to drive.
[00:51:25] Satya Nadella: Because the good news here is there is going to be multiple. I mean, obviously,
[00:51:27] Satya Nadella: the chat GPT is the big one, but there is going to be, I mean, Google's going to be there,
[00:51:32] Satya Nadella: we're going to be there, meta will be there, there's complexity, there's going to be a lot of
[00:51:35] Satya Nadella: competition. There's going to be a lot of front doors as aggregators. But the more interesting thing
[00:51:42] Satya Nadella: is they themselves will on their website or on their mobile app will want to support natural
[00:51:49] Satya Nadella: language queries. And so all of that being enabled for or my own agents will go interrogate those
[00:51:56] Satya Nadella: things. So I think that that's the key thing to be challenged, you know, I would rather really
[00:52:00] Satya Nadella: solve well. Yes. Because to go into a small merchant and say, hey, you go stand up on MCP server,
[00:52:04] Satya Nadella: do this protocol, that protocol. What's the easy button? I think the thing that we're going to see
[00:52:10] John Collison: is you're probably seeing this already emerging of a bunch of the agent experience. So we're talking
[00:52:15] John Collison: about agent commerce here. And we had Des trainer from Intercom. They do, they're now doing customer
[00:52:22] John Collison: service AI mediated and just like replacing humans doing customer service with AI. But what they're
[00:52:28] John Collison: seeing obviously is a huge amount of induced demand where people initially come for the help
[00:52:32] John Collison: desk type queries and then it's like, wow, this is honestly a much better way to navigate the
[00:52:36] John Collison: website. And it's almost like a command line for, you know, it can't quite take as much
[00:52:39] John Collison: actions now as it will be able to. But I also wonder how much all these experiences merge where like
[00:52:46] John Collison: we're in the buying stuff over here that is growing and expanding. And you know, maybe there's
[00:52:50] John Collison: some discovery and things like that. They're doing the customer service stuff over there. Universal.
[00:52:54] John Collison: Yeah. And just when does it become a command line application? Again, my example of this is
[00:52:59] John Collison: I find the fashion space interesting where how incredibly poor the tech is with a lot of
[00:53:07] John Collison: websites out there where people are trying to do this very aesthetic vibe space. I'm looking for
[00:53:12] John Collison: something like that, but like a little more fancy, you know, whatever. And it's all keyer-based
[00:53:17] John Collison: search and manual tagging and things like that. And things like that feel to me perfectly set up
[00:53:23] John Collison: for having an interactive AI based experience where again, like your mid-journey prompts, you're like,
[00:53:28] John Collison: no, the image wasn't quite right, change it this way. Just doing that with commerce, I think
[00:53:32] John Collison: it'll be really good. And I also think you're in intuitive limit. Like I mean, all of us
[00:53:35] Satya Nadella: are inside sales is also, or are the customer service is also inside sales. Exactly. Yeah.
[00:53:40] Satya Nadella: And so intuitively that makes sense. And definitely in the agentic world, right? You can
[00:53:46] Satya Nadella: stitch these things together so that their scenes are not like to what they are today. Maybe what we're
[00:53:51] John Collison: describing is a bunch of swim lanes have been established by random accidents of software and
[00:54:02] John Collison: org charts and everything like that. You do customer service when people come with a query as
[00:54:06] John Collison: of a non-commercial nature. You are an SDR. That's right. You know, you do whatever. And all those
[00:54:11] John Collison: distinctions are probably going to get blown away. Yeah. We're talking about kind of the AI apps that
[00:54:15] John Collison: people use and copies and chat GPT and Gemini and all these kind of things. There's a debate
[00:54:20] John Collison: about how much model quality matters. And is it the case that people pick a brand and they've
[00:54:27] John Collison: been drinking Coke for the longest time? And even if Coke's, I mean, Coke's about examples
[00:54:32] John Collison: because there's a revolt about the change in the formula. But even if they change the formula,
[00:54:35] John Collison: people, they still have a preferred brand. I use O3. My wife uses GPT-5. I'm always horrified.
[00:54:41] John Collison: I'm like, you deserve more intelligence than that. And you take O3 from her cold hands.
[00:54:47] John Collison: Where do you stand on the debate of do people have loyalty to her? And there was also the revolt
[00:54:50] John Collison: when they tried to take away 4.0 with her. And people really attached to that model. Do people
[00:54:56] John Collison: have loyalty to a model? Or did they have loyalty to an AI brand? And how does this affect your
[00:55:00] John Collison: business strategy? I think that in the consumer products, this was the first time we saw that,
[00:55:06] Satya Nadella: right? When you changed models, they're not sort of uniform changes. And they impact people
[00:55:14] Satya Nadella: differently. And personality is one such thing. Style, I don't want to have you. And so it just sort of
[00:55:21] Satya Nadella: is a new dimension. So in other words, it's also an argument that, oh, wow, this is a new dimension
[00:55:28] Satya Nadella: of perhaps differentiation. People will, you know, it's sort of, there's the IQ side of it.
[00:55:34] Satya Nadella: There's the EQ side of it. And then there is all these style points. And maybe that's kind of one
[00:55:40] Satya Nadella: of the things that people will steer things to. But long term for me, I think you have to kind of
[00:55:48] Satya Nadella: make sure that the models are most capable for the hardest high-value tasks. And then you continuously
[00:55:56] Satya Nadella: optimize after you have access to that for what the task had had this, right? So as a product
[00:56:03] Satya Nadella: builder for us, my thing is you have the model drop, which is the most capable. But then what's in
[00:56:10] Satya Nadella: production is multiple models. And my favorite like new thing in GitHub, for example, is auto,
[00:56:18] Satya Nadella: which is I want to keep, you know, people still be so much on it, whatever they want to use it.
[00:56:24] Satya Nadella: But at the end of the day, I really want the model picker. And it just can't be a dumb model
[00:56:28] Satya Nadella: router. Yes, yes. It has to basically have the intelligence to know that this task deserves this
[00:56:36] Satya Nadella: kind of cogs or this type of intelligence. And this is my complexity of my repo or my PR task.
[00:56:43] Satya Nadella: That ultimately is where, you know, the future of agents would be, right? And so therefore,
[00:56:50] Satya Nadella: you want the model, in fact, you want to ensemble models that then, you know, you have agents
[00:56:57] Satya Nadella: intermediating that ensemble so that it meets your needs. And then you'll have preferences.
[00:57:03] Satya Nadella: Well, Evans preference not just be for more intelligence like I'll go into the picker and manually
[00:57:07] John Collison: select O3 for like, oh, where should I go get ice cream query? Like I also, that was habit, don't
[00:57:14] John Collison: you think? But that is, you know, but it's also an important considered decision.
[00:57:19] John Collison: When it is true, I mean, it's very hard for any of us to take our deep, that's why defaults matter,
[00:57:25] Satya Nadella: and we love our defaults. We don't love the cheese to be moved. You know, even the model selection
[00:57:30] Satya Nadella: stuff, you know, it's kind of like, wow, if you now took away the model, you know, it's a problem.
[00:57:35] Satya Nadella: And so therefore, you have to be careful. But I do think in the long run, if I can trust,
[00:57:40] Satya Nadella: that's another one, right? Which is, if I can trust something, to always do something for me,
[00:57:46] Satya Nadella: while it's making a selection that somehow is delightful, then that's when I'll hand off.
[00:57:52] Satya Nadella: Okay. And so you think that's what you need to get to is me trusting that you will pick an
[00:57:57] John Collison: appropriate model. Exactly. Yeah. And then, I mean, my mental model of Microsoft is that you just
[00:58:02] John Collison: play at every part of the stack in that there's the, you know, you have co-pilot, you have your stake
[00:58:09] John Collison: in open AI, you have, well, we can get to vertical applications in AI, you have the Azure layer,
[00:58:15] John Collison: you have chips, everything I'm leaving out a whole bunch of stuff. Are some more important to
[00:58:19] John Collison: you than others? What is the must win? Will you do verticals? I mean, it's something new on for us.
[00:58:24] John Collison: Yeah, well, at the core, the way I kind of conceptualize it is our infrastructure business,
[00:58:28] Satya Nadella: we have to be fantastic at building what I'll call the token factory, right? This is the tokens per
[00:58:34] Satya Nadella: dollar per watt, really being super efficient at that. Then I'll say we have another layer of it,
[00:58:41] Satya Nadella: which is the agent factory. And the difference between the token factory and the agent factory is
[00:58:46] Satya Nadella: use the tokens most efficiently to drive a business outcome or a consumer preference outcome,
[00:58:54] Satya Nadella: right? Which is that value per token or something? Yeah, the value per token and as evolved by
[00:58:58] Satya Nadella: sort of the specific domain that people care about. And that is to your point, it has tooling
[00:59:03] Satya Nadella: around it, it has a whole whole story. It's kind of the new app tier or the app server, right? Every
[00:59:09] Satya Nadella: new platform has always had the web and there was a web server, this is the AI server in some sense,
[00:59:15] Satya Nadella: or the AI cloud. Then we will definitely want to build our own, I'll call it systems of
[00:59:20] Satya Nadella: intelligence or AI systems, that is the family of co-pilot, right? Whether it's for information work,
[00:59:26] Satya Nadella: that's kind of what we've done for coding or software development, that's the GitHub co-pilot,
[00:59:31] Satya Nadella: of securities and another domain where we are absolutely going to be a primary. Those of me,
[00:59:36] Satya Nadella: the three horizontal, we will also have business applications. The other one that is we're doing a
[00:59:43] Satya Nadella: lot in health and science. So in health, we had bought nuance and now we have something called
[00:59:49] Satya Nadella: DAX co-pilot. And this is the note taking, diurization for physicians, right? So the ability to be
[00:59:56] Satya Nadella: able to have a doctor spend more time with their patients and then the AI do everything else in terms
[01:00:01] Satya Nadella: of everything from coding to taking the notes. So that's one place, we have a great close partnership
[01:00:08] Satya Nadella: with Epic, it's embedded part of Epic, so that's kind of what we're doing in health. And then we're
[01:00:14] Satya Nadella: also doing stuff in co-pilot for consumer health that sort of docs to it. But the other one is a
[01:00:19] Satya Nadella: science and the science, it turns out it's a big domain for what I'll call the auto loop orchestration,
[01:00:26] Satya Nadella: right? Which is the scientific method in some sense requires you to create the hypothesis,
[01:00:33] Satya Nadella: then run these multiple experiments in silico, come back, refine and so on. So that to me is
[01:00:41] Satya Nadella: another tool chain. It's kind of like we're trying to discover some combination of the GitHub
[01:00:47] Satya Nadella: co-pilot meets Microsoft 365 co-pilot knowledge work, if you will, for the scientist where they have
[01:00:57] Satya Nadella: the authoritative sources of knowledge, they have even the interfaces tools you could even be,
[01:01:03] Satya Nadella: hey, the MCP server for the wet labs would speak, can I interface with it? And then how do you
[01:01:09] Satya Nadella: orchestrate all of this such that the scientific loop can go faster? As a platform company, you always have
[01:01:16] John Collison: decisions around when should you try and bundle products together, when should you try and
[01:01:22] John Collison: staple them and then they'd be used together and when should you not? And you know, I think the
[01:01:27] John Collison: classic example for some reason that everyone talks about despite it being quite minor is the
[01:01:33] John Collison: fact that Apple originally only let's use an iPod with a Mac and try to use a drive Mac sales
[01:01:41] John Collison: and then gave up and you know, shipped out chains for Windows. And my understanding reading the Apple
[01:01:44] John Collison: China book is it was like a totally random decision that someone just made at one day, you know,
[01:01:47] John Collison: one day, but it's often held up as one of these examples. Obviously, Microsoft, the entire history
[01:01:52] John Collison: has followed these interesting examples. I don't think people realize how open Microsoft was in the
[01:01:59] John Collison: early days where in 1985, most of Microsoft's revenue was from Macintosh applications and then
[01:02:08] John Collison: for the Microsoft operating systems, most of the applications were third party, you know, like
[01:02:13] John Collison: Lotus 1, 2, 3 and things like this. And so it was like a fully open strategy and then you had the
[01:02:16] John Collison: Windows era of the tight coupling between Office and Windows and those kind of mutually reinforcing
[01:02:24] John Collison: each other. Then early on, I get to sense Azure and Cloud was, you know, oh, it's a place you can run
[01:02:30] John Collison: your SQL server and then fully embracing Linux later on and things like that. And curious just
[01:02:35] John Collison: because again, we think about this as a platform company. We've been of late embracing much more
[01:02:40] John Collison: modularity, whereas, try Brader, you can use it even if you're not using Stripe for payments and
[01:02:43] John Collison: things like that. How do you in general think about your framework for when products should be
[01:02:48] John Collison: coupled versus when you sell them independently? And then I've AI-specific versions like
[01:02:54] John Collison: what do we, I've reason about this. I think we all have stayed many times how many of these
[01:03:03] Satya Nadella: battles are called and called zero sum. So at some level, one of the pieces of analysis that I think
[01:03:08] Satya Nadella: that you want has to be sharp at is what are by definition going to be multiplayer? Like Cloud is
[01:03:14] Satya Nadella: a classic example, right, which is I remember even back in the day when I got started, obviously
[01:03:19] Satya Nadella: Azure got started much later than AWS. People would tell me, oh, God, isn't AWS so far ahead,
[01:03:25] Satya Nadella: where is that a room for a second cloud? And having competed against Oracle and IBM on all
[01:03:30] Satya Nadella: the middle tier servers and so on, I felt like no, this enterprise customer and commercial
[01:03:35] Satya Nadella: customers by and large are going to demand sort of multiple. And so that was the structural
[01:03:42] Satya Nadella: understanding that drove us to even just be at it and the rest is history. So a little bit of,
[01:03:49] Satya Nadella: to me, if you over-package things, you might in fact sort of reduce your time and not compete,
[01:03:58] Satya Nadella: or like, for example, if we built Azure, in fact, Azure's, you know, which is called Windows Azure,
[01:04:02] Satya Nadella: right? Well, that's a problem because Azure makes no sense just for Windows. It's sort of got
[01:04:07] Satya Nadella: a support Linux as first class. It's got to support my SQL and Postgres as first class. And so
[01:04:13] Satya Nadella: that's what sort of allowed us to make sure that you actually have to do a great job with SQL
[01:04:20] Satya Nadella: server. But you got to do as bang of a job as like, you know, Amazon would do with Postgres or
[01:04:25] Satya Nadella: my SQL. And so it was driven primarily by, hey, that's the time. That's what customers expect us.
[01:04:31] Satya Nadella: And we're going to have tough competition. But so to me, that's the, that's kind of how I define
[01:04:36] Satya Nadella: my modularity. What's the thing that maximizes my stacks market opportunity? Then, yes, we are a firm,
[01:04:46] Satya Nadella: and the reason we're not a co-glomerate. And so therefore, there should be a theory of some
[01:04:51] Satya Nadella: integration benefits and platform effects. And so therefore, what is that? And how do we do a great
[01:04:58] Satya Nadella: job of it? But each layer of the stack, but even in, let's say in Azure, the token factories,
[01:05:03] Satya Nadella: somebody should be able to come and say, I just want to use Azure for its bare metal services.
[01:05:07] Satya Nadella: I just need Kubernetes, you know, clustered all over, but I just need to do the management part
[01:05:13] Satya Nadella: and I'll bring all my software. No problem. We got to win that workload. Maybe then after that,
[01:05:18] Satya Nadella: we'll at least have a shot someday when it becomes a real pain to manage sort of your multi-region
[01:05:23] Satya Nadella: database on your own. Then you'll say, oh, let me just use Cosmos. But it's a separate decision.
[01:05:29] Isn't there all the debate between if we have Linux and Azure, we'll sell more Azure?
[01:05:35] John Collison: But in the Windows people say, yeah, but you're hamstring Windows server. And there are some places
[01:05:40] John Collison: like you're describing where Microsoft's open. There are other places, you know, Microsoft
[01:05:45] John Collison: Flight Simulator is not available on the PlayStation. It's available on the Xbox. And that makes sense.
[01:05:49] John Collison: It feels kind of natural to be integrated that way. I know this might be a bit of a stretch,
[01:05:52] John Collison: but Teams chat and Teams video are not sold separately. They're just part of one thing. And that makes
[01:05:57] John Collison: sense and makes the bundling more compelling. And so don't you always end up in these debates
[01:06:01] John Collison: as does the bundling cost outweigh the bundling benefits? Yeah, I don't think some of those,
[01:06:07] Satya Nadella: like for example, Teams thing is a classic one. Teams was born as a product that brought those
[01:06:13] Satya Nadella: four things. Like Outlook, right? Outlook was brought, you know, there was a pen before. There was
[01:06:18] Satya Nadella: an email client and a calendaring was separate. And Outlook was the first scaffolding that said,
[01:06:24] Satya Nadella: hey, we bring these three things to get a job done, right? So that was and same thing with Teams,
[01:06:28] Satya Nadella: right? We brought chat and channels and video and what have you into one. So the bundling was the
[01:06:36] Satya Nadella: product to some degree, right? That was the product scaffolding. And so then of course, you can
[01:06:41] Satya Nadella: then say, hey, that needs to have an open marketplace and it needs to integrate with other things
[01:06:46] Satya Nadella: or what have you. So the modularity has to be thought through in ways that make sense at the
[01:06:52] Satya Nadella: atomic level. Then you don't want to over think about the synergies or sort of integration
[01:06:59] Satya Nadella: effects and you're not competitive, right? A classic thing would be if you built an unbelievable
[01:07:04] Satya Nadella: public cloud, except it only ran Windows workloads or SQL workloads, that would be essentially
[01:07:11] Satya Nadella: a very small sliver of the market. So it was in our sort of interest and definitely in the interest
[01:07:16] Satya Nadella: of the meeting the customer needs. And so being able to sort of really click in the AI stack,
[01:07:21] Satya Nadella: that's kind of how I look at it, right? We have an infra business, we have an app server business,
[01:07:25] Satya Nadella: and we have an app's business. It's just simplifying. I want those three things to stand
[01:07:31] Satya Nadella: for them, their own on their own on their own merits. We ourselves of course want to have the
[01:07:37] Satya Nadella: feedback loop across these three layers, but customers and partners will choose which
[01:07:43] Satya Nadella: go the enter through. This impression I have is that when you took over Microsoft, you shifted the
[01:07:48] John Collison: culture from a highly bundled, you'll buy your Windows machines and they're running Microsoft
[01:07:56] John Collison: Access and you know, every there are SQL Server and everything is like neatly packaged together in
[01:08:00] John Collison: this Microsoft life to moving towards more of an open and interoperable strategy.
[01:08:05] John Collison: It's like I think that the way I would say is my thing was to go back even to the Microsoft
[01:08:12] Satya Nadella: of the 80s perhaps, right? Because most of what happened was really in the 90s, there was Microsoft
[01:08:18] Satya Nadella: and there was pretty much nothing else. So there was sort of a lot more of our things coming together
[01:08:24] Satya Nadella: whether it was on the client or on the server. The 80s were like to your point, right? You know,
[01:08:30] Satya Nadella: we built Office on the Mac Windows came later. In fact, the concept that Bill had when he started
[01:08:36] Satya Nadella: Microsoft was it's a software factory. I'm not in love with any one category. I'm just like going
[01:08:41] Satya Nadella: to build the best software factory and it's going to turn out whatever product, Flight Sim, Flight Sim.
[01:08:46] Satya Nadella: You want a basic interpreter, no problem. We have one. You want an operating system, we have one too.
[01:08:51] Satya Nadella: So in some sense, that was the idea. And at one point, we got into a lock between 405 parts of that
[01:08:58] Satya Nadella: that became the Windows and Windows NT and client server and what have you. And so I sort of realized
[01:09:04] Satya Nadella: that when I became CEO or even when I was running our cloud business that hey, this is a time where
[01:09:11] Satya Nadella: the market's going to be a lot bigger and a lot different and we didn't have the mobile platform
[01:09:16] Satya Nadella: at that time. And so therefore we really needed to make sure we would stay relevant in the
[01:09:21] Satya Nadella: largest markets that we could address by bringing our products together in configurations that made
[01:09:27] Satya Nadella: sense. So there's actually a lot more less dog. There was not that much dog. In fact, I would say,
[01:09:32] Satya Nadella: if it was not in the core DNA of the company, I don't think just because I showed up as a CEO
[01:09:38] Satya Nadella: and I said, I want to do this, we would have executed well. It was in the core DNA of the company
[01:09:43] Satya Nadella: that we can in fact take our software to every platform. Yes. Speaking of the core DNA of the
[01:09:48] John Collison: company, there's the famous cartoon of Microsoft, all the guns pointing at each other. How much
[01:09:54] John Collison: cultural tweaking did you have to do? And how do you actually do that when you get down to brass
[01:10:04] John Collison: tax? Because you can say all the nice things, the all hands and things like that. But ultimately,
[01:10:07] John Collison: culture comes down to what you will in one toleration, how decisions are made and things like that.
[01:10:12] John Collison: Yeah. I mean, I'd say there are two things that I learned from an entire episode because I always say,
[01:10:16] Satya Nadella: look, I'm a consummate insider, right? Anything good and bad about Microsoft for the last 35 years.
[01:10:21] Satya Nadella: Yes. I live through them all and I'm part of it, right? So I can't deny anyway.
[01:10:25] Satya Nadella: The thing that I felt was a little bit of that was just we lost our own belief,
[01:10:33] Satya Nadella: because we lost the narrative. That cartoon is a great example of someone else defining
[01:10:40] Satya Nadella: what became the cultural narrative, more so than reality. Yes.
[01:10:45] Satya Nadella: So I keep a started to identify with the cartoon. That's right. I mean, that's kind of one of the,
[01:10:49] Satya Nadella: I think that one of the fundamental issues of today's social media and the zeitgeist is,
[01:10:54] Satya Nadella: you can absolutely lose narrative. It's reflexive. Yeah, it's completely reflexive. And it's so,
[01:10:59] Satya Nadella: so one of the interesting things is, of course, all of these things have signal, right? So this doesn't
[01:11:04] Satya Nadella: mean, oh, wow, we were all perfect divisions and we were all sort of, you know, in great harmony.
[01:11:09] Satya Nadella: That is not the case. But in some sense, some of these divisional tensions are real issues that
[01:11:14] Satya Nadella: need to have tension, right? You can't have. This is not a social cohesion. It's not a goal.
[01:11:21] Satya Nadella: Winning in the marketplace is a goal. But at some level, you have to orchestrate these large
[01:11:28] Satya Nadella: organizations in fact, you may even have two competing teams by design. Right. And just because
[01:11:34] Satya Nadella: somebody sort of said, hey, I'm going to read the New Yorker and there's going to be a cartoon
[01:11:38] Satya Nadella: that's a, that's the type of stuff that I think leaders. And how to communicate in today's world,
[01:11:45] Satya Nadella: where your employees read about you outside and form opinions about you is one of the toughest
[01:11:51] Satya Nadella: leadership challenges, I think, which is how do you, on the trust, how do you really make sure
[01:11:59] Satya Nadella: that they can, in fact, feel the reality, shape the reality? Like the other thing is,
[01:12:05] Satya Nadella: everybody thinks it's the system. It's that guy at the top or, you know, my VP and they have all
[01:12:12] Satya Nadella: the power and I have not. The reality is, power is a lot more diffused and distributed. And so
[01:12:18] Satya Nadella: therefore, how do you really help people, especially get hold of that and reshape? Right. Culture,
[01:12:26] Satya Nadella: like, you know, one of the other famous things people say, hey, I never leave companies, I leave
[01:12:30] Satya Nadella: managers. And I, you know, I believe that. Right. And so it's kind of micro cultures. And they can
[01:12:37] Satya Nadella: be shaped. In fact, when I look back at my Microsoft career, I was lucky to fall into these people
[01:12:43] Satya Nadella: who created these unbelievable environments in the company, right. And that's kind of why I stayed
[01:12:48] Satya Nadella: and that's how I thrive. And so to some degree, you know, I feel that the more culture you need at
[01:12:56] Satya Nadella: the top, a narrative, that you have to live and be consistent. Right. So that's where this growth
[01:13:01] Satya Nadella: mindset or learn it all versus know it all has been super helpful for us. As just a frame, because
[01:13:08] Satya Nadella: nobody thinks of it as my dogma, right. Thank God, it's sort of, you know, it's a well-known
[01:13:13] Satya Nadella: understood child psychology thing that appeals to people outside of work. And so cracking something
[01:13:20] Satya Nadella: like that and then living it. But also somehow, I would say the challenge for all of us in today's
[01:13:26] Satya Nadella: world is, I let the social media memes not define us. What's that inner strength that is there in
[01:13:34] Satya Nadella: an organization that can in fact resist the social meme? Yes. That I think is the key. How many
[01:13:41] Satya Nadella: people does Microsoft? I think around 200,000. Okay. So, roughly numbers, you know, Microsoft is 200,000
[01:13:46] John Collison: people. Stripe is 10,000 people. Maybe there's someone who's listening to this, who runs the company,
[01:13:52] John Collison: there's 500 people or something like that. A lot of the things that we do are probably fairly
[01:13:59] John Collison: scale independent where you're trying to make sure that you're talking to customers, you're holding
[01:14:02] John Collison: leadership off-size. We're looking at the numbers for 26. We want the revenues to be a bit higher
[01:14:07] John Collison: in the cost to be a bit lower. You know, there's a lot of activities and companies that are kind of
[01:14:10] John Collison: the same regardless of the size. That said, there's also probably things that only show up at the,
[01:14:18] John Collison: you know, 200,000 person, you know, city, state size. Thus, you know, I wouldn't be aware of the 10,000
[01:14:27] John Collison: person size. What effects only show up when you're that big? There are two things I would say,
[01:14:35] quite honestly, having only worked at Microsoft, it's not that I'm like an expert, but the one thing
[01:14:39] Satya Nadella: I would say, taking over for a founder, Steve and Bill built a comp. I mean, Paulins built,
[01:14:47] Satya Nadella: started and Steve and Bill scaled it. And I was sort of the first, quote, unquote, non-founder
[01:14:53] Satya Nadella: person. The thing I realized quickly, or in fact, I got into the job and I realized that I need a team.
[01:15:02] And just to have the ability to manage the scope. But then, you know, that A.G. Laffley thing that
[01:15:12] Satya Nadella: we put out there, which I think is a great one. Like, what is this, this, what, being clear about
[01:15:16] Satya Nadella: what does the CEO clearly need to do though in that? Which businesses are you in, which businesses
[01:15:21] Satya Nadella: are you out synthesizing the outside, having the standards, setting the standards for culture?
[01:15:28] Satya Nadella: And then the ability to your point about having that performance culture that you can't say,
[01:15:32] Satya Nadella: hey, I'm only about the long term or I'm all over the short term, you've got to deliver both.
[01:15:37] Getting a real grip of the four or five things that only you can do. And then building the team,
[01:15:45] Satya Nadella: building the team, you'd say even at a 500 person, that's what you do. But quite frankly, you can keep
[01:15:52] Satya Nadella: in your working memory, growing up as a developer, there was a set of things everybody would talk
[01:15:56] Satya Nadella: about. How many lines of code do you know? Right? Personally. At some point, you sort of say,
[01:16:01] Satya Nadella: oh, that's the person who knows that module or that library. That becomes more. Like at everybody
[01:16:07] Satya Nadella: starts where they know every line of code. At some level, then you have to get to the person who
[01:16:12] Satya Nadella: knows, oh, I know the person who wrote that. And I think that that modularity and team building
[01:16:19] Satya Nadella: and the cohesiveness is an English. Am I understanding you correctly that maybe a striped scale
[01:16:24] John Collison: or a smaller scale, you can still reason about the product or the product and know
[01:16:29] John Collison: everything that you're shipping and everything that's been found. But I also think founders are
[01:16:32] John Collison: unique in that sense. Because the founders are, you know, that's kind of what is singular about them,
[01:16:38] Satya Nadella: right? Because they've grown up with it from day one. See, it's kind of hard to take the working
[01:16:46] Satya Nadella: memory of a founder and say, oh, let me take it and imprint it on sort of a professional CEO.
[01:16:53] Satya Nadella: Yes. It just doesn't work. Because even for me, I joined the company in 92. I was not there
[01:17:01] Satya Nadella: in the early 80s, right? And so to some degree, it was a continuous scale. That only the
[01:17:09] Satya Nadella: quote-unquote, the founder CEO or the founder CEO. And so that's why I think having respect for what
[01:17:16] Satya Nadella: founders can do uniquely and founders having respect for whoever comes next, that they can't be
[01:17:22] Satya Nadella: like doing exactly the same thing that they did, right? So that's why I think this founder
[01:17:27] Satya Nadella: mode thing is interesting, which is clearly there is, you know, the cultural personality of a
[01:17:31] Satya Nadella: founder is unbelievable, right? And you use it, maximize it. Then mere model CEOs like us have to
[01:17:38] Satya Nadella: sort of also be, you know, you can sort of be in the re-found the mode, but don't think you're a
[01:17:43] Satya Nadella: founder. And that nuance, I think is an important one. Last question, we're running up against time as
[01:17:51] John Collison: we talk about cultures in building them. What's going on in the water in Hyderabad? For,
[01:18:00] John Collison: you know, the school that you went to, also Shantanu went there, Ajay Bango went there,
[01:18:07] John Collison: went to good chess players are, similarly, from there and southern India more broadly and things
[01:18:13] John Collison: like that. But do you have any theory on the local outperforms? Yeah, the high school we went to, in
[01:18:20] Satya Nadella: fact, yeah, until I would say Nvidia and Jensen, because Jensen has hidden out covered for all of us,
[01:18:28] Satya Nadella: for, you know, between me and Ajay and Shantanu. In fact, the CEO of Procter and Gamble was,
[01:18:34] Satya Nadella: today is also from my high school. It's kind of a kabal. I would say that one of the fascinating
[01:18:41] Satya Nadella: things growing up in Hyderabad and going to that school in the middle of nowhere at that time in
[01:18:45] Satya Nadella: the late 70s and the early 80s, I would say, I think it gave us a lot more space. If you look at even
[01:18:52] Satya Nadella: each of us, right, academics was a thing, but quite frankly, we mostly, all of us had things which
[01:18:58] Satya Nadella: were, you excelled at a lot of other things beyond academics, in fact. That was a pretty rare thing
[01:19:04] Satya Nadella: at that time in that country. And so I attribute it a lot to my high school, because I feel it is a
[01:19:12] Satya Nadella: place where it gave us a lot more space in room to follow what really became your passion,
[01:19:22] Satya Nadella: but you were able to take your time to discover it versus sort of feeling that, hey, I had to join
[01:19:28] Satya Nadella: some kind of a race. One of those tracks, so that's right. That's right. What was your passion in
[01:19:32] John Collison: high school? Cricket. In fact, this, by the way, yeah, the Samuel Beckett. Yeah, so I want to know this
[01:19:38] Satya Nadella: story. Sure, you know, he's, he's, if you asked the question, who is the one sports person who
[01:19:42] Satya Nadella: played actually professionally? I guess he played one or two matches for the, I guess, the Dublin
