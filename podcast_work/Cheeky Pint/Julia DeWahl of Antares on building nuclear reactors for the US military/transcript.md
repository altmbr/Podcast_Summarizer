[00:00:00] The US did have this long-running empty nuclear bench.
[00:00:04] Unknown Host: I can't even tell you how much has changed in the last few years.
[00:00:06] Julia DeWahl: They changed the band-aid of the NRC and they said,
[00:00:09] Julia DeWahl: you are no longer focused just on safety.
[00:00:12] Julia DeWahl: Department of Energy Pathways have been also unopened and unblocked for test reactors.
[00:00:16] Julia DeWahl: The last 10 years or so has been like 1% of nuclear fuel use in the US was actually domestically mined.
[00:00:22] Julia DeWahl: We're still buying like almost 50% of our uranium from Russia and kind of exo-vehits states.
[00:00:28] Julia DeWahl: How's happening intensive? Is it going to be to get your part of the market?
[00:00:31] Unknown Host: Oh, in the hundreds of millions, the biggest organization that showed up against Diablo Canyon was called Mother's for Peace.
[00:00:38] Julia DeWahl: This organization was that old that it was related to nuclear cold war, right?
[00:00:42] Julia DeWahl: I was sort of part of this mother's for nuclear organization.
[00:00:46] Julia DeWahl: Mother's against their mothers, yeah.
[00:00:48] And then I brought some graphite.
[00:00:50] Julia DeWahl: Okay. You want to take that out? Sure, yeah.
[00:00:52] Julia DeWahl: This is what we are using for a moderator in our reactor.
[00:00:55] Julia DeWahl: It has been designated a critical mineral. It's an important one.
[00:00:59] Julia DeWahl: This is just graphite. Like this is not, you know, uranium 235 or something.
[00:01:03] Unknown Host: No, I wouldn't have. I wouldn't have brought you that.
[00:01:06] Julia DeWahl: That wouldn't have been a little bit of a change to be holding.
[00:01:09] Julia DeWal is the co-founder of Antares,
[00:01:11] Unknown Host: which is designing nuclear microrectors for the military and other off-grid use cases.
[00:01:16] Unknown Host: Cheers. Cheers.
[00:01:17] Unknown Host: Come back. It's great to meet you.
[00:01:18] Unknown Host: Cheers.
[00:01:22] So you started out as first open door and then SpaceX.
[00:01:28] Unknown Host: What did you learn of each one of those that you took to Antares?
[00:01:30] Unknown Host: Yeah, sure. I think one of the big things is always about customers, right?
[00:01:35] Julia DeWahl: I mean, at the end of the day, this is why you build a business.
[00:01:38] Julia DeWahl: I'd opened up a lot of us for pretty young starting the business.
[00:01:40] Julia DeWahl: I was one of the early employees there and none of us had ever bought let alone sold a house.
[00:01:44] Julia DeWahl: So a lot of it was like learning what that was all about.
[00:01:48] Julia DeWahl: And I remember in the early days, we were working on writing the copy for the website and we're like,
[00:01:52] Julia DeWahl: you know, I need a whole lot of stuff.
[00:01:53] Julia DeWahl: We don't really know much about this whole thing.
[00:01:56] Julia DeWahl: So what can we do about that?
[00:01:57] Julia DeWahl: We just went and sat outside a bagel shop for a Saturday and a Sunday morning
[00:02:00] Julia DeWahl: and just bought people bagels and just asked them about their processes
[00:02:04] Julia DeWahl: buying and selling at home and learned a ton of just and really thought about
[00:02:07] Julia DeWahl: what language they were using, what were the pain points.
[00:02:10] Julia DeWahl: And that was really important to just like really get to know what we were trying to deliver on
[00:02:14] Julia DeWahl: as a business. And then, you know, fast forward to joining SpaceX after Open Door.
[00:02:20] Julia DeWahl: I joined as Starlink was coming out of R&D and into Go To Market.
[00:02:23] Julia DeWahl: That's why I was joining to lead that team and the business operations there.
[00:02:28] Julia DeWahl: And we launched and we get our first customers.
[00:02:30] Julia DeWahl: And so I invited our first customers to come join us via Zoom for an all hands.
[00:02:36] Julia DeWahl: And it was honestly the first time that many of the engineers had actually heard
[00:02:39] Julia DeWahl: from the words of a customer themselves about the experience.
[00:02:42] Julia DeWahl: And of course, everyone loved the internet.
[00:02:45] Julia DeWahl: Right, the fast internet was amazing.
[00:02:46] Julia DeWahl: Real Idaho, right, this is like a dream.
[00:02:48] Julia DeWahl: But when we got to talking about the setup process,
[00:02:52] Julia DeWahl: everyone kind of was like, oh, that sounds rough.
[00:02:54] Julia DeWahl: They're talking about multiple home depot trips.
[00:02:56] Julia DeWahl: They didn't know if they had to cut down trees and their property.
[00:02:58] Julia DeWahl: Like they couldn't get a poll long enough.
[00:03:00] Julia DeWahl: And so, you know what?
[00:03:01] Julia DeWahl: A lot of the simplifying people's understanding of what would mean.
[00:03:04] Unknown Host: People kind of didn't realize how much the setup was so painful.
[00:03:08] Julia DeWahl: And it led to basically this cross-functional SWAT team that was dedicated to mounting options
[00:03:14] Julia DeWahl: to be sold alongside the dish.
[00:03:16] Julia DeWahl: And like, if you had...
[00:03:17] Julia DeWahl: It was part of your third party.
[00:03:19] We did it ourselves, actually.
[00:03:20] Julia DeWahl: We said it's important that we have a good experience for that.
[00:03:22] Julia DeWahl: Because actually it's a big part of the experience.
[00:03:26] Julia DeWahl: And so it's funnepal whole team.
[00:03:27] Julia DeWahl: Like a lot of attention was given to mounting, which is like, whoever would have thought.
[00:03:30] Julia DeWahl: And I think, you know, customers again, they're just like,
[00:03:33] Julia DeWahl: they are the reason you start a business.
[00:03:34] Julia DeWahl: And what's going on is spring this back to Ontario.
[00:03:38] Julia DeWahl: I mean, the reason we started in Ontario is to say, like, the government,
[00:03:41] Julia DeWahl: particularly military, needs more energy resilience, especially for critical infrastructure.
[00:03:46] Julia DeWahl: We just do so much more now in the cloud with satellites.
[00:03:50] Julia DeWahl: Our, you know, our missile defense sites are sitting there, like,
[00:03:53] Julia DeWahl: being powered by diesel generators.
[00:03:54] Julia DeWahl: So, like, shouldn't we upgrade that?
[00:03:56] Julia DeWahl: Okay, so, I'll bite.
[00:03:57] Unknown Host: What is in Ontario?
[00:03:58] Unknown Host: Sure, sure.
[00:03:59] We're building microreactors, so small nuclear reactors.
[00:04:03] Julia DeWahl: And we are building in particular for critical infrastructure,
[00:04:07] Julia DeWahl: largely for the military.
[00:04:08] Julia DeWahl: Although we do think that as costs come down,
[00:04:11] Julia DeWahl: there will be an interesting commercial market too.
[00:04:12] Julia DeWahl: But basically anywhere where you're off grid for sure,
[00:04:16] Julia DeWahl: or you just want resilience behind the grid as it exists today,
[00:04:20] Julia DeWahl: you know, cyber attacks or whatever the grid goes down,
[00:04:22] Julia DeWahl: you want backup power.
[00:04:23] Julia DeWahl: It's a really good option.
[00:04:24] Julia DeWahl: Okay.
[00:04:25] And if one megawash is a small neighborhood,
[00:04:29] Unknown Host: if one gigawash is like a big nuclear power plant,
[00:04:32] Unknown Host: like in the Simpsons, you know.
[00:04:33] Unknown Host: Quas are your SMRs.
[00:04:36] Unknown Host: Oh, yeah.
[00:04:36] Unknown Host: There's basically three classes size-wise.
[00:04:38] Julia DeWahl: You have the really small ones are the microreactors.
[00:04:41] Julia DeWahl: And we're actually one of the smallest of those.
[00:04:42] Julia DeWahl: So we even sub one megawash.
[00:04:44] Julia DeWahl: We're kind of in the hundreds of kilowatt scale.
[00:04:46] Julia DeWahl: You could think of that as like hundreds of houses worth of electricity.
[00:04:49] Julia DeWahl: Then you have the SMRs, which is kind of this middle ground bucket,
[00:04:52] Julia DeWahl: which is an interesting kind of neither here nor there.
[00:04:56] Julia DeWahl: But potentially interesting, I'm sure we'll get into.
[00:04:58] Julia DeWahl: Kind of in the hundreds of megawatts or even 50 megawatts.
[00:05:01] Julia DeWahl: And then you have the gigawatts, so a thousand megawatts.
[00:05:03] Julia DeWahl: And that's what the current power plants are today.
[00:05:05] Julia DeWahl: Okay. So you're a sub-a-megawash.
[00:05:06] Unknown Host: So we're super small.
[00:05:06] Unknown Host: I see.
[00:05:07] Unknown Host: Okay. So you're kind of similar nuclear exercise
[00:05:09] Unknown Host: to be on a submarine or something like that.
[00:05:11] Unknown Host: Actually smaller than that even.
[00:05:12] Julia DeWahl: Those are like megawatt scales.
[00:05:13] Julia DeWahl: So we're like, think about like, we're the size of a car reactor.
[00:05:16] Julia DeWahl: Yep.
[00:05:16] Julia DeWahl: Think about replacing a diesel generator that's used to power
[00:05:19] Julia DeWahl: again, something that would be on the order of 200 to 300 homes of electricity.
[00:05:23] Julia DeWahl: So it's quite small.
[00:05:24] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:05:24] Julia DeWahl: And so a big part of your focus is providing power in places
[00:05:30] Unknown Host: where you really need that reliability.
[00:05:32] Unknown Host: Like you're talking about replacing diesel generators.
[00:05:34] Unknown Host: Is that kind of the design stand before you?
[00:05:36] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:05:36] Unknown Host: And anywhere where you're going to enable a capability,
[00:05:39] Julia DeWahl: a mission capability that wouldn't really be possible.
[00:05:42] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:05:42] Julia DeWahl: Otherwise.
[00:05:43] Julia DeWahl: So there's actually some really interesting space applications,
[00:05:46] Julia DeWahl: potentially underwater applications.
[00:05:47] Julia DeWahl: As you move to, as you move away from like a few,
[00:05:50] Julia DeWahl: what the call, exquisite systems to a tritable systems.
[00:05:54] Julia DeWahl: This is where a really small reactor could come in very handy
[00:05:57] Julia DeWahl: for the submarines are obviously,
[00:06:00] Julia DeWahl: multi megawatt powered systems that these could be kilowatt powered,
[00:06:04] Julia DeWahl: smaller systems underwater.
[00:06:05] Julia DeWahl: But yes, anywhere where you're off grid,
[00:06:07] Julia DeWahl: where today you're relying on what they call like the fuel supply chain.
[00:06:11] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:06:12] Julia DeWahl: Of like bringing in fuel via helicopter or barge repeatedly.
[00:06:16] Julia DeWahl: And that being a vulnerability, like this is a great option.
[00:06:19] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:06:19] Julia DeWahl: So you're the starting of electricity.
[00:06:20] Unknown Host: Kind of.
[00:06:21] Unknown Host: We're actually like perfectly paired.
[00:06:23] Julia DeWahl: And I wish we could offer a consumer product that's not on our run map right now.
[00:06:27] Julia DeWahl: But maybe one day, like, you know, backpacks.
[00:06:29] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:06:30] Unknown Host: Nuclear reactor.
[00:06:31] Unknown Host: Why, like our consumer kind of can't be on your run map,
[00:06:34] Unknown Host: but why not is the sound of the government is much easier than selling to something?
[00:06:38] Unknown Host: There's so many reasons.
[00:06:39] Julia DeWahl: I think that you always want to try to get your beach head where it's like the easiest to achieve,
[00:06:43] Julia DeWahl: right?
[00:06:44] Julia DeWahl: And so we believe, I believe that, you know, premium power is where you need to go with nuclear.
[00:06:49] Julia DeWahl: And there's sort of like, there's two spaces for that one is what we're doing with enterys,
[00:06:53] Julia DeWahl: which is go to the military, help them with mission critical need.
[00:06:57] Julia DeWahl: Where they're not cost sensitive, where they already pay more for power.
[00:07:00] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:07:01] Julia DeWahl: And go there and support them with this, this like next gen better version of resilient power.
[00:07:06] Julia DeWahl: Or you go and you sell what we're seeing now, I think, just really interesting with the
[00:07:09] Julia DeWahl: hyperscalers is they have carbon commitments.
[00:07:12] Julia DeWahl: They want clean firm.
[00:07:14] Julia DeWahl: They want 24, 7 power.
[00:07:15] Julia DeWahl: They're actually willing to pay above market rates for that.
[00:07:17] Julia DeWahl: And they will pay above market rates.
[00:07:18] Julia DeWahl: So this premium power thing is, is a really interesting dynamic, like where nuclear is
[00:07:23] Julia DeWahl: kind of well positioned.
[00:07:24] Julia DeWahl: What are the underwater applications?
[00:07:27] Well, it's really just think many submarines.
[00:07:28] Julia DeWahl: Oh, okay.
[00:07:29] Julia DeWahl: Yeah.
[00:07:29] Julia DeWahl: Just really small systems, like, you know, what what drones are to maybe like larger missiles.
[00:07:35] Julia DeWahl: That's kind of the equivalent.
[00:07:36] Julia DeWahl: It's not, it's not super far along just yet.
[00:07:39] Julia DeWahl: Got it.
[00:07:39] Julia DeWahl: Okay.
[00:07:40] Unknown Host: And what does the path look like between now and producing power for the military, I guess,
[00:07:48] Unknown Host: first in a pilot's environment and then kind of at scale outside of a pilot's environment?
[00:07:52] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:07:52] Unknown Host: We, well, you know, it's always what are the what are the next milestones that you can do to
[00:07:57] Julia DeWahl: prove your technical ability and again, raise more capital to keep going with your company.
[00:08:02] Julia DeWahl: I think the biggest risk off into the target of companies is you don't you don't get far enough
[00:08:07] Julia DeWahl: along technically to merit additional investment.
[00:08:09] Julia DeWahl: So we're thinking a lot about our milestones for reactor development.
[00:08:14] Julia DeWahl: And so next year, our criticality test is kind of the first milestone.
[00:08:18] Julia DeWahl: By end of 2027, we want to have our first demonstration unit demonstrated.
[00:08:22] Julia DeWahl: And what's really exciting is like, there's just so much good policy happening right now from the DOE
[00:08:27] Julia DeWahl: and elsewhere that is supporting reactor tests and pilot programs.
[00:08:32] Julia DeWahl: And so there's just like so much happening where they're opening up federal land.
[00:08:38] Julia DeWahl: They're removing starting to remove some of those like NEPA type regulations that really just
[00:08:43] Julia DeWahl: hold everything up.
[00:08:44] Julia DeWahl: So there is a clearer path now than the really ever has been for reactor builds.
[00:08:49] Julia DeWahl: Oh, we'll get to the very interesting side of a little questions.
[00:08:53] Unknown Host: What is your criticality test in 2026?
[00:08:55] Unknown Host: What does that mean?
[00:08:56] Unknown Host: Yeah, it means that you're testing that you can actually start your reaction.
[00:09:00] Julia DeWahl: So like you figured out the right amount of kind of like moderator to fuel.
[00:09:06] Julia DeWahl: And you start going critical.
[00:09:07] Julia DeWahl: You don't have it like continue on for a while.
[00:09:10] Julia DeWahl: You don't typically have a power conversion system that's actually taking the raw energy
[00:09:14] and turning it into electricity.
[00:09:16] Julia DeWahl: So it's just one of those like initial tests.
[00:09:18] Julia DeWahl: Like can you start to put all your pieces together?
[00:09:21] Julia DeWahl: And when do you, the fusion guys are all focused on this, producing more power than you put it?
[00:09:30] Unknown Host: I know that's a fusion thing.
[00:09:32] Unknown Host: But yeah, when do you actually produce power in the...
[00:09:35] Unknown Host: Yeah, producing power will be like your first reactor test.
[00:09:38] Julia DeWahl: Like can you do the whole shebang?
[00:09:39] Julia DeWahl: Like you can get this thing up and running.
[00:09:41] Julia DeWahl: It's producing power.
[00:09:43] Julia DeWahl: And that's a way to do that in the end of 2027.
[00:09:45] Julia DeWahl: Oh wow, that's like pretty soon.
[00:09:46] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:09:47] Unknown Host: What does the market look like for these small reactors?
[00:09:51] Unknown Host: Who are you going to compete with?
[00:09:52] Unknown Host: Well, the market for microactors is one of these ones where it's like,
[00:09:56] Julia DeWahl: well, there are no microactors today on the market to just like buy and use.
[00:09:59] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:09:59] Julia DeWahl: So what do you think they're going to be, right?
[00:10:01] Julia DeWahl: And so I think the first and foremost, it's going to be the most critical assets
[00:10:04] Julia DeWahl: where you just like cannot have them go down.
[00:10:06] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:10:07] Julia DeWahl: Which is why the defense is the perfect first market for it.
[00:10:10] Julia DeWahl: And so it's going to be all of your critical infrastructure on every single base that there is.
[00:10:14] Julia DeWahl: Obviously you'll start with the most critical of critical and missile defense sites,
[00:10:17] Julia DeWahl: and off-grid locations, things like that.
[00:10:19] Julia DeWahl: And that's kind of defense.
[00:10:21] Julia DeWahl: Then you think about commercial.
[00:10:23] Julia DeWahl: Basically you have to see where the cost curves get to too.
[00:10:26] Julia DeWahl: Like how cheap can it get?
[00:10:27] Julia DeWahl: This is just like space, right?
[00:10:29] Julia DeWahl: It's like those first expensive launches into space,
[00:10:32] Julia DeWahl: like that better have been a really important thing you're putting up there.
[00:10:34] Julia DeWahl: Right?
[00:10:35] Julia DeWahl: But now that launch costs has come down, you can start to be like,
[00:10:38] Julia DeWahl: oh, what else could we do?
[00:10:39] Julia DeWahl: There can do some more stuff that's like maybe not so-so-emissioned critical.
[00:10:43] Julia DeWahl: I think we'll see the same thing in the commercial industries.
[00:10:46] Julia DeWahl: Oil and gas has a lot of areas where they, again, use diesel generators to do things like
[00:10:54] Julia DeWahl: compress natural gas along their pipelines.
[00:10:56] Julia DeWahl: And they actually have carbon commitments which are really interesting,
[00:10:58] Julia DeWahl: that they're like sort of thinking about ironically, right?
[00:11:02] Julia DeWahl: Can they move towards some more renewable or nuclear type resources?
[00:11:05] Julia DeWahl: So I think there's going to be some commercial applications there to mining,
[00:11:08] Julia DeWahl: for example, to like anything that's like off-grid,
[00:11:11] Julia DeWahl: hard to power today.
[00:11:13] Julia DeWahl: It's really hard to get fuel into.
[00:11:14] Julia DeWahl: It's a perfect market.
[00:11:15] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:11:16] Unknown Host: You're probably following the US military.
[00:11:17] Unknown Host: There's all these controversies right now.
[00:11:18] Unknown Host: I would be talking about fuel quality and fuel contamination issues in Asia, I think it is.
[00:11:24] Unknown Host: But yeah, presumably places where we are worried about fuel availability at all times,
[00:11:29] Unknown Host: I'm ensuring that you constantly have access to fuel.
[00:11:32] Unknown Host: That is the place where there will be the most pull for these solutions.
[00:11:35] Unknown Host: Yes.
[00:11:36] Unknown Host: Like that's where generators work worst.
[00:11:37] Unknown Host: Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:38] Unknown Host: And you know, there's a famous, there's a famous
[00:11:41] Julia DeWahl: defense court.
[00:11:41] Julia DeWahl: I think it's unleashed us from the tether fuel, which means just like,
[00:11:45] Julia DeWahl: gosh, the logistics supply chain has been such just a challenge.
[00:11:49] Julia DeWahl: I mean, it was 50% of the, I think, the Afghanistan casualties were from just logistics.
[00:11:55] Julia DeWahl: And so, you know, having situations where you can kind of reduce that risk
[00:12:00] Julia DeWahl: helps and it's a great kind of market fit.
[00:12:02] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:12:03] Julia DeWahl: What, you were seeing this new market for these small reactors today.
[00:12:07] Unknown Host: Why not?
[00:12:08] Unknown Host: Like why?
[00:12:08] Unknown Host: Because we're talking about, yeah, why haven't it?
[00:12:10] Unknown Host: That new tier efficient is always for a long time.
[00:12:12] Unknown Host: Yeah, why hasn't it been done?
[00:12:13] Julia DeWahl: Gosh, there's so many reasons.
[00:12:15] Julia DeWahl: I think we ended up, I think there was just a macro really negative climate around nuclear in general.
[00:12:20] Julia DeWahl: So it impacted anything small as well.
[00:12:22] Julia DeWahl: Coming out of the 70s.
[00:12:24] Julia DeWahl: And so you had macro forces related to just like inflation,
[00:12:28] Julia DeWahl: kind of just cost of capital, people stopped building,
[00:12:31] Julia DeWahl: which coincided with the environmental movement, which is extremely anti-nuclear.
[00:12:36] Julia DeWahl: They actually sort of conflated nuclear weapons testing even with,
[00:12:40] Julia DeWahl: it was just like no nooks with energy.
[00:12:42] Julia DeWahl: It's like, oh, that's actually pretty different.
[00:12:44] Julia DeWahl: So a lot of things converged in the 70s and then by the 80s,
[00:12:47] Julia DeWahl: we stopped building a nuclear.
[00:12:48] Julia DeWahl: Okay, so you just, if you had a part of the general anti-nuclear swing,
[00:12:53] Unknown Host: and thus also led to, you know, the cessation of construction of new nuclear plants in the U.S.
[00:12:59] Unknown Host: and everything like this, just your corn to the market also got caught up in that.
[00:13:03] Unknown Host: Yeah, that's why we haven't ended up with them.
[00:13:05] Unknown Host: Were there ever products available at this size range?
[00:13:09] Unknown Host: There were, but they were pretty few and far between mostly test reactors.
[00:13:14] Julia DeWahl: Small things built. We actually put one reactor into space in the 1960s to test that out.
[00:13:19] Julia DeWahl: So yeah, for a bit, I mean, a few months.
[00:13:22] Julia DeWahl: And it was like, let's try to do some, you know, systems in space with power.
[00:13:25] Julia DeWahl: It's important to have power in space.
[00:13:27] Julia DeWahl: And I think that's a whole nother frontier.
[00:13:29] Julia DeWahl: Obviously, the U.S. did have this long-running anti-nuclear bent
[00:13:35] Unknown Host: hardgrip in Ireland. Similarly, there was the exact same thing.
[00:13:39] Unknown Host: And Ireland was very paranoid about a particular British nuclear power plant,
[00:13:43] Unknown Host: cellophiles that was just across the channel from our
[00:13:46] Unknown Host: capacity.
[00:13:47] Unknown Host: Does Ireland have, I don't know, does Ireland have nuclear?
[00:13:49] Julia DeWahl: Ireland has no nuclear power.
[00:13:50] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:13:50] Unknown Host: And the UK does, friends, does Ireland does not.
[00:13:52] Unknown Host: And I believe it's bent.
[00:13:54] Unknown Host: And so it can't per the current rules.
[00:13:57] Unknown Host: There's actually many states in the U.S. that have bands as well,
[00:14:00] Julia DeWahl: but they've just been falling left and right.
[00:14:01] Julia DeWahl: It's so cool to see.
[00:14:02] Julia DeWahl: Well, I was going to ask this.
[00:14:04] Unknown Host: The vibe has really shifted over the past 10 to 15 years.
[00:14:09] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:14:10] Why?
[00:14:11] I mean, honestly, it reminds me of gay marriage.
[00:14:13] Julia DeWahl: I mean, and if you look at the polling,
[00:14:15] Julia DeWahl: the music came to the youth, right?
[00:14:16] Julia DeWahl: It definitely comes from youth, for sure.
[00:14:18] Julia DeWahl: But it's like, it just kind of, you know,
[00:14:20] Julia DeWahl: enough things add up and it just swings.
[00:14:22] Julia DeWahl: And no one ever looks back to the thing.
[00:14:23] Julia DeWahl: That's how it feels.
[00:14:25] Julia DeWahl: The percentage point change we've seen in the last five to 10 years,
[00:14:28] Julia DeWahl: is almost 20 points.
[00:14:29] Julia DeWahl: I mean, it's like 17 points or something.
[00:14:31] Julia DeWahl: So it's 60 plus percent of people support nuclear.
[00:14:34] It's actually almost surprising.
[00:14:35] Julia DeWahl: It's that low in some ways.
[00:14:36] Julia DeWahl: Yeah.
[00:14:36] Julia DeWahl: But yeah, I mean, it's just huge public sentiment shift.
[00:14:40] Julia DeWahl: And I think the kind of the old hippie nuclear testing,
[00:14:44] Julia DeWahl: nuclear weapons testing folks are kind of dying out.
[00:14:47] Julia DeWahl: What is wild, though, is I did a little kind of act of
[00:14:50] Julia DeWahl: as related to Diablo Canyon power plant here in California,
[00:14:53] Julia DeWahl: which was slated to be shut down this year.
[00:14:55] Julia DeWahl: Sure, yeah.
[00:14:56] Unknown Host: And just a few years ago,
[00:14:58] Julia DeWahl: Newsom had to kind of begrudgingly say like,
[00:15:00] Julia DeWahl: oh, you know what, we probably should keep this thing on.
[00:15:02] Julia DeWahl: We can't afford to have the power going out.
[00:15:04] Julia DeWahl: But I listened in on some hearings.
[00:15:06] Julia DeWahl: It actually gave some testimony there.
[00:15:07] Julia DeWahl: And it was so funny to me, the biggest organization that showed up
[00:15:11] Julia DeWahl: against Diablo Canyon was called Mothers for Peace.
[00:15:14] Julia DeWahl: And it's like, do you understand the irony of your name?
[00:15:17] Julia DeWahl: This organization was that old that it was related to
[00:15:20] Julia DeWahl: like the nuclear cold war, right?
[00:15:21] Julia DeWahl: Totally.
[00:15:22] Julia DeWahl: And it's like, gosh, we've moved on.
[00:15:23] Julia DeWahl: We were joking because I sort of am part of this
[00:15:26] Julia DeWahl: Mothers for nuclear organization that's like,
[00:15:28] Julia DeWahl: just like Tang and she could bet on that.
[00:15:30] Julia DeWahl: Our mothers against their mothers.
[00:15:31] Julia DeWahl: Yeah, our mothers against their mothers.
[00:15:33] Julia DeWahl: And it's just funny how old school,
[00:15:35] Julia DeWahl: a lot of that opposition is.
[00:15:37] Julia DeWahl: Yeah, so I guess there's a science advances,
[00:15:39] Unknown Host: one death at a time dynamic going on here,
[00:15:41] Unknown Host: whereas the memory of the 1960s and peak nuclear confrontation.
[00:15:49] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:15:50] Unknown Host: And three mile island and all these things.
[00:15:52] Unknown Host: As all that fades, maybe it creates an environment
[00:15:55] Unknown Host: where people can be more supportive of the mixture.
[00:15:57] Unknown Host: Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:58] Julia DeWahl: Yeah.
[00:15:58] Julia DeWahl: What was your activism around Diablo Canyon?
[00:16:00] Unknown Host: That was just exactly that.
[00:16:01] Julia DeWahl: It was like, let's make sure that this actually passes
[00:16:03] Julia DeWahl: and we don't shut it down.
[00:16:04] Julia DeWahl: But it's safer.
[00:16:05] Julia DeWahl: There was a lot of people just calling and saying,
[00:16:06] Julia DeWahl: hey, listen, nuclear super safe.
[00:16:08] Julia DeWahl: It's carbon-free, like a sense of being California,
[00:16:10] Julia DeWahl: we care about these things.
[00:16:11] Julia DeWahl: Like, let's support this.
[00:16:13] Julia DeWahl: Let's not let's overturn whatever legislation was done 10 years ago
[00:16:17] Julia DeWahl: that said we should shut this thing down.
[00:16:18] Julia DeWahl: And it did pass.
[00:16:19] Julia DeWahl: So now we do still have it open.
[00:16:21] Julia DeWahl: Everyone on progress Twitter likes to complain about the NRC.
[00:16:25] Unknown Host: And but for the NRC, we would be living in that jets
[00:16:29] Unknown Host: in this vision of the future.
[00:16:31] Unknown Host: And everyone would have their nuclear powered car
[00:16:34] Unknown Host: that they used to drive to their nuclear power office.
[00:16:36] Unknown Host: Right, right, right.
[00:16:37] Unknown Host: Is that true?
[00:16:38] Unknown Host: How good or bad is the current regulatory environment?
[00:16:41] Unknown Host: How much does that change?
[00:16:42] Unknown Host: Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:43] Julia DeWahl: I think it's an overestimated headwind certainly today.
[00:16:47] Julia DeWahl: I think if you go back five years ago, 10 years ago, for sure,
[00:16:50] Julia DeWahl: I mean, they hadn't licensed anything in decades.
[00:16:52] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:16:53] Unknown Host: There had been nothing new.
[00:16:55] Julia DeWahl: And but I can't even tell you how much has changed
[00:16:58] Julia DeWahl: in the last few years.
[00:16:59] Julia DeWahl: It's kind of remarkable.
[00:17:00] Julia DeWahl: And it's been across both the Biden
[00:17:02] Julia DeWahl: and the Trump administration, which is amazing to see.
[00:17:04] Julia DeWahl: I mean, the legislation around nuclear passes like,
[00:17:07] Julia DeWahl: you know, 95 to 5 type of thing, right?
[00:17:10] Julia DeWahl: It's like really, really strong bipartisan.
[00:17:13] Julia DeWahl: What was interesting to see is it started with Biden,
[00:17:16] Julia DeWahl: a bunch of legislation related to modernizing
[00:17:19] Julia DeWahl: and reforming the NRC.
[00:17:20] Julia DeWahl: The biggest thing they did was they changed the band-aid
[00:17:23] Julia DeWahl: of the NRC and they said,
[00:17:24] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:17:24] Julia DeWahl: You are no longer focused just on safety.
[00:17:27] Julia DeWahl: Because what's the safest number of nuclear reactors?
[00:17:29] Julia DeWahl: To license zero.
[00:17:30] Julia DeWahl: So they expanded that, you know,
[00:17:32] Julia DeWahl: you must consider the full environment,
[00:17:34] Julia DeWahl: the full civilization, that's great.
[00:17:36] Julia DeWahl: And then just change things around like the advanced reactor pathway,
[00:17:41] Julia DeWahl: removing some of the barriers.
[00:17:42] Julia DeWahl: And then it's continued on with Trump.
[00:17:44] Julia DeWahl: And in fact, he's sort of added even some more teeth and specificity.
[00:17:48] Julia DeWahl: So right now they've changed it to,
[00:17:50] Julia DeWahl: you have 18 months to get your answer from the NRC.
[00:17:53] Julia DeWahl: License or no license.
[00:17:54] Julia DeWahl: Like, do you pass or not?
[00:17:56] Julia DeWahl: And so like, there is a lot of happens
[00:17:58] Unknown Host: if they exceed the 18 month window.
[00:17:59] Unknown Host: I'm, you know, probably it's in the details somewhere.
[00:18:02] Julia DeWahl: But when is that like, A, that these have been like declared,
[00:18:04] Julia DeWahl: that like, timeliness is important?
[00:18:07] Julia DeWahl: There's also been some leadership change,
[00:18:08] Julia DeWahl: which is just more reform oriented,
[00:18:10] Julia DeWahl: which is great.
[00:18:11] Julia DeWahl: And there's just a huge microscope on it, right?
[00:18:12] Julia DeWahl: Like everyone's watching.
[00:18:13] Julia DeWahl: Like everyone knows who's, now who's,
[00:18:15] Julia DeWahl: who's submitting their paperwork
[00:18:17] Julia DeWahl: and what's going to come out the other side.
[00:18:19] Julia DeWahl: Another thing that happened with some of these Trump executive orders
[00:18:22] Julia DeWahl: is the DOE pathways, Department of Energy pathways,
[00:18:25] Julia DeWahl: have been also unopened and unblocked for test reactors.
[00:18:29] Julia DeWahl: And so actually in terriers,
[00:18:30] Julia DeWahl: as part of this new test reactor program,
[00:18:32] Julia DeWahl: which allows the DOE alongside usually like Idaho National Lab
[00:18:37] Julia DeWahl: to be sort of your regulator as you're testing your first reactors
[00:18:41] Julia DeWahl: so that you don't have to spend all this time up front with the NRC
[00:18:44] Julia DeWahl: or something that you're just still innovating on, right?
[00:18:46] Julia DeWahl: And iterating on.
[00:18:48] Julia DeWahl: And so that's a really nice, I think, like, first step
[00:18:51] Julia DeWahl: before you go through the NRC.
[00:18:53] Well, wait, so let me make sure I'm giving this rise.
[00:18:54] Unknown Host: There is now a Trump era change
[00:18:56] Unknown Host: where we essentially, for the first time ever,
[00:18:58] Unknown Host: have a second nuclear regulator
[00:19:00] Unknown Host: where you can go the NRC path.
[00:19:02] Unknown Host: But also there's a regulatory sandbox where you can start
[00:19:05] Unknown Host: by working with the DOE
[00:19:07] Unknown Host: and get up and running there.
[00:19:10] Unknown Host: Yeah, that's something right.
[00:19:11] Unknown Host: How big is the sandbox?
[00:19:12] Unknown Host: I mean, the DOE has always been a path.
[00:19:14] Julia DeWahl: There actually technically has always been a path within the military
[00:19:17] Julia DeWahl: because they licensed their own reactors with summering.
[00:19:19] Julia DeWahl: So it's always kind of been there,
[00:19:20] Julia DeWahl: but hard to navigate, not well-staff, not well known about.
[00:19:24] Julia DeWahl: And now it's kind of like everyone's watching.
[00:19:26] Julia DeWahl: Let's go, let's go, DOE, let's go, you know,
[00:19:29] Julia DeWahl: INL at Idaho National Lab
[00:19:32] Julia DeWahl: and let's make these things happen.
[00:19:33] Julia DeWahl: So there's just been a lot of like stated,
[00:19:34] Julia DeWahl: like, you must enable this thing.
[00:19:36] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:19:37] Julia DeWahl: And like, now here's some,
[00:19:39] Julia DeWahl: it's actually a zero dollar program,
[00:19:41] Julia DeWahl: but it gives you unlimited access to staff
[00:19:44] Julia DeWahl: and all these other things.
[00:19:45] Julia DeWahl: And the point is like everyone's watching
[00:19:46] Julia DeWahl: to see how fast you can get one of these reactors through safely.
[00:19:49] Julia DeWahl: So are you guys going to the DOE routes first?
[00:19:51] Unknown Host: Yep, we are.
[00:19:52] Unknown Host: And the DOE route.
[00:19:53] Julia DeWahl: I mean, to say like,
[00:19:55] Julia DeWahl: you know, the Army is now also able to license its own reactors
[00:20:00] Julia DeWahl: alongside the Navy, which already does.
[00:20:02] Julia DeWahl: Yep.
[00:20:03] Julia DeWahl: So that will absolutely be our first stop.
[00:20:04] Julia DeWahl: The NRC really only license,
[00:20:07] Julia DeWahl: sorry, regulates.
[00:20:09] Julia DeWahl: Civilian electricity.
[00:20:10] Julia DeWahl: So civilian power.
[00:20:11] Julia DeWahl: So we actually don't need to even go there yet.
[00:20:13] Julia DeWahl: I see.
[00:20:13] Julia DeWahl: So you could be selling a lot of reactors.
[00:20:15] Unknown Host: And never go through the NRC.
[00:20:16] Unknown Host: Well, basically, do our test reactors with the DOE,
[00:20:20] Julia DeWahl: alongside the DOD,
[00:20:22] Julia DeWahl: who has the jurisdiction to regulate.
[00:20:25] Julia DeWahl: Which is great.
[00:20:26] Julia DeWahl: I don't know.
[00:20:27] Unknown Host: So this is the rare bipartisan issue.
[00:20:29] Unknown Host: It's a true kind of a gem.
[00:20:32] Julia DeWahl: I can paint three key energy futures.
[00:20:36] Unknown Host: One is the solar and regular renewables for you,
[00:20:42] Unknown Host: at Casey Hennmer.
[00:20:42] Unknown Host: Well, it's just on this podcast.
[00:20:44] Unknown Host: Solar will get very cheap batteries.
[00:20:46] Unknown Host: We'll get very cheap enough
[00:20:48] Unknown Host: such that you can go all in on solar and batteries,
[00:20:51] Unknown Host: maybe some other renewables in the mix.
[00:20:53] Unknown Host: But there you go.
[00:20:54] Unknown Host: That's nothing we'll be able to cost compete with that.
[00:20:56] Unknown Host: That's one vision.
[00:20:56] Unknown Host: Another is that we will rediscover nuclear efficient
[00:21:00] Unknown Host: and we'll figure out
[00:21:02] Unknown Host: to spend fuel on everything like that.
[00:21:04] Unknown Host: And we'll just do what we used to do,
[00:21:06] Unknown Host: which is build nuclear power plants
[00:21:08] Unknown Host: at larger scale,
[00:21:10] Unknown Host: and that delivers us enough clean energy.
[00:21:12] Unknown Host: A third view is that fusion will work,
[00:21:15] Unknown Host: and we'll actually have nuclear fusion
[00:21:18] Unknown Host: at useful meaningful scale of the grid.
[00:21:21] Between those scenarios, how would you and the captain?
[00:21:24] Unknown Host: I think it's...
[00:21:25] Julia DeWahl: I'm going to leave fusion out
[00:21:26] Julia DeWahl: because I'm not enough of an expert to know
[00:21:28] Julia DeWahl: when and how that will happen.
[00:21:30] Julia DeWahl: I would love for that to happen.
[00:21:31] Julia DeWahl: How exciting, right?
[00:21:32] Julia DeWahl: Between the first two,
[00:21:33] Julia DeWahl: we do a lot of market manipulation of our energy markets.
[00:21:38] Julia DeWahl: And there's a little bit of flavor of the administration
[00:21:41] Julia DeWahl: that does happen, especially between renewables
[00:21:44] Julia DeWahl: and oil and gas, right?
[00:21:45] Julia DeWahl: Nuclear has been a little bit actually immune to that.
[00:21:49] Julia DeWahl: But so there hasn't really been almost a true market
[00:21:52] Julia DeWahl: for this stuff.
[00:21:52] Julia DeWahl: Like, the renewables have been heavily subsidized for a while,
[00:21:56] Julia DeWahl: and nuclear has not been.
[00:21:57] Julia DeWahl: That did change in 2022 with the IRA.
[00:21:59] Julia DeWahl: There's now production tax credits for nuclear,
[00:22:01] Julia DeWahl: which has a lot of ripple effects.
[00:22:03] Julia DeWahl: But I think we're going to see a lot more progress
[00:22:05] Julia DeWahl: with solar and batteries in particular.
[00:22:07] Julia DeWahl: There is a reason, however,
[00:22:09] Julia DeWahl: that the hyperscalers who are committed
[00:22:11] Julia DeWahl: to their climate targets are not just going for solar farms, right?
[00:22:15] Julia DeWahl: Like, why are they even thinking about nuclear
[00:22:17] Julia DeWahl: if solar is so cheap?
[00:22:18] Julia DeWahl: And it's because actually to get true 100% 24-7 coverage,
[00:22:23] Julia DeWahl: the battery or the excess buildout is massive.
[00:22:25] Julia DeWahl: It is really expensive.
[00:22:27] Julia DeWahl: It's basically on par with nuclear costs.
[00:22:30] Julia DeWahl: So we're not there yet.
[00:22:31] Julia DeWahl: What's one thing to say?
[00:22:33] Julia DeWahl: The other is that the cost of solar,
[00:22:37] Julia DeWahl: at the panel level, is dirt cheap, right?
[00:22:39] Julia DeWahl: And installing it, dirt cheap,
[00:22:41] Julia DeWahl: but to actually integrate it, build the transmission,
[00:22:44] Julia DeWahl: and then the added grid complexity
[00:22:46] Julia DeWahl: where you need now these peaker gas plants to run
[00:22:49] Julia DeWahl: when the clouds come.
[00:22:51] Julia DeWahl: And that kind of thing, like, that actually has a ton of costs
[00:22:54] Julia DeWahl: and it sort of hidden costs.
[00:22:55] Julia DeWahl: I think it's underappreciated,
[00:22:57] Julia DeWahl: certainly by the solar maxi's out there.
[00:22:59] Julia DeWahl: It's real.
[00:23:02] Julia DeWahl: I think we're always going to want to have
[00:23:04] Julia DeWahl: multiple sources of energy, right?
[00:23:06] Julia DeWahl: It's like diversity is good.
[00:23:07] Julia DeWahl: It's like if natural gas prices are through the roof,
[00:23:10] Julia DeWahl: like, hey, we have these other things.
[00:23:11] Julia DeWahl: We have this base load nuclear,
[00:23:13] Julia DeWahl: which has been just so stable for us.
[00:23:16] Julia DeWahl: And I think we're going to want to have everything.
[00:23:18] Julia DeWahl: I actually don't think there's going to be a world
[00:23:20] Julia DeWahl: that's going to be 100% nuclear.
[00:23:22] Julia DeWahl: Is it diversity of energy sources valuable
[00:23:26] Unknown Host: because the solar maximum,
[00:23:28] Unknown Host: this would say, no, it's fine.
[00:23:29] Unknown Host: So it will just take everything.
[00:23:31] Unknown Host: And wouldn't the nuclear maxi must say,
[00:23:33] Unknown Host: just we can have a lot of, you know,
[00:23:35] Unknown Host: we figure out how to at scale
[00:23:36] Unknown Host: a produced nuclear power plants.
[00:23:37] Unknown Host: And why do you need that gas?
[00:23:38] Unknown Host: If you, if you, it's a good, it's a good push.
[00:23:41] Julia DeWahl: If you are able to own through and through your whole supply chain,
[00:23:45] Julia DeWahl: you make the panels, you mine,
[00:23:47] Julia DeWahl: you mine and process the minerals,
[00:23:48] Julia DeWahl: which we have like zero interest in doing as Americans.
[00:23:51] Julia DeWahl: Like all that dirty work is done in China and elsewhere.
[00:23:54] Julia DeWahl: If you really did all that yourself,
[00:23:55] Julia DeWahl: then I could say, okay, you, you own it, you can do it.
[00:23:58] Julia DeWahl: Right now, at least you have,
[00:23:59] Julia DeWahl: hey, if you're not your gas pipelines,
[00:24:01] Julia DeWahl: get shut down, actually, it's not a problem for us, right?
[00:24:02] Julia DeWahl: We're like not even an importer anymore.
[00:24:05] Julia DeWahl: We're actually, we're good.
[00:24:07] Julia DeWahl: Yeah. This is actually the reason that,
[00:24:08] Julia DeWahl: do you know what percentage of,
[00:24:10] Julia DeWahl: of France's electricity is from nuclear?
[00:24:13] But it's declining, right?
[00:24:14] Unknown Host: But historically, it's been around 70%.
[00:24:17] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:24:17] Unknown Host: Do you know the US?
[00:24:19] US nuclear, oh, it's small.
[00:24:21] Unknown Host: It's five, 10%.
[00:24:23] Unknown Host: It's actually more.
[00:24:24] Julia DeWahl: Really?
[00:24:24] Julia DeWahl: 18.
[00:24:25] Julia DeWahl: Oh, okay.
[00:24:25] Julia DeWahl: And everyone thinks it's below five.
[00:24:28] Julia DeWahl: It's like, when I got into this, I thought it was like two percent.
[00:24:30] Julia DeWahl: Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:30] Julia DeWahl: But anyway, my point is that France made a very, very deliberate decision
[00:24:34] Julia DeWahl: to actually go to 70%.
[00:24:35] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:24:35] Julia DeWahl: If not, you know, more at the time in the 70s,
[00:24:37] Julia DeWahl: because I had no carbon resources, right?
[00:24:39] Julia DeWahl: So they didn't have the ability to say,
[00:24:41] Julia DeWahl: oh, I'll just dig in our backyard and we'll be fine.
[00:24:42] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:24:43] Julia DeWahl: And actually, Uranium,
[00:24:45] Julia DeWahl: while it does require, you know,
[00:24:47] Julia DeWahl: digging out the ground or whatever,
[00:24:48] Julia DeWahl: it's so much easier to store.
[00:24:49] Julia DeWahl: It's a million times as dense as coal, right?
[00:24:51] Julia DeWahl: Right.
[00:24:52] Julia DeWahl: So it's a lot easier to work with than,
[00:24:54] Julia DeWahl: you know, the reason people get uptight
[00:24:56] Julia DeWahl: about oil and gas supply is that it's like not easy to store.
[00:25:00] Julia DeWahl: And if it's not easier for you to come by,
[00:25:01] Julia DeWahl: like, you better well have like good geopolitical relationships.
[00:25:04] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:25:05] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:25:05] Julia DeWahl: Anyway, this world and where it's headed,
[00:25:07] Julia DeWahl: I think it's still going to involve multiple sources.
[00:25:17] Julius work involves managing a lot of risk,
[00:25:20] Unknown Host: unsolved physics, complex engineering,
[00:25:21] Unknown Host: and a lot of regulatory scrutiny.
[00:25:23] Unknown Host: Managing risk for an internet retailer
[00:25:25] Unknown Host: shouldn't be that complex,
[00:25:26] Unknown Host: but sometimes it can feel like it.
[00:25:28] Unknown Host: Internet fraudsters now operate on industrial scales,
[00:25:31] Unknown Host: that it's hacked strategically when you're sleeping
[00:25:32] Unknown Host: and they use AI to sharpen their attacks now.
[00:25:35] Stripes defense against fraud come this from its scale.
[00:25:38] Unknown Host: When a payment happens on your site,
[00:25:39] Unknown Host: there's a 92% chance we've seen that exact card before,
[00:25:42] Unknown Host: so it's easier for us to spot misuse.
[00:25:44] Unknown Host: And we recently expanded radar to block
[00:25:46] Unknown Host: other kinds of fraud,
[00:25:47] Unknown Host: like retrial abuse,
[00:25:48] Unknown Host: promotion abuse,
[00:25:49] Unknown Host: and refund abuse.
[00:25:50] Unknown Host: Stripe now processes trillions of dollars of payments
[00:25:53] Unknown Host: each year.
[00:25:54] Unknown Host: And every transaction of the Stripe network
[00:25:55] Unknown Host: makes the next one safer for everyone.
[00:25:57] Unknown Host: So you can focus on your product
[00:25:59] Unknown Host: and not on developing a world-class
[00:26:01] Unknown Host: counter fraud division.
[00:26:02] Unknown Host: To let radar handle the fraud,
[00:26:04] Unknown Host: so you can get back to building your product,
[00:26:05] Unknown Host: go to Stripe.com slash radar.
[00:26:11] Tell me about the supply chain for nuclear fuels.
[00:26:13] Unknown Host: Yeah, I mean, so you dig your any amount of the ground
[00:26:16] Julia DeWahl: and then you need to convert it to a gaseous state
[00:26:19] Julia DeWahl: so that you can enrich it and have the,
[00:26:20] Julia DeWahl: you cannot put in a center of use,
[00:26:22] Julia DeWahl: it goes like this and the heavier isotopes go out
[00:26:25] Julia DeWahl: and the lighter ones stay in and you can pick those out
[00:26:28] and make those into your fuel.
[00:26:29] Julia DeWahl: The mining part has been something that we've hardly kept alive.
[00:26:32] Julia DeWahl: I mean, there was at one point like
[00:26:34] Julia DeWahl: couple of mining operations going in the US
[00:26:36] Julia DeWahl: where the last 10 years or so it's been like
[00:26:39] Julia DeWahl: 1% of nuclear fuel use in the US was actually
[00:26:42] Julia DeWahl: domestically mined.
[00:26:43] Julia DeWahl: And now where are the last few
[00:26:45] Julia DeWahl: or any mines in the US?
[00:26:46] Unknown Host: There are places like where you would think,
[00:26:48] Julia DeWahl: Texas, Wyoming,
[00:26:49] Julia DeWahl: those sorts of places in the western states.
[00:26:52] Julia DeWahl: But we're now, we now again, like everything else,
[00:26:55] Julia DeWahl: have said, okay, wake up, let's actually
[00:26:56] Julia DeWahl: resource some of this stuff.
[00:26:57] Julia DeWahl: So we're starting to see more uranium mining.
[00:27:00] Julia DeWahl: Conversion and enrichment is still largely done overseas.
[00:27:03] Julia DeWahl: And yeah, we're still buying like almost 50% of our uranium
[00:27:07] Julia DeWahl: from Russia and kind of exo-vehate states.
[00:27:10] Julia DeWahl: So I think it is important that we're thinking about like,
[00:27:13] Julia DeWahl: how do we have far more of a domestic supply chain?
[00:27:16] Julia DeWahl: We have the ability to do it.
[00:27:17] Julia DeWahl: We have the uranium.
[00:27:18] Julia DeWahl: And actually, there's a little bit of Silicon Valley
[00:27:21] Julia DeWahl: DNA entering the space with General Matter,
[00:27:23] Julia DeWahl: which has gotten Nolan's company out of Founder's Fund.
[00:27:25] Julia DeWahl: So he's getting into the enrichment space.
[00:27:27] Julia DeWahl: And so I think-
[00:27:28] Julia DeWahl: They are uranium enrichment company.
[00:27:30] Unknown Host: They are an uranium enrichment company,
[00:27:32] Julia DeWahl: which is like real picks and shovels for a real hard,
[00:27:36] Julia DeWahl: you know, Adam's business to do that.
[00:27:38] Unknown Host: But I think it's, you know, it's really meaningful work.
[00:27:40] Julia DeWahl: I think it's really important.
[00:27:42] Julia DeWahl: Do you care more about the mining,
[00:27:44] Unknown Host: the enrichment happening in the US,
[00:27:45] Unknown Host: or just there has to be, you know,
[00:27:47] Unknown Host: an independent supply chain for the whole thing?
[00:27:49] Unknown Host: I think you just want diversity.
[00:27:51] Julia DeWahl: You know, you don't want everything from one place.
[00:27:53] Julia DeWahl: And I think we do want to have capability.
[00:27:55] Julia DeWahl: So I think all of it should be at least partially done here.
[00:27:58] Julia DeWahl: And with our allies.
[00:27:59] Julia DeWahl: How do you end up starting in Tari's?
[00:28:00] Unknown Host: Gosh, I mean-
[00:28:01] Julia DeWahl: Most people do not happen on this.
[00:28:02] Unknown Host: No, no, you don't really happen upon it.
[00:28:04] Unknown Host: I was working at SpaceX at the time
[00:28:06] Julia DeWahl: when I first started reading about nuclear.
[00:28:09] Julia DeWahl: And it was when I was actually working
[00:28:11] Julia DeWahl: on getting Starlings into Ukraine.
[00:28:13] Julia DeWahl: So after the Russian-Vated Ukraine.
[00:28:15] Julia DeWahl: And I just started like reading more about the conflict there,
[00:28:18] Julia DeWahl: probably more than I normally would have,
[00:28:20] Julia DeWahl: because I was actually speaking with Ukrainians
[00:28:22] Julia DeWahl: and like thinking about what was going on there.
[00:28:24] Julia DeWahl: And I was a history major.
[00:28:25] Julia DeWahl: So I think there was just a little bit of like,
[00:28:27] Julia DeWahl: oh, geopolitics, resources are important.
[00:28:29] Julia DeWahl: Russia has a lot of resources.
[00:28:31] Julia DeWahl: You know, randomly my cousin is a CEO of a glass factory
[00:28:35] Julia DeWahl: making like literally glasses like this.
[00:28:37] Julia DeWahl: And he's like, we're going bankrupt
[00:28:39] Julia DeWahl: because of energy prices.
[00:28:40] Julia DeWahl: And you're like, golly, what is going on?
[00:28:42] Julia DeWahl: And then I read about Germany and the nuclear power plants
[00:28:44] Julia DeWahl: that were shutting off to turn on coal
[00:28:46] Julia DeWahl: in a place that is like-
[00:28:47] Julia DeWahl: It was so insane.
[00:28:48] Julia DeWahl: Creating party, crazy, right?
[00:28:49] Julia DeWahl: So I was like, what could be so compelling
[00:28:52] Julia DeWahl: that someone would do something, you know,
[00:28:55] Julia DeWahl: so counter to their own good, right?
[00:28:57] Julia DeWahl: As a country, as a nation.
[00:28:59] Julia DeWahl: And I had the time, again, I knew nothing about nuclear.
[00:29:02] Julia DeWahl: I didn't know the difference in fishing
[00:29:04] Julia DeWahl: and fusion honestly at the time.
[00:29:05] Julia DeWahl: But I certainly didn't know that it was a pretty big part
[00:29:07] Julia DeWahl: of our grid and other things.
[00:29:09] Julia DeWahl: But it just was one of those like,
[00:29:10] Julia DeWahl: completely under-solubrated under-champion by anyone.
[00:29:14] Julia DeWahl: The climate tech climate people really weren't into it either.
[00:29:17] Julia DeWahl: And so I just kind of got me curious about it.
[00:29:20] Julia DeWahl: And then just started reading more,
[00:29:21] Julia DeWahl: wrote a piece that I posted on Twitter.
[00:29:24] Julia DeWahl: And it's actually how I met Jordan, who is my co-founder.
[00:29:27] Julia DeWahl: And he's the one who actually had the vision
[00:29:29] Julia DeWahl: for microactors for the military.
[00:29:32] Julia DeWahl: And I just said, what a great beachhead,
[00:29:33] Julia DeWahl: like again, premium power, great thesis
[00:29:36] Julia DeWahl: to go to market with.
[00:29:37] Julia DeWahl: I just really got into the into the topic.
[00:29:40] Julia DeWahl: How does he arrive at that as a beachhead?
[00:29:42] I think you just say, where can you go
[00:29:45] Julia DeWahl: that you don't have to compete on that LCOE level
[00:29:47] Julia DeWahl: against the cheap solar panels?
[00:29:49] Julia DeWahl: Where do you go where there's a real need?
[00:29:52] Julia DeWahl: And mission assurance for something
[00:29:55] Julia DeWahl: critical to the military, they will pay for that.
[00:29:58] Julia DeWahl: This is also an area where they were,
[00:30:00] Julia DeWahl: obviously behind the Manhattan Project.
[00:30:02] Julia DeWahl: They are here to help develop new technologies.
[00:30:05] Julia DeWahl: And so what a great partner to have
[00:30:07] Julia DeWahl: when trying to do something like this.
[00:30:09] Julia DeWahl: Has DARPA played this stuff at all
[00:30:11] Unknown Host: or has it come from itself?
[00:30:12] Unknown Host: Like you're working with the main branches.
[00:30:14] Unknown Host: Yeah, we are not working with DARPA,
[00:30:17] Julia DeWahl: mostly because it's actually not as technically risky
[00:30:20] Julia DeWahl: as you might even think.
[00:30:21] Julia DeWahl: Like, even-
[00:30:22] Julia DeWahl: They prefer things further out the risk.
[00:30:24] Unknown Host: Exactly.
[00:30:24] Unknown Host: We actually, in a funny way,
[00:30:26] Julia DeWahl: it's not even really a tech problem.
[00:30:28] Julia DeWahl: Totally.
[00:30:28] Julia DeWahl: You know, I mean, it's hard.
[00:30:30] Julia DeWahl: It's hard to build these things,
[00:30:31] Julia DeWahl: but it's not-
[00:30:32] Julia DeWahl: But someone just needs to go out to, yeah.
[00:30:33] Julia DeWahl: It's not novel in that way.
[00:30:34] Julia DeWahl: That's interesting.
[00:30:36] Unknown Host: What lessons have you brought from your prior experience?
[00:30:39] Unknown Host: At SpaceX, that opened door to building empires.
[00:30:42] Unknown Host: You know, one of the things I really took away from SpaceX
[00:30:46] Julia DeWahl: was just like really getting into it.
[00:30:48] Julia DeWahl: It's a very confrontational culture.
[00:30:51] And it's not afraid to say like,
[00:30:54] Julia DeWahl: screw your next meeting.
[00:30:55] Julia DeWahl: Like, we need to keep talking about this.
[00:30:57] Julia DeWahl: And I love that.
[00:30:58] Julia DeWahl: Like, I want to bring that energy everywhere I go.
[00:31:00] Julia DeWahl: It's like, if you are unsure about something,
[00:31:04] Julia DeWahl: if you're questioning something,
[00:31:06] Julia DeWahl: you should probably stop and like dig into it.
[00:31:09] Julia DeWahl: We had this thing called the Five Wise.
[00:31:11] Julia DeWahl: I don't know if you ever can't use that.
[00:31:12] Julia DeWahl: I don't know.
[00:31:13] Julia DeWahl: It's like a Silicon Valley little quips.
[00:31:17] Julia DeWahl: But it's like that on steroids.
[00:31:19] Julia DeWahl: And I think like that,
[00:31:21] Julia DeWahl: the pausing to like probe super deeply,
[00:31:24] Julia DeWahl: question things like really hash things out
[00:31:28] Julia DeWahl: was a big take-o-ile and like, wow,
[00:31:30] Julia DeWahl: that's really effective.
[00:31:32] Julia DeWahl: At like getting to the right answer,
[00:31:34] Julia DeWahl: at making a decision, at changing course when you need to.
[00:31:37] Julia DeWahl: And so I've tried to bring some of that.
[00:31:39] Julia DeWahl: Two entries.
[00:31:40] Julia DeWahl: You know, investors are hot and cool
[00:31:42] Unknown Host: down the hard tax depending on when you're raising money
[00:31:44] Unknown Host: and everything like this.
[00:31:45] Unknown Host: You know, presumably you're,
[00:31:47] Unknown Host: there's a,
[00:31:50] Unknown Host: a J-curve in investing in Antares
[00:31:52] Unknown Host: for those is definitely some R&D
[00:31:54] Unknown Host: before you eventually start paying it back with revenues.
[00:31:57] Unknown Host: Just how does the experience of raising money for this?
[00:31:59] Unknown Host: It's going to get harder.
[00:32:01] Julia DeWahl: I think it hasn't been hard to date only because
[00:32:03] Julia DeWahl: there is interest and excitement around nuclear.
[00:32:07] Julia DeWahl: There's, you know, it's also just fewer dollars in the beginning.
[00:32:11] Julia DeWahl: You're kind of like honeymoon phase of all of that.
[00:32:13] Julia DeWahl: I think it will get harder.
[00:32:14] Julia DeWahl: I think we now, the time, time's a ticking.
[00:32:18] Julia DeWahl: Like it's like, okay, let's see your next technical milestones.
[00:32:21] Julia DeWahl: It's a criticality test.
[00:32:22] Julia DeWahl: Obviously the full reactor end of 2027.
[00:32:26] Julia DeWahl: I think it will be challenging.
[00:32:28] Julia DeWahl: And there are several reactor companies out there.
[00:32:30] Julia DeWahl: So it's a bit of a race.
[00:32:32] Julia DeWahl: I think it's going to be fun.
[00:32:33] Julia DeWahl: I mean, I wonder what Paul and Mark are going to have to say.
[00:32:35] Julia DeWahl: Several reactor companies out there.
[00:32:37] Unknown Host: Even at the end of the market that you guys are going after.
[00:32:39] Unknown Host: Yeah, everyone has their different niche, right?
[00:32:42] Julia DeWahl: I think our niche is, again, the smallest, the most DOD-oriented.
[00:32:46] Julia DeWahl: There's a lot of microreactor companies or SMR.
[00:32:49] Julia DeWahl: And I'm saying I'm doing this because it's like,
[00:32:51] Julia DeWahl: are they SMR or microactors?
[00:32:52] Julia DeWahl: Anyway, that are going after data centers and the data center build out.
[00:32:56] Julia DeWahl: Which is an amazing market.
[00:32:57] Julia DeWahl: I mean, amazing.
[00:32:58] Julia DeWahl: I think people will pay a lot more.
[00:33:00] Julia DeWahl: Again, going back to the premium PowerPoint,
[00:33:02] Julia DeWahl: they will pay more for power for this.
[00:33:04] Julia DeWahl: Not exactly our target market.
[00:33:06] Julia DeWahl: Right.
[00:33:07] This, I mean, so your niche in the market,
[00:33:09] Unknown Host: it seems like you guys have selected a part of the market
[00:33:13] Unknown Host: where maybe this last competition.
[00:33:15] Unknown Host: There are still some people going after the military applications.
[00:33:18] Julia DeWahl: They're always are.
[00:33:18] Julia DeWahl: I mean, if you have a good idea,
[00:33:19] Julia DeWahl: there's going to be a few people working on it.
[00:33:21] Julia DeWahl: How come the intensive is it going to be
[00:33:23] Unknown Host: to get your product to market?
[00:33:24] Unknown Host: Oh, in the hundreds of millions.
[00:33:28] Julia DeWahl: I think what we,
[00:33:30] Julia DeWahl: it depends, I want you to mean by to market,
[00:33:31] Julia DeWahl: right? So I think our big milestones,
[00:33:33] Julia DeWahl: like can you build a reactor,
[00:33:34] Julia DeWahl: prove it, turn it on, it's producing power?
[00:33:36] Julia DeWahl: Yeah.
[00:33:36] Julia DeWahl: Then I think you can think about interesting layers of capital
[00:33:40] Julia DeWahl: in terms of pre-orders for your reactor.
[00:33:43] Julia DeWahl: There's going to be an expression hundreds of other rides.
[00:33:45] Unknown Host: Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:46] Julia DeWahl: Um, bigger government grants.
[00:33:48] Julia DeWahl: So we're kind of still in the like hundreds of thousands
[00:33:50] Julia DeWahl: of mill, single digit millions of dollars of grants
[00:33:53] Julia DeWahl: that we are getting right now.
[00:33:55] Julia DeWahl: But you're, you're moving into the tens of millions of dollars R&D grants.
[00:33:58] Julia DeWahl: And then you want to eventually move into that kind of like program
[00:34:01] Julia DeWahl: of record, real dollars.
[00:34:02] Julia DeWahl: There's a really interesting program right now
[00:34:05] Julia DeWahl: that the army has put out called the Janus program.
[00:34:08] Julia DeWahl: Are you familiar with the COTS program that SpaceX used to bring,
[00:34:12] Julia DeWahl: to kind of develop their first reactor?
[00:34:14] Julia DeWahl: Not by name, but I'm familiar with it.
[00:34:15] Unknown Host: Marshall Orbital Transport System.
[00:34:16] Julia DeWahl: Yeah, yeah, I'm familiar with the product.
[00:34:18] Julia DeWahl: It was like the innovation basically to say like,
[00:34:19] Julia DeWahl: let's say something that's not cost plus.
[00:34:21] Julia DeWahl: And let's actually do something that's milestone-based.
[00:34:25] Julia DeWahl: And you know, well, basically we'll cut you
[00:34:28] Julia DeWahl: if you don't hit the milestone.
[00:34:29] Julia DeWahl: And it's fixed contract.
[00:34:31] Julia DeWahl: We're not just going to do pay you for whatever.
[00:34:32] Julia DeWahl: Sorry, the army has taken that model a bit.
[00:34:35] Julia DeWahl: And I think he used that as inspiration for this Janus program
[00:34:37] Julia DeWahl: where they're saying we're going to fund up to kind of three to five companies
[00:34:41] Julia DeWahl: to build their first prototype alongside us, kind of out of base.
[00:34:45] Julia DeWahl: And then we will kind of choose a winner.
[00:34:48] Julia DeWahl: And we want to build five to ten reactors if not more on basis.
[00:34:51] Julia DeWahl: And so they're like the demand signal now is hot.
[00:34:54] Julia DeWahl: And so this is going to be, this is great for our future fundraising
[00:34:57] Julia DeWahl: for the industry in general.
[00:34:58] Julia DeWahl: It's like very, very good demand.
[00:35:00] Julia DeWahl: A lot of it gets built on military,
[00:35:02] Unknown Host: you, you, you, you as defense contracting.
[00:35:05] Unknown Host: What is your experience as someone who's, you know,
[00:35:08] Unknown Host: attempting to sell it to the military being?
[00:35:10] I mean, people are actually kind of well aware
[00:35:13] Julia DeWahl: that this cost plus model is not great.
[00:35:16] Julia DeWahl: The question is like, well, what are the alternatives
[00:35:18] Julia DeWahl: who's going to go do it?
[00:35:19] Julia DeWahl: And Rolesman, an amazing example of that.
[00:35:21] Julia DeWahl: So I think a lot of us in Hardtech really look to them as, you know,
[00:35:24] Julia DeWahl: what we try to emulate.
[00:35:26] Julia DeWahl: There are, every branch of military has these innovative, you know,
[00:35:31] Julia DeWahl: arms that tell you like, hey, we want to hear about your ideas.
[00:35:33] Julia DeWahl: And they do, actually, though you can go talk to them.
[00:35:35] Julia DeWahl: They're giving out grants for things like, I do think everyone wants the innovation.
[00:35:40] Julia DeWahl: They are, you know, and in the standard age of like information everywhere.
[00:35:44] Julia DeWahl: Like you can learn a lot quickly.
[00:35:45] Julia DeWahl: They do want to work with startups.
[00:35:47] Julia DeWahl: So I think I think people only seem more of it.
[00:35:48] Julia DeWahl: But, you know, you have things like the government shutdown
[00:35:51] Julia DeWahl: and like the pace of government is slow.
[00:35:53] Julia DeWahl: So, you know, you've got to just kind of, you know,
[00:35:56] Julia DeWahl: be able to keep pushing those timelines.
[00:35:58] Julia DeWahl: Again, while not running out of money.
[00:36:00] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:36:00] Julia DeWahl: To be able to sort of make it through that value of death.
[00:36:03] Julia DeWahl: What's been hard harder than you expected, building a terrace?
[00:36:06] Unknown Host: Because it's been expected broadly to be hard.
[00:36:09] Unknown Host: You expect there to be a lot of technical risks,
[00:36:11] Unknown Host: problems, and things like that.
[00:36:12] Unknown Host: Harder than expected.
[00:36:16] There's a couple things.
[00:36:17] Julia DeWahl: I mean, I think, gosh, recruiting is always hard.
[00:36:22] Julia DeWahl: You're up against the space,
[00:36:24] Julia DeWahl: X's of the world that have just a lot more credibility, right?
[00:36:27] Julia DeWahl: When you're the known in person,
[00:36:28] Julia DeWahl: that the very beginning can be hard.
[00:36:31] Julia DeWahl: I think there's a lot of complexity.
[00:36:35] Julia DeWahl: Even though I said, you know,
[00:36:36] Julia DeWahl: we're making so much progress in regulation.
[00:36:37] Julia DeWahl: There's still red tape everywhere.
[00:36:39] Julia DeWahl: Things cost more than they probably should.
[00:36:42] Julia DeWahl: You know, we spend a lot of money paying the national labs
[00:36:45] Julia DeWahl: to do things like clear out a pit
[00:36:47] Julia DeWahl: so that we can test our reactor.
[00:36:49] Julia DeWahl: And it's like, we're paying for that.
[00:36:50] Julia DeWahl: And they're like, you know, he had hundreds of $1,000.
[00:36:52] Julia DeWahl: Here's the bill.
[00:36:53] Julia DeWahl: So there's stuff that you're like,
[00:36:55] Julia DeWahl: gosh, there's really a lot of expense everywhere.
[00:36:58] Julia DeWahl: And it just slows things down.
[00:37:00] Julia DeWahl: And so I guess we were, you know, somewhat ready for that.
[00:37:03] Julia DeWahl: But some of this stuff just seems silly.
[00:37:05] Julia DeWahl: And when you're building in software,
[00:37:07] Julia DeWahl: you just, you know, you don't have to worry about your
[00:37:09] Julia DeWahl: just sit there, code, and do your thing,
[00:37:10] Julia DeWahl: and go to go to go right to market.
[00:37:12] Julia DeWahl: When you have to work with the real world,
[00:37:14] Julia DeWahl: you have to, you know,
[00:37:15] you have to kind of play their games a little bit.
[00:37:17] Julia DeWahl: And you have to follow the process.
[00:37:20] Julia DeWahl: In some ways, and there's, there's not always a way,
[00:37:22] Julia DeWahl: kind of around it.
[00:37:23] Julia DeWahl: Sometimes it's just through.
[00:37:24] Julia DeWahl: You said there's still a lot of red tape
[00:37:26] Unknown Host: despite the fact that, you know,
[00:37:27] Unknown Host: there's been the first bite near and then
[00:37:29] Unknown Host: Trumpier improvements.
[00:37:31] Unknown Host: If you were in charge, I don't know,
[00:37:34] Unknown Host: energies are, or you know,
[00:37:36] Unknown Host: we'll give you a roll with enough powers across all these
[00:37:38] Unknown Host: departments.
[00:37:40] What would you change?
[00:37:41] Unknown Host: What would you think the specific improvements we could make?
[00:37:43] Unknown Host: Or if I were fully in charge of energy,
[00:37:47] Julia DeWahl: I would love to see the US government be a buyer.
[00:37:50] Julia DeWahl: I think that is just like actually the,
[00:37:52] Julia DeWahl: the NASA was a buyer for SpaceX's
[00:37:55] Julia DeWahl: eventual launch product.
[00:37:58] Julia DeWahl: I think having the US government be a customer
[00:38:01] Julia DeWahl: for nuclear would be great.
[00:38:02] Julia DeWahl: And so we have this a little bit with the DUDE.
[00:38:04] Julia DeWahl: It was a very interesting announcement
[00:38:05] Julia DeWahl: that just came out a week or two ago
[00:38:07] Julia DeWahl: that doesn't have a ton of detail.
[00:38:09] Julia DeWahl: But it's starting in this direction.
[00:38:11] Julia DeWahl: I think it's very positive.
[00:38:13] Julia DeWahl: I'm a small government person,
[00:38:14] Julia DeWahl: so I don't say this lightly.
[00:38:16] Julia DeWahl: But I do think there are certain things
[00:38:17] Julia DeWahl: when it's national security related
[00:38:19] Julia DeWahl: and things like energy resilience,
[00:38:20] Julia DeWahl: like there should be public-private partnership.
[00:38:22] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:38:23] Julia DeWahl: But anyway, the announcement is that
[00:38:24] Julia DeWahl: the US government now wants to spend $80 billion
[00:38:28] Julia DeWahl: on nuclear development alongside Westinghouse.
[00:38:31] Julia DeWahl: So they basically chose in the technology.
[00:38:33] Julia DeWahl: And I think that's actually a good thing
[00:38:35] Julia DeWahl: because you don't want to,
[00:38:37] Julia DeWahl: you want to be able to build one thing
[00:38:39] Julia DeWahl: and then repeatedly build it so that you,
[00:38:41] Julia DeWahl: you're not reinventing the wheel every time.
[00:38:43] Julia DeWahl: You actually have kind of economies of scale,
[00:38:46] Julia DeWahl: like the learning curve that you've grown from doing that.
[00:38:49] Julia DeWahl: So I'm excited about that news.
[00:38:50] Julia DeWahl: I think that's the type of policy I'd want to see more of.
[00:38:53] Julia DeWahl: And we'll see how it goes.
[00:38:55] Julia DeWahl: I mean, this is the first,
[00:38:57] Julia DeWahl: this is like the biggest ever commercial,
[00:38:59] Julia DeWahl: nuclear, public-private partnership we've seen.
[00:39:02] Julia DeWahl: I'm sorry, specifically, they're buying from Westinghouse.
[00:39:04] Unknown Host: Just a large amount of nuclear power?
[00:39:06] Unknown Host: Well, it's a combination.
[00:39:08] Julia DeWahl: So this is what I mean, the details are a little fuzzy,
[00:39:10] Julia DeWahl: but they've announced $80 billion.
[00:39:12] Julia DeWahl: They've announced Westinghouse as the partner of choice.
[00:39:15] Julia DeWahl: Not all those dollars are going right to Westinghouse.
[00:39:16] Julia DeWahl: You're kind of, and that's a company that makes just the reactor itself.
[00:39:19] Julia DeWahl: So there's money that you would spend on a plant,
[00:39:22] or licensing fees, or whatever else that surrounds that.
[00:39:27] Julia DeWahl: But I think it's really positive.
[00:39:28] Julia DeWahl: I think it's what it does.
[00:39:29] Julia DeWahl: It's a catalyst for the whole industry,
[00:39:30] Julia DeWahl: like supply chain workforce.
[00:39:33] Julia DeWahl: People are now paying attention.
[00:39:34] Julia DeWahl: Like, oh, there's real dollars to be made here.
[00:39:37] Julia DeWahl: There's a huge trillion dollar asset under management,
[00:39:41] Julia DeWahl: company called Brookfield asset management.
[00:39:44] Julia DeWahl: And they've actually just gotten in the game as well.
[00:39:47] Julia DeWahl: In the last couple weeks, I'm sure there was like talk, right?
[00:39:51] Julia DeWahl: To take the VC summer plant that never got completed in South Carolina
[00:39:54] Julia DeWahl: and actually finish it.
[00:39:56] Julia DeWahl: And so again, they now have some nice tailwinds
[00:39:58] Julia DeWahl: with those new production subsidies.
[00:40:01] Julia DeWahl: They are partnering with the local utility to,
[00:40:04] Julia DeWahl: and again, a local utility doesn't have the risk appetite
[00:40:08] Julia DeWahl: to do this themselves, right?
[00:40:09] Julia DeWahl: Or the balance sheet to do this themselves.
[00:40:12] Julia DeWahl: There's some really nice, I think, market signal you get
[00:40:14] Julia DeWahl: when the government saying, we're going to spend $80 billion on this.
[00:40:18] Julia DeWahl: But I think it gets the rest of the industry moving.
[00:40:22] Julia DeWahl: As you guys were exploring and developing the early stages of your business plan,
[00:40:29] Unknown Host: did you consider for a product that is as tightly regulated as this?
[00:40:34] Unknown Host: Did you consider doing any jurisdiction shopping
[00:40:36] Unknown Host: or are you developing a product that you sell in Singapore,
[00:40:40] Unknown Host: or the UAE, or Prospera, or you know,
[00:40:42] Unknown Host: as some of our favourable jurisdiction?
[00:40:44] Unknown Host: Yeah, we've really didn't.
[00:40:45] Julia DeWahl: It felt like there was enough signal that we would be able to get through regulatory
[00:40:53] Julia DeWahl: and see some positive change.
[00:40:54] Julia DeWahl: There was enough, basically, demand signal within the US.
[00:40:57] Julia DeWahl: And it's, I don't know, we take pride in also building for our country, right?
[00:41:01] Julia DeWahl: And it feels good to be developing something for our military and our allies.
[00:41:06] Julia DeWahl: So we didn't really shop it around too much.
[00:41:08] Julia DeWahl: Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:09] Unknown Host: And I guess the US military is a large buyer in this case.
[00:41:11] Unknown Host: Very large buyer.
[00:41:12] Julia DeWahl: The largest buyer of non-commodity energy, if not all energy.
[00:41:15] Julia DeWahl: How soon afterwards will you go to, like I presume you want to do,
[00:41:21] civilian premium power use cases like,
[00:41:26] Unknown Host: like you're saying, in oil rig, seems like the obvious one,
[00:41:28] Unknown Host: that's ironically this, you know, it would be hard to get gas.
[00:41:32] Unknown Host: But because you'd be hard to get, we'll find, you know,
[00:41:34] Unknown Host: diesel or gasoline to an oil rig.
[00:41:37] Unknown Host: Does that come right afterwards or is that such a different bottle of
[00:41:40] Unknown Host: oxygen or a G-tree point view that maybe it's like 10 years later?
[00:41:43] I think it's, you know, you're developing concurrently.
[00:41:45] Julia DeWahl: We are, we're talking with oil and gas already.
[00:41:48] Julia DeWahl: Just understanding them, right?
[00:41:49] Julia DeWahl: What do you need?
[00:41:49] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:41:50] Julia DeWahl: What do you think you'd pay, you know, that sort of thing?
[00:41:53] Julia DeWahl: So I would say it fast follows, right?
[00:41:55] Julia DeWahl: For a few years later.
[00:41:56] Julia DeWahl: I think it's going to be such a nice proving ground.
[00:41:59] Julia DeWahl: If we can make it through and test on a military base, for example,
[00:42:03] Julia DeWahl: and get a first reactor live and get some revenue from that,
[00:42:06] Julia DeWahl: then I think it's like, open the aperture pretty broadly.
[00:42:09] Julia DeWahl: Or what else is out there?
[00:42:10] Julia DeWahl: Does this movement towards re-enshoring
[00:42:15] Unknown Host: manufacturing in the US and various blockers people talk about to that
[00:42:20] Unknown Host: between supply chain is difficult in your, you've talked about in the fuel context,
[00:42:25] Unknown Host: but also supply chain for manufacturing, talent and the roles that people go into
[00:42:30] Unknown Host: in fighting talent and specific areas,
[00:42:31] Unknown Host: I'm just curious, what has your experience being of building a hard-tech company in the US?
[00:42:37] Unknown Host: Supply chain is, yeah, the bottlenecks.
[00:42:40] Julia DeWahl: Supply chain is challenging.
[00:42:42] Julia DeWahl: When you need to work with nuclear grade material and no nuclear plants have really been built,
[00:42:48] Julia DeWahl: it makes for a very limited number of suppliers,
[00:42:51] Julia DeWahl: which means cost or hire, you know, options are just fewer.
[00:42:54] Julia DeWahl: So like, if they're not responding to your email, like, well, what are you going to do?
[00:42:57] Julia DeWahl: It was only one other option and like, I don't know, they're busy or whatever.
[00:43:00] Julia DeWahl: So those dynamics are really challenging.
[00:43:02] Julia DeWahl: The graphite that I brought here is actually from a Japanese company.
[00:43:05] Julia DeWahl: No one's even processing that stuff in the US.
[00:43:09] Julia DeWahl: And so you're kind of, you're literally going all over the world for these suppliers.
[00:43:11] Julia DeWahl: So that's challenging.
[00:43:13] Julia DeWahl: You know, talent is challenging in the sense that there are so many options for hard-tech
[00:43:17] Julia DeWahl: in the LA region, right?
[00:43:20] Julia DeWahl: So you need to have a compelling mission, but nuclear is compelling.
[00:43:24] Julia DeWahl: So it's been challenging, but not in some ways.
[00:43:27] Julia DeWahl: Yes.
[00:43:28] Julia DeWahl: If you want to work at SpaceX and you love space stuff,
[00:43:30] Julia DeWahl: and you want to be at that name-brand place, we've lost you.
[00:43:34] Julia DeWahl: But if you're interested in nuclear and being able to build from the very beginning,
[00:43:38] Julia DeWahl: like, that's a compelling piece.
[00:43:40] Julia DeWahl: Yes, it's the Shackleton pitch, you know, of a high-risk failure.
[00:43:44] Unknown Host: Totally.
[00:43:44] Unknown Host: And that's the pitch that you're making.
[00:43:46] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:43:48] Unknown Host: Well, I like that.
[00:43:49] What trends in nuclear should we be excited about right now?
[00:43:51] Unknown Host: So the trend I'm excited about is bringing back online these recently shuttered plans,
[00:43:57] Julia DeWahl: because they don't take too much money to bring back online.
[00:44:00] Julia DeWahl: And we've seen a couple big power purchase agreements where you have Google partnered with
[00:44:06] Julia DeWahl: I think Nexdera, or the Iowa-based utility,
[00:44:10] Julia DeWahl: to bring on to a normal, which was shut down about five years ago.
[00:44:12] Julia DeWahl: And then you have actually three-mile island, the site of the infamous accident.
[00:44:17] Julia DeWahl: It's almost accident.
[00:44:19] Unknown Host: Well, it wasn't accident, but it was not really a big deal.
[00:44:22] Julia DeWahl: Yeah.
[00:44:22] Julia DeWahl: Like, the smudge radiation came out, it was like the amount of a test XA.
[00:44:26] Julia DeWahl: Yes, completely overbund.
[00:44:27] Julia DeWahl: Yeah.
[00:44:28] Julia DeWahl: Excellent.
[00:44:29] Julia DeWahl: That's being brought up back online,
[00:44:31] Julia DeWahl: partnership between Microsoft and Constellation, I believe.
[00:44:36] Julia DeWahl: So that's kind of fun.
[00:44:37] Julia DeWahl: I mean, you're seeing, like, let's go take these assets that are just sitting there that
[00:44:40] Julia DeWahl: shouldn't have been turned off.
[00:44:42] Julia DeWahl: Like, bring them back online, bring them back to life.
[00:44:43] Julia DeWahl: Tons of power coming out of them, and we need it yesterday, right?
[00:44:47] Julia DeWahl: Yeah, I mean, it's so striking the big trend in the US right now,
[00:44:50] Unknown Host: being that a grid demand was flat for the longest time.
[00:44:55] Unknown Host: Like, we were completely not.
[00:44:56] Unknown Host: Exactly.
[00:44:57] Unknown Host: And not adding power generation, nor adding power transmission.
[00:45:01] Unknown Host: And now, because of data centers, essentially, we have this enormous boom,
[00:45:06] Unknown Host: that is just leading to things that maybe previously would have been competitive.
[00:45:11] Unknown Host: People can't get enough of anything, right?
[00:45:13] Unknown Host: You know, people can't get enough of New Year.
[00:45:14] Unknown Host: They can't get enough of solar.
[00:45:15] Unknown Host: They can't get enough natural gas.
[00:45:17] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:45:18] Unknown Host: And just everything is backlogged.
[00:45:19] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:45:19] Unknown Host: It's really interesting.
[00:45:20] Unknown Host: Even the natural gas turbines are backlogged.
[00:45:22] Julia DeWahl: Totally.
[00:45:23] Julia DeWahl: Yeah.
[00:45:23] Julia DeWahl: I mean, most of the years.
[00:45:24] Julia DeWahl: Yeah.
[00:45:24] Julia DeWahl: So across all the manufacturers.
[00:45:26] Unknown Host: You know, it is hard when you see, when something like this goes into one of these
[00:45:29] Julia DeWahl: inflection points, into your point, like, it was less than 1% year of year growth for 20
[00:45:33] Julia DeWahl: plus years.
[00:45:34] Julia DeWahl: And now it's like people are like estimating 5% annual growth next year.
[00:45:38] Julia DeWahl: Totally.
[00:45:38] Julia DeWahl: Like, oh my gosh.
[00:45:39] Unknown Host: Last question.
[00:45:39] Unknown Host: What kind of culture do you want to build on, Antares?
[00:45:42] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:45:42] Unknown Host: Well, I think it's certainly one of excellence.
[00:45:46] Julia DeWahl: And I think that means, you know, delivering quality product.
[00:45:52] How you get there, I mean, there's a lot of ways to get there.
[00:45:54] Julia DeWahl: You can have the combative space sex culture.
[00:45:55] Julia DeWahl: You can have a less combative, maybe more, I don't know, writing culture.
[00:45:59] Julia DeWahl: They don't write that much stuff down in space sex.
[00:46:02] Julia DeWahl: To me, that matters less.
[00:46:04] Julia DeWahl: Although I tend to be one for a working environment that is
[00:46:09] energized, positive, preferably.
[00:46:13] Julia DeWahl: But I think ultimately, like, I would be proud to be delivering on an excellent product
[00:46:18] Julia DeWahl: that can be delivered to market soon, right?
[00:46:20] Julia DeWahl: And we can all go eat.
[00:46:21] Julia DeWahl: But, okay, so you want the results or into culture that's...
[00:46:25] Unknown Host: Results speak for themselves in a lot of ways, yeah.
[00:46:28] What do you want to do?
[00:46:28] Thank you.
[00:46:29] Unknown Host: Thanks.
[00:46:30] Julia DeWahl: Thanks for having me.
