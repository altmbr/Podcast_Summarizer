[00:00:00] You spend more on medical or indeed than Germany does.
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're at the nation state level.
[00:00:03] Dave Ricks: It'll be $14 billion this year.
[00:00:05] Dave Ricks: If you imagine this, like, you go to restaurants tonight
[00:00:08] Dave Ricks: and a bottle of like $100 an apple, Cabernet,
[00:00:10] Dave Ricks: is like $14,000.
[00:00:12] Dave Ricks: But then the waiter says, don't worry, that's not your coping.
[00:00:15] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:00:16] Dave Ricks: I have like at least one or two AIs running every minute
[00:00:20] Dave Ricks: of every meeting I'm in.
[00:00:21] Dave Ricks: And I just ask him at science questions.
[00:00:23] Dave Ricks: So which one do you use for science?
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_01: Either Claude or the XAI.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_02: How could you get the average caloric consumption per day
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_02: in America is?
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_02: 3600 calories.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:00:35] Yeah.
[00:00:35] Incredible.
[00:00:36] Dave Ricks: I'm the 11th CEO of the company.
[00:00:37] Dave Ricks: That's one less than a pulse.
[00:00:39] Dave Ricks: Is that period of time?
[00:00:43] Where did you learn to pour?
[00:00:45] I actually learned in Ireland.
[00:00:47] Dave Ricks: OK, do you want me to leave it down?
[00:00:48] Dave Ricks: You're the little expert here.
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_02: I'll just talk to you this way.
[00:00:52] That's an excellent pint.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_02: Dave Ricks is CEO of Eli Lele, which is now a $700 billion
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_02: dollar company and the world's most valuable farmer company.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_02: Eli Lele is 150 years old.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: They grew up as the first company to mass produce insulin
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_02: in the 20th century.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_02: But today, most of the company's business
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_02: is in the new GLP1 diabetes and weight loss drugs,
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_02: where they've become the market leader.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_02: Simultaneously, Eli Lele is upending the traditional model
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_02: by selling directly star consumers over the internet
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_02: with Lele direct, rather than through the traditional middle
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_02: men.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_02: Cheers.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_02: Cheers.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_02: We're coming.
[00:01:26] I'm very impressed that you came and you just poured your own pint.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_02: We're going to pint.
[00:01:29] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:01:30] Major Flex.
[00:01:30] We have glass we'll pour.
[00:01:31] Dave Ricks: Exactly.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_02: Well, actually, a good place to start.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_02: Tell us about your Nvidia announcement that you just had.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_02: So today at the what's it called GTC conference they have,
[00:01:40] Dave Ricks: they unveiled that we're well underway actually.
[00:01:43] Dave Ricks: Should be done by the end of the year, but building a super
[00:01:45] Dave Ricks: computer on our on-prem for us, really just around proprietary
[00:01:49] Dave Ricks: drug discovery models.
[00:01:51] We think it's the biggest.
[00:01:53] Dave Ricks: Biologically focused super computer there is.
[00:01:56] Dave Ricks: And certainly the biggest farm is done.
[00:01:58] Dave Ricks: Yes.
[00:01:59] Dave Ricks: With B300's latest chipset.
[00:02:01] Dave Ricks: And yeah, we're only constrained by power, like everyone else.
[00:02:05] Dave Ricks: But yeah, we built a bunch of tools.
[00:02:07] Dave Ricks: We'll run them on that.
[00:02:08] Dave Ricks: And scientists use it to sort of co-invent,
[00:02:12] Dave Ricks: co-develop, focus mostly on chemistry to begin with.
[00:02:14] Dave Ricks: But we'll expand from there.
[00:02:16] Dave Ricks: And so is the idea here?
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_01: You have some targets.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_01: You've had some challenges actually,
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_01: Drinking-ish.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: And so you give it to one of these new chemistry models.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_01: And you ask it whether it can come up with something totally
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_01: orthogonal beyond what?
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: Correct.
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_01: Human-medipred.
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_01: So take a really good popular example is like GOP1.
[00:02:37] Dave Ricks: So that's a hormone peptide that we all excrete.
[00:02:40] Dave Ricks: It engages targets that are what we call G-protein,
[00:02:44] Dave Ricks: coupled receptors.
[00:02:45] Dave Ricks: So they're hard to drug targets on the outside of cells.
[00:02:49] Dave Ricks: And to try to mimic a big huge protein
[00:02:52] Dave Ricks: with a very small chemical is a complicated undertaking.
[00:02:56] Dave Ricks: And by the way, do only that, and not other things
[00:02:59] Dave Ricks: that are untwored.
[00:03:00] Dave Ricks: And so this is sort of a frontier of drug discovery
[00:03:03] Dave Ricks: that's been tough and very empirical.
[00:03:05] Dave Ricks: That's a hot area for this kind of technology.
[00:03:08] Dave Ricks: Because these strange arrangements of atoms
[00:03:11] Dave Ricks: don't look like other drugs that have come before.
[00:03:14] Dave Ricks: But they do follow the principles of organic chemistry
[00:03:16] Dave Ricks: and seem to engage these targets effectively.
[00:03:19] Dave Ricks: I don't know of one that's come through the machine-driven
[00:03:22] Dave Ricks: discovery process, which is really a machine plus human
[00:03:25] Dave Ricks: that's made it to the clinic yet, but they're coming.
[00:03:27] Dave Ricks: And I think that's exciting.
[00:03:29] Dave Ricks: Because those have been structures that
[00:03:31] Dave Ricks: are they don't exist in nature.
[00:03:33] And yet the machines are alien, and they
[00:03:36] Dave Ricks: can predict these interactions.
[00:03:39] Dave Ricks: I'm always struck by Derek Lowe's arguments
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: where he's always sounding this note of caution, I guess,
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_01: about the optimism and maybe what he might view as boost
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_01: tourism around AI and biomedicine, where, as I see at least,
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_01: his two claims are, one, it's really hard
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: to select the targets.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_01: And AI doesn't help you that much there.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_01: And then so much fails at human toxicity.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: And again, at least so far, AI has not
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_01: been all that helpful at that step.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_01: Do you agree with him?
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: Or is he overrating these particular challenges
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: and maybe underrating the challenges that AI does help solve
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_01: or fought them that argument?
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: Probably we need to create the equivalent of what
[00:04:25] Dave Ricks: got created with human language, which
[00:04:26] Dave Ricks: is a more complete repository of biological knowledge
[00:04:30] Dave Ricks: to train against before the machines get a lot better.
[00:04:34] And today, I don't know, I would estimate we might
[00:04:37] Dave Ricks: know 10% to 15% of human biology.
[00:04:40] So the machine is not going to be good at all
[00:04:41] Dave Ricks: until we get way above 50%.
[00:04:45] That probably requires robotic 24.7 experiments
[00:04:49] Dave Ricks: just to create training data sets and this big lift effort.
[00:04:54] Dave Ricks: The kind of thing actually NIH should be doing right now,
[00:04:57] Dave Ricks: I would think.
[00:04:58] Dave Ricks: But that effort's not ongoing, at least in our country.
[00:05:01] But I think if that gets going, I think we'll know more.
[00:05:04] Dave Ricks: And the machines get better at the harder big problems,
[00:05:06] Dave Ricks: system prediction.
[00:05:08] Dave Ricks: Patrick and I did not just didn't finish any college.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_02: So not only don't have a formal training computer science,
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_02: but on a formal training and anything,
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_02: you did not come up through the science side of Lili Lilly.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_02: But you seem extremely comfortable with the science.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: But has been your method for ingesting all this stuff,
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_02: like especially as you're essentially making
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_02: science decisions at the end of the day
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: with the top level of a application decisions.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_02: Just how do you know that's right?
[00:05:34] Dave Ricks: I think we probably make three or four important decisions
[00:05:36] Dave Ricks: a year and they're all science.
[00:05:38] Dave Ricks: Stay curious.
[00:05:39] Dave Ricks: Read.
[00:05:40] Dave Ricks: Read what?
[00:05:41] Dave Ricks: Read a lot of medical journals.
[00:05:42] Dave Ricks: I go to conferences where Dave is presented.
[00:05:44] Dave Ricks: I spend time with our scientists.
[00:05:46] Dave Ricks: Stay curious.
[00:05:47] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:05:48] Dave Ricks: Now I have like at least one or two AIs running every minute
[00:05:52] Dave Ricks: of every meeting I'm in.
[00:05:53] Dave Ricks: And I'm just asking it, science questions.
[00:05:55] Dave Ricks: So you found for your learning,
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_02: Chachypti or whatever your,
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_02: I don't use that one for science.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_02: It's two variables.
[00:06:02] Dave Ricks: So which one do you use for science?
[00:06:03] Dave Ricks: I tend to use either Claude or the XAI one.
[00:06:10] Dave Ricks: I find it more terse and more,
[00:06:12] Dave Ricks: the references actually check out more often.
[00:06:14] Dave Ricks: Sometimes the AIs produce references
[00:06:16] Dave Ricks: and they're actually not the thing that it said.
[00:06:18] Dave Ricks: Yeah, yes, yes.
[00:06:19] Dave Ricks: And that takes too much work to go cross reference.
[00:06:21] Dave Ricks: So for an auto-died act, presumably the emergence
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_02: of Allen Lebens has been transformative for you.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_02: Well, I think for learning, that's a whole other topic
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_02: we could talk about.
[00:06:29] Dave Ricks: But you have to sort of question the pedagogical
[00:06:33] Dave Ricks: kind of method at a period.
[00:06:35] Dave Ricks: If you can just learn continuously.
[00:06:37] Dave Ricks: It's mastery learning for everyone.
[00:06:38] Dave Ricks: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:06:39] Dave Ricks: So you take advantage of that.
[00:06:39] Dave Ricks: But early in my career, I started in our business development
[00:06:42] Dave Ricks: M&A group and I spent my whole time
[00:06:43] Dave Ricks: as scientists looking at little companies and projects
[00:06:47] Dave Ricks: and other companies and trying to understand
[00:06:48] Dave Ricks: whether they were worth.
[00:06:50] Well, they didn't have to understand what they do.
[00:06:52] Dave Ricks: And I found that part of the industry.
[00:06:53] Dave Ricks: I didn't expect that when I came to Lily.
[00:06:56] I came to the company accidentally, by the way.
[00:06:58] Dave Ricks: But when I found that, I was like, wow, I love it.
[00:07:00] Dave Ricks: This is so interesting.
[00:07:02] Dave Ricks: And then I had a moment where one of the projects I worked on
[00:07:05] Dave Ricks: became a medicine in the US.
[00:07:07] Dave Ricks: And my mother was diagnosed with a condition
[00:07:09] Dave Ricks: and she got put on it.
[00:07:12] Dave Ricks: And so then that's the magic.
[00:07:13] Dave Ricks: It's like, OK, you can work on things that change people.
[00:07:16] Dave Ricks: But the people you care about, that's.
[00:07:18] Dave Ricks: You saw the full end impact.
[00:07:19] Dave Ricks: It's a big, exactly.
[00:07:21] Dave Ricks: From lab, so special.
[00:07:23] Dave Ricks: You've four big decisions a year that are kind of ground
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_02: in science.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_02: How quantitative versus qualitative to these end up
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_02: being, are you Rick Rubin?
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_02: Where it's all taste-based.
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_02: And you just like the feel of this direction.
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_02: Or you Billy Bean, where it's a money ball type, you know,
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_02: with our live pencils.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_02: And I think the system does a lot of the Billy Bean.
[00:07:42] Dave Ricks: I think that's a change at Lily that's made us more successful.
[00:07:46] Dave Ricks: I think we've actually put together a decision process.
[00:07:49] Dave Ricks: It's quite a bit more rigorous than it used to be.
[00:07:53] And that leads to fewer bad decisions.
[00:07:55] Dave Ricks: That's good.
[00:07:56] Dave Ricks: So that's sort of like the bumpers on the bowling alley
[00:07:59] Dave Ricks: that you put up.
[00:08:01] Dave Ricks: But then within that, whether it's a strike or a single pin,
[00:08:06] Dave Ricks: that's a little bit of the judgment and taste.
[00:08:09] Dave Ricks: And there, though, wisdom of crowds,
[00:08:10] Dave Ricks: I think we have a great leadership team.
[00:08:12] Dave Ricks: And we all come with equal voice and sort of debate.
[00:08:16] Dave Ricks: We actually have a rule to never decide in one meeting.
[00:08:18] Dave Ricks: So you're asking about the day.
[00:08:19] Dave Ricks: But we come back to it, think about what others said,
[00:08:22] Dave Ricks: and kind of push it again.
[00:08:24] Dave Ricks: And are you view deciding?
[00:08:26] Ultimately, yes.
[00:08:27] Dave Ricks: Nothing happens unless I say go.
[00:08:29] Dave Ricks: And if I don't like it, then definitely doesn't go.
[00:08:31] Dave Ricks: But people will often persuade me.
[00:08:34] Dave Ricks: And I definitely change my mind.
[00:08:35] Dave Ricks: And some of these are projects within the company.
[00:08:37] Dave Ricks: So what's the structure of the industry?
[00:08:39] Dave Ricks: We have huge expenditures on R&D.
[00:08:42] Dave Ricks: I think more than any other sector is a percent of revenue.
[00:08:44] Dave Ricks: We'll spend almost 25% of sales this year.
[00:08:47] Dave Ricks: I like to read.
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_02: I like to read, I'm putting as much as you spend more
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_02: on medical R&D than Germany does.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're at the nation state level.
[00:08:54] Dave Ricks: It'll be $14 billion this year.
[00:08:57] Dave Ricks: Total NIH, which is the biggest thing on Earth.
[00:09:00] Dave Ricks: It spends my name.
[00:09:01] Dave Ricks: It's 40.
[00:09:03] So that's up there.
[00:09:04] Dave Ricks: It's getting close.
[00:09:05] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:09:05] Dave Ricks: But some of those are projects we've been working on for a while.
[00:09:08] Dave Ricks: And now we have a data set.
[00:09:09] Dave Ricks: Now we need to make a decision to go to the final stage.
[00:09:11] Dave Ricks: The final stage of testing, the average drug cost, 3 1 1 2
[00:09:14] Dave Ricks: billion to make.
[00:09:15] Dave Ricks: More than 60% of that is the last step.
[00:09:18] Dave Ricks: So that call is the big one.
[00:09:20] Dave Ricks: The earlier ones of like go forward,
[00:09:22] Dave Ricks: OK, there are a lot of small things that add up.
[00:09:25] Dave Ricks: You can waste a lot of money if you do that poorly.
[00:09:26] Dave Ricks: But there's a portfolio.
[00:09:28] Dave Ricks: So that's unlikely.
[00:09:29] Dave Ricks: But usually we're carrying five to 10 projects
[00:09:33] Dave Ricks: in the latest phase.
[00:09:34] Dave Ricks: And those are the phase three trial.
[00:09:37] Dave Ricks: The phase three.
[00:09:37] Dave Ricks: Exactly.
[00:09:37] Dave Ricks: That's the question.
[00:09:38] Dave Ricks: Yeah, that's the question.
[00:09:39] Dave Ricks: What to test it in?
[00:09:40] Dave Ricks: How to test it?
[00:09:41] Dave Ricks: What's the design of that go, no go against that criteria?
[00:09:45] Dave Ricks: And that stage is going to be burning a billion plus a year.
[00:09:52] Dave Ricks: So it's a big investment per program.
[00:09:55] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:09:55] Dave Ricks: And of course, the returns on most drugs that make it
[00:09:59] Dave Ricks: through that are not positive.
[00:10:01] So it's not just can you get through that.
[00:10:03] Dave Ricks: But will you produce something useful enough
[00:10:05] Dave Ricks: to create excess value for society, but also the company,
[00:10:09] Dave Ricks: to keep the whole thing running?
[00:10:11] Dave Ricks: That's the exercise.
[00:10:11] Dave Ricks: OK, so at this point, the dynamics and the funding
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_01: of clinical trials determine so much of the portfolio
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_01: dynamics for you.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_01: I think anyone who comes across these clinical trial figures
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_01: and mechanics asks themselves why.
[00:10:27] Yes.
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: So I look at the numbers.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: So apparently, the median clinical trial
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_01: and roll-e it now costs $40,000.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_01: The median US wage is $60,000.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_01: So we're talking two thirds.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_01: Why and why couldn't it be a tenth or a hundred
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_01: of what it is?
[00:10:50] Yeah, brilliant question.
[00:10:52] Dave Ricks: And when we spend a lot of time working on,
[00:10:54] Dave Ricks: we've done a lot of things to improve the drug
[00:10:55] Dave Ricks: development process, or taking a systems approach.
[00:10:58] Dave Ricks: And I think one of the reasons Lily has probably the highest
[00:11:01] Dave Ricks: return on investment in R&D and the industry
[00:11:04] Dave Ricks: is because not the picking of winners and losers,
[00:11:08] Dave Ricks: but actually the process by which we run it.
[00:11:11] Dave Ricks: I think that's at least as valuable as what we've done.
[00:11:14] Dave Ricks: And we can come back to that if you want.
[00:11:16] Dave Ricks: But the piece we have really not moved
[00:11:17] is the enrollment of clinical trials.
[00:11:20] Dave Ricks: This is going to sound super arcane when I go through it
[00:11:23] Dave Ricks: and the cost, which is escalating about 7, 8%.
[00:11:27] That's over the last decade.
[00:11:29] Dave Ricks: That's about the same as the health care system.
[00:11:31] Dave Ricks: And that's not an accident.
[00:11:32] Dave Ricks: When people go, why does it try to cost so much?
[00:11:35] Dave Ricks: Well, we're taking the sickest slice
[00:11:38] Dave Ricks: of the health care system that are costing the most.
[00:11:41] Dave Ricks: And we're ingesting them, we're taking them
[00:11:43] Dave Ricks: out of the health care system and putting them
[00:11:44] Dave Ricks: in a clinical trial.
[00:11:46] Dave Ricks: Typically, we pay for all care.
[00:11:47] Dave Ricks: So we are literally running the health care system
[00:11:49] Dave Ricks: for those individuals.
[00:11:52] And that is in some ways for control
[00:11:57] Dave Ricks: because you want to have the best standard of care.
[00:11:58] Dave Ricks: So your experiment is properly conducted.
[00:12:01] Dave Ricks: And it's not just left to the whims of hundreds
[00:12:03] Dave Ricks: of individual doctors and people in Ireland versus the US
[00:12:06] Dave Ricks: getting different background therapies.
[00:12:08] Dave Ricks: So you standardize that.
[00:12:10] Dave Ricks: That costs money because you're sort of leveling up
[00:12:12] Dave Ricks: a lot of things.
[00:12:13] Dave Ricks: But then also, in some ways, you're
[00:12:17] Dave Ricks: paying a premium to both get the treating physicians
[00:12:22] Dave Ricks: and having a great care to get the patient.
[00:12:26] Dave Ricks: We don't offer them a new relation,
[00:12:27] Dave Ricks: but they get great care and inducement to be in the state.
[00:12:31] Because you're subjecting yourself quite often,
[00:12:33] Dave Ricks: not all the case, but to something other than the standard
[00:12:36] Dave Ricks: of care, either placebo or this, or in more specialized care
[00:12:40] Dave Ricks: often, it's standard care plus X.
[00:12:43] Dave Ricks: Where X could actually be doing harm, not good.
[00:12:45] Dave Ricks: So people have to go into that in a blinded way.
[00:12:48] And I guess the consideration is you'll get the best care.
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_01: Of the $40,000, how much of that should I look at
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_01: as inducement and encouragement for the patient?
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: And how much should I look at it as the cost of doing things
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_01: given the regulatory apparatus that exists?
[00:13:02] Dave Ricks: The patient part is like the level up part.
[00:13:04] Dave Ricks: And I would say 20%, 30% of the cost of studies,
[00:13:08] Dave Ricks: typically would be this.
[00:13:09] Dave Ricks: So you're buying the best standard of care.
[00:13:12] Dave Ricks: You're not getting something less.
[00:13:14] Dave Ricks: That's medicine costs.
[00:13:15] Dave Ricks: You're getting more testing.
[00:13:16] Dave Ricks: You're getting more visits.
[00:13:17] Dave Ricks: And then there is a premium that goes to institutions,
[00:13:21] not usually to the physician, the institution,
[00:13:23] Dave Ricks: to pay for the time of everybody involved in it,
[00:13:26] Dave Ricks: plus something.
[00:13:27] Dave Ricks: We read a lot about it in the NIH,
[00:13:29] Dave Ricks: cuts that the 60% Harvard markup or whatever.
[00:13:33] Dave Ricks: There's something like that in all clinical trials, too,
[00:13:35] Dave Ricks: overhead, coverage, whatnot.
[00:13:37] Dave Ricks: But it's paying for things that aren't in the trial.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_01: US health care is famously the most expensive in the world.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_01: Do you run trials outside the US?
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, actually most of the day.
[00:13:48] Dave Ricks: I mean, we wanted to actually do more in the US.
[00:13:50] Dave Ricks: This is a problem, I think, for our country.
[00:13:52] Like take cancer care where you think, OK,
[00:13:55] Dave Ricks: what's the one thing the US system is really good at?
[00:13:58] Dave Ricks: If I had cancer, I'd come to the US.
[00:13:59] Dave Ricks: That's definitely true.
[00:14:01] But only 4% of patients who have cancer in the US
[00:14:03] Dave Ricks: are in clinical trials.
[00:14:05] Dave Ricks: Whereas in Spain and Australia, it's over 25%.
[00:14:09] And some of that is because they've optimized the system
[00:14:12] Dave Ricks: so it's easier to run and then enroll,
[00:14:14] Dave Ricks: which I'd like to get to, people in the trials.
[00:14:17] Dave Ricks: But some of it is also that the background of care isn't as good.
[00:14:21] Dave Ricks: So that level up inducement is better for the patient
[00:14:25] Dave Ricks: and the physician.
[00:14:26] Dave Ricks: Here, the standard's pretty good.
[00:14:27] Dave Ricks: So people are like, yeah, do I want to do something
[00:14:29] Dave Ricks: where there's extra visits and travel time?
[00:14:32] There's another problem in the US, which
[00:14:34] Dave Ricks: is we have really good standards of care,
[00:14:36] Dave Ricks: but also quite different performing systems.
[00:14:39] Dave Ricks: And we often want to place our trials
[00:14:40] Dave Ricks: in the best performing systems that are famous, like MD Anderson
[00:14:44] Dave Ricks: or the Brigham.
[00:14:45] Dave Ricks: And those are the most congested with trials.
[00:14:48] Dave Ricks: And therefore, they're the slowest and most expensive.
[00:14:50] Dave Ricks: So there's a bit of a competition for place that goes on as well.
[00:14:54] Dave Ricks: But overall, I would say in our diabetes and cardiovascular
[00:14:58] Dave Ricks: trials, many, many more patients are in our trials
[00:15:01] Dave Ricks: outside the US than in.
[00:15:03] Dave Ricks: And that really shouldn't be other than cost of the system.
[00:15:07] And to some degree, the tuning of the system,
[00:15:09] Dave Ricks: like I mentioned, was Spain and Australia,
[00:15:11] Dave Ricks: toward doing more clinical trials.
[00:15:12] Dave Ricks: For instance, like here in the US, you have everywhere.
[00:15:15] Dave Ricks: You get ethics clearance, IRB.
[00:15:19] Dave Ricks: The US has a decentralized system.
[00:15:20] Dave Ricks: So you have to go to every system you're doing a study in.
[00:15:23] Dave Ricks: Some countries like Australia have a single system.
[00:15:26] Dave Ricks: So you just have one play, one stop,
[00:15:27] Dave Ricks: and then the whole country is available to recruit those types
[00:15:30] of things.
[00:15:31] Dave Ricks: You say you want to talk about enrollment?
[00:15:33] Dave Ricks: Yeah, it's fascinating.
[00:15:34] Dave Ricks: So drug development time in the industry
[00:15:36] Dave Ricks: is about 10 years in the clinical, little less right now.
[00:15:40] Dave Ricks: We're running a little less than 7 at Lilly.
[00:15:42] Dave Ricks: So that's the optimization I spoke about.
[00:15:44] Dave Ricks: But actually, half of that 7 is, we have a protocol open.
[00:15:48] Dave Ricks: That means it's an experiment we want to run.
[00:15:51] Dave Ricks: We have sites trained.
[00:15:52] Dave Ricks: They're waiting for patients to walk in their door
[00:15:54] Dave Ricks: and to propose, would you like to be in the study?
[00:15:56] Dave Ricks: But we don't have enough people in the study.
[00:15:58] So you're in the serial process, diffuse serial process,
[00:16:02] Dave Ricks: waiting for people to show up.
[00:16:03] Dave Ricks: And you think, wow, that seems like we could do better than that.
[00:16:07] Dave Ricks: If Taylor Swift can sell out a concert in a few seconds,
[00:16:10] Dave Ricks: why can't I fill an Alzheimer's study?
[00:16:11] Dave Ricks: There seem to be lots of patients.
[00:16:13] Dave Ricks: But that's health care.
[00:16:16] Dave Ricks: It's very tough.
[00:16:17] Dave Ricks: We've done some interesting things recently
[00:16:19] Dave Ricks: to work around that.
[00:16:20] Dave Ricks: One thing that's an idea that partially works now
[00:16:24] Dave Ricks: is calling existing databases and contacting patients.
[00:16:27] Dave Ricks: Practically.
[00:16:28] Dave Ricks: Right.
[00:16:29] Dave Ricks: Where you have their lab values from a,
[00:16:31] Dave Ricks: where before there wasn't a treatment,
[00:16:32] Dave Ricks: now there is one being studied, would you like to be part of it?
[00:16:34] Dave Ricks: That's something we're doing now with our LP,
[00:16:36] Dave Ricks: little A program.
[00:16:37] Dave Ricks: That's a cholesterol subtype where there was nothing
[00:16:40] Dave Ricks: to do about it.
[00:16:41] Dave Ricks: A lot of people have had it tested and it's high.
[00:16:43] Dave Ricks: You could say, hey, you're high.
[00:16:44] Dave Ricks: Would you like to do something now?
[00:16:45] Dave Ricks: But it's still a lot to be done there.
[00:16:47] Dave Ricks: And the data is sitting in electronic health records
[00:16:50] Dave Ricks: in our country is very poorly organized.
[00:16:52] Dave Ricks: So it would be good to optimize that.
[00:16:55] Dave Ricks: I think the other is actually, just go directly to the patients.
[00:16:58] So who has the most interest?
[00:16:59] Dave Ricks: It's usually the patient.
[00:17:00] Dave Ricks: And that physicians and their institution
[00:17:02] Dave Ricks: may not be in the trial or they might
[00:17:04] Dave Ricks: have be interested in spending much time on this.
[00:17:06] Dave Ricks: But that's kind of what I want.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: I want to get an email, as you say,
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_01: the system knows my health data and what conditions
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: I have and so forth.
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_01: And be told that a package will be arriving tomorrow
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: with a drug.
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_01: I can take the drug if I want to participate in this trial.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_01: You can include whatever disloyal.
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_01: And some nice person will come every month or whatever.
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_01: Or just telephonically to take my vitals, exactly.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_01: Measure my blood pressure and what I have you.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_01: Are all these intermediaries and the systems
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_01: and the hospitals and so forth?
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_01: Are they required in transically for the kind of trials
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_01: you want to run?
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_01: Obviously, very little bit of the condition.
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_01: The drug?
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_01: Depends on the disease.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, right.
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_01: Well, I guess so.
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_01: So how much of it is there, in fact,
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: intrinsically required, given the characteristics
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_01: of the condition, and how much is it?
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_01: This is how things are done.
[00:17:54] Yeah, well, you described as actually a great vision
[00:17:56] Dave Ricks: for what we want to go.
[00:17:56] Dave Ricks: We've executed one of these at scale, which is fully enrolled,
[00:18:00] Dave Ricks: which was our Alzheimer's prevention study.
[00:18:03] It's a more complicated medicine.
[00:18:04] Dave Ricks: It's an infused medicine.
[00:18:06] Dave Ricks: But we ran this with one investigator in the United States.
[00:18:09] Dave Ricks: And we screened over 80,000 people.
[00:18:12] Dave Ricks: By the way, it's the fastest accrued Alzheimer's study
[00:18:14] Dave Ricks: in history, even though it's pre-altymers.
[00:18:17] Dave Ricks: It's people with the amyloid precursor protein,
[00:18:20] Dave Ricks: but not dementia.
[00:18:21] Dave Ricks: It's fully enrolled.
[00:18:22] Dave Ricks: We're now, we've treated people.
[00:18:23] Dave Ricks: Actually, no one's left on treatment.
[00:18:25] Dave Ricks: We're just watching them now.
[00:18:26] Dave Ricks: There's a treatment set nine month course
[00:18:27] Dave Ricks: to deplete amyloid and see if that can prevent the symptoms.
[00:18:31] Dave Ricks: So that was a very successful trial, just what you said.
[00:18:33] Dave Ricks: They got instructions to be in the study.
[00:18:36] Dave Ricks: There was a televisit.
[00:18:37] Dave Ricks: They got some diagnostic tests, blood-based that went in
[00:18:41] Dave Ricks: and said, OK, this is the indicator you might have high
[00:18:44] Dave Ricks: amyloid, then you can go to get a PET scan.
[00:18:46] Dave Ricks: And if that was positive, you could be enrolled in the study.
[00:18:49] Pretty successful.
[00:18:49] So we'd like to replicate that.
[00:18:51] Dave Ricks: I think one very interesting thing in the future of medicine
[00:18:54] Dave Ricks: is that I think we will have a lot more preventative medicines
[00:18:58] Dave Ricks: in the future.
[00:18:59] Dave Ricks: And I think this type of study in particular
[00:19:01] Dave Ricks: is well suited to prevention, because you have sort of the people
[00:19:06] Dave Ricks: who are worried about their wellness, so they're motivated.
[00:19:09] Dave Ricks: They have means.
[00:19:09] Dave Ricks: They're in the middle of their life.
[00:19:11] Dave Ricks: They're working.
[00:19:12] Dave Ricks: They don't have complications of comorbidities and so forth.
[00:19:14] Dave Ricks: They want to be in the study.
[00:19:16] Dave Ricks: And I think they would like to prevent terrible conditions
[00:19:19] Dave Ricks: like Alzheimer's.
[00:19:19] Dave Ricks: So that's an exciting new chapter we can push.
[00:19:23] Dave Ricks: So Paul Janssen.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_01: So explain who Paul Janssen is.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: Come on.
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_01: Paul Janssen, as I understand it,
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_01: was behind the discovery invention,
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_01: what have you, of more medications than any other single?
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_01: I think a Belgian guy.
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: I think it's invented a number of.
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_01: 79 or 80.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_01: The MVP of medicine.
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_01: Michael Jordan, beyond invention.
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_01: OK, so amazing guy.
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_01: When some outsider comes to the clinical trial process
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_01: and system and just the development pipeline overall,
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_01: maybe they naively think, wow, this seems so torturous,
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_01: so expensive, so bureaucratic.
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_01: What have you?
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_01: Well, that's how it's going to be.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_01: Well, that's how it's going to be.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_01: Or if they can be otherwise, you might
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_01: think they're going to naive.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_01: There's a video interview with Janssen from the 90s.
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_01: It's from quite a while ago.
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_01: I mean, he's dead now.
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_01: Where he's recounting the history of his career.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_01: He started the company in 1953.
[00:20:19] Today, I think it might be understandable,
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_00: but it might be understandable.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: He wants to build a financial implications,
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_00: or else he wants to build a big, big, rare,
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_00: I can answer that question.
[00:20:34] The question is that the time that is running is the time of the new generation.
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_00: And it will be the same as the order of the year 2012.
[00:20:47] That time was one or two years.
[00:20:50] The second time costs more than half a year.
[00:20:56] People are talking about the same billion-year-old brand new generation.
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_00: That is still true.
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_00: But that is for me, for my age, for the growth of the product.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_00: And the huge demand that was required to be approved.
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_00: That was put through the authority of the company.
[00:21:17] That has a lot to do with development and not with research.
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_00: So you think that you can also do that in the future?
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_00: Of course, of course.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_01: We could go back to doing it the way we used to.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_01: And it's a societal choice to make it so bureaucratic.
[00:21:34] Dave Ricks: I guess it's an explicit and implicit one.
[00:21:37] Dave Ricks: The explicit part is through time there have been accidents.
[00:21:42] Dave Ricks: And nothing is perfect.
[00:21:43] Dave Ricks: We probably have 2,000 man-made approved medicines versus natural products or vitamins or other things.
[00:21:50] Dave Ricks: And maybe 400 unique mechanisms.
[00:21:53] So there's clustering.
[00:21:56] Within those, there have been problems.
[00:21:58] Dave Ricks: And there's also been problems that turned out not to be problems.
[00:22:01] Dave Ricks: And so our detection and ability is flawed.
[00:22:04] Dave Ricks: Because of that, I think each time that occurs,
[00:22:07] Dave Ricks: there was intervention in the system, which is sort of a global consensus.
[00:22:11] Dave Ricks: But mostly the developed economies kind of harmonize their systems either directly or indirectly.
[00:22:16] Dave Ricks: To say, oh, no, let's require more information or rebalance the robustness.
[00:22:21] Dave Ricks: No, absolutely, yes.
[00:22:22] Dave Ricks: We've had this ratchet.
[00:22:23] Dave Ricks: Have we gone too far?
[00:22:24] Dave Ricks: I think that it's a function of what the technology is at the moment.
[00:22:27] Dave Ricks: And I think in past times, yes, you can take the 2,000 odds in the US,
[00:22:33] Dave Ricks: where there were two big controversial drug approvals that were later retracted.
[00:22:39] Dave Ricks: The Biox situation with Merck and then a vastum from GSK.
[00:22:44] Dave Ricks: These were both drugs that were for different uses, pain and diabetes.
[00:22:48] Dave Ricks: But through a detection requirement that the agencies, because now we have electronic records,
[00:22:53] Dave Ricks: we can look at things, picked up what they thought was a trace of risk for both cardiovascular risks,
[00:22:59] Dave Ricks: and intervened with labeling and escalation until finally both companies actually removed the products from the market,
[00:23:05] Dave Ricks: with stood billions of dollars in product liability suits,
[00:23:09] Dave Ricks: only to find later under a different analysis that there was nothing to be seen there, both of them.
[00:23:15] Dave Ricks: And I think that's, there's like an ascertainment bias problem with these studies.
[00:23:20] Dave Ricks: There's also who is looking at this data.
[00:23:23] Dave Ricks: But that caused a 10-year chill in drug development, and the Avandee one, we know well,
[00:23:29] Dave Ricks: we work in diabetes, actually caused a policy change.
[00:23:31] Dave Ricks: And the policy change was, you must rule out cardiovascular risk prior to market entry.
[00:23:37] Dave Ricks: And as you may know, some conditions like diabetes have a more continuous variable you're measuring,
[00:23:42] Dave Ricks: and so studies can be short and cheaper glucose levels.
[00:23:46] Dave Ricks: Other studies like cardiovascular event studies are not a continuous variable, it's a binary variable,
[00:23:51] Dave Ricks: and you have to wait for natural history to occur to pile up in a variable to have a statistical difference.
[00:23:57] Dave Ricks: Those are four to five-year undertakings.
[00:24:00] Dave Ricks: So there, you just bought four or five years of extra time before you could get any new diabetes medication.
[00:24:05] Dave Ricks: We got better at doing them, but that was expensive.
[00:24:08] Dave Ricks: Now, has that rate, that's the explicit.
[00:24:10] Dave Ricks: The implicit is the regulatory problem.
[00:24:12] Dave Ricks: There must be a name for this problem, some smart person's given it, but regulatorys are added but never taken away.
[00:24:17] Dave Ricks: So the regulation is still there.
[00:24:20] Dave Ricks: Now by happy accident, we are all now really pleased with like, anchor tins like our terzoepetide to run them
[00:24:26] Dave Ricks: because they frequently demonstrate massive benefit on cardiovascular.
[00:24:30] Dave Ricks: And in some ways, it creates a barrier to entry for the next low cost Chinese program, whatever,
[00:24:36] Dave Ricks: because it's this big expensive thing.
[00:24:38] Dave Ricks: I have with many regulatory structures.
[00:24:40] Dave Ricks: Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:41] Dave Ricks: So is it right? No.
[00:24:43] Dave Ricks: We're imperfect as people, and certainly as decision makers at a collective level.
[00:24:47] Dave Ricks: I would also say that technology for seeing early signals has changed and improved,
[00:24:54] Dave Ricks: including computer technology, and it's probably worth a reassessment.
[00:24:59] Dave Ricks: Thanks for prevention, you were going to ask.
[00:25:01] Dave Ricks: Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_02: And because, say with GLPs in the weight loss context, they economically pay off over a very long time horizon,
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_02: but if you're looking at a short time horizon of an employer or an employer, they don't necessarily.
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_02: And so that's great.
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_02: This challenge for reimbursement, where not as many people reimburse GLPs for weight loss as you think would be rational.
[00:25:26] That just will always be the case with prevention.
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_02: And so how do you actually develop drugs that are commercializable and reimbursable?
[00:25:34] Yeah, well in the obesity case, I'll take a little bit of issue with your first assertion and then add two other problems.
[00:25:40] Dave Ricks: The data actually is becoming more clear within actually a two-year time frame.
[00:25:44] Dave Ricks: And I hope it's stripey, reimbursement, medicines for your patients or for your employees.
[00:25:48] Dave Ricks: With a two-year, you can break even based on total medical costs.
[00:25:52] Dave Ricks: So this is group of ICERB, which is funded by someone who hates our industry and the insurance companies.
[00:25:57] Dave Ricks: And they analyze all new drugs and usually seeking to prove that they're not worth it.
[00:26:01] Dave Ricks: That's sort of their mission.
[00:26:02] Dave Ricks: Like they just analyzed our medicine, Chorzebotide and Semilutide.
[00:26:06] Dave Ricks: And they said actually they're both cost effective at current pricing.
[00:26:09] Dave Ricks: In fact, Zapound, or Chorzebotide was the threshold they have is to save $100,000 per person per year in downstream health costs.
[00:26:18] Dave Ricks: And it was twice as effective as that at the current pricing.
[00:26:21] Dave Ricks: And the current pricing isn't going to stay, let's be honest.
[00:26:24] Dave Ricks: There'll be more competition.
[00:26:25] Dave Ricks: The government wants to lower our prices.
[00:26:27] Dave Ricks: So I think we're in a good place there.
[00:26:30] Dave Ricks: Now, the two other problems are there's sort of this in-commency problem in healthcare, like many things, but particularly in healthcare, where the last thing in is scrutinize the most.
[00:26:41] Dave Ricks: And the base stack of services and products we use is never revisited.
[00:26:46] Dave Ricks: It becomes standard of care.
[00:26:48] Dave Ricks: But displacing that in most therapeutic spaces and in the healthcare system in general is extremely difficult.
[00:26:53] Dave Ricks: I think we suffer from that here.
[00:26:55] Dave Ricks: If the first medicine we had to treat metabolic conditions was Chorzebotide in 1972.
[00:27:01] Dave Ricks: I have no doubt it would be reimbursed everywhere and broadly used in the system.
[00:27:05] Dave Ricks: But I get the ratcheting effect.
[00:27:07] Dave Ricks: The thing you're just stacking on top of it and it's difficult to remove benefits.
[00:27:11] Dave Ricks: It's easy to deny new ones.
[00:27:13] Dave Ricks: And that's true in government-funded systems, but also at big-end insurers.
[00:27:17] Dave Ricks: I think the other thing that's going on with this one and why we're spending so much energy exploring real indications for comorbid diseases that go with obesity, which is so far pretty successful, is that the idea of just treating someone who's overweight or obese, without any other illness, to many people, I think, exposes a bias we have about that particular condition.
[00:27:41] Dave Ricks: That if it wasn't something you could see, you might not have.
[00:27:45] Dave Ricks: But I think we are conditioned to think of someone who's overweight as someone who is not disciplined.
[00:27:50] Dave Ricks: The data does not show that, actually.
[00:27:52] Dave Ricks: Like our ancestors roaming the plains or whatever the tundra of Ireland, walking across the ice bridge from Norway, were in a background of starvation.
[00:28:04] Dave Ricks: And there are very few humans on earth that have a genetic background that has any limit on food consumption.
[00:28:11] It's irrational. It's a wasted piece of code. It did no good.
[00:28:15] Now today in today's environment we're in the flip, the complete flip, especially in the US, where food everywhere we walk, came across your staff.
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_02: How could you get the average caloric consumption per day in America is?
[00:28:29] 3600 calories.
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_02: That incredible.
[00:28:33] Dave Ricks: Here's an interesting set. When you're on our medicine, how many fewer calories do you consume on average?
[00:28:39] Dave Ricks: On with the GOP ones.
[00:28:41] You don't need to swing at that much to cause many full-quality calories a day.
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_01: It's 800?
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_01: Which is almost a meal.
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_01: If you go and pull up to In-N-Out Burger.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_01: That's second breakfast right there.
[00:28:51] Dave Ricks: Yeah, second breakfast.
[00:28:52] Dave Ricks: Exactly. So that's why people lose weight so successfully.
[00:28:54] Dave Ricks: The wonder all the food companies are so worried.
[00:28:56] Dave Ricks: And the trick is people lose the weight and they don't feel miserable.
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_02: Right? So here's the thing about being obese is people, when you start to gain a little bit of weight, your set point sort of readjusts.
[00:29:07] Dave Ricks: This is the missing code we have.
[00:29:09] Dave Ricks: And there's only one direction which is up as better.
[00:29:13] Dave Ricks: And the more up you have, actually the more hunger it creates.
[00:29:17] Dave Ricks: Hyper-insulinemia, which is a hunger-stimulating hormone.
[00:29:19] Dave Ricks: And it sort of starts to overwhelm the counter-regulatory system, which is, geopincratins.
[00:29:24] Dave Ricks: Geop1, GIP, the ones we are making medicines around.
[00:29:27] Dave Ricks: And you're out of balance.
[00:29:29] Dave Ricks: And there's no going back.
[00:29:31] Dave Ricks: And interestingly, even when people lose weight, that balance still seems to be off.
[00:29:36] Dave Ricks: Which is why if you've ever gone on a crashed diet, you feel like shit constantly.
[00:29:42] Dave Ricks: You want to hurt people.
[00:29:43] Dave Ricks: You want to be angry.
[00:29:45] And on these medicines, that doesn't happen.
[00:29:47] Dave Ricks: Which is the miracle of it.
[00:29:49] Dave Ricks: People feel good and lose weight.
[00:29:51] Dave Ricks: If you've a medicine that is recurring, and it presents an income stream for E-Light-Ely.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_01: Now, maybe nothing is truly recurring in the sense that all patent protection ends.
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_01: But nonetheless, there's something along, going on, going on, going on, going on, going on.
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_01: And I guess there are various ways to extend that.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_01: Then some genetic medicine comes along.
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_01: It's one time.
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, one in done.
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_01: And practice possible to charge enough upfront, such that as a company looking at its portfolio.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_01: He's back there and there.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you are in fact neutral as to which it is.
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_01: Because from first principle, it's for the patient.
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_01: It's way better to do that.
[00:30:28] Dave Ricks: I think you asked about a value-prope, value-perception problem.
[00:30:31] Dave Ricks: And I think we need to overcome that.
[00:30:33] Dave Ricks: We're doing that by studying.
[00:30:34] Dave Ricks: And all these other conditions, people recognize those conditions.
[00:30:36] Dave Ricks: And then we'll ensure.
[00:30:37] Dave Ricks: And because OBC is sort of this master switched all these things, that's an achievable thing.
[00:30:41] Dave Ricks: It just costs a lot of R&D.
[00:30:43] Dave Ricks: I'm talking about Perception.
[00:30:44] Dave Ricks: I think he's talking about reality.
[00:30:45] Dave Ricks: Yeah, you're talking about actually pricing.
[00:30:46] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:30:47] Dave Ricks: Which is, why is it that the industry is evolved to have a unit pricing model?
[00:30:51] Dave Ricks: It would be, it's back to like a shrink wrap software world, right?
[00:30:54] Dave Ricks: Where you're basically just shipping a box.
[00:30:56] Dave Ricks: And all your value has to be captured upon that invoice.
[00:30:59] Dave Ricks: Right.
[00:31:00] Dave Ricks: That is how we price our money.
[00:31:01] Dave Ricks: You're currently, you know, in the SaaS model.
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, tech people know that SaaS is way better than the shrink wrap software business models.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_01: And genetic medicines are shrink wrap software.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_01: So it wouldn't be crazy to go back even though it's better for the patient.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:15] Dave Ricks: So I think, so we have some genetic medicines coming.
[00:31:18] Dave Ricks: And we're thinking actively about this.
[00:31:19] Dave Ricks: For instance, we have a medicine development that will knock down your LDL, if it's safe enough,
[00:31:24] Dave Ricks: within a one undone PCSK9 edit in your liver.
[00:31:28] Dave Ricks: And presumably that will last the rest of your life.
[00:31:30] Dave Ricks: And your LDLs will be between 20 and 40 forever.
[00:31:33] Dave Ricks: It looks like an amazing drug.
[00:31:34] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:31:35] Dave Ricks: If it's, of course, there's problems with these delivery systems.
[00:31:37] Dave Ricks: We have to rule out safety.
[00:31:38] Dave Ricks: But let's just say it works.
[00:31:39] Dave Ricks: How would one price that?
[00:31:40] Dave Ricks: Because you're displacing a medicine that costs $808,000, $9,000 per year.
[00:31:45] Dave Ricks: Right.
[00:31:46] We need to innovate that pricing model.
[00:31:48] Dave Ricks: Why haven't we?
[00:31:49] Dave Ricks: It's mostly because the consumption side has no capability to do this.
[00:31:54] Dave Ricks: Particularly governments have built all back to the regulatory and currency problem.
[00:31:59] Dave Ricks: Built all this stack of rules around the idea that I buy one unit, I pay X.
[00:32:05] Dave Ricks: Whereas here you buy one unit and we want money over time.
[00:32:09] Dave Ricks: What is that?
[00:32:10] Dave Ricks: But it's conceivable that one could create like a licensing concept, stealing from the SaaS model,
[00:32:15] Dave Ricks: where you say, we'll do the procedure for free.
[00:32:17] Dave Ricks: And as long as it's working for you, you will deposit X amount in our bank account.
[00:32:23] Dave Ricks: And you're getting the value and we're getting paid for our research.
[00:32:26] Dave Ricks: If it doesn't work, so that invokes a warranty as well.
[00:32:30] Dave Ricks: That's an interesting idea.
[00:32:32] Dave Ricks: And one we're thinking about for these more common, because so far, Gene Therapy is mostly for uncommon things,
[00:32:38] Dave Ricks: where they've just charged it and someone's paid.
[00:32:41] Dave Ricks: But for common Gene Therapy to be really be unlocked, this has to be solved.
[00:32:45] It strikes me that we're discussing how people's lives are affected by all these treatments
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_02: and what pharma companies can produce, which are themselves downstream of what pharma companies can afford to invest in,
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_02: which, for the grace of God, we, the patent time horizon is an arbitrary number that we have ended up with.
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_02: I sometimes think about off-label use is very valuable in the US system.
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_02: You can imagine another universe where we hadn't ended up with off-label use being permissible and things like this.
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_02: Do you think we need to spend more time trying to discuss and meta-edit the R&D system?
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_02: And the R&D system and incentive system that we have, because it just has such a huge effect on people's quality of life.
[00:33:36] Dave Ricks: Well, yeah, thanks for the question.
[00:33:38] Dave Ricks: I love to talk about this.
[00:33:39] Dave Ricks: So I think a lot about this, and I think if your point of view is that we want more new medicines,
[00:33:46] Dave Ricks: like that would be a better outcome for the world.
[00:33:48] Dave Ricks: I'm proud of my world.
[00:33:49] Dave Ricks: Yeah, and I am too.
[00:33:50] Dave Ricks: Then I think there's definitely many flaws with the current system.
[00:33:53] Dave Ricks: And strangely, most of the discussions I have about this are actually we have, they don't say it out loud, but there's enough new medicine.
[00:34:02] And what we really have a problem is affording it.
[00:34:05] Dave Ricks: Now, interesting fact, in the US, the most expensive healthcare system world, we spend $0.10 on the dollar on medicine.
[00:34:11] Dave Ricks: The other 90 cents go through everything else that medicine is trying to prevent.
[00:34:15] Go back to 1969.
[00:34:17] Dave Ricks: I think it's even less than 10 cents.
[00:34:18] Dave Ricks: Brand of medicines are 8.
[00:34:19] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:34:20] Dave Ricks: 2% is generics, which is 90% of the volume.
[00:34:22] Dave Ricks: That's an even better deal.
[00:34:23] Dave Ricks: We have to get to generics.
[00:34:24] Dave Ricks: Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:25] Dave Ricks: But go back to 1965, Medicare, Medicaid were invented.
[00:34:28] Dave Ricks: We've gained, I believe, eight life years of life expectancy since then.
[00:34:32] Dave Ricks: And most studies would say five or six of those are due to medicine.
[00:34:35] Dave Ricks: Yet, think of the cumulative expenditures by taxpayers since that time.
[00:34:40] Dave Ricks: It's not even close.
[00:34:41] Dave Ricks: We should be saying, who can we give money to to do more research?
[00:34:45] Dave Ricks: Because this is clearly a better way to get through life.
[00:34:48] Dave Ricks: The direct way is the NIH, we could talk about that if you want.
[00:34:52] Dave Ricks: That is limitations because it's institutional government.
[00:34:54] Dave Ricks: But the private market sell funds, either through capital markets or through our R&D line.
[00:34:59] Dave Ricks: And there would be a lot more funding if we had an idea of price stability or a longer return period.
[00:35:06] Dave Ricks: That is definitely true.
[00:35:08] The patent system is what it is because of former rules.
[00:35:13] Moving it out in time seems exceedingly difficult in this climate.
[00:35:17] Dave Ricks: But actually, it's shrunk because of the longer approval time.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_02: It's de facto shrunk.
[00:35:23] Dave Ricks: And then actually the Biden administration passed a rule in the inflation reduction act
[00:35:28] Dave Ricks: to actually have government price intervention in the US at five years plus two.
[00:35:33] Dave Ricks: So it makes me around seven years.
[00:35:35] Dave Ricks: You lose that ability to recoup investment in the same way.
[00:35:38] Dave Ricks: Government price intervention always works out well.
[00:35:41] Dave Ricks: Yeah, right. It doesn't produce surpluses.
[00:35:44] Dave Ricks: Let's put it that way. You don't get more medicines that way.
[00:35:47] Dave Ricks: So it's actually, it is collapsing.
[00:35:49] Dave Ricks: I think it investors mine.
[00:35:50] Dave Ricks: And you can see that in the capital markets.
[00:35:52] Dave Ricks: If you look at the large cap farmers, not Lily.
[00:35:55] Dave Ricks: But the other ones, the multiple is the most compressed it's been in 20 years.
[00:35:59] Dave Ricks: If you look at biotech, the XBI, I think half of the XBI is trading below cash.
[00:36:05] And then if you look at the cause of this.
[00:36:08] Dave Ricks: The venture half of the rounds last year were down rounds.
[00:36:11] Dave Ricks: This is not a positive one.
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_01: What extending the patent duration actually worked because you referenced earlier this dynamic where
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_01: there are especially with biologics.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_01: There are now so many opportunities for copycat molecules and therapeutics and so forth.
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_01: And so like, does it matter less what happens with patent windows?
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_01: Because what actually matters is the competitive ecosystem the ability for fast follow.
[00:36:34] Yeah, I think we end up with two competitive ecosystems.
[00:36:37] Dave Ricks: You have the on patent one.
[00:36:39] Dave Ricks: And here I think history, which show actually within a 10 year period,
[00:36:42] Dave Ricks: which is typical recruitment time.
[00:36:44] Dave Ricks: We've solved clinical trials, you know, separately.
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_01: So there's no practice.
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so that's a way to get that right as we could simplify the regulatory framework
[00:36:50] Dave Ricks: and have longer return periods and increase returns to investors and get more investment.
[00:36:54] Dave Ricks: That's actually a real idea.
[00:36:56] Dave Ricks: But typically in classes by sort of the horse race and accidents along the way,
[00:37:02] Dave Ricks: it's pretty uncommon you end up with one medicine.
[00:37:04] Dave Ricks: Often you'll get many.
[00:37:06] Dave Ricks: We can talk about GOP once for a minute.
[00:37:07] Dave Ricks: We only have two right now.
[00:37:08] Dave Ricks: But there's probably 80 inclinical pipelines right now globally.
[00:37:12] Dave Ricks: We have 11 others.
[00:37:13] Dave Ricks: But there's probably 70 others not coming from Lily.
[00:37:17] Dave Ricks: So there will be tons of competition.
[00:37:19] Dave Ricks: But the history shows that back to this medicine and competency,
[00:37:23] Dave Ricks: once two or three sort of get in the works of things,
[00:37:26] Dave Ricks: unless you're kind of different.
[00:37:28] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:37:29] Dave Ricks: Nobody really uses it.
[00:37:30] Dave Ricks: And pricing strategies have not worked.
[00:37:33] Now, they don't work until there's actually a biosimilar generic event.
[00:37:37] Dave Ricks: Because here, it's not a, hey, I'm $100 in your 90.
[00:37:42] Typically, a generic event, you'll lose 97% of your pricing.
[00:37:46] Dave Ricks: The day your patent expires.
[00:37:48] So this is a fantastic deal for society.
[00:37:51] But a terrible situation for an inventor.
[00:37:54] Dave Ricks: And if you came along late hoping to induce competition,
[00:37:57] Dave Ricks: maybe even were half off the originator.
[00:38:00] Dave Ricks: Now your half off is 90% lower.
[00:38:04] Dave Ricks: There's no return now.
[00:38:06] Dave Ricks: In order to simulate and to catalyze more R&D,
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_01: one thing we could do is we could extend the 20-year window.
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_01: What else can we do?
[00:38:17] Dave Ricks: Either you can get it quicker in the market or extend the market.
[00:38:20] Dave Ricks: I think pricing for value is a good idea to consider.
[00:38:23] Dave Ricks: So today, particularly in the United States,
[00:38:26] Dave Ricks: and in many XUS markets, I would point out a few of the commonwealth markets are different.
[00:38:31] Dave Ricks: They've tried to implement it a price for value scheme.
[00:38:33] Dave Ricks: Because they're single pair?
[00:38:34] Dave Ricks: Well, most are single pair outside the US.
[00:38:36] Dave Ricks: But because they chose that path instead of a negotiated outcome or something.
[00:38:40] Dave Ricks: But the US, we have a multiplayer model.
[00:38:42] Dave Ricks: But it's devolved to this situation where actually it's a very commercial kind of thing.
[00:38:47] Dave Ricks: Where there's a price point, a manufacturer launches that,
[00:38:50] Dave Ricks: really nobody pays that price.
[00:38:53] There are then many, many price points below that.
[00:38:56] Dave Ricks: The lowest is defined by law.
[00:38:58] Dave Ricks: It's Medicaid, actually the law is called Medicaid Best Price.
[00:39:00] Dave Ricks: So state Medicaid, they spend 5% of their dollar,
[00:39:03] Dave Ricks: 5% a nickel on medicine, not 10 cents, because they get lower pricing.
[00:39:08] Dave Ricks: Per unit, big insurers like the United Health Care Center
[00:39:11] Dave Ricks: get a very good deal as well, approximating the government,
[00:39:14] Dave Ricks: and then smaller insurers and smaller employers get a worse and worse deal.
[00:39:18] Dave Ricks: That's the way we do it.
[00:39:21] Dave Ricks: What it means is that manufacturers compete mostly not on value,
[00:39:25] Dave Ricks: but on the pricing offering,
[00:39:28] on sort of the difference between the spread,
[00:39:31] Dave Ricks: between the list price and whatever that person got.
[00:39:34] Dave Ricks: Making it even worse, a number of intermediaries in that system that bulk by,
[00:39:38] Dave Ricks: take their returns on the percent off list.
[00:39:43] Dave Ricks: So the higher the list, the better they do.
[00:39:45] Dave Ricks: And I think that's a terrible incentive.
[00:39:48] Dave Ricks: These PBMs and there's some group purchasing organizations like this.
[00:39:51] Dave Ricks: That should go away.
[00:39:53] Dave Ricks: And I think health is different than other commodities.
[00:39:56] Dave Ricks: It's probably has a much more important social role.
[00:40:01] Dave Ricks: And deciding that the smallest, the little guy gets the worst deal,
[00:40:05] Dave Ricks: and the big guy gets the best deal, to me feels unethical.
[00:40:09] So I would be for a system that there is one price point.
[00:40:14] Dave Ricks: People can say yes or no to that.
[00:40:17] Dave Ricks: That's one way to have value.
[00:40:19] As an employer, you could say that's not worth it.
[00:40:21] Dave Ricks: We're not going to pay for that, and this one is worth it.
[00:40:23] Dave Ricks: That can be informed by really independent intermediaries who study these things.
[00:40:27] Dave Ricks: Look at all of the claims records, look at how people do on the medicine,
[00:40:30] Dave Ricks: weigh the risk and benefits and produce pricing.
[00:40:33] Dave Ricks: That happens in lots of other markets, bond pricing.
[00:40:36] Dave Ricks: Lots of people do this for living, just not in medicine.
[00:40:39] Dave Ricks: And I think that could be a useful tool in the US system.
[00:40:43] Dave Ricks: So that if you produce a truly surprising and positive clinical trial result,
[00:40:47] Dave Ricks: you could actually charge more.
[00:40:49] Dave Ricks: And that would induce other people to say, oh, let me go for higher risk,
[00:40:53] more valuable indications instead of just do the base that gets you in the door,
[00:40:57] Dave Ricks: now negotiate with the commercial team to drive more return.
[00:41:01] Dave Ricks: Oh, the patent clock's running out.
[00:41:02] Dave Ricks: Let's go to the next medicine.
[00:41:04] Dave Ricks: I think that's not a great system right now.
[00:41:06] Dave Ricks: There's the much discussed, like maybe with the top discussed,
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_02: topic in pharma that people know about generally is farmer pricing,
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_02: the disparity between the US and internationally,
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_02: where all the cost is in R&D, the cost of actually producing the drugs is fairly low.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_02: And so single payer health care systems internationally pay very low prices.
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_02: And so the R&D cost is borne by the US.
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_02: And the biggest problem is not only like at the margin,
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_02: maybe if fewer drugs developed because this phenomenon,
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_02: because you have fewer returns,
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_02: I think honestly the biggest problem is the social issues it creates in the US,
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_02: where it turns people against pharma and the insulin price disparities
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_02: between the US and Canada and things like that.
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_02: But so long exist, by the way.
[00:41:55] Dave Ricks: Because we fixed that.
[00:41:56] Dave Ricks: But that was like the hot topic.
[00:41:58] Dave Ricks: Yes, it was a hot topic.
[00:41:59] Dave Ricks: And in the next class, an example of this commercial environment I spoke about,
[00:42:03] Dave Ricks: I mean, our actual net on insulin really hasn't changed.
[00:42:06] Dave Ricks: It's like 30 or 40 dollars.
[00:42:08] Dave Ricks: But the list price got up to 275 Y.
[00:42:10] Dave Ricks: We were competing on the spread.
[00:42:12] And so that just drove this huge...
[00:42:14] So, individual spread.
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_01: What do you mean?
[00:42:16] Dave Ricks: Okay, so insulin.
[00:42:18] Dave Ricks: So it was the latest versions were launched in the 90s and 2000,
[00:42:21] Dave Ricks: but they got quite a long in their life cycle.
[00:42:24] Dave Ricks: Because...
[00:42:25] Dave Ricks: Well, they were passed their patent window actually.
[00:42:28] Dave Ricks: But there were no competitors.
[00:42:30] Dave Ricks: Why? His net pricing was pretty low.
[00:42:32] Dave Ricks: How could it be so low?
[00:42:34] Dave Ricks: The incumbent players, mostly Novo and Lily,
[00:42:37] Dave Ricks: come back to that on GLPs as well, same players,
[00:42:40] Dave Ricks: had a lot of capex in the ground.
[00:42:42] Dave Ricks: And to start a new insulin company made no sense.
[00:42:45] Dave Ricks: At the net prices we were achieving.
[00:42:47] Dave Ricks: Yet at the same time, the public viewed this as this outrageous price gouging
[00:42:51] Dave Ricks: because list prices, if we were getting about 40 dollars a month of therapy,
[00:42:55] Dave Ricks: were like 270.
[00:42:56] And so...
[00:42:57] Dave Ricks: Who's getting the 235?
[00:42:59] Dave Ricks: Yeah, so middle actors.
[00:43:02] And so big PBMs like United Healthcare Runs and CVS and ExpressCrips,
[00:43:08] Dave Ricks: were offering to employers and others, the government as well.
[00:43:12] Dave Ricks: We will create an auction.
[00:43:14] Dave Ricks: And in this auction, we will get a take on the percent we save you off the list price.
[00:43:19] And you will get a lower price than you could on your own.
[00:43:22] Dave Ricks: And we will create an auction by...
[00:43:24] Dave Ricks: And these were...
[00:43:25] Dave Ricks: This is actually a highly interchangeable class.
[00:43:27] Dave Ricks: They're not exactly the same substance, but they are pretty close.
[00:43:30] Dave Ricks: And so they could do this more easily.
[00:43:33] Dave Ricks: And they'll say, we'll just pick one.
[00:43:35] Dave Ricks: And every January, manufacturer mail us your best deal.
[00:43:38] Dave Ricks: And the best deals that tended to win, we learned through time,
[00:43:41] Dave Ricks: were those that had the biggest spread between the high list price and the low net price.
[00:43:45] Dave Ricks: So we competed on this.
[00:43:47] Dave Ricks: What do we do?
[00:43:48] Dave Ricks: We kept raising the list price and modestly lowering our net price.
[00:43:51] Dave Ricks: That was how the market evolved.
[00:43:53] Dave Ricks: And after 10 years you had this huge bubble, it grows to net bubble.
[00:43:56] Dave Ricks: And who is paying?
[00:43:57] Dave Ricks: Okay, so you weren't paying.
[00:43:58] Dave Ricks: You were paying.
[00:43:59] Dave Ricks: You were paying.
[00:44:00] Dave Ricks: But the person who walked in the pharmacy with no insurance, they had to pay that.
[00:44:03] Dave Ricks: That's our reach.
[00:44:04] Dave Ricks: That's what I mean.
[00:44:05] Dave Ricks: That should not exist.
[00:44:06] Dave Ricks: We were able to disarm that through a number of actions.
[00:44:09] Dave Ricks: But the critical first one was we went to the government.
[00:44:12] Dave Ricks: And we said, we don't want this problem anymore.
[00:44:14] Dave Ricks: We're an innovative company.
[00:44:15] Dave Ricks: It looks bad for you.
[00:44:16] Dave Ricks: It looks terrible.
[00:44:17] Dave Ricks: And it's also producing these unfair outcomes.
[00:44:19] Dave Ricks: We're going to, because no generic has applied for a copy of our medicine or biosimilar,
[00:44:24] Dave Ricks: we will create our own.
[00:44:26] So we launched our own biosimilar.
[00:44:28] Dave Ricks: It says, lily on the bottle, it says, insulin lice pro, which is the generic name.
[00:44:32] Dave Ricks: And we priced it really cheap, like a third of the regular product.
[00:44:36] Dave Ricks: Similar net price actually, but quite a bit less.
[00:44:40] Interesting fact, that launched all these insurance companies and middle people called me and said, why did you do this?
[00:44:46] As well, because we're trying to lower in some prices, they said, don't.
[00:44:51] This is a threat to our model.
[00:44:52] Dave Ricks: I don't care.
[00:44:53] Dave Ricks: Like we have a higher calling.
[00:44:55] And so it's my first year.
[00:44:57] Dave Ricks: No formularies covered this.
[00:44:59] Dave Ricks: So it was really only for that cash payer.
[00:45:01] Dave Ricks: No insurance company picked it up, even though it was dramatically cheaper.
[00:45:04] Dave Ricks: Now it's about half of the willing, but still half, not because that model of this margin spread model is still there.
[00:45:13] Dave Ricks: But we largely have defanged that problem by introducing a copy of our own medicine.
[00:45:18] Dave Ricks: You know, I think we can get into differences between the US healthcare system and the rest of the world,
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_02: where the US has a very vibrant private healthcare system, and it's kind of weirdly unpopular, at least in certain parts of the political discussion.
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_02: But there's choice.
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so basically, let me just answer that.
[00:45:35] Dave Ricks: So it is true.
[00:45:36] Dave Ricks: If you fund, if you announce that, hey, I want to back some biotechs, and they sent you their business plan, 80 to 100% of the revenue and return,
[00:45:44] Dave Ricks: they'll pitch you on as the US.
[00:45:46] Meaning there is no return outside the US if you started the point of origin of the idea.
[00:45:52] Dave Ricks: Now, once we get to the market with a product, it's not censical to not market it in these countries, at whatever price you can get,
[00:46:00] Dave Ricks: because your R&D is paid for on the US launch.
[00:46:02] Dave Ricks: So you're just margin gathering, but it's the free rider.
[00:46:05] Dave Ricks: But it's the free rider.
[00:46:06] Dave Ricks: Because at John's point, this seems increasingly politically unthenable.
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_01: I agree.
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_01: Americans are waking up to this.
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_01: We should get rid of it.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_01: It's actually not good for our industry either, because you get a skewing in addition to the problem that social-bombing you.
[00:46:19] Dave Ricks: So what does everyone do?
[00:46:20] Dave Ricks: They tune the R&D model to the US healthcare problems when actually we're 5% of the world population.
[00:46:26] Dave Ricks: So shouldn't we tune it to the global health problems and reward the global health problem?
[00:46:31] Dave Ricks: Yeah, well, we're 25% of GDP, but none of the last.
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_01: Okay, 25%.
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_01: We should get rid of it.
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_01: We should solve this.
[00:46:39] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:46:40] Dave Ricks: How?
[00:46:41] Dave Ricks: So I pitched this idea to the administration, actually.
[00:46:44] Dave Ricks: So what's I call the one fair price?
[00:46:46] Dave Ricks: So you go brand new.
[00:46:48] Dave Ricks: Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:49] Dave Ricks: We're learning.
[00:46:50] Dave Ricks: I need an Apple price.
[00:46:51] Dave Ricks: Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:52] OFB.
[00:46:53] That's it.
[00:46:54] Dave Ricks: Yeah.
[00:46:55] Dave Ricks: But the idea would be that manufacturers introduced to the price they want.
[00:46:58] Dave Ricks: They are restricted by only a couple of things.
[00:47:01] Dave Ricks: One is that they will meet to introduce it in other developed economies in a price band that's sensitive to the GDP of those countries, GDP per capita.
[00:47:12] Dave Ricks: So because the ability to pay, I think, should largely be born by more wealthy nations.
[00:47:17] Dave Ricks: Okay, so you're saying that's where the surplus is.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_01: You introduced a drug that costs $100 in the US.
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_01: You're saying it should cost you on the order of $70.
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_01: $70 in the UK or whatever.
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's 30% less GDP per capita.
[00:47:29] Dave Ricks: We would introduce it 70%.
[00:47:31] Dave Ricks: Those countries can say yes or no, but we would basically sign a compact that would say that's our deal.
[00:47:36] We think it's worth 100.
[00:47:37] Dave Ricks: We can not sell it there, but not because we're lowering it below 70.
[00:47:42] Right.
[00:47:43] Dave Ricks: And we have to charge them what we think it's worth.
[00:47:45] Dave Ricks: And you could do that today.
[00:47:47] Dave Ricks: We could.
[00:47:48] Dave Ricks: So what?
[00:47:49] Yeah, what I just do.
[00:47:50] Dave Ricks: That's fixed number one.
[00:47:51] Dave Ricks: Fix number two is that the reimbursement system you're starting with US government self, we need to get rid of all discounts and rebates.
[00:47:58] Dave Ricks: So that the product moves through the channel physically at one price and is reimbursed at that same price.
[00:48:05] Dave Ricks: You have to select that price.
[00:48:06] Dave Ricks: And here you're not price discriminating anymore.
[00:48:08] Dave Ricks: You have to sort of look at all the equities around that and say, this is the fair price that I select.
[00:48:14] Dave Ricks: And I'm going to live with that just like other commodities and things we buy every day.
[00:48:19] Dave Ricks: And there's no skimming of that number.
[00:48:22] Dave Ricks: And with that then, I think you would have two good outcomes.
[00:48:26] Dave Ricks: You would have a fair decision about who pays for the R&D.
[00:48:31] Dave Ricks: Presumably companies will look at the global opportunity or at least the developed countries.
[00:48:35] Dave Ricks: And set a price that might be a little lower in the US than normal because they want to sell to Europe.
[00:48:40] Dave Ricks: Because there's more volume available.
[00:48:41] Dave Ricks: And if they price too high because it's indexed, they would not be able to do that.
[00:48:45] Dave Ricks: What you're describing is an instantiation of what I view as the general phenomenon.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_02: One of the biggest shortcomings of the US healthcare system in my view and when the biggest critiques you can have is, none of the numbers mean anything.
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_02: Just a number that you see, they're all lies.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_02: And that kind of has to lead to market failure.
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, could you imagine this?
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_02: Like we go to a restaurant tonight and someone gives us a wine list.
[00:49:08] Dave Ricks: And a bottle of like $100 an apple, Cabernet is like $14,000.
[00:49:12] Dave Ricks: But then the waiter says, don't worry, that's not your copay.
[00:49:16] Dave Ricks: What's my copay? I can't tell you.
[00:49:19] Dave Ricks: We enjoy the wine. We have a nice dinner.
[00:49:21] Dave Ricks: Four weeks later, you get a letter in the mail that starts at the top by saying,
[00:49:26] Dave Ricks: this is not a bill.
[00:49:28] But it says the $14,000.
[00:49:30] Dave Ricks: And then there's a number of deductions.
[00:49:32] Dave Ricks: And it says, this is not a bill. Don't pay this.
[00:49:34] Dave Ricks: And then later, you get an actual bill. This is healthcare pricing.
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_02: But it feels like you would pull on this thread quite a bit.
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_02: And the next admin should, of just the numbers, should mean something.
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_02: Like the FCC does this a lot.
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_02: They say that four consumers, numbers should be trusted.
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_02: And yet we kind of let the healthcare system off.
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's no pre-posting and pricing.
[00:49:54] Dave Ricks: Now with drugs there is. So one of the things we get criticism I push back is like,
[00:49:58] Dave Ricks: well, because you can know a list price of a drug.
[00:50:00] Dave Ricks: Actually, most every, the other 90 percent, you mostly can't know the price.
[00:50:04] Dave Ricks: Well, we've introduced regulations in the last couple of years,
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_01: mandating some degree of transparency here.
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_01: Yes. Have those total failure.
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. If you look up in your region, who is actually complied?
[00:50:15] Dave Ricks: Compliance is terrible. Most major hospital systems have not complied.
[00:50:19] Dave Ricks: Or if they have, they put on a website somewhere, a coded database that is impossible to interpret with ICD-10 codes
[00:50:28] Dave Ricks: and price points that consumers cannot digest.
[00:50:31] Dave Ricks: Like the Hitchhiker's guys. It's a non-searchable beware of the leopard.
[00:50:34] Dave Ricks: You know, flat file with everything they have.
[00:50:38] Dave Ricks: It's malicious compliance.
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, or facial or whatever.
[00:50:42] Dave Ricks: So that's not working and we need to have that.
[00:50:45] Dave Ricks: I've actually gone to like an imaging center, and I ask, like, what's this cost?
[00:50:49] Dave Ricks: And the person gets irritated with me.
[00:50:51] Like, why are you asking that? Like, I don't know.
[00:50:54] Dave Ricks: I generally ask that before.
[00:50:56] Dave Ricks: I want to know what it cost.
[00:50:57] Dave Ricks: I had a situation. My physician is like attached to a hospital.
[00:51:02] Dave Ricks: Here's another terrible thing about US healthcare.
[00:51:04] Dave Ricks: Is that the federal rules require payment differences based on side of care.
[00:51:09] So if you're in outpatient clinic, which is theoretically cheaper,
[00:51:12] Dave Ricks: the reimbursement is lower, not because it's less valuable,
[00:51:16] Dave Ricks: but because it's cheaper to deliver.
[00:51:18] We punish that. We reward where it's more expensive in a hospital complex.
[00:51:22] Dave Ricks: So my doctor's there. He's like, hey, you can get a blood draw downstairs.
[00:51:25] Dave Ricks: Why don't you go do that now and then come back up.
[00:51:27] Dave Ricks: So I went down there. They drew my blood.
[00:51:29] Five minutes later, when she was office, the result was there.
[00:51:31] Dave Ricks: And I'm like, I should ask with that cost.
[00:51:34] Dave Ricks: So I'm like, oh, yeah, I asked. They're like, that was $650.
[00:51:37] I'm like, for a blood draw? Like, that's insane.
[00:51:40] Dave Ricks: And they ran it in their own lab there. No one asked.
[00:51:43] Dave Ricks: And I think that's a major, major pricing problem we have in healthcare.
[00:51:47] Dave Ricks: And then, you know, I think people are insulated from those costs,
[00:51:50] Dave Ricks: but in strange ways. Some things are deductible, some are not.
[00:51:53] Dave Ricks: And so it's really very difficult to make informed consumer economic decisions in health.
[00:51:59] Dave Ricks: And we need to improve that.
[00:52:00] Dave Ricks: The other thing I observe about the US healthcare system,
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_02: so Patronite, both Groban Island moved here for college.
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_02: And the US has a very vibrant private healthcare system,
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_02: which is different from kind of many other countries,
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_02: which have public government run and funded healthcare systems.
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_02: What I notice is people just have a weird reaction to private healthcare.
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_02: Private hospitals people think are weird, despite the fact that, you know,
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_02: you have much shorter wait times in the US than you have in many other countries,
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_02: because we have more kind of hospitals and all these new private outpatient specialty.
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_02: But the biggest one is when people come to the US,
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_02: they're shocked by farm advertising.
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_02: And they put on a sports game and just like the break comes and it's all farm ads.
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_02: And my understanding is that there's a significant pro-social defense of this,
[00:52:48] SPEAKER_02: which is many of these drugs are shown through all the extensive trials that, you know,
[00:52:52] SPEAKER_02: we make you guys do, to have a significant health benefit.
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_02: And then it needs to then being prescribed more by doctors,
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_02: because people actually ask their doctors,
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_02: they do in fact do the thing they ask their doctor about them.
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_02: And it needs to more usage.
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_02: But yes, people just find the whole thing weird, you know,
[00:53:07] SPEAKER_02: private for-profit healthcare.
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_02: And so do you view on where this goes, what we can do about it?
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Well, not having grown up in a system like Ireland,
[00:53:16] Dave Ricks: but I lived in Canada for a while, six years.
[00:53:19] Dave Ricks: So I was treated and I'd have seen it.
[00:53:21] Dave Ricks: Yeah. I find it weird the other way, because that's your conditioning.
[00:53:25] Dave Ricks: I think there's good and bad to both.
[00:53:28] Dave Ricks: I think actually we were talking about prevention earlier.
[00:53:31] Dave Ricks: To some degree primary care, what I experienced in that country was pretty good quality of care.
[00:53:38] Dave Ricks: Very standardized, which has a confidence boosting thing when it's the same for everybody.
[00:53:45] Dave Ricks: That also in specialty care is implemented, but actually to kind of a negative result,
[00:53:51] Dave Ricks: because take like diagnostics.
[00:53:55] Dave Ricks: The US in China have something like 70% of all diagnostic capacity in the world.
[00:54:01] That's crazy.
[00:54:02] Dave Ricks: Yeah. But your chance of finding a tumor or something is much, much higher in those two countries than Ireland or certainly the UK.
[00:54:09] Dave Ricks: And that's not a good outcome.
[00:54:12] Dave Ricks: Why? Because I think they're focused on cost of delivery and evenness instead of exceptional care.
[00:54:19] Dave Ricks: So I think we've moved on that axis of like let's offer something that could be the best and charge for it.
[00:54:26] Dave Ricks: Yet for common conditions, we've also moved on that axis unnecessarily.
[00:54:31] Dave Ricks: And so here you end up with hard oak floor, primary care offices and beautiful drapery and furniture.
[00:54:39] Dave Ricks: That's the basis of competition instead of actually it's quite a simple thing.
[00:54:42] Dave Ricks: You need your flu vaccine.
[00:54:45] Dave Ricks: Like just get in and get out.
[00:54:46] Dave Ricks: And there's a third thing coming, which you touched on, which is prevention and self care.
[00:54:51] Dave Ricks: And I actually think that if we think of the funding mechanism in our country, but also in Europe,
[00:54:56] Dave Ricks: and Europe's system has problems going forward, it was really built on an acute care model.
[00:55:00] Dave Ricks: When most illness and death was accidents, you know, things we couldn't solve,
[00:55:05] Dave Ricks: it was basically treat them as best you can and people were going to expire.
[00:55:09] Dave Ricks: That's what a hospital did.
[00:55:10] Dave Ricks: We've of course now evolved well beyond that.
[00:55:12] Dave Ricks: I think that's 30% of US cost.
[00:55:14] Dave Ricks: Now 70 is primary care and sort of, you know, the chronic disease.
[00:55:18] Dave Ricks: And those institutions and those funding models are really poorly suited to that.
[00:55:23] Dave Ricks: And particularly so, if behaviors have an input into that,
[00:55:28] Dave Ricks: don't we want people before they get the disease to modify their behavior?
[00:55:32] Dave Ricks: Well, how do you charge for that?
[00:55:34] Dave Ricks: And so, you know, there's a little bit of a selection problem that, you know,
[00:55:39] Dave Ricks: the best healthcare systems get the worst behaved people because the coverage is better.
[00:55:44] So, I think we, it is time for a rethink of the whole thing.
[00:55:47] Dave Ricks: And I would think of those three different things and try to solve for them differently.
[00:55:51] Dave Ricks: Right now we pretty much have one answer.
[00:55:53] Dave Ricks: And the Europe answer is produced kind of an institutional rationing model that seems very fair,
[00:55:59] Dave Ricks: but actually produces poor outcomes for acute conditions.
[00:56:02] Dave Ricks: And the US, which is very expensive, also is unfair,
[00:56:07] Dave Ricks: but produces good outcomes for acute conditions, probably just the same for everything else, but cost too much.
[00:56:12] Dave Ricks: That's, I think, needs to be addressed.
[00:56:15] Dave Ricks: In the future, and here are medicines plus information, I think can play a really big role in disease prevention.
[00:56:21] Dave Ricks: In the past, we haven't been able to make the angel problem in medicine is this thing we call therapeutic index.
[00:56:27] Dave Ricks: That's the difference between a dose which is harmful and one which is helpful.
[00:56:32] Dave Ricks: And a therapeutic index that's small is difficult.
[00:56:36] Dave Ricks: You have to very precisely dose and people have differences, so it requires a lot of attention.
[00:56:41] Dave Ricks: But over time, the techniques we make drugs with, that therapeutic index, the TI we call it, is expanding and expanding non-linearly.
[00:56:49] Dave Ricks: Because of that, are they expanding?
[00:56:52] Dave Ricks: Yeah, because of new drug technologies.
[00:56:54] Dave Ricks: Two main ones. One is going to the root of disease whether it be genetic or RNA blocking medicine.
[00:57:01] Dave Ricks: So a lot of diseases have excess protein.
[00:57:03] Dave Ricks: We can now really perceive the block, RNA production of the protein, and the disease without a lot of side of it.
[00:57:10] It goes away, and by the way, these medicines happily also have this catalytic effect.
[00:57:16] Dave Ricks: So they last a really long time.
[00:57:18] Dave Ricks: I mentioned L.P. Little A earlier, so that's a kind of cholesterol that's untreatable today.
[00:57:22] Dave Ricks: We're developing a medicine that will be a once or twice a year treatment for this.
[00:57:27] Dave Ricks: And the side effects look totally benign.
[00:57:30] That's a really wide therapeutic index.
[00:57:33] Dave Ricks: So now when you have that, you can think, well, my trials, I can run faster because I'm not, I don't have worries about treatment.
[00:57:39] Dave Ricks: They can be cheaper. I can charge less and get it to more people at scale.
[00:57:44] And I actually don't really need a healthcare system.
[00:57:48] Dave Ricks: And here, maybe back to the GOP ones, that's giving us a little bit of glimpse of these.
[00:57:52] Dave Ricks: These are more invasive than what I just described.
[00:57:55] Dave Ricks: But pretty safe. People know how to treat themselves.
[00:57:58] Dave Ricks: You certainly know if you have overweight or obesity.
[00:58:00] Dave Ricks: You don't need a doctor to tell you that.
[00:58:02] Dave Ricks: And platforms like R. Direct, platform of really taking off.
[00:58:06] Dave Ricks: Because it's self-paid, but people skip all this other morass and getting that this is not a bill piece of paper.
[00:58:12] Dave Ricks: And there's like, here's my Visa card number.
[00:58:14] Dave Ricks: Yeah, charge me 500 bucks, but my problem is getting solved.
[00:58:17] Dave Ricks: I think for prevention, that's an intriguing future.
[00:58:21] Dave Ricks: Direct to consumer.
[00:58:23] Dave Ricks: We're here in the great city of South San Francisco.
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_01: The home of Genentech and to some significant extent of the US biotech sector.
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_01: And we're talking a whole bunch here in this conversation about fostering and inducing and creating adequate incentives for R&D.
[00:58:42] SPEAKER_01: I think the, in some extent, you can buck a biotech and farm a separately, obviously the lines blur, but this kind of two pulls.
[00:58:50] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's very striking the extent to which, as far as I can see, at least the introduction of new medicines, new molecular entities, whatever, is increasingly dominated by biotechs.
[00:59:03] SPEAKER_01: And you would know the number is better than me, but I think that around two thirds, both of the revenue and also of the, just by count, the introductions themselves, are a tribute to biotechs rather than to pharma.
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_01: And so I guess I'm just curious how you think about this landscape.
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it is some view where the role of, in an extreme, one role of pharma would be to be a kind of private equity portfolio manager,
[00:59:30] SPEAKER_01: where you take stock of the landscape and you look at who's doing well, who's approach you believe in, et cetera.
[00:59:36] SPEAKER_01: And you have the risky innovation be done by earlier stage entities, by venture capitalists, what have you, and then you bet on winners, you go and scale them and you distribute them.
[00:59:46] SPEAKER_01: One model. Traditional model is, actually, no, you have all these internal R&D capabilities and you're vertically integrated and you have economies of scale and so on and so forth.
[00:59:56] SPEAKER_01: Are we shifting there, where between those polls ought we be, how is it changing, just thoughts in that whole landscape?
[01:00:03] Yeah, well, I think there's three models that have emerged. One is the biotech that grows up. Another is the outsourced early model you're describing, where we just say, we're good at clinical trials, everything before that.
[01:00:15] Dave Ricks: Just gobble it up as companies mature, be, you know, because the capital markets are so terrible as I described, it's a liquidity event for the investors, they go back and try something earlier.
[01:00:24] Dave Ricks: And sort of the hybrid of fully integrated plus. I don't think anyone's really pursuing just fully integrated anymore. I think your head's in the sand if you're doing that.
[01:00:34] We're running the third one. The other two are hybrid.
[01:00:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And why do we make that choice? I think we observe a few things. First of all, while it's true that the origin of, I think it's a little more than half of medicines approved in the last 10 years have come from biotech, hardly any of those traveled all the way through biotech.
[01:00:53] Because there are, as we talked about earlier, huge checks to write and risks to take. And the biotech investor base is not interested in those risks. Those very binary large checks, whereas we can absorb them, we can run a portfolio across many of those.
[01:01:07] Dave Ricks: There's also scale economies in clinical trials. There is no doubt in my mind. We are faster, more robust, probably cheaper than actually every biotech out there trying to do their own early-faced clinical trials.
[01:01:20] And manufacturing and distribution globally. So those things benefit scale. What doesn't? It is discovery. It's the early phase. I think that's a more diffuse undertaking.
[01:01:30] What we've done, starting with my predecessor maybe 15 years ago, is we started putting, spreading out our labs. Scales bad. And I think our idea was three or four hundred people about right with a focused mission, allow for some deviation.
[01:01:46] Dave Ricks: Put some outposts out there. Active invention has diseconomies in scale. So we started in San Diego, we built a monocle and antibody biotech hub there. It's produced like a third of the medicines we've made since we started hugely successful. There's 400 employees.
[01:02:01] So it's like a biotech, but it has some benefits. They don't have to spend any time with venture capitalists or raising money or fusing over capex and ups and downs in the markets.
[01:02:12] Dave Ricks: Why is it good to be small? Why is it good to have the 400% center in San Diego? I don't know. Super center. I think it's good to be big on clinical trials because you're doing global research. It's a scale operation, manufacturing, distribution, discovery. I don't know. Now we have people look across. And I think there is a benefit in being in a tribe. But I think it's also good to have some independence. There is a long list of pretty compelling inventions that came out of Lily that were not saying,
[01:02:41] Dave Ricks: they were not sanctioned projects. And so that tells you something. The curiosity and sort of the scientific endeavor. In sanctioned in hot way. Meaning it had a budget and had a number and a name and whatever. And it was or pointed at. Like, oh, here's a target. Go put a team around that and come up with the medicine. That does work. But sometimes someone just says, by the way, I didn't tell you, but I've been working on this thing over here. And it seems pretty interesting. And then we fund it. Have you guys formalized that like Google 20% time? Or are there some people are just incurring
[01:03:11] SPEAKER_02: curiosity or it depends on the area. But we have this allowable variation idea. We're scum. Is that phrase allowable variation? No, that's my word. But basically, you just turn turn away and see what happens. And we don't manage the budgets down to the nickel at these sites. And if you get good people, it's like, let them do their thing, let them cook. And let's see what happens. That's certainly worked. We built a big site. Let them cook school of farm innovation. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's the thing. And
[01:03:41] Dave Ricks: I can see this as a book. A lot of farm innovation is iterative, right? So the other problem is people quit too soon. So back to GOP1s. This story has been going. We launched the first GOP1 twice a day injection in 2006.
[01:03:55] People say, Oh, Dave, when did you know, like, is that bound to be huge? My God, I don't know, 2016, 2017. It was a long time ago. We've been on this story for a long time. And it was protein engineering and making better molecules. It could be dosed higher that led us to get to more weight loss effects.
[01:04:11] Dave Ricks: And then harnessing two mechanisms. So that's just that's not like light bulb single scientists in a dark lab. Like, I've got it. It's teams just grinding on a theme.
[01:04:22] Dave Ricks: And if we had directed that, like, Oh, make a dual acting, it'll be better. We wouldn't have got on the right hand. This is all about your internal innovation.
[01:04:29] Dave Ricks: Yes. So that's running. Yeah. What word did the biotech appear? And why do we do this? One, it is productive for us. And I do think we've built a capability to frankly make more
[01:04:38] molecules with more drug-like properties. So by the time you get to that expensive escalation of clinical trials, the drugs be having like a drug.
[01:04:46] Dave Ricks: Some of that, we talked about earlier with AI and other tools we can equip. So these things tend to work. These things don't. It's pretty empirical still. We don't know all of biology.
[01:04:55] Dave Ricks: Some of us just know how the chemists and scientists. But I think when we buy biotechs, often we love the target idea. We love the novelty. What they did.
[01:05:04] Dave Ricks: It's just rather imperfect. It's an 80-20 they've done. And we will often take that invention, cycle back and do a whole another invention loop to refine it further.
[01:05:14] Dave Ricks: So that it is a, what we call like a big pharma asset. So it's a problem. It's the proof that there's something here. Yeah.
[01:05:20] SPEAKER_02: But not necessarily this specific. Exactly. And if they haven't disclosed it and they've got a lead, that's very interesting.
[01:05:25] Dave Ricks: But we actively cultivate kind of a proximate satellite group of companies that are doing this independent of us.
[01:05:32] Dave Ricks: But we have ownership stakes in. And then of course we have a watch list ever growing because of China.
[01:05:39] Dave Ricks: Of entities we don't have an interest in. But are doing interesting things. And we want to, we have all their events mapped out. And we're watching pretty much every clinical or preclinical readout, every patent posting in the industry. We have a way to monitor.
[01:05:54] Dave Ricks: For most of its 150 year history, Eli Lilly's relationship with patients has been through pharmacies and other intermediaries. But that's changing. As Dave mentions with Lily Direct, patients can buy treatments like Manjaro and Zetbound directly from the company and get them delivered right to the door.
[01:06:12] SPEAKER_02: And they're not alone. As tribe, we're seeing a new playbook emerge where established businesses who used to sell via complex distribution chains are now building direct digital relationships with their customers.
[01:06:24] And with stripe, that's much more likely to succeed. It's happening across all industries, not just in healthcare media companies like Fox Sports. They used to reach viewers only through traditional cable bundles, but now they've looked a global direct customer streaming platform on stripe or for it. They're selling cars and trucks online through stripe and not just through dealerships.
[01:06:44] Some companies, they're creating entirely new products to take directly to their customers. So Fender, the guitar company, they created a tuition marketplace that has enabled millions of guitar class already.
[01:06:54] Large enterprises are creating better direct offerings than ever before with stripe. Learn more at stripe.com slash enterprise.
[01:07:04] So we just mentioned we're in South San Francisco in the Bay Area. The Bay Area of course used to have a vibrant electronics manufacturing industry and it left. Yeah, companies like the
[01:07:14] SPEAKER_01: Ampex side. Yeah, exactly. Some of the old. Yes, but but but tear child. Exactly. But the but you mentioned Cypress semiconductor and people people don't really know what you're talking about these days. The biotech sector started here in the 70s, I guess. And is exactly and is still today, reasonably vibrant, although to your point, it's had a tough maybe a couple of years. Chinese. The share of the global drug pipeline that was Chinese 10 years ago was I think in the small single digit. Yeah, exactly. Right. And now I think it's high 20s approaching.
[01:07:44] SPEAKER_01: Third, yeah, 30% it's a minute now is in fact 30% where does this go and is there a US biotech sector in 20 years or like electronics manufacturing does the whole thing just go to China.
[01:07:58] SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't predict that outcome. But I think we should ring the alarm bell right now. Well, I think is it bad. It's not. Great. I would say I think for two reasons, one,
[01:08:11] Dave Ricks: but if they can do it better, faster and cheaper and you get the drugs, isn't that awesome. That is good.
[01:08:16] Dave Ricks: If especially if the last part's true. But I think the economy around biopharma is I think has some unique
[01:08:23] Dave Ricks: properties that should make us want to own it. One is it is in the knowledge economy to me,
[01:08:30] Dave Ricks: sort of the pinnacle. Hard to medic knowledge economy. It's the premier league of knowledge economy.
[01:08:35] Dave Ricks: You guys find and know people. I mean, the diversity of skill sets needed to do it well at the highest level of their game is extreme.
[01:08:45] Dave Ricks: I don't think it exists. Maybe rocketry. Maybe there's a few other things like this, but it is requires a lot of talent.
[01:08:52] Dave Ricks: So it tells you how you're doing, I think, in a way. Can you integrate these? Can you train people, attract them from abroad?
[01:08:59] Dave Ricks: Like you folks or train them here and put them together in a way that produces new value.
[01:09:03] Dave Ricks: Okay, so it's a kind of shadow passing over the country if biotech.
[01:09:07] Dave Ricks: And it's rewarded. I mean, these are well-paying jobs. There's a big economic footprint that goes with that.
[01:09:13] Dave Ricks: And increasingly we're putting manufacturing near it. So it actually has a trickle down that's pretty significant as well.
[01:09:19] Dave Ricks: And then it invokes also security concerns. And you can imagine if we had the COVID pandemic,
[01:09:29] in that case, basically 80% of the medicines and vaccines that worked were producing the United States.
[01:09:35] Dave Ricks: China produced some of those things. None of them really worked. We didn't import them.
[01:09:39] Dave Ricks: But imagine if that was flipped. And the EU self-exhausted opposition.
[01:09:45] Dave Ricks: I think, yeah, the EU has a huge controversy. And they're friendly and we had open trading.
[01:09:49] Dave Ricks: But they had had a reckoning as well. And there's some things you just want to have a national competency in.
[01:09:55] Dave Ricks: So anyway, I have a theory about the industry. I think there are truly novel concepts that require a little more time and work.
[01:10:03] And it is yet to be seen whether China has perfected that in a way where they can create their own local system.
[01:10:11] Dave Ricks: What they've certainly shown now, though, is the iterative derivative, which is a big part of the substrate of the industry.
[01:10:19] They are refining and becoming experts in very, very quickly.
[01:10:23] I think that's not all that. There'll be more competition.
[01:10:26] There's an effect in China where their own price competition defeats their own industries.
[01:10:32] Dave Ricks: And you're seeing that in biotech as well. The race to the bottom on pricing.
[01:10:37] Dave Ricks: But I think we want a national competency here. And I think this has been a hub.
[01:10:40] Dave Ricks: Boston is still a big hub. We want to keep those.
[01:10:43] Dave Ricks: There's this new phenomenon where my understanding, please correct me, is that
[01:10:49] SPEAKER_02: traditionally you develop a molecule, you patent the molecule.
[01:10:51] SPEAKER_02: Now there's the growth of these clones where you can have the molecule be
[01:10:55] SPEAKER_02: trivially different enough for patent purposes, but still the same action.
[01:11:00] SPEAKER_02: And the huge amount of that coming out of the Chinese biotech sector, doesn't that?
[01:11:04] SPEAKER_02: But I think also some real like this, I have an ICM app that seems real and good and novel.
[01:11:08] SPEAKER_02: Also real innovation. That's an interesting one.
[01:11:10] SPEAKER_02: But don't the clones effectively erode the patent system?
[01:11:14] SPEAKER_02: And we would think shortening the patent life to 15 years would be bad.
[01:11:17] SPEAKER_02: And 10 years. And this is shortening the patent life effectively.
[01:11:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I think that practice is what I'm talking about with this sort of refine and replicate.
[01:11:26] Dave Ricks: And our own patent system forces this, right? So we have a in 2011, the US
[01:11:30] Dave Ricks: changed the patent system the first to file versus first to invent.
[01:11:34] Dave Ricks: You spill the invent and sit on your patent.
[01:11:36] Dave Ricks: And all you had to do is prove it was messy court cases because your lab notebook said,
[01:11:40] Dave Ricks: oh, it was October of 2017 and mine says 2018, well, which was what, right?
[01:11:45] Dave Ricks: But now you rush to file. And the government I think has 12 months that they sit on that
[01:11:51] Dave Ricks: inspection. And then the patent, what is a patent? It's a it's a degree to publish your finding,
[01:11:56] Dave Ricks: right? To make it a public good in return for that monopoly.
[01:12:00] Dave Ricks: But if the monopoly is debased by 30 Chinese biotechs who feed that patent into a computer,
[01:12:08] Dave Ricks: the computer then can imagine chemical structures that have one or two atom differences that
[01:12:13] Dave Ricks: don't fit within the patent and then make that substance tested works just the same.
[01:12:18] Dave Ricks: You've created basically a shadow generic industry and undermine the patent system itself.
[01:12:22] Dave Ricks: So I don't think that's a great, great thing. So was the shadow generic industry
[01:12:26] SPEAKER_02: basically launched by first to file because we published the instruction manuals? I hadn't realized that.
[01:12:30] SPEAKER_02: And do you think is it your view? He just switched back?
[01:12:33] SPEAKER_02: No. What I would do is if we want to sort of like an America first patent system or Europe first,
[01:12:41] Dave Ricks: we should do two things. We should create a belt and suspenders so that some patents are tricky
[01:12:47] Dave Ricks: to write. So there might have been an IP space that's been mined and people are around the idea,
[01:12:52] Dave Ricks: but you had an insight that actually unlocked the truth. And there's a like a thin strip.
[01:13:00] But you have to carefully navigate this concept called prior art and get that patent to stick.
[01:13:05] Dave Ricks: People tend to constrain it more and you leave room with the edges.
[01:13:09] Should we make the basis of reward to investors, the patent filer, the patent writer?
[01:13:16] Dave Ricks: That's really the most valuable step in that case. I don't think so.
[01:13:19] Dave Ricks: So a belt and suspenders would be say independent of a patent. We'll give you 12 years
[01:13:24] Dave Ricks: if you produce primary data on this product all the way through base three.
[01:13:28] Dave Ricks: That's a $3 billion ticket. These copycats aren't going to do it. They're certainly not going to do it
[01:13:33] Dave Ricks: with US in US data. And that'll be more or less constrained to markets that don't care about that
[01:13:39] issue and don't have this data exclusivity provision. This already exists in biologics by the way.
[01:13:44] Dave Ricks: So all we have to do is in small molecules and this problem we're talking about is mostly a small
[01:13:47] Dave Ricks: molecule problem. The other thing we should do is say if you are in a league of nations that really
[01:13:56] Dave Ricks: respect IP, those nations will extend this confidentiality period beyond the patent inspection period.
[01:14:03] That society will get the recipe well in time for a generic company to copy it later.
[01:14:08] Dave Ricks: But why does it feed 12 months? That's a super short time in drug development. How about six years?
[01:14:15] Dave Ricks: Then that product is well into the clinic. The copycat nation can spin up in China,
[01:14:20] Dave Ricks: but it's not going to make a difference. So I think those two solutions together would be what I'd
[01:14:25] Dave Ricks: recommend. And the electronics manufacturing industry went to China for pretty straightforward
[01:14:31] SPEAKER_01: reasons. It's very labor intensive and I guess raw material intensive and just lots of reasons
[01:14:40] SPEAKER_01: that you bring in China. But the software production industry has not that is still here. To your
[01:14:45] SPEAKER_01: point, biotech is an extremely knowledge and tacit expertise intensive space. Why is that one
[01:14:54] SPEAKER_01: going to China? Yeah. Well, I'm not sure it's going to, that's why I say I'm not sure.
[01:14:59] Dave Ricks: We're not at Eclipse, but a significant share of it has got to China. I mean, China has a
[01:15:05] Dave Ricks: robust software industry. We have a two-world internet world. And they have their, I don't know
[01:15:12] Dave Ricks: how well Striped does in China, but I would guess not very well. Yeah, okay. Well, or Adobe,
[01:15:19] Dave Ricks: I'm on the board of that company and I can tell you there's a diminimous sales in China.
[01:15:23] Dave Ricks: But a lot of usage. Well, and there are tools domestically that have been built around that,
[01:15:28] Dave Ricks: that have their own economy. We could, that could be a state that this is driving into where
[01:15:33] Dave Ricks: there's sort of medicines that grow up in the world where we, where there's perhaps more
[01:15:37] Dave Ricks: transparency where the regulatory systems are more confidence instilling. And we perhaps
[01:15:44] Dave Ricks: reform the system to protect that and China has their own version. And there's good reasons
[01:15:48] Dave Ricks: they would want to do that because if we own all the medicines and there is another crisis,
[01:15:53] Dave Ricks: I'm sure they were deeply uncomfortable. In fact, they didn't even approve. They had rights to
[01:15:57] Dave Ricks: the biotech Pfizer vaccine for almost the entirety of their pandemic. They never approved it.
[01:16:04] Dave Ricks: Why? I think it was a national pride issue. Didn't want to be beholden. It was a German invention,
[01:16:09] Dave Ricks: actually. But yeah, so again, it intertwines with, you know, health emergencies are social crises
[01:16:17] Dave Ricks: that politically are difficult to navigate as we saw. And having that competency is important.
[01:16:22] Dave Ricks: So I totally respect their desire to build this. We have brilliant Chinese scientists in the world
[01:16:28] Dave Ricks: and many of them work at our company and retrain in the United States. That's all good. I just
[01:16:33] Dave Ricks: think we don't want it to move all offshore. I don't know when exactly the generics industry
[01:16:38] really rose to be such a large share of consumed pharmaceuticals today. But I'm very curious
[01:16:45] SPEAKER_01: about the quality control and the attendant regulatory apparatus around us, where, I mean, as we've
[01:16:52] SPEAKER_01: been discussing, there's such scrupulousness and stringency around clinical trials for new
[01:16:57] SPEAKER_01: molecules and introductions and so forth. My understanding is that for generics, a lot of the
[01:17:03] SPEAKER_01: external validation certification happens at the manufacturing plant level, not at the individual
[01:17:08] SPEAKER_01: drug level. And that for the individual drugs, it is substantially a case of self-certification
[01:17:15] SPEAKER_01: and, you know, presentation of one's own data as opposed to external audits. And there have been
[01:17:21] SPEAKER_01: many cases of documented fraud and malfeasance here. The largest generic manufacturer in India,
[01:17:27] SPEAKER_01: if you have its name, paid a half a billion dollar fine in 2013 for rampant fraud and falsification
[01:17:34] SPEAKER_01: and abuse of the biosimilarity analyses and so forth. Which obviously is bad, but you
[01:17:41] SPEAKER_01: like the apparatus and the FDA regime is such that there are very obvious incentives for that to
[01:17:48] SPEAKER_01: happen. And then I'm very struck by how anecdotally and online, there are so many reports of people
[01:17:55] SPEAKER_01: switching from brand name medication to generic medication, finding them to be very different,
[01:18:03] SPEAKER_01: subjectively and experientially, switching back to the branded pharmaceuticals and things going
[01:18:10] SPEAKER_01: back to normal as it were. And so some kind of subjective version of the generics, in fact, not,
[01:18:16] SPEAKER_01: you know, directly substitutable. And so I guess I mean, I know nothing about this domain,
[01:18:21] SPEAKER_01: this is all just observed from afar. I guess I'm curious for your thoughts here. Like, does the
[01:18:24] SPEAKER_01: generic industry actually work as well as we think it does? How much fraud is there in actuality?
[01:18:30] SPEAKER_01: You know, when your kids or family or friends or whatever are taking a generic, you know, do you
[01:18:35] SPEAKER_01: advise them to exercise some caution, thoughts in this whole space? I think on the whole, the generic
[01:18:41] Dave Ricks: environment in the US, which is the most developed in the sense of percent of medicines consumed
[01:18:47] Dave Ricks: and the cheapest in the OECD has been largely a positive outcome because it's made effective
[01:18:54] Dave Ricks: medicines abundant at very, very low cost. I mean, do you have the generic industry in the US? Do
[01:18:59] SPEAKER_01: you mean those manufacturing in the US or consumers? There are no generic manufacturing.
[01:19:02] Dave Ricks: Okay. So those that are licensed in the US and sold here, that said, and I say that because,
[01:19:09] you know, take like invention like statins or HIV drugs or we invented prozac, still the standard
[01:19:17] Dave Ricks: care and treating depression, it's like three cents a day. There are, I don't know any product you
[01:19:22] Dave Ricks: buy for three cents a day, but you know, that's an incredible value for the system. And back to the
[01:19:28] Dave Ricks: return on investment thing, somehow we have not articulated this very well. But the fact that we
[01:19:34] Dave Ricks: spent money in the 80s researching prozac and still today, there's tens of millions of people
[01:19:38] Dave Ricks: benefiting. That's a public surplus that should make us want more of those inventions. But anyway,
[01:19:44] Dave Ricks: the aggression. So in the 80s also, there was a change in the policy in the US, which was a trade
[01:19:50] Dave Ricks: to basically make it easier for generics to enter the market after patent X-PRI in exchange for
[01:19:56] Dave Ricks: less patent litigation. So there was a structured path to litigation. It wasn't just a free for all.
[01:20:02] Dave Ricks: It used to be in the 70s, 60s. The day you launched, you'd have to be in court. And by nature,
[01:20:08] Dave Ricks: those cases are, you have to defend all comers and if one gets through you lose. So it's a very asymmetrical
[01:20:14] Dave Ricks: problem and it wasn't good. So we traded that for certainty in a time window and a structured
[01:20:21] Dave Ricks: path to patent litigation. But the day after the last ballot patent was expired, generics could
[01:20:28] Dave Ricks: enter freely and could get on the market with a clearer bar, a lower bar, perhaps. There's two
[01:20:38] Dave Ricks: deviations that can occur. One is it's the so-called 5% rule where plus or minus 5% of the active
[01:20:43] Dave Ricks: ingredient. And some dosages in some people are more sensitive than that. And I think some of
[01:20:49] Dave Ricks: those people have an effect. Also, there's this in a, particularly in a dry product in a pill,
[01:20:54] Dave Ricks: there's acceptance, which are the other ingredients. Most of what you're taking is not actually the
[01:20:58] Dave Ricks: active ingredient. Some of them are buffering compounds. Some of them affect absorption rate.
[01:21:05] Dave Ricks: So those two things combined do lead to different effects. And there is no requirement for small
[01:21:11] Dave Ricks: molecule, chemical medicine to show proof efficacy of any kind. So you can do pretty simple laboratory
[01:21:19] Dave Ricks: experiments and absorption experiments in a small number of people. This is to do like PK,
[01:21:23] Dave Ricks: but not exactly. And that is what they all do. None of them do efficacy. So that makes them cheap.
[01:21:29] Dave Ricks: And it makes them plenty of them coming. But it has this side effect. I think it might be useful to
[01:21:36] Dave Ricks: have a way to flag medicines that before they go generic, have this known dosing sensitivity.
[01:21:43] You know, again, back to the less binary regulatory, more, you know, a little more judgment where
[01:21:48] Dave Ricks: there's a dial. I think the manufacturing problems you mentioned are real. In the quest for low cost,
[01:21:53] Dave Ricks: it all moved offshore. These are basically chemical plants. And in the, in the prior iteration of
[01:21:58] Dave Ricks: that technology and our EPA, it became non-economic to make these medicines in the US or Ireland for
[01:22:05] Dave Ricks: that matter. We, there are some Eastern European companies. There are some, there's a big
[01:22:10] Dave Ricks: years, Israeli company. There's several Indian companies and many Chinese companies that are in
[01:22:14] Dave Ricks: this business. That's where these drugs come from. I think that is not so stable either. And we
[01:22:20] Dave Ricks: probably should pay a little bit more for generics. You sometimes read about injectable generics,
[01:22:25] Dave Ricks: and particularly that run short. That's a more complicated manufacturing process. So if you do it
[01:22:30] Dave Ricks: cheaply, you run into more problems. We probably should pay a little premium for resilience.
[01:22:36] Dave Ricks: Right now, that's, that's not the situation. So, GIPs obviously were initially researched. The
[01:22:47] SPEAKER_02: initial R&D was done for diabetes. Yes. And then it was noticed during the clinical trials that
[01:22:53] SPEAKER_02: people were losing ways. Yes. And so now, I think the big societal discussion, like Pat, we're
[01:22:58] SPEAKER_02: talking about the information is a Silicon Valley tech publication. And they're on a survey about
[01:23:02] SPEAKER_02: GLP ones and half of readers of the information are on GLP ones. In this, exactly. As you can tell,
[01:23:09] SPEAKER_02: it's not a normal reader. Yeah. Anyway, so at the weight loss. Maybe in the Silicon Valley is some
[01:23:13] SPEAKER_01: kind of harbinger of things to come. Good, potentially. Really adopters. So this is this big weight loss
[01:23:18] SPEAKER_02: discussion. And you know, that's the ozampic, obviously, you know, different brand name for a different
[01:23:21] SPEAKER_02: drug. But people are very familiar with this. But now it seems like we are starting to figure out
[01:23:27] SPEAKER_02: there are all these other potential benefits of GLPs that do not seem to be fully explained
[01:23:35] SPEAKER_02: by the weight loss. And so there's the cardiovascular benefits. There's essential Alzheimer's
[01:23:40] SPEAKER_02: links, there's fertility. There are all these things that aren't just you lost weight.
[01:23:45] What do you think is going on there? Explain. So first of all, it's different from what you just
[01:23:49] Dave Ricks: described as this accident. Because actually we knew and we were involved with the, we launched the
[01:23:54] Dave Ricks: first GLP one of the world. The Triumph of rational design. It's not totally rational. But I can tell
[01:24:01] Dave Ricks: you that because the, so GLP one is, let's go all the way back. What it's a super family of things
[01:24:05] Dave Ricks: we call Anchortons. These are hormones that signal our brain and other tissues from our gut.
[01:24:12] Dave Ricks: We always think about our brain being in charge. It's not how we work. So and it's back to the
[01:24:18] Dave Ricks: space, six system of survival, which is in nutrition. It's nutrition. It's true and over. When you eat a meal,
[01:24:23] Dave Ricks: which hopefully we'll do later, our body, our gut actually communicates with our somebody,
[01:24:28] Dave Ricks: hey, foods on board. You don't have to eat as much. Maybe you're, you get a satiation signal. Your
[01:24:34] Dave Ricks: fat cells are told to absorb free fatty acids. Your liver kicks into gear to release glycogen and
[01:24:40] Dave Ricks: other things. So all that process is insulin is released to absorb the nutrients is kicked off by
[01:24:46] Dave Ricks: Anchortons. This is discovered in 1971 basically called the Anchorton Effect. It was a scientist who
[01:24:52] Dave Ricks: noticed that if I, if you feed someone an equivalent amount of pure sugar versus stick it in their
[01:24:58] Dave Ricks: veins or arteries, that their insulin levels, their metabolic processes rev up a lot faster.
[01:25:07] Interesting. It's called the Anchorton Effect. So that the local process of ingestion through the
[01:25:12] Dave Ricks: gut created this other thing. To that scientist and others, then isolated GLP one and another one
[01:25:18] Dave Ricks: called GIP actually isolated first. GIP and GLP make up tersepetide, which is separate out of
[01:25:22] Dave Ricks: Montreal. GLP makes up somaglutide, which is a sempic and was also exentitate. The problem with
[01:25:29] Dave Ricks: these hormones is our own versions have a half life of like five minutes. So they don't make very
[01:25:35] Dave Ricks: good drugs. If you take that protein and sequence it, people did this. You'd have to walk around with
[01:25:41] Dave Ricks: an infusion all day. The longer lasting action was the invention. Was the invention. And the first
[01:25:46] Dave Ricks: one that was before we really knew how to do protein engineering systematically, which we can do now,
[01:25:52] Dave Ricks: it was found in nature actually, in the famously, in the saliva of a heli-monster. So randomly
[01:25:58] some zoologists was testing the interesting properties of heli-monsters and noticed in
[01:26:04] Dave Ricks: profile all these proteins. And one of them was a memetic of human GLP one. And you know, did a
[01:26:08] Dave Ricks: literature search and found that. Another scientist found that paper and said that's interesting.
[01:26:13] Dave Ricks: Let's test that compound. A few different amino acids. And sure enough, it lasted about four
[01:26:18] Dave Ricks: hours, half life. So we can make it a twice a day injection. We made that into a medicine for
[01:26:23] Dave Ricks: diabetes. And on the cover of our anti-report in 2006, there's a woman who was one of the first patients
[01:26:29] Dave Ricks: with a quote says, my diabetes under control and my patient and my friends say I'm losing a little
[01:26:33] Dave Ricks: weight. That was 2006. So this overnight phenomenon of a memetic and everything else, old story.
[01:26:40] Dave Ricks: Why do we do it then? Well, we needed to get the dosages higher. And it turns out that this
[01:26:46] Dave Ricks: mechanism, which is common for a lot of hormones, has a threshold effect for efficacy, if you get
[01:26:52] Dave Ricks: above a certain level in your blood, and certainly to lose weight and really suppress appetite.
[01:26:56] Dave Ricks: You have to get that number up. But a peak to trough effect on side effects. So the up, down part
[01:27:03] Dave Ricks: causes the nausea. But the absolute level causes the effect. So how do you separate those things
[01:27:08] Dave Ricks: you need a flat long acting? It wasn't just convenience. So we made a once a week,
[01:27:13] Dave Ricks: GLP1 called Doologutide. We stuck the protein, the native sequence, to the backbone of basically
[01:27:19] Dave Ricks: a monoclonal antibody to extend its life. Now, who noticed it a similar thing that became
[01:27:24] Dave Ricks: semi-glutide in a Zempec. And then we put to the original two hormones together, GIPGLP,
[01:27:29] Dave Ricks: in Terzepetide, which is better than those in terms of weight loss in a one-seat control on
[01:27:34] Dave Ricks: everything else. And so with those tools, we're now exploring this terrain of what is linked
[01:27:40] Dave Ricks: to this pathway. I would say most of what we know and have proven is actually right on the obesity
[01:27:45] Dave Ricks: target. So if you think overweight has these untoward chronic overweight, untoward effects,
[01:27:52] Dave Ricks: our ancestors weren't chronically overweight, they were chronically starving. So we didn't
[01:27:56] Dave Ricks: worry about this, but now we worry about it, which are diabetes, type 2 diabetes, not the type 1
[01:28:01] Dave Ricks: form of children, cardiovascular health, pathosclerosis, stroke, MI, peripheral artery disease,
[01:28:09] Dave Ricks: kidney and liver diseases, fatty liver diseases. These are all sort of right on that target.
[01:28:15] Dave Ricks: A adjacent to that are other conditions we think are more unrelated, but actually have a big,
[01:28:20] Dave Ricks: not a perfect vendiogram, but close enough. One is like sleep apnea. So like 70% of those people
[01:28:26] Dave Ricks: sleep apnea actually have overweight or obesity. Polycytodorvarian disease is a young women get
[01:28:33] Dave Ricks: this and they don't ovulate, they can't have babies. So that's a fertility problem. So the circle
[01:28:39] Dave Ricks: widens. I think the two, so and there are more of those, which are being studied and looked at.
[01:28:44] Dave Ricks: The two interesting things, which are more incidental to the mechanism, but are definitely on the mechanism,
[01:28:50] Dave Ricks: are the brain things and the inflammation things. So if you look at people's blood values for cholesterol
[01:28:57] Dave Ricks: or glucose, over the course of three to six, eight months on the medicine, they fall pretty
[01:29:03] Dave Ricks: straight line with weight. But inflammation markers drop precipitously early. There's a marker
[01:29:10] Dave Ricks: called CRP, C-reactive protein, which is a marker for heart attack risk. In weeks that starts to
[01:29:15] Dave Ricks: drop really like 60, 70%. Why is that happening? It's dislocated from the drug effect, but probably the
[01:29:24] Dave Ricks: stress of effectively overeating, not by our modern definition, but by our ancestral definition,
[01:29:30] Dave Ricks: is causing inflammation and reducing that by having more fasting, basically.
[01:29:36] Dave Ricks: Lower calorie levels is reduces inflammation. We have a study reading out to her then in the
[01:29:41] Dave Ricks: C-rein chronic knee pain. It's going to work. That's a weird thing is what?
[01:29:47] Dave Ricks: Winning it. G-O-P-1 chronic. But if you follow that logic train, it actually makes good sense.
[01:29:52] Dave Ricks: There's also also inflammation causing the chronic pain.
[01:29:54] Dave Ricks: Inflammation plus, and we'll measure the inflammation in the joint. Plus, there's a mechanical
[01:29:59] Dave Ricks: loading with being overweight. If you carry around a backpack of 40 pounds extra every day,
[01:30:03] Dave Ricks: your knees will hurt more. So it's like green ones. Sorry. Yeah.
[01:30:06] Dave Ricks: Well, you're just saying that being over-asseted causes inflammation, which then causes all these
[01:30:13] SPEAKER_02: ostensibly unrelated downstream. Yeah, and you see this in chronic inflammatory diseases.
[01:30:19] Dave Ricks: So think of, well, the signature one is a skin disease called hydronatis super-tiva, a terrible
[01:30:25] Dave Ricks: name, but people get basically boils. It's almost completely correlated with excess body weight.
[01:30:33] And we have very expensive inflammatory drugs that have fancy targets and
[01:30:38] Dave Ricks: our monoclonal antibodies you inject and they cost $4,000 a month. Or you can just lose weight.
[01:30:43] Dave Ricks: And so people are using Zepound or drugging this and they don't have this condition anymore.
[01:30:48] Dave Ricks: Another one which has high correlation psoriasis actually. So we're doing a study with our psoriasis
[01:30:53] Dave Ricks: drug tults and Zepound. That will read out this fall. And I'm certain we'll show a boost in
[01:30:59] Dave Ricks: efficacy with the weight loss. And that is not because of the weight loss per se. It's the
[01:31:04] Dave Ricks: inflammatory effects. So it's pretty interesting. And there's a lot of these adult diseases that are
[01:31:08] Dave Ricks: inflammatory in their root. Of course, we'll study R.I. We have studies going in Crohn's and
[01:31:14] Dave Ricks: Calitis as well. Those are the brain stuff. Brains? Yeah. So clearly these drugs go to the brain
[01:31:20] Dave Ricks: and they signal the brain. I think the scientists say the major mechanism of that is actually not
[01:31:25] Dave Ricks: in the brain. But there's a part of your brain stem exposed to the blood system and your ganglion
[01:31:30] Dave Ricks: root. And it is detecting these hormones on purpose which are seity. But the signal being
[01:31:37] Dave Ricks: communicated to your nerve cells isn't as pristine as like stop eating pure sugar. Which is what
[01:31:43] Dave Ricks: G.O.P.1 should be saying or G.I.P which is more of a lipid mechanism. It's just saying you're
[01:31:48] Dave Ricks: satiated. That signal gets translated into down regulating dopamine and the desire for dopamine.
[01:31:56] Dave Ricks: And so cigarette smoking drops precipitous. Yeah. And opioid use to sort of will test alcohol
[01:32:03] Dave Ricks: drops precipitous. Yeah. Your cheeky point. Thanks. Yeah. A zero alcohol pipe. Shopping, gambling.
[01:32:11] Dave Ricks: These things have been observed. And it's totally these studies are being spun up and worked on.
[01:32:15] Dave Ricks: The category brain which may be related to this axis or there's another theory of
[01:32:21] which is sort of I don't know if people out here like two podcasts about hey I take microdoses,
[01:32:26] Dave Ricks: a zepound, and I feel like I can code longer or whatever right. They're back to your
[01:32:32] Dave Ricks: faces of experimental acting your body. I'm sure there are people in Silicon Valley experimenting
[01:32:37] SPEAKER_01: abundantly with this. There is a theory of this that actually the glucose lowering mechanism
[01:32:42] Dave Ricks: in your brain only eats glucose. It doesn't eat any other substance as you need tissue that way.
[01:32:47] Dave Ricks: Of having ketonic kind of low glucose chronically actually improves brain acuity. And so people
[01:32:57] Dave Ricks: are probably experiencing this. They might be lean already and taking a GOP1 and getting leaner.
[01:33:02] Dave Ricks: Right. But they're actually the brain, they feel the brain functioning in a sharper way.
[01:33:07] There's an interesting study that Novonortis is doing with their oral form of some of
[01:33:11] Dave Ricks: glutide that will read out pretty soon in patients who have early dementia. That may work and it
[01:33:18] Dave Ricks: may work for the same reason. It may also work because you reduce strokes which is back to the
[01:33:22] Dave Ricks: cardiovascular axis. But yeah, I think we've stumbled upon here kind of a broad footprint,
[01:33:29] a broad impact zone of what these types of medicines can do and there's many more coming.
[01:33:35] Dave Ricks: So neurodegenerative disease, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, cardiovascular disease,
[01:33:40] SPEAKER_01: psoriasis, psoriasis, exactly all the diseases. What fraction of the population,
[01:33:46] SPEAKER_01: let's say the population over 35 will be on a GOP1 in 15 years.
[01:33:53] Well, today in the US we probably have 10 million people, maybe 12. We include the compounded
[01:33:59] Dave Ricks: market, the non-approved, the mass-produced. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:34:05] Dave Ricks: The official company is like, exactly. Yeah. But it's really a fraction of the adult population.
[01:34:11] Dave Ricks: And even if you just take obesity, it should be 100 million. We have a long, long way to go.
[01:34:15] Dave Ricks: And I think we talked at the beginning of the conversation about coverage. That's of course
[01:34:19] both a real cost burden on people but also kind of an endorsement thing. And physicians are busy
[01:34:25] Dave Ricks: and don't have time to write all the forms to get it covered. So this, I mean the popularity of
[01:34:30] Dave Ricks: the direct channel where people with some means, I mean $500 a month is a big ask, it's car payment.
[01:34:35] Dave Ricks: But a fair swath of the US can afford that. It is actually the number one prescribed form
[01:34:42] Dave Ricks: of these medications is Zepbound Self-Buy. We sell more than that that are insured business.
[01:34:48] Dave Ricks: A new patient starts and more than all of we go. That's very interesting. Yeah. So that's why I was
[01:34:53] Dave Ricks: back. The concept of like, okay, for preventative, maybe it should be on us. And how do we just make
[01:34:58] Dave Ricks: that cost effective and easier? And certainly there's a cost of your time and shopping online
[01:35:05] Dave Ricks: at telehealth appointment is much more convenient. So the number has to go way up. The oral project
[01:35:10] Dave Ricks: I mentioned is a key part of that because we've literally already made billions of doses.
[01:35:16] And we are capacity constrained in some sense on the injectable systems. Unfortunately,
[01:35:20] Dave Ricks: there's not a good learning curve left. We've sort of built the scaled plants. We just have to
[01:35:26] Dave Ricks: build more of them. We built six or seven of these mega plants that produce hundreds of millions of
[01:35:33] Dave Ricks: these injection systems. And we're only treating 10 or 12 million Americans maybe 20, 30 globally.
[01:35:40] Dave Ricks: So to get to have a billion people globally, that's not the path. We can't keep stamping out these.
[01:35:46] Dave Ricks: It'll take too long. The oralists have to work. They have to be approved. They're not going to be
[01:35:49] Dave Ricks: as good as these multi-acting injectable hormones. But we can probably stratify people if you need to
[01:35:55] Dave Ricks: lose a lot of weight. Okay, start there and maintenance with the oral is going to be a key segment.
[01:35:59] Dave Ricks: I would guess by the time we go generic, it will be a large proportion of adults.
[01:36:05] Dave Ricks: Staten's got to 40 million people branded. It's a little more than that now. It has to be
[01:36:09] Dave Ricks: north than that. Interesting that all the growth in statins happened even while it was brand new.
[01:36:14] SPEAKER_02: You know, you'd expect a big bump after it went generic. Well, you asked about consumer advertising.
[01:36:18] Dave Ricks: And I think actually, people hate the commercial part of our business. I have to admit,
[01:36:22] Dave Ricks: like sometimes I dislike it. When I'm, I'd never watch TV, except when I'm traveling,
[01:36:27] Dave Ricks: and I'll flip on CNBC in the morning while I'm getting ready, especially on the west coast,
[01:36:31] Dave Ricks: because I'm up at like six or five thirty. I'm like, are you kidding me? How many ads are we running
[01:36:37] Dave Ricks: and everyone else? And often it's the same drug class like this. This cannot be productive.
[01:36:42] Dave Ricks: I have to say 70% of our spend now is not on linear TV. So mostly advertising is more served up
[01:36:49] Dave Ricks: in your search sequence. And increasingly we're interested in like generative AI optimization.
[01:36:56] Dave Ricks: But still you do it. Why do you do it? Because it works. Like it's still a productive spend.
[01:37:03] Dave Ricks: But also promotion to physicians, which consumers don't see is a big part of what we do.
[01:37:08] And we do studies and we disseminate them and we run education programs,
[01:37:12] Dave Ricks: mostly if left to their own. And there's been studies on this of medical inventions that are not
[01:37:17] Dave Ricks: promoted. Hey, they won't actually be adopted. It's about a 16 year path to full adoption.
[01:37:22] Dave Ricks: With a medicine promoted, it's half that. We have an internal goal to half that again,
[01:37:26] Dave Ricks: to get to four years to full whatever it is, get to it on a global scale. I think it's ambitious,
[01:37:32] Dave Ricks: but service appropriate. A lens presumably help here. Could be. Yeah. If we can get through the
[01:37:39] Dave Ricks: problem of convoluting the facts, you need to have education seminars for the
[01:37:44] SPEAKER_01: the other. If they weren't so trained on Reddit, right? It might be a little better. Let's train
[01:37:48] SPEAKER_01: them on the New England Journal medicine. Okay, you've mentioned Reddit. And you just
[01:37:53] SPEAKER_01: mentioned the microdosing of Tzvezepadide in Silicon Valley. Yeah. Not recommending, not indicated.
[01:37:59] Dave Ricks: I understand. Yes. I do not ask your position. But my understanding is the avant-garde Silicon
[01:38:07] SPEAKER_01: Valley denizens, you know, the frontier is really in Chinese peptides. Yeah, frightening. So
[01:38:14] Dave Ricks: here we're getting into the compounding. So, of course, there's probably always been a
[01:38:18] Dave Ricks: segment of society that was comfortable using unapproved things. We have a large supplement
[01:38:25] Dave Ricks: industry in this country that has some proximity to this maha thing, by the way.
[01:38:32] Most supplements have no evidence that they're going to help you. I take a multivitamin,
[01:38:37] Dave Ricks: but I really don't believe in anything else. And I think if you're eating correctly,
[01:38:43] you should be getting better nutrition through your food than through supplements anyway.
[01:38:47] Dave Ricks: And it's better than the price at least. You may have to buy more expensive food.
[01:38:53] Dave Ricks: But that same tranche or the edge of that has gone to this. What is a Chinese peptide? It's an
[01:38:57] Dave Ricks: unapproved medicine that's never been tested in man and is made in a Chinese lab. It might be what
[01:39:03] Dave Ricks: you say. This is basically the same source for the Tzvezepadide compounded that people get.
[01:39:10] People buy that from things that look like legitimate companies, some are publicly traded.
[01:39:16] That formulate them and are violating our patents. And maybe under FDA supervision or not
[01:39:22] Dave Ricks: these plants, most not. I know of one that's been inspected. It had a nasty, what we call
[01:39:28] Dave Ricks: 483 with lots of inspection findings. I certainly wouldn't do that, but of course, I run a company that
[01:39:33] Dave Ricks: does this legitimately. My problem with those companies is less about trying to, I like the fact
[01:39:40] Dave Ricks: that people could shortcut the pain in the butt of the healthcare system and go direct and we see
[01:39:45] Dave Ricks: the phenomena of what the internet's done to commerce could apply to health. I think that's
[01:39:49] Dave Ricks: not a good thing. What I don't like is they're stealing my IP. Partly, people got in this business.
[01:39:55] The rule that guides this, actually, they technically should not be doing some do. The big ones don't,
[01:40:01] Dave Ricks: they say, we're not following that rule, following a different rule, which is customization.
[01:40:05] All these patients who need Tzvezepadide, even though you can buy six different dosage forms,
[01:40:10] Dave Ricks: because they need a dose in between these six. Or, oh, the efficacy is boosted by vitamin X, Y, Z.
[01:40:18] By the way, we recently sent to the FDA studies of these vitamin combinations that show they
[01:40:22] Dave Ricks: actually augment the peptide. So they're making a new drug never approved. Not a good idea. And then
[01:40:29] Dave Ricks: you have the folks you're talking about who are served by an industry started when I think steroids
[01:40:36] Dave Ricks: became a big deal and the bodybuilding craze. They're all based in like Long Beach.
[01:40:43] Dave Ricks: And it's like Heptides USA, which is the opposite of what it is, right? It's a Chinese peptides.
[01:40:49] Dave Ricks: And they'll sell things to you that say not for human use. Literally. That's how they protect
[01:40:52] Dave Ricks: themselves legally. And you're injecting your putting saline in and you're putting this white powder
[01:40:57] Dave Ricks: in your body. It says not for human use. Really a terrible idea. I know some people find success
[01:41:02] Dave Ricks: at some point through that process, you would suggest there are several clues that are going to advise it.
[01:41:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And it's not going to end well. And there are people who've had chronic kidney failure and
[01:41:11] Dave Ricks: liver, permanent liver damage. And I wouldn't do it. For the difference between that and today,
[01:41:18] Dave Ricks: buying a real thing for $500 seems like a relatively large risk for the cost savings we're achieving.
[01:41:23] Dave Ricks: And I'm telling you today, we're going to bring these prices down. They're going to,
[01:41:26] Dave Ricks: either through insurance coverage, which is expanding every day or just through competition.
[01:41:31] And your direct stuff, I mean, we've talked about it a little bit twice. You're here in South
[01:41:34] SPEAKER_02: San Francisco, the headquarters of not only the place of genetic, but also payments innovation.
[01:41:40] SPEAKER_02: Yes. We're working together on the E-Li-Direct stuff. You can talk a bit about that.
[01:41:46] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So this, I mean, talking about accident and experiments. So this came out back to the insulin
[01:41:50] Dave Ricks: story. I was, the person who was running our US business, commercial business, directly retired.
[01:41:56] Dave Ricks: And I didn't have a suitable candidate internally. So I thought it would be a good idea to go back
[01:41:59] Dave Ricks: to that job I used to do and be the CEO at the same time. The team, this is, this is for inspiring.
[01:42:04] SPEAKER_01: The team in the US didn't find this inspiring or a good idea. But I was, you know, kind of,
[01:42:10] Dave Ricks: the business was changing and the rise of the consumer, communication on digital channels.
[01:42:16] Dave Ricks: We were pretty old school at that time and I wanted to modernize it. And so I dug in. And one of the
[01:42:21] Dave Ricks: ideas that came out of that was, hey, why don't we stand up our own pharmacy and sell directly to
[01:42:26] Dave Ricks: patients? And then people were like, well, first of all, the existing pharmacies and there's only
[01:42:30] Dave Ricks: like three of them will hate us. And so that seems like a bad idea. And secondly, we know nothing
[01:42:36] Dave Ricks: about running a pharmacy. So that we're going to make mistakes in her people. So we kind of parked it.
[01:42:42] A few months later though, we were in this process I described in long form earlier, but in short
[01:42:49] Dave Ricks: form of like de-escalating this insulin bubble and getting to sort of true pricing being the market.
[01:42:55] And one of the fights we were having was with a large PBM company that also owns a pharmacy chain.
[01:43:01] Dave Ricks: And we were worried that they actually, a different pharmacy chain actually threatened not to
[01:43:06] Dave Ricks: carry our low price insulin because they couldn't make enough money on it. So I just looked at the
[01:43:11] Dave Ricks: thing and said, this is what this was for. This idea that's been on the shelf, we cannot be
[01:43:14] beholden to this. We have to have a route to market ourselves, which we had not had since the
[01:43:20] Dave Ricks: company was founded as a pharmacy, actually a free standing pharmacy before any regulation.
[01:43:25] Dave Ricks: So it was scary, but we cobbled it together with partners and now we do more of it ourselves.
[01:43:30] Dave Ricks: And the first idea was like, make sure people who need insulin to survive can get it at the lowest
[01:43:34] Dave Ricks: price. We sold a little bit, but not much. Then we launched our migraine medicine, which was
[01:43:39] Dave Ricks: having trouble getting insurance coverage. So a little bit more. Then we launched Zeppown and we
[01:43:43] Dave Ricks: said, ah, this feels like the killer app for a direct-to-patient experience because the diagnosis
[01:43:48] Dave Ricks: step is dead easy. Everybody knows everyone has the biomarker tool in their bathroom. It's called
[01:43:53] Dave Ricks: the scale. They can know if the drug is working and we can offer telehealth post pandemic at scale.
[01:43:59] Dave Ricks: It was out there to a third party to advise patients if that was the right choice or if the
[01:44:03] Dave Ricks: noble product was right choice or nothing. And so we put that together and boom, this thing really
[01:44:08] Dave Ricks: grew pretty quickly. Today will analyze, you know, in the billions of dollars. I think it's the
[01:44:16] Dave Ricks: largest prescription platform online in terms of revenue. We run it on strike, I think.
[01:44:22] Dave Ricks: And going north from here. I have an interesting example of how across so many different sectors and,
[01:44:29] SPEAKER_01: you know, across every company scale and stage, there is this interesting way in which all
[01:44:36] SPEAKER_01: these ostensibly different models and different businesses are discovering. They're going
[01:44:41] SPEAKER_01: across. They're discovering the value of having a direct relationship with the end customer.
[01:44:46] SPEAKER_01: And of course, up on the board of Adobe Software Company, which is this is now in the final stage
[01:44:51] Dave Ricks: of evolution in the software industry. But I found it fascinating when I first arrived that 90%
[01:44:56] Dave Ricks: of the revenue was off a website that they ran. I thought that was great. What? This is a great
[01:45:02] Dave Ricks: business. A very low cost business. Very low cost route to market. We're very in favor of
[01:45:06] Dave Ricks: solving stuff in websites. Yeah, exactly. I'm sure you are. You had this insight even before me.
[01:45:11] Dave Ricks: And so, yeah, that, you know, that leap is happening. Now, healthcare has been a hard problem for tech,
[01:45:16] Dave Ricks: I think, which is interesting because you have all this bricks and mortar,
[01:45:20] Dave Ricks: mess. You have a lot of state level insurance regulation. You think Fintech would have
[01:45:24] Dave Ricks: gone after this a lot sooner because it's 20% of the financial economy in the country.
[01:45:28] Dave Ricks: Well, I think this podcast makes clear that there are nuances to this actor.
[01:45:32] Dave Ricks: Exactly. I guess so, yeah. But, you know, I think people with longer money are starting to do it.
[01:45:39] Dave Ricks: We actually ourselves just moved our PBM from a traditional one to this sort of new tech,
[01:45:45] Dave Ricks: Fintechi PBM. And we're switching all our lives. And we want more transparency, better data reporting.
[01:45:51] Dave Ricks: And the interoperability problem that is why PBMs rose, which was that you had a card,
[01:45:56] Dave Ricks: like a physical card that had your insurance number on it in 1992. And you went into a pharmacy
[01:46:01] Dave Ricks: in Phoenix versus one in LA and you couldn't get your prescription filled. They solved that problem
[01:46:05] Dave Ricks: with old tech. That's a pretty easy problem to solve these days with technology. But what they built
[01:46:11] Dave Ricks: on the back of that was a system of negotiating and, and capture rent taking that's not so
[01:46:18] Dave Ricks: popular anymore. And we can discerning and mediate them easily.
[01:46:22] We've been having this conversation for quite some time and we haven't asked you
[01:46:26] SPEAKER_01: with one beer. We can rectify that. But we haven't asked you, and we were one of the first
[01:46:33] SPEAKER_01: questions that we ought to have asked you, which is Eli Lilly is the largest farmer company in the
[01:46:38] SPEAKER_01: world. Why? Well, in simple terms, we are kind of a rare situation right now in that our growth
[01:46:49] Dave Ricks: rate is high and our profitability is expanding. And we are in an early encycl of this invention.
[01:46:56] Dave Ricks: I think Wall Street believes to this being the G.O.P. ones, which is driving probably 80% of the
[01:47:00] Dave Ricks: economic value of the company. Our market cap is about... Using Eli Lilly is a G.O.P. one company
[01:47:06] SPEAKER_01: with a side card. That's probably trading like other, okay. So in our sector today, let's
[01:47:14] Dave Ricks: pick a company like Bristol Myers or Pfizer. These are big companies with revenues not so
[01:47:19] Dave Ricks: different from ours. And we compete with them in these other spaces. Their market cap is
[01:47:24] Dave Ricks: being one, two hundred billion dollars. We're trading about 800. And that difference is the G.O.P.
[01:47:30] Dave Ricks: one, phenomena. I think Wall Street also believes that our R&D productivity has been higher.
[01:47:37] So every dollar we put through the income statement for R&D or through an acquisition,
[01:47:41] Dave Ricks: we get a little bit of a premium, a management premium on. I think most of the sector is treated
[01:47:46] Dave Ricks: the opposite way, which is that that's actually probably going to destroy value in some way.
[01:47:53] And I think the other thing that's out there is this belief that perhaps, for those that are
[01:48:00] Dave Ricks: really long as talk, our belief that perhaps this cycle could be different. This cycle is starting with
[01:48:06] Dave Ricks: G.O.P. ones, but that you could create back to the route to market and the consumer, much more
[01:48:11] Dave Ricks: of a self-pay branded business that has staying power beyond the patent cycle of franchise. Thank
[01:48:20] Dave Ricks: you. And I think so far, the evidence is pointing that way. How we fully evolve to a mature version
[01:48:26] Dave Ricks: that know, have we created like an ecosystem around ourselves like Apple has done that, no, no.
[01:48:31] Dave Ricks: Those are all opportunities for us, but you can kind of see them. And self-care is an innate
[01:48:36] Dave Ricks: desire, and I don't think the payment system is going to fully cover all this, but a lot of people
[01:48:41] Dave Ricks: are willing to pay, and it's not just the US, it's a global phenomenon. You said G.O.P.s are one of
[01:48:46] SPEAKER_02: the biggest drivers of the business. Ely-ly is growing at about 30% right now, revenues. 40
[01:48:52] SPEAKER_02: year to date. Oh my god. Well, Bernie's on. Yeah, actually, here's a fun fact. There's three
[01:48:57] Dave Ricks: scaled large cap companies that have a rule of 80. Can you name them?
[01:49:05] A striped one pretty well, but Nvidia must be. Nvidia is the highest. Yeah. They're over 90.
[01:49:10] Dave Ricks: Yeah. Margin plus growth. Quarantine? Not this thing, it's your top
[01:49:16] SPEAKER_02: to the CEO of Ely-ly, please. So top 100 small caps out here. Yeah.
[01:49:22] Yeah. So it's based quite close to where we're sitting.
[01:49:24] Dave Ricks: Can I take a broad calm? Of course. Yeah. Of course.
[01:49:29] Dave Ricks: So the hardware guys in AI are killing it, but I think what's interesting to me, they're
[01:49:33] Dave Ricks: trading at multiples above ours. There's a belief that their cycle is somehow longer than ours.
[01:49:38] And I think the US patent has late 30s, or four-gapron, the oral beyond that.
[01:49:44] Dave Ricks: So, yeah, that's my pitch to investors, but we're in that club as well.
[01:49:49] Dave Ricks: Will we say that forever? Obviously no, but I think that's one of the reasons we're worth.
[01:49:54] Dave Ricks: Well, I was going to ask some questions about that. So first off, Novo is growing in the teens,
[01:49:58] SPEAKER_02: just for two companies with GLP offerings that are working. Are those growth rates so different?
[01:50:03] We're taking most of the growth in the market. Okay, so just your product's working better.
[01:50:08] SPEAKER_02: Right now in the US, across all forms of GLP1, a new patient capture, we're basically 70, 75% right now.
[01:50:17] Dave Ricks: So almost, almost three to one. And then if you, it's a high carryover business,
[01:50:23] Dave Ricks: yeah, we're, I think we're 60, 40 on the total. And so we're just getting mostly growth.
[01:50:29] What would you guess, Elyla Lise P is?
[01:50:32] Forward P? I was using trailing, but 15?
[01:50:39] 5-0. Oh my god. So what I was going to ask is, you know, we're talking here about
[01:50:45] SPEAKER_02: the sectors like 12. So yeah. Exactly. Yeah, you're correct.
[01:50:48] SPEAKER_02: Like, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're a very good guy.
[01:50:51] SPEAKER_02: I was thinking high-end of the sector. Your, your priors were good. Yeah.
[01:50:54] SPEAKER_02: And because that is correct for the rest of the, but where I was going with this is,
[01:50:57] SPEAKER_02: if you're to listen to this podcast, I think you may be come away thinking, wow,
[01:51:01] SPEAKER_02: pharma is hard. Like, good God. You know, there's so many things and you know, things roll off
[01:51:04] SPEAKER_02: patent or maybe the Chinese competitors and things like that. So, so what is it that investors
[01:51:10] SPEAKER_02: have confidence in? Well, I think the track record of success, we've been on a growth curve
[01:51:15] Dave Ricks: for 12 years or so. It's certainly gone a little more hyperbolic lately, but I think that builds
[01:51:21] Dave Ricks: confidence. I would hope some management piece, but also, you know, the, the ability to predict
[01:51:30] where to move. And I think if you say, okay, what's your recipe? It's an R&D business.
[01:51:36] The, everything else is around the edges. So, you have to create something better for people
[01:51:41] Dave Ricks: that improves their health. If you can do that, you're going to win.
[01:51:44] Dave Ricks: Policy, this and that, the commercial strategies. That's the 20. The 80 is this. And I think we do
[01:51:49] three things better than others. One, we talked about already, which is cycle time. It's a basic
[01:51:54] Dave Ricks: concept. But if you can make software faster than someone else, you're going to win. And the same
[01:51:59] Dave Ricks: in the drug business. The second is prediction of where to attack the investment. And allocating a
[01:52:07] Dave Ricks: meaningful part to ideas that may not be obvious today, but actually are big problems without markets.
[01:52:15] And we're drawn to those. That is the third box preexisting markets. Yeah, I mean, there's
[01:52:21] Dave Ricks: illnesses. But they're not medicines. And I think a lot of companies don't work that way. They
[01:52:27] look at, okay, where's their payment? Where can I recoup my investment versus where's their problem?
[01:52:33] Dave Ricks: Maybe your situation. Maybe your audience.
[01:52:35] Dave Ricks: Lydia talks about how he loves zero dollar markets. And you're describing some of the same
[01:52:40] SPEAKER_01: activities. Zero blue ocean things that are, you know, there's no limit to human disease. And
[01:52:44] Dave Ricks: actually, the longer we help people live, the more disease they'll be. So in a way, it's a like AI
[01:52:49] Dave Ricks: in that way, where it's like AI begets more AI. It's just this, this growing machine.
[01:52:54] Dave Ricks: And then I think discipline of the allocation between the types of R&D that are
[01:53:00] Dave Ricks: extending the franchise, these moonshots we just talked about that could really actually create a
[01:53:05] Dave Ricks: new G.O.P.1 like category. You know, we're doing the study now that I think it'll be quite interesting
[01:53:10] Dave Ricks: that it's going to potentially show you can slow Alzheimer's before it starts. That's the kind
[01:53:15] Dave Ricks: of thing that could be a mega market. And those have to not just help a lot of people, but they
[01:53:20] Dave Ricks: have to save a lot of money for healthcare systems in order to generate, I think, shared value.
[01:53:26] Dave Ricks: And then you have to do the discipline around the edges of, you know, the next clinical trial
[01:53:31] Dave Ricks: for a cancer drug that's already working. I think being multimodal in that and really kind of
[01:53:37] balancing your bets has been a key for our success. Capital allocation, I guess, in a sense.
[01:53:42] When people are debating drug pricing and they debated a lot, obviously the
[01:53:50] SPEAKER_01: argument made by people in the pharma industry, which to be clear, I think both of us
[01:53:55] SPEAKER_01: believe has a lot of legitimacy, is well, if the returns aren't favorable, we're not going to
[01:54:00] SPEAKER_01: pursue the investments. You'll never know. Exactly. Yeah, sends society ones more drugs and
[01:54:07] SPEAKER_01: not fewer drugs and there are many diseases that have not been cured, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:54:11] SPEAKER_01: And we've, of course, discussed these dynamics extensively here just now. In as much as
[01:54:16] SPEAKER_01: GLP ones represent this enormous advancement and improvement in Elylilis, just fundamental
[01:54:23] SPEAKER_01: financials. I mean, it's economically equivalent to a 2x, 3x, 4x increase in the realized drug price
[01:54:32] SPEAKER_01: of every drug across the board. Does that mean that people should now expect Elylilis to be
[01:54:39] SPEAKER_01: far more able to fund broad-based drug or indeed than it was in the past, such a their estimate
[01:54:45] SPEAKER_01: for the prospective drug development and, you know, a bounties of drug discovery over the next
[01:54:51] SPEAKER_01: 10, 20, 30 years should be much larger than the pre-GLP one world. I think so, although we have
[01:54:59] Dave Ricks: to prove we can. So we're going to try. I have a belief that if you're not generating, to generate
[01:55:06] Dave Ricks: double digit growth in the sector, you need to invest at 20 to 25 percent of sales in R&D.
[01:55:10] Dave Ricks: That's sort of a good, a positive return R&D stack. And you plan to get that. We are doing
[01:55:16] Dave Ricks: that as revenue. Yes. And this year we'll sell 60 some on billion. So you can tell you
[01:55:22] Dave Ricks: get to the 14 billion and next year that'll grow by double digits. And so, but we should try.
[01:55:28] Dave Ricks: If revenue goes to 120, you know, I would try to spend 20 percent of that, which would then
[01:55:33] Dave Ricks: approximate the NIH. And I think that's a frightening thing because well, how many ideas are out there?
[01:55:40] So I think, of course, we should do more of what we're good at. We should be bounded by our own
[01:55:45] Dave Ricks: capabilities. And we're not, we don't know everything about every disease. We don't know everything
[01:55:50] Dave Ricks: about heavy modality. But for the disease we know the modality, we can fund more and pursue a healthy
[01:55:56] Dave Ricks: portion of these bigger bets on zero, zero value markets. We can expand the franchise. We can
[01:56:03] Dave Ricks: do the incremental things we have to do at scale and do them earlier, actually. I think that's
[01:56:07] Dave Ricks: quite an important thing. Often we do serial clinical trials. And by the end of the product
[01:56:12] Dave Ricks: life, so you get the final indication, we're trying to stack them all into the beginning. So
[01:56:16] Dave Ricks: that's expensive, but we're in a position to do that. It's not risky, actually. So you're seeing
[01:56:20] Dave Ricks: anyone who's on this, you know, who's teatring on the brink of purchasing a GLP one, especially in
[01:56:26] SPEAKER_01: a self-pay motor or something like that. And they worry maybe it's self-indulgent to do so, you know,
[01:56:31] SPEAKER_01: they just go to the gym or exercise willpower. They're paying for medicine. I was going to say,
[01:56:35] Dave Ricks: you're saying the purchase of this GLP one is also a kind of subsidy for cancer.
[01:56:40] SPEAKER_01: For cancer R&D. And I was just to add on the R&D, the other thing we're doing at some scale is
[01:56:44] Dave Ricks: actually trying to create a ecosystem around us of invention that we can aid in a real way, not
[01:56:50] Dave Ricks: just own part of it. We have lots of deployed corporate venture, but we built these things called
[01:56:56] Dave Ricks: catalyzed 360 or the gateway labs here in South San Francisco, actually, where we host
[01:57:02] Dave Ricks: scale-ups, not startups. And by host, I mean, we offer our services. So if rather than hire some
[01:57:08] Dave Ricks: consultant who retired five years ago to help you with a particular problem, we'll give you someone
[01:57:12] Dave Ricks: working on it right now. And so it's sort of a loosely coupled model. Without buying them,
[01:57:19] we're often the entrepreneurs leave, we cultivate them, and then maybe buy them if they're good.
[01:57:24] Dave Ricks: You have to apply to get in. So it's a competitive process. We have, I think, seven or eight of these
[01:57:28] Dave Ricks: now around the country and even two in China, building one in London. And we'll create a virtual
[01:57:34] Dave Ricks: version of this in that tune lab tool, that AI tool I talked about earlier is embedded in that as well.
[01:57:39] Dave Ricks: So that's another way we can spend money in R&D with other people and kind of use other brains
[01:57:45] Dave Ricks: to develop what we're doing. But I have to caveat, this may not work, actually. Right, there could be
[01:57:52] Dave Ricks: a frontier in what's possible and we found it. And beyond that, it's just waste. I don't rule that
[01:57:59] Dave Ricks: out. And I think it's important caveat. We'll know those signals in the next couple of years,
[01:58:04] Dave Ricks: because our scale is getting to be bigger than anyone's ever done. Most those experiments that
[01:58:08] Dave Ricks: have been run ended badly. People mostly bought other companies at a too high a price. And then the
[01:58:15] Dave Ricks: drug didn't work out. We're not doing that. But it'll be interesting to see. And then, you know,
[01:58:21] Dave Ricks: if we quit, we'll turn into like an apple. We'll just start buying back massive amounts of
[01:58:26] Dave Ricks: shares and we turn cash to shareholders who invested to create this surplus. But it's important
[01:58:31] Dave Ricks: what you're saying about people buying is that a quarter of every dollar you spend is going to a
[01:58:37] Dave Ricks: research lab or a clinical trial. For a medicine you might not need or for someone you don't know.
[01:58:43] Dave Ricks: But that's the system by which we create new medicines. And we'll try to use that wisely. I don't
[01:58:48] Dave Ricks: take that responsibility lightly. That's someone's money. But maybe they'll have Alzheimer's some day
[01:58:54] Dave Ricks: and we'll have a solution for that or maybe someone they know. But that's the virtuous circle we try to
[01:58:59] Dave Ricks: drive. Is it meaningful to talk about what fraction of R&D is towards specific treatments? Is
[01:59:04] SPEAKER_02: like focused vertical R&D versus I assume you do a lot of horizontal R&D. Yeah, platforms. Yeah,
[01:59:10] SPEAKER_02: exactly. Platforms. Because presumably it's even harder to reason about the platforms and the payoffs
[01:59:14] SPEAKER_02: there. Well there that's you need some scale. There's a lot of platform companies that get funded
[01:59:18] Dave Ricks: that are biotech. Yeah, we should. Yeah. And they are usually exploring a new platform that's
[01:59:24] Dave Ricks: quite novel. That's important work they do and often we'll partner with them early. We'll try to
[01:59:30] develop that capability ourselves. Basically in our business there's two kinds of questions on
[01:59:35] Dave Ricks: early pays R&D. One of them is this. Is there a new platform that can unlock targets we already know
[01:59:40] Dave Ricks: about in new ways or in better ways that create a whole field of drugs? If you think of genetic
[01:59:47] like that was a company that exploded based on monocle antibody technology by tricking cells to
[01:59:51] Dave Ricks: make a human antibody that's all disease 30 year run of spectacular new medicines or gilead
[01:59:59] Dave Ricks: sciences nearby which really started on this idea of verology a new verology chemistry and small
[02:00:04] Dave Ricks: molecules. So we want to be there at the early stages because it is like a catching a wave thing.
[02:00:11] Dave Ricks: If you're late you miss it all and so that's a kind of investing we do and that's a more scaled
[02:00:16] Dave Ricks: project and then the other kind is like picking targets and looking in the broad space of biologic
[02:00:23] Dave Ricks: discovery and say okay of the thousand things uncovered this year these 15 we think could be highly
[02:00:29] Dave Ricks: relevant and we're going to put a team around those this isn't the skunk works kind of allowable
[02:00:36] Dave Ricks: deviation whatever I said earlier but it's a purposeful thing to say let's drug hunt here.
[02:00:42] Dave Ricks: Let's use the tools we have and assault them those targets with multiple ones of those tools and
[02:00:47] Dave Ricks: see if we can get a drug out of it and sometimes we've actually come out with like a small molecule
[02:00:52] and an antibody and an SI RNA like like we talked about LPL a little earlier that was the case
[02:00:56] Dave Ricks: there we discarded the antibody there is one that's been developed and we went after the small
[02:01:01] Dave Ricks: molecule and the SI RNA they're both in phase three and so that was a case of very purposeful find a
[02:01:06] Dave Ricks: target attack the target get get a medicine to market so it's both yeah and we need to hedge it
[02:01:13] Dave Ricks: that way I think and then of course we watch the outside and sometimes we miss those two signals
[02:01:19] Dave Ricks: and we end up buying companies later in their cycle and saying hey we can add value through clinical
[02:01:23] Dave Ricks: trials or manufacturing scale or what else last question and
[02:01:28] Elydeley is more than 100 years old and 150 in May oh wow okay so coming up on your
[02:01:33] SPEAKER_02: 150th birthday and I noticed that often very tenured successful companies are quite serious about
[02:01:44] SPEAKER_02: and good at internal succession planning I think about you know world at shell or you know
[02:01:48] SPEAKER_02: companies like that and and Elydeley you joined in what year 1996 right you joined in 1996
[02:01:56] SPEAKER_02: and not as a hired CEO no that was a BD M&A exactly and you were rotated across you know the business
[02:02:03] SPEAKER_02: you run China you run the US business exactly all these kind of roles what do you think
[02:02:08] SPEAKER_02: striped Silicon Valley companies should learn from Elydeley and you know companies like Elydeley
[02:02:15] SPEAKER_02: that's where you have experienced about talent pounding and talented often yeah fabulous question
[02:02:19] Dave Ricks: I do notice differences at least on the board I'm on and observing other companies
[02:02:25] Dave Ricks: some of that might be just the clock speed of the industry and the technology
[02:02:29] Dave Ricks: and some of it might be the newness of companies because if you haven't really seen the cycles play out
[02:02:35] hard to kind of see the value you got a problem solve it you know work work on the next thing
[02:02:40] Dave Ricks: but probably even in your company which has been around long enough now I'm sure you have people who
[02:02:44] Dave Ricks: are you know single digit hires you know first few people who've really been excellent and what
[02:02:51] Dave Ricks: they're doing now is nothing like what they started doing and you should examine like what are those
[02:02:55] Dave Ricks: why was it the experience path they took was it innate traits they have combination of those things
[02:03:02] you know we've had 150 years of that and I'm the 11th CEO of the company that's one less than
[02:03:09] Dave Ricks: the POPES in that period of time so it was a special honor actually and it's not a lifetime
[02:03:16] Dave Ricks: appointment might be fired any day but the first four were family members and then we've had a lot
[02:03:22] Dave Ricks: of long running successful and only one external really yeah and I think that's part of the success
[02:03:31] Dave Ricks: of the company is that in scaled companies we've scaled for a while you know there's not one
[02:03:36] Dave Ricks: person cannot possibly really lead the whole thing yeah you have to know the role you have to play
[02:03:42] Dave Ricks: and you have to have others around you that can do it by creating that environment giving up
[02:03:47] Dave Ricks: some of that you actually grow people and you grow people in a special way a way that they know how
[02:03:54] Dave Ricks: to operate in the unspoken operating system called culture and so they're more effective more
[02:04:00] Dave Ricks: quickly in new roles and they just know the domain and there's so much to know they know the domain
[02:04:05] Dave Ricks: yeah they also know the human domain of how to solve problems without committees and like one of my
[02:04:11] Dave Ricks: things now is we grow so fast it's like keep head count flat and that's makes me very unpopular
[02:04:19] Dave Ricks: because people are like what like how do I get this work done we are growing head count and
[02:04:23] Dave Ricks: manufacturing that's a unit operation are you growing an R&D as you grow the spend slightly but
[02:04:28] Dave Ricks: so we're growing R&D high teams early low 20s we're growing head count R&D single digits
[02:04:34] Dave Ricks: so where does the money go so the money goes to projects yeah and sorry I believe in paying people
[02:04:41] Dave Ricks: yeah yeah so the salary they're salary growth but clinical trials new equipment new laboratories
[02:04:47] Dave Ricks: super computers from Nvidia that's expensive so we're really trying to keep that goodness that can
[02:04:54] Dave Ricks: come from having most of the succession internal what I noticed when I took over there was maybe
[02:05:00] Dave Ricks: that took over too much there is a balance I have tried to bring in at the leadership level and
[02:05:06] Dave Ricks: other ranks compete jobs externally and bring in outside voices that are the minority voice
[02:05:13] and have to have those innate traits and kind of a culture fit that can work but it stimulates you
[02:05:20] Dave Ricks: in ways that sometimes like yeah that felt a little uncomfortable because they came out at a
[02:05:24] Dave Ricks: different way or set it away that doesn't is to connect with how we normally but actually they're
[02:05:30] Dave Ricks: making a good point so that's the blend we've tried to find and I look at my career and probably
[02:05:37] four or five times I was putting a job I had no business being in but somebody thought I could learn
[02:05:42] Dave Ricks: it and that the output of that would be good performance at the end not at the beginning and then a
[02:05:46] Dave Ricks: better long-term thing for the company I'm so grateful for that because that's like ultimate
[02:05:51] Dave Ricks: risk taking on people and I would not be here without those successive jobs where I was like I never
[02:05:57] Dave Ricks: would have gotten them if I applied externally but the company gave them to me and as a CEO you have
[02:06:02] Dave Ricks: to do a lot of things that are very horizontal and I touched things that I had no experience in but
[02:06:08] Dave Ricks: I learned by racially reading and doing and solving real problems that has made me more successful in
[02:06:14] Dave Ricks: this job a lot of companies say they're long term-oriented but I feel like this is a particular example
[02:06:19] SPEAKER_02: of it revealed preference yeah David thank you some conversation thank you very much yeah
