# [Key Themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsGlsfIIkc)

## 1. Stablecoins as Infrastructure for Global Financial Innovation

Stablecoins are enabling a fundamental shift in how money moves globally, particularly in cross-border payments and emerging markets. As Zach Abrams explains: "The first use case was predominantly cross-border payments. And it was taking money...from Colombian pesos to US dollars, via stablecoins. And for a bunch of reasons, it was cheaper and faster." The infrastructure is already being used by major companies like SpaceX, who use Bridge to "take money out of a bunch of different countries in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins" to repatriate funds from global Starlink sales. The key insight is that local FX markets between stablecoins and local currencies have emerged organically: "in almost all these markets now, there are very robust, FX markets effectively that exist between, you know, a stablecoin like USDC or USDT and the local currency."

## 2. The "Open Source Financial Stack" Enabled by Blockchains

Stablecoins are creating an open, composable financial infrastructure that fundamentally changes the economics of building financial products. Zach describes it as: "you open source your financial stack. And the companies who are building on top of this are behind today, but basically making a bet that the cumulative power of all the builders in the world is going to create a better application over in years." Previously, "if you wanted to expand into a bunch of different countries, you had to uniquely build your US infrastructure, uniquely build your European infrastructure, uniquely build your Mexican infrastructure...And now what's possible is you have a wallet and one person just needs to build a US dollar stablecoin and then you throw it into the wallet and now you have a US balance." Henry Stern adds the analogy: "stablecoins are like Starlink for, you know, money...Once it's in zero gravity, it's super efficient to actually move the data around, move the money around, but the ground stations on the ground have to be built."

## 3. From Crypto-Native to Mainstream Business Adoption Post-Genius Act

The Genius Act fundamentally changed the risk calculation for businesses considering stablecoins, creating a massive unlock for mainstream adoption. As Zach explains: "the benefits of stablecoins have not changed, you know...But in some countries, you go into a country, there's one bank. And that bank has like no interest in enabling you to build a Fintech...the perceived risk of engaging with stablecoins or issuing stablecoins was really high." Post-Genius, "people realize there's license for them to participate in the market, and this market is likely going to be very big and a permanent part of the US financial ecosystem." Henry notes: "we saw European customers trying a lot more things under Micah because at least they knew ostensibly where the lines were, which wasn't true before...people are willing to engage."

# Contrarian Perspectives

## 1. Tether Will Never Pay Yield Despite Competition

Despite the emergence of yield-bearing stablecoin alternatives, both founders believe Tether will maintain its zero-yield model. When asked if Tether will pay yield in five years, Henry responds simply: "No." Zach agrees, explaining: "The areas where Tether is most successful, which is in trading, there is no need to pay yields back. And the network effects there are really material." This is counterintuitive because Henry had described "USDT is like a zero 100 hedge fund. Like they keep all the carrier for you," yet the network effects in trading and emerging market brand recognition appear insurmountable. However, Zach predicts that while Tether grows, "instead of it's at 60, 70% of the market, it becomes like 10% of the market" as yield-bearing alternatives expand the overall market.

## 2. US Banking Fragmentation is a Unique Competitive Advantage for Fintech

The extreme fragmentation of US banking (~5,000 banks) is actually a structural advantage that most people don't appreciate. Zach observes: "the Fintech ecosystem, just overall, has been very concentrated globally. Like in the US, we don't appreciate how many banks there are. And how many of them are willing to support all these different crazy Fintech ideas...But in some countries, you go into a country, there's one bank. And that bank has like no interest in enabling you to build a Fintech." This fragmentation, often criticized as inefficient, actually creates innovation opportunities that don't exist in more "efficient" concentrated banking markets. The insight extends to stablecoins providing this same enabling infrastructure globally: "stablecoins represent like the first opportunity for like large swaths of the world" to access similar fintech innovation.

## 3. The Biggest M&A Challenge is Knowing When NOT to Integrate

Most people assume successful acquisitions require deep integration, but Patrick and the team's approach is counterintuitive. Patrick explains the art: "companies are sort of standardization machines...the natural tendency is like, okay, great, you know, we're going to do things this driveway now. And there are some places where it's valuable to do things this driveway...but it's an incredible art to, okay, these are things that we're going to standardize. These are things where, yeah, you know, you guys are going to stay doing it the startup way." Henry emphasizes this was critical to the deal: "water conditions under which we think we can be successful here...they need to be able to work with competitive endeavors and have us competitive to Stripe itself...it's way too early in market development to try and verticalize the stack." A Google integration expert told Zach: "if you totally stay independent and you don't do any form of integration, there is like one plus one equals maybe two, but probably less than two...at some point in time during the journey, that there is like this moment that comes...where it becomes clear that the two need to come together."

## 4. Every Company Sitting on Balances Should Issue Their Own Stablecoin

The contrarian view is that stablecoin issuance will be dramatically more fragmented than people expect. Zach states: "everybody who's sitting on top of money, they should issue a stablecoin. That's the market, is all money at rest." The reasoning: "let's say you build a giant platform on top of a stablecoin. And then over time, that stablecoin changes the economic game...it's not that different than being Zenga and building on Facebook." Companies need control over their money infrastructure and access to the yield. He predicts: "ultimately all corporate treasury is we'll move into stablecoins" for companies that need to move money globally across entities. This goes against the intuition that we'll consolidate to a few major stablecoins.

## 5. Crypto Tribalism Stems from Money Psychology and Shared Suffering

Most people attribute crypto tribalism to pure financial incentives, but Henry offers a more nuanced psychological explanation: "I think there's two reasons. I think one people's relationship to money is very complicated...It is like soccer teams and a self of identification with something that's like quasi-religious, especially because like, you know, working in crypto for the last decade has been just being rejected time and again by like anyone else...being part of a leper colony for long enough creates really strong bonds of kinship of others. And then on top of that, you've got money." The insight is that the tribalism comes from both the financial incentives AND the shared experience of being marginalized, making it particularly intense compared to other tech sectors.

# Companies Identified

## 1. **SpaceX**
**Description:** Using stablecoins for global treasury management and repatriation of funds from international Starlink sales.

**Quote:** "SpaceX came to us their selling starlink all over the world. And so as a result, they're collecting local...people are paying for starlink and dozens, many dozens of different countries with their card...And they need to repatriate all those funds to the US because they fund their business out of the US. And so they started using us to bring currencies back to the US...they would take money out of a bunch of different countries in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins." - Zach Abrams

## 2. **Felix Pago**
**Description:** Remittance app powered by stablecoins that doesn't mention crypto on its website, focusing purely on customer value.

**Quote:** "Felix Pago is a reminthed app. It's powered by stablecoins. It doesn't mention stablecoins or crypto anywhere on the website. It talks about customer value. It's nice integration spots happen things like that. And so Felix Pago is just off-competing in the remittance space
