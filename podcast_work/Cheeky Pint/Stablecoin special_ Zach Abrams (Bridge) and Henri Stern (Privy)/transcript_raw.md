[00:00:00] You brought your own beer selection.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, as an international company,
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_02: I felt like you should have representatives
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_02: of different countries.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_02: How do you hide give us?
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_02: I have, and I did not remember it fondly.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_02: True listening to this should be like,
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_02: I should have a beer collection.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: I mean, everybody who's sitting on top of money,
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: that's the market, all money at rest.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_00: Uh, table coins are like Starlink for, you know, money.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_02: Once it's in zero gravity, it's super efficient
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_02: to actually move the data around,
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_02: move the money around,
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_02: but the ground stations on the ground have to be built.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_02: It feels like I walked into a college dorm.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_00: Do you want an alcoholic or not?
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: Uh, I feel like there's a very strong answer to this.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_00: And we're both checking like out,
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_00: waiting for you to decide.
[00:00:42] Stable coins are the biggest financial innovation
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_01: happening right now.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_01: So I invited two experts for a pint.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_01: Zach Abrams, founder of Bridge,
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_01: the leading stablecoin orchestration platform,
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_01: and Henry Stern, the founded Privy,
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_01: the leading crypto wallerson infrastructure.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_01: Both these companies recently joined
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: the strike by acquisitions,
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: and they're in the sake of helping both crypto companies
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: and regular companies build with stablecoins.
[00:01:02] Cheers.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_01: Cheers.
[00:01:06] Okay, lots to talk about with both Bridge and Privy.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: I realized with Bridge, when you started it,
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_01: it was 2023, was that like at the very
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_01: native of the doom loop for crypto?
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_01: We started right before then.
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: So we started right when it was interesting,
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_00: which maybe made it worse.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_00: Which is why.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:01:25] It was going to be horrible.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_00: This was, it wasn't 2023 is when we launched our APS.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: 22 is when we started Sean and I started the company
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_00: and raised money.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_00: And then immediately after we raised money,
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_00: Teriluna happened.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_00: Then the whole space was nuked
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_00: and then FDX happened and it was nuked again.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so remind me of the vibes here.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_01: Like 2022 was still like those pre FTX.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_01: Pre FTX.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: The things were going really well.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_00: It was before like when the Ukraine war happened,
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_00: the whole sort of economy started to shift.
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_00: And it was before that, DC funding was really high.
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: And then by June, it was gone.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: Everywhere was everything had, you know,
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: the most of the space had evaporated,
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: but especially in the crypto space.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: And at the time to mark this in crypto years,
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_00: when we started the company,
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_00: the first idea we had was using your bank account
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: to acquire NFTs.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_00: So it was the NFT phase of the carbon dating of the company.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's like a great answer.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: And that's where almost all the volume was, was NFT drops.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: The other thing I was going to say
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_00: just about Bridges' beginnings is we had an early all hands
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_02: at privy where it was a lunch and learn
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_02: and one of our teammates Max worked with,
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_02: with Zach Friar.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so Zach came to Friar to privy.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_02: We're going to work on Savoqins and we're like,
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_02: what is this guy talking about?
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_02: This is not a market, it does not exist.
[00:02:59] Well, on our side when the NFT market blew up,
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_00: our initial product went away.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: And we were sort of pivoting around
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_00: to try to figure out what we wanted to do.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: One of our first ideas was to build wallets as a service.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: And which is obviously your business.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: At the time, I don't think that you,
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: maybe you existed, but at least it wasn't.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_00: You weren't on our radar at all.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_00: And I remember looking at the space and being like,
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: nope, that's a tar pit.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_00: There's nothing for us to build there.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: It's so deeply competitive and then we quickly moved on
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_00: and went our way to Savoqins.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_00: So for me, looking back, like you went through
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_00: the exact same thing, saw that same idea,
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: saw that same opportunity and was like, yes,
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: this is this thing and obviously built something
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: really good there.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: How do you describe, plus, pretty much,
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_00: does today to people?
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: We enable developers to build with Savoqins.
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_00: And it could be anything they want to build.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: So we help folks like SpaceX use Savoqins
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: to move money cross-border.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: We help folks like Dollar App build NeoVanks
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: on top of Savoqins.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: We help folks like Felix Pago build cross-border payments
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: experiences with Savoqins.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_00: We help treasures rebalance their internal funds
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: with Savoqins.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_00: Stable coins are sort of this broad payment platform
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: on top of which a bunch of new payment experiences
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: can be built and we build APIs to let people use it.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: I want to come back to all those use cases,
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_01: but maybe first to catch up.
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_01: So how about privy?
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_01: Where in the crypto hype and then bust and then re-hype cycle?
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_01: Did you guys start privy?
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_01: Peek hype.
[00:04:37] It's a I do our thing, crypto prior.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_02: And I think I came out of that experience
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_02: thinking this space is incredible.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_02: We have these rails that can be used to sort of
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_02: codify ownership on the web in a way
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_02: that hasn't been possible before,
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_02: but also no one cares about building products
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_02: that people actually want to use.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_02: And so this is a endless space where we'll work
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_02: on protocols, but never actually.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_02: No offense to protocols, which I think are deeply useful,
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_02: but only if they get carried through all the way to utility.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_02: You need to actually, and exactly.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_02: And exactly.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_01: And so I left.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_02: And I think, you know, Pete crypto brought me back,
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_02: which is I was like, I want to work on data tokenization,
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_02: which was the initial idea.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_02: A good place to do that was crypto.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_02: So our first version of it was can we build
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_02: data tokenization that would enable crypto companies
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_02: to privately KYC people, which is a very 2021 idea
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_02: of like, you know, these private pools of liquidity
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: that you need to be a KYC for.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_02: And that, remember.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_02: That led us to Wallet, which was,
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_02: this is really hard because people don't have the means
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_02: of actually signing for things.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_02: And most users don't want to get a wallet.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_02: And so we're like, we should solve that problem first.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_02: And then we can come back to it.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_02: And that's how we got to privy.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_02: And so how do you describe to people
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_02: of us privy does today?
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_02: We build basically digital asset accounts.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_02: Wallets are the means of controlling,
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_02: crypto stablecoins, any digital asset.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_02: And so we build APIs, so developers can build basically
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_02: digital asset accounts directly into their app,
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_02: rather than requiring a user to go outside the app,
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_02: to get an account.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_02: You can get it as part of your neo bank payments platform,
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_02: consumer app, and those are the people that we serve.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_02: But basically, we give you the means of controlling assets
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_02: in app.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_01: So is it basically no one plans to be disrupted
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_01: by stablecoins, funnily enough?
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_01: And so if you're a remittance app, if you're a neo bank,
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: if you're any of these guys, you want to natively build
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_01: a digital asset functionality into your app,
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_01: and you guys provide the wallet infrastructure
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_01: for them to do that.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: And I think the goal is to say, like,
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_02: you shouldn't need a PhD or deep interest in self-servant
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_02: tea in order to want to engage in the space.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_02: You should be able to do it as easily as you do anything else
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_02: on the web.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_02: And we make that possible.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_01: I talk to business people who are not in stablecoins.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: And especially maybe say people who are in fintech,
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_01: but not in stablecoins.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: They say, I'm sure hearing a lot of about stablecoins,
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_01: but it doesn't seem like they're actually happening
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_01: yet in a real way.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_01: And obviously, the Stripe Bridge Privy House view
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_01: informed by all the data we're seeing.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: And our customer usage is like, no, they're happening.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_01: Like, they're maybe not happening for you yet in a big way,
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_01: but they're happening at an industry level.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_01: But I think people have a hard time visualizing
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_01: because they say, well, I don't pay at the bar
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_01: using stablecoins.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_01: I am myself not paying deep say, therefore, I just don't see it.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: Maybe you guys can level set for people.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_01: What's actually working?
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_01: Because like consumer retail payments in the US
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_01: are not the hotbed of stablecoin innovation.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_01: Just where is the stablecoin stuff happening today?
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_01: The first use case was predominantly cross-border payments.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: And it was taking money.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_00: And our first developer was this team called Zulu.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_00: And they were a company based in Columbia.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_00: And they were taking Colombian pesos, converting them
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: into stablecoins, sending those stablecoins
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: through the bridge APIs, converting them into dollars.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: So you go from Colombian pesos to US dollars,
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_00: via stablecoins.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_00: And for a bunch of reasons, it was cheaper and faster.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: And they showed us the cross-border payment opportunity.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: Because before them, I actually had no idea
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: that stablecoins would be useful for cross-border payments.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_00: And then since then, we've seen like, new banks,
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_00: like Dollar App and so on become very, very successful.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_00: Building on top of us, and there are global US dollar
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_00: app built unstablecoins that can be used
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_00: all across that time.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: OK, so cross-border payments, dollar balances, dollar
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: holdings for people in emerging markets.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_01: Anything else?
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_01: After that, we've seen, so SpaceX came to us
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: their selling starlink all over the world.
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: And so as a result, they're collecting local,
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: so people are paying for starlink and dozens,
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: many dozens of different countries with their card,
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_00: so they're getting local currencies in all these countries.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: And they need to repatriate all those funds to the US
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: because they fund their business out of the US.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_00: And so they started using us to bring currencies back to the US.
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_00: And so they would take money out of a bunch of different countries
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_00: in Africa and Latin and send it to the US via stablecoins.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_00: How do they do the initial conversion
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: from, you know, Rwandan local currency or, you know,
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_01: Bolivars or what have you, two US dollars?
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_01: So we do that for them, but the way that we do that
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_00: is that in almost all these markets now,
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_00: there are very robust, FX markets effectively
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_00: that exist between, you know, a stablecoin like USDC
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_00: or USDT and the local currency.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: And this was like the last, you know,
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_00: with each one of these crypto cycles,
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_00: like more of the infrastructure gets built
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_00: that enables the next thing.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: And in the last crypto cycle,
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_00: the big thing that happened was that all these local exchanges started.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_00: So you had local exchanges in Latam, in Africa, the Middle East,
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_00: the Philippines all begin to get scale.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: And those exchanges are dominated by stablecoin volume.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_00: And they've effectively just become alternative FX markets.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_00: What's the remaining gap like?
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: Is there the biggest gap between marketing and reality
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: of this as doable today?
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: I would say that the biggest thing that we see in the market
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: is that these, these FX markets,
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_00: so, you know, converting between Mexican peso
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: and USDC or Mexican peso and dollar,
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_00: some of these fiat markets are phenomenally deep
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: and phenomenally efficient.
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_00: So someone could send $100 million to Mexico
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_00: and convert into pesos without moving the market.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_00: But the stablecoin market is not as deep.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_00: So it's hyper efficient.
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_00: That the interesting dynamic at play is that
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_00: in the fiat FX markets, as you get bigger,
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_00: your pricing comes down.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: In the crypto markets, as you get bigger,
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_00: your pricing goes up because the spread's widened.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_00: So the market is way more efficient for startups.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: Over time, the markets get deeper and deeper.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: And so their startups are scaling and scaling.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_00: We see that with, like, Felix Tago and others.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: I think that you're highlighting with the FX dynamic
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_01: is underappreciated in crypto being a platform
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_01: on which, you know, it's like a shelling point
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_01: for everyone to come together to create better things.
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_01: And so we now have just more efficient ways
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_01: to converse Bollivars to US dollars than we had before.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: It's not particularly crypto native,
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_01: that particular leg,
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_01: but crypto is load bearing in bringing everyone together.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_01: That's kind of what we see, I think, in our market,
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_02: which is to say, like, you know,
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_02: but my analogy is stablecoins,
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_02: it's a very self-serving software to hardware analogy,
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_02: but like stablecoins are like Starlink for, you know, money,
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_02: where you need the ground stations to actually, you know,
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_02: to beam the pipes up from, you know, co-axe or fiber
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_02: onto line of sight, like zero gravity, like space.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_02: Once it's in zero gravity, it's super efficient
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_02: to actually move the data around and move the money around.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_02: But the ground stations on the ground have to be built.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_02: And at least where we take care of the market is mostly,
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_02: after you guys have done the really hard work
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_02: of converting Fiat to crypto,
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_02: then the question is, what can you actually do with the crypto?
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_02: And that's where, you know, obviously, wallets and those
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_02: are the powers that people will come to us for.
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_02: That analogy may be deeper than you think,
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_01: because, you know, in the Starlink NASHPAR,
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_01: where they started with more ground stations,
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_01: and then over time, they're enabling more satellite
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: to satellite connectivity to reduce the need
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_01: for ground stations.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_01: So it could be really deep analogy.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_01: I mean, okay, same question to you, Henry,
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: where just what are people actually using
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_01: steel coins for?
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_01: For us, it's, so a lot of it is basically,
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_02: once, you know, wallets as the account system
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_02: are kind of like the control plane,
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_02: once you have the stable corner, what can you do with it?
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_02: And so I think the majority of what people use us for
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_02: is one, specifically the holding.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_02: I want to hold these assets, and I want to put these assets
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_02: to work.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_02: So it's opening up credit markets, and you'll generally,
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_02: for people who otherwise didn't have access before.
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_02: And one of the things that's like shocking about USDT
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_02: is like USDT is like a zero 100 hedge fund.
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_02: Like they keep all,
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_02: the carrier for you, which speaks to how like
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_02: much people want stable currency across the world.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_02: And then the other thing that we're seeing
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_02: to your point about startups is kind of the emergence
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_02: of like fintech super apps, a lot of early stage companies
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_02: that now have the actual stack to build everything
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_02: that has taken, you know, the neo banks, the world,
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_02: the revolutes, the clarnas decades to build,
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_02: and they can do in a year because everything's ready
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_02: for them here.
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_02: So those are the sort of two types of use cases,
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_02: which is I want to build like bank accounts
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_02: that are fully global, that work for any consumer,
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_02: ones they can get their hands on crypto.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_02: And then I want to make sure that these assets
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_02: are put to work either through traditional markets
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_02: or by actually investing in other assets.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's what, I mean, one of the things
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_00: I'm most optimistic about is you have,
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_00: like the financial world before,
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_00: if you wanted to expand into a bunch of different countries,
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: you had to uniquely build your US infrastructure,
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_00: uniquely build your European infrastructure,
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: uniquely build your Mexican infrastructure.
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_00: And the next company that came around
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_00: had to do the same thing, you know,
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_00: and then the next company ran, had to come and do the same thing.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_00: And now what's possible is you have a wallet
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_00: and one person just needs to build a US dollar stablecoin
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: and then you throw it into the wallet
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_00: and now you have a US balance.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: And then someone else in the world
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: needs to build a Nyra stablecoin.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: And now you have Nyra, someone else in the world,
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_00: JPY stablecoin.
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_00: Now you have.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_00: Yes, PVC was n squared and that was the same.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_01: You kind of open source your financial stack.
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_00: And you know, it's like very early days,
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: in this and to get here, we need local stablecoins.
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_00: And right now, stablecoins are dominated by US dollars,
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: but you open source your financial stack.
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_00: And the companies who are building on top of this
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_00: are behind today, but basically making a bet
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_00: that the cumulative power of all the builders in the world
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: is going to create a better application over in years.
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: Why have the local stablecoins been so slow?
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_01: Because like, you know, US dollars are not that big a share
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_01: of global currency balances,
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_01: but you know, US dollars are 95 plus percent
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_01: of stablecoin balances.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_01: What's going on out the euro's, the Canadian dollar
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_01: isn't the Swiss francs, so the...
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_01: My theory is that this is like reveal preference.
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_02: US dollars are not that big a share for...
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_02: You see the currency preference?
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_02: Exactly, where's the true preference?
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_02: If you go to a country that, you know,
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_02: I can think of many and even a crisp hundred dollar bill
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_02: that's worth a lot more than like any other currency,
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_02: I've traveled to places where I've euros and dollars
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_02: and people are like, no, give me the dollars first.
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_01: So I believe you in the emerging market context
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_01: where, you know, purely if you're in Turkey
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_01: and you can hold like Turkish lira or US dollars,
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_01: that's not even really a contest.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_01: I don't, as a European, I'm not that unhappy holding euros.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_01: I'm not that concerned about it.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_01: And so euro stablecoins, Swiss francs,
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_01: stablecoins, just other major market
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_01: stablecoins should be a lot bigger.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_01: Well, this is where, I mean, I don't know,
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_02: the two dichotomies to me is like US versus global.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_02: And then it's like B2B versus B2C.
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_02: I think the majority of the stablecoin market today
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_02: is B2B and that will change.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_02: But like the reality is basically,
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_02: it weird is B2C, it's emerging markets,
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_02: hence the US dollar preference,
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_02: in other words, B2B, it's American companies,
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_02: hence the US dollar preference.
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_02: So supposedly, it'll even out over time,
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_02: but at least for now, it seems to be a real preference
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_02: that like dollars are.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_02: I think that's probably true.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: I think that the majority of the two main use cases
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_00: for stablecoins, or the main use case for stablecoins
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_00: for many years was trading.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_00: And that market, everything is just quoted in dollars.
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_00: And there's a real network effect.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_00: So as more and more liquidity was built around
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_00: a few dollars, that makes sense.
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_00: I think over time, you will see more of these stablecoins,
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_00: but ultimately, those same network effects
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: are going to, I think, perpetuate.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_00: I think you're gonna see,
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_00: while like, Fiat US dollars are X percent
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_00: of the global market, stablecoin US dollars
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_00: are going to be way more forever.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_00: But I do think we, I hope we get to local stablecoins
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_00: being 15, 20% of the market,
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_00: because you need them transactionally
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: in all these markets, and you wanna have alternative
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_00: effects markets, and you want people to be able
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: to store in local currencies.
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to create much better experiences,
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_00: but we're not there yet.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_00: And then to your point, just about the history of this,
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_02: Tether God started as a deposit asset for trading.
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_02: You didn't want to basically have to trade out back
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_02: to dollars, you didn't want to hold your position
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_02: over night, so you would move into stablecoin,
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_02: and then couldn't get dollars.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_02: And they, exactly, but I think that it's
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_02: a 24.7 currency, you don't have to wait to move.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_02: So I think, why should you care if you're working
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_02: on a business today, that broadly handles money,
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_02: but it's like, my money works fine.
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes.
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_02: I think the UX is gonna be much better for consumers,
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_02: to actually have an always on money rail.
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_02: Beyond that, there's a reality,
[00:17:21] which is you get to have a relationship with your user
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_02: that's much longer lasting.
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_02: Essentially Uber has done this, where Uber drivers
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_02: get financing for their cars via Uber,
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_02: but now any company can really do this,
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_02: where instead of paying out, and then the relationship ends
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_02: because the bank now owns the user,
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_02: they can maintain a relationship with the user,
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_02: via these accounts that they enable.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_02: So every company, ostensibly, has a new banking arm
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_02: that they can build into this to create a much tighter loop
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_02: of benefits to their constituency.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_02: But what's the long-term equilibrium here?
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_01: Because presumably consumers don't want their money spread out
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_01: across 15 different services they interact with,
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_01: or do they?
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_01: I mean, credit card chopping,
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_02: such as I see it on Reddit sub threads,
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_02: would say that maybe they do,
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_02: but I think this is the entire point,
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_02: and where at least Privy gets dinged a lot
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_02: with embedded wallets, is it used to be the wallet
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_02: was the users, and you would carry it with yourself
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_02: from like app to app to app,
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_02: and you had a single point where you held everything.
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_02: And that's great for centralization of these controls.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_02: It's really bad for UX,
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_02: because it means you're running third party software
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_02: on every site you go to.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_02: We've enabled an inversion of that,
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_02: whereby the app can serve their own
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_02: self-gustal wallets as part of the app experience,
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_02: but it creates this fragmentation.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: And at least to me, this is the real opportunity
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_02: for building these like money networks,
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_02: where if you can help users make sense of that fragmentation,
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_02: where even though you have your assets
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_02: in 15 different apps,
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_02: each app on your phone is a bank.
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_02: You have some control plane,
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_02: where you can manage those assets between all of them.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_02: It's not that fragmented if it's programmable.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_01: That's the hope.
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_00: I think that the, this question is like overwhelmingly
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_00: going to be dictated by regulatory requirements.
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_00: I think in like a free market,
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_00: then what we would resolve to like 90% US dollars
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: for something.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_01: Is Micah good, bad, fine?
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_01: I would say it seems to be fine,
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_00: but it could be bad.
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: And I think the thing with all of these
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_00: like regulatory requirements,
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_00: or that they're sort of like untested.
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_00: And so what is, what's basically happening is
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_00: there's like a few folks who are compliant
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_00: in Europe, and they're stretching it
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_00: to the regulatory requirements to meet their like
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: specific needs.
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_00: And then over time, they're going to clamp down.
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_00: And what it looks like to be compliant in Europe
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_00: will probably be different,
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_00: very different in five years versus today.
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: Oh, interesting.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_01: So you were saying we haven't seen Micah enforcement yet.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_01: And that will inform people's views of Micah.
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_01: Yes, exactly.
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_00: Like the way that the USDC is is complying
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_00: with the requirements are very different
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_00: than the way local European issuers
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_00: are complying with the requirements.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_00: The interesting like Delta for us,
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_02: at least, was we saw European customers
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_02: trying a lot more things under Micah
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_02: because at least they knew ostensibly
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_02: where the lines were, which wasn't true before Genius.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_02: And now we're seeing that with Genius
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_02: where people are willing to engage.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_02: So I would argue that compared to what existed before,
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_02: which was no clarity and no willing to engage,
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_02: something is better than that.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_02: It's been very good for the European crypto.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_02: Totally.
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_02: You described Tether as a zero 100 HFU
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_01: and I hadn't heard that before,
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_01: but it feels to me that paying out 0% of the yield
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_01: is not the long-term equilibrium
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_01: when it comes to stablecoins.
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_01: And so what happens to Tether?
[00:20:36] So I went to Kenya on holiday a year ago.
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_02: Well, that's very widespread in emerging markets today.
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_01: There was a poster that had a crypto app on it
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_02: and there were two logos on it.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_02: It was Bitcoin, it was Tether.
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_02: As I do think brand matters in a sense,
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_02: and I think if you ask someone, do you want
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_02: Tether or alternate stable, they will pick Tether.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_02: And so I think for the most part,
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_02: and you have more views on this,
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_02: for the public insurance, but there will be brought
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_02: in our opportunity and every app can have their own
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_02: so that they can choose how to program their stablecoin.
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_02: But I wonder if the network effects are already so entrenched
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_02: and so powerful that maybe they're forced to change
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_02: somehow how the yield management works,
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_02: but it's too far established for it to be a complete inversion.
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I think Tether is going to be wildly successful.
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it already has been.
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_00: It's like arguably one of the most successful
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_00: fintechs in the last three decades or something,
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_00: but I think there will be, and continue to be,
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_00: I think there is this enormous network effect
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_00: behind their business.
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_00: That being said, I think that pretty soon,
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_00: like in the next year, any consumer who wants access
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_00: to the risk-free rate is going to have access to it.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_00: And I think that is going to create a sucking sound
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_00: from some USDT, but I also think that it's going to take
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_00: the market and expand it materially.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_00: What I hope happens is that USDT grows,
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_00: but instead of it's at 60, 70% of the market,
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_00: it becomes like 10% of the market.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_00: And the alternative point is simply,
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_02: also let's figure out the alternative,
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_02: like the reality is you can hold Tether
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_02: or you can lose 25% of your network.
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_02: Every year, but you're not there.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_02: I agree, but I'm just wondering,
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_02: what's the long-term competitive equilibrium?
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_01: Like in five years, do you think Tether pays yield?
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_01: No.
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_02: Really?
[00:22:25] No.
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_02: I would take the same side of that.
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, just because that is their view,
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_01: their worldview.
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_00: I don't think they'd be to have to in order to say no.
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: The areas where Tether is most successful,
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_00: which is in trading, there is no need to pay,
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_00: to pay yields back.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_00: And the network effects there are really material.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_00: That being said, I think that the trading use case
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_00: was like 100% of the market two years ago,
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_00: was 80% of the market today, and will be 5% of the market
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_00: in some number of years.
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_00: We're talking about the international adoption
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_01: of stablecoins.
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_01: We have an experience with people is,
[00:23:02] SPEAKER_01: I feel like it's pretty common that you have very network
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_01: effect, the products that are adopted first, internationally,
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_01: and then come into the US.
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_01: And so WhatsApp used only be used internationally.
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_01: And then it was used by Americans who are kind of cosmopolitan
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_01: and had international friends, you know,
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_01: or like a traveler abroad or whatever.
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_01: It's like if you have WeChat,
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_01: it's because you know people in China.
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_01: And so for a while, it was that.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_01: And now it's more mainstream in the United States,
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_01: and it's, you know, I mean, it's not totally broadly used,
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_01: but it's pretty commonly used.
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_01: That feels to me the story of how
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_01: stablecoins get adopted in the United States,
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_01: where you start to see some of these network effects being used.
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_01: Is that the case or will we just see other ways
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_01: through it after?
[00:23:46] I think we were, we're really seeing a complete sigmoid
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_02: in terms of like where the adoption's happening.
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_02: So you have these absolute whales,
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_02: like apps and companies that have called it 20,000 users,
[00:23:57] SPEAKER_02: but the users are moving millions of dollars
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_02: and assets through trading and investing
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_02: and using stablecoins heavily in the US and elsewhere.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_02: And then on the other side, you've got a lot of business
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_01: or the customers.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_01: The customers.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_01: So you're very large US traders,
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_01: you know, the other side.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_01: And on the other side, you've got a much smaller company,
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_02: a much smaller consumers abroad
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_02: and a much wider network that you're talking about.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_02: But I suspect you kind of see this, this, like, you know,
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_02: it's going to be a two-prong strategy
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_02: where it comes in through both ends.
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_02: I think that's true, but I mean, I think right now,
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_00: we see, you know, the dynamic that you're mentioning,
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_00: certainly playing out in like a great example
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_00: of this is like the polymarkets of the world,
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_00: like global markets, built on top of stablecoins,
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_00: they're now coming into the US,
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_00: those same markets are going to be stablecoin oriented.
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_00: And so people are going to be able to posit
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_00: from their bank accounts, but it's all going to land
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_00: in stablecoins because you want one global market.
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_00: And we're seeing the same thing with fintechs
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_00: where, you know, you have folks who are expanding
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_00: internationally, eventually you just want one dollar balance.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_00: You're not going to want many different,
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_00: many different dollar balances.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's like, definitely the case.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_00: I think that as we look, you know, startups
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_00: that are starting today, even if you were just serving
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_00: the US market, it makes sense for you to build on stablecoins
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_00: for, you know, it's cheaper, it's like much faster
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_00: to go to market, but you also know that eventually,
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_00: you probably will want to go international.
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_00: And this is the foundation that enables you to do that.
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_00: Everyone wants to be future proof.
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_01: And yes, still going through the only way to do that.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_02: Well, it's cool as a European at least, you know,
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_02: as a French person, like it always felt tough
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_02: to see French startups because the market's too small.
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_02: And like there's too many European like differences,
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_02: like selling into France.
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_02: Doesn't mean you can sell it to Spain or Germany.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_02: And the US has never had that problem
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_02: because the market is like so big.
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_02: And it's kind of cool to see that at a Fintech level,
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_02: which is always kind of landlocked, playing out globally.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_02: Where there's just a much bigger opportunity
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_02: if you can build a global business from day one.
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_02: The other like amazing dynamic is that the Fintech ecosystem,
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_00: just overall, has been very concentrated globally.
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_00: Like in the US, we don't appreciate how many banks there are.
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_00: And how many of them are willing to support
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_00: all these different crazy Fintech ideas
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_00: and how many of them have APIs and lending products
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: or card products or what have you.
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_00: But in some countries, you go into a country, there's one bank.
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_00: And that bank has like no interest in enabling you
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_00: to build a Fintech.
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_00: And as a result, the consumers in that market
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_00: see no advancement in their financial experiences.
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_00: And so stablecoins represent like the first opportunity
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_00: for like large swaths of the world.
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_00: People in the US do not have a good mental model
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_01: for how different the banking ecosystem
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_01: in every other country is.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_01: Because the US is so sweet generous.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_01: It's like 5,000 banks over the number is currently in the US.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: Whereas every other banking market has between three and eight banks.
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: And it's very concentrated and generally pretty steady.
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_01: And yeah.
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_00: When we were like talking to a bunch of founders
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_00: in all these different markets, some of them would tell us like,
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_00: oh, we're getting our bank license in whatever country.
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: And like in my mind, I'm just like,
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_00: oh, that's like the equivalent of getting like an MTL
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_00: or something like whatever.
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_00: You know, in a new way, they're like, no,
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_00: this is like a huge, a huge deal.
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_00: And now I have like a much deeper appreciation.
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_01: Who will build the successful neo bank in the US?
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_01: And was it going to be a single super app?
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_02: Or is it actually going to get fragmented as like, you know,
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_02: there'll be more of them because it's much easier.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_02: It sounds like you have a thesis here.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_02: Well, I think it's actually much more likely
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_02: to your point about like this is open sourcing
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_02: the like Fintech stack.
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_02: Like the reality is you actually get to pick and choose
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_02: the layers at what you want to play.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_02: You can offer credit to your consumers or you can offer like,
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_02: you know, balances to your consumer,
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_02: you can offer payments to your consumer.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_02: We don't have to bundle all of them if you don't want to.
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_02: So I think we'll see like two things.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_02: We'll see, I would argue that today the closest things
[00:27:48] are like, I guess call it Robinhood and Cash App.
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_02: Or the closest things I see to like a European
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_02: style neo bank working in the US.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_02: I think gravity is shifted thanks to the sort of stuff
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_02: that that that crypto is enabled and stable points
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_02: have been enabled.
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_02: And I basically wonder if it's going to be singular
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_02: platforms or if it's going to just going to be
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_02: kind of a part of the fabric of many more platforms.
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_02: I think that will happen.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_01: But if you think concretely like if you measure
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_01: neo banking primacy as where does your paycheck
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_01: get deposited?
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_01: Like at least in my case, I moved to the US for college.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_01: And when I was there freshman year in college,
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_01: I set up a bank for America count.
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_01: And my striped paycheck to the state is like deposit
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_01: in that bank for America count.
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_01: And like in 10 years time, who are people getting their
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_01: paycheck deposited into?
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_01: I think that the market is going to, I think that these
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_00: banks are still going to be really big.
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_00: They were same thing happened to me.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_00: I was on campus and someone gave me a free Duke T-shirt
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_00: to sign up for a bank account.
[00:28:49] And I've still had that bank account, you know?
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: Something really interesting.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_00: The Cacto LTV.
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_00: Yes, they're like T-shirts or cash money.
[00:28:57] It's like a venture type outcome for them.
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_00: Like is banking going to be as sticky as it was if you have
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_02: a lot more competition in the market?
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_02: Which is sensibly this will, you know, in general.
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_02: Well, what I think is going to happen now,
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_00: I think that most financial experiences are going to be
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_00: rebuilt on blockchains.
[00:29:17] I think lending is going to be rebuilt on blockchains.
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_00: I think obviously like trading is going to be I think
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_00: saving is going to be spending is going to be,
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_00: I think a lot of these financial experiences
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_00: are going to get rebuilt on blockchains.
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_00: And they will all compound each other to make the next generation
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_00: of neo banks that are building on top of crypto wallets,
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_00: materially better across a bunch of different dimensions.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_00: And as a result, I think there will be a pretty material
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_00: fragmentation of the market versus where it is today.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_00: And it's already relatively fragmented.
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_00: A very hard day for us at preview was as we be.
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_02: Well, it's sort of stressful.
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_00: That was the first week we launched.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_00: Oh my gosh.
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was a long few days and we were, you know,
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_02: asked by our backers to diversify risk a little bit more
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_02: than we had of Dilden.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_02: It was our only bank account.
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_02: And so we've been built basically like, you know,
[00:30:15] accounts at like three different institutions.
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_02: And at least the pitch for self-custody and crypto
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_02: is to say the account is yours, the skin that you choose
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_02: to take it through, meaning the UX of the actual sort of rails,
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_02: the add-on services that you get.
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_02: All that will come through the sleeve
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_02: that I guess you put the account in.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_02: But the account is yours and can be poured it over and over
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_02: and over again.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_02: So I think that's one of the big questions I'm interested
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_02: in over the next decade is what is the split of custodial
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_02: versus the self-custodial accounts?
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_01: So this is like a very old time in LG,
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_01: but many people don't realize that, you know,
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_01: Chase built their own software, you know, the big banks do.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_01: But if you bank with a credit union or a midsize bank,
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: they absolutely do not build their own banking software
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_01: for the ledgering and managing the account
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: and anything like that.
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_01: And there's, you know, Fyser, there's Jack Henry,
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: there's first data, there's a few companies like this
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_01: who build the bank cores as they're known.
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_01: And so the banks are actually, you know, a balance sheet
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_01: and a credit strategy and a brand and various things.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_01: But in front of all this software that is provided
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_01: by someone else.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_01: And so are you saying that your vision is that there's much more
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_01: of that where you can plug in the crypto equivalent
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_01: of a bank core again, there's like a total tradfinalgy.
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_01: You can plug in the crypto equivalent of a bank core
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_01: into a new bank or, you know, maybe Uber and Lyft want it.
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_01: One, two, maybe Uber and Lyft want to build this
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_01: for their drivers, you know, or something like that.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: Is that basically your vision of where things go?
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_01: That's, I think the hope in many ways
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_02: for where things should go or could go.
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_02: I think, you know, it's very much an open question.
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_02: It's a big part of where we feel it's pretty
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_02: that we have a responsibility to trying to make sure
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_02: that it's kind of an even playing field.
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_02: And there are good opportunities on both sides of the aisle.
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_02: But yeah, I think that's exactly the point.
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_02: I think the point would be the ledger is already public
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_02: because it's on chain.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_02: The account is really like cryptography.
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_02: It's like private keys that people should be able
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_02: to take with them.
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_02: And accordingly, you could move the banking core yourself
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_02: as a consumer.
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_02: And I think that Uber and Lyft analogy is at this point
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_02: a very tired crypto analogy.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_02: I'm pretty worried.
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_02: But the old crypto dream was what if Uber basically enabled you
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_02: to have a different rating system based on where you were
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_02: and a different pool of the core network is shared,
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_02: but then the actual app and delivery mechanism
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_02: through which you have is something
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_02: that you can build on top of much, much more easily.
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:32:33] Was that a woefully out of touch analogy for me?
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_02: Sure.
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_02: Just how?
[00:32:37] SPEAKER_02: No, I've been trying to figure out
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_02: how do we explain self-carsity?
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_02: And because the only self-custodial asset is cash.
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_02: And so it's very helpful actually
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_02: to have more mental battles worth.
[00:32:49] OK, so we got one garris here.
[00:32:54] Good check out.
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_01: Collect.
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_01: All right, this is just our regular NFC interface.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: So what pivot method do you have there?
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_01: I am paying with a fused card, which
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_00: is backed by my stablecoin balance.
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_00: So it's a Visa card issued that is tethered to a balance
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_00: in a Solana, USDC on Solana balance.
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_00: OK, so there is no bank account associated with this card.
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_01: It is Visa backending to a Solana on chain balance.
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_01: OK, so there is.
[00:33:23] Please be accepted.
[00:33:25] Sweet, you're good for it.
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_01: How did the on-chain transaction mark
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_00: does that happen in real time?
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_00: The stablecoins in the balance
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_00: are then moved immediately to a smart contract.
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_00: And then at the end of the day, all the funds
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_00: in that smart contract are then settled to the networks.
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_00: So the balance is actually moved out of the wallet.
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: So I've had 536 moved out of my wallet.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_00: But is there a real, like, can you get race conditions here?
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_01: And is the age-old question?
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_01: So yeah, like, can you overspend?
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_01: You can double-spend.
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_01: OK, you can overspend.
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_01: It checks the balance in the wallet in real time.
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_01: But you could have a double-spend attack.
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_01: If during the exact same moment, two transactions
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_00: are authorized at the exact same time
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_00: on the same card from the same balance,
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_00: then both would theory be a place.
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: So you're saying we need a blockchain built for payments?
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_01: That's what I'm saying.
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_02: The account layer is something that we've
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_02: had to build on the wallet side, which
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_02: is actually the ability to freeze funds
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_02: based on the first payment to prevent double-spend.
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_02: So it's actually something that we've had to build out
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_02: for some of our customers, specifically for that reason.
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_02: And you're saying this at the privy level rather than
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: the chain level, and then you post that transaction
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_01: with the chain.
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_02: That's cool.
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_01: Again, you would see why you want this.
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_01: So one of the mistakes I think people make
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_01: thinking about crypto is they think
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_01: as a disgrace invention.
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_01: Like one day we had computers, but of course, one day,
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_01: we had like a Univac.
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_01: Then we had the Apple One, and we had the Macintosh.
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_01: And actually, the computers got much better over time
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_01: to the point of almost being different things.
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_01: And I think similarly, people think
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_01: of blockchains happening at one point in time.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_01: But we tried the payments use case.
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_01: We tried raw Bitcoin, no lightning or anything back in the day
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_01: in 2013, 2014.
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_01: That was not a good payment blockchain.
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_01: I'll tell you that.
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_01: And despite the fact that the Bitcoin white paper really
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_01: talked about payments as the core use case,
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_01: rather than many things that have really worked for Bitcoin.
[00:35:20] SPEAKER_01: And so I'm curious, as you look at the last five to 10 years
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_01: of blockchain advancements, just how would you guys
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_00: describe them?
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_00: We started building payments use cases on top of blockchains
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_00: like two, three years ago.
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_00: And it became very clear to us immediately
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_00: that none of these things were optimized for this use case.
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_00: And it was like a bunch of micro decisions
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_00: that probably made sense for different use cases
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_00: that we're being optimized for, but made it really hard
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: for us to be successful.
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_00: So one example is that on some blockchains,
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_00: in order to make the address, make it possible for that address
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_00: to accept USDC, you have to fund it in primates
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_00: so that it is available to accept that USDC.
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_00: And that might cost 30 cents.
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_00: So can't send USDC to an address that does not have it?
[00:36:17] Yeah, that does not have gas and has not been basically
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_00: programmed to accept USDC.
[00:36:25] SPEAKER_00: It would be stuck there.
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_00: It would just the transaction would just get denied
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_00: and you couldn't get it out.
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_00: And so imagine that you want to use this blockchain
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_00: to create millions of wallets at the same time.
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_00: That becomes phenomenally expensive.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_00: The other thing is that the majority of these blockchains
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_00: in order to send a stablecoin transaction,
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_00: you need this other random token that now it's kind of just
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_00: like common that folks are comfortable with that.
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_00: Or just the throughput requirements on blockchains
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_00: or the failure rates on blockchains are relatively high
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_00: for payments use cases.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_00: I mean, in fact, the first time we did an aid payment
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: disbursement, we were working with the US government
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_00: to disperse aid payments into Latam.
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: We were sending tens of thousands of payments,
[00:37:14] SPEAKER_00: which was like a lot for us.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_00: It's not that much for first ripe.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_00: It took us like 18 hours to send all of those transactions.
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_00: And what was the bottleneck?
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_00: It was basically all of the transactions
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_00: need to be serially sent through the and confirmed
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_00: through the blockchain.
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_00: And what would end up happening is that there
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_00: is a relatively high failure rate for these.
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_00: So a decent number would fail.
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_00: We'd have to capture them, chronicle them,
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_00: and then resend them.
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_00: And it's just because they're not picked up.
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_00: No worse fate working on a blockchain
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_02: than having to manually set the bonds
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_02: of the transactions when you get to that place.
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_02: It's a dark, dark time.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_00: And so we just realized time and time again
[00:38:00] SPEAKER_00: that there's been blockchains that
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_00: have been built for trading use cases
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_00: and blockchains being built for storage use cases,
[00:38:08] SPEAKER_00: but not many blockchains that were built for payments use
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_00: cases, which have their own.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_00: It's hundreds of very small decisions that add up
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_00: to a materially improved experience
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_00: if you want to build payment infrastructure.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_00: Salana people say Salana solves this.
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_01: It's the blockchain built for scalability.
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_01: Salana is a great blockchain for a lot of use cases,
[00:38:34] SPEAKER_00: but it's still not great for payments.
[00:38:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_00: Maybe a geeky, very geeky take on this.
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_02: If you go through the history as very early Bitcoin
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_02: is, I think, the reemergence of peer-to-peer computing
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_02: from the late 90s early odds, where instead of these being
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_02: volunteer networks, like TORAs or others,
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_02: this is now we've built incentivization into peer-to-peer.
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_02: So you have a means of incentivizing resource coordination
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_02: globally through these networks.
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_02: So that's step one.
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_02: I think step two with Ethereum is we've
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_02: gone from a single-purpose chain, Bitcoin,
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_02: to now actually a programmable chain.
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_02: So this is akin to one-millimeter architecture.
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_02: You move from fixed programs to you
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_02: can now store the program separately from the compute.
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_02: And you can have the computer do anything.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_02: And so these are like, TORAs are actually
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_02: a very complete chain, and Ethereum
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_02: is the world computer in that regard.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_02: And I think the phase we're in now is scalability.
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_02: So this is the L2's, Solana, and also specialization.
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_02: And I think a lot of what crypto gets wrong
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_02: is a super tribal take.
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_02: Like the meme is, we want to bring on an X-Billion people.
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_02: But I think a lot of people don't mean it,
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_02: because if you bring on an X-Billion people,
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_02: then you are no longer the rebel fighting for this technology.
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_02: The technology gets accepted, which feels very hard.
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_02: But I think conversely, the appropriate concern
[00:39:58] is like we know how to build scalable systems,
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_02: just use a database.
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_02: Like they were great.
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_02: And so if we give away a lot of what has made these systems
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_02: janky, but has been needed for us to scale this technology,
[00:40:08] SPEAKER_02: and we re-centralize, then what was all this for anyways?
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_02: And this is I think a sensible way to say,
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_02: if crypto becomes solely regulatory arbitrage,
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_02: it'll have been because we've taken away a lot of things
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_02: that make these real special.
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_02: So I think some of the defensiveness around new chains
[00:40:25] comes from like three things.
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_02: It's like too many scam chains around,
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_02: and people being like, well, this is a new chain.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_02: It's probably a scam.
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_02: And instead of adding the X-KCD comic,
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_02: instead of adding your 15th standard,
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_02: just use one of the ones that's already here.
[00:40:37] SPEAKER_02: The second I think is a fear of, I've bled for this.
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_02: And now these new comers are going to take it away from me.
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_02: And I think the third really rational one
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_02: is like a concern that there are easy technical paths
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_02: to solving some of the inefficiencies
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_02: that blockchains introduce, but those come at a cost.
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_02: The UX can be better, but the questions of self-sovereign
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_02: TV centralization and so on are given up.
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_02: But at least the way I would see it is like,
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_02: tempo is another computing device.
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes the mobile phone is a great form factor
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_02: for doing a number of things.
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes the computer is.
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes rarely the iPad is.
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_02: But you need different computing forms to do these things.
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_02: I think tempo is a chain purpose-built for one use case.
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_02: And it doesn't mean it'll be good for everything.
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_02: But conversely, it doesn't mean the other things
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_02: are particularly good for that.
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_02: Either payments being.
[00:41:27] Yeah, I think it's interesting where you see these.
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_00: This isn't a blockchain-specific thing,
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_00: but you see these pockets where there are moments in time
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_00: where a bunch of people build the same thing
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_00: to solve the same problem.
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_00: Because the problem becomes so acute that the world is like,
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_00: oh, this is obviously a thing
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_00: that someone needs to build the solution around to do it.
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_00: And if you zoom into the blockchain
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_00: where we've seen this now twice,
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_00: where a couple years ago,
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_00: everyone was building scalable blockchains,
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_00: Sui and Aptos and Salona,
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_00: and all of these kind of came out right around
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_00: like the same time period to solve the scalability problems
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_00: of Ethereum and Bitcoin.
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_00: And then now we're going through the same moment
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_00: where everyone's realizing that those blockchains
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_00: that were previously created were really good,
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_00: but not great for payments use cases.
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_00: And we have tempo and others coming out
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_00: to solve the payments use cases and all of them seemingly
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_00: coming out and going to market at the same time,
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_00: which is a good thing for the blockchain ecosystem
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_00: because one or many of these will solve these problems.
[00:42:29] And this was a part of the conversations
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_02: that we had at Privy when talking to Stripe about M&A,
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_02: which was like water conditions under which we think
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_02: we can be successful here.
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_02: And I think one of them was
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_02: they need to be able to work with competitive endeavors
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_02: and have us competitive to Stripe itself.
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_02: And no offense to the bridge as well.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_02: And I think the point was to say
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_02: it's way too early in market development
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_02: to try and verticalize the stack part of the core value prop
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_02: of the stack is that actually it's like layered
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_02: and you can assemble it in the way
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_02: that best fits your use case.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_02: And I think at least the fear that I'm seeing
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_02: is people thinking, well, this is a play
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_02: at owning the entire thing as opposed to owning modules
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_02: that you can intercompose that I hope
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_02: for the sake of us being useful to Stripe.
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_02: That Stripe will compose so that Stripe users
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_02: get a really great experience leveraging bridge leveraging
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_02: Privy, but where Privy and Bridge customers
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_02: can use what the fuck they want
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_02: to get the best possible experience
[00:43:22] SPEAKER_02: for their use case and their users.
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_02: So that's at least part of what I've been excited about
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_02: but I think has taken talking to my team and so on
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_02: about this is how we'll work with Temple
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_02: and this is how we won't.
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_02: I think it's like if you're serious
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_01: about all these layers of the stack,
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_01: you can't bind them all together
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: because just like there's no way you're going to get that much.
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_01: Microsoft is serious about the office suite.
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_01: They're going to have it run on Mac and Windows
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: because you're just not going to get meaning
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_01: for a market shareer from Office suite otherwise.
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_01: And beyond that, like Microsoft,
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_02: at this point has its own laptops
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_02: but they're not building their own chips.
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_02: Maybe they are, but the point is you can't verticalize
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_02: the entire computer.
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_02: They're not building their own laptops
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_01: that are around Windows after it, yeah.
[00:44:02] Ultimately, we want these blockchains
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_00: to solve payments use cases.
[00:44:07] Well, you know, folks are only going to build
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_00: payments use cases around infrastructure
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_00: that they feel like is open and neutral.
[00:44:14] There's not a world where there's like a JP Morgan chain
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_00: and a Stripe chain and a Bank of America chain
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_00: and there's like a thousand, you know,
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_00: unique company blockchains that's not going to happen.
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_02: But the one thing I think I'll note is a lot of the things
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_02: that are being solved by Temple
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_02: are like theoretically possible on any other chain.
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_02: But I think this is one thing
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_02: that we often get wrong in the space
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_02: which is the gap between the theoretically possible
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_02: and the actually true.
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_02: And so of the like, you know, temple features
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_02: that I know our customers are excited about
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_02: the ability to like sponsor gas with any asset,
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_02: the ability to have like batch transactions
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_02: built into the chain, you know,
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_02: really reliable like throughput
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_02: where transactions aren't getting dropped
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_02: or priority lanes for payments
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_02: where you're not paying more
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_02: because something happened on the chain.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_02: All this stuff is theoretically possible elsewhere
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_02: but I think making it a primary purpose of the chain
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_02: and making it something that comes out of the box with it
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_02: ends up leading to a very different developer experience
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_02: if you're willing with it.
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_02: And so I, you know, touch on the most controversial
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_00: of all of those, which is decentralization.
[00:45:17] SPEAKER_02: And nobody, yeah.
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_02: And I think that's the two sides are like,
[00:45:20] SPEAKER_02: if you work, I think the set of launch partners
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_02: that Temple has is exceedingly exciting
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_02: because if you build for these customers
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_02: has been super true of how previous sought to build
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_02: which is we will build for customers.
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_02: They will dictate our product roadmap in a very real way
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_02: and that is how we stay away from like shiny objects
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_02: and we're building stuff that no one actually cares to use.
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_02: And I think if Temple can do that
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_02: and deliver for the partners that they have,
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_02: they'll build an exceedingly useful payment chain.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_02: I think it comes at the risk of actually over centralizing
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_02: and I think the real question is over, you know,
[00:45:53] SPEAKER_02: two year, three year journey,
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_02: can they make good on actually decentralizing the validator set
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_02: and the people who are running, you know,
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_02: transaction validation on Temple altogether?
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_01: Doesn't this get to the related question,
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_01: which is like, nobody really knows
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_01: how a token should be valued.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_01: And in particular, it's not clear,
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_01: it's at least never being clear to me
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_01: that you could have 10 times the transaction volume
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_01: on Ethereum or a hundred times the transaction volume
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_01: on Ethereum and no one can really tell you mathematically
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_01: what that should correspond to in terms of
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_01: the Ethereum token price.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: And I think if you try to reason about it,
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_02: bombs up on like this is how much value
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_02: will accrue to the underlying token holder.
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_02: This is what's so interesting about the dynamics,
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_02: like Ethereum, I think, is vastly underperformed
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_02: its utility as an artwork.
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's like a value capture value creation.
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_00: And like Ethereum,
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_00: wild value creation, like of all the blockchains,
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_00: minimal value capture,
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_00: whereas there are a bunch of others
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_00: where, you know, like Salon is probably perfect,
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_00: you know, value creation, value capture.
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_00: And then there's some others where there's like,
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_00: very little value creation, lots of value capture.
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_00: You should name them.
[00:46:58] SPEAKER_02: Ah, that's where I think Bitcoin, at least,
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_02: is very simple.
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we know what we're valuing.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_00: It's a value by the market in that way.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it goes.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and Salon.
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it all depends on what your reference point is.
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_00: Is your reference point other crypto assets
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_00: or is your reference point companies?
[00:47:15] SPEAKER_00: Right, right, right.
[00:47:17] Why is crypto so tribal?
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_01: Is it just because people,
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_01: it's as if everyone was a shareholder in their soccer team
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_01: and like people are constantly starting new soccer teams?
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_01: Is that basically what's going on?
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_01: I think there's two reasons.
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_02: I think one people's relationship to money
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_02: is very complicated.
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_02: And I think, you know, as a French person in the US,
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_02: like it's stark to see the difference
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_02: between how people interact with money as a thing.
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_02: And so I think it is that.
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_02: It is like soccer teams and a self of identification
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_02: with something that's like quasi-religious,
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_02: especially because like, you know,
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_02: working in crypto for the last decade
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_02: has been just being rejected time and again
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_02: by like anyone else, like, you know,
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_02: that you can tell how the crypto market is going
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_02: by how people describe what they do.
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_02: I work in, you know, tech or in fintech or,
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_02: but I think being part of a leper colony for long enough
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_02: creates really strong bonds of kinship of others.
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_02: And then on top of that, you've got money.
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_02: And that creates, I think, insane amount of tribalism
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_02: where you feel like if anybody else succeed,
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_02: it comes at your detriment.
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_02: If we're meant to share a separate together.
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and I mean, I think crypto being so zero sum
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_02: is such a great shame
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_02: because there's such an opportunity to make this
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_02: to be my mindset.
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_02: It might set a bad excuse.
[00:48:32] SPEAKER_02: No, it's not, it shouldn't be.
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_02: It's very positive some, right?
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_02: But I think we all act as though someone else
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_02: succeeding means we are doing less well.
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_02: Yes, yeah.
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_02: What has changed in your guys' world's post-genius act?
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_01: On our side, it has been this incredible tailwind
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_00: to our business that the benefits of stablecoins
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_00: have not changed, you know, you can.
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_00: And they were legal before, so it's funny.
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_00: They think it's not a technical change to your business.
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like the building of global products
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_00: and the economic benefits of using stablecoins
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_00: across border opportunities of stablecoins,
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_00: all of these benefits were there,
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_00: but the perceived risk of engaging
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_00: with stablecoins or issuing stablecoins was really high.
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_00: So it made ever uncomfortable
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_01: with doing stuff with stablecoins?
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes.
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_00: It purely like in people's ROI, right?
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_00: You know, it lowered the risk upfront
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_00: and increased the...
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_00: There's like an official statement
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_01: from the US government that's stablecoins now.
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_01: Yes, and so that's the first thing that happened.
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_00: And the second thing that happened is,
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_00: you know, we launched this open issuance platform
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: because now all these folks are interested
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_00: in launching stablecoins,
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_00: and now people realize there's license for them
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_00: to participate in the market,
[00:49:41] SPEAKER_00: and this market is likely going to be very big
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_00: and a permanent part of the US financial ecosystem.
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_01: Describe the open issuance strategy
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_01: and early customers and just like, what's going on there?
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we have...
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_00: Bridge was sort of predicated on the belief
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_00: that one stablecoin is gonna be important,
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_00: and then two that there would be many of them.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_00: And our belief that there would be many of them was,
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: you know, just purely based on like,
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_00: companies acting in a self-interested manner,
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_00: and that they're gonna want to control the infrastructure
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_00: on top of which they're built,
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_00: and they're gonna want the underlying economics
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_00: of the stablecoin.
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_00: And importantly, this has not been the case up to now,
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_01: where it's mostly being US, DC, and Tether.
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_01: It's like we're most stablecoin down, so...
[00:50:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and it was all US, DC, all Tether for a long time,
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_00: and that was because the perceived risk
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_00: of issuing a stablecoin, creating a stablecoin,
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_00: doing that was really high.
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_00: And we then, over the last, you know,
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_00: basically year have been building this open issuance platform
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_00: that makes it really easy for any platform to come to us
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_00: to issue their own stablecoin,
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_00: so that they can access the underlying economic benefits,
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_00: and they can control the money on top of which,
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_00: whatever financial experience they want is built.
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_01: So who is issuing their own stablecoin,
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_01: and who should issue their own stablecoin?
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_01: Like, who listening to this should be like,
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_01: I should issue a stablecoin?
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_01: I mean, everybody who's sitting on top of money,
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_00: they should issue a stablecoin.
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_00: That's the market, is all money at rest.
[00:51:06] SPEAKER_00: And today, we're issuing stablecoins with phantom,
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_00: we're issuing stablecoins with metamass,
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_00: we're issuing a stablecoin for hyperliquid.
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_00: Is your arms are leaving crypto wallets
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_01: in the first two cases, and a trading platform?
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_01: This has been an interesting new op-le that we've seen,
[00:51:24] which is a lot, you know, one of the things
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_02: that we find really important is to serve both,
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_02: you know, traditional businesses,
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_02: who are otherwise uninterested in crypto wallets
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_02: and the benefits that crypto gets them,
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_02: and then crypto businesses.
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_02: And I think both have like, are gonna be big businesses.
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_02: Oh, I mean, one of them already are,
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_02: and crypto businesses will continue to grow.
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_02: But I think it's really important to serve both
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_02: because you've early adopters in the crypto businesses
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_02: who are the first to do these things,
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_02: that then set the rails for this is how it's done for everyone else.
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_02: I think genius has at least opened it up.
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_02: So you have a lot more traditional businesses
[00:51:53] SPEAKER_02: engaging as early adopters
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_02: and willing to be early adopters at a tech itself.
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like what we see on the adoption curve
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_00: is you had a lot of the crypto businesses,
[00:52:00] SPEAKER_00: you know, the phantoms, the metamass coming
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_00: and issuing stablecoins, issuing stablecoins first.
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_00: We very quickly see the fintechs coming after them,
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_00: and this is like any of those folks
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_00: who are building a global neo bank,
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_00: they're sitting on top of stablecoins.
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_00: They're sitting on top of millions,
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_00: tens of millions, hundreds of millions,
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_00: billions of dollars of stablecoins,
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_00: and they can literally just swap them out
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_00: and all of a sudden earn, you know, 4%,
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_00: all of those balances,
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_00: it is extremely economically rational for them to do that.
[00:52:27] SPEAKER_00: Is the yield the only reason
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_00: what you would want to do?
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_00: It is a business sitting on a balance.
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_00: No, the other really big reason is that
[00:52:34] SPEAKER_00: then you control your money.
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_00: And so, and that manifests in two ways.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_00: So one is, let's say you want to build on a specific blockchain.
[00:52:42] Let's say you want to build on tempo
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_00: or you want to build on arc
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_00: or you want to build on sweet
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_00: or you want to build on apto's or have you.
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_00: If it's your stablecoin,
[00:52:50] SPEAKER_00: you can guarantee that it will be available to you
[00:52:52] SPEAKER_00: or maybe you want to build your own blockchain.
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_00: You can guarantee that your asset will be available
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_00: wherever you move.
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_00: It's on the program.
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_00: Wherever you move.
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_00: And then the second thing is that
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_00: you control all of the fundamental economics of it.
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_00: So right now, a lot of stablecoins
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_00: like Tether, for instance, charges burn fees.
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_00: When you move out of that stablecoin.
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_00: So let's say you build a giant platform
[00:53:15] SPEAKER_00: on top of a stablecoin.
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_00: And then over time, that stablecoin changes the economic game.
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_00: And now all of a sudden, in order to move in and out of it
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_00: there are additional fees.
[00:53:24] SPEAKER_00: Now all of a sudden to move in and out of it.
[00:53:26] SPEAKER_00: There are delays if you want it, you know,
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_00: if you want it free, but if you want it fast,
[00:53:30] SPEAKER_00: you have to pay more for it.
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_00: All the economics that are building on the platform,
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_00: like it's not that different than being Zenga
[00:53:35] SPEAKER_00: and building on Facebook.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_00: You know, and then all of a sudden Facebook is like,
[00:53:38] SPEAKER_00: oh, you're making more money than we are.
[00:53:41] SPEAKER_00: Like why don't we take that money?
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_00: And-
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_00: It produces general platform dependence,
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_01: which can be economic, but can be roadmap and all that.
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_01: When it feels like the leap from I want to use stablecoins,
[00:53:49] SPEAKER_02: should I build my own?
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_02: This is if you already convinced that you want to use stablecoins
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_02: these are the advantages of building your own.
[00:53:53] SPEAKER_02: Like do you have the pitch for the people
[00:53:55] SPEAKER_02: who have balances in a chase account?
[00:53:59] SPEAKER_02: And are generally saying, well, I have a earning yield.
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_02: Like my savings account kind of works.
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_02: Like what's the pitch for the business
[00:54:04] SPEAKER_02: that is otherwise not using stablecoins at all?
[00:54:07] SPEAKER_00: So I think that ultimately all corporate treasury
[00:54:10] SPEAKER_00: is we'll move into stablecoins.
[00:54:12] SPEAKER_00: So like let's say you're a large global company
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_00: and you have a business and I was actually talking to it
[00:54:17] SPEAKER_00: to one such company, you have a business in the US
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_00: and then you have a business in Brazil.
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_00: And in order to move money from the US to Brazil,
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_00: you actually, because of the way your entities
[00:54:28] SPEAKER_00: are set up, you need to move it from the US
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_00: to Ireland, Ireland to Singapore, Singapore to Brazil.
[00:54:32] SPEAKER_00: You know, today that swift, settle, swift, settle,
[00:54:35] SPEAKER_00: swift, settle.
[00:54:36] SPEAKER_00: In the future, you should just tokenize your treasury,
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_00: set up wallets and all balances, click a button
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_00: and it goes one, two, three, four, down into thing.
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_00: And that should be your own stablecoin
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_00: because you don't want your balances coming gold
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_00: with everyone else and you want access to the yield.
[00:54:50] That's very good analogy where, yeah,
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_01: see for corporate treasure, they then have their own system
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_01: for kind of managing their treasury.
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_01: But importantly, people think, won't this be crazy
[00:55:00] SPEAKER_01: if there are thousands, 10,000 stablecoins?
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_01: Part of the vision is that they're all introoperable, right?
[00:55:04] SPEAKER_01: Yes, there will be ultimately these stablecoins
[00:55:08] SPEAKER_00: and we'll recede into the background purely as infrastructure.
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_00: And I believe that in a couple years, today,
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_00: you look at a product and you're like,
[00:55:17] SPEAKER_00: oh, that's a stablecoin balance and that's a dollar balance
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_00: and it's like another FX out there.
[00:55:21] SPEAKER_00: And actually, there are many because you could have a wallet
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_00: in that wallet, you could have US dollars
[00:55:25] SPEAKER_00: and you could have USDC on Salona and USDC on Ethan,
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_00: USDT on Tron and so on.
[00:55:30] SPEAKER_00: But so is there right analogy for people?
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_01: Because I think when people hear,
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_01: everyone's gonna have their own stablecoin,
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_01: currently, stablecoins are very different.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: It's a big thing.
[00:55:41] SPEAKER_01: They're very hard boundaries between them.
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_01: Maybe people's mental model should be like,
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_01: you have money in different bank,
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_01: like with different banks and moving money between banks
[00:55:51] SPEAKER_01: isn't completely instant and trivial,
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_01: but it's pretty trivial.
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_01: And that's maybe the mental model.
[00:55:57] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and I think it will be like completely trivial
[00:56:01] SPEAKER_00: to move money already from moving money to metamastafantam
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_00: with stablecoins.
[00:56:06] SPEAKER_00: We issue it's a seamless transition
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_00: and when you move from one to the other,
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_00: it settles this cash or or MUSD.
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_00: And that's gonna be the case is money pings all around the world
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_00: when it comes to Stripe and then when it goes to Walmart
[00:56:17] SPEAKER_00: then when it goes to Amazon and so on,
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_00: it will just change shape and be attributed
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_00: to each of the different entities.
[00:56:23] SPEAKER_00: How about you, the genius question,
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_01: how's the change in your life?
[00:56:26] SPEAKER_01: So we're a software business in this regard.
[00:56:28] SPEAKER_02: I feel very grateful.
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_02: I think compared to both of you,
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_02: we have a much simpler life than you do.
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_02: And we're not involved in the flow funds.
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_02: And so we build software, we build really key management
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_02: and then everything that comes with it
[00:56:40] SPEAKER_02: which enables these digital asset accounts.
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_02: So what it's really done for us is it's opened up
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_02: a lot of new business for us of companies
[00:56:50] SPEAKER_02: who are not willing to engage.
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_02: So much broader US customer base,
[00:56:54] SPEAKER_02: much broader Fintech base and then much larger companies
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_02: who are now engaging in this.
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_02: How much are you excited about journey Stripe?
[00:57:01] Many things.
[00:57:03] SPEAKER_02: We have a strong interweaving journey
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_02: with Zach where I think,
[00:57:09] SPEAKER_02: so the first time I met Zach was when he was talking about
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_02: what Bridge was and we all thought this
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_02: is a crazy idea, a stable concept, not a thing.
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_02: The second time I met Zach,
[00:57:19] SPEAKER_02: I think I was your reference column for Sequoia.
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:23] SPEAKER_00: We're our joint investment.
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sure, Sequoia.
[00:57:26] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:57:27] SPEAKER_02: It was like, do you wanna talk to Zach?
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_02: I feel like it'd be helpful for him to understand
[00:57:30] SPEAKER_02: what we're like to work with.
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:32] SPEAKER_02: And then the third time was you were my reference for Ribbit.
[00:57:36] SPEAKER_02: And then the fourth time,
[00:57:39] SPEAKER_02: we were doing a lot of work together
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_02: and I think you had a choice sentence
[00:57:43] SPEAKER_02: which was something along the lines of,
[00:57:45] in the next two years, we will either work together
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_02: or we will compete very heavily.
[00:57:50] SPEAKER_02: And it wasn't set as a threat.
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_02: It was set as a pure statement of fact,
[00:57:54] SPEAKER_02: which I think was factual in fact.
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:57] SPEAKER_02: Because what you guys were building was so close to each other.
[00:58:00] We're building very different products
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_02: in so many ways.
[00:58:02] SPEAKER_02: I would argue that you guys are building like the programs.
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_02: You guys are building stablecoins, our programs.
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_02: No, but geographicly close.
[00:58:07] SPEAKER_02: But geographically close.
[00:58:08] SPEAKER_02: And there's a sense that as you expand,
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_02: you'll wanna move into each other's spaces.
[00:58:12] SPEAKER_02: So I think this is part of the answer.
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_02: It's the least romantic part.
[00:58:16] SPEAKER_02: But the least romantic part of the answer was,
[00:58:18] SPEAKER_02: there was a real sense of if we wanna move fast
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_02: and we wanna have real impact in the space,
[00:58:24] SPEAKER_02: there's deep value to bundles
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_02: and to being able to layer our software
[00:58:29] SPEAKER_02: with stablecoin orchestration, stablecoin issuance,
[00:58:32] SPEAKER_02: with traditional fiat money movement
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_02: and rails with the networks that Stripe is built across
[00:58:37] SPEAKER_02: like marketplaces and merchants.
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_02: And so there was a sense of we can take
[00:58:40] SPEAKER_02: what our 10 year roadmaps for us with many possibilities of death
[00:58:44] SPEAKER_02: and turn these into two year roadmaps
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_02: where the expected value that we have in the world
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_02: becomes much, much greater if we're able to become
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_02: part of a whole that can serve something much more complete.
[00:58:57] SPEAKER_02: So that was the first one.
[00:58:58] SPEAKER_02: I think the second one,
[00:58:59] SPEAKER_02: I'm just gonna sound very brown nosy, so sorry.
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_02: And it's like a lot of how we've shaped Pravee
[00:59:04] SPEAKER_02: was looking at Stripe as a business
[00:59:06] SPEAKER_02: and what meant to take very complex things
[00:59:08] SPEAKER_02: and make them more simple
[00:59:10] SPEAKER_02: and hopefully work towards elegance of APIs
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_02: in order to unlock things that otherwise would not be possible.
[00:59:17] SPEAKER_02: And so at least from, you know,
[00:59:19] SPEAKER_02: in a world in which we were going to be acquired,
[00:59:22] SPEAKER_02: who would the acquire or be?
[00:59:24] SPEAKER_02: I think it romantically made a lot of sense for us
[00:59:26] SPEAKER_02: that this would be it.
[00:59:27] SPEAKER_02: And then frankly, going back to Zach,
[00:59:30] SPEAKER_02: I think having seen him go through the journey
[00:59:31] SPEAKER_02: and talking to him about what it was like,
[00:59:35] SPEAKER_02: thumb of a reassuring,
[00:59:35] SPEAKER_02: it felt like he had sort of locked us so we could run,
[00:59:39] SPEAKER_02: I don't know how you would do this,
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_02: but basically he had done all of the hard things
[00:59:43] SPEAKER_02: of figuring out M&A and integration
[00:59:45] SPEAKER_02: and we got to sort of follow him
[00:59:47] SPEAKER_02: with the road.
[00:59:48] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:59:49] SPEAKER_02: For you to go now.
[00:59:49] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:59:50] SPEAKER_02: How about you, Zach?
[00:59:51] SPEAKER_00: So first when we started talking,
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_00: I didn't think our company was acquirable.
[00:59:58] Like I just didn't, I thought we were so optimistic
[01:00:02] SPEAKER_00: about what was possible with stablecoins.
[01:00:06] SPEAKER_00: No one else could be more optimistic.
[01:00:07] SPEAKER_00: No one could be more,
[01:00:09] SPEAKER_00: there was like the Venn diagram of companies
[01:00:12] SPEAKER_00: that were as optimistic and had like the capital behind it,
[01:00:16] SPEAKER_00: you know, and the tolerance to push this space forward
[01:00:20] SPEAKER_00: was like, I didn't think there was anybody
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_00: in that intersection.
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_00: So I think as we went through the process,
[01:00:25] SPEAKER_00: we, Sean and I were kind of like the whole time
[01:00:29] SPEAKER_00: like this is like not real.
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_00: And then over time it became pretty apparent
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_00: that it was real and there was like a very,
[01:00:40] SPEAKER_00: like a strong shared belief in how big the opportunity
[01:00:45] SPEAKER_00: ahead was.
[01:00:46] SPEAKER_00: And I feel like we have pushed the stablecoin space forward
[01:00:50] SPEAKER_00: in this like, like pretty material way over the last two years
[01:00:53] SPEAKER_00: and we wanted to continue pushing the space forward
[01:00:57] SPEAKER_00: and pushing it as far as it could possibly go.
[01:01:01] And it was pretty clear that that was like much more possible
[01:01:05] SPEAKER_00: to do that together than to do it, to do it alone.
[01:01:08] SPEAKER_00: I mean, there's just a lot of things like our stablecoin
[01:01:10] SPEAKER_00: issuance platform that we just launched.
[01:01:12] SPEAKER_00: An amazing opportunity.
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_00: We could launch that as an independent business,
[01:01:16] SPEAKER_00: but it is a very different opportunity,
[01:01:18] SPEAKER_00: a very different set of customers
[01:01:20] SPEAKER_00: that are interested in working with us as a result.
[01:01:24] Well, a question I have that, you know, Austin,
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_02: my co-founder and I have been asking is like,
[01:01:28] SPEAKER_02: how has your view of M&A changed over the last call
[01:01:31] SPEAKER_02: at year through a few iterations?
[01:01:33] SPEAKER_02: I mean, obviously you've not had any before.
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_02: Hopefully you will do M&A post-fact.
[01:01:38] SPEAKER_02: We've not discussed it to you from the prospect,
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_02: but like, what's changed about your old view
[01:01:42] SPEAKER_02: on this is how we should acquire
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_02: and integrate companies within Stripe?
[01:01:45] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:01:47] At some level, Bridge and Privy make me
[01:01:49] SPEAKER_01: much more bullish on M&A because we had an idea going in
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_01: and Stripe was very much taking crypto and stablecoin seriously.
[01:02:01] SPEAKER_01: And there's no way we would collectively be where we are now.
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_01: Or there's no way Stripe would be where we collectively are now.
[01:02:09] SPEAKER_01: Had we not bought Bridge and Privy?
[01:02:12] SPEAKER_01: Now, I think NAS, everything is like crypto
[01:02:17] SPEAKER_01: where I think the cultural difference
[01:02:20] SPEAKER_01: between companies like Stripe that essentially grew up
[01:02:24] SPEAKER_01: before crypto.
[01:02:25] SPEAKER_01: Technically, the Bitcoin, by people who have perceived Stripe,
[01:02:26] SPEAKER_01: but you know, for all in terms of purposes grew up before crypto.
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_01: And more crypto native companies.
[01:02:32] SPEAKER_01: I basically think that cultural difference is useful
[01:02:35] SPEAKER_01: and part of what we are bringing in is that culture.
[01:02:38] SPEAKER_01: And that's probably not true in other pure,
[01:02:41] SPEAKER_01: like, you know, we know how to build software
[01:02:43] SPEAKER_01: and you know, we know how to build the other things.
[01:02:44] SPEAKER_01: And so it makes me more bullish because of how well
[01:02:50] SPEAKER_01: it has worked broadly speaking.
[01:02:53] SPEAKER_01: I think the other real nuance is like,
[01:02:59] Oracle buys companies for, you know, 15 times PE
[01:03:04] SPEAKER_01: when they're growing at 15 to 20% in a mature
[01:03:08] SPEAKER_01: industry and then they pull out 10% at the cost.
[01:03:10] SPEAKER_01: Blah blah blah.
[01:03:11] SPEAKER_01: But it's like this total rinsing repeat
[01:03:13] SPEAKER_01: of very established, you know, companies
[01:03:16] SPEAKER_01: and they know how to do that really well.
[01:03:17] SPEAKER_01: And they're exceptional at it, by the way.
[01:03:18] SPEAKER_01: They're almost like a quasi-private equity firm,
[01:03:21] SPEAKER_01: but it's a different thing.
[01:03:23] SPEAKER_01: Whereas I think the real art is how do you grow
[01:03:28] new initiatives internally through acquisitions
[01:03:32] SPEAKER_01: and do that well?
[01:03:33] SPEAKER_01: And there is priority here.
[01:03:35] SPEAKER_01: And you know, we always try to learn from that.
[01:03:38] SPEAKER_01: Google is a good example of YouTube is now a $50 billion
[01:03:42] SPEAKER_01: revenue business and I believe they literally had no revenue.
[01:03:44] SPEAKER_01: I mean, they were hemorrhaging money when Google acquired them,
[01:03:47] SPEAKER_01: but importantly, they had no revenue.
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_01: And now it's like one of the crown jewels in Google.
[01:03:51] SPEAKER_01: And actually, as you look across a huge amount of Google,
[01:03:54] SPEAKER_01: it was all acquired in at this incredibly early stage,
[01:03:58] SPEAKER_01: you know, there were acquisitions that became Google Maps
[01:04:02] SPEAKER_01: and separately Google Earth and, you know, Google Docs
[01:04:05] SPEAKER_01: and all this kind of stuff.
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_01: And there's actually some good acquired episodes on this recently.
[01:04:09] SPEAKER_01: And I think that is a different skill to acquire things
[01:04:13] SPEAKER_01: that are growing, you know, 10X and build those businesses.
[01:04:17] SPEAKER_01: And a big part of the art of this, you guys have seen,
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_01: is companies are sort of standardization machines
[01:04:27] SPEAKER_01: because like there's a way they do things, right?
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_01: And when a large company makes an acquisition,
[01:04:35] SPEAKER_01: the natural tendency is like, okay, great, you know,
[01:04:38] SPEAKER_01: we're going to do things this driveway now.
[01:04:40] SPEAKER_01: And there are some places where it's valuable to do things this driveway.
[01:04:44] SPEAKER_01: Like there are certain things that is good at,
[01:04:46] SPEAKER_01: but it's an incredible art to, okay,
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_01: these are things that we're going to standardize.
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_01: These are things where, yeah, you know,
[01:04:54] SPEAKER_01: you guys are going to stay doing it the startup way
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_01: and that's more free-bealing than the driveway.
[01:04:58] SPEAKER_01: And that's great.
[01:04:59] SPEAKER_01: When we close the deal, I like reached out to a bunch of folks
[01:05:02] SPEAKER_00: who had sold their companies
[01:05:04] SPEAKER_00: to get feedback on like, well, how did you like it?
[01:05:06] SPEAKER_00: Was it good?
[01:05:07] SPEAKER_00: Was it not good?
[01:05:09] SPEAKER_00: And there was like, for sure,
[01:05:10] SPEAKER_00: there was like a fair share of horror stories
[01:05:13] SPEAKER_00: and regret and tears.
[01:05:15] SPEAKER_00: But the person who was the most impactful
[01:05:17] SPEAKER_00: was this guy who leads integrations at Google.
[01:05:21] SPEAKER_00: And he had seen, you know, YouTube and Nest and Waze
[01:05:25] SPEAKER_00: and deep mind and, you know, all these,
[01:05:29] SPEAKER_00: like really successful and some unsuccessful.
[01:05:32] SPEAKER_00: And one of the things that he told me,
[01:05:35] SPEAKER_00: because I was coming in, you know,
[01:05:36] SPEAKER_00: like I think any founder who comes in and comes in
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_00: is like you like running your company,
[01:05:40] SPEAKER_00: you think you're like pretty good at running your company,
[01:05:42] SPEAKER_00: you know, there was a reason why your company was bought.
[01:05:44] SPEAKER_00: And so you kind of want to like keep running your company
[01:05:46] SPEAKER_00: and like doing your thing.
[01:05:48] SPEAKER_00: And he was telling me that like,
[01:05:50] SPEAKER_00: now he's seen basically all these acquisitions.
[01:05:55] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, you buy a company
[01:05:57] SPEAKER_00: because you believe that there is some way
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_00: in which, you know, one plus one equals more than two.
[01:06:04] SPEAKER_00: And so if you totally stay independent
[01:06:06] SPEAKER_00: and you don't do any form of integration,
[01:06:08] SPEAKER_00: there is like one plus one equals maybe two,
[01:06:11] SPEAKER_00: but probably less than two.
[01:06:12] SPEAKER_00: Almost certainly.
[01:06:14] SPEAKER_00: Like, definitely, you're setting yourself up
[01:06:16] SPEAKER_00: for less than two.
[01:06:16] SPEAKER_00: And so at some point in time during the journey,
[01:06:20] SPEAKER_00: that there is like this moment that comes
[01:06:22] SPEAKER_00: and it could be in your one or it could be in your five
[01:06:25] SPEAKER_00: or whatever, where it becomes clear
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_00: that the two need to come together to like create that value.
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_00: Which means you have to learn how to use the stuff
[01:06:34] SPEAKER_01: that the large company has
[01:06:35] SPEAKER_01: because otherwise, why are you working together?
[01:06:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and it doesn't happen right away,
[01:06:39] SPEAKER_00: but at some point it becomes clear
[01:06:41] SPEAKER_00: and then you need to lean into it.
[01:06:42] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:06:43] SPEAKER_00: And a great example of this is like deep mind at Google,
[01:06:47] SPEAKER_00: deep mind was a totally separate business,
[01:06:49] SPEAKER_00: separate everything for 10 years.
[01:06:51] SPEAKER_00: But now AI is like its thing and now it's one.
[01:06:54] SPEAKER_00: It's just.
[01:06:55] SPEAKER_00: And the art was like enabling it to stay its own thing
[01:07:00] SPEAKER_00: and like push forward the frontiers,
[01:07:02] SPEAKER_00: but as soon as we entered this moment,
[01:07:04] SPEAKER_00: bringing them together.
[01:07:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's like a bit of collective faith.
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_02: We can suspend this belief that the connection points
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_02: arise in ways that are organic.
[01:07:13] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:07:14] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:07:14] SPEAKER_02: A big part of my conviction is we think crypto-enabled transactions
[01:07:22] SPEAKER_01: are going to be a very large part of the economy
[01:07:26] SPEAKER_01: and just striped business in the relatively near future.
[01:07:30] SPEAKER_01: But then it's also the case that there isn't going to be
[01:07:33] SPEAKER_01: a crypto economy and a regular economy
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_01: and never the two shell needs.
[01:07:38] SPEAKER_01: And we're already seeing this.
[01:07:39] SPEAKER_01: Like one of my favorite, one of the most bullish
[01:07:40] SPEAKER_01: stablecoin things in my mind is the Felix Pago website.
[01:07:44] SPEAKER_01: Felix Pago is a reminthed app.
[01:07:45] SPEAKER_01: It's powered by stablecoins.
[01:07:46] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't mention stablecoins or crypto anywhere
[01:07:49] SPEAKER_01: on the website.
[01:07:49] SPEAKER_01: It talks about customer value.
[01:07:51] SPEAKER_01: It's nice integration spots happen things like that.
[01:07:53] SPEAKER_01: And so Felix Pago is just off-competing in the remittance
[01:07:56] SPEAKER_01: space.
[01:07:57] SPEAKER_01: And you're talking about neo-bank starts
[01:07:59] SPEAKER_01: and it integrates your fear balance,
[01:08:00] SPEAKER_01: your stablecoin balance.
[01:08:02] SPEAKER_01: And so we're just seeing this convergence.
[01:08:04] SPEAKER_01: And so I think our collective belief is, OK,
[01:08:08] SPEAKER_01: we can build something really compelling
[01:08:10] SPEAKER_01: on the infrastructure side here.
[01:08:12] SPEAKER_01: There's actually a lot to build.
[01:08:14] SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of scope to have a good offering in the markets.
[01:08:17] SPEAKER_01: And so that's why it ends up being better together.
[01:08:20] SPEAKER_01: And then the integration challenges again,
[01:08:22] SPEAKER_01: you have these separate companies, separate code bases.
[01:08:25] SPEAKER_01: And you're trying to integrate as you grow
[01:08:29] SPEAKER_01: like an absolute banjo.
[01:08:30] SPEAKER_01: That's just like, no, it's fun challenge, necessarily.
[01:08:32] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's so everything about it is so hard.
[01:08:35] SPEAKER_00: I did not appreciate how hard it is.
[01:08:38] SPEAKER_00: Even little things like our CRM is different from Stripe
[01:08:43] SPEAKER_00: CRM is different from your CRM.
[01:08:45] SPEAKER_00: I'm bringing those things.
[01:08:47] SPEAKER_00: So if we're all talking to the same customer,
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_00: who's on first?
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:08:51] SPEAKER_00: And we have acquired Bridge and Privy
[01:08:55] SPEAKER_01: at the inflection.
[01:08:57] SPEAKER_01: It's really working kink in the lifecycle,
[01:08:59] SPEAKER_01: where everyone talks about that hold on
[01:09:02] SPEAKER_01: for dear life startup stage.
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_01: And so then what you have, when you have an acquisition,
[01:09:06] SPEAKER_01: is you're at the hold on for dear life startup stage
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_01: if this thing really has product market fit.
[01:09:11] SPEAKER_01: Oh, and now we have to layer on a CRM migration
[01:09:15] SPEAKER_01: and all these other things.
[01:09:16] SPEAKER_01: And just no one has more bandwidth.
[01:09:19] SPEAKER_01: Most startups are already running at 120% capacity.
[01:09:23] SPEAKER_01: And so you can't add more things on,
[01:09:25] SPEAKER_01: which otherwise what makes John there?
[01:09:26] SPEAKER_01: CRM migration though, watch it come.
[01:09:28] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:09:29] SPEAKER_02: What was the, I'm curious on the other side,
[01:09:31] SPEAKER_02: obviously having been on the our side of the table.
[01:09:34] SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes.
[01:09:35] SPEAKER_02: What was it like on your side of the table?
[01:09:37] SPEAKER_02: Is there a good cut back opportunity
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_02: between like you and Patrick or like other people
[01:09:40] SPEAKER_02: on the Stripe side of the room?
[01:09:41] SPEAKER_02: Like there is a pro champion and there is a like,
[01:09:45] SPEAKER_02: what blanket as part of the acquisition talks?
[01:09:47] SPEAKER_02: How do you make decisions?
[01:09:49] Surprisingly no, where I think,
[01:09:52] SPEAKER_01: look, all of me, Patrick will, Rob,
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_01: we're all super bullish on crypto,
[01:09:59] SPEAKER_01: super bullish on you guys after we met you.
[01:10:02] SPEAKER_01: And so it's not like anyone is,
[01:10:04] SPEAKER_01: like I don't think they would survive the company
[01:10:05] SPEAKER_01: very long if someone's working out.
[01:10:06] SPEAKER_01: I don't know, I don't think this table going thing
[01:10:08] SPEAKER_01: is gonna be a thing.
[01:10:09] SPEAKER_01: And so the debate you're all this having
[01:10:14] SPEAKER_01: is do we build this in house?
[01:10:16] SPEAKER_01: Like for every acquisition,
[01:10:18] SPEAKER_01: there is some price that is too expensive.
[01:10:20] SPEAKER_01: And of course part of the challenge there
[01:10:21] SPEAKER_01: is early stage startups is just like so hard to put a number
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_01: on things like venture rounds.
[01:10:25] SPEAKER_01: It's like, you know what a surprise
[01:10:26] SPEAKER_01: like what people are paying at some level.
[01:10:28] SPEAKER_01: And so you end up doing a lot of math
[01:10:32] SPEAKER_01: and it kind of comes down to some amount of gut feel.
[01:10:35] SPEAKER_01: And yeah, there's a lot of spreadsheets backing up
[01:10:37] SPEAKER_01: that good feel, gut feel.
[01:10:40] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of it is about the founders and the team
[01:10:45] SPEAKER_01: because what you're buying is not what already exists.
[01:10:51] SPEAKER_01: Again, it's not like that or a late stage.
[01:10:53] SPEAKER_01: We're gonna buy a certain and this is the existing business
[01:10:55] SPEAKER_01: and customers and everything like that.
[01:10:56] SPEAKER_01: It's like we are going to build the leading crypto
[01:10:59] SPEAKER_01: infrastructure products together over the coming decade.
[01:11:03] SPEAKER_01: And there's just a lot of uncertainty in that.
[01:11:06] SPEAKER_01: So last question, just what do you guys project
[01:11:10] SPEAKER_01: the next two to three years looks like for each of you
[01:11:13] SPEAKER_01: on the product side and the business side?
[01:11:16] SPEAKER_02: I think like I don't know, it's been true thus far
[01:11:19] SPEAKER_02: and we're still early obviously,
[01:11:21] SPEAKER_02: but it's been true thus far that like every year
[01:11:23] SPEAKER_02: we look at the company that's completely unrecognizable
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_02: from the prior year.
[01:11:26] SPEAKER_02: And I think if we can keep that up for another three years,
[01:11:30] like we're really in business
[01:11:31] SPEAKER_02: and it's gonna be very interesting three years from now.
[01:11:33] SPEAKER_02: So I suspect the scale of customer and the amount
[01:11:38] of like call it household names who are not,
[01:11:40] SPEAKER_02: you know, it starts in many ways with Fintech
[01:11:42] SPEAKER_02: because they are the most exposed to money as a thing.
[01:11:45] SPEAKER_02: But I think my hope is that the amount of household names
[01:11:48] SPEAKER_02: and stable coins themselves become ubiquitous
[01:11:52] SPEAKER_02: where they are just a part of the fabric of reality
[01:11:54] SPEAKER_02: if you're interfacing with like, you know,
[01:11:55] SPEAKER_02: economic systems in the world.
[01:11:57] SPEAKER_02: One, I think I hope wallets become ubiquitous
[01:12:01] SPEAKER_02: whereby everybody has a means of owning
[01:12:03] SPEAKER_02: and controlling digital assets and being able to port them
[01:12:06] SPEAKER_02: across platforms and being able to put them to work
[01:12:08] SPEAKER_02: in ways we couldn't have imagined.
[01:12:10] SPEAKER_02: And then I hope I think there's a sort of two step going on
[01:12:15] SPEAKER_02: which is stripe itself becomes much more crypto native
[01:12:18] SPEAKER_02: and crypto kind of suffuses the entirety
[01:12:21] SPEAKER_02: of how the company operates.
[01:12:22] SPEAKER_02: And in like a few ways, which is it's like another rail
[01:12:25] SPEAKER_02: that stripe users can like choose to utilize
[01:12:27] SPEAKER_02: but also it is a superpower that like separate
[01:12:33] from being another rail is just a whole new means
[01:12:35] SPEAKER_02: that they get to tap into.
[01:12:36] SPEAKER_02: Like, you know, some stuff it's like, you know,
[01:12:38] SPEAKER_02: if you wanna do a stable coin sandwich
[01:12:39] SPEAKER_02: and move money from A to B,
[01:12:40] SPEAKER_02: there were other ways of doing it
[01:12:41] SPEAKER_02: that might not have been as good
[01:12:43] SPEAKER_02: but there are things that you can do now
[01:12:44] SPEAKER_02: with solid open issuance that you just could not have done before.
[01:12:48] SPEAKER_02: And then I also think like, hopefully stripe
[01:12:50] SPEAKER_02: is like the best purveyor of crypto tooling via, you know,
[01:12:56] SPEAKER_02: stripes efforts via the brands that it has
[01:12:59] SPEAKER_02: in Bridge and Prairie.
[01:13:00] SPEAKER_02: So my hope is that we're able to, at least on the Prairie side
[01:13:04] SPEAKER_02: grow the team really sensibly
[01:13:07] SPEAKER_02: to a place where we're both delivering extreme value
[01:13:10] SPEAKER_02: to like, standalone customers that we have
[01:13:12] SPEAKER_02: that we can dream of today, who are like really incorporating us
[01:13:15] SPEAKER_02: as a core part of their stack, like a Kint AWS
[01:13:18] SPEAKER_02: and level of importance.
[01:13:19] SPEAKER_02: And then also serving that through stripe
[01:13:21] SPEAKER_02: and enabling stripe products.
[01:13:23] That's a, yeah.
[01:13:24] Yeah, I mean, on, on, I agree with like a, you know,
[01:13:29] SPEAKER_00: what you said at the beginning really resonated like our company,
[01:13:31] SPEAKER_00: you know, same with Bridge, totally unrecognizable
[01:13:34] SPEAKER_00: versus last year or there or the year before before Bridge.
[01:13:37] SPEAKER_00: There really wasn't that much infrastructure,
[01:13:39] SPEAKER_00: really any infrastructure to build, you know,
[01:13:42] SPEAKER_00: financial experiences with stablecoins.
[01:13:45] SPEAKER_00: So that kind of means like, you know,
[01:13:47] SPEAKER_00: we started the company three years ago, our APIs were available
[01:13:50] SPEAKER_00: for like roughly two years.
[01:13:51] SPEAKER_00: So that means there's kind of only been like two years
[01:13:54] SPEAKER_00: ish of teams building at like the application layer
[01:13:59] SPEAKER_00: on top of, on top of stablecoins.
[01:14:02] SPEAKER_00: And so, you know, it's like I feel like I am like,
[01:14:05] SPEAKER_00: even though I live in this, like constantly reminded
[01:14:08] SPEAKER_00: of how early we are and how few applications have been built
[01:14:11] SPEAKER_00: and how few of the big problems that need to be solved
[01:14:15] SPEAKER_00: have been solved.
[01:14:16] SPEAKER_00: And I think what I'm most excited about is more
[01:14:19] SPEAKER_00: and more of those teams coming and building
[01:14:22] SPEAKER_00: on that application layer, which pushes the frontier
[01:14:25] SPEAKER_00: of stablecoins forward.
[01:14:26] SPEAKER_00: And you know, that then forces us to change our company,
[01:14:28] SPEAKER_00: change our APIs and change who and how we serve people.
[01:14:32] SPEAKER_00: I think I really agree with what you're saying,
[01:14:33] SPEAKER_01: which is people still have no idea how big stablecoins
[01:14:36] SPEAKER_01: are going to be.
[01:14:37] SPEAKER_01: And I think they discount us because it feels
[01:14:39] SPEAKER_01: like there's a lot of hype right now.
[01:14:40] SPEAKER_01: But we're going to look back when stablecoins
[01:14:43] SPEAKER_01: are a hundred times bigger.
[01:14:45] SPEAKER_01: And just think of this momentous, cute.
[01:14:47] SPEAKER_01: One question I have is whether they will infect
[01:14:50] SPEAKER_02: this appear.
[01:14:51] SPEAKER_02: And to me, at least it's one place where it's for companies
[01:14:53] SPEAKER_02: building on stablecoins really important
[01:14:54] SPEAKER_02: to maintain optionality.
[01:14:55] SPEAKER_02: Like, you know, the joke is something like Bitcoin
[01:14:58] SPEAKER_02: grows one death at a time, which is a person holding gold.
[01:15:02] SPEAKER_02: Dies.
[01:15:02] SPEAKER_02: And a new generation will decide to hold a digital equivalent.
[01:15:06] SPEAKER_02: Like, it's not just, I think, a difference in degree.
[01:15:09] SPEAKER_02: It is a difference in kind in a few different ways.
[01:15:12] SPEAKER_02: And so I think the question of, like, will it be branded
[01:15:14] SPEAKER_02: as stablecoins?
[01:15:15] SPEAKER_02: Will you just like lose track of the fact that it's
[01:15:17] SPEAKER_02: the underlying medium?
[01:15:18] SPEAKER_02: To me, that's a real question that, like, I'm interested.
[01:15:20] SPEAKER_02: And I can see both paths five years from now.
[01:15:23] SPEAKER_02: I think it's more likely that actually people will be more
[01:15:25] SPEAKER_02: aware of this infrastructure because it is unique
[01:15:27] SPEAKER_02: in different ways.
[01:15:28] SPEAKER_02: Interesting.
[01:15:29] SPEAKER_02: In the other camp.
[01:15:30] SPEAKER_02: I think it will just proceed into the background.
[01:15:34] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm more in Zaxcom because there's so many tech
[01:15:36] SPEAKER_01: improvements where, like, remember when I've
[01:15:38] SPEAKER_01: ever talked about Ajax?
[01:15:39] SPEAKER_01: Like, JavaScript's application.
[01:15:41] SPEAKER_01: The applications are still JavaScript web applications.
[01:15:46] SPEAKER_01: But we don't talk about Ajax anymore.
[01:15:48] SPEAKER_01: Or, you know, there's a time when all your iPods went
[01:15:51] SPEAKER_01: solid-station, didn't have a spinning hard disk in your
[01:15:53] SPEAKER_01: songs, didn't skip anymore.
[01:15:54] SPEAKER_01: But, like, it happened.
[01:15:56] SPEAKER_01: Life got better.
[01:15:57] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it was like a cloud.
[01:15:58] SPEAKER_01: Or, you know, our stablecoins, the cloud, or the
[01:16:01] SPEAKER_02: solids they drive, or our stablecoins, the computer.
[01:16:03] SPEAKER_02: Because we talk about the computer today.
[01:16:05] SPEAKER_02: I can, you know, you might have told me, well, you have
[01:16:07] SPEAKER_02: a spreadsheet, but I've got a human computer over here.
[01:16:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:16:10] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we do, and we don't talk about the computer, right?
[01:16:12] SPEAKER_01: Like, my car now unlocks when I walk up to us.
[01:16:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:16:18] SPEAKER_01: It's just a car.
[01:16:19] SPEAKER_01: But I think both.
[01:16:20] SPEAKER_02: I think your car is, like, you know, 38 computers.
[01:16:22] SPEAKER_02: And then you also do have your computer.
[01:16:23] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:24] SPEAKER_02: Potentially, that's how it happens.
[01:16:25] SPEAKER_02: For the most part.
[01:16:26] SPEAKER_02: And then you have to get a good speed and a week on fabric
[01:16:28] SPEAKER_02: of, like, reality.
[01:16:29] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:16:30] SPEAKER_02: But in some places, I think it'll be, like,
[01:16:32] SPEAKER_02: blinding that obvious.
[01:16:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:16:34] SPEAKER_01: Okay, we're going to do another one of these in five years
[01:16:36] SPEAKER_01: time, and we'll check back in on the, whether people are
[01:16:38] SPEAKER_01: still talking about stablecoins just by the
[01:16:40] SPEAKER_01: hundred next to the volume.
[01:16:41] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:16:42] Alrighty.
[01:16:43] Thank you guys.
