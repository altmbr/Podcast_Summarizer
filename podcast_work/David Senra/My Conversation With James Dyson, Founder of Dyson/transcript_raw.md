[00:00:00] You have a weird combination of like you build some of the greatest modern technology,
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_00: but you're you have the obsession with and love of like the past, which I think is very
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_00: interesting.
[00:00:12] Yeah, a healthy obsession of the past, I think, is I mean, I did last in Greek and ancient
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_01: history at school.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:00:19] And apparently I've known you used to talk, but it is interesting how Greek civilization
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_01: took place and how Roman civilization started, how it failed and how people governed,
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_01: all the gargies good, what a dictatorship is good, or democracies.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: And it's interesting and history repeats itself and it's repeating itself rather to quit
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: here at the moment.
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_01: So history is interesting.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_00: We were talking before we started recording.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_00: I have this obsession with reading everything that you have written.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_00: I read your first autobiography five times, your second one at least two times, but then
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_00: you know, people might know about this, but they don't know that you actually wrote a history
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_00: of great inventions.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_00: And what I noticed about this is it was published, I think you were writing this in like 2001.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_00: What caused you like, why did you do this?
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_00: You were building your company at the exact same time.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_01: Because I'm really interested in inventions, how they happened, who did them, what personalities
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_01: were behind them.
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_01: And they are inspiring stories.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_01: And luckily an editor of a big newspaper in Britain asked me to do it.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_01: So I agreed to do it.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: And actually we published it as a series of color supplements to a weekend newspaper.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: And then put it into a book.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: How old were you when you started this, when you had the obsession with history?
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_01: Oh, from school.
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: Absolutely from school.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_01: But particularly Greek and Roman history.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_01: I mean, British history is really interesting.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_01: And I know all the kings and queens.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_01: I know their dates.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_01: I'm not a clever person, I'm not good at remembering things, but I have remembered all that history.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_01: And it told me well, it does repeat itself.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_01: So you can learn really interesting things from history.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: And this is what I've noticed.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: People are the best in the world of what they do or near the best in the world of what
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_00: they do.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_00: They all have this love of learning from history.
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: Charlie Munger has one of my greatest favorite quotes about this.
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_00: He says that learning from history is a form of leverage.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_00: And you can actually use ideas of people long dead.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: And you'll find out that they were very similar to you.
[00:02:20] That they went through the same struggles, the same, they had the same fears, they had
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_00: the same insecurities.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: They had the same triumphs.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: And you can just pick up a book of somebody's life story like the ones that I have in front
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_00: of me.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: I told you before we started recording.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: I was going through, you know, I had this obsession in love with my work just like you
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: do.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: And in my case was not invention.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_00: It was creating podcasting, podcast.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: And this book, I found it, you know, I think it was April 2018, the very first time.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_00: I read it.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_00: And I had already been struggling to start my podcast for two years with very almost
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_00: no success at all.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: Basically none, no success.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: And it took me five and a half years of struggle.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_00: And the reason this is so important to find it year two into that five and a half years
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: before I had any, you know, even remote level of success is because I'm like, well, James,
[00:03:11] this book is 90% of it.
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_00: You're struggling for 14 years, building 5127 prototypes and refusing to give up.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: You're also funny as hell in the book where you're like, anytime if you think I'm, you
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: know, have a little bit of a go just realize that I'm only, I'm only celebrating that I
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: have the stubbornness of a mule.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_01: This is the note.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: So obviously I mark up the books like crazy and I was showing you just before we started
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: recording.
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_00: And this is really, I got to the very last page.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: And when I was recording my thoughts for the benefit of other people by making the podcast,
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: this is what you inspired me to do.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_00: It's like I hope Dyson's story inspires you to say when you get knocked down, all right
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: then, let's give it another go.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, balancing back is really important.
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_01: And if you are exploring new territory, very experimenting, you're trying to do something
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: different, which is what, you know, you and I want to do, you've got to fail many times
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_01: and you've got to bounce back from it.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: And actually, if you learn that failure is so much more interesting than success because
[00:04:13] failure, you question it, well, why did it go wrong?
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: And actually the reason it goes wrong is often very, very interesting, but it's something
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_01: works.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: You say great, that works and you've even stopped to wonder why it works.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_01: So if you've got to enjoy failure, that's a, that sounds a difficult thing to do, but
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_01: you have to enjoy failure if you want to improve things, if you want to not change the
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_01: world, but change things and improve things.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_01: Goes hand in hand.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_01: And it always saddens me that school doesn't really teach that.
[00:04:43] At school or university, the thing is to be brilliant and to get the answer right first
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_01: time.
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_01: And there are brilliant people who can do that, but for the rest of us, we're not brilliant.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_01: And to get there, we have to strive and we have to go through failure.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_01: And we realize that, you know, you don't get it right first time, you don't get it right
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_01: second time.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_01: In my case, and I counted it, it's 5127 times.
[00:05:07] One of the things I always want to say is that that sounds like a struggle.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_01: Okay, it was a struggle, but actually it was a hugely enjoyable struggle.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_01: The debt was mounting and I had three children and a wife and a home and then a mortgage
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: to pay and I can't really ask.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_01: But I had a real point in life.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_01: I had a real aim and I had to get there.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: And the failures were interesting because I'd learn from every single one of them, almost
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: every single one of them.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: Same more about that.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: You had an aim in life.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: Sort of mission.
[00:05:36] How did you think of it then, where you're going through it?
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_01: When I discovered that I loved engineering, because I did classics at school.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_01: That couldn't be further away from engineering and then I went to study design and then discovered
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_01: engineering.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_01: So engineering was new to me.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_01: It was like something new.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_01: And I had this sort of stupid thought when I was a college that I wanted to design
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_01: products.
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_01: I wanted to engineer them.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_01: I wanted to develop that technology and I wanted to manufacture them and I wanted to
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_01: sell them.
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_01: So it's a sort of megalomaniac thought.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_01: Why?
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_01: I was a pedidler student in London.
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_01: How could I have this thought of being a global manufacturer?
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_01: And I don't know how or why I had that thought.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_01: But there were interesting things happening at that time because Concord was happening.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_01: It's again, it's brought out his mini car, which is still going today, by the way, he
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: was successful today.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_01: So it was about 15 years after the Second World War.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: So there was deprivation during the war and immediately afterwards.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_01: But suddenly, particularly in mid-sixes, and I think particularly in London where I was,
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_01: there was a feeling that we're free of the past.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: We can do something new and different.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_01: And the old foster Richard Rogers and Buckminsterford, all these people were having really
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_01: expansive and revolutionary thoughts about design, engineering, buildings and so on.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: So I was very lucky to be part of that era.
[00:07:04] And I think it, you know, I caught the buck.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_01: And I had a very cheeky idea that that's what I wanted to be.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_01: So this is when you meet Jeremy Fry.
[00:07:14] I'm actually, wasn't expecting to start our conversation the way we just did when I'm
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_00: glad it leads perfectly to how I really wanted to start, which is like, I want, if you can
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_00: explain who Jeremy Fry was and the impact that he had on your life.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: Well, I was the role-collar devout doing design and I was taught by a very famous structural
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_01: engineer who worked with Foster and Rogers.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_01: And I became interested in engineering.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_01: And I designed a Buckminsterford-Fuller type structure for an impassary in London.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_01: It was a theatre for an impassary in London.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: And I went to this engineering company, this millionaire who had founded an engineering
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: company and asked him if he'd give money to the theatre.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_01: And he said, no, I'll give you a job.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: You can see you're an interesting genius.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_01: I'll give you a job.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_01: So he started giving me jobs.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_01: And one of them was to design this high-speed landing craft, which was his invention that
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: I engineered it and designed it.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_01: And he then said, well, I was a long-haired student with long hair, flared trousers, tight
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: shirts, flag shirts, all that sort of thing.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_01: He said, come and start the company making it and selling it.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: I sort of looked at him a bit, so I don't know how to sell things.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_01: And he said, look, you're the engineer.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_01: You've chosen every square inch of that product or everything.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_01: You know it all.
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_01: You're the best person to sell it.
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_01: So that was an interesting sort of revelation for me, because I'd always thought there were
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_01: professions.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_01: And you know, there were sales.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_01: There's one profession.
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_01: Engineering was another.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: Manufacturing was another.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_01: And being a manager was another.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_01: And suddenly there was this entrepreneur himself saying to me, well, you're an engineer and
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_01: designer and you know all about the product, go and make it and go and sell it.
[00:08:54] So it broke down all barriers for me.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_01: We became great friends.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_01: We had lots of discussions about engineering and shared this passion for engineering and
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: for making things.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_00: And you found somebody that also had an obsession with the past engineers, past designers,
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_00: past inventors that you could actually have a deep conversations with about how they
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: built their products, why they made the certain decisions and then you used those to inform
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_00: the work that you guys were doing, correct?
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_01: I mean, he was a friend of his again.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: So I'd never met his againness, but I heard about him from him.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: They used to do hill racing together, design cars that very, very light cars that
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_01: race up hills very quickly with very little power.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_01: So it's sort of very skinny engineering, minimalist engineering.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_01: And so he had quite a lot of stories from that era.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_01: He was 20 years old with me.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_01: So he had seen a bit of life during the war and had done this racing car thing and established
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_01: an engineering company.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_01: So he just removed the barriers and that it was okay to be an obsessive engineer.
[00:09:59] And you just do whatever it is you want to do and then you go out and sell it and hopefully
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_01: like the pipe pepper of Hamlin, people will follow you.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_01: So to get that advice from someone of that crucial stage in my life was, by say, mind-blowing,
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_01: it was, it enabled me to carry on and do things that everybody said I couldn't do.
[00:10:23] And then what do you think?
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_01: Because you worked on the C-track for five years before you left?
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, about seven.
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: Because I did two years of it when I was at college.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_01: I moonlighted and designed it and made one while I was at college.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_01: And then I left college and ran the business, making and selling it.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_01: Well, were some of the most important lessons from the seven years when you were doing
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_01: a C-track?
[00:10:43] Oh, I think I learned everything from that.
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_01: I learned how to manufacture, how to approach manufacturers and get them to make components,
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: how to set up a factory, building the product, how to sell it overseas, how to find agents
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_01: and distributors, all that sort of thing, and learn failures and successes with that.
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_01: To learn that it's all about people, not appearances or how big their company was.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_01: It's finding the right sort of person with the right sort of enthusiasm.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: Say more about that.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_01: Probably if you're running a public company and you're choosing a distributor that's
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_01: safe for Canada, it would be probably irresponsible to find an individual who is just starting
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_01: up rather than choosing an established distributor.
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_01: But of course, the person is just starting up.
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_01: Okay, he hasn't got a name yet.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_01: But he's probably incredibly enthusiastic and will put everything behind it and work all
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: hours to make it work.
[00:11:37] So it's the person, not the business, really, that you're backing.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_01: My friend Josh Kushner has this great quote, you have to decide when you're partnering
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: with somebody, you decide the most experienced, the most educated or who wants it the most,
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_00: you always choose the person that wants it the most.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_00: Experience is an interesting thing.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_01: Jeremy Frye taught me this.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_01: He hated experienced people.
[00:11:57] He also hated people with beards and something else.
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_01: But there's a different era.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_01: There's a different era.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, but switching pipes, that's right.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: Because people used to make pipes back in the six days.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_01: And beards were different in the six days.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_01: Anyway, come back to the experience, which is the important thing.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_01: And I've discovered this, if you're experienced, you know why not to do something or how not
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_01: to do something.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_01: Whereas if you're naive and you're a young engineer, you've just qualified or you're
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_01: still training, you don't have that negativity towards certain things.
[00:12:36] Often it's something that hasn't worked previously that could work and is interesting to follow.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_01: So you're very open.
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_01: And I love naive to people asking silly questions, stupid questions, because it creates a different
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_01: way of doing things.
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_01: And we've got to find different ways of doing things all the time.
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_01: My friend Daniel, the founder of Spotify, we had a conversation about this where he actually
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: thinks naive it is like one of the greatest assets a young entrepreneur or an inventor
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: can have, because he's like, if I knew how difficult it would be to make Spotify succeed
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: at the beginning, I would not have done that.
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, naive and stupid.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_01: I don't think that.
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_01: I think that naive is interesting because you're thinking really hard.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: How the hell do I do this?
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to solve this problem.
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_01: The experienced person might think they know how to solve it, but the naive person doesn't
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_01: say they're thinking much harder and more intelligently.
[00:13:33] James Dyson is obsessed with crafting a high quality product, and he's made some of the
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_00: best products in the world by running tens of thousands of experiments throughout his
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_00: life.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_00: Every single experiment was aimed at making a better product for his customer.
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_00: That is exactly what the presenting sponsor of this podcast, ramp, does.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_00: Dyson reminds me my friend, Karim, who's the co-founder and CTO of ramp.
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_00: I spent a lot of time talking to Karim, and every single conversation centers around
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_00: his obsession with crafting a high quality product and using the latest technology to
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_00: constantly create better experiences for his customers.
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: This is exactly what James Dyson does.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_00: Karim and James Dyson both believe that nothing is ever good enough and everything can
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_00: be improved.
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_00: Ramp has one of the most talented technical teams in finance, and they use rapid, relentless
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: iteration to make their product better every day, just like Dyson.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_00: So far this year, ramp has shipped over 300 new features.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: Ramp is completely committed to using AI to make a better experience for their customers
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_00: and to automate as much of your businesses finances as possible.
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_00: In fact, Karim just wrote this, it is our duty to be first movers and push limits so we
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: can make the greatest possible product experience for our customers.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_00: That sounds a lot like James Dyson to me.
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_00: And it is why many of the fastest growing and most innovative companies in the world are
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: running their business on ramp.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_00: Make sure you go to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business save time and money.

[00:14:58] SPEAKER_00: great things for your customers.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: Because at the end of the day, that is what this is all about.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_00: Building a product or service that makes someone else's life better.
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_00: That is what I'm trying to do.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: That is what Dyson has dedicated his life to doing.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: And that is what ramp has done too.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_00: Get started today by going to ramp.com.
[00:15:15] So Jeremy was in the business of hiring people like a young James Dyson.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: He is smart, enthusiastic, person that clearly wants to do this as opposed to anybody that
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_00: came from another company or even a competitor.
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: Exactly that.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_00: You are doing this now.
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_00: You still do this 40 years later, 50 years later.
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_01: And we have taken it one stage further because we have started our own university.
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_01: So we are taking 17 and 18 year olds and starting even younger.
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_01: And they work in the business and they ask naive questions.
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_01: You cover the university in the book.
[00:15:48] Again, one of the things I personally learned from you is differentiation for the sake
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: of it.
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_00: And so anything that I'm going to do, I look around.
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_00: One of my heroes is Edwin Land, the founder of Polaroid.
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_00: And he had this great line.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_00: He's like, my personal motto is, don't do anything so what else can do.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_00: Can you explain exactly how you structured and how you designed the Dyson University?
[00:16:11] University is very expensive.
[00:16:13] Especially in the United States.
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_01: It's getting as bad in England.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_01: It's terrible.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: You're saddled with that debt for a long time.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_01: I mean, sometimes 20 years.
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_01: And in any case, a lot of the debt is not repaid.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: And we need to find a different way to teach people.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_01: And it's ridiculous because they're any taught for half the year the rest of it is holiday.
[00:16:37] So you've got these big institutions, expensive institutions.
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_01: When people only there part time, it's madness.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_01: And also, as I learned when I was at college working with an engineering company, because
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_01: you were working with Jeremy while you were still at school, yes, I was sort of moonlighting.
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_01: The college knew what I was doing and approved of it.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_01: But it wasn't what normal students did.
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_01: So I love that experience working with people who are having to do things, not academics,
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: people are having to do things and having to do them and hurry.
[00:17:10] And I really enjoyed that.
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_01: And I thought, well, why can't I give that opportunity to other people?
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_01: So we started our own university.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: And it's difficult thing to do because the government has to approve it.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_01: And for seven years, we had to work with another university and not all of them would work
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_01: because they didn't like the source as big competitors because we pay our students.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's an achievement.
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_00: You start with why are we saddling these young people with an alpha-trust of debt around
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_00: their necks that's going to limit their, you know, what they can actually pursue.
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_00: They're going to be taking jobs that they're forced to take, that they don't want to take
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_00: maybe for money, I suppose, so you falling, you're just, I don't even call it passion.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_00: I think it's more like an obsession than you have.
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_00: So am I correct?
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_00: There's no tuition.
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_00: Yes, there's tuition.
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_01: We teach them two days a week.
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_01: And they work with us three days.
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_01: But you pay them for the three days.
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_01: We pay them.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_01: They pay them $45,000 a year.
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_01: They have cars and they go on skiing all the days.
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_01: There's normal people.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_01: They're not students.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_01: They're in a student group.
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_01: We have about 170 of them all together.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_01: But they're intisperced throughout the company.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_01: And they love that.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_01: They love working with people who are earning money and having to do, having to make things
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_01: work, having to do engineering, having to do marketing, selling whatever it is, manufacturing.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_01: They like the reality of that.
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_01: And it inspires them to learn the academic side.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_01: Because a lot of them said, you know, the academic side of engineering is difficult
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: is hard, but I'm inspired to do it because I got to practice it every day.
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_01: I suppose a separating a chill.
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_00: As opposed to going to university and just having academia for four years.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_01: With us, they're being inventors, they're developing technology and they're learning exactly
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_01: why they need to know the academic side, the theory.
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_00: Explain why it's better to have a per in your opinion, a person with no experience
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_00: than somebody who came from an existing company.
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_00: The old you get the more you try to apply your experience.
[00:19:06] And if you've come from an existing company, you may have picked up bad habits.
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_01: I'm not saying we didn't have bad habits at Dyson, but I'm saying you picked up the
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_01: habits of that company, which may not be the right sort of attitude that we want.
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_01: This attitude of constant change, constantly trying new things, trying to be different
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_01: for different sake because it sets us on a different path.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: And some people find that difficult.
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_01: Some people want to have a much more conventional way to do things.
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_01: And so if you're hiring 18-year-olds working in Dyson, they're also going to...
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_00: 2017-year-olds as well.
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: Okay, 17-18-year-olds.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_00: What is it like?
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_00: To be honest, now we've been in really nice, and there's no difference.
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_00: Okay, that's going to be shocking for at least for people who are like, they assume
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_00: okay, they have to graduate high school in America, they have to go to college, maybe
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_00: in many cases they have, they go to graduate school and then they're almost 30 by the time
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_00: they start working.
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_00: And you're like, no, how are they 18-year-olds?
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: You got to think more about this.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because they're enthusiastic.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_01: They've come to us because they want to do real work.
[00:20:10] And they do real work.
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_01: And just because they're not as experienced as graduates or someone in year four as opposed
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_01: to year one doesn't mean to say they don't have just the same to offer or something better
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_01: to offer because they're even more naive.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_01: So it works really well, and it's interesting.
[00:20:28] I want to go back to the seven years with the C-Truck.
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_00: You write about Jeremy Fry in both books, and in many cases, you know, 50 years out,
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: in this book, 50 years after you spend time with him and work with him.
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_00: You said there's a lot of ideas that you learn working with him that you still apply to
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_00: the state, Dyson, which I think is very fascinating and it speaks to the power of ideas.
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_00: I don't have the prejudices against BS by the way.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_00: Oh, thank you.
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: I think I probably retain the pipe bomb, but not the BS.
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_01: I also apply this fine.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_01: And I don't have like the hippie beer, so it's fine.
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_00: I'd be at break my heart to know Jeremy Fry when because he's become almost my year.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_00: He would have changed over the years.
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_00: For sure.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_00: But one thing that's fascinating is, okay, this also speaks to, I'm curious about your
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: opinion on wrist tolerance.
[00:21:11] SPEAKER_00: Obviously, you have excessively high wrist tolerance in both stories.
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: But you're like, I'm working for, you know, your mentor.
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_00: Do you think I think it's a genius?
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_00: He treats you really, really well.
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_00: He gave you complete autonomy and control.
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_00: It's like, just go run this business.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: There's a great line in the book where you're like, he introduced you to a completely
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_00: different modus operandi of the way to operate.
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_00: We were like, we needed somebody to know about aerodynamics.
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_00: He's like, well, the Range Rover is down there, like the lakes right there, like tie a piece
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_00: of wood behind a boat and record what happens and then change it.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_00: And but you had, I think, a wife and at least one child when you left to do the ball
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_00: barrel.
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_00: Two kids.
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_01: Two kids.
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so two kids, yeah.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_00: You have, I think, a mortgage.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_00: So you have a family to take care of.
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_00: You have a great high paying job, right?
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_00: You have, you're working hand in hand with somebody you greatly admire that has taught you
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_00: a ton in seven years.
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_00: And yet, you're like, I need to go out and be an entrepreneur and do my own thing.
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so let's talk about that.
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_00: Because the second thing that I didn't understand, no matter how many times I read this, why
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_00: didn't you let him fund that?
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: That was a really stupid decision.
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_01: And in fact, he and ultimately when I started the vacuum cleaner business, we did fund
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_01: it together.
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_01: So that, which we'll get to.
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that was a really super decision because he was so many ones who stood about starting
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_01: businesses, how difficult it was.
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_01: And in fact, I went to borrow money off my brother-in-law and another party who didn't
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_01: understand the difficulties of starting businesses and the growth pains and so on.
[00:22:48] Before we get there, just the decision to lead a great, it's almost like you seek, tell
[00:22:55] me if I'm wrong with this.
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_00: I know you seek difference from the sake of it.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_00: In that time period, you may not be like this now.
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_00: In that time period, it felt like you were seeking risk for the sake of risk.
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, I've thought a bit about that.
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's partly because my father died when I was eight, nine.
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_01: And I think that had a sort of profound effect on me that I didn't realize at the time.
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_01: Because I felt very different to other people because I was at boarding a school and the
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_01: headmaster was very kind and he allowed me to stay on for ten years without paying any
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_01: fees.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_01: So that was an extraordinary act of kindness.
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_01: But everybody else had parents, two parents.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_01: There weren't single parent families in those days.
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_01: And even if the two had split up, they appeared to come together to come and see their child
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_01: at school.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_01: But I had just my mother going to see me.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_01: My impoverished mother coming to see me.
[00:23:47] SPEAKER_01: So I felt different.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: And also, I think if you've lost a parent at that age, life can't get much worse.
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_01: So you're prepared to take risk because you've started from a horrible starting point.
[00:24:02] Risk has become a sort of thing I need to live with.
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_01: I need to live on the knife edge all the time.
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_01: You still feel that today?
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_01: I still feel that today, yes.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_01: And it doesn't make me unhappy.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't make me wrong.
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_01: But I like living for the moment in danger because you're onto something new.
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_01: You're doing something different.
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_01: And it's risky.
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_01: The result is not sure at all.
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_01: In fact, it's very unsure, very dangerous.
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_01: And I don't mind that.
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't keep me awake at night.
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_01: So it starts when your father dies.
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_00: He died really young.
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_00: He was 40.
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_00: He was 40.
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_00: When you were nine.
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_00: You're going to start tearing up because that part just destroys me.
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_00: I guess I'll talk about this now.
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_00: I want to go back to the risk and making that jump.
[00:24:54] One of the most profound impacts that your second book has is you're writing this 60 years
[00:25:01] after your father dies.
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_00: And you're talking about your grandson, Mick.
[00:25:06] And you realize now is a 69 year old man with a lifelong set of experiences.
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_00: How vulnerable you were because he's still taking his, your grandson Mick is still taking
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_00: his stuffed animal to bed.
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_00: And now you're left alone with a nine year boy needs his father.
[00:25:26] Yeah.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_01: He had a profound influence on me.
[00:25:31] He had to do everything.
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_01: I mean, he loved producing plays.
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_01: He loved directing them.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: I've got a note in his little Shakespeare books, crossing out lines and making notes about
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_01: things.
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_01: And he did puppet shows.
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_01: He played the recorder.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_01: He did.
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_01: He taught Rugga.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_01: He taught hockey.
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_01: He just wanted to do everything.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: And I'm a bit like that.
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_01: And I was certainly like that at school, especially if it didn't involve academia.
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_01: But it was, and he was like that.
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_01: I just started a connection.
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_01: Maybe I didn't make previously.
[00:26:07] He wanted to change professions towards the end of his life.
[00:26:13] He fought in the war in Burma.
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_01: We'll call it the Forgotten War.
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_01: And it really was.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_01: It was a nasty, nasty war, a long way away.
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_01: And he came back from that in 1946.
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_01: And in 1949 he contracted cancer.
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_01: So he'd been away from his wife for six years, you know, first six years of their life together.
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_01: And he had three years being a taxi master at school.
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_01: And then he got cancer and say he was in and out of hospital.
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: He had it.
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_01: Did you have an opportunity to work for the BBC or something?
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_00: That's what he wanted to do.
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_00: That's what he wanted to do.
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_00: He never had the opportunity to do it.
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_00: And now I'm thinking, I just asked you the question was, it's like, how the hell do you
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_00: leave this fantastic position to go off on your own?
[00:26:56] SPEAKER_00: He realized, well, I had the opportunity to, where like your dad, unfortunately, for
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: such a short time, his control never got that opportunity.
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_01: No, yeah.
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_01: His life's a stone of trauma, but they had to force it.
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_01: I mean, yeah, I'm almost 80.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_01: So twice as long as he did.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_01: Your mom passed away early.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_01: She got cancer as well.
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_01: And 50s.
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_00: 55?
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_00: My mom passed away from cancer early too.
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:27:21] I had a horrible disease.
[00:27:24] Did you ever, this is nothing related to what I would think I was going to talk to you
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_00: about?
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: Your dad passed away at 40 or mom in her mid 50s.
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_00: You've lived much longer than both of them.
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_00: When you were younger, were you worried that you were going to die young too?
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_00: No, never occurred to me.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_00: Interesting.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_01: No, never occurred to me.
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_01: I think it made me want to get the most out of life fast, maybe impatient to live my
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_01: life.
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_01: Funny.
[00:27:52] I obviously have a habit and obsession with reading biographies.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_00: Most of the people are read biographies of are not like you.
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_00: They're actually dead.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_00: And I think this unexpected.
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_00: I'll try and keep going.
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_00: No, no, no.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_00: We're going to do, I'm going to come to Dyson HQ and I want to record more things.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_00: I want to see the headquarters and everything else.
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_00: So yeah, you have a reason to live.
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_00: And this is your beautiful family, but that was one of the byproducts of reading a bunch
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_00: of biographies of dead people is you get to the end.
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_00: And it's not that you got to the end of the book.
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_00: You got to the end of somebody's life story.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_00: And it's not morbid, but you have this constant reminder that our time here is limited
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_00: and don't waste a single day.
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_00: I think about that.
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_00: I have in Poland to wasting even 24 hours.
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_00: And he's actually like a powerful motivator and just a great byproduct of the professional
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_00: chose.
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_00: I want to go back to you're going, taking risk for the sake of risk.
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_00: You want to be your own man.
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_00: I think it's the line that you have in the book when you leave.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_00: So I understand that.
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_00: We're going to get to the ball, but can you say more?
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: So that was the point.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_01: You did also me that question.
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_01: And why I didn't ask Jeremy Fyer to help fund that thing is because I wanted to do
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_01: something on my own.
[00:29:01] And you felt I'd worked for somebody.
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_01: I want to do something entirely on my own.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_01: But you'd still be the entrepreneur.
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_01: But there would be terrible decision.
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_01: But that's how I felt at the time.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_01: Why not take money from him?
[00:29:12] Because I felt I'd worked with him.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_01: He'd be my mentor.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_01: OK.
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_01: And I wanted to just go off and do it on my own.
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_01: It was to prove something to myself, I suppose.
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_01: It was a stupid decision.
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_01: So I've still been having other people help fund me.
[00:29:28] So it was a really stupid decision.
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_01: And you do make stupid decisions, isn't that?
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_01: And I learned from my mistake and say, when I started the vacuum care, I went back to
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_01: someone who understood entrepreneurship.
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_01: Who had been an entrepreneur rather than people who hadn't been entrepreneurs.
[00:29:42] We were talking about this earlier.
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_00: You and I were talking about this earlier, where there is now a new class of capital available
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_00: to entrepreneurs that is not institutional venture capital.
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_00: That's obviously still exists.
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_00: But you have a lot of people that have had incredible success like yourself.
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_00: But I've become friends with Michael Dell.
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_00: And this is something that he's interested in.
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_00: And providing alternative funding solutions to entrepreneurs from an entrepreneur.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_00: And it was exactly what they're going through.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_00: That is not a professional investor.
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_00: That is not, doesn't even, not trying to make more returns.
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_00: They have more money than they'll ever spend.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_00: They literally love entrepreneurs and want to help entrepreneurs.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_00: I think it's really important.
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_00: The list of mistakes.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_00: Because you always say this and I love it.
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: I have the first version of your second biography, which is Inventional Life.
[00:30:28] SPEAKER_00: I think it's changed now.
[00:30:30] I think you were going to name it like failure.
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_00: It's more interesting.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_00: Well, then success are more fun than success.
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_00: It says that was a multi-tier.
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the publishers were quite rightly said.
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_00: They weren't so.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_00: So let's focus on the failures and the mistakes that you made with the ballbearer.
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_00: What still sticks out in your mind about that?
[00:30:49] Right at the beginning, having people help fund it.
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_01: Because I had to put up a guarantee.
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_01: My brother-in-law put up a guarantee.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: The guarantees against your house?
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_01: The guarantee was against my house.
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_01: OK.
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_01: Fortunately, I had a house by then.
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_01: My brother-in-law put up a guarantee and we borrowed money from the bank.
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_01: By the way, interest rates went to 22%.
[00:31:13] Or we were doing that business.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_01: And that was the killer.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_00: So I borrowed money again when I started the ballbearer, the banking cleaner business.
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_01: So it's not borrowing money.
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_01: There's a problem.
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_01: It's involving people who don't understand startups.
[00:31:30] SPEAKER_01: The pain you have to go through.
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_01: What did they not understand?
[00:31:33] They just didn't understand the business.
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_01: What it's like.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: For example, the ballbearer was copied in America by an ex-employee and another company.
[00:31:46] And they wanted to go after him and teach him a lesson.
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_01: And I said, no, no, no, let him do it.
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_01: If he wants to do it, let him do it.
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_01: And we'll come into America and we'll sell ours against his.
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_01: He'll pave the way and we'll come sell our original version.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_01: But they want the vengeance.
[00:32:02] SPEAKER_01: So we spend a lot of money trying to sue them in order to know good effect, really.
[00:32:07] So that's one example.
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_01: The real thing I learned is that it's much better to put your own money in.
[00:32:16] I didn't have any money.
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_01: I borrowed it.
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: But it was money that had been given to me by a bank.
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_01: So it was my money, even though I was on the line for it.
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_01: And my wife had to sign the house away on all our possessions and all that, so I was
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_01: making my decisions for me.
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_01: I wasn't able to worry about investors a lot.
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_01: They might think, which when I was doing the ballbearer business, I was always doing
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_01: that.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_01: I was having to ring them up and say, do you think we should do this?
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_01: Is it a K effect?
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_01: I do this.
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_00: I think to have an inherent, I don't want to interrupt you, an inherent distaste for
[00:32:49] anybody else having any kind of control over what you're doing.
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_00: No, not that's tall.
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_01: That's not what I meant.
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_01: I'm glad you raised that.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: That's not what I meant.
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_01: For example, I have non-executive directors.
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_01: I run the business as though it was a public business, but it's a private business.
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's very important to have good people advising here.
[00:33:10] What I meant was, when I'm entirely on my own and I make a decision, I make a decision
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_01: without reference, certainly in the early days, to anybody else, is it the right decision
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_01: for the business?
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_01: Will it make a better product?
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_01: Will it sell more or that sort of thing?
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_01: That's very, very single-minded.
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_01: You have to worry about investors at all.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_01: You have to worry about the bank balance, but you don't have to worry about investors,
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_01: which made me very single-minded.
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_01: And if there's failure, it's my failure.
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_01: It's all down to me.
[00:33:41] Whereas if you've got other people, then other people are making joint decisions.
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_01: So I really enjoyed not having anyone to turn to.
[00:33:50] Whereas with the ball-bearer business, there are other directors, there are other investors.
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_01: So I had to worry about what they thought.
[00:33:57] Perhaps I shouldn't have, but I did.
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_01: But if you're on your own, you make the decision entirely the right reason.
[00:34:05] What do you think that youths are as important as they did not for that specific product?
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_00: When we started selling the ball-bearer, the retailers,
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_01: the first of all, there weren't big hardware chains.
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_01: They were individual-owned hardware stores.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_01: So there's no home-debore or low-hearing company.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: No, none of that, which makes life a lot easier.
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_01: You might not think that, but it does make life a lot easier if you're manufacturing something.
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_01: So we had to sell through wholesalers who sold to all the individual retailers
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_01: and garden centers where you're going by garden stuff.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_01: They were all individually owned.
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_01: So you had to have teams of sales people getting around all these things,
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_01: trying to sell products to them.
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yes, we can take one this week and see, though, one or the other.
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_01: Oh, it was a completely mad system.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_01: Now, I'd started the business selling direct to people through little adverts and the newspaper.
[00:34:59] Timed a little adverts and people would send the checks in those days.
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_01: People used to send checks.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_01: It was pre-credit cuts.
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_01: You have a great line about this on the book.
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_00: You said the entrenched professional will always resist longer than the independent consumer.
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_00: Yes, exactly.
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_01: So exactly that.
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_01: And that was the point.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_01: The illustration of that is when I went around trying to sell to garden centers and hardware stores,
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_01: they were not interested.
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_01: They actually laughed.
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_01: They said that thing was a big red ball.
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_01: They never will never buy that.
[00:35:28] But they did buy it from these little ads.
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_01: So I wanted to go on expanding the idea of selling direct and not having a little person
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_01: and not having to have sales people.
[00:35:38] But they said, don't know.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_01: Look, you're being successful.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: I think now is the time to do it properly and get a factory and sell the normal way through retailers.
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_01: Did you push back against a decision?
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_01: A bit.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_01: Now, I said, look, we're doing quite well now.
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_01: And I'm not going to borrow money.
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_01: We're not dependent on anybody.
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_01: We're just replacing these ads and seeing what happens.
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_01: And OK, the business might be very small.
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_01: But it's OK, actually.
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_01: It's wiping his face.
[00:36:04] But then we got into debt and the debt got bigger and the debt went to 22% interest rate.
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I come in this bucket if it can make, you know, 5% profit or 10% net profit.
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_01: We're fighting a 22% penalty all the time.
[00:36:24] The best leaders in business are able to spot patterns, but you can't spot patterns if you can't see your data.
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_00: And most businesses are only using 20% of their data because 80% of your customer intelligence is invisible hidden in emails, transcripts and conversations.
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_00: Unless you have HubSpot, HubSpot is where all of your data comes together.
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_00: So you can see the patterns that matter because when you know more, you grow more.
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_00: And that is a pattern that never fails.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_00: Visit HubSpot.com today.
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_00: That is HubSpot.com.
[00:36:54] So there's another thing that happened where you made the mistake of assigning.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_00: This was your invention.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_00: This was your, the ballbearer was your creation.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_00: You made some other products, but we can skip over that for now.
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_00: And then you filed a patent.
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_00: It was patentable and you transferred the patent not to yourself, but to the company.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_00: And then when they kicked you out of the company, they then took your company and your patent.
[00:37:16] Yes.
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_01: Yes, they took everything.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: But actually, there's a silver lining tool of that.
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_01: Where it's odd also that the vacuum cleaner.
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_00: And they didn't believe in it.
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_01: This is why I'm obsessed with people so far for every single person I've talked to the show.
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_00: They've done what they do for excessively long period time.
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_00: And you're from 20 to 45 years.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_00: And I think you just, you see this over and over in these stories.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_00: Like, people are way too big of a rush.
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_00: It's like, you're going to have these happy accidents.
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_00: You just stay in the game long enough to get lucky because there's a byproduct of the
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_00: stuff you're doing in the case of the, you're working on the ballbearer, right?
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_00: And you discover what a cyclone is because you're solving a problem with the ballbearer.
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_00: Look, there's no way you could have predicted the beginning that you could apply it to
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_00: another domain and then wipe the floor with all your competitors.
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_00: Can you explain what you were doing and how you accidentally discovered the cyclone
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_00: for the first time?
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_00: The important thing is to observe things all the time for an engineer and work out,
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_01: how they work.
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_01: And also, incidentally, you're always working out how to make them work better.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_01: Would it be better if I did this?
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_01: Isn't there a better way of doing that?
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_01: And that, that always happens with all the inventions.
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_01: They don't just come out of the sky.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_01: They occur because you observe something.
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_01: So curiosity and observation and trying to understand things is the way to come up with
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_01: new ways of doing things.
[00:38:34] SPEAKER_01: And so it was with the vacuum cleaner, as you said, we had this huge plant that sprayed
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_01: the frames with powder.
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of the powder missed the frames because it's playing sort of open things,
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_01: masses of it, missing it.
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_01: And you suck it, we were sucking it away onto a cloth filter, a huge cloth filter,
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_01: which clogged all the time.
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_01: Like a vacuum bag.
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_01: Like a vacuum bag.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_00: See, so that's, you make the connection.
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_01: You see, you make the connection.
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_01: And what clever people did was have this huge cyclone.
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_01: So I got a quote for one and we, no way, we could afford it.
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_01: So over a couple of weekends, we built one and it was 30 foot high.
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_01: And we had to make hole in the roof of the factory to stuff the, has chimney and sort
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: of out there at the top.
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_01: And a cyclone separates dust from air.
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_01: So there's between you and I, there's a lot of dust.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_01: And a cyclone will separate that by centrifugal force.
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: So if you drive at a corner or a road very fast in your port, if you drive too fast, you spin
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_01: off into the ditch.
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_01: And so that is with a dust particle, dust particle, though the ones between us are floating,
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_01: they're very, very fine.
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_01: If you make them go around a corner at very high speed, they get flung out to the edge
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_01: into the ditch.
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_01: So a cyclone is a circular container and you apply enormous centrifugal force to the
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_01: dust particles within it and they will get flung to the outside wall.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_01: And the anyway out is from the center, the chimney in the center.
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_01: So that's the basic principle of a cyclone.
[00:40:09] So I made that, yes, I'd use vacuum, you know, I did it with anybody else and they
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_01: always seem to make this screaming noise and not pick things up.
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_01: And one weekend, I was cleaning the house and the bag was full.
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_01: What no, it said the bag was clogged, which is a slightly different thing.
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_01: Anyway, I looked around for a new bag, couldn't find one in the house.
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_01: So I opened it up, emptied it out and then gaffer taped it back up again and shoved it
[00:40:37] SPEAKER_01: back in.
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_01: It's still no suction.
[00:40:40] So I thought that's all I thought, in fact, you know, the site didn't start because
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_01: the bag was full.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_01: And I suddenly realized the bag was empty and something else was at play here.
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_01: And I emptied it up, I took the gaffer tape off and they emptied it up and there was
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_01: a fine lining of fine dust around the inside of the bag.
[00:40:58] And I suddenly realized that the suction is created by airflow, which has to go through
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_01: the pores of the bag.
[00:41:06] But this fine dust is clogging the pores.
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_01: It's not the fact that the bag's full.
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_01: It's the fact that the bag is clogged.
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_01: They call it a bag full indicator.
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_01: That's a lie.
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_01: It's a bag clogged indicator.
[00:41:18] SPEAKER_01: So I thought pretty angry about this.
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_01: I did go, got out and went drove to a shop and bought a new bag and put it in.
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_01: I had good suction for a short while and then it dropped off again and it said bag full.
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_01: It wasn't bag full, bag's clogged.
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_01: And so I got pretty angry about this.
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_01: And I came to a realization, it's not very clever, realization, that all the air is trying
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_01: to go through these little holes in the bag and it's so easy for them to be clogged.
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_01: And then of course I remembered the big cyclone, huge 30 foot cyclone, we're built at the
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_01: factory to stop for cloth getting clogged and dust instead we were spinning it out
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_01: successfully by centrifugal force and never clogged.
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_01: So I thought why don't we have one of those 30 foot cyclones inside of vacuum cleaner
[00:42:02] SPEAKER_01: for a foot high?
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_01: So it wasn't very clever really.
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_01: So I built one out of a car...
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_01: It's very clever.
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_01: No, it's not very clever.
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_01: It's not very clever.
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_01: So I built one very quickly in the kitchen at home out of cardboard and cap a tape again.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_01: I took the bag off my upright vacuum cleaner, replaced it with a bit of hose and this cardboard
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_01: mini version of the 34-1 were built at work out of steel and pushed it around.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_01: And I was pushing around the first vacuum cleaner and never lose its suction.
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_01: So I thought I had a good idea so I filed a patent and I offered it to the ball bear company.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_01: Why?
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_00: Because you guys are doing all these gardening products, right?
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_00: I don't think...
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_00: Were you making anything else that wasn't really a gardening before this at the...
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_00: And then I think one of your main observations is like this is not the best business because
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_00: it's seasonal.
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_00: That's horrible.
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[00:42:59] A seasonal product is awful.
[00:43:02] So why don't we...
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_01: Especially in England.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_01: People buy fat containers all the time.
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_01: So every day and that's what I want.
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_01: Because with a seasonal product, there's a fan-lope period where you sell nothing and then
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_01: spring comes along and hopefully you start to sell.
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_01: So you sell...
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_01: The weather makes a huge difference to what you sell.
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_01: And if you have a bad spring, it's a wet spring, you never make up for that.
[00:43:28] So if you change your product, you make it better.
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_01: You don't actually know one yet to the next whether it's an improvement or not, whether
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_01: it's sold more, it all depends on the weather.
[00:43:37] So you've got to employ people during the winter when you don't need them and then the
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_01: summer you need more people.
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_01: It's just a seasonal business, it's a horrible business.
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_01: The boys, he's not...
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: So I put it in here, one who runs a skewer's or a...
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_00: So you take this vacuum cleaner...
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_00: All right guys, I have the solution to our problems.
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_00: It's a genius invention.
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_00: It's very clever, even though you keep saying it's not clever.
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_00: I have this clever invention and their response is...
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_01: Their response is, if there was a better vacuum cleaner, who in a lecture like some of the
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_01: existing people would have done it.
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_01: I love that you started our conversation that history repeats.
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_00: The way I say is like, human nature repeats.
[00:44:13] SPEAKER_00: And so adding history rhymes, but human nature is very constant.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_00: And this idea of, no, I can't possibly imagine a future that's different from our present
[00:44:21] SPEAKER_00: just for some reason, the vast majority of humans just cannot do that.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_00: Like extra, like, step in thought process.
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_00: And obviously, I think you're gifted with that.
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_00: And there's an assumption that experts do things correctly or in the middle of a...
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_01: Which in the right from Jeremy Fry is ridiculous.
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_00: It's not true.
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_00: And there's a great line in the book where it's like, Jeremy Fry ridiculed experts.
[00:44:43] Yes, well, no, he wasn't that rude, but I mean, yes, he said, don't trust an expert.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_00: Again, a very old idea.
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_00: Andrew Carnegie said the same thing.
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_00: Henry Ford said the same thing.
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_00: He's having 100 years before you were trying to make a run.
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_00: You know where it was a piece.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_01: It was during COVID.
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_01: We're following the science.
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_01: We're listening to what the scientists say.
[00:45:04] And I said, don't listen to what the scientists say, but don't do everything they say,
[00:45:08] SPEAKER_01: you know.
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_01: Apply a common sense.
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_01: So then you get...
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_00: This is something interesting, because this is one thing I don't think I understand,
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_00: at least your thought process.
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_00: Now you're kicked out, you lose your patent, you lose...
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_00: How long?
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_00: It was five years that you were working on the book.
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_00: So you did seven years on the C-Truck, then another five years.
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_00: And now you're like, okay, why was there another product you knew you wanted to invent?
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_00: You knew you wanted...
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_00: I think invent more than manufacturing.
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_00: I think now you love manufacturing once you became one.
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_00: But you were an inventor for...
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_01: Well, no, no, it was a manufacturer.
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_01: And a full manufacturer with the C-Truck and the bull bearer.
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_01: At the beginning of the vacuum cleaner, you wanted to just invent...
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_00: ...license.
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_01: Yes, I thought, look, I've done all that.
[00:45:53] SPEAKER_01: Well, I can't just invent and design things and license them to other people,
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_01: like an author in the right suburb and someone else.
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_01: Which is surprising to me, because you clearly liked control.
[00:46:05] You don't want to rely on other people.
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_00: I have a bad decision.
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_00: I knew I...
[00:46:09] It was a bad decision.
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_00: It was a bad idea.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_00: Because you have to worry about what's going on in other persons.
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_00: And there's like horror stories trying to sell these licenses.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_00: We can talk about this in the books.
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_00: Because you might have one guy that's really enthusiastic
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_00: and you come back two months later and he's gone.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_00: And someone else thinks the opposite.
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_01: And it was a nightmare.
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_01: And I was becoming a lawyer.
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_01: Because I was doing license screen as all the time.
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_01: And then worrying about what happens to them.
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_01: They cancel it.
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_01: And all that sort of thing.
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_01: What came to mind when you mentioned earlier the mistake that you thought
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_00: that your bull bearer or partner...
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_00: Your partners in the bull bearer had where they wanted to chase this guy down in lawsuits.
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_00: Right before he passed away, unfortunately, I got to spend three hours at Charlie Munger's house.
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_00: And it's me and other two other young entrepreneurs.
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_00: And he was just giving us advice for three hours.
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_00: And one thing, he's just like, don't waste your time at lawsuits.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_00: He's like, anytime I got screwed over by people, he's like, I didn't sue him.
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_00: I just realized that you can't do a good deal with a bad person and it just moved on.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_00: He's like, the lawyers are going to suck you dry.
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_00: It's a distraction from your main business.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_00: Like, you just have to keep moving on.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_00: So now you go, okay, I'm going to do the vacuum cleaner.
[00:47:10] You immediately thought of Jeremy Fry?
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_00: Or you had a different way initially to start this business?
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_00: Because I'd been having directors and investors who knew nothing about business.
[00:47:22] I thought I'd go back to someone who I'd really enjoyed working with
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_01: and who clearly understood about starting business.
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_01: It's as if it's enthusiastic about it, like Michael Dell.
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_00: The five years that you've since left his employment,
[00:47:34] SPEAKER_00: you started a relationship with him?
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_00: Oh, yes, yeah, you know, you're still a friend.
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:38] SPEAKER_01: And so you go to talk to him and he gets it immediately?
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_01: Yes, gets it immediately.
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_01: I actually had two ideas that he was, he and I were both more attracted to the vacuum cleaner.
[00:47:48] SPEAKER_01: What was it, Louder?
[00:47:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the other one was, I mean, they now have it.
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_01: But when you send something, the dust used to go everywhere.
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_01: So I had a device that collected it in a bag, funnily enough,
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_01: or a little cyclone, while he was sending something or drilling something.
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it exists now.
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_01: But when I started 50 years ago, whenever it was, that it didn't exist.
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_01: But we decided that wasn't a big time.
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_01: It was a peripheral thing.
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_01: So we wanted to do something important.
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_00: And then whose idea was it, let's not focus on manufacturing,
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_00: let's try to create a working prototype and then take the licensing route.
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_00: Was it you or Jeremy?
[00:48:26] I think it was both of us.
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_01: I mean, both of us have been manufacturers.
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_01: He much more than me.
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_01: And we both said, look, we're really inventors.
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_01: Let's let's some engineers.
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_01: Let's just do that bit.
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_01: And if the invention is good enough, surely people will license it.
[00:48:43] And then this is where we now...
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_00: Delusion.
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:48:46] Get the deal with other humans that are very difficult.
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_00: No, just humans.
[00:48:50] So now this is the point.
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_00: This is where I talked about where this book changed my life.
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_00: Because this is the point where you have an idea.
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_00: You have the stubbornness of a mule.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_00: You have obsession.
[00:49:01] SPEAKER_00: I have a lot of these same traits.
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_00: I think you have them obviously to a greater degree.
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_00: And maybe we'll see how my life plays out.
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_00: But now this is the coach house.
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_00: And so for America, I looked this up.
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_00: I was like, what the hell is the coach house?
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_00: So actually, I heard another interview.
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_00: It's like the garage for Steve Jobs.
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_00: Yes, I'm working in the garage.
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_00: We call it a coach house.
[00:49:19] Do you have any savings?
[00:49:20] SPEAKER_00: Are you in debt?
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_00: That's your fine debt.
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_00: I'm in debt.
[00:49:24] SPEAKER_00: I go into debt when I was a student.
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_00: Do you not understand how unusual that idea is?
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_00: I have no money.
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_00: I'm in debt.
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_00: Let me do this other super risky thing
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: that you don't even have a working prototype yet.
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:49:36] SPEAKER_01: No, it's just an idea, really.
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_01: I have a little cardboard one.
[00:49:41] SPEAKER_00: Take me in your mind, set there.
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_00: What do you think was driving you?
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_00: Were you angered, like, did desire to prove yourself,
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_00: the love of the product?
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_00: What was actually happening at that point?
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_00: That is an unusual decision to make.
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_00: A decision that your entire empire now rests upon.
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_00: It's an incredible time in your life.
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:49:57] Well, I saw a problem with a product
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_01: that everybody uses every day.
[00:50:03] SPEAKER_01: Vital product, clean their homes.
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_01: And as a user, I hated it because they
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_01: have this bag that clogs.
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_01: And then you have to go and buy another bag and so on.
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_01: But more than anything, it's the performance of the outsee.
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_01: I mean, if you have a hundred watt light bulb,
[00:50:18] SPEAKER_01: it's supposed to give a hundred watts all the time.
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_01: But this vacuum cleaner light bulb starts off at a hundred watts
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_01: and ends up at 20 watts pretty quickly.
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_01: So it's deeply unsatisfactory.
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_01: So I thought if I can solve that problem,
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_01: I thought if I could solve that problem,
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_01: other people would buy that product.
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_01: It's no substance.
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_01: It's just an idea.
[00:50:39] What was the chance that you gave yourself a success
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_00: that you could actually solve the problem?
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_00: You were pretty self-confident you could?
[00:50:45] No.
[00:50:46] We're getting crazier.
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_01: No, of course not.
[00:50:50] SPEAKER_01: You don't know you can solve it.
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_01: But you've just got to try.
[00:50:55] SPEAKER_01: And that's true today.
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_01: When we're trying to solve it, we don't know we can solve it.
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_01: We don't know that we can make a motor get at 130,000 RPM.
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_01: No, existing motor is only going to go 50,000 RPM.
[00:51:04] SPEAKER_01: I want to talk about motor.
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_01: So let me figure that out.
[00:51:06] SPEAKER_01: You don't know.
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_01: You just got to do it.
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_01: OK, so I want to talk about it.
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_00: Let me figure that out about that.
[00:51:11] SPEAKER_00: OK.
[00:51:13] That's one of the most, you inadvertently
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_00: said one of the most inspiring things.
[00:51:16] SPEAKER_00: Like, no, I didn't think I was going to say no, I have no money.
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_00: No, I'm in debt.
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_00: It's just a simple, flaky idea that it's intolerable
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_00: that the product that I'm buying does not work.
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_00: I'm just going to make a working version.
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_00: And if I make a working version of the people, buy.
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_00: At that point, you're right to fake a signal in that moment.
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_01: Because ideas are so fragile and that easily not to weigh,
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_01: but anybody.
[00:51:39] SPEAKER_01: It's for experts in dangerous.
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_01: It's for experts in dangerous.
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_01: It's for experts in dangerous.
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_01: Henry Ford said in his autobiography, which I think was published in like 1910,
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_00: if I ever wanted to sabotage my competitors,
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_00: I'd fill their ranks with experts.
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_00: They know so much about why something won't work.
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_00: They'll get no work done.
[00:51:53] SPEAKER_00: That's exactly, exactly.
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_00: You're philosophy in his philosophy.
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_00: There's a lot of overlapping.
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_00: It's just a piece that's so human nature.
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: If you ask people what they want, they want to fast the horse.
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_01: That repeats itself time and time again, many times every day.
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_01: Well, you made a good point.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_00: I heard another, and you said in the book,
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_00: I heard another interview.
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_00: It's like you're asking people to invent the future.
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_00: That's their job.
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_00: That's your job.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_00: What are you doing?
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_00: Let's focus back on this very important point
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_00: that are timing your life that you mentioned.
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_00: So you set up in the coach house.
[00:52:25] You're in debt.
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_00: You have more money.
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_00: So how are you funding things?
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_00: I know your wife is like selling art,
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_00: but do you go immediately to the bank, take out another mortgage?
[00:52:32] SPEAKER_00: Like what do you actually do?
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_00: Exactly that.
[00:52:35] I went to the bank to take out a mortgage.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_01: And Jeremy Fry guaranteed part of it.
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: So he said we need, I don't know, about 50,000 pounds
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_01: or something to last two years.
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_01: So he put up a guarantee for 25,000.
[00:52:50] SPEAKER_01: And I put up a guarantee for 25,000.
[00:52:53] So that got the thing started.
[00:52:55] Why could you do it for so cheap?
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_00: Because your only expense was your time?
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_01: I'm working at home.
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_01: My only expense is my time and a few cheap materials.
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_01: I couldn't buy a lathe or equipment.
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_01: I was doing it all with little black and decals and things like that.
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_01: It was by hand.
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_01: I was making cyclones by rolling in rollers.
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_01: I went and bought some antique metal rollers
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_01: down a junk store for 25 pounds.
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_01: And I could roll cyclones.
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_01: You know, they're a funny shape.
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_01: I could sort of upside down cone and solder them together.
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_01: So I was doing everything by hand.
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_01: But I could do that.
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it works.
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_01: You can do things for nothing.
[00:53:35] You don't need to spend a lot of money.
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_01: And you thought I'll be able to figure this out two years.
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:53:41] SPEAKER_01: It took how long?
[00:53:42] Five years.
[00:53:44] And I'm still doing it.
[00:53:46] You're not under great financial strain at the moment.
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_01: Actually, I thought I'd do it quicker than two years.
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_01: I thought I'd do it within a year.
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_01: But I discovered the raw sorts of problems.
[00:54:00] SPEAKER_01: And also, with almost any idea, you find
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_01: that when you start to apply for a patent,
[00:54:05] SPEAKER_01: that people who tried to do it before and patented things,
[00:54:09] SPEAKER_01: there's very, very few patents we file.
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_01: Absolutely.
[00:54:12] SPEAKER_00: That was a, you had to have something that was patentable, right?
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:54:16] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:54:17] SPEAKER_00: Because we were going to try and license it.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:54:19] SPEAKER_01: So we had to have a good strong patent,
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_01: which we ended up having a good strong patent.
[00:54:24] SPEAKER_01: Because we made an interesting discovery by accident.
[00:54:28] SPEAKER_01: Because if you're doing enough experiments,
[00:54:32] SPEAKER_01: you're trying to be logical what you're doing.
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_01: But sometimes something occurs that's not logical.
[00:54:41] And it works.
[00:54:43] So you've just got to keep trying.
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_01: That will happen to you.
[00:54:46] SPEAKER_01: This is why you're such a big believer in the Edisonian
[00:54:49] SPEAKER_00: principle of design, where I think in the book,
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_00: you say the biggest problem you have with young people,
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_00: even though you like working with them,
[00:54:55] SPEAKER_00: is teaching them one change at a time.
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_00: Record would happen.
[00:55:00] SPEAKER_00: There are instances come in here.
[00:55:01] SPEAKER_00: Something's not working.
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_00: It's changed 15 things.
[00:55:03] SPEAKER_00: And your point is how do you know what of the 15 things
[00:55:06] SPEAKER_00: you have done have changed?
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_00: So at this point, you're doing, you have thick.
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_00: Like, I know a lot about you because I've
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_00: been studying you for nine years.
[00:55:14] You work, you've been working with your hands
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_00: your entire life.
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_00: Are you still working with your hands?
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_00: No, not much.
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_00: OK.
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_00: You're a failure.
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_00: You're useless.
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_00: I can't do anything with them now.
[00:55:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but this is like somebody that lifts a lot of weights,
[00:55:25] SPEAKER_00: but with their hands, I'm like, I was not prepared for how,
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_00: like, your hands are huge and your fingers are,
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_00: they don't fit the rest of your body.
[00:55:33] SPEAKER_00: No, they work on those hands.
[00:55:36] SPEAKER_01: In fact, they're not actually fingerprint thing at airports.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't work for me.
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_01: It won't thin.
[00:55:41] SPEAKER_01: There's no line.
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_01: And it's fun, actually, working with your hands and your brain.
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_01: It's something that schools despise for some reason.
[00:55:49] SPEAKER_01: This is going to sound really weird to you, maybe won't.
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_00: But because my entire work is all digital, right?
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_00: I read a book.
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_00: I sit down.
[00:55:57] I record into a microphone that's digital.
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_00: It's a connection to computer.
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_00: It goes out into the world.
[00:56:01] SPEAKER_00: I don't, you know, I just see numbers go up on a screen.
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_00: It's just, I'm by myself the whole time.
[00:56:06] SPEAKER_00: I, one thing that I do, which is kind of working with my hands,
[00:56:10] SPEAKER_00: is I've insisted on, I edit all the transcripts of every single
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_00: episode by hand.
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_00: And that is literally me going in there and changing a sentence
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_00: or a word or adding punctuation.
[00:56:20] SPEAKER_00: If I ever do anything else or in addition, even just for fun,
[00:56:23] SPEAKER_00: it has to be something physical.
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_00: Like I don't want to just have, I feel I'm missing out on something.
[00:56:27] SPEAKER_00: And I'm trying to approximate that by like physically touching,
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_00: you know, piece of paper.
[00:56:32] SPEAKER_00: This is why the books look like they do.
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_00: And I don't read digital copies.
[00:56:34] SPEAKER_00: And like I like, I sit down with a pen, a ruler,
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_00: you know, post-it notes, scissors.
[00:56:41] SPEAKER_00: Like I feel like it's like arts and crafts over here.
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_00: But there's just some weird satisfaction I get out of working
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_00: with my hands.
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_00: My hands don't look like yourself from like, you know,
[00:56:50] SPEAKER_00: five decades of this.
[00:56:50] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's something that slightly despises school.
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_01: People look good with their hands.
[00:56:54] SPEAKER_01: So you can mend cars and do plumbing and so on.
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_01: The entire world that we inhabit is physical.
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_01: Well, yes, exactly.
[00:57:00] SPEAKER_01: I mean, that's how man started it.
[00:57:02] SPEAKER_01: So we built this and like the building that we're in.
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_01: We want to be intellectuals.
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to involve the dirty work.
[00:57:09] And it's great shame because I think that's why we've lost
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_01: as countries, they've belitted, make things.
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_01: Manufacturing is vanishing from manufacturing
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_01: made in America.
[00:57:19] SPEAKER_01: They've graced them great.
[00:57:20] SPEAKER_01: And we've got so many countries.
[00:57:21] SPEAKER_01: That's good at it.
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_00: Great.
[00:57:23] SPEAKER_00: History again.
[00:57:24] SPEAKER_00: And history beating.
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_00: Hey, yeah.
[00:57:26] SPEAKER_00: Why do you think?
[00:57:27] SPEAKER_00: I love what you said.
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_00: We're going to go back to this.
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_00: But you have this great thing that growing up in Britain
[00:57:32] SPEAKER_00: at the time you did, you know, they still remember Churchill
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_00: and World War II and everything else.
[00:57:36] SPEAKER_00: You know, like, well, one thing that we learned
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_00: and we were taught was like, we're not the weak ones.
[00:57:39] SPEAKER_00: Like we can actually persevere through
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_00: to unbelievably difficult times where it looks like the end
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_00: is near and not give up and actually come on the other side
[00:57:46] SPEAKER_00: as the as the victor.
[00:57:47] SPEAKER_00: I think that was very important.
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_00: So you you you borrowed the money.
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_00: You're doing one prototype a day, two, like a one or two
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_00: a day.
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, day off to day off to day.
[00:57:59] SPEAKER_00: And you say in the book, you know, I can celebrate now
[00:58:02] SPEAKER_00: because my company, you know, it's we're doing like 300
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_00: million a year.
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_00: I think when the book ends or something like that,
[00:58:07] but I'd be lying to you if I says there were days
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_00: where I'd fail all day long, go in the house covered
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_00: in dust and dirt and essentially like getting the bed
[00:58:17] thinking, I may just go on building prototype
[00:58:20] SPEAKER_00: after prototype after prototype and never succeeding forever.
[00:58:24] SPEAKER_00: What was your inner monologue during that time?
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_00: Like how are you convincing yourself not to quit?
[00:58:30] SPEAKER_01: Well, there's hope, a thing called hope.
[00:58:32] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:58:33] SPEAKER_01: Expectation.
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_01: I don't mean I don't mean expecting something to work.
[00:58:37] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the excitement of going in the next day
[00:58:40] SPEAKER_01: and seeing if the next experiment is better.
[00:58:43] SPEAKER_01: Or we know why is it better or where is it taking me?
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_01: So it's a journey of discovery, which is interesting.
[00:58:51] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it doesn't sound from the outside.
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_01: It sounds very boring and worrying and all that sort of thing.
[00:58:56] SPEAKER_01: And it was true.
[00:58:57] SPEAKER_01: It was worrying.
[00:58:58] SPEAKER_01: The debt was getting bigger all the time.
[00:59:01] SPEAKER_01: But I was getting a little closer, a little closer,
[00:59:04] SPEAKER_01: and a little closer.
[00:59:05] SPEAKER_01: And yet made it work and I hadn't got a product.
[00:59:09] SPEAKER_01: But I was actually enjoying the process,
[00:59:12] even getting covered in dust.
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_01: Because our engineers do their own tests
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_01: and build their own prototypes.
[00:59:21] SPEAKER_01: Because there's something funny about the process
[00:59:24] SPEAKER_01: of actually making the prototype yourself
[00:59:27] that you learn and when it fails,
[00:59:30] SPEAKER_01: you may have been something you noticed
[00:59:32] SPEAKER_01: as you were gluing it together or machining apart.
[00:59:35] SPEAKER_01: That sort of visceral experience makes you get
[00:59:41] forward.
[00:59:43] SPEAKER_01: Whereas if you, someone else builds a prototype
[00:59:45] SPEAKER_01: and someone else does the test and you look at the test results,
[00:59:48] you haven't got that same involvement.
[00:59:51] SPEAKER_01: That same us understanding of it.
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_00: The understanding, again, quoting Charlie Munger,
[00:59:55] SPEAKER_00: his old point was that he thought that the spreading
[00:59:59] SPEAKER_00: of the theory of comparative advantage
[01:00:02] SPEAKER_00: is actually really dangerous.
[01:00:03] SPEAKER_00: Because yeah, you can outsource like,
[01:00:05] SPEAKER_00: oh, this country over here can manufacture and will do finance.
[01:00:08] SPEAKER_00: He's like, but there's knowledge and trial and error.
[01:00:11] And the country, the country that is doing the manufacturing
[01:00:15] SPEAKER_00: is actually learning at a way faster rate than you
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_00: because all day long, they're just doing trial and error.
[01:00:19] SPEAKER_00: So it's not, he's like, the problem with people
[01:00:21] SPEAKER_00: that come with the theories is it's the first order
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_00: effect is fine.
[01:00:24] SPEAKER_00: You're not considering, you're just ignoring the second,
[01:00:26] SPEAKER_00: third, fourth, fifth order effects
[01:00:28] SPEAKER_00: and what's gonna happen over a long period of time.
[01:00:30] SPEAKER_00: I've never heard anybody, it was in this book
[01:00:32] SPEAKER_00: called Port Charlie's Omnick.
[01:00:33] SPEAKER_00: I was like, I've never even thought of that before.
[01:00:35] SPEAKER_00: I went to school for business and they teach you
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_00: all these things.
[01:00:37] SPEAKER_00: I think Walker's actually right about this.
[01:00:39] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, no, it's experiencing the whole thing
[01:00:43] SPEAKER_00: is absolutely critical.
[01:00:44] SPEAKER_00: But were you taking it data time?
[01:00:46] SPEAKER_00: Did you allow yourself to think how far
[01:00:49] SPEAKER_00: was it literally just what was in front of you?
[01:00:51] SPEAKER_00: Like, are you thinking what this is gonna be
[01:00:54] SPEAKER_00: a month now, two years from now during this time?
[01:00:58] Well, I was imagining that if I can make it work,
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_01: but I could then go and show it
[01:01:03] SPEAKER_01: to the existing manufacturers of these flawed vacuum cleaners
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_01: with horrible bags in them, smelly, noisy, dusty,
[01:01:10] SPEAKER_01: expensive bags, that someone would snap it up.
[01:01:14] That's what that was the, what was in my mind.
[01:01:18] And it wouldn't necessarily make me rich,
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_01: but it might get me out of debt.
[01:01:21] SPEAKER_01: Money in finances now, a driver cue.
[01:01:26] No, no, I have to survive and live, of course.
[01:01:30] SPEAKER_01: And money can sometimes be a good determinant
[01:01:33] SPEAKER_01: of whether what you've done is successful or not,
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_01: not always, sometimes it's just not.
[01:01:39] SPEAKER_01: So I don't necessarily develop products
[01:01:42] SPEAKER_01: to make enormous commercial success.
[01:01:45] SPEAKER_01: It's nice to do that, but sometimes you do it
[01:01:48] SPEAKER_01: because you want to do it.
[01:01:50] SPEAKER_01: It might be a small success.
[01:01:51] SPEAKER_01: I think there's a very simple genius to your approach
[01:01:54] SPEAKER_00: in company building it.
[01:01:55] SPEAKER_00: I think this is why I keep recommending your books
[01:01:57] SPEAKER_00: over here again, because there is just a simple,
[01:01:59] SPEAKER_00: beautiful, elegant genius to the way that you think.
[01:02:02] SPEAKER_00: So this is a hairdryer.
[01:02:04] SPEAKER_00: It's probably a good example of that.
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_01: I used it this morning.
[01:02:06] SPEAKER_01: Oh, it's excellent.
[01:02:08] SPEAKER_01: Because we were making vacuum cleaners
[01:02:10] SPEAKER_01: and cooling products, the heating products and so on.
[01:02:14] SPEAKER_01: And we had done this tiny motor
[01:02:17] SPEAKER_01: and we thought we could make an even smaller one,
[01:02:19] SPEAKER_01: it'd be done that motor.
[01:02:20] SPEAKER_01: We could make an even smaller one.
[01:02:22] And that would make a great hairdryer.
[01:02:23] SPEAKER_01: Instead of these bulky, great motors, they have in the moment.
[01:02:27] So that was the start of it.
[01:02:28] SPEAKER_01: But everyone's-
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_01: And these are discovered by Trowener.
[01:02:32] SPEAKER_01: Yes, well, very early on in the vacuum cleaner business,
[01:02:36] SPEAKER_01: we were buying these big, heavy vacuum cleaner motors,
[01:02:38] SPEAKER_01: something not one here, but they're big.
[01:02:41] SPEAKER_01: And they go at 30,000 RPM.
[01:02:43] SPEAKER_01: And the theory is, the faster you make a motor go,
[01:02:47] SPEAKER_01: the smaller it can be, the fewer materials
[01:02:50] SPEAKER_01: it can have, and the more electrically efficient it is.
[01:02:53] So quite early on, we realized that we needed
[01:02:57] SPEAKER_01: to develop a new type of electric motor,
[01:02:59] SPEAKER_01: because electric motors, this sort of thing,
[01:03:01] SPEAKER_01: haven't really changed for 150 years.
[01:03:04] SPEAKER_01: It's the same Faraday idea.
[01:03:07] SPEAKER_01: So we were all cheekily as people
[01:03:11] SPEAKER_01: who don't make electric motors.
[01:03:13] SPEAKER_01: We thought, let's make a new type of motor.
[01:03:17] SPEAKER_01: So I recruited some people from British universities
[01:03:20] SPEAKER_01: who were academics who knew about electric motors.
[01:03:24] SPEAKER_01: And we started as a non-electric motor manufacturer
[01:03:27] SPEAKER_01: developing our own motor.
[01:03:28] SPEAKER_01: It took a long time to 10 years.
[01:03:30] SPEAKER_01: 10 years before you had success in the two.
[01:03:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:03:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:03:34] And you can say we were being stupid and all that sort of thing,
[01:03:36] SPEAKER_01: but no one had done this before.
[01:03:38] SPEAKER_01: No one had done made a mosa go 140,000 RPM.
[01:03:42] Let's jump.
[01:03:42] We're going to jump back and forth, because the dentist drill,
[01:03:45] SPEAKER_01: but that only lasts a few seconds.
[01:03:48] So let's jump back and forth between the history
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_00: of building a company where you're doing now.
[01:03:52] SPEAKER_00: When you're thinking about the products you're making now,
[01:03:57] are you starting with, because you
[01:03:58] SPEAKER_00: seem to be my understanding and correct me from wrong,
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_00: one of the best companies in the world are making motors.
[01:04:03] SPEAKER_00: Electric motors.
[01:04:04] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:04:05] SPEAKER_00: And so I feel that now you're like, what else?
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_00: We have this skill set.
[01:04:08] SPEAKER_00: We have the company's 45 years old, something like that.
[01:04:12] SPEAKER_00: What we have this world class skill set,
[01:04:15] SPEAKER_00: are there other products that we find deficient
[01:04:18] SPEAKER_00: in need of renewal that we can apply our ability
[01:04:22] and world class talent at building electric motors too?
[01:04:25] SPEAKER_00: Is that a process of product development for you?
[01:04:28] SPEAKER_01: It can be.
[01:04:29] SPEAKER_01: OK.
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_01: And we have the brilliant idea of doing electric car.
[01:04:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:04:35] Because sitting in your, we make electric mosa,
[01:04:38] SPEAKER_01: we make filtration and cooling devices.
[01:04:43] SPEAKER_01: Let's talk about the car.
[01:04:44] SPEAKER_01: And we're developing batteries.
[01:04:45] SPEAKER_01: Let's talk about the car.
[01:04:46] SPEAKER_01: So we thought, oh, we should do an electric car.
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_01: When was this?
[01:04:50] SPEAKER_01: 2014.
[01:04:52] OK.
[01:04:53] And I looked at the, what the industries were predicting.
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_01: And they said 2% electric cars by 2030.
[01:05:00] And I thought they got that wrong.
[01:05:01] SPEAKER_01: That can't be right.
[01:05:03] So we started developing electric car.
[01:05:05] SPEAKER_01: We're developing batteries, by the way.
[01:05:07] SPEAKER_01: New technology was still on.
[01:05:08] SPEAKER_01: So the battery is actually on batteries too?
[01:05:11] SPEAKER_01: Not yet.
[01:05:12] Not yet.
[01:05:12] But you want it.
[01:05:13] SPEAKER_01: We want it.
[01:05:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_01: What a surprise.
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_01: You want control or a...
[01:05:16] And you had an interesting act.
[01:05:18] SPEAKER_00: New technology ones, not ordinary ones.
[01:05:20] SPEAKER_01: So we said we're developing batteries with electric motors,
[01:05:24] SPEAKER_01: one of our things.
[01:05:26] SPEAKER_01: Air treatment is another one of our things.
[01:05:28] SPEAKER_01: That's pretty much an electric car.
[01:05:32] So we started developing one.
[01:05:35] What...
[01:05:36] SPEAKER_01: And then we got to 2017.
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_01: And dieselgate happened.
[01:05:39] SPEAKER_01: So the first three or four years, Tesla was everything,
[01:05:43] SPEAKER_01: Tesla was doing everything very successfully.
[01:05:47] SPEAKER_01: But no one was taking any notice of that.
[01:05:48] SPEAKER_01: The author, Tesla, was a flash on the panel or something.
[01:05:52] SPEAKER_01: They were ignoring it because it was such a different thing
[01:05:55] SPEAKER_01: for them to do.
[01:05:56] SPEAKER_01: They make internal combustion engines,
[01:05:58] SPEAKER_01: not electric motors and batteries.
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_01: So dieselgate changed all that.
[01:06:04] SPEAKER_01: They realized, part of an PR point of view,
[01:06:06] SPEAKER_01: but also this horrific reaction to dieselgate,
[01:06:09] SPEAKER_01: that they had to get into electric cars.
[01:06:12] SPEAKER_01: So all, most of the big manufacturers immediately jumped
[01:06:15] SPEAKER_01: into electric cars and made them.
[01:06:18] SPEAKER_01: And they make it terrific loss on.
[01:06:20] But...
[01:06:21] SPEAKER_01: Electric cars are very extensive things to make.
[01:06:23] SPEAKER_01: Battery is incredibly expensive.
[01:06:25] SPEAKER_01: The electronics involved in the batteries are expensive.
[01:06:28] SPEAKER_01: The batteries are very heavy.
[01:06:30] SPEAKER_01: So it's a very different type of car and very expensive to make.
[01:06:35] SPEAKER_01: I'm much more expensive than the internal combustion engine.
[01:06:38] SPEAKER_01: They were selling them at a loss for a complicated reason.
[01:06:42] Car manufacturers emissions, which are controlled by law,
[01:06:46] SPEAKER_01: are based on their overall emissions
[01:06:48] SPEAKER_01: from their range of cars.
[01:06:51] So if they had not the individual model...
[01:06:53] SPEAKER_01: Not the individual model.
[01:06:54] SPEAKER_01: So if they had a model which didn't emit anything,
[01:06:59] they could go on making big gas gas vehicles
[01:07:01] SPEAKER_01: in which they make a lot of money.
[01:07:03] SPEAKER_01: So they're prepared to lose money on the electric car
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_01: to make the money on the big gas gas and SUV order, it is.
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_01: So Tesla and us were just electric vehicle manufacturers.
[01:07:19] SPEAKER_01: Tesla is brilliant and in a $30 billion gone into a huge investment.
[01:07:23] SPEAKER_01: I'm a little company on my own.
[01:07:26] And I have faced a very uncertain future
[01:07:28] SPEAKER_01: trying to settle an electric car in that sort of setup.
[01:07:34] And if you have fairly no volume in your new manufacturer,
[01:07:38] SPEAKER_01: all your cars are 30% higher.
[01:07:42] Because you're not buying very many seats
[01:07:45] SPEAKER_01: and the seat manufacturer or very many tires
[01:07:47] SPEAKER_01: with a time manufacturer and so on.
[01:07:48] SPEAKER_01: So all your cars are much higher.
[01:07:50] SPEAKER_01: And we knew that because of the...
[01:07:51] SPEAKER_01: You know, a series of structural disadvantages.
[01:07:53] SPEAKER_00: Huge disadvantages.
[01:07:54] SPEAKER_01: And Tesla came up through sheer scale and my investment.
[01:07:59] SPEAKER_01: But we didn't have that sort of money.
[01:08:01] SPEAKER_01: We couldn't take that sort of risk.
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_01: So we stopped it.
[01:08:04] SPEAKER_01: And how much did you spend on R&D for that?
[01:08:07] SPEAKER_01: Well, we spent about 750,000.
[01:08:10] SPEAKER_01: So I'm a million.
[01:08:11] SPEAKER_01: I was going to get a million, 750,000 dollars.
[01:08:14] SPEAKER_01: I keep working in pounds, half a billion pounds.
[01:08:16] SPEAKER_00: OK, so 750 million.
[01:08:18] SPEAKER_00: And you have the actual prototype sitting in your headquarters,
[01:08:24] SPEAKER_00: I think, in Singapore.
[01:08:25] Yeah, we've got one that...
[01:08:26] SPEAKER_00: Is there anyone that you can at least drive?
[01:08:28] SPEAKER_00: Or they're just...
[01:08:29] SPEAKER_00: There was one we could drive very slowly,
[01:08:30] SPEAKER_01: but health and safety meant we couldn't take out.
[01:08:33] SPEAKER_01: We built one of the final sort of...
[01:08:36] Where's that one?
[01:08:37] SPEAKER_01: Is that the one in Singapore?
[01:08:37] SPEAKER_01: No, no, no.
[01:08:38] SPEAKER_01: That's a model in Singapore.
[01:08:39] SPEAKER_01: No, no, we've got it in one of our hangers on our airfield.
[01:08:43] SPEAKER_01: OK.
[01:08:44] SPEAKER_00: Do you get in any more and just drive around?
[01:08:46] SPEAKER_00: No, no.
[01:08:47] SPEAKER_00: Are you...
[01:08:47] SPEAKER_00: It's too painful.
[01:08:48] SPEAKER_00: Like, would you get in a car or a car or a car or a car or a car or a car or a car or a car or a car or a car or a car?
[01:08:51] SPEAKER_00: One of the everybody said, you know, you must have learned a lot from that experience.
[01:08:55] SPEAKER_01: So the answer to that is absolutely nothing.
[01:08:59] What do you mean?
[01:09:00] SPEAKER_01: Oh, no, I did.
[01:09:01] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it was fun to do, but we...
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_01: It was fun to do.
[01:09:05] SPEAKER_01: It was fun to do.
[01:09:06] SPEAKER_01: And half the people were snapped up by other manufacturers.
[01:09:10] SPEAKER_01: And half the people working on it came to work on and do fat concuners.
[01:09:14] SPEAKER_01: I didn't even think of them emotional.
[01:09:17] SPEAKER_00: Think about if you worked on something for a decade and you ain't going anywhere.
[01:09:19] SPEAKER_00: They must feel...
[01:09:20] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:09:21] SPEAKER_01: Quite a decade, five or six years.
[01:09:22] SPEAKER_01: Five or six years.
[01:09:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:09:24] SPEAKER_01: No, it's so awful thing to do.
[01:09:26] SPEAKER_01: But sadly, we didn't really learn anything from it.
[01:09:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:09:33] All of the founders and extreme winners that I have studied have this one trait in common.
[01:09:36] SPEAKER_00: They have excessively high energy levels.
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_00: After spending several hours with James Dyson, it was obvious that he is high energy too.
[01:09:43] SPEAKER_00: If you're going to be the best at what you do, you need to maximize your energy and output.
[01:09:47] SPEAKER_00: And that's why I've partnered with Function.
[01:09:49] SPEAKER_00: I signed up for Function long before.
[01:09:51] SPEAKER_00: They were a sponsor of this podcast.
[01:09:53] SPEAKER_00: And when you sign up, they ask you what your health goals are.
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_00: And my response in all capital letters was maximum energy.
[01:10:00] SPEAKER_00: Function provides access to comprehensive blood tests and other lab testing
[01:10:03] SPEAKER_00: to help you improve your health so you can perform at your highest level.

[01:10:59] What is an example of you taking the existing skill set
[01:11:03] SPEAKER_00: that Dyson has built up over many decades and applying it successfully to a new product
[01:11:09] SPEAKER_00: that did not come from, like that's the actual sequence of events.
[01:11:13] SPEAKER_00: You didn't identify the product first, you're just like,
[01:11:15] SPEAKER_00: well, we have the skill set, what can we apply it to?
[01:11:18] Did you have hair dryers? What's an example of that?
[01:11:20] SPEAKER_00: Yes, I mean, the way we approach the car was slightly dangerous.
[01:11:26] SPEAKER_01: Because we were saying, look, we've got these skill sets.
[01:11:30] SPEAKER_01: You were kind of matching.
[01:11:30] SPEAKER_01: And we were saying, oh, it looks very well in the car.
[01:11:34] SPEAKER_01: Without really saying, is that going to be a successful product?
[01:11:39] SPEAKER_01: Is it going to be a breakthrough product?
[01:11:41] SPEAKER_01: Well, it might have been a breakthrough product if we had managed to do the battery.
[01:11:45] SPEAKER_01: And certainly our motors be developed were very efficient motors.
[01:11:49] Electric cars all about efficiency,
[01:11:51] SPEAKER_01: quite aerodynamic efficiency, drive motor efficiency,
[01:11:54] SPEAKER_01: and so that you can have better, smaller batteries.
[01:11:59] SPEAKER_01: Power consumption is a big thing.
[01:12:01] SPEAKER_00: But the sixth to a quarter of the power is taken up by air conditionally.
[01:12:06] SPEAKER_01: And he's in, for example.
[01:12:07] SPEAKER_01: So if you can make that more efficient, you can make a cargo further.
[01:12:10] SPEAKER_01: So it's sort of really a part.
[01:12:12] SPEAKER_01: How far can you go on the battery?
[01:12:15] SPEAKER_01: How do you come up with a new product?
[01:12:16] SPEAKER_00: I know you're very secretive.
[01:12:18] SPEAKER_00: You don't talk about things you haven't really shared.
[01:12:19] SPEAKER_00: No, it's a very good question.
[01:12:20] SPEAKER_00: I didn't answer it properly.
[01:12:23] SPEAKER_01: There's two ways.
[01:12:24] SPEAKER_01: One is you realize you have a technology,
[01:12:27] and you can make a hair dryer.
[01:12:29] SPEAKER_01: How many of these do you make now?
[01:12:31] SPEAKER_01: Motors.
[01:12:31] SPEAKER_01: Oh, we've made about 150 million of them.
[01:12:34] SPEAKER_01: A year though, now.
[01:12:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we make about 30 million.
[01:12:37] SPEAKER_01: And it's very interesting.
[01:12:38] SPEAKER_00: In the book, you said that companies, other companies try
[01:12:41] SPEAKER_00: to get you to make motors for them.
[01:12:42] SPEAKER_00: And you adamantly refuse.
[01:12:44] SPEAKER_00: Is that still correct?
[01:12:45] SPEAKER_00: That's correct.
[01:12:45] SPEAKER_00: And I love what you said,
[01:12:46] SPEAKER_00: because you want your engineers focus exclusively on your own products.
[01:12:51] SPEAKER_00: It's important to focus as opposed to retrofitting your technology
[01:12:55] SPEAKER_00: to somebody else's product and somebody else's shop.
[01:12:57] SPEAKER_00: It's not a good commercial decision that, by the way,
[01:12:59] SPEAKER_01: the one I've taken.
[01:13:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but you're, because I could have a division that dealt with
[01:13:05] SPEAKER_01: other people, spline mates to other people,
[01:13:07] SPEAKER_01: which I'm sure would night, Monday.
[01:13:09] SPEAKER_01: Okay, this is very interesting.
[01:13:11] SPEAKER_00: I think this is missing in business.
[01:13:12] SPEAKER_00: I am, we talked about before we started recording,
[01:13:15] SPEAKER_00: I had this idea of anti-business billionaire.
[01:13:17] SPEAKER_00: These people that are so obsessed with the quality of the product
[01:13:20] SPEAKER_00: they're making, that's their number one.
[01:13:22] SPEAKER_00: They just want to make the best possible product.
[01:13:24] SPEAKER_00: They do things that may seem irrational,
[01:13:26] SPEAKER_00: because it would improve the quality of the product.
[01:13:29] SPEAKER_00: And the point I'd make is there's, I think you're one of them,
[01:13:32] SPEAKER_00: there's a series of people I've read about,
[01:13:34] SPEAKER_00: where people like that that are just obsessed with making the best product
[01:13:37] SPEAKER_00: for customers to solve an actual real need.
[01:13:40] SPEAKER_00: And retain control.
[01:13:42] SPEAKER_00: They wind up with the money anyways,
[01:13:44] SPEAKER_00: but that's not the motivator.
[01:13:46] SPEAKER_00: So why explain your rationale?
[01:13:49] SPEAKER_00: I think it's a right rationale, but I'm very curious if you can actually articulate it.
[01:13:53] SPEAKER_00: Why do you not set up this other division?
[01:13:55] SPEAKER_00: That you wouldn't have to run,
[01:13:56] SPEAKER_00: that would just make a bunch of money doing this thing.
[01:13:59] SPEAKER_00: Why don't you do that?
[01:14:00] SPEAKER_00: Because that doesn't excite me.
[01:14:02] SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
[01:14:03] SPEAKER_01: You don't forget the point of life is for living.
[01:14:06] SPEAKER_01: I know that's making money.
[01:14:07] SPEAKER_01: That's developing into long-term,
[01:14:10] SPEAKER_01: coming out with different radical products.
[01:14:12] SPEAKER_01: That's what interests me.
[01:14:13] SPEAKER_01: Not making money, per se.
[01:14:15] SPEAKER_01: How long have you had the discipline to adhere to that?
[01:14:17] SPEAKER_00: I'm just following excitement.
[01:14:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm following curiosity.
[01:14:21] SPEAKER_00: I'm following interest.
[01:14:22] SPEAKER_00: How long have you been like that forever?
[01:14:24] SPEAKER_00: I think so. Yes.
[01:14:25] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:14:26] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:14:26] SPEAKER_01: I'm very single-minded
[01:14:29] and not being distracted by things.
[01:14:32] SPEAKER_01: And actually, it's really important that,
[01:14:33] SPEAKER_01: because when you start running a business or doing things,
[01:14:40] SPEAKER_01: you have too much to do.
[01:14:42] SPEAKER_01: There's too much to do.
[01:14:43] SPEAKER_01: So you have to make all the time.
[01:14:44] SPEAKER_01: You have to make a choice.
[01:14:45] SPEAKER_01: What's the most important thing to do?
[01:14:47] SPEAKER_01: What's the most important thing to do?
[01:14:49] SPEAKER_01: If you get to be a big business, that's still important.
[01:14:53] Same worry about that.
[01:14:54] SPEAKER_01: Well, if you get big, there's a tendency to think
[01:14:57] SPEAKER_01: you've got lots of people,
[01:14:58] SPEAKER_01: so you can do everything.
[01:15:00] But you can't.
[01:15:01] SPEAKER_01: You can't do everything.
[01:15:02] SPEAKER_01: You can't do everything well.
[01:15:05] SPEAKER_01: And you probably can't do anything anyway.
[01:15:07] SPEAKER_01: So the important thing is to decide what's really the most important thing.
[01:15:11] SPEAKER_01: And just do that.
[01:15:12] SPEAKER_01: And they're going to be things you don't do.
[01:15:14] SPEAKER_01: And there's going to be some failures,
[01:15:15] SPEAKER_01: because you're not doing things.
[01:15:17] SPEAKER_01: But if you're doing something really, really well,
[01:15:20] then you'll be okay.
[01:15:21] SPEAKER_01: How do you go about deciding what's the most important thing for you?
[01:15:23] SPEAKER_01: Well, that's the fun.
[01:15:27] SPEAKER_01: That's fun.
[01:15:28] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's, you decide the most important thing.
[01:15:31] SPEAKER_01: That's an important decision.
[01:15:34] And you say, well, I haven't got time to do the other things.
[01:15:37] SPEAKER_01: I won't do it.
[01:15:38] SPEAKER_01: Will one of those kill me?
[01:15:39] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[01:15:40] SPEAKER_01: Probably not.
[01:15:41] SPEAKER_01: So I'll concentrate on the thing I really want to do,
[01:15:44] SPEAKER_01: which I think is the right thing to do.
[01:15:46] Is single-mindedness and focus the same thing to you?
[01:15:48] SPEAKER_01: Or do you mean different things?
[01:15:49] SPEAKER_00: Yes, it's the same thing.
[01:15:50] SPEAKER_00: It's the same thing.
[01:15:52] SPEAKER_01: If your brain isn't very big, which mine isn't,
[01:15:53] SPEAKER_01: it's a much better way to do, to run your life.
[01:15:57] SPEAKER_01: It's just to concentrate on one thing at a time.
[01:16:00] But you have multiple product lines.
[01:16:03] Yeah, that's stretching my brain a bit.
[01:16:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but yes.
[01:16:06] SPEAKER_01: Yes, and I'm learning to manage that in myself.
[01:16:10] SPEAKER_01: I've got lots of wonder people around me,
[01:16:12] SPEAKER_01: helping me, including my son.
[01:16:14] SPEAKER_00: No.
[01:16:14] SPEAKER_00: I know you did the vacuum cleaner first,
[01:16:16] SPEAKER_00: and you did the vacuum cleaner as the only product
[01:16:18] SPEAKER_00: that they sent for how long?
[01:16:19] SPEAKER_00: Eight years, probably.
[01:16:20] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so yeah, focus.
[01:16:22] SPEAKER_00: And then was the washing machine the second?
[01:16:24] SPEAKER_00: The washing machine came on quite early,
[01:16:26] SPEAKER_01: after about four or five years.
[01:16:27] SPEAKER_01: But it didn't work.
[01:16:29] It didn't work very well.
[01:16:30] SPEAKER_01: Don't say that to me.
[01:16:32] SPEAKER_01: That's it.
[01:16:34] No, and I made another mistake with that.
[01:16:37] SPEAKER_01: Which was that,
[01:16:39] you know, I've been making vacuum cleaners
[01:16:40] SPEAKER_01: that are about $300, $200, $300.
[01:16:45] SPEAKER_01: The washing machine was $1,200, $1,300.
[01:16:51] So it was more expensive
[01:16:52] SPEAKER_01: than other people's washing machines.
[01:16:55] Yeah, but the vacuum cleaner was more expensive
[01:16:56] SPEAKER_00: than other vacuum cleaner.
[01:16:57] SPEAKER_00: So I wasn't learning from history.
[01:17:02] My marketing people said,
[01:17:03] SPEAKER_01: if you make it cheaper, you'll sell a lot more.
[01:17:08] All right, so for the last time in my life,
[01:17:10] SPEAKER_01: I listened to them.
[01:17:11] SPEAKER_01: And you know,
[01:17:14] SPEAKER_01: marketing people get on selling things,
[01:17:16] SPEAKER_01: not decide what product should be
[01:17:19] SPEAKER_01: or how much it should be sold for.
[01:17:20] SPEAKER_01: So I listened to them and we didn't sell anymore.
[01:17:22] SPEAKER_01: We just lost more money.
[01:17:25] And the other directors,
[01:17:28] SPEAKER_01: not exactly directors,
[01:17:29] SPEAKER_01: said you've got to stop that
[01:17:30] SPEAKER_01: because they were losing money at it.
[01:17:32] Actually, if I'd been on my own,
[01:17:34] SPEAKER_01: I'd have probably gone on with it and put the price up.
[01:17:37] But, you know, sometimes you have to listen to other people.
[01:17:40] SPEAKER_01: And they were probably right.
[01:17:41] SPEAKER_01: So we brought it behind us and got on with what we were doing.
[01:17:44] SPEAKER_01: They're still in operation though.
[01:17:46] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, I use them.
[01:17:47] SPEAKER_01: I mean,
[01:17:47] SPEAKER_01: you have your own down there.
[01:17:48] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
[01:17:49] SPEAKER_01: Why should she?
[01:17:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's great.
[01:17:51] SPEAKER_01: It's great.
[01:17:52] SPEAKER_01: And people now copy it a lot of the ideas,
[01:17:55] SPEAKER_01: like the big door.
[01:17:56] SPEAKER_01: You know, if you're trying to put the dovet,
[01:17:57] SPEAKER_01: and it's tiny little hole.
[01:18:02] SPEAKER_01: And it was very expensive to make, actually.
[01:18:04] SPEAKER_01: And I should have learnt my lesson from that
[01:18:06] SPEAKER_01: because it had two drums,
[01:18:07] SPEAKER_01: had two motors and a gearbox
[01:18:09] SPEAKER_01: that had a lot of things
[01:18:10] SPEAKER_01: that other washing machines don't have.
[01:18:12] SPEAKER_01: But it did a very good job.
[01:18:13] SPEAKER_01: It was a very good washing machine.
[01:18:15] SPEAKER_01: It begs the question,
[01:18:16] SPEAKER_00: are there any other Dyson products
[01:18:18] SPEAKER_00: that you own that are not available to consumers?
[01:18:21] SPEAKER_00: What else have you made for your class about this?
[01:18:23] SPEAKER_00: I'm keeping in touch about it.
[01:18:24] SPEAKER_01: Tell me after, please.
[01:18:26] SPEAKER_00: I want to hear about this.
[01:18:28] SPEAKER_00: I want to go back to this
[01:18:29] SPEAKER_00: because I do think it's one of the most important things.
[01:18:31] SPEAKER_00: The way I just described this,
[01:18:32] SPEAKER_00: this crazy experience I've been on,
[01:18:34] SPEAKER_00: which, you know,
[01:18:35] SPEAKER_00: I'm probably at the,
[01:18:36] SPEAKER_00: when I'm done,
[01:18:37] SPEAKER_00: I'm probably going to read more biographies
[01:18:38] SPEAKER_00: and autobiographies of, you know,
[01:18:39] SPEAKER_00: entrepreneurs and founders and inventors
[01:18:41] SPEAKER_00: and anybody else in the world.
[01:18:42] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, every is always like,
[01:18:44] SPEAKER_00: give me like a top 10 list or,
[01:18:45] SPEAKER_00: you've like, break it,
[01:18:46] SPEAKER_00: like, can you condense down what you've learned so far?
[01:18:49] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, well, if I can condense it down
[01:18:50] SPEAKER_00: to a one word of how different these people are
[01:18:53] SPEAKER_00: to most people, like the most people
[01:18:55] SPEAKER_00: in, you know, mass humanity,
[01:18:57] SPEAKER_00: it's focus.
[01:18:59] SPEAKER_00: They're un, well, it's one word.
[01:19:00] SPEAKER_00: It's like they're unbelievably focused.
[01:19:02] SPEAKER_00: I still, if you don't mind me,
[01:19:04] SPEAKER_00: just ask you another question,
[01:19:04] SPEAKER_00: just see if you have anything more to say about this
[01:19:06] SPEAKER_00: because it's something I like,
[01:19:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm obsessed with as well.
[01:19:09] SPEAKER_00: How do you figure out what to focus on for you?
[01:19:14] SPEAKER_01: That's a very good question.
[01:19:15] SPEAKER_01: Um, I think it's something
[01:19:18] SPEAKER_01: which you believe could work.
[01:19:21] SPEAKER_01: And that's a breakthrough.
[01:19:22] SPEAKER_01: It's something completely different.
[01:19:23] SPEAKER_01: It's going to do a job much better.
[01:19:26] SPEAKER_01: And that's what you think.
[01:19:28] SPEAKER_01: But of course, you can name it.
[01:19:29] What are you following there?
[01:19:30] SPEAKER_01: Is it intuition?
[01:19:31] SPEAKER_00: Is it just, I can't get this off of my mind?
[01:19:33] SPEAKER_00: Like, what is actually happening?
[01:19:34] SPEAKER_00: It's partly intuition.
[01:19:36] SPEAKER_01: But I don't believe in intuition is
[01:19:40] SPEAKER_01: feeling or guesswork.
[01:19:42] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I think you know, I read on that.
[01:19:46] The intuition is much more interesting
[01:19:47] SPEAKER_01: because it's all sorts of influences.
[01:19:51] SPEAKER_01: It could be, it could be history.
[01:19:52] SPEAKER_01: It could be all sorts of things.
[01:19:54] SPEAKER_01: That, um, a form and opinion
[01:19:58] that, that, um, you define as intuition.
[01:20:02] SPEAKER_01: But actually it's not.
[01:20:03] SPEAKER_01: It's the whole lot of hundreds, thousands
[01:20:06] SPEAKER_01: of things you've experienced
[01:20:08] SPEAKER_01: which help you make a decision
[01:20:10] SPEAKER_01: or give you an insight or give you hope.
[01:20:13] SPEAKER_01: What do you think is guiding you to the right
[01:20:15] SPEAKER_01: to focus on the right thing?
[01:20:16] SPEAKER_01: That's the hard thing.
[01:20:17] SPEAKER_01: I mean, ultimately it's intuition.
[01:20:20] SPEAKER_01: Um, but intuition isn't just, um,
[01:20:24] SPEAKER_01: it's not a fair, it's not a feeling, you know,
[01:20:28] SPEAKER_01: it's, it's, it's, you, you're, your brain has been fed
[01:20:34] SPEAKER_01: with hundreds of different things.
[01:20:35] SPEAKER_01: And from that you make a decision.
[01:20:39] And you can't rationalize it and say,
[01:20:40] SPEAKER_01: oh, that's that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,
[01:20:43] SPEAKER_01: therefore there's equals that.
[01:20:46] SPEAKER_01: It's an intuition that, um, I could be right,
[01:20:49] SPEAKER_01: I could be wrong, but I think I'm going to back
[01:20:52] SPEAKER_01: that I'm right about this.
[01:20:54] And then you've got to make it work.
[01:20:56] Yeah.
[01:20:57] But it's very fragile.
[01:20:58] SPEAKER_01: That early idea, I came back to that with a vacuum cleaner, um,
[01:21:01] SPEAKER_01: you know, the, the site clean idea.
[01:21:03] SPEAKER_01: It's a very fragile idea.
[01:21:05] You can blow it away.
[01:21:06] SPEAKER_01: It's, it's worth nothing.
[01:21:08] And they try to, you're partners with Bob.
[01:21:10] SPEAKER_00: I tried to put it away.
[01:21:11] SPEAKER_00: Everybody tried to lie friends tried to know it's a way.
[01:21:13] SPEAKER_01: One of the things I called if you were right away.
[01:21:16] Yes.
[01:21:16] And then you're, your confidence deepened as you get down the path.
[01:21:20] SPEAKER_00: Uh, were you pretty adamant?
[01:21:21] SPEAKER_00: Like, no, I'm not going to give up until I solve this problem.
[01:21:24] SPEAKER_00: At the beginning.
[01:21:24] SPEAKER_00: That's that.
[01:21:25] SPEAKER_00: At the beginning.
[01:21:25] SPEAKER_00: I got the bug and I'm not, I'm going, I'm going to go on, I'm going to make it work.
[01:21:29] SPEAKER_01: And, um, you know, it took five thousand one day.
[01:21:32] SPEAKER_01: I'm much longer than I thought it was and all that.
[01:21:34] SPEAKER_01: So then I got deeper and deeper into debt.
[01:21:36] SPEAKER_01: But, um, I was going to make it work.
[01:21:40] I got a rat by a tail.
[01:21:41] SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to let it go.
[01:21:42] SPEAKER_01: I've got to make it work.
[01:21:44] I've got to.
[01:21:46] And the more, the bigger the debt got, I suppose the pressure
[01:21:50] SPEAKER_01: became greater and greater.
[01:21:52] The pressure did, but did you have like a lot?
[01:21:54] SPEAKER_00: You had to have laws and confidence and like doubt about that period.
[01:21:58] SPEAKER_00: Well, of course I had doubts.
[01:21:59] SPEAKER_00: And I made it work.
[01:22:01] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:22:01] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:22:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:22:02] SPEAKER_01: I can't pretend you don't have doubts.
[01:22:04] SPEAKER_01: Were you talking to anybody about this?
[01:22:05] SPEAKER_00: A digit, my wife.
[01:22:07] SPEAKER_01: Um, nobody else.
[01:22:09] SPEAKER_01: No, not even Jeremy.
[01:22:10] SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, actually, um, I bought him out.
[01:22:15] You let's go back to that.
[01:22:16] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[01:22:16] SPEAKER_00: It's quite useful.
[01:22:17] SPEAKER_00: Why you bought him out and this is, this is after failing for, if I remember correctly,
[01:22:22] SPEAKER_00: after failing to try to license it.
[01:22:23] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:22:24] SPEAKER_00: The first successful license was Japan, right?
[01:22:27] SPEAKER_00: No.
[01:22:28] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:22:29] SPEAKER_00: What do you mean?
[01:22:29] SPEAKER_00: It's so small.
[01:22:30] SPEAKER_00: You're making like 70,000 a year.
[01:22:31] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:22:32] SPEAKER_00: And they sold it not even to, you weren't even sure they used it because it was like,
[01:22:35] SPEAKER_00: pink, right?
[01:22:36] SPEAKER_00: No, they did use it.
[01:22:37] SPEAKER_00: I thought you said in the book, they like, they may have just been there for like some kind of art.
[01:22:41] SPEAKER_00: Maybe, maybe.
[01:22:43] SPEAKER_01: They didn't sell very many, but they did sell some.
[01:22:45] SPEAKER_01: And I never discovered how many they sell because they're very secretive about it.
[01:22:49] SPEAKER_01: But they did pay me the minimum royalties.
[01:22:51] SPEAKER_01: That's when you bought Jermiel?
[01:22:52] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:22:53] SPEAKER_01: We had a big lawsuit.
[01:22:55] SPEAKER_01: And is this the end way?
[01:22:56] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:22:57] SPEAKER_01: Oh god.
[01:22:58] SPEAKER_01: And he hated lawsuits.
[01:23:00] SPEAKER_01: So when that started, he wanted to get out.
[01:23:03] SPEAKER_01: So I was that contentious, which he knew?
[01:23:05] SPEAKER_01: Did he do it?
[01:23:05] SPEAKER_01: No, no, not at all.
[01:23:07] SPEAKER_01: No, and we remained very good friends after us.
[01:23:09] SPEAKER_01: He just said, I hate lawsuits.
[01:23:11] SPEAKER_01: And my financial advisor thinks the vacuum cleaner is getting nowhere.
[01:23:14] SPEAKER_01: And he owned 49% of the business.
[01:23:17] SPEAKER_01: So what do you buy and off of?
[01:23:18] SPEAKER_01: I bought him out.
[01:23:19] SPEAKER_01: How much money though?
[01:23:20] SPEAKER_01: 45,000 pounds.
[01:23:23] This is another thing we haven't, we as children never forget.
[01:23:26] SPEAKER_01: No, never forgive me.
[01:23:27] SPEAKER_01: So I've remained friendly with these children, but they will never forgive me.
[01:23:30] SPEAKER_01: I think people will know this, you know,
[01:23:32] SPEAKER_00: hopefully in the introduction or whatever the case is.
[01:23:34] SPEAKER_00: But you own 100% of Dyson.
[01:23:38] Yes.
[01:23:39] Is one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world.
[01:23:42] SPEAKER_00: Well, I think it's that.
[01:23:43] SPEAKER_00: But I've heard stories.
[01:23:46] SPEAKER_00: That's fine.
[01:23:46] SPEAKER_00: We don't talk about it.
[01:23:48] SPEAKER_00: And you bought out your 49%
[01:23:52] SPEAKER_00: of 100% for 45,000 pounds.
[01:23:54] SPEAKER_00: So what happens now you're on your own?
[01:23:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, completely on my own.
[01:23:59] SPEAKER_00: And you stayed, I knew you had exactly the right choice.
[01:24:01] SPEAKER_00: The lawsuit had to fight that lawsuit for them, why?
[01:24:04] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:24:05] SPEAKER_01: For five years.
[01:24:06] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:24:07] SPEAKER_01: Boring money, selling actions in the lawsuit.
[01:24:10] SPEAKER_01: Lawyers on contingency, all that kind of thing.
[01:24:12] SPEAKER_01: And it took five years of my life.
[01:24:14] SPEAKER_01: The only income was the drip of license agreements for that part of it.
[01:24:17] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:24:18] SPEAKER_00: But a drip of license agreements kept me just kept me going.
[01:24:22] SPEAKER_01: At one point, you said to hell with it, I'm doing this on my own.
[01:24:25] SPEAKER_00: I meant that licensing, like I'm going to manufacture and control it from soup to nuts.
[01:24:30] SPEAKER_00: Yes. It was at the end of the lawsuit actually.
[01:24:33] SPEAKER_01: That's when I decided I had enough of this licensing game.
[01:24:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to do it myself.
[01:24:38] SPEAKER_01: But you have no money.
[01:24:38] SPEAKER_01: And I'm no money.
[01:24:40] SPEAKER_01: And I'm sick of traveling because I was trying to depend on America all the time.
[01:24:43] SPEAKER_01: I was just sick of it.
[01:24:45] SPEAKER_01: And I got many enjoyce from it, I think, from an airplane.
[01:24:49] SPEAKER_01: So I thought that I'm going to stop and I'm going to have a little cottage industry
[01:24:53] SPEAKER_01: making vacuum cleaners in person.
[01:24:56] That was the way.
[01:24:57] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[01:24:58] But then you have to borrow, I think it was like 600,000 pounds.
[01:25:01] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:25:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[01:25:01] SPEAKER_00: We're tooling for the tooling.
[01:25:04] SPEAKER_01: And you did that, how?
[01:25:05] SPEAKER_00: Well, I went to various venture capitalists.
[01:25:08] SPEAKER_01: There's all the people who ought to learn to start ups.
[01:25:11] SPEAKER_01: And the kind of response I got was, um,
[01:25:13] SPEAKER_01: why, you know, it's not a very interesting area.
[01:25:15] SPEAKER_01: We're investing in restaurants, fast food restaurants at the moment.
[01:25:18] SPEAKER_01: Or we're not lending to you because you're an engineer.
[01:25:22] If you bring someone from the industry to run it,
[01:25:25] SPEAKER_01: then we might consider backing it.
[01:25:26] SPEAKER_01: Those are the sort of responses I was getting from venture capitalists.
[01:25:30] SPEAKER_01: We used to call them.
[01:25:30] SPEAKER_01: But, um, and, uh, so in the end, I went to my local bank, uh, the clearing bank.
[01:25:38] SPEAKER_01: And you're putting up a collateral, my house again.
[01:25:41] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:25:43] Okay.
[01:25:44] SPEAKER_01: I'm getting quite used to this by the way.
[01:25:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:25:46] SPEAKER_01: Deirdery has to keep signing the awful gray forms, uh, signing where the house.
[01:25:51] So, um, yeah, I borrowed that and they let me a huge amount of money actually.
[01:25:56] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it was 1992.
[01:25:58] SPEAKER_01: There was a big housing crisis.
[01:25:59] SPEAKER_01: The banks had lots of proper, you know, return properties.
[01:26:03] SPEAKER_01: Wait, there was a guy.
[01:26:05] SPEAKER_00: It didn't, somebody like inside the bank voucher you?
[01:26:09] SPEAKER_01: The lowest bank ran the system instead of going to a man sitting in a branch of the bank
[01:26:15] and boring from them.
[01:26:16] SPEAKER_01: They had a sort of flying doctor who went around businesses.
[01:26:20] SPEAKER_01: So he was a real business expert and he didn't work from an office.
[01:26:24] SPEAKER_01: He just went around people's businesses.
[01:26:26] SPEAKER_01: They're interesting now, actually.
[01:26:28] SPEAKER_01: And, uh, he, uh, the bank refused his request for the loan.
[01:26:33] SPEAKER_01: So he went to the ombudsman within the bank and persuaded them to lend him the money.
[01:26:38] SPEAKER_01: And it was a crazy thing for them to do, actually, because, uh, you know,
[01:26:44] SPEAKER_01: this guy is setting on business to make that came clean.
[01:26:46] SPEAKER_01: It's to compete with all the big mountain nationals on earth, see doing,
[01:26:50] living in a little coach house and near bath.
[01:26:53] SPEAKER_01: When you think about it, it's completely mad.
[01:26:56] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:26:56] SPEAKER_01: Um, when, um, we were making a profit and everything was okay.
[01:26:59] SPEAKER_01: I said to him, why did you lend it to us?
[01:27:01] SPEAKER_01: And why did you get to go through the hoops to lend me that money,
[01:27:04] SPEAKER_01: which was so sort of a risky thing to do?
[01:27:07] SPEAKER_01: At a time of deep recession when they repossessed, had to repossess so many houses.
[01:27:13] SPEAKER_01: He said, um, oh, well, I went home to my mother, my, my wife and said,
[01:27:18] SPEAKER_01: what do you think of a vacuum cleaner without a bag?
[01:27:20] SPEAKER_01: And she said brilliant exactly what I want.
[01:27:23] SPEAKER_01: And he said, I also saw that you had fought a five year lawsuit in America.
[01:27:28] SPEAKER_01: And I saw that you had determination.
[01:27:31] So I was very lucky.
[01:27:32] SPEAKER_01: I said, it's a real piece of luck.
[01:27:34] SPEAKER_01: Do you think that is the key to, to succeed is a determination more important?
[01:27:41] SPEAKER_00: We talk about focus, but determination is much more important than intelligence.
[01:27:45] Yes.
[01:27:45] Yes.
[01:27:46] SPEAKER_01: Dogginess.
[01:27:47] SPEAKER_00: Never, never giving up.
[01:27:49] SPEAKER_01: Just carrying along and not worrying what other people are saying.
[01:27:52] SPEAKER_01: You know, my friend said, you're completely mad.
[01:27:54] SPEAKER_01: What do you think is spending your will every day in that shed with all that dust around?
[01:27:59] SPEAKER_01: So most people around you were trying to dissuade you from where you're going?
[01:28:02] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[01:28:02] SPEAKER_00: Everybody thought I was mad.
[01:28:05] How did you receive that, like, feedback or that criticism?
[01:28:08] SPEAKER_01: The more I got it, the more encouraged I became, actually.
[01:28:12] SPEAKER_01: Because I don't know.
[01:28:14] SPEAKER_01: I remember when I was trying to, when I was trying to license it,
[01:28:18] SPEAKER_01: I went to all the people who are now my competitors and a lot of others as well.
[01:28:23] SPEAKER_01: And they all turned it down.
[01:28:25] SPEAKER_01: They were quite interested in it, but turned it down.
[01:28:28] And the more it was turned down, the more I realized I had something,
[01:28:33] you believed you were right.
[01:28:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:28:34] SPEAKER_01: You had no doubt.
[01:28:35] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:28:36] SPEAKER_01: Because they never really gave a good reason.
[01:28:40] Well, for the vacuum, the existing manufacturers, there's a great story in the book.
[01:28:45] SPEAKER_00: You know, again, I'm going to quote Charlie Martin.
[01:28:47] SPEAKER_00: He's one of my heroes.
[01:28:48] SPEAKER_00: It's like never, ever think about anything when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.
[01:28:52] SPEAKER_00: He's like, incentives rule human.
[01:28:53] SPEAKER_00: They did you drive so much of human behavior.
[01:28:55] SPEAKER_00: And I'm thinking of Charlie when I'm reading your book.
[01:28:58] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, yeah, you know, it turns out it's really hard to sell.
[01:29:00] SPEAKER_00: I know you don't like this word.
[01:29:01] SPEAKER_00: The bag-less vacuum cleaner.
[01:29:02] SPEAKER_00: You think it should be like the loss of suction.
[01:29:04] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:04] SPEAKER_00: Should vacuum cleaner.
[01:29:05] SPEAKER_00: I'm just going to use the term for the story.
[01:29:08] SPEAKER_00: It's really hard to sell a bag-less vacuum cleaner
[01:29:10] SPEAKER_00: to people make $500 million a year selling vacuum bags.
[01:29:13] SPEAKER_00: Well, it was partly that.
[01:29:15] SPEAKER_01: It was partly that.
[01:29:16] SPEAKER_01: And partly I realized they didn't want to change human history.
[01:29:21] SPEAKER_01: Pretty.
[01:29:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:29:22] SPEAKER_01: And that that's what encouraged me.
[01:29:24] SPEAKER_01: I mean, although each rejection,
[01:29:27] SPEAKER_01: I should have got more and more depressed.
[01:29:28] SPEAKER_01: You had the opposite reaction.
[01:29:31] SPEAKER_01: These guys don't want to change.
[01:29:33] SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to be one of the most important things
[01:29:35] SPEAKER_00: I learned from this conversation.
[01:29:37] SPEAKER_00: Is this idea?
[01:29:38] SPEAKER_00: Assuming that you're doing things for the right reason.
[01:29:40] SPEAKER_00: You're following your curiosity.
[01:29:41] SPEAKER_00: You're completely obsessed with what you're doing.
[01:29:43] This idea of taking essentially what is a negative
[01:29:46] SPEAKER_00: and turning into fuel.
[01:29:47] SPEAKER_00: You're turning into fuel.
[01:29:48] SPEAKER_00: You're trying to dissuade me.
[01:29:50] SPEAKER_00: And it's only making me more dogged.
[01:29:53] SPEAKER_00: I think your dogged determination is a great line, by the way.
[01:29:56] SPEAKER_00: Yes, it's not.
[01:29:56] SPEAKER_00: Well, no, the rejecting it without having a good reason.
[01:30:01] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's what was interesting.
[01:30:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:30:03] SPEAKER_00: You would have listened if they found a design flaw
[01:30:06] SPEAKER_00: or if they told you something there.
[01:30:08] SPEAKER_00: But you know, I am right where everybody else is wrong.
[01:30:10] SPEAKER_00: Difference for the sake of it.
[01:30:11] SPEAKER_00: That is how you build an insanely
[01:30:13] SPEAKER_00: best product in your category.
[01:30:15] SPEAKER_00: You seem to be able to build a best product
[01:30:17] SPEAKER_00: in every category you create.
[01:30:18] SPEAKER_00: But also how you create value,
[01:30:20] SPEAKER_00: like a durable value.
[01:30:21] SPEAKER_00: It's that you're actually doing something differently
[01:30:23] SPEAKER_00: and better than everybody else.
[01:30:25] SPEAKER_00: But that's what I'm trying to do.
[01:30:27] SPEAKER_01: Different and then advanced.
[01:30:29] SPEAKER_01: It would also have a little crazy line in this book,
[01:30:31] SPEAKER_00: which I don't know if you remember.
[01:30:33] SPEAKER_00: But you'd be different even if it was worse.
[01:30:35] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if you still believe that now.
[01:30:36] SPEAKER_00: Oh, yes, yes.
[01:30:38] SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:39] SPEAKER_01: All right, you got to say more about that.
[01:30:40] SPEAKER_01: That is a crazy thing to say.
[01:30:41] SPEAKER_01: Yes, because sometimes the, for example,
[01:30:45] SPEAKER_01: with the vacuum cleaner,
[01:30:47] tipping the dirt out of a bin,
[01:30:49] SPEAKER_01: someone would say, some people say it's worse
[01:30:51] SPEAKER_01: than disposing of a bag.
[01:30:54] Because it creates a bit of dust.
[01:30:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:30:57] SPEAKER_01: So the wrong, I mean, not everything is always perfect
[01:31:01] SPEAKER_01: about something which makes progress.
[01:31:04] SPEAKER_01: And eventually you have a combat problem.
[01:31:06] SPEAKER_01: But so not everything is better.
[01:31:10] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes it's not everything is better.
[01:31:12] SPEAKER_01: But the good overcomes the bad,
[01:31:15] SPEAKER_01: as much better than the bad.
[01:31:16] SPEAKER_01: But the difference is you're essentially
[01:31:18] SPEAKER_00: organizing design principle.
[01:31:19] SPEAKER_00: It has to be different.
[01:31:20] SPEAKER_00: You're not going to make.
[01:31:22] SPEAKER_00: There's no reason for you to go to be better.
[01:31:24] SPEAKER_00: It's going to be better.
[01:31:25] SPEAKER_00: It has to be better.
[01:31:26] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, in my mind, pin your, yes.
[01:31:28] SPEAKER_00: But it has to, you're not going to make like another MeToo product.
[01:31:31] SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, there's, no,
[01:31:34] because I don't want to do that.
[01:31:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm not motivated to do that.
[01:31:38] SPEAKER_01: And I built a team around me who are motivated to take risks
[01:31:42] SPEAKER_01: and do something different and better.
[01:31:44] Always.
[01:31:46] So let's go back to you by the tooling.
[01:31:48] SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to like redo the entire book.
[01:31:50] SPEAKER_00: We'll skip over the issue that you're having to move the tooling
[01:31:53] SPEAKER_00: and you're having issues.
[01:31:54] SPEAKER_00: But then eventually you have this great line in the book.
[01:31:58] SPEAKER_00: You end one of this chapter.
[01:32:00] SPEAKER_00: These are like my favorite,
[01:32:01] SPEAKER_00: so my favorite three paragraph is the entire book.
[01:32:02] SPEAKER_00: And it's on total control.
[01:32:05] SPEAKER_00: And you say from the first sprouting of the idea,
[01:32:07] SPEAKER_00: the research and development, testing and prototyping,
[01:32:09] SPEAKER_00: model making and engineering drawings,
[01:32:11] SPEAKER_00: tooling, production, sales and marketing,
[01:32:13] SPEAKER_00: all the way into the homes of the nation.
[01:32:15] SPEAKER_00: It is most likely to succeed if the original visionary,
[01:32:19] SPEAKER_00: and you've been to parentheses, are mule,
[01:32:20] SPEAKER_00: because you're only celebrating your stubbornness,
[01:32:23] SPEAKER_00: seize it right through.
[01:32:24] SPEAKER_00: As I often have said,
[01:32:25] SPEAKER_00: I aim not to be clever, but to be dogged.
[01:32:28] SPEAKER_00: And my doggedness had gotten me so far to a point
[01:32:31] SPEAKER_00: where I had my very own psychonic vacuum cleaner at last.
[01:32:34] SPEAKER_00: On May 2, 1992,
[01:32:37] SPEAKER_00: I found myself looking at the first fully operational,
[01:32:40] SPEAKER_00: visually perfect,
[01:32:41] SPEAKER_00: jadecint dual cyclone.
[01:32:44] SPEAKER_00: I was 31 years old when I tore the bag off my Hoover
[01:32:48] SPEAKER_00: and stuck a cereal packet in the hole.
[01:32:50] SPEAKER_00: May 2, 1992 was my 45th birthday.
[01:32:56] Still heavily in debt.
[01:33:00] Do you remember that day?
[01:33:01] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, no, I do.
[01:33:02] SPEAKER_01: Yes, I do.
[01:33:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I remember quite a lot of my birthdays,
[01:33:06] SPEAKER_01: but yes, that was really important,
[01:33:08] SPEAKER_01: because to get to that point,
[01:33:12] SPEAKER_01: it had taken me 11 years,
[01:33:14] SPEAKER_01: I think, 11 years, something like that.
[01:33:17] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of money.
[01:33:19] SPEAKER_01: And I was hugely in debt.
[01:33:22] SPEAKER_01: But I had the first prototype that worked.
[01:33:25] SPEAKER_00: Outside of your family,
[01:33:27] SPEAKER_00: is that period your most proud of?
[01:33:33] No, no, no, it's all that carries on.
[01:33:37] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't stop.
[01:33:38] SPEAKER_01: So I don't ever stop and think,
[01:33:41] SPEAKER_01: now I'm going to be proud.
[01:33:44] SPEAKER_01: If I don't really like pride,
[01:33:47] why?
[01:33:47] It's self-serving.
[01:33:50] SPEAKER_01: It's never good enough,
[01:33:51] SPEAKER_01: so you can't be proud.
[01:33:54] Explain more.
[01:33:55] Well, I'm never satisfied.
[01:33:56] SPEAKER_01: I mean, there's always something wrong.
[01:33:59] SPEAKER_01: I've got to go on improving it.
[01:34:01] SPEAKER_01: You talk about this in this book,
[01:34:02] SPEAKER_00: that the engineering mindset,
[01:34:03] SPEAKER_00: if you're reading this,
[01:34:04] SPEAKER_00: I think you can say it,
[01:34:04] SPEAKER_00: if you're reading this,
[01:34:05] SPEAKER_00: you have this mindset,
[01:34:06] SPEAKER_00: you know, it never turns off.
[01:34:07] SPEAKER_00: You're never satisfied.
[01:34:08] SPEAKER_00: You can't just go home and be like,
[01:34:10] SPEAKER_00: oh, everything's,
[01:34:10] SPEAKER_00: this is great.
[01:34:11] SPEAKER_00: You just see the imperfections.
[01:34:13] SPEAKER_00: Is it really focusing on imperfections
[01:34:15] SPEAKER_00: or just focusing on the missing improvement?
[01:34:18] SPEAKER_00: It's just knowing that things could be better.
[01:34:22] SPEAKER_01: There's a better way of doing it
[01:34:25] SPEAKER_01: that I haven't done it well enough
[01:34:26] SPEAKER_01: that I've got to make it better.
[01:34:29] SPEAKER_01: I'm done just driven like that.
[01:34:31] SPEAKER_01: So I'm never satisfied.
[01:34:33] SPEAKER_01: And I think satisfaction is a pretty dangerous thing anyway.
[01:34:36] SPEAKER_01: Same way.
[01:34:37] SPEAKER_01: Well, because there's a kind of smugness, too,
[01:34:40] SPEAKER_01: that I'm perfect,
[01:34:42] SPEAKER_01: and I don't need to do any better than this.
[01:34:45] I can relax.
[01:34:47] SPEAKER_01: And I just don't think like that.
[01:34:50] SPEAKER_01: I'm always wanting to do something better.
[01:34:53] SPEAKER_01: My wife hates it because when we're exploring the car
[01:34:56] SPEAKER_01: or something, I always think there's something better
[01:34:57] SPEAKER_01: around the corner.
[01:34:58] SPEAKER_01: And she wants to stop and enjoy where we are at the moment.
[01:35:01] SPEAKER_01: So I mean, I do a commentator on that.
[01:35:03] SPEAKER_01: But I mean, that's how I think and feel.
[01:35:07] SPEAKER_01: Which does that lead to,
[01:35:09] SPEAKER_00: but you seem to be very like happy and like,
[01:35:12] SPEAKER_00: not content, but you seem to be like a happy person
[01:35:15] SPEAKER_00: where this is not like a torturous inner monologue
[01:35:18] SPEAKER_00: where all you see is like you're never satisfied
[01:35:20] SPEAKER_00: and you see the things that could be fixed.
[01:35:22] SPEAKER_00: It is slightly torturous.
[01:35:23] SPEAKER_00: But it's what I do.
[01:35:26] SPEAKER_01: I feel the same way.
[01:35:27] SPEAKER_01: It's like it also leads you to periods of like very dark unhappiness.
[01:35:34] SPEAKER_00: How do you not let it...
[01:35:36] Well, I suppose I'm lucky because I don't think it makes me that unhappy.
[01:35:40] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I have moments of unhappiness.
[01:35:42] SPEAKER_01: But give me an example of a moment of unhappiness.
[01:35:45] SPEAKER_01: Well, you know,
[01:35:46] SPEAKER_01: with law suit case wrong or something
[01:35:49] SPEAKER_01: or an experiment doesn't work and I hope it would.
[01:35:51] SPEAKER_01: They are sort of things.
[01:35:52] SPEAKER_01: But I bounce back from them very quickly.
[01:35:55] SPEAKER_01: They're just minor.
[01:35:56] SPEAKER_01: No. Is that more of like you got better with the wisdom of age and experience?
[01:36:00] SPEAKER_00: No, I've always been like that.
[01:36:02] SPEAKER_00: So you've basically been the same person.
[01:36:04] SPEAKER_00: And you just never stop.
[01:36:05] SPEAKER_00: Never stop.
[01:36:06] SPEAKER_00: Yes, yeah.
[01:36:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'd say that's true.
[01:36:09] SPEAKER_01: And I think my father's death has quite a lot to do with that.
[01:36:14] SPEAKER_01: Coming back to that.
[01:36:16] SPEAKER_01: And I was in the sort of a group.
[01:36:20] SPEAKER_01: Because we lived in a school, in a public school.
[01:36:23] SPEAKER_01: In a private school.
[01:36:24] SPEAKER_01: It was probably better expression.
[01:36:27] SPEAKER_01: And the other teachers' children
[01:36:30] SPEAKER_01: were the same sort of age.
[01:36:31] SPEAKER_01: So we were a group.
[01:36:33] SPEAKER_01: And we had the run of the school grounds during the holidays.
[01:36:36] SPEAKER_01: But I was the youngest.
[01:36:37] SPEAKER_01: So the others were up to five years older than me.
[01:36:40] SPEAKER_01: So I was always dealing with people who were bigger and stronger than me.
[01:36:43] SPEAKER_01: Or cleverer than me.
[01:36:45] And so I think it made me always strive.
[01:36:49] So I think a combination of being the youngest,
[01:36:52] SPEAKER_01: because I was the youngest of three children anyway.
[01:36:55] SPEAKER_01: And younger than this group that I went around with
[01:36:59] SPEAKER_01: made me try to punch above my weight a bit and made me very determined.
[01:37:02] SPEAKER_01: Because in order to succeed at anything,
[01:37:04] SPEAKER_01: I had to be really, really good in order to beat them at tennis or whatever it was or an erase.
[01:37:09] SPEAKER_01: I had to be punching above my weight.
[01:37:13] SPEAKER_01: So I think that at and losing my father.
[01:37:17] SPEAKER_01: So losing, realizing I was on my own.
[01:37:22] SPEAKER_01: And I was aware of boarding school on my own.
[01:37:25] SPEAKER_01: So that whole combination made me the sort of character I am.
[01:37:32] Made me never satisfied, always wanting to find something better.
[01:37:37] SPEAKER_01: And bouncing back from failures.
[01:37:39] SPEAKER_01: That's the perfect spot to end this conversation.
[01:37:42] SPEAKER_00: James, they say never meet your heroes.
[01:37:44] SPEAKER_00: They're 100% wrong.
[01:37:45] SPEAKER_00: I don't feel ashamed at all.
[01:37:48] SPEAKER_00: You're one of my heroes.
[01:37:49] SPEAKER_00: This conversation has been excellent.
[01:37:50] SPEAKER_00: Out of all the people that have studied and met,
[01:37:52] SPEAKER_00: you're definitely the person I try to emulate the most.
[01:37:54] SPEAKER_00: I really appreciate you taking time.
[01:37:56] SPEAKER_00: Well, thank you, David.
[01:37:57] SPEAKER_01: That's great to hear.
[01:37:57] SPEAKER_01: You'll story as well.
[01:37:58] SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
