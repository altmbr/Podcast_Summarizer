[00:00:00] Alright everyone, on this podcast we talk a lot about the successes, but I want to talk about the failures
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_01: So here's about 10 different companies that I started before I made my first million almost all of them
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_01: They sucked it didn't work, but I'm gonna explain how much I made it for each idea and the lesson that I learned
[00:00:19] Alright, what's up Sam? What's going on? Let's set this up name of this podcast my first one
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_00: When did you make your first million? So cash like cash million
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_01: I made it when my wife worked at Airbnb and it went public and that's when we made our first and then about
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: Three months later. I think it went later in December my company sold in February and then we made a lot leading up to that
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: We were doing pretty good too, but I don't think we had crossed one million
[00:00:43] Okay, so you made your first million. Let's call it 31 years old
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: Here's all the businesses you tried
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_00: Before that before making your first million, which I think is pretty fascinating
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_00: I want to go down this list. It does it start in high school. Yeah, all right go for it
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: Give me number one and high school I made $2,500 one summer by buying graduating seniors old sports equipment and selling it on eBay
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_01: And so what I used to do is I would just buy like people's like track spikes or
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_01: You know, whatever and I would sell it on eBay and most of the time that I didn't buy it
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_01: They would just give it to me if they were handed to me and my on eBay I made $2,500
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_01: So my first business where I actually started making online money and this is flipping basically this is flipping assets that other people
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_00: Not only under value they might even to the not value to the point where they're just happy you took it off their hands
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and frankly, I did this in college too, which I didn't list here is when at the end of the college year
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: I would I would stay a few weeks after the end of the school year and when people were moving out
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_01: I said I have a storage unit you'd come and put it here and just give it to me
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: You're gonna throw it away just give it to me and then I would resell it
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: Exactly
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: I saw people doing this in college with textbooks. They would just say oh at the end of the year
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: You don't want to take all these heavy textbooks home. You're done with that class
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: Well, guess what the next semester there's a bunch of people that are gonna need that exact textbook
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_00: They were happy to buy it used and so they would just go buy up people's tag
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_00: They would just take people's textbooks and they each book was like, you know a 40 or $50
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: You know future sale that they were able to pick up for free
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_00: Okay, and then at 20 I started a hot dog stand which everyone makes fun of me for talking about you
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: I have a hot dog stand you have a sushi restaurant. There's sick of us talking about it
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_01: But I had one called Southern Sam so we nurse as big as a baby's arm basically
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: I knew a guy named doc who had a hot dog stand
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_01: He let me rent it from him with very little money up front
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_01: I had I was able to pay him on the 30th as opposed to the first of the month
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: So he hooked me up and with $500. I went to restaurant depot and I bought a bunch of Vienna sausages to get my supply
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_01: And I was in business baby within a week of having this idea and I used to live at a bad neighborhood
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_01: Raidel was my next door neighbor and he became my best friend
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_01: He had served 20 years in prison for attempted murder and somehow we became best friends
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_01: He had the spare key to my house. This was my guy and
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_01: Raidel ended up working with me at Southern Sam's and we
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: Spent all day outside and it was a pain in the butt some days
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: I would make 50 bucks other days I would go to a concert or like an outdoor place that was popping and I would make a
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_01: Thousand dollars and I did that when I was about 20 or 21 this is you summer in college or what were you doing?
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: I was in college. I was in class and so I would work until 3 p.m
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_01: I would go to classes from 3 p.m. into 8 p.m. And then I had a night session where I was out by all the bars
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: And that would be like a 9 p.m. to like 1 a.m
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_01: That's amazing. How did you have the idea to do the hot dog stand? You just saw somebody else doing it?
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_01: I met a guy who had a cart and I wanted to do something. Yeah
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_00: Did he tell you like I'm making 300 bucks a night or something?
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_00: What would it be? I saw a video online of a guy's like how much money the home depot hot dog guys make they make
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_01: $100,000 a year the ad said
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: And you were like in I was a man. I was I was broke I had my PhD poor hard work in and driven

[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: Man, this is what inspired me to get in the copywriting
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_01: I realized that you had to like wheel and deal a little bit
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: You had a schmooz you had a flirt you had to do this and then I realized
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_01: What if I could do this on the internet where I could write something one time and have an infinite amount of people come and read it
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_01: And I didn't have to sell constantly didn't have to stand there in the heat and didn't have to stand in the heat

[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: Charming person you could be at all times like practice this muscle and
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_00: And I actually think this is a hundred percent true. I know a couple of people in my life that are like this
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_00: I'm not really like that, but I've been starting to do it just for fun
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_00: Just that's a little mini game. You know when you're just
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: Living a pretty routine life. You're just going to the grocery store
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: It's either gonna be a forgettable experience or you try something to make it a little more fun
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: I've been doing this and it's kind of amazing
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: You know what I call it you know, I'll be able to say nonchalant

[00:05:01] SPEAKER_01: It's shalant as hell. Yeah, be shalant try hard
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_00: I emailed my wealth manager at Morgan Stanley and I was like hey
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_00: I made this trade and it like there's like a commission of like a hundred something bucks at the end of like the trade I was like
[00:05:17] Is there like a magic button you got over there man?
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_00: Like you got this magic button you could push that makes all those fees go away and that was what I sent you know
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: The private wealth manager and he goes he just replied magic button pushed trades commissions reversed enjoy your trading
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_00: And I was like just flirt with everybody like I could have been an annoying Karen

[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: Just flirt a little bit and everybody likes to be flirted with so my next business after that
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_01: I started this thing basically in Tennessee at the time
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_01: White whiskey which it's called moonshine moonshine technically means illegal whiskey
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_01: But there is these companies making whiskey that was in a mason jar and it they called it moonshine and I started selling that online
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_01: And I thought I was doing it the right way because I kind of like Google it and I talked to like a lawyer where I was like selling it as a novelty
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_01: Because it was kind of like a gift item. I
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_01: Did that for about two or three months and then I went to my universities
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_01: Like entrepreneurship program where they had free legal advice and I was like hey
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_01: I've made ten grand and like the last like you know
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_01: 30 days or something selling this whiskey online
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_01: I think I'm following the right rules
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_01: But is there anything else I need to be doing and they're like yeah brother you got a you better shut that down tonight
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_01: And so that was like my second internet business which
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_01: Inspired me to get into the game of the internet and my lesson learned on that one was if you're gonna do something
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_01: Like this you better really do it right and you better pick something that aligns with your values around this time
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: I was still drinking and I didn't even like alcohol
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_01: I mean, you know
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: I had a love hate relationship and I was like why am I gonna start selling this?
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to do this is stupid anyway, but you're gonna see there's a pattern
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_01: It was definitely like a quick money
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_01: Which I think everyone who becomes a good entrepreneur they do the gray hat gray hat area phase and this was my gray hat phase
[00:07:04] Okay, I like it you started it online. Did you learn about online marketing through this like were you
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_00: I mean how'd you how'd you get the 10k where'd you where'd you get your customers from I posted on forums like motorcycle forums
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: Like so basically like this a whiskey that I was selling people were already searching for it because the guy you drive of course
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_01: Should have been the name that people were already searching for this whiskey, but it was very early
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_01: And so I was able to rank super easily on Google and I post it on message boards forums of people who wanting who people who wanted it
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_01: And that's how I made money nice
[00:07:40] All right, so a lot of people watch it listen to this show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: What it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: They have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_01: All right, I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_01: What they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_01: Here and look so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_01: Appropriately called it the side hustle idea database. It's a list of a hundred pretty good ideas frankly
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_01: I went through them. They're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_01: Inspiration so check it out. It's called the side hustle idea database. It's in the description below
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_01: You'll see the link click it check it out. Let me know the comments. What you think?
[00:08:32] Okay, so now you move to San Francisco. I think you you don't you just do like a cross-country motorcycle ride to get to San Francisco as well
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: I do it at a later date
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: But this time I flew out there because I had a job offer at Airbnb
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_01: Which got rescinded when I got there because I'd lied on my resume about getting a DUI and so I was out there
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_01: I'm like what the hell am I gonna do? I got to meet people and so I started thing called the anti-MBA book club and
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_01: I tried monetizing it
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_01: But I couldn't really at first and so what I did was I posted ads on Craigslist and on
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_01: Reddit and I think I posted on Facebook and I got
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_01: 2,000 people to sign up but he was the premise
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_01: It was called the anti-MBA because I was very envious of Stanford students and Berkeley students
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_01: I was very envious that they had this network and said
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna read it one book per month. We're gonna break it up into a quarter
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_01: So a week a week a week a week and I'm gonna find an expert on that books topic and we're gonna come and discuss it with that expert
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: I'll organize and get the expert you come it's free and I got 2,100 people to sign up to my emailing list
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_01: And I had about 20 people show up every single week some of those people include Cieva who's now one of my best friends
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: It's one of your close buddies Neville, Madora who's now who is the best man my wedding came from that and so it's my best friends
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_01: Came to the anti-MBA book club and if and I posted a photo if you zoom in on the top left of the photo
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_01: You're gonna see a ski ball machine. I found an arcade that let me host the book clubs for free in that place as long as we play ski ball and
[00:09:59] You were reading books now. What kind of books were you reading in this is this like?
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: Were the books actually useful for you in business or was selling white whiskey the right way to learn business?
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_00: I don't remember everything we read
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_01: But it was like it was like Tim Ferriss's book the four hour work week
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_01: So you know how like you want to like if I was a techie I would have built like clubhouse
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_01: There's something actually cool, but I didn't have like anyone discuss these books that I wanted to read
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_01: But it was kind of a forcing function because I was like like I need to get good at business
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_01: I better like get educated
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_01: What I could do is I can get these people to come to this book club
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: And I'll just read one week in advance and I take really good notes and I'll sort of teach it because when you do a book club
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: By the way, no one reads a book just the one guy who was organizing it and so I was just going to organize it
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_01: Organize and talk about it. Okay. What came next? Okay, and then around that same time when I moved to
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_01: San Francisco I met a guy who had an idea for a roommate matching app and I was like hey
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_01: I don't have anything to do may I please join you and so I previously had a pickup truck in
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_01: Nashville where I live I sold it I had roughly five thousand dollars here a little bit of money
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_01: We put it together and we started with this idea called a
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_01: Bunk and the idea with bunk was it was a roommate matching party website and so we went to landlords who had two three four five bedrooms
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_01: And we would say we're gonna post an ad on Craigslist and we're gonna advertise this three bedroom as a one bedroom
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_01: Department meaning instead of a three thousand dollars three bedroom
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_01: We're gonna advertise it as a one thousand dollar one bedroom and we're gonna get a hundred people who are interested
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_01: And we're gonna host parties to help them team up and move into this apartment and potentially other apartments
[00:11:26] Sounded interesting and it was somewhat interesting couldn't figure out how to monetize it
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_01: roommate matching apps are one of like four businesses that every just
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: Graduated college kid tries to start. That's one of them. It doesn't really work
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_01: So we got aqua hired roughly nine months later, which basically meant we got a job and we got some bonus money
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_01: If we like accomplish a couple things, but what we did do that was interesting and I was not able to do this
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_01: I was definitely like the marketing guy
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_01: But we turned that idea into Tinder for roommates and that was really dumb because most people when we launched when we got
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: We actually got tens of thousands of people to sign up for via these infographics that I linked to that we made
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_01: But most people are many people who were using it. We're just meeting it to date. We should have just done Tinder for Dittinger
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_01: It would have been way smarter
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_01: And so that didn't really work out
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I
[00:12:12] Think that to win in business you got to have essentially three components
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_00: The first component is you need to have a money-making skill meaning you have to have something that drives value
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_00: This is either going to be learning the cell learning to make things
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_00: Learning to hunt down interesting deals, right?
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_00: You need a money-making skill. What was your money-making skill you were developing during all these across all these different little projects?
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_00: Copywriting and also just like tenacity but like getting after it
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_01: But copywriting was the the one and marketing marketing right learning to sell
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_01: In your case learning through sell learning to sell through getting website traffic and getting the web visitor to do what I wanted them to do
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_01: Cool
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_01: The second thing is you got to learn to be sort of tenacious and scrappy
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_00: Which comes not as a thing you want to do but as a thing you are forced to do because you really have no other choice
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: But once you find that gear you now know you have it
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_00: That's how I would describe it is that accurate. It sounds like it's what happened in your case too
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: Nobody wants to be scrappy to be clear
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_00: Right like feel the option to not have to tough it out you probably have taken that
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_00: But when you're forced to do it you learn okay
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_00: I have this sort of animal inside I can do this and now I'm going to use this and everything
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_00: I'll think I do whereas somebody who doesn't know if they can do that
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_00: There has it to go for yeah, and what's funny about that tenacity or sorry being scrappy is
[00:13:33] There's this chart where basically like you you start that way and you don't like it and then you like kind of get something a little bit of fancy
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_01: But then once you already are fancy or successful you realize you should always be scrappy
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: You know what I mean? There's like a reason it like Amazon has like the pizza roll where it's like you don't have a team of people that are like four people
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_01: Because small scrappy teams do significantly better in many cases than bigger teams and so yeah
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: When we when we met the tactically hilarious if you had just taken a picture of both of our offices and you had said
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_00: Which of these two guys is the successful entrepreneur
[00:14:04] My office was like a museum
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_01: You had a dude if you walked up to Sean's office
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_01: I'm not exaggerating you and San Francisco we lived by you a somebody in the redwood trees
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_01: They're huge you could drive it you could cut a hole in it and drive a car through it
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_01: Sean's office as it says if they made a like a coffee coaster for your cup
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_01: Out of a redwood tree and it was the size of like 18 feet long
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_01: It was like a 18 foot in diameter circle that was like a probably a half a million dollar table
[00:14:30] Yeah, it was we had four stories we had an entire apartment built in with heated bathroom floors
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_00: So if you needed to stay the night you could sleep there every every wall was made of one way one way mirrors
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_00: So you could like see out but to couldn't see in type of chef
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_00: We had a chef there every single day. We had a masseuse on Fridays. We had open bar
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_00: So every Friday we had so all these things it's a full it's a 30,000 square foot office
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_00: decorated by Ken folk one of the fanciest designers in the world and
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_00: That was my office. I remember Sam came over one time and he picked up the aftrey which nobody smokes inside
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_00: I don't know why we have an aftrey
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_00: It's like illegal to do that and he picked up the aftrey flipped it over and he goes
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: This is a $700 aftrey because the sticker was still on it
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: And I was like I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what I don't know what I'm doing here and I stole it
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_01: It's like the Titanic got built and then they just plucked like a 23 year old idiot and they're like you drive
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_00: And I was just driving that that company into the ground and you had this
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_00: Like half an office it was like like somebody's apartment. It was an apartment that was $700. Me and see I've shared it
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like like the bathroom didn't have a door like you just had to be like hey I'm taking a shit
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_00: You know like it was like it was like the craziest scenario see even was just sitting over there
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_00: He just didn't even a part of your company just like another guy was just there and
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_00: Like the the fall like there was everything was so strange like nothing made any sense
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: You like didn't have Wi-Fi and you're building this internet company and yeah
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_00: You're the one who's building something successful and at that period of our lives like you were actually onto something
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_00: And I was sitting here just like you know
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_00: Making things that nobody wanted and so you know your scrappiness was well deserved at that time and and earned you
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_00: Some good things. I had to go through my scrappie period at a different time. So
[00:16:13] The third thing I would say so one was the tenacious side developing that scrappy mentality and being willing to be at the bottom
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_00: And like survive at the bottom two is the money making skill and three is project selection
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_00: So starting to figure out like almost their process of elimination
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: What are all the bad businesses that you should not be in I was in the elimination phase for sure
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you eliminated like hey, I probably don't want one where I'm standing outside in the heat selling hot dogs
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: Because I'm gonna be capped at like how long I can stand outside in the heat. That's probably not a good idea
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: Right, so manual labor is not scalable
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_00: You know another one that you did was like illegal business like oh great a lot of people want this moonshine
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: But like it's only gonna go the bigger it gets the more like I am to go to prison fail and go to prison
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: So that's probably not a good project to select
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_00: So you are going through process of elimination on project selection
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: And so you go through this roommate matching app you're making apps now that's already better
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_00: If I say like what's the sam par criteria now after that after doing all ten of these things
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_00: What is a good project to be in for you?
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_00: I believe in eke guy which is like what's the world want what's the world want to pay for what am I good at and what I'm passionate at and I try to find that in the middle
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: But I my goal and then okay, so that's like the woo woo stuff that I totally believe in
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_01: But then the other side is can I get something can I bootstrap it to a hundred million revenue in ten years
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_01: Okay, but can I bootstrap it so there has to be some something you're answering underneath that
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: That's like saying you know what my strategy and chess is checkmate
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_00: Right like okay, yeah, I get it, but how do you get there exactly?
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_00: So what do you look for that's gonna be a thing you can bootstrap?
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_00: So are you looking for I can see that somebody has done a similar thing in another space that I can
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_00: Recreate or apply over here seem like though the hustle was very much that way yeah
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_00: The newsletter right you looked at the scam you looked at a couple others
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: You were like oh I get what they're doing and I could do that just in my way
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so I like to I call it like a forgotten business
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_01: So there's a lot of these businesses that I haven't even talked about on MFM
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_01: But basically like there's a bunch of businesses like Hampton that are doing hundreds and hundreds of millions a dollars a year in profit
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_01: And what I tend to do when I look for Hampton's by only company
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_01: That's what I'm going to be doing for a very long time
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_01: But before I started it I research and I go and talk to the owners and I do diligence and I thought of it this way
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_01: But then when AI started coming and play it really solidify it
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_01: Which is like something that can't be disrupted easily
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_01: I also like looking at things that serious operators don't take serious because I think that um
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: There's less competition
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_01: So like with the hustle people laughed at me when we started it
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_01: But I was like well if you do the math it definitely can get to a hundred million revenue
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_01: And I sold it for a got there but Austin Reef who founded Morning Brew
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_01: He only sold part of the business and still kept running it and they're in the 80 or 90 million
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_01: Revenue I think range now so like the math was right and so I look for things that
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_01: Uh can be real opportunities, but the ballers aren't taking it serious
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, what Charlie Munger says the secret to success is weak competition
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: So if I was to say from afar I've known you for I don't know how long have I known you?
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_00: 12 years maybe yeah long time
[00:19:10] um
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_00: Three Obama's and what I would say is I've noticed that what one thing you do really well
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: Is you're very good at sniffing out
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_00: Interesting things in spaces where other people are not not even looking
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: Which is you mostly just following your curiosity and taste
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: Uh, but you go and you do a lot of research you do you come across nonchalant
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: But you're pretty fucking shalant about the research very long
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_00: You go really detailed you go meet them you like talk to the bankers
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_00: You talk to a lot of people in a space to get a real like a real idea of like what those companies look like
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_00: And because I want to eliminate the uncertain like okay, so entrepreneurship
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_01: I've been thinking about this the reason I I think entrepreneurship is almost philosophical to me and allowed people
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_01: It's because entrepreneurship is sort of like how much uncertainty and fear can you take and still continue moving forward
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_01: Because entrepreneurship is basically like you work on the same thing for six 12 18 sometimes 24 months
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_01: And you're like I'd still see barely any progress is this going to work and
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_01: The price that you're paying for potentially a big outcome or potentially for building a business or potentially being free
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_01: It could take five or ten years and the ones who win are the ones who can handle that uncertainty for a long period of time
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_01: That is what entrepreneurship is ultimately in my opinion
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_01: It's dealing with uncertainty and dealing with fear you have fear over
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_01: Hiring someone when you only have $30,000 in your bank account
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_01: You have I remember when my first employee had a kid and I was like I feel like I had a kid
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_01: I felt so much fear now it just really has to sustain itself you have fear over finding your first customer
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_01: And thinking I am promising one thing now
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_01: I really have to work my butt off to like make it work out for them
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_01: You have fear over getting hate and people making fun of them
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_01: And so the name of the game of entrepreneurship is just can you handle the fear and can you handle what's worse is the uncertainty over
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_01: Potentially five or ten years
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_00: beautifully said monech perri had a good
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_00: addition to this which he said
[00:20:58] Understand the difference between risk and uncertainty so he was talking about it with the stock market
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_00: He goes basically the stock market stock market investors hate uncertainty
[00:21:08] Like if they don't know whether your earnings are going to be good or bad
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: They will just sort of assume bad right like you guys to get a huge discount for uncertainty
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: But it's not the same thing as actual risk
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: And you know risk is like you know what you have to lose uncertainty is just not knowing what's going to happen
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_00: And so people think that entrepreneurs take a lot of risk
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: But I actually think you are a good example of what most entrepreneurs really do which is their actual risk minimizers
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_00: It's like how do I win while taking the least amount of risk necessary to win
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_00: I'm not trying to take risks. I'm not trying to take unnecessary. I'm trying to vaporize risk everywhere I can
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_00: And whatever's left over fine. I'm willing to live with what's left over and he tells the story of Richard Branson
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_00: So he says
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_00: Branson is seen as this like
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_00: freewheeling
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_00: Gunslinger Mr. Risk type of guy partly because of his look his brand etc
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_00: It goes when Branson started his airline which is a very what people would think is a very risky business to be in most airlines fail
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_00: Even today most airlines don't even make any money. The even the airlines that it that exists very razor thin margins
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_00: And when he started virgin
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_00: He called up. I think it was British airways and he was trying to get one plane
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_00: So he was like hey, do you have like whatever a 747 and they were they were telling him no
[00:22:24] We don't just give out. We're not gonna sell you random guy on the phone like he called the customer sport
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_00: We don't sell you a 747. He said can you just connect me to the person who does sell 747?
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: They're like we don't sell 747 is like all right. Do you guys have extra capacity of 747?
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_00: So you're not currently in in use in your fleet. They're like yeah, we do
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_00: He goes okay. Well, would you lease one to me?
[00:22:44] And basically he started virgin by leasing the plane not buying the plane which reduced risk
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_00: He released it and he was only on the hook for the payments like
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_00: a 60 or 90 days later
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_00: But he was already gonna pre-sell the tickets for the flights like the airline business works where you sell the tickets before you end up paying for the
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_00: For the plane and the fuel and all the actual cost of operating it
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_00: And so he realized like actually well, what's the worst case that happens? I just give them the plane back
[00:23:10] Like that's all I'm on the hook to do is give them the plane back if I can't follow through on my commitment
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_00: But if I can get it to work, I'll know ahead of time because I sell the tickets upfront. So it's actually a
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_00: Very like risk reduction approach to doing what other people see is taking massive risk
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_00: And I would say you're the same way where when I've seen you go into a business
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_00: You're looking to reduce risk everywhere possible. So you're like do it does another business like this already exist and work
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_00: So I know that there's demand and I know the business model works
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_00: Can I apply it into this space where there's not a lot of competition or there's weak competition
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_00: There's not a lot of other really smart super geniuses running around San Francisco trying to do what I'm doing
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_00: Cool, that's a way of reducing risk a third way of reducing risk is you try to bootstrap it
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_00: You don't take on external investment
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: You try to do it where I can start this with pretty much no money. So what do I have to lose just my time
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_00: I'm not actually going to be in the hole if I if this goes wrong
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: That's another way that you reduce risk and the fourth one is can I use basically my copyrighting skills to attract demand before I have to fulfill the service
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_00: I would sell sponsorships before yeah, I sold sponsorships. I went out a bit. Yes. I would I would pre-sell as much as possible
[00:24:14] Right, and so you know and you would do a bunch of research to reduce risk you would talk to the bankers to figure out
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_00: You know what works in these businesses?
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_00: You talk to the ex CEOs the ex employees to understand what works what doesn't work in this business
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_00: And so I think you're a master risk reducer
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_00: And so when somebody sees the business that you do they all sound kind of random
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_00: But I would say like where you've come to I think at the end is
[00:24:33] You've figured out your money making skill you figured out how to be tenacious and scrappy and then lastly
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_00: You've gotten better at project selection
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_00: And and ultimately we'll we'll use sort of risk reduction method to pick a project that you think is like kind of a
[00:24:48] I wouldn't say slam dunk, but like you're not
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_00: Hoping for this sort of one and one and a hundred outcome
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_00: It's kind of like I have to fumble execution for this to fail
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and you should hold your breath still on saying I had good project selection because in 2015
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_01: I started a business called it's juice a poison ivy treatment
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_01: scratch your own it just they say so stupid
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_01: So there was this like type of lotion that mechanics used
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_01: It was like a called a green scrub. I forget exactly what it was called
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_01: But it turns out it was also had the same ingredients as poison ivy treatment
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_01: And I bought in bulk like
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: Like a like a barrel that you would have at a mechanic shop and it was like
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_01: 20 cents an ounce
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_01: But that as poison ivy treatment it sold for like $20 an ounce
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_01: And I realized I could rank high on Google and so I was I got into poison ivy treatment business
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_01: And I learned the same thing there or that I learned in the alcohol business
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: Which was and this this did this was starting to make money
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_01: Which is like do these short little get rich quick schemes that you jump into without like doing the eke guy
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_01: Preparation of like what am I actually passionate about they're stupid. So I learned that one
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: I feel like I was a lawyer who just stood up and told the jury my client is innocent
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_00: And then at the very end you were like I did it by the way
[00:26:03] Yeah, it's like oh, I told you just don't say anything
[00:26:08] Now I think I did good at selecting new things. So I got rid of that and then I started working 10 years
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_01: I think that I have the same story where it took 10 years for me to even figure out what a good business is
[00:26:20] Dude, I don't know how like I read about these prodigies
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_01: Who do like are so mature when they're like
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_01: 26 27 and I just I'm like am I
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_01: Was I just like slow to develop like when I see some of these smart 26 27 year olds? I'd think to myself
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_01: I still don't behave that way and I'm 10 years older than that. So I don't like when I was 26 and 27 like
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_01: I didn't know anything. I knew nothing and I actually thought this way about you and I was like
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: He's right stuff on a whiteboard and he's got these like frameworks way of thinking. I don't think it frameworks
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_01: I just like do yeah while I was sitting there being like why am I just on a whiteboard this guy's out there just doing it
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_00: I got to do with this guy's doing it took it took me 10 years to even figure out at all what the hell is going on
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: 10 years and 10 years you could say that look I said that in 10 seconds
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_00: It took me 10 years watch that was so quick
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_00: Winner in it 10 years is like an eternity especially because you don't even know that if I knew by the way
[00:27:13] It'll take me 10 years, but I'll figure it out. It would have felt so much better
[00:27:17] At the time it's like the tunnel is still dark and I don't even know where if and when the tunnel ends
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know how much like time I've got left to get there
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_00: So it feels much worse in the moment. So if anybody is out there who's in there kind of 10 year
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: 10 year doing dumb stuff arc, you know, I feel you
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_00: It's it's normal. It still works. Just keep going. So Lewis and Clark
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_01: It's like one of my favorite stories ever
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_01: But they basically they were sent out starting in St. Louis Thomas Jefferson was like hey Lewis
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_01: Hey Clark do me a favor
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_01: Just walk in that direction and tell me does it end and what's it look like and what's on the end and they just go
[00:27:49] SPEAKER_01: And back then obviously phones didn't exist males mailed didn't exist. They were just walking around
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_01: And they didn't know where they're going exactly and it took them two years
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_01: So imagine that imagine sending someone off on a trip or two years and having no idea like what's going on if they're ever going to come back
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_01: And that's what entrepreneurship kind of feels like it could have took two years
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_01: It could have took five years who knows but we're just going to go in that direction and I pray and I hope that we're going to find something
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_01: That's like what the uncertainty feels like
[00:28:16] Exactly and every year you're like now I know now
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_00: And then you say that again the next year like oh well last year we were so so dumb
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_00: But this year now we haven't figured out and it takes a certain amount of self-delusion to not
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_00: Be like hey man listen you said that three times already and now
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_00: Do I really believe you this time and so you need you need delusion?
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_00: I think that's also why you got to move to San Francisco is because you'll be surrounded by success stories
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_00: And you'll see them and be like okay cool that guy's not special I could do it if you could do it
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_00: I could do it and also everybody around you is similarly deluded
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_00: Which really helps because
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: You sort of brainwash yourselves into this mode where you're going to keep going keep taking shots and that that's a normal
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_00: Rational thing to do even though it's a completely abnormal irrational thing to do
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_00: I think it's one of the biggest benefits of coming to Silicon Valley
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_00: Can I write off just a few tiny ones?
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_01: So I did this thing called the Frisco disco taxi where we dressed up in disco outfits with
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_01: Afros and we gave rides home for people on New Year's Eve. It's like before lift. Yeah, before left
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_01: Or maybe like right or really had lift figured out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I tend or do
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_01: I
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_01: We made $800 that I did a copywriting class at Neville
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_01: We actually hosted it at your office. I think we each made $10,000 for maybe mid $10,000 total and then another couple failures
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_01: I bought some real estate and I learned that basically the way you make real estate is through doing the most due diligence up front and looking at
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_01: Tons and tons and tons of property because you make your money when you buy and that is not my skill set
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_01: And then of course I had the hustle the hustle started as a conference then to a blog then to a newsletter
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_01: Which worked we launched this thing called trends which was a fairly successful thing and then we expanded our events business
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_01: Events businesses horrible the way that we did it horrible
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_01: We had hundreds or thousands of people coming to each event way better to go after smaller groups and charging a lot more
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_01: But back then I couldn't even imagine the idea of someone being willing to spend two or three or four or five thousand dollars
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_01: Particular to a trade show and I wish I would have
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_01: Figured that out. Yeah, and then this podcast turned out to be a business. We didn't really realize it
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_00: You know, I definitely I started it alone. I definitely didn't think of it as a business
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_00: Did you join I still don't think we thought of it as a business for what the first two or three years for the first nine months
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm almost certain it made zero dollars, right? No, I had a sponsor somewhere there
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_00: I mean round down to zero. Yes
[00:30:41] You know like 10 20 grams, so I posted this photo
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_01: I want I want people to like understand this so Sean came up with the podcast
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_01: I think in July and then I think I joined him in September so we did a a bunch alone and then I joined them later on
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_01: I think sometime in December so we're talking six months in
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: Lance Armstrong
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_01: For some reason read the hustle and I became friendly equitances with him
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_01: He wanted to use my office where Sean and I were recording the podcast and so he
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_01: Came that day when Sean and I recording because he messaged me saying I need to use an office to for a meeting
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_01: Can I use this and I said yeah?
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_01: We pull him into the podcast as we're recording and I posted this photo of me
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_01: Lance and Sean sitting there and we only have two microphones
[00:31:27] Enter chairs and two chairs and Sean and the slot chairs my shot
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_01: It's like sitting on like the arm of my chair and during the
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_00: During the episode when Sean wants to talk
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_01: He has to like lead it to reach my microphone and then
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_01: Another episode we had someone like we had a guest call it it was like a digital guest
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_01: It was me and Sean in real life and other guests
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_01: For some reason one of us didn't have air pods and so we just like shared an air pod like what each had one in our ear
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_01: And I think we were recording on an iPhone like it was so janky even six months into it. Yeah
[00:32:05] Which was funny too because it's not even like these were the early days of podcasting
[00:32:10] It's like pretty late in the game of podcasting
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_00: Someone should go and look at those old chairs that we use we picked these chairs because there is a podcast at the time called
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: Fighter in the kid and they use these bright red chairs the brightest red chairs that we figured they use it
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_01: So it sticks out on a thumbnail
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: Which I don't even know if we did YouTube at the time
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_01: But we wanted those chairs and it is just a hilarious looking set
[00:32:33] Honestly, it got to be pretty cool one when we were in person together
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_00: It was pretty amazing. I always wanted to be doing that. Oh my god. It would be the best
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_01: It would be the best it was so much fun and we had like a we ran to best buy and bought like a video camera
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_01: And then we had an intern
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_01: Record us and the shot is just you and I like it's dead on you and I talking and the guys that we were
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_01: Copying was the Ovan in Brennan shop who obviously the Ovan is the Ovan now, but back then he was
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_01: Like a cameo like he came in as a cameo for the podcast
[00:33:06] Yeah
[00:33:08] Good times
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_01: It feels nostalgic going through this stuff doesn't it because you are with me for most of it or a lot of it
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_01: But doesn't this is kind of fun to like look back and like it's crazy this the stuff that we've done
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_01: Yes, I mean when you're in it you just get one and get out of it. It's so bad, right?
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_00: God, I just want something to work
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_00: Anything is this gonna work? I really hope this thing works
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_00: And I just wanted to get out of it so bad and then now you're right, you know, you look back
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_00: And I've really never had as much fun since as I did on the come up like to come up. Well, it's really
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_00: It was a lot more I don't know high variance or just like
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: Unpredictable and like crazy stuff happen and it was fun things that I would never make the time to do now
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_00: Like you're never gonna go do Sam's frisco disco now
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_00: You're never gonna go do the hot dog stand now
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_00: But actually those are pretty fun like kind of random projects great stories great photos great like
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_00: Memories of trying to pull it off that you were at the time, you know too dumb to know it was dumb
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_00: And now unfortunately, you know, you sort of have the curse of knowledge the further you go where
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_00: You're less likely to go try random dumb things that might actually have high you know high upside or high fun or high memories
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_00: You know that come at the end of it. I will be have a lot of like young guys will sitting to the sewer in their 20s
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_01: Enjoy it man. It was it was such a blast. It doesn't feel that way
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_01: But I would say with a high degree of certainty if you do the same thing or you try really hard for 10 years and keep taking risks
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_01: You and I Sean have dozens of friends from that same era
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_01: And we have seen dozens of them like many many many of them succeed not always like
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_01: Total tolerance will we have many of those but a lot of base hits a lot of doubles a lot of life changing
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_01: Businesses have been built and it's so exciting to like look back and be like it works. You just gotta do it
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_01: It is I mean it sounds corny
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_00: But the truth is at the time you think your success is about how hard you're working and maybe your idea or your team or your execution of the
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_00: The individual thing and that's true like at the project level, but at a personal level
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_00: The only thing that's gonna determine your success is basically your rate of learning
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_00: How quickly are you figuring things out? Are you adapting and learning and getting better at your next shot than your word your last shot
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_00: It's that rule of 100 right like do 100 try it a hundred times and each time try to make one thing better
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_00: If you do that your success is pretty much inevitable
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_00: But at the time you don't think like that at the time you don't really realize that
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_00: But looking back that's very much the case
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure there's some people who have a way to get there a lot faster
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_00: You know for both you and I took 10 years because we sort of through process of elimination got rid of most of the dumb things
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_00: You did do one thing differently than I think most people did you'd ever made the mistake of building something nobody wanted
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_00: Which is the maybe the main mistake I did I had a bunch of things that the business sounds great on paper if it works
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_00: It's gonna be huge
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: But nobody even wants the thing to begin with so you don't you die on the launch pad
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_00: Whereas you made the opposite everything you made people wanted whether it was hot dogs whiskey whether it was like you know
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_00: Way to get rid of their itch
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_00: Whatever it was you know you you had a way you always made something that people wanted
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes the business model was broken or the scalability was broken
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_00: But I feel like you did the you did one thing really well
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_00: Which is you never made the the cardinal sin which I would say most entrepreneurs make
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_00: Which is you do something that sounds good on paper
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_00: But nobody actually wants the thing you're making yours you spend all your energy trying to convince them
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_00: Why they're wrong and why you're right and actually no they just don't want it they don't need it
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_00: You know what's funny?
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_01: Looking back I like for example the hustle
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_01: I think we are at a hundred thousand subscribers in your one and then I think it was 500 in year two and then a million and three something like that
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: And that sounds lovely it didn't feel like it at the time
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_01: It still felt like I was pushing a rock up a hill and so you're saying I made things that people wanted
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_01: Um looking back I agree
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_01: But when you're going through it like I remember Ryan Hoover launched a product on it and people were talking about his product way more than like my product and I was like
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_01: That that's what product market looks like not mine
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_01: I've never experienced that what the hell and I look back at it and I did have it and so some of these things when you're in the thick of it
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_01: You have to really work hard to
[00:37:11] Try to come up with these lessons in the like at the time and you have to like sit by yourself to come up with these lessons in the time
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: Because there has been so many things looking background like had I only done this I would have had so much more
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_01: I would have worked so much better
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_01: But I didn't learn those lessons in the process
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_01: So for example
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_01: I used to think that it I was like I want to become a big company so I have to act corporate
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_01: Now I know you want to act small as as long as you can or if you have something that is growing at like 50% a year
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_01: Don't mess with it. That's a great growth rate whereas if you see other people or I saw all the people at time growing significantly faster
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_01: But but but they ended up like dying and blew up
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_01: But I was like I want to grow that fast what the hell and I'm looking back. I'm like no no no that was that was a rocket
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_01: That was fantastic. That was great. It was good strapped. It was it was beautiful
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_01: I think that um that I heard this line that basically says um
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_01: VC is like rocket fuel and you know who deserves rocket fuel rockets not fast cars not cool cars not cars that you love
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_01: Rockets and the thing about rockets is most of them blow up and don't go anywhere a cool car a great car
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_01: Car you love that could be an amazing life and it could actually get to destination eventually
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_01: But it might go a little bit slower and I thought that was an insult to me
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_01: I said but I want a rocket and I wanted to work nonsense. I wanted a car um and
[00:38:29] I wish I would have like had the confidence back then and learned that lesson that that was the way
[00:38:34] SPEAKER_01: All right, so that same story
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_00: Made his first million at 31
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_00: But instead of focusing on how he did it which we've talked about before it's the tool
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_00: You know, I don't know 10 15 things he tried
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_00: Before that the stumbles and fumbles on the way to success. I'm gonna do mine
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_00: We'll do one next episode. I'll do my I'll do my version of that where I tell you all the
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_00: Terrible terrible ideas that I had going up to finally making it
[00:38:58] oh
