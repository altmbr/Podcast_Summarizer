[00:00:53] Unknown Guest: which is what you need.
[00:00:54] Dude, I'd rather take drugs.
[00:00:55] Unknown Guest: This is the only podcast where you're going to get AI.
[00:00:57] Unknown Guest: That's triple H reference from wrestling.
[00:00:59] Unknown Guest: I mean, the range is incredible.
[00:01:01] Unknown Guest: We're going to get insulin for this episode.
[00:01:09] So one of the reasons you're great is because you made money in all these random ways
[00:01:15] Unknown Guest: that I wouldn't have even ever thought to.
[00:01:16] Unknown Guest: You created a domain auction and made real things in dollars that way.
[00:01:20] Unknown Guest: I think you did like a fee fighters thing.
[00:01:21] Unknown Guest: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:22] Unknown Guest: You called it a card fee fighter thing.
[00:01:23] Unknown Guest: Credit card processing.
[00:01:24] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:01:25] Unknown Guest: Credit card processing.
[00:01:26] Unknown Guest: You've got a $450 million fund down.
[00:01:28] Unknown Guest: You're probably, if anything is in FinTech, I go to you as basically like,
[00:01:32] Unknown Guest: hey, gut check.
[00:01:32] Unknown Guest: It's this smart or is this dumb?
[00:01:34] Unknown Guest: Because it's easy to fool me.
[00:01:35] Unknown Guest: It's hard to fool you.
[00:01:36] Unknown Guest: He also started thistle.
[00:01:37] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:01:38] Unknown Guest: A food delivery business that's like doing over $100 million a year.
[00:01:41] Unknown Guest: So all these different spaces,
[00:01:42] Unknown Guest: the guy got married in the metaverse that I talk about.
[00:01:44] Unknown Guest: Whatever the hell that means.
[00:01:46] Unknown Guest: We call you the most interesting man in tech and I stand by it.
[00:01:49] Unknown Guest: I have yet to meet a more interesting man in tech.
[00:01:51] Unknown Guest: Welcome.
[00:01:52] Unknown Guest: She'll back for around three or four.
[00:01:54] Unknown Guest: So happy to be back.
[00:01:56] Shaan Puri: Also, I got to tell you, since the last time I was on, so many things have happened as a result
[00:02:00] Shaan Puri: of me being on.
[00:02:01] Shaan Puri: Like what?
[00:02:02] Shaan Puri: Okay.
[00:02:02] Shaan Puri: So I was hiring a chief of staff and a bunch of people applied.
[00:02:07] Shaan Puri: But one person applied and the person who got the job, my current chief of staff,
[00:02:11] Shaan Puri: is a huge fan of MFM.
[00:02:13] Shaan Puri: And she was debating leaving her current thing, which was paying her a lot more money,
[00:02:18] Shaan Puri: her previous thing.
[00:02:19] Shaan Puri: And then she was like, fuck it.
[00:02:23] Shaan Puri: I got the opportunity to work with this guy who was on MFM.
[00:02:25] Shaan Puri: I'm going to take it.
[00:02:26] Shaan Puri: And so she might chief of staff join because of MFM.
[00:02:30] Shaan Puri: That's a lot of pressure for you.
[00:02:31] Shaan Puri: I hate when people say that.
[00:02:32] Sam Parr: They're going to be like, they're like, I will let it take this big pay cut to work for you.
[00:02:35] Sam Parr: I'm like, it's a lot of pressure.
[00:02:40] Shaan Puri: Last time I was on, I talked about wanting to get better, like,
[00:02:44] Shaan Puri: photography and video with AI.
[00:02:46] Shaan Puri: And this guy Jacob reached out and he was like, I can help you.
[00:02:49] Shaan Puri: And we went out for hours in New York shooting.
[00:02:53] Shaan Puri: He showed me all the school stuff.
[00:02:55] Shaan Puri: And then I mean, your audience must be like the nicest people out there because
[00:03:02] Shaan Puri: also like recently I went back and looked at the YouTube comments.
[00:03:06] Shaan Puri: Usually a cesspool.
[00:03:07] Shaan Puri: But your guys are so nice.
[00:03:10] Shaan Puri: Everybody that listens to your podcast is super nice.
[00:03:13] Shaan Puri: Nobody was like, that guy has a big nose or whatever.
[00:03:16] Shaan Puri: People would say on YouTube comments.
[00:03:17] Shaan Puri: Everyone is like, just talking to me up, talking to you guys up.
[00:03:20] Shaan Puri: It's great.
[00:03:22] All right, the bots will work and keep you paying them.
[00:03:23] Shaan Puri: Yeah.
[00:03:24] Unknown Guest: All right.
[00:03:25] Unknown Guest: So we got, we wanted to brainstorm with you.
[00:03:27] Unknown Guest: So we asked you to bring some ideas,
[00:03:29] Unknown Guest: businesses that you think are interesting will be cool to start.
[00:03:32] Unknown Guest: I think we said $10 million ideas, which I don't even know really what that means.
[00:03:36] Unknown Guest: But here we are.
[00:03:37] Unknown Guest: She'll brought five ideas.
[00:03:39] Unknown Guest: Let's run through some of the ideas and then I want to talk about some.
[00:03:41] Unknown Guest: Oh, actually, wait, wait, before we go to the ideas,
[00:03:44] you had a great thing on, there's this idea of this 50 year mortgage.
[00:03:47] Unknown Guest: And you're my finance guy.
[00:03:48] Unknown Guest: You're my fintech guy.
[00:03:49] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:03:50] 50 year mortgage.
[00:03:51] Unknown Guest: Trump is like, you know what?
[00:03:52] Unknown Guest: More years the better.
[00:03:53] Unknown Guest: Is this a good idea of that idea of 50 year mortgage?
[00:03:55] Unknown Guest: Wait, can you guys give me context?
[00:03:56] Sam Parr: I don't really follow the news.
[00:03:57] Sam Parr: So I mean, Trump.
[00:03:59] Sam Parr: Sure.
[00:04:00] Shaan Puri: So right now, 30 year mortgage is generally the maximum in the United States.
[00:04:05] Shaan Puri: So you pay off a home over 30 years.
[00:04:07] Shaan Puri: Trump wants to address the affordability crisis,
[00:04:09] Shaan Puri: which is a real problem.
[00:04:11] Shaan Puri: And it said, what we should do is extend mortgage is to 50 years.
[00:04:14] Shaan Puri: So you're 50 years to pay it off instead of 30 years.
[00:04:16] Shaan Puri: I think it's a terrible idea because basically what happens is you give people more money.
[00:04:22] Shaan Puri: So the monthly, the month, the amount that they pay monthly goes down a little bit.
[00:04:26] Shaan Puri: But actually, you're not earning equity in the home after like the average length of time
[00:04:32] Shaan Puri: that somebody our age stays in their home is relatively low.
[00:04:36] Shaan Puri: And by that time, they'll earn no equity in the home or almost no.
[00:04:39] Shaan Puri: I think the average person spends something like six or seven years right now.
[00:04:44] Sam Parr: It's not a lot.
[00:04:45] Sam Parr: Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:04:46] Sam Parr: Six and a half years.
[00:04:47] Sam Parr: And 30 year mortgage, I think the way it's set up right now,
[00:04:50] Sam Parr: something like the first 15 years is just interest.
[00:04:52] Sam Parr: Is that right?
[00:04:53] Sam Parr: It's not just interest for your earning.
[00:04:55] Shaan Puri: You're not earning that much equity.
[00:04:57] Shaan Puri: And so here you'd be earning less.
[00:04:59] Shaan Puri: But the thing is actually switching from 30 to 50,
[00:05:02] Shaan Puri: it doesn't change the payments that much.
[00:05:05] Shaan Puri: And the real problem is that 30 year mortgage kind of worked well for
[00:05:09] Shaan Puri: an America back then, which was like, you bought a house in your upper 20s,
[00:05:15] Shaan Puri: and then you retired by 60-ish and you owned your home outright.
[00:05:20] Shaan Puri: So even today, when people retire, the median American when they retire,
[00:05:26] Shaan Puri: almost 80% of their net worth is the equity in their home.
[00:05:31] Shaan Puri: So your home is your retirement plan, right?
[00:05:34] Shaan Puri: Your home is your retirement plan.
[00:05:36] Shaan Puri: And part of that is for Americans, you can't spend it.
[00:05:40] Shaan Puri: If you could spend it, you would spend that money,
[00:05:42] Shaan Puri: but because it's in your home, you can't spend it.
[00:05:44] Shaan Puri: So I don't think the 50 year mortgage really solved anything,
[00:05:48] Shaan Puri: and actually probably what it does is drives asset prices higher.
[00:05:51] Shaan Puri: So Japan did this in the 80s.
[00:05:55] Shaan Puri: They had a bunch of problems like interest rates were zero.
[00:05:58] Shaan Puri: And asset prices went through the roof.
[00:06:00] Shaan Puri: At one point, a single property in Tokyo was worth more than all of the real estate in California.
[00:06:07] Shaan Puri: Like it was an insane bubble.
[00:06:10] Shaan Puri: And part of that was they extended mortgage times to 50 years.
[00:06:14] Shaan Puri: And actually some people got 100 year mortgage.
[00:06:16] Shaan Puri: So like your grandkids are on the hook for the prom that you buy.
[00:06:20] Shaan Puri: And asset prices went through the roof.
[00:06:22] Shaan Puri: And then leverage is nasty when it collapse.
[00:06:26] Shaan Puri: When prices drop a little bit, you're pretty screwed.
[00:06:29] Shaan Puri: So home prices have actually gone down so much so that they're still half of what they were in 1989.
[00:06:36] In Japan.
[00:06:37] Unknown Guest: In Japan, yeah.
[00:06:38] Shaan Puri: In Tokyo.
[00:06:38] Shaan Puri: Did you say one property was worth more than one property?
[00:06:42] Unknown Guest: So it was the land value under the Imperial Palace.
[00:06:48] Shaan Puri: And so it's about a half square mile of space in Tokyo.
[00:06:55] So maybe a bad idea.
[00:06:57] Unknown Guest: Yeah, from what I understand, because when rates drop here,
[00:07:02] Unknown Guest: basically the sellers just raise the price.
[00:07:04] Unknown Guest: Because they're like, oh, you're buying not really on the whole price.
[00:07:07] Unknown Guest: It's like, what do I owe per month?
[00:07:08] Unknown Guest: And what can I qualify for?
[00:07:10] Unknown Guest: If my monthly payment is X, I can afford that.
[00:07:15] Unknown Guest: So what happens is when your monthly payment goes down,
[00:07:17] Unknown Guest: whether it's because you stretch the payments over 50 years or the rates go down,
[00:07:21] Unknown Guest: what happens is the sellers just can justify a higher price.
[00:07:24] Unknown Guest: And it didn't affect anything.
[00:07:26] Unknown Guest: You just end up paying more.
[00:07:26] Unknown Guest: Because I think in a 30-year mortgage,
[00:07:30] I think you pay whatever the home price is, plus something like,
[00:07:33] Unknown Guest: what is it? 50% or something?
[00:07:35] Unknown Guest: Because the interest compounds over 30 years.
[00:07:37] Unknown Guest: And if it's 50 years, you're going to basically pay almost double
[00:07:41] Unknown Guest: the list price of the home because you pay so much more in interest.
[00:07:44] Unknown Guest: Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:45] Shaan Puri: So I think the solution, like we do have an affordability crisis, no question.
[00:07:51] Shaan Puri: But the solution is not to induce demand.
[00:07:53] Shaan Puri: Because if you induce demand, what happens?
[00:07:56] Shaan Puri: You have the same fixed amount of properties.
[00:07:58] Shaan Puri: You're just making prices go up.
[00:08:01] Shaan Puri: The solution is creating more supply,
[00:08:03] Shaan Puri: like making it easier to permit all this reform to build more housing,
[00:08:08] Shaan Puri: make it cheaper to build housing.
[00:08:10] Shaan Puri: I was listening to this person who had a different take on affordability.
[00:08:14] Sam Parr: He was like, are things less affordable today than they were in the 60s?
[00:08:18] Sam Parr: He goes, look, here's the deal.
[00:08:20] Sam Parr: In the 1960s, your version of a family vacation
[00:08:23] Sam Parr: was a road trip to a state park once a year.
[00:08:25] Sam Parr: Okay? You never traveled.
[00:08:27] Sam Parr: You didn't go on a plane.
[00:08:28] Sam Parr: You lived in a 1800s-square-foot home in Dayton, Ohio.
[00:08:31] Sam Parr: Okay?
[00:08:32] Sam Parr: Like, you had a crappy car.
[00:08:33] Sam Parr: You didn't eat out and you never took vacation.
[00:08:36] Sam Parr: Now, young people today, they want more things, which is totally fine.
[00:08:39] Sam Parr: They want to go international once a year.
[00:08:41] Sam Parr: They want to go on these cool trips.
[00:08:43] Sam Parr: They want fancy phones.
[00:08:44] Sam Parr: A new home, even the average home nowadays,
[00:08:47] Sam Parr: is a new home with two ACs and a beautiful build with a really nice kitchen
[00:08:52] Sam Parr: and a really nice bathroom.
[00:08:54] Sam Parr: And they're like, is it more, is it, are things less affordable
[00:08:57] Sam Parr: or do people just want more stuff?
[00:08:59] Sam Parr: Yeah.
[00:08:59] Sam Parr: It was like an interesting take where I was like, that's okay.
[00:09:02] Sam Parr: That actually does have a good point.
[00:09:03] Sam Parr: Because even when I grew up,
[00:09:04] Sam Parr: I didn't go, this isn't like a, oh, I'm so poor.
[00:09:06] Sam Parr: But I didn't go on a plane if I was 18 years old.
[00:09:08] Sam Parr: We didn't take like vacations.
[00:09:10] Sam Parr: Like, I do now.
[00:09:11] Sam Parr: I remember like, the AC was broken one summer
[00:09:14] Sam Parr: and we just left the windows open.
[00:09:16] Sam Parr: Like, it was a lot shared rooms, like bunk beds.
[00:09:20] Shaan Puri: There'd be like two or three kids in a room.
[00:09:22] Shaan Puri: Now each kid needs their own room.
[00:09:23] Shaan Puri: Like you said, Sam, like 14, 150,
[00:09:25] Shaan Puri: and a square feet was like a nice,
[00:09:27] Shaan Puri: sized house.
[00:09:28] Shaan Puri: And now that's not the case.
[00:09:30] Shaan Puri: Have you ever seen the TV show the wonder years?
[00:09:32] Sam Parr: Yeah.
[00:09:33] Sam Parr: And it's like, yeah, one father,
[00:09:34] Sam Parr: the husband could provide for the whole family.
[00:09:37] Sam Parr: But he was angry all the time.
[00:09:38] Sam Parr: He worked at a factory where he got like, black log.
[00:09:42] Sam Parr: And like, yeah, man.
[00:09:43] Sam Parr: Yeah.
[00:09:44] Sam Parr: Like, he was like borderline and alcoholic.
[00:09:46] Sam Parr: And he was like, front wheel the time they didn't go anywhere.
[00:09:48] Sam Parr: When they did, like, the car broke down.
[00:09:50] Sam Parr: Like, times were different.
[00:09:53] Shaan Puri: Yeah, I think, so taking the other side though,
[00:09:56] Shaan Puri: I think we shouldn't be telling people like,
[00:09:58] Shaan Puri: you shouldn't want these things.
[00:10:00] Shaan Puri: I think we should say.
[00:10:00] Shaan Puri: I'm not saying that.
[00:10:01] Shaan Puri: I'm just joking.
[00:10:02] Sam Parr: But yes.
[00:10:02] Sam Parr: Yeah.
[00:10:02] Sam Parr: So I think we should make stuff cheaper.
[00:10:06] Shaan Puri: And I think we can do that.
[00:10:07] Shaan Puri: Making the cost the inputs cheaper.
[00:10:09] Shaan Puri: I think is all possible.
[00:10:11] Shaan Puri: But I hate demand side.
[00:10:14] Adjustments.
[00:10:16] Unknown Guest: The way you said that is so made it so simple to me,
[00:10:19] Unknown Guest: which is if you make, if all you do is increase demand
[00:10:22] Unknown Guest: and the supply stays the same,
[00:10:24] Unknown Guest: you're not going to make things cheaper.
[00:10:25] Unknown Guest: You're going to make things more expensive.
[00:10:27] Unknown Guest: It's like, yeah, that obviously makes sense.
[00:10:30] All right.
[00:10:30] So a lot of people watch it, listen to this show,
[00:10:33] Sam Parr: because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do
[00:10:35] Sam Parr: when it comes to starting or growing a business.
[00:10:37] Sam Parr: And really a lot of people who are listening,
[00:10:39] Sam Parr: they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side,
[00:10:42] Sam Parr: a side hustle.
[00:10:43] Sam Parr: Now, a lot of people message Sean and I and they say,
[00:10:45] Sam Parr: all right, I want to start something on the side.
[00:10:47] Sam Parr: Is this a good idea?
[00:10:48] Sam Parr: Is that a good idea?
[00:10:49] Sam Parr: And again, what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas.
[00:10:53] Sam Parr: Well, my friends, here in luck.
[00:10:55] Sam Parr: So my old company, the Hustle,
[00:10:56] Sam Parr: they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas
[00:11:00] Sam Parr: and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database.
[00:11:04] Sam Parr: It's a list of a hundred pretty good ideas, frankly.
[00:11:07] Sam Parr: I went through them.
[00:11:07] Sam Parr: They're awesome.
[00:11:08] Sam Parr: And it gives you how to start them, how to grow them,
[00:11:11] Sam Parr: things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration.
[00:11:12] Sam Parr: So check it out.
[00:11:13] Sam Parr: It's called the side hustle idea database.
[00:11:16] Sam Parr: It's in the description below.
[00:11:17] Sam Parr: You'll see the link.
[00:11:18] Sam Parr: Click it.
[00:11:19] Sam Parr: Check it out.
[00:11:19] Sam Parr: Let me know in the comments what you think.
[00:11:22] What do you got?
[00:11:23] Unknown Guest: She'll hit us with the first one.
[00:11:24] Unknown Guest: Okay, so a lot of these are based on what's going on in my life today.
[00:11:28] Shaan Puri: So I am trying to redo my backyard.
[00:11:32] Shaan Puri: And I redid it like 10 years ago and it's like kind of a shit hole now.
[00:11:36] Shaan Puri: I want to add pavers.
[00:11:37] Shaan Puri: I want to add like a nice, maybe a waterfall, something like that.
[00:11:40] Shaan Puri: And so I've been reaching out to all these
[00:11:42] Shaan Puri: landscapers, all these backyard specialists.
[00:11:45] Shaan Puri: And the process sucks.
[00:11:47] Shaan Puri: It takes them forever to get back to me.
[00:11:50] Shaan Puri: And then they come here.
[00:11:51] Shaan Puri: All they do is measure.
[00:11:52] Shaan Puri: And like I knew the measurements to begin with.
[00:11:55] Shaan Puri: And scheduling that on my schedule and their schedule sucks.
[00:11:59] Shaan Puri: And they're coming from like an hour away sometimes just to do this like 10 minute thing.
[00:12:04] Shaan Puri: And then once they take the measurements, they're super busy.
[00:12:07] Shaan Puri: They don't get back to me for a week.
[00:12:09] Shaan Puri: And so then I'm like, can I really trust this guy?
[00:12:12] Shaan Puri: And I was talking to a guy who build a company in this space and said like,
[00:12:17] Shaan Puri: one of the things that's really important to them is just getting back to you quickly.
[00:12:21] Shaan Puri: And if they get back to you quickly, you're way more likely to purchase from them.
[00:12:24] Shaan Puri: And this is a fairly large purchase.
[00:12:26] Shaan Puri: Let's say $50,000.
[00:12:28] Shaan Puri: And so I was thinking there's got to be a better way.
[00:12:30] Shaan Puri: And you could solve this with AI in part.
[00:12:34] Shaan Puri: So all I could do is give them my address.
[00:12:36] Shaan Puri: And they know what my backyard looks like.
[00:12:38] Shaan Puri: Like they can get the measurements from satellite imagery.
[00:12:41] Shaan Puri: And they could actually give me a design.
[00:12:46] Shaan Puri: Like they could either not show up at all or when they show up,
[00:12:49] Shaan Puri: they can have an iPad with a bunch of sample designs of my place.
[00:12:53] Shaan Puri: How amazing would that be?
[00:12:55] Shaan Puri: And the idea for this came to me from a buddy of mine who has a company called DeepLon.
[00:13:01] Shaan Puri: All they do is they help lawn companies quote.
[00:13:07] Shaan Puri: And so the lawn company you put in the address,
[00:13:11] Shaan Puri: it looks at satellite imagery, uses some AI to determine how much grass you have,
[00:13:15] Shaan Puri: comes up with a square footage.
[00:13:16] Shaan Puri: It knows what you charge.
[00:13:18] Shaan Puri: It instantly gives them a quote.
[00:13:20] Shaan Puri: And they charge like a couple dollars per quote.
[00:13:24] Shaan Puri: But there's so many lawn care companies, so many lawns out there that it's actually
[00:13:26] Shaan Puri: pretty good business. And it's simple.
[00:13:29] Shaan Puri: This is actually like one step beyond that.
[00:13:32] Shaan Puri: It's not just giving you a simple quote,
[00:13:34] Shaan Puri: but it's giving you a bunch of designs and stuff like that.
[00:13:37] Shaan Puri: And I think it's very doable.
[00:13:40] Shaan Puri: And it would solve a problem that I have if these guys used it.
[00:13:44] So it's really interesting you say that Ben had told me about a business.
[00:13:47] Unknown Guest: This is very, very similar in the roofing space.
[00:13:49] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:13:50] Unknown Guest: So if you go to roofer.com, so roofr.com.
[00:13:54] Unknown Guest: And the guy's doing the same thing.
[00:13:55] Unknown Guest: It's just the quote part.
[00:13:56] Unknown Guest: So basically, I guess the way that roofing works is,
[00:14:00] Unknown Guest: if you want to get a roof or repair or whatever it is, the guy will come out.
[00:14:03] Unknown Guest: So you got to do the same thing you said.
[00:14:05] Unknown Guest: Schedule it, comes out.
[00:14:06] Unknown Guest: Just going to check out the roof today.
[00:14:08] Unknown Guest: Get a give you a quote.
[00:14:09] Unknown Guest: And the roofers hate doing this step because they make no money in the quoting process.
[00:14:13] Unknown Guest: They need to get the job.
[00:14:14] Unknown Guest: They got to go all the way up the roof.
[00:14:16] Unknown Guest: They got to schedule it.
[00:14:16] Unknown Guest: They can only do so many in a week.
[00:14:18] Unknown Guest: And so what this guy was doing, I don't remember exactly the method.
[00:14:22] Unknown Guest: But I know what he was doing, which was he's like, hey, he'd go to the roofers and say,
[00:14:25] Unknown Guest: hey, anytime you need a quote done, I'll do the quote for you.
[00:14:28] Unknown Guest: You know, you just pay me like a small amount basically to go do this quote for you.
[00:14:33] Unknown Guest: And I think he was using either drones or imagery in some ways.
[00:14:36] Unknown Guest: I think it was drones.
[00:14:37] Unknown Guest: The drone to fly by, it would auto do the quote for you.
[00:14:40] Unknown Guest: So you would have a way faster quote, which increases your odds of getting the job.
[00:14:44] Unknown Guest: You didn't have to go do it yourself.
[00:14:45] Unknown Guest: They can scale.
[00:14:46] Unknown Guest: So it can do way more quotes per week than the roofer could have done themselves.
[00:14:50] Unknown Guest: And it takes off like, you know, one part of the sales funnel that they really hated doing.
[00:14:55] Unknown Guest: And I think this business is doing really well.
[00:14:56] Unknown Guest: I think he's bootstrapping this.
[00:14:58] Unknown Guest: I'm not entirely sure, but I think this is this business doing really well.
[00:15:00] Unknown Guest: Last time I heard the numbers for it.
[00:15:02] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:15:02] Unknown Guest: And I think you could do the same thing for like pools, decks,
[00:15:05] Shaan Puri: pergolas, like playgrounds, fences, outdoor kitchens, like all this kind of stuff
[00:15:12] Shaan Puri: would be fairly easy to do.
[00:15:14] Shaan Puri: So you could build, you could build this in one niche and then go into all the others.
[00:15:18] Shaan Puri: You guys remember the, there was like two or three tech guys that left their like
[00:15:23] Sam Parr: seemingly great tech companies, I think, and like started bathroom remodel businesses.
[00:15:28] Sam Parr: I think the first one was this guy named Roger.
[00:15:31] Sam Parr: So Roger was like previously like, I think he started Zinga or something like that.
[00:15:35] Sam Parr: He founded Mafia Wars, which was part of Zinga.
[00:15:38] Shaan Puri: Okay, sorry.
[00:15:39] Shaan Puri: I'm in the ballpark.
[00:15:40] Sam Parr: You're in the ballpark.
[00:15:41] Sam Parr: I'm not right.
[00:15:42] Sam Parr: Okay.
[00:15:42] Sam Parr: And then, but like Geekster was like a, like a, you know, raised by raised money from prominent
[00:15:47] Sam Parr: investors and then he left to start made.com, which was basically like a, you know how like the best
[00:15:53] Sam Parr: barbers you go and you sit down in the chair and they're like, what do you want?
[00:15:56] Sam Parr: And you're like, uh, just do like a little, he, I don't know.
[00:15:58] Sam Parr: Just like, give me like the Justin Bieber.
[00:16:00] Sam Parr: And the great barbers are like, there's option one, option two, option three, option four.
[00:16:05] Sam Parr: Here's the menu.
[00:16:05] Sam Parr: Which one do you want?
[00:16:06] Sam Parr: You're like, give me that one.
[00:16:07] Sam Parr: Give me the four.
[00:16:08] Sam Parr: He did that for bathrooms and it like killed it.
[00:16:11] Sam Parr: And then the second guy was this guy I think named Luke, one of the co-founders of Casper.
[00:16:16] Sam Parr: He left Casper and he's start a, I think, I think bathrooms and kitchens, but it might
[00:16:21] Sam Parr: just call block, block renovation.
[00:16:23] Unknown Guest: Was it just, was it both of them or just bathrooms?
[00:16:26] Unknown Guest: Same thing.
[00:16:27] It was bathrooms.
[00:16:28] Unknown Guest: Maybe now they expanded the kitchens.
[00:16:29] Unknown Guest: And by the way, I don't know how these businesses have all done now, but like super interesting
[00:16:33] Unknown Guest: where it was like, hey, here's four.
[00:16:35] Unknown Guest: You can pick off the menu.
[00:16:36] Unknown Guest: You want your bathroom to look like this, this, this, or this.
[00:16:38] Unknown Guest: And it was like running Facebook ads.
[00:16:40] Unknown Guest: We talked about this years ago on the hot run of Facebook ads for people who wanted
[00:16:44] Unknown Guest: upgrade their bathroom, which is not how they were, how any other construction company was selling
[00:16:48] Unknown Guest: to customers.
[00:16:49] Unknown Guest: So you have this new channel and they're requiring customers to do these like expensive
[00:16:53] Unknown Guest: bathroom renovations using this like kind of pick off the menu model, which I thought was pretty
[00:16:58] Unknown Guest: fascinating.
[00:16:59] Shaan Puri: I think it's interesting, but it's, it's so complex and things can go wrong and get bad reviews
[00:17:04] Shaan Puri: based on your partner or whatever.
[00:17:07] Shaan Puri: I feel like it's a very complicated business.
[00:17:08] Shaan Puri: I don't know why.
[00:17:09] Shaan Puri: I know, I think Roger sold made to like Home Depot.
[00:17:12] Shaan Puri: I don't know how good of a business it was.
[00:17:15] Shaan Puri: What I like about this one is it's really software.
[00:17:17] Shaan Puri: Like you just have to sell these folks and you're not on the hook for anything else.
[00:17:21] Shaan Puri: And it could be a pretty lean team.
[00:17:23] Shaan Puri: I think you can easily do a 10 line of revenue on this business.
[00:17:26] Shaan Puri: Right.
[00:17:26] Shaan Puri: I love this because you know, I hate when people want to start a marketing agency because
[00:17:30] Unknown Guest: you're signing up to be a genius every month.
[00:17:32] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:17:33] Unknown Guest: It's like, oh, I'm going to be and every business really cares how their marketing is going.
[00:17:37] Unknown Guest: And they're going to be on the you're going to be on your ass and you got to continually be
[00:17:40] Unknown Guest: fighting versus things like compliance.
[00:17:43] Unknown Guest: It's like nobody wants nobody cares how their compliance is going as long as it's not a problem.
[00:17:47] Unknown Guest: So similarly here like roofing.
[00:17:49] Unknown Guest: It's like doing the quote is very different than the emotional purchase of a new bathroom
[00:17:54] Unknown Guest: that's going to go in our master bath.
[00:17:56] Unknown Guest: That's like, I really get how the crowd was done or whatever.
[00:17:59] Unknown Guest: I don't know what that word is.
[00:18:00] Unknown Guest: I just used it to that work.
[00:18:00] Unknown Guest: I don't know.
[00:18:01] Unknown Guest: Yeah, you're there.
[00:18:02] Unknown Guest: So, so, so you know, you want to sell things.
[00:18:04] Unknown Guest: Ideally that people don't have extreme like preference and emotional attachment to because
[00:18:10] Unknown Guest: you're the the bar for deliveries so much higher than it is for boring things that they don't
[00:18:15] Unknown Guest: really care about.
[00:18:16] Unknown Guest: So, you know, I like the example you gave better and also the fact that you could do it for
[00:18:21] Unknown Guest: if you could do it for roofing, you can do it for lawns, you could do it for pooling.
[00:18:24] Unknown Guest: Totally.
[00:18:24] Unknown Guest: It's a blueprint business.
[00:18:25] Unknown Guest: Anybody can go do these businesses.
[00:18:27] Unknown Guest: Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:27] Unknown Guest: It's a it's a stereotype true of Indian guys that they don't like being handy.
[00:18:31] Sam Parr: That's like saying, do white men not like to jump?
[00:18:34] Unknown Guest: Like, you know, it's not that we don't like being handy.
[00:18:36] Unknown Guest: We're just not handy.
[00:18:37] Unknown Guest: Okay.
[00:18:37] Unknown Guest: Like all the all the blood rushes to our brains.
[00:18:40] Shaan Puri: There's just nothing left in the limb.
[00:18:42] Shaan Puri: My dad likes being handy, but like I've looked at he owns some of our buildings and I've
[00:18:48] Shaan Puri: looked at reviews and people are like whenever I need a problem, there's like Mr. McGiver
[00:18:53] Shaan Puri: who's like trying to solve it with like he doesn't have the right tools or anything,
[00:18:57] Shaan Puri: but he like creates some crazy way to solve some problem.
[00:19:00] Shaan Puri: The Indian handyman comes to your house when you have a problem and just convinced
[00:19:04] Unknown Guest: us that it's okay and you need to compromise and life is not about getting what you want.
[00:19:07] Unknown Guest: Yeah, it'll be fun.
[00:19:08] Unknown Guest: And now looking you guys know, just talking about like, you know, like a bathroom remodeled
[00:19:15] Sam Parr: startup.
[00:19:16] Sam Parr: No, but this one works.
[00:19:17] Unknown Guest: This is an Indian friendly business.
[00:19:18] Unknown Guest: It's satellite images for the price quoting and then you hand it to a strong guy who's
[00:19:23] Unknown Guest: going to be able to go do the do the manly stuff.
[00:19:26] Unknown Guest: Exactly.
[00:19:27] Strong idea with number one.
[00:19:28] Unknown Guest: Okay, so that's number one.
[00:19:29] Unknown Guest: And then number two is maybe an offshoot on that.
[00:19:32] Shaan Puri: You could start with number one and go in and number two, but every let's use this
[00:19:36] Shaan Puri: back backyard guys.
[00:19:38] Shaan Puri: So every service business runs the same work list.
[00:19:40] Shaan Puri: Like you get a call or an online whatever thumbtack.
[00:19:44] Shaan Puri: So you have to answer calls, you schedule jobs, then you dispatch a crew, you follow up
[00:19:51] Shaan Puri: and you respond with an with an estimate and then you know, you schedule the job and
[00:19:56] Shaan Puri: then you ask for reviews.
[00:19:59] Shaan Puri: And I think all of that stuff, a lot of that stuff is super automatable.
[00:20:04] Shaan Puri: And I think the big unlock is actually AI voice.
[00:20:07] Shaan Puri: Like I think a lot of people are sleeping on how good AI voice is already today and
[00:20:13] Shaan Puri: how useful it would be for something like this.
[00:20:15] Shaan Puri: Actually yesterday or the day before Bill Ackman posted something about Elon Musk and he was
[00:20:20] Shaan Puri: like, I'm not sure if this was AI or not.
[00:20:24] Shaan Puri: And like the three of us are like, are you fucking kidding me?
[00:20:27] Shaan Puri: It's obviously AI.
[00:20:29] Shaan Puri: What was it?
[00:20:30] Shaan Puri: It was a fake video about Elon Musk and it was so obviously fake.
[00:20:34] Shaan Puri: It like didn't have his mannerisms or anything.
[00:20:36] Shaan Puri: And it was like talking slowly.
[00:20:38] Shaan Puri: It was kind of his voice kind of not.
[00:20:40] Shaan Puri: But the fact that Bill Ackman, I don't know how old he is, maybe 60.
[00:20:44] Shaan Puri: He couldn't tell or he was like, I'm not sure if this AI.
[00:20:48] Shaan Puri: So that means that AI voice is already good enough.
[00:20:51] Shaan Puri: If Bill Ackman's fooled by this video, then like a lot of people are fooled by AI voice.
[00:20:56] Shaan Puri: So already the service providers should be having AI voice do the work for them.
[00:21:03] Shaan Puri: And I think it's already good enough.
[00:21:04] Shaan Puri: It's just going to get better in the next year.
[00:21:07] So I think instead of a contractor hiring an office manager, you give them an AI office
[00:21:13] Shaan Puri: manager for like a few hundred bucks a month.
[00:21:15] Shaan Puri: And it's actually, you might think of it as a money saving thing, but it's actually
[00:21:20] Shaan Puri: not, it's more than that.
[00:21:22] Shaan Puri: It's like you have super fast response time.
[00:21:24] Shaan Puri: People responding around the clock.
[00:21:27] Shaan Puri: Whenever what when I decided to do this back, back yard remodel was like a Sunday afternoon
[00:21:33] Shaan Puri: and nobody's responding me then.
[00:21:34] Shaan Puri: But like the first person to respond is way more likely to get the job than the next
[00:21:39] Shaan Puri: person and the person after that.
[00:21:40] Shaan Puri: So like you respond super fast.
[00:21:43] Shaan Puri: There's no missed calls.
[00:21:45] Shaan Puri: You text to follow up.
[00:21:46] Shaan Puri: Like it does all that stuff for you.
[00:21:49] Shaan Puri: And it's super easy app.
[00:21:50] Shaan Puri: And so we have Alex Hermosey comes on to the powder bunch and he's one of our buddies.
[00:21:56] Sam Parr: He's got the, he like runs these like seminars or these like events that you can go to that
[00:22:00] Sam Parr: look really cool.
[00:22:01] Sam Parr: And we're, I wanted to see like how good his sales funnel was.
[00:22:04] Sam Parr: And so I went to like sign up to like a call.
[00:22:07] Sam Parr: And like as I clicked like confirm calendar, I get a phone call from a guy.
[00:22:12] Sam Parr: And it's his name Xavier.
[00:22:13] Sam Parr: And I'm like Xavier.
[00:22:14] Sam Parr: He's like, Hey Sam, what's up?
[00:22:16] Sam Parr: I just saw you book to college when you're like confirming a couple of details with you.
[00:22:19] Sam Parr: I make sure we're good.
[00:22:20] Sam Parr: And if you want, I can like move the appointment up whatever.
[00:22:21] Sam Parr: And I go, I don't believe this is you.
[00:22:23] Sam Parr: He goes, it's a real person.
[00:22:25] Sam Parr: And I was like, FaceTime me right now.
[00:22:26] Sam Parr: He's like, well, we don't have face.
[00:22:27] Sam Parr: I go, well, you know my number FaceTime me.
[00:22:29] Sam Parr: Like I know you have an iPhone.
[00:22:31] Sam Parr: And so he FaceTime's me while he's talking to me.
[00:22:33] Sam Parr: And it was him.
[00:22:34] Sam Parr: It was totally him.
[00:22:35] Sam Parr: And like it kind of like got me bought into this idea of calling leads like within minutes.
[00:22:41] Sam Parr: And like there's been so many times where I bought Yelp or been on Yelp.
[00:22:46] Sam Parr: And I'm like, literally the first person that will respond to my car wash request is coming
[00:22:50] Sam Parr: to my house right now.
[00:22:51] Sam Parr: I don't care how much it costs.
[00:22:52] Sam Parr: There's a first person.
[00:22:53] Sam Parr: Exactly.
[00:22:54] Unknown Guest: And she'll, what do you think is going to be the challenge of?
[00:22:56] Unknown Guest: Because I've seen it.
[00:22:57] Unknown Guest: I've this idea makes so much sense to me.
[00:23:00] Unknown Guest: And there's, there's a couple of them out there.
[00:23:02] Unknown Guest: What do you think is going to be the key?
[00:23:04] Unknown Guest: If you're the founder, you're running a business like this.
[00:23:07] Unknown Guest: What do you think you need to do to win?
[00:23:09] Unknown Guest: What would you do?
[00:23:10] Unknown Guest: To market or like how would you, how would you take this idea that I think a lot of people
[00:23:14] Unknown Guest: are going to have, but how would you end up being the winner?
[00:23:16] Unknown Guest: What do you think would make the difference between winning and fourth place?
[00:23:19] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:23:20] Shaan Puri: So it's too bad that AI Robocalling is illegal because what I would probably do is just
[00:23:26] Sam Parr: have my voice.
[00:23:28] I would just have my voice agent call each of these people.
[00:23:32] Shaan Puri: Right.
[00:23:33] Shaan Puri: So maybe you can do it where like, I don't know what the legality of this is.
[00:23:37] Shaan Puri: But like, maybe you do it where your AI voice agent calls in and you're on the call.
[00:23:45] Shaan Puri: And it, maybe it's fine then.
[00:23:48] Shaan Puri: And the AI voice agent is so good that you convince them.
[00:23:52] Shaan Puri: So you just call each of these people and convince them that their agent is so good.
[00:23:56] Shaan Puri: Like, don't you want to try this?
[00:23:58] Shaan Puri: Try it for free.
[00:23:59] Shaan Puri: I'll just send you leads right now.
[00:24:01] Shaan Puri: And you do it that way and it can be a great business.
[00:24:05] Shaan Puri: I want to ask you.
[00:24:06] Sam Parr: You have like two or three more ideas on here that are actually really good.
[00:24:09] Sam Parr: One that is like, like, has the least amount of information on it.
[00:24:12] Sam Parr: I actually have a question about it.
[00:24:14] Sam Parr: Let's do it.
[00:24:15] Sam Parr: So you put on here something about peptides because everyone, because everyone in SF is doing
[00:24:23] Sam Parr: it.
[00:24:24] Sam Parr: And yes, this is me just like wanting to get information.
[00:24:27] Sam Parr: So your peptides, basically, it's a category of drugs, whatever we can talk about it.
[00:24:32] Sam Parr: Like oftentimes people use peptides and TRT and HGH interchangeably or in the same ballpark.
[00:24:40] Sam Parr: Are you saying that all the nerds in SF are now in testosterone or peptides?
[00:24:44] Sam Parr: Everyone is peptides and everyone's got their dealer.
[00:24:49] Shaan Puri: So the way this works is like, the peptides are like these amino acids that tell your brain
[00:24:58] Shaan Puri: to repair or regulate something.
[00:25:01] Shaan Puri: You're like precursors to protein or something like that where you can like, so it's really
[00:25:06] Shaan Puri: good for a bunch of things that your body can do and regulate.
[00:25:10] Shaan Puri: So like healing, body composition, like give you more energy, control your appetite.
[00:25:16] Shaan Puri: Those are GLP ones.
[00:25:18] Shaan Puri: The problem is the problem with this business idea is they're not legal or they're legal
[00:25:23] Shaan Puri: for research purposes.
[00:25:25] Shaan Puri: They're not approved for the applications that people are using them for.
[00:25:28] That's right.
[00:25:29] Shaan Puri: I don't know where the opportunity is here, but it's like really complicated to use them.
[00:25:36] Shaan Puri: And like in San Francisco, everyone's doing it.
[00:25:38] Shaan Puri: See your friends are doing it.
[00:25:39] Shaan Puri: They're like, oh, I got this peptide and it's been so great for me or whatever.
[00:25:44] Shaan Puri: And of course, like there are challenges in it not being FDA approved.
[00:25:48] Shaan Puri: But I think for the most part, these are things that people have been using for years and
[00:25:53] Shaan Puri: have some sense of efficacy on.
[00:25:56] Shaan Puri: People are getting some are glutide, like ozemic and other ozemic like things via peptides.
[00:26:05] Shaan Puri: And so a lot of people right now, longevity is a huge opportunity.
[00:26:09] Shaan Puri: You've seen like function health and superpower and others do really well there.
[00:26:13] Shaan Puri: So there's a ton of interest, but the experience I've had with peptides is confusing and sketchy.
[00:26:19] Shaan Puri: So I actually haven't tried them yet, but I've tons of friends are talking about it.
[00:26:23] Shaan Puri: So I feel like there's some educational opportunity.
[00:26:27] Shaan Puri: There's some like dosing guidance, safety, some high-trust supply chain and coaching opportunity
[00:26:35] Shaan Puri: in this space.
[00:26:36] Shaan Puri: But I don't know what it is.
[00:26:38] Shaan Puri: And the FDA approval thing obviously is a big problem.
[00:26:41] Interesting.
[00:26:42] Unknown Guest: So you're saying maybe right now because the legality and the approval part of selling
[00:26:46] Unknown Guest: the things directly is sketch.
[00:26:49] Unknown Guest: You would build the biggest most trusted information source so that when the time comes that this
[00:26:54] Unknown Guest: becomes more clear, you either become the highest value affiliate or you yourself could
[00:26:59] Unknown Guest: start to deal some, deal peptides.
[00:27:02] Unknown Guest: Exactly.
[00:27:03] Unknown Guest: Exactly.
[00:27:04] Unknown Guest: Right.
[00:27:05] Unknown Guest: Have you guys heard of peptides or you have friends on them?
[00:27:08] Unknown Guest: I heard of it because Sam, like five years ago before peptides was really a thing, told
[00:27:13] Unknown Guest: me he has a kill he's hurt.
[00:27:15] Unknown Guest: And he was on some Reddit forum and got a vial of something and injected it into his
[00:27:19] Unknown Guest: body and I was like, bro, what are you doing?
[00:27:22] Unknown Guest: You know, just take the drugs off the internet.
[00:27:24] Unknown Guest: And he's like, it's amazing.
[00:27:26] Unknown Guest: I feel like Wolverine.
[00:27:27] Unknown Guest: BP157, baby.
[00:27:28] Unknown Guest: Oh, people love BP157.
[00:27:30] Sam Parr: I'm not paying any money.
[00:27:31] Unknown Guest: So he told me about it.
[00:27:33] Sam Parr: My daughter who was just born, that's her middle name, BP157.
[00:27:36] Sam Parr: Like, I love that stuff.
[00:27:40] Sam Parr: So yeah, look, like I've always been like into this stuff.
[00:27:43] Sam Parr: And if you listen to the podcast, you know, I'm going to kind of brag a little bit here.
[00:27:46] Sam Parr: But like, semi-gallery tighted, ozepic, dude, when it got popular, that was old dues to
[00:27:52] Sam Parr: us on this podcast.
[00:27:53] Sam Parr: We had been talking about it.
[00:27:54] Sam Parr: All right.
[00:27:55] Sam Parr: I had already overdosed on it.
[00:27:56] Sam Parr: I got to told you all about it.
[00:27:58] Sam Parr: And then when I, and so I was into this stuff in San Francisco and then I moved to Austin
[00:28:04] Sam Parr: and that's when I really got my fix, man.
[00:28:06] Sam Parr: Like every Jack I ever was like showing me all the cool stuff that they're doing.
[00:28:10] Sam Parr: And not a lot of the stuff was like, like, it's not, wasn't like us, I don't know,
[00:28:13] Sam Parr: actually the definition of a steroids, but it wasn't like an anabolic like make your
[00:28:17] Sam Parr: muscles huge.
[00:28:18] Sam Parr: But there was like BP157 for when I hurt my Achilles.
[00:28:20] Sam Parr: Someone was like, you should try this or you should try your shoulder.
[00:28:23] Sam Parr: And there's all these like weird peptides and weird things that were got, were around
[00:28:28] Sam Parr: longevity.
[00:28:29] Sam Parr: Not like, how do I look like triple H like, you know, in wrestling?
[00:28:32] Sam Parr: Like not like, how do I like huge, but how do like live a long time?
[00:28:34] Sam Parr: And so yeah, I've been fascinated by all this stuff.
[00:28:37] Sam Parr: And I think that, I think there's a lot of really interesting stuff and I still test
[00:28:41] Sam Parr: on to the stuff and I got a guy, I text them.
[00:28:44] Sam Parr: I got a guy, I text them and I've had no, it's incredibly shady.
[00:28:48] Sam Parr: However, Sharn and I invested in a company called Hone.
[00:28:51] Sam Parr: Oh yeah.
[00:28:52] Sam Parr: Well, I figured what they originally called peak, peak health or something like that.
[00:28:55] Sam Parr: Yeah, I don't even remember, but they were originally just TRT.
[00:28:58] Sam Parr: Now they do everything and we get them monthly updates and this is like the chart is like
[00:29:02] Sam Parr: you want the chart to look this way.
[00:29:04] Sam Parr: And I think that they're doing a really good job of not looking like, you know, for a long
[00:29:08] Sam Parr: time actually we talked about TRT clinics, Sharn and I, you and I did.
[00:29:12] Sam Parr: And it was like, dude, the biggest TRT clinic is like this guy based out of Vegas and he's
[00:29:15] Sam Parr: got these like stores and you go to the store to get your TRT and they have like lazy boy
[00:29:19] Sam Parr: leather sofas and like Monday night football on and it's like, it was like the lamest, like
[00:29:24] Sam Parr: I'm most untrusty with thing.
[00:29:25] Sam Parr: And so Hone is actually a good example of, they do, they also do female stuff too.
[00:29:30] Sam Parr: I don't know what type of drugs women take, but they sell women drugs as well.
[00:29:34] Sam Parr: And they've done a much better job.
[00:29:36] Sam Parr: It's not like Spanish where there's like a male and female.
[00:29:39] Unknown Guest: Yeah, I don't know.
[00:29:40] Unknown Guest: I don't know.
[00:29:41] Unknown Guest: I don't know.
[00:29:42] I don't know.
[00:29:43] Unknown Guest: I don't know.
[00:29:44] Unknown Guest: I don't know.
[00:29:45] Unknown Guest: Whatever you guys take, whatever you're into, I guess there's a little bit of an everything
[00:29:51] Unknown Guest: for everyone.
[00:29:52] Unknown Guest: This is the only podcast where you get to get AI, TRT, AAA, triple H reference from wrestling
[00:29:56] Unknown Guest: that is having the range is incredible.
[00:29:59] Unknown Guest: Dude, I looked at this peptide business recently to the same thing.
[00:30:04] Unknown Guest: I'm like, okay, clearly there's demand, right?
[00:30:06] Unknown Guest: But the, how do you do this legally and what's the good way to do this?
[00:30:10] Unknown Guest: And I can't say who was doing this, but on the pitch I was like, so like, how do you plan
[00:30:14] Unknown Guest: to be like legit with this whole thing?
[00:30:17] Unknown Guest: Because it's unclear what the, what the legality is going to be of this.
[00:30:21] Unknown Guest: And the basic pulls up a picture of like, like the co-founder with like, Trump and Kennedy
[00:30:28] Unknown Guest: is like, yeah, we're pretty sure we're going to be able to get some things through that
[00:30:32] Unknown Guest: whole thing.
[00:30:33] Unknown Guest: And I was like, oh, wow.
[00:30:34] Unknown Guest: Okay, that's like probably one of the best slides I've ever seen in a deck.
[00:30:38] Unknown Guest: Yeah, this is incredible.
[00:30:39] Unknown Guest: And this is incredible.
[00:30:40] Sam Parr: And it pulls out a card from his wall.
[00:30:41] Sam Parr: He goes, I have an answer right here.
[00:30:42] Sam Parr: You're like, sir, that's a get out of jail for you card from the game monopoly.
[00:30:45] Sam Parr: That doesn't work.
[00:30:48] And so I was like, I think actually, yeah, being, we're really, we're going to be like,
[00:30:51] Unknown Guest: really close with Bobby Kennedy would be like a perfectly reasonable part of your business
[00:30:54] Unknown Guest: find right now.
[00:30:55] Unknown Guest: So is that really what he said?
[00:30:57] Unknown Guest: Literally, yeah, they're like, hey, we, they're pro this.
[00:31:00] Unknown Guest: It's going to pass and we're like, you know, we're going to do everything to write with.
[00:31:03] Unknown Guest: One thing they pointed out rightfully.
[00:31:04] Unknown Guest: So is that everybody who's in this space right now is like the kind of like, you know,
[00:31:08] Unknown Guest: like the early kind of crypto community, like kind of mid stage crypto community, where
[00:31:12] Unknown Guest: everyone's just trying to get a quick book.
[00:31:14] Unknown Guest: And they're going to go like foul.
[00:31:15] Unknown Guest: And like, you could just be coin base, right?
[00:31:17] Unknown Guest: And you could just be like, hey, we're just going to do things the right way.
[00:31:20] Unknown Guest: But we trust that over time, this will become more and more, you know, mainstream.
[00:31:25] Unknown Guest: But we're just going to do things the right way from the beginning.
[00:31:27] Unknown Guest: And like what coin base did where like, you know, all the other crypto, you know, exchanges
[00:31:31] Unknown Guest: sort of fell off is I think of a valid strategy in this case.
[00:31:36] They're like, say it with me.
[00:31:38] Sam Parr: Crony capitalism.
[00:31:39] Sam Parr: Oh, dude, this is a good topic because there's so much of it.
[00:31:44] Shaan Puri: And actually like, I've never, in the past, I'd never seen anybody pitch like a core
[00:31:52] Shaan Puri: part of their pitch as being, I'm close to administration.
[00:31:55] Shaan Puri: I've heard so many pitches about that now, which, which is kind of sad, honestly, but
[00:32:00] Shaan Puri: it is what it is.
[00:32:01] Shaan Puri: Like slide 13.
[00:32:02] Shaan Puri: We know a guy.
[00:32:03] Shaan Puri: Yeah.
[00:32:04] Shaan Puri: And this is exactly what?
[00:32:05] Shaan Puri: Why is this in your deck?
[00:32:07] Shaan Puri: Total.
[00:32:08] Shaan Puri: Actually, like I've been searching and chat GBT will not answer me a bunch of questions
[00:32:13] Shaan Puri: I have because it says peptides are not medically cleared.
[00:32:16] Shaan Puri: Like we can't answer this question.
[00:32:18] Shaan Puri: So like, one of my main sources of information is God.
[00:32:21] Shaan Puri: Right.
[00:32:22] Shaan Puri: By the way, again, a little, can we do a little politics tangent real quick earmuffs if this
[00:32:28] Unknown Guest: bothers you?
[00:32:29] Unknown Guest: But Sam, I just thought you'd find this entertain.
[00:32:31] Unknown Guest: Did you see the Trump thing about?
[00:32:33] Unknown Guest: Do you know who CZ is?
[00:32:35] Unknown Guest: Do you know who CZ is from Binance?
[00:32:36] Unknown Guest: By the Binance guy.
[00:32:37] Sam Parr: Didn't he like pardon him?
[00:32:39] Unknown Guest: But Trump definitely doesn't know what that guy is.
[00:32:42] Unknown Guest: So he pardoned him and then he gets interviewed.
[00:32:44] Unknown Guest: So the guy was in jail, I think, for four months or something like that.
[00:32:47] Unknown Guest: This guy owned like the biggest Asian crypto exchange and was like in whatever.
[00:32:53] Unknown Guest: He was in hot water for money laundering and wire fraud.
[00:32:57] Unknown Guest: A bunch of stuff where it's like, you know, bad people are sort of using your exchange
[00:33:00] Unknown Guest: to money laundering or something.
[00:33:03] And they asked them, they're like, but you pardoned this guy.
[00:33:06] Unknown Guest: And then he bought like $2 billion of your son's cryptocurrency.
[00:33:11] Unknown Guest: Like, don't you see how that seems?
[00:33:12] Unknown Guest: But like, why did you pardon him?
[00:33:14] Unknown Guest: He's like, here's the thing.
[00:33:15] Unknown Guest: You want to know what?
[00:33:16] Unknown Guest: You want to know?
[00:33:17] Unknown Guest: I don't know who he is.
[00:33:18] Unknown Guest: And I was like, while the audacity, he was just the audacity of saying, I don't even
[00:33:24] Unknown Guest: know who he is.
[00:33:25] Unknown Guest: Don't know anything about the guy.
[00:33:27] Unknown Guest: Any pardon him.
[00:33:28] Unknown Guest: I just thought that was one of the most crazy things I've ever seen.
[00:33:32] Unknown Guest: So it'll be.
[00:33:33] It's like, this man has no fear.
[00:33:36] Unknown Guest: He's not afraid of anything.
[00:33:37] Unknown Guest: He does not fear anything.
[00:33:39] Unknown Guest: If he's going to say that.
[00:33:40] Unknown Guest: He pardoned the, what was the guy from Nikola?
[00:33:42] Sam Parr: Trevor Melton.
[00:33:44] Sam Parr: Trevor Melton.
[00:33:45] Sam Parr: He pardoned that guy too.
[00:33:46] Sam Parr: What the hell, man?
[00:33:48] Sam Parr: And then they'd like to do it.
[00:33:49] Sam Parr: They're like, oh, that guy donated.
[00:33:50] Sam Parr: Yeah, it's a get out of jail, not for free card.
[00:33:53] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:33:54] Unknown Guest: Get out of jail at this fixed price.
[00:33:56] Unknown Guest: Yeah, that was insane.
[00:33:57] Shaan Puri: It was actually very low.
[00:33:58] Shaan Puri: It was like a couple million dollars.
[00:34:03] Sam Parr: And did he really say that word for word?
[00:34:04] Sam Parr: He was like, I don't know.
[00:34:05] Sam Parr: You know the word.
[00:34:06] Sam Parr: It's like, you're not, you're not ugly.
[00:34:08] Unknown Guest: You're just poor.
[00:34:09] Unknown Guest: It's like, you're not, it's like, you're not, you're not a criminal.
[00:34:13] Unknown Guest: You're just poor.
[00:34:14] Unknown Guest: You know what I mean?
[00:34:15] Unknown Guest: It's like, you can get out for, if you got access to a couple million dollars.
[00:34:17] Unknown Guest: Well, there's that joke.
[00:34:18] Unknown Guest: I forget who, where originally came from, they're like, look, if you own the bank, like
[00:34:22] Sam Parr: 50 grand, that's a big deal.
[00:34:25] Sam Parr: It's really bad for you.
[00:34:27] Sam Parr: But if you own the bank, if you own the bank, $500 million, that's really bad for the
[00:34:30] Sam Parr: bank.
[00:34:31] Sam Parr: Yeah, that's the bank's problem.
[00:34:34] The other one that was crazy was that George Santos.
[00:34:38] I just thought it was so funny.
[00:34:40] Shaan Puri: Like this is like a congressperson who lied about everything.
[00:34:44] Shaan Puri: Like he would have a different college that he went from each time you talked to him.
[00:34:47] Shaan Puri: He claimed he was Jewish.
[00:34:49] Shaan Puri: He said he was Jewish and then he was like, did you see the men Jewish?
[00:34:52] Shaan Puri: I'm Jewish.
[00:34:53] Shaan Puri: I'll hear right live.
[00:34:55] Sam Parr: There was a like a New York congressman or something like that.
[00:34:57] Sam Parr: Like kind of a local set.
[00:34:58] Sam Parr: I don't even remember what it was.
[00:35:00] Sam Parr: Not that important.
[00:35:01] Sam Parr: He was like, he was a gay Brazilian guy.
[00:35:04] Sam Parr: I think he's Brazilian.
[00:35:06] Sam Parr: And yeah, the audacity to tell people that he was Jewish.
[00:35:11] Sam Parr: And they're like, George Santos, I don't think you're Jewish.
[00:35:14] Sam Parr: He goes, oh, what did I say?
[00:35:15] Sam Parr: I was Jewish.
[00:35:16] Sam Parr: I said I was Jewish.
[00:35:17] Sam Parr: Like I'm like Jewish people.
[00:35:19] Sam Parr: Honestly, it's an old timer.
[00:35:22] Shaan Puri: It's an old timer.
[00:35:23] Shaan Puri: And then like he had so much audacity.
[00:35:26] Shaan Puri: Like he claimed that his mom died in 9-11.
[00:35:29] Shaan Puri: Like they're very good records of who died in 11.
[00:35:32] Shaan Puri: And he lived in Brazil at the time.
[00:35:34] Shaan Puri: There was no chance that that was possible.
[00:35:37] Shaan Puri: He just, anyway, pretty incredible.
[00:35:40] Shaan Puri: All right.
[00:35:41] Shaan Puri: Earmuffs can come off in the politics.
[00:35:43] Shaan Puri: All right.
[00:35:44] Shaan Puri: So what else you got?
[00:35:45] So the circus, the circus, or the EMS thing.
[00:35:48] Sam Parr: Those were all questions.
[00:35:49] Shaan Puri: Okay.
[00:35:50] Shaan Puri: Let's do the circus.
[00:35:51] Shaan Puri: Okay.
[00:35:52] Shaan Puri: So personal note, my wife and I were like old.
[00:35:54] Shaan Puri: I'm 43, my wife's 40.
[00:35:57] Shaan Puri: My wife has a genetic condition that we need to screen against.
[00:36:00] Shaan Puri: And being pregnant can trigger this condition that she has.
[00:36:04] Shaan Puri: So our doctors have said, if you can avoid pregnancy,
[00:36:07] Shaan Puri: you should do so.
[00:36:08] Shaan Puri: And we were like, okay, we can afford it.
[00:36:09] Shaan Puri: Let's do it.
[00:36:10] Shaan Puri: So we started going down the Swarigacy path.
[00:36:13] Shaan Puri: And for those of you who don't know,
[00:36:15] Shaan Puri: Swarigacy is when another mother,
[00:36:19] Shaan Puri: another person carries your child.
[00:36:22] Shaan Puri: And so you transfer your embryo to that person
[00:36:26] Shaan Puri: and then they carry your child.
[00:36:27] Shaan Puri: And it's growing very substantially.
[00:36:31] Shaan Puri: So like this wasn't really a thing not that long ago.
[00:36:35] Shaan Puri: And then actually New York only legalized it five years ago.
[00:36:38] Shaan Puri: So it's still growing very rapidly.
[00:36:40] Shaan Puri: It's obviously extremely common in the gay community
[00:36:43] Shaan Puri: because that's the only way they can have kids,
[00:36:46] Shaan Puri: their own children.
[00:36:48] Shaan Puri: And it's actually a very complicated thing how it works.
[00:36:52] Shaan Puri: There are a bunch of Swarigacy agencies out there.
[00:36:55] Shaan Puri: And the Swarigacy agencies,
[00:36:57] Shaan Puri: they have a number of women that they work with, carriers.
[00:37:03] Shaan Puri: And then they try to match you.
[00:37:05] Shaan Puri: But the way it works is they can only introduce you
[00:37:09] Shaan Puri: to people that are in their platform.
[00:37:11] Shaan Puri: So imagine if it was like, and it's a matching thing.
[00:37:16] Shaan Puri: Like there are a bunch of things that we care about.
[00:37:18] Shaan Puri: There's a bunch of things that she cares about.
[00:37:19] Shaan Puri: We ultimately found a great match
[00:37:21] Shaan Puri: and she's wonderful, we love her.
[00:37:23] Shaan Puri: And how much is it and how much does the woman get?
[00:37:26] Yeah, so it costs roughly $150 to $200,000.
[00:37:32] Okay.
[00:37:33] And that goes to her plus the agency takes a cut.
[00:37:36] Shaan Puri: Is that how it works?
[00:37:37] Shaan Puri: Agency takes a cut.
[00:37:38] Shaan Puri: She gets a certain amount.
[00:37:40] Shaan Puri: So I think in our case, she gets $75,000 roughly,
[00:37:45] Shaan Puri: something in that ballpark.
[00:37:46] Shaan Puri: There are a bunch of things that,
[00:37:49] Shaan Puri: there's a base fee and then a monthly fee and travel
[00:37:53] Shaan Puri: and time off work and all sorts of childcare
[00:37:55] Shaan Puri: all sorts of stuff that's embedded in that.
[00:37:57] Shaan Puri: And then there are a bunch of, there's like legal fees
[00:37:59] Shaan Puri: and then of course there are medical fees
[00:38:01] Shaan Puri: for like actually doing the transfer and her healthcare
[00:38:04] Shaan Puri: and her insurance that we pay for.
[00:38:05] Shaan Puri: And do you get to hang out with her?
[00:38:06] Sam Parr: Or is it like, do you see her on a monthly,
[00:38:09] Sam Parr: like do Jeffens?
[00:38:10] Sam Parr: Or?
[00:38:11] Shaan Puri: Yeah, so we hung out with her.
[00:38:12] Shaan Puri: Like so we're in San Francisco.
[00:38:14] Shaan Puri: She's in Las Vegas area.
[00:38:16] Shaan Puri: We've hung out with her.
[00:38:17] Shaan Puri: She's come to our house.
[00:38:19] Shaan Puri: We like her.
[00:38:20] Shaan Puri: We text with her.
[00:38:22] Shaan Puri: You know, when the transfer happened,
[00:38:25] Shaan Puri: we sent her stuff.
[00:38:26] Shaan Puri: Like we, you know, we've, we know what her family life is
[00:38:29] Shaan Puri: like all sorts of stuff.
[00:38:31] Shaan Puri: The thing I didn't realize going into this is
[00:38:34] Shaan Puri: there are a bunch of things that you might care about
[00:38:36] Shaan Puri: or that somebody might care about
[00:38:38] Shaan Puri: that are important in making this match.
[00:38:41] Shaan Puri: So like I thought, like I didn't really know
[00:38:45] Shaan Puri: what I would care about.
[00:38:46] Shaan Puri: But we've talked to people who care about like,
[00:38:49] Shaan Puri: what do they eat?
[00:38:50] Shaan Puri: Are they eating only organic?
[00:38:52] Shaan Puri: I met a Hindu person who said,
[00:38:54] Shaan Puri: their surrogate can't eat beef during the time of pregnancy.
[00:38:57] Shaan Puri: People obviously care about would they abort
[00:39:00] Shaan Puri: if medically important?
[00:39:02] Shaan Puri: Are they okay carrying twins?
[00:39:04] Shaan Puri: Would they have a C section?
[00:39:06] Shaan Puri: And then there are all sorts of other stuff.
[00:39:07] Shaan Puri: Like, do you want to have a relationship with this person?
[00:39:10] Shaan Puri: Like we really like our surrogate.
[00:39:11] Shaan Puri: Like we check in with her all the time
[00:39:14] Shaan Puri: and she texts us back.
[00:39:15] Shaan Puri: But anyway, there are all these things
[00:39:16] Shaan Puri: that you want to match on.
[00:39:18] Shaan Puri: But the way it works is like each agency only has
[00:39:22] Shaan Puri: a few folks that you can talk to and make that match.
[00:39:25] Shaan Puri: And it would make a lot more sense if you had a like a dating
[00:39:31] Shaan Puri: app like e-harmony.
[00:39:32] Shaan Puri: Hear the things I care about.
[00:39:33] Shaan Puri: Hear the things they care about.
[00:39:34] Shaan Puri: So it makes sense for it to be a larger thing.
[00:39:37] Shaan Puri: Imagine if you were buying a home
[00:39:39] Shaan Puri: and your real estate agent could only show you homes
[00:39:42] Shaan Puri: that they had listed.
[00:39:44] Shaan Puri: That's kind of what it is today.
[00:39:46] Shaan Puri: I think there's an opportunity in making this much more common.
[00:39:50] Shaan Puri: I think people don't realize how many medical challenges
[00:39:54] Shaan Puri: people have and that being the reason
[00:39:55] Shaan Puri: they're not able to carry and not not able to have kids.
[00:39:58] Shaan Puri: I think if people knew that some of the stigma
[00:40:00] Shaan Puri: about this would go away and you'd have more people
[00:40:03] Shaan Puri: who want to be surrogates, want to be carriers.
[00:40:06] Shaan Puri: So I think there's an opportunity to create a company
[00:40:09] Shaan Puri: that does this for people and is a much broader agency
[00:40:13] Shaan Puri: than what's out there today.
[00:40:14] Shaan Puri: And sort of does this matching process
[00:40:17] Shaan Puri: brings people on sort of recruits carriers.
[00:40:20] Shaan Puri: That's really the challenge right now
[00:40:23] Shaan Puri: is they're not enough carriers.
[00:40:24] Shaan Puri: So I think you have to create more carriers.
[00:40:27] Shaan Puri: And to do that you sort of market,
[00:40:29] Shaan Puri: you offer them a higher portion of the payment.
[00:40:33] Shaan Puri: So like I think by automating some of this stuff
[00:40:35] Shaan Puri: instead of it being a manual process where like our agency,
[00:40:39] Shaan Puri: you know, the lady's going like word of mouth
[00:40:41] Shaan Puri: to find new carriers.
[00:40:43] Shaan Puri: I think you can automate a lot of that process
[00:40:45] Shaan Puri: and create an awesome business.
[00:40:48] Shaan Puri: But I don't think this is going to be billion dollar company.
[00:40:50] Shaan Puri: Like I think there are maybe five to 10,000
[00:40:53] Shaan Puri: birds in United States every year from surrogacy.
[00:40:58] Shaan Puri: And I think that'll probably expand
[00:41:00] Shaan Puri: but I don't think you can build a billion dollar company here.
[00:41:02] Shaan Puri: I think you can build, I think you can do something
[00:41:04] Shaan Puri: great for the world and you know run a company as well.
[00:41:08] Shaan Puri: How do they recruit these women now?
[00:41:11] That's such a strange way to recruit
[00:41:12] Sam Parr: some of like it's a great question I don't know.
[00:41:16] Shaan Puri: But I think what they do is they're all these communities,
[00:41:18] Shaan Puri: Reddit, Facebook, et cetera, where people are posting
[00:41:22] Shaan Puri: and you go there and people and a lot of the agencies
[00:41:26] Shaan Puri: are there just recruiting.
[00:41:27] Shaan Puri: Can I go full crazy here?
[00:41:29] Unknown Guest: Yeah, surrogacy MLM.
[00:41:31] Yeah, I think an MLM has solved the marketing challenge
[00:41:33] Unknown Guest: of how do you recruit other women to go
[00:41:36] Unknown Guest: like kind of do this thing for money.
[00:41:38] Unknown Guest: And this is just the like premium.
[00:41:40] Unknown Guest: Why sell makeup and candles when you could have a downline
[00:41:45] Unknown Guest: generating you know $100,000 a pop, right?
[00:41:47] Unknown Guest: Like they said it's a premium MLM.
[00:41:50] Man, I feel it's so crazy.
[00:41:51] Sam Parr: I've got so many friends doing this.
[00:41:53] Sam Parr: When I was a little kid like or in my earlier 20s,
[00:41:56] Sam Parr: like the only thing I knew about surrogacy was
[00:41:58] Sam Parr: that Amy pull her movie where she you know,
[00:42:00] Sam Parr: she's like the surrogate.
[00:42:02] Sam Parr: She's the surrogate for Tina Fey and she like eats big Macs
[00:42:05] Sam Parr: and it's like can we change her to be healthy?
[00:42:07] Sam Parr: And like that was like that was the just the movie.
[00:42:11] Sam Parr: But I didn't know anything about this.
[00:42:12] Sam Parr: And now I think I probably know five or six or seven friends
[00:42:16] Sam Parr: that have done it this way.
[00:42:17] Sam Parr: It's a pretty wild experience.
[00:42:19] Sam Parr: It's also like science is amazing.
[00:42:21] Sam Parr: It's one of these things that I learned about this
[00:42:22] Sam Parr: and I'm like this is just absolutely insane.
[00:42:23] Sam Parr: I can't believe this exists.
[00:42:25] Sam Parr: So Shil, if you said there's 10,000 surrogate birds
[00:42:28] Unknown Guest: a year roughly, you think that's ballpark, right?
[00:42:30] Unknown Guest: Yeah, it's growing fast.
[00:42:31] Shaan Puri: I think it's growing like 10% a year,
[00:42:33] Shaan Puri: but let's just say 10,000.
[00:42:34] Shaan Puri: So if it was 100,000 average spend per surrogate surrogacy,
[00:42:39] Unknown Guest: that's a billion dollars a year
[00:42:41] Unknown Guest: of sort of revenue generated across all the different agencies today.
[00:42:46] But yeah, but note that most of that goes to the surrogate.
[00:42:50] Unknown Guest: So, right, you know, what if you,
[00:42:52] Unknown Guest: you're a venture investor, right?
[00:42:54] Unknown Guest: Like how do you describe to somebody who's not a VC,
[00:42:59] the appeal of the sort of niche, weird marketplace
[00:43:03] Unknown Guest: that behavior that seems a little fringe today,
[00:43:06] Unknown Guest: but oh my God, wait, people spend how much money
[00:43:09] Unknown Guest: watching people break open Pokemon card decks
[00:43:12] Unknown Guest: and whatnot is a $12 billion company now
[00:43:15] Unknown Guest: watching people open Pokemon card packs live on the internet.
[00:43:18] Unknown Guest: What do you mean?
[00:43:19] Unknown Guest: There's an appeal to this.
[00:43:20] Unknown Guest: How do you describe that phenomenon
[00:43:22] Unknown Guest: and where the, in the upside of the sort of the fringe?
[00:43:26] Unknown Guest: Yeah, so I think what not's a great one
[00:43:29] Shaan Puri: because it started out as a collectible marketplace
[00:43:32] Shaan Puri: for funco pop toys.
[00:43:34] Shaan Puri: And if you told me that a collectible marketplace
[00:43:36] Shaan Puri: for funco pop toys would five years later be worth,
[00:43:39] Shaan Puri: I think it's like $12 billion or something,
[00:43:41] Shaan Puri: I would say you're crazy,
[00:43:43] Shaan Puri: but you start somewhere and like you dominate that niche.
[00:43:47] Shaan Puri: I think in this case, I don't think it's a venture opportunity.
[00:43:50] Shaan Puri: And I also think venture capital incentivizes growth
[00:43:54] Shaan Puri: and that might incentivize the wrong thing in this space.
[00:43:58] Shaan Puri: So I probably wouldn't want it to be venture opportunity,
[00:44:00] Shaan Puri: but I think it is a good opportunity
[00:44:02] Shaan Puri: for somebody to build a business.
[00:44:04] Can I ask you about one more thing you have here?
[00:44:06] Sam Parr: Because this is on the long list of things
[00:44:08] Sam Parr: I thought were so stupid when I first heard about this
[00:44:10] Sam Parr: and people seemed to love it and it's, you know,
[00:44:12] Sam Parr: what do I know?
[00:44:13] Sam Parr: Sean, have you heard of EMS?
[00:44:14] Sam Parr: Is that like ambulance?
[00:44:17] Unknown Guest: Is that what EMS is?
[00:44:19] Unknown Guest: That's another EMS.
[00:44:21] Shaan Puri: Electronic muscle stimulation.
[00:44:23] Shaan Puri: Okay, tell me about it.
[00:44:24] Unknown Guest: Is this like the thing where you get six bag abs
[00:44:26] Unknown Guest: by putting the electrode on your thing and you watch TV?
[00:44:29] Yes.
[00:44:30] So, okay.
[00:44:32] Here's the thing.
[00:44:34] Shaan Puri: So you got to try it, first of all,
[00:44:36] Shaan Puri: but one of my best friends in the world,
[00:44:40] Shaan Puri: you're not a rather take drugs.
[00:44:42] Yeah, okay, fair.
[00:44:44] Shaan Puri: So one of my best friends in the world,
[00:44:47] Shaan Puri: completely and utterly jacked and he was not five years ago
[00:44:52] Shaan Puri: and he does not really work out.
[00:44:55] Shaan Puri: He does EMS.
[00:44:57] Shaan Puri: So what it is is he has this little machine
[00:44:59] Shaan Puri: and he bought for $35 on Amazon.
[00:45:02] Shaan Puri: Look for tens T E N S and EMS.
[00:45:05] Shaan Puri: Oh, we have one of those.
[00:45:06] Shaan Puri: That's for like during contractions,
[00:45:07] Shaan Puri: my wife used the tens machine.
[00:45:09] Unknown Guest: Yeah.
[00:45:10] Shaan Puri: So he puts those all over his body
[00:45:14] Shaan Puri: and he like jacks it up.
[00:45:16] Shaan Puri: I hate the feeling of it, so I don't do it.
[00:45:19] Shaan Puri: But I have seen it work for him so well that this is something.
[00:45:24] Shaan Puri: And so recently I was in New York a couple of weeks ago
[00:45:27] Shaan Puri: and I went to a workout facility
[00:45:29] Shaan Puri: where they have it set up like on a thing that you wear.
[00:45:33] Shaan Puri: And part of the problem is it needs direct skin contact.
[00:45:36] Shaan Puri: So it's annoying to put on and off.
[00:45:39] Shaan Puri: If it was easier to put on and off,
[00:45:41] Shaan Puri: I would be doing this thing.
[00:45:42] Shaan Puri: But I went to a facility where they had this thing
[00:45:45] Shaan Puri: and they like you put a shirt on
[00:45:47] Shaan Puri: that has these electrodes on it and they spray water on it.
[00:45:50] Shaan Puri: So it makes it touches your skin basically.
[00:45:54] Shaan Puri: And it's an amazing workout.
[00:45:56] Shaan Puri: Like it was one of my favorite workouts ever
[00:45:58] Shaan Puri: and it was 15 minutes.
[00:46:00] Shaan Puri: I know it sounds like total bullshit.
[00:46:02] Shaan Puri: Wait, so with this one you do workout while it's happening.
[00:46:06] Shaan Puri: You do a little bit of a workout
[00:46:07] Shaan Puri: but it's working you out a lot more
[00:46:10] Shaan Puri: because of this stimulation in your body.
[00:46:13] Shaan Puri: Wait, wait, so let's go to the case study of your friend.
[00:46:15] Unknown Guest: Your friend five years ago, not Jack.
[00:46:17] Unknown Guest: Tell me his name.
[00:46:18] Sam Parr: I'm gonna go to his name.
[00:46:19] Sam Parr: His name's Umress.
[00:46:20] Unknown Guest: He's gonna love this.
[00:46:22] Okay, so Sam pull up a picture.
[00:46:24] Unknown Guest: Are you gonna pick, let's get a screen share.
[00:46:25] Unknown Guest: Yeah, let's get a shirt.
[00:46:26] Unknown Guest: Do we got a shirt?
[00:46:27] Unknown Guest: Yeah, we need a shirt.
[00:46:28] Unknown Guest: I can send you guys a pick.
[00:46:30] Unknown Guest: I thought he's Jack now and you're saying
[00:46:33] Unknown Guest: that the in between there wasn't like a crossfit phase
[00:46:36] Unknown Guest: and then this, it was really just this
[00:46:39] Unknown Guest: over a period of time plus diet, I assume.
[00:46:42] Shaan Puri: Not much changes diet, he's diabetic
[00:46:44] Shaan Puri: so he's kind of limited in what he can eat.
[00:46:46] Shaan Puri: He hasn't changed his diet
[00:46:48] Shaan Puri: but he attributes it all to this.
[00:46:52] Shaan Puri: So okay, so where's the opportunity?
[00:46:54] Shaan Puri: I think so this gym thing that I did in New York,
[00:46:58] Shaan Puri: it was amazing and I looked for one here
[00:46:59] Shaan Puri: in San Francisco, I couldn't find one in a cursory search
[00:47:04] Shaan Puri: but I think you basically build a berries of the MS
[00:47:07] Shaan Puri: where like you have a workout routine
[00:47:10] Shaan Puri: and it's really fun and there's a class
[00:47:12] Shaan Puri: and people put on this thing and they're used to it
[00:47:14] Shaan Puri: and they get jacked and people see them getting jacked.
[00:47:17] Shaan Puri: And I think the way you do it is like you start with somebody
[00:47:20] Shaan Puri: like me who's like not in great shape a little flubby
[00:47:24] Shaan Puri: and then I go through this and like you show the evolution
[00:47:28] Shaan Puri: and then people are into it and people like I gotta try this.
[00:47:31] Shaan Puri: Yeah, this has the viral factor of being weird, right?
[00:47:34] Unknown Guest: Like of people hating on it, right?
[00:47:36] Unknown Guest: Like if I posted this and I was like this is all you need,
[00:47:39] Unknown Guest: you're gonna get all the comments about like dude,
[00:47:41] Unknown Guest: just do it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:47:43] Unknown Guest: and so it's gonna go viral because it's gonna be hated
[00:47:46] Unknown Guest: and loved at the same time, which is what you need.
[00:47:49] Unknown Guest: Yeah, so the problem with the $35 product,
[00:47:51] Shaan Puri: so he bought it for me and the problem is you have to like
[00:47:55] Shaan Puri: do these sticky things, you have to put on your body
[00:47:58] Shaan Puri: and it just like takes time.
[00:48:00] Shaan Puri: What he does is his primary workout is he flies a lot for work
[00:48:06] Shaan Puri: and when he's on the plane, he's doing it the whole time
[00:48:09] Shaan Puri: and that says primary workout.
[00:48:10] Shaan Puri: Yeah.
[00:48:12] Did you put this through the X-ray machine
[00:48:14] Unknown Guest: and like what the,
[00:48:15] it's a little thing, it's like a size of a phone, it's nothing.
[00:48:19] Shaan Puri: Oh, but so this thing you linked, this catalyst thing,
[00:48:23] Unknown Guest: this is the full body suit, you go there and you exercise
[00:48:26] Unknown Guest: or what is this?
[00:48:27] Unknown Guest: Yeah, that's the full body suit that's basically
[00:48:30] Shaan Puri: this but already in a suit form.
[00:48:33] Shaan Puri: All right, I think I may have to try this.
[00:48:34] Unknown Guest: Sam, what do you think?
[00:48:35] Unknown Guest: As an actual fit person, what do you think of this?
[00:48:38] Unknown Guest: So you may not be the market actually.
[00:48:40] Unknown Guest: I love shortcuts, so like, you know,
[00:48:42] Sam Parr: we, like if, I think we had someone in the positive,
[00:48:45] Sam Parr: they're like, why don't get why people hate
[00:48:47] Sam Parr: on get rich quick schemes?
[00:48:48] Sam Parr: Getting rich quick is the best way to get rich.
[00:48:51] Sam Parr: So like if I can get like more fit without doing anything,
[00:48:55] Sam Parr: I'm on board.
[00:48:56] Sam Parr: Is there actually data that backs us up?
[00:48:59] Sam Parr: I think it's pretty lame, but if I can,
[00:49:01] Sam Parr: I got the story about his friend.
[00:49:02] Unknown Guest: Yeah, no, it's a good.
[00:49:04] Shaan Puri: I'm a good, so I think there is data on catalyst.
[00:49:10] Shaan Puri: People use it.
[00:49:11] Shaan Puri: I think the question is whether these $35 machines work
[00:49:14] Shaan Puri: and I only have my one friend as a data point.
[00:49:18] Shaan Puri: And the funny thing is like, we've all seen it work for him.
[00:49:22] Shaan Puri: And yet none of us others in the friend group have done it.
[00:49:26] Shaan Puri: And the reason for that is it's annoying,
[00:49:28] Shaan Puri: like to put these things on and it's painful.
[00:49:32] Shaan Puri: And he's willing to, like every plane ride,
[00:49:34] Shaan Puri: he's willing to just do it the whole plane ride.
[00:49:37] Shaan Puri: And I'm not, but when I did this work out,
[00:49:39] Shaan Puri: he took me to the workout class in New York two weeks ago.
[00:49:42] Shaan Puri: And when I went to that workout class,
[00:49:43] Shaan Puri: I was like, this is actually really fun.
[00:49:45] Shaan Puri: And I know I'm getting a great workout.
[00:49:48] Shaan Puri: You feel the next couple of days,
[00:49:49] Shaan Puri: it was like the good kind of hurt after a great workout.
[00:49:52] Shaan Puri: So I was like, I know this is working,
[00:49:54] Shaan Puri: but how come I haven't heard more about this?
[00:49:56] Shaan Puri: So I think there's an opportunity in building a product
[00:49:59] Shaan Puri: and this like berry style workout
[00:50:02] Shaan Puri: where like you teach people how to do it.
[00:50:04] Shaan Puri: Do this looks pretty sick.
[00:50:06] Sam Parr: The vests like look like a like armor, like body armor.
[00:50:09] Sam Parr: Like you look like a Navy SEAL.
[00:50:10] Sam Parr: Yeah, except for, I don't know what this tank is here.
[00:50:13] Unknown Guest: That's a little bit suspicious.
[00:50:14] Unknown Guest: I don't really fully understand what all the pieces are,
[00:50:17] Unknown Guest: but dude, if people are buying $6,000,
[00:50:21] Unknown Guest: $6,000 cold plunges at their home
[00:50:24] Unknown Guest: and you know, five to $10,000 sonas at their home
[00:50:27] Unknown Guest: and red light therapy,
[00:50:29] Unknown Guest: like my brother-in-law's got a red light therapy bed
[00:50:31] Unknown Guest: in his house and his kids are doing it
[00:50:32] Unknown Guest: because it's like good for their sports,
[00:50:34] Unknown Guest: whatever recovery, whatever this is.
[00:50:37] Unknown Guest: Like there's really no end to the kind of wellness,
[00:50:40] Unknown Guest: you know, rabbit hole, right?
[00:50:41] Unknown Guest: And there's always people who are gonna look for the next edge.
[00:50:44] Unknown Guest: It's not too dissimilar to a reformer's machine
[00:50:46] Unknown Guest: in a Pilates class, right?
[00:50:48] Unknown Guest: Like it's a tool that gets you more leverage
[00:50:51] Unknown Guest: on, you know, your hour of exercise.
[00:50:54] Unknown Guest: Although this makes me want to make fun of it,
[00:50:55] Unknown Guest: it also makes me want to secretly do it.
[00:50:58] These guys, I actually was looking up.
[00:50:59] Sam Parr: These guys, I think they emailed me this catalyst guys
[00:51:02] Sam Parr: asking if I wanted to test this out
[00:51:04] Sam Parr: and I don't know if I replied, but if they're listening to this.
[00:51:06] Sam Parr: Wanting you to be an influencer?
[00:51:07] Unknown Guest: Was this during the same fitness influencer era?
[00:51:09] Unknown Guest: It could have been.
[00:51:10] Unknown Guest: That was a great era.
[00:51:11] Unknown Guest: I think I actually would.
[00:51:12] Sam Parr: It's literally dozens of people.
[00:51:14] Sam Parr: And count as an era though.
[00:51:16] Unknown Guest: Well, you know, it's a season.
[00:51:20] Sam Parr: That was the transition to the dad influence
[00:51:23] Unknown Guest: or pretty quickly and the content shifted.
[00:51:26] Unknown Guest: Once I became a kid, I wanted to quit posting shirtless photos online,
[00:51:30] Sam Parr: but just so you know, it's still there.
[00:51:31] Sam Parr: It don't go away.
[00:51:32] Sam Parr: It's still there.
[00:51:33] Sam Parr: And so catalyst, I'll totally try this thing.
[00:51:35] Sam Parr: Yeah, this looks cool.
[00:51:36] Sam Parr: I like to make fun of these things, but suit me up, baby.
[00:51:39] Sam Parr: There's an announcement on their site of like,
[00:51:41] Unknown Guest: hey, I know a lot of you had had a very, very bad experience,
[00:51:43] Unknown Guest: but there's a new owner and we're going to do it right this time.
[00:51:46] Unknown Guest: So maybe it's been a little bumpy road.
[00:51:48] Unknown Guest: Yeah, I'm in a bunch of like these longevity groups
[00:51:52] Shaan Puri: in San Francisco and WhatsApp and people are people
[00:51:56] Shaan Puri: who are like trying to buy the company.
[00:51:58] Sam Parr: Can you, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:51:59] Sam Parr: That's actually, okay, you just gave me a beautiful opening.
[00:52:02] Sam Parr: You're in SF, you're kind of run around like a bunch of like rich people,
[00:52:06] Sam Parr: weirdo, successful people.
[00:52:07] Sam Parr: Like this really cool combination of people.
[00:52:09] Sam Parr: What are the kids into?
[00:52:10] Sam Parr: Like a, like this longevity stuff.
[00:52:12] Sam Parr: What else is interesting to them?
[00:52:14] Sam Parr: What like, you know, I don't live in San Francisco anymore.
[00:52:16] Sam Parr: Sean lives a little bit outside of SF now.
[00:52:19] Sam Parr: Before when we were there, it was the best place to see what's going to happen
[00:52:22] Sam Parr: in the handful of years because there's always weirdos doing cool stuff,
[00:52:24] Sam Parr: like sharing their couch on a website and now Airbnb's,
[00:52:27] Sam Parr: I think, or sharing the car.
[00:52:29] Sam Parr: What are some other interesting stuff that the oddballs are into?
[00:52:33] Sam Parr: Yeah, I think there's, so I think we talked about a lot of them.
[00:52:36] Shaan Puri: Pep Tides, nobody's drinking.
[00:52:39] Shaan Puri: You know, I think this Brian Johnson has done wonders for a lot of folks
[00:52:43] Shaan Puri: in just changing how they think about life.
[00:52:45] Shaan Puri: Not necessarily all good.
[00:52:47] Shaan Puri: Like, I don't think drinking is absolutely terrible,
[00:52:49] Shaan Puri: but I think probably people should drink less than they do.
[00:52:52] Shaan Puri: One interesting one that I did not, like a new business,
[00:52:56] Shaan Puri: like as crazy as Airbnb and Uber were,
[00:53:01] Shaan Puri: I think prediction marketplaces are a good one.
[00:53:04] Shaan Puri: It's obviously not just the San Francisco thing,
[00:53:07] Shaan Puri: but it's the kind of business that like,
[00:53:09] Shaan Puri: I probably would not have funded when these companies got funded.
[00:53:11] Shaan Puri: I would say like, this is never going to work.
[00:53:13] Shaan Puri: It's going to be highly illegal.
[00:53:15] Shaan Puri: But the fact that you can...
[00:53:16] Shaan Puri: What's the difference between a prediction market and...
[00:53:19] Sam Parr: So prediction market, does that just mean like guessing who's going to win president
[00:53:23] Sam Parr: or who's going to win the mayor?
[00:53:24] Sam Parr: Yeah, so one of my pushbacks was initially was,
[00:53:28] Shaan Puri: it's only going to be used for elections,
[00:53:30] Shaan Puri: because that's obviously something that everybody is thinking about
[00:53:34] Shaan Puri: and wants to bet on.
[00:53:36] Shaan Puri: But actually they use it for so many other things too.
[00:53:39] Shaan Puri: Their political outcomes all the times,
[00:53:41] Shaan Puri: people are using it, it's basically like a proxy for sports betting.
[00:53:44] Shaan Puri: You can do all sorts of secondary derivative products
[00:53:47] Shaan Puri: on top of equity investing.
[00:53:49] Shaan Puri: They're markets for everything.
[00:53:51] Shaan Puri: I think there are a lot of questions in my mind about why it's legal
[00:53:57] Shaan Puri: and can you influence the outcome of something that you're betting on?
[00:54:02] If there's a marketplace on whether...
[00:54:05] Shaan Puri: How many companies BTV would invest in the next year?
[00:54:08] Shaan Puri: I'd be betting on that while participating as well.
[00:54:12] Shaan Puri: But I think there's no question that there's a huge opportunity in this space.
[00:54:16] Shaan Puri: Did you see the coin-based earnings call thing?
[00:54:18] Unknown Guest: Yeah, that was fucking hilarious.
[00:54:20] Unknown Guest: What happened? Did you see this?
[00:54:22] Unknown Guest: So there was a prediction market on polymarket for the coin-based earnings calls.
[00:54:28] Unknown Guest: The Q3 earnings call will Brian Armstrong say any of these words
[00:54:33] Unknown Guest: or how many times he'll say these words?
[00:54:34] Unknown Guest: Oh my gosh.
[00:54:36] And then at the very end of the call...
[00:54:37] Unknown Guest: How much volume?
[00:54:39] I think it was probably...
[00:54:41] Unknown Guest: It was low.
[00:54:42] Unknown Guest: It was single digit thousands.
[00:54:43] Unknown Guest: It was like a very small thing, but his team passed him a note and he goes,
[00:54:46] Unknown Guest: oh, before we hang up here, I just would like to say
[00:54:49] Unknown Guest: Web3, crypto, blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, thank you very much.
[00:54:53] Unknown Guest: And he just basically...
[00:54:54] Unknown Guest: He's like, you know, just for all the prediction markets out there,
[00:54:56] Unknown Guest: you know, here we go.
[00:54:57] Unknown Guest: And he just hit all the words.
[00:54:58] Unknown Guest: He just said seven words and then laughed and then basically they hung up the call.
[00:55:02] Unknown Guest: And I thought that was so funny.
[00:55:05] But of course, it's not that funny when like...
[00:55:07] Unknown Guest: It's real.
[00:55:08] Unknown Guest: ...there's all these sports things going on right now where...
[00:55:10] Unknown Guest: Dude, in the UFC, like in the UFC, if you're like a nobody UFC guy,
[00:55:13] Sam Parr: you get like 25 grand for fighting.
[00:55:15] Sam Parr: And they're like flagged a bunch of...
[00:55:18] Sam Parr: They flagged a bunch of fights where they're like,
[00:55:20] Sam Parr: this is very suspicious because there was like, you know, 80 grand in the line
[00:55:23] Sam Parr: for a fight that the guy would only earn $25,000.
[00:55:26] Sam Parr: And they're being investigated.
[00:55:27] Sam Parr: So yeah, there's gonna be a lot of downsides.
[00:55:29] Sam Parr: But so like the average tech nerd...
[00:55:31] Sam Parr: Like when I was in San Francisco, it was like a joke.
[00:55:33] Sam Parr: Like there's like the giants play here.
[00:55:34] Sam Parr: Where were the giants?
[00:55:35] Sam Parr: Like no one knew about like, you know, like, what's it like, particularly popular?
[00:55:39] Sam Parr: I know Sean was in the basketball, but like basketball or any sport.
[00:55:42] Sam Parr: Wasn't particularly like, you know, that popular.
[00:55:46] Sam Parr: Are the young tech guys caring about gambling for sports?
[00:55:50] Sam Parr: Or is it all other stuff?
[00:55:51] Sam Parr: It's a lot of other stuff.
[00:55:52] Shaan Puri: I think sports is interesting.
[00:55:54] Shaan Puri: And I think we'll be one of the key markets in the prediction space.
[00:55:58] Shaan Puri: But I think there are also other things.
[00:56:00] Shaan Puri: Like gambling on or, you know, predicting equity outcomes are interesting too.
[00:56:08] Shaan Puri: I look to those things all the time.
[00:56:10] Shaan Puri: I'm just curious.
[00:56:11] Shaan Puri: And it's also uncanny how right they are and how ahead of the curve they are in some of these things.
[00:56:17] Shaan Puri: Can I ask you about one more thing?
[00:56:18] Sam Parr: Yeah.
[00:56:19] Sam Parr: You made a very interesting statement.
[00:56:21] Sam Parr: We said, what are three strong opinions that you have for life?
[00:56:24] Sam Parr: And your number one opinion is I think books are a waste of time.
[00:56:30] Shaan Puri: For me, I think books are a waste of time.
[00:56:33] Shaan Puri: So I haven't, this is, I haven't read a book in like 15 years.
[00:56:38] Shaan Puri: And I think it's very, very contrary and opinion.
[00:56:43] Shaan Puri: But I think like, I have so many friends that are authors that I talk to that are just like
[00:56:48] Shaan Puri: trying to get the words out.
[00:56:50] Shaan Puri: But if you like, listen to a podcast, it's like one podcast by that author is at least 80%
[00:56:58] Shaan Puri: of the value of the book.
[00:57:00] Shaan Puri: And so is it worth spending another five hours reading to get the additional 20% in my mind?
[00:57:06] Shaan Puri: No.
[00:57:07] Shaan Puri: So that's my, that's my provocative statement.
[00:57:09] Shaan Puri: It is the first thing I do when there's a book I'm interested in.
[00:57:12] Unknown Guest: I go to YouTube and I just look for a talk by the author.
[00:57:15] Unknown Guest: And if they're not interesting in the first 15 minutes of that YouTube video,
[00:57:19] Unknown Guest: the book is definitely not going to be interesting.
[00:57:20] Unknown Guest: The book will probably have more, you know, it's not going to be fully sufficient.
[00:57:24] Unknown Guest: But if you can't do, if you can't give a good talk, you probably don't have a good book.
[00:57:28] Let me give a different opinion that's related.
[00:57:30] Sam Parr: So I read a lot like in terms of quantity.
[00:57:33] Sam Parr: And I was rereading a book that I read when I was younger.
[00:57:37] Sam Parr: I think it was like Robert Chao-Dini's influence, you know, it's all about persuasion.
[00:57:42] Sam Parr: And I was like, I've read all these other books on business and whatever.
[00:57:45] Sam Parr: I should have just reread this same book every six or three months and not read any other book
[00:57:50] Sam Parr: on this topic. And I would have been significantly further ahead.
[00:57:54] Sam Parr: And so my opinion that I'm telling young people when it comes to reading, I'm like,
[00:57:57] Sam Parr: pick like the two or three like classics or the grades of it and master it.
[00:58:00] Sam Parr: Know it word for word and master it and don't read a lot.
[00:58:04] Sam Parr: Just read the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:58:06] Sam Parr: If you want to read for fun, read for fun.
[00:58:08] Sam Parr: But just do the same thing over and over again for your educational box.
[00:58:13] What were the other three?
[00:58:14] Shaan Puri: You said you had three.
[00:58:16] Shaan Puri: I think I had two.
[00:58:17] Shaan Puri: The other one was just reached out to the owner.
[00:58:19] Shaan Puri: So this is lately a few things have happened.
[00:58:21] Shaan Puri: Like I'm booking.
[00:58:23] Shaan Puri: It's my wife's 40th birthday and we booked a trip for like 40 of her friends.
[00:58:29] Shaan Puri: And I was having some trouble with the cruise.
[00:58:33] Shaan Puri: It's a virgin voyages.
[00:58:36] Shaan Puri: And I was having some trouble.
[00:58:38] Shaan Puri: So I just reached out to the CEO.
[00:58:40] Shaan Puri: I just found the CEO's email and I reached out to him and I was like, hey,
[00:58:44] you know, if I were you, I would want to know troubles.
[00:58:48] Shaan Puri: Like you're a smart guy.
[00:58:49] Shaan Puri: You want to build a great brand.
[00:58:51] Shaan Puri: I've had an experience with you with your brand that was not great.
[00:58:54] Shaan Puri: Let me tell you about it.
[00:58:56] Shaan Puri: He responded so favorably.
[00:58:58] Shaan Puri: He was like, thank you so much for telling me.
[00:59:00] Shaan Puri: Here's what I'm doing about it.
[00:59:03] It just made me realize that I should be doing that more often.
[00:59:05] Shaan Puri: So actually we did that recently with our fertility clinic.
[00:59:07] Shaan Puri: Same thing like how to bad experience.
[00:59:09] Shaan Puri: I reached out to the guy who founded the clinic.
[00:59:12] Shaan Puri: And you know, obviously you shouldn't do it for everything.
[00:59:16] Shaan Puri: But in some cases, these people want you to have a great experience with their brand.
[00:59:22] And they don't often know until things get like until you write a bad review.
[00:59:27] Shaan Puri: They don't know.
[00:59:28] Shaan Puri: So it's just important to let them know earlier on.
[00:59:30] Shaan Puri: It doesn't have to be the owner, but in my case, it was.
[00:59:33] Shaan Puri: What did and did you get a discount?
[00:59:36] Shaan Puri: I didn't get a discount, but I got like really like white glove service where they're like
[00:59:42] Shaan Puri: everything I want they respond immediately.
[00:59:44] Shaan Puri: And I'm not trying to be a dick about it and like get something that I don't deserve, but it
[00:59:49] Shaan Puri: worked out quite well.
[00:59:50] Shaan Puri: Right.
[00:59:50] Shaan Puri: What do you wouldn't say no to make it right either?
[00:59:52] Shaan Puri: Yes, exactly.
[00:59:54] Shaan Puri: You want to give me a discount.
[00:59:55] Shaan Puri: I'll take it.
[00:59:56] Shaan Puri: Okay.
[00:59:58] Cecilia, great man.
[00:59:59] Unknown Guest: Thanks for coming on.
