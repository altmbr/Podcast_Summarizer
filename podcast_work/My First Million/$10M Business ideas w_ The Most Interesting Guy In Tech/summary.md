# Podcast Summary: Sheel Mohnot on My First Million

## 1. Key Themes

### The Hidden Infrastructure of Surrogacy as a Growing Market Opportunity

Surrogacy is experiencing 10% annual growth and costs $150-200K per birth, with approximately 5,000-10,000 surrogate births annually in the US. The current market operates through fragmented agencies that only match intended parents with surrogates in their own network, creating an inefficient marketplace. Sheel identifies a significant opportunity to create a centralized matching platform similar to eHarmony, though he cautions against venture capital involvement due to misaligned incentives around growth. "Imagine if you were buying a home and your real estate agent could only show you homes that they had listed. That's kind of what it is today." [[00:36:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=36m29s) The surrogate typically receives $75,000 of the total cost, with agencies, medical fees, legal fees, and insurance making up the remainder.

### AI Voice as the Unlock for Service Business Automation

AI voice technology has reached an inflection point where it can credibly handle customer service for contractors and service businesses. Sheel's key insight: "If Bill Ackman's fooled by this video, then like a lot of people are fooled by AI voice. So already the service providers should be having AI voice do the work for them." [[00:20:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=20m41s) The opportunity isn't just cost savings—it's about response time being the critical conversion factor. Speed of response is the primary determinant of winning service jobs, and AI enables 24/7 instant response, which human office managers cannot match.

### Crony Capitalism as a Legitimate Business Strategy in 2025

Multiple founders are now explicitly pitching their political connections as a core business advantage. Sheel describes a peptide company pitch where "he basically pulls up a picture of the co-founder with Trump and Kennedy. He's like, yeah, we're pretty sure we're going to be able to get some things through." [[00:30:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=30m22s) This represents a fundamental shift in startup pitching—political access has moved from implicit advantage to explicit slide-13-of-the-deck material. While Sheel expresses some discomfort ("it's kind of sad, honestly"), he acknowledges this is simply the reality of the current environment.

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### 50-Year Mortgages Are Demand-Side Manipulation That Will Backfire

Trump's proposal for 50-year mortgages mirrors Japan's 1980s housing bubble strategy, which ended catastrophically. Sheel explains: "Japan did this in the 80s. They had a bunch of problems like interest rates were zero. And asset prices went through the roof. At one point, a single property in Tokyo was worth more than all of the real estate in California." [[00:06:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=5m50s) The fundamental flaw: extending payment terms doesn't reduce the actual cost—it just frontloads more interest while preventing equity accumulation. In a 50-year mortgage, homeowners who stay the average 6.5 years will build almost no equity. The solution isn't inducing more demand; it's increasing supply through permitting reform and cheaper construction methods.

### Books Are Inefficient Information Delivery Mechanisms

Sheel hasn't read a book in 15 years, arguing that "if you listen to a podcast, it's like one podcast by that author is at least 80% of the value of the book. And so is it worth spending another five hours reading to get the additional 20%? In my mind? No." [[00:56:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=56m48s) This challenges the conventional wisdom that books provide deeper knowledge than other media. Sam Parr adds a complementary insight: repeatedly reading the same few masterworks (like Cialdini's Influence) would produce better results than reading hundreds of business books once.

### EMS Training May Be the Legitimate Shortcut Everyone Dismissed

Electric Muscle Stimulation has been dismissed as infomercial nonsense, but Sheel presents a compelling case study: "one of my best friends in the world, completely and utterly jacked and he was not five years ago and he does not really work out. He does EMS." [[00:44:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=44m45s) His friend uses a $35 tens machine during plane flights as his primary workout. While this sounds absurd, Sheel tried a professional EMS facility (Catalyst) and found it delivered an exceptional 15-minute workout. The technology may have been legitimized by improvements in the equipment and methodology, similar to how cryotherapy went from fringe to mainstream.

## 3. Companies Identified

### DeepLawn
**Description:** AI-powered quoting software for lawn care companies  
**Why Mentioned:** Exemplifies how satellite imagery and AI can automate the quoting process for service businesses  
**Quote:** "All they do is they help lawn companies quote. And so the lawn company you put in the address, it looks at satellite imagery, uses some AI to determine how much grass you have, comes up with a square footage. It knows what you charge. It instantly gives them a quote. And they charge like a couple dollars per quote." [[00:13:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=13m3s)

### Roofr (roofer.com)
**Description:** Drone and imagery-based roofing quote automation  
**Why Mentioned:** Demonstrates the successful application of automated quoting in the roofing vertical  
**Quote:** Ben told Sam about this business that's "doing the same thing. It's just the quote part...The drone to fly by, it would auto do the quote for you. So you would have a way faster quote, which increases your odds of getting the job." [[00:13:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=13m44s)

### Hone (formerly Peak Health)
**Description:** Telemedicine company for TRT and hormone therapy  
**Why Mentioned:** Successfully legitimized and scaled the testosterone replacement therapy market with better branding and distribution  
**Quote:** Sam and Shaan invested in this company that "originally called peak, peak health or something like that...they were originally just TRT. Now they do everything and we get them monthly updates and this is like the chart is like you want the chart to look this way." [[00:28:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=28m48s)

**Why Mentioned:** Represents the productization of electric muscle stimulation technology into a Barry's-style fitness class format  
**Quote:** "I went to a facility where they had this thing and they like you put a shirt on that has these electrodes on it and they spray water on it...And it's an amazing workout. Like it was one of my favorite workouts ever and it was 15 minutes." [[00:45:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=45m40s)

**Quote:** "Roger was like previously like, I think he started Zinga or something like that. He founded Mafia Wars, which was part of Zinga...then he left to start made.com, which was basically like a, you know how like the best barbers you go and you sit down in the chair and they're like, what do you want?...the great barbers are like, there's option one, option two, option three, option four." [[00:15:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=15m28s)

## 5. Operating Insights

### Speed of Response Trumps Quality of Response in Service Business Sales

The first contractor to respond to a homeowner inquiry has a disproportionate advantage in winning the job, regardless of quality or price. Sheel describes his backyard remodeling experience: "I was having some trouble with the cruise...So I just reached out to the CEO...if I were you, I would want to know troubles...I've had an experience with you with your brand that was not great. Let me tell you about it. He responded so favorably." [[00:58:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=58m34s) The operating principle: optimize for response time as the primary KPI. Alex Hormozi's sales funnel exemplifies this—Sam describes booking a call and "as I clicked like confirm calendar, I get a phone call from a guy. And it's his name Xavier. And I'm like Xavier. He's like, Hey Sam, what's up? I just saw you book to college when you're like confirming a couple of details with you." [[00:22:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=22m2s)

### Reaching Out to Owners Directly Bypasses Broken Customer Service

Rather than fighting through customer service, Sheel advocates going straight to founders/CEOs for significant issues. His approach: frame it as helping them improve their business, not complaining. "I reached out to the CEO. I just found the CEO's email and I reached out to him and I was like, hey, you know, if I were you, I would want to know troubles. Like you're a smart guy. You want to build a great brand." [[00:58:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=58m34s) This isn't about being entitled—it's recognizing that founders genuinely want to know about problems and have the authority to fix them immediately, while frontline staff often cannot.

### The Marketplace Expansion Blueprint: Start Narrow, Then Apply Pattern

Sheel identifies the repeatable pattern for service business automation: "I think you could do the same thing for like pools, decks, pergolas, like playgrounds, fences, outdoor kitchens, like all this kind of stuff would be fairly easy to do. So you could build, you could build this in one niche and then go into all the others." [[00:15:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=15m2s) Start with one vertical (roofing or lawns), prove the model works, then systematically expand to adjacent categories using the same infrastructure and approach.

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The Peptide Information Gap Represents a Trust Arbitrage Opportunity

ChatGPT and mainstream sources refuse to provide information about peptides due to their unclear legal status, creating an information vacuum. Sheel notes: "I've been searching and chat GBT will not answer me a bunch of questions I have because it says peptides are not medically cleared. Like we can't answer this question. So like, one of my main sources of information is God." [[00:52:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=52m8s) This creates an unusual opportunity: become the trusted information source before the regulatory environment clarifies. The parallel to the early crypto space is clear—position as the "Coinbase" of peptides by doing things correctly from the start, while everyone else operates in the gray market. This is especially relevant given RFK Jr.'s position in government.

### Surrogacy Matching Inefficiency Signals Broader Fertility Tech Disruption

The surrogacy matching problem reveals something deeper: fertility services operate like real estate did before the MLS. Each agency's inventory silo prevents optimal matching on dozens of dimensions that matter deeply to intended parents (diet, abortion stance, relationship preference, etc.). Sheel observes: "there are a bunch of things that we care about. There's a bunch of things that she cares about. We ultimately found a great match and she's wonderful, we love her." [[00:37:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDjs_Wem9zI&t=37m13s) The broader insight: high-stakes, emotionally-charged services with complex matching requirements and fragmented providers are ripe for platform disruption, even when venture capital may not be appropriate due to the need for measured growth over hyper-scaling.
