[00:00:00] The highest returns on capital we get as entrepreneurs is talent.
[00:00:03] Like, full stop.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_01: Where else do you get 10X, 20X, 100X returns so reliably?
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_01: If I'm thinking from the like, I really have to fill this role angle.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_01: It's like, usually not the right person.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_01: If I'm thinking like, how do you even care if I have a role for this person?
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_01: I have to get them in.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_01: It's usually the right person.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_01: Once you get to like, 5 million in revenue, that's what you have to become.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: It's a collector of people.
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_00: It's pattern recognition, especially when it comes to talent.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_01: You have to grow fast.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_01: And I do think that's a virtuous cycle.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_01: Fast you grow the more I tell it you get.
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_01: Which grows you faster and so it can also be vicious in the other direction.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_01: It's mostly vicious in the other direction.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_00: I'm hiring for about six or seven roles.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_00: What mistakes do you think I'll likely make?
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_00: Like, if somebody comes in as a sea level exec and has no network of people that they've worked with in the past,
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_01: that's weird.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_01: Who of you hired recently that is significantly better than you or has taught you something?
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_00: Who takes you to school?
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_00: This is something that I can only say now with 14 years of business experience.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: Which is...
[00:00:59] I just like, I think Sean does this as well.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_00: You think in frameworks.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_00: I don't think like that at all.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_00: That does not come naturally to me.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_00: And whenever I hear you or we have a mutual friend, Ryan Dice,
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: and Ryan was like, he was like, making me feel like a jerk.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_00: He was like, you don't think in frameworks?
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: Like, how do you learn something and then think how you're going to teach it to your team or whatever?
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, I don't know, man.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm like a Neanderthal.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: Like, I just kind of like float by life sometimes.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_00: And I just like, I don't like reflect and think in a framework.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_00: But you do that.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_00: I think frameworks happen when you have to reteach or reuse the same thought process over and over again.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_01: And so rather than read arriving, the same decision set,
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: you create a framework to give yourself mental shorthand.
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: And so I think it's just like...
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_01: Like, I created the scaling, like you read the implementation workshop,
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: like the MoZ6 or whatever.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_01: It's like more metrics, market, model, money,
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_01: and then there are some model, there's, you know, four offshoots and then finally manpower.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_01: So it's like these are the six reasons that people get limited in their business, right?
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_01: And that was because I had to think like, okay, I've done so many Q&A calls.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_01: There has to be...
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_01: There is a decision tree.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_01: Like, it might be more complex than I thought it was,
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: but there is a decision tree that I'm going through.
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_01: And so just actually crystallizing that.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_01: And so you totally think in frameworks, you just haven't documented them.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_01: That's my two cents.
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_01: That's my opinion.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_01: Well, like you had this cool...
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: Like, I've been watching your...
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: I think I told you the other day, I was watching your content.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_00: Not on tactics of making money, but on tactics of leadership and management.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: And you had this cool thing called the diamond.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: Yes, great.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: It was like, basically for the listener, it was like,
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: if you have an employee who's not doing what you want them to do,
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_00: they're either...
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: They don't know what you want done.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: They don't know how to do it.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: They weren't motivated or they don't know, I think, when that you want it done.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, or they're something walking them.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: And when you come up with something like that,
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: is that something that you make up or do you read other books and you steal,
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_00: like, cool bits of inspiration and you repurpose them for your need?
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_01: So, honest truth, I really don't read as much as I probably should.
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_01: Almost all my stuff just comes from me doing it and then saying,
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_01: man, there's got to be an easy way to describe this.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_01: If I happen to come along some sort of...
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_01: If there's some coincidence, I see that as corroboration of an idea.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_01: But yeah, I really don't consume anyone else's stuff for inspiration.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_01: I have enough shit going on every day.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: I have tons of stuff to talk about.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_01: And so, yeah, the management document was like,
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_01: fundamentally, people don't do stuff for a reason.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_01: I have to figure out what that reason is.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: And if there's a way that I can have a framework that I can have for this conversation
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_01: that makes it less like, how do I not attack the person?
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_01: Rather than say, you are least a piece of shit,
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: it's like that's unlikely to be productive
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_01: and also probably not the real cause of why they're not doing things.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_01: Because most people do prefer to stay employed
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_01: and also prefer to do a good job, I think, find large.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: And so, if we take that to be true and I want the Mississippi to be there,
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_01: then what's getting in the way here?
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, I didn't communicate that I wanted them to do this thing.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_01: Okay, well, that's on me.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_01: I didn't tell, like, I told them, but then they're like,
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: cool, I don't know how to do that.
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_01: That's a training issue.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_01: Okay, you know, they didn't know there was a deadline associated with.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: That's a win problem, right?
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_01: And then it's like, okay, well, they knew when to do it.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_01: They knew how to do it.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_01: And they knew that I wanted them to do it.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_01: Then it's like, okay, well, then is there something blocking them?
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_01: Now, the motivation one of like, they're not motivated to,
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_01: is like, technically correct.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_01: But it's the last one that I'll go to
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: because most times people are relatively motivated to do it.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_01: Now, mind you, there's definitely times when that's just not the case, right?
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_01: Or the how component has a more generalized skill that someone doesn't have.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_01: So I'll say differently.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_01: Like, if in order to do a role, my position is,
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_01: like, you've probably heard like, attitude versus aptitude.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_01: And that used to bug me a lot because I was like,
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_01: well, I can't always be what it is, right?
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_01: Because it's really just that's, there's,
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_01: there's a deficiency in someone's skill set to enter an organization to do a role.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_01: And so we want to hire for the small skill deficiency.
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_01: If you're hiring for what people consider low skill labor.
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_01: So if you run an Airbnb in need-mades,
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_01: or you have a yogurt shop and you need to have people who do,
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_01: you know, clean the counter and like check people out,
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_01: that's very low skill, technically.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_01: But in terms of hiring, you're going to hire for attitude, not aptitude.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_01: And that's just because the amount of skills required to train someone on attitude,
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_01: far out way, the skills it takes to take somebody who's already friendly,
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_01: knows how to show up on time, can smile, say hello, makes chitchat,
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_01: teach them how to use a cash register and clean thing,
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: could take like two hours.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_01: Like, it's not a lot of training in order to do that role.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_01: And so it doesn't make sense to hire someone for aptitude.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: Like, I've worked a cash register before, but I'm a dick.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, that's not going to be very helpful.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: Like, I'm going to have to train you to not be a dick.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_01: It's not worth it.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_01: On the flip side, if you want to have the number one AI researcher in the world,
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: if that guy's a bit of a dick,
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_01: then you could probably work with him on being a little bit, you know,
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_01: better at communicating with the team.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_01: You're not going to take the person who was, you know,
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_01: the yogurt, your store cash register, assuming they'd take, you know,
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_01: they're not on the side doing all this stuff and make them the number one AI researcher.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_01: And so it's like, we always just all should, at least in my opinion,
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_01: hire for the person with the small skill deficiency.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_01: And then we have to ask the question is the business owner,
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_01: given that skill deficiency, is it worth us or worth our resources to train them?
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_01: And so I take the position that I think every skill is trainable.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_01: It's just, is it worth training?
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_01: Like are there other people I get higher returns on?
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_01: In which case, great, I'll use them.
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_01: And that for me is fundamentally like, why?
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_01: I would say that over my career, the biggest change in terms of my hiring practices
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_01: is I hire far more for general intelligence now.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_01: The intelligence will allow someone to bridge the skill gap faster.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: And so it's a return on resources for where they are versus where they need to be,
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_01: whether it's a quote attitude issue or quote, hard skills issue.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: But I see soft skills and hard skills as just skills.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_01: Hard skills are easy to define and measure.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_01: Soft skills are just hard to define and measure,
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_01: but they still are definable and measurable.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_01: And so I want somebody as high intelligence because I define intelligence as rate of learning.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_01: And so if I can get someone who has a high rate of learning versus somebody else,
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_01: maybe that person starts a little bit behind,
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_01: but in six months they're going to pass the other person who might have experience.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_01: And so again, it all depends on what the timeline is.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_01: If I take a toddler, I can get them to be an adult and 18 years would be perfect,
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_01: but I don't know if I have 18 years to wait.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_01: And so that's kind of my general rubric.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_01: When you're hiring for smart people, how do you figure out if they're smart?
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: Really good question.
[00:07:15] I think the quality, so a couple of things.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_01: So the quality of the questions that they ask, let's go deep into one.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_00: So the quality of questions that they ask, okay, what's a high quality question?
[00:07:27] So if someone said, hey, I noticed that you guys have this media brand here,
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_01: and you have this advisory practice here,
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_01: what's revenue retention around that is there's another vehicle that you guys have considered
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_01: that isn't in the pipeline right now.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_01: I'd be like, wow, that demonstrated that they did a fair amount of research
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_01: and they were able to take a complex thought between these two things
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_01: and ask me about it.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_01: So that's a great question.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: Whereas if someone says, what's the five-year vision of the company,
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_01: I don't say that as a bad question.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_01: I just see that it's kind of a generic interview question.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: That's one of my tasks.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_01: And if that's not already answerable online,
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_01: which the pros and cons of our situation similar to you,
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_01: is that a lot of my stuff is public.
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_01: And so I expect somebody to come in with better than generic questions
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_01: because I've already answered generic questions public.
[00:08:14] Hey everyone, really quick.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying this episode on CEO stuff,
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_00: so delegating, having hard conversations with your team, hiring,
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_00: then I've got something for you.
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_00: So the team at HubSpot, they actually went and fit together
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: a bunch of best practices that Sean and I use in our own companies.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_00: And they put it together and something that's really easy to read
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: and understand.
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_00: And so if you want to just save yourself 10 years of headache
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: and heartache, then you should check it out.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: I wish we had this long time ago, would have helped me a lot.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: But there should be a QR code on your screen
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_00: that you can scan or a link in the description.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: So check it out.
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: It's totally free and totally awesome.
[00:08:48] Okay, and so what was the second one?
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: Oh, when they deconstruct a problem that they're solving
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_01: in terms of what they're thinking with.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_01: So I mean, to be fair, this isn't like my invention.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_01: But like, in the consulting world, people do cases for a reason.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: They want to hear how, like, okay, how many ping pong balls
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_01: fit on a 747?
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_01: This is a common question they would ask in a college interview.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_01: Not because they care about the answer.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_01: They care about how you think through getting the answer
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_01: because it demonstrates a level of force power.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_01: And so for us, I would say, a practice that equities.com,
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_01: we use as frustrating at our higher level leadership roles,
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: is we actually, instead of presenting them hypothetical cases,
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_01: we actually present them with the real cases.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know, worst case we get free consulting,
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_01: best case we get somebody who is capable
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_01: of implementing that solution that they just came up with.
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_01: And so if they can use frameworks that I wasn't aware of,
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_01: experiences that I'm not aware of, those things will come out
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_01: in that complex issue that we're dealing with.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_01: But it's also at least like way more interesting
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_01: of an interview for me because now like,
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_01: they're solving my problems on way more engaged.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_01: So does that mean that like the hiring manager,
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_00: maybe you would have someone at the company
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: has like a generic description of the company
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_00: and what some of the numbers are.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_00: And maybe they're like fake numbers even.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: And then each role will have a specific problem
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_00: that you need help solving for at the company
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: and they get like a Google doc, like a two-pager in advance.
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_00: And it's like prepare your thoughts, send it to me in advance.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to read it and then we're going to have discussion
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_00: about it.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_00: So I'll differentiate this by level of role and type.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_01: And so I'm talking, because right now I'm like needy
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_01: to be like sea level like interviews.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_01: So that's like what I'm thinking with right now.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_01: If we're trying to hire an editor or a salesperson,
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: those are roles that are super repeated
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_01: and as a result having credibly structured
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_01: interview processes and whatnot.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_01: And so for those like for a salesperson, for example,
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_01: it's like we're going to send a script to every candidate
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_01: that we want to invite to a group interview first.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_01: And so they're going to get the script ahead of time.
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_01: And we want to hear them do a one minute, two minutes
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_01: down by the script.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: If they didn't even take the time to like go through
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_01: a few times, like they're going to sound horrible.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_01: So immediately either they don't have the skill
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_01: or they don't have the work ethic either way
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_01: we can weed those people out.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_01: And we can tell within a couple of minutes.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_01: So we don't need to waste a 30 minute call
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_01: on somebody who wants to be a salesperson.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_01: We can have 10 people in the call one or two minutes
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_01: and we can find out if someone's got a little bit of game.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_01: From there, it's like, OK, then we'll say, hey,
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_01: you mess this thing up, tweak it, try it again.
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_01: When we do that, we get to see how coachable they are,
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_01: how much eager they have, and how quickly
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_01: they can learn intelligence.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_01: I actually read a book that you suggested,
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_00: the guy who found the HubSpot sales team wrote that book.
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_00: And I, where you do the same thing here.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: And in the book, he actually says that IQ is the number one.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: He was like, charisma is important,
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: but it's not the most important thing.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_00: It's ability to learn quickly.
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_01: And I think part of that also is like,
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_01: they were selling to business owners and, you know,
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_01: SudaWee and most of our portfolios be to be.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: And so like, if a salesperson is being like outguned
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_01: consistently by, you know, the people
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_01: that they're getting on the phone with,
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_01: the people on the phone feel like they're talking to somebody
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_01: using Adia and can't actually help themselves
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_01: their problem.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: And so, yeah, I think general intelligence
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_01: is such an important part.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_01: But like, honestly, it's started there,
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_01: but like, I kind of just see it across the organization.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_01: Like, show me exceptional organizations
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_01: that employ dumb or people.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: Like, it's, I mean, there are some,
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_01: but especially in the work that we do,
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: be to be in higher level, you need horsepower.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: So in terms of intelligence, like rate of learning,
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_01: and we can actually demonstrate them learning
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_01: on a small level.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_01: And that works same thing with editors.
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_01: We follow a very similar process.
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_01: Here's some raw footage.
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_01: Send us a clip back with your edit.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: We can look at just the final output.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_01: And that allows us to be more objective about,
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_01: like, some people don't present well,
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_01: but that doesn't mean they're bad editors.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_01: And I think like interviewing itself is a skill,
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_01: just like anything else.
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_01: And I don't need somebody's graded,
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_01: interviewing, I need somebody's graded editing.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_01: And so, trying to pull that apart
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_01: and something that Laylist taught me
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_01: that's been really helpful, like for me lately has been,
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_01: just like, some people are incredibly smart,
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_01: but are not very good at communicating.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_01: And depending on the role,
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_01: they might not have as much need
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_01: for that level of communication.
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_01: And so that's where it gets a little bit more nuanced.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_01: But I want to be around.
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_01: Like I've actually talked to people that are very charming
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: and they communicate wonderfully.
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, I can't fall victim to this.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: You're actually an idiot.
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: I don't think you know what you're doing.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: I've hired these people before.
[00:13:06] What was it?
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_01: It was like always go for an ugly surgeon
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_01: or something like that.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_01: Like, yeah.
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_01: There's some, there's some razor.
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_01: I just wanted to put my little disclaimer out there,
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_01: which is like, I by no means
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_01: playing that we are a perfect at hiring or anything like that.
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_01: We just like everybody, we take our licks.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: But I would say the hardest ones are always leadership
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_01: because you have fewer, like, you might appreciate this.
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_01: Whenever I, whenever I go into a room of entrepreneurs,
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_01: I say, hey, who here is on more than,
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_01: is on their second business or beyond.
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_01: And like, almost the whole room raised their hands.
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, okay, cool.
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_01: Now, of those of you who are on your second business
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_01: and beyond, who here at your current business grew
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_01: way faster or past your first businesses.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_01: And like, almost the entire room raised their hands.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: And I always think like, so why is that?
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_01: And so I think that at the most basic level,
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_01: it's pattern recognition, but especially
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_01: when it comes to talent.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_01: And so like, if you think about building,
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_01: like, let's say a million dollar business,
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_01: it's like, first you have us,
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_01: you have some marketing function, you have some sales
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_01: function, you have some delivery function,
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_01: you know, whatever, you know, across the board.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_01: And for the first time ever, when, as soon as, you know,
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_01: maybe million, maybe it's three million a year,
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_01: whatever it is, like, it's not you anymore.
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_01: Like, somebody else has to do some of this stuff.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_01: And so you get your first pattern recognition of like,
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_01: oh, this is somebody who can do some advertiser.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_01: This is some person who can do some sales.
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_01: This is the person who can do some low level management.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_01: This is the person who can do some, you know,
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_01: some delivery or whatever.
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_01: And so, and you basically keep struggling
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_01: and keep plateauing at that level.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_01: And so you find that one person who's like,
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_01: competent and then you're like, oh my God,
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_01: you could do the job.
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_01: This is amazing.
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_01: And then the business grows until that next level,
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_01: you know, that next year's trade.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_01: And so then across the board by department, one by one,
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_01: it's like, you have these six months,
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_01: 12 month periods where you go through interviews and interviews
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_01: and hiring and onboarding just to see if this person's competent.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_01: And then whenever they're not, you're like,
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_01: I have to start over again.
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_01: And then the business basically stays where it's at.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_01: And so I think that, I think the more experience
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_01: we've had on each of these roles of like,
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_01: this is what, you know, SDR looks like.
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_01: This is what SDR manager looks like.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_01: This is what a closer looks like.
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_01: This is what a senior closure looks like.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_01: This is what a closing manager looks like.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_01: This is what a director of sales looks like.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_01: This is what a VP of sales looks like.
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_01: Like, it took me time to learn each of these levels
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_01: and to obviously do that across departments.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_01: But then after that point,
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_01: when you got these new businesses,
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_01: you're not even building the business,
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_01: you're just assembling it.
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and that's becomes, that's actually quite frustrating.
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_00: Not frustrating, but it's a hard lesson to learn
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_00: because after, if we had to generalize it,
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_00: at my guess is somewhere around 5 million
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_00: or maybe like a million a year in profit
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_00: or maybe half a million a year in profit, honestly.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_00: Like, there's this, I grew up going to Catholic school
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: and there's this like, one of the most famous scenes
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: of the Bible is like, Jesus telling Peter is like,
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_00: you're no longer a fisherman.
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_00: You gotta come and work with me
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_00: and you're gonna be a fisher of men.
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_00: And I think, like, once you get to like 5 million in revenue,
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_00: that's what you have to become is a collector of people.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_00: And that is jarring, right?
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_00: Because that's not typically why a lot of people
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: have started their businesses.
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: But in order to mix up the growth,
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: past 5 million, I don't know where that number's gonna be,
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_00: but you start just having to collect human beings.
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_01: No one is the game.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of it's just the pattern recognition
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: around behavior traits and skills,
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_01: where you have to just say like,
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: oh, I know with this VP,
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_01: I know with, like, I had a VP of sales, they were awesome.
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_01: What does this person look like here?
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: I also think, and this is something that like,
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: I can only say now with like, I guess 14 years
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_01: of business experience,
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_01: I'm just beginning to reap this,
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_01: which is the snowball of talent,
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_01: which is like, if you've had multiple businesses
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_01: and you've had good outcomes
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_01: and you treated people well over an extended period of time,
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: some people start following you from thing to thing, right?
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_01: And then you start to have this core team
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_01: that just like, they're like, they're good.
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_01: Like, and then when you do the next thing,
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_01: like, they're all with you.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_01: And I think that like, I don't know,
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_01: but I would imagine that in 20 more years,
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_01: like the team of talent of those people
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_01: who just prefer to operate the way we operate
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_01: and like the culture that we have and like each other,
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_01: it's more like, like if somebody comes in as a sea level
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_01: exec and has no network of people
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_01: that they've worked with in the past,
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, that's weird.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_01: Like, you don't have anyone from all the past roles
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_01: who you've worked with who either A, you think is a stud,
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_01: which is weird that you don't think anyone will stud.
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_01: Or alternatively, you think they were studed,
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_01: they don't wanna come to like your new thing
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: because you're not a good leader.
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_01: And so that's a great like litmus test
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_01: in terms of like how good of a leader is this person?
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_01: It's like, who do they have in their black book
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: because we need to build out this function quickly
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_01: and I'm expecting you to bring some of that to the table.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: Who of you hired recently that is significantly better
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_00: than you or has taught you something
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_00: because you're in the role now
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_00: where you have to do all the talking
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_00: and a lot of the teaching for your audience
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: and at your workshops and with the companies
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_00: that you work with.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_00: Who takes you to school?
[00:17:35] Ah, Shoranda's, Shoranda's when you're president.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_01: He's so knowledgeable on the,
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_01: I mean, he's so knowledgeable in a lot of different things
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_01: but like, he said two plus billion dollar companies
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_01: and so obviously acquisition is the third
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_01: that we're shooting for depending on
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_01: when we have our third party validation.
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_01: But basically it's like the bigger the company gets,
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_01: I feel like the better he gets.
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_01: You know what I mean?
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_01: Like the more in his willhouse he is
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_01: in terms of like data pipelines, infrastructure,
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_01: real-time dashboards, how can we,
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_01: like how can finance get weaponized?
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_01: I would say that Leila, like,
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_01: Shoranda's so good at the finance function
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_01: and understanding just like just tax ramifications,
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_01: entity structure, like just a lot of the things that I,
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_01: you know, for me, my, my, my acumen is on like,
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_01: how do we let people know about it?
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_01: How do we get them to give us money for it?
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_01: How do we make sure that they really like it
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_01: until they're friends?
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_01: Like that has been basically the core of my skill set.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_01: Does that include?
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_01: Does that include, is the, is the last thing you said there?
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: Is that product?
[00:18:29] Yeah.
[00:18:30] Okay, exactly.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_01: And then it, but like everything outside of that
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: is definitely not what I would say like my core core.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_01: It's like, Leila's so good at that,
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_01: like a lot of what we were talking about there
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_01: is me somewhat relaying Leila's, you know, Zika,
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_01: or you know, Leila's M.O. around people and people on talent.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_01: But Shoranda's so good at like,
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_01: enterprise, not yet structuring, just like a lot,
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_01: just a lot of the things that, you know,
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_01: a public CEO would be good at.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_01: And that's, and that's what he comes from.
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_01: But he's also is like, and I would say like,
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_01: from an observation personally, like,
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_01: the true A, A, A talent,
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_01: one, they're not employees.
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_01: They are partners.
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_01: And they see themselves as partners.
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_01: And if you don't see them as partners,
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_01: then they are not a plus, you know,
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_01: how do you treat a partner differently than an employee?
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_01: Like, how would I know if I have a partner?
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_01: Well, I think if you go to them,
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_01: because you're not sure what to do,
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_01: and they're giving you advice, to me that's a partner.
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_01: If you're constantly directing them and saying,
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_01: this is what we're gonna do, this is what we're gonna do,
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_01: there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: But they're not a thought partner.
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_01: And I also use that as a great limits test
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_01: for like the true sea level executives that we have
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_01: is like, do I want to talk to this person
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_01: about this complex problem?
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_01: If I don't seek their advice,
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: then it means that I don't see them as a value add.
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_01: And so then they're not,
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_01: like, they're not super essential, which is not good.
[00:19:46] But yeah, so I think that, and then the other piece,
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_01: and this is something, again, I feel like I've learned more
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_01: recently, because I'm super deep in sea level stuff right now.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_01: But it's clouds to dirt.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_01: So vertically integrated, full stack skill sets.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_01: And so I think the best sales leaders can go,
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_01: they can hop on the phone and get a cold lead to book
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_01: an appointment from an SDR level,
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_01: all the way to building sales strategy of which starts
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_01: to merge into marketing.
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_01: It's like what kind of messaging do we need to look at?
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_01: What kind of advertisers have the highest likelihood
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_01: of buying our stuff?
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_01: How can we weave that into our process and our scripting?
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_01: How can we cut our training time in onboarding new rep?
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_01: They're really thinking about the sales organization,
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_01: but they can also do almost every job.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_01: And I just have yet to find, like,
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_01: truly exceptional people that are full stack.
[00:20:35] So you're right now because of your size,
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: you're competing in the type of person you need.
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_00: You're competing with a lot,
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_00: you're in a very competitive industry in terms of talent.
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and so I imagine you're competing in some of the AI guys,
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_00: you're competing in a lot of tech companies,
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: and the value, and the value that they provide,
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_00: I would head a guest, it's just lots and lots of money,
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_00: which I think you have the ability to do that.
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we pay well.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: But they also have the ability to offer equity
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_00: for this lottery ticket maybe.
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_00: I don't know what else, but I'm sure there's many things
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_00: that they offer that you can't.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_00: What do you have to offer to them other than market rate
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_00: or above market rate money?
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's growth and impact.
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_01: Like if you were to ask everybody in the company,
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_01: I was just not called with the number one thing
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_01: that they come forward, it's growth.
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_01: Like none of those companies are like not none.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_01: A lot of those companies aren't growing at the rate
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_01: that we're growing.
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_01: And so there's so much career advancement and opportunity.
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_01: We are very meritocratic.
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_01: And so like anyone can come here and move up
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_01: independent of age, even independent of tenure.
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_01: Like we had a guy who came here 90 days ago
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_01: and got a very large promotion
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_01: after coming in a pretty high role already.
[00:21:47] Just because he demonstrated he was great,
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_01: and we're like great, we have this opening,
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_01: we think you'd be the best fit.
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_00: And the growth is the revenue of the company,
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_00: which then means you pull people up to higher roles.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_00: So then basically in order to attract A plus talent,
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_00: you have to grow fast.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, you have to grow fast.
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_01: And I do think that's a virtuous cycle,
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_01: which is like the faster you grow,
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_01: the more I tell it you get, which grows you faster.
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_01: And so like it can also be vicious in the other direction.
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_01: It's mostly vicious in the other direction.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_01: You're shrinking and you have no money to give people.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I guess it gets started.
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_01: But you are like a lot of businesses
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_00: are like growing only 20% of you.
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, some like fine,
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_00: but mediocre number.
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, where do they start?
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_00: If they don't have growth in order,
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_00: not growth in terms of just the money to pay people,
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_00: but growth in order to impress the right people,
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_00: to join them.
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: I think it all depends on the opportunity
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_01: and the level of the pool that you're competing against.
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_01: If you are an AI, true AI company,
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_01: it is super competitive.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_01: On the flip side though, if someone's gonna start a new division,
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_01: for us, I can just say like I can guarantee you demand.
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_01: Not a lot of people can do that.
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_01: And so it's not a question of whether this will work or not
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_01: is this the best use of the demand that we have?
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_01: And so it becomes an opportunity cost question.
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_01: But a lot of people, in some ways,
[00:23:02] SPEAKER_01: it's less risky to come to ACQ
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_01: because we have so much demand.
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_01: And there's just, there's so much opportunity.
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_01: That's basically it.
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_01: If you're working for Jimmy,
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_01: he said he's used a different brand, like Mr. Beast.
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_01: He has virtually a limitless demand.
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_01: And so if he's like, hey, can you help me spin up
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_01: whatever, pick a random thing?
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_01: If Mr. Beast was gonna say, hey,
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_01: let's start an umbrella brand.
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't mean like he for sure will sell umbrellas.
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_01: It's just not the best use of his resources, right?
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_01: And so it's like, we need somebody who can come in,
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_01: recognize the best vehicle for the demand that we have
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_01: and then be able to obviously execute it on it.
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_01: But a lot of people don't have that,
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_01: like built in guaranteed, they just don't have that.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_01: And so that becomes actually significantly riskier
[00:23:47] SPEAKER_01: despite what other cool perks might exist.
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_01: So it's like you've guaranteed demand,
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_01: you've basically guaranteed growth
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_01: as fast as you can grow, we can grow.
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_01: And that's, and we also still pay exceptionally well.
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_01: And so with though, you know, those things put together,
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_01: we can get very, very good talent.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_01: And there's also people that are just very mission driven.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_01: Like we have a lot of people come in
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_01: and they're like, I've consumed your stuff for years in.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_01: I saw the recruiter reached out to me and I was stoked.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_01: And that was it.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_01: Like there's just, in some ways, it's like,
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: you know, private equity number 17,
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_01: it's like, it's almost, it's just commoditized.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_01: Like their business has commoditized.
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_01: It's just not that interesting.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_01: And so they have to compete on price.
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_01: And so their price is their comp.
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_01: Whereas if you have a value proposition,
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_01: like what's the, what's the grand slam offer
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_01: from an employee perspective,
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_01: rather than a grand slam offer from a product perspective?
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_01: Because it's still the exact same process
[00:24:35] of acquiring talent as it is to acquire customers.
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_01: It's just a reverse funnel.
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_01: What mistakes do you think most people make
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_00: when it comes to hiring?
[00:24:43] Oh man.
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_00: Or maybe you could say, maybe it's answered differently.
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_00: I'm hiring about six or seven roles.
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_00: What mistakes do you think I'll likely make?
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_00: Well, what's the role?
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_01: Or what are some of the roles?
[00:24:55] Yeah.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_00: So we could say, what's like a really, a salesperson.
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_00: That's a simple one.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_00: But I'm hiring other roles.
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_00: So I'm hiring chapter leads.
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_00: So we have 13 chapters that we, my business is based in
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: and we're hiring people to manage each chapter.
[00:25:09] I mean, the easy answer is settling,
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_01: but it's so tough because there's trades
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_01: because these things don't exist outside of time.
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's like, I have to fill this role
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_01: and I want to find somebody,
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: it's spent, obviously for us at the sea level
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_01: because that's the top line for me.
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_01: It's like, I have to have somebody
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_01: that went on the phone with them.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_01: I'm thinking, I have to have this person.
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_01: And if I don't have that, but I'm like,
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_01: man, I really need this role.
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_01: And so if I'm thinking from the,
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_01: like, I really have to fill this role,
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_01: angle, it's like, usually not the right person.
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_01: If I'm thinking like, I don't even
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: care if I ever roll for this person.
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_01: I have to get them in.
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: It's usually the right person.
[00:25:43] Are you willing to pay them more
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_01: than you originally thought was feasible?
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_00: Yes, 100%.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_01: Not even a question.
[00:25:49] Have you ever been like, I got to come up with enough money.
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_00: Like, I hope I can get enough sales
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_00: to afford this person, but I have to have them.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_00: I haven't had the second part
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_01: because we're a super casual positive company,
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_01: so like that has been a problem.
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_01: I mean, fundamentally, as long as I can just
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_01: pencil out the ROI of the role, then yeah, I'll do it.
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's just a return on capital.
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_01: What's your desired return though?
[00:26:09] Amazing.
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_00: Well, it's like, I mean, I still think
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: that she's allowed you to put amazing in.
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_00: Equals amazing.
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_00: Mine too.
[00:26:18] I think the highest returns on capital
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_01: we get as entrepreneurs is talent.
[00:26:22] Like full stock.
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_01: Like, where else do you get 10x, 20x, you know,
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_01: returns, 100x returns?
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_01: And can do so reliably.
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_01: Like, talent is one of those places you can do it.
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_01: I will also say that typically the higher up the org,
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_01: the higher the arbitrage.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_01: Are you fast to fire?
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_01: We continue to get faster.
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_01: I'll say that.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: I think we get faster.
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_01: I would say that our firing practices
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_01: do somewhat rely on the constraint.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_01: So like sometimes, you know, Laila says this,
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_01: but like some fires aren't kitchen fires.
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_01: They're like the trash can of the driveways on fire.
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_01: It's like, it's a problem.
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: Like, we'll get to it.
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_01: But it's not the thing that's limiting the business.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_01: And so if we have somebody who's not as good as they should be,
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_01: but they're not in a role this right now,
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_01: like limiting the company,
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_01: it's probably not going to be our first priority to take them out.
[00:27:14] But as soon as that becomes the constraint,
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_01: then it like quickly gets unearthed
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_01: and then it gets handled.
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_01: Have you followed day Portnoy,
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: Barsville Sport?
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, he's quirky, right?
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_00: He's crazy.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_00: He, uh, one of his jokes, but it's out of joke.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: He's like, I don't fire people.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_00: He's like, I just, I don't want to fire people.
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_00: And if they're a loser, I'll just keep paying them
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_00: and they're going to sit in the corner and be a loser.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_00: But I don't fire anyone.
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_00: And I kind of thought that was hilarious.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_00: It's funny because he's a content company
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_00: and he can be content out of it and get ROI out of like,
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_00: just make fun of someone who wants a fire.
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_00: But I was like shocked that that would be his take on it
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_00: because they seemed like a pretty brutal guy.
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_00: Not a brutal guy, but he seems like very blunt
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_00: and he has no problem firing people.
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_00: And he was like, I do, I suck at it.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_00: I don't like the confrontation.
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_00: I don't like people feeling bad.
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_00: It's, I just don't do it.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_00: I'd rather lose money.
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_00: And when I asked you about firing,
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_00: I thought that you were going to be like, yeah,
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_00: like I fire fast,
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_00: but I sensed a small bit in your voice
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_00: where it sounded like potentially you were slow to fire
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_00: because maybe I'm reading too much into your sentiment
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_00: or your tone of voice,
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_00: but it was like, I just don't like it.
[00:28:17] Well, I don't think anybody likes it.
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_01: I think we're fast to fire
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_01: if it is the constraint of the business
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_01: and clearly that person is the one limiting us.
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_01: Like we will not sacrifice the company's growth
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_01: and the opportunity of all the people
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_01: who've trusted us with their careers
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_01: to not have a comfortable conversation.
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_01: There's also levels of this.
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_01: And so like, let's say there's like,
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_01: you know, a red yellow green, right?
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_01: If someone's like, well, green, they're great.
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_01: If I say basically, maybe like a yellow orange red,
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_01: those are just as the three levels.
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_01: For me, like if somebody's just not,
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_01: doesn't have the complete competence,
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_01: but is not like they can still do their job,
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_01: but they're not doing it as well as they should
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_01: and they're definitely not going to grow
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_01: and they can't take on new opportunities.
[00:28:53] Then that's a me's like a yellow.
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_01: If they're like, for sure, like they can't actually do
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_01: their role right now, that's an orange.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_01: If red is like, you can't do the role right now
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_01: and that thing is required for us to grow.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_01: And so that's kind of like I would say,
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_01: like it's a combination of like,
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_01: what is the business need and how incompetent is the person?
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_01: And so the rates of fire, I think would depend on both
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_01: of those things.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_01: Obviously, when like in a perfect world,
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_01: we get everyone out who's not a fit
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_01: as soon as soon as possible.
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_01: It's just that sometimes some people do turn it around
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_01: with good feedback and coaching.
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_01: That probably happens half the time.
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_01: Like I guess asking myself the question,
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_01: like, why do I feel bad about making this decision
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_01: and then trying to make sure that I'm not acting
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_01: in the global bad for a local good?
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_01: Like local versus global.
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_01: Like I think about that as like my way of trying to break
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_01: through that like terrible feeling you have
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_01: and you're like, I have to let this person go.
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, if I don't,
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_01: I'm choosing short term comfort over long term discomfort.
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_01: And I think most of life can be boiled down
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_01: to people doing that over and over again.
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_01: As they take the local way and they take the short term way
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_01: and for the global loss.
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_01: And it's like if you do that enough times,
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_01: you get a global catastrophe.
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_01: And so that's what I try to avoid.
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_01: And I just put the greater good as the frame
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_01: as my little spiritual armor, if you will,
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_01: of going into it knowing that this person might get upset.
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_01: And this might even dramatically inconvenience
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_01: this person's life in the short term.
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_01: But like I owe to the other zillion people
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_01: who also have put their careers, their lives
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_01: in my hands to a degree from a decision making process
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_01: like I owe it to them.
[00:30:30] And so that's what kind of gets me over the hump
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_01: to pull the trigger faster.
[00:30:33] The Founders podcast, you ever heard that by David Cennara?
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_00: It's awesome.
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_00: I love it.
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_00: And I love reading biographies of historical entrepreneurs
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_00: and a common thing that I get from the Founders podcast
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_00: is patience and basically doing something for decades.
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_00: That's another thing that I've gotten from your content,
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_00: which is things take a long time,
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_00: they take longer than you think,
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_00: it's gonna be harder than you think.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_00: And I believe that to be true.
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_00: But then also I see people like you,
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_00: and if you go to your YouTube,
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_00: I think on every description, it was like age 26,
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_00: I was here, age 27, I was here, age, and I'm like,
[00:31:11] I don't think he was very patient.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_00: That doesn't really, that doesn't read like a patient person
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_00: because I think you, if I remember correctly,
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_00: I'm just making this up.
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_00: I think you started acquisition.com at something like the age
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_00: of 31 and then by like 33 or 34,
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_00: you had the seminar business that you guys do,
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_00: and it was probably doing many tens of millions,
[00:31:30] SPEAKER_00: probably eight figures, mid eight figures in business
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_00: and very profitable.
[00:31:33] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, well, that doesn't seem like something
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_00: that was, I mean, that was pretty fast.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_00: How do you talk about being patient all the time,
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_00: but you're moving out of wicked pace
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_00: and getting results quickly?
[00:31:45] I think the patience is relative
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_01: to the outcome that you're going for.
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_01: And so like if you're trying to climb Everest, right?
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_01: Your rate of ascension in terms of altitude
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_01: is going to be significantly faster than somebody
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_01: who's trying to climb a foot hill.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_01: The percentage growth might be the same though.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_01: And so a patient person might be willing to grow at
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_01: one, two, three, four percent per year
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_01: towards their ultimate Everest,
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_01: but it's just that 4% of Everest is significantly
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_01: faster than 4% of a foot hill.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_01: And so the absolute difference will be different,
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_01: but the relative difference,
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: which is like what I'm quote measuring myself against
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_01: is where I feel patient.
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_01: I think that's where the whole macro,
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_01: you know, macro speed, sorry,
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: macro patients, micro speed is super important.
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_01: So we still need, we still have deadlines,
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_01: we still need to move the ball forward,
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_01: we still have to act of urgency.
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_01: We still have to ask the question like,
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_01: what would it take in order to do this in half the time?
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_01: What would it take for us to do this in a fifth of the time?
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_01: And can we do that?
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_01: Let's do that.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_01: And I think I honestly see a lot of the job of the manager
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_01: or the driver or the operator, depending what term you want to use,
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_01: as doing that, which is just consistently pulling,
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_01: like pulling the future forward faster.
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_01: And like when you're having, you know,
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_01: even at the tactical level, like you're having a team meeting,
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_01: and you say, hey, when can you get that done by,
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_01: they will give you a date.
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_01: And then like the fall, like, you know, level one manager,
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_01: level zero manager doesn't ask when there's,
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_01: when there's one deadline is.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_01: A level one manager would be like,
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_01: would just accept the deadline.
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_01: Like a level two manager would be like,
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_01: well, what else do you have that's blocking you right now
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_01: from getting that done?
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_01: And they might say, well, I have these three things.
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_01: And at that point, they might say,
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_01: well, this is more important than those things.
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_01: So do this first.
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_01: And then with that new knowledge, what is your new deadline?
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_01: And they might say like, okay, instead of end of week,
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_01: I can get it, you know, two days earlier than that.
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, okay, how many actual hours
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_01: do you think this work will take?
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_01: And they might say like, well, I think it'll probably take
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_01: four hours.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, okay, well, it's new now.
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_01: So why is it not four o'clock today?
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_01: Right? And I think somebody who's willing
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_01: to continue to ask this question,
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_01: and they're like, well, I could do it, you know, today.
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_01: And I just wanted to give myself some time.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_01: But it's like, well, why?
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_01: Right? And so I think that's, that consistent pulling forward.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_01: And the thing is, it's almost like many
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_01: confrontational conversations that I think are required
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_01: in order to move an entire organization
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_01: at breakneck speed.
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I look at you on a lot, you know,
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_01: I said, you know, inspiration from a business perspective.
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_01: And all of his competitors talk about that,
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_01: just like the maniacal sense of urgency that steady carries.
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of it is that it's just like,
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_01: consistently challenging, like, what would it take?
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_01: And is it worth us doing, like, is it worth it
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_01: for what it would take?
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_01: If the answer is yes, then let's do it.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of people kind of like,
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_01: they make their decisions within their frame
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_01: or their realm of reality when that's not based on anything
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_01: besides their own conjecture or some arbitrary timeline
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_01: of what they think it should take.
[00:34:23] I've always been like curious as to how people get
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: to that level because like, for example,
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_00: I was a track athlete in high school in college.
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_00: And I remember thinking in high school, I'm the shit
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_00: because I was so much better than like everyone else.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_00: And then you like get around division one guy's
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_00: and you're like, oh my god, like I'm nothing.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_00: Like there are so many levels.
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_00: And then you like get risen up to that level.
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_00: Or you don't or you get hurt and you just don't.
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_00: You're like, oh, I'm just, I'm not good enough.
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_00: And then when I'm hanging out with guys like you
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_00: or when I think of Elon Musk who have these like
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_00: super intense things, like I'll read something you put out,
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_00: you're like, when I get a new lead, I call them in 60 seconds.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_00: And if I can't do that, I hire someone in her full time job
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_00: is calling someone in 60 seconds.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, that makes so much sense.
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_00: Why did I think that calling someone in 15 minutes
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_00: was adequate?
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_00: And this is just a really small example.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_00: But then it goes all the way up to like building rockets,
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_00: you know, where it's like, oh, I'm not,
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm not gonna leave the warehouse for three weeks.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_00: So how do you think that people get their standards
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_00: to be raised to this like extreme level?
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_00: Like were you around other extreme people?
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_00: And you're like, oh my gosh, there's so much more to do.
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_00: That's now the standard.
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_00: Or do you think that some people are just born extreme?
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_00: And they just get there and they bring others to that level.
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_00: I think it's probably a nature nurture question.
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_01: And it's be clear, I don't know the answer.
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_01: This is just my two cents.
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_01: I've always been a really intense person.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_01: Like my father, my whole upbringing used to always say,
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_01: like balance, he's like, you're so unbalanced,
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_01: you're so unbalanced.
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_01: Because like as soon as I'd find something,
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_01: I just wanted to do nothing besides that thing
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_01: until I had like finished it or whatever it was.
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_01: And so I do think there's a component of that.
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_01: The other aspect though is like, I for sure have had
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_01: called beliefs broken, you know, frame shifts
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_01: from people who were ahead of me.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_01: Like me, even observing Elon, you know,
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_01: it stretches the horizon of what, you know,
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_01: I think we can accomplish.
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_01: And you know, it's actually in some ways very refreshing
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_01: to think like, okay, where was Elon when he was 36?
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_01: Right versus, you know, 56 or whatever,
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_01: you know, how our loyalty is now.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_01: And he had such a exponential like,
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_01: Christianity's career that to me,
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_01: it's like, it's actually very like inspiring
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_01: that it just takes time.
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of that I think what takes time for entrepreneurs
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_01: is there's just so many skills required
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: to be good entrepreneur.
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_01: And you have to be like very good at all of them.
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_01: That's why I see entrepreneurship
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_01: as the single greatest path of personal development.
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_01: Like you get real-time feedback, that you suck.
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_01: And then at some point, most of us on some level
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_01: get to a level of success and then say like,
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_01: this is enough or I'm not willing to make the trade-offs
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_01: beyond this point in other areas.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_01: Because it depends on the entrepreneur that you ask,
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_01: but I would say the vast majority of entrepreneurs
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_01: want to win the game of life.
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_01: And business as a component is one of the games
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_01: within the larger game of life.
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_01: Some people get lost to whatever game they're in.
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_01: Or they just consciously choose that
[00:37:14] SPEAKER_01: that game is more important to them.
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_01: I mean like Steve Jobs accomplished a lot.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: I think there's been a lot that's been documented
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_01: about his personal life suffering,
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_01: you know, as a result of his professional career.
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_01: You could make an argument that he was amazing,
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_01: net positive for humanity, but on the micro level,
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_01: he lived a harder existence.
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_01: Elon is probably another one of those people.
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_01: A lot of people wouldn't want Elon's life.
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_01: And he says you wouldn't want my life.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_01: That's probably a lot of my,
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_01: a lot of my free like shower time right now is like,
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_01: when you know the price of the thing you want,
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_01: like it's okay to go into a store,
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_01: see something you like and then not buy it.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_01: Why are you questioning that now?
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_00: Is it because you just had this huge launch
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_00: and you like hit a milestone that you're like,
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_00: oh my god, I wanted this the whole time
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_00: and I finally got it.
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_00: And maybe I didn't want it as much as I want or do you feel?
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_00: Well, I had a conflict of three things happened
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_01: within 30 days.
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_01: So I had called it a four plus year project come to an end,
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_01: which was a lot of my shower time,
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_01: was around the whole $100 million series
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_01: and the culmination of the money model launch.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_01: So that was one.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_01: There was obviously a financial outcome
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_01: that was, you know, quickly, you know,
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_01: happened at the launch.
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_01: That's the second thing.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_01: Then the third thing is my mother died within 30 days.
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_01: And so it was a very interesting mix
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_01: of different emotions within that period of time.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_01: And so I have, I've had a lot of time to reflect
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_01: on like what are the things that matter most?
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_01: And so like in writing, I mean,
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_01: I think everyone's heard the advice like regular
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_01: on your eulogy and then try to live that way.
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_01: Except most people don't actually take the time
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_01: to write their eulogy.
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_01: But in writing her eulogy, it was,
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_01: it was interesting to see like what portion,
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_01: if we had a pie chart of this eulogy
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_01: is going to be dedicated to her accomplishments
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_01: and she was a relatively accomplished person.
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_01: Compared to the rest of it,
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_01: which was about service and character
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_01: and the vast majority of it was service and character.
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_01: And so in thinking about that, it's like,
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_01: okay, well then if I were to portion my time
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_01: based on what my eulogy percentage would be,
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_01: I would probably not have the same pie chart that I do now.
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: That being said, you know, life has a lot of years.
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_01: And so maybe that slice of pie chart,
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_01: that's the first two or three sentences or whatever,
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_01: might be 15 years.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_01: And then there's just another period of 15 years
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: afterwards or 30 years afterwards that are.
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_01: Maybe that chart.
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, if you live, right?
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_01: Maybe she had a freak accident.
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_01: So hers was a sudden death.
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_01: And so, yeah, so that's what I think about a lot
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_01: is the trade-offs because I think most of like,
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_01: because obviously I have a lot of content that's going out there
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_01: just because people tend to ask me stuff about hard work.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_01: And the reason I think I tweet so much about it
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_01: is because it's always top of mind for me.
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_01: So like I don't have it, we talk about this at the beginning,
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_01: we're like, I don't have a content schedule
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_01: or I don't have like a, you know,
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_01: I'm looking at trending tweets and thinking,
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_01: oh, how do I do my own spin on this?
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_01: Like that's not how I make content.
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_01: I tweet whatever is top of mind
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_01: and the things that come out are the things that I'm thinking about.
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_01: And you're going to kind of like see the trends
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_01: of whatever I'm thinking about a specific season,
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_01: but you just take the aggregate of like a month of tweets
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_01: is like, oh, I'll have to think about this right now.
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're like in a lawsuit
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_00: and you're like talking about like being tough
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_00: or having grit or like, you know, like,
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_00: oh, we're coming up.
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to get sick all.
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like people betraying you
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_01: and like, all this stuff is a bit polite.
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_01: Or you're making all this money
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_00: and it's like gratitude, you know what I mean?
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:40:27] And so I think there's two things
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_01: that I think make entrepreneurship hard.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_01: Number one is uncertainty.
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_01: It's just the absolute kind of like soul crushing uncertainty
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_01: that is always present throughout your day, every day,
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_01: while you're making decisions.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_01: And it's just always this idea
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_01: like you might lose and you don't know.
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_01: And then the other component that makes it so difficult
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_01: is the known quantities that you believe
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_01: that you're going to have to trade in order to get the unknown.
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_01: I guess there is some uncertainty there too.
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_01: The unknown upside.
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_01: And so it's like we can always quantify the downside,
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_01: the thing that we trade
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_01: and we cannot quantify the upside.
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_01: And so I think about that a lot
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_01: because I think a lot of entrepreneurs,
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_01: you know, a lot of entrepreneurs that I see,
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_01: it's especially common with like, you know,
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_01: the lifestyle entrepreneurs
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_01: because I get tons of flat from that community.
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_01: And that's okay.
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_01: Like I just see that it's like,
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_01: we all get to whatever level that we're willing
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_01: to trade for.
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_01: But I just see them as trade-offs.
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_01: And I think most of the regrets that people have
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_01: are wanting the upside from a decision or path not taken
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_01: without taking into account the downside
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_01: that they didn't suffer.
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_01: What's the pie chart like now?
[00:41:31] I mean, I think for now it's almost entirely business.
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_01: I would say like, I probably have 15%
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_01: that's probably dedicated to like marriage,
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_01: stuff like marriage, lay-list stuff.
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_01: And probably 15% that's dedicated to like health stuff.
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_01: So I'm probably like 70% work, 15 health, 15 marriage.
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_01: What do you think when you're thinking about what it should be?
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_00: Do you ever think like,
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_00: why would I like to try on this style or this?
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_00: I think I would love to see a world where like,
[00:42:02] 25 to 30% is business.
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_01: I'd love to see what happens there.
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_01: I also think that there might be like,
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_01: and I say this understanding like the position
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_01: that I'm in to say this, which is,
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_01: I'm approaching a point where more hours
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_01: really doesn't like so much more of it at this point
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_01: will be the leverage of the decisions that I make
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_01: more than the works that I do.
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_01: And so I think I'm feeling that transition right now.
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_01: And so it might be.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_01: That could have been earlier though.
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_01: I mean, you know, I just feel it now
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_01: for whatever that's worth.
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_01: He's got a good team, I guess.
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the team is getting better and better and better.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_01: We have a huge amount of true A level talent
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_01: coming in very excited about that.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_01: Be a lot of the leverages on the decision making.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_01: And maybe it's just as some of the bets
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: that I made five years ago have come to fruition
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_01: and have paid off,
[00:42:55] which then just give more leverage, right?
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_01: Because I mean, fundamentally output
[00:42:59] SPEAKER_01: is just volume times leverage.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_01: And so I mean, I could maybe make a yard
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_01: with it if I did even more.
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_01: Elon still works a lot.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_01: So if you do a lot of volume in with a lot of leverage,
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_01: you build rockets and build trillion dollar businesses.
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_01: So like, you know, I don't say that
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_01: thinking that I'm somehow immune to it.
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_01: 25% business, what else?
[00:43:16] SPEAKER_01: Oh, it would probably just be a more even spread.
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_01: It would probably be like maybe 25%.
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_01: You know, I probably keep,
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_01: I think health would probably be still around 15%
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_01: on my change would I do there.
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_01: But I think I have an appropriate amount
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_01: from the health category.
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_01: I assume I'll just, I'll buck it Layla is just family.
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_01: Wife at all.
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_01: I just think the percentages will change.
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_01: I, you know what, I'll just say that.
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_01: I don't know what they are.
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: I think they will change from what they currently are.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_01: I feel confident in that.
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_00: What's a non-business pursuit
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_00: that you'd want to put in there potentially?
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_01: And I think I need to create the space
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_01: in order for that to get filled.
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_01: Like, I don't think I will have a difficulty
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_01: in finding things to fill my time.
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_01: I think I don't know of you to have any,
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_00: we're buddies, but we're not terribly close,
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_00: but I don't, I've never,
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_00: like we're not that close.
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_00: Well, we're like, we're friends,
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_00: but like we've known each other for,
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_00: often not for a couple of years now.
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_00: And I've never seen you show interest in hobbies.
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_00: Like, over the, like I like history.
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_00: I love, I like buying clothes.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_00: I think clothes are cool.
[00:44:13] SPEAKER_00: I like cars, I like motorcycles.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_00: Like I have like hobbies where I'm like,
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_00: I'm passionate about X, Y and Z,
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_00: but I have never heard of you to like anything
[00:44:23] SPEAKER_00: other than your wife and workin' out and business.
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_01: And business, yeah, that was my big three.
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_01: I would say that I would find myself as for the first time
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_01: in 15 years, not even 15,
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_01: because I wanted to start making money when I was like 15.
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_01: So I guess it's been 21 years.
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_01: It's the first time in my life where I've been open
[00:44:44] SPEAKER_01: to having other priorities.
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_01: I don't know what they are, like straight up.
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_01: I don't know, I don't know what they will be.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_01: And maybe I'll just discover that I like the life
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_01: that I have now, but it's the first time that I've been like,
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_01: huh, I am open to this mix changing.
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_00: Andrew Ross Sorkin, he's got this new book called 1929.
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_00: I mean, in the middle of reading it,
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_00: I think you read science fiction, right?
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's just purely.
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_00: I like science fiction.
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_00: I like some of the more popular ones,
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_00: but I'm a big history guy.
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_00: And this book, 1929, it's about the great depression
[00:45:17] SPEAKER_00: and how it came to be.
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_00: And basically, credit had just become a thing.
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_00: So credit, GM invented it, so you could get a car on a loan
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_00: and then eventually other appliances on a loan.
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_00: And then Sears was like, oh, we'll do a layaway thing.
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_00: We'll give you credits, you can buy clothing.
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_00: And then Citibank, which back then was called National Bank,
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_00: they said, let's do it for stocks and bonds.
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_00: So you can borrow money and we will let you buy stocks.
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_00: And they did it at a 10 to 1 ratio, meaning for every $10
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_00: of stocks that you have with Citibank,
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_00: we're going to loan you $100.
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_00: And so the great depression happened
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_00: because when the market went under,
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_00: which happens occasionally happened during COVID,
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_00: it was just like a domino effect
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_00: because everyone was incredibly over leverage.
[00:46:02] SPEAKER_00: And he tells this amazing story about it.
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_00: And there's probably 20 characters in the book
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_00: and they're like the Jamie Diamonds of the time.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_00: And they give you the day-to-day life of these characters.
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_00: And it's really fascinating.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_00: And my biggest takeaway from this book so far,
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_00: well, there's been a bunch of takeaways.
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_00: But one takeaway is that the executives of these banks,
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_00: they didn't work that hard.
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_00: And they were like, they were in the Jamie Diamonds of the time.
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_00: And their income was the equivalent of $100 million a year.
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_00: And one guy had a routine where he's like, I'm up at six,
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_00: I'm exercise, I'm at the office at 10, I'm home by five.
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_00: Another guy had a similar routine as that,
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_00: but then he would take off,
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_00: he took summer off to go to Europe with his family
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_00: and go into Europe,
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_00: taking a three week boat.
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_00: And same with Andrew Carnegie.
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_00: Andrew Carnegie was popular in the late 1800s.
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_00: He died probably in 1920 or so.
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_00: He did the same thing where he would barely work.
[00:46:50] And I read about some of these,
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_00: like I think Brian Halligan,
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_00: who's the founder of HubSpot, just tweeted,
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_00: he's like, you don't move mountains of work in nine to five.
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_00: And all these people, yourself included,
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_00: and myself included, talk about hard work.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_00: But I like see all these other examples.
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, isn't it crazy how much you can get done
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_00: by actually not working hard?
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_00: And lately I've been interested by some of those examples.
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever read about that?
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_01: I haven't read about it,
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_01: but I've definitely observed it with some people
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_01: that are further ahead than I am.
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_01: I think what's always difficult is,
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_01: do I model the top of the mountain,
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_01: or do I model the climb?
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_01: Like, am I trying to extrapolate how someone currently lives
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_01: for what they did to get there?
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_01: And that one's always a really dangerous one,
[00:47:30] SPEAKER_01: but I try and catch myself on,
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_01: which is like, we're in different seasons.
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_01: And so I have to make sure that I'm comparing this person's spring
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_01: to my spring, not my winter to their spring.
[00:47:41] Well, like all these, I can list so many people
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_00: where I read these books,
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_00: and I'm like, you don't work hard at all.
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_00: What the hell?
[00:47:48] SPEAKER_00: It's like, what am I doing?
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_00: Like Ted Turner was another guy.
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_00: He, Ted Turner, when he built CNN,
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_00: which made him a multi-billionaire,
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_00: he was also a professional sailboat racer
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_00: where he was gone for three months at a time,
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_00: racing sailboats.
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_00: It's so, anyway, I could give you so many examples of that.
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_00: It's just crazy.
[00:48:04] Well, let's take that for a second,
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_01: because I think that like, let's say,
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_01: let's say like within your business,
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_01: let's say that you could find the perfect Sam,
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_01: just as a thought routine, right?
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_01: The perfect Sam that you could hire,
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_01: and whatever you could pay, the perfect Sam to do,
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_01: and he could do everything you can do
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_01: just as well as you can.
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_01: It's like, so whatever your current profit is,
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_01: minus Sam's compensation, if you could do that,
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_01: then you would have almost the same amount of money you have now,
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_01: and maybe in two years, perfect Sam would grow the pie,
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_01: so that you're making the same or more
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_01: than you're making right now,
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_01: but you're still not working at all.
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_01: And so if that's the case, then it's like,
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_01: we're always like in the hypothetical world,
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_01: we're one higher away from 70,
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_01: you could do 100% of what we're currently doing,
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_01: and the business would be able to continue to grow.
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_01: I think to that point about patience is like,
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_01: but most entrepreneurs are like,
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_01: well, I'll find that person, I'll give it to that person,
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_01: and then I'll start the next job,
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_01: whereas some of the people just say,
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_01: like, I'm just not gonna start that next job,
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: and then just be willing to let the company
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_01: continue to grow with the team that I've assembled.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_01: And I think both, like fundamentally,
[00:49:01] SPEAKER_01: if you work or you don't work as long as the business
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_01: performs these functions, it will grow.
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_01: I heard you say something kind of interesting,
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_00: so a lot of people shit on course makers,
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_00: and I was thinking about my life,
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_00: and like I've bought a lot of courses actually,
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_00: and many of them were not only great, they changed my life.
[00:49:20] SPEAKER_00: One of my good buddies, Neville Bedouin,
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_00: had a copywriting course, changed my life,
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_00: I took it, it changed my life,
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_00: and there's been a bunch others.
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever bought or taken any courses,
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_00: and which one, if you did, was game-changing for you?
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_00: The biggest things that have really changed my life
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_01: was actually like, had been networks of people,
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_01: more than anything, like getting in the room,
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_01: with people who were ahead of me,
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_01: within the current realm, or even across realms from me.
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_01: That was the stuff that really changed my life the most.
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_01: For sure, from the tactical level,
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_01: books, courses, things like that,
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_01: workshops, seminars, those things, absolutely.
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_01: I am a product of the alternative education world.
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_01: Like I have no reservations about that.
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_01: I am, some people were able to learn all their own.
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_01: I was willing to pay to learn for people who are ahead of me,
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_01: and it was more than worth it.
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_01: But I think that the biggest,
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_01: so basically there's two types of knowledge, right?
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_01: You have declarative knowledge, which is knowledge about stuff,
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_01: then you have a procedure knowledge,
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_01: which is knowledge how to do stuff.
[00:50:18] The courses in DIY stuff is predominantly procedural,
[00:50:23] SPEAKER_01: which is here's how you set a blank page,
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_01: you say, right copy, you hear,
[00:50:25] SPEAKER_01: so you structure a video sales letter or whatever.
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_01: And then there's, I see that the networks,
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_01: affiliations, and when you meet people
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_01: who are further ahead of you,
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_01: those are where you get their quote, belief-broken.
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_01: That's where you learn about stuff,
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_01: that you didn't know was possible.
[00:50:39] SPEAKER_01: And that about stuff could be like,
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_01: I didn't know you could work four hours a week
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_01: and make that kind of money.
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_01: I didn't know that real estate worked that way.
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_01: I didn't know that the insurance industry
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_01: was so profitable or whatever it is, right?
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_01: And those were, I think, where I had my order
[00:50:50] SPEAKER_01: of magnitude increases.
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_01: So to say my incremental increases in business
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_01: were always just developing more blocking,
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_01: tackling skills like I have to learn how to do.
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_01: Oh, webinar, I have to learn how to do a sales call.
[00:51:00] SPEAKER_01: I have to, you know, all these things.
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_01: But where the large step function increases
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_01: have been through association with people
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_01: that were just way further ahead
[00:51:08] SPEAKER_01: and were like, hey man,
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_01: let me tell you what the next five years
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_01: looks like if you keep doing what you're doing,
[00:51:11] SPEAKER_01: this we need to do instead.
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_01: Who's on your list of people who you'd kill to meet
[00:51:16] SPEAKER_00: and spend time with or shadow for a day?
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_01: That most of mine are the obvious ones.
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_01: Like I would love to, I'd love to shadow Elon.
[00:51:25] SPEAKER_01: I'd love to shadow Zuck.
[00:51:25] SPEAKER_01: I'd love to shadow Bezos.
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_01: I'd love to shadow.
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_01: Honestly, I'd love to shadow Bezos like 10 years ago.
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_01: Because actually, I'm not even sure
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_01: what his working, you know,
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_01: what he's doing next is a blue origin
[00:51:35] SPEAKER_01: and he's got, you know, I think he's got
[00:51:37] SPEAKER_01: other things going on.
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_01: But like people who are in the thick of the game,
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_01: I would love to, because a lot of it is like,
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_01: how are they like, what frameworks are they using
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_01: to think through these decisions?
[00:51:47] SPEAKER_01: Because they've made these decisions a bunch of times.
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_01: So like, I'd love to just get that framework.
[00:51:51] SPEAKER_01: Because if I could apply that to my current state,
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_01: then I would move faster.
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_01: I hear you learn these frameworks and I'm like,
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_00: bad, that is crazy that he is memorizing this stuff,
[00:52:00] SPEAKER_00: but not just memorizing it,
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_00: but he, when I hear him talk about it,
[00:52:03] SPEAKER_00: I believe that he actually uses this in his day-to-day life.
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_00: And I would like to get better at that.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_00: I'm just amazed at how much information you retain.
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_00: Thanks.
[00:52:13] SPEAKER_01: I think that if you are not good at predicting
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_01: what is going to happen next, life will be hard for you.
[00:52:19] SPEAKER_01: And the better you get at predicting
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_01: what's going to happen next, the more you will get
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_01: what you want.
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_01: And so then being able to predict what's going to happen
[00:52:27] SPEAKER_01: requires an accurate framework of how reality works.
[00:52:32] SPEAKER_01: And I think that that's where, you know,
[00:52:34] SPEAKER_01: if you've lost everything that you can rebuild it again,
[00:52:37] SPEAKER_01: it's because you accurately review it,
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_01: view reality and it wasn't luck, you can redo it again.
[00:52:42] SPEAKER_01: And so for me, I think a big part of it was like,
[00:52:45] SPEAKER_01: what the worst it is, I find like the most people
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_01: don't know what they're saying most of the time.
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_01: Like the vast majority of people spend their time regurgitating
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_01: and reparating things that they never thought about
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_01: and saying words that they don't understand.
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_01: Because if you ask someone when they say,
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_01: hey, I think you should do this,
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_01: I would just say like, define that.
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_01: Or like, hey, my goal is I want to insert thing.
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_01: Like, I want to feel great about myself.
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_01: I'd be like, well, what does that mean?
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_01: And then they can't define it.
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, well, no shit, you haven't hit it.
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_01: You can't even define what you're going for.
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_01: And so I think that the single greatest razor
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_01: that I have for defining reality more accurately
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_01: has been removing all sentiment, emotion,
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_01: and quote psychology from the equation
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_01: and only looking at it from a behaviorist frame
[00:53:34] SPEAKER_01: of what can I observe?
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_01: And just say like, and so basically,
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_01: if you were to, if you were to,
[00:53:41] SPEAKER_01: alien comes on earth or a toddler,
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_01: depending on how you want to see it and say,
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_01: hey, what does trust mean?
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_01: Like, hey, you're not very trustworthy.
[00:53:48] SPEAKER_01: I'd be like, well, what does that mean to you?
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_01: And most times people will just say like a bunch of nonsense
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_01: back to you.
[00:53:53] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, well, of course, you don't know.
[00:53:55] SPEAKER_01: And so I find that that's most people.
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_01: And that's why they can't communicate well.
[00:53:59] SPEAKER_01: And as a result, they don't receive communication well
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_01: from the world because they don't,
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_01: like it's two people saying words that neither of them
[00:54:04] SPEAKER_01: understand.
[00:54:05] SPEAKER_01: And then they just roll a dice to see
[00:54:07] SPEAKER_01: if they get what they want.
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_01: And that's how most people live their lives,
[00:54:09] SPEAKER_01: which is why they don't get what they want.
[00:54:10] SPEAKER_01: Because they didn't define what they want.
[00:54:12] SPEAKER_01: The beginning of every one of my books defines terms.
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_01: The beginning of every legal document,
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_01: there's a recitation of definitions.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, you need that in order to be precise
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_00: about what you want.
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_00: What's that mean?
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_00: So like defining what a win would look like,
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_00: what does success look like, what does a fail look like?
[00:54:25] SPEAKER_00: You know, that's, that, there's like the,
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_01: I would say like the big obvious ones.
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_01: But underneath of that is like the day to day life that you have.
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_01: It's like, you ask your wife,
[00:54:32] SPEAKER_01: it's like, I'd like you to be more loving towards me.
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, what does that mean?
[00:54:36] Like, for real, like what is,
[00:54:38] SPEAKER_01: what is you saying the word I need you to love me better?
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_01: What does that mean?
[00:54:42] Does that mean, hey, when I walk in the door,
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_01: can you come and give me a hug?
[00:54:46] SPEAKER_01: That's observable.
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_01: I can see that.
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_01: A court witness could say he came in and did that, right?
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_01: And so, but like again, this is like,
[00:54:53] SPEAKER_01: getting his granular is everything.
[00:54:55] SPEAKER_01: If we just bring everything down to what is observable
[00:54:57] SPEAKER_01: and reality that we can all get to agreement.
[00:54:59] SPEAKER_01: That's where like, I think the content that I have
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_01: somehow seems both the same and different
[00:55:04] SPEAKER_01: from the stuff that's out there.
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_01: They're like, man, I listen to him,
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_01: I always get marketing stuff.
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_01: And like he says things that I know,
[00:55:08] SPEAKER_01: but he says it in a different way.
[00:55:10] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, it's because I just think about like,
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_01: okay, well, what is selling, right?
[00:55:15] SPEAKER_01: And then a lot of people are like,
[00:55:15] SPEAKER_01: it's a transference of feeling between two parties,
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_01: you know, over a bridge of trust, right?
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_01: And I would say something like that 15 years ago.
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_01: And I would yell at it as salesman, I'd be like, dude,
[00:55:25] SPEAKER_01: sales is just a transference of belief over a bridge of trust.
[00:55:29] SPEAKER_01: It's like, that sounds amazing.
[00:55:30] SPEAKER_01: There's nice visuals.
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_01: It's like, but what the fuck does that mean?
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_01: Like, how do I go transfer belief over a bridge of trust?
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, go transfer belief over a bridge of trust.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: They're like, I don't know how to do that.
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_01: It's like, of course you don't.
[00:55:41] SPEAKER_01: Of course you don't.
[00:55:43] I don't either.
[00:55:44] SPEAKER_01: Of course you don't have.
[00:55:45] SPEAKER_01: Of course you don't have.
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_01: I need a fucking bridge.
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_01: It's got a bridge.
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_01: And how do I give them this belief, right?
[00:55:51] SPEAKER_01: And so it's natural to use,
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_01: to use shorthand with language
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_01: because it's faster transfer ideas
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_01: except me, their party to find the term.
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_01: And that's where a lot of quote,
[00:56:01] SPEAKER_01: miscommunications come from.
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_01: And so I think to be an accurate communicator,
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_01: it's like we have to define terms
[00:56:06] SPEAKER_01: before we could actually engage in this conversation,
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_01: which is annoying for some people.
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_01: But it's also required if you want to have like,
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_01: effective communication.
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_01: And so for that whole like sales person thing,
[00:56:15] SPEAKER_01: it's like, well, what is selling?
[00:56:16] SPEAKER_01: It's increasing the likelihood
[00:56:17] SPEAKER_01: that someone makes a person's decision.
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_01: Done, that's all it is.
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_01: We just increase the likelihood.
[00:56:20] SPEAKER_01: And so that is your job.
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_01: It's increased the likelihood
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_01: to make a person's decision.
[00:56:23] SPEAKER_01: And we know that there's a number of variables
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_01: that affect that percentage.
[00:56:26] SPEAKER_01: And that's what the ones that we can affect,
[00:56:28] SPEAKER_01: that we can observe.
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_01: And I think we just leave it there
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_01: that we get all of this holo blue
[00:56:32] SPEAKER_01: and all of the manifestation and the synchronities
[00:56:35] SPEAKER_01: and the energy and the men,
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_01: and all of this crap out of there.
[00:56:38] SPEAKER_01: And maybe that's stuff true,
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_01: but I can't see it.
[00:56:41] SPEAKER_01: And so how do I transfer it?
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_01: And so I just talk about the observer world
[00:56:45] SPEAKER_01: and has made my life so much better.
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_01: And my ability to predict what's going to happen next,
[00:56:50] SPEAKER_01: so much better.
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_01: But this is why I like, by the way,
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_00: Dale Carter, how to win friends and influence people.
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_00: Very tactical.
[00:56:56] SPEAKER_00: So like the takeaway that everyone will have at that book,
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_00: well, at least one of them will be,
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_00: you say someone's name.
[00:57:02] SPEAKER_00: Say someone's name,
[00:57:03] SPEAKER_00: because that's the most beautiful sound
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_00: in the English language.
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_00: Very tactical.
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_00: And another really tactical thing
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_00: that I love reading that more people should do,
[00:57:11] SPEAKER_00: particularly if you work in the internet world,
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_00: old school direct response copywriting books.
[00:57:17] SPEAKER_00: So Claude Hopkins, David Olviv,
[00:57:20] SPEAKER_00: he's a little bit newer, Joe Sugarman's a little bit newer,
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_00: Kennedy, I love reading those books.
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_00: Those books are my favorite,
[00:57:26] SPEAKER_00: because they are the most tactical,
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_00: but they also teach you about life.
[00:57:30] SPEAKER_00: You're also great writers.
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_00: You know who's the best, I think, is Felix Dennis.
[00:57:33] SPEAKER_00: Have you read Felix Dennis? How to get rich?
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:57:36] SPEAKER_00: Dude, the best writing I've ever read,
[00:57:39] SPEAKER_00: or like Dan Kennedy, who is a copywriter,
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_00: somehow he has books on like management,
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_00: which I'm like,
[00:57:46] SPEAKER_00: don't read that book.
[00:57:47] SPEAKER_00: Dude, he's like,
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_00: in the beginning, okay, so in the beginning of the book,
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_00: he's like, I don't have any employees
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_00: because I hate employees.
[00:57:54] SPEAKER_00: But let me write this long book about managing a company.
[00:57:57] SPEAKER_00: And I read it and I'm like, you are a crack, man,
[00:58:00] SPEAKER_00: but some of your advice is actually quite good,
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_00: but he's so good at telling these stories
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_00: and he makes them tactical,
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_00: which is what a really good copywriter does.
[00:58:07] SPEAKER_00: And so it becomes quite actionable.
[00:58:09] SPEAKER_00: Maybe you're gonna take the wrong action,
[00:58:11] SPEAKER_00: but it's very actionable.
[00:58:13] SPEAKER_00: Do you ever read those old school copywriting books?
[00:58:15] SPEAKER_00: No, I did one, basically when I was in my like,
[00:58:17] SPEAKER_01: Rocky Katz, even if learning marketing,
[00:58:18] SPEAKER_01: I read all that stuff.
[00:58:20] I haven't read much of it lately because I feel like,
[00:58:23] SPEAKER_01: you know, like the Midwit meme.
[00:58:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_01: I feel like the Midwit meme is one of my favorite memes
[00:58:28] SPEAKER_01: of all time because it's been so true for me
[00:58:31] SPEAKER_01: in so many domains of my life.
[00:58:33] SPEAKER_01: It's like, you know, when I started lifting,
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_01: it was like, Admiral Ray, E. Protein tri-art.
[00:58:37] SPEAKER_01: You know what I mean?
[00:58:38] SPEAKER_01: And like, do it over and over again.
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_01: And that was like, that was it, right?
[00:58:41] SPEAKER_01: And then I got into like, you know, periodization
[00:58:44] SPEAKER_01: and like, you know, volume blocks,
[00:58:45] SPEAKER_01: then, you know, peaking cycles and like, you know,
[00:58:48] SPEAKER_01: you know, we have to have undulating periods.
[00:58:50] SPEAKER_01: We have to have like, you know,
[00:58:51] SPEAKER_01: this is better for part of me,
[00:58:52] SPEAKER_01: this is better for sure.
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_01: I get all this like complexity, right?
[00:58:54] SPEAKER_01: And then like, fast forward, now it's just like,
[00:58:56] SPEAKER_01: dude, just, just E. Protein, add, add more to the bar
[00:59:00] SPEAKER_01: and, you know, thank your parents for genetics,
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_01: like whatever.
[00:59:03] SPEAKER_01: Now, of course, the comments will be like,
[00:59:04] SPEAKER_01: and Alex takes testosterone,
[00:59:05] SPEAKER_01: which I've been public about, so deal with it.
[00:59:07] SPEAKER_01: And so I think the same thing with marketing.
[00:59:09] SPEAKER_01: And so like, a lot of it is-
[00:59:11] SPEAKER_01: Did your testosterone make you more Persian?
[00:59:13] SPEAKER_01: Was it Persian testosterone?
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:59:16] SPEAKER_00: Maybe I think it's all just that I can compare.
[00:59:17] SPEAKER_00: Is that the PET is being bored Persian?
[00:59:20] SPEAKER_00: If anything, I think the testosterone
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_01: would decrease the amount of hair I have on my head at least.
[00:59:26] SPEAKER_01: But anyways, but like with marketing,
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: it's like, it's so much, like no persuasion occurs in the vague.
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_01: Like persuasion occurs in the specific.
[00:59:36] SPEAKER_01: And so when it's like, oh, I knew he'd, he just,
[00:59:38] SPEAKER_01: like if you can articulate someone's pain to them,
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_01: more accurately than they can,
[00:59:44] SPEAKER_01: they will buy what you have to sell
[00:59:46] SPEAKER_01: without even hearing much about whatever your offer is.
[00:59:49] SPEAKER_01: If someone describes every pain in your life
[00:59:51] SPEAKER_01: and excruciating detail, they're like,
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_01: if this guy knows this much about my pain,
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_01: he has to know how to solve it.
[00:59:56] SPEAKER_01: And what's also nice about pain specifically
[00:59:58] SPEAKER_01: is that pain is more motivating than promise.
[01:00:01] SPEAKER_01: And so it's also more compliant.
[01:00:03] SPEAKER_01: Because if we think about like what,
[01:00:04] SPEAKER_01: like what is a salesperson, what is marketing in general?
[01:00:07] SPEAKER_01: Like we just simply motivate someone to take action.
[01:00:09] SPEAKER_01: I re-increased the likelihood
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_01: that they'll wait to see this message,
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_01: they take it desired action.
[01:00:12] SPEAKER_01: And so it's like, well then where is the basis
[01:00:14] SPEAKER_01: of motivation comfort, which is a super complex question?
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_01: And so for me, motivation comes from deprivation.
[01:00:20] SPEAKER_01: And we have to deprive the prospect
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_01: or increase their perception of deprivation around
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_01: the action that's associated with whatever thing
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_01: that we want them to do.
[01:00:32] SPEAKER_01: Or set the outcome associated with the reaction
[01:00:33] SPEAKER_01: we want them to take.
[01:00:34] SPEAKER_01: And so that comes from like when people were like,
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_01: the pain is the pitch, which is one of my little isms,
[01:00:38] SPEAKER_01: it's like the pain is the pitch.
[01:00:39] SPEAKER_01: Like if you can accurately do that,
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_01: and it's not about like fancy words,
[01:00:44] SPEAKER_01: it's not at all, it's short words, short sentences,
[01:00:48] SPEAKER_01: clearly defined that it takes no brain power to process.
[01:00:52] SPEAKER_01: And yet it still has emotional resonance
[01:00:54] SPEAKER_01: because of this specificity.
[01:00:56] SPEAKER_01: So like lose weight fast probably worked
[01:00:58] SPEAKER_01: as the first weight loss ad in 1930.
[01:01:00] SPEAKER_01: And then everyone was like, wow, that's short words,
[01:01:03] SPEAKER_01: that's amazing.
[01:01:04] SPEAKER_01: But then they had to get like more nuanced.
[01:01:05] SPEAKER_01: And so it's like you just have to keep breaking words down
[01:01:08] SPEAKER_01: into like, what does that really mean?
[01:01:10] SPEAKER_01: Like it's like, what is like,
[01:01:12] SPEAKER_01: have you ever been like the overweight girl
[01:01:14] SPEAKER_00: who wanted to take the photo instead of being the photo?
[01:01:18] SPEAKER_00: You know what I mean?
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:20] SPEAKER_00: No, and that's real.
[01:01:21] SPEAKER_01: Like I've ever walked around the same thing.
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_01: Your thighs shaped together.
[01:01:24] SPEAKER_01: Have you ever always had a cover all
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_01: when your friends were in bikini?
[01:01:27] SPEAKER_01: Like have you felt weird about, you know,
[01:01:29] SPEAKER_01: you putting your own sunscreen on?
[01:01:30] SPEAKER_01: Have you been like, in pictures, you said like,
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_01: do you duck out?
[01:01:33] SPEAKER_01: When you put your pants on that you used to wear,
[01:01:36] SPEAKER_01: do you keep, do you find yourself holding your breath
[01:01:38] SPEAKER_01: for longer and longer in order to put them on?
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_01: Like those are best, you know, specifics.
[01:01:43] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:01:43] SPEAKER_01: And like that's where copy is driven,
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_01: which is why you have to know the customer,
[01:01:46] SPEAKER_01: which is why my opinion, some of the best marketers,
[01:01:49] SPEAKER_01: like the truly goaded marketers can advertise pain
[01:01:52] SPEAKER_01: that they have not experienced.
[01:01:54] SPEAKER_01: But the vast majority of marketers
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_01: who are good in specific spaces know the avatar
[01:01:58] SPEAKER_01: because they are the avatar or at least were the avatar.
[01:02:01] SPEAKER_00: One time we, I had this designer,
[01:02:03] SPEAKER_00: and when I lived in San Francisco
[01:02:04] SPEAKER_00: working for my company, the hustle,
[01:02:06] SPEAKER_00: and we had this like new product that we were testing.
[01:02:09] SPEAKER_00: It was like $300 a year,
[01:02:11] SPEAKER_00: and she made this beautiful page.
[01:02:12] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, you guys are insane.
[01:02:15] SPEAKER_00: The design of this means nothing.
[01:02:16] SPEAKER_00: And they're like, what do you mean?
[01:02:17] SPEAKER_00: I was like, I spent so long at this logo.
[01:02:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, oh my God, watch this.
[01:02:22] SPEAKER_00: And I like rode out a Google Doc
[01:02:24] SPEAKER_00: and then I, at the bottom of the Google Doc,
[01:02:26] SPEAKER_00: I had a link to an event for a event break page
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_00: because that was the fastest way I could create.
[01:02:30] SPEAKER_00: Like I was like, this isn't actually an event,
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_00: but it's just the easiest way that I can accept your money.
[01:02:35] SPEAKER_00: And once I get your money,
[01:02:36] SPEAKER_00: then I'm gonna send you the product manually.
[01:02:38] SPEAKER_00: The most jankiest thing ever.
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_00: We drove something like $5,000 of Facebook ads
[01:02:44] SPEAKER_00: to each of the things.
[01:02:46] SPEAKER_00: The pretty one drove, it was like next to nothing.
[01:02:49] SPEAKER_00: Just the Google Doc, I made $50,000 off of,
[01:02:52] SPEAKER_00: I think only $5,000 an ad spend.
[01:02:54] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, please listen to me.
[01:02:57] SPEAKER_00: Copy matters more than anything.
[01:02:59] SPEAKER_00: Now, if you can marry, copy with good design,
[01:03:01] SPEAKER_00: then that's ideal.
[01:03:03] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, go and look at,
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_00: I was like, I don't know, man.
[01:03:06] SPEAKER_00: Go look at like Apple's page for the iPhone.
[01:03:10] SPEAKER_00: Like it's the most known product of all time.
[01:03:11] SPEAKER_00: There's tons of words and also there's tons of images.
[01:03:14] SPEAKER_00: And image, it really is where the thousand words.
[01:03:16] SPEAKER_00: Or I was like, go look at Kindle.
[01:03:18] SPEAKER_00: Go look at the Amazon listing for Kindle.
[01:03:20] SPEAKER_00: You literally only see copy.
[01:03:22] SPEAKER_00: There's 10,000 reviews and it's just copy, copy, copy.
[01:03:25] SPEAKER_00: Copy is the way to go.
[01:03:26] SPEAKER_00: And I was trying to advance my team.
[01:03:28] SPEAKER_00: And that was like the final example.
[01:03:29] SPEAKER_00: I was like, I told you, just good words can sell way better
[01:03:33] SPEAKER_00: than anything else.
[01:03:34] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I agree.
[01:03:35] SPEAKER_01: Also, I actually think that that's true as content as well.
[01:03:37] SPEAKER_01: If you're an educator to be clear,
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_01: if you're an entertainer, that's different.
[01:03:40] SPEAKER_01: But like if you're an educator, which most,
[01:03:42] SPEAKER_01: be to be anybody's a business,
[01:03:44] SPEAKER_01: whatever, most businesses are,
[01:03:46] SPEAKER_01: if they make content is more on the educational side,
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_01: whether you're a plumber or otherwise,
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_01: like you tell people about toilets
[01:03:51] SPEAKER_01: and then people might start fright.
[01:03:52] SPEAKER_01: I did this experiment with my team
[01:03:54] SPEAKER_01: because sometimes my editing team gets like,
[01:03:56] SPEAKER_01: they get cute, they want to get fancy.
[01:03:59] SPEAKER_01: So I said, hey, this next one,
[01:04:00] SPEAKER_01: we're going to do the entire thing on an iPhone.
[01:04:02] SPEAKER_01: All right, so the whole thing is on an iPhone.
[01:04:04] SPEAKER_01: The audio's crap.
[01:04:05] SPEAKER_01: It's shaky.
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_01: A guy's holding it.
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_01: No tripod.
[01:04:08] SPEAKER_01: That's all it was.
[01:04:09] SPEAKER_01: But it was just about like a concept
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_01: that I knew was going to do really well.
[01:04:13] SPEAKER_01: And it got like 1.7 or something,
[01:04:15] SPEAKER_01: almost 2 million views from that video.
[01:04:18] And as like, we spend so much time and post
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_01: on some of these videos and like, it doesn't matter.
[01:04:25] SPEAKER_01: Now, it might matter a little bit.
[01:04:27] SPEAKER_01: It might matter 10%, but are we appropriately,
[01:04:31] SPEAKER_01: I'm probably allocating the resources towards the thing
[01:04:33] SPEAKER_01: that's going to get us the highest return.
[01:04:34] SPEAKER_01: And the answer is almost always no
[01:04:35] SPEAKER_01: because the words are the hard one.
[01:04:37] The words you have to think.
[01:04:39] And that's what most people avoid.
[01:04:40] SPEAKER_00: You know, last time we talked was about 10 days ago,
[01:04:42] SPEAKER_00: or something like that.
[01:04:43] SPEAKER_00: And I needed someone to,
[01:04:46] SPEAKER_00: I wanted to talk to you today
[01:04:47] SPEAKER_00: because I enjoyed their conversation.
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, I don't want to plan.
[01:04:49] SPEAKER_00: I just want to have a conversation with Alex
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_00: and like, Ari made a joke.
[01:04:53] SPEAKER_00: She was like, I want you to talk in soundbites.
[01:04:54] SPEAKER_00: I was like, that's the exact opposite of what I want.
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_00: I don't want you to talk at any soundbites.
[01:04:57] SPEAKER_00: I just want to see what's up and just catch up with you.
[01:05:00] SPEAKER_00: And I'm happy we did that.
[01:05:02] No, I am too, man.
[01:05:03] SPEAKER_01: If you want, I can just read like five tweets in a row
[01:05:05] SPEAKER_01: and then Sam can react.
[01:05:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're a fortune cookie.
[01:05:09] SPEAKER_01: That's what you want.
[01:05:09] SPEAKER_01: You're a fortune cookie.
[01:05:10] SPEAKER_01: Would that be better?
[01:05:11] SPEAKER_01: I'll just read.
[01:05:12] SPEAKER_01: Wait, so is that really your writing process?
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_00: Do you just like write like one sentences?
[01:05:18] SPEAKER_00: Well, for tweets, yes.
[01:05:21] SPEAKER_01: That's exactly what it is.
[01:05:23] SPEAKER_01: Like literally, that's 100% one.
[01:05:25] SPEAKER_01: Do you use chat GBT?
[01:05:27] No.
[01:05:27] No.
[01:05:28] SPEAKER_01: I don't use an AI for the tweets.
[01:05:31] SPEAKER_01: Come on, you dazzle me.
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_01: Why not die me with some lines?
[01:05:35] SPEAKER_01: Either sell extremely expensive to a select few
[01:05:39] SPEAKER_01: or sell something super cheap to everyone.
[01:05:40] SPEAKER_01: The middle is where people die.
[01:05:42] SPEAKER_01: You're making me weaker than knees, Alex.
[01:05:44] SPEAKER_01: Keep going.
[01:05:45] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:05:46] SPEAKER_01: Poor people stay poor because they want a fast way
[01:05:48] SPEAKER_01: to get rich.
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_01: If you're in your 20s and want to stand out,
[01:05:51] SPEAKER_01: do what you say you're going to do,
[01:05:52] SPEAKER_01: even if no one is there to give you a plus.
[01:05:55] The fastest way to stand out is to put in more effort
[01:05:57] SPEAKER_01: than everyone else.
[01:05:58] SPEAKER_01: Show up early, use names.
[01:05:59] SPEAKER_01: Do your research at a time.
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_01: Smile when you greet people.
[01:06:01] SPEAKER_01: Do more than your fair share.
[01:06:03] SPEAKER_01: Follow up quickly.
[01:06:04] SPEAKER_01: Work ethic is the universal currency respect
[01:06:06] SPEAKER_01: and it costs you nothing but can give you everything.
[01:06:08] SPEAKER_01: That was a Facebook post of yours the other day.
[01:06:10] SPEAKER_01: I liked it.
[01:06:11] SPEAKER_01: Well, they repurposed it from my Twitter.
[01:06:13] SPEAKER_01: You must first become misunderstood
[01:06:15] SPEAKER_01: before you can become great.
[01:06:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, man, these are great.
[01:06:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, how to win.
[01:06:19] SPEAKER_01: Realize no one is coming to save you.
[01:06:21] SPEAKER_01: Take responsibility for your current position.
[01:06:23] SPEAKER_01: People are in a sacrifice who you are
[01:06:24] SPEAKER_01: for who you want to be.
[01:06:25] The fastest way to become confident
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_01: is to build evidence.
[01:06:28] SPEAKER_01: Build yourself a stack of unniable proof
[01:06:30] SPEAKER_01: that you are who you say you are.
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_01: Do so much volume that you don't have to doubt
[01:06:33] SPEAKER_01: whether you can do it or not.
[01:06:34] SPEAKER_01: That one broke the internet.
[01:06:36] Yeah.
[01:06:37] SPEAKER_01: It's very hard to have a vision when you have bills to pay.
[01:06:41] I said that one at the workshop
[01:06:42] SPEAKER_01: and the whole room lit out like an audible gasp
[01:06:44] SPEAKER_01: and so the team was like, all right, that one's pre-tested.
[01:06:47] SPEAKER_01: We know that one wouldn't work.
[01:06:48] SPEAKER_00: That one was a freestyle.
[01:06:50] SPEAKER_01: That was a riff.
[01:06:51] SPEAKER_01: You roded out that one.
[01:06:52] SPEAKER_01: That's a bunch of these words.
[01:06:53] SPEAKER_01: But that one was like word for word.
[01:06:54] SPEAKER_01: I didn't change anything.
[01:06:55] SPEAKER_01: Fast way to change your life is to get around people
[01:06:57] SPEAKER_01: whose minimum standards are your life goals.
[01:06:59] SPEAKER_01: And I like what we were talking about earlier.
[01:07:01] Friendly reminder that feeling lost, anxious,
[01:07:03] SPEAKER_01: and uncertain are good signs.
[01:07:05] SPEAKER_01: It means you're pushing past where you know.
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_01: They're called growing pains for a reason.
[01:07:10] SPEAKER_01: Do the work tired?
[01:07:11] SPEAKER_01: Do the work nervous?
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_01: Do the work imperfectly?
[01:07:13] SPEAKER_01: Do the work even when you don't feel like it?
[01:07:14] SPEAKER_01: Because no matter how bad you feel when you start,
[01:07:17] SPEAKER_01: you know exactly how you feel when you finish.
[01:07:19] SPEAKER_01: You have to risk looking broke to get rich.
[01:07:21] SPEAKER_01: You have to risk looking weak to get strong.
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_01: You have to risk looking desperate to get loved.
[01:07:26] SPEAKER_01: You go as hold back more dreams
[01:07:28] SPEAKER_01: than failure and rejection ever will.
[01:07:30] Everything, like you just speak in like ad headlines.
[01:07:33] SPEAKER_01: This is amazing.
[01:07:35] SPEAKER_01: Avoiding people who make it harder for you
[01:07:37] SPEAKER_01: to achieve your goals is the highest form of self-care.
[01:07:40] SPEAKER_01: What do you write out this on?
[01:07:42] I just do like an automation tool,
[01:07:44] SPEAKER_01: like just a generic one.
[01:07:45] SPEAKER_01: Also one of the ways that I'll do it is,
[01:07:47] SPEAKER_01: nicely, like a lot of my audience will like hear
[01:07:49] SPEAKER_01: a last year or whatever.
[01:07:50] SPEAKER_01: And then they'll like, they'll tag me in a quote
[01:07:53] SPEAKER_01: that they heard me say.
[01:07:55] SPEAKER_01: And then I'll be like, oh, great.
[01:07:56] SPEAKER_01: So I like quote them quoting me.
[01:07:59] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, as my true, I'm like,
[01:08:01] SPEAKER_01: oh, they thought that was good.
[01:08:01] SPEAKER_01: So I'll just say that.
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_01: It's like Michael Scott doing the Wayne Retsie quote.
[01:08:06] SPEAKER_01: Well, I think some of it, like,
[01:08:07] SPEAKER_01: because part of what we're talking about is rhetoric, right?
[01:08:09] SPEAKER_01: There's the idea and then there's how you communicate it.
[01:08:11] SPEAKER_01: And some of these things have like rhythm to them.
[01:08:14] SPEAKER_01: So it's like, when you have opposites,
[01:08:15] SPEAKER_01: you have good and then bad, you have high and then low,
[01:08:18] SPEAKER_01: you've given and then get, like there's opposites
[01:08:21] SPEAKER_01: that happen in contrast that happens in the words.
[01:08:24] SPEAKER_01: There's typically power in threes.
[01:08:25] SPEAKER_01: People like having threes when you have sets,
[01:08:28] SPEAKER_01: repetition, alliteration.
[01:08:31] SPEAKER_01: There's all things that like, if you're thinking about like,
[01:08:33] SPEAKER_01: okay, how can I say this in a way that would sound better
[01:08:35] SPEAKER_01: than just like, hey, do hard stuff.
[01:08:37] SPEAKER_01: What partitation of that can I combine
[01:08:40] SPEAKER_01: some of these other kind of writing elements into it
[01:08:42] SPEAKER_01: to make it easier to remember?
[01:08:44] SPEAKER_01: I think you were talking about the Midwit meme.
[01:08:46] SPEAKER_00: I was joking with Sean where I was like,
[01:08:49] SPEAKER_00: in the beginning of my career,
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_00: I listened to all motivational stuff and self-help stuff.
[01:08:53] SPEAKER_00: And then like when I was building my first company
[01:08:55] SPEAKER_00: that kind of made me get a little something,
[01:08:59] SPEAKER_00: I did not do anything.
[01:09:00] SPEAKER_00: I was like, no motivation stuff.
[01:09:01] SPEAKER_00: I just need to get to it.
[01:09:02] SPEAKER_00: Now that like, I call this like second mountain stuff,
[01:09:05] SPEAKER_00: which is like, I'm now focused on thriving,
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_00: but also raising good family and like,
[01:09:10] SPEAKER_00: building a legacy of a company.
[01:09:12] SPEAKER_00: I'm not particularly, I mean, getting riches
[01:09:14] SPEAKER_00: or making more money, that is a nice,
[01:09:16] SPEAKER_00: I want that, no doubt about it, but it's like not number one.
[01:09:19] SPEAKER_00: And once I'm in that phase of my life,
[01:09:20] SPEAKER_00: which I am, I am back to the motivational stuff.
[01:09:24] SPEAKER_00: Totally.
[01:09:25] SPEAKER_01: I think when we change goals,
[01:09:27] SPEAKER_01: we become deprived around some other thing.
[01:09:29] SPEAKER_01: Like we notice a discrepancy in our lives.
[01:09:31] SPEAKER_01: And I think we saw for the greatest discrepancy.
[01:09:33] SPEAKER_01: So like in the beginning, like the biggest discrepancy
[01:09:35] SPEAKER_01: was for me, it was like, I'm broke, dude.
[01:09:36] SPEAKER_01: It's like, it doesn't matter what, like I'm broke.
[01:09:38] SPEAKER_01: I can't do anything, I can't do facts, I can't support family,
[01:09:40] SPEAKER_01: I can't live, I can't live, I want to live.
[01:09:43] SPEAKER_01: Like I just all of that.
[01:09:44] SPEAKER_01: So that becomes the glaring hot pain in my life.
[01:09:48] SPEAKER_01: And then like once that's solved, it's like, okay,
[01:09:49] SPEAKER_01: well, what I'm not pain-free, right?
[01:09:52] SPEAKER_01: Like there's still pain.
[01:09:53] SPEAKER_01: And so then you have other things
[01:09:55] SPEAKER_01: that become the pains of your life.
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_01: And those become the things that you're deprived of.
[01:09:58] SPEAKER_01: I do think that we're exceptionally good at finding problems.
[01:10:00] SPEAKER_01: So I don't think that's going to let go.
[01:10:02] SPEAKER_01: I think you just get different problems as you level up.
[01:10:04] SPEAKER_01: And I will also say like on a personal note,
[01:10:08] I'm about as happy as I was two years ago,
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_01: as I was probably two years before that.
[01:10:13] SPEAKER_01: Like I'm not like materially different
[01:10:14] SPEAKER_01: in terms of my like subjective wellbeing.
[01:10:16] SPEAKER_01: And so I think it's like, well, what else am I going to do?
[01:10:22] SPEAKER_01: And when I also think about these things that quote,
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_01: you know, could potentially stress me out
[01:10:25] SPEAKER_01: or even these opportunities that I want to pursue,
[01:10:27] SPEAKER_01: I try to fast forward the president,
[01:10:28] SPEAKER_01: which is like, I'll probably be just about
[01:10:30] SPEAKER_01: as happy and content as I am now,
[01:10:31] SPEAKER_01: which also eliminates a lot of the fomo,
[01:10:33] SPEAKER_01: which I think some people suffer from a lot of regrets
[01:10:35] SPEAKER_01: of like, oh, I should have done that thing
[01:10:37] SPEAKER_01: or I should have done that up this opportunity
[01:10:38] SPEAKER_01: or should have made that better.
[01:10:39] SPEAKER_01: I should have dated that girl or whatever your thing is, right?
[01:10:42] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, you probably be about as happy
[01:10:44] SPEAKER_01: or unhappy as you are right now.
[01:10:46] SPEAKER_01: And that actually like has dramatically quelled down
[01:10:48] SPEAKER_01: the amount of attention that I allocate
[01:10:50] SPEAKER_01: to those paths not taken
[01:10:52] SPEAKER_01: because they're just completely unproductive.
[01:10:54] Yeah, but I think people get there.
[01:10:55] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm so happy.
[01:10:57] SPEAKER_00: I've never been happier in my whole entire life right now.
[01:11:00] SPEAKER_00: I like my job.
[01:11:01] SPEAKER_00: I love my family.
[01:11:02] SPEAKER_00: I'm happy with my fitness.
[01:11:04] SPEAKER_00: I like living where I live.
[01:11:05] SPEAKER_00: I love my unit, my apartment where I live.
[01:11:07] SPEAKER_00: I love living near my in-laws.
[01:11:09] SPEAKER_00: I like my team.
[01:11:10] SPEAKER_00: And you know, Aristotle has this idea of flourishing
[01:11:13] SPEAKER_00: where he was like, you have to live a virtuous life.
[01:11:15] SPEAKER_00: And like one of the virtues is courage.
[01:11:17] SPEAKER_00: On one end of courage is like being reckless
[01:11:19] SPEAKER_00: and the other one is being like a pussy.
[01:11:21] SPEAKER_00: Like to be, I think that's what he said.
[01:11:23] SPEAKER_00: That's right.
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_00: That's an example.
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[01:11:27] SPEAKER_00: And there's like 14 virtues
[01:11:29] SPEAKER_00: and like you want to like be in the middle,
[01:11:30] SPEAKER_00: like which is courage.
[01:11:33] SPEAKER_00: Same with like being charitable.
[01:11:34] SPEAKER_00: You know, you don't want to be like ostentatious
[01:11:36] SPEAKER_00: and you don't want to be tight.
[01:11:37] SPEAKER_00: You want to be charitable.
[01:11:38] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, I'm kind of in that right now.
[01:11:41] SPEAKER_00: I love that.
[01:11:42] SPEAKER_00: And so I'm happier than I've ever been.
[01:11:44] SPEAKER_00: And I think that you have to get in what Aristotle
[01:11:46] SPEAKER_00: also says is you need money to do that.
[01:11:48] SPEAKER_00: He was like, you don't need a lot of money,
[01:11:49] SPEAKER_00: but you need enough money to own things
[01:11:51] SPEAKER_00: that make you happy, that are beautiful.
[01:11:52] SPEAKER_00: And you also need enough time to have leisure time
[01:11:54] SPEAKER_00: because leisure time's important.
[01:11:56] SPEAKER_00: And what's interesting is like you're saying like
[01:11:59] SPEAKER_00: that you're, I think you said you're happy right now,
[01:12:01] SPEAKER_00: but you said you're not going to be happier
[01:12:02] SPEAKER_00: probably with anything else.
[01:12:04] SPEAKER_00: I would argue it sounds like you're looking
[01:12:06] SPEAKER_00: for leisure time actually, which is I didn't really,
[01:12:09] SPEAKER_00: I didn't realize that until just now
[01:12:10] SPEAKER_00: since talking about Aristotle.
[01:12:12] SPEAKER_00: Like that's the way the one thing,
[01:12:13] SPEAKER_00: like hobbies is basically what he said.
[01:12:15] SPEAKER_00: Like you need a hobby.
[01:12:16] SPEAKER_00: And business has been your hobby for a long time.
[01:12:18] SPEAKER_00: But maybe like maybe that'd be kind of fun
[01:12:21] SPEAKER_00: to see like what is actually your hobby going to be?
[01:12:23] SPEAKER_00: I think I'll probably, I'll probably,
[01:12:25] SPEAKER_01: like I am happiest when I write.
[01:12:27] Yeah.
[01:12:28] SPEAKER_01: I'll probably write a book that has no
[01:12:32] SPEAKER_01: real financial benefit for me.
[01:12:34] SPEAKER_01: So I'll probably end up writing a book
[01:12:36] SPEAKER_01: about some of the topics we talked about today
[01:12:37] SPEAKER_01: around like learning and behavior
[01:12:39] SPEAKER_01: because it's something that I'm endlessly fascinated by.
[01:12:43] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's like the defining terms.
[01:12:45] SPEAKER_01: I think that will be something that I will write.
[01:12:48] SPEAKER_01: And I think it has the potential
[01:12:49] SPEAKER_01: to change more people lives
[01:12:51] SPEAKER_01: than all the other books put together.
[01:12:52] SPEAKER_01: But we'll see.
[01:12:53] SPEAKER_01: Dude, I'm so happy you came on.
[01:12:55] SPEAKER_00: All right, that's it, that's the part.
