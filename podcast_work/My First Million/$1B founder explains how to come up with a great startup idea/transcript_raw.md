[00:00:00] Jamie created Ring Glorbell.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_00: You sold it like a billion dollars, right?
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_00: 1.15.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: The part after his decimal point is worth more than our entire career so far.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_00: I want to brainstorm business ideas with you.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_00: I want to see how you think.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_02: Is there a five or 10 billion dollar company hiding in the bug space?
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_02: Probably there it.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_02: You said I just don't know how to stop.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_01: And sometimes it's not smart and it costs me.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're going to make me cry, Sam.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_02: You're going to do this.
[00:00:31] So Sean, listen, if you're like me, you woke up this morning, you rolled out of bed.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: You checked businessinsider.com and you read this amazing article about Jamie.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: And it just says, I'm Jamie and I'm the CEO of Ring.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_01: And I have the world's worst morning routine.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: And it's a whole article about how he rolls out of bed.
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_01: He scrolls his phone for about four hours.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_02: Everything he says you shouldn't do.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_02: Like immediately like all the wrong shit, like everything.
[00:00:57] That was the whole article about how Jamie has the world's worst routine.
[00:01:02] Good PR strategy, right?
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_00: Like they sit down with you and they're like, hey, we need to get some cool like tech billionaire
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_00: weirdo stuff.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_00: What he got?
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_00: And you're like, nope, don't have anything.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_00: So they're going to use that.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_00: The average guy from Missouri.
[00:01:15] Are you from Missouri?
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_02: I'm from New Jersey, but I tell people I'm from Missouri now because I have this farm
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_02: in Missouri and I've decided that there's no reason why you can't just be from Missouri.
[00:01:26] Guess where I'm from, Jamie.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: Do you just look at me and guess?
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_01: Missouri.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_01: I'm from Missouri, my friend.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: Where?
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: St. Louis.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: So my farm is in Lebel, Missouri.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_02: So I'm in, I'm from Missouri.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_02: You're from Missouri.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_02: You're more like a city folk, but we are two and a half hours north of St. Louis.
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_02: Dude, I love how he just out-masered you even though you were actually born and raised
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: there.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: And he just said, you're a city slicker.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: Not a real true, Missouriian.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: We don't like you folk.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_00: Like, you going to like Tony Supranoh and being like, actually, Tony, it's brisketta.
[00:02:01] So let me tee this up.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_00: So I did a call with Jamie and it was super fun.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_00: Jamie created, if you've ever seen a doorbell that has a camera on it.
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_00: This is the inventor.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: This is the man who did it.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: He created Ring Doorbell, grew it, sold it to Amazon for tons of money.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, hey, I want to kind of have you on the podcast and brainstorm business
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: ideas with you.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_00: I want to see how you think how do you approach businesses.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: And he's like, I believe, I don't know the exact quote, but it was something like, you
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: know, ideas are like my drug of choice.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: And he's like, I have this list on my phone of like thousands of ideas.
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_00: Which one do you want?
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[00:02:38] And so I want to do that.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_00: Sam, you saw the doc that he sent over, which just gives us kind of bullet point ideas.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: We don't know what he's going to say, but bullet point ideas.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: Where do you want to start?
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: Wait, wait.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_00: Can I ask a question before we get in?
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_00: How much?
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: You sold it for like a billion dollars, right?
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_02: Oh, 1.15.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_02: But I mean, if you want to run, you can round down if you want to.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_02: I mean, okay.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: So we're talking to a guy who, you know, you have a billion dollar company in the park.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_01: What after his decimal point is worth more than our entire career so far?
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_00: I think he just pointed out.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: I did sell it for a billion when a billion was a lot of money.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_02: Just back with Billion was cool.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_02: Back with a billion was actually like, you could buy more than a cup of coffee with it.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_00: Well, can we actually go to that story?
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: Do you remember kind of where you?
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: I guess I've always cared about two things.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: One was there a good negotiation story or like a throwout of number story of like, how
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: do you arrive at that 1.15 billion?
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_00: And then like, how did that go come about?
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: I mean, what was cool with Amazon is, you know, from the, the, we had been working with
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_02: them on stuff for years.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_02: So I actually went to Amazon and showed this guy Nick Camoros the ring before we launched
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_02: ring because we had been talking to him.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_02: They were with Alexa and stuff.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_02: They were looking at sort of, they were trying to reach out to all the small IOT people
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_02: at the time.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_02: They had a little hardware things bubbling up.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_02: So I even like literally like brought them the first one and showed it to him.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_02: So we had been working together for a long time.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_02: We were very like aligned on like mission, what we're trying to do.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: They started to look at video realizing like with Alexa, they had, you know, the kind
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_02: of the call it the ears in the home.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_02: And they started to see the eyes and saw what we were doing.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_02: We had this, you know, kind of like dating awkward because we would talk all the time.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_02: We'd meet and, you know, Nick said, let me come down and let's have lunch, which was
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_02: kind of not that abnormal.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_02: And we're seeing there, Nick's like, you know, we should kind of go to the next level here.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_02: And it was this like very funny like dating conversation of like, you know, it's like
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_02: where you don't want to just like jump out and be like, okay, let's do it.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_02: You know, it's like, and it's like, do what?
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_02: You know, so it's like we keep going back for it like, to you mean?
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_02: And he's like, yeah, and I'm like, to and like we kept going.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: And then he finally said, yeah, like it's time we should combine and, you know, not
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_02: a merger of equals by the way, but that Amazon should buy you.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_02: What was your revenue then, you know, we were, we said that was 2017.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_02: So we that year we did 480 million.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
[00:04:54] So you guys were just huge.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_01: Was it a profitable business or were you burning money and you had to figure out?
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: So it was so interesting is like, it was the, like the, like the, of each, like the
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_02: individual customer economics were insanely good.
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_02: So the, the, the, the fund, like the fundamentals of the business, like the actual, like business
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_02: was good.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_02: It was growing so fast that like money was just being lit on fire everywhere.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_02: And it's not that we, like we, we had crappy offices, like it's just, you have to hire
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: so fast to get ahead.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_02: It's just about a customer service.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_02: When you're growing it like 500% a year.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_02: And if customer service takes three to six months, like a person you hire to get up to
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_02: speed, that means you're hiring like two to three X.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_02: Like you need at that exact time.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_02: Just so that you can like not blow up as people are buying and the growth.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_02: So you're just, you're just like putting out all this cash to do this stuff.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_02: So I mean, you start to think about it.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_02: It's like, it sounds cool.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_02: But then like when you're doing 170 million and you're ordering for 480 million, it means
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_02: like if anything slows down, I mean, you are just like, you're dead.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_02: It's like on one side, yeah, I'm sitting there with Nick and I have this, I have a 480 million
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_02: dollar your business that's growing, you know, triple digits still, like literally triple
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_02: digits at that scale, which is insane.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_02: And the other side is like, and I'm going out of business every day.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_02: Like every day I'm facing basically like the wall.
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_02: Like we're going to hit the wall.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_02: And the only way to stop that is you raise a little money, you get a little financing.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_02: Something else comes in like so it was getting to a point where I just couldn't handle it.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_02: I was, you know, I was sort of, the stress was getting to me.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it was, you know, it was years of just like that.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_02: And then we kind of got into, you know, starting to get into negotiation during the negotiation.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_02: And so I wrote this book and part of why I wrote the book is like, this story, I mean,
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_02: it's like a bit of a longer story, which is why a book is good.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_02: But during the negotiation, I get sued by ADT, probably for something that was a little
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_02: bit self-induced to be fair, they win an injunction.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_02: And literally, I mean, and this is like how, like you can't make this up.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_02: Nick calls me and he's, you know, you, I'm going to send you a term sheet over, you know,
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_02: tomorrow morning just FYI.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_02: Great.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_02: An hour later, the injunction hits us.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_02: I have to call Nick back and be like, hey, just FYI, like not a big deal at all.
[00:07:18] Doesn't, you know, shouldn't matter, like shouldn't matter at all.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_02: But like just like as an FYI, we did get an injunction from ADT on this lawsuit and he's
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_02: like, dude, we're out.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[00:07:29] And what does that mean?
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_02: So ADT was suing you for what?
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_01: So we had been building an alarm.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_02: They had a, like a company that they had some part of that they were sort of invested
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_02: in that was building it.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_02: They stopped funding it.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_02: The company went out of basically shut down.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_02: I hired all the people from there.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_02: They told me I couldn't hire all the people from there.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_02: I told them in a very respectful way.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_02: You know, I said, like, you know, please and thank yous.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_02: Now I was like, I total ass hole and I was like, so dumb.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_02: And I just like, again, I, I, you poke the bear.
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_02: I poke the bear.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_02: And it's like looking back.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_02: It's funny because it's the same like insanity and passion that like gets a company to go
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_02: from 170 to 480 is also the person that blows it up.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_02: It's like, you know, it is like the demolition man of like, you know, the same person that
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_02: can use the demolition to like clear the way for the road is also who can like blow
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_02: everything up for everyone.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_02: It's my favorite Elon thing of all time when he goes and sat in that live and he goes,
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: you know, I took all my money and I spent it on trying to get rockets that will take us
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: to Mars and electric cars.
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: And he's like, what did you think?
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: I would just be a normal chill, dude.
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, oh, actually, that explains so much.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: Of course, we can't have one.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: We can't have mad genius.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_00: And then also, you know, stable, respectful, peaceful, reasonable man over here.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: It can't be unreasonable and one area and totally reasonable in the other.
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's the problem.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_02: It's like, it's just true.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_02: Like if you want to do something, I mean, Ring is one in a whatever generation company.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_02: And like I say that as someone who like looks at it and I can't believe I'm even part
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: of it.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_02: Like it's incredible.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it's a verb.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_02: Like people just call it a ring.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_02: Like it's, I mean, to build something like that is incredible.
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_02: And so yes, like you probably have some traits that are very strong, but those can cut
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_02: both ways.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_02: And so, you know, when the person from ADT calls you and you're like, you know, like you're
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_02: like in this sort of vortex of doing stuff, you know, maybe you don't sort of take the
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_02: time to say like, why don't I just come to you?
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_02: Why don't we sit down like we're two humans and work this out?
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_02: And by the way, I'm, it'd be funny to like now go back like I'm sure if I had just flown
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_02: there, sat down for dinner with them.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_02: I really actually feel like they probably just like fine, whatever, we're good.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_02: Like we just wanted to like talk, you know, say like we just want to talk to you instead.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_02: I was like, you know, like lunatic, you know, doing stuff.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_02: And they sort of said, well, why don't we teach you some business?
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_02: And so they, they did.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_02: And to be fair like whatever.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_02: And so that that was very, you know, turned out to be fairly painful.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:10:03] So you guys are about to get to the best part of the podcast.
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_01: This is the part where we asked Jamie how he comes up with new ideas for businesses,
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_01: how he came up with the idea of ring, but also a lot of the other projects that he's
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_01: looking into starting.
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_01: And he's got this amazing name.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_01: It's called the snowball method.
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_01: Meaning he likes to find very small ideas that can eventually become big.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_01: But the problem is that these ideas are so small that people don't notice them or they
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_01: forget about them.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_01: And so here's what we did.
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_01: We went and looked at what he's going to talk about on this podcast, which you're going
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: to hear because you're going to get to it.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_01: But then he's talked about the snowball method on a bunch of other podcasts.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: And we went and broke it down into a really easy to understand methodology.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_01: And so if you're interested in solving these four questions, this guide, it's for you.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_01: So it's how do you spot billion dollar ideas, how do you get inside boring problems?
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_01: Number two, what early stage moves actually validated ring before it took off?
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_01: Number three, how do you keep momentum when your business feels stuck or you're on the
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_01: brink?
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: And number four, what critical decisions make or break a founder's path from $200 to a
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_01: billion dollars?
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_01: And so if this type of thing interests you, which I think it does because you listen to
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_01: my first million, you can get the link in the description below.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_00: So you call the guy, you're like, hey, feel silly even bringing this up.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_00: But there's a little loss that you should probably know about.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_00: And then they, he's like, we're out.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_00: And you're thinking, well, look, you drafted the term she didn't.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_00: We just go ahead and set it over and he's like, no, no, no, we're out.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: How did it go back on?
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_00: I said, why don't we just keep the negotiation going and like, you know, if I settle this
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_02: thing out, then like we're good.
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_02: He's like, dude, we're not like, Amazon's like not done.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_02: Like it's like, basically like pencils down until you, whatever.
[00:11:31] On the flip side, which was great is I had a safety net.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_02: So like, don't worry.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_02: I'm totally fine.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_02: Like, I'm going into this Amazon deal with a safety net, which is if we don't do the
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_02: Amazon deal, I'm going to raise $200 million.
[00:11:44] So I also had to call them and say, just FYI, like, I know this deal, like we're about
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_02: to close it for this money.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_02: And just FYI, like we had this little injunction on that little thing that I kind of said that
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_02: was not going to be a big deal.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_02: And they're like, yeah, we're out too.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_02: It's like the two doors I was looking at is like selling to Amazon or raising $200 million.
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_02: It was the first time I was going to take secondary money off.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_02: So I was going to actually take some money off the table and meaningful money.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_02: Like it would have been like real for me.
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_02: And so those are like the two things I was like sort of looking at going into the holidays
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_02: basically.
[00:12:21] And all of a sudden, both those doors evaporated and now we're negative like 70 million in
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_02: the bank because we didn't plan the cash flow because it was like one of these doors
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_02: going to happen.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_02: You're not going to raise more money.
[00:12:34] Like, I mean, you're not going to raise like a third set of money.
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_02: Like, you know, so all of a sudden we like go to like basically, we are like technically
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_02: like a bankrupt company almost immediately.
[00:12:46] Okay, go on.
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm hooked.
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: So what happens?
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: And for more importantly, what's the conversation you have with yourself in that moment?
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_00: Because I think, you know, there's what you did, but there's also what you said to yourself
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_00: before you figured out what to do.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_00: So what's like the like so again, to traits that are good.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_02: Like the one thing I do have, which is probably, you know, has kept us from completely
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_02: blowing the place up when things really have like when things are really, really bad.
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_02: I go into like a pilot checklist.
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_02: Like I am just like dead pan calm.
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_02: We got to do this.
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_02: We had to, so I'm like, we have to, we're going in the holidays.
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_02: We have to sell everything.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_02: We have to like break every record.
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_02: We have to, like, it's like the only way to survive is just like we got to like do this.
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_02: And we also have to stop paying our bills to anyone that can't like, you know, actually
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_02: like tow us away.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_02: And so we did that too, which was pretty, that was, and that's, that's not fun because
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_02: like you're calling people that have worked, you know, vendors and you're like, hey,
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_02: listen, like I know, but if you, if you like stop shipping this, we're dead.
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_02: If we're dead, everything you've already sent is dead.
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_02: Like, you know, it's just, it's a bit of like it's, it's not a conversation you want
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_02: to have.
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_01: Everyone's problem at that point.
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_02: It's horrible.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_02: Like it's just, it's just like a bad, it's a bad situation.
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_02: And then did the lawsuit go away?
[00:14:01] So we, like we're going through that ever.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_02: It's crazy.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_02: As we go through, you know, black, black, black Friday cyber Monday, like that whole sort
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_02: of week, we literally blow out like every, like everything's like ring is just the, it's
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_02: the product of the holidays.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_02: Like it's the number one cell at best by like it's just literally like on fire.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_02: So by the way, on that, if this wasn't happening, how much less do you think it sales
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: you would have had, you know, like percent wise, how much do you think you got extra
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: just with the forcing function of necessity?
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: At least there's definitely like probably like low double, like 10%, 15% at least at
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_02: least.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_00: And was it just your intensity?
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: Because it's like we have to or did you come up with a new idea?
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_00: What'd you do?
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_00: We did everything.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_02: Like every social post, every this, like I mean, we just had people, like we did, like
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_02: yeah, you just like, you put it all in the field, like you just like send in your best
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_02: everybody.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_02: So we just went crazy.
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_02: Um, but for sure, I think for sure that was a part of it.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_02: Um, but we need, like we needed to, like we needed to like literally break everything
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_02: every number, blow everything out.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_02: Um, and still with that, like it wasn't clear that we would live.
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_02: It just felt like it was going to be more likely you'd live if you were blowing it out
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_02: than not.
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_02: Um, and so we doing that.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_02: And then all of a sudden, ADT calls and says, Hey, would you like to talk, you know, settlement?
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_02: It's like, it's like a magic, like, imagine if you had like, you know, someone's like
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_02: literally like, you have no oxygen, you know, they're like, Hey, you jack a little
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_02: oxygen. You're like, I love some oxygen.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_02: And so we went and they were actually like pretty like fair.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_02: And once we settled like that, like everything else was amazing.
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_02: It was this weird thing.
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_02: We're like everything underneath was like the best ever.
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_02: And we had this just one cloud that that that moved everyone away.
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_02: And as soon as that dissipated and went away, like it was, you know, I mean, so
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_02: we basically it was like December 9th or something, you know, that we settle, um, which
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_02: on the fast, that's really fast, right?
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: It was you go to this, like, it's this thing.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_02: You got to like this, um, um, this office where there's like two conference rooms in
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_02: this, this judge, like a, a retired judge was who walks back and forth between these
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_02: like two conference rooms, like you're in one there and the other.
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_02: And you just, they just keep going back and forth all day.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_02: And then it's the craziest thing.
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_02: I finally, like, okay.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_02: And you're like, okay.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_02: And then you sign it and you're like, are this is done?
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_02: And they're like, it's done.
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, done, done.
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_02: Like I kept like, it was like, like, you know, like a Laurel and Hardy like done, done, done,
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_02: done. And then you know, I called, I literally, I called Amazon and just said just
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_02: that's why I settled and they said, okay.
[00:16:38] Like it was like, you know, like that's all like we love the business.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_02: We just didn't, you know, we didn't want to get involved in that.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_02: And so once it was settled, they know that was like December 9th or whatever.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_02: December 31st, we signed for 1.15 billion to sell it.
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_02: Wait until the deal closed 30 days later.
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_01: So we signed the L.O.I.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_02: Like the binding L.O.I.
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_02: Literally like less than 30 days.
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_02: So did you shop it around as well?
[00:17:03] I didn't.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_02: For a number of reasons that the biggest one was I did not know of another buyer that
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_02: would back our mission.
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_02: So we were very missionary around making neighborhoods safer.
[00:17:17] What were your interactions like with Jeff Bezos?
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_00: So Jeff loves entrepreneurs so much that they've learned not to have him,
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_02: you know, involves in the purchasing because I think Jeff would just be like,
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_02: I love you, man.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_02: Like he's like, Jeff's so great.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_02: And so so I didn't actually, I mean, I had met him like once before,
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_02: but I didn't really kind of know him.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_02: And so really it was post deal that I got to really start to spend some time with
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_02: him.
[00:17:44] And he is just one of the greatest people ever for lots of reasons.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_02: I say the number one is he's just like a good human.
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_02: Do you have any good, um,
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_00: basic stories of like, you know, it's because rare that you, you know,
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_00: get to actually interact with or in your case work with because there's always
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: levels to the game, right?
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I think I'm doing great that I meet somebody.
[00:18:02] I'm like, wow, that person's got a different level of intensity or they're a
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_00: different level of sharpness.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_00: So they ask a different style of question.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_00: And so you, but you don't know until you meet them, right?
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_00: You don't even know what level 12 looks like until you see level 12.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: And so I'm just curious like, did you have any moments like that with, uh, with,
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_00: with basically,
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_00: definitely many, many moments.
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_02: I say the biggest thing I took away from Jeff is he's the most positive person I've
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_02: ever met in like the weirdest way because he gets shit done.
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_02: So it's not like he's like just like, Hey, good job guys.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: You know, it's like, but he's able to just like be so patient on things.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_02: And I, and just like he, like sees the future and he's just very patient and,
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_02: and very positive.
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_02: And so I've, I've tried to, it's, it's definitely different than my personality.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_02: You know, I'm sort of more like, you know, punch a wall kind of like run around,
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_02: yell a little bit more like this.
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_02: Just like kind of like more like that.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_02: Like it may be like inventor passion, but he has taught me to sort of try to,
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_02: like just be a little bit calmer and let things sort of work themselves out
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_02: versus like forcing everything.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_02: I think maybe that's the, the biggest learning.
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_02: And why have you stayed this?
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_01: I mean, how the deal is what?
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_01: 10 years ago, five years ago, it's 2018.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_01: So seven, seven years ago.
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_01: Why why are you still there?
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_01: I mean, obviously, I mean, money is probably a big part of it.
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_01: But is there a mission?
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_00: He's going to say mission.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_00: I could bet anything he's going to say the mission.
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_00: Money.
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: No, you know, I actually, so in 2023, I ended up stepping down.
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_02: I was just, you know, I'd taken the company almost 10X it from when we got to
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_02: Amazon, brought a profitable.
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_02: Like I felt like I delivered like the package.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, here it is.
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_02: It's pretty amazing.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_01: So you grew it to four billion revenue around there.
[00:19:48] Oh my gosh.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_02: That's wild.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_02: So it, you know, the thing just kept growing.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_02: It just kept like, it's just insane.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_02: And so I, I finally was just like, I am, I'm feeling like super burnt out
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_02: on just the like a whole thing.
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_02: I stepped back and I, and I did realize I missed just, I just missed like,
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_02: like I missed the mission.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_02: I missed what we're building.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_02: I love like, I'm an inventor at heart and being able to be at Amazon,
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_02: you can invent at scale.
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_02: So, you know, an inventor, the best thing for an inventor is like see your invention
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_02: out there.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but it's pretty amazing that like most inventor, I mean, I mean,
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_01: there's many inventors that are successful at Dyson.
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_01: There's, you know, Edison was a good businessman, but, you know,
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_01: maybe, maybe must would be an inventor.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure who else, but, but typically the stereotype of an,
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_01: of an inventor is someone who's got like two different matching socks and like,
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_01: they don't like know how to do anything other than like invent and they're a little
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_01: bit messy and whatever, but it sounds like you actually knew how to operate.
[00:20:45] I would say I've used invention around operation, but I don't operate,
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_02: I certainly don't operate in a normal way.
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_02: So, like I've never had a staff meeting.
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_02: Like everyone's always like, you know, what did he do?
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_02: You're, you're staff meeting on them.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_02: Like I'm none, because I've never had one.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_02: We never had an all hands meeting at the company.
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_02: And so we, you do things that you need to.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_02: So there's a lot of things like I don't have those like processes of how to like run a business.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_02: Did you are exactly like, you know who he's like Sean 100%
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_01: a lot.
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_01: The card game.
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you lonely, yeah, a lot of the lonely.
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_01: Oh, man, he had the exact same mentality where he was like, yeah,
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_01: we don't do this at the company.
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_01: We're, whereas Sean and I were like, wait, but I thought everyone had to do all hands.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I was like, well, I thought about the reason why and we just invented a different way to do it.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think if you can turn like again, like it's still inventing, like it's like just,
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_02: like just because it's not a, like a physical product or just because internal doesn't mean it's not an
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: invention.
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: So I do love that like you can use invention across the board.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_02: Um, and especially like how you build a business.
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_02: I would say like, I mean, this is where Dyson, I think it, I don't, I don't know him,
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_02: but he's like, he's like my mentor.
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_02: I just, it's like the mentor I don't know.
[00:21:53] Um, but like look at what Dyson's been able to do by having built a great business.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_02: Like if he hadn't built a great business, he'd just be a guy in a, a barn somewhere and like Oxford
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_02: Shire or some shit.
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_02: Um, and instead, you know, he's like able to like build all this crazy good stuff and have this company.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: So I think I did feel like the business was something you needed in order to be able to like get your
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_02: inventions out there bigger.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_02: And that's, that's kind of what ring has been and then being at Amazon, it's like that's just like,
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_02: you know, a thousand X that was there a moment in those early days for ring where it went from not working.
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_00: Like it's not a thing to it's a thing like an inflection point where, you know,
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_00: or did it take off right away as soon as you had the product, people started buying it.
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_00: It's certainly, you know, looking back, it probably took off more than I thought because like being inside of it,
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_02: you're sort of dealing with the problem.
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_02: So you don't really see it as easily.
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_02: Like again, when I wrote the book, I kind of like was able to like go back and like think about all of
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_02: what was happening and look at it in a different light.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_02: And so, um, it was 2016.
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_02: My wife was out checkered treating.
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_02: I was away on something and that was like the year she called and she's like, this is your,
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_02: it's like every house has a ring.
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_02: She's like, this is insane.
[00:23:08] Um, and I think you really felt it because like they're literally trick or treating and like they're
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_02: like hitting like the ring like every house.
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_02: So I think there was like some moments like that.
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_02: Could that kind of be like one of the most proud moments ever where you're like, my wife is seeing it.
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_02: So, I mean, like we would literally drive around, I mean, early like and yell like when we saw a ring on a house.
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_02: Like it was like that was like a death.
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_02: And then we kind of had to stop the ring game because it like it was like, he just became yelling ring the whole time.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_02: But early on, yeah, I mean, it's like, and as an adventure like that's
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_02: that was, you know, if I, I never felt like it was successful until we got the wire just because I felt like it could blow up.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_02: But I did feel like I had created something meaningful and had that like satisfaction of that just by seeing,
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_02: like seeing these on everyone's front door and
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_02: the stories that then they created like the, you know, stopping a crime doing whatever like those are the things that were like that was amazing.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_02: I'm curious. The wire hits.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_00: We've asked a bunch of people about this on the podcast because it's a, you know, it's a moment you look forward to as a founder like like crazy.
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_00: But, you know, it's hard to actually get there.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_00: And we've had some guys say, yeah, with the wire hit, you know, he's like, I went to the ATM the next five days just to print balance.
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_00: You know, never push that button before, but I'm just so excited.
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_00: Or, you know, some people feel lost, you know, right after I guess like wire hits.
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_00: What, where were you and what was going through your mind?
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_00: So I had booked, I don't know if you know this company task us, but the, the, it's a great public company now.
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_02: The founders or friends that were, you know, kind of kids from Santa Monica that I had known that started it.
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_02: And they asked me to speak at their customer conference like six months earlier.
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_02: And it was in New York just like on whatever some random day in April of 2018.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_02: Because of how everything happens like you sell like you finally announced it and the government has to inspect it.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_02: Then even after that, there's like, they have to like file stuff and whatever.
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_02: So like the actual wire date is not like any of those dates.
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_02: It's kind of a random time when it just comes.
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_02: And so it ended up being like, I'm at this event and I'm speaking in New York.
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_02: And I'm sitting there and I'm like, I'm sorry, everyone.
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_02: Like, I'm going to, like, my phone's out.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, I'm like, I can barely even like, I'm like, just like, I'm like, I'm just going to.
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_02: Keep refreshing this because the wire is supposed to come in.
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_02: And everyone knows like they knew I'd sold.
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_02: So I'm like, the wire hasn't come in yet, but it's supposed to come in right now.
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_02: And I just like, I'm sorry, I keep, you know, well, as far ago, you know, it's like, yeah.
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_01: And you're like on stage, you're like, look, I know I was talking about customer service.
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_01: But today I'm going to give a talk on how to get rich.
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm like, you know, money doesn't matter to me.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_02: It's all about mission, but like, but like, you know, hold on the next hour.
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's like, it's all and literally like, you know, comes in.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_02: And there's like just commas and commas and commas.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_02: And it's like, how many commas could this be?
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_02: Like, it's like, like to run on sentence.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_02: Commas and commas.
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_02: And I just, I, yeah, it was the best.
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_02: I mean, especially I just gone through the most traumatic thing ever.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_02: And from a money side, like, if ringhead exploded at that point,
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_02: which I mean, it got right on the edge of, it would have been like,
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_02: really impactful to my family.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_02: Like, and I, like, yeah, when you like, uh, just not broke,
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_01: but like, were you just like, you know, seven,
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_01: it's like 150, $250,000 a year salary person.
[00:26:28] Like that, yeah, it was like 150, I think at that point.
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_02: And I prided myself, and this was very,
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_02: looking back at real mistake.
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_02: I prided myself on being like the least paid executive.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, man, that makes you desperate.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_01: I did the same thing on a much smaller scale,
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_01: but it made me desperate.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: And that's exactly right.
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_02: So, here's the other problem.
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_02: When you're making that kind of money,
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_02: and you're at a company, it's a 48 million people like,
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_02: hey, come to this charity event.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's only $10,000 a table.
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_02: Do this. And you kind of have to, like,
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_02: you're, it's like, you have to sort of take part in some of this stuff,
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_02: but you don't actually have the money.
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_02: So you're, you're, you're spending even more than you would
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_02: making that salary regardless.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_02: So yeah, I was like, I mean, I was basically zero dollars.
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_02: And I mean, you know, I wasn't like, I wasn't like in debt debt,
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_02: but I wasn't, I didn't have like a nest egg.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_02: And so if Ringelves didn't win away, like, that was all my,
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_02: like, future money was in ring.
[00:27:19] I love how honest you are.
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_00: Most people, the more successful they get,
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_00: and the more, sort of, you know, these moments,
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_00: like they try to either downplay or they're just less,
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_00: less honest. And I think, and by the way,
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: I think this is why what I call Joe's like, that dude's happy.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_00: I was like, it's not like you're like, you know,
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_00: some yogi or, you know, a monk who's just like, you know,
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_00: at peace, that's not that.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_00: But I was like, I, you've, you seem free.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_00: And I think that that's something that we all hope success gives us.
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_00: But it's actually not the success that gives you.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_00: You have to decide how you're going to be.
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_00: I think also like, yeah, when you're facing, like,
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_02: when you see what the other side is that clearly,
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_02: I do remember, like, it's like, I remember how lucky I am,
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_02: sort of, every day, like, I wouldn't call it like this.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it is success.
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_02: I said, like, money, but like, money, I think,
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_02: I have so many friends that have a lot of money that are not free,
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_02: which is a shame because, like, that's really what this gives you
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_02: is the freedom to do what you want.
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_02: Like, I get to wake up and work on things that I want to work on and impact
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_02: things that I want to impact and be with my son and take them
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_02: among college tours this past weekend.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_02: And like, I get to do things because of that.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_02: And that, yes, like, I am like, overall, I'd say,
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_02: that is very happy.
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_02: I want to take the mindset that you used to build ring.
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_00: Your approach as a, as a founder and kind of break that down
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_00: and then see what other ideas might fit that.
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_00: So one of them that you told me, you said,
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_00: rule number one, I like to start with the problem,
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_00: not the solution or the technology.
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_00: And so, you know, what did that mean for ring?
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_00: And then what's another example of an idea where you could,
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_00: where you could take that kind of problem first approach?
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, so ring was, I was in my garage,
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_02: I couldn't hear the doorbell.
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_02: So like, what do you need to do is you need to hear the doorbell.
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_02: Now, when you find that problem, it turns out a lot of times new technology
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_02: can help impact it.
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_02: Like, oh, there's smartphones coming out.
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_02: Okay, well, those have screens.
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_02: Like, there's Wi-Fi now in homes.
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_02: There's like these, so it is that technology can assist the problem.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_02: I think the problem, the issue is most, a lot of founders,
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_02: say I found this new chip that's out there.
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_02: What can we do with this?
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_02: And so they don't find a real problem.
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_02: They just like, you know, it is a technology looking for a problem.
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_02: I like to start with like actually something that is a true problem.
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_02: And then it doesn't matter what the tech is.
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_02: I mean, that's part of what built ring into where it is today
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_02: is, and again, you're going to laugh with mission.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_02: But by being a mission to make neighborhood safer,
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_02: we don't follow any technology.
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_02: We're not a camera company.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_02: We're not a alarm company.
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_02: We're not a social network company.
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_02: Like, we are just a making neighborhood safer company,
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_02: which means like, regardless what comes out or what we can think of,
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_02: it doesn't matter what is.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_02: If it's a steam engine in the middle of the neighborhood,
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_02: and that's going to make things,
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_02: sure, I don't care.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_02: And so you take that.
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_00: Now, if I'm you and I'm like, oh, I was in the garage.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_00: I couldn't hear the doorbell.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_00: I think there's a part of me, the inner critic that would have been like,
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_00: this is too small.
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, that doesn't sound like a big fancy idea.
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to do big fancy.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to be a big success, not a small success.
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_00: And you know, is it that you did napkin math on like,
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_00: how many doorbells I could sell?
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_00: Is it that you just don't care about the market size?
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: Like, how do you think about that?
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_00: There's a guy who's somewhat successful and said to me,
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_02: is the most insulting thing like almost anyone could ever say.
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_02: And right when I'm doing this, he said to me,
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_02: I kind of put his arm in my shoulder.
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_02: And he was much more successful than me at the time.
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_02: I am now much more successful than he has ever been.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_02: And he put his arm in his shoulder and say,
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_02: like, I love you, man, because you just like to work on these little things.
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_02: And it's like so cute and fun to see.
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_02: And I was like, oh, my God.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_02: That was supposed to be like, it was like when you're finding these things,
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_02: if they were obvious that they were huge problems,
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_02: someone would be doing it.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_02: So it's like, you have to find these problems that are sort of not obviously huge,
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_02: but sort of have like have again, I look at it as like,
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_02: what is that?
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_02: What could it be?
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_02: And so like with the doorbell,
[00:31:09] it was a small thing because even people were like,
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_02: $200 doorbell, like there's doorbells are $10.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_02: And it's like so that was the problem.
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_02: But if you really looked at it and zoomed out,
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_02: it's like everyone has a doorbell in their house across the world,
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_02: like globally, like literally a doorbell is on every home.
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_02: So is Ness popular at this point?
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_02: So Ness was popular as a thermostat.
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_02: And they had it sold.
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_02: They were just selling or sold to Google.
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_02: And Dropcam was actually the Wi-Fi camera that was out there that was doing well.
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_02: And that Ness ended up, you know,
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_02: that Tony ended up buying at Google to bring into Ness.
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_02: So maybe there was some inspiration where it's like, okay,
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_01: not the same thing, but like a household item.
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_01: For sure.
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_01: Oh, for sure.
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_01: Like I was actually like super.
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_02: In fact, I actually have an email to Matt Rodgers,
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_02: who is the co-founder of Ness.
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_02: Like when the Ness came out, I was like one of the first customers.
[00:32:01] And just like it super inspires us this like what you're doing here.
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_02: So yeah, no, there was, there was stuff happening.
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_02: But yeah, I think it's, it is hard though to see like at the time how big a market is.
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_02: Again, if it was obvious, like everyone was just like, oh, the doorbell.
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's just a doorbell.
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_02: Like look at this guy's doing a doorbell.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_02: Like that's just, it's gonna be huge.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_02: And no one thought it was gonna be huge.
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_02: Did you have like a dream where you're laying in bed talking to your wife?
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_01: You know, I think, I think we can make a hundred million dollars one year one day.
[00:32:25] I didn't.
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_02: I kind of like built it.
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_02: My wife was the one who said like, so this is, and this is where,
[00:32:31] she's like, it makes me feel safer at home.
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_02: And that was like, oh, this is like again, like this is more than just like scratching my itch in the garage.
[00:32:37] SPEAKER_02: Just could, and that was what I realized it that the security market,
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_02: like the overall security market had not yet started looking at how you could build
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_02: and invent products around presence and sort of like true crime prevention.
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_02: Like it was, the alarm was built in the 1800s and kind of was pretty much like
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_02: very the same thing, which like trigger off of a trip and call, you know, a central station.
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_02: Like it was like, that was kind of like best in class, though.
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_02: And we were like, we can look at this problem differently, which, which is again, that's,
[00:33:11] SPEAKER_02: that was the superpower was the, not just the doorbell, but then we did the flood light camera.
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_02: Then we did like, we did all these things that were sort of unique.
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_02: Because we were, look, even the neighbors app, which is a, you know, it's a huge
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_02: social network for crime and safety and neighborhoods.
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_02: Like all that stuff came out of looking at the problem and trying to solve it.
[00:33:31] So what's an example of an idea today?
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_00: You see a problem out there that you're like, somebody could go try to solve that.
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_00: Bugs, like I just hate bugs.
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_02: Like I've never found anyone that likes bugs.
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_02: And it's amazing that there's like no one has actually created with all the technical,
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_02: like we can, we can launch rockets up in the air and land them on like a little barge.
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_02: We can like do all this stuff, but we can't get rid of freaking flies at my house in Missouri.
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_02: And so I just, I just feel like there's got to be simple ways to do this between like
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_02: solar and, you know, there's just got to be like ways to look at this problem differently.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_02: Then just either hitting it with some toxin that's going to kill us all as well.
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_02: Or these other products that just don't work.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_02: Is that your current obsession?
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_02: So I, I, I have realized over time you have to work on like one thing.
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_02: Like you can't work on 10 different products.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_02: When I meet a founder that's like, you know, an entrepreneur that's, I'm doing this and this,
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_02: and they're all different. I'd say, you know, 99 out of 100 times, like they're going to fail
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_02: because they're just splitting their energy.
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_02: All right. Well, for the sake of entertainment, but also teaching our listeners and it's fun.
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_01: Can we walk through this? Let's say that you're not at ring.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_01: And let's say that this is like actually the idea, which this idea, potentially,
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_01: I don't know how it's, I mean, now it's obvious that ring is awesome.
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_01: But maybe in 2014 when you were finished, they're like, well, that sounds so stupid.
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_01: And so maybe like a lot of people are going to think bugs, flies.
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_01: That's it. That's all you got.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_01: Like let's walk us through like this idea of like why this is a big problem and like how you
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_01: would attack or how you would go about solving this. Yeah. So I would just like literally,
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_02: I would stick myself on the farm. I would get the soldering iron out and I would just start
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_02: like figuring out, I just be like, I also, I immersed myself in the problem.
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_02: Like why are bugs going on the horses? Like why are they like, what are they actually attracted to
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_02: on this? Like what are they doing? And I would get on chat GPT and I would be like trying to figure
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_02: that out. And I'd be like, look at everything. And I just figure out like what like again,
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_02: simplify like like how do I go from a first principles approach? Like what is the way to just get rid
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_02: of these damn things at scale? What would that be? How could you do it inexpensively?
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_02: My feeling is it has something to do with solar and either like some like kind of screw mechanism
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_02: or suction just sort of like, because you got it, it's like a big problem, right? I guess like
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_02: it's like a massive volume problem. And so it's like these like, I keep thinking of these
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_02: like little stations that you just put all over your property and they're just continually sort of like
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_02: collecting and how to do that. So that's it. But I would just, and I just literally, I'd just be like
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_02: building this stuff. Like I would start, I wouldn't do research. I wouldn't ask friends if it's
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_02: going to be a big business. I wouldn't spend time on any of that stuff. I would be out there like
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_02: with solar panels and Dyson vacuum cleaners hooked up to lights and you know, tubes and like I'd
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_02: just be like doing this stuff. Sam, have you seen Julian, are friend Julian's obsession with bugs?
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_01: No. So we have this friend, him Julian who's like out of this world and like he's only eaten
[00:36:25] SPEAKER_01: steak for like two years. And then how he's moved to Hawaii and he has a ranch. He's doing crazy stuff.
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_01: He moves to Hawaii. He buys a ranch and he starts building like, you know, at home and he's got
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_00: this bug problem just like you and because you know, the big project he was doing was the ranch,
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_00: the big problem with the big project was the besketas. And so he's like, he's specifically
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_00: focused on mosquitoes. And so he told me, he emailed me for like over a couple of month period that like
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_00: just different things he was trying to do to, but what you were saying, like understand what the
[00:36:52] SPEAKER_00: hell's going on with the mosquito. Where's the root problem for kind of first pencils? And he's like,
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_00: oh, the problem is we try to kill the mosquito. No, you need to kill the eggs. Because if you don't
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_00: kill the eggs, for everyone mosquito, you're killing. There's like whatever, a hundred mosquitoes that
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_00: are coming out. And then he tried to bought all the fancy contraptions and then he realized like,
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_00: oh, they lay their eggs in the water. And so what you need to do. And so I guess I don't know all the
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: signs behind this, but he basically has this thing I got on the screen here. It's like this just
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_00: a bucket with water. And then you spray this, or you put this thing in the in the water that's
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_00: going to like kill the eggs when they try to lay them there. And so it like stops the cycle.
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And he's like, I did it. I solved the problem with the mosquito, the mosquito problem,
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_00: which is that they want to lay their eggs on stale water. So you put the dirt in the
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_00: rest. You make old stale water as a trap for them. And then you put this thing in it that's going to,
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_00: it's a harmless to human bacteria, but it's going to kill the eggs. And he's, and he was like so
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_00: pumped. And like, look at this thing. This thing has 11,000 bookmarks on a single tweet, which is like,
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_00: you know, that's pretty, that's pretty unusual. But it kind of shows a lot of people are like,
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_00: you know, have the same itch, the same problem and don't really have a good solution.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And so it's, and it is like, you know, is, is there a five or 10 billion dollar
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_02: company hiding in the bug space? Probably there it. Like probably like, I mean, it's, it's global.
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_02: Like every, like they're everywhere. It's, it's also like, I mean, it's, it's an issue on health.
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_02: You know, mosquitoes cause health issues, flies cause health issues. So it's like, it actually,
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_02: like, there's like real impact. So if you could figure something out, like it actually, it, you know,
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_02: it is probably, you know, a five or 10 billion dollar thing.
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_02: It also seems like there might be like a branding thing that you did well with ring that like
[00:38:28] SPEAKER_00: could be applicable in the bug space. Like I don't know what all the big bug companies are, but I know
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_00: raid. It's like, they all literally like, they look and sound like killing with like toxin basically.
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_00: And like the, you know, it's all branded and it'll look a monster energy looking can. And, you
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_00: know, the way that these new like Celsius and Alani knew and prime, like a lot of the new drinks
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_00: came out and they're literally like, just energy drinks, but with a, like a different vibe.
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_00: I think that's, that's a good point is like, there's like, it is the same thing where there's like,
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_02: there is a, probably a new brand in this that stands for, and it's like, it's not environmentally
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_02: safe because like, I'm like some eco warriors because like, you don't want to spray shit all
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_02: over your house. Like you live in that. Like it's like, that's not good. Like we've seen these like
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_02: bug bombs and stuff. Like there's no way those are good for you. Like it can't be.
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_02: I thought the monster energy drink of mosquito spray was a pretty good, that was pretty good.
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. All right. Isn't that what the can kind of looks like? It's like, it's like, it's like,
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_01: it's like, I wish someone would go do it. I wish in like, be amazing. And imagine five years,
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_02: someone comes back to like, I was listening to this thing. I had the same thing. I needed like a
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_02: little push. I got inspired and I built a $5 billion business out of it. Like that would be the,
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_02: like that would be the coolest thing ever. Ray, like we're at war. We're going to go to battle. I'd
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_01: like to think about these what this weapon is. If you don't aim it in the right direction,
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_01: there might be a, you know, there might be a self-inflicted wound here. Yeah. You know, it's bad
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_02: when you're using something when you're, when you're, when you say the name, I can taste that,
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_02: like it's not like I can smell it. Like I can taste what that is like because it's like that
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_02: toxic. It goes through your, it like blast through your skin. My wife hates that stuff because we have
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_00: a dog with a baby. It's like, she's just like, look, we can't just spray this stuff all over.
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_00: Like, yeah, I don't know. It's too risky, right? I mean, what were you like using it as hairspray?
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_01: Like why are you spraying it all over the place? Well, you know, it is when like, there's a bug that,
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_00: it's like that one episode of Breaking Bad where there's a fly in the, in the, in the, in the BethLab.
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. It has me with a bug the other day and, and like my house. And I was like, okay, fine.
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_00: Mission. I'm like suited up in a house. Yeah. Just going to war, but you know, you get carried away.
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_00: One of the things you had said I really liked was you called yourself a snowball.
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_00: Yes. So the snowball would be like, if you knew about the fly thing, it would be, I hate these
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_02: flies. Okay. Like that's the snowball starts going down the hill. And then I'm just like taking
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_02: stuff and soldering it together, doing it. Like it's now it's gathering sort of it's,
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_02: and then it like hits something and like you lose a little bit off the snowball, but it keeps going.
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_02: And you just kind of roll down the hill. And by the way, some snowballs and they're rolling down
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_02: the hill, they hit like a, they hit the tree and they just explode. So like that could be the fly
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_02: thing is you get to this point where you just can't figure it out. That totally happens.
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_02: If you can see the finish line when you start, it's usually not a big good thing. Like it's like,
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_02: that's usually, you're, you're not, like you're not inventing or you're not changing the world
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_02: typically if it's like that clear how to get from start to finish. And so yeah, it's like I just kind
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_02: of feel like I just kind of roll down the hill and gather and and you hope you don't hit a tree.
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_02: And as you get to the bottom of the hill, you hope you're like a bigger snowball that's, you know,
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_02: I guess, hopefully good for the world. I guess snowballs, if snowballs are good for the world that you
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_02: are helpful. When we got bought, we got bought by Twitch and Emmett the founder. He's this,
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_00: you know, great entrepreneur. And I was like, you know, by value of being there, I was there to earn
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_00: out my deal and, you know, be helpful, but I really wanted to learn from it. I was like, this is
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_00: the one guy I want to learn from while I'm here. So I asked him. I said, hey, in the early days at
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_00: Twitch, did you ever like send investor updates or anything? I have a little bit nosy. I was like,
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_00: can I, would you share any of that with me? Like I would love to see that. Do just as an entrepreneur,
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_00: like what was it like 10 years ago? And he's like, sure. So he sent me this update and one of the things
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_00: he wrote in there, he goes, it is one of his updates. Because it was hard at the time, you know,
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_00: they were doing a pretty unproven thing, video game streaming, you know, it wasn't clearly going to
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_00: be a big market, but he felt a sense of momentum. And he's one of the investor updates, the title was,
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_00: we were a steamroller going through a field full of flowers. And he was like just saying, and they
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_00: had gotten like 150 do streamers that week. And he was like, yes. And so he was just taking a lot of
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_00: pride in the small stage. Because if you just keep looking at the small stage and poo pooing it,
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_00: you never build up the momentum. Yeah. And the second thing he said was like same thing. He goes,
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_00: you know, I really want to try to get into this like kind of adjacent space. And I was like, why do you
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_00: want to do that? Seems like there's so much more room to run still with gameshroom. And he goes,
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_00: yeah. But he goes, you never want to see the the finish line. He's like, he's like, he's like,
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_00: because I know he's like, I don't want to be able to see the like the horizon at the end. He's
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_00: like, even if that's still five years away, I need to do something that's going to push the horizon
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_00: out further so that we have more room to run. And I'd really never thought of it like that. But I
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_00: guess, you know, as you play at scale, that's obviously like an important thing. It's actually,
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_00: I think I always think of goal. A lot of goals are actually ceilings. Like you think of a goal
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_02: and you want it to be something like you kind of hitting a goal perfectly is probably means the
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_02: goal isn't set right? Like you want to have these directional goals, like things that you could
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_02: try to achieve that are sort of tangible, but sort of in some ways unachievable. So that you're
[00:43:29] always like to your point, like you're just trying harder to get like it's the carrot on the stick
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_02: in front of you where like you can kind of never get the carrot, but you keep going for it.
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_02: You have a life philosophy and a life outlook that's very different from mine, but frankly,
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_01: I'm envious of how you think about things both like where you like I start with the problem and
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_01: I'm an inventor, which sounds basic, but the way that you do it is quite nice. You have a really
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_01: good attitude. And then you just made this line about like goals and ceilings. What people or
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_01: what books do you think have influenced you? And if Sean and I or one of our listeners wanted to
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_01: kind of develop this Jamie mindset besides your book. Yeah, of course, we ding dong by Jamie
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_02: Simanov. I may think that's the how-to guide of business. No, at all. By the way, thank you.
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_02: In all seriousness, no, I would I think the book that stands out the most for me is the Walt Disney
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_02: biography. If you want to read this, like get ready, like you better clear your calendar because
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_02: this thing is like I think the audiobooks like 24 hours. I mean, it's whoever did that audiobook
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_02: died afterwards. Like it was like that was like like of all the people that I've talked to and all
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_01: the biographies that I've listened to, the Walt Disney biography might be the most cited version
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_01: I've ever heard. And like Walt, I've never read it, but there's all these stories where like
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_01: on the small things like apparently someone was building like a train in Walt's backyard for his
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_01: kids or grandkids. I don't know something like that. And he wasn't there like a contractor that says
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_01: like well, we can't make the train curb. And he's like, what has to curve? Because when someone's
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_01: on the train, I don't want them to know it's coming up next. That is the embodiment of it. And it's
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_02: also he was so maniacal about every detail of every experience. And I was what I was going to say is
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_02: when you read this book, you realize that he was tortured. He could never achieve what he wanted to,
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_02: which was like absolute perfection of this. And so when a movie would come out, like my,
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_02: the thing that I took out the most from his book was every movie that would come out because
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_02: he was pushing animation ahead, like the technology and animation. So like Snow White and the Seven
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_02: Dwarves come out. He's sitting in the theater in the back. Everyone's watching it like literally
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_02: mind blowing, like seeing what's up there. But because he's already working on the next movie and the
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_02: next iteration of animation, he knows that this is shit. Like he knows that like that movie is not
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_02: as good as the next one's going to be. And he's like literally like crying in the back of this
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_02: theater that he's showing such a bad product to people because it could be so much better. And all
[00:45:56] SPEAKER_02: he wants to show him is the next one. And I thought that's like the struggle of a true inventor
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_02: and entrepreneur and like product person is like you just, you like everything I put out on mad
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_02: because I know I can be better. And it's like that just that constant thing. And that's like that's
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_02: how you drive to be the best. And there's definitely, you know, like I think you look at some of the
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_02: greatest inventors and entrepreneurs out there. You see that constant just like that that that dry
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_02: like that engine that just they can't stop. Yeah, you seem a lot happier than him. Which is a good
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_01: attribute to also have. It's not it's not terrible. There's another one of your your philosophies as
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_00: an entrepreneur that I really like just you talked about this idea of Tom Brady. I've used this
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_00: I did we did this call before this pod like a week ago or so. I've already used it twice in my
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_00: thinking in between. So that's when you know an idea stick. So can you explain the Tom Brady
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_00: hiring thing? Yes, I mean every team like when you get to the whatever and I'm not that into sports,
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_02: but you know they trade like the first trade pick for this and like they're always trying to get
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_02: like the first pick of the the the the the the the life that was called the draft draft.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_02: Is how much I'm into sports. So but like every team they they had the chance to get Tom Brady
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_02: multiple times like it's actually insane. It's like they didn't just have like one shot at him.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_02: He was the 199th draft pick. Like everybody had the chance to get Tom Brady. And so while everyone's
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_02: focused like whatever the number one draft pick of that year, number top 10 I probably are unknown
[00:47:30] SPEAKER_02: to us today. But Tom Brady is one of the greatest athletes of all time. And so to me as a as a
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_02: business, you have to find the Tom Brady's. They're actually out there for you like everybody has
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_02: access to Tom Brady or the Tom Brady of your business of that area. It's like how do you find them?
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_02: How do you incentivize them? How do you let them become the Tom Brady? That is just the amazing
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_02: thing. Whereas I meet with founders who are like, oh, I'm trying to get the person from the company
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_02: of this. And it's like, that's the number one draft pick. And you're going to just play pay too
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_02: much. And honestly, they're probably not going to be known in 10 years. Great. Sounds good. How?
[00:48:07] My so there's lots of people have lots of different methods for finding great people. My thing is
[00:48:13] SPEAKER_02: higher fast, fire faster, the mission really helps you sort of bring someone in like the interview
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_02: is basically like, I mean, obviously like do you have the skills to do the like the basic job.
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_02: So like it's like there's like a sort of a light bar. But above that, it's just are you passionate?
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_02: Do you want to work on this problem with us? Like do you and do you really want to work on this
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_02: problem with us? Like do you want to wake up in the morning excited about this problem? If you're
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_02: passionate, you want to work on the problem and you have the minimum skill set to do it, we'll let
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_02: you we'll let you try. Like it's just like let let like I don't know go out there and throw the ball
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_02: like say how you do and you give them massive autonomy in their area. Like give them the ability
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_02: to succeed or fail. I think another thing that a lot of companies do is they so like wrap you
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_02: in soft like in they don't want you to fail. So they stop you from succeeding. It's like such a
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_02: weird thing is like they like they they're so worried that maybe you're going to you know if you're
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_02: not able to do that level of the job. So we got to be careful like we don't want you to be
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_02: over your head versus like let Tom Brady be Tom Brady let him throw the ball and when you let
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_02: those people do it it's like it's incredible. And yes in the process of that you're going to have
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_02: people that are just going to like not be able to you know succeed at those jobs and you you know
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_02: you move on with them and you do it and that you can be compassionate in that it's not you don't
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_02: have to be how fast do fire like when people say higher fast, fire fast that's that's a little
[00:49:41] SPEAKER_01: bit vague. So like let's say you meet someone how fast would you
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_01: I was at that time like I mean you know we're probably not in that sort of like with Amazon now
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_02: and stuff. It's like obviously and it is as you get bigger like things are a bit different
[00:49:55] SPEAKER_02: back in the start days I'd say like three to six months because you certainly don't want to like
[00:50:00] it's not like the first day someone comes in you say like okay you're bad like or you're good.
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_02: I mean it takes someone a little bit of time to get their like their feet wet to get sort of
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_02: get their footing but you want to be pretty quick it's it's I would say it's very rare if you
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_02: talk to almost anyone that you know an entrepreneur or leader that they say like I wish
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_02: pretty much anyone that you say like when they fired someone it's like I wish I'd done it sooner.
[00:50:23] SPEAKER_02: So three to six months what about hiring? Hiring is like on the spot. I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_02: I mean again it Amazon is a little bit different now so I just be like honest of like yes like we
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_02: have a bigger company we have like some more like it and you have to do that it's like that's part
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_02: of the that's part for the course but but yeah we were like like Mimi who is my chief revenue
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_02: officer today she cold emailed me and said I worked at Dyson I now work at Sonos you know I see
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_02: what you guys are doing I'm in the neighborhood I'd love to stop by so the great stop by so she
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_02: sits down with Don and I Don runs our sales she starts talking I look at Don Don looks at me I said
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_02: we should just hire it right he goes yeah I said okay you're hired and she's like she's kind of
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_02: like like are you two jokers serious like this is like I was just coming to talk to you and I'm like
[00:51:06] SPEAKER_02: best done Mike I would like to you dot want to work here and she's like no no I want to work
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_02: here Mike well then then just come into work here she's like what am I doing I'm like I don't know
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_02: you just said you seem to like know all these problems we have so like go fix them like I like you
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_02: just told me that we're doing all this stuff wrong like why don't you just take whatever that is
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_02: like make that job title and go do it and she's our chief revenue officer today so
[00:51:27] have you ever heard Warren Buffett describe his his thing with us with people and the too hard pile
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_00: no I should have it so this guy came on the podcast Moniche Pobry and he in the episode he
[00:51:39] SPEAKER_00: described he he bought a charity lunch from Buffett for $650,000 he had learned so much from Buffett
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_00: he had been so super successful doing Buffett's method basically and he's like this is my
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_00: tuition is overdue so he's like I'll do I'll buy the charity lunch and and we'll go and I have
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_00: no expectations so I said what did you ask him and he asked Warren Buffett goes Warren you seem
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_00: to be a really good judge of people like he hired some pretty great people inside of Berkshire
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_00: and you've avoided a lot of the kind of like doing the wrong acquisition so you seem to be a good
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_00: judge of people what's your what's the secret and Warren Buffett goes no I don't think I'm that good
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_00: of people he goes I think what I do is I'm a very harsh grader so he said he goes basically the cost
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_00: of me saying no to a good person to somebody who actually turned out to be good it's not that
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_00: consequential of say if they turned out to be good and I happen to say no because I couldn't tell
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_00: but if I say yes to too many people who happen to be really bad that becomes very costly and very
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_00: hard for me to unwind so he goes if I was at a dinner party and there was a hundred guests and you
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_00: let me spend five minutes with each person he goes I could without a doubt I could tell you these five
[00:52:48] SPEAKER_00: no doubt are fantastic these five definitely stay away they're sort of toxic or there's something you
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_00: know that I don't trust about them and then there's 90 people who I don't know I can't tell in five
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_00: minutes and they all go in what I call the two hard pile it's just too hard to tell and he goes a
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_00: lot of life just works by putting everything else in the two hard pile and just focusing on the five
[00:53:07] SPEAKER_00: things that you were pretty clear and pretty sure about in a very small amount small amount of time
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_00: and everybody waste their time trying to get clarity on that 90% that's very hard to figure out
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_00: takes a lot of time and energy and you're gonna get it wrong a lot yeah I said I so and so kind of my
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_02: method has been on the hiring is the two hard pile is I'm aware that I'm not that good at figuring
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_02: who's in that pile always and so if it if I'm wrong I'm just gonna be very quick to sort of pull
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_02: the trigger and by the way like you can also be wrong pulling the trigger like if you're pulling
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_02: the trigger after three or six months like you can be wrong I'll also say like there's lots of
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_02: people who didn't fit our culture who went on to do incredible things and are incredibly successful
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_02: so it's not that like failing at ring was failing in life it was you just didn't fit what we were
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_02: doing and we are a unique lock and you want a unique key to work in that lock and that's where I
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_02: was say the empathy side like I didn't fire them being like you're dead out of here like it was like
[00:54:04] it's just doesn't like we're not working out together um and I would feel bad for every single one
[00:54:09] SPEAKER_02: of them that they have to go back to their family whatever like that what it's a that did weigh on
[00:54:13] SPEAKER_02: me but I also wanted the business to have this clarity and to move fast and to you know and from
[00:54:19] SPEAKER_02: the above and they like I will say the wrong people are really could be like that's bad can I
[00:54:25] SPEAKER_02: ask you about one thing here you said um I just don't know how to stop and sometimes it's not smart
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_01: and it costs me yeah it's like this is like the this is like the Jerry McGuire like you're gonna
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_02: make me cry Sam you're gonna do this yeah I mean I think if I if I look at like part of you know
[00:54:42] SPEAKER_02: it's it's even like we talked about that 80t thing it's like I just keep going like I just don't stop
[00:54:49] SPEAKER_02: and you know overall that's probably like you know I think and so I keep telling you young people
[00:54:55] SPEAKER_02: keep asking me like what should I do you know AI is coming out like I don't know where I should
[00:55:00] SPEAKER_02: go to college or what should I do and it's like just put yourself in a position where you can just
[00:55:04] SPEAKER_02: grind like just go grind because you just gotta get out like it's it's no one knows where the world's
[00:55:09] SPEAKER_02: gonna go no one knows what's happening you can't control the world everyone like acts as if they
[00:55:14] SPEAKER_02: can luck has to be your co-pilot and so just go out there and just just keep grinding and a lot
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_02: of those times in your grinding it's hard because when you can't actually see where it's getting you to
[00:55:25] SPEAKER_02: you talk to entrepreneurs that have already made it so it's like people say that the average
[00:55:29] SPEAKER_02: business takes seven years to be successful so we'll say to me so you're like it's kind of like you
[00:55:32] SPEAKER_02: knew when you started that you had seven years it's like no you don't ever know that it's gonna be
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_02: successful like it's the average it's just so I do think the grinding thing is it's under estimated
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_02: how hard that is to keep grinding because it's you don't see where it's going and you need
[00:55:49] sometimes to have these weird other factors happen that are out of outside of your control to make
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_02: your success happen just like Instagram coming out while we're building a camera at your front door
[00:56:01] SPEAKER_02: you know that's super powered our message I didn't build Instagram I didn't like push it out
[00:56:06] SPEAKER_02: there I didn't help it I didn't know it was coming but I kept grinding on my side and got lucky on
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_02: some of these other things one of the things I like that you told me was you look for products
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_00: where 90% of the marketing is already done and I called it last mile marketing and you're describing
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_00: how this worked in your favor at ring and how sometimes an entrepreneur can go wrong if you
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_00: if you really need to like educate the market about something completely from scratch yeah so it's
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_00: it's and I so I would call it pre-awareness so if you can if you can try to like give a little bit
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_02: of invention a little bit of differentiation to something that has pre-awareness
[00:56:45] SPEAKER_02: it's incredible because if you look at there's a cost just look at like the cost like
[00:56:49] SPEAKER_02: a new to world product you have the cost to tell someone about it is incredibly expensive like if
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_02: I have to tell you about some product and everything I have to tell you about it is new to world
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_02: it's very hard for you to understand it and like go to the film business like when it's a completely
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_02: new film it costs more to market it than top gun two because top gun two like you know everything
[00:57:11] SPEAKER_02: like you know top gun you know you know Tom Cruise like there's so much pre-awareness in that
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_02: the doorbell putting a camera on a doorbell and I got I sort of got lucky to learn this thing is
[00:57:21] SPEAKER_02: everyone knew where the doorbell was mounted they knew what the doorbell did they knew like the
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_02: functionality of it I just added like a piece to that I did the same thing to the flood light
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_02: camera you knew what a flood light looked like you know where it goes like you know what it does for
[00:57:33] SPEAKER_02: you and now you add a camera to it and so wherever you can use this pre-awareness I mean like liquid
[00:57:39] SPEAKER_02: death like it's water like you didn't have to tell someone like what this drink was or like it's
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_02: like but they changed like a piece of it and so I just think like changing a piece of it getting your
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_02: edge on it in something where there's pre-awareness great great way to start because you get billions
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_02: or hundreds of billions of dollars like in my case like the doorbell think about how much like
[00:57:59] SPEAKER_02: advertising sort of dollars or whatever like you want to call it um you know come from the doorbell
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_02: just being known for the last hundred years all right so I told everyone that um you know we give
[00:58:11] SPEAKER_01: a less we're like let's start with ideas let's start with shrung opinions and cool stories you have
[00:58:16] SPEAKER_01: one on here that actually was probably one of the most eye catching things I've ever read you bought
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_01: a town in Missouri is that right well I I I went to a town of Missouri that had um and a lot of these
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_02: small towns now if you go out into the Midwest and to some of these areas between like the opioid
[00:58:33] SPEAKER_02: issues industrial farming like these towns have just been just pummeled and this town La Belmazzura
[00:58:40] SPEAKER_02: when I went there was really like I'd say it was in it was in pretty tough shape you're actually
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_01: you're actually the second guest that we've had that has bought a town in Missouri the first is
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_01: Al Dohn he bought a small town he him and his mom own a knitting company that is a multi-hand
[00:58:56] SPEAKER_01: totally know that yeah it's amazing yeah so so basically Al and his mom uh his mom started at
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_01: then out I guess it's like running it where it's like a knitting company and he is bought a town in
[00:59:07] SPEAKER_01: Missouri and he calls it like Disneyland but for knitters yeah I think I think it is but it's
[00:59:12] SPEAKER_02: become this this places become like the mecca like people go there it's amazing uh by the way Al
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_01: I'm so sorry it's called Missouri quilting company it's I'm totally best I actually I do want to
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_02: I gotta talk to it some point because he's done some amazing stuff what I try to do though is just
[00:59:27] SPEAKER_02: a little different so they they've made it like it is it is an incredible destination they've done
[00:59:32] SPEAKER_02: an incredible like from what I've seen like an incredible job my thing was I really just wanted to
[00:59:38] SPEAKER_02: help bring this town again I'm an inventor I look at things that I see that are sort of not where
[00:59:44] SPEAKER_02: I believe they should be or a problem like again we want to our problem right like what's the problem
[00:59:47] SPEAKER_02: the problem is that this cute little town no longer has any business the sidewalks are broken
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_02: peep and also people's perspective had changed like how did you show up there though so I invested
[00:59:59] SPEAKER_02: in a business off of shark tank I went back on shark tank as a shark invested in a business called
[01:00:04] SPEAKER_02: Moink this woman uh Lucinda Cramsey from Lebell, Missouri and uh and she has this direct to consumer
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_02: meat company where we buy from small farmers and send it out very missionary really cool little
[01:00:16] SPEAKER_02: business and I go there and visit with my family and um I just like fall in love with the place my
[01:00:22] SPEAKER_02: son's running around on hay bells he doesn't even know what his phone is at that point like it's just
[01:00:26] SPEAKER_02: like you know we're coming from Los Angeles and he like it's just amazing and I ended up buying a
[01:00:33] SPEAKER_02: little farm there and fixing up the house and getting involved with the community the town was
[01:00:39] SPEAKER_02: really in sort of a tough place and so we started fixing up the sidewalks and like kind of the
[01:00:44] SPEAKER_02: broken windows theory of like if you kind of start fixing some stuff up you know with other people
[01:00:49] SPEAKER_02: join in there was a lot of like kind of trash on some lots and like kind of that kind of stuff and
[01:00:54] SPEAKER_02: so people started cleaning up their stuff we cleaned up the streets and the sidewalks we then
[01:00:58] SPEAKER_02: took the building that was broken on the side of the thing and fixed it up and made it into a beautiful
[01:01:02] SPEAKER_02: coffee shop there was no place if it's like crazy there was no place within an hour to sit with
[01:01:08] SPEAKER_02: someone during the day and talk to them about anything except the bar and and I like going to a bar
[01:01:14] SPEAKER_02: but a bar is not a great place to have like a civil discussion about things and so like the coffee shop
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_02: is an important fabric of the community so we brought the coffee shop there and it's like that
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_02: became cool and actually became successful and then we helped fix up the tavern in town I made it
[01:01:29] SPEAKER_02: this awesome it's like the coolest bar ever but it's like farm to table with organic grass fed beef
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_02: from my ranch no one even cares because out there they just like they're like wow whatever but it's
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_02: like literally the best food you'll ever have like anywhere it's like incredible it's like literally
[01:01:43] SPEAKER_02: the best like beef in the world and then a doctor put it off is there and a help clinic now and
[01:01:49] SPEAKER_02: that's been helping and the town's gotten healthier and as that happens people so it's like this again
[01:01:53] SPEAKER_02: this is the snowball factor like the the the incredible flywheel of you get things going and then
[01:02:00] SPEAKER_02: people sort of take it from there they also are like I don't want this you know Jamie the city
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_02: slicker from LA why is he making all the money like I want it out like it's great like have the
[01:02:09] SPEAKER_02: greed be there someone started building apartments like little apartments there it's a town of 700
[01:02:14] SPEAKER_02: it's amazing that's badass so what what do you think makes like there's all those like levers that
[01:02:20] SPEAKER_00: you talked about like you know the coffee shop so the people have this third place there's fixing
[01:02:24] SPEAKER_00: the sidewalks in the broken windows I imagine like I don't know sports or church there's like other
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_00: things that kind of like revitalize the community was there anything that surprised you that like how
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_00: how much of a difference it made like it seems small but actually it's pretty big what surprised me
[01:02:37] SPEAKER_02: or should I should say should didn't surprise me so when I went to it I'm like I'll just buy like
[01:02:42] SPEAKER_02: you said like I bought a town like and I did not like I I took part with others in the town to change
[01:02:47] SPEAKER_02: the perspective and so I was a catalyst but like it turned out you needed everyone so would you be
[01:02:52] SPEAKER_02: comfortable revealing how much like you had to invest or it's it's a good money it's it's quite a bit
[01:02:58] SPEAKER_02: but I'd say the the what really needed though was everyone to join in like it wasn't like you said
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_02: this is actually what's interesting is it wasn't the money like when I went there it's like I would
[01:03:08] SPEAKER_02: like I saw the town I'm like all right I check you know it's like sadly like I was like I'll
[01:03:12] SPEAKER_02: write a check and I'll like just fix this whole place up and it'll be nice like I'll just do that
[01:03:16] SPEAKER_02: like and then no one would even sell me any properties everyone was like like it and then I just
[01:03:21] SPEAKER_02: started to get involved in the town I drive my backhoe into town you know like with a bud light
[01:03:27] SPEAKER_02: and the cup holder and like you know talking to everyone and like they realize that I'm just
[01:03:31] SPEAKER_02: want to like I'm one of them and like we're just like a movie man and this is the scene where like
[01:03:36] SPEAKER_01: total this guy might be all right yeah and I did because like I am I love sitting out with them
[01:03:43] SPEAKER_02: at the side of a pickup truck watching this sunset on the farm and having a beer like I that's
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_02: my happiest place to be so and then I started we started fixing up the sidewalks and I went out
[01:03:52] SPEAKER_02: there and like I was part of it that was the other thing is truly being part of it it wasn't the
[01:03:56] SPEAKER_02: money it was like showing that support and then another guy in town like I'm gonna help fix this up
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_02: and I'm like great and we just it was you know it's like also a created ring it's like a thousand
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_02: things that we did it's not one thing and so it's like there was nothing that surprised me that was
[01:04:12] SPEAKER_02: like one thing we did I am surprised at the coffee shop I thought would lose money I just didn't
[01:04:17] SPEAKER_02: want it to lose too much money it actually makes money so that was surprising but I'd say what
[01:04:24] SPEAKER_02: the the unsurprising is it's like it's just it's it's also a long thing like it's been seven years
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_02: that I've been working on this now with the with the people there I'd say we're like now turning the
[01:04:35] SPEAKER_02: corner but it's probably another seven years to get it really where you'd hope it to be because
[01:04:40] SPEAKER_02: it's just like every year you do another project every year you do another thing like you can't just
[01:04:44] SPEAKER_02: do it all at once every four months in this podcast here's what happens you see Sean and I
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_01: sit on our hands like this if we just stare at you because we're in you got us too buddy if you guys
[01:04:59] SPEAKER_02: are in let's do a podcast from LeBel Missouri Sam I mean you can you know you can go visit home and
[01:05:04] SPEAKER_02: then and then come up so I'm well I've been for that that's I'm I'm what I was saying was I'm
[01:05:09] SPEAKER_01: in on Jamie I think it's so cool I mean even the way we said it was wrong it's not that you bought
[01:05:13] SPEAKER_00: a town you invested time and energy and ony into a town you invested kind of a piece of soul into it
[01:05:19] SPEAKER_00: and the idea is kind of like some places just need a little bit of that's like CPR just to bring
[01:05:25] SPEAKER_00: them back to life and get that you know it takes a little bit of pumping a catalyst like the
[01:05:30] SPEAKER_02: yeah like I was a catalyst but I was not the right it again it's like it is a business right like
[01:05:37] SPEAKER_02: it takes a team it takes everyone being on board everyone really like it's all these things are
[01:05:42] SPEAKER_02: the same thing like it's it's not just like getting venture capital money and you just make it like
[01:05:47] SPEAKER_02: you don't just like you know do that it's like it's very it's hard to build something great the
[01:05:53] the trip advisor page is pretty cool you guys named stuff really well it's called the top
[01:05:58] SPEAKER_01: places the milk weed in the tic tac motel tippy's bar and grill Stanley's diner I'm in I want to say
[01:06:08] SPEAKER_01: I want to stay in e at all those places all right that's awesome I think you know you know
[01:06:13] SPEAKER_00: in the sort of like I don't like the idea of legacy I think legacy is just sort of like a ego thing
[01:06:19] SPEAKER_00: but I do think we do get remembered for certain things by others and it's not always what we expect
[01:06:25] SPEAKER_00: it is not always in our control and I think what you're doing here is is really cool this would be
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_00: if you're on a TED talk I you know I actually want to hear this story more than the the ring story
[01:06:35] SPEAKER_00: I think it's it's such a cool life resume you know win and I'm sure it's been very like satisfying
[01:06:40] SPEAKER_00: and fulfilling in a way that just doing another company or hitting another like quarterly sales goal
[01:06:46] SPEAKER_00: would never do for you at this stage and so I think it's pretty awesome to hear that because I think
[01:06:50] SPEAKER_00: you know we all want to we're in the game of entrepreneurship initially for the success and then
[01:06:56] SPEAKER_00: satisfy some insecurity get some financial independence but then why do you stay in the game well
[01:07:01] SPEAKER_00: it's because it's fun to play and to like these projects are just vehicles this is like workout
[01:07:06] SPEAKER_00: equipment it's you're there to like to go for a ride you're there for just need to grow a little bit
[01:07:11] SPEAKER_00: and so I think this is a really cool project that that you did the entrepreneurs should be making
[01:07:15] SPEAKER_02: the world better and so like whether it's on a big scale small scale whatever like we should just
[01:07:19] SPEAKER_02: be like working to do that is this going to be like a second act for you I mean this is like
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_01: first of all this is like you know I don't we have to figure out how these story ends and like
[01:07:27] SPEAKER_01: hopefully there's a good like very tending of it like the town thrives or whatever but like is
[01:07:31] SPEAKER_01: there like a book here is there a movie here because it seems like a pretty like pretty funny and
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_01: like interesting tale I maybe I don't know I kind of just would hope that I just wish more people
[01:07:44] SPEAKER_02: would go do this like I just think like we need to like it's like if we could use if all the people
[01:07:49] SPEAKER_02: that have learned so much could use their brains and a little bit of their capital to do this like
[01:07:55] SPEAKER_02: we would solve so many problems because it is going to the root of the problem like like we look we
[01:08:00] SPEAKER_02: keep we always treat the output of the problems like we have hospitals to treat people that have had
[01:08:05] SPEAKER_02: sugar all their lives but we don't stop people from eating sugar and then we try to tell them not
[01:08:11] SPEAKER_02: to eat sugar but we actually don't like do things to make sure that like they understand why and so
[01:08:15] SPEAKER_02: it's like I think like part of this is like if you look at this this area now it's like healthier like
[01:08:21] SPEAKER_02: it's like all these things it's so how do you like how do you figure out like the root of problems
[01:08:25] SPEAKER_02: and fixing it so I'd say like Lebel is just like one of I don't even know 5,000 towns in the US I have
[01:08:31] SPEAKER_02: the same thing and if you grow up like that you know there's going to be like societal issues that come
[01:08:38] SPEAKER_02: from if we leave areas behind and so we think like I'm in New York City right now I'm from Missouri I'm
[01:08:44] SPEAKER_01: in New York City right now and there's the Langone hospital nearby and this is you know the guy
[01:08:49] SPEAKER_01: started Home Depot probably donated a billion dollars to start this hospital but then like a four
[01:08:53] blocks away this is other hospital this other hospital this other hospital is all rich guys and
[01:08:57] SPEAKER_01: that's wonderful you know great but what is not talked about is like middle America or like you know
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_01: instead of like donating to different countries like it's it's not particularly accessible in terms
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_01: of it's top of mind or it's even thought of as a thing of like investing into a small town but it
[01:09:15] SPEAKER_01: seems like a really awesome way to give directly to the recipients but also the the teaching them
[01:09:22] SPEAKER_01: how to fish to kind of idea of like look I'm I'm helping it's our town it's your town and I'm just
[01:09:27] SPEAKER_01: here as a part of it and it makes it just a little bit better which snowballs into something bigger
[01:09:33] SPEAKER_01: and that's really fascinating because every rich person or a lot of research members they want
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_01: to do dope shit they do want legacy and like it seems like a really great option I think it isn't
[01:09:45] SPEAKER_02: where you can also use like your superpower what you've learned like you can actually like
[01:09:49] SPEAKER_02: impart your knowledge it's not it's not just money it's like money obviously does help but you
[01:09:53] SPEAKER_02: need a little bit of that like spark to help but it's not cash it's like actually more about using
[01:09:58] SPEAKER_02: your brain and helping and by the way what you learn from it like what I've learned from being
[01:10:03] SPEAKER_02: there is incredible like that's the other side like we just share more a lot of the tech guys it's
[01:10:09] SPEAKER_01: like you know cool to be in politics right now and I've that is not my personal inspiration
[01:10:15] SPEAKER_01: and I hear a story like this and I'm like man that sounds so much more helpful and very fascinating
[01:10:20] SPEAKER_01: yeah very cool Jamie well I appreciate you coming on telling the story shout out the book it just
