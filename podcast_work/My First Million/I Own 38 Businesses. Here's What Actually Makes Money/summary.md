# Summary: Andrew Wilkinson on Business Models, Public Criticism, and Having the Courage to Be Disliked

## 1. Key Themes

### The Power and Peril of Permanent Capital Investment Structures

Andrew makes a crucial distinction between traditional hedge funds and permanent capital vehicles. Traditional hedge funds face the vulnerability of capital withdrawals, which can force them to sell positions at inopportune times. In contrast, structures like Berkshire Hathaway and Pershing Square Holdings have permanent capital where investors trade shares among themselves rather than withdrawing from the fund directly.

"Typically a hedge fund manager would say, let's say I give a hedge fund manager a million dollars, I can withdraw that capital. And the only way that they can give me that money back is by selling stock... Whereas someone like Buffett or Ackman, people are just trading the stock certificates, right? Those are just ownership shares." [[00:28:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=28m20s)

He ranks Bill Ackman's Pershing Square as S-tier because of this structure combined with the fee model: "Bill, for example, he went out, he raised hundreds of millions of dollars, he bought a bunch of stocks, he would go and advocate for these companies to improve, and then he would take fees on that... you actually don't need to really put that much money into it yourself and you can make a profound amount of money if you perform." [[00:27:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=26m51s)

The efficiency is staggering: "Bill's business, for example, he simply just goes out and he buys 10 stocks. And he has 50 employees and he makes hundreds and hundreds of millions. Sometimes some years, I think he makes billions." [[00:29:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=29m22s)

### The Curse of Labels and the Courage to Be Disliked

Andrew describes a profound realization about how society constrains people through labels and expectations. He tells the story of his father, a retired architect, who wanted to become a real estate developer but was paralyzed by the fear of what people would think.

"He goes, what do you think someone's gonna say? If I suddenly call them up, they know me as architect David. And all of a sudden I'm pitching them on a real estate development. People don't like it when you leave your box and through." [[00:54:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=54m1s)

This led Andrew to a broader insight: "I realized we're all like prison guards. Like we all have these labels... I'm an investor and an entrepreneur. But then it goes deeper. It's like, I'm in tech, not real estate. You know, no real estate allowed. I'm bootstrapped. You can't do venture. That's weird if you do that." [[00:55:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=54m50s)

He found liberation in a book called "The Courage to Be Disliked": "The core idea is just like seeking recognition is a trap. It's impossible to make everybody happy. And if you try, you're gonna end up living somebody else's life. And so you have to be hated. You have to have the courage to be disliked." [[00:58:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=57m51s)

### The Hidden Trap of Agency and Service Business Economics

Despite Metal Lab generating "hundreds of millions of dollars of profits" [[00:22:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=22m14s), Andrew only ranks agencies as a C-tier business. The core problem is the feast-or-famine nature and the client dependency risk.

"The worst thing that happens in these businesses is you win a client like Walmart, let's say. They come along and they say, hey, we want to give you $10 million of work over the next year. And so you start panicking, you go out, you hire 30 people and then a new PM takes over that team at Walmart and they just cut your budget. And all of a sudden you're left with 30 people you have to lay off." [[00:07:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=7m1s)

The key differentiator for successful agencies is the nature of the service: "If you have that, that's not really high quality consulting business. However, if you have a $500, let's say that you hired 30 people in the Philippines and you do graphic design for $500, you might have months where you're making $300,000 and then you might have months where you're making nothing because you're not getting any clients." [[00:06:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=6m32s)

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Angel Investing is "Like Playing Roulette" - An E-Tier Business

Andrew ranks angel investing as E-tier (near the bottom), which goes against Silicon Valley conventional wisdom that celebrates angel investors who got into Uber or Airbnb early.

"I view angel investing a little bit like playing roulette. I like to play poker. It has better odds. I look at private equity or buying businesses more like poker." [[00:36:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=36m36s)

He backs this with painful personal experience: "When I first started out, I got in the habit of angel investing. I have $30 million or something tied up in angel investment completely illiquid. I have no access to it. I'd much rather own stocks and real estate or something." [[00:37:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=37m47s)

The insight is that entrepreneurs who make money often angel invest to "pay it forward" without realizing they're making poor financial decisions driven by narrative and FOMO rather than sound investment logic.

### Marketplaces Are Only C-Tier (Not As Good As People Think)

Andrew controversially ranks marketplace businesses as only C-tier, even though successful examples like Airbnb are clearly exceptional. His reasoning is based on the difficulty of actually making one work.

"I would say a good marketplace like Airbnb at say an A. I'd rank marketplace in general as a C." [[00:28:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=28m13s)

He explains: "I think small marketplaces are really hard. We own some. And I think it's like lightning in a bottle. If you can get supply and demand to match their phenomenal businesses, but they're highly competitive." [[00:32:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=32m20s)

The key is the difficulty of achieving network effects: "If you started a marketplace for people who want to borrow, let's say like construction tools or something like that. Oh my God, like I've just seen a million of these fail. They're so difficult." [[00:34:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=34m4s)

### SaaS is Being Commoditized by AI - Pivot to Hardware Integration

Andrew expresses a contrarian view on SaaS that most investors would disagree with, ranking it only B-tier when it's been the darling of venture capital for a decade.

"Over the last two years, like I got really scared of buying software companies because you look at vibe coding and LLMs and I just think like LLMs increasingly can build software and it's not that it's gonna put all these businesses, let's say you have a SaaS software company and there's 10 competitors five years ago, I just think there's gonna be 50 or 100 competitors in the future and when that happens, competition equals margin compression." [[00:11:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=11m2s)

His exception is SaaS with hardware moats: "SaaS with a hardware mode is pretty incredible." [[00:13:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=13m0s) He uses Serato (DJ software) as an example: "They partnered with the hardware manufacturers like Pioneer and they deeply integrated into the hardware. And so what that means is that A, it's become the standard... Most DJs use one of two pieces of software, either record box or Serato." [[00:12:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=12m11s)

### Real Estate Has a Ceiling Problem

Andrew only ranks real estate as C-tier despite it being a wealth-building staple, because of its inherent limitations.

"I don't like anything with a ceiling. You know, if you buy, let's say you buy a 40-10 apartment building or something like that... you can get an increased yield by increasing the rent, but there's a ceiling on that rent, and you can't innovate to make more money. Whereas in a business, let's say a digital business like a web design agency or software company, you can take your profits, and you can actually grow the business and you can increase revenue." [[00:24:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=24m22s)

He also points out the liquidity trap: "I know a lot of really wealthy real estate people and I've been fascinated by how illiquid it is. So you'll meet people who have $2 billion of real estate, but the actual profits that come out of it are like $20 million a year, which is amazing, right? It's made their family wealthy. The bank understands that they live a good life, but they don't actually have that much liquidity." [[00:25:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=25m33s)

### Being Unlabelable is a Competitive Advantage

Andrew argues that refusing to stay in a box actually creates more opportunity, contrary to conventional wisdom about focus and branding.

"If you're just interesting and you share what you're doing, like Kevin Rose does, really interesting things come to you. And I would argue like most of our best businesses come from me... I was in Auckland with Tim Ferris randomly. And I was in town and I went, oh, there's this guy who runs Letterbox there. I should have a coffee with him and that coffee, literally, I had coffee with Matt and I made an offer for the business within four hours." [[00:48:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=48m32s)

He contrasts this with the "autistic super genius investor" model: "I don't know that anybody listens to, you know, the autistic super genius talk about his formula and spreadsheet for buying a type of business and goes, I wanna do business with that guy. I wanna sell my business to that person." [[01:09:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=1h9m16s)

## 3. Companies Identified

### **Serato (DJ Software)**
A New Zealand-based DJ software company that Tiny acquired. It's a showcase of SaaS with hardware integration creating defensibility.

**Revenue/Metrics:** "$45 million of revenue, $15 million of EBITDA. It's been growing like crazy, moving into a SaaS model from licensing." [[00:13:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=13m6s)

**Why Excellent:** "They partnered with the hardware manufacturers like Pioneer and they deeply integrated into the hardware. And so what that means is that A, it's become the standard... Most DJs use one of two pieces of software, either record box or Serato... the manufacturers frankly, they don't wanna integrate with some random college kid who's vibe coded some AI DJ." [[00:12:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=12m11s)

### **Pershing Square Holdings (Bill Ackman)**
A permanent capital investment vehicle that Andrew holds up as the gold standard business model.

**Structure:** "50 employees, I think he manages, how much does Bill Ackman manage? 16 to 20 billion somewhere in there." [[00:29:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=29m22s)

**Why Excellent:** "Bill has made so many incredible investments... in 2012 or 2013, Bill had raised, I believe it was like $4 billion of permanent capital in Pershing Square Holdings. And Bill was able to basically bet on himself." [[00:33:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=33m3s) The permanent capital structure allowed him to survive when "his investors lost faith in him and a lot of them pulled their cash" from his hedge fund during the Valeant/Herbalife crisis. [[00:33:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=32m57s)

### **Metal Lab**
Andrew's original design agency that has been the financial engine for everything else.

**Lifetime Value:** "I think we're probably well over into the hundreds of millions of dollars of profits, not revenue." [[00:22:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=22m14s)

**Why Excellent:** "MetaLab was the business, like I said, I started with zero and now does very significant earnings and revenue... it did so much defining work in like 2008, 2015, where we designed the first version of Slack. We worked on all sorts of projects that were kind of groundbreaking. And we planted our flag and built a reputation." [[00:08:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=7m54s)

### **Z1 (Spanish Agency)**
A small acquisition that demonstrates the power of strategic deal flow from existing businesses.

**Acquisition:** "We acquired that business for $300,000 or something. And we've probably made single digit millions of profit in it." [[00:09:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=8m51s)

**Why Excellent:** "The theory there was literally just, MetaLab gets a ton of leads that are too small for it. So let's buy another smaller agency and let's just send them those leads." [[00:08:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=8m37s) - Shows the power of deal flow synergies.

### **Letterbox**
A social network for movie enthusiasts that Andrew acquired through serendipity.

**How Acquired:** "I happened to be in Auckland with Tim Ferris randomly. And I was in town and I went, oh, there's this guy who runs Letterbox there. I should have a coffee with him and that coffee, literally, I had coffee with Matt and I made an offer for the business within four hours." [[00:48:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=48m49s)

**Context:** Part of the $200 million fund managed by Tiny. Demonstrates how being "unlabelable" creates deal flow - Andrew was interested in film investing, which led him to discover Letterbox.

## 4. Operating Insights

### The "$4-5 Million Seed" Compounding Machine

Andrew reveals that Tiny started with just $4-5 million in initial capital and never took additional funding: "We basically sat down and said, okay, we're going to start this thing called tiny. I'm going to own 80%. You're going to own 20%... Chris put in 500K or a million bucks and I put in the rest and that's it. We never put any more money in." [[00:42:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=42m2s)

This insight shows that you don't need massive capital to start a permanent capital vehicle - you need discipline and the ability to compound through acquisitions. They've grown this to over "$250 million of revenue... $40 million of EBITDA" [[00:45:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=45m24s) while maintaining founder control.

### The Magnet Strategy for Deal Flow

Rather than having a rigid investment thesis, Andrew advocates for creating a "magnet" that attracts interesting opportunities by being publicly interesting yourself.

"I think you need to create that magnet for interesting people and entrepreneurs to seek you out... these things happen randomly. And I think you need to create that magnet for interesting people and entrepreneurs to seek you out." [[01:09:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=1h9m3s)

This contrasts with the traditional private equity playbook of having a specific sector focus and systematically calling companies. Instead, he shares interesting things he's doing, which attracts founders who want to work with him.

### The "3,000 Times" Test for Content and Projects

When deciding what to work on, Andrew and the host discuss a powerful framework: "What would I have fun doing 3000 times? Because if I do it 3000 times, I'm probably gonna get good at it and I'm probably gonna stick with it and then I'm probably gonna get a good result, sure. But like more importantly, I'm gonna go do it 3000 times." [[01:15:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=1h15m36s)

This shifts the focus from "what will be successful" to "what can I sustain" - which paradoxically leads to better outcomes because you'll actually persist long enough to get good at it.

### Investor Transparency During Down Markets

Andrew provides a masterclass in handling public criticism of stock performance. He reframes the narrative: "We started in 2006, basically 20 years ago, bootstrapped this business until 2023, when we went public. And over the last 10 years, I think since we started tiny, we've compounded it 25%, our earnings at 25%." [[00:45:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=45m3s)

The key insight is that the public chart starts at the bubble peak, not when the actual business value was built: "We didn't take a public at 1.2 billion, but that first day, that's where the chart starts, right? And then the mania is over and the chart starts going down." [[00:50:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=50m37s)

## 5. Overlooked Insights

### The Prison Guard Phenomenon - We Police Each Other Into Mediocrity

Andrew touches on something profound that most people miss: we're not just imprisoned by our own limiting beliefs, we actively police others who try to escape their boxes.

"Have you ever had a restaurant or a friend who pitches you on a tech startup they're starting on a sudden or your yoga instructor gets their real estate license, they wanna sell your house or whatever it is? My mental reaction, I hate this about myself. My mental reaction is staying your lane. I don't like it. It makes me uncomfortable." [[00:54:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=54m17s)

This is a massive insight because it explains why even successful people stay in lanes that no longer serve them - it's not just their own fear, it's the active resistance from their entire social circle. The implication is that to truly break free, you need to be willing to lose relationships or at least accept significant social friction.

The downstream effect of this is that most successful people plateau not because they can't figure out what to do next, but because the social cost of reinvention is too high. Andrew estimates his "two to three percent hate quota" [[01:09:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=1h9m29s) but that's after already being wealthy and established - for someone earlier in their journey, the social costs would be even higher.

### The Ephemeral vs. Permanent Content Dichotomy

Andrew briefly mentions something that reveals a deep truth about content creation and happiness: "There's something so ephemeral about podcasting and tweeting and all the other stuff" [[01:17:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=1h17m12s) versus creating something permanent like a book.

This is significant because in the creator economy, there's an obsession with volume and consistency - daily posts, weekly podcasts, constant engagement. But Andrew found his "happiest I've been in the last 10 years is writing my book, just headphones on, doing something and actually shipping something that will be relevant hopefully in 20 years that you can go back to." [[01:17:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOi2DtTVm7o&t=1h17m3s)

This suggests a potential crisis coming in the creator economy where successful creators realize that despite all the engagement and revenue, the ephemeral nature of the work leaves them feeling empty. The implication for operators is to build in some "permanent" projects alongside the ephemeral content mill - whether that's a book, a course, or something else that feels more like building a cathedral than laying bricks.
