[00:00:00] We have 65 million of ARR.
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_00: We do over $40 million of EBITDA.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: We also manage a $200 million fund.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_00: So we're over 300 million in revenue across 30 businesses
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_00: and all the businesses in the fund are profitable as well.
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I'm kind of like,
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: if that's failing, like, sign me up, right?
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_00: You've owned a number of agencies.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_01: How much revenue lifetime has Metal Lab generated for you?
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_00: The hundreds of millions of dollars of profits.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_00: Not revenue.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: I don't know that I would still rank it very highly though.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_00: Sass.
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_00: Where are you putting sass?
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: I would say it's a...
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_01: What do you think about Marketplace?
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_01: Well, I would say it comes down to scale.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: A good marketplace like Airbnb at San A.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: I'd rank Marketplaces in general.
[00:00:39] That's the one I would disagree with you with.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: I feel like I gotta ask you this because I think you get
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_01: a lot of shit nowadays.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_01: Think a lot of people go look at the tiny stock
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: and then they click like max.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_01: And basically you see just a downward trend.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_01: A lot of people I see on Twitter want to kind of look at that
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: and say, oh, this guy calls himself the Warren Buffet
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: of the internet and he says he buys his great businesses.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: But what's going on?
[00:01:07] What's up?
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_01: Andrew is here.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: Andrew is one of the most visited guests on the pod.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_01: Always good to have you, man.
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_01: I wanted to play a game with you.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_01: You've done many types of businesses.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_01: You've done agencies and private equity
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_01: and you've started e-commerce companies.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_01: You've done a huge number of companies in the last 20 years.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_01: So I want to do a game where we rank the different types
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_01: of businesses that you could start.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: And we could work out this criteria together.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: But I think the idea should be,
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_01: we're not looking at the outlier scenarios.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_01: So in every industry, right?
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: The world's best plumber makes it fantastic living.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_01: That may not mean that plumbing is the best trade
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_01: to go into.
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_01: No offense to the plumbers out there listening.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_01: But we're not looking at just the extreme outlier.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_01: So I think that here's my criteria for a great business.
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_01: It's gonna be the median successful outcome.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so like the sort of normal case,
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_01: if you can make it work.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_01: That's the first criteria.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_01: The second thing is we're taking into account
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_01: both the lifestyle as well as the result, the upside.
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: So if one thing is just makes you miserable
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_01: or overworked, you're like crazy,
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_01: then that would be obviously worse than a business
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: that lets you have a great flexible schedule
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_01: and flexible location, for example.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_01: So lifestyle matters, upside matters,
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: and we're looking for kind of the median success case.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_01: But in some of these, it's gonna be like dude,
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_01: it's median success.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: I mean, only the top 0.1% make it.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_01: So you have to factor that in.
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_01: The likelihood of success matters in these scenarios.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_01: Okay, if you're listening on audio,
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_01: it's gonna be a little more fun if you go to YouTube
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_01: or go to Spotify and actually you can see on screen
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_01: the stuff that we're sharing.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: All right, so here we go.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_01: Here's the tier list.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: If you've never seen a tier list before,
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_01: they're ranked as you would expect sort of A, B, C, D, E, F,
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_01: A being better than F.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_01: But there is of course, S tier.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: And I don't even really know what S tier stands for.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: I think it's like from the gaming world,
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_01: but it's basically like S tier is sort of like God tier.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_01: It's the best you can, it's the best of the best.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so we're gonna start with a little layup here.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_01: And for each Android, I want you to give me
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: your almost like rapid fire take on like,
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: you know, kind of what this business is,
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_01: why it's either great or why it sucks.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so the first one we're gonna do,
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: easy and MLM, which is actually
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_01: a surprisingly common business that people get into.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_01: If you just look at the raw numbers of people
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: who take part in MLMs.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_01: So MLM, where are you rankin' it?
[00:03:30] I mean, I would rank in MLM as an app.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_00: It's a fundamentally unsustainable business that breaks.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: I mean, the problem with the MLM is it's reliant
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_00: on recruiting other people.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: And it doesn't actually make money
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_00: based on selling services.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: It basically makes money by finding the next sucker.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_00: And if the person that starts the MLM finds a lot of suckers,
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: they can make a lot of money.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: And the first couple layers can make a ton of money,
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: but then it always explodes,
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: or they get indicted or something like that.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_00: So where are you rankin' it?
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: I would say that's enough.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_00: Okay, it's going on the app.
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_01: Although it does sound like for the MLM owner,
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_01: it's not necessarily enough.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_01: You know, one of the associates, or as they call them,
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_01: you know, the business owners that they like to call themselves
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_01: that are underneath, yeah, that's after here for them.
[00:04:22] I think if you are willing to go to jail too,
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_00: like you can make a lot of money, but I mean,
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: like 50, 50 odds you go to jail.
[00:04:29] All right, next one up is one that I think you did it.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_01: By the way, say if you've done any of these, okay?
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_01: So freelancer, which I believe is how you started your career.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_01: You were a freelance web designer?
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, I started making websites
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: out of my apartment basically.
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: I would rank that probably a D.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: I think it's a really good business.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: I'd say it's a living, right?
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: I think there's nothing wrong with freelancing
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_00: or a restaurant or a corner store or that sort of thing,
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: but fundamentally it's an owner operator model
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_00: and it doesn't really scale unless you scale it,
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_00: which is what I did.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay, well that's the kind of the next one,
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_01: which is actually agency.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_01: You've owned a number of agencies.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: You've probably made, I don't know,
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_01: I don't know what the number is, but
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_01: Metal Lab has to have generated something
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: like 200 million plus in revenue.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_01: How much revenue lifetime has Metal Lab generated for you?
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_01: Your design agency?
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_01: I don't know the exact math,
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: but I think we're probably well over
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: into the hundreds of millions of dollars of profits,
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: not revenue.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I'm assuming you might have agency higher
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_01: than most people.
[00:05:39] So I think, well, you know what,
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_00: I don't know that I would still rank it very highly though.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: You know, the reason some, you know,
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: my story, I started a web design agency.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: I scaled it, I got clients like YouTube and Uber and Walmart
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_00: and all these big companies and I was terrified.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's a business where you're either
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_00: making a ton of money or you're about to go out of business
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: constantly and you swing between those two things.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: And so because of that lumpy nature,
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: I'd maybe give it a C, but it'd be a tentative C.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: It would kind of, yeah, it's really, really a hard business.
[00:06:15] And the hard part is you're saying,
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_01: clients come and go.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_01: It's that one, it can be Feast or Fam and with clients.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_01: Is that the reason why or is it the headache
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_01: of operating and delivering the service?
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_01: What is it about the agency that makes it like?
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_01: Well, let's say and do.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_01: Instead of web design, let's imagine you're an accountant
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: and you start an accounting firm
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: and you start auditing 30 companies.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: Now, companies don't like to switch accountants
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: and they don't like to switch auditors.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: So if you have that, that's not really high quality
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: consulting business.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: However, if you have a $500, let's say that you hired 30
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: people in the Philippines and you do graphic design
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: for $500, you might have months where you're making $300,000
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: and then you might have months where you're making nothing
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_00: because you're not getting any clients.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: The worst thing that happens in these businesses is
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: you win a client like Walmart, let's say.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: They come along and they say, hey, we want to give you $10 million
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: of work over the next year.
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_00: And so you start panicking, you go out, you hire 30 people
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: and then a new PM takes over that team at Walmart
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: and they just cut your budget.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_00: And all of a sudden you're left with 30 people
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: you have to lay off.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_00: So I think it depends on the nature of the business honestly.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_00: So you did MetaLab.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_01: You've also had a game design agency.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_01: You've had like a no-code agency.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_01: You've had probably what, six to 10 different?
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_01: 10 to 15 agencies and services, business copywriting,
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: social media, web development, design, a lot of different stuff.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_00: What were the sort of top two agencies you did
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: and what were the sort of bottom two agencies you did?
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_01: Well, I would say that we really haven't had a lot of success
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: with recreating the success of MetaLab.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: MetaLab was the business, like I said, I started with zero
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_00: and now does very significant earnings and revenue.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_00: A lot of the other agencies have not hit in the same way.
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_00: And I think the distinction with MetaLab is
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_00: it did so much defining work in like 2008, 2015,
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: where we designed the first version of Slack.
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_00: We worked on all sorts of projects that were kind of groundbreaking.
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_00: And we planted our flag and built a reputation.
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: And so I think the reputation piece is hard to recreate.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: And so we've had a lot of success with MetaLab.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: We had a lot of success acquiring a company called Z1,
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_00: which is in Spain.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: There are a smaller web design agency.
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: And the theory there was literally just,
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_00: MetaLab gets a ton of leads that are too small for it.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: So let's buy another smaller agency
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_00: and let's just send them those leads.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_00: And so I think we acquired that business
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_00: for $300,000 or something.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_00: And we've probably made single digit millions of profit in it.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_00: So we didn't knock it out of the park,
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_00: but it's just an amazing base hit.
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_00: Right, right.
[00:09:13] Hey, what's up?
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_01: If you're liking this episode, the research team at HubSpot
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_01: has taken all the rankings that we're doing today
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_01: in this episode and they made it a downloadable thing.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: In case you want to go see the final tier list,
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_01: you want to download it and maybe have a little breakdown
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_01: of our commentary for each one.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_01: It's available in the show notes below.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_01: You can go ahead download it totally free.
[00:09:33] Okay, next one up, SaaS.
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_01: Were you putting SaaS?
[00:09:38] I would say it's a B probably.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_00: I think, again, it depends on the type of SaaS.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: If you have a SaaS software that is a chat GPT thin wrapper
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: and does something like put a funny nose on your friend's face
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: and you trick people into subscribing to it for six months
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: and they always churn, I'd say that's a pretty bad SaaS business.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_00: If you have a SaaS business that let's say
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: has become the dominant player in Funeral Home management
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: and all the Funeral Homes use it
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_00: and they don't want to switch because it's the standard,
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_00: that's an incredible SaaS business.
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_00: I mean, SaaS businesses, they're often highly recurring,
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_00: really good margins.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: I mean, they can be incredible,
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_00: but you really have to find something
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_00: with a limited amount of competition or high switching costs.
[00:10:26] Tell the quick story of the DJ software SaaS business
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_01: because that's kind of like the Funeral Home example you have.
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_01: So you're saying, it's a vertical niche tool
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_01: that's like mission critical for an industry to run on.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_01: They're unlikely to ever switch
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_01: and that's gonna be super, super sticky
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_01: for a long time with high margins.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_01: It sounds like, I don't know a lot about the DJ software business,
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: but can you just tell the quick story of that one?
[00:10:52] Yeah, I mean, for the last 10 years,
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_00: everybody has been basically like obsessed
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: with buying SaaS software companies
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_00: and thinking you can't lose in that industry,
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: which right now is still true.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: But over the last two years,
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_00: like I got really scared of buying software companies
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_00: because you look at vibe coding and LLMs
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_00: and I just think like LLMs increasingly can build software
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_00: and it's not that it's gonna put all these businesses,
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: let's say you have a SaaS software company
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_00: and there's 10 competitors five years ago,
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_00: I just think there's gonna be 50 or 100 competitors
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_00: in the future and when that happens,
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_00: competition equals margin compression.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_00: So we've basically said no to almost every single SaaS software company
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_00: we've looked at over the last two years,
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: but one came across our desk that we could not say no to
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_00: and that was Serato.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever DJed Sean?
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: Did we go through that life crisis?
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_00: You know what, I appreciate to even think it's possible
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_01: that I look like a guy who's DJed before.
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_01: So I take that as a compliment, but no.
[00:11:52] I had a phase in like 2012
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_00: whereas trying to meet girls and I learned how to DJ
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_00: and so I kind of knew the industry
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_00: and the dominant software company in that world
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: for the last 25 years I think is a company called Serato
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_00: and it's an incredible piece of software.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_00: I mean DJs all over the world use it.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_00: I think like Diplo, you know, a gazillion of the top DJs
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_00: and these two guys in New Zealand built it
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_00: and what they did was really smart.
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_00: They partnered with the hardware manufacturers
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_00: like Pioneer and they deeply integrated into the hardware.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: And so what that means is that
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_00: A, it's become the standard, right?
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: So when you're the standard, that is really exceptional.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_00: Most DJs use one of two pieces of software,
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_00: either record box or Serato, right?
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_00: So very limited competition and there's lots of upstarts
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_00: and stuff but once someone really integrates
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: into an ecosystem like Serato,
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_00: they're buying like $5,000 of hardware,
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_00: they're not gonna switch off really easily.
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: And the manufacturers frankly,
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_00: they don't wanna integrate with some random college kid
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: who's vibe coded some AI DJ.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: You know, not to say that people can't come and compete
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: with us, it's just harder because it's not,
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: it doesn't have a hardware mode.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_00: So I think SaaS with a hardware mode is pretty incredible.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_00: You know, that business, we shared some of the numbers
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_00: when we bought it.
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's doing $45 million of revenue,
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_00: $15 million of EBITDA.
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_00: It's been growing like crazy,
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_00: moving into a SaaS model from licensing.
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_00: I'm a huge fan of that business.
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_00: Why does a business like that grow?
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_01: Like are there just way more DJs or something else?
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_01: I think as long as a DJ is a desirable thing to be,
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: I mean, if you think about it,
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_00: one of the weirdest phenomenons,
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_00: you know, when I would go to a nightclub,
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_00: it doesn't matter how much money I have in my bank account.
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: I remember looking around and going,
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_00: oh man, there's all these great girls here,
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_00: but none of them know that, you know,
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: I've got all these businesses,
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_00: and I'm a cool guy or whatever.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: And you literally, they don't know
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_01: I have a design agency.
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_01: Exactly how much do you have?
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_01: But like I looked up,
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_00: I actually had a friend who's a DJ,
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_00: and he would get paid like 200 bucks and some beer tickets,
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_00: and he'd be swarmed with girls and he'd have status
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_00: and throughout the city he'd be the man.
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_00: And so I think as long as that's true,
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_00: as long as young men think DJs are cool and women,
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_00: I'm increasingly, there's way more female DJs now,
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_00: I just met an amazing one yesterday.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: But as long as that's true,
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_00: I think people are gonna wanna do it.
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's just fun to mix music,
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: and you can become famous,
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_00: you can, you know, express yourself.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_00: So I don't know, as long as that's true,
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_00: it's like we've got one of the toll roads to achieving that.
[00:14:41] Yeah, I like the analogy of the toll road.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_01: Okay, next one I'm gonna do,
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_01: actually I'll do it easy one, restaurant.
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_01: I think you've owned it,
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_01: I think you own or still own a restaurant?
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I own a bunch of restaurants actually.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_00: And I always say a restaurant is a really good passion.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: If you're really passionate about it, you love food.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_00: It's a labor of love.
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_00: As you know, I know you have sushi restaurant,
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_00: but I have, when I meet somebody and they say,
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_00: I have a successful restaurant,
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: I wanna like, like Wayne's world,
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_00: get down on my knees and say, I'm not worthy,
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_00: because if you're successful in a restaurant,
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: I just, it is one of the hardest businesses.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_00: If you think about, for you to go in and eat a good meal
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: at 6 p.m., people had to wake up at three in the morning,
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_00: they had to bake bread, a million things had to go right,
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: they had to train 30 people.
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_00: It's just like a Rube Goldberg machine of business.
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: So I would rank it as an E,
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_00: probably one of the hardest businesses,
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_00: and low margin and difficult.
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for people to get contacts,
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_01: most successful restaurants,
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_01: even the big chains, like a subway or a Chipotle or things like that.
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_01: 10% margin is the good case scenario.
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_01: It's like that's doing well.
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: Of course, you know, there's exceptions,
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_01: like luxury, you know, sort of Michelin star restaurants
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_01: might have higher margins, but on the whole,
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: if 10% is winning and then your,
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_01: but your revenue is capped at what you can produce,
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: because again, you're working seven days a week.
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_01: You're there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: You, you know, you basically, you can't,
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: that you always have to be there,
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_01: you always have to go in and make the product again,
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_01: fresh every single day,
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: and you're only as good as the,
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_01: you're sort of last interaction with the customer.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_01: It is just such a brutal business.
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_01: It is, it is an absolutely terrible business.
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_01: In fact, it's funny that the only business you've ranked
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: below it so far is an MLM.
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_01: That's pretty much a crime.
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_01: It's the only thing that's been worth so far.
[00:16:35] And you know, like I said, like we own restaurants,
[00:16:38] SPEAKER_00: I think they're really important,
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: but I just don't, if you wanna make money
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_00: and you wanna get rich,
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_00: I don't think that's a good way to do it.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_00: It's like, I always use the gym analogy.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: If you go into the gym and you try and deadlift
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: 300 pounds on day one, you will hurt your back
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_00: and never come back.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_00: And I think entrepreneurs who go into restaurants,
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: they have a rough go.
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:17:02] All right, next one, marketplace.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_01: So an online marketplace,
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: how do you think about marketplace?
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_01: This would be something like whether it's Etsy
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_01: or an eBay or an Amazon,
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_01: or it could be even marketplaces like Angel List
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_01: as a marketplace, Twitch is a marketplace.
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_01: Anywhere where there's suppliers, there's supply and demand,
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_01: there's creators and viewers,
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_01: YouTube is a marketplace of creators and viewers as well.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_01: So what do you think about marketplaces?
[00:17:28] Well, I would say it comes down to scale.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: Like you've got Airbnb on the side there.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_00: I think small marketplaces are really hard.
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_00: We own some.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_00: And I think it's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_00: If you can get supply and demand to match
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_00: their phenomenal businesses, but they're highly competitive,
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: I like a business where it becomes a verb.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_00: So Airbnb is a great example.
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_00: Like if I think like, oh, maybe we should rent a house.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_00: Airbnb, the word just pops into my head.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_00: I go to the browser, I look up Airbnb
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_00: and I'm gonna use it.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_00: That I would say is probably a B or an A business.
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_00: So very, very highly ranked.
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_00: But if you started a marketplace for people
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_00: who want to borrow, let's say like construction tools
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_00: or something like that.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God, like I've just seen a million of these fail.
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: They're so difficult.
[00:18:21] And so where you rank at marketplaces?
[00:18:23] I would say a good marketplace like Airbnb at say an A.
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_00: I'd rank marketplace in general as a C.
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_00: Wow, first big controversial pick there.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_01: I can't believe you rank it as a C.
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: That's the one I would disagree with you with.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_01: I think if you get a marketplace to work
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_01: like an Airbnb, it's S tier.
[00:18:39] Well, are we saying I'm working marketplace
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_00: because we're talking about business model.
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_00: If you're one of the very few successful marketplaces,
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_01: you're an S.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_01: It's like one of the most defensible lucrative businesses
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_01: in the world.
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_01: But because the likelihood of success is so low,
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_01: I would have just knocked it down to probably an A.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_01: If you can actually get one going even.
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_01: Let's put Airbnb as an A.
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_00: I'm dealing with that.
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: This Airbnb.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_00: I just can't agree with the business model in general
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_00: as being a C.
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_00: Because we're basically ranking in terms of quality
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_00: and difficulty, right?
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_00: And I just think like, for example,
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_00: we could say that the service is business,
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_00: the accounting firm, let's say PWC, right?
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_00: PWC 75 years ago was just one accountant
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_00: and with a few partners.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_00: And now today, if you want to get audited,
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_00: you're a public company, you have basically five options.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: You're going to pay a fortune for their rubber stamp, right?
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_00: So I'd say like, we could rank that as a B or an A,
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_00: but we're talking about the business model.
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_00: Okay, fair enough.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_01: Agreed to disagree on that one.
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_01: All right, this Airbnb is not the company Airbnb.
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_01: It's owning Airbnb, short-term rentals.
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_01: So saying, oh, you know what?
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_01: Here's how I'm going to make money.
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to get a property, I'm going to get a home.
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to put it on Airbnb.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_01: I'll be a short-term rental unit owner.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_01: Maybe I'll do two, maybe I'll do three.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_01: What do you think of that plan?
[00:19:59] I'd say it's a D, similar to freelance.
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: You know, the risk there, regulatory.
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_00: I owned a, so I bought a beautiful apartment in Vancouver.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_00: I go to Vancouver a lot and I said,
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_00: oh, I don't want to own a second home,
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_00: but the 28 days a month, I don't use this place.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_00: I'll Airbnb it.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_00: So I Airbnb it, I'm making a fortune, it's great.
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_00: I love it.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_00: All the sudden, city of Vancouver changes the regulations.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: Boom, there goes my margin, there goes my business,
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_00: you know, total nightmare.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_00: And now it's fine, I have a tenant,
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_00: but it's just not nowhere near as profitable.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_01: The same thing happened to my parents.
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_01: They were airboring their house in San Francisco,
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_01: making a killing and then San Francisco changes rules.
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_01: So you can only Airbnb 90 days out of the year.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_01: So basically three out of the 12 months,
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_01: you can Airbnb.
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_01: So then nine out of the 12 months,
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_01: their cash cow disappeared overnight.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_01: That is the unfortunate one there.
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_01: All right, I want to do content creators.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_01: So for the person who says, I want to create the next podcast,
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_01: I want to be the next YouTuber, I want to be an Instagrammer.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to build a following
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_01: and then I'm going to make a ton of money
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_01: because I'm going to get brand deals
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_01: or launch bound products or who knows what.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_01: But I'm going to go all in, I'm being a content creator.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_01: So I think that's probably a D.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: I would argue that if you become the next Andrew Huvernman,
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: you're an A, like you're a B,
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: you think about it in a world of AI.
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_00: If somebody has a trusted relationship with you,
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_00: it's a phenomenal business.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: The issue with it is it just doesn't scale.
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_00: So in terms of defensibility,
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_00: it's amazing, highly profitable, very simple to operate.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_00: But one of the problems with it is,
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_00: and I know a lot of these people,
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_00: if you don't show up and you don't bring the fire
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_00: on the camera every single day
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_00: and you stop posting, your business goes to zero.
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's a bit of a,
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_00: it's a bit of a prison, I think for some people.
[00:21:51] Why did you say Huvernman?
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_01: Is it because of the trust factor
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_01: or because it's in health or wellness or medical?
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_01: Is that the important factor there?
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_01: The niche or is it just the level of trust that people have?
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_01: It's if Huvernman was doing the same sort of podcast,
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_00: but he was doing it about candy.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_00: He's reviewing candy.
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_00: And if you sell candy,
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_00: it's the affiliate margins are not that good.
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: The candy company won't pay that much to do it.
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_00: If you're doing health,
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_00: like if you think about Huvernman
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_00: is basically promoting athletic greens,
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_00: health supplements, that kind of stuff,
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_00: those things can be very, very profitable
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_00: and the customer lifetime value is high.
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: And so he can charge a hell of a lot for advertising.
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_00: And then also, I mean, if you think about it,
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_00: like Huvernman, we own,
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_00: we're friends with Andrew,
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_00: we own a Yerba Mate business with him.
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_00: He is able to basically bring,
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_00: I would call it $20 million of free marketing
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_00: to any business he becomes a part of.
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_00: And so if he takes equity in businesses or owns businesses,
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_00: he grows them massively.
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we took the Yerba Mate business.
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_00: I think it's grown 300, 400% since he got involved with us.
[00:23:04] All right, next one, owning real estate.
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_01: So buying properties, either cash flowing them
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_01: or flipping them.
[00:23:12] Obviously, this is a big space, right?
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_01: So there's like a thousand variations of how you do this.
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_01: So I think it's a little bit of a tough one,
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_01: but just give me your general thoughts on going into real estate
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_01: as whether it's multi-family,
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_01: it's commercial real estate and saying,
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to try to buy these properties,
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_01: using some debt.
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_01: Maybe I'm just gonna cash flow these properties,
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_01: or maybe I'm gonna try to improve them and sell them
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_01: for a higher cap rate when I exit.
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_00: The beauty of real estate is predictability.
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_00: I think, depending on this sort of real estate,
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_00: I think there's really a big distinction
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_00: between real estate ownership,
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_00: where you just buy something and you rent it out.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_00: And then there's real estate development,
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_00: where you actually buy a piece of land
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: or you buy something and you add value.
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_00: I remember talking to you,
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: I think it's your brother-in-law
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_00: who does the real estate,
[00:23:57] SPEAKER_00: where he was like, look,
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_00: like I know all of the people that need space,
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_00: and I just go and I acquire a strip mall.
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_00: And before I close, I already know
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_00: that I'm gonna put someone new in,
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_00: and it's gonna be a way higher quality asset,
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_00: and then you can refinance it out or whatever.
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_00: To me, that's kind of a no-brainer way to make money.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_00: So I would rate that as C, probably.
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_00: All right, go ahead and see.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_01: And why is that not higher?
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_01: Because, well, if you're not doing the value add
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_01: or you don't have that unfair advantage,
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_01: like my brother-in-law has,
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_01: the reason I don't really do much real estate is because,
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_00: I don't like anything with a ceiling.
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_00: You know, if you buy, let's say you buy a 40-10
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_00: apartment building or something like that,
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_00: the rent is gonna be, let's say,
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_00: let's say the, some old lady owns it,
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_00: she hasn't increased the rent in, you know,
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_00: 30 years or something like that.
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_00: You're gonna buy the building over time,
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_00: you can get an increased yield by increasing the rent,
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_00: but there's a ceiling on that rent,
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_00: and you can't innovate to make more money.
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_00: Whereas in a business, let's say a digital business
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_00: like a web design agency or software company,
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: you can take your profits,
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_00: and you can actually grow the business
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_00: and you can increase revenue.
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_00: It's very difficult to do that in real estate
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_00: without massive catbacks.
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think, well, I think they do the same thing, right?
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_01: They just go buy a second, they take the profits
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_01: or they refinance, they go buy a second property.
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_01: What's wrong with that? That works.
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, you can do it.
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, it's just not something I've spent
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_00: a lot of energy on.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's, when someone tells me
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_00: that they're gonna go do it, I think,
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_00: of all the things they could do,
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_00: that's a pretty solid approach.
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_00: And I think one of the things I've noticed,
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_00: I know a lot of really wealthy real estate people
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_00: and I've been fascinated by how illiquid it is.
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_00: So you'll meet people who have $2 billion of real estate,
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_00: but the actual profits that come out of it
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_00: are like $20 million a year, which is amazing, right?
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_00: It's made their family wealthy.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_00: The bank understands that they live a good life,
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_00: but they don't actually have that much liquidity,
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_00: and it's often tied up in the next project
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_00: and the next project and the next project.
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_00: So I think it's a great way to make your kids
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_00: really, really wealthy and ruin a few generations
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_00: and then they'll buy an F1 team
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: and then lose all their money.
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_00: All right, we have nothing in the S here yet.
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_01: So I gotta try to get there.
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_01: I think this is the guy to do it.
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_01: So I have an icon here of Warren Buffett
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_01: and this represents investing.
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_01: So just being an investor generically,
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_01: but I think maybe the way I was really thinking about this,
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_01: because I think Buffett is a little unusual
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_01: in the way that he's structured his company.
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_01: So really this is to me owning an investment fund
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_01: or being in the money management business,
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_01: investing other people's money and taking fees
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_01: and a profit off the top of it.
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_01: Is that?
[00:26:45] Well, no, I would argue a little bit differently.
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_00: I'd say investment management is an incredible business,
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_00: but I wouldn't put Buffett in that category
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_00: because he doesn't actually manage other people's money.
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know, that's what I think about it.
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_00: He's sort of the exception here.
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_00: So the distinction I would make,
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: let's say your hedge fund manager,
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_00: like my friend Bill Ackman,
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_00: so Bill, for example, he went out,
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_00: he raised hundreds of millions of dollars,
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_00: he bought a bunch of stocks,
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_00: he would go and advocate for these companies to improve,
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_00: and then he would take fees on that.
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_00: And if you think about that business model,
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_00: you actually don't need to really put
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: that much money into it yourself
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: and you can make a profound amount of money if you perform.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_00: The structure of hedge funds
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: is typically 2% of managed assets,
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_00: plus 20% of the profits.
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_00: So let's say that you raise $100 million
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_00: and you triple it in a short period of time,
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_00: you can suddenly make $30, $40, $50 million of carry
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_00: and fees and stuff.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_00: So those are really tremendous businesses, in my opinion.
[00:27:49] SPEAKER_00: The problem with them is that your investors
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_00: can pull their cash out.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_00: And so what Bill has done that's so smart,
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_00: and I would rank Bill as S and Buffett as S,
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_00: and then other asset managers lower,
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_00: they have permanent capital.
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_00: That's the real distinction.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_00: And that means their investors can't pull their money out.
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_00: They're gonna make those fees no matter what.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_00: And they can literally, I mean,
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_00: if you think about, sorry, why is it permanent capital?
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_01: I can sell my Berkshire stock today,
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_01: I can sell my Pershing Square today.
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_01: What do you mean it's permanent?
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_01: What's permanent about that part?
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_01: Is that, or are you not talking about that?
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_01: These are some other money.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_00: You're just trading little stock certificates
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_00: of ownership between the businesses.
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_00: But what I mean is, typically a hedge fund manager would say,
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_00: let's say I give a hedge fund manager a million dollars,
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_00: I can withdraw that capital.
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_00: And the only way that they can give me that money back
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_00: is by selling stock.
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_00: So let's say that you, let's say you're the hedge fund manager,
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_00: you go out, you invest in some company,
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_00: the stock goes down, I lose faith, I say,
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_00: Sean, I want my money back,
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_00: you have to go sell part of your stake,
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: potentially losing quite a bit of money.
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_00: Whereas someone like Buffett or Ackman,
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_00: people are just trading the stock certificates, right?
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_00: Those are just ownership shares.
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_01: Even when I'm out, whoever I sold it to, they're in.
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_01: So the money is essentially there,
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_01: even if the stock price goes down.
[00:29:09] Exactly.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_00: And if you think about it, just in terms of the beauty
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_00: of their business model, Buffett's is more complex.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_00: So Bill's business, for example,
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_00: he simply just goes out and he buys 10 stocks.
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_00: And he has 50 employees and he makes hundreds
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_00: and hundreds of millions.
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes some years, I think he makes billions.
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_00: Well, so Bill Ackman's firm only has 50 employees.
[00:29:32] Yes.
[00:29:32] 50 employees, I think he manages,
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_01: how much does Bill Ackman manage?
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_01: So Bill?
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_01: 16 to 20 billion somewhere in there.
[00:29:39] So, okay, let's call it 15 billion.
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_01: So he's got 15 billion under management.
[00:29:46] You know what, we got to break the rule
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_01: and we got to do a little public math here.
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_01: Oh no.
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_01: He takes a 2% fee or he doesn't take the fee.
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_01: He takes a fee on, I think he,
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_00: it's a blended fee of between 1 and 2%
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_00: depending on the pool of capital.
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_00: It's called a million, 1.5%.
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_01: So let's take a, say he's taking 1% higher.
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_01: So his firm with 50 employees,
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_01: whose job is to go and analyze and find 10 stocks to own
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_01: is making 200 million plus a year in cash flow
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_01: off of just the fees.
[00:30:15] Well, you got to remember, so this revenue cost,
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_00: there's costs to it, transaction legal,
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_00: all the other stuff.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_00: And again, I think that number swings around
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_00: based on the performance and stuff as well.
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_00: But how high could that cost be?
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_01: He's got 50 employees and his legal,
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_01: he's not doing M&A with private companies.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_01: He's doing public company investing.
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_01: I believe, I mean, we don't need to do the public math.
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_00: People can look it up.
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_00: But if you look at Pershing Square Holdings,
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_00: his public company, you can basically see
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_00: what they pay him and fees every year.
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_00: Okay, that's incredible.
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_00: So that, and let's not forget, that's no matter what.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_00: That's not the reward.
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_00: That's not the 20% reward.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_00: I remember, I remember talking to him in 2020,
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_00: he was freaking out about COVID
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_00: and he had put $25 million into a derivatives position
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_00: betting, kind of buying fire insurance against COVID
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_00: dropping the market.
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_00: He made $2.4 billion of profit
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_00: or something insane off of that.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_00: I think it was $25 million bet.
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_00: And you think about, he got fees on all that.
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_00: Like it's unbelievable.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_00: And he also owns, let's not forget,
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_00: he owns like $6 billion of that capital he manages.
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_00: So that's his money.
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_00: Okay, that's incredible.
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_01: What about the other side of it,
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_01: where you talked about the hedge fund managers.
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_01: So where are we putting them?
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_01: So if Buffett and Akban are your first S tier,
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_01: where are you putting the general hedge fund manager,
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_01: money manager, who's got assets under management,
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_01: but not permanent capital the way you do.
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_01: I'd give it a, I'd give it a B,
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: just because of the nature of the swings.
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_00: And you can, you're pretty much guaranteed as a,
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_00: let's say you're a very,
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_00: you have a large venture capital fund
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_00: or you have a large hedge fund.
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_00: You're pretty much guaranteed over 10 or 15 years
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_00: to make, to become a Deca millionaire,
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_00: almost no matter what,
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_00: which is kind of a crazy thing about the model.
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_00: But you might get blown up at some point.
[00:32:06] But explain the inconsistency,
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_01: because I believe Akban also has like blown up
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_01: or almost got blown up,
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_01: you know, a couple of times.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_01: What's the difference in your mind
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_01: between what you're talking about?
[00:32:19] Bill keeps getting shot
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_00: and then miraculously getting back up.
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_00: And I think one of the investment world,
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_00: he has a great line.
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_00: He just says the secret to success in business
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_00: is just getting back up over and over and over again.
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_00: And what happened to him was,
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_00: Bill has made so many incredible investments.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_00: But I believe in 2014,
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_00: he bet against Urbalife, which was an MLM.
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_00: And then he also bet on valiant pharmaceuticals,
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_00: which was a pharmaceuticals company
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_00: that was basically increasing prices.
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_00: It was a very elegant and, you know,
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_00: very, very smart model,
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_00: but it was run in a kind of unethical way
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_00: and the company blew up.
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_00: So between Urbalife and valiant pharmaceutical,
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_00: his investors lost faith in him
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_00: and a lot of them pulled their cash.
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_00: And so suddenly his whole hedge fund is blowing up.
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_00: And fortunately, in 2012 or 2013,
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_00: Bill had raised, I believe it was like $4 million,
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_00: or $4 billion of permanent capital
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_00: in Pershing Square Holdings.
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_00: And Bill was able to basically bet on himself.
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_00: He went to JP Morgan, he went to Jamie Diamond,
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_00: who he's buddies with,
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_00: and he got a $500 million or something loan
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_00: to bet on himself and buy more stock.
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_00: And he managed to come out the other end,
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_00: absolutely killing it.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_00: And I think the big lesson for him was,
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: don't short stocks, because he was shorting stocks,
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_00: and be a lot more disciplined
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_00: about investing in businesses with leverage
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_00: or exogenous risks.
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_00: I think there's this funny story, Bill,
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_00: went out and he bought these little plaques
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_00: and he puts them on every single person's desk
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_00: at Pershing Square.
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_00: And it's the 10 commandments.
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_00: It's like thou shalt not short stocks.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_00: Thou shalt not invest in a business with too much debt, et cetera.
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: So Bill has really learned the lesson and been through it.
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_00: Do you know how in venture capital,
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_01: the normal VC fund isn't going to,
[00:34:20] it's basically like a pretty poor performing asset class,
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: because you're in liquid for 10 years,
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_01: and then this sort of, you know,
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_01: the IRR that you get out of it is less than
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: if you just kept it in an index fund.
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_01: So like venture capital on the whole
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_01: is a pretty bad asset class.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_01: Of course, the top funds perform pretty well.
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_01: Is basically a hedge fund management
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_01: the same distribution,
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_01: or do they on average do better?
[00:34:42] So, weren't, there's this great story.
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_00: There's this guy Ted Sides,
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_00: who's a, he's a fund manager, a fund of fund manager,
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_00: and he had lunch with Buffett,
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_00: and he said, Warren, I'll bet you,
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_00: I think it was a million dollars,
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_00: that I can choose a basket of hedge funds,
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_00: and they'll outperform the S&P.
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_00: And I believe he lost that bet to Buffett.
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_00: Buffett basically said,
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_00: on average, funds do not outperform,
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_00: which is very true.
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_00: I mean, most hedge funds,
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_00: most venture capital do not perform,
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_00: and I think that's kind of what's distinct
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_00: about private equity.
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_00: I think I don't know for sure,
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_00: but I think most private equity funds
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_00: at least have a reasonable return.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_00: All right, we got a couple more I want to do.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_01: Local services.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_01: So you're starting a local pest control business, HVAC,
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_01: you know, things that are,
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_01: I got the handyman icon here,
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_01: because it is something that you do with,
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_01: you know, a guy wearing boots and overalls,
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_01: that comes and does something in your local area.
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_01: So I would say that's a C.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_00: Those are hard businesses,
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_00: but if you can dominate a local industry,
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_00: let's say like,
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_00: let's say like you really get an internet marketing,
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_00: and you own an HVAC business,
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: and you're able to hire great technicians.
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_00: There's only so many technicians out there,
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_00: and so they're kind of fundamentally difficult
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_00: to compete with.
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_00: And I think they're challenging.
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_00: I know a lot of people over the last few years
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_00: who have bought HVAC businesses or plumbing companies,
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_00: and they're like, you know,
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_00: guys that look like you and me,
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_00: and they come in and they're dealing
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_00: with all these blue collar guys,
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_00: and they're like, who the fuck are you?
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_00: Why would I come and work with you?
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_00: And so I think they're good businesses.
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_00: If you're, like let's say you're a very enterprising
[00:36:25] SPEAKER_00: HVAC technician,
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_00: and you want to start one of these businesses,
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_00: you can do phenomenally well,
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_00: but I think they're actually quite difficult
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_00: to operate for a outsider.
[00:36:34] All right, I got a couple more.
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_01: Venture Capital slash angel investing,
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: although they're a little bit different.
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_01: One's investing,
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_01: other people's money,
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_01: one's investing your own.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_01: I know that bucketed them together here.
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_01: I would pay angel investing as an E.
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_00: I think I view angel investing
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_00: a little bit like playing roulette.
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_00: I like to play poker.
[00:36:52] SPEAKER_00: It has better odds.
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_00: I look at private equity or buying businesses
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_00: more like poker.
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_00: And I just know,
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_00: I think the classic entrepreneur story that,
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_00: you guys have talked about a million times is,
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_00: you make some money as a founder,
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_00: you want to pay it forward.
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: You don't really get stocks in real estate and businesses
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_00: or acquiring other businesses.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_00: Or they seem like,
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: or they seem a little too boring, a little too common.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_01: And you hear Jason Calcannis,
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_00: I'm the first investor in Uber and whatever.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_00: And so you want to do that same thing.
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_00: And it's a little bit like,
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_00: you've ever been pitched by a founder
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_00: and they have like a popsicle company.
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_00: And they say like,
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_00: well, I know we're like tiny right now,
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_00: but there's this one company
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_00: that sold to Procter and Gamble for 300 million.
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_00: It's just, it's all story driven.
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_00: And don't get me wrong.
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_00: There's amazing angel investors like Lockheed Grume
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_00: and people that do amazing stuff.
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_00: But I think for layman,
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_00: it's a terrible, terrible thing to do with your money.
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it does feel a little bit like golf.
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_01: It's an expensive hobby.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_01: But if you enjoy it, fantastic.
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_01: Give me a more part.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_01: I mean, we talked about this.
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_00: I think on the last episode or two episodes,
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_00: when I first started out,
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_00: I got in the habit of angel investing.
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_00: I have $30 million or something tied up
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_00: in angel investment completely illiquid.
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_00: I have no access to it.
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_00: I'd much rather own stocks and real estate or something.
[00:38:08] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:38:10] All right.
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_01: I have one more here that's a biolocal sweaty startup.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_01: Oh, we have Cody Sanchez entering the chat here.
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_01: I couldn't find a good icon.
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_01: So I could just put Cody on here for lack of a better term.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_01: She's, it's a picture of Cody at a longer bat.
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_01: And I think she's, I don't know,
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_01: I don't actually know, by the way,
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_01: if Cody really pushes that you should buy laundromats,
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_01: but I think that's a little bit of a narrative.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_01: I'll use her as a figurehead for this idea
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_01: that you should find a local sort of brick and mortar,
[00:38:36] SPEAKER_01: a sweaty business, you know, go buy a boring main street
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_01: business and you're gonna cash flow
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_01: the new reinvest the cash flow,
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_01: you buy the second laundromat,
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_01: then you buy car wash and you keep going in that direction.
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_01: Where does Andrew Wilkinson rank that model on the tier list?
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I love Cody and I love Nick.
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_00: Nick Huber, I think what they're advocating is basically,
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_00: look, don't go and work for someone else
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_00: when you can create your own job.
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_00: And I think if you can be an owner operator,
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_00: but they don't say that.
[00:39:06] I think if they said that,
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_01: it would be a lot more of an honest broker, right?
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_01: The way you, you said one key word,
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_01: which is what they say is, own your own business
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_01: and you said, own your own job.
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_01: And I think there's a big difference
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_01: between those two things.
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: Well, I think that's a fundamental question.
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_00: Are you buying your own job or are you buying a business?
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: If the business returns more than the cost of the owner's salary,
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_00: then I'd say that's great.
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_00: I'd say that's a C.
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_00: Chris and I always say like,
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_00: if you can skip the line and instead of working your way up
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_00: and starting businesses,
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_00: you can just buy a already working business
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_00: and just improve it.
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_00: I think that's phenomenal.
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's really a lot of what we've done.
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: So my story, I started the web design agency, Metal Lab,
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_00: that business grew.
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_00: I then took almost all my profits
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_00: and I started like 10 other businesses
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_00: and almost all of them failed.
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_00: It was really exhausting.
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_00: And at the end of that process,
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_00: I had one business that I could sell,
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_00: another one that was kind of alive.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_00: But I started 10 and I'd put almost 10 million
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_00: or 15 million dollars in all these terrible businesses.
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_00: If I had just taken the a million, two million a year
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_00: and just bought businesses and just improved them,
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_00: I think I'd be much farther ahead than I am today.
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_00: Well, that's what you eventually started doing, right?
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_01: What you did at some point was you guys decided
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_01: to switch into buying businesses that are already working
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_01: as your main business to be in.
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_01: And I believe you guys invested,
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_01: you can crack it for a moment.
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_01: I think the initials kind of seed capital was,
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_01: you took something like five or six million bucks
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_01: from Metal Lab profits and you were like,
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_01: this will be the base and then we'll try to find
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_01: these sort of compounding businesses
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_01: that we can hold for a long time.
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_01: What you guys call wonderful businesses, great.
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_01: And that's what has become tiny,
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_01: the public company today, I think the market
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_01: has something like 200 something million dollars.
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, basically we just started buying businesses in 2013
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_00: when we read about Warren Buffett
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_00: and we're like, oh my God, this guy's doing easy mode.
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_00: Why are we doing hard mode?
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_00: But to be honest, Buffett has this great quote,
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_00: and I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman.
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_00: And I think that in order to be a good investor,
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_00: you need to have run or experience the chaos
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_00: behind the scenes at different businesses.
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_00: And I think the beauty of what we did was we got really lucky.
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_00: So we went to the gym, we didn't deadlift 300 pounds.
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_00: We got really lucky with Metal Lab and it worked.
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_00: So that built our confidence to go try more stuff.
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_00: Then we tried every bad business model.
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_00: You know, we did drop shipping.
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_00: We started a restaurant.
[00:41:42] SPEAKER_00: We did a skincare company, like all sorts of dumb stuff.
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_00: We always joke we put forks into electrical sockets.
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_00: We learned a lot and then we started investing.
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_00: And so what we could do is we could look at these businesses
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_00: and say, oh wow, this is actually a really high quality business.
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_00: And I know that because I've operated a similar one.
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_00: And do you remember how much capital you started doing that
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_01: with once you stopped starting new businesses,
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_01: you decided to go start buying?
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_01: I think it was like four or five million bucks.
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_00: We basically sat down and said, okay,
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_00: we're going to start this thing called tiny.
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to own 80%.
[00:42:18] SPEAKER_00: You're going to own 20%.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_00: That was only because I had more capital
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_00: because I was the one who owned most of Metal Lab.
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_00: And Chris put in 500K or a million bucks
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_00: and I put in the rest and that's it.
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_00: We never put any more money in.
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_00: So that's because I asked you, was that just a seed?
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_01: I did every year.
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_01: Oh, we found a new business.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_01: Let's take more Metal Lab profits and put it into tiny or no.
[00:42:41] No, nothing.
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we merged.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_00: So it was interesting.
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_00: So I actually own Metal Lab myself.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_00: I own 90% of Metal Lab and then my brother and Chris
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_00: and a few other people were small shareholders in it.
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_00: And so that's what basically I diversified with.
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_00: So I went off and in my family office
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_00: did all the venture investing and bought some real estate
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_00: and bought newspapers and restaurants and other dumb stuff.
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_00: But tiny itself really just grew from that original amount.
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_00: So that's pretty incredible.
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_01: I feel like I got to ask you this
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_01: because I think you get a lot of shit nowadays.
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_01: I think a lot of people go look at the tiny stock.
[00:43:22] SPEAKER_01: And basically you see, I think you guys went,
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_01: you like did this reverse merger
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_01: and so then the stock basically like shoots up in 2021
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_01: at the kind of like peak era at that time.
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_01: And then basically it's just a downward trend since then.
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of people I see on Twitter
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_01: want to kind of look at that and say,
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_01: oh, this guy calls himself the Warren Buffett of the internet
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_01: and he says he buys his great businesses,
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: but what's going on?
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_01: Look at your stock.
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_01: And so they see that and they say,
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_01: man, is this guy like many other people on the internet
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_01: who maybe either overstate their claims
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_01: or whatever, right?
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_01: That's a common problem on the internet, I would say,
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_01: just on the whole is that you don't know who's real,
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_01: you don't know who's actually good.
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_01: And so you have this public company
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_01: that's a little bit of a public scoreboard in a way
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_01: and people get really riled up about that.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_01: On the other hand, and this is kind of like,
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_01: the two parts of the trial, right?
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_01: You have the prosecution, the defense in a way.
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_01: The other hand, you say, look, there's a guy who took
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_01: four, five million, you know,
[00:44:21] SPEAKER_01: first created this design agency that was really successful
[00:44:23] SPEAKER_01: as a business, has generated,
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_01: you said over $100 million of profit lifetime.
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_01: And then you took four, five million bucks
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_01: and you compounded that into a 200
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_01: between $200, $300 million business
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_01: that holds all these interesting assets
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_01: and cool, like the stock prices go up and down.
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_01: That's not necessarily, and they'll be all.
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_01: And even if you said, look, that's how big it was,
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_01: it's still fantastic.
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_01: I don't know a lot of people who are listening to this
[00:44:48] SPEAKER_01: that have done anything that's more impressive than that.
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_01: So I admire, even if that, even if your worst case,
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_01: least generous interpretation is today's current stock price,
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_01: that's still pretty damn impressive.
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_01: So I guess like, what's your reaction to this?
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: Here's your sitting there.
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_01: You don't wanna go out there and fight all the internet
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_01: trolls or anything like that.
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_01: But how do you see this?
[00:45:08] SPEAKER_01: What's your take on this?
[00:45:10] It's pretty funny, because we started in 2006,
[00:45:14] SPEAKER_00: basically 20 years ago,
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_00: bootstrapped this business until 2023, when we went public.
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_00: And over the last 10 years,
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_00: I think since we started tiny,
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_00: we've compounded it 25, our earnings at 25%.
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_00: We do almost $250 million of revenue.
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_00: We have 65 million of ARR.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_00: We do over $40 million of EBITDA,
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_00: and Chris and I still own the majority of the public company.
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_00: And all these are all things,
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_00: you can look at the public filings and see.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_00: If you also, we talked about asset management.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we also,
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_00: or we manage a $200 million fund managed by the public company
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_00: with $40 million of it, our own capital,
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_00: and that owns Arrowpress, Letterbox,
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_00: all sorts of other businesses.
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_00: If we include that, that adds another $65 million of revenue.
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_00: So we're over 300 million in revenue across 30 businesses,
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_00: and all the businesses in the fund are profitable as well.
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I'm kinda like, if that's failing,
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_00: like sign me up, right?
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know what to say to the trolls.
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, don't feed the trolls.
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: Let's take the vulnerable side a little bit, right?
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_01: Because I always ask myself this whenever I get criticized.
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_01: And my first reaction is like,
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_01: what the hell are you guys talking about?
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_01: Like, do you not see, do you not see that?
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_01: I wanna like kinda defend myself,
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_01: but at the same time, I always ask myself this,
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_01: just for my own learning, which is basically like,
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_01: what about this is fair?
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_01: But what is the fair criticism?
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's always been an important question for me,
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_01: keeps me honest, because you know,
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_01: look, either I'm just gonna ignore it,
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_01: I got nothing from it.
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna get mad about it and think they're stupid.
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_01: I get nothing out of it.
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_01: Or I mostly disregard what I think is the sort of like,
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_01: off base line of thinking, but maybe there's,
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_01: you know, some things, some part of it that's fair.
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_01: Oh, it is fair that I said this.
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_01: It is fair that I didn't, I didn't do this.
[00:47:09] SPEAKER_01: Or it is fair that I thought it would be X
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_01: and actually turned out to be Y.
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_01: You know, those are some things that are fair, right?
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_01: So what would you say is fair criticism about you?
[00:47:17] First of all, I just wanna say,
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_00: I really empathize with people.
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_00: I remember watching like Shark Tank.
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_00: And I'd be like, oh wow, Kevin O'Leary,
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_00: you know, he sold his business for billions of dollars.
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_00: And then you go read the juicy gossip that,
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_00: you know, he got $10 million or whatever,
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_00: or that deal.
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_00: And I think it's very easy to kind of have the one blurb
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_00: and then judge someone.
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_00: And I think before I went through this experience,
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_00: I would just believe what I read on the internet
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_00: and, you know, kind of enjoy it to be honest.
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_00: Like I think there's this dirty, horrible part of humanity,
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_00: myself included that loves when somebody
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_00: who's on an upswing falls.
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_00: Like talk about Bill Aclin.
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_00: Like Bill, Bill's an amazing investor, but he's loud, right?
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_00: And I'm loud too, I'm extroverted.
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_00: I like talking what I'm doing.
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_00: I like talking about our companies and everything.
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_00: And it's really, really fun to watch someone loud
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_00: like me fall in the mud, right?
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_00: And I see this in myself, you know,
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_00: you kind of cheer and enjoy it.
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_00: Like celebrities go through this too,
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_00: where it's like they're awesome and everyone loves them.
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_00: And then all of a sudden, you know,
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_00: they like to shit on them for a few years.
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_00: And then they love them again, like Justin Bieber,
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_00: everyone hated him for the last five years.
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_00: Now everyone loves them again.
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_00: I just kind of think that's the course of things.
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_00: And I think it's kind of, I just got to eat humble pie.
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_00: And there's a lot of great things I get out of
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_00: being loud on the internet and talking about this stuff.
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_00: I've connected with so many incredible entrepreneurs.
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_00: I've made so many new friends.
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_00: You know, I love talking about this stuff
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_00: and teaching people about business and stuff.
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_00: But this is the price.
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_00: And I'm willing to pay the price and it sucks.
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_00: And for me, it's a button, right?
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_00: Like when I was a kid, I was always, I've ADHD
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_00: and like I'd always fuck up.
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_00: And I'd always be the one in our family
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_00: that was blamed for everything.
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_00: And so being misunderstood is a big button.
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_00: And I really have to resist getting on the horn
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_00: and trying to argue with everyone
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_00: because it really doesn't help.
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_00: So I think for me, we're just focused
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_00: on delivering good results and building great businesses
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_00: which we're continuing to do.
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_00: And people on the internet are going to twist it.
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_00: However they want to, the reality is 60% of the businesses
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_00: that went public in 2023 when we did
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: are still under their IPO price.
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_00: So Asana, Sweet Green, Coupang, like all these other businesses,
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_00: they're all under IPO.
[00:49:41] SPEAKER_00: Does that instantly mean that what the founder
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_00: has built is invalidated in their moron?
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_00: And I think the fear, the really fear criticism, though,
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_00: of us is our business is a bit confusing, right?
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_00: Even our stock chart, like starting businesses.
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_00: So I made all this money from the web design business,
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_00: started a bunch of companies.
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_00: One of those companies became the dominant seller
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_00: of themes in the Shopify ecosystem.
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_00: And Chris and I always had it in our head
[00:50:10] SPEAKER_00: where we're like, let's take a business public.
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_00: We'd love to do that.
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_00: And so we actually went and we partnered with Bill Ackman.
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_00: We had sold the business to a family office.
[00:50:21] SPEAKER_00: We bought it back and we took that business public.
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_00: And we took a public in January 2021.
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_00: Do you remember what was happening in January 2021?
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_00: Every stock was going to the moon.
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_00: And so you have this business that's doing 40 million
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_00: or something in revenue and like 7 million of EBITDA.
[00:50:39] SPEAKER_00: And it goes to literally the day we took a public,
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_00: it jumps from a $250 million market cap to 1.2 billion.
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_00: And so we didn't take a public at 1.2 billion,
[00:50:50] SPEAKER_00: but that first day, that's where the chart starts, right?
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_00: And then the mania is over and the chart starts going down.
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_00: And as the chart started going down,
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_00: we ended up deciding, hey, let's take tiny public.
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_00: So we merge into it.
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_00: So really like the tiny story is this, right?
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_00: We've been compounding at 25% from almost nothing.
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_00: And what people see, unfortunately,
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_00: because that's what's in the public market,
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_00: is this little dip down here.
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_00: And to be honest, I get it.
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_00: I think it's like you really have to take the time
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_00: to understand the business and the story
[00:51:25] SPEAKER_00: and why it looks like that.
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_00: But I'd encourage people to do their research
[00:51:29] SPEAKER_00: and actually dig in and understand what we own.
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_00: Because from my perspective, I think we own
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_00: a lot of pretty incredible businesses.
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_00: And you still own the majority of the business?
[00:51:40] I do.
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_01: And is that still the majority of your net worth basically?
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_01: So you're just like skinned.
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_01: And how much skin do you still have in the game?
[00:51:48] Yeah, this is what's so funny is, like people,
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I've even, people have said,
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_00: oh, you did a pump and dump.
[00:51:53] SPEAKER_00: And I'm going like, what are you talking about?
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_00: Like I've sold almost no stock.
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_00: And the only stock I did one large transfer,
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_00: I think of $8 million, I moved it to my foundation.
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_00: So I could start doing philanthropy, right?
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_00: Like, right.
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_00: I haven't taken any cash out.
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_00: I still own all the stock.
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_00: And people say, oh, you're a pump and dump or something.
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, it's just kind of sad.
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_01: And so you hear all this.
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_01: And you've also talked about this idea of the courage
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_01: to be disliked.
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_01: I think that was the right book at the right time
[00:52:27] SPEAKER_01: for you during this period.
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_01: I haven't actually read the book.
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_01: It's a killer title.
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_01: What is the thing that I can learn from that book?
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_00: So Sam just did that great.
[00:52:36] SPEAKER_00: I love that episode he did where he basically said,
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_00: here's the recipe to a miserable life and let's invert.
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_00: And one of my favorite inversions
[00:52:45] SPEAKER_00: is that you actually want people to hate you.
[00:52:48] SPEAKER_00: You do not want to be liked by everybody.
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a great signal that you're doing life wrong.
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_00: And I think if you told me this 10 years ago,
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_00: like, I would think that's insane.
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_00: I remember I read this Warren Buffett quote,
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_00: it takes 20 years to build a reputation
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_00: and five minutes to ruin it.
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_00: And for me, I really internalized that.
[00:53:07] SPEAKER_00: I was like, oh my god, I need to make
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_00: sure that everyone thinks positive of me
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_00: and I better protect this reputation, then.
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_01: Every founder I meet for coffee,
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_00: I have to woo them and make them like me or whatever.
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_00: And I really felt that I had to be consistent and predictable.
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_00: So for example, I buy companies and I'm a Warren Buffett
[00:53:30] SPEAKER_00: like a wannabe value investor kind of guy,
[00:53:34] SPEAKER_00: but I also really like startups.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_00: I like starting restaurants and all this other chaotic stuff.
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_00: People don't like that.
[00:53:41] SPEAKER_00: And I remember the moment like I kind of realized
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_00: what was going on.
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_00: My dad retired.
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_00: My dad was an architect and he retired
[00:53:49] SPEAKER_00: and I took him up for a beer and I said,
[00:53:51] SPEAKER_00: dad, what now?
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_00: What are you gonna do with all your time?
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_00: And he was saying he didn't really know.
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_00: And I said, well, dad, I've got money.
[00:54:00] SPEAKER_00: Why don't we team up and you can become a real estate developer?
[00:54:04] SPEAKER_00: You can build the things that you've always wanted to build.
[00:54:07] SPEAKER_00: And he goes, what do you think someone's gonna say?
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_00: If I suddenly call them up, they know me as architect David.
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_00: And all of a sudden I'm pitching them
[00:54:16] SPEAKER_00: on a real estate development.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_00: People don't like it when you leave your box and through.
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, oh my God, I know that feeling.
[00:54:24] SPEAKER_00: Like have you ever had a restaurant or a friend
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_00: who pitches you on a tech startup they're starting on a sudden
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_00: or your yoga instructor gets their real estate license,
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_00: they wanna sell your house or whatever it is?
[00:54:36] SPEAKER_00: My mental reaction, I hate this about myself.
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_00: My mental reaction is staying your lane.
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_00: I don't like it.
[00:54:42] SPEAKER_00: It makes me uncomfortable.
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_00: I don't know why.
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_00: And it's incredibly hypocritical because I'm a flip-flopper.
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_00: I love jumping around.
[00:54:49] SPEAKER_00: I'm an inch deep and a mile wide.
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_00: And so it's like, I hate in others what I hate about myself.
[00:54:55] SPEAKER_00: And I realized we're all like prison guards.
[00:55:00] SPEAKER_00: Like we all have these labels.
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_00: Like for me, it's like, I'm an investor and an entrepreneur.
[00:55:06] SPEAKER_00: But then it goes deeper.
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_00: It's like, I'm in tech, not real estate.
[00:55:10] SPEAKER_00: You know, no real estate allowed.
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_00: I'm bootstrapped.
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_00: You can't do venture.
[00:55:13] SPEAKER_00: That's weird if you do that.
[00:55:14] SPEAKER_00: I'm pro crypto or anti crypto.
[00:55:17] SPEAKER_00: And these labels kind of lock you into this identity.
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_00: And I've seen this in a lot of big public figures.
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_00: So like, do you remember when the CEO of Goldman Sachs,
[00:55:27] SPEAKER_00: David Solomon, it came out that he was like a DJ?
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_00: He loves to DJ, right?
[00:55:32] SPEAKER_00: This guy on the weekends and evenings he DJs.
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_00: And the press went crazy.
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_00: There's article in the economist about how, you know,
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_00: is Goldman Sachs suffering because he's, you know,
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_00: teaching, do you think they would have said that
[00:55:44] SPEAKER_00: if he was playing golf, right?
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_00: Or like, you know, we see like Kim Kardashian
[00:55:49] SPEAKER_00: get passionate about prison reform.
[00:55:51] SPEAKER_00: Or like, fuck you, vanity project.
[00:55:53] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:55:53] SPEAKER_00: Joni Hill starts surfing.
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_00: Let's make mean memes about him.
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_00: Michael Jordan plays baseball, you know, betrayal.
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_00: And so like, I realized like our brains
[00:56:01] SPEAKER_00: are just prediction machines.
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_00: And they got upset when things don't match.
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_00: And so for me, like, I realized like,
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_00: I don't fit cleanly in a box.
[00:56:10] SPEAKER_00: And it's, it's messy like everyone else.
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_00: And so I remember like, I was saying,
[00:56:16] SPEAKER_00: and I started like asking all my friends
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_00: about this and stuff.
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_00: And I was sitting up at my lake house
[00:56:21] SPEAKER_00: with a group of entrepreneurs.
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_00: And I talked to the, these guys and I said, look,
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_00: what would you do if no one was looking?
[00:56:27] SPEAKER_00: And one of my friends runs this massive industrial business,
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_00: like, you know, billion dollar business.
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_00: And he says, you know, my happiest moment
[00:56:37] SPEAKER_00: is behind the oven cooking for people.
[00:56:40] SPEAKER_00: And I actually would want to start a restaurant.
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_00: And I said, oh, would you want to,
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_00: you just want to own a restaurant?
[00:56:45] SPEAKER_00: And he said, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:46] SPEAKER_00: I want to be the chef of like a Michelin star restaurant.
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_00: And he said, I feel like I could never do it though
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_00: because I have so much of my ego tied up
[00:56:56] SPEAKER_00: in being a business person.
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_00: And everyone would think I would, that, you know,
[00:57:00] SPEAKER_00: I'd gone insane.
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_00: And at that moment, I was like, no, like, I wouldn't.
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_00: But when I think about it, I would definitely be gossiping
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_00: and going, oh my God, he's lost his mind, you know?
[00:57:11] SPEAKER_01: And so he's escaped the prison.
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_00: And we need to beat him with our batons.
[00:57:17] SPEAKER_00: And you see this with like legal degrees, bad marriages,
[00:57:20] SPEAKER_00: disappointing your parents, you know,
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_00: the industry you've spent 20 years in.
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_00: And the issue is like, all these promises
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_00: were made by the person you were before, you know,
[00:57:32] SPEAKER_00: not the person you are now.
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_00: And so I realized like, I'm in this quick stand.
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_00: I don't know what to do about it.
[00:57:38] SPEAKER_00: And in January, I found this book called The Courage
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_00: to Be Disliked.
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_00: And it's one of these books where you see the cover
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_00: and you just instantly kind of know.
[00:57:46] SPEAKER_00: You're like, okay, like this, I kind of get it.
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_00: And it's really interesting.
[00:57:50] SPEAKER_00: It's written in this very odd way
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_00: where it's a dialogue between like this wise old man
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_00: and a young guy.
[00:57:57] SPEAKER_00: And the core idea is just like seeking recognition
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_00: is a trap.
[00:58:02] SPEAKER_00: It's impossible to make everybody happy.
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_00: And if you try, you're gonna end up living
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_00: somebody else's life.
[00:58:07] SPEAKER_00: And so you have to be hated.
[00:58:09] SPEAKER_00: You have to have the courage to be disliked.
[00:58:11] SPEAKER_00: And reading this book, it was like someone
[00:58:13] SPEAKER_00: gave me the keys to my cell.
[00:58:15] SPEAKER_00: You know, I'm in this cell and there's no walls
[00:58:18] SPEAKER_00: on either side.
[00:58:19] SPEAKER_00: They're like, by the way, there's no walls.
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_00: You can walk out.
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_00: And so my New Year's resolution this year was,
[00:58:25] SPEAKER_00: I'm done with the likeability game.
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna have the courage to be disliked.
[00:58:29] SPEAKER_00: And I'm gonna say what's true for me.
[00:58:30] SPEAKER_00: And so you might have noticed,
[00:58:32] SPEAKER_00: like I've been writing a newsletter.
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_00: I'm talking about all sorts of stuff.
[00:58:35] SPEAKER_00: I'm talking about, you know, having ADHD
[00:58:38] SPEAKER_00: and you know, all my weird businesses or whatever.
[00:58:40] SPEAKER_00: And I'm just saying, fuck it.
[00:58:42] SPEAKER_00: If people don't get it, that's fine.
[00:58:44] SPEAKER_00: And you know, I'm gonna keep buying businesses
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_00: and doing great stuff.
[00:58:47] SPEAKER_00: And on this side, I'm gonna have a bunch of hobbies.
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_00: Mm.
[00:58:50] SPEAKER_01: You know, I liked that.
[00:58:51] SPEAKER_01: When I was in high school, I used to wear
[00:58:54] SPEAKER_01: mismatched socks.
[00:58:55] SPEAKER_01: I still wear mismatched socks,
[00:58:56] SPEAKER_01: but I would like, I would leave the house
[00:58:58] SPEAKER_01: and I would be wearing two different socks.
[00:59:00] SPEAKER_01: And to me, I didn't even think twice about it
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_01: because I don't know, I was just not even,
[00:59:04] SPEAKER_01: who cares, it's just socks.
[00:59:06] SPEAKER_01: But everybody would comment on it.
[00:59:07] SPEAKER_01: My mom would comment on it
[00:59:09] SPEAKER_01: out the way out the house.
[00:59:10] SPEAKER_01: What are you doing?
[00:59:11] SPEAKER_01: She was like, horrified.
[00:59:12] SPEAKER_01: Like, I can't believe you're doing this.
[00:59:13] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, what do you mean?
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_01: It's just, they're both socks.
[00:59:16] SPEAKER_01: It does, yeah, the pattern doesn't match.
[00:59:17] SPEAKER_01: Okay, who gives a shit?
[00:59:19] SPEAKER_01: And at school, people would make fun of me for it.
[00:59:22] SPEAKER_01: But they sort of realized like,
[00:59:24] SPEAKER_01: oh, we made fun of them and he just continued doing it.
[00:59:26] SPEAKER_01: But also, I wasn't even doing it really as like some statement.
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: I just didn't care.
[00:59:29] SPEAKER_01: I just decided not to care about socks the same way
[00:59:32] SPEAKER_01: everybody else did.
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_01: And I decided that the idea of matching socks
[00:59:35] SPEAKER_01: really didn't matter to me
[00:59:36] SPEAKER_01: and maybe a matter of so other people more power to you.
[00:59:39] SPEAKER_01: But it just didn't matter to me.
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_01: And I don't think I realized at the time
[00:59:45] SPEAKER_01: how important of a like many lesson
[00:59:47] SPEAKER_01: or trait that would be in the future.
[00:59:50] SPEAKER_01: I remember moving to San Francisco
[00:59:52] SPEAKER_01: and we were self funding or not self funding.
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_01: But like I had basically like a billionaire backer.
[00:59:56] SPEAKER_01: So Michael Birch was funding like the lab
[00:59:59] SPEAKER_01: we were using to do startups.
[01:00:00] SPEAKER_01: We didn't take any outside funding.
[01:00:02] SPEAKER_01: But one of our companies started to pop
[01:00:03] SPEAKER_01: and we got a, I don't know, like million users,
[01:00:06] SPEAKER_01: two million users, three million users.
[01:00:07] SPEAKER_01: And VCs got a little bit excited.
[01:00:09] SPEAKER_01: So there was an investor at Founders Fund
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_01: that reached out.
[01:00:12] And I took the meeting because I was always intrigued
[01:00:14] SPEAKER_01: by Peter Teal and I thought, I don't know,
[01:00:16] SPEAKER_01: maybe this will somehow lead to be meeting Peter Teal.
[01:00:19] SPEAKER_01: So let me take this meeting
[01:00:19] SPEAKER_01: even though I really didn't want investment.
[01:00:22] And we go in and I started asking,
[01:00:24] SPEAKER_01: he's supposed to ask me about the business.
[01:00:25] SPEAKER_01: I'm just asking him questions about Founders Fund.
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_01: Because again, I don't really care if he invests in me
[01:00:28] SPEAKER_01: or not, I'm just here to like learn about them.
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_01: And I'm asking all these questions
[01:00:33] SPEAKER_01: that if you ask a normal VC,
[01:00:34] SPEAKER_01: what stage do you normally invest in?
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_01: Answer, pre-seed.
[01:00:38] SPEAKER_01: What's your typical check size?
[01:00:39] SPEAKER_01: Answer, 500K to a million dollars or whatever.
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_01: Everybody's got like these predefined boxes, labels.
[01:00:44] SPEAKER_01: What industries or what categories do you invest in?
[01:00:47] SPEAKER_01: B2B SaaS enterprise, bubble up.
[01:00:49] SPEAKER_01: They have these labels that they were like, you know,
[01:00:51] SPEAKER_01: and I went to the Founders Fund guy,
[01:00:52] SPEAKER_01: I'm asking the same questions.
[01:00:54] SPEAKER_01: He's like, we just, I don't know,
[01:00:56] SPEAKER_01: we just try to find the singular businesses
[01:00:58] SPEAKER_01: and then we back up the truck.
[01:01:00] SPEAKER_01: Like how much money do you need?
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_01: How much money can we put in?
[01:01:02] SPEAKER_01: How much money do you need now?
[01:01:03] SPEAKER_01: Then we'll put more money in later.
[01:01:04] SPEAKER_01: What stage?
[01:01:05] SPEAKER_01: Who cares?
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_01: Let's go.
[01:01:07] SPEAKER_01: And so he was, and he said that when Peter started Founders Fund,
[01:01:10] SPEAKER_01: he had almost like a Fight Club-style rule.
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_01: And the Fight Club-style rule was the only rules
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_01: that there are no rules.
[01:01:16] SPEAKER_01: The rules that we set as a fund
[01:01:18] SPEAKER_01: are going to limit our ability to find the singular business.
[01:01:21] SPEAKER_01: And this is why Founders Fund was one of the only VCs
[01:01:25] SPEAKER_01: to own a shit ton of Bitcoin in, you know,
[01:01:28] SPEAKER_01: starting in 2014, 2015.
[01:01:30] SPEAKER_01: Most VCs couldn't even like buy crypto,
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_01: like buy their by-laws basically.
[01:01:34] SPEAKER_01: And they didn't even see Bitcoin as a, like,
[01:01:37] SPEAKER_01: they were so blinders on to like,
[01:01:39] SPEAKER_01: we need to find the next Facebook, right?
[01:01:41] SPEAKER_01: They need to find the next Mark Zuckerberg
[01:01:43] SPEAKER_01: that they didn't think that this anonymous
[01:01:45] SPEAKER_01: social knock-em-out open-source project
[01:01:47] SPEAKER_01: creating a currency like it broke all the rules.
[01:01:50] SPEAKER_01: But that was the thing that mattered.
[01:01:51] SPEAKER_01: And so Founders Fund has had a few of these really contrary
[01:01:55] SPEAKER_01: in bets. They backed Enderall
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_01: when Silicon Valley, like at the time,
[01:01:59] SPEAKER_01: it was completely unpopular to back a weapons company.
[01:02:03] SPEAKER_01: It was like so like, the time,
[01:02:06] SPEAKER_01: the narrative at the time was that that was a bad thing.
[01:02:09] SPEAKER_01: In fact, Google had to shut down their weapons project.
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_01: They had a big contract with the Department of Defense
[01:02:15] SPEAKER_01: and Google just turned it down
[01:02:16] SPEAKER_01: because their own employees were like,
[01:02:17] SPEAKER_01: this is not right.
[01:02:18] SPEAKER_01: They were like, I don't want to sign up to be part of
[01:02:19] SPEAKER_01: making weapons and killing.
[01:02:21] SPEAKER_01: And so the companies bow down and the venture capital
[01:02:24] SPEAKER_01: has bowed down.
[01:02:24] SPEAKER_01: And there was only a couple of investors
[01:02:26] SPEAKER_01: and Elon Gilles came on this podcast.
[01:02:28] SPEAKER_01: And he said, the day I saw that Google shut that project down,
[01:02:31] SPEAKER_01: I knew there's a huge opportunity.
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_01: If anyone was willing to go against the grain
[01:02:35] SPEAKER_01: and actually build a weapons company,
[01:02:36] SPEAKER_01: they were going to do phenomenally well.
[01:02:38] SPEAKER_01: Like it makes total sense for the US,
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_01: we're going to have a defense department, right?
[01:02:42] SPEAKER_01: I think everyone agrees in that.
[01:02:44] SPEAKER_01: And the defense department is going to need weapons.
[01:02:47] SPEAKER_01: And if the weapons are built by a high tech company,
[01:02:49] SPEAKER_01: that's going to be better than building low tech old school
[01:02:50] SPEAKER_01: weapons, like this all makes sense.
[01:02:52] SPEAKER_01: And that's when he backed Andrewville
[01:02:54] SPEAKER_01: and founders fund backed Andrewville.
[01:02:55] SPEAKER_01: And so I just saw the payoff, you know,
[01:02:58] SPEAKER_01: in Silicon Valley, they call it being contrarian.
[01:03:00] SPEAKER_01: But what does it feel like in practice?
[01:03:02] SPEAKER_01: I think it's what you're talking about.
[01:03:03] SPEAKER_01: The courage to be disliked.
[01:03:04] SPEAKER_01: The courage to look stupid, right?
[01:03:06] SPEAKER_01: The ability to think differently, right?
[01:03:08] SPEAKER_01: All these terms that have been floating around,
[01:03:09] SPEAKER_01: they all sort of applied to this thing.
[01:03:12] And I'll share one more story that kind of reminds me of this,
[01:03:15] SPEAKER_01: which is one of my business heroes is Jesse Itzler.
[01:03:18] SPEAKER_01: And he came, you came to one of our hoop group events,
[01:03:20] SPEAKER_01: the basketball camp we do.
[01:03:22] SPEAKER_01: So Jesse was there and Jesse was laughing.
[01:03:24] SPEAKER_01: Who we were at the table, he was just laughing.
[01:03:25] SPEAKER_01: He's like, all these guys, he's like,
[01:03:27] SPEAKER_01: they're all talking about their like crazy, ambitious plans.
[01:03:30] SPEAKER_01: Like this guy's building a city.
[01:03:32] SPEAKER_01: This guy's building a religion.
[01:03:33] SPEAKER_01: This guy's building rockets.
[01:03:35] SPEAKER_01: This guy's building this and he goes,
[01:03:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm literally selling a calendar.
[01:03:38] SPEAKER_01: Because his project right now is called the Big Ass Calendar.
[01:03:42] SPEAKER_01: Is literally a calendar you put on your wall
[01:03:45] SPEAKER_01: so you could be a little more intentional
[01:03:46] SPEAKER_01: about how you're gonna spend your time this year.
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_01: And he's like, I think it matters,
[01:03:49] SPEAKER_01: but like in the grand scheme of this,
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_01: I sell a $19 calendar.
[01:03:52] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's just funny.
[01:03:53] SPEAKER_01: I'm even here.
[01:03:54] SPEAKER_01: And here's the guy who reinvented himself 10 times,
[01:03:57] SPEAKER_01: did not stay in any box, right?
[01:03:59] SPEAKER_01: Started as a white guy rapper.
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_01: Then he wrote, and that wasn't really fully working out.
[01:04:03] SPEAKER_01: So he writes us a jingle.
[01:04:05] SPEAKER_01: It becomes the New York Knicks song.
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_01: He sells a sports jingle company.
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_01: When he sells the company,
[01:04:09] SPEAKER_01: he gets to ride on this guy's private jet.
[01:04:10] SPEAKER_01: This is amazing.
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_01: Starts a private jet company.
[01:04:13] SPEAKER_01: Gets involved in a coconut water brand.
[01:04:15] SPEAKER_01: But you know, he now hosts a big running event
[01:04:17] SPEAKER_01: because he loves running.
[01:04:18] SPEAKER_01: He has a sauna company because he loves sauna.
[01:04:20] SPEAKER_01: And he basically is just like, almost productize himself.
[01:04:23] SPEAKER_01: And none of the labels that you would,
[01:04:25] SPEAKER_01: you try to, whatever label you try to apply to this guy.
[01:04:27] SPEAKER_01: Like, oh, he must just be a brand builder.
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_01: Then he tells me about how he, you know, invests in this.
[01:04:33] SPEAKER_01: Like, he decided that water was gonna be really important.
[01:04:35] SPEAKER_01: He invested in like land that produced really pure water.
[01:04:38] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, oh wait,
[01:04:39] SPEAKER_01: so you're an investor.
[01:04:40] SPEAKER_01: He's like, well, no, I don't really care about investing.
[01:04:43] SPEAKER_01: I just, yeah.
[01:04:44] SPEAKER_01: So he was unlabelable.
[01:04:46] SPEAKER_01: And so I really find a lot of inspiration
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_01: in people like this.
[01:04:49] SPEAKER_01: And the thing that he said that really stuck with me,
[01:04:52] SPEAKER_01: I was like, so what are you gonna do after this?
[01:04:54] And you know, in this room,
[01:04:55] SPEAKER_01: when you're surrounded by these hyper ambitious,
[01:04:58] SPEAKER_01: hyper-talented people, it's very tempting to just be like,
[01:05:01] SPEAKER_01: oh, I need to ratchet up how big my thing sounds, you know,
[01:05:05] SPEAKER_01: that I'm working on.
[01:05:06] SPEAKER_01: Otherwise, I'm sort of low status in this room.
[01:05:08] SPEAKER_01: And he told me he goes,
[01:05:10] SPEAKER_01: oh, I think I'm gonna go be an assistant basketball coach
[01:05:12] SPEAKER_01: with this like local, like, like,
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_01: this all black college that's nearby.
[01:05:16] SPEAKER_01: Like, I wanna go be the assistant coach.
[01:05:18] SPEAKER_01: Like, I love basketball.
[01:05:18] SPEAKER_01: He's like, but dude, I was like,
[01:05:20] SPEAKER_01: I was like, what are you, why assistant basketball coach?
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_01: Like, clearly not for the money.
[01:05:24] SPEAKER_01: Like, you know, because you wanna get into basketball,
[01:05:26] SPEAKER_01: he's like, no, dude, I just wanna be on the bus.
[01:05:28] SPEAKER_01: He's like, some of the best times in my life
[01:05:30] SPEAKER_01: or on the bus going to a game.
[01:05:32] SPEAKER_01: He's like, if I can just be on the bus,
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_01: oh, dude, that's gonna be good for the soul.
[01:05:35] SPEAKER_01: And I just admire this guy having the courage
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_01: to be like, yeah, I'm gonna go do this thing
[01:05:39] SPEAKER_01: that sounds completely random.
[01:05:41] SPEAKER_01: But as soon as he says it, it instantly resonated.
[01:05:44] SPEAKER_01: And like, I'm actually now an assistant coach
[01:05:46] SPEAKER_01: for a high school basketball team near me
[01:05:47] SPEAKER_01: because I was like, dude, I wanna get on the bus.
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_01: That actually makes total sense to me.
[01:05:51] SPEAKER_01: That was a huge part of my childhood.
[01:05:52] SPEAKER_01: I would have so much fun doing that,
[01:05:54] SPEAKER_01: even though I don't know how that fits with like the rest
[01:05:56] SPEAKER_01: of the stuff, it doesn't really need to fit.
[01:05:58] SPEAKER_01: It just needs to be something I wanna do.
[01:05:59] SPEAKER_01: All that totally resonates.
[01:06:01] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I think, do you ever listen to it
[01:06:03] and invests like the best?
[01:06:05] SPEAKER_00: Amazing, amazing podcast.
[01:06:06] SPEAKER_00: He has some great guests.
[01:06:08] SPEAKER_00: But there's definitely an archetype.
[01:06:10] SPEAKER_00: And the archetype is the autistic, super genius investor
[01:06:13] SPEAKER_00: who is like, I, you know, I buy laundromats.
[01:06:17] SPEAKER_00: Let's say, it's like Brad Jacobs.
[01:06:18] SPEAKER_00: He's like, I just, you know, I choose an industry
[01:06:21] SPEAKER_00: and then for five years, I buy every company in it
[01:06:24] SPEAKER_00: and I take a public and then I make, you know,
[01:06:26] SPEAKER_00: I compound at 30% and then I go do it again and again
[01:06:29] SPEAKER_00: and again and there's a very clear formula.
[01:06:32] SPEAKER_00: And I have never had a formula.
[01:06:36] SPEAKER_00: And I think the benefit of like, there's, okay,
[01:06:39] SPEAKER_00: like I was on Kauai, the Hawaii Island
[01:06:42] SPEAKER_00: and someone goes, you gotta go to this donut place.
[01:06:45] SPEAKER_00: They fry their donuts and coconut oil
[01:06:47] SPEAKER_00: and they're these purple donuts made of sweet potato.
[01:06:50] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, okay, so I go and I, you know,
[01:06:52] SPEAKER_00: it's the amazing delicious donuts
[01:06:54] SPEAKER_00: and I start talking to the guy behind the counter
[01:06:57] SPEAKER_00: and he says, oh yeah, we're expanding.
[01:07:00] SPEAKER_00: We just did one in LA and I said,
[01:07:02] SPEAKER_00: what, you're like a little tiny donut shop on Kauai,
[01:07:06] SPEAKER_00: like how did that happen?
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_00: And he goes, do you know Kevin Rose?
[01:07:09] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, yeah, I know Kevin Rose really well.
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_00: What are you talking about?
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_00: And he goes, Kevin came and he ate these donuts
[01:07:15] SPEAKER_00: and he loved them.
[01:07:16] SPEAKER_00: And so he invested like $10 million in our business
[01:07:19] SPEAKER_00: and now we're scaling it across the country.
[01:07:21] SPEAKER_00: Now, Kevin is a fascinating guy.
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_00: I mean, last time I talked to Kevin, he's like,
[01:07:26] SPEAKER_00: yeah, I did the donut company
[01:07:27] SPEAKER_00: and then I'm flying to Sweden tomorrow
[01:07:29] SPEAKER_00: and I'm meeting with Teenage Engineering
[01:07:31] SPEAKER_00: which is like this audio file company or whatever
[01:07:35] SPEAKER_00: and then, you know, he told me about this Alzheimer's come,
[01:07:37] SPEAKER_00: this company that's doing an Alzheimer's drug
[01:07:40] SPEAKER_00: he invested in, none of those things fit together in a box
[01:07:43] SPEAKER_00: and Kevin is a great example of,
[01:07:45] SPEAKER_00: when I see Kevin on a podcast, I jump.
[01:07:47] SPEAKER_00: Like I have to listen to it.
[01:07:49] SPEAKER_00: Like the random show with Tim Ferris
[01:07:51] SPEAKER_00: is like my favorite show in the world
[01:07:53] SPEAKER_00: and both of those guys have been so good
[01:07:55] SPEAKER_00: at not allowing anyone to put them in a box
[01:07:58] SPEAKER_00: and as a result, they've created this magnet.
[01:08:00] SPEAKER_00: Like the guy's on, if, like, I had two options.
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_00: Let's say I can be value investor Andrew with my formula.
[01:08:08] SPEAKER_00: It'll be very good for raising money.
[01:08:10] SPEAKER_00: I can go on invest like the best.
[01:08:11] SPEAKER_00: I can tell my clean story.
[01:08:13] SPEAKER_00: I'll look like a duck and quack like a duck, right?
[01:08:15] SPEAKER_00: There's a lot of positives to that.
[01:08:16] SPEAKER_00: You get less hate, easy to raise money, you know,
[01:08:19] SPEAKER_00: investors like it, whatever.
[01:08:21] SPEAKER_00: But if you're just interesting
[01:08:22] SPEAKER_00: and you share what you're doing, like Kevin Rose does,
[01:08:25] SPEAKER_00: really interesting things come to you.
[01:08:28] SPEAKER_00: And I would argue like most of our best businesses
[01:08:32] SPEAKER_00: come from me.
[01:08:33] SPEAKER_00: It's like, you know, I was a barista
[01:08:35] SPEAKER_00: and I got obsessed with coffee and I bought Arrowpress.
[01:08:39] SPEAKER_00: I love movies and I tried to invest in film.
[01:08:42] SPEAKER_00: So I actually like had this period
[01:08:44] SPEAKER_00: where I was like flying down to Hollywood
[01:08:46] SPEAKER_00: and meeting people and looking into investing
[01:08:48] SPEAKER_00: in movies and stuff.
[01:08:49] SPEAKER_00: And I looked at it and I was like,
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna lose so much money.
[01:08:52] SPEAKER_00: And at that same time, I happened to be in Auckland
[01:08:55] SPEAKER_00: with Tim Ferris randomly.
[01:08:57] SPEAKER_00: And I was in town and I went,
[01:09:01] SPEAKER_00: oh, there's this guy who runs Letterbox there.
[01:09:03] SPEAKER_00: I should have a coffee with him and that coffee,
[01:09:06] SPEAKER_00: literally, I had coffee with Matt
[01:09:08] SPEAKER_00: and I made an offer for the business within four hours.
[01:09:11] SPEAKER_00: So like these things happen randomly.
[01:09:14] SPEAKER_00: And I think you need to create that magnet
[01:09:17] SPEAKER_00: for interesting people and entrepreneurs to seek you out.
[01:09:20] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know that anybody listens to,
[01:09:24] SPEAKER_00: you know, the autistic super genius
[01:09:26] SPEAKER_00: talk about his formula and spreadsheet
[01:09:28] SPEAKER_00: for buying a type of business and goes,
[01:09:31] SPEAKER_00: I wanna do business with that guy.
[01:09:32] SPEAKER_00: I wanna sell my business to that person.
[01:09:34] SPEAKER_00: Maybe there's a certain type where that is appreciated
[01:09:37] SPEAKER_00: but that's not my jam, you know?
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_00: And you know, I'm gonna get my two to three percent
[01:09:41] SPEAKER_00: hate quota for that and that's just fine by me.
[01:09:45] We can get the hate either way.
[01:09:47] SPEAKER_01: You think those, you think the ASG crowd
[01:09:49] SPEAKER_01: doesn't get the hate?
[01:09:50] SPEAKER_01: Of course they do too, right?
[01:09:51] SPEAKER_01: Totally.
[01:09:52] SPEAKER_01: Either way, if you're not getting the hate,
[01:09:54] SPEAKER_01: you probably haven't, you know,
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_01: it's just a signal you haven't really done enough.
[01:09:58] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you haven't made a hit.
[01:09:59] SPEAKER_01: How jealous are you of you,
[01:10:00] SPEAKER_00: are you by the way of those guys, right?
[01:10:03] SPEAKER_00: I wish that I could be that focused.
[01:10:05] SPEAKER_00: I wish I get that excited about buying
[01:10:08] SPEAKER_00: waste management businesses.
[01:10:09] SPEAKER_00: I do it, but it's just not true.
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's not true to me or you.
[01:10:12] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[01:10:13] SPEAKER_00: Why would I be jealous of something
[01:10:14] SPEAKER_01: that I would be miserable of?
[01:10:16] SPEAKER_00: You mentioned my first million,
[01:10:17] SPEAKER_00: if every time you just talked about one vertical,
[01:10:19] SPEAKER_00: be the most boring podcast of all time.
[01:10:21] SPEAKER_00: The greatest hack in the world is,
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_01: if you're gonna be jealous,
[01:10:25] SPEAKER_01: be jealous of the inputs, not the outputs.
[01:10:28] SPEAKER_01: All right, I just said something profound.
[01:10:29] SPEAKER_01: I'll be, pull over your car, write this down, okay?
[01:10:32] SPEAKER_01: Listen, everybody looks at the result
[01:10:35] SPEAKER_01: that somebody has in their life
[01:10:37] SPEAKER_01: and they get jealous of the result.
[01:10:39] SPEAKER_01: And that leads you astray
[01:10:40] SPEAKER_01: because you don't even really know
[01:10:42] SPEAKER_01: what it takes to be that, to get that, to have that, right?
[01:10:45] SPEAKER_01: If you're gonna be jealous,
[01:10:47] SPEAKER_01: it's hard, so most people try to just turn off
[01:10:49] SPEAKER_01: the jealousy knob, I'm just not gonna do it.
[01:10:51] SPEAKER_01: Well, good luck with that.
[01:10:52] SPEAKER_01: It's a pretty tough thing to do
[01:10:53] SPEAKER_01: to really, truly kill envy inside you, right?
[01:10:56] SPEAKER_01: It's a certain level of enlightenment
[01:10:58] SPEAKER_01: and wisdom you need to reach
[01:10:59] SPEAKER_01: to truly just never feel that envy again.
[01:11:01] SPEAKER_01: So instead, just redirect it.
[01:11:04] Get envious of people whose inputs, your jealous of,
[01:11:07] SPEAKER_01: they're day to day, the work that they do.
[01:11:10] SPEAKER_01: And if you're like, man, I would love for my data,
[01:11:12] SPEAKER_01: look like that, I would love to work like that.
[01:11:14] SPEAKER_01: Not the results of the work, but the work.
[01:11:17] SPEAKER_01: And so for example, Bill Simmons is a guy like this.
[01:11:20] SPEAKER_01: I don't know how much you know about Bill Simmons,
[01:11:21] SPEAKER_01: but he's a sports podcaster.
[01:11:22] SPEAKER_01: But before that, he was a blogger.
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_01: He tried to get hired by newspaper, they rejected him.
[01:11:27] SPEAKER_01: So he starts his own Boston Sports Guy blog.
[01:11:29] SPEAKER_01: And he's just sitting there writing about his hometown sports
[01:11:31] SPEAKER_01: because since he was four years old,
[01:11:33] SPEAKER_01: his dad's been taken into Boston sports games.
[01:11:35] SPEAKER_01: And he somehow like, blogged his way,
[01:11:37] SPEAKER_01: literally to like ESPN ended up giving him his own section.
[01:11:40] SPEAKER_01: Then when he's at ESPN, he's like, I'm not just like,
[01:11:42] SPEAKER_01: and by the way, he's a journalist.
[01:11:44] SPEAKER_01: No, well, he doesn't do journalism.
[01:11:46] SPEAKER_01: He's just writing as a fan.
[01:11:47] SPEAKER_01: So I guess we'll call him a columnist.
[01:11:49] SPEAKER_01: No, he's not really a columnist.
[01:11:50] SPEAKER_01: I guess he's a blogger.
[01:11:51] SPEAKER_01: We couldn't, by the time they were trying to figure out one label,
[01:11:54] SPEAKER_01: he goes and creates 30 for 30.
[01:11:55] SPEAKER_01: He reinvents the sports documentary space.
[01:11:58] And he pulls that off.
[01:11:59] SPEAKER_01: And then he gets fired at ESPN for speaking his mind.
[01:12:02] SPEAKER_01: And he goes and he leaves and he starts the ringer.
[01:12:04] SPEAKER_01: And it's a podcast network.
[01:12:06] SPEAKER_01: And then I always build a podcaster.
[01:12:07] SPEAKER_01: He sells it to Spotify makes hundreds of billions dollars.
[01:12:10] SPEAKER_01: And there's this great clip the other day
[01:12:11] SPEAKER_01: that came out of like this big trade happened in the NFL.
[01:12:14] SPEAKER_01: And there's this clip clip in the ringer office
[01:12:16] SPEAKER_01: and Bill is carrying a microphone in one hand and a chair.
[01:12:19] SPEAKER_01: And he's like basically like jogging through the hallway
[01:12:21] SPEAKER_01: because he wants to go join one of the other ringer podcast
[01:12:24] SPEAKER_01: to come talk about this trade that just happened.
[01:12:26] SPEAKER_01: Like, that's not his podcast.
[01:12:27] SPEAKER_01: He doesn't need to be there.
[01:12:29] SPEAKER_01: He's got all the money in the world.
[01:12:30] SPEAKER_01: He could be on a yacht.
[01:12:31] SPEAKER_01: He could be on an island.
[01:12:31] SPEAKER_01: And he's sitting there running with a chair and a mic
[01:12:33] SPEAKER_01: because he really wants to go talk to friends
[01:12:35] SPEAKER_01: about what's going on in the world of sports
[01:12:37] SPEAKER_01: because that's what he loves to do.
[01:12:38] SPEAKER_01: So I'm jealous of Bill Simmons,
[01:12:40] SPEAKER_01: not because he sold his company for hundreds of millions dollars
[01:12:42] SPEAKER_01: or has a popular podcast.
[01:12:44] SPEAKER_01: But because the guy gets to talk to his buddies
[01:12:45] SPEAKER_01: about the thing that he loves all day
[01:12:47] SPEAKER_01: and when he doesn't have to be, right?
[01:12:48] SPEAKER_01: And so I'm jealous of the inputs.
[01:12:50] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know, I think that's a thing that if more people did,
[01:12:53] SPEAKER_01: you could kind of use your jealousy as more of a compass
[01:12:55] SPEAKER_01: to figure out what do you really want to go do?
[01:12:58] I think if more people knew the behind the scenes
[01:13:01] SPEAKER_00: of a lot of these super wealthy people,
[01:13:03] SPEAKER_00: they wouldn't want that life.
[01:13:05] SPEAKER_00: Like, there's a lot of, there's a lot of sad,
[01:13:08] SPEAKER_00: very wealthy people, as you know.
[01:13:11] SPEAKER_00: I think the trick is how do you figure out what you're great at
[01:13:14] SPEAKER_00: and you actually enjoy?
[01:13:15] SPEAKER_00: Because there's things I'm great at that I just don't enjoy.
[01:13:17] SPEAKER_00: Like sales, I love pitching and selling and talking to people,
[01:13:22] SPEAKER_00: or sorry, I'm very good at it.
[01:13:23] SPEAKER_00: But I actually drains my life force.
[01:13:26] SPEAKER_00: It's misery, right?
[01:13:28] SPEAKER_00: And so I think like, you know, for me,
[01:13:30] SPEAKER_00: I started out headphones on, coding,
[01:13:33] SPEAKER_00: making websites.
[01:13:34] SPEAKER_00: 20 years later, I've realized I can write
[01:13:37] SPEAKER_00: and talk about things I'm passionate about.
[01:13:39] SPEAKER_00: And that creates opportunity,
[01:13:41] SPEAKER_00: which I can then funnel into all my various businesses.
[01:13:44] SPEAKER_00: Like I think being a human router and just doing the thing,
[01:13:48] SPEAKER_00: you're great at you're doing this too.
[01:13:49] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's like Ben might run all the day to day operations.
[01:13:52] SPEAKER_00: You just get to go and do the thing you're amazing at.
[01:13:54] SPEAKER_00: And it benefits your business in a profound way.
[01:13:57] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's the trick.
[01:13:58] SPEAKER_00: Well, I would even push back.
[01:14:00] SPEAKER_01: It's not even that, oh man,
[01:14:01] SPEAKER_01: there's always both people who are miserable.
[01:14:02] SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of other people who are happy,
[01:14:04] SPEAKER_01: doing something that you would be completely unhappy doing.
[01:14:07] SPEAKER_01: I remember when we got bought by Twitch and I was like,
[01:14:09] SPEAKER_01: oh, you know, I get to meet Emmett, he was my boss.
[01:14:11] SPEAKER_01: He's the founder of Twitch.
[01:14:12] SPEAKER_01: He did the thing that I had been trying to do.
[01:14:14] SPEAKER_01: He started a tech company.
[01:14:16] SPEAKER_01: It like took over the space that he was in.
[01:14:18] SPEAKER_01: It became like one of the few social networks I was out there.
[01:14:21] SPEAKER_01: That's what I was trying to do before that.
[01:14:23] SPEAKER_01: And you know, the guy sold his company for a billion dollars
[01:14:26] SPEAKER_01: and here he was running this thing.
[01:14:27] SPEAKER_01: And it was like a big part of the internet.
[01:14:29] SPEAKER_01: I think Twitch was like the second biggest consumer of bandwidth
[01:14:31] SPEAKER_01: or something in that year.
[01:14:32] SPEAKER_01: Like it was crazy.
[01:14:34] SPEAKER_01: And I saw his day and he was happy doing it,
[01:14:37] SPEAKER_01: which was basically he sat in the boardroom
[01:14:39] SPEAKER_01: on the ninth floor of the office on a long table.
[01:14:43] SPEAKER_01: And he sat at the front and the CEO sat next to him
[01:14:44] SPEAKER_01: and then teams would come in 30 minutes at a time.
[01:14:47] SPEAKER_01: And they would sit down, they would put a memo in front of him.
[01:14:49] SPEAKER_01: He would read it, he would ask them questions,
[01:14:50] SPEAKER_01: he would grill them and sometimes he'd be like,
[01:14:51] SPEAKER_01: this sounds fantastic, can't wait to see what's next.
[01:14:53] SPEAKER_01: And sometimes he'd be like, this doesn't make any sense to me
[01:14:56] SPEAKER_01: and he would kind of rip them apart.
[01:14:57] SPEAKER_01: And then they would be like, leave, go back,
[01:14:59] SPEAKER_01: they would do a week of work and come back again
[01:15:00] SPEAKER_01: the next week for their weekly 30 minute meeting with him.
[01:15:03] SPEAKER_01: And that's what he did all day.
[01:15:04] SPEAKER_01: And I just remember looking at that and being like,
[01:15:07] SPEAKER_01: thank God I saw this because this is not what I would want.
[01:15:09] SPEAKER_01: I thought this was my dream.
[01:15:11] SPEAKER_01: I thought literally what he was doing,
[01:15:12] SPEAKER_01: what he had done was the dream for me, dream outcome.
[01:15:15] SPEAKER_01: And I realized that would be kind of a nightmare of a life.
[01:15:18] SPEAKER_01: And so wait, if that's the nightmare, not the dream,
[01:15:20] SPEAKER_01: then what's the dream?
[01:15:21] SPEAKER_01: And then you start asking, I need to start looking around,
[01:15:23] SPEAKER_01: and you start thinking about what would be really interesting.
[01:15:25] SPEAKER_01: And that's when I started the podcast
[01:15:26] SPEAKER_01: because I looked at Tim Ferris and others
[01:15:28] SPEAKER_01: and I thought that sounds pretty fun.
[01:15:29] SPEAKER_01: And so an easy hack, because I'm starting a new content project,
[01:15:33] SPEAKER_01: my first new kind of big content project since my first million.
[01:15:36] SPEAKER_01: And the trick is instead of asking,
[01:15:39] SPEAKER_01: instead of trying to think about what would be really popular,
[01:15:41] SPEAKER_01: what would get millions of views,
[01:15:43] SPEAKER_01: what would get millions of subscribers,
[01:15:45] SPEAKER_01: the better question is,
[01:15:46] SPEAKER_01: what would I have fun doing 3000 times?
[01:15:49] SPEAKER_01: Because if I do it 3000 times,
[01:15:50] SPEAKER_01: I'm probably gonna get good at it
[01:15:52] SPEAKER_01: and I'm probably gonna stick with it
[01:15:53] SPEAKER_01: and then I'm probably gonna get a good result, sure.
[01:15:55] SPEAKER_01: But like more importantly,
[01:15:56] SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna go do it 3000 times.
[01:15:57] SPEAKER_01: I better really be like, let me optimize for that
[01:16:00] SPEAKER_01: instead of optimize for what might work.
[01:16:02] SPEAKER_01: Let me ask you this, are you leaving your cell?
[01:16:05] SPEAKER_00: Are you breaking out of yourself?
[01:16:06] SPEAKER_00: Is it something that people go, wow, this is like crazy?
[01:16:09] SPEAKER_00: It's like when Tim Ferris launched his card game
[01:16:12] SPEAKER_00: or he wrote his like,
[01:16:14] SPEAKER_00: he made that weird crypto project, is it one of those?
[01:16:16] SPEAKER_00: I've explored that wide, like totally weird.
[01:16:20] SPEAKER_01: We're moving, go make a movie, create a Broadway play.
[01:16:23] SPEAKER_01: Like I've explored all that.
[01:16:24] SPEAKER_01: And there's like things,
[01:16:26] SPEAKER_01: but that's not the active thing I'm working on.
[01:16:29] One of them is, I would say different in that
[01:16:32] SPEAKER_01: it's a different mode to be in.
[01:16:34] SPEAKER_01: So for example, this podcast is live,
[01:16:36] SPEAKER_01: it's improvised, it's unedited.
[01:16:38] SPEAKER_01: I get on here and I just do me.
[01:16:40] SPEAKER_01: And then I don't really think about it after the fact
[01:16:41] SPEAKER_01: there's a team that basically takes it, they edit it,
[01:16:43] SPEAKER_01: they title it, they package it, they set it out there.
[01:16:46] SPEAKER_01: And I don't really think about it again.
[01:16:48] SPEAKER_01: Whereas the thing I'm doing right now
[01:16:49] SPEAKER_01: is a little bit more of a craftsman approach.
[01:16:51] SPEAKER_01: It's like, I'm not just gonna improvise it
[01:16:53] SPEAKER_01: and it's this like, you know, three weeks later
[01:16:55] SPEAKER_01: that's kind of gone, I'm gonna make a new one.
[01:16:56] SPEAKER_01: It's like, no, I'm gonna make one thing,
[01:16:58] SPEAKER_01: it's gonna be great.
[01:16:59] SPEAKER_01: But that means I'm gonna really like have to be a craftsman
[01:17:01] SPEAKER_01: about this and I'm gonna really have to go
[01:17:02] SPEAKER_01: and take a scalpel to this and try to like,
[01:17:05] SPEAKER_01: make it as great as I possibly can,
[01:17:07] SPEAKER_01: which is not a mode I'm normally in.
[01:17:09] SPEAKER_01: That's awesome.
[01:17:10] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's like the happiest I've been in the last
[01:17:13] SPEAKER_00: 10 years is writing my book, just headphones on,
[01:17:16] SPEAKER_00: doing something and actually shipping something
[01:17:19] SPEAKER_00: that will be relevant hopefully in 20 years
[01:17:21] SPEAKER_00: that you can go back to.
[01:17:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[01:17:23] SPEAKER_00: And there's something so ephemeral about podcasting
[01:17:25] SPEAKER_00: and tweeting and all the other stuff.
[01:17:26] SPEAKER_00: So nice to zoom out totally.
[01:17:29] Well, Andrew, thanks for coming on again, Matt.
[01:17:31] SPEAKER_01: I was good to hang and yeah, you wanna shout out anything,
[01:17:35] SPEAKER_01: your newsletter or anything you wanna shout out?
[01:17:38] Yeah, I mean, that's mostly, I haven't really actually
[01:17:40] SPEAKER_00: been tweeting very much.
[01:17:41] SPEAKER_00: I've been posting on my newsletter and I really love it.
[01:17:44] SPEAKER_00: I sit down like once a month and I kind of do like
[01:17:47] SPEAKER_00: what Tim Ferris and Kevin do.
[01:17:49] SPEAKER_00: I just like write about all the random things
[01:17:51] SPEAKER_00: I'm excited about.
[01:17:52] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes it's about business, sometimes it's about
[01:17:54] SPEAKER_00: other stuff.
[01:17:55] SPEAKER_00: But yeah, people can sign up never enough.com,
[01:17:58] SPEAKER_00: the newsletter's there and I love it.
[01:18:00] SPEAKER_00: Like it's been so much more enjoyable to just sit down
[01:18:04] SPEAKER_00: and actually write something formally and take my time
[01:18:07] SPEAKER_00: instead of like tweeting out toilet thoughts
[01:18:10] SPEAKER_00: randomly and then fighting with trolls.
[01:18:11] SPEAKER_00: All right, man, good to see you.
[01:18:14] Yeah, great to see you, dude.
