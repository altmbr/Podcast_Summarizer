**Podcast:** More or Less
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Participants:** Jess running The Information's massive WTF conference, Sam off-grid on a mountain, Brit, Dave hold down the fort with Stuart L, esberg, CEO of Seneca, a Slow-, Offline-backed startup building autonomous firefighting drones. Between deep tech inside jokes, Stuart coins pro-America tech, Seneca’s model of detect early, respond fast, outperforms retrofitting homes or relying on pilots. With dem, rising from cities, utilities, insurers protecting $5T in assets, Stuart’s focused on building long-term enterprise value, not chasing the AI hype cycle., us here:

# [Podcast Summary: Stuart Landisberg, Founder & CEO of Seneca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7iOALPPhAA)

## 1. Key Themes

### **Early Fire Intervention Through Autonomous Technology**
The breakthrough insight is stopping fires when they're small rather than fighting mega-fires. Stuart explains: "We know that fire grows exponentially. And so if you can get to a fire in the first 10, 15, 20 minutes, we fly in five aircraft strike teams, you can actually take out a fire that's a couple hundred square feet, much less apparatus than you'd think of for a mega fire, because you get there when you're small." This represents a paradigm shift from the traditional approach of fighting large fires to preventing them from ever becoming large.

### **The Trillion-Dollar Fire Problem**
Wildfires represent a massive economic threat that rivals or exceeds other major risks. Stuart states: "There's a joint Senate committee that a couple of years ago said the cost was about just shy of a trillion dollars. And we already know that because of policy, 2025 will be the most expensive year on record. So almost certainly over a trillion dollars of economic cost to the US." Dave adds the perspective: "I mean, that's like more than cybercrime or terrorism." This positions fire prevention as a critical infrastructure problem, not just an environmental issue.

### **The Technology Convergence Moment**
Multiple technologies have converged to make autonomous firefighting drones possible now. Stuart explains: "We're at this really interesting point today where the combination of advanced manufacturing and 3D printing, like what we know to be possible in the physics of autonomous and like unmanned aircraft, and the ability to use the incoming data from cameras and other sensors and combined it with some of the transformer model technology to allow you to effectively dispatch an aircraft in an autonomous fashion." He emphasizes this convergence "really came together in the last five years" to make the solution viable.

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### **Night Operations as Untapped Opportunity**
Most people assume firefighting happens 24/7, but Stuart reveals a major gap: "Today there's very little night firefighting apparatus." When asked why helicopters don't fly at night, he explains: "Pilots. They can't see the mountains. It's too dangerous. The hardest hire is a night vision trained helicopter pilot." He adds the contrarian insight that climate change has eliminated the traditional natural fire brake: "Historically, firefighting at night stops because humidity would increase and temperatures would decrease...humidity at night, especially during fire season is still pretty low." He cites a Napa fire that "grew from like a thousand acres to a bit over 3000 acres overnight" while operations were mostly stopped. Autonomous aircraft don't have this limitation.

### **Fire Services Lack DARPA-Style Innovation Infrastructure**
Unlike defense, fire services have developed without centralized R&D support. Stuart observes: "Think about the history of fire. There's something like 20,000 fire departments across the country...Every town had its own fire department. And the legacy of that means that there's a ton of independent fire departments...You contrast that to what's happened in national defense where you have DARPA, you have all of this incredible...the most important technologies have been built because of federal support for the military. And you've got like real training programs...None of that infrastructure exists to support the fire service." This fragmentation explains why innovation has been so slow despite the enormous economic stakes.

### **Insurance Crisis as Catalyst for Change**
The traditional approach has been structural protection, but Stuart argues this misses the point: "I was like this is totally irrational. It's a broken market will go structure by structure. And when you talk to most of the chiefs and fire scientists...they all will say that better than going structure by structure is the idea of stopping the fire when it's small." He notes that the Palisades fire changed everything: "Paradise was a terrible fire but not particularly affluent and influential community. Palisades, super visible affluent and influential community and I think now people with resources realize oh my god it could happen to me...the insurance companies are basically say hey we can't insure a whole big portion of the American West and that's a very strong economic motivator for like five trillion of home assets that's at high fire risk."

## 3. Companies Identified

### **Seneca**
**Description:** Develops intelligent autonomous firefighting drones that can respond to fires within 5-10 minutes of detection. Five drones operate as a "strike team" covering 30 square miles, carrying equivalent payload to a full fire engine. Can reload from any fire engine and operate 24/7 including at night.

**Key Quotes:**
- "We make intelligent autonomous robotics, specifically autonomous firefighting drones...built really for places where existing technology makes important situations impossible, unsafe or inefficient for firefighters." - Stuart Landisberg
- "Five drones per 30 square mile radius...They'll fly out, get to the fire, hopefully within five minutes or so of detection. And so that should be more than enough payload to take out the fire." - Stuart
- Working with San Bernardino County Fire (covers 20,000+ square miles) where "chief Muncie...his vision is we want to stop 90 percent of fires within a hundred square feet" vs traditional metric of 10 acres

### **Grove Collaborative** (context for founder's background)
**Description:** Consumer internet business focused on sustainable household products. Grew to 2,000 employees and $2-3B in revenue before going public.

**Key Quote:**
- "Back in 2012, decided I wanted to be an operator and started a consumer internet business called Grove Collaborative, which ultimately had its peak was 2000 employees. And I think while I was a CEO, we did between $2 and $3 billion of overall revenue. Took that business public in 22." - Stuart Landisberg

## 4. Operating Insights

### **Product Evolution Over Scale**
Balance early deployment with long-term product excellence. Stuart explains his scaling philosophy: "Whatever we fly in 26 will be worse than what we fly in 27 which will be worse than what we fly in 28...by the time we're making a thousand aircraft a year it's going to be much harder to make changes...the challenge is how do you make a product that's good enough in 26 that people will line up and buy it now and also not make so many of them that...by the time you're manufacturing thousand in 28 the product is so nails that it feels like an iPhone to everyone who uses it."

### **Embrace Failure to Accelerate Learning**
Create a culture that aggressively tests and learns from crashes. Stuart shares: "I will never forget our first crash...we have this beautiful aircraft and first fucking flight of the day just flames right and oh my gosh was that the best thing that ever happened because we've gotten so much better reliable we basically been revenge building a hundred hours a week." This stoic philosophy of "Amor Fati" (love your fate) allows the team to turn setbacks into rapid improvements.

### **Work With the Most Demanding Customers First**
Partner with agencies already advanced in the technology to push the product harder. Stuart states: "We try to work with agencies that are already really really good at using drones...we want to work with the most demanding people in the country and Aspen and San Bernardino are two wonderful development partners who I think are incredibly frontline oriented."

### **Capital Market Advantage as Strategic Weapon**
Leverage America's superior capital markets for manufacturing scale-up. Stuart argues: "What allows the US to beat some of the more industrialized...manufacturing nations over the next 10 years our capital markets are the best in the world...does our industrial capacity match China? no chance but our capital markets are incredible and so when I think about the opportunity to scale up technology...if capital continues to flow then the opportunity to scale something like this up" becomes America's competitive advantage.
