[00:00:00] But we know that fire grows exponentially.
[00:00:02] Stuart: And so if you can get to a fire in the first 10, 15, 20 minutes,
[00:00:06] Stuart: we fly in five aircraft strike teams,
[00:00:08] Stuart: you can actually take out a fire that's a couple hundred square feet,
[00:00:12] Stuart: much less apparatus than you'd think of for a mega fire,
[00:00:14] Stuart: because you get there when you're small.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_02: Yes, put it all right to the test.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_02: More less.
[00:00:37] Hello, hello, everyone.
[00:00:38] Britt: Welcome back to another episode of More or Less.
[00:00:41] Britt: This is Britt Moran here.
[00:00:42] Britt: I've got my partner and fellow co-host Dave Moran,
[00:00:45] Britt: and I don't have my two other co-hosts,
[00:00:48] Britt: this week.
[00:00:48] Britt: One of them is validly hosting a very large conference.
[00:00:53] Britt: That would be just the other one is climbing a mountain somewhere in the world.
[00:00:57] Britt: We still don't even know where he is.
[00:00:59] Britt: That would be Sam.
[00:01:02] Britt: Such the morons are driving the show today.
[00:01:05] Britt: And we are so excited to have one of our favorite founders and friends here with us,
[00:01:11] Britt: Stuart Landisberg, the founder and CEO of Seneca,
[00:01:14] Britt: which is doing something really incredible in terms of fire fighting technology using drones,
[00:01:20] Britt: which we will go into in a lot of detail.
[00:01:23] Britt: And actually to give Sam some credit here,
[00:01:26] Britt: slow is also an investor.
[00:01:27] Britt: So it's as slow an offline deal.
[00:01:30] Britt: We're just taking over to talk our collective book entirely.
[00:01:34] Well, I think we also will get to Stuart.
[00:01:36] Britt: I'm going to let you talk in a second,
[00:01:37] Britt: but we're also I think really passionate and interested in what's happening right now in the
[00:01:40] Britt: valley with hardware, robotics, AI, drones, defense tech.
[00:01:46] Britt: And so there are a lot of themes we're going to hit on today.
[00:01:48] Britt: Do we still call it defense tech?
[00:01:50] Dave: Are we calling it offense tech now?
[00:01:52] Dave: Is that Stuart's first question?
[00:01:53] Britt: All right, go ahead Stuart.
[00:01:54] Britt: No.
[00:01:56] I just know that it's pro-American tech, right?
[00:01:59] Stuart: I'm here for the reindustrialization.
[00:02:01] Stuart: Anyway, great to be on.
[00:02:03] Thanks for being here today.
[00:02:05] Britt: Okay, so for anyone who doesn't know you, maybe give us a little bit of your background,
[00:02:09] Britt: how you got to Silicon Valley.
[00:02:11] Britt: This isn't your first rodeo either running a company.
[00:02:14] Britt: So maybe give us a little taste of who you've been prior to Seneca.
[00:02:19] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:19] So glad to be here.
[00:02:21] Stuart: Fan of the pod and of slow and offline.
[00:02:25] Stuart: Grateful for the partnership.
[00:02:27] Stuart: As you said, Seneca is my current company.
[00:02:29] Stuart: We make intelligent autonomous robotics, specifically autonomous firefighting drones.
[00:02:34] Stuart: And I'm excited to talk about exactly how those were,
[00:02:37] Stuart: but built really four places where existing technology makes important situations impossible,
[00:02:43] Stuart: unsafe for inefficient for firefighters.
[00:02:44] Stuart: So my personal background, I actually came out to Silicon Valley as a finance person,
[00:02:50] Stuart: don't hold against me.
[00:02:51] Stuart: We're did a really wonderful big firm out here called TPG, covered consumer there, spent a minute,
[00:02:58] Stuart: running a US book for a long short technology focused hedge fund.
[00:03:02] Stuart: And then back in 2012, decided I wanted to be an operator and started a consumer internet
[00:03:07] Stuart: business called Grove Collaborative, which ultimately had its peak was 2000 employees.
[00:03:12] Stuart: And I think while I was a CEO, we did between $2 and $3 billion of overall revenue.
[00:03:18] Stuart: Took that business public in 22 and hired after that, a really wonderful CEO.
[00:03:22] Stuart: And went looking for my next project.
[00:03:27] Stuart: And a lot of the trends you just talked about had become really important to me,
[00:03:32] Stuart: thinking about what does the physical manifestation of technology need to look like
[00:03:39] Stuart: in order for the West to continue thriving over the next 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 years.
[00:03:45] Stuart: And I live in Northern California and build value, which for people who don't know,
[00:03:49] Stuart: my home is truly among the trees, which is wonderful.
[00:03:53] Stuart: And also when there are wildfires totally terrifying.
[00:03:56] Stuart: So this is something I have a problem that I experience personally,
[00:04:00] Stuart: firefighters say my father-in-law's house in Sonoma.
[00:04:03] Stuart: And so anyway, I've been building technology companies, I suppose, for the better part of the
[00:04:08] Stuart: last decade and a half. And this is a really wonderful and important problem to go after.
[00:04:13] Stuart: You left Grove Wind, 2022. You said you took a public.
[00:04:16] Britt: 2023. Took a public in 2022.
[00:04:18] Stuart: Did you take a break after that?
[00:04:20] Britt: So I took a basically as long a break as I needed to be able to be sure what the next company was.
[00:04:25] Stuart: So I left in August my wonderful wife and three kids went to sort of traveled for a year.
[00:04:31] Stuart: And I had a goal of reading 100 bucks.
[00:04:34] Stuart: And basically, prototyping companies until I found one that I was 100% all in on.
[00:04:40] Stuart: So took a break, but in that time really tried to study.
[00:04:44] Stuart: It's very hard to study while running a company.
[00:04:46] Stuart: But there's so much amazing learning out there if you take the time to read.
[00:04:50] Stuart: Was there something in your brain, though, when that you were like,
[00:04:52] Britt: of course I'm starting another company, or was it like this is, it's a slog,
[00:04:57] Britt: but I feel like I have to do it. This is such a big mission.
[00:05:00] Britt: Like, which kind of serial entrepreneur are you?
[00:05:02] Britt: I guess is what I'm trying to ask.
[00:05:04] Britt: I didn't assume that I was a serial entrepreneur.
[00:05:06] Stuart: I don't still don't identify as a serial entrepreneur.
[00:05:08] Stuart: After I left Grove, I got a bunch of really wonderful offers to run larger companies,
[00:05:12] Stuart: or go be the CEO of X Company and will buy it and you can run it, or roll up X large industry.
[00:05:19] Stuart: Very companies bigger than Grove, really exciting stuff.
[00:05:23] Stuart: But fundamentally every time it came down to that if you don't start the company,
[00:05:28] Stuart: you don't get to create the mission.
[00:05:30] Stuart: And if you don't create the mission, you don't get to set the change.
[00:05:34] Stuart: You don't get to set the impact that the company has in the world.
[00:05:37] Stuart: And I think that there's something insanely gratifying and dictating and
[00:05:44] Stuart: lucky, like meaning of life affirming in that you can be like,
[00:05:46] Stuart: I want to see the world change in a certain way.
[00:05:50] Stuart: And I'm going to like dedicate 100% of my life force to that.
[00:05:54] Stuart: That's only true if you can be a founder.
[00:05:56] Stuart: And so I found it became inevitable that this is a place that I would,
[00:06:00] Stuart: would, that I would do another one of these.
[00:06:02] Stuart: And I super delighted that I am.
[00:06:05] Stuart: But I still don't really think of myself as a serial entrepreneur.
[00:06:07] Stuart: Your mission driven person.
[00:06:09] Britt: Yeah, there's some sort of like heroin hit of like,
[00:06:12] Stuart: no words, no experience.
[00:06:13] Stuart: But they'll like, the feeling of like, oh my god, I wanted this thing to exist.
[00:06:16] Stuart: And now it does.
[00:06:18] Stuart: That I feel like is once again, it's hard to, it's hard to feel like anything else is quite
[00:06:22] Stuart: just good.
[00:06:23] Stuart: David, I understand that.
[00:06:24] Britt: And Dave, you, you should share more about your firefighting family history.
[00:06:30] It's sort of lingers in your genes.
[00:06:32] Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:06:33] Dave: One of the more interesting things is that I grew up in Montana and both my biological and my
[00:06:40] Dave: my step family, I have firefighting background.
[00:06:44] Dave: My grandfather actually was in the 101st Airborne during the war.
[00:06:50] Dave: And after the war, he was a, he was a doctor and he became trained as a paradox.
[00:06:55] Dave: And so after the war, they were like, where do we send all these doctors that can jump out of
[00:07:00] Dave: planes? They came back from the war and they said, you know, where should we send them?
[00:07:04] Dave: And they had all these people dying in the wilderness in the West.
[00:07:07] Dave: And so that's how my family ended up being from Montana.
[00:07:10] Dave: My grandfather got stationed first in Colorado, then in South Dakota and ultimately in Montana.
[00:07:16] Dave: And after he got out of the military, they were like, he really still enjoyed jumping out of
[00:07:21] Dave: planes. And so the best version of doing that in Montana was to be a paradox or jumping into
[00:07:27] Dave: fires to save firefighters. And so he became a smoke jumper. And these are the guys that literally
[00:07:35] Dave: jump out of planes with parachutes into fires to dig the first lines to try to stop forest fires.
[00:07:43] Dave: It's kind of these stories were like animating stories of my childhood. And then my stepfather,
[00:07:50] Dave: his, so my stepbrothers actually, both of them were also potshots, which are like the
[00:07:55] Dave: grounded infantry that run into fires. And one of my stepbrothers ended up being an engine
[00:08:02] Dave: chief and then helping to run the entire Montana firefighting operation. This has been like a
[00:08:07] Dave: dinner table conversation for basically my entire life. So first off, I want to thank Dave's
[00:08:12] Stuart: family for the time in the fires. It's when you spend time in fire stations doing ride along
[00:08:19] Stuart: city and air ops bases. The, we really celebrate American heroes a lot in the military. People
[00:08:24] Stuart: who put their lives on the line. But the men and women of the fire service do this to an incredible
[00:08:30] Stuart: extent as well. It's really insane. I don't think people understand how crazy it is. How many people
[00:08:35] Dave: die per year suit like fighting fires? How many firefighters do you know that's that? It really
[00:08:40] Stuart: is going to vary year to year. But the best example that I like to think of and this is still,
[00:08:44] Stuart: you know, we as civilians probably take this largely for granted. But if you think about 9-11,
[00:08:49] Stuart: which is the deadliest day for first responders in the history of the country,
[00:08:53] Stuart: there's all these amazing pictures. And I recommend if anybody's near a fire station on September
[00:08:58] Stuart: 11, then you go and listen to the ceremony that happens there. But you see all these pictures,
[00:09:02] Stuart: right? Of people running out and away from ground zero. And in those pictures, you also see the
[00:09:08] Stuart: firefighters like running into the buildings, running up the stairs of the buildings as they're
[00:09:13] Stuart: falling down. And then you meet these people and they're like parents with kids and families.
[00:09:20] Stuart: And you know, you sit in the air ops base, the same DNA that people were running into the towers.
[00:09:26] Stuart: And they're talking about how, you know, there's a bunch of homes on the hillside in the
[00:09:29] Stuart: winds blowing 45-50 miles an hour and there's gusts and winds. And the guys like I've been surviving
[00:09:34] Stuart: in the helicopter for 27 years. And you know, I know I got two kids at home, but I also know it's my
[00:09:40] Stuart: job to save those people in that property. And so I'm going, even though it might not be safe,
[00:09:44] Stuart: like I'm going. And I mean, it's, I mean, it says smoke jumpers are something the original
[00:09:49] Stuart: first responders and the risk goes people took was incredible. But there's just an amazing
[00:09:54] Stuart: legacy in the fire service of taking real, I mean, risking a lot to save a lot, but I think it's
[00:10:00] Stuart: anyway, I'm really, when you spend your career around technologists and capitalists and then you
[00:10:05] Stuart: spend a ton of time with public servants, I have found it to be wildly humbly. So there's also a,
[00:10:11] Dave: there's a great book recommendation if people want to get into the lives these people live called
[00:10:15] Dave: Young Men in Fire, which was actually written by the guy who wrote a river on through it,
[00:10:21] Dave: which the famous movie everybody knows, that's like truly amazing. It's like the story of these
[00:10:26] Dave: smoke jumpers and like the sort of harrowing things that they go through. I was just saying our
[00:10:30] Dave: boardroom is named Mandolch after the lake. Oh, really? And one word, that's so cool. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:36] Stuart: So obviously, rescue for humans and for the servants who are those firefighters and the helicopter
[00:10:43] Britt: pilots and airplane pilots, it's also obviously very expensive to the economy. What's the total cost
[00:10:48] Britt: annually now that wildfires creates for us in the US alone? There's a joint Senate committee that
[00:10:55] Stuart: a couple of years ago said the cost was about just shy of a trillion dollars. And we already know
[00:11:00] Stuart: that because of policy, it's 2025 will be the most expensive year on record. So almost certainly
[00:11:05] Stuart: over a trillion dollars of economic cost to the US, which is just you know, almost a mind boggling
[00:11:11] Stuart: number. It's insane. I mean, that's like more than cybercrime or terrorism. Like, why don't we treat
[00:11:18] Dave: it like that? I guess is the question. It's a really interesting question. I think we as a species
[00:11:25] Stuart: in society don't like to think about bad things that are going to happen to us. And so we all live in
[00:11:30] Stuart: our like nice like, oh, we live in a beautiful wooded area and wildfires. I know it's a risk,
[00:11:36] Stuart: but probably it's not going to happen. It feels to me a little bit like, why do people you, you know,
[00:11:41] Stuart: peed so much pizza and french fries and McDonald's and whatever, right? Like we know that there's
[00:11:48] let me guess there's no ARR and fire prevention. I mean, it is true. Look, when we built the product,
[00:11:55] Stuart: you can look at the sides of the market and see where the dollars are. And unfortunately,
[00:11:59] Stuart: people would rather spend the suddenly, there's hundreds of billions of dollars already in fire
[00:12:05] Stuart: suppression spend in the US. Fire prevention spend is really is much less popular. What is the most
[00:12:11] Britt: popular thing as far as fire prevention spend? Like what is the most innovation happening in that
[00:12:17] Britt: space right now? I think the most important spend is probably in prescribed burns. And people in
[00:12:25] Stuart: the fire industry talk a lot about good fire and the need for there to be fire on the ground,
[00:12:30] Stuart: right? There's been fires in many of these landscapes for the centuries, that like forever.
[00:12:36] Stuart: And we now have regime where we suppress all the fire. And so, you know, within the fire service,
[00:12:41] Stuart: it's quite interesting. There is a real debate about the extent to which global warming
[00:12:44] Stuart: exists, the extent to which it's been made and the extent to which it impacts fire. But there's
[00:12:49] Stuart: no debate about the extent to which over suppression and really dense forests has meant that there's a
[00:12:57] Stuart: fuel low, basically like a ton of dry shit on the ground. That's probably not exactly how they're
[00:13:01] Stuart: described it. But you can imagine it that like that makes it much, much more dangerous than ever before.
[00:13:08] Stuart: And so one of the goals of Seneca is to be able to make sure that it's more cost effective and safer
[00:13:15] Stuart: and honestly more popular to light prescribed burns because prescribed burns for the audience
[00:13:22] Stuart: is where you say, okay, X area we know is really high fire risk. We're going to pick a day that we
[00:13:27] Stuart: think is safe and we're going to do a prescribed burn. We're going to burn it on purpose and hopefully
[00:13:32] Stuart: it doesn't get out of control. But to your point, air support having helicopters on hand,
[00:13:37] Stuart: the typical fire helicopter is somewhere between 12 and $15,000 an hour to operate. They're in
[00:13:43] Stuart: massively short supply and it's an obvious comment. You also need to have them collocated,
[00:13:48] Stuart: you need pilots, you need like a helicopter, it's a lot of logistical complexity. But also it is
[00:13:56] Stuart: true that some of the biggest fires over the last decade have been prescribed burns that got out of
[00:14:01] Stuart: control. And so among the goals of Seneca is to be able to build a technology that is capable enough
[00:14:08] Stuart: that it gives people confidence to do more prescribed burns. Obviously, that's probably not that
[00:14:12] Stuart: use case it'll get deployed in the most. But from a prevention perspective, I think planned
[00:14:17] Stuart: fire is really important. Dave, do you remember that thing we got pitched a couple of years ago?
[00:14:22] Britt: It's like this house. Oh my god, this was amazing. It's like a house. You build your house in a whole
[00:14:28] Britt: new way where it can literally go underground within 10 minutes. It was like a hydraulic house
[00:14:35] Dave: holder thing. And you'd like build this incredible like giant hole under your house. And then the
[00:14:42] Dave: house would go and like a metal thing would close over the top of it was totally insane. They were
[00:14:46] Dave: pitching it for like real estate developers who were doing new housing developments so that they
[00:14:53] Britt: could bake it into the construction of course from the beginning. And then their business plan was
[00:14:59] Britt: to like go sell this to all the insurance companies who are dropping people left and right. Because
[00:15:04] Britt: these houses would definitely be like fire proof. This was after the paradise fire. And I think
[00:15:09] Dave: there was a lot of new house being built up near up in Northern California. And so there was I think
[00:15:16] Dave: maybe an opportunity, but it was a little bit overkill. So I started the company with the idea
[00:15:23] Stuart: that oh, so I lost my fire insurance on the fair plan. And which for those not in California,
[00:15:29] Stuart: if you lose your fire insurance through the traditional carriers, California has this thing called
[00:15:33] Stuart: the fair plan, which is an insurer of last resort. It's not like the world's most deluxe
[00:15:38] Stuart: insurance, but it's significantly better than nothing. And you cannot have a mortgage without
[00:15:42] Stuart: insurance. So we needed to be on the fair plan. So I was like this, this is totally irrational.
[00:15:47] Stuart: It's a broken market will go structured by structure. And when you talk to most of the chiefs and
[00:15:55] Stuart: fire scientists that doesn't matter federal, local, etc. level, they all will say that better
[00:16:00] Stuart: than going structured by structure is the idea of stopping the fire when it's small.
[00:16:05] Stuart: Even the best structural protection if your neighbor's house is burning down or the hillside
[00:16:11] Stuart: below you, I say this is I sit on like a very combustible hillside is on fire. I suppose if your
[00:16:16] Stuart: house is literally a bunker underground, fair enough, feels hard to retrofit the entire
[00:16:21] Stuart: community that way and is like kind of a dystopian vision of the future. But it's very hard to do
[00:16:26] Stuart: that and it's insanely not cost effective. But we know that fire grows exponentially. And so if
[00:16:33] Stuart: you can get to a fire in the first 10, 15, 20 minutes, and so the cost to put it out, the amount
[00:16:39] Stuart: of apparatus, the amount of suppression payload, you can actually take out a fire that's a couple
[00:16:44] Stuart: hundred square feet with much less apparatus than you think of for a mega fire because you get
[00:16:50] Stuart: there when it's small. To me, this is the key thing that when you were, you know, it's easy to
[00:16:54] Dave: I think dismiss what you're trying to do when you first hear it, right? Like it's easy to be like
[00:16:59] Dave: what? Like drones, you know, how are they going to carry enough of anything to put out a fire?
[00:17:05] Dave: Because most people think of forest fires as being forest size, right? That they're these like
[00:17:10] Dave: enormous things burning down entire neighborhoods, right? Like most of the fear driven imagery that
[00:17:18] Dave: the mainstream media fills your eyeballs with is that the whole of civic palisades is gone or like
[00:17:25] Dave: the entire town of paradise, right? And so your mind thinks how on earth could a small little drone
[00:17:31] Dave: actually affect this problem? And so I think that the thing that you just described is the key
[00:17:36] Dave: thing to understand here, which is that if we can detect these faster with technology and then deploy
[00:17:43] Dave: the right size of deterrent to the fire when it's tiny, then the fire never gets big in the first
[00:17:51] Dave: place. And that's actually I think a big breakthrough in the way that you're thinking about this.
[00:17:56] Dave: And you know, this has been thought about I think, but any really anytime before, right? Just like
[00:18:01] Dave: the scale of the technology being used was like entire fire crews or really large helicopters,
[00:18:08] Dave: entire fire engines or many fire engines, right? And so I think that's like a key thing to
[00:18:13] Dave: double down on here is just like your precision engineering take on this. Yeah, that's exactly
[00:18:19] Stuart: right. And it is, you know, we think about we in many contexts, we remind ourselves, okay,
[00:18:23] Stuart: the media exists to like get clicks and sell ads. And we forget that you probably when they're
[00:18:28] Stuart: covering fire, they're also doing the things to get clicks and sell ads, which in general
[00:18:34] pictures of big fires sell pictures of small fires kind of like don't, right? And so you have
[00:18:40] Stuart: this image in your head of a really big fire, but in practice, the goal of every agency going all
[00:18:45] Stuart: the way back to the smoke jumbers is to get there before it gets to that size. And the thing that's
[00:18:52] Stuart: changed over the last five years and really is that reason is if you look at sort of like everything
[00:18:59] Stuart: from detection all the way to response, the detection technology is getting better.
[00:19:03] Stuart: There's satellite, there's high and low altitude, long duration aircraft, there's sensors,
[00:19:08] Stuart: there's cameras, more people have cell phones, right? There's lots of ways that you can detect it.
[00:19:13] Stuart: Many of which are relatively capital efficient, but the fast response like fundamentally,
[00:19:18] Stuart: you do still need to carry hundreds of pounds to the area really quickly. And you need to do it
[00:19:23] Stuart: through the air because to definitely like there's traffic on roads and they wind up mountains
[00:19:28] Stuart: or whatever. So you have to do it through the air, but we're at this really interesting point
[00:19:32] Stuart: today where the combination of advanced manufacturing and 3D printing, like what we know to be
[00:19:39] Stuart: possible in the physics of autonomous and like unmanned aircraft, and the ability to use the incoming
[00:19:46] Stuart: data from cameras and other sensors and combined it with some of the, I don't like to use AI,
[00:19:50] Stuart: I think everything's like AI washed, but so I'll just say it with like transformer model technology
[00:19:55] Stuart: to allow you to effectively dispatch an aircraft in an autonomous fashion, so it doesn't need to be
[00:20:01] Stuart: truly piloted and it can say, okay, this is fire is an early stage fire. I want to take X action
[00:20:07] Stuart: versus this fire, which is a little bit later stage in which case I want to take a slightly
[00:20:10] Stuart: different action versus in this case, my job is to protect homes. And so really what I'm looking for
[00:20:16] Stuart: is an ember on the roof and being able to process those different, but all of that stuff really
[00:20:22] Stuart: came together in the last five years to make a piece of technology possible where you can be
[00:20:28] Stuart: much cheaper than today's existing apparatus, where you can legitimately get covers or our
[00:20:34] Stuart: aircraft come with 30 square miles, so you could cover a 30 square mile area in sub-attentiment
[00:20:40] Stuart: of response time with effectively a full engine's worth of suppression payload.
[00:20:45] Stuart: You're saying five drones can cover 30 square miles. So they always fly together, like sort of like
[00:20:51] Stuart: as one strike team for you know, firefighters listening, you know, if you ever hear sort of a
[00:20:56] Stuart: commander call in a strike team, that's going to be five engines plus one management vehicle.
[00:21:00] Stuart: But roughly five roughly five drones per 30 square mile radius. Exactly five drones. They always
[00:21:06] Stuart: stay together and they fly either in series or like in a team depending on what the
[00:21:11] Stuart: use case is they'll fly out, get to the fire, hopefully within five minutes or so of detection.
[00:21:16] Stuart: And so that should be more than enough payload to take out the fire modelings up to a top five
[00:21:20] Stuart: percent risk fire rate. There are fires that I don't want to say. It's not a perfect
[00:21:25] Stuart: nap problem. I mean, I can deal with everything. But there are a whole there are a ton of situations
[00:21:31] Stuart: where you're talking about self-cending fire, even paradise, there are a bunch of
[00:21:35] Stuart: reignitions, there were fires that were gotten. We didn't get there in the first five minutes,
[00:21:40] Stuart: right? Where you can make a real difference if you get there early. And they're built to load
[00:21:44] Stuart: and return from fire engines, so they go to the fire, deploy the sort of the full payload,
[00:21:48] Stuart: and then they can come back to any fire engine, any water tender, get refilled and fly back out
[00:21:54] Stuart: again. And so today there's very little night firefighting apparatus. Oh, that's fascinating.
[00:21:59] Dave: I hadn't even thought about that that the nighttime is just a dead zone, right? Like most of the,
[00:22:05] Dave: you know, when I think about my hometown and the fire bombers, right? Like we run one of the
[00:22:09] Dave: fire bombing airport in Helena, Montana has just constant fire bombers all summer long, right?
[00:22:15] Dave: But those guys aren't flying at night. Why aren't they flying at night? Pilots. They can't see
[00:22:19] Dave: the mountains. Oh, just invisibility. Yeah, it's too dangerous. The hardest higher
[00:22:24] Stuart: alleviation is a night vision trained helicopter pilot. Really? Yeah. Just to say again,
[00:22:32] Stuart: the way these pilots are flying these helicopters is literally in the cockpit with night vision
[00:22:35] Stuart: goggles. Yeah. It's totally insane. It's really insane. Yeah, it's just like, it's good,
[00:22:42] Stuart: crazy, super hero stuff. But also you can build an aircraft like Liner doesn't care,
[00:22:48] Stuart: a whole bunch of these sensors don't care if it's day or night, right? Right. That's what I'm thinking.
[00:22:52] Britt: And also you're flying high up and you can put a light. Anyway, there's a whole bunch of things
[00:22:57] Stuart: that make it much, much more practical for a autonomous aircraft to fly at night. But historically,
[00:23:06] Stuart: and Dave probably knows this, the most firefighting at night stops because humidity is
[00:23:13] Stuart: would increase and temperatures would decrease. And one of the things that's really happened,
[00:23:17] Stuart: if you look at temperature trends in the last 10, 20 years, is humidity at night, especially during
[00:23:24] Stuart: fire season is still pretty low. And so if you look, there was a fire in Napa a couple of months
[00:23:30] Stuart: ago now, that was about 5,000 acres. And the firefighting operations basically stopped at 730
[00:23:37] Stuart: or 8000. Maybe they didn't stop entirely, but most of them stopped. And the fire group from like
[00:23:42] Stuart: a thousand acres to a bit over 3000 acres overnight, right? And so, slower spread than during the day,
[00:23:50] Stuart: for sure. But nighttime spread is a thing in a way it never used to be. And so just the fire
[00:23:56] Stuart: agencies never built this good ability. So same thing we're seeing in factories, right? Like you don't
[00:24:02] Dave: need because of autonomy inside of factories, you don't need lights and factories anymore. And so
[00:24:07] there's like this new thing called a dark factory that is just like a literally dark indoor
[00:24:14] Dave: environment where robots are doing everything. Yeah. And then I last business, I think we're spending
[00:24:18] Stuart: like almost a million boxes a month at one point. And so we we tore it into much of the dark FCS.
[00:24:23] Stuart: But one of the things that's really interesting in fire, and I think we sort of assume that fire
[00:24:27] Stuart: is like police and more like defense in some ways. But think about the history of fire. There's
[00:24:33] Stuart: something like 20,000 fire departments across the country or something incredible number. Every town
[00:24:37] Stuart: had its own fire department. And the legacy of that means that there's a ton of independent
[00:24:43] Stuart: fire department. You sort of grew up and built their technology road maps independently. And you
[00:24:47] Stuart: contrast that to what's happened in national defense where you have DARPA, you have all of this
[00:24:52] Stuart: incredible not over time, right? A lot of the most important technologies have been built
[00:24:58] because of federal support for the military. And you've got like real training programs to take
[00:25:04] Stuart: military, like rising stars, get the engineering degrees, put them back in the military, build
[00:25:10] Stuart: adoption of advanced technology. None of that infrastructure exists to support the fire service.
[00:25:16] Stuart: And so it's really the situation where finally, I hope that private industry can come in and say
[00:25:21] Stuart: we can hand you, build a bunch of these tools with you, right? In a way that is only possible because
[00:25:28] Stuart: of how far technology around manufacturing, but so far we're talking about as advanced. But there's
[00:25:33] Stuart: really this incredible difference in the way technology got adopted in the fire service versus a
[00:25:38] Stuart: bunch of other government services that we think about. So what's the most challenging thing right now
[00:25:44] Britt: for you in this business? Is it the tech that you're building? Is it all the regulatory stuff and
[00:25:49] Britt: just this like long tail of fire stations and states and governments and all kinds of municipalities?
[00:25:55] Britt: What is the number one problem for you that exists today, Rosetta? I feel actually quite grateful
[00:26:02] Stuart: that we've had a good reception for regulators so far. I think the FAA currently seems to, I don't
[00:26:08] Stuart: know if it's the current administration or the fact that we have a very real public safety use case
[00:26:14] Stuart: have been good partners to us. I've been quite pleased and surprised and grateful by the number
[00:26:21] Stuart: of forward thinking chiefs that we've met in the fire service and the number of
[00:26:26] Stuart: private stakeholders from, we're working with a number of the sort of like
[00:26:32] Stuart: resort HOA plans communities that listeners of your show can probably think about in the American
[00:26:37] Stuart: West that are in Colorado or Montana or California where like Nevada is like whoa this place is
[00:26:45] Stuart: beautiful and also might burn down right and so we've gotten really really great reaction from a
[00:26:51] Stuart: lot of these folks and I think what feels different now versus five years ago is there's a real
[00:26:58] Stuart: sense of oh my god it could happen to me because the people in this terrible comment but
[00:27:04] Stuart: Paradise was a terrible fire but not particularly affluent and influential community
[00:27:09] Stuart: policy it super visible affluent and influential community and I think now people with resources
[00:27:14] Stuart: realize oh my god it could happen to me is the first thing I think the second thing is that
[00:27:19] Stuart: the insurance companies are basically say hey we can't ensure a whole big portion of the American West
[00:27:25] Stuart: and that's a very strong economic motivator for like five trillion of home assets that's at
[00:27:33] Stuart: high fire risk right now it's an insane number take both of those things are driving adoption
[00:27:37] Stuart: in a way that was never really true in the past there's a lot obviously happening with robotics
[00:27:43] Britt: and hardware and hardware is hard and and at the same time hardware not hard anymore this is the
[00:27:50] Dave: new revolution of AI robotics like where on the spectrum have you felt pushback or opportunity
[00:27:57] Britt: from like a venture capital lens has it been relatively easy and straightforward other than taking
[00:28:02] Britt: me in Dave's money and I guess Sam's money but like or or do you feel like you still have to
[00:28:07] Britt: explain to people why you need so much capital to accomplish such a big mission look right so I've
[00:28:13] Stuart: been around this game a little bit so when I was putting together the initial business plan the
[00:28:18] Stuart: business is built to be capital efficient early and then capital consumptively because that's also
[00:28:25] Stuart: a little bit of like what the venture capital model wants to consume you can get to prove
[00:28:29] Stuart: a concept on relatively relatively modest amount of capital and ultimately to scale out you
[00:28:36] Stuart: have the opportunity to I mean there's like I said trillions of dollars of home value at stake
[00:28:41] Stuart: and so the opportunity to build resilience infrastructure across the American West I can think of
[00:28:46] Stuart: the the value there is is incredible and the opportunity for impact is incredible and so I think
[00:28:51] Stuart: of that is you know I get I get like a viscerally excited about the idea of scaling this technology
[00:28:58] Stuart: across you know millions of acres in the allied world and for what it's worth if we don't do this we
[00:29:02] Stuart: have no chance of living in the American West and keeping our mortgages for like 25 30 years right it
[00:29:07] Stuart: has to happen so I get really excited about that it's interesting I view what we're doing as largely
[00:29:13] Stuart: uncorrelated we benefit from the AI events I view as this largely uncorrelated from that because it's
[00:29:19] Stuart: sort of is it's whether or not we all get like AI assistance that do our dishes and brush our
[00:29:26] Stuart: hair and like do my kids math homework definitely we need our houses not to burn down right like like
[00:29:31] Stuart: one of those things is optional one of those things is like totally fucking not optional and so for me
[00:29:39] Stuart: I've been really lucky to have really great capital partners over my career and many of our
[00:29:43] Stuart: investors from my last business are investors in this business and also like among my closest friends
[00:29:48] Stuart: right I love working with really good capital partners and you know it doesn't have to be for
[00:29:53] Stuart: everyone and so we've been lucky to have people who I think believe that over the next couple of
[00:29:59] Stuart: decades a this is a problem that like 100.0% has to get self almost no cost is too high to make
[00:30:06] Stuart: sure that we can continue to live in the American West and also it is totally fed accomplished
[00:30:12] Stuart: that either American gives up its sovereignty or we get good at manufacturing again and
[00:30:18] Stuart: however that happens I think it's we feel the tailwinds of that a bunch of ways but I also think that
[00:30:25] Stuart: we want to be careful about picking partners who get that given that probably not every single
[00:30:31] Stuart: dollar that's gone into every part of the AI ecosystem will be able to yield the type of return that
[00:30:36] Stuart: you know some folks have seen over the last few years it might be an up and down road right in terms
[00:30:41] Stuart: of like capital availability and valuations and for us you know we I was a dinner the other night
[00:30:46] Stuart: I said I want to build a company where our enterprise value like our multiple right that's used to
[00:30:51] Stuart: determine our enterprise value is highest in year 20 right because that last like five years of
[00:30:56] Stuart: compounding is actually the most valuable and so we really do think about okay these are long-term
[00:31:01] Stuart: trends in reindustrialization robotics like what are the most important technologies in the world
[00:31:07] Stuart: of the next 20 years and what are the like hopefully right the most important to humanity and
[00:31:14] Stuart: most value of creative to our shareholders applications of that will overlap so anyway I totally
[00:31:21] Stuart: believe we're in these trends are they overhyped in the moment I try to build in a way that whether or
[00:31:28] Stuart: not they are overhyped the business will still achieve its long-term goal and what advice would
[00:31:33] Britt: you give for a new founder who wanted to start something in the deep tack or robotic space do you
[00:31:41] think this is the time to do it or would you say it feels oversaturated I feel I feel like what
[00:31:46] Britt: you just said is that you don't you don't actually assume that you're in the robotics in AI space
[00:31:51] Britt: this was this is sort of orthogonal to that in some ways but you you you're building you know
[00:31:57] Britt: hardware you're building software there's you know a lot of capital flowing in right now for
[00:32:04] Britt: this category is that a good thing or bad thing if if there was a person starting from ground zero
[00:32:10] Britt: who wanted to dive deep into this yeah so I think it was as playing in that space I just don't
[00:32:15] Stuart: view our end markets as being driven by the hype around those things right of your end market as
[00:32:22] Stuart: being perhaps a little bit slower adoption although doesn't feel like that right now why because
[00:32:27] Stuart: every is every municipality like Seneca we teach you like are you is that the type that type of
[00:32:32] Britt: demand you're getting right now I would just say that we've been surprised to the upside by
[00:32:37] Stuart: demand from municipalities from utilities from the zill like HOA developer communities people
[00:32:43] Stuart: people on timber farms you know you're inbound from a rancher in Montana actually the other day
[00:32:48] Stuart: that was just like this is amazing I need this and so do all of my neighbors I'm happy to be your
[00:32:53] Stuart: first customer how do I get like it's like I mean who gets email like that's a good forks great
[00:32:59] Stuart: yeah I mean it makes me wonder like I guess the thing that I've been thinking the last few minutes
[00:33:05] Dave: is how fast are we moving here I mean next season how many strike teams do you have deployed like
[00:33:13] Dave: if you look out I don't know five years do you you know is the insurance market in the west
[00:33:20] or the actual real tables changing you know like what speed do you think we're moving here
[00:33:25] Dave: I think a lot of it depends on capital availability and I think when you look at how I'm going to
[00:33:28] Stuart: give a really high level comment right what allows the US to beat some of the more industrialized
[00:33:34] Stuart: like that are manufacturing nations over the next 10 years our capital markets are the best in the
[00:33:38] Stuart: world right does our industrial capacity match engine no chance but our capital markets are incredible
[00:33:45] Stuart: and so when I think about the opportunity to scale up technology I think you know would I advise
[00:33:51] Stuart: someone to build in robotics and I know yes as long as you have a long-term end market right
[00:33:57] Stuart: because I think that if capital continues to flow then the opportunity to scale something like
[00:34:03] Stuart: this up I mean I will have certainly dozens of aircraft hopefully hundreds next year but within
[00:34:11] Stuart: five years oh yeah man we don't sleep baby that's amazing but I mean yeah it's a big deal every year
[00:34:18] Stuart: it's like every month I just like a real risk right I like to feel it every day just thinking
[00:34:23] Stuart: it actually as I was driving home from driving I get off at school today it's like looking up at
[00:34:28] Stuart: the health time it's not particularly high fire is today but I was thinking about the like length
[00:34:32] of the fuels oh man anyway so yeah I think we got to go we got to go and we got to go super super fast
[00:34:39] Stuart: but I think it's a great time to be in it because I think that the zeitgeist around technology
[00:34:44] Stuart: adoption is really strong so I mean you're saying there could be there could be hundreds hundreds of
[00:34:49] Dave: drones how many strike teams is that 50 no how many did you say that would be 20 strike teams next year
[00:34:57] Dave: 200 the year after 2000 the year after I mean are we moving at that speed
[00:35:03] geez I feel like I'm in a in a in a department meeting here
[00:35:07] the people want to know I mean I think everyone listening it's like how how fast am I going to feel
[00:35:12] Dave: my feel my anxiety come down you know well they want to know like are you starting with Aspen but
[00:35:17] Britt: then you're going to get to paradise like in 10 years five you know I think everyone's curious
[00:35:22] Britt: about the ranking structure too so we try to work with agencies that are already really really
[00:35:28] Stuart: good at using drones right like we want to work with the most demanding people in the country
[00:35:34] Stuart: and Aspen and San Bernardino are two wonderful development partners who I think are
[00:35:39] Stuart: incredibly frontline oriented you go and talk to the pilots at these places and they're like
[00:35:44] yeah it's like these people are I live it in the future yeah I mean San Bernardino is what
[00:35:49] Dave: covers a lot of soCal like what's the over 20,000 square miles is the largest counting
[00:35:56] Stuart: entry and the folks there you know the average income in San Bernardino is not that high yeah no
[00:36:01] Dave: this is like a real massive you know metro area massive and chief Muncie there who's a great
[00:36:08] Stuart: friend of ours is super visionary his vision is we want to stop 90 percent of fires with
[00:36:13] Stuart: a hundred square feet the traditional metric has been 10 acres that's amazing I'm hopeful that
[00:36:18] Dave: we'll get deployed across you know a couple of places in southern California hopefully a couple
[00:36:22] Stuart: of places where we can test the aircraft at altitude but you know how many aircraft will we have
[00:36:27] Stuart: next year flying and a hundred would be on the upper end because we whatever we fly in 26 will be
[00:36:32] Stuart: worse than what we fly in 27 which will be worse than what we fly in 28 right and so by the time
[00:36:38] Stuart: we're making a thousand aircraft a year it's going to be much harder to make changes and so I
[00:36:44] Stuart: really look at we're gonna we're gonna deploy amazing products in 26 and 27 but the goal like I
[00:36:50] Stuart: said is to build the most valuable business over the next 20 years and so the challenge is how do you
[00:36:54] Stuart: make a product that's good enough in 26 that people will line up and buy it now and also not make so
[00:37:01] Stuart: many of them that you know you can deploy something better in 27 and by the time you're manufacturing
[00:37:06] Stuart: thousand in 28 the product is like is so nails that that it's it's it feels like an i-found to
[00:37:14] Stuart: everyone who uses it and we've really built for that like user experience already but
[00:37:19] Stuart: the no product that yes arrives first contact with the customer and so you got to get it in
[00:37:23] Stuart: their hands and you know watch watch these people use it in like critical life or death situations
[00:37:29] Stuart: before you really know. Stuart I know we we have to come to a close soon so I'm curious just a
[00:37:34] Britt: couple of last questions Dave you can think of your last one and I'll do mine but we have this
[00:37:39] Britt: really interesting audience listening to more or less a lot of people are insiders in Silicon
[00:37:46] Britt: Valley and beyond there are a lot of really smart people there are a lot of capital investors there
[00:37:52] Britt: are a lot of founders if you could ask for help for anything what would you ask for at this point
[00:38:01] Britt: to this type of audience that's tuning in today. I think people are the number one thing that
[00:38:07] Stuart: drives success of companies I'll just say it's we're lucky to have an amazing team it's probably 80
[00:38:12] Stuart: percent engineers today and I think the quality of the team will determine the speed at which we
[00:38:18] Stuart: can roll out and so yeah the senategood.com backslash careers that's probably the the number one thing
[00:38:25] Stuart: the second thing I would say is you know I think it's it's nice to nudge your public safety
[00:38:31] Stuart: partners to say hey you know the future is now when it comes to technology because
[00:38:35] Stuart: these folks really do the community orientation from fire agencies is amazing and so just that
[00:38:41] Stuart: nudge and hey you should look at this that can matter if you live in an HOA or in one of these
[00:38:46] Stuart: developments oftentimes the person doing in charge of safety you know they may not know whether or
[00:38:52] Stuart: not they want the residents want them to embrace technology so I think you know I really do think
[00:38:59] Stuart: of fire as a team sport and so you know the extent to which we we all do our part to influence
[00:39:05] Stuart: stakeholders the quicker we'll see this adopted and we are all safer when our neighbors home is safe
[00:39:12] Stuart: too so it's it's really a wonderful thing like the people who donate these systems I should say
[00:39:17] Stuart: these strike teams better marketing you know they're not just keeping their own home safe they're
[00:39:21] Stuart: keeping their community safe what's the cultural DNA that you're trying to build in your team you
[00:39:26] Dave: know you could go a lot of different ways you could go military firehouse startup garage like what's
[00:39:32] Dave: the what's the cultural DNA and this sort of values that you think about as a team so the company's
[00:39:38] name Seneca was my favorite stoic philosopher and if you like drive into our office or up to our
[00:39:45] Stuart: test range with 100 acres in Sonoma in like really big letters on the wall it says
[00:39:52] Stuart: forks and falls heavily on those for whom she's unexpected the one on the lookout always in
[00:39:56] Stuart: doors and I think there's a wonderful stoic philosophy which actually sometimes true he didn't
[00:40:02] Stuart: mecha called Amar Fati which is like you must love fake you must love your fate and I think we
[00:40:08] Stuart: as a company look at the inevitability of fire risk and the need for resilience technology
[00:40:16] Stuart: and it's it's true like we absolutely need it you saw what happened in Palsett and like it cannot
[00:40:21] Stuart: happen again and so I think we look at that and say how do we love the world that we have how do
[00:40:27] Stuart: we love the hand that we've been dealt and that mentality allows us to test and learn really
[00:40:33] Stuart: aggressively like I will never forget our first crash league big video team there like do everything
[00:40:38] Stuart: this was months and months ago but like and oh my god we have this beautiful aircraft and first
[00:40:43] Stuart: fucking glad of the day just flames right and oh my gosh was that the best thing that ever happened
[00:40:49] Stuart: because we've gotten so much better reliable we basically been revenge building a hundred hours a
[00:40:53] Stuart: week so I think the mentality really is one of we're in it for the long term and also this is
[00:41:00] Stuart: an extremely urgent problem and so we feel really lucky to be building in this space I will say
[00:41:07] Stuart: you know I think it's a it's a very hardcore culture but also one that's like a very fun place to
[00:41:13] Stuart: work and recognize that you can both live extremely well and work extremely hard so that's the
[00:41:19] Stuart: that's the culture that we're trying to build love it it's awesome Stuart congratulations on everything
[00:41:24] Britt: you've done so far I feel like you know you've made so much progress and yet you're still at the
[00:41:28] Britt: beginning but there's no way that this technology isn't going to exist and isn't going to save
