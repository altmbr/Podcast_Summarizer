[00:00:00] We should go around and do our vote of who gets the assets,
[00:00:03] Jessica Lessin: the Netflix or Paramount.
[00:00:04] Jessica Lessin: I just think these people are all so, they're so sad.
[00:00:07] Brit Morin: They haven't been in a media, a new cycle in a while.
[00:00:09] Brit Morin: It's all been Trump or AI.
[00:00:10] Brit Morin: They're like, we need a new cycle.
[00:00:12] Brit Morin: Like, we need to be like relevant.
[00:00:13] Brit Morin: David Ellison has been in the news.
[00:00:15] Dave Morin: It's like, well, David Ellison is the sion of Oracle.
[00:00:19] Dave Morin: I see some irony here.
[00:00:21] Dave Morin: Yeah, he's jealous of his dad.
[00:00:30] Sam Lessin: Yeah, I'm here.

[00:01:06] Brit Morin: How's everyone doing?
[00:01:07] Brit Morin: How's everyone holding up?

[00:01:11] Dave Morin: That would be me.
[00:01:12] Dave Morin: Our household has flu symptoms.
[00:01:13] Dave Morin: David, are you waiting for it?

[00:01:15] Dave Morin: We're waiting for it.
[00:01:16] Dave Morin: We're waiting for it.
[00:01:17] Dave Morin: We're waiting for it.
[00:01:18] Dave Morin: We're waiting for it.
[00:01:19] Jessica Lessin: We're waiting for it.
[00:01:20] Jessica Lessin: We're waiting for it.
[00:01:21] Jessica Lessin: We're waiting for it.
[00:01:22] Jessica Lessin: We're waiting for it.
[00:01:23] Jessica Lessin: We're waiting for it to hit us.
[00:01:24] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, I don't have it yet.
[00:01:25] Unknown Host: But the offline holiday parties tomorrow and you can't be sick.
[00:01:29] Jessica Lessin: You'd be fine.
[00:01:30] Brit Morin: Just pound emergency.
[00:01:31] Brit Morin: I was running a call last week, but the key is just like, you know, like, like as much emergency
[00:01:37] Brit Morin: as your body can handle and you'll be blown right through it.
[00:01:39] Brit Morin: Have you guys seen those nasal sprays that actually prevent you from inhaling all of the bad germs and things like COVID?
[00:01:47] Jessica Lessin: Actually, Alex Roche sent out an email about this.
[00:01:50] Jessica Lessin: Does this actually work?
[00:01:51] Brit Morin: Wait, tell me more.
[00:01:52] Jessica Lessin: Now, you know about this, Jess, we have a mutual friend who was very into this drink COVID.
[00:01:56] Sorry.
[00:01:57] Dave Morin: What is it?
[00:01:58] A nasal spray to stop you from getting COVID.
[00:02:01] Brit Morin: You don't remember this whole series?
[00:02:03] Brit Morin: Oh, yeah.
[00:02:04] Dave Morin: That's old news.
[00:02:05] Dave Morin: That is old news.
[00:02:06] Jessica Lessin: Wait, are we not into this?
[00:02:07] Jessica Lessin: Does it not work?
[00:02:08] Jessica Lessin: Wait, I have it right here.
[00:02:10] Jessica Lessin: It's called Profe.
[00:02:12] Jessica Lessin: Profile.
[00:02:13] Jessica Lessin: PR-O-F-I.
[00:02:14] Jessica Lessin: More or less.
[00:02:16] Unknown Host: Brought to you by Profile.
[00:02:17] Unknown Host: Helps block and remove airborne contaminants.
[00:02:20] Jessica Lessin: Airborne contaminants for up to eight hours.
[00:02:22] Jessica Lessin: Guys, I'm shooting up right now.
[00:02:23] Jessica Lessin: I'm not getting sick.
[00:02:24] Jessica Lessin: I got 24 hours ago.
[00:02:26] Jessica Lessin: Let's prevent it.
[00:02:27] Jessica Lessin: This is preventative.
[00:02:28] Jessica Lessin: You're supposed to take it like when you get on the airplane and when you're around six people.
[00:02:33] Jessica Lessin: You know what that is, Brid?
[00:02:34] Brit Morin: That's subsidized by the Colombians.
[00:02:35] Brit Morin: They want you to get used to sticking things up your nose.
[00:02:38] That's not funny, actually.
[00:02:40] Jessica Lessin: One of our LPs told me about this.
[00:02:42] Jessica Lessin: I'm trusting them to tell me that it's real.
[00:02:44] Jessica Lessin: It's a loss leader for using a different set of holes in your face.
[00:02:47] Brit Morin: I'm going to do a double spray, actually, just to be safe.
[00:02:50] Jessica Lessin: Exactly.
[00:02:51] Sam, none of those drugs are getting to America anymore.
[00:02:54] Unknown Host: I mean, if they start blowing up boats carrying that shit, you know, like that'd be pretty funny.
[00:02:59] Brit Morin: Isn't that what they are blowing up to boats carrying the nasal spray?
[00:03:04] Brit Morin: No.
[00:03:05] Dave Morin: Oh my God.
[00:03:06] Dave Morin: Do we have to talk about blown up boats?
[00:03:07] Dave Morin: Let's not.
[00:03:08] Dave Morin: Let's not.
[00:03:09] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:03:10] So everyone gets their health tip of the week.
[00:03:12] Dave Morin: Brits is that.
[00:03:13] Dave Morin: Everything has failed me this time.
[00:03:15] Dave Morin: The emergency, the electrolytes, the zinc, the red light, everything's failed me.
[00:03:21] Dave Morin: So I have nothing.
[00:03:22] Dave Morin: Those are my go-to's.
[00:03:23] Dave Morin: What about sauna?
[00:03:24] Brit Morin: The sauna dehydrates me.
[00:03:27] Dave Morin: I've saunaed twice today already.
[00:03:29] I'd like the record to show it is solidly midday.
[00:03:34] Dave Morin: It is solidly midday at the taping of this podcast.
[00:03:39] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:03:40] Dave Morin: So consider that.
[00:03:41] Brit Morin: So hot tubbed and cold plunged and worked out and red light therapy.
[00:03:44] Jessica Lessin: No, I've had a time for red light.
[00:03:46] Brit Morin: Probably red light as you can't really do conference calls while you do that.
[00:03:49] Brit Morin: No, because you're supposed to be naked.
[00:03:51] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, audio only.
[00:03:52] You're really real careful with that.
[00:03:54] Brit Morin: Do not turn on the camera button.
[00:03:57] Brit Morin: Yeah, that's a, that's an HR lawsuit waiting to happen for people like me.
[00:04:01] Brit Morin: What I really want is in the release a version of zoom with like no camera.
[00:04:05] Brit Morin: Because it's so fucking dangerous, right?
[00:04:07] Brit Morin: Like I'm like terrified of like the hot tub, you know, turn on camera button.
[00:04:13] Brit Morin: You're one of few people who has this concern.
[00:04:16] Jessica Lessin: It's like the platinum edition of zoom just has no camera.
[00:04:20] Brit Morin: Because it's like you can't as too dangerous.
[00:04:23] Guys, I was, we were at a hotel this weekend and I was on the treadmill.
[00:04:27] Jessica Lessin: And there was a guy on the treadmill next to me who was on a video chat with someone.
[00:04:31] Jessica Lessin: And this woman was naked.
[00:04:33] Jessica Lessin: She was full naked like I saw.
[00:04:35] Jessica Lessin: What?
[00:04:36] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:04:37] Jessica Lessin: And he's on the treadmill next to me, just casually talking to her.
[00:04:40] Jessica Lessin: And she's just, I'm not going to lie.
[00:04:42] Brit Morin: That's amazing.
[00:04:43] Brit Morin: She wasn't sexually naked.
[00:04:44] Jessica Lessin: She wasn't doing like sexual things, but she was just like, how do you know?
[00:04:48] Because I was looking at it while I was running on the treadmill.
[00:04:51] Brit Morin: Maybe he has a fetish for that stuff.
[00:04:53] Brit Morin: It's just like, yeah.
[00:04:54] Brit Morin: That's wild.
[00:04:55] Brit Morin: What is going on?
[00:04:58] He wasn't even hiding it.
[00:04:59] Jessica Lessin: He put it in the phone holder on the treadmill.
[00:05:01] Jessica Lessin: It was interesting.
[00:05:03] Jessica Lessin: Anyway, but we were in Vegas.
[00:05:05] Jessica Lessin: So maybe that was, I don't know, maybe there's some tie there.
[00:05:09] Jessica Lessin: I don't know really what was happening.
[00:05:11] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:05:12] Dave Morin: Any other health tips, health corner.
[00:05:13] Dave Morin: We got it.
[00:05:14] Dave Morin: I got to tell her we're talking about Netflix Paramount, Warner Brothers, guys.
[00:05:18] Dave Morin: We're this tech podcast.
[00:05:19] Dave Morin: I'm pulling you over to the media side.
[00:05:22] Dave Morin: We have media people here.
[00:05:23] Dave Morin: Yeah, we talk media.
[00:05:25] I'm happy to bullshit about anything.
[00:05:28] Brit Morin: No knowledge required.
[00:05:29] Brit Morin: What are these things?
[00:05:30] Brit Morin: Let's talk about it.
[00:05:31] Brit Morin: Okay.
[00:05:32] Dave Morin: No one's got more health.
[00:05:33] Dave Morin: That's fine.
[00:05:34] Dave Morin: We'll all just survive.
[00:05:35] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:05:36] Dave Morin: So as of an hour ago, Polymarket put the odds that either Netflix buys Warner Brothers, home
[00:05:45] Dave Morin: to HBO, among other things, or that Paramount with David Ellison buys it, each at 48% according
[00:05:53] Dave Morin: to Polymarket.
[00:05:54] Dave Morin: So I think everyone probably knows Warner Brothers has been for sale for some time, all
[00:06:00] Dave Morin: or pieces of it.
[00:06:01] Dave Morin: There's a difference whether CNN plus some other stuff goes Netflix.
[00:06:05] Dave Morin: Does anyone want CNN?
[00:06:07] Brit Morin: No one wants CNN.
[00:06:09] Who wants CNN?
[00:06:11] Brit Morin: CNN is free.
[00:06:12] Brit Morin: You have to like pay someone to take a CNN.
[00:06:14] Dave Morin: Well, if you're David Ellison and you think that the idea of you controlling CNN will be
[00:06:19] Dave Morin: something that the Trump administration will look favorably on, maybe you do want CNN.
[00:06:25] Dave Morin: But basically, the quick recap here is Netflix made a move some $80 billion bid, which is
[00:06:30] Dave Morin: kind of wilder and crazy.
[00:06:33] Ellison countered having recently bought CBS with an even bigger bid for the whole company.
[00:06:40] Dave Morin: But then there was a little bit of a backlash.
[00:06:42] Dave Morin: And the idea that Paramount is so cozy with the Trump administration, Jared Kushner was
[00:06:48] Dave Morin: one of the backers of the Paramount bid.
[00:06:52] Dave Morin: And now there's a little bit of a backlash.
[00:06:54] Dave Morin: And so now we're kind of an even odds according to the pie market.
[00:06:57] Dave Morin: Well, the backlash was against Paramount.
[00:07:00] Dave Morin: So the thinking was that this would be Ellison's to lose because the Trump administration
[00:07:04] Dave Morin: would be friendly to it.
[00:07:05] Dave Morin: It's more money, yada yada.
[00:07:08] But Netflix isn't really back and down.
[00:07:11] Dave Morin: And I think Paramount probably still ends up with it.
[00:07:14] Dave Morin: It would be my bet at this point, but but it's pretty.
[00:07:16] Dave Morin: You think Paramount's going to end up with it.
[00:07:18] Brit Morin: Well, but it's pretty close.
[00:07:20] Dave Morin: It's pretty close.
[00:07:21] Brit Morin: This is big.
[00:07:22] Brit Morin: Is it down like 20% in the last month?
[00:07:24] Brit Morin: Is it just like how much of the cost of this deal is just the driving people to Netflix
[00:07:29] Brit Morin: stock price?
[00:07:30] Dave Morin: Well, Netflix shareholders are not happy about this.
[00:07:34] Well, because Netflix, it's like what?
[00:07:36] Unknown Host: It's 20%.
[00:07:37] Unknown Host: It's like 20% of their market cap.
[00:07:41] It's buying a content library, not necessarily revenue.
[00:07:45] Jessica Lessin: It's just math.
[00:07:46] Brit Morin: You're going to make the revenue grow less, hopefully.
[00:07:49] If you're valued on revenue growth and you buy a legacy media asset, it's going to
[00:07:52] Brit Morin: like fuck your growth rate number top line.
[00:07:55] Brit Morin: A, the signalling is not great.
[00:07:57] Dave Morin: The we need dying Hollywood studio to keep growing from the young buck innovator.
[00:08:03] Dave Morin: These are the stereotypes.
[00:08:04] Dave Morin: Isn't that a great one?
[00:08:05] Dave Morin: It'd be clear.
[00:08:06] Brit Morin: HBO is pretty awesome.
[00:08:07] Brit Morin: It's great content.
[00:08:08] Brit Morin: It doesn't make good money.
[00:08:09] Brit Morin: It doesn't make money.
[00:08:10] Brit Morin: Just the fact that they have friends matters to me.
[00:08:14] Dave Morin: Shareholders aren't happy because Netflix buying this would be a protracted legal battle
[00:08:19] Dave Morin: that would distract them as well.
[00:08:21] Dave Morin: Well, but on the flip side, it would distract Paramount more and they can't do shit during
[00:08:25] Brit Morin: it.
[00:08:26] Brit Morin: So it doesn't actually help Netflix get ahead.
[00:08:28] Brit Morin: I guess Netflix only bit 70 billion.
[00:08:30] Brit Morin: Oh, just 70.
[00:08:31] Brit Morin: Well, but isn't part of this also that Netflix, everyone says if Netflix acquires them, it's
[00:08:38] Jessica Lessin: also kind of the end of theatrical releases.
[00:08:41] Jessica Lessin: And Netflix is trying to dispute this.
[00:08:43] Jessica Lessin: They know, of course, we'll put things in theaters.
[00:08:45] Jessica Lessin: The theatrical releases ended.
[00:08:47] Jessica Lessin: No, they've totally come back.
[00:08:50] Come back, please, Bruce.
[00:08:51] Brit Morin: Come back.
[00:08:52] Dave Morin: I don't even have to Gemini the answer from the pandemic.
[00:08:56] Jessica Lessin: Guys, there are films grossing hundreds of millions in revenue.
[00:09:00] Jessica Lessin: There are films that are doing well in theaters.
[00:09:03] Jessica Lessin: Well, Paramount's media statement.
[00:09:07] Jessica Lessin: Remember, Britt tickets cost $100 a pop.
[00:09:09] Brit Morin: So like 12 people went to that.
[00:09:11] Brit Morin: Kind of a for adults, but you got to get like the senior discount.
[00:09:15] Jessica Lessin: So Paramount's state making a statement that they should get to own Warner Brothers because
[00:09:20] Jessica Lessin: they will reserve the rights to continue to release the movies and theaters and Netflix
[00:09:25] Jessica Lessin: won't.
[00:09:26] Jessica Lessin: And it's like one of their big sticking points in this battle.
[00:09:29] Jessica Lessin: Who's sticking point?
[00:09:30] Brit Morin: That's not going to fly with anyone.
[00:09:32] Brit Morin: This is like America's love affair with cars and movie theaters is over guys like owning
[00:09:37] Brit Morin: cars.
[00:09:38] Brit Morin: Like we're just past that.
[00:09:39] Brit Morin: We're calling cars.
[00:09:40] Jessica Lessin: I don't know.
[00:09:41] Brit Morin: But it's hard to a movie theater era.
[00:09:43] I think the immersive group experience is going to last and endure.
[00:09:47] Jessica Lessin: It might not be at the same level once but every movie theater I've gone to in the past
[00:09:50] Dave Morin: 12 months, I have been one of four people in.
[00:09:53] What movie theater are you going to?
[00:09:54] Brit Morin: Yeah, what you're going to bad movies, Jess?
[00:09:56] Jessica Lessin: Clearly.
[00:09:57] And one of the other four is me.
[00:09:59] Yeah, no, Sam, would we go to like San Mateo to see something?
[00:10:03] Dave Morin: We did go to one movie in New York.
[00:10:05] Brit Morin: We went to Superman New York.
[00:10:06] Brit Morin: There was like a half the theater was full.
[00:10:08] Brit Morin: We go to the big movies on opening day and they're full.
[00:10:11] Jessica Lessin: To me, here's the interesting story.
[00:10:14] One of the greatest deals in history was AOL Time Warner for AOL shareholders.
[00:10:19] Brit Morin: I was going to say define great.
[00:10:22] Brit Morin: Incredible deal.
[00:10:23] Brit Morin: The AOL stock had run up to Jesus dollars, right?
[00:10:26] Brit Morin: They turned around and said this number is a made up number.
[00:10:29] Brit Morin: But you know, we can do this.
[00:10:30] Brit Morin: We can go buy Time Warner.
[00:10:32] Brit Morin: And they turned around and bought a super real company that was like a good company at
[00:10:35] Brit Morin: the time, right?
[00:10:36] Brit Morin: For nothing on a relative basis.
[00:10:38] Brit Morin: And about a Bing, about a boom, great deal.
[00:10:40] Brit Morin: I mean, it was one of the worst deal in history for the Time Warner people.
[00:10:43] Brit Morin: It was a great deal for AOL.
[00:10:45] Brit Morin: I think this is kind of an interesting like echo boom to that, right?
[00:10:48] Brit Morin: Well, now we have the opposite, right?
[00:10:50] Brit Morin: Which is instead of the fake currency company buying the real legacy asset.
[00:10:55] Brit Morin: Now we have the real value modern digital company that actually is a good company, Netflix,
[00:11:01] Brit Morin: buying the fictitious value of a legacy media library, etc for inflated price.
[00:11:07] Brit Morin: So I think, look, if you're on the HBO side of this, you're selling God bless.
[00:11:11] Brit Morin: You should sell, right?
[00:11:12] Brit Morin: Like, I think that'll look like no question, but it's just an interesting thing where
[00:11:16] Brit Morin: it's kind of, I look at this as an inverse AOL Time Warner.
[00:11:19] Brit Morin: Yes.
[00:11:20] Dave Morin: I think that's right.
[00:11:21] Dave Morin: So what do you think will happen?
[00:11:22] Brit Morin: Nothing.
[00:11:23] Brit Morin: It's going to be like two years of legal fights and Hollywood loves to talk and they love
[00:11:25] Brit Morin: this fight.
[00:11:26] Brit Morin: Like this is, I think Hollywood's biggest thing in general, all these people love attention.
[00:11:31] Brit Morin: And so because they just love attention, they're just going to like more bids will come in.
[00:11:35] Brit Morin: They'll be more kerfuffle just so they can see their names in print in like the Hollywood
[00:11:39] Brit Morin: reporter or something for the next three years of arguing and nothing will happen.
[00:11:43] And you know, maybe HBO changes logo four more times before anything happens.
[00:11:48] It's logo or it's name.
[00:11:49] Jessica Lessin: We should go around and do our vote of who gets the assets, Netflix or Paramount.
[00:11:55] Jessica Lessin: I think it's someone, someone else.
[00:11:58] Brit Morin: It's polymarket.
[00:11:59] Jessica Lessin: You can throw in a TikTok.
[00:12:01] Dave Morin: You can throw in a polymarket.
[00:12:03] Dave Morin: Wait, you think it's neither of them?
[00:12:04] Dave Morin: No, no.
[00:12:05] Dave Morin: I think Paramount probably wins it in the eye.
[00:12:07] Dave Morin: I just think these people are all so they're so sad they haven't been in a medium news cycle
[00:12:11] Brit Morin: in a while.
[00:12:12] Brit Morin: It's all been Trump or AI.
[00:12:13] Brit Morin: They're like, we need a news cycle.
[00:12:15] Brit Morin: Like we need to be like relevant to be fair.
[00:12:17] Brit Morin: David Ellison.
[00:12:18] Dave Morin: So a couple of points.
[00:12:19] Dave Morin: David Ellison has been in the news.
[00:12:22] Dave Morin: So David Ellison is the cyan of Oracle, which is the leader, a leader in the
[00:12:28] Dave Morin: AI boom.
[00:12:31] So I see some irony here.
[00:12:33] Dave Morin: Yeah, he's jealous of his dad.
[00:12:35] Brit Morin: I see some irony here.
[00:12:37] Dave Morin: Look, can they still afford it after Oracle sell off?
[00:12:41] Brit Morin: Yes, because it's all coming from the Middle East.
[00:12:44] Jessica Lessin: Jared Kushner.
[00:12:45] Jessica Lessin: Oh, Kushner's backstopping it.
[00:12:47] Brit Morin: It's Kushner in the Middle East.
[00:12:48] Brit Morin: Those are the people buying HBO and Warner Brothers.
[00:12:51] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, which we don't want the Chinese to have TikTok, although we actually seem to not
[00:12:55] Dave Morin: really care about that.
[00:12:56] Dave Morin: It turns out, but we don't want the Middle East to have CNN.
[00:13:00] Dave Morin: It's like, what do we do?
[00:13:01] Dave Morin: Do we care about anything anymore?
[00:13:03] Brit Morin: I don't think we care about anything.
[00:13:06] From what I understand, the KSA strategy here is to run the Japan the 80s K-pop in the
[00:13:14] Unknown Host: 90s 2000s strategy and to try to establish itself as a media powerhouse over the next
[00:13:21] Unknown Host: decade.
[00:13:22] Unknown Host: If the group that wants it most wins, it's probably the Paramount consortium, the most
[00:13:28] Unknown Host: committed wins.
[00:13:29] Unknown Host: Yeah, they're probably the most committed.
[00:13:32] Unknown Host: It's like a nice thing to have for Netflix, but they don't need it.
[00:13:35] Unknown Host: How are they going to leverage the distribution of this media then to infiltrate American
[00:13:40] Jessica Lessin: brains to the Middle East?
[00:13:42] Jessica Lessin: No, no.
[00:13:43] Unknown Host: It has nothing to do with infiltration or anything.
[00:13:44] Unknown Host: It's about building the brand of the KSA world.
[00:13:49] Unknown Host: They're trying to build an actual new media powerhouse.
[00:13:53] Unknown Host: It has nothing to do with the actual content as to do with actually having a studio.
[00:13:58] Unknown Host: When did everyone start calling them KSA, Dave?
[00:14:01] Dave Morin: When did this, this is the new thing?
[00:14:02] Dave Morin: Is this what you, I know what it stands for, but is this what you VCs call it?
[00:14:08] Dave Morin: I didn't.
[00:14:09] Brit Morin: I thought it was a pop band.
[00:14:10] Brit Morin: Is it trying to rebrand?
[00:14:13] Dave Morin: Is like PIF out in KSA?
[00:14:15] Dave Morin: Is it KSA since like KYC?
[00:14:17] Dave Morin: Well, what else do you call them?
[00:14:18] Dave Morin: It's just like the DOE.
[00:14:20] Brit Morin: Every time there's a scandal, you just rename it and people don't even know what it is.
[00:14:23] Brit Morin: Depends on which trade route you're talking upon.
[00:14:26] Brit Morin: Lot of trade routes.
[00:14:27] Brit Morin: Look, here's the thing.
[00:14:28] Brit Morin: Do you guys watch the South Park about the sponsoring of the South Park 5K for the
[00:14:33] Brit Morin: tricky shot?
[00:14:34] Brit Morin: No, that's great.
[00:14:37] The Kingdom sponsor, the South Park tricky shot 5K.
[00:14:41] Brit Morin: Just the greatest social commentary.
[00:14:42] Brit Morin: That's the play.
[00:14:43] Brit Morin: That's the play.
[00:14:44] Brit Morin: I love that Sam doesn't watch a lot of TV, but does watch South Park like religiously.
[00:14:48] Jessica Lessin: South Park's great.
[00:14:49] I'm not many for presented.
[00:14:51] Jessica Lessin: Oh, yeah, we could end with pop coach or quarter bread.
[00:14:54] Brit Morin: I'm so glad that you're in touch with this part of America for us that cares about any
[00:14:58] Brit Morin: of this stuff.
[00:14:59] Jessica Lessin: Guys, I know mainstream America.
[00:15:01] Jessica Lessin: I'm just letting you know.
[00:15:02] Brit Morin: I don't think that's even mainstream anymore.
[00:15:03] Brit Morin: What?
[00:15:04] Jessica Lessin: It is.
[00:15:05] Jessica Lessin: The Golden Globes are mainstream.
[00:15:06] Jessica Lessin: And by the way, we didn't talk about Disney plus and Disney's like this really is like
[00:15:11] Jessica Lessin: consolidating all streaming media down to potentially paramount Netflix and Disney
[00:15:16] Jessica Lessin: plus, right?
[00:15:17] Jessica Lessin: It's called bundle unbundle.
[00:15:19] Brit Morin: I know, but guess who has the Taylor Swift docuseries premiere this Friday?
[00:15:24] Jessica Lessin: Disney.
[00:15:25] Jessica Lessin: And so they're still there's still my horse, my lead horse and the race.
[00:15:28] Jessica Lessin: Didn't you only make a documentary?
[00:15:29] Brit Morin: Do you mean another documentary?
[00:15:30] Brit Morin: The first one didn't do well enough?
[00:15:31] Brit Morin: Shit, this is your second.
[00:15:32] Jessica Lessin: It's a six episode series.
[00:15:34] Jessica Lessin: I love that.
[00:15:35] Brit Morin: It's like what we could we could choose one distribution strategy or we could just make
[00:15:38] Brit Morin: 50 documentaries and distribute them 50 places.
[00:15:41] Brit Morin: I mean, more power to our lady.
[00:15:43] Dave Morin: I mean, if I had a franchise where I could do that like we do it's called more or less,
[00:15:48] Brit Morin: we just bullshit on the internet once a week and post it.
[00:15:52] But did you know we could be nominated for a Golden Globes next year?
[00:15:56] Jessica Lessin: Because now that's a podcast our category at the Golden Globes just letting you know.
[00:16:00] Jessica Lessin: This is so ridiculous, but I actually want to know I want to bring it back to the consumer
[00:16:04] Dave Morin: first set vote for us.
[00:16:05] Dave Morin: Everyone please don't it.
[00:16:07] Dave Morin: Let's go for a webby first, okay?
[00:16:09] Dave Morin: Low stakes.
[00:16:10] Brit Morin: Oh my God.
[00:16:11] Brit Morin: No, please.
[00:16:12] Jessica Lessin: I mean, 95, okay, keep going.
[00:16:14] Jessica Lessin: It was the joke for it.
[00:16:15] Brit Morin: What are they?
[00:16:16] Brit Morin: What's get Greg go on to one that shorties?
[00:16:18] Brit Morin: That's what he want to be.
[00:16:20] Jessica Lessin: There's no new awards.
[00:16:21] Jessica Lessin: We should invent the new award show for 2026.
[00:16:23] Jessica Lessin: I'm very pro awards.
[00:16:25] Brit Morin: I learned recently that the Golden Globes is the only fun award show because it's the only
[00:16:29] Dave Morin: one you can drink at.
[00:16:31] Dave Morin: That's my Golden Globes trivia of the didn't know that.
[00:16:34] Dave Morin: Can you sauna at it?
[00:16:36] Brit Morin: Because that I would go to.
[00:16:37] Brit Morin: Okay, keep going just.
[00:16:38] Dave Morin: Okay, as consumers, like do we feel like all this consolidation like two prime flicks
[00:16:44] Dave Morin: plus I'll call it?
[00:16:46] Dave Morin: Is it affecting us as consumers?
[00:16:48] Dave Morin: How do we feel about it?
[00:16:49] I feel really good about it because I have less things that I'm subscribed to.
[00:16:52] Jessica Lessin: No, you're subscribed to all.
[00:16:54] Brit Morin: I mean, you're kidding.
[00:16:55] Brit Morin: They're not going to take you less money.
[00:16:56] Brit Morin: They're just going to like make you chart.
[00:16:57] Brit Morin: YouTube this week.
[00:16:59] Jessica Lessin: YouTube this week launched a skinny bundle.
[00:17:02] Jessica Lessin: I know.
[00:17:03] Jessica Lessin: I cried when I saw it.
[00:17:04] Jessica Lessin: I laughed so hard.
[00:17:05] Jessica Lessin: I thought it was so funny.
[00:17:06] Jessica Lessin: With a skinny bundle.
[00:17:07] Jessica Lessin: YouTube took some GLP ones and now we can pay less.
[00:17:11] Skinny is in.
[00:17:12] Brit Morin: Let's just acknowledge the greatness of YouTube, right?
[00:17:15] Dave Morin: So they, forever they were like, we don't need the cable bundle.
[00:17:18] Dave Morin: We'll just kill it.
[00:17:19] Dave Morin: Then they were like, actually is taking us some time to kill it.
[00:17:22] Dave Morin: So we're just going to replace it.
[00:17:24] Dave Morin: And then they were like, okay, we're basically a winner in replacing it.
[00:17:29] Dave Morin: We're going to slice and dice it the way we think people want to consume it and just
[00:17:34] Dave Morin: like throw the old models of like verticals out.
[00:17:37] Dave Morin: So like we determine what the bundles are.
[00:17:40] Dave Morin: I thought it was so smart.
[00:17:41] Dave Morin: I was talking to you just something about how like Coinbase is just becoming a diversified
[00:17:45] Brit Morin: financial institution.
[00:17:46] Brit Morin: One of the rules in business is you always become the thing you set out to kill.
[00:17:50] Brit Morin: Like that's how this works, right?
[00:17:52] Brit Morin: And so like obviously YouTube set out to kill cable and it's just going to become cable.
[00:17:57] Brit Morin: Coinbase set out to kill the financial world is just going to become many JP Morgan.
[00:18:01] Brit Morin: And like that's how this works.
[00:18:03] Brit Morin: Facebook set out to kill traditional media and it now is traditional media.
[00:18:07] Brit Morin: Guys, people refer to us as legacy media and I think it's so funny.
[00:18:12] So I think that, you know, we had this big blow up with ESPN slash ABC slash Disney a couple
[00:18:19] Jessica Lessin: weeks ago with YouTube TV where they pulled all content off of YouTube TV and everyone
[00:18:25] Jessica Lessin: freaked out.
[00:18:26] Jessica Lessin: And I actually then subscribed to ESPN, which I hadn't done before as part of my Disney
[00:18:31] Jessica Lessin: package because I needed to watch my sports.
[00:18:34] Jessica Lessin: But then a week later it reversed.
[00:18:36] Jessica Lessin: However, now within two weeks later, there's a skinny bundle and one of them is a sports
[00:18:41] Jessica Lessin: bundle.
[00:18:42] Jessica Lessin: So there's definitely some weird business dynamics happening here between I think probably
[00:18:46] Jessica Lessin: ESPN driving this Dave.
[00:18:47] Jessica Lessin: How do you feel as a consumer is consumer Dave satisfied?
[00:18:51] Dave Morin: This is also boring boring.
[00:18:54] Unknown Host: It's not though.
[00:18:55] Dave Morin: This is also boring.
[00:18:56] Unknown Host: I just think back to some of the media conferences that I've been to over the years where all they
[00:19:00] Unknown Host: talk about for like the entire conferences, are we bundling or unbundling, bundling or
[00:19:05] Unknown Host: unbundling?
[00:19:06] Unknown Host: It's the most boring business.
[00:19:08] Unknown Host: But is the content good?
[00:19:09] Dave Morin: Are you satisfied as a consumer?
[00:19:11] Dave Morin: This is what I want to know.
[00:19:12] Dave Morin: With what?
[00:19:13] All of it?
[00:19:14] Unknown Host: The state of streaming.
[00:19:15] Dave Morin: Like a big part of these deals is they're going to have to make the case that is good
[00:19:18] Dave Morin: for the consumer and for the content creator probably, although I don't really understand
[00:19:22] Dave Morin: that.
[00:19:23] Unknown Host: YouTube TV has been a great thing in terms of sports for the last couple of years.
[00:19:29] Unknown Host: And I find that to be the best sports experience because you can just open it and press play
[00:19:34] Unknown Host: and it's like always got the right thing that you're looking for, which is a surprisingly
[00:19:38] Unknown Host: simple thing to do deliver.
[00:19:40] Unknown Host: It's just like just give me the sports that are playing right now in NCAA and NFL and
[00:19:45] Unknown Host: whatnot.
[00:19:46] Unknown Host: And last year on an airplane and traveling and then it's like it's mad about it.
[00:19:50] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:19:51] Brit Morin: That sucks.
[00:19:52] Brit Morin: You're out of your zone.
[00:19:53] Brit Morin: I'm like, just I'll pay more for the day.
[00:19:56] Brit Morin: Like why can't I just put it?
[00:19:57] Brit Morin: It's like ridiculous.
[00:19:58] Brit Morin: I know it's not going to ever be addressed because it's too corner a case, but just can
[00:20:01] Brit Morin: you please just try to be $100.
[00:20:02] Brit Morin: So I can watch it not in my time zone for one day.
[00:20:06] Unknown Host: Totally.
[00:20:07] Unknown Host: I bet it's not that corner of a case.
[00:20:09] Unknown Host: I think that this is like, I don't know, that is the worst part, that is the worst part
[00:20:13] Unknown Host: of the user experience.
[00:20:14] Unknown Host: Britt, do people who watch the Golden Globes travel?
[00:20:17] Yes, they do.
[00:20:18] Jessica Lessin: And they're probably also watching them on YouTube TV quite often.
[00:20:22] Jessica Lessin: I just saw some stats.
[00:20:23] Unknown Host: I mean, the travels travels up like travels really up.
[00:20:27] Unknown Host: About half of Americans have never gotten on a plane.
[00:20:30] Unknown Host: Travels really up, man.
[00:20:31] Unknown Host: Guys, Dave and I had our first Starlink experience on two different airlines.
[00:20:37] Jessica Lessin: Okay.
[00:20:38] Dave Morin: I am officially moving the topic.
[00:20:39] Dave Morin: I want to move it to your Starlink experience.
[00:20:42] Dave Morin: And then I want to talk a little bit about data centers and space.
[00:20:45] Dave Morin: So Britt, connect those things.
[00:20:47] Dave Morin: Go.
[00:20:48] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:20:49] Jessica Lessin: I don't know if I can connect it to some data centers and space, but I'll do.
[00:20:52] Jessica Lessin: So Starlink is now available on many United flights.
[00:20:55] Jessica Lessin: I mean, they are the same thing.
[00:20:56] Brit Morin: 44% of Americans fly commercial every year.
[00:20:58] Brit Morin: The other 44% ain't flying private.
[00:21:01] And also on JSX, which is my favorite airline for those who know, you know.
[00:21:07] Jessica Lessin: And this is a game changer because now you can actually watch streaming video.
[00:21:13] Jessica Lessin: You can play like video games.
[00:21:14] Jessica Lessin: You can do, you can do zoom calls.
[00:21:16] Jessica Lessin: For people on zoom calls, because that wouldn't do.
[00:21:18] Jessica Lessin: I didn't see anyone on zoom calls.
[00:21:20] Jessica Lessin: You know what else is less annoying?
[00:21:22] Jessica Lessin: The internet doesn't shut off when you're descending and ascending.
[00:21:25] Jessica Lessin: You've got like an extra probably 30 minutes of internet per flight because of Starlink.
[00:21:29] Jessica Lessin: But can I challenge you on this?
[00:21:30] Jessica Lessin: I don't think that's where this nets out.
[00:21:33] Brit Morin: Like I think what nets out in terms of what happens is once the internet is too good on
[00:21:37] Brit Morin: airplanes, you can no longer do anything other than work on airplanes because there's no
[00:21:41] Brit Morin: excuse where it's like, oh, the internet's down.
[00:21:43] Brit Morin: I'm going to watch a stupid fucking movie.
[00:21:45] Brit Morin: So like I actually think what'll happen is you'll have fewer red eyes.
[00:21:49] Brit Morin: You'll have more daytime flights because it doesn't really matter if you're flying
[00:21:52] Brit Morin: on the country if you have perfect internet.
[00:21:54] Brit Morin: You can just do a normal work day, right?
[00:21:56] Brit Morin: Isn't that a good thing to your red eyes?
[00:21:58] Jessica Lessin: I mean, Brian Johnson will be happy.
[00:22:01] Brit Morin: My sleep is the number one most important thing for my health.
[00:22:04] Jessica Lessin: It's like, that'd be pretty cool if United had a little like thing where like you pay
[00:22:07] Brit Morin: more.
[00:22:08] Brit Morin: It's like your sleep score will be impacted negative 30%.
[00:22:11] Brit Morin: How much is your sleep score worth in United points?
[00:22:14] Brit Morin: It's like some sort of exchange rate.
[00:22:16] Brit Morin: Especially for the life flat seats.
[00:22:17] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:18] Jessica Lessin: I think you're right.
[00:22:20] Jessica Lessin: I mean, I think we're well ultimately as a species miss having the disconnected moments
[00:22:25] Jessica Lessin: of our lives.
[00:22:26] Jessica Lessin: Just think they just have like weeks of that on ocean liners.
[00:22:29] Brit Morin: They play shuffleboard.
[00:22:30] Brit Morin: It was amazing.
[00:22:31] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:22:32] I think we will see stuff like that pop up where maybe there will be a Wi-Fi free airline
[00:22:36] Jessica Lessin: pop up.
[00:22:37] Jessica Lessin: You can be guaranteed no Wi-Fi on your flight and pay extra for it.
[00:22:41] Jessica Lessin: There's no chance that what I actually think the there's no chance.
[00:22:45] Is it this crew that had the idea of like a fake airline where you would just go take
[00:22:52] Dave Morin: advantage of the stationary business class seats?
[00:22:55] Dave Morin: That's Ricky Van Vien and me were iterating on this is the idea of like I want to book
[00:22:59] Brit Morin: a ticket.
[00:23:01] Brit Morin: You don't even need to fly anywhere.
[00:23:02] Brit Morin: I just want like an airplane configuration.
[00:23:04] Brit Morin: I get on and I sit in a chair and I book the hours of flight and I got to put it on
[00:23:07] Brit Morin: my calendar as I'm on the air.
[00:23:09] Brit Morin: And then like you sit and you go lay flat that and a sewer that serves you.
[00:23:13] Brit Morin: Can we say sewer to us anymore?
[00:23:14] Brit Morin: And like you can just be like it's like to what else do you have 2 p.m. permission to
[00:23:18] Brit Morin: take a nap in the middle of a Tuesday, right?
[00:23:20] Brit Morin: Like you need to be on a flight but you don't need to fly me anywhere.
[00:23:23] Brit Morin: You know, this is what I pitched for Waymo by the way where I just want to be in a driverless
[00:23:27] Jessica Lessin: car for an hour with my meditation music.
[00:23:30] Jessica Lessin: I don't care what drives me around the city.
[00:23:32] Jessica Lessin: I just want to be chill for an hour.
[00:23:33] Jessica Lessin: People actually are apparently talking about doing this which is you just like go from
[00:23:37] Brit Morin: like San Jose or whatever.
[00:23:38] Brit Morin: And if you just it's the cheapest hotel room, you know, type thing.
[00:23:42] Brit Morin: Well, wait, speaking of Dave and I also lived in the future again.
[00:23:47] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, let's go to self driving cars.
[00:23:49] Jessica Lessin: Okay.
[00:23:50] Jessica Lessin: So Dave and I were in Vegas this weekend, which is the only city that is currently testing
[00:23:57] Jessica Lessin: Zook's autonomous vehicle.
[00:23:59] Jessica Lessin: That's not true.
[00:24:00] Brit Morin: It's testing San Francisco.
[00:24:01] Brit Morin: I have an invite to it.
[00:24:02] Unknown Host: No, it's not actually running in San Francisco yet.
[00:24:05] Unknown Host: Sam, I don't know.
[00:24:06] Unknown Host: I got I got an invite.
[00:24:07] Unknown Host: I haven't used it yet, but I got an invite.
[00:24:10] Unknown Host: No, we got the invites too, but the cars aren't available.
[00:24:12] Unknown Host: Hmm.
[00:24:13] They're still in testing, I think.
[00:24:16] How did it measure to the Almighty Waymo?
[00:24:18] Jessica Lessin: Tell me.
[00:24:19] Unknown Host: It's so good.
[00:24:20] Never riding in a waymo again.
[00:24:22] Jessica Lessin: I'm pros, dukes all the way.
[00:24:24] Jessica Lessin: Sure waymo.
[00:24:25] Did you hear it?
[00:24:27] Jessica Lessin: By the way, a woman delivered a baby in a waymo this week in San Francisco.
[00:24:31] Jessica Lessin: Okay.
[00:24:32] Jessica Lessin: We can skip.
[00:24:33] Jessica Lessin: But that's going to lower her driver's score.
[00:24:36] Unknown Host: It's like a booth.
[00:24:37] Jessica Lessin: You're facing each other.
[00:24:39] It's really awesome.
[00:24:41] Jessica Lessin: You can have conversations.
[00:24:44] It's way more social of an experience.
[00:24:47] Jessica Lessin: I would have meetings in this car.
[00:24:50] Jessica Lessin: I actually think that it's a different app entirely.
[00:24:53] Unknown Host: The way I was thinking about it is that the cars themselves are different apps on top
[00:24:57] Unknown Host: of the self-driving car experience.
[00:25:01] Unknown Host: The ones that have this social experience, you're definitely going to want them when
[00:25:06] Unknown Host: you're out with your family or your friends.
[00:25:09] People are going to make the choice between these different types of cars based on what
[00:25:14] Unknown Host: they want to experience.
[00:25:15] Unknown Host: Do you remember the era when all the VCs were getting buses?
[00:25:19] Brit Morin: Sure, Ben did this.
[00:25:20] Jessica Lessin: I remember.
[00:25:21] Jessica Lessin: It was right before the pandemic.
[00:25:23] Brit Morin: They would just drive their buses up to San Francisco and work out of the bus.
[00:25:28] Brit Morin: It's kind of like that.
[00:25:29] Brit Morin: It was the last of the last observed.
[00:25:31] Brit Morin: I bet there are venture funds.
[00:25:33] Jessica Lessin: Within two years, if zooming zoos is approved in San Francisco, I bet there are deals for
[00:25:38] Jessica Lessin: corporations where they can rent a zoos for a day and just people will host their meetings
[00:25:44] Jessica Lessin: there all day.
[00:25:46] I would host meetings in zoos all day long.
[00:25:48] Brit Morin: You know what I would love?
[00:25:49] Brit Morin: I think just for fun, they should have a zoos that has a printer in it.
[00:25:54] Brit Morin: You can order a zoos with a printer.
[00:25:56] Brit Morin: I think it goes somewhere.
[00:25:57] Brit Morin: I need to print some.
[00:25:58] Brit Morin: Just because they'd be fucking hilarious to make it like an office.
[00:26:00] Brit Morin: Why not a fax machine while you're at it?
[00:26:03] I'm like, if it runs out of paper, it drives itself to a kinkos.
[00:26:07] Brit Morin: I don't think those exist anymore.
[00:26:09] Dave Morin: Oh, they're owned by fax.
[00:26:10] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:26:11] Dave Morin: Self-driving car wars heating up.
[00:26:13] Dave Morin: You guys heard it here first.
[00:26:15] Dave Morin: The zoos are coming.
[00:26:16] Dave Morin: I wonder if it's going to be this real battle, iterative battle where you have to change
[00:26:22] Unknown Host: the type of car pretty aggressively to be the experience that people want because it's
[00:26:28] Unknown Host: so shockingly better in the zoos that it would strike me that this is going to be true.
[00:26:33] Well, I have a couple of thoughts.
[00:26:34] Dave Morin: First, have you said there's a waymo minivan out and about being tested?
[00:26:39] Dave Morin: I don't think they're facing each other, though.
[00:26:42] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:26:43] Dave Morin: But that does not seem like this war is won or lost by the current configuration.
[00:26:49] Dave Morin: I'm pretty sure they can figure this out.
[00:26:51] Dave Morin: It's also like London and Caps, you can face each other and London and like it's marginally
[00:26:55] Brit Morin: better, but it's not like the end of the world.
[00:26:58] Brit Morin: I don't know.
[00:26:59] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:27:00] Dave Morin: This brings you to another.
[00:27:01] Dave Morin: Are we done with self-driving cars?
[00:27:02] Dave Morin: It's related, which is traffic and billboards.
[00:27:05] Dave Morin: Wait, first before we do that, can we talk about space AI?
[00:27:11] Jessica Lessin: Oh, I never connected the space data centers to my starlight.
[00:27:14] Jessica Lessin: Sam, I'll let you kick this off, but I have some thoughts.
[00:27:16] Jessica Lessin: Well, okay.
[00:27:17] Brit Morin: This is the way I think about this.
[00:27:18] Brit Morin: Years and years ago, you guys remember when Elon bought Solar City overnight to save his
[00:27:24] Brit Morin: cousins company and he wrote this memo being like, it's because we want to put solar panels
[00:27:29] Brit Morin: on the roofs of Teslas and everyone was like, that's stupid.
[00:27:32] Brit Morin: But like it's kind of the top of a justification.
[00:27:35] Brit Morin: I think he learned a lot from that because that worked really well.
[00:27:38] Brit Morin: And so now it's like, ah, here's the intersection.
[00:27:41] Unknown Host: It's rockets plus data centers plus solar.
[00:27:45] Brit Morin: It's like, that's the error we're in as we scaled up from like the very claint, put
[00:27:49] Brit Morin: a solar panel on a Tesla to put the data centers in space with solar panels.
[00:27:55] Brit Morin: That's kind of my take on it.
[00:27:56] Brit Morin: Great marketing.
[00:27:57] Brit Morin: I mean, cool, grok generator images.
[00:28:01] Brit Morin: As a SpaceX shareholder, I want that.
[00:28:03] Brit Morin: The only Elon company I love is SpaceX.
[00:28:07] Brit Morin: I love SpaceX.
[00:28:08] Brit Morin: I've always loved it.
[00:28:09] Brit Morin: I'm a shareholder.
[00:28:10] Brit Morin: I God bless if they can get out of one five trillion.
[00:28:12] Brit Morin: And you know what?
[00:28:13] Brit Morin: I won't even sell.
[00:28:14] Brit Morin: I'm very pro SpaceX.
[00:28:16] Brit Morin: So if he wants to come up with a cock-a-mame story about it, God bless.
[00:28:19] Brit Morin: But it's pretty crazy.
[00:28:21] So here's some interesting data.
[00:28:23] Dave Morin: Or so ago, one of my great editors and reporters, Nick Wingfield, interviewed Jeff Bezos about Blue
[00:28:30] Origin.
[00:28:31] Dave Morin: And like, I hope I'm getting this right.
[00:28:34] Dave Morin: Sorry, Nick, if I'm not.
[00:28:35] Dave Morin: But basically, he like floats this idea of data centers in space, sort of like orthogonally
[00:28:40] Dave Morin: or like it comes up in some context.
[00:28:42] Dave Morin: But it's like not a big thing that people want to go into.
[00:28:46] And then the noise around it builds and Sundar talks about it.
[00:28:50] Dave Morin: And it's like kind of surprising that Elon is not talking about it yet.
[00:28:55] Dave Morin: Because Elon talks about everything.
[00:28:57] Dave Morin: He talks about everything space and whatever.
[00:28:59] Dave Morin: It's all his favorite things.
[00:29:01] Brit Morin: But the missing piece of this was reported by the information when we reported that SpaceX
[00:29:07] Dave Morin: is telling some of its investors that they could be IPO ready at the end of next year.
[00:29:13] Dave Morin: And now what is really clear is that this is part of his big thesis about how at an IPO,
[00:29:20] Dave Morin: he is going to convince people that this already pretty incredible and incredibly valued
[00:29:24] Dave Morin: company is going to be worth 10 or 20x more, whatever you have to believe to buy into an
[00:29:28] Dave Morin: IPO at like $800 billion.
[00:29:32] Brit Morin: He says $1.5 trillion.
[00:29:33] Brit Morin: Of course, right.
[00:29:34] Dave Morin: So to get to $5 trillion.
[00:29:35] Dave Morin: And look, it's the one Elon is the one Elon narrative.
[00:29:38] Brit Morin: Here's the thing.
[00:29:39] Brit Morin: You like the teams you're on.
[00:29:40] Brit Morin: God bless.
[00:29:41] Brit Morin: You know, make that happen.
[00:29:42] Brit Morin: That'd be awesome.
[00:29:43] Brit Morin: It the risk of like everyone who understands the energy crisis or the energy situation making
[00:29:48] Dave Morin: for me.
[00:29:50] Every conference I attend has a data center and energy panel.
[00:29:55] Dave Morin: And the panel always has three people.
[00:29:57] Dave Morin: One to two are on the side of holy shit.
[00:30:00] Dave Morin: This is a crisis and we will never have the energy we need to fuel AI.
[00:30:04] Dave Morin: And then the other one to two depending on the panel is like this is a solved problem.
[00:30:09] Dave Morin: We have total visibility towards how we're going to get there and this is made up.
[00:30:13] And I assume the truth is somewhere in the middle.
[00:30:16] Dave Morin: But I am actually curious like which one it is.
[00:30:19] Dave Morin: So my favorite thing that I saw it float through the feeds on this other day is you guys
[00:30:23] Brit Morin: remember boom supersonic that was like we're going to deliver supersonic.
[00:30:26] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:30:27] Brit Morin: I saw that.
[00:30:28] Brit Morin: Look, I love the ambition.
[00:30:30] Brit Morin: No fucking way.
[00:30:31] Brit Morin: Like this is like not a thing.
[00:30:32] Brit Morin: Here's what I saw it float through is amazing is you know they pivoted into.
[00:30:36] Brit Morin: They're like we're using the engine generators supersonic generators.
[00:30:41] Brit Morin: The supersonic generator engine.
[00:30:43] Brit Morin: And now we have a data center play.
[00:30:46] Brit Morin: And like to me I'm like this is hilarious because one it's like whoever invested in boom
[00:30:51] Brit Morin: supersonic.
[00:30:52] Brit Morin: I think they were going to deliver profitable supersonic airplanes.
[00:30:55] Brit Morin: I thought for a moment maybe trunk deregulation.
[00:30:58] Brit Morin: There's some it's not going to happen.
[00:31:00] Brit Morin: So you like that was a dumb investment.
[00:31:03] Brit Morin: But you'll be saved by the narrative right because if they can pull off the narrative
[00:31:06] Brit Morin: shift which is kind of like a mini Elon of no no no no we actually just have this amazing
[00:31:11] Brit Morin: engine we built like for power and data centers.
[00:31:14] Brit Morin: That's like hilarious and like a great example of where we are in 2025 in the most risky
[00:31:20] Brit Morin: and also interesting way where like it's all narrative and like it might they might pull
[00:31:24] Brit Morin: it off.
[00:31:25] Brit Morin: They might pull it off.
[00:31:27] Unknown Host: Is that one of the new is that one of the new strategies for company like later stage
[00:31:32] Unknown Host: startups in 2025 which is how effectively can you pivot into the narrative shift with
[00:31:38] Unknown Host: your next product line.
[00:31:39] Unknown Host: So Dave I really think so and I think it's a really interesting startup framework.
[00:31:44] Brit Morin: Because here's here to you're me on this for a second.
[00:31:46] Brit Morin: I was thinking about this.
[00:31:48] All this AI shit generative that it for sure means that you can pivot faster right because
[00:31:56] Brit Morin: like I think about it like how the hell do you do this stuff whatever let's imagine all
[00:31:59] Brit Morin: the deep research regulatory filings like all this complexity this is actually the leverage
[00:32:04] Brit Morin: of AI is pivot speed right because all these things you need you need 50 experts figure
[00:32:08] Brit Morin: out and I like I'll get half of it really quickly.
[00:32:12] Brit Morin: That then becomes interesting is like what is a startup it's like you collect people
[00:32:15] Brit Morin: out of thesis.
[00:32:16] Brit Morin: You want to be in like the right zip code where you're doing something of value that's
[00:32:20] Brit Morin: kind of hard right but then you got to just watch the narratives and be ready to pivot
[00:32:25] Brit Morin: it and move into like the central thesis so that you have a story that you can sell right
[00:32:29] Brit Morin: I think this is always somewhat true on the internet.
[00:32:32] Brit Morin: Like this happened a lot like ad tech or whatever you kind of build a stack and you squint
[00:32:36] Brit Morin: at it or like remember like app nexus was like building a competitive cloud and then
[00:32:41] Brit Morin: became an ads thing like people pivot but I think the speed of pivoting and speed of
[00:32:45] Brit Morin: pivoting crazy things is gotten way faster and narrative is everything and it may also
[00:32:51] Unknown Host: be that the meme machine that is the internet has become even more effective at distributing
[00:32:58] Unknown Host: to all of the entrepreneurs what there is demand for and what products like the market
[00:33:04] Unknown Host: needs.
[00:33:05] Unknown Host: It was so short term.
[00:33:07] Unknown Host: What's an interesting frame to think about these panels because you're right there is this
[00:33:10] Unknown Host: there is this pretty intense conversation going on like every podcast and every panel
[00:33:15] Unknown Host: like almost every day about where are we going to get all this energy well we can get
[00:33:19] Unknown Host: the energy from fossil fuels or you know we have to burn all the diner floors on earth
[00:33:24] Unknown Host: or we can build nuclear and now you sort of have this new thing happening which it's not
[00:33:30] Unknown Host: just Elon I noticed that soon dark is like every single media hit that he did in the last
[00:33:35] Unknown Host: two weeks is talking about data centers in space.
[00:33:39] Unknown Host: And so he's also talking about he's actually citing very specific you know this is the
[00:33:44] Unknown Host: energy level that we need to achieve we think we can only achieve it if we're actually
[00:33:48] Unknown Host: like up there you know closer to the sun and whether or not you believe any of this like
[00:33:52] Unknown Host: the Dyson spheres now is like are we already moved on from like circulating satellites
[00:33:57] Brit Morin: to Dyson spheres.
[00:33:59] People love science fiction.
[00:34:01] Unknown Host: That's what people are I mean that's what people are talking about right and so whether
[00:34:05] Unknown Host: or not this is a real thing everyone is talking about this energy constraint so all the entrepreneurs
[00:34:13] Unknown Host: are looking at it like ah no energy constraint in space no energy constraint with supersonic
[00:34:19] Unknown Host: generator like I can apply my technology to this and so I will do it here's the thing
[00:34:24] Brit Morin: though that is like this is the question about efficient allocation of human resources
[00:34:28] Brit Morin: at a big picture right like the beauty of capitalism and markets is supposed to be this
[00:34:32] Brit Morin: machine for allocating real resources based on actual dollar demand for things right
[00:34:37] Brit Morin: like this is high at one on I love high right like the world is too complicated to understand
[00:34:42] Brit Morin: reduces the prices traded this is kind of probably market has some vibes around it sort
[00:34:47] Brit Morin: of but this is the thing is like we now have a narrative machine on the internet which
[00:34:52] Brit Morin: produces a different signal of what to go work on and spend effort on which is actually
[00:34:56] Brit Morin: not a real dollar engine is not a market it's like a attention market and that the good
[00:35:01] Brit Morin: news about that is in some ways even faster and can run faster than a dollar market the bad
[00:35:06] Brit Morin: news about it is I think it is very very prone to dramatic distortion or ending up putting a lot
[00:35:11] Brit Morin: of people and resources on narratives that don't actually make sense because you're not actually
[00:35:15] Brit Morin: transacting the dollars right like you're transacting attention and is that the art of it Sam
[00:35:19] Unknown Host: like you've been right to point this out you know Elon's narratives are like this a lot is the
[00:35:25] Unknown Host: art of this type of entrepreneurship being able to harness the you know the narrative and the memes
[00:35:30] Unknown Host: to attract the capital and then actually apply the capital to real you know quote unquote real
[00:35:36] Unknown Host: business and that's like the real art now now we're figuring it out I think this exactly right Dave
[00:35:41] Brit Morin: but I think the interesting thing is like Elon is the king of this cheap dollars in but then
[00:35:45] Brit Morin: because he's so good at narrative he's able to and he's a public market sky like he needs the public
[00:35:50] Brit Morin: market in his stocks because he needs the people the riff raft to like bid it up and buy the narrative
[00:35:56] Brit Morin: which then becomes a flywheel of more capital right but you can't just keep doing that without
[00:36:00] Unknown Host: delivering something that actually works right well but here's the thing the question you the
[00:36:04] Brit Morin: the delivering something that works it it has to work a little bit because otherwise the narrative
[00:36:09] Brit Morin: falls apart right so like you think about like Tesla does not financially work as a public company
[00:36:14] Brit Morin: it doesn't but they have a cool car and you need the cool car even if it costs way too much like
[00:36:19] Brit Morin: in and out right and the to sell the dream SpaceX again I keep saying I love SpaceX the rockets are so
[00:36:25] Brit Morin: cool Starlink is awesome right financially it's not going to justify being a 1.5 trillion dollar
[00:36:31] Brit Morin: company that's a narrative right but it's interesting because it's like there is this interplay which
[00:36:36] Brit Morin: is like story begets primary capital begets more story and something real begets more capital
[00:36:42] Brit Morin: begets valuation and it's like this flywheel but a lot of its story driven like open a i's trying to do
[00:36:47] Brit Morin: this too it's like what is open a i worth discount a cash flow it's sent on the dollar right it feels
[00:36:52] Brit Morin: like the art is in the narrative choice right like how far is the narrative from what is possible
[00:36:59] Unknown Host: today with your current technology it's like it's not this crazy idea that they could take the same
[00:37:05] Unknown Host: satellite technology that they're using to do starlink add more satellites to the constellation
[00:37:11] Unknown Host: that fgp use in them use the same backhaul you know like that's not the craziest narrative nor is like
[00:37:18] Unknown Host: you know we can use the same robotic manufacturing lines a Tesla to build you know more sophisticated
[00:37:24] Unknown Host: robots than the cyber truck and those are called humanoid robots and it's like just enough crazy
[00:37:29] Unknown Host: that it's on the far end of crazy and the art of it is figuring that out right you need infinite
[00:37:34] Brit Morin: tam right like story must be huge then there's something like a trust multiplier on the narrative
[00:37:41] Brit Morin: where it's like if you're you on because you've pulled off a few hat tricks and you're like which
[00:37:44] Brit Morin: he has he gets like a multiple expansion on trust like a multiple expansion on the narrative
[00:37:50] Brit Morin: that like you don't get and i don't get right the same way and so there's like a there's almost
[00:37:54] Brit Morin: like a narrative expansion multiple not just a financial multiple right all right we've solved the
[00:37:59] Brit Morin: world's problems i love it Davis why we do this i i like it when david sam go on a journey together
[00:38:06] Jessica Lessin: but we're on this journey the journey is basically decided say whatever you want and ride the moment
[00:38:12] Dave Morin: and raise the capital no but not everybody can do this well but build build a trust machine build a
[00:38:18] Brit Morin: machine and then you got to like at least deliver 20 cents on the dollar you know you got to deliver
[00:38:24] Brit Morin: that's what Tesla is opening i got you got to deliver 20 cents on the dollar right 20 cents is the new
[00:38:29] Jessica Lessin: 80 20 i wish more women leaders would be able to sell big narratives i feel like women can't do
[00:38:34] Jessica Lessin: this well enough yeah end up in jail although they deserve to they deserve to to be clear i would
[00:38:39] Dave Morin: like to be on the record about just Elizabeth home i don't know the founder of canva like i think
[00:38:45] Unknown Host: that women can be more crazy push the envelope a little bit more but straight lying is almost the
[00:38:50] Brit Morin: point you can't straight lie if you straight well but thermos did oh yeah because that's that's
[00:38:57] Brit Morin: that collapses your your multiple expansion on the narrative yeah for sure going to jail discount
[00:39:04] Dave Morin: you for the next narrative a little yes or if you start tweeting from jail you might be able to
[00:39:10] Unknown Host: establish the next narrative well all right it's like you know it's interesting in terms of trust
[00:39:14] Brit Morin: narratives like what's happening with sbf it's like it turns out sbf had a great venture portfolio
[00:39:20] Brit Morin: right like great venture portfolio right like but he also just completely cheated and like i it's
[00:39:25] Brit Morin: like it like i don't know it's like kind of wild when you think about these characters i think also
[00:39:30] Dave Morin: you want needs the money for x and x ai too i think there's like we have to remember to you're
[00:39:37] Dave Morin: very smart to bring up solar city sand that is a very illustrative example of how he thinks
[00:39:43] Dave Morin: you know what we didn't get to do in vegas that i'm a little bummed about is go in a tunnel
[00:39:47] Jessica Lessin: and apparently the tunnel project the boring project the boring company whatever it's like a real
[00:39:53] Jessica Lessin: it's really happening and there's a new there's a new tunnel being dug from the strip to the airport
[00:39:58] Jessica Lessin: that'll be live next year so an only test list can write in it so we'll have to get out of our
[00:40:03] Jessica Lessin: zooks and get into a test look it sounds like the big dig this was our college experience but in
[00:40:09] Dave Morin: fairness to you on again it's like you just it's like you tell a vision you get the trust multiple
[00:40:13] Brit Morin: expansion that's no one else can get you get the capital it turns out you should be able to dig a
[00:40:17] Brit Morin: tunnel for a tenth the price of what it costs to dig a tunnel he figures it out good for you okay i
[00:40:22] Dave Morin: want to talk about my victory of the day can't talk about my victory of the day go for you've only
[00:40:25] Dave Morin: had a one there was fake news and i got it corrected about the information do you guys want to
[00:40:30] Dave Morin: hear a story yeah you have to hear a story i have a mic so my incredible reporters adasia who have
[00:40:38] Dave Morin: been all over all things chip and ai in video wallay award winning reporters publish a story
[00:40:45] Dave Morin: this morning extra published it one saying that deep seeks latest models being trained on smuggled
[00:40:49] Dave Morin: black wells in videos latest awesome talk it's trade routes it basically so black the other big news
[00:40:57] Dave Morin: of this week also foreshadowed in the information weeks ago was that the trump administration would
[00:41:02] Dave Morin: allow a more advanced chip to be sold to china the h 200 and this was really interesting we had a great
[00:41:10] Dave Morin: great discussion with Patrick more head on t it v about it this week because it's unclear that
[00:41:15] Dave Morin: china actually is going to allow its companies to use this chip because china of course is pushing
[00:41:20] Dave Morin: its dominance so one of the stories the team broke was overnight the meeting where the chinese
[00:41:26] Dave Morin: government assembled all its top tech companies to figure out what is the actual demand for this chip
[00:41:32] Dave Morin: do you need it to be competitive so that was one great story inside the china government confab
[00:41:38] Dave Morin: with its leading tech titans second story deep seek training its model on the most advanced tech
[00:41:44] Dave Morin: there is out there now there's been lot of great reporting on smuggling we are not the first to
[00:41:49] Dave Morin: do that i think writers had a great series about it last year the journal stents and reporting so
[00:41:53] Dave Morin: it is well known that these chips are getting smuggled into china and companies getting access to them
[00:41:59] Dave Morin: so in the story we asked in video for comment in video which you know takes any point will be
[00:42:05] Dave Morin: as aggressive as they can be in denying a story and they didn't deny it they said we have no
[00:42:10] Dave Morin: knowledge of this but will investigate all claims of smuggling right so then i wake up and you
[00:42:17] Dave Morin: know everyone's reported our story and understandably and video's comment which is relevant we put it
[00:42:23] Dave Morin: in our story to begin with but cmbc said it refuted our story i was like i don't believe that comment
[00:42:31] Dave Morin: refutes the story they're trying to like cast down on it for sure but there is nothing in there
[00:42:37] Dave Morin: that is a refutation and i would like to thank the very smart editors at cmbc who corrected their
[00:42:43] Dave Morin: headline truth and journalism and i am telling that story also because it's a big one well i'm
[00:42:50] Brit Morin: proud of it and i'm proud of cmbc and i'm also is that rare for one to correct it's very rare
[00:42:58] Dave Morin: and i also think this isn't a big deal no one was debating the substance of the article or what was
[00:43:04] Dave Morin: but i believe there's a difference between denying something and the statement they put out there
[00:43:09] Dave Morin: and i think news organizations that take that statement and use it to throw shade against other
[00:43:14] Dave Morin: professional journalists is just really not what we need of in this era when CEOs and executives
[00:43:22] Dave Morin: are just pushing the boundary of calling true reporting fake news and so you know my team
[00:43:28] Dave Morin: like historically i would have ignored that and my team was like you have to get it corrected
[00:43:32] Dave Morin: and you know i'm like you know what i'll do my best and so i appreciated that and i think this is
[00:43:38] Dave Morin: definitely how we're going to continue to respond i mean mark bennie off denied a story that his
[00:43:44] Dave Morin: cto told us on the record and was quoted in the story this is months ago now but this is the new state
[00:43:51] Dave Morin: wait like we wrote a story where the chief product officer chief innovation officer
[00:43:56] Dave Morin: cheek technology officer a sales force told us on the record they were in talks with companies
[00:44:00] Dave Morin: about this project we published 24 hours later the story and bennie have called it fake news
[00:44:06] Dave Morin: and i was like does your does this executive rescind the entire interview no
[00:44:11] Dave Morin: so he said it and we can believe it yes then why are you calling it fake news that's weird
[00:44:16] that's well done news is expensive truth is expensive good job getting to the truth yes here's
[00:44:22] a question how long do you think it'll be before we're like shooting boats full of h two hundreds
[00:44:28] Brit Morin: off tour wasn't that the joke that that was the joke at the beginning right that you know we'd be
[00:44:34] Unknown Host: hitting data centers it's like really it's like it's like we're going to shoot the boats on the
[00:44:37] Brit Morin: way in with britz nose candy and the boats in the way out with h two hundred oh yeah the reality
[00:44:43] Brit Morin: is they're not coming from the u.s what am i kidding they're coming where are they coming from
[00:44:46] Brit Morin: singapore something somewhere closer it's wild i'm so so you know i i was at a fascinating lunch
[00:44:53] Dave Morin: with a bunch of cmos who are partners of ours in the valley yesterday and one of the really smart
[00:45:00] Dave Morin: ones made this case that when china talks about a i to its people and in general they talk about
[00:45:08] Dave Morin: real benefits it's delivering to people now they talk about the health benefits they have like
[00:45:13] Dave Morin: integrated a i to many different parts of their economy and their government and they talk about
[00:45:21] Dave Morin: they don't talk about is open a i being chat gpt i mean sorry beaten jerman and
[00:45:27] and like at the end of the day these models are all advanced they're all getting access to the arms
[00:45:34] Dave Morin: in the arms war and i think the u.s should have a lot more focus on what we're doing with a i
[00:45:39] Dave Morin: and how it's benefiting people then in all this other stuff but that's my hobby horse of the moment
[00:45:45] Dave Morin: people really don't like a i i've been trying to i've been testing out my thesis that we just
[00:45:50] Dave Morin: shouldn't call it a i what do you mean by that what do you mean people don't like a i the back lash
[00:45:56] Dave Morin: from like both a policy but just you know people living their lives concerned about the impact on
[00:46:02] Dave Morin: energy prices and mental health is growing and growing and growing and i think it's so telling that
[00:46:09] Dave Morin: when trump proposed a lighter touch regulatory approach that would let the federal law that
[00:46:16] Dave Morin: was lighter touch supersede or executive order supersede state legislations republicans pushback
[00:46:23] Dave Morin: even now republicans are feeling the pressure to pushback more and regulate more heavily a i
[00:46:30] Dave Morin: because it is really in many circumstances is unpopular people hated social media the whole way
[00:46:36] Unknown Host: along too but it just got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and it hasn't stopped right
[00:46:40] Unknown Host: and like no regulation really had any impact at all it's true but countries have now are now banning
[00:46:46] Jessica Lessin: it yeah australia when in their van went into effect today i think ban what instagram and social media
[00:46:53] Jessica Lessin: for people sixteen and under there go all of our pictures of bumburans and kangaroos it's a really
[00:46:58] Brit Morin: interesting question Dave and i think time will tell how this reaction is different from others
[00:47:04] Dave Morin: i guess that's what i'm asking like is it because jobs it to me like the main differences like
[00:47:09] Unknown Host: people are people fear for their jobs i think it's also mental health it's jobs mental health and
[00:47:14] Dave Morin: belief in energy prices do you really think it's mental health i mean i'm not really candid it i'm
[00:47:19] Brit Morin: not really candid it who's running for uh reasonably high office this morning and we're going through
[00:47:23] Brit Morin: kind of his community and what they care about and tech and he was like i hadn't heard much about it
[00:47:28] Brit Morin: but in the last two weeks the anti-AI thing it's really growing he's like it's three things it's
[00:47:34] Brit Morin: energy prices it's a narrow about water and it's mental health and kids and like he's like these are
[00:47:41] Brit Morin: real things coming up from when stitch wins at like meaningful scale all of a sudden but mental health
[00:47:45] Brit Morin: and kids yeah it's the Tristan i mean i was i was snarkly tweeting about this yesterday with like
[00:47:50] Brit Morin: Tristan Harris on uh going you know who his come back around because another thing for him to be
[00:47:55] Brit Morin: upset about he was on the dire of a CEO which actually good podcast yeah great podcast it's
[00:48:00] Unknown Host: loads of investor very excited happy to be a very tiny shareholder and um he's kind of doing a
[00:48:06] Brit Morin: whole at least i only saw the clip on social media haven't seen the whole thing but he's kind of
[00:48:10] Brit Morin: out being like chat gpt's number one use case is now therapy and like everyone can have a perfect
[00:48:18] Brit Morin: therapist or problem like that's terrifying for everyone including open AI like you do not want to
[00:48:22] Brit Morin: be someone's like always on low-end therapists that is not a highly commercially viable place to
[00:48:28] Brit Morin: be and it's super scary because everyone's going crazy yeah but sam i push back with the same
[00:48:33] Unknown Host: counter that i just did to just which is this exact same thing happened in the 2010s with mobile
[00:48:39] Unknown Host: social media where everybody was like mobile social media is now everybody's friends that they're
[00:48:44] Unknown Host: now everybody's parasocial friends and Tristan was out there warning warning warning about the
[00:48:48] Unknown Host: destruction of the mind and human society and all this stuff and nothing changed that that is
[00:48:53] Brit Morin: a totally fair point and what i said is like when Tristan's mad about it he's probably it's probably
[00:48:57] Brit Morin: not the right narrative because that's his consistently being a wrong thing but like you know i
[00:49:02] Brit Morin: mean there is something right like social media is like genuinely pretty damaging to mental health
[00:49:08] Unknown Host: too right but it's like like we have we made meaningful progress on this not really right like and
[00:49:14] Unknown Host: so i i worry that like we're going to be in the same place on AI i don't know what the right narrative
[00:49:18] Unknown Host: is but like i mean i would bet that society will take all the benefits of AI in exchange for all
[00:49:25] Dave Morin: the negative things around AI like in the long run like i don't i don't think that fundamental
[00:49:31] Dave Morin: dynamic that we seem to play out with like privacy or social media like changes but i think there's
[00:49:38] Dave Morin: a strategic question these companies face versus like i think i've talked about it a length here or
[00:49:43] Dave Morin: i've talked about it we'll talk about a lot of things a lot of places but like
[00:49:47] Dave Morin: Gemini isn't Gemini AI and i mean the google does have AI mode so this is somewhat a flawed example
[00:49:53] Dave Morin: right but i think there is actually a question in how these products are talked about
[00:49:57] that companies are debating but that's all i want to say i want to end guys i want to bring this
[00:50:01] Dave Morin: to a close with can we talk about like whenever i do a q and a the first question i get is like
[00:50:06] Dave Morin: when's the bubble gonna burst or like bubble stuff and i'm not particularly interested in
[00:50:11] Dave Morin: promulsticating on that but i really have some new evidence of how frothy things are failing at the
[00:50:18] Dave Morin: moment i'm curious what you guys think about have you seen the billboards on the 101 lately we don't
[00:50:24] Jessica Lessin: really we don't really go down the 101 down to where you live okay well come visit it is getting
[00:50:30] Jessica Lessin: to like hype town like the billboards okay so the billboards are now we're in AI town we're in
[00:50:38] Dave Morin: AI company town right i mean it just i mean just the what i will add to this is that vegas
[00:50:46] Unknown Host: every single digital billboard in vegas this weekend was AI billboards was this a tech event
[00:50:52] Dave Morin: you guys were at or no no no it was the rodeo the rodeo was going on in vegas this weekend okay
[00:50:58] Unknown Host: and every single billboard was AI i mean it might have been left over from f1 last weekend
[00:51:04] Unknown Host: but i don't know okay i really have always wanted i've wanted this for years i've always wanted
[00:51:11] Brit Morin: someone to make a coffee the whole book of billboards of the 101 where you just take a photo of
[00:51:14] Brit Morin: every single one for like decades because it's fascinating to watch the turnover of them like
[00:51:19] Brit Morin: goes from the the ipod nano mini to the bubble bubble but here's my basic thing when my mother
[00:51:25] Brit Morin: comes to town for 15 years she'd be like i don't know what any of these companies are what they do
[00:51:29] Brit Morin: or like and that's true she doesn't you see apple google you know phone things like that it's kind
[00:51:36] Brit Morin: of the point where i go up in the 101 and i don't know what any of these companies do because they're
[00:51:41] Brit Morin: just like there are companies that serve companies that serve companies with some random AI
[00:51:46] Brit Morin: shit right and everyone's a while i see a company we invested in like oh there it is but like well
[00:51:50] Dave Morin: they're not designed for us they're recruiting engineers but i think there's something about like
[00:51:55] Brit Morin: the bubble indicator if you had a long term study of 101 billboards i agree with this completely
[00:52:01] Brit Morin: with a further than 101 billboard getaway from my product that your mother would recognize
[00:52:07] Brit Morin: yep this is a great indicator the more likely you're in a bubble right and like i just think we're
[00:52:12] Brit Morin: like tending into this zone we're like you're not even selling b2b companies it's b2b2b2
[00:52:18] Brit Morin: cloud sub blob laws and you're like i agree i'm laughing because i agree but you need like some
[00:52:26] Brit Morin: hedge i wish some hedge fund had just sent the photographer every single day for the last 15
[00:52:32] Brit Morin: years and just take a picture of every billboard and make a coffee table book and build a data set
[00:52:36] Brit Morin: the companies have them the the the people who want the billboards have the data don't they
[00:52:42] Dave Morin: so here's the thing i would pay Lamar ad outdoor advertising or something for like the long term
[00:52:48] Brit Morin: archive of their every single ad they run on the 101 because i think there's a really cool data
[00:52:54] Brit Morin: said they're just it's a great data set for the information to build that out and like you drop
[00:52:57] Brit Morin: some AI on top of like what the fuck are these ads and like you're gonna you're gonna have some cool
[00:53:01] Brit Morin: leading indicator of disasters so i'm so into this and i just let me tell you a little bit i'm
[00:53:06] Dave Morin: gonna give you a very short map of the 101 billboards right so you have the ai companies recruiting
[00:53:11] Dave Morin: engineers who don't they just put their name they don't even bother to describe what they're doing
[00:53:16] Dave Morin: because it makes a sense then you have what i call stripe alley which is the companies that stripe
[00:53:21] Dave Morin: has recently acquired or is partnered with and then acquires later so bridges on there and is it
[00:53:28] Dave Morin: metronome and then the billboards change and they add stripe a stripe company underneath so i
[00:53:35] Dave Morin: i look at it for what company stripes gonna buy then you have the random ones that are trying to
[00:53:40] Dave Morin: get attention so salana has a billboard saying like we're growing faster than the bag seven we're
[00:53:46] Dave Morin: growing faster than a 40% faster something you know oh well let's skip over that part of the narrative
[00:53:51] Unknown Host: that's fine yeah they were growing faster than the mag seven they were crying faster than i
[00:53:56] Dave Morin: take your bill or death but i love it and i think between the changing landscapes of the billboard
[00:54:02] Dave Morin: the huge uptick in traffic and i heard san francisco rent prices are up 30% i heard that from my dad so
[00:54:09] Dave Morin: it must be true he's my source i i just think like we're we're big boom indicators here's the fun
[00:54:15] Dave Morin: metric i think if you did dollars let's not even talk about ebeda if you just did dollars of revenue
[00:54:23] Brit Morin: per billboard average per day right so you take all the billboards and add them up and all the
[00:54:28] Brit Morin: revenue of all the companies running all the billboards and add it up right and divide by the ad
[00:54:34] Brit Morin: spenders and there's like some number you can pull out of that that is like a very good leading bubble
[00:54:38] Brit Morin: indicator yeah and also and like just imagine i mean we're wrapping up 2025 just imagine we're sitting
[00:54:46] Dave Morin: here at the end of 2026 and we're talking about like in real terms like the wheels are in motion for a
[00:54:53] Dave Morin: SpaceX IPO an open AI IPO an androle IPO and an anthropic IPO like holy shit maybe a bite dance
[00:55:04] Dave Morin: IPO but probably not here it's wild we need some ideas well i also think people are going to want to
[00:55:09] Brit Morin: get all this stuff out i mean this is the thing is like the great question of the whole thing
[00:55:15] as we talked about many times minus a i we're in a recession right a i is the only thing keeping
[00:55:20] Brit Morin: the us out of a recession politically a huge incentive to stoke the fires of the story right
[00:55:26] Brit Morin: all these come if you want like right now gdb looking pretty good real gdp right because it's all
[00:55:32] Brit Morin: Chinese housing boom computers but still gdp number is better than recession right and like the
[00:55:38] Brit Morin: question is what's the next shoe so now you're going to put out all these ipos or whatever let the
[00:55:42] Brit Morin: party continue we'll see what happens to the midterms we'll see what happens when people realize
[00:55:46] Brit Morin: we're screwed on the debt right like there's like these shoes to drop but there is this thing which
[00:55:50] Brit Morin: is like in some ways like imagine there's this huge debt problem for our society big picture
[00:55:55] Brit Morin: the only way out i think we're there i don't think imagine i think we have a huge debt problem
[00:56:00] Dave Morin: for us to say well we're there there's like a debt wall there's a wall of debt that's really bad
[00:56:05] Brit Morin: and like our only chance is to get ramming velocity is the economy to blow through the wall right
[00:56:12] Brit Morin: like we have to like you know we have to like warp through it and so like this is just like pull out
[00:56:16] Brit Morin: all the stops IPO everything and pray agree yes i agree what's the opposite of a soft landings hard
[00:56:25] Dave Morin: crash like what's more extreme than a hard crash landing a wall slamming into a wall smithereens
[00:56:32] Dave Morin: landing so we know some smart people who kind of have this thesis which isn't unreasonable that like
[00:56:38] Brit Morin: sorkin is personally responsible for somewhat of the dip in the market recently because everyone's
[00:56:42] Brit Morin: reading his book which is quite good at 1929 oh it is not his fault okay you have to you have to
[00:56:48] Dave Morin: give the fullness of the theory all the smart people are wait all the smart people think it's sorkins
[00:56:54] Unknown Host: his book came out after this dip Sam yeah but all the walls no no he didn't though the
[00:56:59] Brit Morin: wall street people are reading the book Dave the theory goes and by all the smart people i can
[00:57:04] Dave Morin: attest to five people but there's the theory goes but five very smart people who trade a lot of money
[00:57:09] Brit Morin: five of the smartest is the theory goes i don't know when he told Sam about this and now i have to
[00:57:14] Dave Morin: defend but i also talk to the same sources but yeah go for it okay that if you look at the book
[00:57:20] Dave Morin: the zeitgeisty book that these big money people were reading in the dot com rise it was
[00:57:27] Dave Morin: michael luis's new new thing i thought it was liars poker no i'm sure it's switched at some point
[00:57:32] Dave Morin: but if you're looking at pick a moment don't don't let data get in the way of a good story Dave
[00:57:37] Dave Morin: so then if you look now it's a story about greatest financial crash in history or that i don't know
[00:57:43] Dave Morin: maybe we've had bigger one sense but probably not and again it's just in the zeitgeist right it's
[00:57:50] Dave Morin: the zeitgeist book people have read it they've not read it but it kind of is on people's mind and i
[00:57:56] Dave Morin: think there is some truth to that not in that it's like totally determining the outcome but i think
[00:58:03] Dave Morin: that juxtaposition is interesting okay you're take Dave and then we're going to give their people
[00:58:07] Dave Morin: their piece and go i really love our friend ricky van viends take from his new email newsletter
[00:58:13] Unknown Host: last week let's drop the roll on it's we look cool we all have done that so many times Sam that
[00:58:18] Dave Morin: was an unfair call up the big content hit i like this point that he made which is like that the
[00:58:23] Unknown Host: big content thing whether it's a book or a movie is no longer the front of the conversation anymore
[00:58:31] Unknown Host: it's actually the conversation about those things that is the conversation now and so like you
[00:58:37] Unknown Host: know most books don't get you know there's like a sort of concentric circles like a book only gets
[00:58:43] Unknown Host: read by a certain number of people then the book gets recommended to a certain number of people
[00:58:46] Unknown Host: in the book it's talked about on a bunch of podcasts and i actually think that you know
[00:58:51] Unknown Host: circons book actually just fits into the zeitgeist that was already happening just that like
[00:58:57] Unknown Host: this worry about maybe but it stokes it but it's on it's on people's mind well that's what i'm
[00:59:02] Dave Morin: saying like this worry about data center cap ex specifically and like all of the meg seven going
[00:59:07] Unknown Host: off balance sheet to borrowed debt in order to finance these huge cap ex expenditures over the next
[00:59:12] Unknown Host: two years is like was already on people's minds and the 1929 narrative was was a huge narrative of
[00:59:20] Unknown Host: debt as is most of these huge crashes and so this was already something that people were talking about
[00:59:25] Unknown Host: in his book just happens to fit perfectly into that right he started working on that book like two
[00:59:30] Unknown Host: years ago right no like ten years these were going to have her ten years it just happens to hit
[00:59:34] Unknown Host: at this exact right time for what the conversation about the conversation is right now causation
[00:59:40] Unknown Host: correlation who knows the difference i don't know i will say in closing i want to give you one other
[00:59:45] Brit Morin: i want to give you one bubble fund bubble watch that just came into my inbox that i'm clearing as
