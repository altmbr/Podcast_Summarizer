[00:00:00] When Steve Jobs died, we like forgot how to market.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_01: And then there was this low.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_01: And then Elon came back with this incredible
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_01: Jobsie and style marketing.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_01: And now everybody's adopted it.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_01: And marketing is cool again.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_01: It could be that the actual innovation of Silicon Valley
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_02: is the greatest fucking marketing in the world.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_02: It's not that we're better at marketing
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_03: and it's that we have the megaphone's
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_03: to be good at marketing because marketing
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_03: is only digital these days.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_03: One, one, one.
[00:00:22] One, one, one.
[00:00:24] Is it no more easy?
[00:00:25] Yes.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: Will the bank detect that fast?
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: When we get more, one, one,
[00:00:30] one, one, one, one.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_00: They've been great plus sandwiches.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: Put it all right to the test.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_00: Put it all right to the test.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_00: More or less.
[00:00:43] Well, hello, friends.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_05: Welcome to more or less.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_05: Pre-thanks giving edition.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_05: Hey, Jess.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_03: How's everyone doing?
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_03: Good.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_03: We were, I was working today.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_03: And then for the last 30 minutes,
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_03: I was working on our holiday cards.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_03: And I didn't have you guys played
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_03: with the Canva integration with GPT.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_03: It's actually so good.
[00:01:02] I made my holiday cards in minutes.
[00:01:05] I'm just psyched because I heard
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_01: from a bunch of listeners today,
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: which this never happens consistently.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_01: But I learned about a bunch of listeners this morning
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_01: that I'm just giving a shout out to.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_01: We've got some great people in Brooklyn.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: I didn't know Ryan Hoover listens every week.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: We got all kinds of good people listening.
[00:01:25] Hi, Ryan Hoover.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_02: Hey, Ryan.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_02: No pressure, folks, but are historically
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_05: this episode, Time to Thin Skipping Week,
[00:01:36] is one of our best.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_05: I got to say, I don't know if you remember.
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_05: The Altman years, this,
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_05: little Sam, tell us.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_05: And Sam, hello from the Surfshack.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_05: I see you've traded in the pool house.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_05: I mean, I got to be the shack at all times.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_02: Got a lot of different types of houses.
[00:01:52] A house would be generous for this structure.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_05: We like structure.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_02: Just a structure.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_05: We like structures.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_02: Well, they both have solnism.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_02: So that connects them.
[00:02:02] I mean, come on.
[00:02:02] I've talked about my Surfshack before.
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_05: I mean, it's a work of art.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_05: We don't have to go into it, but it is.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_05: No, I just, I remember when we was in two years ago,
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_02: we were in bulliness doing our thing.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_02: Sorry, Wes Moran, where we were supposed to call it anyway.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_02: And this was like the Altman got kicked out of open AI back in.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_02: That was a fun, that was fun.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_02: I remember that.
[00:02:22] That was really fun.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_05: That was it.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_05: And I think that just set off this pattern of amazing Thanksgiving week episodes,
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_05: just whenever and dying to tune in.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_05: But yeah, so Brett, let's do our check-in.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_05: So you made a GPT,
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_05: you made your holiday card with Canva and GPT.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_05: Well, I always do a little twist on our Moran holiday card.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_03: And I'm not going to give away.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_03: Last year was Where's Waldo, right?
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_03: I was searching for you guys.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_03: Right, but I used Fiverr last year to have this illustrator animate us hidden into this huge
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_03: Christmas scene.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_03: And that was really fun.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_03: That is pretty symbolic.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_05: You replaced the freelance animator with the AI.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_03: No, no.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_03: I mean, I actually paid someone last year.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_03: They just were like in the Philippines.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_03: No, I know, but this year you didn't have to pay anyone.
[00:03:09] Yeah.
[00:03:10] And the point is that the only labor is cutting out is the Philippines labor.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_02: Like that's used with suffering.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_03: This is going worse than I thought.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_03: Brait hasn't paid an American to do work for her in ages.
[00:03:24] I paid Sam Altman.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_03: Come on, guys.
[00:03:26] But did you like, is use a free version?
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_03: I mean, I paid 200 bucks a month for that shit.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_03: Maybe Claire, you actually cost Sam Altman money.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_02: He didn't pay Sam Altman.
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_02: I did do a lot of brainstorming.
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_03: He just underwrote part of your holiday cards, actually.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_02: It's really unclear what you can slice and dice.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_05: I find angels in a million ways to make a million arguments.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_05: So I'm sure there's some accounting calculation that shows he didn't, you didn't cost them
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_05: money.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_05: But all I'm saying though is I feel a little bit bad for like minted and shutter fly
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_03: and all these companies that have these amazing templates that people use for their holiday
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_03: cards.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_03: And I use minted.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_03: But to change to Canva this year, Ala Chat GPT was like an anomaly for me.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_03: So I'm curious how much share those, those companies are going to lose for the holidays
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_03: this year.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_03: Well, the thing I was amazed by is I don't understand how holiday cards are made.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_02: And I asked Jess, you were like, who do you want to send the holiday cards to?
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_02: And you sent me like a 600 line spreadsheet with everyone's addresses, which answered
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_02: a question room, which is like, where do people live?
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_02: Like I had no idea you were keeping this for years.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_02: And I was actually quite impressed with it.
[00:04:34] This is what the women of the household do.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_03: Sam, I have to update this list every year.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_03: And it's so annoying because I have to literally go through it and be like, oh, wait, I think
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_03: those people might have moved.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_03: And then I have to figure out how to reach out to them.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_03: And I'm sure Jess does this too.
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_03: I wait for the bounce back email.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_05: I wait for the bounce back card.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_05: And then I reach out to them.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_05: Why hasn't this part of the, like, why hasn't this been lost to the internet?
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_01: It's been shot.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_02: Everyone has tried this so many times.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_02: And it's one of those classic problems that really shouldn't be a problem.
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_02: And any product person looks at it like this is a ridiculous state of affairs.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_02: But no one cares enough to fix it.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_02: Is like the upshot and like consistent way, right?
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_02: But at your right date, like from a first principles perspective, it's completely ridiculous
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_02: that like addresses are not like you can't just like make an API call that turns an email
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: into an e-tune to address and hit set.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_02: Well, there ever be a future where we have like a authenticated social graph where my
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_03: agent can talk to your agent.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_03: No, but this is never going to happen.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_01: This is what Sam and I are talking about.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the sheer number of identity projects between all of us, it's like ridiculous.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_01: It's just an impossible problem.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_01: My favorite is I've owned the domain, opiumpreferences.com for like 20 years, right?
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_02: Because you think about like, it's like, it's a classic thing.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_02: It's like, always you are like, hi, wait, like dietary, you're like, I don't want to answer
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_02: any of these shit.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_02: It's all the same questions.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_02: Can I just have one repository of all of my preferences on everything and never, and
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_02: just like sit?
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_02: And the answer is no.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_02: No, you can't.
[00:06:06] Why won't your agent have this for you, Sam?
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_03: Like, isn't this where the world's going?
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_03: It just doesn't do.
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_02: It's just like no one, it doesn't care enough.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_02: It's like, it's from a first principle perspective, absolutely, which is why we all own
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_02: versions of this domain a thousand times over.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_02: And like, it's obvious.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_02: And from a practical perspective, anyone who would care to work on this has hired a leverage
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_02: more interesting things to work on.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_02: And it's just not that important.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_02: It's like, yeah, you're just going to tell you again that like, I'm whatever my size
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_02: and weight is, deal with it.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_02: And even if you're a massively resourced company and you choose to work on it, you still
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_01: don't solve it.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_01: That's what the really crazy thing is.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_01: But you do through like Gemini and GPTs, what I'm saying.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_03: Why?
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_01: This was like the entire identity focus of Facebook for like 20 years.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_01: I know, but that was so long ago where I didn't know era Dave.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_03: This is the future.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_03: There is no question that every few years you have to rebuild everything and realize the
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_02: same things again about how the things play out.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_02: Whatever.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_02: Maybe this time to finally build it again.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_05: Guys, I'm so bored.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_05: I just checking the surf report.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_05: So I just want everyone to know that's where I am in this conversation.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_05: But no, what are your surf preferences?
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_02: And that's why it will never be built because it's too fucking boring, even though it's
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_02: obvious.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_02: It just switched the Friday forecast on me, which I don't appreciate because I'm kind
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_05: of making plans based on it.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_05: But anyway, okay, Brett, I wish you, I know you're going to have an awesome holiday card.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_05: I was actually arrived early, put very little thought into it.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_05: I took the picture in July.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_05: I was like, this works.
[00:07:38] And we're go.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_05: So, well, I will say what you guys are going to be very excited about is my God.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_02: Do I have a holiday gift for you?
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_02: Jessica approved for it.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_02: No, I did not prove read this.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_02: Jessica read it and was like, I read it and I said put that in Gemini.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_05: Is it AI?
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_05: Sam?
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_05: It's so good.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_02: It's so good.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_02: It is, it is, it is our, we wrote a book, our guide to etiquette.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_02: It's fabulous.
[00:08:07] It's awesome.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_02: You will get it at our holiday party and it's going into wide release.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_02: Jessica, I made sure she read it before we said to Prince because even I caught one or
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_02: two things in it that I'm like, if I'm going to cancel the over that.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_02: And so, I want to make sure that we weren't going to get hardcore canceled.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_02: No, well, I, here's the problem, Dave.
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_02: I don't care what's on the internet because you can always recall it.
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_02: There is a thing about getting canceled in Prince that you can't like take back, right?
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_02: Like it's a little harder to like, oh, like that is the wrong general role for that character.
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_02: Let's just flip it.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_02: You know, when it's on the internet versus whatever.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_02: Oh, you wanted that level of reading.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_05: Did you not read it that way?
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_02: Because like that's what I was worried about.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_02: I had to correct one or two of our comics where I'm like, even I think that's not the
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_02: correct tone to be taking.
[00:08:56] Well, good thing I like my friends canceled.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_01: Oh, nice.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_03: That's a Taylor Swift reference.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_03: Sam anyway, anyway, the book is amazing.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: You're going to love it.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_02: It's going to be a wide release.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_02: More or less listeners, I will eventually post a link where you can get a copy either by
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_02: financial eventors team member or by buying it using American dollars, but it's awesome.
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_02: What no USD see crypto.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, give me some crypto.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, there still isn't like a really wildly.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_02: There isn't like an easy way that I know of to like do that.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_02: Which says something.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_01: It says something.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_01: It says something about why crypto number go down right now.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_01: No, crypto number five.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_02: Could be number five.
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_02: Crypto number down.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_02: Crypto number up.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_02: Crypto number.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_02: It's just a number.
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_02: What's in a number?
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_02: Let's start.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_05: We've got.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_05: So we have a pretty despite the dawn of the holiday week.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_05: There's a lot of news.
[00:09:49] And I think I try and mix up the topics a little.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_05: We all try to, but I got to say I think today's
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_05: looking like crypto open AI in Google.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_05: That's all I got.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_05: These are what else is there?
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_02: Wait, the Genesis act.
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_05: We don't want to talk about that.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_05: Oh, yeah, Brad, you want to start by talking about the Genesis act.
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_05: What about Grock?
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_01: I thought you wanted to talk about Grock.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_05: And X there's just so much news.
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_05: I forgot.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_05: Okay.
[00:10:12] Great.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_05: Why don't you kick us off with a what is the Genesis act?
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_01: Well, is the Genesis act new or it's not an act.
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_01: It's called Genesis mission.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_01: The Genesis mission.
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_03: Well, the Genesis act was was created in July and the Genesis mission was
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_03: created a couple days ago.
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_03: Waiter, these related.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_03: I'm not following.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_05: You need to unpack this.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_05: I was wondering why it was called Genesis mission.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_01: It's the strangest name.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_01: I thought that Genesis story was written 45 hundred years ago.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_02: What are we talking about?
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_02: Trump signed an executive order yesterday, which was called the Genesis
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_03: mission.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_03: It's a lot like the Manhattan project.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_03: He is calling a national effort to accelerate scientific
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_03: discovering innovation using AI.
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_03: So we are going to build a shared platform with scientific data,
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_03: leveraging all of our national laboratories and research institutions
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_03: at universities for supercomputers and expertise and focus on
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_03: national challenges, including American energy dominance,
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_03: advancing scientific discovery and national security.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_03: And to be clear, this is all in the Department of Energy.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_01: So this is entirely focused on scientific discovery related to
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_01: nuclear quantum, you know, that realm.
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_01: The DOE is amazing.
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_02: If you guys have read, there's a great book about the DOE and how crazy it is.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_02: Most people don't understand just how crazy the DOE is.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: They don't I don't even think they understand what it is.
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_01: I mean, but I don't even really understand what it is.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_02: And I even read the book on it.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_02: I think that's the whole point of the DOE is it's like this very shadowy,
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_02: but very powerful organization, which by the way,
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_01: we should go into conspiracy corner for some small part of this podcast
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_01: because a new UFO documentary just released.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_01: Oh my goodness.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_05: There's an amazing book called Area 51 and uncensored history of top secret
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_02: military base.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_02: Dave, who you read this book?
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_02: It's fabulous.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_02: I read it at your house.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_02: It's great book.
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_02: Anyway, there's a whole section about how powerful and unknown the DOE is.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_02: Well, the DOE was so just to give everybody the DOE was created
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_01: during the Manhattan Project or directly after it was related to atomic energy
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_01: and the entire management development scientific effort around that
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_01: and the ongoing matrix of activities.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_01: It is the Manhattan.
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to get this wrong.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_02: The whole thing is the DOE is the Manhattan Project.
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_02: It's just kept changing names and like there's all these like special carve outs
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_02: where they get to do things that are like completely like
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_02: inaccessible to the rest of the government.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_02: But it is like what happens every time there's a scandal they just rename it
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_02: and it continues.
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_02: That's basically the upshot, right?
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_01: And that one of the more interesting things is they have all these levels of
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_01: top secret classification that exists outside of the realm of all of the
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: rest of the government's classifications.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_01: And so it's frequently used to keep many things secret that otherwise would be
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_01: accessible.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_01: Britt, do you want to, it seems like you have a reaction to this Genesis thing.
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_05: What is it?
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_05: What's coming up for you?
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_05: Well, so last week Trump posted the Saudi crown prince, right?
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_03: And then I guess he had committed a trillion dollars from the Arab nations.
[00:13:20] And now Trump signed an executive order.
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_05: Guys, isn't it me or is it a trillion?
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_05: Are we so like inoculated to trillion dollars now?
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_05: Like I don't even know what trillions are anymore.
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, what comes after trillions?
[00:13:32] Anyway, I don't know.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_03: I just think that's relevant because we're making an even bigger effort to be
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_03: the weeder in the world.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_03: I can't wait until someone announces some sort of funding for a quintillion dollars.
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_02: Definitely Saudi first, right?
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_05: My bad is Sam Alman.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_05: My bad is Sam Alman.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_05: I'm going to need 15 quintillion dollars.
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_02: I just back to the Genesis act like or Genesis plan or mission.
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_05: I mean, innovation is great.
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, innovation.
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_05: I think and sure there are national security reasons to stay ahead.
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_05: That makes sense to me.
[00:14:08] But it's also completely true that the US and China are one is not going to
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_05: best the other in this war.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_05: I just don't.
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_05: There's just no doubt.
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_05: I made this.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_05: Doesn't that depend on your ideology?
[00:14:23] Well, I mean, just in terms of I was just referring to in terms of technical
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_05: prowess, right?
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_05: Like I wasn't that wasn't a political statement.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_05: That was a like, well, I know, but I'm saying ideologically in in technical land,
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_01: there are a bunch of people who either believe that we're racing towards some sort
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_01: of AI singularity where when you hit this point, you win and all everyone else loses.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_01: It's completely zero sum.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I don't believe that.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_05: So that's what I'm saying is there is a there's a whole ideology in the valley.
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_01: I mean, everywhere around the valley right now that like this is the truth that
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_01: there it's 100% zero sum and whoever gets their first to super super intelligence
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_01: because everyone watched the most recent Tom Cruise mission impossible movie, right?
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_02: Like it's like all the same thing, but it's just a reason to have a race, right?
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_02: I think part of the thing is like people want reasons to have a zero sum race because
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_02: they know what the fun part of zero sum races are.
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_02: You could do whatever you want, right?
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_02: Like if all the stakes, if you basically have a narrative where there's some point or
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_02: something you achieve that is the end of the race, then like nothing else matters.
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_02: And that's really fun, right?
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_02: Because like you just do anything whereas the reality is the more dirty real version,
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_02: but you actually see out like Ukraine, Russia, like real conflict,
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_02: friction, full world is like, that's not how it works.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_02: And it is kind of dirty.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_02: And you don't get to just do it every watt for the sake of a zero sum outcome.
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_02: Rich brings us back to the Department of Energy, which is we've been looking for a Manhattan
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_01: project ever since the Manhattan project.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_01: And so here we are giving a Manhattan project back to the Manhattan project.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_01: But there are so many problems with that analogy.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_05: Like one, the technology is literally bunkered away and in the brains of like six people.
[00:16:14] Here, the technology is literally open source.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_05: I mean, I don't know how many atomic.
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_05: You're saying in the Manhattan project.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_05: And now the technology, like, you know, these models are neck and neck.
[00:16:28] And it's sort of the nature of the technology itself, right?
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_05: I mean, I not that you can't have an advantage, but people were kind of neck and neck
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_02: on nuclear technology.
[00:16:38] SPEAKER_02: The Germans took a wrong turn and like, I think that it was an open source.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_02: Oh, definitely not.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_02: But I'm saying there was like a highly competitive landscape to get there first.
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_02: And the Germans like probably should have and they screwed up, right?
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_02: And like, and then the Americans got there.
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_02: And everyone looked at it.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_02: Like that was a zero sum game.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_02: It played out and it had massive world complications.
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_02: Now what happened?
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_02: What had happened within a few years?
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_02: What happened a few years is that the Russian stole it.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_02: Everyone's the British.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_02: Everyone stole it, right?
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_02: From the Manhattan project and then you went up with this kind of like, you know,
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_02: multi-nation kind of relative balance of power again, right?
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_02: So I don't know.
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_02: It's like, I think the thing is like it's it's almost like too intellectual to think
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_02: about which version of the world this is.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_02: I think people the zero sum game of like race to AGI.
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_02: The question is whether that's like the right analogy, but it's a good story either way, right?
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_02: Well, I've noticed I heard Eric Schmidt say this privately and then I looked it up
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_05: and he said it publicly because I and so I can repeat it.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_05: But he refers to this as the San Francisco consensus.
[00:17:43] And he and it and again, he's now said this multiple times.
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_05: Global macrogeopolitical way to refer to things.
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's such a Schmidt Schmidt T and Schmidt in Schmidt in Schmidt in
[00:17:59] Schmidt in yeah, it's like when people refer for the global south or these sort of, you know,
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_01: Davosian I agree.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_05: But consensus is a great word for that.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_01: But to be clear, he is skeptical of it.
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_05: He is skeptical of it.
[00:18:12] Yeah.
[00:18:12] Is it really this San Francisco consensus?
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_01: Well, this is what he says.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_05: I don't know.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_01: I'm in a surf shaft and he talks to more people about this than I do.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_05: So what's the surf shack consensus?
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_01: What's the Westmer in consensus?
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: I do feel like we're talking about consensus and like genesis missions.
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_05: I do think it's time, guys.
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_05: We need to like plant a flag and define something.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_05: Don't you think people are really good at branding.
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_02: I actually the gene in some ways in some ways I feel like the real era here is like,
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_02: I think the California and Silicon Valley has gotten unbelievably good at marketing.
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_02: Like, it was really changed in the last few years.
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_02: It's just incredible marketing.
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_02: And like, and like there's a whole, I think there is a San Francisco consensus of marketing,
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_02: right?
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_02: That Elon, I think is a major pioneer of this extremely effective.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_02: It's going to think some problems for a free independent and accurate media.
[00:19:08] I think you can go back further, Sam.
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_01: And you could say that when Steve Jobs died, we like forgot how to market.
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_01: And then there was this low.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_01: And then Elon came back with this incredible jobsy and style marketing.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_01: And now everybody's adopted it and marketing is cool again.
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_01: It could be that the actual innovation of Silicon Valley is the greatest fucking marketing in the world.
[00:19:28] But to be clear, what you're talking about in Silicon Valley, getting better at marketing
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_05: is just saying what Silicon Valley hopes to be true or wants people to believe
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_05: and saying it enough times.
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_03: Guys, it's not that we're better at marketing is that we have the mega phones to be good at
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_03: marketing because marketing is only digital these days.
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_03: And like Elon owns one of the biggest channels for distribution and Zuck owns one of the biggest
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_03: channels for distribution.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_03: Sam, who's crushing marketing and tech land every CEO of every one of these companies
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_05: who has the biggest megaphone?
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_05: So just because you have a big megaphone doesn't mean you use it well.
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_05: So who's who's winning?
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_05: Well, I would argue like the Mag seven is like crushing marketing right now.
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_02: Because they have the biggest mega phones.
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_05: The Mag seven is crushing marketing.
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_05: Okay.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_02: And video is crushing marketing.
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_02: Sam Altman's crushing marketing like the private, you know, Sequoia and as you can see,
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_02: is crushing marketing like I would just say that like this is this maybe this is the real
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_02: San Francisco consensus is like there's a set of people have like figured out marketing.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_02: And you know what that means?
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_02: You get all the resources and all the smart people come to the North Bay and all the money.
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_02: And then and then you get all the resources.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_02: But there's are the people with all the resources.
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_03: Tell me someone who doesn't have resources.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_03: That's crushing marketing.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_03: No, but that's the thing you wouldn't you if you didn't have if you if in some ways,
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_02: if you don't have the resources, you're bad at marketing by definition.
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_02: I know.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_05: Here's what's happening.
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_05: I just figured it out guys.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_05: Thank goodness.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_05: No.
[00:21:01] I think what's happening is everyone's finding their tribes.
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_05: So you're finding more messaging that you're like a men to, but it doesn't mean that the
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_05: marketing is inherently good or bad.
[00:21:11] SPEAKER_05: People are just going after their tribes.
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_05: Tham believes all of his marketing is good.
[00:21:17] For my tribe, Jess, you're making my point, which is there is no San Francisco consensus.
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_01: There is a San Francisco consensus about the like a I singularity, but it's not
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_01: everyone's no, I agree.
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_05: I agree.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_05: I think that's true.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_05: But it's not you if you say a it doesn't get a headline.
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_05: So Schmidt has to be first of all, calling something a concept.
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: It's always been a sense is a incredible marketing, right?
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_02: So you're like, I'm just asserting it's the consensus.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_02: It's great.
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_02: You know, Eric Schmidt has always been good at a talking point.
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_05: So he's a great, he's a great marketer.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_02: Is there anything that's a consensus in 2025?
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_02: But that's why you just say the consensus to make it a consensus.
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_02: Well, which is also is why we think everyone's good at marketing because if people just say
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_05: things that we like, we listen to them more and then we think they've nailed marketing.
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_05: But Jess, you just made the key point, which is creator fund oriented.
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_02: It's everything we're seeing, right?
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: Which is this is an era of cults and tribes, right?
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_02: Where you want super fucking core committed group of failings of people that are your true believer followers.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_02: And what you, if you think about it, if last generation marketing was about mass,
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_02: is that getting convincing everyone in America that like, you know, brown here was cool
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_02: through like magazines and you had no targeting.
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_02: The entire story of our era right now is screw that, right?
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_02: It's go find your super deep tribe and there can be lots of them and they fight with each other
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_02: and they overlap.
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_02: But being good at marketing means you have an army behind you, right?
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_02: And you that means you have capital and customers and you pay them in stock go up.
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_02: And all the things which again, you got to get Elon credit.
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_02: He, I've always said this and I mean it to rocket totally and also not is like,
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_02: he's not a great technologist.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_02: He is the greatest marketer of our generation, right?
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_02: And that means he gets all the capital and the people and the things.
[00:23:05] He's also gotten rockets for sure.
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_02: The best marketer, maybe of all time.
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_02: What you need for rockets is a ton of money and rope, right?
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_02: And then people who like were like, I only have one option if I care about the stuff
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_02: because like, by the way, last year we'll love rockets, which is like, I gotta go over for you.
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_02: Like it's an incredible plan.
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_02: You know, Blue Origin landed its rocket.
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_05: It was, you know, on a barge.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_05: So I thought that was pretty, pretty interesting.
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_05: Right.
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_02: They're like the Russians.
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_02: They like the ones who steal the nuclear products out.
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_02: And I also says negatively, but it's like once it's proven, it's like the,
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_02: it's the four minute mile.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_02: Once you prove you can do it, you're going to be able to shave some people out of the thing
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_02: that did it and redo it.
[00:23:43] That's not that hard.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_02: It's hard.
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_02: But like if you have $200 billion of play with you're going to get it done.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_02: But don't you think also, I, so I am still caught.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_05: It is so interesting to me how hard Google the valley, the markets, everyone has swung
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_05: in the last 10 days.
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_05: I'm so sad.
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_02: I definitely need money on this.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_02: I know.
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_05: Sam, I'm sorry.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_05: I'm sorry.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_05: Again, every episode.
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_05: Jess, I'm glad you brought this up because I had a chart ready for this.
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_01: Thank God, Dave, someone who keeps me honest, which by the way, it has another great
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_01: concept in it, which is the Google complex versus the open AI complex complex.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_05: The complex is not as cool as a consensus, but still pretty good.
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_05: I agree.
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_05: You kind of want both.
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_01: So like this is amazing.
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_01: This is the, the difference in price performance between the Google complex and the open AI
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_01: complex co-tube put this out like two hours ago.
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_01: Dave, explain what you're seeing for those that are only listening.
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_03: There's just two lines to, you know, the performance of the Google complex, which is
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_01: Google, Broadcom, Lamentum, TTM technologies, and then the open AI complex, which is NVIDIA,
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_01: Softbank, Oracle, AMD, Microsoft, Core, we've, et cetera.
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_01: So it's percent increase is one year price performance.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_05: And it's tracking and they sort of through the first half of the year through May
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_05: are, are pretty in concert.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_05: Then they both start rising through August and then they diverge.
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_05: They've urged rapidly within the last two weeks and then the last two weeks.
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_05: Well, here.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_05: So this is relevant.
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_05: You know, there's been a lot of speculation.
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_05: We've talked about how Google's TPUs are going to challenge NVIDIA and my colleagues
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_05: at the information wrote a story very recently that had two new data points.
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_05: One metas considering and in very serious talks over a billions of dollars, spending
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_05: billions of dollars on TPUs in a future deal.
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_05: And then there's also we had new details about pitches, Google's making to banks, about
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_05: using them.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_05: And what's different about this is you wouldn't be accessing them through Google's
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_05: infrastructure and Google Cloud.
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_05: These would be models where you're selling or renting to other data centers more directly
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_05: competitive.
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_05: And you know, there's been a lot of chatter about this.
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_05: But I think the story was the first to show two new data points really on how Google plans
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_05: to get these to market in a different way.
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_05: And I don't know if you guys saw this, but a day or a couple hours afterwards in
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_05: NVIDIA tweeted out speaking of marketing a statement.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_05: We are delighted by Google's success.
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_05: They made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_05: NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry.
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_05: It's the only platform that runs every model and does it everywhere.
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_05: Computing is done.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_05: NVIDIA offers greater performance for subtility and fungibility than ASICs, which are
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_05: designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_02: You know, that's not great marketing.
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_02: I was going to say great or not great.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_05: I saw a tweet.
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_05: Everyone's tweeting like isn't video okay?
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_03: Well, that our Elon or Sam Altman, they would just be like, yeah, Google things that's
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_03: winning, but we're we're going to be the real winners here.
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_03: Like they would just say something ridiculous.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_03: They'd be like two shades.
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_03: Stay tuned.
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:09] But they're being classy with their PR.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_03: That's their first mistake or old school.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_03: I don't know. Is it classy or just old school?
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_03: Look, you know, it sounds like it sounds like there's two words in versions of the world.
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_02: You need a pre-Trumpian era.
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_02: What you'd say is actually if you're in Vini, you kind of need one or two legit
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_02: serious competitors.
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_02: You're going to get antitrusted.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_02: And so you're like, okay.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_02: Like I actually want someone to fast follow me pretty closely so that I can point
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_02: at them and be like, see, I'm not a monopoly.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_02: And so like that would be like the old way of thinking.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_02: I think the new way of thinking is they're like, I don't know.
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_02: They're like, they need new marketing people because like that's clearly not the story.
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_02: Now look, the interesting thing is most, my understanding is like a lot of companies
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_02: are already using TPUs as well through Google.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_02: Like a lot of the next, like it's not like this isn't like a new, yeah.
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_02: So like it's a change in business strategy or model from the say you can just like,
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_02: but it's like, that's the thing is like everyone's like, Google's already very deeply in the game.
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_02: Here are people are used to using TPUs, right?
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_02: Well, I also think that you got to caveat this a little bit in that they're familiar
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_05: with some aspects of them, but not they're, you know, the old problem again of the software stack
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_05: and CUDA and videos.
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_05: So and data centers of different designs.
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_05: So this isn't like a you flip a switch, but we reported that Google thinks
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_05: they can get 10% of in video's business revenue, right?
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_05: Which means they actually think they can get 20% and they're going to undershoot it.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_02: This is what they actually think.
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_02: So it's a real, I just love, I mean, I love trying to analyze companies PR
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_05: particularly because they deal with us one way and then you know, six hours later,
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_05: they deal with the public another way.
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_05: And part of me is like, okay, speak your mind of video, tell your story, put your statement out there.
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_05: You mean like you should have a better story.
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_01: It's like their meme game is weak.
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_01: They didn't need to have meme game sound.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_01: Like they were winning the product race up until like two weeks ago.
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_01: This is what happens when you're too far ahead, you get lazy and you know,
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_02: your your your weapons are not refined.
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_02: I don't think they're lazy.
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_05: Jensen is the most paranoid CEO of all of them, which is saying a lot.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_05: It's like, look, if you're if you're marketing team has been like,
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_02: I don't need to ship the last two years because like the product sells itself.
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_02: Then like by like you get lazy, you just you don't have the war muscle.
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_02: And then when something comes up, you're not like ready to go, right?
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_02: And this is like not ready to go tweet.
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_02: Like that to me feels like what's going on here is that, you know,
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_01: we've seen this narrative shift over the last two to three weeks where people
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_01: are actually starting to ask questions about this entire supply chain, right?
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_01: Like how much do these chips cost?
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_01: Are they going to be able to have business models sitting on top of them?
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_01: What's the depreciation?
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_01: Like there's like a real sort of financial analysis starting to happen.
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_01: In the last really, it's like that chart.
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_01: I want a t-shirt that says what's the depreciation to great t-shirt.
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_02: I've told you guys my Gavin Baker quote, we interviewed him in April.
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_05: And someone asked him the depreciation of a GPU and he said, what's the meaning of life?
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_05: I thought that was a great quote.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_05: Oh, boy.
[00:30:11] Yeah, I mean, there's not a podcast that this hasn't been debated on in the last two weeks.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_01: But I don't know.
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_01: I think it's all vibes.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_05: Like I sort of ribbed the journal for like, you know, the day after Nvidia earnings,
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_05: their lead story on the front page was,
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_05: Nvidia results put to rest bubble fears.
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_05: And the next day, it was exactly the opposite.
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_05: Like they had reversed every word in the headline.
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_05: And that doesn't mean, it just means you can't analyze this every 24 hours is what it means, right?
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_05: But they're paying to analyze it every time, like it's selling the newsstand.
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_02: What's the paper boy?
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_02: What's the paper boy going to sell?
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_02: I know.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_05: We're about to get a second print newspaper, everyone who's tracking the print newspaper.
[00:30:56] I just think the numbers are getting extremely large.
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_01: And people are actually starting, like, you know, I saw this, I saw this letter from an LP letter from a fund that I'm an investor in that used the number of seconds to contextualize this.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_01: And I really liked it.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_01: One million seconds is roughly 12 days.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_01: One billion seconds is 32 years.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_01: 500 billion seconds is 15,000 years.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_01: How is this useful to you?
[00:31:22] It's just the scale of the dollars is insane, like until until like if you look, if you think about the 2010s, right, Uber raised something on the order, it was like 40 billion or something like that, which was insane, which was insane at the time, right?
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: And so the numbers that we're looking at are just really, really nuts.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_01: And the revenue isn't there.
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_01: And so I think people are actually like, that's what started to happen in the last two or three weeks is people are starting to be like, where are we going to get margin from is the inference going to, you know, cost come down.
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_01: Is it not going to like is TPU better for that is GPU better for that?
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_01: I think everyone's just looking over their shoulder and doing what the next guys do.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_05: I agree with everything you're saying about the uncertainty, but I think it's so uncertain that like you can't explain the market by like,
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_05: and now people are looking at this and now people are looking at that.
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_05: I think they're just reading the room.
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_05: And when no one can read the room, they're panicking.
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_05: I look at I can I give a different spin on it.
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_02: Here's what I really I actually think a lot of this gets back to politics, right?
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_02: And like it like from a local here's what happened from my perspective.
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_02: For the first, you know, whatever like half of the year, we had a two problem, Trump in control, pretty doing just Trump land, right?
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_02: Like no challenges to it.
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_02: And everyone understands debt overhang must make GDP go up story.
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_02: So I was like, look, we don't this all fucking crazy, but Trump will make sure we all.
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_02: To be like, Trump will make sure we get paid, right?
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_02: Like we're going to get paid somehow.
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_02: Like I'm like, not stressed about it because like, and we'll just cut it.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_02: It will cut interest rates.
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_02: Whatever.
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_02: We'll just do what has to be done to make number go up.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_02: And so I was like, we don't this analysis is all crazy, right?
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_02: Like this whole, you know, whatever we're going to have a Chinese has you.
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_02: Whatever, but it's kind of doesn't matter because if it works, it works.
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_02: And you get the gods scenario.
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_02: If it doesn't work, we'll still get paid, right?
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_02: Like I think the narrative broke a little bit with the midterms where I was like,
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_02: ooh, like Trump less in control, right?
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_02: And like if Trump less in control, then all of a sudden the analysis of like how we have to evaluate this completely changes, right?
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_02: Because always I'm like, okay, this is a lot of money.
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_02: And like there is downside risk here as opposed to being like a free upside option, right?
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_02: Is the way I would look at it.
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_02: So I think this is a political economy story that's playing out in tech more than anything else.
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_02: And then you have like Google firing up and blah, blah, blah.
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_02: So I just think you have to contextualize it in that context.
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_02: Sam, I agree with you.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_01: And I think that was the crewgment take two or three days ago.
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_01: And if you look at that chart, I should go find it.
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the fall in the crypto markets is directly related to the midterm elections.
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it happened almost in lockstep,
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_01: which you could argue is the Trump trade unwinding.
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_01: Quotanquil.
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah, I just know it's, I don't even know, I'm winding.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_02: I just think it's like ultimately the irony of the crypto stuff is it's the ultimate risk on asset, right?
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_02: And like, so it's going to be the first thing people pull from effective.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, totally.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: But I think your case, I think your argument that you just made is, you know, that the Meg 7 follows crypto.
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_01: And so I think if you overlay all of these charts, like you see the risk, well, it's just risk on this happening across the curve.
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:34:39] But you know, it's just, it's not clear where it goes from here.
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I think I do just think the macro story is even more important than anything's coming on specifically in the tech world.
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_02: And I think, you know, again, like if you, I've always said that if you want to invest in the AI narrative, the easiest bet in the world is meta,
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_02: because it's all upside, no downside.
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_02: I stand by that.
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_02: You know, I think that's continued to continue to do the case in like that doesn't even matter if they spend tens of billions of dollars on the wrong stuff.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_02: If that happens, it doesn't affect the overall story.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_02: I think Google is the interesting one because it was, there was a serious downside case, right, which is the core, core search business.
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_02: There was all these positives, but there was also this like big bogey to the negative.
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_02: I think you were gotten comfortable that the bogey to the negative probably isn't going to play out or at least not dramatically, right?
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_02: That's the place where it's not going to go to dramatic shift tomorrow.
[00:35:26] And they just have so many weapons.
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_02: I think they've gone more than comfortable, Sam.
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_01: I think you look at that chart from co-to and within the last two weeks, people's entire narrative on Google has shifted into the positive.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_01: Well, that was related to Gemini 3 though, right?
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_01: But narratives can ship back.
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_05: I'm curious what Brit thinks because Brit, you have you found, what are you using chat, GPT 4?
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_03: Guys, I switched.
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_03: In the last two weeks, I have become primarily a Gemini, not GPT.
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_03: I know.
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_03: Well, and again, I will say every episode that I called...
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_03: Oh, well, I'm using...
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_03: Here's the problem.
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_03: Here's the problem of switching.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_03: GPT has the memory of all my preferences and all these things I've brainstormed about and I've been brainstorming.
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_03: Do you know that many preferences?
[00:36:19] I do.
[00:36:21] I have a...
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_03: You should see this stuff that I talked to GPT about in Gemini.
[00:36:25] SPEAKER_03: But like, so I feel like I'm in a transition period where I'm trying to get Gemini up to speed on who I am and how I like my stuff
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_03: and all the things I'm thinking about and working on.
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_03: You're going through an AI breakup, is what you're saying?
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_01: Well, I wish I would have like an intake form.
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_03: Or I guess I could export.
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_03: Hello, it's your entire Google search history, all your Gmail, your calendar.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_03: Can I export my GPT into my Gemini?
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_03: Okay, I might just...
[00:36:52] SPEAKER_03: Well, no, you can't export it in, but you can get it out.
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_01: But I'm sure they make the file really awful and not readable.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_01: Well, I want to do that.
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_05: It really doesn't matter, Bray.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_05: It does, my.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_05: It does matter, dude.
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_02: The format, not in the arrow of GPT.
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_02: This is my thing.
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_02: Twitter does.
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_02: In the era of...
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_02: There was this era where everyone was trying to implement GDPR, right?
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_02: And like, download your data, which is ridiculous.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_02: And everyone was like, okay, cool.
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_02: We'll give you the file format.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_02: We're going to make them so unusable and broken, we technically comply.
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_02: But good luck doing anything with the data you've downloaded.
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_02: That did work.
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_02: But guess what?
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_02: Because I've done this.
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_02: In an era of chat, it's so easy.
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_02: Because you're basically like, hey, Gemini, hey, whenever.
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_02: Here's my entire Twitter download your data file, which is intentionally broken.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_02: Or my entire whatever file just fix it and use it.
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_02: And it's great.
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_02: I don't think that'll work, Sam.
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_02: I also think the chat GPT memory is a liability.
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_05: For...
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_05: I understand how the concept of memory is important.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_05: But in practice, I'll ask it about some physical element.
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_05: And it will be like, well, because you asked me about another physical element last week.
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_05: I'm like, no, they're not related.
[00:38:00] SPEAKER_05: Like, don't try and prove to me.
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_05: You remembered last week.
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_05: Like, it's an entirely different issue.
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_05: So I find it's not...
[00:38:08] SPEAKER_05: I think you can move on.
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_05: I do think this is the stuff, though.
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_01: This is the battleground.
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_01: Because people are not going to...
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_01: Same as like, you don't switch between Apple photos and Google photos because you've
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_01: just got all of your photos over there.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_01: And it's a pain in the ass to move it.
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_01: Like, it is actually a pain in the ass, Sam.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_01: Like, I get conceptually...
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_01: I get conceptually where you're coming from.
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_01: Like, you're right, technically.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_01: However, the devil is in the details in that in order to export everything out of chat
[00:38:36] SPEAKER_01: GPT, it's an enormous amount of text.
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_01: It's like a huge file.
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_01: Like, you can't just download that into Gemini.
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_01: Like, it's not possible.
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_01: The text is not...
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_02: The photos is interesting because it's literally like trucking around the files.
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_02: It's just like a lot of bandwidth.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_02: Like, that is an actually interesting lock-in.
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_02: I just went and chat GPT.
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_02: I said, I'm moving to Gemini.
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_02: I can give me a full rundown of my preferences, you know, etc.
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_02: So I can use Gemini as well as you.
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_02: It's like, absolutely.
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_02: Here's a clean, safe, high-single rundown of your preferences styles for any AI work
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_02: with you.
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_02: It contains...
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_03: It's just my preferences, though.
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_03: It's all the things I brainstormed.
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_01: It's not...
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_01: It's not the preferences.
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_01: It's all the data.
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_01: Ugh.
[00:39:12] So much data.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_02: It's not how he's did it.
[00:39:14] SPEAKER_02: Text is small.
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_02: Text is small.
[00:39:16] Just, you have to choose because this is the war, right?
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_01: Like, keeping people...
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_01: No, that's the narrative of the war.
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_02: I don't think so, Sam.
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_01: Like, I'm the user of these things.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_01: And I do see that Gemini 3 is good.
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_01: But, chat GPT knows a lot more about how I think what I've been thinking about.
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_01: The war will be won.
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_05: What do you guys think?
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_05: The war...
[00:39:38] SPEAKER_05: I don't know if I believe this, but I say the war will be won.
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_05: With the easiest hardware access, which is where the world is going.
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_05: I don't agree.
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_01: With a war...
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_01: Distribution.
[00:39:49] That's it.
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_01: I just think that this is a real thing that being able to talk freely to these things
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_01: with a good user interface that remembers who you are, understands as much about you as possible
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_01: and then gives you the best answer.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_01: Like, Jess, the fact that it didn't understand that those two ailments were different is a problem, right?
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_01: Like, but they're going to solve that problem, at least if you believe their narratives at all about their research stream.
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_01: And so, the better it knows you, the more it can answer questions for you.
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_01: Listen, I literally built the original theory of when I went to Facebook to work on profiles to get over exactly this.
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_02: The only lock in is going to be memory when you get better at exposing memory.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_02: That was the whole thesis.
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_02: I'll tell you, I don't think it's...
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_02: I think intellectual is correct.
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_02: You get down to the practicality of how people use these things and their actual preferences and whatever.
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_02: It just doesn't play out that way.
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_02: It's not as much of a lock in as you want it to be.
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_02: I guess, like, I'm just...
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_01: I'm going off my own personal experience, which is that I don't want to switch, because it knows more.
[00:40:51] Guys, it's 2025.
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_05: It is so early.
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_05: I really believe that.
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_05: Like, and I do...
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_05: To defend my hardware point, I just find increasingly the friction of picking up my phone, clicking through to the app,
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_05: instead of just talking to something, whether it's my phone or...
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_05: Well, that's the meta case.
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_02: That's your meta thesis.
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_02: Is impeding my usage.
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_05: And what I really want, you know, I was in downtown Burley game.
[00:41:19] Fun fact, there are two downtown Burley games.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_05: Who knew?
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_05: What?
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_01: I learned this the other day.
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_01: In old downtown Burley game.
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_05: And I instantly just wanted to know, like, what is the history of these two Burley games?
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_05: Like, you know, as a mid-predence-low resident, I need to know this information.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_05: I didn't want to know enough to, like, click into my phone, decide if I was going to type, decide if I was going to use the automatic dictation.
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_05: I just want to know.
[00:41:48] Like, I think those are going to be the use cases.
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_05: That's a long meta case, because basically that's why you have glasses, that's why you're trying to get.
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_02: And by the way, what you're saying is that information...
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_02: It's a long new form factor, yeah.
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_02: But my, the interesting thing about that is it's not...
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_02: I don't know, man.
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's long meta.
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_02: Meta is like...
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_02: Keep going.
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_02: I just say, like, look, to me, I'd say that information, which is super fucking commodity information.
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_02: Like, no, no LLM is going to have a dramatic...
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_05: Correct.
[00:42:18] SPEAKER_05: This does not require an LLM.
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_02: Leg up on like, wire their two Burley.
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_02: This is easy.
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_02: So if actually most of the story is effectively Alexa 2.0, where Alexa actually works, right?
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_02: Or it's like, these are not hard questions.
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_02: Most of human questions are not hard questions, right?
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_02: Everyone's willing to answer them.
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_02: There's no technical mode from that perspective.
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_02: It's literally just who's closest to the person's face.
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_02: Then like, the correct strategy is to race to the face.
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_02: I like that.
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_02: Race to the face.
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I just don't think this captures the nuance.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_01: Like, go ask all of these systems.
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: Ask Meta.
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_01: What do you know about me?
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_01: Question mark.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_01: If you go ask all the four main systems or five, the same question, the context is wildly
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_01: different.
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_01: Meta knows literally nothing.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_01: Like, they don't have...
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_01: They don't have any contextually relevant information about you.
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_05: Dave, Sam is not arguing for the superiority of their AI.
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_05: I think of Meta's AI.
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_05: I think he's...
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_05: No, I'm just saying if the race is just the race is just the interface, here's my thing though.
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_02: And this is an interesting question.
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_02: Is how nuanced really are humans?
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_02: The easy answer is we're all snowflakes and we're all super special.
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_02: And like, therefore, Dave, you're...
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_02: And by the way, Dave and for you guys have specific tastes.
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_02: I believe that you're in the 1% of special people.
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_02: But I actually think most people are like not that...
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_02: Oh, thanks, Sam.
[00:43:38] I'll be a snowflake.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_03: I think you have a lot of preferences.
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_02: Like, the reality is it's like...
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_02: A.K.A. where aggro.
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_03: No, it's like...
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_02: It's Coke or Pepsi.
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_02: Like, it's just not that complicated.
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_02: And I think if you just like strip it back for the vast majority of cases of people,
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_02: it's like all this personalization content doesn't matter.
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_02: I think we're talking past each other.
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're talking about six different things.
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_05: But can we talk about hardware for a sec?
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_05: Because Emerson Collectives demo day, Lauren Powell Jobs is...
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_05: They have a demo day?
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_02: What?
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_05: One demo day.
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_03: I've been...
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_03: How does everyone have a demo day now?
[00:44:13] SPEAKER_03: Can we consolidate the demo days?
[00:44:15] I'm going to do a demo day.
[00:44:17] Oh, fuck.
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_03: I'm going to do a demo day after your demo day.
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_03: There are no days left on the calendar between your etiquette classes,
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_04: your demo days, your protests.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_04: What's your protest, by the way?
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_04: I don't know why, it's...
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_02: Oh, I cannot believe I forgot.
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_02: I forgot my shirt.
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_02: I know, Sam.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_01: It's okay.
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_01: We can do it next time.
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_05: But guys, breaking news.
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_05: And I'm going to give this one to Brett.
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_05: Breaking news.
[00:44:42] Johnny and Sam have settled on a prototype, which they will tell us in two years.
[00:44:48] SPEAKER_05: Two years?
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_05: Two years?
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_01: No.
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_01: Okay, guys.
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_01: This is not what happened yesterday.
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_01: I watched this.
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_01: This is not what happened.
[00:44:57] That's not what happened?
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_05: No.
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_01: He said it would be ready in two years.
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: No, they didn't.
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_01: There was a bunch of Lauren Powell Jobs trying to get Johnny to pin down a timeline.
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_01: And he said, I can't talk about that.
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_01: You can probably get more out of Sam than me.
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_01: And then Lauren said, then she said, well, is it five years?
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_01: And he's like, no, no, no, no, much earlier than that.
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_01: She said two years.
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_01: And he said probably earlier than that.
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_01: And it was not a like, you're going to get this in two years kind of conversation.
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_01: Dave, I'm glad you went to the source.
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_03: So what do you think, Dave?
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_03: Is this one year?
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_03: When does this ship?
[00:45:36] No, you know, I thought that their conversation was quite cool personally.
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_01: And I thought that their conversation was very interesting.
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_01: Like, I think that the way that Sam actually framed the problem was kind of cool.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_01: He was talking about what did he say?
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_03: I didn't see this.
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_03: He's a great marketer.
[00:45:53] SPEAKER_02: He was just talking about that they went to Johnny and were like, hey, we don't really know what to do.
[00:46:02] SPEAKER_01: We have this new type of computer that can reason and think.
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_01: And it's clear that it should be better suited for different kinds of interfaces.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_01: But we have literally no idea what to make.
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_01: And so could we work with you?
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_01: And Johnny was like, give me three billion dollars.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_01: The other thing that I liked about what they talked about is that they talked about the state of the current internet.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: And that the internet and modern technology has really led us into this kind of attention economy where, you know, advertising is the ruling model.
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_01: Because of that, the feeling of using most of the modern internet is like Times Square.
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_01: And they want to create something that's kind of the opposite that, you know, is more quiet.
[00:46:49] It gives you more the feeling of like being in nature next to a lake or something like that.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_01: And I like that analogy that that is perhaps the opportunity of AI that we might be able to create a better computing feeling.
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_01: I think we're just going to make way better ads.
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_01: I thought it was interesting.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_01: Well, I also think and I don't want to belabor this point and obviously, but I am interested.
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_05: Lauren is clearly in team open AI in this in this battle playing out.
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_05: And that, you know, she has had long standing obviously relationships with all men.
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_05: And it's all relational.
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_05: But I think it's interesting.
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_05: And I do think that there's a time when it would have been awkward for her to, you know, be so openly endorsing what open AI is doing.
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_05: Given it's aiming right for the heart of Apple.
[00:47:43] SPEAKER_05: And I just think it's interesting that she's deciding it's not awkward for her to do that right now.
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_05: And I have theories on why that I probably can't speculate about.
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_05: But I viewed this event as sort of the coming out of her allegiances in some way.
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_05: Not that her investment was a secret.
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_05: It wasn't not that her relationship with jibot.
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_05: Tim is her best friend or a very, very close friend.
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_05: So to do something this publicly was notable.
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_05: I think if you look at the overarching themes of the events, they present a very humanist worldview in opposition to kind of highly chaotic.
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_01: Political world, social world, you know, et cetera.
[00:48:29] And so a lot of what I think she was trying to pull out of them was this very human, more humanist view of what computing might be and that the ability to be, you know, calm, contextual, proactive without being intrusive.
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_01: You know, they talked a lot about joy and simplicity and being human centered.
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: But all of that's marketing day of right like I don't think that it is. It's a design philosophy.
[00:49:01] SPEAKER_05: It is a design philosophy and it's designed to like which is marketing. No, it's design philosophy.
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_01: That's products you and not marketing. No, but it is like, and I admire that design philosophy.
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_05: I think it's a cool design philosophy. But it's also like she's tugging on the heartstrings of the people who believe it while most people are going to decide if it's just a better product or not.
[00:49:24] SPEAKER_05: Well, and just just be clear, I want to go back in the history of Apple and the whole relationship between design and marketing.
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_02: Do you really say I'm because look at who's on the other side of the podcast here.
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_05: No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm actually wanting to hear these guys talk about this. One of the interesting things about Apple when you talk about is it marketing or is it product is Apple is the rare tech company where marketing is super freaking powerful and way more powerful than like the product managers on teams.
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_02: Right. Like Apple is driven by the marketing department. No, I think that's a that's a that's a misunderstanding of how Apple works. Explain explain how works because the way it's always been explained to me is that Apple is the rare company where marketing is super powerful and like actually in Google or Facebook
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_02: and places like that. But the marketing are very unpowerful. I've worked at Google and Apple. So explain it, Brett. They were equally as powerful. Go ahead, Brett. I would say at Google engineers are king and queen.
[00:50:18] SPEAKER_03: Like for sure, it's about the code. It's about how fast it is. It's about the A B test of like conversion rate percentages at like 100th of a percentage point.
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_03: The analytical. This is all 10 years in the in the rear of your mirror, but that's how it was. Sure. Fine. I think at Apple, it is like product design, which inherently becomes marketing and engineering. But it's about what is the form factor. How are people going to use it?
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_03: It's about the customer and the customers delight in this thing. It's about Steve saying like we want to build the bicycle for the mind. We want to like unleash human capabilities through the devices we're creating.
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_03: And of course that becomes marketing too, but it starts at the design and the product beyond that. Apple is completely human centric in its world view.
[00:51:08] SPEAKER_01: And the marketing Sam to your point is in service of a business model that requires literally selling a physical, you know, a physical object to someone right like since the beginning of Apple.
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_01: They had to go to conferences and trade shows and make a better designed product through and through and design is not how it looks. It's not the aesthetic design is how it works. Right.
[00:51:33] SPEAKER_02: I'm just saying I'm not saying I just think Apple starts from I think in my understanding of you, you got I never worth there. But like the way it was always explained to me is that Apple was the tech company.
[00:51:43] SPEAKER_02: We think about the religion of your products and whatever marketing was the most empowered right and the most powerful as a relative one.
[00:51:49] SPEAKER_02: It plays like Facebook or meta back in the day. Marketing was not powerful at all. Right. Like it had no role. Right. They were like the fifth person you call maybe well, I think you're lumping together marketing.
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_05: You're lumping together a bunch of things right. So there's like depends on what you mean by that product marketing is different than marketing.
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_03: Okay, fine. Fine. We'll talk about product marketing as opposed to it. Facebook. We had product marketing and product management.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_02: Product marketing was not important. Right. Like that was like an afterthought on a relative basis. Right. Whereas that Apple was very important. So when you talk about its product centric that I think is worth noting.
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_02: Look at the history of errors in collective and how these things fit together comes from a legacy with Steve Jobs that really put marketing and storytelling first right in a way.
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_02: And I'm not saying that negatively. I'm just saying that as a strategy so that when you then look at how immersed in collective or how the narrative comes maybe that's coming through Sam Altman, etc.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_02: It's not unsurprising to be like we're a storytelling company first from that perspective.
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_02: I agree with everything everyone's saying. I'm just not sure it matters because I think like people are well, I guess I'm wrestling with why it matters right.
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_02: Why why matters is when you look at something like this story with Johnny and Sam and the narrative of human centric computing and like what's that that's all narrative right and then like you fit products into that narrative.
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_02: I'm not saying that's a bad way to do it. I'm seeing it different right. Yeah, you have companies have cultures they have you know and they have them for a lot of reason.
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_05: I think it's also the business model the business model of open AI and the business model of Apple are the same and I've been making this argument on the podcast for a long time.
[00:53:20] SPEAKER_01: They're clearly not the same. They're exactly the opposite.
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_02: Let just give me a second like the my point a long time ago was that this is a you know open AI is selling computer quote unquote right like people buy open AI they buy chat GPT pro like they buy an iPhone.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_01: You use it you pay for it. It is not an advertising driven model today. It might be in the future. I don't know but they have to do marketing like Apple does marketing because they're selling a literally selling a product that does something both utilitarian and gives people a feeling of joy when they use it, which is the identical thing that Apple does.
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_01: This will be interesting because if that is the thing that you believe which I'm not criticizing. If you believe that is their philosophy what we're actually going to see over AI on the consumer side is a literal business model war right because that is not what Google is running a certain amount of matters right now.
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_02: I know. I think that is what's going on. So Dave here's what you should do Dave.
[00:54:18] Dave you need to go sit down with Kate Roush CMO of open AI who's wonderful and convinced her of that because that is not the playbook open AI is running right now open AI wants us to think their meta like explicitly everything that they're saying public and privately is to compete with meta they're talking about time because there's a lot of meta people working there including Kate.
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_01: Literally everyone there is from meta.
[00:54:49] SPEAKER_01: Fiji still it's insane a lot of our old friends from meta work there by the way can we just like put a pan in the fact that meta the meta mafia is actually the mafia in this town and nobody talks about it.
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_01: We could circle back to it as but as meta mafia so as I'm not sure you can weigh it on that you can't talk about it yeah you're two bias sure we can.
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_01: Paypal talks about itself it's worth thinking about this because Dave you have been very consistent about your vision of open AI is a computer I thought it was a smart point when you made it six months ago and every time since that is not how they think about themselves right now their CFO is on call with investors talking about time spent and changing content moderation there CEO of apps is sub stacking about group chat right and to build your community pull your network into the
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_05: business of the market and then you can go to this their own advertising is sort of going head head with Google search with like recipes and how to do pull ups would based on ads I saw that I was confused by but that's not how they're making money today and that's also not how their CEO is talking about it on stage two days ago well but that's a huge disconnect because that is a huge problem but we started this by talking about the interview that was going on on stage so I'm yeah I'm glad you want and I'm glad you watch the interview also relative to this point.
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_05: We published a memo we could show ago or details from a memo quotes from memo in which Sam Altman ahead of the Gemini launch but clearly when the team had been testing it needed to rally his troops and he said the vibes are going to be tough out there for a while.
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_05: He also said it sucks that we have to do so many hard things at one time and many other things that you can read on the information but I was struck by it because.
[00:56:43] I mean it was fine it's sort of like a tune out the noise and execute but there was definitely a nervousness to it they're trying to do everything they're literally trying to be Google apple and meta all at one but he is a point of pride for him.
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_05: He uses that is a rally cry I get it.
[00:57:03] SPEAKER_03: And I think he needs to he's sticking to his long term vision that's what he should do as a CEO I don't actually think anything is wrong with the way he framed that and I do think there will be short term a lot of misses because.
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_03: Jim and I and others are executing really well and have more resources but they have a long term vision and better business models I think this comes down to this business model question which is everything that we're talking about all of these random activities that we're.
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_01: Listing out over and over again are them trying to find a bigger business model than the one that currently exists like that's the like real truth because they have to justify a half a trillion dollar valuation and figure out to get more money to buy the things to fight all the wars at once yes right now they do two things they sell computer to people and they sell computer to business well to be clear they sell very little of either I mean it's a lot of revenue but not to not compared to the old competing with yes I understand.
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_01: Guys what they're selling as a computer is pretty much available for free we can quibble on the margins but the free version of Gemini is the number of people who are going to find the difference so that is a big problem that's a little problem that's a big problem yes which is why we're talking about this dissonance right it makes sense that the troops are talking about.
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_01: Literally the meta business model right because the underlying hope not current reality is that they're going to be able to generate a ton of engagement and apps like group chat and many many others probably productivity probably health probably like everything that will then convert into a attention based business model just like meta right with that's just to push you that is the opposite of the apple business model I understand it's also the opposite of what sam said on stage yeah.
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_05: I think Dave is arguing for that they should change their strategy and and hark and align it more with the spirit of Sam's on stage interview I'm not sure Jess I I'm not like this is a very complex problem I don't.
[00:59:08] SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to correctly communicate what Sam was talking about what was going on at this Emerson collective thing as well as these apple questions I don't know how to solve the business model problem which comes back to Matt.
[00:59:19] SPEAKER_01: The macro right Sam knows is Sam knows his audience we talked last week about if chat GPT is the clean next of a category but it turns out that that isn't the category per se right and that the distribution model is going to be more distributed is going to be through these other products and and I think that kind of sums up the dilemma just do you have data on how much like like how do we think about this in terms of who's.
[00:59:49] SPEAKER_01: Using which product in at what scale like who has the best data on that like how many.
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_01: D. A. U. of chat GPT is there versus Gemini versus Grock versus and Thropic versus.
[01:00:01] SPEAKER_01: I haven't looked at the latest but Gemini and chat GPT both have huge numbers without a doubt but like how is it is it like one billion on chat GPT versus 400 million on.
[01:00:15] SPEAKER_01: Gemini like that was what I remember last seeing somewhere but I didn't know how accurate the data's are.
[01:00:21] I would have to compare but my sense is very healthy engaged hundreds of hundreds of millions very active but that's like the difference between meta or Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat right like meta was always north of a billion D. A. U.s.
[01:00:37] SPEAKER_01: Twitter and Snapchat were multi hundreds of millions but I think the trajectory matters more it's like because you don't.
[01:00:44] SPEAKER_05: Haven't really been like comparable products and again look chat GPT could.
[01:00:50] If we wake up and open AI has you know some new AI breakthrough that gets us closer to that San Francisco consensus that could change the game again I think it would change it versus shorter window but it could again right so.
[01:01:05] SPEAKER_05: Well this is the point is there's no lock in right is like is all the key to you only can to changes it which is it was the original pitch was that we're so close to this like game over a new clear style outcome that sound will get to first and then there's things locked everyone else locked out right and like that's not going to happen.
[01:01:21] SPEAKER_02: Back to the thing that we were somewhat talking packs each other about I don't think you can claim that there's 0% lock in I think that memory not preferences memory.
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_01: Provide some level of lock in yeah it's not zero yeah do you think wearables are going to add more of a lock in like if if we are measuring all of our daily one of itself no I think we've got to get back to the every man here like I think we have to.
[01:01:50] SPEAKER_05: I don't know what analogy we're in but it's like we've been through this like hardcore power user.
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_05: Faze of and story telling things but just that's why I'm asking you the DA you number because I think I think it was Sam said or you guys may be quoted in an article said something like.
[01:02:07] SPEAKER_01: Chatchy PT is AI to most people and I don't know how true that is right like if it's true that most of the DA you like in the world right now is in chat GPT every day it's not I don't think it is.
[01:02:23] I would just like to know what the number is noted will get back to there was an era where most of the most of the world.
[01:02:31] SPEAKER_02: A well was the internet right and like if they had a lot of lock in in a lot of different ways and you know what it just doesn't matter long term I'm also not sure.
[01:02:42] I'm not sure you want to be AI to the world to our conversation last week I think I think that is an open question don't you just want to be like free shipping cool stuff faster answers to the world and free isn't that what you want to be a man I the idea that you like you know what actually wants to buy a computer right they want the outcomes from a computer.
[01:03:02] I think this is like the key thing it turns out it might be that in chat GPT is clean acts but like clean acts is like the plague right and like you're like I actively don't want.
[01:03:14] Okay that's a bit harsh I will also say as we wrap this segment and perhaps this pod yeah I want to go to the pool.
[01:03:25] I'm sick of the surfshad I want to get the sonner of the pool I also am like not ready to like short open AI.
[01:03:31] SPEAKER_05: Despite everything I said like yeah I guess that's why I'm trying to get to this question just which is like well I guess I short it I short it beyond like to some degree.
[01:03:42] SPEAKER_05: You know below its current valuation yes but I would not it's not going to zero it's not going to zero and so I know well someone will buy it so I think that's really interesting and there's a real puzzle in front of them I just there are certain queries I prefer them for to Gemini.
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_05: They have a much more straightforward style Gemini is so long winded I want like Gemini short Gemini TLDR and you know they've got a lot to play with to do some cool stuff but the ball is in their court again and these things swing.
[01:04:17] These things are not going to zero because if nothing else they're taking dollars and turning into 20 cents worth of infrastructure right so the zero is not a number right like I sell you if I sell you 20 cents of infrastructure for a dollar and I take the difference like fine it's in I also say shorting.
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_02: In anything or in Kennedy is possible and even I believe there's some crazy case where there is infinity possible you can't short that that's the only way to lose infinity money.
[01:04:41] I don't know like is there an AI put in the market like how far out would you play that right now.
[01:04:47] SPEAKER_01: I am too much afraid to cat to short things even things I don't and I wish I wish this is going to be my next evolution is I'm going to learn how to be an adult trader of the public markets.
[01:04:58] SPEAKER_05: You're going to become a circus.
[01:04:59] SPEAKER_05: So lay gymnast I saw Josh wolf tweeting a bunch about buying an AI put you know basically just like literally shorting q q.
[01:05:07] SPEAKER_01: Buying a put like six months out because there's no possible way well my thing is I want I was going to buy a q q q short and to pair with a Google long.
[01:05:17] SPEAKER_02: Right because I'm scared of the down I'm scared of market go down.
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_02: But I think Google on relative basis go up even now and I'm just annoyed I didn't do it to we see up.
[01:05:28] SPEAKER_02: Now I'm going to go to the pool to drown my sorrows you're going to be here in one week beating your brow again on this.
[01:05:36] So should I just buy a bunch of Google stock then just I cannot I can't give you an opinion on that again just buy the stock Sam.
[01:05:44] SPEAKER_03: You've just talked about it for months now.
[01:05:47] I know and I just like so much poorer because I didn't I don't offer investment advice.

[01:07:09] SPEAKER_01: Anyway it's like really interesting to watch.
