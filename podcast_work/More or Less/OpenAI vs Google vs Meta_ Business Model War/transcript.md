[00:00:00] When Steve Jobs died, we like forgot how to market.
[00:00:03] Dave Morin: And then there was this low.
[00:00:04] Dave Morin: And then Elon came back with this incredible
[00:00:06] Dave Morin: Jobsie and style marketing.
[00:00:07] Dave Morin: And now everybody's adopted it.
[00:00:09] Dave Morin: And marketing is cool again.
[00:00:10] Dave Morin: It could be that the actual innovation of Silicon Valley
[00:00:12] Sam Lessin: is the greatest fucking marketing in the world.
[00:00:14] Sam Lessin: It's not that we're better at marketing
[00:00:15] Brit Morin: and it's that we have the megaphone's
[00:00:17] Brit Morin: to be good at marketing because marketing
[00:00:19] Brit Morin: is only digital these days.
[00:00:20] Brit Morin: One, one, one.
[00:00:22] One, one, one.
[00:00:24] Is it no more easy?
[00:00:25] Yes.
[00:00:26] Sam Lessin: Will the bank detect that fast?
[00:00:27] Sam Lessin: When we get more, one, one,
[00:00:30] one, one, one, one.
[00:00:32] Sam Lessin: They've been great plus sandwiches.
[00:00:34] Sam Lessin: Put it all right to the test.
[00:00:36] Sam Lessin: Put it all right to the test.
[00:00:38] Sam Lessin: More or less.
[00:00:43] Well, hello, friends.
[00:00:44] Jessica Lessin: Welcome to more or less.
[00:00:46] Jessica Lessin: Pre-thanks giving edition.
[00:00:47] Jessica Lessin: Hey, Jess.
[00:00:48] Brit Morin: How's everyone doing?
[00:00:49] Brit Morin: Good.
[00:00:50] Brit Morin: We were, I was working today.
[00:00:52] Brit Morin: And then for the last 30 minutes,
[00:00:54] Brit Morin: I was working on our holiday cards.
[00:00:56] Brit Morin: And I didn't have you guys played
[00:00:57] Brit Morin: with the Canva integration with GPT.
[00:01:00] Brit Morin: It's actually so good.
[00:01:02] I made my holiday cards in minutes.
[00:01:05] I'm just psyched because I heard
[00:01:07] Dave Morin: from a bunch of listeners today,
[00:01:09] Dave Morin: which this never happens consistently.
[00:01:12] Dave Morin: But I learned about a bunch of listeners this morning
[00:01:15] Dave Morin: that I'm just giving a shout out to.
[00:01:17] Dave Morin: We've got some great people in Brooklyn.
[00:01:20] Dave Morin: I didn't know Ryan Hoover listens every week.
[00:01:23] Dave Morin: We got all kinds of good people listening.
[00:01:25] Hi, Ryan Hoover.
[00:01:26] Sam Lessin: Hey, Ryan.
[00:01:26] Sam Lessin: No pressure, folks, but are historically
[00:01:32] Jessica Lessin: this episode, Time to Thin Skipping Week,
[00:01:36] is one of our best.
[00:01:37] Jessica Lessin: I got to say, I don't know if you remember.
[00:01:40] Jessica Lessin: The Altman years, this,
[00:01:41] Jessica Lessin: little Sam, tell us.
[00:01:42] Jessica Lessin: And Sam, hello from the Surfshack.
[00:01:45] Jessica Lessin: I see you've traded in the pool house.
[00:01:47] Jessica Lessin: I mean, I got to be the shack at all times.
[00:01:49] Sam Lessin: Got a lot of different types of houses.
[00:01:52] A house would be generous for this structure.
[00:01:54] Jessica Lessin: We like structure.
[00:01:55] Sam Lessin: Just a structure.
[00:01:56] Jessica Lessin: We like structures.
[00:01:58] Sam Lessin: Well, they both have solnism.
[00:02:00] Sam Lessin: So that connects them.
[00:02:02] I mean, come on.
[00:02:02] I've talked about my Surfshack before.
[00:02:04] Jessica Lessin: I mean, it's a work of art.
[00:02:05] Jessica Lessin: We don't have to go into it, but it is.
[00:02:07] Jessica Lessin: No, I just, I remember when we was in two years ago,
[00:02:10] Sam Lessin: we were in bulliness doing our thing.
[00:02:13] Sam Lessin: Sorry, Wes Moran, where we were supposed to call it anyway.
[00:02:15] Sam Lessin: And this was like the Altman got kicked out of open AI back in.
[00:02:19] Sam Lessin: That was a fun, that was fun.
[00:02:21] Sam Lessin: I remember that.
[00:02:22] That was really fun.
[00:02:23] Jessica Lessin: That was it.
[00:02:24] Jessica Lessin: And I think that just set off this pattern of amazing Thanksgiving week episodes,
[00:02:28] Jessica Lessin: just whenever and dying to tune in.
[00:02:30] Jessica Lessin: But yeah, so Brett, let's do our check-in.
[00:02:32] Jessica Lessin: So you made a GPT,
[00:02:35] Jessica Lessin: you made your holiday card with Canva and GPT.
[00:02:38] Jessica Lessin: Well, I always do a little twist on our Moran holiday card.
[00:02:41] Brit Morin: And I'm not going to give away.
[00:02:42] Brit Morin: Last year was Where's Waldo, right?
[00:02:44] Brit Morin: I was searching for you guys.
[00:02:46] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:02:47] Brit Morin: Right, but I used Fiverr last year to have this illustrator animate us hidden into this huge
[00:02:54] Brit Morin: Christmas scene.
[00:02:55] Brit Morin: And that was really fun.
[00:02:56] Brit Morin: That is pretty symbolic.
[00:02:57] Jessica Lessin: You replaced the freelance animator with the AI.
[00:03:01] Brit Morin: No, no.
[00:03:02] Brit Morin: I mean, I actually paid someone last year.
[00:03:04] Brit Morin: They just were like in the Philippines.
[00:03:06] Brit Morin: No, I know, but this year you didn't have to pay anyone.
[00:03:09] Yeah.
[00:03:10] And the point is that the only labor is cutting out is the Philippines labor.
[00:03:14] Sam Lessin: Like that's used with suffering.
[00:03:15] Sam Lessin: Oh, okay.
[00:03:17] Brit Morin: This is going worse than I thought.
[00:03:19] Brit Morin: Brait hasn't paid an American to do work for her in ages.
[00:03:24] I paid Sam Altman.
[00:03:25] Brit Morin: Come on, guys.
[00:03:26] But did you like, is use a free version?
[00:03:29] Brit Morin: I mean, I paid 200 bucks a month for that shit.
[00:03:31] Brit Morin: Maybe Claire, you actually cost Sam Altman money.
[00:03:33] Sam Lessin: He didn't pay Sam Altman.
[00:03:35] Sam Lessin: I did do a lot of brainstorming.
[00:03:37] Brit Morin: He just underwrote part of your holiday cards, actually.
[00:03:40] Sam Lessin: It's really unclear what you can slice and dice.
[00:03:43] Jessica Lessin: I find angels in a million ways to make a million arguments.
[00:03:46] Jessica Lessin: So I'm sure there's some accounting calculation that shows he didn't, you didn't cost them
[00:03:52] Jessica Lessin: money.
[00:03:53] Jessica Lessin: But all I'm saying though is I feel a little bit bad for like minted and shutter fly
[00:03:56] Brit Morin: and all these companies that have these amazing templates that people use for their holiday
[00:04:01] Brit Morin: cards.
[00:04:02] Brit Morin: And I use minted.
[00:04:03] Brit Morin: But to change to Canva this year, Ala Chat GPT was like an anomaly for me.
[00:04:08] Brit Morin: So I'm curious how much share those, those companies are going to lose for the holidays
[00:04:12] Brit Morin: this year.
[00:04:13] Brit Morin: Well, the thing I was amazed by is I don't understand how holiday cards are made.
[00:04:19] Sam Lessin: And I asked Jess, you were like, who do you want to send the holiday cards to?
[00:04:22] Sam Lessin: And you sent me like a 600 line spreadsheet with everyone's addresses, which answered
[00:04:27] Sam Lessin: a question room, which is like, where do people live?
[00:04:30] Sam Lessin: Like I had no idea you were keeping this for years.
[00:04:32] Sam Lessin: And I was actually quite impressed with it.
[00:04:34] This is what the women of the household do.
[00:04:36] Brit Morin: Sam, I have to update this list every year.
[00:04:38] Brit Morin: And it's so annoying because I have to literally go through it and be like, oh, wait, I think
[00:04:42] Brit Morin: those people might have moved.
[00:04:44] Brit Morin: And then I have to figure out how to reach out to them.
[00:04:46] Brit Morin: And I'm sure Jess does this too.
[00:04:48] Brit Morin: I wait for the bounce back email.
[00:04:51] Jessica Lessin: I wait for the bounce back card.
[00:04:53] Jessica Lessin: And then I reach out to them.
[00:04:55] Jessica Lessin: Why hasn't this part of the, like, why hasn't this been lost to the internet?
[00:05:00] Dave Morin: It's been shot.
[00:05:01] Sam Lessin: Everyone has tried this so many times.
[00:05:03] Sam Lessin: And it's one of those classic problems that really shouldn't be a problem.
[00:05:06] Sam Lessin: And any product person looks at it like this is a ridiculous state of affairs.
[00:05:10] Sam Lessin: But no one cares enough to fix it.
[00:05:12] Sam Lessin: Is like the upshot and like consistent way, right?
[00:05:15] Sam Lessin: But at your right date, like from a first principles perspective, it's completely ridiculous
[00:05:19] Sam Lessin: that like addresses are not like you can't just like make an API call that turns an email
[00:05:23] Sam Lessin: into an e-tune to address and hit set.
[00:05:25] Sam Lessin: Well, there ever be a future where we have like a authenticated social graph where my
[00:05:30] Brit Morin: agent can talk to your agent.
[00:05:32] Brit Morin: No, but this is never going to happen.
[00:05:35] Dave Morin: This is what Sam and I are talking about.
[00:05:36] Dave Morin: I mean, the sheer number of identity projects between all of us, it's like ridiculous.
[00:05:42] Dave Morin: It's just an impossible problem.
[00:05:44] Dave Morin: My favorite is I've owned the domain, opiumpreferences.com for like 20 years, right?
[00:05:48] Sam Lessin: Because you think about like, it's like, it's a classic thing.
[00:05:51] Sam Lessin: It's like, always you are like, hi, wait, like dietary, you're like, I don't want to answer
[00:05:57] Sam Lessin: any of these shit.
[00:05:58] Sam Lessin: It's all the same questions.
[00:05:59] Sam Lessin: Can I just have one repository of all of my preferences on everything and never, and
[00:06:02] Sam Lessin: just like sit?
[00:06:03] Sam Lessin: And the answer is no.
[00:06:04] Sam Lessin: No, you can't.
[00:06:06] Why won't your agent have this for you, Sam?
[00:06:09] Brit Morin: Like, isn't this where the world's going?
[00:06:10] Brit Morin: It just doesn't do.
[00:06:11] Sam Lessin: It's just like no one, it doesn't care enough.
[00:06:13] Sam Lessin: It's like, it's from a first principle perspective, absolutely, which is why we all own
[00:06:18] Sam Lessin: versions of this domain a thousand times over.
[00:06:21] Sam Lessin: And like, it's obvious.
[00:06:22] Sam Lessin: And from a practical perspective, anyone who would care to work on this has hired a leverage
[00:06:27] Sam Lessin: more interesting things to work on.
[00:06:29] Sam Lessin: And it's just not that important.
[00:06:31] Sam Lessin: It's like, yeah, you're just going to tell you again that like, I'm whatever my size
[00:06:35] Sam Lessin: and weight is, deal with it.
[00:06:36] Sam Lessin: And even if you're a massively resourced company and you choose to work on it, you still
[00:06:41] Dave Morin: don't solve it.
[00:06:42] Dave Morin: That's what the really crazy thing is.
[00:06:44] Dave Morin: But you do through like Gemini and GPTs, what I'm saying.
[00:06:48] Brit Morin: Why?
[00:06:49] Dave Morin: This was like the entire identity focus of Facebook for like 20 years.
[00:06:53] Dave Morin: I know, but that was so long ago where I didn't know era Dave.
[00:06:56] Brit Morin: This is the future.
[00:06:57] Brit Morin: There is no question that every few years you have to rebuild everything and realize the
[00:07:01] Sam Lessin: same things again about how the things play out.
[00:07:04] Sam Lessin: Yeah.
[00:07:05] Sam Lessin: Whatever.
[00:07:06] Sam Lessin: Maybe this time to finally build it again.
[00:07:07] Jessica Lessin: Guys, I'm so bored.
[00:07:08] Jessica Lessin: I just checking the surf report.
[00:07:09] Jessica Lessin: So I just want everyone to know that's where I am in this conversation.
[00:07:13] Jessica Lessin: But no, what are your surf preferences?
[00:07:15] Sam Lessin: And that's why it will never be built because it's too fucking boring, even though it's
[00:07:19] Sam Lessin: obvious.
[00:07:20] Sam Lessin: It just switched the Friday forecast on me, which I don't appreciate because I'm kind
[00:07:24] Jessica Lessin: of making plans based on it.
[00:07:26] Jessica Lessin: But anyway, okay, Brett, I wish you, I know you're going to have an awesome holiday card.
[00:07:30] Jessica Lessin: I was actually arrived early, put very little thought into it.
[00:07:33] Jessica Lessin: I took the picture in July.
[00:07:36] Jessica Lessin: I was like, this works.
[00:07:38] And we're go.
[00:07:39] Jessica Lessin: So, well, I will say what you guys are going to be very excited about is my God.
[00:07:44] Sam Lessin: Do I have a holiday gift for you?
[00:07:46] Sam Lessin: Jessica approved for it.
[00:07:48] Sam Lessin: No, I did not prove read this.
[00:07:51] Sam Lessin: Jessica read it and was like, I read it and I said put that in Gemini.
[00:07:55] Jessica Lessin: Is it AI?
[00:07:56] Jessica Lessin: Sam?
[00:07:57] Jessica Lessin: It's so good.
[00:07:58] Sam Lessin: It's so good.
[00:07:59] Sam Lessin: It is, it is, it is our, we wrote a book, our guide to etiquette.
[00:08:05] Sam Lessin: It's fabulous.
[00:08:07] It's awesome.
[00:08:08] Sam Lessin: You will get it at our holiday party and it's going into wide release.
[00:08:12] Sam Lessin: Jessica, I made sure she read it before we said to Prince because even I caught one or
[00:08:17] Sam Lessin: two things in it that I'm like, if I'm going to cancel the over that.
[00:08:21] Sam Lessin: And so, I want to make sure that we weren't going to get hardcore canceled.
[00:08:25] Sam Lessin: No, well, I, here's the problem, Dave.
[00:08:27] Sam Lessin: I don't care what's on the internet because you can always recall it.
[00:08:31] Sam Lessin: There is a thing about getting canceled in Prince that you can't like take back, right?
[00:08:35] Sam Lessin: Like it's a little harder to like, oh, like that is the wrong general role for that character.
[00:08:40] Sam Lessin: Let's just flip it.
[00:08:41] Sam Lessin: You know, when it's on the internet versus whatever.
[00:08:43] Sam Lessin: Oh, you wanted that level of reading.
[00:08:46] Jessica Lessin: Did you not read it that way?
[00:08:47] Sam Lessin: Because like that's what I was worried about.
[00:08:49] Sam Lessin: I had to correct one or two of our comics where I'm like, even I think that's not the
[00:08:53] Sam Lessin: correct tone to be taking.
[00:08:56] Well, good thing I like my friends canceled.
[00:08:58] Dave Morin: Oh, nice.
[00:09:00] Brit Morin: That's a Taylor Swift reference.
[00:09:01] Brit Morin: Sam anyway, anyway, the book is amazing.
[00:09:04] Sam Lessin: You're going to love it.
[00:09:05] Sam Lessin: It's going to be a wide release.
[00:09:06] Sam Lessin: More or less listeners, I will eventually post a link where you can get a copy either by
[00:09:11] Sam Lessin: financial eventors team member or by buying it using American dollars, but it's awesome.
[00:09:16] Sam Lessin: What no USD see crypto.
[00:09:18] Dave Morin: Yeah, give me some crypto.
[00:09:19] Brit Morin: Yeah, there still isn't like a really wildly.
[00:09:21] Sam Lessin: There isn't like an easy way that I know of to like do that.
[00:09:25] Sam Lessin: Which says something.
[00:09:27] Dave Morin: It says something.
[00:09:28] Dave Morin: It says something about why crypto number go down right now.
[00:09:31] Dave Morin: No, crypto number five.
[00:09:33] Sam Lessin: Could be number five.
[00:09:35] Sam Lessin: Crypto number down.
[00:09:36] Sam Lessin: Crypto number up.
[00:09:37] Sam Lessin: Crypto number.
[00:09:39] Sam Lessin: It's just a number.
[00:09:40] Sam Lessin: What's in a number?
[00:09:41] Sam Lessin: Let's start.
[00:09:42] Jessica Lessin: We've got.
[00:09:43] Jessica Lessin: So we have a pretty despite the dawn of the holiday week.
[00:09:47] Jessica Lessin: There's a lot of news.
[00:09:49] And I think I try and mix up the topics a little.
[00:09:52] Jessica Lessin: We all try to, but I got to say I think today's
[00:09:55] Jessica Lessin: looking like crypto open AI in Google.
[00:09:57] Jessica Lessin: That's all I got.
[00:09:58] Jessica Lessin: These are what else is there?
[00:10:00] Sam Lessin: Wait, the Genesis act.
[00:10:01] Jessica Lessin: We don't want to talk about that.
[00:10:03] Jessica Lessin: Oh, yeah, Brad, you want to start by talking about the Genesis act.
[00:10:06] Jessica Lessin: What about Grock?
[00:10:07] Dave Morin: I thought you wanted to talk about Grock.
[00:10:08] Dave Morin: All right.
[00:10:09] Jessica Lessin: And X there's just so much news.
[00:10:10] Jessica Lessin: I forgot.
[00:10:11] Jessica Lessin: Okay.
[00:10:12] Great.
[00:10:13] Jessica Lessin: Why don't you kick us off with a what is the Genesis act?
[00:10:16] Dave Morin: Well, is the Genesis act new or it's not an act.
[00:10:19] Dave Morin: It's called Genesis mission.
[00:10:21] Dave Morin: The Genesis mission.
[00:10:22] Brit Morin: Well, the Genesis act was was created in July and the Genesis mission was
[00:10:27] Brit Morin: created a couple days ago.
[00:10:28] Brit Morin: Waiter, these related.
[00:10:29] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:10:30] Brit Morin: I'm not following.
[00:10:31] Jessica Lessin: You need to unpack this.
[00:10:32] Jessica Lessin: I was wondering why it was called Genesis mission.
[00:10:35] Dave Morin: It's the strangest name.
[00:10:36] Dave Morin: I thought that Genesis story was written 45 hundred years ago.
[00:10:40] Sam Lessin: What are we talking about?
[00:10:41] Sam Lessin: All right.
[00:10:41] Sam Lessin: Trump signed an executive order yesterday, which was called the Genesis
[00:10:46] Brit Morin: mission.
[00:10:47] Brit Morin: It's a lot like the Manhattan project.
[00:10:50] Brit Morin: He is calling a national effort to accelerate scientific
[00:10:54] Brit Morin: discovering innovation using AI.
[00:10:56] Brit Morin: So we are going to build a shared platform with scientific data,
[00:11:01] Brit Morin: leveraging all of our national laboratories and research institutions
[00:11:04] Brit Morin: at universities for supercomputers and expertise and focus on
[00:11:08] Brit Morin: national challenges, including American energy dominance,
[00:11:12] Brit Morin: advancing scientific discovery and national security.
[00:11:15] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:11:15] Brit Morin: And to be clear, this is all in the Department of Energy.
[00:11:17] Dave Morin: So this is entirely focused on scientific discovery related to
[00:11:22] Dave Morin: nuclear quantum, you know, that realm.
[00:11:26] Dave Morin: The DOE is amazing.
[00:11:27] Sam Lessin: If you guys have read, there's a great book about the DOE and how crazy it is.
[00:11:32] Sam Lessin: Most people don't understand just how crazy the DOE is.
[00:11:35] Dave Morin: They don't I don't even think they understand what it is.
[00:11:37] Dave Morin: I mean, but I don't even really understand what it is.
[00:11:40] Sam Lessin: And I even read the book on it.
[00:11:41] Sam Lessin: I think that's the whole point of the DOE is it's like this very shadowy,
[00:11:44] Sam Lessin: but very powerful organization, which by the way,
[00:11:47] Dave Morin: we should go into conspiracy corner for some small part of this podcast
[00:11:51] Dave Morin: because a new UFO documentary just released.
[00:11:54] Dave Morin: Oh my goodness.
[00:11:55] Jessica Lessin: There's an amazing book called Area 51 and uncensored history of top secret
[00:12:00] Sam Lessin: military base.
[00:12:01] Sam Lessin: Dave, who you read this book?
[00:12:02] Sam Lessin: It's fabulous.
[00:12:03] Sam Lessin: Yeah.
[00:12:03] Sam Lessin: I read it at your house.
[00:12:05] Sam Lessin: It's great book.
[00:12:06] Sam Lessin: Anyway, there's a whole section about how powerful and unknown the DOE is.
[00:12:11] Sam Lessin: Oh, yeah.
[00:12:11] Sam Lessin: Well, the DOE was so just to give everybody the DOE was created
[00:12:16] Dave Morin: during the Manhattan Project or directly after it was related to atomic energy
[00:12:22] Dave Morin: and the entire management development scientific effort around that
[00:12:26] Dave Morin: and the ongoing matrix of activities.
[00:12:29] Dave Morin: It is the Manhattan.
[00:12:30] Sam Lessin: I'm going to get this wrong.
[00:12:31] Sam Lessin: The whole thing is the DOE is the Manhattan Project.
[00:12:34] Sam Lessin: It's just kept changing names and like there's all these like special carve outs
[00:12:38] Sam Lessin: where they get to do things that are like completely like
[00:12:41] Sam Lessin: inaccessible to the rest of the government.
[00:12:43] Sam Lessin: But it is like what happens every time there's a scandal they just rename it
[00:12:46] Sam Lessin: and it continues.
[00:12:47] Sam Lessin: That's basically the upshot, right?
[00:12:49] Dave Morin: Exactly.
[00:12:49] Dave Morin: And that one of the more interesting things is they have all these levels of
[00:12:53] Dave Morin: top secret classification that exists outside of the realm of all of the
[00:12:57] Dave Morin: rest of the government's classifications.
[00:12:59] Dave Morin: And so it's frequently used to keep many things secret that otherwise would be
[00:13:03] Dave Morin: accessible.
[00:13:04] Dave Morin: Britt, do you want to, it seems like you have a reaction to this Genesis thing.
[00:13:07] Jessica Lessin: What is it?
[00:13:08] Jessica Lessin: What's coming up for you?
[00:13:10] Jessica Lessin: Well, so last week Trump posted the Saudi crown prince, right?
[00:13:14] Brit Morin: And then I guess he had committed a trillion dollars from the Arab nations.
[00:13:20] And now Trump signed an executive order.
[00:13:23] Jessica Lessin: Guys, isn't it me or is it a trillion?
[00:13:24] Jessica Lessin: Are we so like inoculated to trillion dollars now?
[00:13:27] Jessica Lessin: Like I don't even know what trillions are anymore.
[00:13:29] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, what comes after trillions?
[00:13:32] Anyway, I don't know.
[00:13:33] Brit Morin: I just think that's relevant because we're making an even bigger effort to be
[00:13:37] Brit Morin: the weeder in the world.
[00:13:38] Brit Morin: I can't wait until someone announces some sort of funding for a quintillion dollars.
[00:13:43] Sam Lessin: Definitely Saudi first, right?
[00:13:45] Jessica Lessin: My bad is Sam Alman.
[00:13:47] Jessica Lessin: My bad is Sam Alman.
[00:13:48] Jessica Lessin: I'm going to need 15 quintillion dollars.
[00:13:51] Sam Lessin: I just back to the Genesis act like or Genesis plan or mission.
[00:13:58] Jessica Lessin: I mean, innovation is great.
[00:14:00] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, innovation.
[00:14:01] Jessica Lessin: I think and sure there are national security reasons to stay ahead.
[00:14:06] Jessica Lessin: That makes sense to me.
[00:14:08] But it's also completely true that the US and China are one is not going to
[00:14:15] Jessica Lessin: best the other in this war.
[00:14:17] Jessica Lessin: I just don't.
[00:14:18] Jessica Lessin: There's just no doubt.
[00:14:19] Jessica Lessin: I made this.
[00:14:20] Jessica Lessin: Doesn't that depend on your ideology?
[00:14:23] Well, I mean, just in terms of I was just referring to in terms of technical
[00:14:27] Jessica Lessin: prowess, right?
[00:14:28] Jessica Lessin: Like I wasn't that wasn't a political statement.
[00:14:31] Jessica Lessin: That was a like, well, I know, but I'm saying ideologically in in technical land,
[00:14:37] Dave Morin: there are a bunch of people who either believe that we're racing towards some sort
[00:14:41] Dave Morin: of AI singularity where when you hit this point, you win and all everyone else loses.
[00:14:48] Dave Morin: It's completely zero sum.
[00:14:50] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, I don't believe that.
[00:14:51] Jessica Lessin: Yeah.
[00:14:51] Jessica Lessin: So that's what I'm saying is there is a there's a whole ideology in the valley.
[00:14:55] Dave Morin: I mean, everywhere around the valley right now that like this is the truth that
[00:14:59] Dave Morin: there it's 100% zero sum and whoever gets their first to super super intelligence
[00:15:05] Dave Morin: because everyone watched the most recent Tom Cruise mission impossible movie, right?
[00:15:10] Sam Lessin: Like it's like all the same thing, but it's just a reason to have a race, right?
[00:15:13] Sam Lessin: I think part of the thing is like people want reasons to have a zero sum race because
[00:15:18] Sam Lessin: they know what the fun part of zero sum races are.
[00:15:21] Sam Lessin: You could do whatever you want, right?
[00:15:23] Sam Lessin: Like if all the stakes, if you basically have a narrative where there's some point or
[00:15:28] Sam Lessin: something you achieve that is the end of the race, then like nothing else matters.
[00:15:33] Sam Lessin: And that's really fun, right?
[00:15:35] Sam Lessin: Because like you just do anything whereas the reality is the more dirty real version,
[00:15:40] Sam Lessin: but you actually see out like Ukraine, Russia, like real conflict,
[00:15:43] Sam Lessin: friction, full world is like, that's not how it works.
[00:15:46] Sam Lessin: And it is kind of dirty.
[00:15:48] Sam Lessin: And you don't get to just do it every watt for the sake of a zero sum outcome.
[00:15:52] Sam Lessin: Rich brings us back to the Department of Energy, which is we've been looking for a Manhattan
[00:15:58] Dave Morin: project ever since the Manhattan project.
[00:16:00] Dave Morin: And so here we are giving a Manhattan project back to the Manhattan project.
[00:16:04] Dave Morin: But there are so many problems with that analogy.
[00:16:07] Jessica Lessin: Like one, the technology is literally bunkered away and in the brains of like six people.
[00:16:14] Here, the technology is literally open source.
[00:16:17] Jessica Lessin: I mean, I don't know how many atomic.
[00:16:19] Jessica Lessin: You're saying in the Manhattan project.
[00:16:21] Sam Lessin: Yeah.
[00:16:22] Jessica Lessin: And now the technology, like, you know, these models are neck and neck.
[00:16:28] And it's sort of the nature of the technology itself, right?
[00:16:33] Jessica Lessin: I mean, I not that you can't have an advantage, but people were kind of neck and neck
[00:16:37] Sam Lessin: on nuclear technology.
[00:16:38] Sam Lessin: The Germans took a wrong turn and like, I think that it was an open source.
[00:16:44] Sam Lessin: Oh, definitely not.
[00:16:44] Sam Lessin: But I'm saying there was like a highly competitive landscape to get there first.
[00:16:49] Sam Lessin: And the Germans like probably should have and they screwed up, right?
[00:16:52] Sam Lessin: And like, and then the Americans got there.
[00:16:55] Sam Lessin: And everyone looked at it.
[00:16:56] Sam Lessin: Like that was a zero sum game.
[00:16:57] Sam Lessin: It played out and it had massive world complications.
[00:17:00] Sam Lessin: Now what happened?
[00:17:00] Sam Lessin: What had happened within a few years?
[00:17:02] Sam Lessin: What happened a few years is that the Russian stole it.
[00:17:04] Sam Lessin: Everyone's the British.
[00:17:05] Sam Lessin: Everyone stole it, right?
[00:17:07] Sam Lessin: From the Manhattan project and then you went up with this kind of like, you know,
[00:17:10] Sam Lessin: multi-nation kind of relative balance of power again, right?
[00:17:16] Sam Lessin: So I don't know.
[00:17:17] Sam Lessin: It's like, I think the thing is like it's it's almost like too intellectual to think
[00:17:21] Sam Lessin: about which version of the world this is.
[00:17:23] Sam Lessin: I think people the zero sum game of like race to AGI.
[00:17:26] Sam Lessin: The question is whether that's like the right analogy, but it's a good story either way, right?
[00:17:31] Sam Lessin: Well, I've noticed I heard Eric Schmidt say this privately and then I looked it up
[00:17:35] Jessica Lessin: and he said it publicly because I and so I can repeat it.
[00:17:38] Jessica Lessin: But he refers to this as the San Francisco consensus.
[00:17:43] And he and it and again, he's now said this multiple times.
[00:17:48] Jessica Lessin: Global macrogeopolitical way to refer to things.
[00:17:52] Dave Morin: I mean, it's such a Schmidt Schmidt T and Schmidt in Schmidt in Schmidt in
[00:17:59] Schmidt in yeah, it's like when people refer for the global south or these sort of, you know,
[00:18:04] Dave Morin: Davosian I agree.
[00:18:06] Jessica Lessin: But consensus is a great word for that.
[00:18:08] Dave Morin: But to be clear, he is skeptical of it.
[00:18:10] Jessica Lessin: He is skeptical of it.
[00:18:12] Yeah.
[00:18:12] Is it really this San Francisco consensus?
[00:18:15] Dave Morin: Well, this is what he says.
[00:18:16] Jessica Lessin: I don't know.
[00:18:17] Dave Morin: I'm in a surf shaft and he talks to more people about this than I do.
[00:18:20] Jessica Lessin: So what's the surf shack consensus?
[00:18:25] Dave Morin: What's the Westmer in consensus?
[00:18:28] Dave Morin: I do feel like we're talking about consensus and like genesis missions.
[00:18:34] Jessica Lessin: I do think it's time, guys.
[00:18:35] Jessica Lessin: We need to like plant a flag and define something.
[00:18:38] Jessica Lessin: Don't you think people are really good at branding.
[00:18:41] Sam Lessin: I actually the gene in some ways in some ways I feel like the real era here is like,
[00:18:45] Sam Lessin: I think the California and Silicon Valley has gotten unbelievably good at marketing.
[00:18:51] Sam Lessin: Right.
[00:18:51] Sam Lessin: Like, it was really changed in the last few years.
[00:18:53] Sam Lessin: It's just incredible marketing.
[00:18:54] Sam Lessin: Right.
[00:18:55] Sam Lessin: And like, and like there's a whole, I think there is a San Francisco consensus of marketing,
[00:19:00] Sam Lessin: right?
[00:19:00] Sam Lessin: That Elon, I think is a major pioneer of this extremely effective.
[00:19:04] Sam Lessin: Yeah.
[00:19:04] Sam Lessin: It's going to think some problems for a free independent and accurate media.
[00:19:08] I think you can go back further, Sam.
[00:19:10] Dave Morin: And you could say that when Steve Jobs died, we like forgot how to market.
[00:19:14] Dave Morin: And then there was this low.
[00:19:16] Dave Morin: And then Elon came back with this incredible jobsy and style marketing.
[00:19:20] Dave Morin: And now everybody's adopted it and marketing is cool again.
[00:19:23] Dave Morin: It could be that the actual innovation of Silicon Valley is the greatest fucking marketing in the world.
[00:19:28] But to be clear, what you're talking about in Silicon Valley, getting better at marketing
[00:19:32] Jessica Lessin: is just saying what Silicon Valley hopes to be true or wants people to believe
[00:19:37] Jessica Lessin: and saying it enough times.
[00:19:40] Brit Morin: Guys, it's not that we're better at marketing is that we have the mega phones to be good at
[00:19:45] Brit Morin: marketing because marketing is only digital these days.
[00:19:48] Brit Morin: And like Elon owns one of the biggest channels for distribution and Zuck owns one of the biggest
[00:19:55] Brit Morin: channels for distribution.
[00:19:56] Brit Morin: Sam, who's crushing marketing and tech land every CEO of every one of these companies
[00:20:01] Jessica Lessin: who has the biggest megaphone?
[00:20:03] Jessica Lessin: So just because you have a big megaphone doesn't mean you use it well.
[00:20:06] Jessica Lessin: So who's who's winning?
[00:20:07] Jessica Lessin: Well, I would argue like the Mag seven is like crushing marketing right now.
[00:20:11] Sam Lessin: Because they have the biggest mega phones.
[00:20:13] Jessica Lessin: The Mag seven is crushing marketing.
[00:20:15] Jessica Lessin: Okay.
[00:20:17] Sam Lessin: Yeah.
[00:20:17] Sam Lessin: And video is crushing marketing.
[00:20:19] Sam Lessin: Sam Altman's crushing marketing like the private, you know, Sequoia and as you can see,
[00:20:25] Sam Lessin: is crushing marketing like I would just say that like this is this maybe this is the real
[00:20:30] Sam Lessin: San Francisco consensus is like there's a set of people have like figured out marketing.
[00:20:34] Sam Lessin: And you know what that means?
[00:20:35] Sam Lessin: You get all the resources and all the smart people come to the North Bay and all the money.
[00:20:40] Sam Lessin: And then and then you get all the resources.
[00:20:42] Sam Lessin: But there's are the people with all the resources.
[00:20:45] Brit Morin: Tell me someone who doesn't have resources.
[00:20:47] Brit Morin: That's crushing marketing.
[00:20:48] Brit Morin: No, but that's the thing you wouldn't you if you didn't have if you if in some ways,
[00:20:52] Sam Lessin: if you don't have the resources, you're bad at marketing by definition.
[00:20:56] Sam Lessin: I know.
[00:20:57] Jessica Lessin: Here's what's happening.
[00:20:58] Jessica Lessin: I just figured it out guys.
[00:20:59] Jessica Lessin: Thank goodness.
[00:21:00] Jessica Lessin: No.
[00:21:01] I think what's happening is everyone's finding their tribes.
[00:21:04] Jessica Lessin: So you're finding more messaging that you're like a men to, but it doesn't mean that the
[00:21:10] Jessica Lessin: marketing is inherently good or bad.
[00:21:11] Jessica Lessin: People are just going after their tribes.
[00:21:14] Jessica Lessin: Tham believes all of his marketing is good.
[00:21:17] For my tribe, Jess, you're making my point, which is there is no San Francisco consensus.
[00:21:22] Dave Morin: There is a San Francisco consensus about the like a I singularity, but it's not
[00:21:28] Dave Morin: everyone's no, I agree.
[00:21:29] Jessica Lessin: I agree.
[00:21:30] Jessica Lessin: I think that's true.
[00:21:30] Jessica Lessin: But it's not you if you say a it doesn't get a headline.
[00:21:34] Jessica Lessin: So Schmidt has to be first of all, calling something a concept.
[00:21:38] Sam Lessin: It's always been a sense is a incredible marketing, right?
[00:21:40] Sam Lessin: So you're like, I'm just asserting it's the consensus.
[00:21:42] Sam Lessin: It's great.
[00:21:43] Sam Lessin: You know, Eric Schmidt has always been good at a talking point.
[00:21:45] Jessica Lessin: So he's a great, he's a great marketer.
[00:21:48] Sam Lessin: Is there anything that's a consensus in 2025?
[00:21:52] Sam Lessin: But that's why you just say the consensus to make it a consensus.
[00:21:55] Sam Lessin: Well, which is also is why we think everyone's good at marketing because if people just say
[00:22:00] Jessica Lessin: things that we like, we listen to them more and then we think they've nailed marketing.
[00:22:04] Jessica Lessin: But Jess, you just made the key point, which is creator fund oriented.
[00:22:07] Sam Lessin: It's everything we're seeing, right?
[00:22:09] Sam Lessin: Which is this is an era of cults and tribes, right?
[00:22:12] Sam Lessin: Where you want super fucking core committed group of failings of people that are your true believer followers.
[00:22:18] Sam Lessin: And what you, if you think about it, if last generation marketing was about mass,
[00:22:23] Sam Lessin: is that getting convincing everyone in America that like, you know, brown here was cool
[00:22:28] Sam Lessin: through like magazines and you had no targeting.
[00:22:31] Sam Lessin: The entire story of our era right now is screw that, right?
[00:22:35] Sam Lessin: It's go find your super deep tribe and there can be lots of them and they fight with each other
[00:22:39] Sam Lessin: and they overlap.
[00:22:41] Sam Lessin: But being good at marketing means you have an army behind you, right?
[00:22:44] Sam Lessin: And you that means you have capital and customers and you pay them in stock go up.
[00:22:50] Sam Lessin: And all the things which again, you got to get Elon credit.
[00:22:52] Sam Lessin: He, I've always said this and I mean it to rocket totally and also not is like,
[00:22:56] Sam Lessin: he's not a great technologist.
[00:22:58] Sam Lessin: He is the greatest marketer of our generation, right?
[00:23:00] Sam Lessin: And that means he gets all the capital and the people and the things.
[00:23:05] He's also gotten rockets for sure.
[00:23:07] Sam Lessin: The best marketer, maybe of all time.
[00:23:09] Sam Lessin: What you need for rockets is a ton of money and rope, right?
[00:23:12] Sam Lessin: And then people who like were like, I only have one option if I care about the stuff
[00:23:16] Sam Lessin: because like, by the way, last year we'll love rockets, which is like, I gotta go over for you.
[00:23:19] Sam Lessin: Like it's an incredible plan.
[00:23:21] Sam Lessin: You know, Blue Origin landed its rocket.
[00:23:23] Jessica Lessin: It was, you know, on a barge.
[00:23:25] Jessica Lessin: So I thought that was pretty, pretty interesting.
[00:23:28] Jessica Lessin: Right.
[00:23:29] Sam Lessin: They're like the Russians.
[00:23:30] Sam Lessin: They like the ones who steal the nuclear products out.
[00:23:33] Sam Lessin: And I also says negatively, but it's like once it's proven, it's like the,
[00:23:36] Sam Lessin: it's the four minute mile.
[00:23:37] Sam Lessin: Once you prove you can do it, you're going to be able to shave some people out of the thing
[00:23:41] Sam Lessin: that did it and redo it.
[00:23:43] That's not that hard.
[00:23:45] Sam Lessin: It's hard.
[00:23:46] Sam Lessin: But like if you have $200 billion of play with you're going to get it done.
[00:23:48] Sam Lessin: But don't you think also, I, so I am still caught.
[00:23:52] Jessica Lessin: It is so interesting to me how hard Google the valley, the markets, everyone has swung
[00:23:58] Jessica Lessin: in the last 10 days.
[00:24:00] Jessica Lessin: I'm so sad.
[00:24:01] Sam Lessin: I definitely need money on this.
[00:24:02] Sam Lessin: I know.
[00:24:03] Jessica Lessin: Sam, I'm sorry.
[00:24:04] Jessica Lessin: I'm sorry.
[00:24:04] Jessica Lessin: Again, every episode.
[00:24:06] Jessica Lessin: Jess, I'm glad you brought this up because I had a chart ready for this.
[00:24:10] Dave Morin: Thank God, Dave, someone who keeps me honest, which by the way, it has another great
[00:24:16] Dave Morin: concept in it, which is the Google complex versus the open AI complex complex.
[00:24:22] Jessica Lessin: The complex is not as cool as a consensus, but still pretty good.
[00:24:25] Jessica Lessin: I agree.
[00:24:26] Jessica Lessin: You kind of want both.
[00:24:27] Dave Morin: So like this is amazing.
[00:24:29] Dave Morin: This is the, the difference in price performance between the Google complex and the open AI
[00:24:33] Dave Morin: complex co-tube put this out like two hours ago.
[00:24:36] Dave Morin: Dave, explain what you're seeing for those that are only listening.
[00:24:39] Brit Morin: There's just two lines to, you know, the performance of the Google complex, which is
[00:24:44] Dave Morin: Google, Broadcom, Lamentum, TTM technologies, and then the open AI complex, which is NVIDIA,
[00:24:51] Dave Morin: Softbank, Oracle, AMD, Microsoft, Core, we've, et cetera.
[00:24:54] Dave Morin: So it's percent increase is one year price performance.
[00:24:57] Jessica Lessin: Yeah.
[00:24:57] Jessica Lessin: And it's tracking and they sort of through the first half of the year through May
[00:25:03] Jessica Lessin: are, are pretty in concert.
[00:25:05] Jessica Lessin: Then they both start rising through August and then they diverge.
[00:25:09] Jessica Lessin: They've urged rapidly within the last two weeks and then the last two weeks.
[00:25:14] Jessica Lessin: Yeah.
[00:25:14] Jessica Lessin: Well, here.
[00:25:15] Jessica Lessin: So this is relevant.
[00:25:17] Jessica Lessin: You know, there's been a lot of speculation.
[00:25:18] Jessica Lessin: We've talked about how Google's TPUs are going to challenge NVIDIA and my colleagues
[00:25:24] Jessica Lessin: at the information wrote a story very recently that had two new data points.
[00:25:30] Jessica Lessin: One metas considering and in very serious talks over a billions of dollars, spending
[00:25:37] Jessica Lessin: billions of dollars on TPUs in a future deal.
[00:25:40] Jessica Lessin: And then there's also we had new details about pitches, Google's making to banks, about
[00:25:46] Jessica Lessin: using them.
[00:25:47] Jessica Lessin: And what's different about this is you wouldn't be accessing them through Google's
[00:25:51] Jessica Lessin: infrastructure and Google Cloud.
[00:25:53] Jessica Lessin: These would be models where you're selling or renting to other data centers more directly
[00:25:58] Jessica Lessin: competitive.
[00:25:59] Jessica Lessin: And you know, there's been a lot of chatter about this.
[00:26:02] Jessica Lessin: But I think the story was the first to show two new data points really on how Google plans
[00:26:10] Jessica Lessin: to get these to market in a different way.
[00:26:12] Jessica Lessin: And I don't know if you guys saw this, but a day or a couple hours afterwards in
[00:26:17] Jessica Lessin: NVIDIA tweeted out speaking of marketing a statement.
[00:26:22] Jessica Lessin: We are delighted by Google's success.
[00:26:25] Jessica Lessin: They made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.
[00:26:29] Jessica Lessin: NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry.
[00:26:32] Jessica Lessin: It's the only platform that runs every model and does it everywhere.
[00:26:35] Jessica Lessin: Computing is done.
[00:26:37] Jessica Lessin: NVIDIA offers greater performance for subtility and fungibility than ASICs, which are
[00:26:42] Jessica Lessin: designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.
[00:26:46] Sam Lessin: You know, that's not great marketing.
[00:26:47] Sam Lessin: I was going to say great or not great.
[00:26:50] Jessica Lessin: I saw a tweet.
[00:26:51] Jessica Lessin: Everyone's tweeting like isn't video okay?
[00:26:55] Brit Morin: Well, that our Elon or Sam Altman, they would just be like, yeah, Google things that's
[00:26:59] Brit Morin: winning, but we're we're going to be the real winners here.
[00:27:02] Brit Morin: Like they would just say something ridiculous.
[00:27:04] Brit Morin: They'd be like two shades.
[00:27:06] Brit Morin: Stay tuned.
[00:27:07] Brit Morin: Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:09] But they're being classy with their PR.
[00:27:12] Brit Morin: That's their first mistake or old school.
[00:27:14] Brit Morin: I don't know. Is it classy or just old school?
[00:27:16] Brit Morin: Look, you know, it sounds like it sounds like there's two words in versions of the world.
[00:27:19] Sam Lessin: You need a pre-Trumpian era.
[00:27:21] Sam Lessin: What you'd say is actually if you're in Vini, you kind of need one or two legit
[00:27:25] Sam Lessin: serious competitors.
[00:27:27] Sam Lessin: You're going to get antitrusted.
[00:27:28] Sam Lessin: Right.
[00:27:28] Sam Lessin: And so you're like, okay.
[00:27:30] Sam Lessin: Like I actually want someone to fast follow me pretty closely so that I can point
[00:27:34] Sam Lessin: at them and be like, see, I'm not a monopoly.
[00:27:35] Sam Lessin: Right.
[00:27:36] Sam Lessin: And so like that would be like the old way of thinking.
[00:27:39] Sam Lessin: Right.
[00:27:39] Sam Lessin: I think the new way of thinking is they're like, I don't know.
[00:27:43] Sam Lessin: They're like, they need new marketing people because like that's clearly not the story.
[00:27:47] Sam Lessin: Now look, the interesting thing is most, my understanding is like a lot of companies
[00:27:50] Sam Lessin: are already using TPUs as well through Google.
[00:27:53] Sam Lessin: Like a lot of the next, like it's not like this isn't like a new, yeah.
[00:27:57] Sam Lessin: So like it's a change in business strategy or model from the say you can just like,
[00:28:01] Sam Lessin: but it's like, that's the thing is like everyone's like, Google's already very deeply in the game.
[00:28:06] Sam Lessin: Here are people are used to using TPUs, right?
[00:28:08] Sam Lessin: Well, I also think that you got to caveat this a little bit in that they're familiar
[00:28:14] Jessica Lessin: with some aspects of them, but not they're, you know, the old problem again of the software stack
[00:28:19] Jessica Lessin: and CUDA and videos.
[00:28:20] Jessica Lessin: So and data centers of different designs.
[00:28:23] Jessica Lessin: So this isn't like a you flip a switch, but we reported that Google thinks
[00:28:28] Jessica Lessin: they can get 10% of in video's business revenue, right?
[00:28:32] Jessica Lessin: Which means they actually think they can get 20% and they're going to undershoot it.
[00:28:36] Sam Lessin: This is what they actually think.
[00:28:38] Sam Lessin: So it's a real, I just love, I mean, I love trying to analyze companies PR
[00:28:43] Jessica Lessin: particularly because they deal with us one way and then you know, six hours later,
[00:28:48] Jessica Lessin: they deal with the public another way.
[00:28:51] Jessica Lessin: And part of me is like, okay, speak your mind of video, tell your story, put your statement out there.
[00:28:55] Jessica Lessin: You mean like you should have a better story.
[00:28:57] Dave Morin: It's like their meme game is weak.
[00:28:59] Dave Morin: They didn't need to have meme game sound.
[00:29:01] Dave Morin: Like they were winning the product race up until like two weeks ago.
[00:29:05] Dave Morin: This is what happens when you're too far ahead, you get lazy and you know,
[00:29:08] Sam Lessin: your your your weapons are not refined.
[00:29:11] Sam Lessin: I don't think they're lazy.
[00:29:12] Jessica Lessin: Jensen is the most paranoid CEO of all of them, which is saying a lot.
[00:29:16] Jessica Lessin: It's like, look, if you're if you're marketing team has been like,
[00:29:18] Sam Lessin: I don't need to ship the last two years because like the product sells itself.
[00:29:22] Sam Lessin: Then like by like you get lazy, you just you don't have the war muscle.
[00:29:26] Sam Lessin: And then when something comes up, you're not like ready to go, right?
[00:29:29] Sam Lessin: And this is like not ready to go tweet.
[00:29:31] Sam Lessin: Like that to me feels like what's going on here is that, you know,
[00:29:35] Dave Morin: we've seen this narrative shift over the last two to three weeks where people
[00:29:40] Dave Morin: are actually starting to ask questions about this entire supply chain, right?
[00:29:44] Dave Morin: Like how much do these chips cost?
[00:29:46] Dave Morin: Are they going to be able to have business models sitting on top of them?
[00:29:49] Dave Morin: What's the depreciation?
[00:29:50] Dave Morin: Right?
[00:29:51] Dave Morin: Like there's like a real sort of financial analysis starting to happen.
[00:29:54] Dave Morin: In the last really, it's like that chart.
[00:29:57] Dave Morin: I want a t-shirt that says what's the depreciation to great t-shirt.
[00:30:00] Sam Lessin: I've told you guys my Gavin Baker quote, we interviewed him in April.
[00:30:04] Jessica Lessin: And someone asked him the depreciation of a GPU and he said, what's the meaning of life?
[00:30:08] Jessica Lessin: I thought that was a great quote.
[00:30:09] Jessica Lessin: Oh, boy.
[00:30:11] Yeah, I mean, there's not a podcast that this hasn't been debated on in the last two weeks.
[00:30:15] Dave Morin: But I don't know.
[00:30:16] Dave Morin: I think it's all vibes.
[00:30:18] Jessica Lessin: Like I sort of ribbed the journal for like, you know, the day after Nvidia earnings,
[00:30:24] Jessica Lessin: their lead story on the front page was,
[00:30:27] Jessica Lessin: Nvidia results put to rest bubble fears.
[00:30:30] Jessica Lessin: And the next day, it was exactly the opposite.
[00:30:33] Jessica Lessin: Like they had reversed every word in the headline.
[00:30:36] Jessica Lessin: And that doesn't mean, it just means you can't analyze this every 24 hours is what it means, right?
[00:30:42] Jessica Lessin: But they're paying to analyze it every time, like it's selling the newsstand.
[00:30:46] Sam Lessin: What's the paper boy?
[00:30:47] Sam Lessin: What's the paper boy going to sell?
[00:30:49] Sam Lessin: I know.
[00:30:50] Jessica Lessin: We're about to get a second print newspaper, everyone who's tracking the print newspaper.
[00:30:56] I just think the numbers are getting extremely large.
[00:30:59] Dave Morin: And people are actually starting, like, you know, I saw this, I saw this letter from an LP letter from a fund that I'm an investor in that used the number of seconds to contextualize this.
[00:31:10] Dave Morin: And I really liked it.
[00:31:11] Dave Morin: One million seconds is roughly 12 days.
[00:31:13] Dave Morin: One billion seconds is 32 years.
[00:31:16] Dave Morin: 500 billion seconds is 15,000 years.
[00:31:20] Dave Morin: How is this useful to you?
[00:31:22] It's just the scale of the dollars is insane, like until until like if you look, if you think about the 2010s, right, Uber raised something on the order, it was like 40 billion or something like that, which was insane, which was insane at the time, right?
[00:31:38] Dave Morin: And so the numbers that we're looking at are just really, really nuts.
[00:31:42] Dave Morin: And the revenue isn't there.
[00:31:45] Dave Morin: And so I think people are actually like, that's what started to happen in the last two or three weeks is people are starting to be like, where are we going to get margin from is the inference going to, you know, cost come down.
[00:31:56] Dave Morin: Is it not going to like is TPU better for that is GPU better for that?
[00:32:01] Dave Morin: I think everyone's just looking over their shoulder and doing what the next guys do.
[00:32:05] Jessica Lessin: I agree with everything you're saying about the uncertainty, but I think it's so uncertain that like you can't explain the market by like,
[00:32:13] Jessica Lessin: and now people are looking at this and now people are looking at that.
[00:32:17] Jessica Lessin: I think they're just reading the room.
[00:32:19] Jessica Lessin: And when no one can read the room, they're panicking.
[00:32:21] Jessica Lessin: I look at I can I give a different spin on it.
[00:32:23] Sam Lessin: Here's what I really I actually think a lot of this gets back to politics, right?
[00:32:27] Sam Lessin: And like it like from a local here's what happened from my perspective.
[00:32:30] Sam Lessin: For the first, you know, whatever like half of the year, we had a two problem, Trump in control, pretty doing just Trump land, right?
[00:32:40] Sam Lessin: Like no challenges to it.
[00:32:42] Sam Lessin: And everyone understands debt overhang must make GDP go up story.
[00:32:46] Sam Lessin: So I was like, look, we don't this all fucking crazy, but Trump will make sure we all.
[00:32:51] Sam Lessin: To be like, Trump will make sure we get paid, right?
[00:32:53] Sam Lessin: Like we're going to get paid somehow.
[00:32:54] Sam Lessin: Like I'm like, not stressed about it because like, and we'll just cut it.
[00:32:58] Sam Lessin: It will cut interest rates.
[00:32:59] Sam Lessin: Whatever.
[00:33:00] Sam Lessin: We'll just do what has to be done to make number go up.
[00:33:03] Sam Lessin: And so I was like, we don't this analysis is all crazy, right?
[00:33:06] Sam Lessin: Like this whole, you know, whatever we're going to have a Chinese has you.
[00:33:09] Sam Lessin: Whatever, but it's kind of doesn't matter because if it works, it works.
[00:33:12] Sam Lessin: And you get the gods scenario.
[00:33:14] Sam Lessin: If it doesn't work, we'll still get paid, right?
[00:33:16] Sam Lessin: Like I think the narrative broke a little bit with the midterms where I was like,
[00:33:20] Sam Lessin: ooh, like Trump less in control, right?
[00:33:23] Sam Lessin: And like if Trump less in control, then all of a sudden the analysis of like how we have to evaluate this completely changes, right?
[00:33:30] Sam Lessin: Because always I'm like, okay, this is a lot of money.
[00:33:33] Sam Lessin: And like there is downside risk here as opposed to being like a free upside option, right?
[00:33:37] Sam Lessin: Is the way I would look at it.
[00:33:38] Sam Lessin: So I think this is a political economy story that's playing out in tech more than anything else.
[00:33:43] Sam Lessin: And then you have like Google firing up and blah, blah, blah.
[00:33:46] Sam Lessin: So I just think you have to contextualize it in that context.
[00:33:49] Sam Lessin: Sam, I agree with you.
[00:33:50] Dave Morin: And I think that was the crewgment take two or three days ago.
[00:33:55] Dave Morin: And if you look at that chart, I should go find it.
[00:33:57] Dave Morin: I mean, the fall in the crypto markets is directly related to the midterm elections.
[00:34:04] Dave Morin: I mean, it happened almost in lockstep,
[00:34:07] Dave Morin: which you could argue is the Trump trade unwinding.
[00:34:10] Dave Morin: Quotanquil.
[00:34:11] Dave Morin: Well, yeah, I just know it's, I don't even know, I'm winding.
[00:34:13] Sam Lessin: I just think it's like ultimately the irony of the crypto stuff is it's the ultimate risk on asset, right?
[00:34:19] Sam Lessin: And like, so it's going to be the first thing people pull from effective.
[00:34:23] Dave Morin: Yeah, totally.
[00:34:23] Dave Morin: But I think your case, I think your argument that you just made is, you know, that the Meg 7 follows crypto.
[00:34:30] Dave Morin: And so I think if you overlay all of these charts, like you see the risk, well, it's just risk on this happening across the curve.
[00:34:37] Dave Morin: Yeah.
[00:34:39] But you know, it's just, it's not clear where it goes from here.
[00:34:41] Sam Lessin: I mean, I think I do just think the macro story is even more important than anything's coming on specifically in the tech world.
[00:34:47] Sam Lessin: And I think, you know, again, like if you, I've always said that if you want to invest in the AI narrative, the easiest bet in the world is meta,
[00:34:54] Sam Lessin: because it's all upside, no downside.
[00:34:56] Sam Lessin: I stand by that.
[00:34:57] Sam Lessin: You know, I think that's continued to continue to do the case in like that doesn't even matter if they spend tens of billions of dollars on the wrong stuff.
[00:35:03] Sam Lessin: If that happens, it doesn't affect the overall story.
[00:35:07] Sam Lessin: I think Google is the interesting one because it was, there was a serious downside case, right, which is the core, core search business.
[00:35:13] Sam Lessin: There was all these positives, but there was also this like big bogey to the negative.
[00:35:17] Sam Lessin: I think you were gotten comfortable that the bogey to the negative probably isn't going to play out or at least not dramatically, right?
[00:35:22] Sam Lessin: That's the place where it's not going to go to dramatic shift tomorrow.
[00:35:26] And they just have so many weapons.
[00:35:29] Sam Lessin: I think they've gone more than comfortable, Sam.
[00:35:31] Dave Morin: I think you look at that chart from co-to and within the last two weeks, people's entire narrative on Google has shifted into the positive.
[00:35:39] Dave Morin: Well, that was related to Gemini 3 though, right?
[00:35:42] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:35:43] Dave Morin: Yes.
[00:35:43] Dave Morin: But narratives can ship back.
[00:35:44] Jessica Lessin: I'm curious what Brit thinks because Brit, you have you found, what are you using chat, GPT 4?
[00:35:51] Brit Morin: Guys, I switched.
[00:35:52] Brit Morin: In the last two weeks, I have become primarily a Gemini, not GPT.
[00:35:57] Brit Morin: I know.
[00:35:58] Brit Morin: Well, and again, I will say every episode that I called...
[00:36:04] Brit Morin: Oh, well, I'm using...
[00:36:05] Brit Morin: Here's the problem.
[00:36:06] Brit Morin: Here's the problem of switching.
[00:36:08] Brit Morin: GPT has the memory of all my preferences and all these things I've brainstormed about and I've been brainstorming.
[00:36:16] Brit Morin: Do you know that many preferences?
[00:36:19] I do.
[00:36:21] I have a...
[00:36:22] Brit Morin: You should see this stuff that I talked to GPT about in Gemini.
[00:36:25] Brit Morin: But like, so I feel like I'm in a transition period where I'm trying to get Gemini up to speed on who I am and how I like my stuff
[00:36:33] Brit Morin: and all the things I'm thinking about and working on.
[00:36:36] Brit Morin: You're going through an AI breakup, is what you're saying?
[00:36:39] Dave Morin: Well, I wish I would have like an intake form.
[00:36:42] Brit Morin: Or I guess I could export.
[00:36:44] Brit Morin: Hello, it's your entire Google search history, all your Gmail, your calendar.
[00:36:48] Brit Morin: Can I export my GPT into my Gemini?
[00:36:51] Brit Morin: Okay, I might just...
[00:36:52] Brit Morin: Well, no, you can't export it in, but you can get it out.
[00:36:56] Dave Morin: But I'm sure they make the file really awful and not readable.
[00:37:00] Dave Morin: Well, I want to do that.
[00:37:01] Jessica Lessin: It really doesn't matter, Bray.
[00:37:02] Jessica Lessin: It does, my.
[00:37:03] Jessica Lessin: It does matter, dude.
[00:37:04] Sam Lessin: The format, not in the arrow of GPT.
[00:37:06] Sam Lessin: This is my thing.
[00:37:07] Sam Lessin: Twitter does.
[00:37:08] Sam Lessin: In the era of...
[00:37:09] Sam Lessin: There was this era where everyone was trying to implement GDPR, right?
[00:37:13] Sam Lessin: And like, download your data, which is ridiculous.
[00:37:15] Sam Lessin: And everyone was like, okay, cool.
[00:37:16] Sam Lessin: We'll give you the file format.
[00:37:18] Sam Lessin: We're going to make them so unusable and broken, we technically comply.
[00:37:22] Sam Lessin: But good luck doing anything with the data you've downloaded.
[00:37:25] Sam Lessin: That did work.
[00:37:26] Sam Lessin: But guess what?
[00:37:27] Sam Lessin: Because I've done this.
[00:37:28] Sam Lessin: In an era of chat, it's so easy.
[00:37:30] Sam Lessin: Because you're basically like, hey, Gemini, hey, whenever.
[00:37:32] Sam Lessin: Here's my entire Twitter download your data file, which is intentionally broken.
[00:37:37] Sam Lessin: Or my entire whatever file just fix it and use it.
[00:37:40] Sam Lessin: And it's great.
[00:37:41] Sam Lessin: I don't think that'll work, Sam.
[00:37:42] Sam Lessin: I also think the chat GPT memory is a liability.
[00:37:46] Jessica Lessin: For...
[00:37:47] Jessica Lessin: I understand how the concept of memory is important.
[00:37:50] Jessica Lessin: But in practice, I'll ask it about some physical element.
[00:37:54] Jessica Lessin: And it will be like, well, because you asked me about another physical element last week.
[00:37:58] Jessica Lessin: I'm like, no, they're not related.
[00:38:00] Jessica Lessin: Like, don't try and prove to me.
[00:38:03] Jessica Lessin: You remembered last week.
[00:38:04] Jessica Lessin: Like, it's an entirely different issue.
[00:38:06] Jessica Lessin: So I find it's not...
[00:38:08] Jessica Lessin: I think you can move on.
[00:38:09] Jessica Lessin: I do think this is the stuff, though.
[00:38:11] Dave Morin: This is the battleground.
[00:38:13] Dave Morin: Because people are not going to...
[00:38:15] Dave Morin: Same as like, you don't switch between Apple photos and Google photos because you've
[00:38:18] Dave Morin: just got all of your photos over there.
[00:38:20] Dave Morin: And it's a pain in the ass to move it.
[00:38:22] Dave Morin: Like, it is actually a pain in the ass, Sam.
[00:38:24] Dave Morin: Like, I get conceptually...
[00:38:27] Dave Morin: I get conceptually where you're coming from.
[00:38:29] Dave Morin: Like, you're right, technically.
[00:38:31] Dave Morin: However, the devil is in the details in that in order to export everything out of chat
[00:38:36] Dave Morin: GPT, it's an enormous amount of text.
[00:38:40] Dave Morin: It's like a huge file.
[00:38:41] Dave Morin: Like, you can't just download that into Gemini.
[00:38:43] Dave Morin: Like, it's not possible.
[00:38:44] Dave Morin: The text is not...
[00:38:45] Sam Lessin: The photos is interesting because it's literally like trucking around the files.
[00:38:48] Sam Lessin: It's just like a lot of bandwidth.
[00:38:50] Sam Lessin: Like, that is an actually interesting lock-in.
[00:38:51] Sam Lessin: I just went and chat GPT.
[00:38:53] Sam Lessin: I said, I'm moving to Gemini.
[00:38:54] Sam Lessin: I can give me a full rundown of my preferences, you know, etc.
[00:38:57] Sam Lessin: So I can use Gemini as well as you.
[00:38:58] Sam Lessin: It's like, absolutely.
[00:38:59] Sam Lessin: Here's a clean, safe, high-single rundown of your preferences styles for any AI work
[00:39:03] Sam Lessin: with you.
[00:39:04] Sam Lessin: It contains...
[00:39:05] Brit Morin: It's just my preferences, though.
[00:39:06] Brit Morin: It's all the things I brainstormed.
[00:39:08] Dave Morin: It's not...
[00:39:09] Dave Morin: It's not the preferences.
[00:39:10] Dave Morin: It's all the data.
[00:39:11] Dave Morin: Ugh.
[00:39:12] So much data.
[00:39:13] Sam Lessin: It's not how he's did it.
[00:39:14] Sam Lessin: Text is small.
[00:39:15] Sam Lessin: Text is small.
[00:39:16] Just, you have to choose because this is the war, right?
[00:39:18] Dave Morin: Like, keeping people...
[00:39:20] Dave Morin: No, that's the narrative of the war.
[00:39:22] Sam Lessin: I don't think so, Sam.
[00:39:23] Dave Morin: Like, I'm the user of these things.
[00:39:25] Dave Morin: And I do see that Gemini 3 is good.
[00:39:28] Dave Morin: But, chat GPT knows a lot more about how I think what I've been thinking about.
[00:39:33] Dave Morin: The war will be won.
[00:39:35] Jessica Lessin: What do you guys think?
[00:39:37] Jessica Lessin: The war...
[00:39:38] Jessica Lessin: I don't know if I believe this, but I say the war will be won.
[00:39:40] Jessica Lessin: With the easiest hardware access, which is where the world is going.
[00:39:45] Jessica Lessin: I don't agree.
[00:39:46] Dave Morin: With a war...
[00:39:47] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:39:48] Dave Morin: Distribution.
[00:39:49] That's it.
[00:39:50] Dave Morin: I just think that this is a real thing that being able to talk freely to these things
[00:39:55] Dave Morin: with a good user interface that remembers who you are, understands as much about you as possible
[00:40:01] Dave Morin: and then gives you the best answer.
[00:40:03] Dave Morin: Like, Jess, the fact that it didn't understand that those two ailments were different is a problem, right?
[00:40:10] Dave Morin: Like, but they're going to solve that problem, at least if you believe their narratives at all about their research stream.
[00:40:15] Dave Morin: And so, the better it knows you, the more it can answer questions for you.
[00:40:19] Dave Morin: Listen, I literally built the original theory of when I went to Facebook to work on profiles to get over exactly this.
[00:40:27] Sam Lessin: The only lock in is going to be memory when you get better at exposing memory.
[00:40:30] Sam Lessin: That was the whole thesis.
[00:40:32] Sam Lessin: I'll tell you, I don't think it's...
[00:40:34] Sam Lessin: I think intellectual is correct.
[00:40:36] Sam Lessin: You get down to the practicality of how people use these things and their actual preferences and whatever.
[00:40:40] Sam Lessin: It just doesn't play out that way.
[00:40:41] Sam Lessin: It's not as much of a lock in as you want it to be.
[00:40:43] Sam Lessin: I guess, like, I'm just...
[00:40:44] Dave Morin: I'm going off my own personal experience, which is that I don't want to switch, because it knows more.
[00:40:51] Guys, it's 2025.
[00:40:53] Jessica Lessin: It is so early.
[00:40:54] Jessica Lessin: I really believe that.
[00:40:55] Jessica Lessin: Like, and I do...
[00:40:56] Jessica Lessin: To defend my hardware point, I just find increasingly the friction of picking up my phone, clicking through to the app,
[00:41:05] Jessica Lessin: instead of just talking to something, whether it's my phone or...
[00:41:10] Jessica Lessin: Well, that's the meta case.
[00:41:12] Sam Lessin: That's your meta thesis.
[00:41:13] Sam Lessin: Is impeding my usage.
[00:41:15] Jessica Lessin: And what I really want, you know, I was in downtown Burley game.
[00:41:19] Fun fact, there are two downtown Burley games.
[00:41:22] Jessica Lessin: Who knew?
[00:41:23] Jessica Lessin: What?
[00:41:24] Dave Morin: I learned this the other day.
[00:41:25] Dave Morin: In old downtown Burley game.
[00:41:28] Jessica Lessin: And I instantly just wanted to know, like, what is the history of these two Burley games?
[00:41:34] Jessica Lessin: Like, you know, as a mid-predence-low resident, I need to know this information.
[00:41:38] Jessica Lessin: I didn't want to know enough to, like, click into my phone, decide if I was going to type, decide if I was going to use the automatic dictation.
[00:41:46] Jessica Lessin: I just want to know.
[00:41:48] Like, I think those are going to be the use cases.
[00:41:51] Jessica Lessin: That's a long meta case, because basically that's why you have glasses, that's why you're trying to get.
[00:41:55] Sam Lessin: And by the way, what you're saying is that information...
[00:41:57] Sam Lessin: It's a long new form factor, yeah.
[00:42:00] Sam Lessin: But my, the interesting thing about that is it's not...
[00:42:03] Sam Lessin: I don't know, man.
[00:42:04] Sam Lessin: I don't think it's long meta.
[00:42:05] Sam Lessin: Meta is like...
[00:42:07] Sam Lessin: Keep going.
[00:42:08] Sam Lessin: I just say, like, look, to me, I'd say that information, which is super fucking commodity information.
[00:42:14] Sam Lessin: Like, no, no LLM is going to have a dramatic...
[00:42:17] Jessica Lessin: Correct.
[00:42:18] Jessica Lessin: This does not require an LLM.
[00:42:21] Sam Lessin: Leg up on like, wire their two Burley.
[00:42:23] Sam Lessin: This is easy.
[00:42:24] Sam Lessin: So if actually most of the story is effectively Alexa 2.0, where Alexa actually works, right?
[00:42:31] Sam Lessin: Or it's like, these are not hard questions.
[00:42:32] Sam Lessin: Most of human questions are not hard questions, right?
[00:42:35] Sam Lessin: Everyone's willing to answer them.
[00:42:36] Sam Lessin: There's no technical mode from that perspective.
[00:42:38] Sam Lessin: It's literally just who's closest to the person's face.
[00:42:41] Sam Lessin: Then like, the correct strategy is to race to the face.
[00:42:44] Sam Lessin: I like that.
[00:42:45] Sam Lessin: Race to the face.
[00:42:46] Sam Lessin: Yeah, I just don't think this captures the nuance.
[00:42:49] Dave Morin: Like, go ask all of these systems.
[00:42:51] Dave Morin: Ask Meta.
[00:42:52] Dave Morin: What do you know about me?
[00:42:53] Dave Morin: Question mark.
[00:42:54] Dave Morin: If you go ask all the four main systems or five, the same question, the context is wildly
[00:43:02] Dave Morin: different.
[00:43:03] Dave Morin: Meta knows literally nothing.
[00:43:04] Dave Morin: Like, they don't have...
[00:43:05] Dave Morin: They don't have any contextually relevant information about you.
[00:43:09] Jessica Lessin: Dave, Sam is not arguing for the superiority of their AI.
[00:43:12] Jessica Lessin: I think of Meta's AI.
[00:43:13] Jessica Lessin: I think he's...
[00:43:14] Jessica Lessin: No, I'm just saying if the race is just the race is just the interface, here's my thing though.
[00:43:18] Sam Lessin: And this is an interesting question.
[00:43:20] Sam Lessin: Is how nuanced really are humans?
[00:43:23] Sam Lessin: Right?
[00:43:24] Sam Lessin: The easy answer is we're all snowflakes and we're all super special.
[00:43:27] Sam Lessin: And like, therefore, Dave, you're...
[00:43:28] Sam Lessin: And by the way, Dave and for you guys have specific tastes.
[00:43:31] Sam Lessin: I believe that you're in the 1% of special people.
[00:43:34] Sam Lessin: Right?
[00:43:35] Sam Lessin: But I actually think most people are like not that...
[00:43:37] Sam Lessin: Oh, thanks, Sam.
[00:43:38] I'll be a snowflake.
[00:43:39] Brit Morin: I think you have a lot of preferences.
[00:43:41] Sam Lessin: Like, the reality is it's like...
[00:43:43] Sam Lessin: A.K.A. where aggro.
[00:43:45] Brit Morin: No, it's like...
[00:43:47] Sam Lessin: It's Coke or Pepsi.
[00:43:49] Sam Lessin: Like, it's just not that complicated.
[00:43:51] Sam Lessin: And I think if you just like strip it back for the vast majority of cases of people,
[00:43:55] Sam Lessin: it's like all this personalization content doesn't matter.
[00:43:58] Sam Lessin: I think we're talking past each other.
[00:44:00] Dave Morin: Yeah, you're talking about six different things.
[00:44:02] Jessica Lessin: But can we talk about hardware for a sec?
[00:44:04] Jessica Lessin: Because Emerson Collectives demo day, Lauren Powell Jobs is...
[00:44:08] Jessica Lessin: They have a demo day?
[00:44:09] Sam Lessin: What?
[00:44:10] Jessica Lessin: One demo day.
[00:44:11] Brit Morin: I've been...
[00:44:12] Brit Morin: How does everyone have a demo day now?
[00:44:13] Brit Morin: Can we consolidate the demo days?
[00:44:15] I'm going to do a demo day.
[00:44:17] Oh, fuck.
[00:44:18] Brit Morin: I'm going to do a demo day after your demo day.
[00:44:20] Brit Morin: There are no days left on the calendar between your etiquette classes,
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_04: your demo days, your protests.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_04: What's your protest, by the way?
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_04: I don't know why, it's...
[00:44:29] Sam Lessin: Oh, I cannot believe I forgot.
[00:44:31] Sam Lessin: I forgot my shirt.
[00:44:32] Sam Lessin: I know, Sam.
[00:44:34] Dave Morin: It's okay.
[00:44:35] Dave Morin: We can do it next time.
[00:44:36] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:44:37] Jessica Lessin: But guys, breaking news.
[00:44:38] Jessica Lessin: And I'm going to give this one to Brett.
[00:44:40] Jessica Lessin: Breaking news.
[00:44:42] Johnny and Sam have settled on a prototype, which they will tell us in two years.
[00:44:48] Jessica Lessin: Two years?
[00:44:49] Jessica Lessin: Two years?
[00:44:50] Dave Morin: No.
[00:44:51] Dave Morin: Okay, guys.
[00:44:52] Dave Morin: This is not what happened yesterday.
[00:44:54] Dave Morin: I watched this.
[00:44:55] Dave Morin: This is not what happened.
[00:44:57] That's not what happened?
[00:44:58] Jessica Lessin: No.
[00:44:59] Dave Morin: He said it would be ready in two years.
[00:45:01] Dave Morin: No, they didn't.
[00:45:02] Dave Morin: There was a bunch of Lauren Powell Jobs trying to get Johnny to pin down a timeline.
[00:45:09] Dave Morin: And he said, I can't talk about that.
[00:45:13] Dave Morin: You can probably get more out of Sam than me.
[00:45:15] Dave Morin: And then Lauren said, then she said, well, is it five years?
[00:45:19] Dave Morin: And he's like, no, no, no, no, much earlier than that.
[00:45:22] Dave Morin: She said two years.
[00:45:23] Dave Morin: And he said probably earlier than that.
[00:45:26] Dave Morin: And it was not a like, you're going to get this in two years kind of conversation.
[00:45:30] Dave Morin: Dave, I'm glad you went to the source.
[00:45:32] Brit Morin: Thank you.
[00:45:33] Brit Morin: So what do you think, Dave?
[00:45:34] Brit Morin: Is this one year?
[00:45:35] Brit Morin: When does this ship?
[00:45:36] No, you know, I thought that their conversation was quite cool personally.
[00:45:40] Dave Morin: And I thought that their conversation was very interesting.
[00:45:44] Dave Morin: Like, I think that the way that Sam actually framed the problem was kind of cool.
[00:45:49] Dave Morin: He was talking about what did he say?
[00:45:51] Brit Morin: I didn't see this.
[00:45:52] Brit Morin: He's a great marketer.
[00:45:53] Sam Lessin: He was just talking about that they went to Johnny and were like, hey, we don't really know what to do.
[00:46:02] Dave Morin: We have this new type of computer that can reason and think.
[00:46:06] Dave Morin: And it's clear that it should be better suited for different kinds of interfaces.
[00:46:12] Dave Morin: But we have literally no idea what to make.
[00:46:14] Dave Morin: And so could we work with you?
[00:46:16] Dave Morin: And Johnny was like, give me three billion dollars.
[00:46:19] Dave Morin: The other thing that I liked about what they talked about is that they talked about the state of the current internet.
[00:46:26] Dave Morin: And that the internet and modern technology has really led us into this kind of attention economy where, you know, advertising is the ruling model.
[00:46:36] Dave Morin: Because of that, the feeling of using most of the modern internet is like Times Square.
[00:46:42] Dave Morin: And they want to create something that's kind of the opposite that, you know, is more quiet.
[00:46:49] It gives you more the feeling of like being in nature next to a lake or something like that.
[00:46:54] Dave Morin: And I like that analogy that that is perhaps the opportunity of AI that we might be able to create a better computing feeling.
[00:47:03] Dave Morin: I think we're just going to make way better ads.
[00:47:05] Dave Morin: I thought it was interesting.
[00:47:06] Dave Morin: Well, I also think and I don't want to belabor this point and obviously, but I am interested.
[00:47:13] Jessica Lessin: Lauren is clearly in team open AI in this in this battle playing out.
[00:47:20] Jessica Lessin: And that, you know, she has had long standing obviously relationships with all men.
[00:47:25] Jessica Lessin: And it's all relational.
[00:47:27] Jessica Lessin: But I think it's interesting.
[00:47:28] Jessica Lessin: And I do think that there's a time when it would have been awkward for her to, you know, be so openly endorsing what open AI is doing.
[00:47:40] Jessica Lessin: Given it's aiming right for the heart of Apple.
[00:47:43] Jessica Lessin: And I just think it's interesting that she's deciding it's not awkward for her to do that right now.
[00:47:49] Jessica Lessin: And I have theories on why that I probably can't speculate about.
[00:47:53] Jessica Lessin: But I viewed this event as sort of the coming out of her allegiances in some way.
[00:48:01] Jessica Lessin: Not that her investment was a secret.
[00:48:03] Jessica Lessin: It wasn't not that her relationship with jibot.
[00:48:05] Jessica Lessin: Tim is her best friend or a very, very close friend.
[00:48:08] Jessica Lessin: So to do something this publicly was notable.
[00:48:11] Jessica Lessin: I think if you look at the overarching themes of the events, they present a very humanist worldview in opposition to kind of highly chaotic.
[00:48:24] Dave Morin: Political world, social world, you know, et cetera.
[00:48:29] And so a lot of what I think she was trying to pull out of them was this very human, more humanist view of what computing might be and that the ability to be, you know, calm, contextual, proactive without being intrusive.
[00:48:50] Dave Morin: You know, they talked a lot about joy and simplicity and being human centered.
[00:48:56] Dave Morin: But all of that's marketing day of right like I don't think that it is. It's a design philosophy.
[00:49:01] Jessica Lessin: It is a design philosophy and it's designed to like which is marketing. No, it's design philosophy.
[00:49:06] Dave Morin: That's products you and not marketing. No, but it is like, and I admire that design philosophy.
[00:49:14] Jessica Lessin: I think it's a cool design philosophy. But it's also like she's tugging on the heartstrings of the people who believe it while most people are going to decide if it's just a better product or not.
[00:49:24] Jessica Lessin: Well, and just just be clear, I want to go back in the history of Apple and the whole relationship between design and marketing.
[00:49:31] Sam Lessin: Do you really say I'm because look at who's on the other side of the podcast here.
[00:49:35] Jessica Lessin: No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm actually wanting to hear these guys talk about this. One of the interesting things about Apple when you talk about is it marketing or is it product is Apple is the rare tech company where marketing is super freaking powerful and way more powerful than like the product managers on teams.
[00:49:51] Sam Lessin: Right. Like Apple is driven by the marketing department. No, I think that's a that's a that's a misunderstanding of how Apple works. Explain explain how works because the way it's always been explained to me is that Apple is the rare company where marketing is super powerful and like actually in Google or Facebook
[00:50:07] Sam Lessin: and places like that. But the marketing are very unpowerful. I've worked at Google and Apple. So explain it, Brett. They were equally as powerful. Go ahead, Brett. I would say at Google engineers are king and queen.
[00:50:18] Brit Morin: Like for sure, it's about the code. It's about how fast it is. It's about the A B test of like conversion rate percentages at like 100th of a percentage point.
[00:50:28] Brit Morin: The analytical. This is all 10 years in the in the rear of your mirror, but that's how it was. Sure. Fine. I think at Apple, it is like product design, which inherently becomes marketing and engineering. But it's about what is the form factor. How are people going to use it?
[00:50:44] Brit Morin: It's about the customer and the customers delight in this thing. It's about Steve saying like we want to build the bicycle for the mind. We want to like unleash human capabilities through the devices we're creating.
[00:50:57] Brit Morin: And of course that becomes marketing too, but it starts at the design and the product beyond that. Apple is completely human centric in its world view.
[00:51:08] Dave Morin: And the marketing Sam to your point is in service of a business model that requires literally selling a physical, you know, a physical object to someone right like since the beginning of Apple.
[00:51:21] Dave Morin: They had to go to conferences and trade shows and make a better designed product through and through and design is not how it looks. It's not the aesthetic design is how it works. Right.
[00:51:33] Sam Lessin: I'm just saying I'm not saying I just think Apple starts from I think in my understanding of you, you got I never worth there. But like the way it was always explained to me is that Apple was the tech company.
[00:51:43] Sam Lessin: We think about the religion of your products and whatever marketing was the most empowered right and the most powerful as a relative one.
[00:51:49] Sam Lessin: It plays like Facebook or meta back in the day. Marketing was not powerful at all. Right. Like it had no role. Right. They were like the fifth person you call maybe well, I think you're lumping together marketing.
[00:51:59] Jessica Lessin: You're lumping together a bunch of things right. So there's like depends on what you mean by that product marketing is different than marketing.
[00:52:05] Brit Morin: Okay, fine. Fine. We'll talk about product marketing as opposed to it. Facebook. We had product marketing and product management.
[00:52:10] Sam Lessin: Product marketing was not important. Right. Like that was like an afterthought on a relative basis. Right. Whereas that Apple was very important. So when you talk about its product centric that I think is worth noting.
[00:52:20] Sam Lessin: Look at the history of errors in collective and how these things fit together comes from a legacy with Steve Jobs that really put marketing and storytelling first right in a way.
[00:52:29] Sam Lessin: And I'm not saying that negatively. I'm just saying that as a strategy so that when you then look at how immersed in collective or how the narrative comes maybe that's coming through Sam Altman, etc.
[00:52:38] Sam Lessin: It's not unsurprising to be like we're a storytelling company first from that perspective.
[00:52:43] Sam Lessin: I agree with everything everyone's saying. I'm just not sure it matters because I think like people are well, I guess I'm wrestling with why it matters right.
[00:52:53] Sam Lessin: Why why matters is when you look at something like this story with Johnny and Sam and the narrative of human centric computing and like what's that that's all narrative right and then like you fit products into that narrative.
[00:53:03] Sam Lessin: I'm not saying that's a bad way to do it. I'm seeing it different right. Yeah, you have companies have cultures they have you know and they have them for a lot of reason.
[00:53:12] Jessica Lessin: I think it's also the business model the business model of open AI and the business model of Apple are the same and I've been making this argument on the podcast for a long time.
[00:53:20] Dave Morin: They're clearly not the same. They're exactly the opposite.
[00:53:23] Sam Lessin: Let just give me a second like the my point a long time ago was that this is a you know open AI is selling computer quote unquote right like people buy open AI they buy chat GPT pro like they buy an iPhone.
[00:53:36] Dave Morin: You use it you pay for it. It is not an advertising driven model today. It might be in the future. I don't know but they have to do marketing like Apple does marketing because they're selling a literally selling a product that does something both utilitarian and gives people a feeling of joy when they use it, which is the identical thing that Apple does.
[00:53:57] Dave Morin: This will be interesting because if that is the thing that you believe which I'm not criticizing. If you believe that is their philosophy what we're actually going to see over AI on the consumer side is a literal business model war right because that is not what Google is running a certain amount of matters right now.
[00:54:11] Sam Lessin: I know. I think that is what's going on. So Dave here's what you should do Dave.
[00:54:18] Dave you need to go sit down with Kate Roush CMO of open AI who's wonderful and convinced her of that because that is not the playbook open AI is running right now open AI wants us to think their meta like explicitly everything that they're saying public and privately is to compete with meta they're talking about time because there's a lot of meta people working there including Kate.
[00:54:44] Dave Morin: Literally everyone there is from meta.
[00:54:49] Dave Morin: Fiji still it's insane a lot of our old friends from meta work there by the way can we just like put a pan in the fact that meta the meta mafia is actually the mafia in this town and nobody talks about it.
[00:55:02] Dave Morin: We could circle back to it as but as meta mafia so as I'm not sure you can weigh it on that you can't talk about it yeah you're two bias sure we can.
[00:55:12] Dave Morin: Paypal talks about itself it's worth thinking about this because Dave you have been very consistent about your vision of open AI is a computer I thought it was a smart point when you made it six months ago and every time since that is not how they think about themselves right now their CFO is on call with investors talking about time spent and changing content moderation there CEO of apps is sub stacking about group chat right and to build your community pull your network into the
[00:55:42] Jessica Lessin: business of the market and then you can go to this their own advertising is sort of going head head with Google search with like recipes and how to do pull ups would based on ads I saw that I was confused by but that's not how they're making money today and that's also not how their CEO is talking about it on stage two days ago well but that's a huge disconnect because that is a huge problem but we started this by talking about the interview that was going on on stage so I'm yeah I'm glad you want and I'm glad you watch the interview also relative to this point.
[00:56:11] Jessica Lessin: We published a memo we could show ago or details from a memo quotes from memo in which Sam Altman ahead of the Gemini launch but clearly when the team had been testing it needed to rally his troops and he said the vibes are going to be tough out there for a while.
[00:56:31] Jessica Lessin: He also said it sucks that we have to do so many hard things at one time and many other things that you can read on the information but I was struck by it because.
[00:56:43] I mean it was fine it's sort of like a tune out the noise and execute but there was definitely a nervousness to it they're trying to do everything they're literally trying to be Google apple and meta all at one but he is a point of pride for him.
[00:56:59] Jessica Lessin: He uses that is a rally cry I get it.
[00:57:03] Brit Morin: And I think he needs to he's sticking to his long term vision that's what he should do as a CEO I don't actually think anything is wrong with the way he framed that and I do think there will be short term a lot of misses because.
[00:57:15] Brit Morin: Jim and I and others are executing really well and have more resources but they have a long term vision and better business models I think this comes down to this business model question which is everything that we're talking about all of these random activities that we're.
[00:57:29] Dave Morin: Listing out over and over again are them trying to find a bigger business model than the one that currently exists like that's the like real truth because they have to justify a half a trillion dollar valuation and figure out to get more money to buy the things to fight all the wars at once yes right now they do two things they sell computer to people and they sell computer to business well to be clear they sell very little of either I mean it's a lot of revenue but not to not compared to the old competing with yes I understand.
[00:57:58] Dave Morin: Guys what they're selling as a computer is pretty much available for free we can quibble on the margins but the free version of Gemini is the number of people who are going to find the difference so that is a big problem that's a little problem that's a big problem yes which is why we're talking about this dissonance right it makes sense that the troops are talking about.
[00:58:22] Dave Morin: Literally the meta business model right because the underlying hope not current reality is that they're going to be able to generate a ton of engagement and apps like group chat and many many others probably productivity probably health probably like everything that will then convert into a attention based business model just like meta right with that's just to push you that is the opposite of the apple business model I understand it's also the opposite of what sam said on stage yeah.
[00:58:53] Jessica Lessin: I think Dave is arguing for that they should change their strategy and and hark and align it more with the spirit of Sam's on stage interview I'm not sure Jess I I'm not like this is a very complex problem I don't.
[00:59:08] Dave Morin: I'm trying to correctly communicate what Sam was talking about what was going on at this Emerson collective thing as well as these apple questions I don't know how to solve the business model problem which comes back to Matt.
[00:59:19] Dave Morin: The macro right Sam knows is Sam knows his audience we talked last week about if chat GPT is the clean next of a category but it turns out that that isn't the category per se right and that the distribution model is going to be more distributed is going to be through these other products and and I think that kind of sums up the dilemma just do you have data on how much like like how do we think about this in terms of who's.
[00:59:49] Dave Morin: Using which product in at what scale like who has the best data on that like how many.
[00:59:54] Dave Morin: D. A. U. of chat GPT is there versus Gemini versus Grock versus and Thropic versus.
[01:00:01] Dave Morin: I haven't looked at the latest but Gemini and chat GPT both have huge numbers without a doubt but like how is it is it like one billion on chat GPT versus 400 million on.
[01:00:15] Dave Morin: Gemini like that was what I remember last seeing somewhere but I didn't know how accurate the data's are.
[01:00:21] I would have to compare but my sense is very healthy engaged hundreds of hundreds of millions very active but that's like the difference between meta or Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat right like meta was always north of a billion D. A. U.s.
[01:00:37] Dave Morin: Twitter and Snapchat were multi hundreds of millions but I think the trajectory matters more it's like because you don't.
[01:00:44] Jessica Lessin: Haven't really been like comparable products and again look chat GPT could.
[01:00:50] If we wake up and open AI has you know some new AI breakthrough that gets us closer to that San Francisco consensus that could change the game again I think it would change it versus shorter window but it could again right so.
[01:01:05] Jessica Lessin: Well this is the point is there's no lock in right is like is all the key to you only can to changes it which is it was the original pitch was that we're so close to this like game over a new clear style outcome that sound will get to first and then there's things locked everyone else locked out right and like that's not going to happen.
[01:01:21] Sam Lessin: Back to the thing that we were somewhat talking packs each other about I don't think you can claim that there's 0% lock in I think that memory not preferences memory.
[01:01:32] Dave Morin: Provide some level of lock in yeah it's not zero yeah do you think wearables are going to add more of a lock in like if if we are measuring all of our daily one of itself no I think we've got to get back to the every man here like I think we have to.
[01:01:50] Jessica Lessin: I don't know what analogy we're in but it's like we've been through this like hardcore power user.
[01:01:56] Jessica Lessin: Faze of and story telling things but just that's why I'm asking you the DA you number because I think I think it was Sam said or you guys may be quoted in an article said something like.
[01:02:07] Dave Morin: Chatchy PT is AI to most people and I don't know how true that is right like if it's true that most of the DA you like in the world right now is in chat GPT every day it's not I don't think it is.
[01:02:23] I would just like to know what the number is noted will get back to there was an era where most of the most of the world.
[01:02:31] Sam Lessin: A well was the internet right and like if they had a lot of lock in in a lot of different ways and you know what it just doesn't matter long term I'm also not sure.
[01:02:42] I'm not sure you want to be AI to the world to our conversation last week I think I think that is an open question don't you just want to be like free shipping cool stuff faster answers to the world and free isn't that what you want to be a man I the idea that you like you know what actually wants to buy a computer right they want the outcomes from a computer.
[01:03:02] I think this is like the key thing it turns out it might be that in chat GPT is clean acts but like clean acts is like the plague right and like you're like I actively don't want.
[01:03:14] Okay that's a bit harsh I will also say as we wrap this segment and perhaps this pod yeah I want to go to the pool.
[01:03:25] I'm sick of the surfshad I want to get the sonner of the pool I also am like not ready to like short open AI.
[01:03:31] Jessica Lessin: Despite everything I said like yeah I guess that's why I'm trying to get to this question just which is like well I guess I short it I short it beyond like to some degree.
[01:03:42] Jessica Lessin: You know below its current valuation yes but I would not it's not going to zero it's not going to zero and so I know well someone will buy it so I think that's really interesting and there's a real puzzle in front of them I just there are certain queries I prefer them for to Gemini.
[01:04:01] Jessica Lessin: They have a much more straightforward style Gemini is so long winded I want like Gemini short Gemini TLDR and you know they've got a lot to play with to do some cool stuff but the ball is in their court again and these things swing.
[01:04:17] These things are not going to zero because if nothing else they're taking dollars and turning into 20 cents worth of infrastructure right so the zero is not a number right like I sell you if I sell you 20 cents of infrastructure for a dollar and I take the difference like fine it's in I also say shorting.
[01:04:30] Sam Lessin: In anything or in Kennedy is possible and even I believe there's some crazy case where there is infinity possible you can't short that that's the only way to lose infinity money.
[01:04:41] I don't know like is there an AI put in the market like how far out would you play that right now.
[01:04:47] Dave Morin: I am too much afraid to cat to short things even things I don't and I wish I wish this is going to be my next evolution is I'm going to learn how to be an adult trader of the public markets.
[01:04:58] Jessica Lessin: You're going to become a circus.
[01:04:59] Jessica Lessin: So lay gymnast I saw Josh wolf tweeting a bunch about buying an AI put you know basically just like literally shorting q q.
[01:05:07] Dave Morin: Buying a put like six months out because there's no possible way well my thing is I want I was going to buy a q q q short and to pair with a Google long.
[01:05:17] Sam Lessin: Right because I'm scared of the down I'm scared of market go down.
[01:05:22] Sam Lessin: But I think Google on relative basis go up even now and I'm just annoyed I didn't do it to we see up.
[01:05:28] Sam Lessin: Now I'm going to go to the pool to drown my sorrows you're going to be here in one week beating your brow again on this.
[01:05:36] So should I just buy a bunch of Google stock then just I cannot I can't give you an opinion on that again just buy the stock Sam.
