[00:00:00] So how many, I have 10 fingers.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_02: How many battery rings am I gonna have in my hand in like five years?
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_02: Sam, I think you've got, yeah, you've got health and probably AI interface.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_01: Seems like, well, big hand people, more battery life and more success because of big
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_02: hand. Well, women want to marry large handed men.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_02: Women already want to marry men with large fingers.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_05: Sam, oh, just kidding.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: Why hello friends. Welcome to more or less. Hey, Jess. We're all here.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_07: Sam, is this your first from the pool house? The new pool house?
[00:00:54] The new pool house is complete. It's mostly complete. There's still a few tweaks to do.
[00:00:59] It's pretty good. It's pretty good. Jess was just the interior design.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_05: Of course not. Did AI do the interior design?
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_05: Brett, what do you think? Brett, I am too AI interior design projects going and they're
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_08: not going that well. I got to say, in each case, you haven't found a good AI interior
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_04: design platform yet. It's really not good. No, we have a great human designer.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_02: Wait, a platform? Can't you call it human in the loop?
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_05: I don't care what our human designer does. She can use AI.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_02: But you only want to talk to a human when you're designing your interior.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_05: Here's my problem. We can start with a little case study. There's big news always.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_08: If a human interior designer used AI, I would be very angry.
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, me too, actually. Of course they're using it. Are you kidding me? Everyone's using
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_04: it. Because I don't want AI slop in my interior design.
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_01: Oh my God. I was going to say anti-slop police.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_05: Slop police. We're not going back into this right now.
[00:02:00] We are. My BC viewers, if you can't tell someone
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_02: you say, I it's fine. You just don't use AI.
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_02: Exactly. Dave, if they're just using the framework of what the living room layout could
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_05: be because they want five examples and then they use their human art on top of it, that's
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_05: okay. If it looks like Sam's Kings and Queens t-shirt
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_01: on my wall, it's game over. It's so good. Guys, I just shipped out
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_02: like 70 shirts. Oh my God. Guys, this has been such a great subplot of more or less 2025.
[00:02:32] I appreciated the last episode because I wasn't there. And I liked the arc of the storyline
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_05: that happened in etiquette school and Sam in the car all the way to AI slop t-shirts.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_05: Right. Wait a minute. You listen to more or less. I've never listened to what a rapper
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_02: says.
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. She listens to all the episodes. She's on, not on. It's so endearing.
[00:02:50] She made me listen to it with her while we were driving to Big Sur last Friday.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's painful. I'm sorry.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_05: I'm sure Dave doesn't talk shit or say something stupid that I need to correct him on for
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_05: the next episode.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_05: You know, that is a great, I use case. Can't you just be like, AI, did Dave say something
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_02: talk shit on this?
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_02: So a human designed the pool house. I am falling so flat. Guys, chat GPT. It is not hard
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_08: to give me a link to this stuff. It's not hard.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_08: Chat GPT does not like to give you links. Then it gives you links. And they're not clickable.
[00:03:26] Then you click them and you're still inside of chat GPT instead of on pottery barn homepage
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_08: or wherever you want to be. And we know commerce is a coming, but I just hope the pieces finally
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_08: come together because this is the most obvious use case that is so broken. Gemini too.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_08: It's like, do you want a mood board? One for yes, two for no, which also doesn't make
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_08: sense because it reads yes or no. I didn't know what else getting these one, two or three
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_08: prompts from chat GPT. It's straight on phone trees.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_08: It's I get it all the time. Maybe you're in a beta of something that they're experimenting
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_05: with. It's so bad. And then I do it. And they're like, just one more question. Do you
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_08: want a poultry? Just one more question. I mean, it's hilarious actually. I could do a
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_08: whole call about it. So that's been my consumer tech journey of the week. And it's not going
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_08: well. Any other consumer tech journeys before we get what you call the iPhone, socket consumer
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_04: tech journey or no. Oh my God. Oh my God. So guys, we are going to talk about Apple this
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_08: week. Buckle up. Favorite moralist topic because the things are happening. Data point
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_08: one, ozampic phone, not going so well. You guys will remember when Apple launched the
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_08: thin iPhone, the iPhone air, the iPhone air, it was like, you know, when razor did this,
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_08: when Blackberry did this, it was all a bad sign. It suggested that your innovation was down
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_08: to thickness or thinness. And it was not a good sign. Turns out this thing isn't selling
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_08: as reported in information, delaying, next versions, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_08: Yeah, but the pros great. Who cares? Okay. So give the give the more on Apple right
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_08: now, Sam. Dave, you're muted. I'm not sure if by accident. Sam, did you mute Dave talking
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_08: about Apple? No, no one gave me that power as well. I'll never be given power to mute.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_02: Okay, we're going to let Sam go, Dave. And then you get the coveted rebuttal position.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_08: Is that coveted? I don't know. I mean, look, the stock's never been higher. I like the
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_02: new phone. It's I love how on innovative they are. They're like, we're just making a
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_02: better phone. Fuck you. AI. I'm kind of like as anyone who's listened to this pot,
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_02: knows like, I am the ultimate Apple hater. I hate Apple. I hate everything they stand
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_02: for. I buy hundreds of thousands of dollars of their shit, but like ethos wise, they're
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_02: like the opposite of what I believe in that said, this kind of like thumbing your nose
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_02: in AI, which is what I take them to have done recently and being like, eh, like I love
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_02: that shit. Apple gets to be the contrary and it's great. Who cares about their stupid
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_02: thin phone? It's like the fat phone is great for you note, Jess, of all people, my battery
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_02: is always at 1%. Have I been off my phone? Has it gone out ever? Like, no, it's like for
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_02: the first iPhone that I haven't been able to drain to zero.
[00:06:24] Add another trillion in market cap. Well, they kind of did. It's like a $4 trillion
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_02: company now. Dave has a lot of thinking though about why the iPhone
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_05: Air was actually created and it wasn't about selling them. Oh, come on. You don't delay
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_08: your plans to build more of them if that was your plan. I mean, I mean, it was about selling
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_08: them. Okay, Dave, give us the give us the iPhone Air case.
[00:06:48] Look, I'm actually sitting here thinking about Sam's point about the battery, which is
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_01: it's true. I actually rarely run it down, which is an interesting, that's like one of those
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: interesting things that you don't notice, but it just happened. And now it's normal.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_01: And it doesn't enter your consciousness. Like, I think that's the truth is that the
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_01: pro is just better. And the pro is great. Like, it lasts longer. It has incredible cameras.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_01: It's not as hot. Like, my favorite thing about it is that they did somehow seem to solve
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_01: this problem of overheating these things. And so you've got a battery that lasts all day.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: And the thing doesn't overheat. It feels good in your hand. Everything else about it's
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_01: better. The pro is just a great phone. Now, the air on the other hand, Brits write, I
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_01: think that the air was actually an exercise in miniaturizing and, you know, moving their
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_01: silicon and, you know, surrounding PCB stacks to be extremely small. And that this is,
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_01: like a road sign on the way towards what they're going to be doing with wearables next. And
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_01: that they will likely be taking this, the technology that went into the air will likely end up in
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_01: the glasses or whatever it is. You're going to slap the air on your forehead with a little sticky
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_01: tape. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, didn't you post a photo with a computer on your face yesterday morning
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: on the internet? I post pretty a lot on the internet. Sometimes I forget what I post.
[00:08:24] I think it's clear, you know, from the Meta Raybanz that this is a actual competitive category
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_01: and that the AI computing device on the edge that's using inference to interact with you is going
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_01: to be the thing. My inbox right now is full of startups working on various types of rings
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_01: that you can use to interact with AI. And so he's like wearable AI. You're starting to
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_01: have like a real different than mine. It's rings. I got the necklace and the earrings pitch.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_05: Everyone's doing wearable jewelry. Yeah. A lot of wearables, a lot of AI wearables.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: We got butt plugs. Not yet. That's not a bad idea. You can fill out a battery up there.
[00:09:08] I'd be dangerous. Dave, do any of your ring companies need a beta tester because I would totally,
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_08: totally test. One of them is awesome. So it turns out that it's like still very hard to ship hardware
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_01: and most things don't. But there is one that's I'm pretty optimistic going to get into market
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_01: in the next few weeks maybe. So yeah, so I'll get you one as soon as it's ready.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_01: I'm excited about this category because I increasingly using my phone to record notes,
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_08: record reminders, record, you know, all that, how I feel. And I don't want to pull out my phone
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_08: to do that. Yeah. This is a real thing. There's enough, there's like this weird thing where
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_01: the same idea arises in the same place all over the world all at once.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_01: Britt and I were listening to this great podcast called the To Let the P tapes last week. And
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_01: people are fucking obsessed with that. It's a great podcast. And.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_05: Didn't we know about this like three years ago? I could talk about this. Yes. Well,
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_05: the season one came out. No. Because season two just came out a couple weeks ago. And Megan
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_05: Lightcap is a big fan of this. Season two is where it's at guys just saying.
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_05: And the second episode is about creativity and this idea that ideas are living beings or
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_01: that they kind of they do actually arise everywhere all at once. And that people seem to tap
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_01: into them. And that's what my view is on what's going on in my inbox right now and what you're
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_01: asking for ideas or memes. Well, I was just going to say what's the difference between that and
[00:10:48] cults memes. Nothing. Actually, a lot of what they talk about is songs, you know, they have a lot
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_01: of stories about art, you know, different types of artists, writers, songwriters, musicians that
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_01: seemingly script writers in Hollywood. You see this happen with TV shows and movies.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_01: That ideas arise in many places all at once. And they are mimetic. And there's something about it.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_01: And so the use case you just described just is very clearly something that a lot of people are
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_01: focused on right now at the so how many I have 10 fingers. How many battery rings am I going to
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_02: have on my hand in like five years? I think too. Sam, I think you've got yeah, you've got health
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_01: and probably AI interface seems like it's pretty clear. I'm preparing. I was
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_08: never a ring person. And now I've started wearing more rings to prepare for the AI ring.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_08: You're like conditioning your fingers. Well, people with bigger hands have a competitive advantage.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_02: More battery life. More battery life and more success because of big hand. Well, women want to marry
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_02: large handed men so that maybe women. Women already want to marry men with large fingers. Sam.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_05: Oh, just kidding.
[00:12:06] By the way, that is a totally different type of ring.
[00:12:10] Should we cut that part out? Have we ever cut anything out? I wish we would cut things out.
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_06: Okay, fine. All right. It was too easy. It was a layup. It was a layup.
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_06: I don't know how to grade segment that I was very proud of. It's some editor to decide it was
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_02: over the top and cut it. It'll be forever be lost. Yeah, it was great. It honestly wasn't me.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_08: It honestly wasn't me. Yeah, it wasn't Jess. It was like some person who thought they were helping me.
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_02: Sam's going to run his own like honor recording so that he's not censored.
[00:12:43] I get censored on this part. Wait, are our editor edited you without our permission?
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_01: I think they thought they were doing like going above and beyond when in fact they were not. But
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_02: that's okay. Okay, so staying on the AI wearables trends just to let everyone know where we are in the
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_08: agenda for today. We're in AI wearables, AI hardware, Apple, etc. We had a friend who
[00:13:09] had been wearing a wop and then he was like, I wear my wop in my underwear band now.
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_08: And I was like, is that a thing? And this is true. And he was like, he's like, it's totally a thing
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_08: and then like sometimes ends up in the laundry or whatever. And it made me realize like, okay,
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_08: we're going to be sticking things everywhere because again, we only have so many fingers. I didn't
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_08: know. Did you guys know who there's also it's just sort of where your belt band is. It's not like a
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_08: yeah, I'm aware of this. Clips on your pants kind of. Yeah, like a pager. It's like a pager. Pagers coming
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_02: back. I would definitely have a pager over a phone if I for your drug deals. I had a pager. I just
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_01: you know, I think sometimes people want the dump phone experience. And so if they don't want the
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_05: screens and the addiction, but they still want to device that can. This is the problem you're saying
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_01: that everyone's trying to create a dump phone and they should just go back to Pagers. Maybe.
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_01: The thing I have seen a bunch of them have been targeted by a bunch of Instagram ads.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_02: I actually kind of love. And I know people working on versions of this is here's what you do.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_02: You make a dump phone out of an Apple watch in a case. Have you seen this? So take a
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_02: little ticket Apple watch and they stick it in the case that has like an old scroll circle scroll.
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_02: We'll learn it's sick. And so you can you you get a phone, you get all the things you need,
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_02: but it's effectively a dump phone. Just hijacking the form factor of an organ existing. I
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_02: is pretty smart actually. I'm into it. I'm like 50% going to take email and slack off my phone
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_08: because Melanie, the CEO of Canvas said she did this and it seemed like a great idea.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_08: And all the social media apps, Jess. Yeah, but that's that I could serve that would be so easy for me.
[00:14:52] Now you love Instagram. I love it. I don't need it. Love it. Don't need it. Can I dare you to take
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_02: Instagram off your phone for a week? I mean, I'll do it right now. Should I sign off or should
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_04: she's rising to the jump? Sam, you have to verify she really deleted it. Sam,
[00:15:13] I've also been back on for a week because I have a creative project that I'm working on.
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_01: To read Instagram right there, right there.
[00:15:21] Anyway, the more important thing is, Jessica showed you a screen is she's the last remaining
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_02: user lift in the world. That's so funny. I think they just did a big partnership with someone.
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_08: I saw in the news. No, we have a big story about them. Okay, Instagram's off. Let's check back
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_08: in next Wednesday at 224. What should we bet? Sam, you do not know me well if you think I'm
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_08: going to lose this bet. I don't know. I would like to verify using the screen time control. Sam,
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_05: so on next Wednesday, we need to log in. No, no, we're a high trust family. We can just trust
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_02: just that you won't do it. Guys, I am so competitive and this is now public. There's no way I'm touching
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_08: that out for a week. I promise you. I love it. Are you going to use it on the web? No, I can never
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_08: log in. How are you keep up with the foster sisters and like knowing about the show they make?
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_02: They're podcast. They're podcast and I'll text them. This is so. I just go turn text messaging
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_02: into Instagram like people are like, Hey, text me. I like this. I like this is a new segment that we
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: can get just to commit to things for a week. I honestly really have no emotional reaction to this
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_08: at all. And I love Instagram. I say this with so much love. I get so much joy of seeing Chris
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_08: Jenner 70th birthday. God bless you, Chris Jenner. I got shit to do. Well, you know you won't
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_08: miss her 71st. I might, I might, might not be back. But here's the question though. You guys didn't
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_08: react to the thing I'm 50% thinking about doing, which is taking email of my phone. No, I think
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_05: that's important. I think that's important. I think it's important. I love it. You already don't
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_02: really respond to email. So it's not like that difference. Is it just email is other people's
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_01: to-do list for your life. You should definitely take it off your phone. I like to scan email even if
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_05: I'm not responding. I just need to know what's happening. And I would like to be clear. I want to be
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_08: people can call me and call me if they really need me. Also, I am surrounded by computers. This
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_08: isn't like, it's not like I'm going to be, you know, I think it would be bad. Like if you have a
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_08: really bad flight delay and you don't have email on your phone, that might be tough. You can
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_08: always get it back. You can always read down about it. No, it's like so many authorizations. It's
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_02: like impossible. Melanie Perkins, CEO of Canva, great lady, swears by this.
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_08: Our third grader, whose eighth came home, he's like, Dad, we used Canva to make things today.
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_02: I was like, you know, Lion, I actually know the founders. I knew them before they found
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_02: it in Canva. And he's like, did you invest in it? I was like, no, I missed that one. He's like,
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_02: Dad, it's hard when your kids are actually giving you crap about your missed opportunities.
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_05: Well, the real one that law that our kids nail is, I got to say, you guys have been watching
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_02: South Park? No, it's so good. It's so good. The last two episodes of South Park, my favorite
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_02: Boulder grads, when people ask me what my politics are, I basically just this point just say
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_02: South Park. Like I just agree with them. Like they're very good. But there's a whole six,
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_02: like half the episode is about six seven, which is just so good. They're so on top of their game.
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_02: It was wonderful. It also just to, if you got everyone out, who listens to this pot has to watch
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_08: it. There's a Peter T. O'Plott. There's a meme coin plot. And there's the six seven plot all in
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_08: the same 22 minutes. Okay. Have we decided what killer AI hardware foreign factors going to
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_08: take off? Or are we moving on to the next topic? I mean, I do like the new, the newest
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_02: meta glasses, the like wrap around Oakleys. Pretty great. I just still don't believe people are going
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_05: to want something in front of their eyes most of the day. And like you literally are wearing glasses,
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_02: Brett, as am I. What are you talking about? I'm not glad you literally are wearing glasses.
[00:19:17] Connected. No, when the person across or me thinks I'm in a conversation with them and they know
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_05: I might not be like that just breaks a social dynamic. You're talking about the ones with the screen.
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_02: Brett, I am on Instagram buying things right now. I don't like it. I don't feel like we have the
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_05: depth of relationship we could be having when you have connected glasses. This is where I throw
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_05: Brett under the bus for using a computer in every single work meeting. I've ever been in a
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_01: in a room with her. She's taking notes. Someone has to be organized. No, I sit next to her. She's not
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_01: taking notes. No, when you guys, when some of the men in the meeting rabbit hole into the
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_05: conversation and I already know what the outcome's going to be, I save five minutes of my life and
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_05: answer a couple emails. I'm still listening because I'm a woman and a mom and I have the multitasking
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_05: capabilities that we all have. No, you're actually just ignoring people. There were, this was
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_02: actually a whole thing like a decade plus ago in meta management meetings where certain
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_02: unnamed people would just be like blasting through email in like small group and it was a whole
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_02: thing. So this is not a new topic of conversation. I think it's based on your brain type. You should
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_05: be able to multitask and other brain types shouldn't. I really aspire to tone down the multitasking.
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_08: I am convinced it's challenging. Jess, I like that you and I are fully aligned on life and values
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_01: right now. Dave, you have brought, I'm bringing out my inner day more and although I also have an
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_08: inner bread, I suppose an inner sound, but I just think almost nothing in life is worth your full
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_02: attention. That's the most sound thing I've ever heard you say. If something's not worth your
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_08: full attention, why are you doing it? Because, because there's all these things in life that you just
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_02: have to do. And like I just think that that if you just accept the fact that look, when you
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_02: should know the difference, like there are things you should not be multitasking on that do require
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_02: full attention. But I think it's also okay to embrace the fact that very little requires your
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_02: full attention. Your brain is incredibly powerful. Like, well, but here's the thing. So I injured,
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_08: I don't think I talked on this podcast about the concussion I got, but I got a pretty bad concussion
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_08: over the last month. And my main takeaway from it was actually about multitasking. I still am
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_08: in recovery and get really bad headaches, but I think you know, but that happened to me last year
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_01: during species and yeah, we should compare notes to it, but not a lot of stuff. The point being,
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_08: as I've been recovering and it is getting better and I am recovering, the I'll be in a call like
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_08: this and I feel great. My head doesn't hurt. And then a text will come in and I'll click over to
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_08: the text and I get a throbbing headache. And so I take that as proof of the cerebral load of
[00:22:08] multitasking. And it's still like, like my brain can handle like one-on-one meetings that it could
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_08: handle, you know, screens and like I, I'm trying to stay away from multitasking because I don't want
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_08: to tax it. And even if my brain's at 100%, why, why sap its power when I could be, you know,
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_08: just cutting that meeting short and then applying the full power to the next thing.
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_08: I mean, I've started taking meetings in the sauna. So like, it's kind of the opposite.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_02: That's pretty Japanese of you. I mean, that's like the, that's the, not with a person. Like, I put the
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_01: phone, I put the phone on the floor. It's gonna say that's Roman, Japanese, like this is the way.
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_02: I haven't negotiated one term sheet in a sauna with the founder. It's a great idea because,
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_02: especially if they're not used to the sauna, because you have the edge, you can just keep cranking it up.
[00:23:05] Okay, I'm gonna keep us moving. We're gonna stay on hardware. Did you guys know Andy Rubin is
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_08: starting a robots company? I thought I already had a robots company. He said several. He's starting
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_08: another one. How many robot companies can Andy Rubin start? Is the real question? And this one's
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_08: based in Tokyo. This one's in Tokyo. Can you start up? The first one was, wait, what? Did he move
[00:23:26] to Japan? Yeah, you guys may remember, he left Google amid a lot of controversy, some relationship
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_08: issues, some other things. But the man believes in a science fiction. And I get it. If you're like
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_08: a humanoid man for decades and now the humanoids are coming, you want to get in the game. Oh, it's a
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_08: humanoid startup? Another one. Okay, but can we also talk about that Thomas Banglitzer, the silver robot
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_01: from Draft Punk, speaking of humanoids, performed last week in Paris without the helmet?
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_01: Dave, you're going on a total different segway. We'll get back to that. I'm not with you on this,
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_08: Dave, you're gonna have to bring me along. No, I don't think we should go there. I don't think we
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_05: need to deter into Draft Punk right now. Let's go back to Andy Rubin and his humanoids. How much
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_05: do I need to erase for this? I don't know, but he doesn't need to raise money. Nobody should work on
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_01: humanoids. Okay, say more. Why not? I mean, it seems clear that humanoids, the idea of humanoids is
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_01: somewhat akin to where VR was in call it 2011 or 2012. We're investors in a couple very serious
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_01: robotics companies. One of them actually is led by someone who worked on the humanoid at Tesla,
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_01: worked on all of the factory lines for the Model 3, the Model Y, the Cybertruck, everything.
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_01: And they are not optimistic that humanoid application in business or I mean, there's a lot of
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_01: these guys talking about consumer being an actual real thing that's coming. I mean, I think what's
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_01: the one? There's one called figure and another one. There's another one. They're literally pitching
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_01: it like pre-order the robot for your home today. Like, I don't know anyone who's serious in robotics
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_01: that actually think that that's dreams a reality in any time even remotely soon.
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_01: And so the guys that are actually building real robotics businesses are doing it in the warehouse,
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_01: in the factory, you know, very specific applications of robotics. And that's where robots have actual
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_01: customers today. And so that's the thing that I'm kind of, as a capital allocator, I'm like
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_01: quite concerned that a lot of people are just, you know, investing in VR in 2011 right now,
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_01: and there's going to be a lot of money lost. Yeah, because it looks awesome on social media.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_02: And that's what people are actually investing in is clips for social media. Yeah, but these aren't,
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_01: like, there aren't real applications of these things. And the hand problem is legitimately
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_01: very difficult. Yes. Oh, the old hammer. Here's what I want. I want a home defense robot. We
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_02: know that robots are for defense. Why can't I have like a little like, does, um, does Sora do this?
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_05: Sam, I've got a company for you to look at. Soren isn't humanoid. I don't want to human. I want
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_02: like a thing that during the day, mose the alarm, but at night goes into war mode and like patrols my
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_02: driveway. Well, you should just have Soren for that. Invest in Soren. Sam, it's a company that I
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_01: co-founded with Kevin Hartz and he's listed as a co-founder. Yeah, I don't talk about it super
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_01: publicly, but yeah. But wait, but this is like, okay, so this is fine. This is like, I guess I just
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_02: did. Broke some news on the pod. This is deep sense and all two point out with like, we are,
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_02: like deep sense oil has like a little camera thing that like shoots like spray at your face. But I
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_02: want like a patrolling robot. Was this thing patrol? I understand what you want. Sam, yes. Is it like
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_01: a mini tank that can go up and down my dry? What? Do you have us telling you this is coming?
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_05: Come over to the company and we'll run you through the road map.
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: Or come to our house because we have it installed. Do you have a robot patrolling your house
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_02: maybe outside? They have a dog. We have our dogs in Bernadudele. He's not going to attack anyone.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_05: Our dog will hug people to death like he's never going to attack them. If you think about use
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_02: cases to go after people do get like big dogs to like scare people away. If you said like that,
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_02: you could make a better big dog, which by the way is a plot line from Snowcrash. Remember
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_02: like what's the dog in Snowcrash with the network of dogs that go and like hunt people down?
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_02: Like this is like a major plot line in Snowcrash. The Snowcrash dog seems like the most likely robot
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_02: to happen in suburbia soon. Yeah, there's a whole bunch of different ways you can go about it.
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_02: Well, it'll be good to be some dap door for the Chinese and they'll take over all of the local
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_02: dog robots and like turn them into an army to attack people. Yeah, I mean, I'm really interested.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_01: Sam Furtitz where I am really interested in the deterrence problem. It's like how do you create
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_01: a security system that actually is deterrent because nobody has created one before. Yeah,
[00:28:04] it's not ADT. No, no. I mean, when we were starting this company, we did a lot of research
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_01: with various components of the military, how the military thinks about gathering data,
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_01: making decisions, choosing what action to take, you know, how to deter threats. Like there's
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_01: actually a lot of research as you can imagine in the military world on this. And so how do you
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_01: then apply that to home security is like a really interesting, I think a really interesting problem.
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is actually by I buy that like instead of having people ADT installed things that don't
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_02: work and then maybe like you just have like a small tank. That would work quite well.
[00:28:45] Yeah, I mean drones tank. I mean, there's a lot of different ways to think about it.
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_01: I was just like to know the other secret stealth day more in co-founded companies.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_08: Hmm, I could think of maybe two more that he has not launched yet. Look, I get why Soren is
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_02: strong because it's like the eye of Soren, right? Like the big birding eye. Yeah, I get it. That's
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_02: like a pretty evil name for the company though. You tried to name your conference room panopticon.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_08: I did name it. No, you named it backwards. It's no different. They're identical.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_01: No, he's bringing you the sign. I say I teed this up for him. I teed this up for him.
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_08: I named my conference room. I ripped this off the wall the way out. Panopticon backwards
[00:29:26] because it was originally panopticon. Knock to Ponep. Knock to Ponep. That's pretty good. It was
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_01: panopticon and serious people told me that serious people went through the building and that is
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_02: not an acceptable name for a conference room. So I had to reverse. First social network.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_08: Is that that was a real thing somebody told you at Facebook? Yes. That's hilarious.
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_01: For what? They weren't on that one. They weren't wrong. Yeah, but like the number of meetings
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_01: I sat in at Facebook where like somebody would like go by on a ripstick. Somebody else would go by
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_01: on a skateboard. Yeah, but there's a difference with like your meeting your meeting with a serious
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_02: person has been booked in panopticon. This is the era of GDPR Dave. This is the era of GDPR.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_08: Oh, by the way, I am happy to see the Europeans are simplifying GDPR. Do you see that? Yeah,
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_02: I thought you'd like, Oh, what's happening? I didn't think the Europeans were capable of positive
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_02: reform. I don't know. I just saw the headline. I think we have to read the fine print. I'm with you.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_08: It seemed notable. Yeah, by the way, it's classic move when you really want to change something.
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_02: You say you're simplifying it. Like that means that you're making it what you want it to be.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_02: Is Grock your go to? For real time news, like if I'm asking this question, like how is GDPR
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: being simplified? Like Grock is really good at this. I do think for those people out there watching,
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_02: like if you ever need to make a change that's hard, just call it a simplification. No one can
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_02: argue with a simplification and you can do whatever you want. True. It's great. Foundry.
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_02: Okay, we're going to stand robots, but before we do, are you wearing a pin of sorts on your
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_08: blouse or is that? Yeah, this is my new mic. Yeah, it's a mic. Oh, I was wondering what that is.
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_01: It's called the Hollyland mic. This is not an ad. And I think it picks a better audio.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_05: What are you talking about? We're sponsored by Hollyland.
[00:31:14] This is what all the creators are using, by the way, because they have to do like walk-in talk video.
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_05: It looks like a gluten external shirt glucose monitor. I'm not going to lie. Oh, I mean,
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_05: I'm happy if people want to think that about me. I do like the quantified self narrative,
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_05: but no, this is just better audio for me because I have high ceilings in this room and I want to be
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_05: close to the bike. Are you using it right now? Yeah. Oh, cool. That sounds good.
[00:31:41] Thank you. Okay, my favorite robots, guys, the waymos have expanded again. They've expanded again.
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_08: Yes, I was in Berlin game yesterday and I was thinking of you. I was meeting with a founder.
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_01: And as the meeting was over, I needed to get back to the North Bay. And so I actually was like,
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_01: okay, how far North can a waymo take me? And so I put Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_01: And I was going to do it, but it was going to take one hour and 15 minutes to go from
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_01: Millbray to the Golden Gate Bridge. That's not that bad. And Rush Hour?
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but an Uber all the way to my house in Marin was less than an hour.
[00:32:22] Yeah, yeah. You sometimes, that's where the one-on-one does you well. But I just,
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_08: but now they can go in freeways. I just read. No, like it was not routing on a freeway.
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_01: It was routing on 85 or whatever it is that goes all the way north. Yeah, I got an email.
[00:32:37] SPEAKER_08: I got the email marketing notice a couple hours ago. Obviously, this was not news to me because
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_08: I've been tracking it very carefully. And it says your rides won't take freeways yet.
[00:32:49] But you can cover San Francisco to San Jose. I thought it did do the airport because I was at
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_01: the airport and I was trying to see if it works. There's confusion about which airports it's doing.
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_08: I got myself in trouble on this because it does not work at SFO as of yesterday. My favorite
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_02: transportation thing of the day, I don't know if you guys have gotten this email,
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_02: this going in the real snotty land. But I've been getting all these messages from like
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_02: charter services we've used over time. Being like, fight the government shutdown of access to these
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_02: airports. Write your senator. And I'm like, this is the least relatable thing you could possibly
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_02: send to a senator. I'd be like, my issue, my issue is that you cannot fly a private plan to
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_02: Dallas for worth right now. That is the big implication of the shutdown fixed the senator. I'm like,
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_02: this is like not going to work. And anyone who thinks it's a good idea to message their senator
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_02: about this has really missed the plot. I'm interested in salmon. Why? Why do we think these airports have
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_08: been shut off? Is it a sign that the private aviation traffic is booming? Wait, what's been shut
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_01: off? You can't fly, you can't fly privately into, there's like 10 airports, they've shut down
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_02: private traffic to that are like really big airports in the country. Because of the shutdown or because
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_05: of something else? Because they have no air traffic controllers. And like, understandably, if you're
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_02: going to like cut, if you're going to cut 10% of commercial flights and let jackasses and their
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_02: jets land there, it's pretty bad luck. It's totally reasonable to be like, hey, just don't fly into
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_02: these 10 airports, right? But it is really funny. Yeah, because there's plenty of airports that you
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_02: can fly into that are nearby. Of course, but it's just really like hilarious. Oh, I thought it was a
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_08: permanent thing. Oh, I don't know. I thought it was because they're out of air traffic controllers.
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_02: It might be permanent. Is that the Mundame thing? Is he's going to block access to JFK for private
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_02: planes? God forbid. I don't think he's going to go there. It's like Tita Burrow is going to boom.
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_02: No one wants to fly into JFK anyway with private planes. Turnable airport. We talked about Waymo,
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_08: we talked about human noise, we talked about Apple. We have to circle back to Apple because you all
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_08: nice enough to humor me on the group chat when the Apple accessory of the moment came out,
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_08: which was a co-brand between Apple and oh god, Dave, what Steve's favorite designer?
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_08: Isi Miyaki. Isi Miyaki, thank you. And this thing, if you have not seen it, is the most ridiculous
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_08: thing I've ever seen. It is a long sock that hangs from your mid forearm to hold your iPhone.
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_08: And this isn't like some kickstarter. Some like this is like Apple is putting this into the world.
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_08: Do we have thoughts on this? They call it an iPhone pocket. And Tiktok is all over this.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_05: You have to have a somewhat vertical horizontal arm to do this. I was thinking of making a meme yesterday,
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_05: but there were already too many of people getting long tube socks and just DIYing one to show how easy
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_05: it is to make your own iPhone pocket. And that's basically what it is. Just imagine a very long sock
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_05: with the hole cut in it so you can stick your arm through. It's like the haze version.
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_02: But it's like no one walks around. They're a butler with a towel. I don't understand. It's just
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_08: not a natural arm position. It's not even a shoulder thing. Isn't it just supposed to be a purse?
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_02: This is my whole purse is in general. Dave, I don't understand how women hold
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_02: purses on their arm. Isn't it awkward? But you hold it in one of your joint areas. You don't hold it.
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_08: This is going to be triceps the world over that are going to be toned.
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_08: They had a photo of it being used as a satchel just which was the crossbody version. So I think
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_05: there might be different lengths of said iPhone pocket. I could see a crossbody version.
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_05: I could see a crossbody version. It's also not a new idea. It's not a new Apple idea.
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_01: You know, during when I worked at Apple in like 2004, we had an iPod sock that Steve launched for
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_01: the iPod Mini. That's just like a case. That's a soft case. That doesn't bother me as much.
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_08: What are you thinking this says about Apple right now, Jess?
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_05: Lost the plot. I mean, I just sort of like, or chilly hasn't lost the plot. What?
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_02: They've got four. It's a four-trillion-dollar company company. They're crushing it.
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_02: They're crushing it. There's no plot lost. I mean, I can't argue with four-trillion, but I'm just like this.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_08: My view is that there maybe they're just throwing people off the scent. Maybe they've got some
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_02: simplification of privacy going on. They want us all talking about the sock so they can simplify
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_02: their privacy. Maybe they're taking a .001% of their market cap and saying like people can just
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_05: do random shit with this iPhone Air, iPhone Pocket. What do you guys want to do? I will never be
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_02: invited to an Apple, but were I invited to an Apple? I would have a group whose only job is
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_02: misdirection. And I'd be like, come up with the dumbest shit and put it out there, but take it
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_02: seriously. We'll see what happens. Is that why you do it slow? Actually, yes. That's exactly
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_02: what we do. It's slow. Is that where etiquette school came from? etiquette school has gone fabulously.
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_02: etiquette school is a huge success. We'll do a check-in. I'll circle back. It's on the agenda.
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_08: Don't skip ahead. I will say I actually want to come to etiquette school next time. He won over
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_01: the skeptics. No, I wasn't skeptical. I enjoy etiquette school. I just thought it was hilarious
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_01: that it was saying I'm teaching it, but as it played out, it made sense. I think it's kind of cool.
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Dave. That's real high. That is my art. My art is I want everyone to think it's
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_02: ridiculous, but it's actually not to be. That's the key. I'd like to attend next time and be
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_01: helpful and wear a suit and see if I can help the founders as well. What's your session?
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_08: What's your session? I don't know. What should my session be saying? We need a
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_02: browser. It needs to be good, but we've had requests now. We got to take it on the road. We've had
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_02: requests from all over the planet to come run etiquette schools in various cities. From all over
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_02: the planet. Like literally, we have an agent. We have an agent request. We have a Middle Easter
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_02: request. We have several in Europe. But American etiquette and Japanese etiquette are totally
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_05: different. So which etiquette are they going to learn? Well, but again, that part of what we can
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_02: add is teaching all these locals Silicon Valley etiquette and how to engage globally, which I think
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_02: is incredibly value add. I actually think your market is quite larger outside of the US than inside
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_05: the US for Silicon Valley etiquette. 100%. It's actually even more useful. Again, I'm extremely
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_02: excited for the Tel Aviv Initiative that was requested. It's going to be great. Premium pricing for
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_05: that one. Yeah. It's going to be great. It's a huge to huge unlock. It is this interesting thing where
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I guess I'm kind of fascinated with it that this is a real thing that people are kind of
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_01: worried about and don't have the skills for. And I think you've kind of established a good point
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_01: about this that there is a there's a real skill set. And maybe there was a gap. I mean, I
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_01: guess I feel lucky. Like I grew up in, you know, the 90s. There was still a store in my hometown
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_01: that sold suits. You know, it was like a big part of my growing up education largely for my grandfather.
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_01: And then in college, there was quite a lot of this going on, but it does seem like, you know,
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_01: there's no I noticed when I was in Boulder last time the suit store is gone. The one's gone in my
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_01: hometown. Like this is just kind of a lost art, but it is important to understand how to how to
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_01: move amongst all these different places. I have a product idea that we should collab on that could
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_05: be an extension of etiquette school. And I think we can vibe code it. No, it's an app. It's called
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_05: maybe pitch practice or elevator pitch. And it doesn't even matter what the content is of the
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_05: pitch itself, like you could be selling someone an iPhone pocket. But you're teaching the found.
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_05: Here's the thing. You're using AI to judge on a percentage basis, 0 to 100. How well this founder
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_05: pitches. So you have to have eye contact intonation, like sell your story, express the problem, express
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_05: the solution. It's all done on zoom. So because most of a lot of founders pitch on zoom. And they're
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_05: going to get a score at the end of it with how effective they were. But they're also looking at
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_05: the set the subtle things like where they dressed well. Did they introduce themselves properly? So
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_05: you're picking up some of these things from etiquette school and throwing them in. And as you said,
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_02: Brad, it's first of all, it's been two points. One is it's all contextual, right? Like there is no
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_02: one. It depends on the audience you're in and the community are in. And actually the number one
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_02: thing about etiquette is being effectively respectful and aware of the culture you're in. So it's
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_02: not the pitching is not the same in every single scenario. Two, I think there's an even simpler one.
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_02: Just do want to just think quick holiday party season is coming up. If you have a cool idea in
[00:41:35] SPEAKER_02: your startup founder and you're going to the Cliner Perkins holiday party for the first time or
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_02: some of these big VC Fests, actually having some coaching before you show up on like how to use
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_02: it well, how to be respectful, like how to dress, how to interact with people, how to meet people,
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_02: how to not, you know, be too pushy all the type of stuff. I think it actually goes a long way.
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_02: So you could do a whole like, we could do a session or an AI thing like a is like so you've
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_02: been invited to holiday parties like a prep session if you wanted to do a zoom thing, right?
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_02: That would do well. We got a good mailing list from the first one. We could do an etiquette for
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_02: holiday parties 30 minute VC conversation deep dive. I think people would crush it. If you would love that.
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_01: Holiday parties can be tricky. Some of them are pretty high stakes. You also need to know when to move
[00:42:18] SPEAKER_05: on from the conversation when you're at a party. That's key. Yes. Well, this is the biggest,
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_02: the biggest point we actually made in etiquette school is when you're at in group settings,
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_02: the worst thing you can do is weigh lay someone in the corner and not stop talking and try to explain
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_02: your whole story like leave them with something where they want to come to you. Don't just like
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_02: tell me the entire operation stack of your company at the first meeting, right? Or because I
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_02: said hello to you, right? I'll never forget the first time I went to the Kleiner Perkins holiday
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: party actually of all of them was one of the most intimidating situations. Such a fun party.
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_08: Such a fun party. But it was one of the most intimidating. They used to have it at like the
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_01: Menlo circus club. Oh, they do. And there's usually a horse greeting it. Yeah, they've done it in the
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_01: city lately. I feel like they moved it back. They did one city and moved back, but the horse is always
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it can be intimidating. How do you greet the horse? How do you greet the horse?
[00:43:16] SPEAKER_02: Sam, I'm going to book you on TI TV for that holiday party etiquette segment,
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_08: three tips and trips, tricks. Absolutely. I mean, I already talked about today's etiquette segment
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_02: on TI TV, but we can go deeper. I know. Well, we'll see how it does.
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_04: The etiquette segments are on TI TV these days. Guys, a lot. We have a lot cooking. We can actually
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_04: just do a whole you can do a whole etiquette show. You can do a whole etiquette show.
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_02: Sam, you've got to make a coffee table book. It should just be huge, right? Yeah, a giant coffee
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_02: table book. Should it be like from the sign fell, but like the book is a coffee table?
[00:43:48] Side table, side table for that. Oh my goodness. Okay, we got to etiquette school. What else is
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_08: happening people in the world of technology? Well, I started my podcast for children.
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_02: Please tell the people. So, Britt, you're going to love this. I found a Sam less than use case for
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_02: AI. I love you guys are aware of the children's podcasts. Who's amazing life? No, all right. It's
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_02: like the thing our kids that was into every single one. It's like basically it's like the life story of
[00:44:15] SPEAKER_02: someone famous with some life lessons in it and the big thing is they don't tell you who it is,
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_02: but the last beat they tell you I am Simone Biles, right? Or something you're guessing. And it's fine.
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_02: Look, two problems are that one are children have actually run out of them because they've
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_02: listened to literally every single one. And like two, I mean, unsurprisingly, unsurprisingly,
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_02: like, again, I'm not against the lessons they're teaching and who's amazing life.
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_02: There's like hundreds of these. They've run out of all of them. Yeah, but they're a very
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_02: particular set. They're a particular set of characters. So like, for instance, I like want
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_02: ones of characters. I admire with lessons like grit and determination and innovation as opposed
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_02: to like inclusion all the time. I get inclusion. I'm not anti-inclusion. I just think there are
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_02: other lessons. So I've created lessons lessons for kids. If it's on Spotify, I've created episodes
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_02: like The Man in the Arena, Theodore Roosevelt, Conquer of Worlds, Alexander the Great,
[00:45:17] SPEAKER_02: The Man Who Questioned Everything, Socrates. And I basically have built like a little process
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_02: where I take a character whose fame is in history. I've got my GPT template. I have it generated
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_02: whose amazing life. I throw in 11 laps. I can generate like five of these in 10 minutes while
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_02: I'm on a conference call. And it's great. They're not perfect. But I got to say they're pretty good,
[00:45:39] SPEAKER_02: right? As like, in like, I get all the lessons I want because I like prioritize these 10 lessons
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_02: and they're fabulous. So I got an AI use case for you, Brit. And lessons lessons for kids.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_02: Can we just slot in a little anecdote from like two years ago on this pod when Sam was anti-Ali?
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_05: Well, I still be I get to be clear. I'm not monetizing. There's not only good business. But for
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_02: instance, the fact that I can generate on the fly an entire episode of a podcast from my children,
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_02: the warrior who would not yield Geronimo or the conscience of a nation, Eleanor Roosevelt is
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_02: like just fabulous. And like, now they don't have now can have my own lessons because I have
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_02: different values. What's generating the voice? Sam, I just use 11 laps default. No one cares.
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_02: Did you guys see that today? 11 laps launched. Matthew McConaughey and Michael Crane as they've
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_05: given their voices to 11 labs officially. Oh, I should make these Matthew McConaughey. That's
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_02: a great idea. I was going to say Matthew McConaughey. I think you should sell your voice also, Sam.
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_05: I don't know. No one needs my voice. I wonder what price you'd get. I don't know, man. You might
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_02: have a bunch of fans. I'm a worry that if you do, the problem is going to be the JP Morgan
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_02: wires that go out once I've sold my voice. Oh, yeah, fair. Yeah. What's Matthew doing about that?
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_05: I was happy. We need to suggest more women. I suggested Catherine Graham and Eleanor Roosevelt.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_08: And I did both of those at dinner when you suggested them. Brad, while we were having a conversation,
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_08: yeah. Yeah. I'm a multitasker. Someone suggested Joan of Arc. I think that's going to have a lot of
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_02: grit and determination stories built into it. Are they accurate? Are these facts accurate?
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_08: They're like pretty close. They're just as close as who's amazing life. Let's put it that way.
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_02: Or our kids going to be in a history test in high school and we're calling some half truth
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_08: about Eleanor Roosevelt from this podcast. No, I think it's fine. They're not perfect.
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_02: I mean, the conqueror of worlds, if you want to start somewhere, the conqueror world's
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_02: Alexander the Great is my favorite episode I've generated so far. But yeah, they're pretty good.
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_02: And I'm much happier with these and the values they promote. So, lessons, lessons for kids.
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_02: Jess, what are the other things that we could learn using Matthew McConaughey's voice?
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_05: I feel like a romance series of podcasts with Matthew McConaughey, narrating, would be like a good
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_05: one to start with. So, Britt, I'm glad you brought this up. And then I'm actually curious. Have
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_08: you guys been following the BBC scandal? I feel like I might have to inject a little news into this.
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_08: No, what's going on? The fact that you have 120 corrections on Gaza in the last 12 months?
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_02: Nope, this has nothing to do with Gaza, but maybe it's related. But the, so we ran an op-ed
[00:48:15] SPEAKER_08: from the founder of, oh my god, I want to say it's called janitor AI, but honestly,
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_08: I have a lot of companies and is it really called that? Yes. It is a platform for romanticcy.
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_08: And it is making the case that explicit chat with characters is not something that should be banned,
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_08: but it or worried about, but is instead in the long line of fiction and women in particular have
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_08: been gravitating towards this from some time. And the app is insanely popular, which will surprise
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_08: no one. And like, you know, I forgot, like some traffic thing had them like fifth in the like
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_08: Gen AI category. What's it called? janitor AI. So I love it. I just type janitor AI into Google,
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_02: and it comes up janitor. This is how you know it's porn janitor. And the tag on it is build, share,
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_02: explore. Instead of AI smut, because they, because they know how to get that, get that ranking.
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_02: AI smut is that a new AI? So we have AI slop and AI smuts so far, our categories for AI
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_05: content. AI smut is like, I, it's like mostly what people want, right? It's slop smut. The
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_02: problem is it's just going to be really hard to monetize. This is way too easy to make. Yeah.
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to end on everyone's favorite topic, the British Broadcasting Company. Okay. But let,
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_08: what's been a while since we've talked about bias in the news, failures of new organizations. So
[00:49:55] SPEAKER_08: the mini scandal, or the scandal was that a British newspaper, the telegraph, got their hands on
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_08: an internal investigation at the BBC over the handling of the editing of its speech Trump gave
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_08: on January 6th. And someone at the BBC had been deputized to look into this topic and had put together
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_08: a pretty damning report about that specifically this video was edited to make it look like Trump
[00:50:25] SPEAKER_08: was supporting the violence on the Capitol. So BBC figured this out and was talking about it
[00:50:34] SPEAKER_08: internally. Another British newspaper brought it to light. He had a lot of resignations at the BBC.
[00:50:39] SPEAKER_08: And of course, like Trump is just piling on saying he has more scouts from the biased liberal media.
[00:50:48] SPEAKER_08: It looks pretty bad. Looks pretty bad. Do you guys have any thoughts? This was like a front page story.
[00:50:54] Just so you know, who made who did the edit? I have no idea. I just feel like people shouldn't
[00:51:00] SPEAKER_02: do that. Like it's like, like what year is it? You think you're not going to get like called out
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_02: on that? Like just don't edit that. Don't do that. How about that? Don't be biased.
[00:51:11] SPEAKER_02: Because you're like, you're not helping anyone. You're just going to create a news cycle with your
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_02: bias that's going to like make you look stupid and down trouble better. Which maybe that was their
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_02: goal. Maybe actually it's a whole deep state campaign by Trump to bias the media against him to
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_02: then come out against media. There we go. Could be that. Could be that. I like that conspiracy.
[00:51:33] SPEAKER_01: Very Trumpi. I could see it. It's like if a bunch of conservatives were like, we're going to get
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_02: jobs at the New York Times as hyper-elebrals and then bias the media against Trump such that Trump
[00:51:43] SPEAKER_02: can then say that would be truly a great deep state conspiracy. Totally. Well, here's the problem,
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_08: guys, because there's all these like shitty errors that companies make for a variety of reasons.
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_08: Sometimes they just pluck up. Sometimes they are biased and flawed. But then it's giving
[00:52:00] SPEAKER_08: ammunition for the Trump administration to just sue everyone up the wazoo, including organizations
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_08: that are doing great work. But they were going to do that anyway. That's a strategy, right? They
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_01: were going to do that anyway. Yeah, but it's a crippling strategy. And I think I have not
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_08: stepped on this. I haven't taken this campaign to the pod before, but we're in a really,
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_08: really dangerous place with all of this. And news organizations that we can talk about Disney,
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_08: right? I mean, they're folding left and right. There's consolidation happening because of this.
[00:52:36] SPEAKER_08: And it is something that deserves more attention. So I'm deep on, I've actually made two investments
[00:52:42] SPEAKER_02: the last 10 days in law fair because it's just clearly what's happening, right? Which is like
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_02: weaponizing the law in various ways for different groups, etc. It's like one of the implications of AI.
[00:52:52] SPEAKER_02: Are you investing it? You investing companies that are using AI to find lawsuits and bundle them
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_02: and sell them, right? And it basically just like, and there's, look, there's a bunch of really bad
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_02: parts of this. There's also a bunch of parts that you can argue are like consumer empowerment, etc.
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_02: Here's the interesting thing about the whole thing. When you really get down to the law and
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_02: financializing it, which is totally what's happening, whether or not you want it to, right? You
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_02: don't get to envision any world you want. There is this problem, which is it's extremely asymmetric
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_02: against the defendant, right? So like, it's very easy to sue people and the cost of defense is
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_02: really high, right? And so it creates this asymmetry, which just from a purely financial perspective,
[00:53:34] SPEAKER_02: will cause tons more lawsuits over time, right? Which both are costly to the thing, but it's also just
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_02: like, there's all sorts of implications to that. And I think one of the things people haven't
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_02: really thought about historically in the way the US courts are designed, the US courts are good,
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_02: and I generally trust them in terms of the outcomes. But laws become such big business and it's so
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_02: financialized at this point that no one's really balanced or played out the equation well,
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_02: such that it financially doesn't make sense to sue someone, right? And so we basically just have
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_02: a system that's going to spin towards more and more lawsuits over everything because that's the
[00:54:05] SPEAKER_02: financial incentive of the whole thing, right? And that's kind of like a, it's pretty bad actually
[00:54:09] SPEAKER_02: when you start doing it. Our system was not designed for the law to be financialized,
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_02: but it also is what it is. This is a fascinating point and totally worthy of a topic, and I also think
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_08: we can't just skip over the fact that news organizations are receiving incredible amounts of threats.
[00:54:28] Totally. Better to lawyer up. And, and, you know, and it's, you got, you have to hold news
[00:54:36] SPEAKER_08: organizations accountable for the mistakes they made and they're not all good and all of that,
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_08: but like, this chilling effect is really, really scary. And I have seen like early,
[00:54:48] just news organizations crumble. They don't stand up to the pressure and it's some, it's for some
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_08: they can't financially, for some it's not worth it, but like, this is a very, very bad time. So
[00:54:59] SPEAKER_08: this BBC thing is unfortunate because it, again, I didn't want, I haven't gone to the source of
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_08: like watching the video yet or all of that, but they were reporting from people I trust seems
[00:55:09] SPEAKER_08: fairly consistent. And obviously, the BBC brought to light that this was, error was made and was
[00:55:15] SPEAKER_08: discussing it internally. And now it's just more ammunition for Trump claiming scouts and suing.
[00:55:22] SPEAKER_08: And, you know, pre lawsuits are being pre-publication lawsuits are becoming something which is very
[00:55:27] SPEAKER_08: scary. You haven't even just for asking the questions and doing your job. So I will say this is the,
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_02: this is I think you've made this point before Jessica and I certainly ascribe to it, which is this
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_02: is one of the really strong anti-substac theories, which is like, you can't as an individual
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_02: support these lawsuits. Like, you can't afford it. It's actually quite expensive to be in the
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_02: news gathering. This isn't quite risky. And so if you're going to do it, you better have the
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_02: pockets and be ready to go to war, which means news and good information is more expensive because,
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_02: not because of the cost of the information, because of the cost of defending it. And there's just
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_02: no way that this kind of like bottoms up community journalism that people like biology here. I'm
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_02: poking biology so that we get more likes on this, right? Like, believe is actually going to play out.
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's interesting for my small corner of the world to point out the acceleration of
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_08: it because a lot has been attended on people who've been critical of Trump in their reporting.
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_08: And we don't write directly about politics so that we do indirectly sometimes. But for us,
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_08: I probably used to spend two hours a month defending our journalism from legal threats.
[00:56:32] SPEAKER_08: And I probably spend two hours a week defending our journalism from legal threats.
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_08: And what time frame has that evolved?
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_08: Last six months, last six months. And with a, you know, expert nature.
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_08: Sorry, say those numbers again. It went from two a month to two a week.
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Like a my time spent on our defense since some ways.
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_05: And that's not political. And this is not in political content, right?
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_05: This is just business journalism, right? So you can only imagine what real news, not real,
[00:57:02] SPEAKER_05: but like you're not. Don't say that. You know what I mean. And I actually don't.
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_08: I haven't looked at how much more we're spending on legal bills. I haven't looked my trusty
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_08: COO has that handled. But every three months, I'm like, up the budget, up the budget,
[00:57:19] SPEAKER_08: because we're not going to back down up the budget. Guys, I got to run, I got to run because I've
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_02: been meeting on late four, but I will certainly leave you with this, which is pretty funny,
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_02: which is I just got an email about Emily Post. I think we have some big things afoot for
[00:57:30] SPEAKER_02: etiquette school. Amazing. We might have some big opportunities. Bye friends.
[00:57:38] Okay. Well, we should we should give all our grave watchers and listeners reprieve from us
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_08: and say a big thank you for tuning in to this wild and ranging episode. We hope you enjoyed.
[00:57:52] SPEAKER_08: I have to say I am counting down the hours until we're chelah.
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_08: I'm turning 40 of a one, but not until December, but no one goes to birthdays in December because
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_05: they have holiday parties. So I'm doing it on Saturday and just will be there. And thank god you
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_08: state your reminder email because I had it down for your actual birthday. So thank you for
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_08: clarifying. And that would have been the biggest disaster. I have an outfit planned and I think
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_08: I'm going to have to run it through AI and add some accoutrements. Yes. All the accoutrements.
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_05: There'll be some there for you as well if you'd like to also accoutrement yourself.
[00:58:31] SPEAKER_05: I think I need more accoutrements. But this is great. This is going to be the chance to celebrate
[00:58:38] SPEAKER_08: all things Brit and I can't wait. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm looking forward to seeing you
