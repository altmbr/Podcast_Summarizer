[00:00:00] The era of the young technologist with ripped jeans and a t-shirt that doesn't understand and disobeys all the rules of a local community.
[00:00:08] Because you're still important even though you're an asshole.
[00:00:11] I think it's just over.
[00:00:12] You know, people are now scared of Silicon Valley.
[00:00:15] It's not some small side show.
[00:00:17] I think the story you show up now is like, I can bring to a lot.
[00:00:20] I can give more than I get.
[00:00:21] I have the technology.
[00:00:23] You can trust me to back it up.
[00:00:24] But I also have the respect to existing your space.
[00:00:30] Because you know what is the yes.
[00:00:32] We'll debate the tech that's best when we get more.
[00:00:36] On less.
[00:00:38] Raven dribbler sandwiches.
[00:00:40] Put it all right to the test.
[00:00:42] More less.
[00:00:44] Well, hello, friends.
[00:00:48] Walking a more or less.
[00:00:51] Hey, Jess.
[00:00:52] We're down a more.
[00:00:53] We're dead.
[00:00:54] Well, we're currently down a more and a less.
[00:00:57] But hold on, Dave, I'm just going to call Sam is supposed to be on this.
[00:01:00] Listen, we've been chasing him down.
[00:01:02] Where is Sam?
[00:01:03] Down now.
[00:01:04] Oh, are you on?
[00:01:07] I'm getting on right now.
[00:01:08] I'm just leaving the first season.
[00:01:09] Great.
[00:01:10] You're on air.
[00:01:11] We're taping.
[00:01:12] So yeah.
[00:01:13] So great.
[00:01:14] We'll see you soon.
[00:01:15] Okay.
[00:01:16] Bye.
[00:01:17] We got it.
[00:01:18] Well, Dave, today.
[00:01:19] Do you know what day today is?
[00:01:22] The man in a suit at the four seasons.
[00:01:25] It's etiquette day.
[00:01:27] I cannot wait to hear that the pod will be the first to report back from the slow ventures etiquette school.
[00:01:37] So I should have put on a suit and gone into the city today.
[00:01:40] But here I am.
[00:01:41] Oh, my God.
[00:01:42] Dave, if you had shown up, you would have raised the bar.
[00:01:45] I've actually got a closet full of good suits.
[00:01:48] But with the rare instance to wear them.
[00:01:52] Well, Sam, you know, he dawned on this morning or cowboy boots.
[00:01:56] Now that he's not on the pod currently, I'll never listen to this.
[00:01:58] I can say I'd probably update the shoe.
[00:02:02] Well, it's going to be a fun episode.
[00:02:03] We are going to miss Brett who has a conflict.
[00:02:06] But.
[00:02:07] Yeah.
[00:02:08] Board meetings.
[00:02:09] Sometimes board meetings.
[00:02:10] You know, sometimes they take precedent.
[00:02:12] I mean, I promise you.
[00:02:15] People have taped podcast during board meetings before they've shopped on Amazon.
[00:02:19] They've sold Instagram.
[00:02:21] They would not be the first.
[00:02:23] I did a board meeting this morning.
[00:02:25] And the last board meeting for this company was in person.
[00:02:29] And it was shockingly less productive over zoom.
[00:02:33] Well, we've shocking the last productive over zoom.
[00:02:36] Here he is straight from etiquette school.
[00:02:39] A gray suit.
[00:02:40] I'm surprised.
[00:02:41] Hey, this is a, this is a briani suit, Dave.
[00:02:45] Is that a blue tie for the blue wave happening in New York right now, Sam?
[00:02:50] Absolutely not.
[00:02:52] Okay, give us the top three bullets.
[00:02:54] You are fresh moments out of etiquette school.
[00:02:57] We've been hearing about it for months.
[00:02:59] Did it deliver so delivered?
[00:03:02] In fact, I'm real.
[00:03:03] I just walked out and I realized I forgot to take the gift basket, which I'm annoyed about because it was great.
[00:03:10] Wilks backshared.
[00:03:12] Wait, I thought we said there's no gifts baskets anymore.
[00:03:16] We will, Spasher, go get that stuff.
[00:03:20] We got Wilks back for gift certificates.
[00:03:22] We had several models modeling different styles for different types of events.
[00:03:27] We had caviar and wine tasting and etiquette points, as well as a lot of points about how to manage a company
[00:03:35] and the etiquette and setting etiquette rules inside your company, how to be comfortable in a room, how to show up.
[00:03:42] I'm expecting many several journalists were there.
[00:03:45] I can watch the clips are good rolling.
[00:03:47] No one from the information.
[00:03:49] I don't know why that was, but I will, it delivered fabulous sleep.
[00:03:53] We're just, we're in our WTF come down.
[00:03:56] So we're, we're just doing that from last week.
[00:03:59] Did you know, one thing I picked up, I didn't realize that it's a good idea.
[00:04:03] You should always let the Somali A have a taste of a nice wine if you open a bottle.
[00:04:10] Never occurred to, I didn't know that.
[00:04:13] So this is for the Napa, the Napa weekend, etiquette weekend that you have to host next.
[00:04:18] Well, I also, I didn't realize I'd never had a caviar bump.
[00:04:22] You ever had a caviar bump?
[00:04:24] I don't know, I don't think so.
[00:04:26] But like a cocaine bump, like what?
[00:04:28] Yeah, well, you kind of put it on your hand the same way.
[00:04:30] The point is you don't, you don't, isn't bump a drug word?
[00:04:33] I don't know, they call it caviar bump.
[00:04:35] Anyway, I learned a lot.
[00:04:37] The founders had a great time and we learned a lot about practical, like how to approach sitting culture in your company
[00:04:44] and how to think about showing up a room with a low heart rate and giving more than you get.
[00:04:50] And a lot of actually having very important lessons.
[00:04:52] How do you show up into a room with a low heart rate?
[00:04:55] Yeah, what's the low heart rate advice?
[00:04:58] There's two ways to think about you show up in a fancy room for the first time.
[00:05:02] One is mentality of scarcity.
[00:05:06] This is your one chance to meet this important person or impress someone or like do the right thing.
[00:05:12] Your heart rate is up.
[00:05:14] You're over pitching, you're strategy, you're trying to, your pitch is too long.
[00:05:19] You're not, you're occupying too much people's time versus a low heart.
[00:05:23] You say like, look, I deserve to be in this room.
[00:05:27] I, you know, I'm not stressed about it.
[00:05:29] I was invited. I have something to add.
[00:05:32] You know, I'm going to give more than I get to the conversation.
[00:05:36] And I think just, you know, a lot of etiquette comes down to being comfortable in different spaces and showing up as yourself and giving more than you get.
[00:05:45] So the very successful event.
[00:05:47] We will do many more.
[00:05:48] Everyone got a certificate of completion and there was a graduation ceremony, which went great, but all in all great event.
[00:05:54] Wow.
[00:05:55] And how many people attended?
[00:05:57] 50.
[00:05:58] Now there was a long wait list.
[00:05:59] We only had a room.
[00:06:00] They get a hold of 50.
[00:06:01] So we'll have to up size next time.
[00:06:03] Who is the great etiquette expert of all time?
[00:06:05] I would have never called Sam for writing the book, you know, becoming Silicon Valley's.
[00:06:11] Was it Emily Post or the, you know, the original?
[00:06:14] Yeah.
[00:06:15] Well, there's sort of it isn't there.
[00:06:17] I think every time needs an etiquette expert, I might, I might posit.
[00:06:21] I think sometimes the most likely heroes are the ones who emerge, you know, no, I'm kidding.
[00:06:27] But I think it's a, it's a good, it's a good turn for, for Sam.
[00:06:31] I mean, our boys are now talking about etiquette dinner.
[00:06:34] They're like asking me to re-enter a room so that they can stand up.
[00:06:40] Actually, this is a good extension, Sam.
[00:06:43] I think doing the children of Silicon Valley.
[00:06:48] The etiquette class would be quite great because there's not very many spaces where kids have to learn, particularly on the West Coast.
[00:06:56] Atticus is fundamentally by showing respect for the environment you're in.
[00:06:59] And I think it's just more important.
[00:07:01] The era of the young technologist with ripped jeans and a t-shirt that doesn't understand and disobeys all the rules of a local community.
[00:07:10] But it doesn't matter because they're kind of the interesting new novelty.
[00:07:14] And in some ways, you show how important you are by how shittily you behave because you're still important, even though you're an asshole.
[00:07:23] I think it's just over.
[00:07:24] You know, people are now scared of Silicon Valley.
[00:07:27] It's not some small side show.
[00:07:29] You know, people are aware of their jobs.
[00:07:32] People are worried about the impact on the economy and business.
[00:07:35] And I think it's important for leaders who'll show up.
[00:07:38] And say, I have respect for this environment.
[00:07:40] I respect for this context, whether it's investors or people that you need to build trust with as employees or customers.
[00:07:46] I respect you.
[00:07:47] And I'm going to follow the rules of etiquette in your space.
[00:07:51] And I think you win a lot by that.
[00:07:53] And this is the thing, like, you know, the YC story of all you need is part of market fit and move on.
[00:07:58] I think it's just like a very antiquated story.
[00:08:01] I think the story you need to show up now is like, I can bring to a lot.
[00:08:04] I can give more than I get.
[00:08:06] And I think the technology you can trust me to back it up.
[00:08:08] But I also respect who is a seer space.
[00:08:11] So we're long etiquette.
[00:08:13] The trust thing is interesting.
[00:08:14] And this was a big.
[00:08:15] So I wrapped my WTF women's conference.
[00:08:17] I'm sorry you couldn't stage your protest this year next year.
[00:08:22] No, no queens, as Sam says.
[00:08:25] Dave, you're joining for that.
[00:08:27] Oh, absolutely.
[00:08:28] I'm co-hosting it with you.
[00:08:30] There's a long list of people who would like to join in my DMs.
[00:08:34] So the no queens WTF protests.
[00:08:37] It's not a real event unless it's protested.
[00:08:40] It'd be great.
[00:08:41] We might go to a bigger venue too.
[00:08:42] So you guys will have more space to protest.
[00:08:44] Fantastic.
[00:08:45] I'm going to get I am going to get the protest sponsored.
[00:08:48] But light.
[00:08:49] But light needs back into ours.
[00:08:51] A man's manosphere.
[00:08:52] Do you think that but light will go to several million dollars to protest the WTF conference to see it back into the manosphere?
[00:08:58] As long as your protest is not more lucrative than my event, I'll be okay.
[00:09:02] Did you say man or manosphere or man or sphere?
[00:09:05] Oh, the man or sphere.
[00:09:08] I'm into it.
[00:09:11] But what I was going to say and guys, we're going to talk some tech news this week.
[00:09:14] I know I know that's shocking.
[00:09:15] But one of the most interesting themes and discussions was about Silicon Valley's reputation with actually the woman who's run Palantir's comms for 20 years or so.
[00:09:27] And I was really pushing her on.
[00:09:30] You know, like it's so funny.
[00:09:33] The reputation of tech does keep getting worse and worse and worse and by reputation.
[00:09:38] I mean like, you know, yes, we know that the government's had his issues with it, but public trust is low.
[00:09:44] And there's a real tension there because these products are beloved.
[00:09:49] And you know, if you threaten to take away my Amazon same day delivery, you're coming for you.
[00:09:54] But I think as Silicon Valley is seeking capital for new places and new types of businesses and new stakeholders is dealing obviously with governments around the world.
[00:10:05] I can I can make the case that actually not showing up as the contrary and in jeans and hoodie, you know, make sense.
[00:10:14] The flip side is if you're the hot thing, you're the hot thing and you can show up in your pajamas and no one's going to care.
[00:10:19] But for everyone, he's not the hottest thing.
[00:10:22] I think there's a lot to that.
[00:10:24] Who's the hottest thing anyway?
[00:10:26] I think technology is becoming increasingly open AI, open AI.
[00:10:30] Sim Maulman, I mean, look at him. He can still show up, you know, anywhere in the world looking like a.
[00:10:35] They're actually huge.
[00:10:37] I mean, they're what it, I don't know, trillion dollar company.
[00:10:40] They're like a Meg seven now, right?
[00:10:42] No, they are. They're also the hot thing.
[00:10:44] They're both. I mean that.
[00:10:46] They're not you can't even call them a startup anymore, right? They're just like.
[00:10:49] I wasn't calling a startup, but I was started up. I was calling him the hot thing.
[00:10:52] The hot thing. Yeah.
[00:10:54] But Jess, I actually think for what it's worth, it's interesting you mentioned that because I actually argue that for all of my graves to Sim Maulman, he actually has great etiquette.
[00:11:02] Back your up.
[00:11:03] He wears a suit. Well, he shows up in the other places.
[00:11:06] He's not showing up in like the Saudis with PJs.
[00:11:10] He's showing up and looking right and saying the right stuff.
[00:11:13] And so I think that's a great example of how the world has changed.
[00:11:16] And I don't.
[00:11:17] I guess he shows up on his own dev conference videos and PJs or whatever, but just a little bit different.
[00:11:22] Well, but he's always in a t-shirt and jeans, but that's like that's the right etiquette for developer conferences, right?
[00:11:28] Yeah.
[00:11:29] No, I don't think he's like disrespectful and you're right.
[00:11:32] I have to need quite a respectful.
[00:11:34] And I think that's actually kind of the trick here is what's going on is I actually get eyes at great example of a place where there's so much stress around it.
[00:11:42] The etiquette and being in the culture that you're selling to you and building trust with that culture really matter.
[00:11:48] And you're raising a good trillion dollars.
[00:11:51] You're going to need the customs and need people where they're at.
[00:11:54] And that's actually the sign of like the idea that I spent the time to learn your culture and match it and be part of it as opposed to rolling into you know the UAE and a t-shirt and saying fuck you give me money is like that's the arrow or it.
[00:12:07] Yeah, and so you roll in.
[00:12:10] Yeah, I'm going to refrain from saying the next thing you don't roll in the White House right in 2025 right and say like I'm a technologist like whatever you roll it and you look the part and you shake hands properly and you bring and you bring a gift.
[00:12:25] And you bring Trump a gift gold played a gift you bring a gift.
[00:12:30] Yeah, gifts gifts are the key for this culture.
[00:12:33] How did gift giving show up at etiquette school after I revealed my book gifting habits so many different people thought that I was talking about them on the pod really.
[00:12:44] When I like haunted and you know what I would not I think I went on about like my airport hunt for the perfect book that's like one out of five books I give the others are like top of the pile kind of thing.
[00:12:59] And so I guess I've given a lot of books but but yeah now now I feel the bars raised on the caliver of each but the only thing I will say on gifts giving is probably the classiest person at the event of course showed up and gave me a beautiful gift.
[00:13:13] So gift giving is alive and well.
[00:13:16] Thank goodness.
[00:13:18] Okay, has anyone been paying attention to the news this week just checking anyone in the session.
[00:13:23] Sam's been preparing for etiquette school.
[00:13:25] Well, here are a couple headlines who have jumped up.
[00:13:28] Okay, so most recently shocker Google and Apple are doing a Siri deal.
[00:13:34] So Siri is going to be powered by Gemini essentially until until Apple quote figures it out but there there seems to be this pattern here of Apple realizing Google is is pretty good at this stuff and they'll be pretty good at other things.
[00:13:54] So I mean the most interesting thing to me about this is like open AI got the initial deal by basically being faster at bish dev than Google but in the fullness of time.
[00:14:07] Google got in there.
[00:14:08] I'm quite annoyed I don't own about to Google stock for what it's worth.
[00:14:12] You say this every week.
[00:14:14] We've been talking about this for several episodes. Why aren't you activating.
[00:14:18] It doesn't really easily fit in my apartment.
[00:14:21] Expensive in expensive but it's also just like it doesn't really fit in my life.
[00:14:26] From a practical perspective.
[00:14:27] What is being a passive shareholder contribute to your daily responsibilities.
[00:14:33] So the man in a suit in a SUV driving through Silicon Valley.
[00:14:38] Way by the way.
[00:14:39] I wish I wish I were I'm not because I have to come to Hillsboro but no, I just like the problem is here's my problem with public equities.
[00:14:46] It's to invest enough in them that it matters.
[00:14:50] Just takes a lot of cash like post tax cash.
[00:14:54] And you can't get crazy early stage venture to return to those nor at three trillion whatever is it like a total portfolio stabilizer.
[00:15:06] So it's just like really hard to figure out how to invest in it meaningfully.
[00:15:09] I mean, I did this. I'll tell you my story with this is a 10 x ago.
[00:15:13] I called some friends and I said I really want to buy a bunch of cloud flare stock.
[00:15:17] And they kind of were trying to talk me out of it.
[00:15:20] I did buy a little bit.
[00:15:22] It's a 10 x over five years.
[00:15:25] But I didn't have the balls to put enough into it that it matters.
[00:15:28] So it just becomes like.
[00:15:31] And that's my problem with Google stock is like if you had doubles.
[00:15:35] That's not venture style returns.
[00:15:38] It's a very concentrated position and use of cash.
[00:15:41] So I just haven't figured out in my life how to invest in public equities.
[00:15:45] That's reasonable. You can best know other things.
[00:15:48] I will say I was this week years old when I figured out that Gemini can read my email and add things to my calendar.
[00:15:58] Game changing.
[00:16:00] Like you know when you were like juggling and someone like schedule something and you don't.
[00:16:05] You're not like at a place where you can conveniently enter it to your calendar or you're at your phone.
[00:16:10] But you're also on the phone and then you enter it for the wrong day.
[00:16:13] And then your doctor's appointment is ruined or whatever.
[00:16:17] That happens to me a lot.
[00:16:19] Now I just talk to Gemini and say,
[00:16:22] next Thursday at 430, make an item for this.
[00:16:26] And now series set.
[00:16:29] That's the use case everybody wants out of Siri anyway.
[00:16:32] Yeah.
[00:16:33] Also I here's a pro tip.
[00:16:35] I highly recommend connecting Gemini to your Gmail.
[00:16:39] Then asking it to analyze your email.
[00:16:42] Responding in some way, right?
[00:16:44] I asked it analyze the emails.
[00:16:46] I have not responded to after the last over the last month and identify patterns and give me tips for better response.
[00:16:54] So I think that's not.
[00:16:56] Some of those emails I don't intend to respond to.
[00:16:59] But it actually had.
[00:17:00] It had to be obvious suggestions, but it bucketed them in ways.
[00:17:05] That made me realize I get a lot of emails that are sort of status updates.
[00:17:09] But then sometimes there's a request for information below in this full thing.
[00:17:13] So anyway, that was my Gemini move.
[00:17:15] But Dave, so what do you think this means for Apple and Siri?
[00:17:18] Are people finally going to want to use Siri?
[00:17:21] Maybe.
[00:17:22] I mean, I think people use Siri all the time, but it's just frustrating compared to the state of the art.
[00:17:29] So this sounds to me like it's going to bring it up to speed.
[00:17:34] And I haven't read any of the news.
[00:17:36] So I'm just reacting to you telling me now, but sounds to me like the same thing is this Safari search deal.
[00:17:42] Right.
[00:17:43] Like there's this famous story that Steve Jobs actually wanted to buy Google way back.
[00:17:48] If you go way back in the old old old stories of the valley, there's a famous story about iCloud when it was first going it was originally called dot Mac.
[00:17:58] And there was like a really terrible mis execution.
[00:18:01] Steve was super upset that the execution didn't happen fast enough and had a bunch of errors.
[00:18:07] And so the story goes that he famously like stormed in to the executive meeting was like we should just buy Google.
[00:18:13] And at that point in time was not actually a crazy idea evaluation.
[00:18:18] And instead they ended up doing this massive search deal that we all know today, you know, powered search.
[00:18:24] And they just didn't get into the search business and instead focused their resources on the iPhone and everything that we know of is Apple's market cap today.
[00:18:33] And so I think you could look at this as a very similar strategy move on their part where getting into the foundation model game is extremely capital intensive.
[00:18:43] They've shown only an appetite to invest something like 10 maybe 20% of their operating cash flow in AI infrastructure.
[00:18:51] They're not willing to spend 70 80% like meta or Amazon or Microsoft.
[00:18:59] And so this makes strategic choice based on the you know chess pieces on the board as we see them as my view and gets kind of the 80% of use cases that people probably want out of Siri anyway.
[00:19:12] And then if there's like a long game here, it's the one we've been talking about on the pod for a long time, which is that I think Apple likely is looking much more at the silicon, you know, level and the edge level on their devices.
[00:19:28] And how do they bring innovation to super small on device models and this sort of notion that sometime in the far future, there's going to be a eyes in the cloud and a eyes on the edge device.
[00:19:40] And they're going to sort of interpret each other and give you what you want in a bunch of different ways.
[00:19:45] And if I'm Apple, like I'm focused entirely on the edge and I let everybody else play this high cap X foundation game.
[00:19:53] So you guys know developers using that like say I want to go to your point, but also to add if you know Sam, like so I've talked to I've talked to people who are moving towards apples like effectively as small on the device.
[00:20:07] I've also talked to people like it's not going to work anytime soon the devices over.
[00:20:11] He it doesn't actually work yet, etc.
[00:20:14] Doesn't work today.
[00:20:15] Here's the interesting story.
[00:20:17] Elon Musk last week, I think tweeted this thing as part of earnings that I think is like kind of a big meta picture who knows, but I think is an interesting point.
[00:20:27] He's like Tesla does not going to need to build some big AI infrastructure because the cars of the AI infrastructure.
[00:20:35] And when the car is not driving, we'll just like run AI workloads on the cars. Right.
[00:20:40] Now the reason that is interesting.
[00:20:42] What is the reason that I think is that I think I'm going to be able to get home all over again.
[00:20:45] Well, I just think it's this distributed thing or like if you have an iPhone or a Tesla or there's a reason someone is going to pay for the computer.
[00:20:52] Right.
[00:20:53] For other things.
[00:20:54] And then you can just use it when it's not being used.
[00:20:57] And you have this huge effectively virtual.
[00:21:00] virtual cloud and compute floating around.
[00:21:03] I can totally imagine that a workload
[00:21:05] that's gonna be incredibly effective for it.
[00:21:06] We'll be effective for everything, right?
[00:21:08] But like, especially the networking gets strong enough,
[00:21:11] you know, whether it's Starlink or whatever,
[00:21:13] and that's obviously not even close to enough.
[00:21:16] You can totally imagine these different configurations
[00:21:17] where they're very good if people,
[00:21:19] instead of you having to buy the computers,
[00:21:22] people buy the computers for something else for you,
[00:21:24] and then you can just kind of use them all the side.
[00:21:27] What does it say to the iPhone?
[00:21:28] iPhone is a shitload of compute people are buying
[00:21:31] to use as iPhones, but if you're Apple,
[00:21:35] you know, they're basically paying for your CapEx
[00:21:37] in that way, right?
[00:21:38] In a way that if you're Google or whatever,
[00:21:39] you have to actually buy yourself.
[00:21:41] That said, look, my big macro-tact,
[00:21:42] though, is like the only thing I use chat you can see for really
[00:21:46] is there's a set of questions
[00:21:48] which are better answered by an LLM
[00:21:50] because you want to follow up on them
[00:21:51] versus a single shot into a Google search.
[00:21:53] That is true, right?
[00:21:54] And like, it's not that many queries,
[00:21:56] and they're not the most monetizable in my experience,
[00:21:58] but they're non-zero.
[00:22:00] I do think in those types of use cases,
[00:22:02] the race to the interface does matter.
[00:22:04] I never review Siri, I always disable it
[00:22:06] because it's a piece of shit.
[00:22:07] But if all of a sudden it did night.
[00:22:09] Disable, wow.
[00:22:11] I just say it doesn't work,
[00:22:12] but you disable what?
[00:22:14] Siri, I just like, when they're like turn on Siri,
[00:22:17] I'm like, no, right?
[00:22:18] If Siri basically was just Gemini though,
[00:22:21] and was the top of the stack,
[00:22:22] and I can single-click it off the side of my iPhone
[00:22:24] or something by default,
[00:22:25] and probably would use that for most of my workloads,
[00:22:28] right?
[00:22:29] They're like random consumer things versus chat GPT, right?
[00:22:32] And so I do think that really does not
[00:22:34] or from a competitive landscape perspective.
[00:22:36] I'm hearing more and more people
[00:22:38] and liking chat GPT and Gemini
[00:22:40] because they just don't have to skip,
[00:22:42] like it's just the search experience
[00:22:44] has really gotten quite bad.
[00:22:46] Wait, the Google search experience,
[00:22:49] like the original OG, yeah, totally.
[00:22:51] I mean, I barely use it anymore.
[00:22:52] I'll be looking up some brand
[00:22:54] and my brain knows that the first three
[00:22:56] are gonna be competitors bidding against the brand
[00:22:59] and then the second two are gonna be the brand
[00:23:01] at some major retailer that has better SEO than the brand
[00:23:05] and it's somewhere in the line.
[00:23:07] All right, I'm gonna find the brand,
[00:23:08] but this is where their AI overviews
[00:23:12] might change the game too, but I guess how,
[00:23:16] one of my questions is just like,
[00:23:17] what's the relative capability or feature set
[00:23:20] of these John device models versus other things, right?
[00:23:23] Like can they do a tenth of what CloudGerman LLM can do?
[00:23:28] Can they do a percentage of it?
[00:23:30] I mean, I'm sure it varies, but I just don't have a sense
[00:23:33] of like how far along they are.
[00:23:36] You think they have your photos?
[00:23:37] Okay.
[00:23:38] You can actually download, there's a few apps.
[00:23:40] I think one of them's called Simply AI
[00:23:44] or Locally AI.
[00:23:45] Let me look it up.
[00:23:46] Yeah, Locally AI.
[00:23:47] And it's just somebody built a simple iOS wrapper
[00:23:51] that you can talk directly to the foundation model
[00:23:54] that's on the phone.
[00:23:55] And it's interesting to just take queries
[00:23:57] that you're doing using the Cloud models
[00:24:00] and see what the difference is, right?
[00:24:02] There you go, that's great.
[00:24:04] And yeah, you know, they feel, it feels
[00:24:07] whatever, significantly less smart,
[00:24:11] but it's not stupid, right?
[00:24:13] Like I don't know what the exact differential is.
[00:24:16] We'd have to go look it up.
[00:24:17] But the thing's there and it's running.
[00:24:20] And you know, it's doing a lot of things
[00:24:22] on the phone already.
[00:24:24] But to Sam's point, like we are a ways off
[00:24:27] from developers being able to use these things
[00:24:30] and high velocity important workloads.
[00:24:33] And they certainly can't do really advanced things
[00:24:37] with photo, video, these types of things,
[00:24:39] even large context windows.
[00:24:40] Like we're just way off from that.
[00:24:42] It's also, I guess the question is,
[00:24:44] how much is it to me a direct competitor
[00:24:47] to the big guys are sort of like the whole market's growing
[00:24:50] and this is a compliment.
[00:24:51] And I mean, I guess in theory, open AI
[00:24:54] and in Thropic can develop these models too.
[00:24:55] They don't have the like hardware advantage
[00:24:59] and sort of designing and all in.
[00:25:01] Though they're racing towards it.
[00:25:03] Yeah, though they are.
[00:25:05] They clearly see it as strategic and important, right?
[00:25:07] They're launching browsers to compete with Google.
[00:25:11] They're launching, you know, they acquired Johnny Ivan crew
[00:25:14] to compete with Apple.
[00:25:16] They view it as like, you know, competition
[00:25:19] across the entire technology surface, right?
[00:25:23] They do, they do.
[00:25:25] For those who are close followers of this,
[00:25:26] the information has all of Anthropics latest numbers,
[00:25:29] published this week.
[00:25:31] Someone tweeted, the information is the new SEC filing.
[00:25:35] But okay, so works sort of not really.
[00:25:39] But what's notable is just,
[00:25:41] now you should start running the private market.
[00:25:43] Yeah.
[00:25:45] No conflict, no interest.
[00:25:47] If you just were like, look, we're gonna get them anyway
[00:25:50] to give them us and convince them.
[00:25:52] That was a joke, by the way, yes.
[00:25:55] Sorry, go ahead, yes.
[00:25:56] You should just convince them to come and be like,
[00:25:58] look, we can do this the easy way or the hardware,
[00:26:00] just like give us all this shit.
[00:26:01] Like, it's like, we're gonna get it either way.
[00:26:05] All your numbers.
[00:26:06] So you should just send them to me.
[00:26:07] Email submissionatthewformation.com
[00:26:11] and send us all your numbers.
[00:26:12] I think the companies could honestly care less
[00:26:14] that we get these numbers.
[00:26:16] I will say they don't give them to us.
[00:26:17] People always come up to me, they're like,
[00:26:19] oh, do an open AI's dirty work for them
[00:26:22] by publishing their numbers.
[00:26:23] I'm like, you had not really.
[00:26:25] But so VCs assume that these companies
[00:26:28] like Beggus to do this, I will be on their record saying,
[00:26:31] they do not, I also think they don't care.
[00:26:34] They have huge investor bases, these numbers, all,
[00:26:38] I mean, this haven't went bite dance, got big,
[00:26:40] and you know, you have X number of investors
[00:26:42] and you start hosting quarterly phone calls
[00:26:44] with your investors, right?
[00:26:47] It's not, and a number of these numbers are forecast
[00:26:52] that we know also when we report them are just that.
[00:26:55] But there are a lot of interesting nuggets.
[00:26:58] And I think they're interesting roadmaps
[00:27:00] for like important reporting to do
[00:27:03] when you see patterns in their forecast.
[00:27:05] You're like, okay, wait, what, why would that go up
[00:27:07] by so much, right?
[00:27:08] And then it triggers interesting questions.
[00:27:10] So, but, you know, headline, surging,
[00:27:14] I mean, anthropic surging.
[00:27:18] The businesses are using a lot of the AI.
[00:27:20] Code.
[00:27:21] It's code, it's all code.
[00:27:23] It's code.
[00:27:24] Yeah.
[00:27:25] That's my menu's case.
[00:27:26] I don't use it for anything else.
[00:27:27] And that market's getting bigger,
[00:27:29] but I mean, it's kind of wild.
[00:27:31] Other big headline of the week,
[00:27:33] I don't know if the VCs are gonna wanna talk about it,
[00:27:35] but I don't particularly care.
[00:27:38] New stewards at Sequoia,
[00:27:40] Rolof announced he was stepping aside
[00:27:45] with Alfred and Pat taking over.
[00:27:48] And DaVanera.
[00:27:49] I can tell you what the news world thought of this
[00:27:51] when the VC world think about it.
[00:27:53] I like Rolof, I like Alfred.
[00:27:56] Who's the third guy, Pat Grady?
[00:27:57] Pat Grady.
[00:27:58] I don't know, I don't know Pat Grady that well,
[00:28:00] but the other two I quite like are both good guys.
[00:28:03] The VCs are speechless.
[00:28:04] Look at them, they want to say a thing.
[00:28:06] I don't, I, I think what you said,
[00:28:09] you said the word is steward.
[00:28:11] And it's an interesting choice of words.
[00:28:13] That's what they call it.
[00:28:14] That's not my word, that's their word.
[00:28:16] Well, that is just like so telling, right?
[00:28:18] Because it's just like that.
[00:28:19] And they think of themselves as stewards of capital
[00:28:21] as stewards of a firm.
[00:28:22] Like I'm not, I don't know enough about Sequoia
[00:28:24] and how much it actually matters, right?
[00:28:26] Like who's in the seat?
[00:28:27] They're both good, like Rolof is a good guy.
[00:28:29] Alfred's a good guy.
[00:28:29] I kinda doubt.
[00:28:31] And like there's, you're gonna see some like massive shakeup
[00:28:33] and what Sequoia is or what they do inherited.
[00:28:36] So it's like good, doesn't matter.
[00:28:40] I wouldn't want to run that firm.
[00:28:41] Tell the people what heritage is,
[00:28:43] people might not be familiar.
[00:28:45] Heritage is the real Sequoia,
[00:28:46] which is where all the money actually is.
[00:28:49] Which is where the partner's personal,
[00:28:51] like combined family, obviously.
[00:28:53] I think it's far beyond that.
[00:28:55] It's like a massive,
[00:28:56] no, it's, it's like more like an iconic at this point.
[00:28:59] It's huge.
[00:29:00] But it's like, I think it did start out of the partner's money,
[00:29:02] but it's gotten way bigger than that.
[00:29:04] It's kind of where the action is.
[00:29:05] This Sequoia world.
[00:29:06] It's the venture funds are still the venture funds,
[00:29:09] but like most of the assets are not in the venture funds.
[00:29:11] They're in heritage.
[00:29:13] What is heritage invest in?
[00:29:15] I know the answer to that.
[00:29:16] And literally everything.
[00:29:18] They're like true capitalists, which I respect.
[00:29:20] Davis Settlers.
[00:29:21] Yeah, they're like a massive capital allocator,
[00:29:24] like on the level of the, you know, Harvard endowment
[00:29:28] or the iconic, you know,
[00:29:29] they're one of the largest LPs in the world.
[00:29:32] And they, yeah, they're just like,
[00:29:33] I mean, I actually respect it.
[00:29:34] It's just like straight capitalism.
[00:29:36] It's not venture capitalism.
[00:29:37] It's just capitalism.
[00:29:38] Oh, yeah, I thought that was over venture capitalism.
[00:29:41] I will say, you know, I served on the board of event bright
[00:29:44] with Rolloff for close to a decade.
[00:29:48] He's one of the smartest people I've ever interacted with.
[00:29:51] I don't think anybody disagrees on that.
[00:29:54] So I hope everything's okay, you know,
[00:29:57] seems like a short, short window that he was the steward.
[00:30:00] So sad to see him go, but I grew with Sam.
[00:30:03] Like that's a, it's a big machine over there.
[00:30:05] And Alfred's great.
[00:30:06] Donald, he was a mentor to me during the past years,
[00:30:09] gave me a lot of great advice.
[00:30:11] I think the world of him.
[00:30:12] I don't know Pat that well either.
[00:30:13] So I will say this, which is,
[00:30:15] if you're like, why would Rolloff only be the steward
[00:30:18] of Sequoia for the year?
[00:30:19] The Sam Lesson brain is like, well, first of all,
[00:30:21] the title is steward.
[00:30:22] That sounds like a terrible job.
[00:30:24] And second of all, like, who wants to run a big institution?
[00:30:28] Like, I don't know.
[00:30:29] If I were him, I'd be out of there less than three years.
[00:30:31] So I know he's not me, but it's not that surprising to me.
[00:30:34] It sounds like a not fun job.
[00:30:36] The prior steward's word did it over a decade.
[00:30:38] That's I think the thing that everybody's asking, right?
[00:30:41] Well, let me, let me introduce some facts
[00:30:43] into the conversation, right?
[00:30:45] Or just some, I don't know, that's too strong a thing.
[00:30:49] I think this is right, but honestly, it's all a blur.
[00:30:52] Rolloff really fought for that job.
[00:30:53] And he fought, I believe with Neil Shen.
[00:30:56] So, I mean, and I think Rolloff deserves
[00:30:58] a tremendous amount of credit for untangling the mess
[00:31:02] that was Sequoia and Sequoia China.
[00:31:04] And I think that from like a non-deal-making structure
[00:31:08] kind of like defines his, like, was one of the trickier
[00:31:12] high-wire acts in venture capitalism and geopolitics, right?
[00:31:17] But he also was the guy who were not going to sell anything ever,
[00:31:20] right?
[00:31:21] Which is like, it was a big at the moment.
[00:31:22] It wasn't big like idea.
[00:31:24] Yes.
[00:31:25] You know, again, it wasn't likely that Neil was going to be
[00:31:28] the steward of Sequoia given all of this,
[00:31:30] but Neil had bite dance, Neil had right.
[00:31:33] So, it was, and maybe this was overplayed somewhat
[00:31:37] because VCs like to overplay all personnel matters
[00:31:40] and perhaps reporters do the same from time to time.
[00:31:44] And so, that was interesting.
[00:31:46] And I think look, the journal reported today
[00:31:49] that it, which we've heard as well,
[00:31:52] that there were some like management tensions
[00:31:55] over his management style.
[00:31:57] Now, again, we haven't reported anything
[00:32:00] because we don't feel like we have anything to report
[00:32:03] because that's a very kind of vague thing
[00:32:06] and the journal decided to run it.
[00:32:08] But people ask me all the time, as an operator
[00:32:12] and a journalist and you have that view of what journalists
[00:32:14] get right or wrong about business,
[00:32:16] what do they get right or wrong about business?
[00:32:19] And every time I'm asked this question,
[00:32:20] the answer's clear.
[00:32:22] I think journalists get personnel related matters
[00:32:26] pretty wrong most of the time.
[00:32:29] And I think it's because at the end of the day,
[00:32:32] these decisions and dynamics are like two people in a room.
[00:32:37] And even the closest people right outside that room
[00:32:41] could have their theories about what's happening.
[00:32:44] But, you know, if someone, sometimes in those rooms
[00:32:48] and personnel matters, you know, the truth is,
[00:32:52] is basically never reflected, honestly.
[00:32:55] And I think that's largely because things are complicated
[00:32:59] and multi-dimensional and it comes down to
[00:33:02] a bunch of like internal and external factors.
[00:33:04] So I always tread cautiously on these topics,
[00:33:08] both as a reporter in general
[00:33:10] because I've just seen, and I've seen so many people
[00:33:14] whose reputations in Silicon Valley and they'll leave a company
[00:33:19] and the press will report it as meeting something
[00:33:22] for this company and you know that person
[00:33:24] has not done a single thing of consequence
[00:33:26] at that company for 12 years, but no one really knows that.
[00:33:30] And so actually, it's a blessing that this person
[00:33:34] has moved on because now the organization
[00:33:36] can function properly, but the public narrative
[00:33:40] often picked up by the media because, you know,
[00:33:43] there are like two people, the person in their boss
[00:33:45] know what went down is wrong.
[00:33:48] So anyway, that's what it brought up for me.
[00:33:51] I think there's also a dynamic where reporters don't
[00:33:54] manage anyone as they've no idea what it looks like, right?
[00:33:58] And like the irony is, a sort of venture capital
[00:34:00] is generally not managing anyone, so they're terrible management.
[00:34:02] Like venture capital is they're awful managers
[00:34:04] by in general unless like they were 20 year operators
[00:34:08] and they kind of like opted out of it anyway.
[00:34:09] And like journalists don't know anything about management
[00:34:11] because like they never manage anyone.
[00:34:13] So like in the ability to like understand
[00:34:15] what's going on is I think quite limited usually.
[00:34:17] And I would argue that venture firms are also in law firms.
[00:34:21] There's, you know, these structures are relational structures,
[00:34:24] right, where you've got a group relationship
[00:34:28] that has a particular dynamic.
[00:34:30] And I think you're very thoughtful
[00:34:33] in how you're pointing this out, Jess,
[00:34:34] that like the dynamic usually can't, you can't describe it.
[00:34:37] You can't write it down in words.
[00:34:39] If the dynamics not working, you know,
[00:34:43] you've got to figure out how to make it work.
[00:34:44] It's sort of like when you watch the Warriors
[00:34:47] and there's certain players when they're on the court
[00:34:52] make the team worse.
[00:34:53] And there's certain players that when they're on the court
[00:34:56] make the team better, even if they're not the ones scoring
[00:34:58] all the points or doing all the assists, right?
[00:35:00] And there's actually a metric for this in basketball.
[00:35:05] And describing that is very difficult.
[00:35:08] And I think most media don't actually take the time
[00:35:11] to go try to figure out like, oh, you know,
[00:35:14] this is normal stuff.
[00:35:15] Humans sometimes get into relational places with each other
[00:35:20] that don't work out and it's actually good
[00:35:21] if everyone, you know, figures out how to move on, right?
[00:35:25] It's better for everybody.
[00:35:27] And the story usually gets written as some, you know,
[00:35:31] villain versus hero story or something like that
[00:35:34] that has nothing to do with the actual dynamic.
[00:35:37] I get it all.
[00:35:38] I just think on the personal level,
[00:35:39] I'd be like, if you put me in charge
[00:35:40] of running Sequoia randomly,
[00:35:43] I would last about two seconds for lack of interest.
[00:35:46] And so I like it this and I'm like,
[00:35:48] roll off as a good example.
[00:35:50] I was like, if I were in roll off,
[00:35:51] she's like, I did my three years.
[00:35:53] I wanted to look over where I wanted to win.
[00:35:54] I guess and caught the bone and like,
[00:35:57] well, I don't need this in my life.
[00:35:58] Yeah, no one's calling you for that job, Sam.
[00:36:00] So we're good.
[00:36:01] We're good, but.
[00:36:03] You know, you'd be surprised if you go back
[00:36:06] a bunch of years and history with jobs
[00:36:07] I didn't get called for, but yes, I hear you.
[00:36:09] Fair enough, fair enough.
[00:36:11] Okay, what else you guys paying attention to this week?
[00:36:13] The gift guides are coming out,
[00:36:15] which I have some thoughts on these tech gift guides are
[00:36:18] very much because I'm in the middle
[00:36:20] of thinking of my contributions to ours.
[00:36:22] But what else in the world event your capital?
[00:36:25] Startups, crypto, crypto, Sam,
[00:36:27] you've been sending me screenshots of asset prices all week.
[00:36:30] What's going on?
[00:36:31] Give us the update.
[00:36:33] Oh, I just find it hilarious that,
[00:36:34] Jellie, Jellie, a tale of two cities.
[00:36:39] I like it back for a full year yesterday.
[00:36:40] Everything is down, except for Jellie, Jellie,
[00:36:44] we're just sitting at a $400 million market.
[00:36:47] Now why this is?
[00:36:48] Okay, for those people who just joined the podcast
[00:36:52] in the last few episodes, you need a primer
[00:36:55] of these two knuckleheads and Jellie, Jellie.
[00:36:57] Okay, whoever wants to talk about it.
[00:36:59] Hey, look, this is not a knucklehead thing.
[00:37:01] This is a serious thing.
[00:37:02] It started meme coins are interesting.
[00:37:05] There are great ways to build community.
[00:37:08] There is an app called Jellie, started by Ikram,
[00:37:11] who is one of the two co-founders of Venmo.
[00:37:13] I am its largest investor.
[00:37:15] I think, you know, certainly,
[00:37:16] I think I'm the only one in social event.
[00:37:17] I'm certainly the largest investor.
[00:37:19] And in talking with him after a conversation
[00:37:21] with Dave and you on the podcast,
[00:37:24] we decided it was a good idea
[00:37:26] to wrap a meme coin around it,
[00:37:29] which I launched and the application has adopted
[00:37:33] and is driving and the app is cool.
[00:37:34] It's got a lot going on.
[00:37:36] But it literally is traded very heavily
[00:37:39] and it's gone far beyond any expectation.
[00:37:43] Well, it's kind of like a wild thing about crypto.
[00:37:45] It's like, again, I mean, I haven't bought or sold,
[00:37:47] I haven't sold any.
[00:37:49] I actually did buy some early,
[00:37:51] but I haven't sold ever any of it.
[00:37:53] Certainly not for the Genesis wallet.
[00:37:55] But yeah, this thing, like basically initially ripped
[00:37:58] and then came down a bit and it's built a bunch of energy.
[00:38:01] And I was just wild to watch.
[00:38:03] So last week, I could go to a $400 million market cap.
[00:38:06] Well, to Egram's, to his credit,
[00:38:09] you know, like the coin launch happened on like a version,
[00:38:13] like we were like doing a conversation
[00:38:16] after the podcast on Jelly.
[00:38:18] Right.
[00:38:19] And that's how this all started.
[00:38:20] Yeah, I screen shot it made a meme coin.
[00:38:23] Our faces are literally the cover of the meme coin.
[00:38:26] I literally screen shot a window on my computer
[00:38:30] with our faces talking about it
[00:38:31] and posted it as a meme coin.
[00:38:33] And that is how it started.
[00:38:34] But he's done a great job picking up and running with it.
[00:38:36] I mean, he's now integrated it.
[00:38:38] Yeah, I mean, that's the thing that I was going to say
[00:38:40] is that he's actually really organically.
[00:38:44] I think it's a cool story of entrepreneurship
[00:38:46] and actually how building good products actually works.
[00:38:50] You know, there's this, we've talked about this narrative
[00:38:52] before that like, I don't know, you go to some,
[00:38:55] you know, incubator in the city
[00:38:57] and they tell you to focus on one metric
[00:38:59] and just like really accelerate towards that metric
[00:39:03] to get to demo day in six weeks or whatever.
[00:39:06] And then like 70, 80% of the startups that do that just fail.
[00:39:10] Meanwhile, you have people like,
[00:39:13] Echromin out there that really kind of like get in there
[00:39:16] with the community, try this new technology,
[00:39:20] bumble around, try to figure out how it's going to work
[00:39:23] and how it's going to fit.
[00:39:24] And then a year later, they're in this really organic
[00:39:27] and kind of beautiful place with their community
[00:39:29] and their product that actually is starting to work.
[00:39:32] Like that's actually,
[00:39:34] well, but is that why the meme coin is that, right?
[00:39:36] So and for those uninitiated jelly jelly, the app,
[00:39:41] where is it one jelly or two jelly is the app?
[00:39:43] Jelly, one jelly is the app.
[00:39:45] Jelly my jelly is the coin, one jelly.
[00:39:48] It's kind of cool.
[00:39:49] It's like you record video,
[00:39:52] but it is both a selfie and an outbound camera
[00:39:56] in the same screen.
[00:39:57] So you see kind of on top of each other,
[00:40:00] what the camera's seeing as well as what the film are seeing.
[00:40:04] How would you describe it, Sam?
[00:40:05] I mean, the important,
[00:40:06] what Echro's working on it has been for a while
[00:40:08] is this idea of like effectively filter lists,
[00:40:11] like authentic social media and like the revival
[00:40:14] that's going to happen around that as the world gets like.
[00:40:16] So if you think about like Sora is like the AI direction
[00:40:19] where everything is like disassociated in humans and polished,
[00:40:22] jelly is like the authentic real version of this.
[00:40:25] And it's a front, it's raw.
[00:40:26] It's front cam, back cam, real conversations,
[00:40:29] real people not edited,
[00:40:31] you know, kind of record video on the fly.
[00:40:34] There's these incredible integrations they built around,
[00:40:37] you know, again, this is the founder of Venmo or the two.
[00:40:39] So it's like unsurprising around tipping people
[00:40:42] and unlocking and unlocking videos
[00:40:44] based on sending jelly coins.
[00:40:46] It's the whole economy that's being,
[00:40:48] that he's building around it.
[00:40:49] But fundamentally it's like,
[00:40:50] I think that's a bet he's been working on for a while now
[00:40:53] and iterating with the community on is just like,
[00:40:56] we're all kind of sick of the over polished AI shit.
[00:40:59] Like we kind of just want real humans and real stories.
[00:41:01] And so with Gordon that looked like it was the form factor
[00:41:04] recording that and sharing that.
[00:41:05] So I'm pretty amped about what he's doing.
[00:41:07] But today's point, you know, we started the theme,
[00:41:10] you know, there's a strong tie to like,
[00:41:12] how do you use a currency well in the app to unlock things
[00:41:16] and share things and kind of tip things
[00:41:18] and all that type of stuff.
[00:41:19] And it's going well now, why is the coin itself
[00:41:22] up so much this week versus two weeks ago?
[00:41:25] Look, there's a bunch of people trading it.
[00:41:26] Like I don't, like I think that there's this drumbeat
[00:41:28] of people believing in it and the community.
[00:41:30] But there's often just like, I mean, it's not me,
[00:41:32] but there's a bunch of people who just trade it, right?
[00:41:34] And so I think they just traded it too
[00:41:36] as the cryptic community says in the moon right now.
[00:41:38] But like there's a fundamental drumbeat
[00:41:40] of really interesting stuff going on.
[00:41:41] So yeah, but say I'm the question is,
[00:41:43] would that have happened?
[00:41:45] Would there have been sustained energy
[00:41:47] if there wasn't a really talented product-oriented
[00:41:50] entrepreneur building an app continually
[00:41:53] on top of this ecosystem?
[00:41:54] No, of course not, right?
[00:41:56] And I think what's actually even interesting
[00:41:57] is there's now what the wobbles, what's the,
[00:42:00] someone started, wobbles is like an offshoot
[00:42:03] where someone created some sort of like coin based on
[00:42:06] like the mascot for jelly that's getting energy
[00:42:08] and like I'm sure we'll end up somehow integrated who knows.
[00:42:11] But like, I just think today's point,
[00:42:13] there is this interesting like what is community-driven
[00:42:16] development looked like of these concepts and apps
[00:42:18] and building energy around them.
[00:42:20] And I think crypto can be a really important part of that.
[00:42:22] And you just can't do it in six weeks, right?
[00:42:25] Like it's just not possible.
[00:42:26] No, no.
[00:42:27] Right, but if you're a long-term believer,
[00:42:29] I mean, if someone anyone who bought billier earlier,
[00:42:31] the long-term believers, you know, on inferior
[00:42:34] the liquid thing that can solve a lot of money right now,
[00:42:36] I just think it's like get this separate out,
[00:42:38] the drumbeat development, which is the core engine.
[00:42:41] From the fact that there are obviously a lot of people
[00:42:43] just like trading on top of that, right?
[00:42:45] Which is why number go up so much this week
[00:42:47] versus last week or whatever.
[00:42:49] But it is just kind of wild numbers.
[00:42:51] I mean, the thing that kind of blows my mind is,
[00:42:54] you know, jelly, even now, I mean,
[00:42:57] obviously it's very volatile,
[00:42:58] but like even now is a several hundred million dollar
[00:43:00] market cap on this thing that's like a tattoo
[00:43:02] and it kind of, which is way bigger than some like,
[00:43:06] actually quite hard technical legitimate crypto projects
[00:43:09] that I've involved in, like in terms of like,
[00:43:12] literally like like, like, and I'm like,
[00:43:13] kind of like, I was just gonna check how big
[00:43:15] Zalaios market cap.
[00:43:17] Yeah, I always think I named that one,
[00:43:18] but yeah, jelly jelly is bigger.
[00:43:21] Is it really?
[00:43:22] Yeah.
[00:43:23] And like, that's hard tech with like hundreds of millions
[00:43:27] of dollars from people like Softbank, you know, like,
[00:43:29] anyway.
[00:43:30] I love when I asked Sam why these things are happening
[00:43:32] and he looks at me and goes belief.
[00:43:35] I mean, yeah, I mean, it is an interesting time
[00:43:37] in crypto right now.
[00:43:39] The, I don't know Sam, what's your take on what's happening?
[00:43:43] I mean, look, I was a seed investor in Ripple,
[00:43:46] which I think I just saw some report
[00:43:47] raised it a 40 billion dollar valuation.
[00:43:50] I think there's like a main line crypto payment rails,
[00:43:52] which would kind of just become like,
[00:43:54] they're gonna happen.
[00:43:55] They are happening.
[00:43:57] The technology makes sense.
[00:43:58] These things have real market caps.
[00:44:01] You know, there was real, I think,
[00:44:02] political uncertainty, you know, before,
[00:44:05] but there's a lot enough certainty now
[00:44:06] that people are just marching ahead
[00:44:07] and doing good infrastructure work.
[00:44:09] I think what's less clear is like the application side.
[00:44:13] Now, I also think the nice part of crypto
[00:44:15] is like, there's always opportunity
[00:44:16] for something amazing to happen and something new to come out.
[00:44:19] So I don't know, I'm like,
[00:44:20] I'm always looking at crypto opportunities.
[00:44:23] I have avoided slash non-invested in many.
[00:44:26] There's like kind of the obviously gonna happen stuff
[00:44:29] around payments.
[00:44:30] There's stuff like the prediction markets
[00:44:31] that are super interesting and like seem pretty real.
[00:44:36] And then, you know, there's always the opportunity
[00:44:38] for a new amazing thing to come around
[00:44:41] or, you know, consumer apps, but they're not there yet.
[00:44:43] Believe.
[00:44:44] Who will be out in what?
[00:44:46] Yeah.
[00:44:47] It's not knocking it.
[00:44:48] It's, yeah, it's not, I mean, it's also,
[00:44:50] you could say the thing, why did Apple go up today?
[00:44:53] Right?
[00:44:54] I mean, so it's not like, like I get it,
[00:44:56] markets are psychological.
[00:44:58] Yeah, the difference is the difference
[00:44:59] that Apple isn't got by 300% in a day.
[00:45:02] Like, belief doesn't swing that wildly.
[00:45:05] So, even though it's interesting about crypto,
[00:45:06] is that belief can swing more wildly than,
[00:45:09] especially then kind of major equities
[00:45:12] with like deep liquidity and like buyers
[00:45:14] who are institutional and always gonna hit the bid
[00:45:16] at XYZ price, et cetera.
[00:45:18] I do think though there's this thing
[00:45:20] that happened a couple of weeks ago,
[00:45:22] this, I think it was hyper liquid.
[00:45:25] There's a lot of perp contracts out there
[00:45:28] and people using leverage in crypto at levels
[00:45:31] that was not typically the case.
[00:45:33] Well, you know where we've heard this before.
[00:45:36] This was what FTX did.
[00:45:37] I mean, what's it called?
[00:45:38] It's called, it has the same name as what FTX did,
[00:45:41] like forward something, something or other.
[00:45:43] They're called perps.
[00:45:44] Perps.
[00:45:45] Perps are really cool.
[00:45:47] Perps.
[00:45:47] But that was the FTX thing, wasn't it?
[00:45:51] I don't know.
[00:45:52] Yeah, I'm not sure, Jess.
[00:45:54] This is like perpetual futures.
[00:45:56] Is that what we're talking about or no?
[00:45:58] The absolutely, yeah, perpetual futures.
[00:46:00] Like, and like basically just a lot of it
[00:46:02] have up to 100 X leverage on things.
[00:46:04] And Dave is right.
[00:46:05] Like when you see big on lines in crypto,
[00:46:07] it's usually because people just get blown up
[00:46:09] on the shorts or long positions.
[00:46:11] If the shorts get blown up, the thing rips,
[00:46:13] if the long gets blown up, they crush, they get crushed.
[00:46:15] And there's a lot of leverage in the system.
[00:46:18] And then there's like a leverage level at any point you look at,
[00:46:20] which is like, okay, how leverage are people on their bets?
[00:46:23] And if people are super levered,
[00:46:25] then they can go way up or way down super quickly, right?
[00:46:28] It's not that there's the only difference with the normal,
[00:46:30] yeah, the difference in the normal side
[00:46:31] was just there can in theory be way more leveraging crypto
[00:46:35] from way less sophisticated people in theory, right?
[00:46:38] Because there isn't the same guard reals in places
[00:46:40] there is in the traditional market.
[00:46:42] Yeah, I think that that's the thing.
[00:46:44] Like a lot of people are asking like, what's happening?
[00:46:46] Why is this swing seems bigger?
[00:46:48] And Sam's point about belief.
[00:46:50] I think actually this thing moved so quickly.
[00:46:53] And the only reason that that would happen
[00:46:55] is because of the amount of leverage that's in the system.
[00:46:59] So I think a lot of people are actually questioning
[00:47:02] their belief right now in the system.
[00:47:04] And so you're not, you're sort of seeing
[00:47:06] some weird behavior the last few weeks because of this.
[00:47:10] Hyper liquid and these perfect exchanges are pretty new.
[00:47:13] Like they're less than a year old.
[00:47:15] I mean, there's also I think you've found
[00:47:17] a Bitcoin is just quite different than everything else.
[00:47:20] Like, it's not that there won't be swings in Bitcoin.
[00:47:23] There will be swings in Bitcoin.
[00:47:24] There is a ton, there can be a ton of leverage in Bitcoin, right?
[00:47:27] But like, I don't know, I think there's a lot of buyers
[00:47:30] at Bitcoin, not 100K.
[00:47:31] There's a pretty duct deep market there
[00:47:33] and I don't think it's versus other things
[00:47:35] are going to think like are much more volatile.
[00:47:38] And there's like much much like thinner markets too.
[00:47:41] Well, I've got we had this meme coin corner.
[00:47:44] And we'll we'll we'll you guys will keep us posted.
[00:47:46] Absolutely guys, I do.
[00:47:49] Oh, we're losing Sam is not in the waymo.
[00:47:53] By the way, has anyone seen the waymo's on alchemy?
[00:47:56] No, I'm sorry.
[00:47:57] I know I've treated about this waymo reporter here.
[00:48:02] So, you know, they opened, they're opening up more of the
[00:48:05] what I used to call the South Bay,
[00:48:07] but I now know is referred to as the mid peninsula
[00:48:11] to waymo.
[00:48:12] And so this is where all the tech people,
[00:48:14] not all the tech people, but it's flooded with Googlers
[00:48:17] and tech people and all these people who want to use waymo.
[00:48:20] And it was only been using it in the city.
[00:48:23] And like last weekend, I was just driving on alchemy note
[00:48:26] and I was like, it was like swarms of them.
[00:48:29] And just how rapidly they've taken over alchemy note is,
[00:48:35] I mean, it's not surprising to me because it's like
[00:48:37] the right market for it and obviously been penetrated
[00:48:40] in the Bay Area already, but it was kind of cool.
[00:48:43] And now, though they out now for those of you who don't live
[00:48:46] in our fine geography,
[00:48:48] Alchemy note sort of parallelish to 101
[00:48:51] where the waymo's can't go and is obviously faster
[00:48:54] because it is a highway.
[00:48:56] But now I'm like, maybe it'll take Alchemy note down to Redwood City
[00:49:00] because like we get in the waymo.
[00:49:02] So anyway, Dave, they'll come to you.
[00:49:04] My boys, I don't know.
[00:49:06] It's never going to happen.
[00:49:07] The boys love my boys love waymo's.
[00:49:09] They've never been in them, but they feel like they're
[00:49:12] in the future.
[00:49:13] Everybody in the city only allows their children to use waymo.
[00:49:17] Well, I don't, and my kids don't move around the city much.
[00:49:20] It's not, I'm not, I'm not holding them back.
[00:49:23] It's also like my little sister's three.
[00:49:25] He like needs a car seat restraint, but they just,
[00:49:29] they're so today one was crying and I was like,
[00:49:32] oh, let's see if we see a waymo on the way to school.
[00:49:34] You never know when he just like shut up.
[00:49:37] But anyway, I, this is my prediction that, oh, Camino is going
[00:49:41] to be an important thoroughfare relative to the 101
[00:49:45] because the people are going to want their waymo's.
[00:49:48] What do you think, Sam?
[00:49:50] I'm doing something.
[00:49:51] Yes, Dave, for a minute, and it'll be right back.
[00:49:53] So I think very exciting.
[00:49:54] Dave, you know, I'm glad that we can be the responsible ones
[00:49:58] who can sit our butt in the seat for at least 45 minutes.
[00:50:05] And I know I miss if you and again,
[00:50:06] my big event last week.
[00:50:08] So I'm sorry I wasn't here, but it's still,
[00:50:11] but I do know actually what Sam is preparing
[00:50:13] because he must have arrived home to see his delivery corner
[00:50:17] of stuff.
[00:50:18] I did see my delivery corner.
[00:50:20] I'm very excited about it.
[00:50:21] I, I knew you would be excited when you saw.
[00:50:25] Oh my goodness.
[00:50:27] Oh my goodness.
[00:50:28] Dave, Dave, are you ready?
[00:50:30] Are you ready?
[00:50:32] He's not wearing the suit anymore.
[00:50:33] It's very special.
[00:50:34] Look what I've made.
[00:50:36] Oh, that's amazing.
[00:50:37] Okay, everybody, Sam is wearing a t-shirt.
[00:50:39] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:41] This is my greatest achievement of the year.
[00:50:44] It's my note, teens and queens of Jackson Hall.
[00:50:47] For you, Jackson Hall.
[00:50:49] Rejects and Hall.
[00:50:51] For those who don't know.
[00:50:54] That's so good.
[00:50:55] Take the microphone, Sam.
[00:50:56] Just, just take it.
[00:50:57] Yes.
[00:50:57] Dave, for those who don't know, I'm very proud of this.
[00:51:01] This is my greatest achievement of the year.
[00:51:03] Is you may or may not be what it's called
[00:51:05] is no Kings and Queens protests.
[00:51:07] And I'm like, I want to be a note, Kings and Queens person,
[00:51:11] but like, what do I not want Kings and Queens of?
[00:51:14] And what you may or may not know is in Jackson Hall,
[00:51:16] there's an annual contest called the Kings and Queens
[00:51:19] of Corvettes.
[00:51:20] And the problem with Kings and Queens, it's a big problem.
[00:51:23] It is very cool.
[00:51:24] People show up at the awesome.
[00:51:25] Here's the problem.
[00:51:26] They shut down Corvettes for like a month
[00:51:29] to get, like, let it snow in.
[00:51:31] But for Venice, you're from skiing it.
[00:51:32] Because they're trying to like make it perfect for people.
[00:51:35] But the Kings and Queens of Corvettes
[00:51:36] means I can't ski Corvettes for like half the season.
[00:51:41] So I am here on the podcast to announce my new campaign,
[00:51:46] no Kings and Queens of Corvettes, which we have no Kings and
[00:51:49] Colts, no Kings and Queens, free Jackson Hall.
[00:51:54] This will be a thing that I'd like to stand behind, Dave.
[00:51:58] I'd like your support.
[00:52:00] And we are going to blow this up.
[00:52:03] And we're going to liberate Corvettes,
[00:52:06] no Kings and Queens of Jackson Hall.
[00:52:08] It's so good.
[00:52:11] I'm going to need hats.
[00:52:12] I need a hat.
[00:52:13] I'm thinking stickers and the hats.
[00:52:14] I think we give it out to all the kids on their first day of
[00:52:17] ski school.
[00:52:18] You know, like we're just going to like,
[00:52:19] absolutely helmet stickers, the whole thing.
[00:52:22] Helmet stickers.
[00:52:23] It's going to be, this is my campaign of the year.
[00:52:26] And it's just like spring like money and commerce and fame
[00:52:29] and branding to the resort that needs all of those things.
[00:52:33] It doesn't need any more.
[00:52:34] We already, there are already too many people on the slopes of Jackson
[00:52:37] Hall says the happy season past holders.
[00:52:40] Yes.
[00:52:41] But, but no, I think the thing, this goes back to the point about your
[00:52:44] no Queens protests.
[00:52:46] I love the people.
[00:52:47] Dave.
[00:52:47] I don't like my friends getting hit by out of control skiers on
[00:52:50] slopes that are overcrowded, Jess.
[00:52:52] That's true.
[00:52:53] I'm all for that.
[00:52:54] All for that.
[00:52:55] I'm just more every good protest needs a counter protest.
[00:53:00] So like you're getting a no Queens protests for WTF.
[00:53:03] Jackson is getting a no Kings and Queens protests for Kings and
[00:53:07] Queens.
[00:53:08] And it's good for everyone.
[00:53:09] I actually got unfortunately, it's, it's going to revitalize
[00:53:12] Kings and Queens.
[00:53:13] It's going to be, you need, it's only a thing.
[00:53:16] If there's a counter thing.
[00:53:17] So I'm here to provide the counter saying, it's a lovely t-shirt.
[00:53:21] I got to, I got to give you some props.
[00:53:23] I mean, you've designed some, a range of t-shirts over the years.
[00:53:26] But what I like about this one, I like the color.
[00:53:29] It looks soft.
[00:53:30] It looks like a chat GPT font.
[00:53:32] Is that a chat GPT font?
[00:53:34] Dave, I did this at dinner in Mexico City with chat GPT and
[00:53:38] cost of me in like 45 minutes.
[00:53:41] I literally was at dinner.
[00:53:43] Sam, it's slop.
[00:53:44] You made AI slop.
[00:53:46] It's OK to make slop for protests.
[00:53:48] If you look at the skier because of chat GPT, one of his legs,
[00:53:51] one of his legs is Nessie.
[00:53:53] Yeah, I was wondering about that actually.
[00:53:55] But I was with a good friend Aaron Sitzie.
[00:53:57] We were in Mexico City, like literally on Thursday having dinner.
[00:54:00] I was like, I need to make this shirt.
[00:54:01] I was with Dan Corn, our amounting guy.
[00:54:03] I love who we were climbing with.
[00:54:06] And I was like, I'm making it right now.
[00:54:08] I went to custom-made, rushed delivery.
[00:54:10] You get it three days later.
[00:54:11] But the funniest thing is Aaron saw the logo.
[00:54:14] And he said, that's pretty good.
[00:54:15] He's like, send us me how clean it up.
[00:54:16] And like, you can make it.
[00:54:17] I was like, no, you don't need to clean it up.
[00:54:19] I'm just making it.
[00:54:20] Oh my god.
[00:54:21] Aaron in like three hours would have made that like 10 times better.
[00:54:26] Maybe, but I think it's an aesthetic.
[00:54:28] I think like direct from Chatchy PT is like an aesthetic.
[00:54:32] And like, that's the aesthetic.
[00:54:33] Yeah.
[00:54:34] You just need to put Chatchy PT like on the back,
[00:54:36] like right above below the collar.
[00:54:38] Like, this has been a Chatchy PT production.
[00:54:41] It's kind of like when you look at 90s albums,
[00:54:44] they all look like 90s grunge.
[00:54:46] Like, that's what the 2020s is going to look like in the future.
[00:54:49] It's going to look like Chatchy PT made it.
[00:54:51] And it did.
[00:54:51] And part of Chatchy PT making it,
[00:54:53] is that one of the skiers has no legs.
[00:54:55] But that's the aesthetic.
[00:54:56] I feel like my typos are part of this too,
[00:54:59] because if I wrote something in Chatchy PT,
[00:55:01] there would not be any typos,
[00:55:02] but I just typed fast and send it in their typos.
[00:55:05] So I feel like that's the same thing.
[00:55:07] I mean, you know, I believe in that.
[00:55:08] I actually hilariously, I had a former copy editor
[00:55:11] to the Wall Street Journal last week.
[00:55:12] I sent my newsletter, which I always send on Fridays.
[00:55:15] Oh, they must have vomited.
[00:55:17] No, it's like, I love the newsletter.
[00:55:19] I can't help myself.
[00:55:20] Like, it's ARC for ARIC, not ARK.
[00:55:22] And I'm like, that's a really good point.
[00:55:23] You're 100% right?
[00:55:24] That's just bad spelling.
[00:55:26] That's not even copy.
[00:55:27] I'm saying like, it's your point.
[00:55:28] It's proof of humanity.
[00:55:29] It's proof of humanity.
[00:55:31] You know, that's what we do now.
[00:55:32] Proof of life, I didn't use an M-.
[00:55:35] Okay, friends, this is a great T-shirt.
[00:55:37] Sam, can the listeners of this pod get their hands on
[00:55:41] any of these T-shirts?
[00:55:42] So email me if you want one for now.
[00:55:43] I think we're going to put up a merch store.
[00:55:45] I do think we need helmets stickers.
[00:55:47] I do think we need lots of other versions of this.
[00:55:49] I have a, I'm actually sending a whole batch
[00:55:51] to Jackson Hole, because several professional skiers
[00:55:54] want copies.
[00:55:55] So we're gonna, but this is a thing.
[00:55:56] This is our winter lulls the activity date.
[00:55:59] It's gonna be blowing up no Kings and Wains.
[00:56:01] You and I love it.
[00:56:02] I'm in.
[00:56:03] All right.
[00:56:04] Okay.
[00:56:04] Well, with that, friends, it's been a joy.
[00:56:06] It's been a pleasure to our listeners.
[00:56:09] If you came this far, you really love us,
[00:56:11] which means we love you too.
[00:56:13] And we will be happily all back together next week
[00:56:17] for another more or less.
