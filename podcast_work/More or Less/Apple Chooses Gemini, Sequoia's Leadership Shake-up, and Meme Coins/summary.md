# [Podcast Summary: More or Less - Tech, Etiquette, and Venture Capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYg7fqfmIHI)

## 1. Key Themes

### The Death of "Tech Bro" Culture and Rise of Etiquette in Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley's approach to business is fundamentally changing from aggressive disruption to respectful integration. Sam Altman hosted an etiquette school for 50 founders, emphasizing professionalism and cultural adaptation.

"The era of the young technologist with ripped jeans and a t-shirt that doesn't understand and disobeys all the rules of a local community. Because you're still important even though you're an asshole. I think it's just over. People are now scared of Silicon Valley. It's not some small side show." [[00:00:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=0s)

"I think the story you need to show up now is like, I can bring a lot. I can give more than I get. I have the technology. You can trust me to back it up. But I also have respect for existing in your space." [[00:01:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=1m7s)

The emphasis on "giving more than you get" and "showing up with a low heart rate" represents a fundamental shift in how founders are being trained to approach stakeholders, whether investors, employees, or regulators.

### Apple's Strategic Choice: Edge Computing Over Cloud Infrastructure
Apple is making deliberate decisions to partner with Google (Gemini) for AI capabilities rather than compete directly in expensive foundation model development, focusing instead on on-device AI and edge computing.

"Getting into the foundation model game is extremely capital intensive. They've shown only an appetite to invest something like 10 maybe 20% of their operating cash flow in AI infrastructure. They're not willing to spend 70 80% like Meta or Amazon or Microsoft." [[00:18:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=18m33s)

Dave predicts: "If I'm Apple, like I'm focused entirely on the edge and I let everybody else play this high capex foundation game." [[00:19:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=19m35s)

This reflects a long-term strategic chess move similar to Apple's original Google search deal, allowing them to focus resources on hardware and device-level innovation while outsourcing expensive cloud AI infrastructure.

### The Impossible Task of Reporting on Personnel Decisions
There's a fundamental information asymmetry in understanding leadership changes, with Sequoia's rapid leadership transition from Roelof Botha serving as the case study.

"I think journalists get personnel related matters pretty wrong most of the time. And I think it's because at the end of the day, these decisions and dynamics are like two people in a room. And even the closest people right outside that room could have their theories about what's happening." [[00:32:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=32m12s)

Jess emphasizes: "I've seen so many people whose reputations in Silicon Valley and they'll leave a company and the press will report it as meaning something for this company and you know that person has not done a single thing of consequence at that company for 12 years, but no one really knows that." [[00:33:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=33m16s)

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### The "Product-Market Fit" Mantra is Antiquated
Sam challenges the Y Combinator orthodoxy that product-market fit is all you need, arguing that modern startups require deeper stakeholder relationships and trust-building.

"The YC story of all you need is product-market fit and move on. I think it's just like a very antiquated story." [[00:07:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=7m47s)

This directly contradicts the lean startup methodology that has dominated Silicon Valley thinking for over a decade, suggesting a return to relationship-driven business building.

### Meme Coins as Legitimate Community Building Tools
Rather than dismissing meme coins as speculation, Sam argues they can be effective mechanisms for authentic community development, pointing to his Jelly Jelly coin reaching $400M market cap.

"Meme coins are interesting. There are great ways to build community." [[00:37:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=36m55s)

Dave adds context: "You have people like Ickram out there that really kind of like get in there with the community, try this new technology, bumble around, try to figure out how it's going to work and how it's going to fit. And then a year later, they're in this really organic and kind of beautiful place with their community and their product that actually is starting to work." [[00:39:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=39m10s)

This contradicts the mainstream view that meme coins are purely speculative instruments with no utility.

### Distributed Computing Through Consumer Devices Will Disrupt Cloud
Elon Musk's vision (via Tesla) that consumer devices will become the AI infrastructure represents a fundamental reimagining of computing economics.

Sam explains: "Elon Musk last week tweeted this thing... Tesla does not need to build some big AI infrastructure because the cars are the AI infrastructure. And when the car is not driving, we'll just run AI workloads on the cars... If you have an iPhone or a Tesla or there's a reason someone is going to pay for the computer for other things. And then you can just use it when it's not being used." [[00:40:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=40m25s)

This challenges the massive capex investments being made by cloud providers and suggests an alternative future where compute is distributed rather than centralized.

### Running Major Venture Firms is Undesirable
Sam suggests that being a "steward" of a major institution like Sequoia is actually an unappealing job, contrary to conventional wisdom.

"If you put me in charge of running Sequoia randomly, I would last about two seconds for lack of interest... The title is steward. That sounds like a terrible job. And second of all, like, who wants to run a big institution?" [[00:34:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=34m25s)

This perspective challenges the assumption that leading prestigious institutions is the pinnacle of career achievement.

## 3. Companies Identified

### Jelly (One Jelly)
Social media app founded by Ickram (Venmo co-founder) focused on authentic, unfiltered content using dual-camera recording (front and back simultaneously).

"What Ickram's working on has been for a while is this idea of effectively filter-less, authentic social media and the revival that's going to happen around that as the world gets disassociated from humans and polished. Jelly is the authentic real version... It's front cam, back cam, real conversations, real people not edited, you know, kind of record video on the fly." [[00:44:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=44m11s)

### Gemini (Google)
Google's AI assistant that has achieved strong integration with core Google services, now powering Apple's Siri.

Sam reports: "I was this week years old when I figured out that Gemini can read my email and add things to my calendar. Game changing." [[00:15:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=15m45s)

"I highly recommend connecting Gemini to your Gmail. Then asking it to analyze your email... I asked it analyze the emails I have not responded to over the last month and identify patterns and give me tips for better response." [[00:16:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=16m25s)

### Waymo
Autonomous vehicle service rapidly expanding in the Bay Area, particularly on El Camino Real.

Jess observes: "Last weekend, I was just driving on El Camino and it was like swarms of them. And just how rapidly they've taken over El Camino is... kind of cool." [[00:48:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=48m13s)

### Ripple
Crypto payment rails company that recently raised at $40B valuation.

"I was a seed investor in Ripple, which I think I just saw some report raised at a 40 billion dollar valuation. I think there's like a main line crypto payment rails, which are kind of just becoming like, they're gonna happen. They are happening. The technology makes sense." [[00:43:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=43m33s)

### Anthropic
AI company showing significant revenue growth, primarily driven by developer/coding use cases.

"Headline, surging, I mean, Anthropic surging. The businesses are using a lot of AI. Code. It's code, it's all code." [[00:17:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=17m4s)

### Cloudflare
Public company that Sam cites as an example of missed public market investment opportunity.

"10 years ago, I called some friends and I said I really want to buy a bunch of Cloudflare stock... It's a 10x over five years. But I didn't have the balls to put enough into it that it matters." [[00:15:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=15m3s)

### HyperLiquid
New crypto derivatives/perpetual futures exchange enabling high leverage trading.

"There's this thing that happened a couple of weeks ago, I think it was HyperLiquid. There's a lot of perp contracts out there and people using leverage in crypto at levels that was not typically the case." [[00:45:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=45m15s)

## 4. Operating Insights

### The "Low Heart Rate" Approach to High-Stakes Meetings
Instead of approaching important meetings with scarcity mindset and high anxiety, successful operators should cultivate abundance mentality.

"One is mentality of scarcity. This is your one chance to meet this important person or impress someone or do the right thing. Your heart rate is up. You're over pitching, your strategy, you're trying to, your pitch is too long. You're not occupying too much people's time versus a low heart rate. You say like, look, I deserve to be in this room. I'm not stressed about it. I was invited. I have something to add." [[00:05:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=4m52s)

### Company Culture Through Etiquette Rules
Etiquette isn't just for external relationships but can be a management tool for setting internal company culture.

"We learned a lot about practical, like how to approach sitting culture in your company and how to think about showing up in a room with a low heart rate and giving more than you get." [[00:03:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=3m34s)

### Iterative Community-Driven Product Development
Rather than optimizing for a single metric toward demo day, successful products emerge from longer-term community engagement and iteration.

"There's this narrative that you go to some incubator in the city and they tell you to focus on one metric and just accelerate towards that metric to get to demo day in six weeks... 70, 80% of the startups that do that just fail. Meanwhile, you have people like Ickram out there that really get in there with the community, try this new technology, bumble around, try to figure out how it's going to work... And then a year later, they're in this really organic and beautiful place with their community and their product that actually is starting to work." [[00:39:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=38m56s)

## 5. Overlooked Insights

### Board Meeting Productivity Has Collapsed Post-Zoom
Dave casually mentioned a significant operational reality that deserves more attention.

"I did a board meeting this morning. And the last board meeting for this company was in person. And it was shockingly less productive over Zoom." [[00:02:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=2m15s)

This brief comment suggests that despite three years of "Zoom optimization," fundamental governance and decision-making quality has degraded for remote board meetings. Given the importance of board meetings for company direction and the prevalence of hybrid/remote models, this represents a significant hidden tax on organizational effectiveness that few are openly discussing.

### Tesla as Distributed AI Infrastructure Provider
While discussed briefly, the implications of consumer devices becoming compute infrastructure are massive and underexplored.

"Tesla does not need to build some big AI infrastructure because the cars are the AI infrastructure. And when the car is not driving, we'll just run AI workloads on the cars." [[00:40:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4VdtKpQQk&t=40m25s)

This could completely reshape the economics of AI compute, potentially threatening the entire cloud computing business model. If successful, this would mean consumers subsidize AI infrastructure through device purchases, fundamentally changing who captures value in the AI stack. This deserves far more attention as a potential industry disruption.
