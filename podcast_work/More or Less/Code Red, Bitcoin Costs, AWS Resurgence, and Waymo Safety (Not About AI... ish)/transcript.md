[00:00:00] I kind of think there's a 50% chance
[00:00:02] Dave Morin: Sam Altman wrote that memo
[00:00:03] Dave Morin: so people would not know their actual strategy.
[00:00:06] Dave Morin: It's like, surprise, it's all ignorance and commerce.
[00:00:09] Sam Lessin: We tricked you.
[00:00:12] Sam Lessin: Comrade is actually only about commerce.
[00:00:15] Sam Lessin: Yeah.
[00:00:37] Why hello friends.
[00:00:38] Dave Morin: Welcome to more or less.
[00:00:41] Dave Morin: Jess, you look, you look bundled up.
[00:00:42] Sam Lessin: Are we saving money on heat?
[00:00:44] Sam Lessin: We're saving money on heat.
[00:00:44] Sam Lessin: I actually put my hat on, guys.
[00:00:46] Dave Morin: The price is Bitcoin is down.
[00:00:48] Sam Lessin: I said Bitcoin has fallen.
[00:00:50] Dave Morin: We can't afford it.
[00:00:51] Dave Morin: Bitcoin prices down and the lesson family has changed
[00:00:54] Sam Lessin: are home heating.
[00:00:55] Sam Lessin: But subs are up.
[00:00:56] Sam Lessin: Sobs are up.
[00:00:57] Dave Morin: We've code red on subs.
[00:00:59] Dave Morin: So no more code reds this week, please.
[00:01:02] Dave Morin: I'm done.
[00:01:03] Dave Morin: But it's a very, I'm just in the holiday spirit.
[00:01:06] Dave Morin: And I was like, found this nice red hat and scarf.
[00:01:10] Dave Morin: It's holiday party season.
[00:01:11] Dave Morin: But before we get into that, can I start with an ode to Daniel Laurie?
[00:01:15] Sam Lessin: Oh gosh.
[00:01:16] Sam Lessin: You may.
[00:01:17] Sam Lessin: You may.
[00:01:18] Sam Lessin: Sure.
[00:01:19] Sam Lessin: I just was on Instagram.
[00:01:20] Sam Lessin: I think Daniel Laurie has like the best.
[00:01:21] Sam Lessin: His social game is so good.
[00:01:23] Sam Lessin: It's so good.
[00:01:24] Sam Lessin: It's so good.
[00:01:25] Sam Lessin: I don't think anyone will ever be Jesse Tish's speech about rats in New York, which was
[00:01:31] Sam Lessin: one of my favorite social media speeches.
[00:01:32] Sam Lessin: New York police commissioner.
[00:01:34] Brit Morin: I don't know what this is.
[00:01:35] Brit Morin: The rats don't run New York.
[00:01:36] Sam Lessin: We do.
[00:01:38] Sam Lessin: It's really one of the great lines of social media politics.
[00:01:42] Sam Lessin: Wait, this was before she was police commissioner, right?
[00:01:44] Dave Morin: It was she was sanitation commissioner crushing the rats.
[00:01:47] Sam Lessin: She's like, you know, I rode freshman crew.
[00:01:51] Sam Lessin: She was like a cox and sometimes for us on the second lightweight boat of freshman
[00:01:55] Sam Lessin: crew and when then we need to.
[00:01:57] Sam Lessin: So she's great.
[00:01:58] Sam Lessin: But like, I just, that was amazing.
[00:02:00] Sam Lessin: But Daniel Laurie's social media.
[00:02:02] Sam Lessin: I mean, he I just popped open Instagram to a video of him.
[00:02:05] Sam Lessin: of San Francisco, if any of you don't know.
[00:02:08] Dave Morin: Thank you.
[00:02:09] Dave Morin: I was like, tell the people who don't live here, who he is.
[00:02:11] Dave Morin: In the new, I wish I could have approached him.
[00:02:12] Sam Lessin: We don't live in the city anymore, but he's live,
[00:02:14] Sam Lessin: he's live from the new drone command center,
[00:02:18] Sam Lessin: showing the drones and being like,
[00:02:21] Sam Lessin: you will not get away with crimes in San Francisco.
[00:02:23] Sam Lessin: And it's like, he's so sincere and he's in a suit.
[00:02:27] Sam Lessin: You know, it's like, and he's doing the thing.
[00:02:29] Sam Lessin: And I'm just like, I just think is,
[00:02:31] Sam Lessin: I honestly, there's a lot of experiments right now
[00:02:33] Sam Lessin: in post-Trumpian political social media.
[00:02:37] Sam Lessin: And I just want to plus one.
[00:02:38] Sam Lessin: First deal is doing a good job.
[00:02:39] Sam Lessin: And I love the drone center.
[00:02:41] Sam Lessin: But two, like the deadpan, we're solving no more crime.
[00:02:46] Sam Lessin: And here's the drone center.
[00:02:47] Sam Lessin: Just fabulous.
[00:02:48] Sam Lessin: Well, while we're going through our favorite
[00:02:50] Dave Morin: Daniel Lurie social media post,
[00:02:51] Dave Morin: our friend Monica Miserie turned me
[00:02:54] Dave Morin: onto his social media while he was running for mayor
[00:02:58] Dave Morin: because he's just so good.
[00:03:00] Dave Morin: Okay, he's played tenors with Roger Federer
[00:03:02] Dave Morin: on his social media.
[00:03:04] Dave Morin: He's talked about LaBoubos and the opening of Pop Mart.
[00:03:08] Dave Morin: Wait, what's it called?
[00:03:08] Dave Morin: A Pop Mart?
[00:03:09] Dave Morin: Yeah, Pop Mart.
[00:03:10] Dave Morin: Yeah, we went there this weekend.
[00:03:11] Dave Morin: And then he's, he also, my old Bart stop of like 16th admission.
[00:03:18] Dave Morin: He did this great video where he's like,
[00:03:20] Dave Morin: it's 3 p.m. on a Friday.
[00:03:22] Dave Morin: No drugs.
[00:03:24] Dave Morin: That's amazing.
[00:03:25] Brit Morin: It was so funny.
[00:03:27] Dave Morin: And he's like, we're going to come back on Saturday.
[00:03:30] Dave Morin: Better still not be any drugs.
[00:03:32] Dave Morin: And puts what's so great about it is also he's just big earnest.
[00:03:36] Dave Morin: Like this is his personality.
[00:03:38] Brit Morin: Guys, we've deployed 150 drones per month for like the last year.
[00:03:43] Brit Morin: That's like almost Ukraine levels.
[00:03:44] Sam Lessin: And they're not even being strong.
[00:03:46] Sam Lessin: They're mostly being deployed for car car breakage.
[00:03:49] Brit Morin: 800 car criminals.
[00:03:51] Brit Morin: 800 criminals.
[00:03:52] Sam Lessin: The coin Daniel Lurie.
[00:03:53] Sam Lessin: I mean, this is great.
[00:03:54] I love it.
[00:03:55] Dave Morin: Politics.
[00:03:57] Most separate Cisco mayor thing to say ever.
[00:03:59] Jessica Lessin: I know.
[00:04:00] Dave Morin: He's just so leaning in.
[00:04:01] Dave Morin: I wouldn't say we're close friends.
[00:04:03] Sam Lessin: We've known Daniel Lurie a long time.
[00:04:04] Sam Lessin: And when he was running for mayor, I will admit that I was skeptical.
[00:04:07] Sam Lessin: He would win.
[00:04:08] Sam Lessin: And I was skeptical how he would do his mayor.
[00:04:11] Sam Lessin: I'm so wrong.
[00:04:12] Sam Lessin: He's crushing it.
[00:04:12] Sam Lessin: And he's not just correcting social media.
[00:04:14] Sam Lessin: He like, I mean, I wasn't anti.
[00:04:16] Sam Lessin: I was excited for him.
[00:04:17] Sam Lessin: I just wasn't sure.
[00:04:18] Sam Lessin: And like, my goodness, I can't think of a better.
[00:04:21] Sam Lessin: And look, he's made some mistakes.
[00:04:22] Dave Morin: And he's owned them.
[00:04:23] Dave Morin: He's appointed some people who weren't great.
[00:04:26] Dave Morin: And he owned it.
[00:04:27] Dave Morin: And he fixed it.
[00:04:28] Dave Morin: And he came in.
[00:04:28] Dave Morin: And he appointed new people.
[00:04:30] Dave Morin: And it's just lovely.
[00:04:32] Dave Morin: And like, you just, you know, I love that he just like wears a suit.
[00:04:35] Sam Lessin: He just wears a suit, you know, like, and he just sincere.
[00:04:38] Sam Lessin: And he post things on Instagram.
[00:04:40] Sam Lessin: Like if you commit in crime and SF, you will be caught.
[00:04:45] Sam Lessin: I just like, you have to go back and find the no drugs.
[00:04:49] Dave Morin: That's okay.
[00:04:50] Dave Morin: No drugs.
[00:04:51] No drugs.
[00:04:52] Brit Morin: Okay.
[00:04:52] Brit Morin: Remember what we need to remind our listeners about today?
[00:04:55] Brit Morin: We're supposed to remind them at the end of the pod are producers.
[00:04:58] Brit Morin: Like we're, no, they said it at the beginning.
[00:05:00] Brit Morin: No, they specifically asked us to do it at the beginning.
[00:05:02] Dave Morin: I'm sorry.

[00:05:28] Sam Lessin: You should like and subscribe.
[00:05:30] Brit Morin: And we got some pod feedback this week from a random listener.
[00:05:33] Brit Morin: We talk about AI too much.
[00:05:35] Brit Morin: That was great.
[00:05:36] Brit Morin: So I went to this, I went to this event.
[00:05:38] Sam Lessin: I was invited to and the headline was there was Vinod because like, well, I actually really
[00:05:42] Sam Lessin: like Vinod.
[00:05:43] Sam Lessin: I think it says smart stuff.
[00:05:44] Sam Lessin: Friend of the pod, friend of the pod.
[00:05:45] Dave Morin: Friend of the pod.
[00:05:46] Sam Lessin: If you know what he's doing, the keynote and you know what I love about Vinod.
[00:05:50] Sam Lessin: Vinod is one of the most successful VCs.
[00:05:51] Sam Lessin: You know, he's been doing this for 40 years.
[00:05:54] Sam Lessin: He ends his speech.
[00:05:55] Sam Lessin: He literally gives everyone his email address on stage.
[00:05:57] Sam Lessin: Like if you want to email me, I respond to all the emails.
[00:06:00] Sam Lessin: And I'm like, wow, 40 years in.
[00:06:02] Sam Lessin: And then I looked it up.
[00:06:03] Sam Lessin: I was like, did you give them an alternate email or your actual email?
[00:06:06] Sam Lessin: I looked up at I have the same email.
[00:06:07] Sam Lessin: So either he gave me his shit email or he's actually responding to all these people.
[00:06:12] Sam Lessin: And so I was invited as like a the B act afterwards.
[00:06:16] Sam Lessin: And I sat down and this guy behind me is like, love the podcast.
[00:06:21] Sam Lessin: It's getting boring.
[00:06:22] Sam Lessin: And I was like, what do you mean it's getting?
[00:06:23] Sam Lessin: He's like, I listen to it.
[00:06:25] Sam Lessin: He's like, let me show you.
[00:06:26] Sam Lessin: And he pulls open Spotify.
[00:06:27] Sam Lessin: And he's like, look, he goes back to old episodes.
[00:06:29] Sam Lessin: He's like, look, you guys are talking about all this interesting shit.
[00:06:32] Sam Lessin: No, he said our headlines are getting boring.
[00:06:34] Dave Morin: Our headlines are getting boring.
[00:06:35] Dave Morin: No, I think he was just saying, you guys now it's just Apple and AI and Google and AI.
[00:06:39] Sam Lessin: He's like, stop it.
[00:06:41] Sam Lessin: Stop with the boring.
[00:06:43] Sam Lessin: So feedback team.
[00:06:44] Sam Lessin: But what else is happening other than Apple and open AI and Google?
[00:06:48] Brit Morin: I'm joking.
[00:06:49] Brit Morin: There's a lot more happening.
[00:06:50] Brit Morin: But we can take that feedback.
[00:06:52] Brit Morin: Guys, you guys, you're at your first copies of etiquette the book.
[00:06:55] Sam Lessin: I think he's bored of etiquette by now too.
[00:06:58] Dave Morin: So I don't know.
[00:06:59] Sam Lessin: We're number 22 on startup and finance bestseller list Amazon two days in.
[00:07:04] Sam Lessin: Climbing the matrix.
[00:07:05] Sam Lessin: That's a Taylor Swift song.
[00:07:06] Brit Morin: I'm going to get you a plaque that says number 22.
[00:07:09] Dave Morin: It's amazing.
[00:07:11] Jessica Lessin: Guys, like, but there has been AI news.
[00:07:15] Brit Morin: Are we not allowed to talk about it?
[00:07:16] Brit Morin: I know.
[00:07:17] Brit Morin: And now I'm afraid to talk about AI.
[00:07:18] Brit Morin: But it's like, it's code red right now.
[00:07:20] Brit Morin: I feel like we need to.
[00:07:21] Brit Morin: Sam, since when do you listen to feedback?
[00:07:23] Dave Morin: Like, I'm so confused.
[00:07:24] Dave Morin: Like, this is hit you as a.
[00:07:26] Dave Morin: It's a really good point.
[00:07:27] Sam Lessin: Yeah.
[00:07:28] Sam Lessin: Don't go off brand.
[00:07:30] Sam Lessin: I only listen to feedback when I, it's kind of like a hiring McKinsey,
[00:07:33] Sam Lessin: where you hire McKinsey to tell you the things you already know,
[00:07:36] Sam Lessin: but someone else can say them for you.
[00:07:38] Sam Lessin: And so that you can implement them.
[00:07:39] Sam Lessin: Like, I didn't do it, but McKinsey did it.
[00:07:40] Sam Lessin: Maybe it's one of those situations.
[00:07:42] Sam Lessin: Yeah, like firing half your team.
[00:07:44] Dave Morin: Well, okay, a couple of things to discuss.
[00:07:46] Dave Morin: There has been more AI news.
[00:07:47] Dave Morin: And we're also into, you know, Gemini, Gemini, Gemini.
[00:07:51] Dave Morin: And we had some skeptics on the pod last week.
[00:07:54] Dave Morin: So a lot to happen there.
[00:07:55] Dave Morin: But I also have to say, you know,
[00:07:57] Dave Morin: the major event in the lesson household this week
[00:08:00] Dave Morin: has been the arrival of the Garmin watch for children.
[00:08:04] Dave Morin: And I do actually feel like I need to talk about this a little bit
[00:08:08] Dave Morin: because first of all, Sam, would you like to describe
[00:08:11] Dave Morin: how our children ended up with Garmin watches?
[00:08:13] Dave Morin: I'm very proud of our children.
[00:08:14] Sam Lessin: So our children ended up with Garmin watches
[00:08:16] Sam Lessin: because like adult Garmin watches?
[00:08:18] Sam Lessin: Yeah, yeah, the women's, like, the smallest face
[00:08:21] Sam Lessin: ones that they've adult full on.
[00:08:22] Sam Lessin: All right.
[00:08:23] Sam Lessin: I actually like their Garmin watches kind of more than mine.
[00:08:25] Sam Lessin: I had set a goal for our oldest
[00:08:28] Sam Lessin: because he likes goals.
[00:08:29] Sam Lessin: He's a very goal oriented child,
[00:08:31] Sam Lessin: which is if he ran his age in miles,
[00:08:34] Sam Lessin: where running means no stopping
[00:08:36] Sam Lessin: and you can't go slower than a 10 minute mile at any point,
[00:08:39] Sam Lessin: that if you ran eight miles as an eight year old,
[00:08:41] Sam Lessin: I would, he could have a Garmin watch.
[00:08:44] Sam Lessin: And so he's had this go outstanding.
[00:08:45] Sam Lessin: He's almost nine.
[00:08:46] Sam Lessin: He isn't nine yet,
[00:08:47] Sam Lessin: but he's been kind of eyeing the goal
[00:08:49] Sam Lessin: and like having good emotions about
[00:08:51] Sam Lessin: nervousness, about hitting it, not.
[00:08:53] Sam Lessin: Our six year old then, who mind you is awesome,
[00:08:57] Sam Lessin: but has never run more than five laps.
[00:08:59] Sam Lessin: So 1.25 miles continuously.
[00:09:01] Sam Lessin: He's finished a 5K with some walking in the middle,
[00:09:04] Sam Lessin: but he's six.
[00:09:05] Sam Lessin: He's just never shown interest.
[00:09:06] Sam Lessin: He's like, you know, it was a mile stop.
[00:09:08] Sam Lessin: He's run 1.25 miles.
[00:09:10] Sam Lessin: I go in and like, you know, you're really ready to run too.
[00:09:12] Sam Lessin: And he's like, I can do two.
[00:09:14] Sam Lessin: So we get on the track,
[00:09:16] going into the end of the two miles
[00:09:17] Sam Lessin: and he goes, Dad, I have a surprise for you.
[00:09:19] Sam Lessin: I'm like, Maverick, what the surprise?
[00:09:21] Sam Lessin: He crosses two miles and goes, Dad, we're running six miles.
[00:09:24] Sam Lessin: I want a Garmin watch.
[00:09:26] Sam Lessin: He'd never mentioned it once.
[00:09:27] Sam Lessin: And so then he's definitely only run a mile in 0.25.
[00:09:30] Sam Lessin: Just bust it out six miles,
[00:09:31] Sam Lessin: under 10 singing the whole way.
[00:09:33] Sam Lessin: We went through, you know,
[00:09:34] Sam Lessin: well, a lot of like, what's the demon hunter down track?
[00:09:38] Sam Lessin: He's just singing a whole way,
[00:09:39] Sam Lessin: I have power, and he does it,
[00:09:41] Sam Lessin: which then obviously puts incredible stress
[00:09:43] Sam Lessin: on the eight year old.
[00:09:44] Sam Lessin: He still hasn't finished eight miles.
[00:09:45] Sam Lessin: So then he does it.
[00:09:46] Sam Lessin: And now my two sons,
[00:09:48] Sam Lessin: they start, they talk about doom scrolling their watch.
[00:09:51] Sam Lessin: They are doom scrolling their watches.
[00:09:54] Dave Morin: Guys, okay, Sam, Sam got the preamble,
[00:09:56] Dave Morin: which was a little long,
[00:09:57] Dave Morin: but this is how we end up.
[00:09:58] Dave Morin: So now a typical morning is, I come downstairs,
[00:10:02] Dave Morin: the boys are running laps.
[00:10:03] Dave Morin: Say, boys, why are you running laps around the couch?
[00:10:05] Dave Morin: Why do I get my steps in?
[00:10:07] Dave Morin: Then they'll go, Mom, do you know what time it is
[00:10:09] Dave Morin: in the Bahamas?
[00:10:10] Dave Morin: I do.
[00:10:12] Dave Morin: Then my eight year old leaves the kitchen
[00:10:14] Dave Morin: to go sit in the living room.
[00:10:15] Dave Morin: I said, where'd you go?
[00:10:16] Dave Morin: He goes, I wanted to meditate to get more meditation points.
[00:10:20] Dave Morin: And so I'm like, but he goes, but it didn't work.
[00:10:24] Dave Morin: Very self-worked.
[00:10:25] Dave Morin: So it's amazing, because here we are,
[00:10:28] Dave Morin: like, it's a connected device,
[00:10:30] Dave Morin: like we've given our six and eight year olds,
[00:10:32] Dave Morin: essentially a computer on their wrist.
[00:10:33] Dave Morin: But all I can do is tell us the time in Karachi,
[00:10:38] Dave Morin: which Lion put into his watch,
[00:10:39] Dave Morin: because they're reading a book about it.
[00:10:41] Dave Morin: Sunrise, sunset, meditation, but just seeing the obsession.
[00:10:47] Dave Morin: So I had to say you have to eat breakfast
[00:10:49] Dave Morin: and get dressed before you can run in the morning.
[00:10:52] Dave Morin: And they can't bring them to school,
[00:10:53] Dave Morin: because they would just scroll all day.
[00:10:55] Dave Morin: But it's wild, guys.
[00:10:57] Dave Morin: And it's just the perfect example of like incentives
[00:11:00] Dave Morin: and how kids are like so pliably obsessed.
[00:11:06] Brit Morin: Well, your kids versus our kids, let's be honest.
[00:11:09] Brit Morin: Like, I don't think our kids would ever run six or eight miles.
[00:11:11] Brit Morin: I don't care if we bought them a new house.
[00:11:13] Brit Morin: Like they would be like, no, I'm good.
[00:11:15] Brit Morin: No, but they would find,
[00:11:17] Brit Morin: they would find the thing out of this watch
[00:11:19] Dave Morin: that they love the most.
[00:11:19] Dave Morin: So I need to learn to program.
[00:11:21] Dave Morin: I'm gonna divide code a piano practicing app
[00:11:25] Dave Morin: that gives you reinforcement
[00:11:26] Dave Morin: when your butt has been on the bench
[00:11:28] Dave Morin: for a certain number of minutes.
[00:11:30] Dave Morin: Can I do that?
[00:11:31] This is a great idea, and this is actually pretty easy.
[00:11:33] Sam Lessin: We should make it is continuous keystrokes.
[00:11:36] Sam Lessin: So as long as you're hearing sound at some rate,
[00:11:39] Sam Lessin: if you practice like 12 hours continuously,
[00:11:41] Sam Lessin: forget button C.
[00:11:42] Sam Lessin: Well, but you have to pause some times to say the music.
[00:11:45] Sam Lessin: Yeah, you've got like a 42nd timeout on it.
[00:11:47] Sam Lessin: You know what I mean?
[00:11:48] Sam Lessin: Like, but you're just like, I wanna hear it continue.
[00:11:49] Sam Lessin: If you need a P, you better get it
[00:11:50] Sam Lessin: in one of the timeouts, you know?
[00:11:52] Sam Lessin: Segway, but did you know Duolingo has a piano?
[00:11:55] Brit Morin: I put it on my gift guide this year
[00:11:57] Brit Morin: that I can send you guys.
[00:11:58] Brit Morin: It does.
[00:11:59] Jessica Lessin: Duolingo made a piano.
[00:12:01] Brit Morin: The first is a great holiday gift.
[00:12:02] Brit Morin: Yeah, now they're teaching music and language,
[00:12:05] Brit Morin: and they actually have physical products.
[00:12:07] Brit Morin: You don't have light up keys and you follow the key.
[00:12:09] Sam Lessin: Yeah, I actually bought an earlier version of this.
[00:12:11] Sam Lessin: Yeah, I wasn't Duolingo though.
[00:12:13] Brit Morin: I don't think they're the same.
[00:12:15] Jessica Lessin: I think that Sam, you're talking about the role
[00:12:17] Jessica Lessin: or whatever it was called.
[00:12:18] Jessica Lessin: Anyway, I almost got it for my kids,
[00:12:19] Brit Morin: but I think it's interesting to see them expanded,
[00:12:22] Brit Morin: but we can get into more tech news.
[00:12:24] Brit Morin: Presumably people don't want to talk about our kids
[00:12:25] Brit Morin: all day long.
[00:12:26] Brit Morin: So Brent, tell me more about this gift guide,
[00:12:28] Dave Morin: because you know, I got to say I felt a little competitive
[00:12:30] Dave Morin: because the information has a gift guide,
[00:12:33] Dave Morin: and I was like, what is this tech gift guide?
[00:12:36] Dave Morin: And then I'm like, oh, it's just Brent.
[00:12:38] I'm not competing with you and every literal media publication
[00:12:43] Brit Morin: and influencer that's put out a gift guide this year.
[00:12:45] Brit Morin: Well, I'm just doing more social of my own,
[00:12:48] Brit Morin: and a lot of people have asked me for what I'm buying
[00:12:51] Brit Morin: people for holidays this year.
[00:12:54] Brit Morin: And I tend to be like trying to find
[00:12:56] Brit Morin: the new hottest, coolest tech gadget thing that's not dumb
[00:13:01] Brit Morin: for my kids as well as for friends.
[00:13:03] Brit Morin: And so I compiled like 10 of them
[00:13:04] Brit Morin: that are on my Instagram.
[00:13:06] Brit Morin: Are they on their now?
[00:13:07] Brit Morin: Yeah, yeah, they are.
[00:13:08] Brit Morin: Yeah, I just posted them.
[00:13:09] Brit Morin: Yeah, and yeah, there's everything from the duo Lingo Piano
[00:13:14] Brit Morin: to like the robot that I think is one of the best AI robots
[00:13:18] Brit Morin: for kids, because there's a lot of them now.
[00:13:20] Brit Morin: By the way, AI pets in robotics is like a full thing.
[00:13:24] Brit Morin: There's an vacuum cleaner.
[00:13:25] Brit Morin: I think that one was on your gift guide too, Jess.
[00:13:28] Brit Morin: Thematic.
[00:13:28] Brit Morin: Oh, I love that.
[00:13:30] Sam Lessin: Could it be some sort of like you get a score for a cool
[00:13:32] Sam Lessin: meaning like I want to like I want to cleanings
[00:13:35] Sam Lessin: like continuous vacuuming for 12 hours.
[00:13:37] Sam Lessin: You get a star.
[00:13:38] Brit Morin: And mapping it to no, that well, the robot does it.
[00:13:40] Brit Morin: It can mop and you're talking about thematic.
[00:13:43] Brit Morin: Yeah, thematic.
[00:13:44] Brit Morin: Yeah, the magic.
[00:13:44] Brit Morin: So cool.
[00:13:45] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:13:45] Brit Morin: And it recharges itself.
[00:13:47] Brit Morin: You don't have to do anything.
[00:13:48] Brit Morin: And that one's really cool.
[00:13:50] Brit Morin: Anyway, so there's a lot of these up on Instagram.com slash Brit.
[00:13:54] Brit Morin: Well, so this is actually a non AI topic that I wanted to bring up
[00:13:57] Dave Morin: because on this pod, perhaps we're all creators,
[00:14:01] Dave Morin: perhaps we're all influencers.
[00:14:03] Dave Morin: But I'd say Sam and Brit are really leaning into it
[00:14:06] Dave Morin: in this moment, right?
[00:14:07] Dave Morin: I had a tweet.
[00:14:08] Dave Morin: I made money on tweets.
[00:14:10] Sam Lessin: So I've noticed two things.
[00:14:11] Dave Morin: I've noticed Sam turning on Twitter monetization for his content.
[00:14:15] Dave Morin: And I've noticed some very fun, very peppy, very well branded Brit
[00:14:20] Dave Morin: social videos.
[00:14:20] Dave Morin: So you two discuss, what are your ambitions as in your next step
[00:14:25] Dave Morin: in the creator economy?
[00:14:27] Brit Morin: Oh, I'll discuss.
[00:14:28] Brit Morin: Well, I think that in venture capital, there's just so much going
[00:14:33] Brit Morin: on and everyone's flooded with everything.
[00:14:35] Brit Morin: The best way to draw the founders in and the ideas
[00:14:39] Brit Morin: in that you care about is to tell people what you care about.
[00:14:41] Brit Morin: And our pod is one way of doing that.
[00:14:44] Brit Morin: But on the broader enter webs, I think it's important
[00:14:48] Brit Morin: to share the things that I care about and that I think are cool.
[00:14:51] Brit Morin: And hopefully, people know someone that might be starting something
[00:14:54] Brit Morin: in that category or otherwise want to connect with me on that.
[00:14:58] Brit Morin: So that's my motivation just to tell people what I'm into.
[00:15:02] I love it.
[00:15:03] Dave Morin: I give us some, like, is it working?
[00:15:04] Brit Morin: Like what early days?
[00:15:06] Brit Morin: Like, what do you, how's it working for you?
[00:15:08] Brit Morin: To be a brand these days, and then I'm going to go like real macro.
[00:15:11] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:15:12] Brit Morin: First of all, I called this 15 years ago.
[00:15:13] Brit Morin: Like creators are brands.
[00:15:15] Brit Morin: Obviously slow believes this too.
[00:15:16] Brit Morin: Well, you sound like me too.
[00:15:17] Brit Morin: I called it years ago.
[00:15:19] Brit Morin: But I call this Britain Co.
[00:15:20] Brit Morin: And I put my name in the brand.
[00:15:23] Look that cookie.
[00:15:25] Brit Morin: Creator people are brands.
[00:15:27] Brit Morin: And to get the share of any voice and to be top of mind for anyone,
[00:15:31] Brit Morin: you have to make content and have media on the web.
[00:15:35] Brit Morin: And so you have to then decide what you care about and what kind of people
[00:15:39] Brit Morin: you want to draw towards you.
[00:15:40] Brit Morin: And that's how it's working.
[00:15:42] Brit Morin: So yeah, I've gotten a lot of people like sending me more deals,
[00:15:45] Brit Morin: people DMing me, sort of pressure testing my thesis on different topics.
[00:15:49] Brit Morin: But there's more to come.
[00:15:51] Brit Morin: So stay tuned.
[00:15:51] Brit Morin: I'm going to be lighting up my LinkedIn and other channels soon.
[00:15:55] Brit Morin: And you know what else is weird?
[00:15:56] Brit Morin: I also am lighting up TikTok.
[00:15:59] Brit Morin: And TikTok's a whole different planet.
[00:16:01] Brit Morin: I've discovered, you've got to be very basic there, not as deep.
[00:16:06] Brit Morin: So I got to go up a level in terms of what's happening in tech.
[00:16:11] Sam Lessin: I love the screenshot essay a long time.
[00:16:13] Sam Lessin: I've done a lot of deals off screenshot essays.
[00:16:15] Sam Lessin: Because you put out your thesis into the universe.
[00:16:19] Sam Lessin: And then if you make it a punchy headlines,
[00:16:22] Sam Lessin: people get mad, but then say something reasonable in the screenshot
[00:16:25] Sam Lessin: that most people don't read, it gets packaged and sent all over the place.
[00:16:29] Sam Lessin: And then smarter people will give you better ideas
[00:16:31] Sam Lessin: and send you company.
[00:16:32] Sam Lessin: So I've done like, probably like a dozen investments.
[00:16:35] Sam Lessin: Where like I put out something nuts, or maybe the eye only is nuts,
[00:16:39] Sam Lessin: but some people do.
[00:16:40] Sam Lessin: And then you better stuff that everything in area two farms,
[00:16:42] Sam Lessin: which we seeded was from a screen shot essay.
[00:16:44] Sam Lessin: I just did this deal where I guess remember my petty lawsuit thesis, right?
[00:16:49] Sam Lessin: Where like it.
[00:16:49] Sam Lessin: So I literally, I was like, someone needs to start petty lawsuit,
[00:16:52] Sam Lessin: but some guy started it.
[00:16:54] Sam Lessin: And so I funded petty lawsuit.
[00:16:56] Sam Lessin: Then and so like there's also, I do, for me,
[00:16:59] Sam Lessin: it's very professional that way.
[00:17:00] Sam Lessin: Now I will say what's changed for me is I do quite enjoy Twitter,
[00:17:06] Sam Lessin: the outrage game TM.
[00:17:08] Sam Lessin: It's like pretty fun.
[00:17:09] Sam Lessin: And so for me, I've been doing like the Twitter for deal sourcing
[00:17:13] Sam Lessin: and Definder tribe and to intentionally reject the other tribe
[00:17:16] Sam Lessin: so that you don't have to listen to them because it's noise for a long time.
[00:17:19] Sam Lessin: And I think that's been actually can't really how I source
[00:17:22] Sam Lessin: because I'm lazy for like years.
[00:17:23] Sam Lessin: But now I'm like into the Twitter the outrage game,
[00:17:26] Sam Lessin: where I'm getting pretty good at posting things,
[00:17:29] Sam Lessin: which are like, I'm pretty sure can go hyper viral.
[00:17:33] Sam Lessin: So I'll give you an example.
[00:17:34] Sam Lessin: Last week I posted this thing about how like you can't compound your way to wealth anymore,
[00:17:38] Sam Lessin: which wild is like four million views looking at like 20,000 likes.
[00:17:44] Sam Lessin: And like the reason that works is because some people really like it
[00:17:48] Sam Lessin: and agree with it.
[00:17:49] Sam Lessin: And then a lot of people don't.
[00:17:50] Sam Lessin: And you need them to argue with each other, right?
[00:17:52] Sam Lessin: So it's kind of like draw like and that is a fun game.
[00:17:54] Sam Lessin: I turned on monetization because I'm like, wait a minute,
[00:17:56] Sam Lessin: I can get it paid for this too.
[00:17:58] Sam Lessin: And like as a creator, I should have paid.
[00:18:00] Sam Lessin: So what trickle of income has come in?
[00:18:02] Dave Morin: Give us the monetization report.
[00:18:04] Dave Morin: I'm going to pay for that heat in your house, Sam.
[00:18:06] Dave Morin: Well, exactly.
[00:18:07] Sam Lessin: We got to turn the heat back on.
[00:18:08] Sam Lessin: I'm big move down.
[00:18:09] I know it's like I know that but I have thousands of dollars
[00:18:12] Sam Lessin: of unclean subscription rewards that I need to like collect.
[00:18:14] Sam Lessin: But now I'm not sure.
[00:18:15] Sam Lessin: I don't know much on when it paid.
[00:18:17] Sam Lessin: I have a lot of validated followers.
[00:18:18] Sam Lessin: And I think I might get literally hundreds of dollars
[00:18:22] Sam Lessin: when I get my first pay out because I finally turned it on.
[00:18:25] Sam Lessin: Although I still can't figure out a connect of bank account.
[00:18:26] Sam Lessin: So I don't actually know how to collect the money.
[00:18:29] Sam Lessin: I keep getting my bank accounts
[00:18:30] Sam Lessin: keep saying I can't.
[00:18:31] Sam Lessin: This is my problem.
[00:18:32] Dave Morin: I have sweet venture capital returns stuck in angel list.
[00:18:36] Dave Morin: I actually don't I actually think I have
[00:18:38] Sam Lessin: stuck in angel list is is outline ventures distribution.
[00:18:42] Sam Lessin: I can't get out.
[00:18:43] Sam Lessin: Did you guys you guys used angel lists?
[00:18:45] Sam Lessin: Even offline ventures or outline ventures.
[00:18:48] Brit Morin: I'm sorry, that's what I meant.
[00:18:49] Sam Lessin: Yes.
[00:18:51] Like yeah, we've had some distributions.
[00:18:53] Brit Morin: We have another one coming for you.
[00:18:55] Brit Morin: I can't get them.
[00:18:56] Sam Lessin: Can you send me a check?
[00:18:57] Sam Lessin: You're paying your investors money.
[00:18:59] Brit Morin: That's amazing.
[00:19:00] Brit Morin: Well, we are paying our investors money.
[00:19:02] Brit Morin: When we first started offline,
[00:19:03] Brit Morin: we did it through a rolling fund while the pandemic was kicking off
[00:19:07] Brit Morin: because that was like a weird time and turns out now all
[00:19:10] Brit Morin: those investments, a lot of them are selling.
[00:19:12] Brit Morin: And it's a rolling funds like it's a money.
[00:19:14] Sam Lessin: You get rolling you get money,
[00:19:15] Brit Morin: but you need to go log in and get it.
[00:19:17] Brit Morin: The VCs will love this.
[00:19:18] Sam Lessin: I can't get it because I can't log in.
[00:19:20] Sam Lessin: Or VCs will love it.
[00:19:21] Sam Lessin: I was with Kevin Collar yesterday.
[00:19:22] Sam Lessin: You just pushed the forgot password button, Sam.
[00:19:25] Sam Lessin: No, I can get in.
[00:19:26] Sam Lessin: I can't get the money.
[00:19:27] Sam Lessin: I don't know what's going on.
[00:19:28] You have to prove that you're like a legit entity.
[00:19:31] Dave Morin: Like I had to assert all these things.
[00:19:33] Dave Morin: But I thought we're true, but.
[00:19:35] I don't know.
[00:19:36] Sam Lessin: You guys are longer.
[00:19:37] Sam Lessin: The dreaded assertion.
[00:19:38] Sam Lessin: So I don't like being in the office with people,
[00:19:41] Sam Lessin: as you might have noticed.
[00:19:43] Sam Lessin: But I do get a reminder, everyone's in the way,
[00:19:45] Sam Lessin: that you are missing something
[00:19:46] Sam Lessin: you're not being in the office.
[00:19:47] Sam Lessin: Because we had Kevin Collar in my business partner days,
[00:19:50] Sam Lessin: four of his business partners over the yesterday.
[00:19:52] Sam Lessin: Kevin's created a lot of things.
[00:19:53] Sam Lessin: It's great raising money.
[00:19:54] Sam Lessin: He created a lot of things.
[00:19:55] Sam Lessin: He's got great one liners.
[00:19:56] Sam Lessin: And because I'm not in person with him,
[00:19:58] Sam Lessin: I don't get them.
[00:19:59] Sam Lessin: And so we had a situation where you'll appreciate Dave.
[00:20:02] Sam Lessin: No one liners over Zoom.
[00:20:03] Sam Lessin: They're not in the same punch.
[00:20:05] Sam Lessin: And he had this incredible one liner
[00:20:07] Sam Lessin: where we got this notice that we're unlocked
[00:20:09] Sam Lessin: on some stock that we can sell.
[00:20:11] Sam Lessin: And it's one of these things where like,
[00:20:14] Sam Lessin: we didn't even buy equity in this company.
[00:20:15] Sam Lessin: We bought equity in something else.
[00:20:16] Sam Lessin: They got rolled over six times and bought.
[00:20:19] Sam Lessin: And like, whatever, we said,
[00:20:21] Sam Lessin: and we made it turns out like three times our investment,
[00:20:25] Sam Lessin: like 20 years later on this.
[00:20:27] Sam Lessin: Just from holding.
[00:20:29] Holding and letting it roll over six times.
[00:20:31] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:20:32] Sam Lessin: No, that one's better than that.
[00:20:34] Sam Lessin: But like Kevin goes, Kevin goes,
[00:20:36] Sam Lessin: to doctin.
[00:20:38] That's what they pay us for.
[00:20:39] Sam Lessin: Another investment returner.
[00:20:44] The goal of the capital is to have,
[00:20:47] Sam Lessin: not for you, not only say it's a fund returner.
[00:20:49] Sam Lessin: It's like, we had an investment returner.
[00:20:51] Sam Lessin: It's so good.
[00:20:52] Sam Lessin: Did you guys see our friend Adam Assyria's ordering
[00:20:55] Brit Morin: all Instagram employees back to office five days a week
[00:20:58] Brit Morin: as of February?
[00:20:59] Brit Morin: Whatever I say now will appear in my next all hands.
[00:21:02] Dave Morin: And so I will be quiet.
[00:21:05] Sam Lessin: My reaction to that when I saw it was at one,
[00:21:07] Sam Lessin: now I understand why he declined my invite
[00:21:09] Sam Lessin: to go hell is skiing in the spring.
[00:21:13] Sam Lessin: The reason I wouldn't do that is because then I would have to do it.
[00:21:16] Sam Lessin: So like I can order everyone out,
[00:21:18] Sam Lessin: but I don't, he's too much of a good leader
[00:21:20] Sam Lessin: to just make his people do it and then not do it himself.
[00:21:22] Sam Lessin: That's true.
[00:21:24] That's funny.
[00:21:25] Brit Morin: Good on you Adam.
[00:21:26] Sam Lessin: I mean, maybe Adam, you're gonna like,
[00:21:27] Sam Lessin: but we gotta put like a cold plunging your office now.
[00:21:30] Sam Lessin: Like how, like you can't go,
[00:21:31] Sam Lessin: you know the office five days a week?
[00:21:34] Dave Morin: And this is on the road four days a week.
[00:21:35] Dave Morin: So I think that the office five days a week
[00:21:39] Jessica Lessin: or is that will Instagram be the only division?
[00:21:41] Jessica Lessin: I think there'll be the only division.
[00:21:43] Jessica Lessin: But they need it.
[00:21:44] Jessica Lessin: That's like the economic engine.
[00:21:46] Sam Lessin: They need to make, they need to pump more money.
[00:21:49] Guys, did you see the other meta news?
[00:21:50] Brit Morin: Just did you see this about Alan Dye?
[00:21:53] Yes, Britt, tell the people, big news.
[00:21:55] Brit Morin: This is big deal.
[00:21:56] Brit Morin: Alan Dye, Apple's design lead is leaving the company
[00:22:02] Brit Morin: and joining meta.
[00:22:03] Brit Morin: Interface design lead.
[00:22:05] Jessica Lessin: I was gonna say wait for Dave to correct him.
[00:22:07] Brit Morin: Wait for Dave to correct him.
[00:22:09] Brit Morin: As chief design officer on December 31st,
[00:22:12] Brit Morin: Annie's gonna report to Buzz, who we know,
[00:22:15] Brit Morin: the CTO of meta.
[00:22:16] Brit Morin: I like how you thought that was the most interesting part of the office.
[00:22:19] Dave Morin: Well, I just like that, that I was in one headline.
[00:22:22] Brit Morin: And I think that this is a big deal
[00:22:25] Brit Morin: because as we've been talking about with AI
[00:22:27] Brit Morin: and all the big tech companies,
[00:22:29] Brit Morin: like there have been pros and cons about what Apple's up to
[00:22:33] Brit Morin: and like how their momentum is going
[00:22:36] Brit Morin: and this is just like a really interesting signal.
[00:22:38] Brit Morin: What signal do you believe that sends?
[00:22:40] Sam Lessin: That's up paid a shitload A.
[00:22:42] Brit Morin: And like he's chief design officer.
[00:22:45] Brit Morin: So that's everything, right?
[00:22:46] Brit Morin: At meta.
[00:22:47] Brit Morin: Is that across all meta products?
[00:22:50] Brit Morin: I don't know.
[00:22:51] Brit Morin: I don't know meta's or chart.
[00:22:51] Brit Morin: He might have to go into the office five days a week.
[00:22:53] Brit Morin: I know.
[00:22:54] Brit Morin: What is he signing up for?
[00:22:55] Brit Morin: You think he's signing?
[00:22:56] Sam Lessin: He's like, oh shit, forget it.
[00:22:58] Sam Lessin: Five days a week, then forget it.
[00:23:00] Sam Lessin: My understanding is that Alan was the,
[00:23:03] Jessica Lessin: he was the lead on liquid glass
[00:23:06] Jessica Lessin: and the big interface update that just happened,
[00:23:10] Jessica Lessin: which is a lot related to AR interface.
[00:23:16] Jessica Lessin: And so the reporting to BAS,
[00:23:18] Jessica Lessin: I would bet, you know, working on the meta glasses,
[00:23:22] Jessica Lessin: I think that's the strategic move here
[00:23:24] Jessica Lessin: that he's got real sort of chops.
[00:23:27] Jessica Lessin: He also was the lead on Vision Pro
[00:23:30] Jessica Lessin: and that whole Vision OS design project,
[00:23:33] Jessica Lessin: if I remember correctly.
[00:23:34] Jessica Lessin: And so it's kind of a big coup from that perspective
[00:23:39] Jessica Lessin: that whole design stream is going over to meta.
[00:23:42] Jessica Lessin: Or it could just be that liquid glass
[00:23:44] Sam Lessin: is super fucking annoying and hard to implement.
[00:23:46] Sam Lessin: So they need to hire him to implement liquid glass.
[00:23:48] Sam Lessin: Fair enough.
[00:23:49] Sam Lessin: At meta.
[00:23:50] Sam Lessin: At meta.
[00:23:51] Sam Lessin: Because they're gonna be forced to.
[00:23:52] Sam Lessin: And they're just like, this is too hard.
[00:23:54] Sam Lessin: We need to get the guy who made it.
[00:23:55] Sam Lessin: The guy who made it.
[00:23:57] Couple interesting things.
[00:23:58] Dave Morin: So Mark Garmin at Bloomberg had the scoop
[00:24:00] Dave Morin: and Tim actually had a statement on it,
[00:24:04] Dave Morin: which I thought was highly unusual
[00:24:06] Dave Morin: and is a sign of what a big gloss it was for them.
[00:24:09] Dave Morin: Pretty high profile.
[00:24:11] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, yeah, no.
[00:24:12] Dave Morin: I mean, no one's arguing it's not high profile,
[00:24:13] Dave Morin: but Tim had a banal statement
[00:24:18] Dave Morin: defending the bench of design talent they had in Apple,
[00:24:21] Dave Morin: which is not as bad as Jensen saying their GPUs
[00:24:27] Dave Morin: were better than Google's TPUs in a comms tweet from Nvidia.
[00:24:31] Dave Morin: But, you know, could perhaps be considered
[00:24:33] Dave Morin: in the same family.
[00:24:34] Dave Morin: So I've been playing with the theory, guys,
[00:24:36] Dave Morin: that I'm gonna reveal as part of my predictions
[00:24:39] Dave Morin: to our pro subscribers,
[00:24:41] Dave Morin: I don't know this week, where?
[00:24:42] Dave Morin: K-Me mother fucker.
[00:24:43] Jessica Lessin: I am going, I have decided.
[00:24:46] Dave Morin: Wait, let's pro or the information pro?
[00:24:48] Jessica Lessin: The information pro.
[00:24:49] Dave Morin: You know, like when people meet with me,
[00:24:51] Dave Morin: they seem to think I have a lot of opinions
[00:24:53] Dave Morin: that are mildly useful to them.
[00:24:55] Dave Morin: We should start to only fans together.
[00:24:57] Sam Lessin: And they're surprised.
[00:24:59] Like I could be like, you know,
[00:25:02] Dave Morin: some things I have to hold back on,
[00:25:03] Dave Morin: some things I don't.
[00:25:04] Dave Morin: And I have, I think there's 27 going,
[00:25:08] Dave Morin: and 29, pretty specific,
[00:25:12] Dave Morin: some are wild, some are calling out individual companies,
[00:25:14] Dave Morin: people, whole thing.
[00:25:15] Dave Morin: And I'm just gonna let it flow
[00:25:18] Dave Morin: for information pro subscribers.
[00:25:19] Dave Morin: But.
[00:25:20] Dave Morin: Just, can I tell you one thing?
[00:25:21] Sam Lessin: There is a better business model to this,
[00:25:23] Sam Lessin: what you want to do,
[00:25:24] Sam Lessin: which is called running a hedge fund.
[00:25:26] Sam Lessin: I don't know if you can consider it.
[00:25:27] Sam Lessin: No, no, I just, you know.
[00:25:28] Sam Lessin: You want to get a heat turn back on in our house.
[00:25:30] Sam Lessin: Maybe you could run a hedge fund,
[00:25:32] Sam Lessin: instead of just giving it to the pro subscribers
[00:25:34] Sam Lessin: or two little.
[00:25:35] Dave Morin: You know, I was born with different DNA
[00:25:36] Dave Morin: and in another life, man, in another life.
[00:25:39] Dave Morin: Maybe if we run out of all the money,
[00:25:40] Sam Lessin: you know, we can totally start a hedge fund.
[00:25:42] Sam Lessin: You know, if we really need the fuel,
[00:25:44] Dave Morin: I would trade, I mean, I will not trade against these,
[00:25:46] Dave Morin: but I have a lot of conviction around these.
[00:25:47] Dave Morin: There's a lot that's on the cutting room floor.
[00:25:49] Dave Morin: You have to really pay for that.
[00:25:50] Dave Morin: You're like, you're supposed to say,
[00:25:51] Sam Lessin: this is not financial,
[00:25:52] Sam Lessin: like not I would definitely trade these.
[00:25:54] Sam Lessin: I need a snake meat.
[00:25:55] Dave Morin: So I will give more next week,
[00:25:57] Dave Morin: but I feel very, very confident about
[00:26:00] Dave Morin: for it to protect my pro community, who my love.
[00:26:03] Dave Morin: But one theme, this isn't like a prediction,
[00:26:05] Dave Morin: but this is one framework for my predictions.
[00:26:08] Dave Morin: And you guys tell me what you think.
[00:26:09] Dave Morin: I'm still workshopping it.
[00:26:10] Dave Morin: So I think that like maybe the last 18 months,
[00:26:13] Dave Morin: AI has kind of like lifted
[00:26:16] Dave Morin: and all these tech companies in like the similar wave,
[00:26:20] Dave Morin: similar hype, similar fortunes.
[00:26:22] Dave Morin: It's like run up a lot of momentum,
[00:26:25] Dave Morin: investor sentiment, blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:27] Dave Morin: I think next year, the fortunes are going to start
[00:26:29] Dave Morin: to diverge very dramatically.
[00:26:31] Dave Morin: And that the sort of era of like the AI tailwind
[00:26:37] Dave Morin: for big tech startups,
[00:26:38] Dave Morin: I think we're still going to see huge winners,
[00:26:41] Dave Morin: but I think just across the board,
[00:26:43] Dave Morin: the fortunes are going to diverge very dramatically.
[00:26:45] Dave Morin: And so that is one thing I just,
[00:26:49] Dave Morin: I think about when I think of Apple and Meta,
[00:26:51] Dave Morin: not because I have high confidence,
[00:26:54] Dave Morin: which way either of them are going,
[00:26:55] Dave Morin: but we've wanted to like,
[00:26:58] and the press has played a part in this,
[00:27:00] Dave Morin: the so of the companies and sort of like showing
[00:27:03] Dave Morin: all the areas and all the battles that are head to head
[00:27:06] Dave Morin: to make them look like they're all in this even footing.
[00:27:09] Dave Morin: And I think the results and the investments
[00:27:12] Dave Morin: and the strategies will start to diverge a lot more
[00:27:14] Dave Morin: and that will leave some people,
[00:27:17] Dave Morin: I think the tide will go out for some people
[00:27:19] Dave Morin: and the tide will keep rising for others.
[00:27:20] Dave Morin: So what's your trade advice then?
[00:27:22] Sam Lessin: Is it like short, a QQ, longer favorites?
[00:27:25] Sam Lessin: Like what's the play?
[00:27:26] Sam Lessin: Well, I don't really want to tell people what to do,
[00:27:29] Dave Morin: but I'm going to read the information they'll know.
[00:27:32] Last pod, the chart that we showed
[00:27:34] Jessica Lessin: of the OpenAI complex versus the Google complex
[00:27:37] Jessica Lessin: is the most obvious one.
[00:27:39] Jessica Lessin: I think Meta's lack of an enterprise business
[00:27:42] Dave Morin: is going to be much more of a liability for it.
[00:27:44] Dave Morin: Oh, interesting.
[00:27:45] Sam Lessin: Really? Why?
[00:27:46] Sam Lessin: They just make all the money on ads.
[00:27:47] Sam Lessin: No, but I think for its CAPEX strategy, I think,
[00:27:49] Dave Morin: interesting.
[00:27:50] Dave Morin: I think this is already happening.
[00:27:53] Dave Morin: Investors are not giving in.
[00:27:54] Dave Morin: They don't have a cloud business
[00:27:56] Jessica Lessin: or what type of business.
[00:27:57] Jessica Lessin: They don't sell, well, they don't sell stuff to businesses.
[00:28:00] Dave Morin: They don't sell software.
[00:28:01] Dave Morin: They don't sell compute.
[00:28:02] Dave Morin: They don't sell chips.
[00:28:03] Dave Morin: They don't sell anything.
[00:28:04] Dave Morin: Like Google workspace.
[00:28:06] Dave Morin: No, I know, but there are several, you know,
[00:28:08] Jessica Lessin: there's like Amazon AWS, like as a big cloud business
[00:28:11] Jessica Lessin: as is Google Cloud, right?
[00:28:13] Jessica Lessin: And so I'm just wondering which one or you're just
[00:28:15] Jessica Lessin: just sort of saying any.
[00:28:16] Jessica Lessin: Well, I mean, all dimensions, right?
[00:28:17] Jessica Lessin: Any and all.
[00:28:18] Dave Morin: No, so I think that's one example.
[00:28:19] Dave Morin: I was just saying in terms of interesting anecdotes of the day,
[00:28:22] Sam Lessin: I actually got really interesting inbound
[00:28:24] Sam Lessin: from Amazon Web Services this week, which is interesting,
[00:28:28] Sam Lessin: because here's the thing, which was, you know,
[00:28:30] Sam Lessin: I've had been...
[00:28:31] Sam Lessin: It's their big Vegas conference reinvents him.
[00:28:34] Dave Morin: No, here's like, I've had, like, I, for hilarious reasons,
[00:28:38] Sam Lessin: was on the original Amazon Web Services customer device
[00:28:40] Sam Lessin: re-board when I was like in my mid 20s and I was 26.
[00:28:43] Sam Lessin: I don't know how I ended up in this room.
[00:28:45] Sam Lessin: I was so outclassed.
[00:28:46] Sam Lessin: It was like me and like the CTO of like every major company.
[00:28:49] Sam Lessin: And I barely ever stayed there talking.
[00:28:50] Sam Lessin: That was the drop-y-o days.
[00:28:52] Dave Morin: That was so fun.
[00:28:53] Dave Morin: Yeah, I spent a lot of, yes.
[00:28:55] Sam Lessin: And I was a kid and start-ups.
[00:28:56] Sam Lessin: It was really interesting.
[00:28:57] Sam Lessin: I got a cool jacket from the first time that was convened.
[00:29:00] Sam Lessin: But I haven't heard from Amazon as like a company reaching out
[00:29:03] Sam Lessin: from the VC startup ecosystem in a long time.
[00:29:07] Sam Lessin: And they're calling me like, they're like, let's do business.
[00:29:09] Sam Lessin: We have them.
[00:29:10] Brit Morin: Oh, we have credits for them.
[00:29:12] Brit Morin: Of course, we got six funds.
[00:29:14] Sam Lessin: We want to do business.
[00:29:15] Sam Lessin: We want to, like, tell us what you need.
[00:29:16] Sam Lessin: This is our initiative.
[00:29:17] Sam Lessin: I was like, huh, you guys want to get back in this cloud game,
[00:29:20] Sam Lessin: eh?
[00:29:21] Sam Lessin: That's not a bad thing.
[00:29:22] Sam Lessin: I was just surprised.
[00:29:23] Dave Morin: This cloud game, they had like blue expectations
[00:29:25] Dave Morin: on their last quarter.
[00:29:27] Dave Morin: Like, they're in the cloud game.
[00:29:28] Dave Morin: It's interesting, when I thought you were
[00:29:30] Sam Lessin: point about there could be people, the big clouds
[00:29:31] Sam Lessin: are being a little bit more like wanting
[00:29:33] Sam Lessin: to drum up some business than they have historically.
[00:29:35] Sam Lessin: Well, what's happening in AWS, which is really important,
[00:29:39] Dave Morin: actually, is, you know, the whole narrative has been,
[00:29:44] Dave Morin: they've been on their back foot in AI, which is not untrue.
[00:29:48] Same good one, narrative.
[00:29:49] Sam Lessin: The big play was to invest in Anthropic.
[00:29:52] Dave Morin: And then they have bedrock platform for accessing many models.
[00:29:56] Dave Morin: But like the open AI's and Google's and Microsoft's
[00:29:59] Dave Morin: of the world, what is you to think they were in the dark ages?
[00:30:02] Dave Morin: Then last quarter, AWS, like crushed it.
[00:30:05] Dave Morin: And investors and reporters were like, huh.
[00:30:10] So it turns out that a, this has been lifting all boats,
[00:30:15] Dave Morin: right?
[00:30:15] Dave Morin: Like that the demand for compute is also pulling people
[00:30:18] Dave Morin: into the cloud.
[00:30:19] Dave Morin: Like AI is also getting even more of the laggards
[00:30:22] Dave Morin: who are still on prem to the cloud, right?
[00:30:25] Dave Morin: And AWS is also really good for AI workloads and all,
[00:30:28] Dave Morin: you know, all this stuff.
[00:30:30] Dave Morin: And they revealed, I don't remember the details,
[00:30:32] Dave Morin: but like huge infrastructure investments.
[00:30:34] Dave Morin: This is the time then, like if you announce
[00:30:36] Dave Morin: a big infrastructure investment, you're stock went up
[00:30:38] Dave Morin: because people saw that you wanted to be players
[00:30:41] Dave Morin: and all that kind of stuff.
[00:30:42] Dave Morin: So who knows what the future will bring?
[00:30:44] Dave Morin: There's certainly challenges for AWS.
[00:30:47] Dave Morin: But it's like, you know, they're in the game.
[00:30:50] Dave Morin: They've never left the game.
[00:30:52] Dave Morin: It's just Google is growing, really,
[00:30:55] Dave Morin: Google Cloud is growing really fast too.
[00:30:57] Dave Morin: But, you know, they're multiples bigger.
[00:31:00] Dave Morin: So it's a, and now they'll have Sam's business.
[00:31:03] Dave Morin: But sure, I mean, I do business.
[00:31:05] Sam Lessin: You should have to reinvent.
[00:31:07] Dave Morin: I was talking a lot of people who were reinvented.
[00:31:09] Dave Morin: Well, I mean, I'm reporting there.
[00:31:11] Dave Morin: Is it the Amazon thing?
[00:31:12] Dave Morin: Yeah, the AWS thing.
[00:31:13] Dave Morin: I thought it was interesting.
[00:31:14] Dave Morin: I noticed that they have these Nova AI models.
[00:31:17] Jessica Lessin: I hadn't actually heard of what their models were called.
[00:31:20] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, and I and Nova, we're going to use all of this thing.
[00:31:22] Jessica Lessin: I don't think people love Nova,
[00:31:23] Dave Morin: but people like the new agent stuff, although,
[00:31:26] Dave Morin: I had never even heard of it until yesterday.
[00:31:29] Do you guys know agents that's not looking so good
[00:31:31] Dave Morin: for the agents?
[00:31:32] Brit Morin: Have you heard?
[00:31:32] Brit Morin: Really?
[00:31:33] Jessica Lessin: What's happening with the agents?
[00:31:34] Jessica Lessin: Well, the agents are also getting paused by open AI
[00:31:37] Brit Morin: for the next year.
[00:31:38] Jessica Lessin: Hollywood agents during this, during this code red,
[00:31:40] Brit Morin: during code red, no commerce coming soon,
[00:31:43] Brit Morin: no agents coming soon, no ads coming soon.
[00:31:48] Brit Morin: Guys, I really, I'm going to confess something
[00:31:50] Dave Morin: and be very vulnerable on the pod.
[00:31:53] Dave Morin: I kind of think there's a 50% chance
[00:31:55] Dave Morin: Sam Altman wrote that memo
[00:31:56] Dave Morin: so people would not know their actual strategy.
[00:31:59] Dave Morin: I mean, the memo is authentic.
[00:32:01] Dave Morin: Like the memo is authentic.
[00:32:03] Dave Morin: That's fake strategy.
[00:32:04] Dave Morin: It's like, surprise, it's all agents and commerce.
[00:32:09] Sam Lessin: We tricked you.
[00:32:11] Sam Lessin: Code red is actually only about commerce.
[00:32:14] Sam Lessin: Maybe 49%.
[00:32:16] Dave Morin: I mean, Steph Palazolo and Aaron Wu
[00:32:19] Dave Morin: to fabulous information reporters reported late one night
[00:32:23] Dave Morin: that in response to growth in Gemini
[00:32:26] Dave Morin: and trends at Chattity B.T. Altman called a code red.
[00:32:29] Dave Morin: To Ritz Point, he said they were going to deemphasize ads
[00:32:33] Dave Morin: and agents and really work on the model
[00:32:36] Dave Morin: and the product and all this stuff.
[00:32:38] Dave Morin: And what was interesting about this too
[00:32:41] Dave Morin: is you guys remember a couple of weeks ago
[00:32:42] Dave Morin: when everyone had a lot of the industry had their hands
[00:32:45] Dave Morin: on Gemini and the reviews were very positive,
[00:32:47] Dave Morin: but it wasn't out yet.
[00:32:49] Dave Morin: Altman wrote another memo reported by the information
[00:32:52] Dave Morin: that said, stay the course.
[00:32:54] Dave Morin: It's going to be tough vibes, but heads down, stay the course.
[00:32:58] Dave Morin: So you have this big reversal.
[00:32:59] Dave Morin: So, okay, we've all written memos
[00:33:01] Dave Morin: to our companies over the years, right?
[00:33:02] Dave Morin: You're trying to signal something.
[00:33:03] Dave Morin: You're trying to show you're not being complacent.
[00:33:05] Dave Morin: Reporting shows that work on agents and ads continues,
[00:33:09] Dave Morin: not surprisingly.
[00:33:10] Dave Morin: But yeah, there is this big rallying cry around Chattity B.T.
[00:33:14] Dave Morin: And then I saw some great charts today
[00:33:17] Dave Morin: and Dave's always trying to keep me honest
[00:33:19] Dave Morin: and asked for the chart.
[00:33:20] Dave Morin: And then I give him the chart
[00:33:21] Dave Morin: and then he tells me why the chart,
[00:33:23] Dave Morin: what the chart is missing.
[00:33:24] Dave Morin: Is it a chart that's missing?
[00:33:25] Dave Morin: No, I give him an FT chart
[00:33:27] Dave Morin: and he's like ripping into the FT chart.
[00:33:30] Dave Morin: Oh, I can't, I can't affect their X and Y axis.
[00:33:34] Brit Morin: We're investors.
[00:33:35] Brit Morin: We critique charts and slides.
[00:33:37] Brit Morin: Jess, that's like what we do for a living.
[00:33:38] Brit Morin: All I said, Jess, is I want to see Instagram
[00:33:41] Jessica Lessin: time spent on the same chart.
[00:33:43] Dave Morin: Yeah, but anyway, the flat light,
[00:33:45] Dave Morin: like the time spent,
[00:33:47] Dave Morin: and remember Chattity B.T. thinks it's metta,
[00:33:49] Dave Morin: so time spent matters.
[00:33:50] Dave Morin: It's down, 7%, 6% I don't know.
[00:33:53] Dave Morin: And what time period?
[00:33:55] And what time period?
[00:33:57] And like, this is when the kids are writing their papers
[00:33:59] Sam Lessin: and it's still down.
[00:34:00] Sam Lessin: But do you know why Google's time spent is up?
[00:34:02] Brit Morin: Because it takes Google two to three acts as long.
[00:34:06] Brit Morin: It asks so many follow-up questions.
[00:34:08] Brit Morin: Yes, yes.
[00:34:10] Brit Morin: No, it takes two to three Xs long to get me an answer.
[00:34:13] Brit Morin: And I'm sitting there waiting, whereas G.P.T. is much more quick.
[00:34:17] Jessica Lessin: Is that actually true?
[00:34:18] Jessica Lessin: Two to three X?
[00:34:19] Jessica Lessin: Yes, totally true.
[00:34:20] Brit Morin: As of last week on the pod,
[00:34:22] Brit Morin: I told everyone here that I was going to now make
[00:34:25] Brit Morin: Jim and I my main LLM.
[00:34:28] Brit Morin: I exported all my Chattity B.T. memory
[00:34:31] Brit Morin: and tried to upload it into Jim and I,
[00:34:33] Brit Morin: turns out you can upload 10 files at once.
[00:34:36] Brit Morin: And I have thousands of files in my G.P.T. memory
[00:34:39] Brit Morin: and I was like, fuck this.
[00:34:40] Brit Morin: And I just did it.
[00:34:41] Brit Morin: I like uploaded 30.
[00:34:42] Brit Morin: Do you have to be combining it to one file for you?
[00:34:45] Sam Lessin: It wouldn't do it because it has all these images
[00:34:47] Brit Morin: and all these things.
[00:34:48] Brit Morin: That's how you get around GDPR down
[00:34:50] Sam Lessin: on your data restrictions.
[00:34:52] Sam Lessin: Look, here's a few things.
[00:34:53] Sam Lessin: Hold on, hold on.
[00:34:54] Sam Lessin: I'm not done yet.
[00:34:55] Brit Morin: I just need to finish.
[00:34:56] Brit Morin: So I start using Jim and I exclusively.
[00:34:58] Brit Morin: And it's like giving me good answers,
[00:34:59] Brit Morin: but it's taking so long.
[00:35:00] Brit Morin: I don't have time to wait for this shit.
[00:35:02] Brit Morin: And you know what else I like about G.P.T.?
[00:35:04] Brit Morin: Especially on mobile is the haptic feedback.
[00:35:07] Brit Morin: Like the little, do you guys have a turn on
[00:35:09] Brit Morin: where it makes a little vibration?
[00:35:11] Brit Morin: Well, that's not profitable.
[00:35:13] Sam Lessin: Well, I'm just saying, it's quick.
[00:35:14] Brit Morin: That's the differentiator feedback.
[00:35:17] Sam Lessin: It's haptic.
[00:35:18] Brit Morin: I feel like I'm talking to this thing in real time
[00:35:20] Brit Morin: and so now I'm back to G.P.T.
[00:35:22] Brit Morin: So I've done the full boomerang.
[00:35:24] Sam Lessin: A few thoughts.
[00:35:24] Sam Lessin: One, I do like your point that time spent
[00:35:27] Sam Lessin: has a lot to do with waiting for answers
[00:35:28] Sam Lessin: but you also suggest the solution
[00:35:30] Sam Lessin: in 2026 to everyone's problems.
[00:35:32] Sam Lessin: Pre-Rolls.
[00:35:33] Sam Lessin: You know, if you just like throw a pre-roll video ad
[00:35:36] Sam Lessin: while coming up with your answer, boom,
[00:35:38] Sam Lessin: there's the monetization.
[00:35:39] Sam Lessin: They're pausing ads.
[00:35:41] Brit Morin: Says Sam Altman.
[00:35:42] Brit Morin: He just jammed those in there.
[00:35:44] Brit Morin: Guys, they're so not pausing on.
[00:35:45] Brit Morin: But you're saying that it's Gemini that takes so long.
[00:35:49] Jessica Lessin: So Gemini can put an ad in there.
[00:35:51] Yeah, but that's why we'll end up happening
[00:35:52] Sam Lessin: is like when people need money,
[00:35:54] Sam Lessin: they'll just slow down the results for more pre-rolls.
[00:35:56] Sam Lessin: You know, and speed them up.
[00:35:57] Sam Lessin: Like that's because you got to,
[00:35:58] Sam Lessin: if you're gonna be a good, especially public tech company,
[00:36:01] Sam Lessin: you need a dial to control how monetization that you can twist.
[00:36:06] Sam Lessin: That's how you can make, you always can make your quarter.
[00:36:08] Sam Lessin: Is it like what we gotta have?
[00:36:09] Sam Lessin: So just slow down the queries 2%,
[00:36:11] Sam Lessin: we'll make all the money back.
[00:36:13] I bet it's a solid eight to 10 seconds of thinking
[00:36:16] Brit Morin: that Gemini does versus ChatGate.
[00:36:18] Brit Morin: But he's two.
[00:36:19] Brit Morin: He's three-plorn-hot-a-babs.
[00:36:20] Sam Lessin: So you can stick right in there.
[00:36:22] Sam Lessin: Guys, the TPUs are melting down.
[00:36:24] Dave Morin: You can feel it.
[00:36:24] Dave Morin: I can feel the TPU meltdown.
[00:36:26] Dave Morin: Like Gemini is working so hard.
[00:36:29] Dave Morin: And like Google, you have to spend more
[00:36:32] Dave Morin: because I need it to go faster.
[00:36:34] Dave Morin: So there's some more data centers.
[00:36:36] Dave Morin: You can afford it.
[00:36:37] Dave Morin: Can we talk more about this code red thing like seriously?
[00:36:40] Sam Lessin: Here's the interesting experience I'd say.
[00:36:42] Sam Lessin: Have you been part of not code reds,
[00:36:44] Sam Lessin: but lockdowns or whatever, the same kind of concept?
[00:36:47] Sam Lessin: Few thoughts.
[00:36:48] Sam Lessin: One, what usually happens is the leader is like,
[00:36:51] Sam Lessin: we must put all the effort into this thing,
[00:36:54] Sam Lessin: shut everything else down.
[00:36:56] Sam Lessin: And then everyone's like, yeah,
[00:36:57] Sam Lessin: but we kind of still do that.
[00:36:59] Sam Lessin: And so you can have five engineers for it.
[00:37:04] Sam Lessin: And the leader's like, no, I need all the engineers.
[00:37:06] Sam Lessin: And like, OK, we'll find you 10 engineers.
[00:37:09] Sam Lessin: Right?
[00:37:09] Sam Lessin: And so this is like this was organizational.
[00:37:11] Sam Lessin: And this is a big problem with being big before you're big,
[00:37:14] Sam Lessin: which is like, if you're small, you can pivot fully
[00:37:17] Sam Lessin: very quickly, like a little sailing ship
[00:37:19] Sam Lessin: you can pivot quickly.
[00:37:20] Sam Lessin: If you have a lot of people and a lot of projects,
[00:37:23] Sam Lessin: you lose your degrees of freedom to pivot very quickly.
[00:37:26] Sam Lessin: And so I do think there's probably this gridlock there.
[00:37:28] Sam Lessin: Now, if you told me that actually Sam Aldman says, go left.
[00:37:32] Sam Lessin: And he means it.
[00:37:34] Sam Lessin: And they don't go left.
[00:37:35] Sam Lessin: That's actually a huge organizational problem.
[00:37:37] Sam Lessin: And like, that's a very negative signal for open AI,
[00:37:39] Sam Lessin: because you need that like ability to pivot.
[00:37:42] Sam Lessin: But I believe it.
[00:37:43] Sam Lessin: It's more what you said.
[00:37:44] Dave Morin: I think it's more what you said.
[00:37:45] Dave Morin: Like everyone gets, everyone gets the memo.
[00:37:48] Dave Morin: And the other work is still continuing.
[00:37:50] Dave Morin: Well, and that's why the other reason to keep in mind
[00:37:52] Sam Lessin: is this is the big problem with having too many initiatives
[00:37:54] Sam Lessin: and product people and hiring fancy people.
[00:37:57] Sam Lessin: Because if you hire a bunch of fancy people,
[00:37:59] Sam Lessin: Joe Pena has done fancy designers, fancy PMs,
[00:38:02] Sam Lessin: the whole kit and caboodle.
[00:38:04] The way you attract them is by being like, good news.
[00:38:07] Sam Lessin: There's infinite surface area and you can do health.
[00:38:10] Sam Lessin: And you can do this.
[00:38:11] Sam Lessin: And you can do that.
[00:38:12] Sam Lessin: They're not actually as fungible as you want them to be
[00:38:15] Sam Lessin: because they're like, they're there to have their mark
[00:38:17] Sam Lessin: on the world, not to just do the thing.
[00:38:20] Sam Lessin: And like that lack of flexibility and reprisation
[00:38:22] Sam Lessin: versus having product generalists and engineering generalists.
[00:38:26] Sam Lessin: You can do everything and you can just pivot them.
[00:38:28] Sam Lessin: It's really like, I think, a major liability.
[00:38:30] Sam Lessin: And when I look at what's happening in OpenAi,
[00:38:31] Sam Lessin: where they have a lot of very fancy people,
[00:38:33] Sam Lessin: people I like, but like the trade is,
[00:38:35] Sam Lessin: and you're going to get your fiefdom,
[00:38:37] Sam Lessin: and you're going to get to do important work you want to do,
[00:38:40] Sam Lessin: you then can't declare code reds
[00:38:42] Sam Lessin: and have them actually be successful, right?
[00:38:44] Sam Lessin: So do you think we should be expecting an exodus
[00:38:46] Brit Morin: and what under what time horizon do you think
[00:38:49] Brit Morin: this code red bull actually take effect?
[00:38:52] Dave Morin: I don't think an exodus.
[00:38:53] Dave Morin: I think the real, and I'm not going to say more than this for now,
[00:38:57] Dave Morin: because I'm in the untrouble.
[00:38:58] Dave Morin: But OpenAi has always had an existential crisis over whether
[00:39:03] Dave Morin: it is a resource organization or a product organization.
[00:39:07] Dave Morin: And you can be both in these tech companies.
[00:39:09] Dave Morin: We talked a lot about tech company culture.
[00:39:11] Dave Morin: We talked about Apple versus Google.
[00:39:13] Dave Morin: And this is the defining challenge, I think,
[00:39:18] Dave Morin: around the defining challenge for them is raising money.
[00:39:21] Dave Morin: But the defining challenge over the identity
[00:39:23] Dave Morin: of the culture of the company.
[00:39:25] Dave Morin: And it kind of gets to the theme we've been talking about too.
[00:39:29] Dave Morin: How much is the messianic model race, the research race,
[00:39:35] Dave Morin: where you should be putting your effort,
[00:39:36] Dave Morin: versus scaling linearly great products
[00:39:40] Dave Morin: that billions of people are going to use?
[00:39:42] Dave Morin: And it is set itself up to have to do both.
[00:39:46] Dave Morin: It is set the expectations that is going to do both.
[00:39:49] Dave Morin: And that is just a hard challenge that rears its head
[00:39:54] Dave Morin: in all sorts of ways, like every single day.
[00:39:56] Dave Morin: And so I think in some ways, the question of this code red,
[00:39:59] Dave Morin: now both chat, LGBT represents both.
[00:40:02] Dave Morin: You need the models and you need the products.
[00:40:04] Dave Morin: But there are a lot of product people there
[00:40:07] Dave Morin: that would say to really do that.
[00:40:10] Dave Morin: You fundamentally have to change the role
[00:40:12] Dave Morin: that the resource organization plays.
[00:40:14] Dave Morin: And a lot of research people who say,
[00:40:16] Dave Morin: if we want to win super intelligence,
[00:40:19] Dave Morin: why do we have products?
[00:40:20] Dave Morin: And I think that's really interesting.
[00:40:22] Dave Morin: Well, and the super intelligence narrative
[00:40:26] Sam Lessin: is what initially got them funding.
[00:40:28] Sam Lessin: And it was the narrative.
[00:40:28] Sam Lessin: Oh, absolutely.
[00:40:30] And I believe it's why all men does it.
[00:40:32] Dave Morin: I believe in his heart of hearts.
[00:40:34] Dave Morin: That's what he and Brockman and others,
[00:40:38] Dave Morin: certainly Ilya, is no longer there.
[00:40:40] Dave Morin: Here's the reality.
[00:40:41] Sam Lessin: If that is true, and I believe it easily could be
[00:40:43] Sam Lessin: that it's a messianic type thing for them.
[00:40:45] Sam Lessin: And that's what they want to be spending time on.
[00:40:47] Sam Lessin: In general, it's extremely hard over the long run
[00:40:51] Sam Lessin: to be successful things you don't care about at every scale.
[00:40:54] Sam Lessin: I just think it's extremely hard to do.
[00:40:56] Sam Lessin: Well, you can hire people who care about them.
[00:40:58] Dave Morin: You can hire people.
[00:41:00] Dave Morin: You can hire people who care about them.
[00:41:01] Dave Morin: I think in founder-led cultures,
[00:41:02] Sam Lessin: or like top-down cultures need to move fast.
[00:41:05] Sam Lessin: The idea that you can be in a business
[00:41:07] Sam Lessin: that you don't fundamentally care about,
[00:41:10] Sam Lessin: I just don't get works out.
[00:41:11] Sam Lessin: And this is a mistake that I think founders make all the time
[00:41:14] Sam Lessin: is they have a good business idea from business school.
[00:41:16] Sam Lessin: But they don't only care about it,
[00:41:18] Sam Lessin: and they can get the energy to do it for two years.
[00:41:20] Sam Lessin: When push comes to shove,
[00:41:21] Sam Lessin: they really rather be doing some prime on it
[00:41:24] Sam Lessin: or some variant of it, and it always fails.
[00:41:25] Sam Lessin: So Sam, in this case, you're saying that the research mission
[00:41:30] Jessica Lessin: is the fun thing and the apps are not.
[00:41:32] Jessica Lessin: I'm saying if that's what Sam believes,
[00:41:34] Sam Lessin: and the leadership actually in their heart of hearts thinks,
[00:41:37] Sam Lessin: they're not going to be a successful product company, right?
[00:41:39] Sam Lessin: Like long term.
[00:41:41] Dave Morin: Well, what if, what if you think one is a means
[00:41:43] Dave Morin: to the end, their end, right?
[00:41:45] Dave Morin: What if you believe?
[00:41:46] Dave Morin: Almost all of these end up this way, right?
[00:41:48] Jessica Lessin: Like early on, early on at Apple,
[00:41:50] Jessica Lessin: you always had to have the people working on the computers
[00:41:52] Jessica Lessin: and the chips and the operating system,
[00:41:54] Jessica Lessin: and then there had to be the applications team, right?
[00:41:57] Jessica Lessin: And it's a unique thing.
[00:41:59] Sam Lessin: It's a unique thing.
[00:42:00] Kind of, but I would argue Steve Jobs,
[00:42:03] Sam Lessin: Steve Jobs, the messianic leader of Apple, right?
[00:42:07] Sam Lessin: Clearly cared about selling a lot of Apple devices.
[00:42:10] Sam Lessin: Like, and he clearly had a set of values,
[00:42:12] Sam Lessin: which you talk about a lot,
[00:42:13] Sam Lessin: which is like what define the company?
[00:42:14] Sam Lessin: Yeah, I mean, he cared about the experience, right?
[00:42:16] Jessica Lessin: So the experience is the products.
[00:42:19] Jessica Lessin: So they got good at it.
[00:42:20] Sam Lessin: And I'm saying, you just, you can't be good.
[00:42:24] Sam Lessin: If you're a leader and you're like,
[00:42:25] Sam Lessin: I really want to be working on the funds,
[00:42:27] Sam Lessin: this thing, which is what I care about,
[00:42:29] Sam Lessin: the Messiah, AGI,
[00:42:32] Sam Lessin: but I have to wake up every day
[00:42:33] Sam Lessin: and spend fucking hours dealing with the chat GPT pre-rolls
[00:42:37] Sam Lessin: to like pay the bills.
[00:42:38] Sam Lessin: You're going to hate that,
[00:42:39] Sam Lessin: and like ultimately you'll fail at it, right?
[00:42:41] Sam Lessin: And like, this is what I've seen in startups,
[00:42:43] Sam Lessin: there are always exceptions, there's always exceptions,
[00:42:46] Sam Lessin: but I think it's like,
[00:42:47] Sam Lessin: it's kind of one of those things where like,
[00:42:48] Sam Lessin: even take like one of those boring companies
[00:42:50] Sam Lessin: in history, Salesforce, okay?
[00:42:53] I didn't know where you're going to go with that, yeah.
[00:42:54] Dave Morin: Well, you're like incredibly boring company.
[00:42:57] Sam Lessin: You're like, how do you motivate
[00:42:58] Sam Lessin: people to work at Salesforce?
[00:43:00] Sam Lessin: Well, one, I think, banding off loves sales.
[00:43:02] Sam Lessin: Like, he loves winning.
[00:43:03] Sam Lessin: It's the Elhanna.
[00:43:04] Sam Lessin: He's just a winning, so we're like,
[00:43:06] Sam Lessin: we can't even care what he's selling.
[00:43:07] Sam Lessin: He's even trying about the product quality.
[00:43:08] Sam Lessin: He just wants to win.
[00:43:09] Sam Lessin: And like, and then for everyone else
[00:43:11] Sam Lessin: who doesn't care enough about winning,
[00:43:12] Sam Lessin: you invent a foundation and like make the foundation
[00:43:15] Sam Lessin: really important in the narrative
[00:43:17] Sam Lessin: so that you feel good about charity
[00:43:18] Sam Lessin: because you can't convince people that this matters, right?
[00:43:21] Sam Lessin: And so like, I just think like,
[00:43:23] Sam Lessin: the founder mentality and then how you tell the story
[00:43:26] Sam Lessin: and motivate like, it really is hard to break away from,
[00:43:28] Sam Lessin: which is why again, like,
[00:43:30] Sam Lessin: if you told me Sam Alman only cares
[00:43:31] Sam Lessin: about beating Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:43:33] Sam Lessin: I'll give it a much higher probability of success,
[00:43:36] Sam Lessin: then if he's like, I care about AGI, right?
[00:43:38] Sam Lessin: It is hard of hard of hearts.
[00:43:40] Sam Lessin: This is one to watch.
[00:43:41] Dave Morin: I'll leave it at that.
[00:43:42] Dave Morin: I think this is gonna be a very big deal.
[00:43:45] Dave Morin: Oh, no guys, we talked about AGI.
[00:43:47] Dave Morin: No, we talked about product,
[00:43:48] Sam Lessin: the team culture and incentive.
[00:43:52] Brit Morin: Well, we'll have line this pod different.
[00:43:53] Brit Morin: Team culture and incentives.
[00:43:55] Sam Lessin: This pod is not about AGI.
[00:43:58] Brit Morin: Oh, that's to be the headline.
[00:44:00] Well, I think it's just called offensive.
[00:44:02] Sam Lessin: Founder incentive.
[00:44:03] Sam Lessin: Let's go talk about crypto.
[00:44:05] Dave Morin: Why did bright arms strong feel the need to say
[00:44:07] Dave Morin: that Bitcoin was not going to zero recently?
[00:44:10] Dave Morin: How bad is it out there?
[00:44:11] Dave Morin: Crypto people.
[00:44:13] Yeah, I didn't see that either.
[00:44:15] I didn't see that either.
[00:44:16] Guys, got it reasonably down.
[00:44:17] Dave Morin: I mean, it's not like getting worse.
[00:44:19] Brit Morin: It's like stabilized bad, right?
[00:44:22] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:44:23] Stabilized number go down.
[00:44:25] Jessica Lessin: We're not dropping off the cliff still.
[00:44:27] Brit Morin: We're just at the bottom of the cliff.
[00:44:28] Brit Morin: You guys, wait, I have such short memory.
[00:44:31] Sam Lessin: Everyone's like, well, I've been through three cycles.
[00:44:33] Sam Lessin: I'm old had at this.
[00:44:34] Sam Lessin: And then like, a little thing happens
[00:44:36] Sam Lessin: if people get stressed.
[00:44:37] Sam Lessin: My favorite non-statement statement today, though,
[00:44:40] Sam Lessin: was definitely from Aaron Levy, who I do truly appreciate
[00:44:45] Sam Lessin: as a human.
[00:44:46] Sam Lessin: And he posts, he's just like the most AIs
[00:44:49] Sam Lessin: changing everything like so excited personality ever.
[00:44:52] Sam Lessin: And he posted this thing being like, AIs, it's a quote.
[00:44:55] Sam Lessin: He's like, not going to take away jobs.
[00:44:56] Sam Lessin: And I'm like, well, what camp are you in here?
[00:44:59] Sam Lessin: And his line, he says, I'm emphatically in the camp
[00:45:03] Sam Lessin: that AIs doesn't take all the jobs.
[00:45:07] Sam Lessin: I'm like, that is the funniest non-statement
[00:45:10] Sam Lessin: I have ever heard.
[00:45:11] Sam Lessin: He's like, OK, you're emphatically in the camp
[00:45:13] Sam Lessin: that some jobs will exist.
[00:45:15] Sam Lessin: That's amazing.
[00:45:16] Brit Morin: What percent of jobs exist?
[00:45:17] Brit Morin: Is it faster?
[00:45:18] Brit Morin: Yeah, he said half.
[00:45:21] Jessica Lessin: My favorite AIMIM was the one I sent to the group chat,
[00:45:25] Jessica Lessin: which is this Waymo that decides to drive straight through
[00:45:28] Jessica Lessin: a shootout or whatever.
[00:45:30] Jessica Lessin: There's like a criminal on the ground.
[00:45:32] Jessica Lessin: And the Waymo just like has no contextual awareness at all
[00:45:35] Jessica Lessin: and just like keeps on driving.
[00:45:36] Jessica Lessin: And the criminal looks up and is like, what the hell?
[00:45:40] So funny.
[00:45:41] Brit Morin: And it had a passenger inside of it too.
[00:45:44] Brit Morin: It had a passenger inside it.
[00:45:45] Brit Morin: Guys, Waymo went on a press tour today,
[00:45:47] Brit Morin: I think in response to this.
[00:45:49] Brit Morin: And also Waymo, I think, killed another pet
[00:45:51] Brit Morin: in San Francisco yesterday.
[00:45:52] Brit Morin: They were on the today's show this morning,
[00:45:54] Brit Morin: opening the day with all their waymo friends.
[00:45:58] Brit Morin: Will AI take all of the pet jobs?
[00:46:03] Oh, God.
[00:46:04] Right?
[00:46:05] Brit Morin: How many robot pets will there be?
[00:46:07] Jessica Lessin: Okay.
[00:46:08] Couple thoughts here.
[00:46:09] Brit Morin: Yeah, the real thing is actually AI will end the grooming business.
[00:46:12] Sam Lessin: Exactly.
[00:46:13] Sam Lessin: That won't be grooming.
[00:46:14] Jessica Lessin: Let's go short grooming.
[00:46:15] Dave Morin: Let's go back to Jess.
[00:46:16] Okay.
[00:46:17] Dave Morin: Waymo is in a press cycle because they released their safety
[00:46:20] Dave Morin: report today, which was stunning in how much safer Waymo's are.
[00:46:24] Dave Morin: When compared, and I quote, to human drivers on the same roads,
[00:46:28] Dave Morin: Waymo's self-driving cars were involved in 91% fewer,
[00:46:33] Dave Morin: serious injury or worse crashes,
[00:46:35] Dave Morin: and 80% fewer causing any injury,
[00:46:39] Dave Morin: 96% lower rate of injury causing crashes at intersections.
[00:46:45] Dave Morin: And this was also in an op-ed written by an emergency room doctor
[00:46:50] Dave Morin: who talks about the nature of her.
[00:46:53] Dave Morin: For what it was, Josh.
[00:46:53] Dave Morin: So does you guys sometimes look around at the humans
[00:46:56] Sam Lessin: that are allowed to drive cars?
[00:46:57] Sam Lessin: And you're just like, I'm shocked you're allowed to drive cars.
[00:46:59] Sam Lessin: Yeah, especially the really old people.
[00:47:01] Brit Morin: Well, that's the same point.
[00:47:02] Brit Morin: And the really young people.
[00:47:04] Sam Lessin: I think this is less about Waymo and more about,
[00:47:06] Sam Lessin: it's just flooring to me that we allow some people to drive cars.
[00:47:10] Sam Lessin: And I like, I mean, God bless America and freedom,
[00:47:13] Sam Lessin: but you're like, I cannot believe that
[00:47:16] Sam Lessin: someone lets you operate a motor vehicle.
[00:47:18] Sam Lessin: The New York Times had a good quote,
[00:47:20] Brit Morin: which was that, while many see this as a tech story,
[00:47:23] Brit Morin: it's actually a public health breakthrough.
[00:47:25] Brit Morin: Like the amount of less hospital visits and deaths
[00:47:29] Brit Morin: is going to be astounding.
[00:47:31] But is that going to be good or bad for that?
[00:47:32] Sam Lessin: You're going to put more pressure on the medical system
[00:47:34] Sam Lessin: because you won't live longer.
[00:47:35] Sam Lessin: Well, that's already happening with AI.
[00:47:37] Dave Morin: Sam, we want to save lives.
[00:47:39] Dave Morin: You have to, you have to align on that to make this work.
[00:47:42] Dave Morin: But I'm excited for this phase in Waymo,
[00:47:44] Dave Morin: two other fun Waymo factoids of the week.
[00:47:47] Dave Morin: They're testing the minivans everywhere.
[00:47:49] Dave Morin: So I've been seeing them out in the peninsula now.
[00:47:51] Dave Morin: I don't know if you guys are seeing them.
[00:47:53] Dave Morin: And then also though, I did see one on the flatbed truck
[00:47:57] Dave Morin: on the 101, which definitely, you know,
[00:48:01] Dave Morin: I'm going through my head, what happened here?
[00:48:04] Dave Morin: Aaron Levy, funny guy said, well,
[00:48:06] Dave Morin: they didn't say how they were going to do freeway driving,
[00:48:08] Dave Morin: which I thought was very funny.
[00:48:09] Dave Morin: And you guys love Aaron Levy so much.
[00:48:11] Dave Morin: Well, we're just a constant conversation with them.
[00:48:14] Brit Morin: You're going to constant, his Twitter is just hilarious.
[00:48:17] Sam Lessin: I'm very pro- Aaron.
[00:48:18] Sam Lessin: You need to make him the fifth wheel on the pod.
[00:48:20] Brit Morin: He should just jump in the mud.
[00:48:21] Brit Morin: He likes to be made fun.
[00:48:23] Brit Morin: He loves the talk.
[00:48:24] Sam Lessin: He loves the talk even more than I do.
[00:48:26] Jessica Lessin: Oh, okay.
[00:48:27] Dave Morin: No, that's not true.
[00:48:28] Dave Morin: Just one interesting factoid to add to your self-driving car
[00:48:33] Jessica Lessin: world.
[00:48:33] Jessica Lessin: This week, I was looking at there's a new interface
[00:48:37] Jessica Lessin: on the Tesla when you click on autopilot
[00:48:40] Jessica Lessin: that tells you the percentage of time
[00:48:42] Jessica Lessin: that the car has been self-driving.
[00:48:45] And I hadn't seen this before.
[00:48:48] Jessica Lessin: And mine is somewhere in the range of 70%,
[00:48:52] Jessica Lessin: which is like actually kind of mind blowing to me.
[00:48:55] Mine's 56% more than half of my drives are so.
[00:48:58] Brit Morin: That's really interesting.
[00:48:59] Jessica Lessin: More than half of your miles driven or drives
[00:49:02] Brit Morin: getting to a miles driven.
[00:49:04] Jessica Lessin: Yeah.
[00:49:05] Like it's getting that good.
[00:49:06] Jessica Lessin: It's at the point now where it can literally start
[00:49:08] Brit Morin: coming out of your driveway.
[00:49:10] Brit Morin: And just like knows how to back up out of your driveway
[00:49:12] Brit Morin: and go.
[00:49:13] Brit Morin: And go into the parking spot.
[00:49:15] Jessica Lessin: Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:49:17] Brit Morin: Jess, I think you're the laggard on this one.
[00:49:19] Brit Morin: You are so afraid of those left turns at intersections
[00:49:22] Brit Morin: that you're not.
[00:49:23] Brit Morin: I am so afraid of the FOIA Tesla buried crash data
[00:49:28] Dave Morin: that my team is half or 10 years.
[00:49:30] Dave Morin: But the new, you can just tell Jess
[00:49:33] Jessica Lessin: like the whatever it is 14.1 and 14.2,
[00:49:36] Jessica Lessin: like they're just so good.
[00:49:38] Jessica Lessin: It's really crazy.
[00:49:39] Jessica Lessin: You can just feel it.
[00:49:40] Jessica Lessin: It's better at driving than you are.
[00:49:42] Jessica Lessin: Not than me.
[00:49:43] Jessica Lessin: You know, Waymo's great at driving.
[00:49:45] Dave Morin: And they're going to be 25% off weekdays
[00:49:48] Dave Morin: around my house, which isn't useful to me at all,
[00:49:51] Dave Morin: but I appreciate it.
[00:49:53] He'll freeze over before I let an AI drive my Miata.
[00:49:56] Sam Lessin: I think that's probably a good thing.
[00:50:00] Sam Lessin: Probably one of the last brands to get autonomous.
[00:50:02] Brit Morin: Autonomies, that's pretty good.
[00:50:04] Brit Morin: Should we do a little holiday party digest here, guys?
[00:50:07] Dave Morin: Tis the season.
[00:50:09] Dave Morin: Tis the season.
[00:50:10] Dave Morin: And there's been some suggestion, Sam,
[00:50:12] Dave Morin: that your etiquette book is missing holiday party etiquette.
[00:50:15] Dave Morin: So maybe we should.
[00:50:16] Dave Morin: You should come, this will air after tonight's
[00:50:20] Sam Lessin: Hunter Perkins edition with a special client
[00:50:22] Sam Lessin: of Brooklyn's edition.
[00:50:23] Dave Morin: You made a special Cliner Perkins edition of your etiquette book.
[00:50:25] Dave Morin: It's awesome.
[00:50:26] Dave Morin: You're going to love it.
[00:50:27] Sam Lessin: Okay.
[00:50:28] Dave Morin: It's the Cliner Perkins holiday party edition.
[00:50:30] Sam Lessin: And it's fabulous.
[00:50:31] Sam Lessin: I'm very excited to give it out to the Cliner Perkins theme tonight.
[00:50:34] Sam Lessin: You are going to get kicked out of the Cliner Perkins holiday party,
[00:50:37] Dave Morin: which is the stodgiest of, I mean, very much fun.
[00:50:40] Dave Morin: Really looking forward to it.
[00:50:41] Dave Morin: Cliner Perkins, we get the dog.
[00:50:43] Dave Morin: No, I'm loving.
[00:50:43] Dave Morin: It's a highlight of my year, but it is the stodgy one.
[00:50:47] Dave Morin: Great sushi.
[00:50:49] Sam Lessin: I hope they have good sushi.
[00:50:50] Sam Lessin: Great sushi.
[00:50:51] Dave Morin: Let's grade the slow holiday party last night.
[00:50:54] Dave Morin: Moreons, what grade would you give it?
[00:50:57] Brit Morin: We were discussing this on our chiroid home.
[00:50:59] Brit Morin: We always enjoy the slow holiday party.
[00:51:02] Brit Morin: What did we say, Dave?
[00:51:03] Brit Morin: It's a bit.
[00:51:03] Brit Morin: There were Hollywood people there.
[00:51:05] Jessica Lessin: I was shocked.
[00:51:07] Jessica Lessin: It's a very diverse crowd.
[00:51:09] Brit Morin: We were impressed by the diversity of hitters
[00:51:12] Brit Morin: as Dave calls them at the party.
[00:51:14] Brit Morin: Hitters from many geographies.
[00:51:16] Jessica Lessin: Is it multi-hitter diversity?
[00:51:18] Jessica Lessin: It was.
[00:51:19] Brit Morin: It was a very, I was like, what brings you here?
[00:51:21] Brit Morin: And they're like, Sam, I'm like, really?
[00:51:23] It was Kevin too.
[00:51:24] Brit Morin: Apparently, just like told some people to show up
[00:51:26] Brit Morin: last minute.
[00:51:27] Brit Morin: So it all worked out.
[00:51:28] Brit Morin: Yeah, Kevin.
[00:51:30] Sam Lessin: Kevin called.
[00:51:30] Sam Lessin: I got in trouble by asking some people
[00:51:32] Brit Morin: if they were coming, you hadn't invited.
[00:51:34] Brit Morin: That was not good.
[00:51:36] Brit Morin: But you know, it's awkward.
[00:51:38] Brit Morin: It's awkward to mention who was there and who wasn't there.
[00:51:41] I will tell you this, because I want
[00:51:42] Sam Lessin: of the people who works at slow is Clay Robbins,
[00:51:45] Sam Lessin: who works so on crypto stuff with me.
[00:51:46] Sam Lessin: And Kevin was making fun of him at the party,
[00:51:49] Sam Lessin: and you didn't come to the last partner meeting.
[00:51:52] Sam Lessin: And Clay was like, yeah, I didn't come to the last partner meeting
[00:51:54] Sam Lessin: because the partner meeting before it,
[00:51:56] Sam Lessin: you spent 45 minutes discussing the cost of the beef.
[00:52:00] That didn't seem worth my time.
[00:52:02] Sam Lessin: And I was like, that is true that Kevin
[00:52:04] Sam Lessin: didn't spend 45 minutes discussing that.
[00:52:06] Sam Lessin: And I know exactly how much the beef cost as well.
[00:52:09] Brit Morin: Wait, the beef and the party are different.
[00:52:11] Brit Morin: Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:12] Brit Morin: Well, and I know you got it like 30% off.
[00:52:14] Brit Morin: No, I know all the things about the beef.
[00:52:16] Brit Morin: Was it a cheap beef?
[00:52:18] No, it's because Justice having an information party.
[00:52:20] Brit Morin: And so you were able to negotiate some deals.
[00:52:22] Brit Morin: I know all the inside inside anyone does.
[00:52:25] Brit Morin: I don't know.
[00:52:26] Brit Morin: I'm nervous.
[00:52:26] Brit Morin: My stomach is churning because I'm like,
[00:52:28] Dave Morin: if we poured it over the budget from this party
[00:52:31] Dave Morin: for it's not an information party, but it's even more exciting
[00:52:34] Dave Morin: than that.
[00:52:35] Dave Morin: I have decided to put the competition aside for one night.
[00:52:40] Dave Morin: And I'm hosting a raucous Bay Area reporter
[00:52:44] Dave Morin: and editor party from all publications.
[00:52:47] Dave Morin: So about 50 plus people coming.
[00:52:49] Dave Morin: So if you want to place this story, come to my house.
[00:52:51] Sam Lessin: How does that work?
[00:52:52] Brit Morin: Are people catty towards each other?
[00:52:54] Brit Morin: But they let's find out.
[00:52:55] Brit Morin: That's my help.
[00:52:56] Brit Morin: Okay.
[00:52:57] Brit Morin: What will it be?
[00:52:58] Brit Morin: I don't know.
[00:52:59] Brit Morin: I'll fly on the wall at this party.
[00:53:01] Brit Morin: Now, what would be great, Jess?
[00:53:02] Sam Lessin: What would make me really happy?
[00:53:05] Sam Lessin: Because I assume that this is unfortunately
[00:53:06] Sam Lessin: post tax dollars for our family is what if we just
[00:53:11] Sam Lessin: send the word?
[00:53:12] Sam Lessin: It's pretend.
[00:53:13] Dave Morin: It's just a business.
[00:53:14] Dave Morin: It's fabulous.
[00:53:15] Dave Morin: That's great.
[00:53:16] Dave Morin: It's not tax dollars.
[00:53:17] Dave Morin: This is my recruiting budget.
[00:53:19] Dave Morin: What are you talking about?
[00:53:20] Dave Morin: I love that.
[00:53:21] Sam Lessin: Great.
[00:53:22] Sam Lessin: Here's the thing.
[00:53:23] Sam Lessin: We can just instead of serving the reporters like new food,
[00:53:27] Sam Lessin: can we just use the leftovers from the last party?
[00:53:30] Dave Morin: No, we are.
[00:53:31] Dave Morin: We're using leftover flowers.
[00:53:33] Dave Morin: We're using leftover cocktail napkins.
[00:53:35] Dave Morin: We're using using leftover bar paraphernalia.
[00:53:40] Brit Morin: But the food will be fresh.
[00:53:41] Brit Morin: I learned about this from Kevin as well.
[00:53:43] Brit Morin: Yeah, all the cost savings.
[00:53:44] Brit Morin: Great.
[00:53:45] Sam Lessin: I appreciate my wife's instincts where she was like,
[00:53:47] Sam Lessin: oh, you're having a holiday party here.
[00:53:49] Sam Lessin: Can you extend the rental by two days
[00:53:51] Sam Lessin: so that I can reuse exactly the same party?
[00:53:53] Sam Lessin: And I was like, I like that.
[00:53:54] Sam Lessin: That's good.
[00:53:55] Sam Lessin: It's financial engineering.
[00:53:56] Brit Morin: Sam and Dave, should we have a GP-only Bay Area holiday
[00:54:01] Brit Morin: party?
[00:54:02] Brit Morin: And no.
[00:54:03] Brit Morin: But only GP's could cost.
[00:54:04] Brit Morin: Interesting.
[00:54:05] Brit Morin: But so no founders, no LPs, no random other people
[00:54:09] Brit Morin: and venture funds.
[00:54:10] Brit Morin: You can do a certain scale.
[00:54:11] Sam Lessin: And you can't just call it.
[00:54:12] Sam Lessin: It needs to be like the problem is that we have to exclude
[00:54:15] Sam Lessin: ourselves.
[00:54:15] Sam Lessin: Of 10 plus what?
[00:54:18] No, why?
[00:54:19] Sam Lessin: Well, we think it's like a real,
[00:54:19] Sam Lessin: because like, he's like a billion dollar GP
[00:54:22] Sam Lessin: fund thing.
[00:54:23] Sam Lessin: Guys, I would GP less than media.
[00:54:25] Brit Morin: That's the problem.
[00:54:27] Sam Lessin: Okay, fund based on fund size.
[00:54:29] Brit Morin: How about fund size or AUM?
[00:54:31] Brit Morin: How do you define a fund?
[00:54:33] Brit Morin: Yeah.
[00:54:33] Brit Morin: How about, I like your idea, Brett.
[00:54:35] Sam Lessin: We take it.
[00:54:36] Sam Lessin: We invite people, but then you have to like,
[00:54:38] Sam Lessin: you get like a badge that's like based on
[00:54:42] Sam Lessin: how much money you manage.
[00:54:43] Sam Lessin: It's just your DPI or your DPI.
[00:54:45] Brit Morin: We P.I.
[00:54:46] Sam Lessin: I love that.
[00:54:47] Brit Morin: A DPI badge.
[00:54:48] Brit Morin: It's either green or red.
[00:54:51] We invite LPs.
[00:54:53] Sam Lessin: It's you've lost money or neutral, you make money.
[00:54:55] Sam Lessin: We put your returns just on a little placard
[00:54:57] Sam Lessin: and you walk around and the GP is like,
[00:54:59] Sam Lessin: Oh, look, it's a five X-er.
[00:55:01] Sam Lessin: Hello, five X-er.
[00:55:03] Sam Lessin: You refer to by your returns.
[00:55:05] Sam Lessin: This reminds me.
[00:55:07] Dave Morin: So I'm going to Davos this year for the first time.
[00:55:11] Dave Morin: I've avoided until now.
[00:55:12] Dave Morin: And apparently each badge has dots and stickers
[00:55:16] Dave Morin: based on your levels.
[00:55:18] Dave Morin: So it just reminded me of that.
[00:55:19] Dave Morin: Which is really just how much you were willing
[00:55:21] Jessica Lessin: to pay to go, right?
[00:55:22] Jessica Lessin: Exactly.
[00:55:23] Dave Morin: Exactly.
[00:55:24] Dave Morin: Which someone was like, get the good lounge access.
[00:55:28] Dave Morin: And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:55:30] Dave Morin: I like this though.
[00:55:31] Brit Morin: The more stickers, it's like it's like GoaWalla
[00:55:34] Brit Morin: or four square.
[00:55:35] Brit Morin: We're like our name tags at the GP party.
[00:55:38] Brit Morin: The more stickers, the more they fleece to you.
[00:55:40] Jessica Lessin: No, at the GP only party.
[00:55:42] Brit Morin: It's just like how many funds you've done,
[00:55:44] Brit Morin: like how much GP I you have.
[00:55:47] Brit Morin: There's just stickers for everything.
[00:55:48] Brit Morin: You need to be like one of noxious concepts.
[00:55:50] Sam Lessin: It can't be like six.
[00:55:51] Sam Lessin: It's just like some brutal.
[00:55:53] Sam Lessin: When we went to Legoland last week,
[00:55:55] Brit Morin: we had these necklaces and the boys got different.
[00:55:58] Brit Morin: Like they're called pop badges that
[00:56:00] Brit Morin: like snapped onto the necklace strap
[00:56:02] Brit Morin: and each one of them meant something different.
[00:56:04] Brit Morin: So you'll have to earn your pop badge.
[00:56:06] Brit Morin: And then it's just whoever has the most flare
[00:56:08] Brit Morin: around their neck with it.
[00:56:09] Brit Morin: I've always thought that the IRS should just give you
[00:56:11] Sam Lessin: some sort of like card, which says
[00:56:14] Sam Lessin: how much you paid in taxes.
[00:56:16] Sam Lessin: And then you can like flash it to get in the fancy clubs.
[00:56:18] Sam Lessin: You know, like you'd be like, look,
[00:56:20] Sam Lessin: because it's like an indirect way
[00:56:22] Sam Lessin: of saying like, fuck you, I'm rich.
[00:56:23] Sam Lessin: So if the IRS gave you something in return
[00:56:25] Sam Lessin: for your taxes rather than just taking them, right?
[00:56:27] Sam Lessin: Like some sort of badge when we entered that.
[00:56:30] Dave Morin: Well guys, we've done, are there any?
[00:56:32] Dave Morin: I'm very excited for the circuit.
[00:56:33] Dave Morin: We got the offline party coming up too.
[00:56:36] Dave Morin: We've got, Brett, you going to the ladies of Silicon Valley?
[00:56:39] Dave Morin: I always try and squeeze in.
[00:56:40] Dave Morin: I love that party.
[00:56:41] Brit Morin: It's just hard to, I've got so many parties.
[00:56:43] Brit Morin: Yeah, please, the offline holiday party
[00:56:46] Brit Morin: is going to be legit though next week.
[00:56:48] Brit Morin: Yeah, we've got too many RCPs.
[00:56:51] Brit Morin: We might have to amp up our beef budget.
[00:56:53] Brit Morin: I assume your party is North Bay.
[00:56:55] Sam Lessin: Yeah, of course.
[00:56:56] Sam Lessin: We drove down to your peninsula world fan.
[00:56:58] Dave Morin: I know, but guys, we're actually going,
[00:57:01] Dave Morin: we're going to Jackson Hole.
[00:57:03] Oh, ready? There's no fee.
[00:57:05] Dave Morin: I know, but we have, we have ski team.
[00:57:06] Dave Morin: There's team.
[00:57:08] We're trying to, gosh.
[00:57:09] Brit Morin: I know.
[00:57:10] Brit Morin: I know.
[00:57:11] Brit Morin: I know.
[00:57:12] Brit Morin: I can't give you a prop for a second.
[00:57:14] Sam Lessin: I was just my mother driving by her house the other day.
[00:57:18] Sam Lessin: She doesn't know we're driving by her house.
[00:57:20] Sam Lessin: She looks out at the trail by her house.
[00:57:21] Sam Lessin: She goes, that is the most beautiful trail.
[00:57:24] Sam Lessin: And I'm like, Mom, that's where the more, that's like literally the more in the house.
[00:57:28] Sam Lessin: And she's like, I love your trail.
[00:57:31] Sam Lessin: Well, I'm going to invite her over for tea.
[00:57:33] Dave Morin: Okay.
[00:57:34] Dave Morin: I'm going to remember my homework.
[00:57:35] Dave Morin: If you are still with us and have not followed or subscribed to this podcast, it is unlikely.
[00:57:41] Dave Morin: But please, please do.
[00:57:42] Dave Morin: Oh, every week I get people telling me that they stayed with us.
[00:57:45] Jessica Lessin: The more important thing that they just say that they don't actually know what's coming.
[00:57:49] Brit Morin: They're on three X.
[00:57:50] Brit Morin: They're on three X speed.
[00:57:52] Here's the thing.
[00:57:53] Sam Lessin: I would love comment on.
[00:57:54] Sam Lessin: Can I ask for comments?
[00:57:56] Sam Lessin: So first, you should buy my book for $9.99.
[00:57:58] Sam Lessin: It's great.
[00:57:59] Dave Morin: Show it again, Sam.
[00:58:00] Dave Morin: You need to do product placement for the viewers.
[00:58:02] Dave Morin: Just spectacular first edition cost $9.99.
[00:58:05] Sam Lessin: It's freaking awesome.
[00:58:06] Sam Lessin: It's got cartoons.
