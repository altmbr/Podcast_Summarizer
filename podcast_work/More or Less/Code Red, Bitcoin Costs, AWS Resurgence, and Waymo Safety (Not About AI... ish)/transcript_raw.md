[00:00:02] SPEAKER_04: Sam Altman wrote that memo
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_04: so people would not know their actual strategy.

[00:01:25] SPEAKER_02: I don't think anyone will ever be Jesse Tish's speech about rats in New York, which was
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_02: one of my favorite social media speeches.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_02: New York police commissioner.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_03: I don't know what this is.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_03: The rats don't run New York.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_02: We do.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_02: It's really one of the great lines of social media politics.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_02: Wait, this was before she was police commissioner, right?
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_04: It was she was sanitation commissioner crushing the rats.

[00:04:03] SPEAKER_02: We've known Daniel Lurie a long time.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_02: And when he was running for mayor, I will admit that I was skeptical.

[00:06:48] SPEAKER_03: I'm joking.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_03: There's a lot more happening.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_03: But we can take that feedback.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_03: Guys, you guys, you're at your first copies of etiquette the book.
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_02: I think he's bored of etiquette by now too.
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_04: So I don't know.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_02: We're number 22 on startup and finance bestseller list Amazon two days in.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_02: Climbing the matrix.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_02: That's a Taylor Swift song.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_03: I'm going to get you a plaque that says number 22.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_04: It's amazing.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_01: Guys, like, but there has been AI news.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_03: Are we not allowed to talk about it?
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_03: I know.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_03: And now I'm afraid to talk about AI.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_03: But it's like, it's code red right now.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_03: I feel like we need to.
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_03: Sam, since when do you listen to feedback?
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_04: Like, I'm so confused.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_04: Like, this is hit you as a.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_04: It's a really good point.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_02: Don't go off brand.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_02: I only listen to feedback when I, it's kind of like a hiring McKinsey,
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_02: where you hire McKinsey to tell you the things you already know,
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_02: but someone else can say them for you.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_02: And so that you can implement them.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_02: Like, I didn't do it, but McKinsey did it.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's one of those situations.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like firing half your team.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_04: Well, okay, a couple of things to discuss.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_04: There has been more AI news.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_04: And we're also into, you know, Gemini, Gemini, Gemini.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_04: And we had some skeptics on the pod last week.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_04: So a lot to happen there.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_04: But I also have to say, you know,
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_04: the major event in the lesson household this week
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_04: has been the arrival of the Garmin watch for children.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_04: And I do actually feel like I need to talk about this a little bit
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_04: because first of all, Sam, would you like to describe
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_04: how our children ended up with Garmin watches?
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_04: I'm very proud of our children.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_02: So our children ended up with Garmin watches
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_02: because like adult Garmin watches?
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, the women's, like, the smallest face
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_02: ones that they've adult full on.
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_02: I actually like their Garmin watches kind of more than mine.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_02: I had set a goal for our oldest
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_02: because he likes goals.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_02: He's a very goal oriented child,
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_02: which is if he ran his age in miles,
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_02: where running means no stopping
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_02: and you can't go slower than a 10 minute mile at any point,
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_02: that if you ran eight miles as an eight year old,
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_02: I would, he could have a Garmin watch.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_02: And so he's had this go outstanding.
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_02: He's almost nine.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_02: He isn't nine yet,
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_02: but he's been kind of eyeing the goal
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_02: and like having good emotions about
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_02: nervousness, about hitting it, not.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_02: Our six year old then, who mind you is awesome,
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_02: but has never run more than five laps.
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_02: So 1.25 miles continuously.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_02: He's finished a 5K with some walking in the middle,
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: but he's six.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_02: He's just never shown interest.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_02: He's like, you know, it was a mile stop.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_02: He's run 1.25 miles.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_02: I go in and like, you know, you're really ready to run too.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_02: And he's like, I can do two.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_02: So we get on the track,
[00:09:16] going into the end of the two miles
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_02: and he goes, Dad, I have a surprise for you.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, Maverick, what the surprise?
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_02: He crosses two miles and goes, Dad, we're running six miles.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_02: I want a Garmin watch.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_02: He'd never mentioned it once.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_02: And so then he's definitely only run a mile in 0.25.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_02: Just bust it out six miles,
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_02: under 10 singing the whole way.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_02: We went through, you know,
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_02: well, a lot of like, what's the demon hunter down track?
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_02: He's just singing a whole way,
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_02: I have power, and he does it,
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_02: which then obviously puts incredible stress
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_02: on the eight year old.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_02: He still hasn't finished eight miles.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_02: So then he does it.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_02: And now my two sons,
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_02: they start, they talk about doom scrolling their watch.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_02: They are doom scrolling their watches.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_04: Guys, okay, Sam, Sam got the preamble,
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_04: which was a little long,
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_04: but this is how we end up.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_04: So now a typical morning is, I come downstairs,
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_04: the boys are running laps.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_04: Say, boys, why are you running laps around the couch?
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_04: Why do I get my steps in?
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_04: Then they'll go, Mom, do you know what time it is
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_04: in the Bahamas?
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_04: I do.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_04: Then my eight year old leaves the kitchen
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_04: to go sit in the living room.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_04: I said, where'd you go?
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_04: He goes, I wanted to meditate to get more meditation points.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_04: And so I'm like, but he goes, but it didn't work.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_04: Very self-worked.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_04: So it's amazing, because here we are,
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_04: like, it's a connected device,
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_04: like we've given our six and eight year olds,
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_04: essentially a computer on their wrist.
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_04: But all I can do is tell us the time in Karachi,
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_04: which Lion put into his watch,
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_04: because they're reading a book about it.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_04: Sunrise, sunset, meditation, but just seeing the obsession.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_04: So I had to say you have to eat breakfast
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_04: and get dressed before you can run in the morning.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_04: And they can't bring them to school,
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_04: because they would just scroll all day.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_04: But it's wild, guys.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_04: And it's just the perfect example of like incentives
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_04: and how kids are like so pliably obsessed.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_03: Well, your kids versus our kids, let's be honest.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_03: Like, I don't think our kids would ever run six or eight miles.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_03: I don't care if we bought them a new house.
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_03: Like they would be like, no, I'm good.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_03: No, but they would find,
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_03: they would find the thing out of this watch
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_04: that they love the most.
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_04: So I need to learn to program.
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_04: I'm gonna divide code a piano practicing app
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_04: that gives you reinforcement
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_04: when your butt has been on the bench
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_04: for a certain number of minutes.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_04: Can I do that?
[00:11:31] This is a great idea, and this is actually pretty easy.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_02: We should make it is continuous keystrokes.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_02: So as long as you're hearing sound at some rate,
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_02: if you practice like 12 hours continuously,
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_02: forget button C.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_02: Well, but you have to pause some times to say the music.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you've got like a 42nd timeout on it.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_02: You know what I mean?
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_02: Like, but you're just like, I wanna hear it continue.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_02: If you need a P, you better get it
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_02: in one of the timeouts, you know?
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_02: Segway, but did you know Duolingo has a piano?
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_03: I put it on my gift guide this year
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_03: that I can send you guys.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_03: It does.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_01: Duolingo made a piano.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_03: The first is a great holiday gift.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, now they're teaching music and language,
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_03: and they actually have physical products.
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_03: You don't have light up keys and you follow the key.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I actually bought an earlier version of this.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I wasn't Duolingo though.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_03: I don't think they're the same.
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_01: I think that Sam, you're talking about the role
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_01: or whatever it was called.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_01: Anyway, I almost got it for my kids,
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_03: but I think it's interesting to see them expanded,
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_03: but we can get into more tech news.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_03: Presumably people don't want to talk about our kids
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_03: all day long.
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_03: So Brent, tell me more about this gift guide,
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_04: because you know, I got to say I felt a little competitive
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_04: because the information has a gift guide,
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_04: and I was like, what is this tech gift guide?
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_04: And then I'm like, oh, it's just Brent.
[00:12:38] I'm not competing with you and every literal media publication
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_03: and influencer that's put out a gift guide this year.
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_03: Well, I'm just doing more social of my own,
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_03: and a lot of people have asked me for what I'm buying
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_03: people for holidays this year.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_03: And I tend to be like trying to find
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_03: the new hottest, coolest tech gadget thing that's not dumb
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_03: for my kids as well as for friends.
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_03: And so I compiled like 10 of them
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_03: that are on my Instagram.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_03: Are they on their now?
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, they are.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I just posted them.
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and yeah, there's everything from the duo Lingo Piano
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_03: to like the robot that I think is one of the best AI robots
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_03: for kids, because there's a lot of them now.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_03: By the way, AI pets in robotics is like a full thing.
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_03: There's an vacuum cleaner.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_03: I think that one was on your gift guide too, Jess.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_03: Thematic.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_03: Oh, I love that.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_02: Could it be some sort of like you get a score for a cool
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_02: meaning like I want to like I want to cleanings
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_02: like continuous vacuuming for 12 hours.
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_02: You get a star.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_03: And mapping it to no, that well, the robot does it.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_03: It can mop and you're talking about thematic.
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, thematic.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the magic.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_03: So cool.
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_03: And it recharges itself.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_03: You don't have to do anything.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_03: And that one's really cool.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so there's a lot of these up on Instagram.com slash Brit.
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_03: Well, so this is actually a non AI topic that I wanted to bring up
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_04: because on this pod, perhaps we're all creators,
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_04: perhaps we're all influencers.
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_04: But I'd say Sam and Brit are really leaning into it
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_04: in this moment, right?
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_04: I had a tweet.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_04: I made money on tweets.
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_02: So I've noticed two things.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_04: I've noticed Sam turning on Twitter monetization for his content.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_04: And I've noticed some very fun, very peppy, very well branded Brit
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_04: social videos.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_04: So you two discuss, what are your ambitions as in your next step
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_04: in the creator economy?
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_03: Oh, I'll discuss.
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_03: Well, I think that in venture capital, there's just so much going
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_03: on and everyone's flooded with everything.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_03: The best way to draw the founders in and the ideas
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_03: in that you care about is to tell people what you care about.
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_03: And our pod is one way of doing that.
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_03: But on the broader enter webs, I think it's important
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_03: to share the things that I care about and that I think are cool.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_03: And hopefully, people know someone that might be starting something
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_03: in that category or otherwise want to connect with me on that.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_03: So that's my motivation just to tell people what I'm into.
[00:15:02] I love it.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_04: I give us some, like, is it working?
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_03: Like what early days?
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_03: Like, what do you, how's it working for you?
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_03: To be a brand these days, and then I'm going to go like real macro.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_03: First of all, I called this 15 years ago.
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_03: Like creators are brands.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_03: Obviously slow believes this too.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_03: Well, you sound like me too.
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_03: I called it years ago.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_03: But I call this Britain Co.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_03: And I put my name in the brand.
[00:15:23] Look that cookie.
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_03: Creator people are brands.
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_03: And to get the share of any voice and to be top of mind for anyone,
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_03: you have to make content and have media on the web.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_03: And so you have to then decide what you care about and what kind of people
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_03: you want to draw towards you.
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_03: And that's how it's working.
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_03: So yeah, I've gotten a lot of people like sending me more deals,
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_03: people DMing me, sort of pressure testing my thesis on different topics.
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_03: But there's more to come.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_03: So stay tuned.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_03: I'm going to be lighting up my LinkedIn and other channels soon.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_03: And you know what else is weird?
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_03: I also am lighting up TikTok.
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_03: And TikTok's a whole different planet.
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_03: I've discovered, you've got to be very basic there, not as deep.
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_03: So I got to go up a level in terms of what's happening in tech.
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_02: I love the screenshot essay a long time.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_02: I've done a lot of deals off screenshot essays.
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_02: Because you put out your thesis into the universe.
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_02: And then if you make it a punchy headlines,
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_02: people get mad, but then say something reasonable in the screenshot
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_02: that most people don't read, it gets packaged and sent all over the place.
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_02: And then smarter people will give you better ideas
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_02: and send you company.
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_02: So I've done like, probably like a dozen investments.
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_02: Where like I put out something nuts, or maybe the eye only is nuts,
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_02: but some people do.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_02: And then you better stuff that everything in area two farms,
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_02: which we seeded was from a screen shot essay.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_02: I just did this deal where I guess remember my petty lawsuit thesis, right?
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_02: Where like it.
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_02: So I literally, I was like, someone needs to start petty lawsuit,
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_02: but some guy started it.
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_02: And so I funded petty lawsuit.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_02: Then and so like there's also, I do, for me,
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_02: it's very professional that way.
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_02: Now I will say what's changed for me is I do quite enjoy Twitter,
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_02: the outrage game TM.
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_02: It's like pretty fun.
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_02: And so for me, I've been doing like the Twitter for deal sourcing
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_02: and Definder tribe and to intentionally reject the other tribe
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_02: so that you don't have to listen to them because it's noise for a long time.
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_02: And I think that's been actually can't really how I source
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_02: because I'm lazy for like years.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_02: But now I'm like into the Twitter the outrage game,
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_02: where I'm getting pretty good at posting things,
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_02: which are like, I'm pretty sure can go hyper viral.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_02: So I'll give you an example.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_02: Last week I posted this thing about how like you can't compound your way to wealth anymore,
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_02: which wild is like four million views looking at like 20,000 likes.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_02: And like the reason that works is because some people really like it
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_02: and agree with it.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_02: And then a lot of people don't.
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_02: And you need them to argue with each other, right?
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_02: So it's kind of like draw like and that is a fun game.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_02: I turned on monetization because I'm like, wait a minute,
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_02: I can get it paid for this too.
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_02: And like as a creator, I should have paid.
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_02: So what trickle of income has come in?
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_04: Give us the monetization report.
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_04: I'm going to pay for that heat in your house, Sam.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_04: Well, exactly.
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_02: We got to turn the heat back on.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_02: I'm big move down.
[00:18:09] I know it's like I know that but I have thousands of dollars
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_02: of unclean subscription rewards that I need to like collect.
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_02: But now I'm not sure.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_02: I don't know much on when it paid.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_02: I have a lot of validated followers.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_02: And I think I might get literally hundreds of dollars
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_02: when I get my first pay out because I finally turned it on.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_02: Although I still can't figure out a connect of bank account.
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_02: So I don't actually know how to collect the money.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: I keep getting my bank accounts
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_02: keep saying I can't.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_02: This is my problem.
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_04: I have sweet venture capital returns stuck in angel list.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_04: I actually don't I actually think I have
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_02: stuck in angel list is is outline ventures distribution.
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_02: I can't get out.
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_02: Did you guys you guys used angel lists?
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_02: Even offline ventures or outline ventures.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_03: I'm sorry, that's what I meant.
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:18:51] Like yeah, we've had some distributions.
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_03: We have another one coming for you.
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_03: I can't get them.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_02: Can you send me a check?
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_02: You're paying your investors money.
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_03: That's amazing.
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_03: Well, we are paying our investors money.
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_03: When we first started offline,
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_03: we did it through a rolling fund while the pandemic was kicking off
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_03: because that was like a weird time and turns out now all
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_03: those investments, a lot of them are selling.
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_03: And it's a rolling funds like it's a money.
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_02: You get rolling you get money,
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_03: but you need to go log in and get it.
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_03: The VCs will love this.
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_02: I can't get it because I can't log in.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_02: Or VCs will love it.
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_02: I was with Kevin Collar yesterday.
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_02: You just pushed the forgot password button, Sam.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_02: No, I can get in.
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_02: I can't get the money.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_02: I don't know what's going on.
[00:19:28] You have to prove that you're like a legit entity.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_04: Like I had to assert all these things.
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_04: But I thought we're true, but.
[00:19:35] I don't know.
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_02: You guys are longer.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_02: The dreaded assertion.
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_02: So I don't like being in the office with people,
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_02: as you might have noticed.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_02: But I do get a reminder, everyone's in the way,
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_02: that you are missing something
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_02: you're not being in the office.
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_02: Because we had Kevin Collar in my business partner days,
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_02: four of his business partners over the yesterday.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_02: Kevin's created a lot of things.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_02: It's great raising money.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_02: He created a lot of things.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_02: He's got great one liners.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_02: And because I'm not in person with him,
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_02: I don't get them.
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_02: And so we had a situation where you'll appreciate Dave.
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_02: No one liners over Zoom.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_02: They're not in the same punch.
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_02: And he had this incredible one liner
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_02: where we got this notice that we're unlocked
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_02: on some stock that we can sell.
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_02: And it's one of these things where like,
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_02: we didn't even buy equity in this company.
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_02: We bought equity in something else.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_02: They got rolled over six times and bought.
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_02: And like, whatever, we said,
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_02: and we made it turns out like three times our investment,
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_02: like 20 years later on this.
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_02: Just from holding.
[00:20:29] Holding and letting it roll over six times.
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_02: No, that one's better than that.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_02: But like Kevin goes, Kevin goes,
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_02: to doctin.
[00:20:38] That's what they pay us for.
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_02: Another investment returner.
[00:20:44] The goal of the capital is to have,
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_02: not for you, not only say it's a fund returner.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_02: It's like, we had an investment returner.
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_02: It's so good.
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_02: Did you guys see our friend Adam Assyria's ordering
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_03: all Instagram employees back to office five days a week
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_03: as of February?
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_03: Whatever I say now will appear in my next all hands.
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_04: And so I will be quiet.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_02: My reaction to that when I saw it was at one,
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_02: now I understand why he declined my invite
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_02: to go hell is skiing in the spring.
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_02: The reason I wouldn't do that is because then I would have to do it.
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_02: So like I can order everyone out,
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_02: but I don't, he's too much of a good leader
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_02: to just make his people do it and then not do it himself.
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_02: That's true.
[00:21:24] That's funny.
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_03: Good on you Adam.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_02: I mean, maybe Adam, you're gonna like,
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_02: but we gotta put like a cold plunging your office now.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_02: Like how, like you can't go,
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_02: you know the office five days a week?
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_04: And this is on the road four days a week.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_04: So I think that the office five days a week
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_01: or is that will Instagram be the only division?
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_01: I think there'll be the only division.
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_01: But they need it.
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_01: That's like the economic engine.
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_02: They need to make, they need to pump more money.
[00:21:49] Guys, did you see the other meta news?
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_03: Just did you see this about Alan Dye?
[00:21:53] Yes, Britt, tell the people, big news.
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_03: This is big deal.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_03: Alan Dye, Apple's design lead is leaving the company
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_03: and joining meta.
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_03: Interface design lead.
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_01: I was gonna say wait for Dave to correct him.
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_03: Wait for Dave to correct him.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_03: As chief design officer on December 31st,
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_03: Annie's gonna report to Buzz, who we know,
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_03: the CTO of meta.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_03: I like how you thought that was the most interesting part of the office.
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_04: Well, I just like that, that I was in one headline.
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_03: And I think that this is a big deal
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_03: because as we've been talking about with AI
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_03: and all the big tech companies,
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_03: like there have been pros and cons about what Apple's up to
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_03: and like how their momentum is going
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_03: and this is just like a really interesting signal.
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_03: What signal do you believe that sends?
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_02: That's up paid a shitload A.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_03: And like he's chief design officer.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_03: So that's everything, right?
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_03: At meta.
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_03: Is that across all meta products?
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_03: I don't know meta's or chart.
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_03: He might have to go into the office five days a week.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_03: I know.
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_03: What is he signing up for?
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_03: You think he's signing?
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_02: He's like, oh shit, forget it.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_02: Five days a week, then forget it.
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_02: My understanding is that Alan was the,
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_01: he was the lead on liquid glass
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_01: and the big interface update that just happened,
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_01: which is a lot related to AR interface.
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_01: And so the reporting to BAS,
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_01: I would bet, you know, working on the meta glasses,
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_01: I think that's the strategic move here
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_01: that he's got real sort of chops.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_01: He also was the lead on Vision Pro
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_01: and that whole Vision OS design project,
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_01: if I remember correctly.
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_01: And so it's kind of a big coup from that perspective
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_01: that whole design stream is going over to meta.
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_01: Or it could just be that liquid glass
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_02: is super fucking annoying and hard to implement.
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_02: So they need to hire him to implement liquid glass.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_02: Fair enough.
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_02: At meta.
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_02: At meta.
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_02: Because they're gonna be forced to.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_02: And they're just like, this is too hard.
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_02: We need to get the guy who made it.
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_02: The guy who made it.
[00:23:57] Couple interesting things.
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_04: So Mark Garmin at Bloomberg had the scoop
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_04: and Tim actually had a statement on it,
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_04: which I thought was highly unusual
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_04: and is a sign of what a big gloss it was for them.
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_04: Pretty high profile.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, no.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_04: I mean, no one's arguing it's not high profile,
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_04: but Tim had a banal statement
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_04: defending the bench of design talent they had in Apple,
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_04: which is not as bad as Jensen saying their GPUs
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_04: were better than Google's TPUs in a comms tweet from Nvidia.
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_04: But, you know, could perhaps be considered
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_04: in the same family.
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_04: So I've been playing with the theory, guys,
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_04: that I'm gonna reveal as part of my predictions
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_04: to our pro subscribers,
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_04: I don't know this week, where?
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_04: K-Me mother fucker.
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_01: I am going, I have decided.
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_04: Wait, let's pro or the information pro?
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_01: The information pro.
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_04: You know, like when people meet with me,
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_04: they seem to think I have a lot of opinions
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_04: that are mildly useful to them.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_04: We should start to only fans together.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_02: And they're surprised.
[00:24:59] Like I could be like, you know,
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_04: some things I have to hold back on,
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_04: some things I don't.
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_04: And I have, I think there's 27 going,
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_04: and 29, pretty specific,
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_04: some are wild, some are calling out individual companies,
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_04: people, whole thing.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_04: And I'm just gonna let it flow
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_04: for information pro subscribers.
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_04: But.
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_04: Just, can I tell you one thing?
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_02: There is a better business model to this,
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_02: what you want to do,
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_02: which is called running a hedge fund.
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_02: I don't know if you can consider it.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_02: No, no, I just, you know.
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_02: You want to get a heat turn back on in our house.
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_02: Maybe you could run a hedge fund,
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_02: instead of just giving it to the pro subscribers
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_02: or two little.
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_04: You know, I was born with different DNA
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_04: and in another life, man, in another life.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_04: Maybe if we run out of all the money,
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_02: you know, we can totally start a hedge fund.
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_02: You know, if we really need the fuel,
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_04: I would trade, I mean, I will not trade against these,
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_04: but I have a lot of conviction around these.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_04: There's a lot that's on the cutting room floor.
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_04: You have to really pay for that.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_04: You're like, you're supposed to say,
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_02: this is not financial,
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_02: like not I would definitely trade these.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_02: I need a snake meat.
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_04: So I will give more next week,
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_04: but I feel very, very confident about
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_04: for it to protect my pro community, who my love.
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_04: But one theme, this isn't like a prediction,
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_04: but this is one framework for my predictions.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_04: And you guys tell me what you think.
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_04: I'm still workshopping it.
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_04: So I think that like maybe the last 18 months,
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_04: AI has kind of like lifted
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_04: and all these tech companies in like the similar wave,
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_04: similar hype, similar fortunes.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_04: It's like run up a lot of momentum,
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_04: investor sentiment, blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_04: I think next year, the fortunes are going to start
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_04: to diverge very dramatically.
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_04: And that the sort of era of like the AI tailwind
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_04: for big tech startups,
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_04: I think we're still going to see huge winners,
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_04: but I think just across the board,
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_04: the fortunes are going to diverge very dramatically.
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_04: And so that is one thing I just,
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_04: I think about when I think of Apple and Meta,
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_04: not because I have high confidence,
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_04: which way either of them are going,
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_04: but we've wanted to like,
[00:26:58] and the press has played a part in this,
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_04: the so of the companies and sort of like showing
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_04: all the areas and all the battles that are head to head
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_04: to make them look like they're all in this even footing.
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_04: And I think the results and the investments
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_04: and the strategies will start to diverge a lot more
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_04: and that will leave some people,
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_04: I think the tide will go out for some people
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_04: and the tide will keep rising for others.
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_04: So what's your trade advice then?
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_02: Is it like short, a QQ, longer favorites?
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_02: Like what's the play?
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_02: Well, I don't really want to tell people what to do,
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_04: but I'm going to read the information they'll know.
[00:27:32] Last pod, the chart that we showed
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_01: of the OpenAI complex versus the Google complex
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_01: is the most obvious one.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_01: I think Meta's lack of an enterprise business
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_04: is going to be much more of a liability for it.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_04: Oh, interesting.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_02: Really? Why?
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_02: They just make all the money on ads.
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_02: No, but I think for its CAPEX strategy, I think,
[00:27:49] SPEAKER_04: interesting.
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_04: I think this is already happening.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_04: Investors are not giving in.
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_04: They don't have a cloud business
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_01: or what type of business.
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_01: They don't sell, well, they don't sell stuff to businesses.
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_04: They don't sell software.
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_04: They don't sell compute.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_04: They don't sell chips.
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_04: They don't sell anything.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_04: Like Google workspace.
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_04: No, I know, but there are several, you know,
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_01: there's like Amazon AWS, like as a big cloud business
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_01: as is Google Cloud, right?
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_01: And so I'm just wondering which one or you're just
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_01: just sort of saying any.
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, all dimensions, right?
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_01: Any and all.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_04: No, so I think that's one example.
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_04: I was just saying in terms of interesting anecdotes of the day,
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_02: I actually got really interesting inbound
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_02: from Amazon Web Services this week, which is interesting,
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_02: because here's the thing, which was, you know,
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_02: I've had been...
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_02: It's their big Vegas conference reinvents him.
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_04: No, here's like, I've had, like, I, for hilarious reasons,
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_02: was on the original Amazon Web Services customer device
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_02: re-board when I was like in my mid 20s and I was 26.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_02: I don't know how I ended up in this room.
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_02: I was so outclassed.
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_02: It was like me and like the CTO of like every major company.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_02: And I barely ever stayed there talking.
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_02: That was the drop-y-o days.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_04: That was so fun.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I spent a lot of, yes.
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_02: And I was a kid and start-ups.
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_02: It was really interesting.
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_02: I got a cool jacket from the first time that was convened.
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_02: But I haven't heard from Amazon as like a company reaching out
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_02: from the VC startup ecosystem in a long time.
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_02: And they're calling me like, they're like, let's do business.
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_02: We have them.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_03: Oh, we have credits for them.
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_03: Of course, we got six funds.
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_02: We want to do business.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_02: We want to, like, tell us what you need.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_02: This is our initiative.
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_02: I was like, huh, you guys want to get back in this cloud game,
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_02: eh?
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_02: That's not a bad thing.
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_02: I was just surprised.
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_04: This cloud game, they had like blue expectations
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_04: on their last quarter.
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_04: Like, they're in the cloud game.
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_04: It's interesting, when I thought you were
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_02: point about there could be people, the big clouds
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_02: are being a little bit more like wanting
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_02: to drum up some business than they have historically.
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_02: Well, what's happening in AWS, which is really important,
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_04: actually, is, you know, the whole narrative has been,
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_04: they've been on their back foot in AI, which is not untrue.
[00:29:48] Same good one, narrative.
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_02: The big play was to invest in Anthropic.
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_04: And then they have bedrock platform for accessing many models.
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_04: But like the open AI's and Google's and Microsoft's
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_04: of the world, what is you to think they were in the dark ages?
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_04: Then last quarter, AWS, like crushed it.
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_04: And investors and reporters were like, huh.
[00:30:10] So it turns out that a, this has been lifting all boats,
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_04: right?
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_04: Like that the demand for compute is also pulling people
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_04: into the cloud.
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_04: Like AI is also getting even more of the laggards
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_04: who are still on prem to the cloud, right?
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_04: And AWS is also really good for AI workloads and all,
[00:30:28] SPEAKER_04: you know, all this stuff.
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_04: And they revealed, I don't remember the details,
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_04: but like huge infrastructure investments.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_04: This is the time then, like if you announce
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_04: a big infrastructure investment, you're stock went up
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_04: because people saw that you wanted to be players
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_04: and all that kind of stuff.
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_04: So who knows what the future will bring?
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_04: There's certainly challenges for AWS.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_04: But it's like, you know, they're in the game.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_04: They've never left the game.
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_04: It's just Google is growing, really,
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_04: Google Cloud is growing really fast too.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_04: But, you know, they're multiples bigger.
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_04: So it's a, and now they'll have Sam's business.
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_04: But sure, I mean, I do business.
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_02: You should have to reinvent.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_04: I was talking a lot of people who were reinvented.
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_04: Well, I mean, I'm reporting there.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_04: Is it the Amazon thing?
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, the AWS thing.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_04: I thought it was interesting.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_04: I noticed that they have these Nova AI models.
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_01: I hadn't actually heard of what their models were called.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and I and Nova, we're going to use all of this thing.
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_01: I don't think people love Nova,
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_04: but people like the new agent stuff, although,
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_04: I had never even heard of it until yesterday.
[00:31:29] Do you guys know agents that's not looking so good
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_04: for the agents?
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_03: Have you heard?
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_03: Really?
[00:31:33] SPEAKER_01: What's happening with the agents?
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_01: Well, the agents are also getting paused by open AI
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_03: for the next year.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: Hollywood agents during this, during this code red,
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_03: during code red, no commerce coming soon,
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_03: no agents coming soon, no ads coming soon.
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_03: Guys, I really, I'm going to confess something
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_04: and be very vulnerable on the pod.
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_04: I kind of think there's a 50% chance
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_04: Sam Altman wrote that memo
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_04: so people would not know their actual strategy.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_04: I mean, the memo is authentic.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_04: Like the memo is authentic.
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_04: That's fake strategy.
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_04: It's like, surprise, it's all agents and commerce.
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_02: We tricked you.
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_02: Code red is actually only about commerce.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_02: Maybe 49%.
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_04: I mean, Steph Palazolo and Aaron Wu
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_04: to fabulous information reporters reported late one night
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_04: that in response to growth in Gemini
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_04: and trends at Chattity B.T. Altman called a code red.
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_04: To Ritz Point, he said they were going to deemphasize ads
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_04: and agents and really work on the model
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_04: and the product and all this stuff.
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_04: And what was interesting about this too
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_04: is you guys remember a couple of weeks ago
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_04: when everyone had a lot of the industry had their hands
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_04: on Gemini and the reviews were very positive,
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_04: but it wasn't out yet.
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_04: Altman wrote another memo reported by the information
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_04: that said, stay the course.
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_04: It's going to be tough vibes, but heads down, stay the course.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_04: So you have this big reversal.
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_04: So, okay, we've all written memos
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_04: to our companies over the years, right?
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_04: You're trying to signal something.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_04: You're trying to show you're not being complacent.
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_04: Reporting shows that work on agents and ads continues,
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_04: not surprisingly.
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_04: But yeah, there is this big rallying cry around Chattity B.T.
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_04: And then I saw some great charts today
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_04: and Dave's always trying to keep me honest
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_04: and asked for the chart.
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_04: And then I give him the chart
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_04: and then he tells me why the chart,
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_04: what the chart is missing.
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_04: Is it a chart that's missing?
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_04: No, I give him an FT chart
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_04: and he's like ripping into the FT chart.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_04: Oh, I can't, I can't affect their X and Y axis.
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_03: We're investors.
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_03: We critique charts and slides.
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_03: Jess, that's like what we do for a living.
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_03: All I said, Jess, is I want to see Instagram
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_01: time spent on the same chart.
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but anyway, the flat light,
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_04: like the time spent,
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_04: and remember Chattity B.T. thinks it's metta,
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_04: so time spent matters.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_04: It's down, 7%, 6% I don't know.
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_04: And what time period?
[00:33:55] And what time period?
[00:33:57] And like, this is when the kids are writing their papers
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_02: and it's still down.
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_02: But do you know why Google's time spent is up?
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_03: Because it takes Google two to three acts as long.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_03: It asks so many follow-up questions.
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_03: Yes, yes.
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_03: No, it takes two to three Xs long to get me an answer.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_03: And I'm sitting there waiting, whereas G.P.T. is much more quick.
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_01: Is that actually true?
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_01: Two to three X?
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_01: Yes, totally true.
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_03: As of last week on the pod,
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_03: I told everyone here that I was going to now make
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_03: Jim and I my main LLM.
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_03: I exported all my Chattity B.T. memory
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_03: and tried to upload it into Jim and I,
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_03: turns out you can upload 10 files at once.
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_03: And I have thousands of files in my G.P.T. memory
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_03: and I was like, fuck this.
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_03: And I just did it.
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_03: I like uploaded 30.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_03: Do you have to be combining it to one file for you?
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_02: It wouldn't do it because it has all these images
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_03: and all these things.
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_03: That's how you get around GDPR down
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_02: on your data restrictions.
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_02: Look, here's a few things.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_02: Hold on, hold on.
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_02: I'm not done yet.
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_03: I just need to finish.
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_03: So I start using Jim and I exclusively.
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_03: And it's like giving me good answers,
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_03: but it's taking so long.
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_03: I don't have time to wait for this shit.
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_03: And you know what else I like about G.P.T.?
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_03: Especially on mobile is the haptic feedback.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_03: Like the little, do you guys have a turn on
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_03: where it makes a little vibration?
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_03: Well, that's not profitable.
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm just saying, it's quick.
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_03: That's the differentiator feedback.
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_02: It's haptic.
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_03: I feel like I'm talking to this thing in real time
[00:35:20] SPEAKER_03: and so now I'm back to G.P.T.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_03: So I've done the full boomerang.
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_02: A few thoughts.
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_02: One, I do like your point that time spent
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_02: has a lot to do with waiting for answers
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_02: but you also suggest the solution
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_02: in 2026 to everyone's problems.
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_02: Pre-Rolls.
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_02: You know, if you just like throw a pre-roll video ad
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_02: while coming up with your answer, boom,
[00:35:38] SPEAKER_02: there's the monetization.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_02: They're pausing ads.
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_03: Says Sam Altman.
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_03: He just jammed those in there.
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_03: Guys, they're so not pausing on.
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_03: But you're saying that it's Gemini that takes so long.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_01: So Gemini can put an ad in there.
[00:35:51] Yeah, but that's why we'll end up happening
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_02: is like when people need money,
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_02: they'll just slow down the results for more pre-rolls.
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_02: You know, and speed them up.
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_02: Like that's because you got to,
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_02: if you're gonna be a good, especially public tech company,
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_02: you need a dial to control how monetization that you can twist.
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_02: That's how you can make, you always can make your quarter.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_02: Is it like what we gotta have?
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_02: So just slow down the queries 2%,
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_02: we'll make all the money back.
[00:36:13] I bet it's a solid eight to 10 seconds of thinking
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_03: that Gemini does versus ChatGate.
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_03: But he's two.
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_03: He's three-plorn-hot-a-babs.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_02: So you can stick right in there.
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_02: Guys, the TPUs are melting down.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_04: You can feel it.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_04: I can feel the TPU meltdown.
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_04: Like Gemini is working so hard.
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_04: And like Google, you have to spend more
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_04: because I need it to go faster.
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_04: So there's some more data centers.
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_04: You can afford it.
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_04: Can we talk more about this code red thing like seriously?
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_02: Here's the interesting experience I'd say.
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_02: Have you been part of not code reds,
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_02: but lockdowns or whatever, the same kind of concept?
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_02: Few thoughts.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_02: One, what usually happens is the leader is like,
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_02: we must put all the effort into this thing,
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_02: shut everything else down.
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_02: And then everyone's like, yeah,
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_02: but we kind of still do that.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_02: And so you can have five engineers for it.
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_02: And the leader's like, no, I need all the engineers.
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_02: And like, OK, we'll find you 10 engineers.
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_02: And so this is like this was organizational.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_02: And this is a big problem with being big before you're big,
[00:37:14] SPEAKER_02: which is like, if you're small, you can pivot fully
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_02: very quickly, like a little sailing ship
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_02: you can pivot quickly.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_02: If you have a lot of people and a lot of projects,
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_02: you lose your degrees of freedom to pivot very quickly.
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_02: And so I do think there's probably this gridlock there.
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_02: Now, if you told me that actually Sam Aldman says, go left.
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_02: And he means it.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_02: And they don't go left.
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_02: That's actually a huge organizational problem.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_02: And like, that's a very negative signal for open AI,
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_02: because you need that like ability to pivot.
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_02: But I believe it.
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_02: It's more what you said.
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_04: I think it's more what you said.
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_04: Like everyone gets, everyone gets the memo.
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_04: And the other work is still continuing.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_04: Well, and that's why the other reason to keep in mind
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_02: is this is the big problem with having too many initiatives
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_02: and product people and hiring fancy people.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_02: Because if you hire a bunch of fancy people,
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_02: Joe Pena has done fancy designers, fancy PMs,
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_02: the whole kit and caboodle.
[00:38:04] The way you attract them is by being like, good news.
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_02: There's infinite surface area and you can do health.
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_02: And you can do this.
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_02: And you can do that.
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_02: They're not actually as fungible as you want them to be
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_02: because they're like, they're there to have their mark
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_02: on the world, not to just do the thing.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_02: And like that lack of flexibility and reprisation
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_02: versus having product generalists and engineering generalists.
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_02: You can do everything and you can just pivot them.
[00:38:28] SPEAKER_02: It's really like, I think, a major liability.
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_02: And when I look at what's happening in OpenAi,
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_02: where they have a lot of very fancy people,
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_02: people I like, but like the trade is,
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_02: and you're going to get your fiefdom,
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_02: and you're going to get to do important work you want to do,
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_02: you then can't declare code reds
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_02: and have them actually be successful, right?
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_02: So do you think we should be expecting an exodus
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_03: and what under what time horizon do you think
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_03: this code red bull actually take effect?
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_04: I don't think an exodus.
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_04: I think the real, and I'm not going to say more than this for now,
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_04: because I'm in the untrouble.
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_04: But OpenAi has always had an existential crisis over whether
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_04: it is a resource organization or a product organization.
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_04: And you can be both in these tech companies.
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_04: We talked a lot about tech company culture.
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_04: We talked about Apple versus Google.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_04: And this is the defining challenge, I think,
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_04: around the defining challenge for them is raising money.
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_04: But the defining challenge over the identity
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_04: of the culture of the company.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_04: And it kind of gets to the theme we've been talking about too.
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_04: How much is the messianic model race, the research race,
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_04: where you should be putting your effort,
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_04: versus scaling linearly great products
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_04: that billions of people are going to use?
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_04: And it is set itself up to have to do both.
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_04: It is set the expectations that is going to do both.
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_04: And that is just a hard challenge that rears its head
[00:39:54] SPEAKER_04: in all sorts of ways, like every single day.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_04: And so I think in some ways, the question of this code red,
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_04: now both chat, LGBT represents both.
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_04: You need the models and you need the products.
[00:40:04] SPEAKER_04: But there are a lot of product people there
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_04: that would say to really do that.
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_04: You fundamentally have to change the role
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_04: that the resource organization plays.
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_04: And a lot of research people who say,
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_04: if we want to win super intelligence,
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_04: why do we have products?
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_04: And I think that's really interesting.
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_04: Well, and the super intelligence narrative
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_02: is what initially got them funding.
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_02: And it was the narrative.
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_02: Oh, absolutely.
[00:40:30] And I believe it's why all men does it.
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_04: I believe in his heart of hearts.
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_04: That's what he and Brockman and others,
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_04: certainly Ilya, is no longer there.
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_04: Here's the reality.
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_02: If that is true, and I believe it easily could be
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_02: that it's a messianic type thing for them.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_02: And that's what they want to be spending time on.
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_02: In general, it's extremely hard over the long run
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_02: to be successful things you don't care about at every scale.
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_02: I just think it's extremely hard to do.
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_02: Well, you can hire people who care about them.
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_04: You can hire people.
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_04: You can hire people who care about them.
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_04: I think in founder-led cultures,
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_02: or like top-down cultures need to move fast.
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_02: The idea that you can be in a business
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_02: that you don't fundamentally care about,
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_02: I just don't get works out.
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_02: And this is a mistake that I think founders make all the time
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_02: is they have a good business idea from business school.
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_02: But they don't only care about it,
[00:41:18] SPEAKER_02: and they can get the energy to do it for two years.
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_02: When push comes to shove,
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_02: they really rather be doing some prime on it
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_02: or some variant of it, and it always fails.
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_02: So Sam, in this case, you're saying that the research mission
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_01: is the fun thing and the apps are not.
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_01: I'm saying if that's what Sam believes,
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_02: and the leadership actually in their heart of hearts thinks,
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_02: they're not going to be a successful product company, right?
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_02: Like long term.
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_04: Well, what if, what if you think one is a means
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_04: to the end, their end, right?
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_04: What if you believe?
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_04: Almost all of these end up this way, right?
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_01: Like early on, early on at Apple,
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_01: you always had to have the people working on the computers
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_01: and the chips and the operating system,
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_01: and then there had to be the applications team, right?
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_01: And it's a unique thing.
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_02: It's a unique thing.
[00:42:00] Kind of, but I would argue Steve Jobs,
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_02: Steve Jobs, the messianic leader of Apple, right?
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_02: Clearly cared about selling a lot of Apple devices.
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_02: Like, and he clearly had a set of values,
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_02: which you talk about a lot,
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_02: which is like what define the company?
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, he cared about the experience, right?
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_01: So the experience is the products.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_01: So they got good at it.
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_02: And I'm saying, you just, you can't be good.
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_02: If you're a leader and you're like,
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_02: I really want to be working on the funds,
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_02: this thing, which is what I care about,
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_02: the Messiah, AGI,
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_02: but I have to wake up every day
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_02: and spend fucking hours dealing with the chat GPT pre-rolls
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_02: to like pay the bills.
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_02: You're going to hate that,
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_02: and like ultimately you'll fail at it, right?
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_02: And like, this is what I've seen in startups,
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_02: there are always exceptions, there's always exceptions,
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_02: but I think it's like,
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_02: it's kind of one of those things where like,
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_02: even take like one of those boring companies
[00:42:50] SPEAKER_02: in history, Salesforce, okay?
[00:42:53] I didn't know where you're going to go with that, yeah.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_04: Well, you're like incredibly boring company.
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_02: You're like, how do you motivate
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_02: people to work at Salesforce?
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_02: Well, one, I think, banding off loves sales.
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_02: Like, he loves winning.
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_02: It's the Elhanna.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_02: He's just a winning, so we're like,
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_02: we can't even care what he's selling.
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_02: He's even trying about the product quality.
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_02: He just wants to win.
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_02: And like, and then for everyone else
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_02: who doesn't care enough about winning,
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_02: you invent a foundation and like make the foundation
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_02: really important in the narrative
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_02: so that you feel good about charity
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_02: because you can't convince people that this matters, right?
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_02: And so like, I just think like,
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_02: the founder mentality and then how you tell the story
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_02: and motivate like, it really is hard to break away from,
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_02: which is why again, like,
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_02: if you told me Sam Alman only cares
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_02: about beating Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_02: I'll give it a much higher probability of success,
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_02: then if he's like, I care about AGI, right?
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_02: It is hard of hard of hearts.
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_02: This is one to watch.
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_04: I'll leave it at that.
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_04: I think this is gonna be a very big deal.
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_04: Oh, no guys, we talked about AGI.
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_04: No, we talked about product,
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_02: the team culture and incentive.
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_03: Well, we'll have line this pod different.
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_03: Team culture and incentives.
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_02: This pod is not about AGI.
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's to be the headline.
[00:44:00] Well, I think it's just called offensive.
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_02: Founder incentive.
[00:44:03] SPEAKER_02: Let's go talk about crypto.
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_04: Why did bright arms strong feel the need to say
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_04: that Bitcoin was not going to zero recently?
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_04: How bad is it out there?
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_04: Crypto people.
[00:44:13] Yeah, I didn't see that either.
[00:44:15] I didn't see that either.
[00:44:16] Guys, got it reasonably down.
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_04: I mean, it's not like getting worse.
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_03: It's like stabilized bad, right?
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:44:23] Stabilized number go down.
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_01: We're not dropping off the cliff still.
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_03: We're just at the bottom of the cliff.
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_03: You guys, wait, I have such short memory.
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_02: Everyone's like, well, I've been through three cycles.
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_02: I'm old had at this.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_02: And then like, a little thing happens
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_02: if people get stressed.
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_02: My favorite non-statement statement today, though,
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_02: was definitely from Aaron Levy, who I do truly appreciate
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_02: as a human.
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_02: And he posts, he's just like the most AIs
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_02: changing everything like so excited personality ever.
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_02: And he posted this thing being like, AIs, it's a quote.
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_02: He's like, not going to take away jobs.
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, well, what camp are you in here?
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_02: And his line, he says, I'm emphatically in the camp
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_02: that AIs doesn't take all the jobs.
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, that is the funniest non-statement
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_02: I have ever heard.
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_02: He's like, OK, you're emphatically in the camp
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_02: that some jobs will exist.
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_02: That's amazing.
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_03: What percent of jobs exist?
[00:45:17] SPEAKER_03: Is it faster?
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he said half.
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_01: My favorite AIMIM was the one I sent to the group chat,
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_01: which is this Waymo that decides to drive straight through
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_01: a shootout or whatever.
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_01: There's like a criminal on the ground.
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_01: And the Waymo just like has no contextual awareness at all
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_01: and just like keeps on driving.
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_01: And the criminal looks up and is like, what the hell?
[00:45:40] So funny.
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_03: And it had a passenger inside of it too.
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_03: It had a passenger inside it.
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_03: Guys, Waymo went on a press tour today,
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_03: I think in response to this.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_03: And also Waymo, I think, killed another pet
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_03: in San Francisco yesterday.
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_03: They were on the today's show this morning,
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_03: opening the day with all their waymo friends.
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_03: Will AI take all of the pet jobs?
[00:46:03] Oh, God.
[00:46:04] Right?
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_03: How many robot pets will there be?
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:46:08] Couple thoughts here.
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the real thing is actually AI will end the grooming business.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_02: That won't be grooming.
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_01: Let's go short grooming.
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_04: Let's go back to Jess.
[00:46:16] Okay.
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_04: Waymo is in a press cycle because they released their safety
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_04: report today, which was stunning in how much safer Waymo's are.
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_04: When compared, and I quote, to human drivers on the same roads,
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_04: Waymo's self-driving cars were involved in 91% fewer,
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_04: serious injury or worse crashes,
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_04: and 80% fewer causing any injury,
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_04: 96% lower rate of injury causing crashes at intersections.
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_04: And this was also in an op-ed written by an emergency room doctor
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_04: who talks about the nature of her.
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_04: For what it was, Josh.
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_04: So does you guys sometimes look around at the humans
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_02: that are allowed to drive cars?
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_02: And you're just like, I'm shocked you're allowed to drive cars.
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, especially the really old people.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_03: Well, that's the same point.
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_03: And the really young people.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_02: I think this is less about Waymo and more about,
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_02: it's just flooring to me that we allow some people to drive cars.
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_02: And I like, I mean, God bless America and freedom,
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_02: but you're like, I cannot believe that
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_02: someone lets you operate a motor vehicle.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_02: The New York Times had a good quote,
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_03: which was that, while many see this as a tech story,
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_03: it's actually a public health breakthrough.
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_03: Like the amount of less hospital visits and deaths
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_03: is going to be astounding.
[00:47:31] But is that going to be good or bad for that?
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_02: You're going to put more pressure on the medical system
[00:47:34] SPEAKER_02: because you won't live longer.
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_02: Well, that's already happening with AI.
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_04: Sam, we want to save lives.
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_04: You have to, you have to align on that to make this work.
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_04: But I'm excited for this phase in Waymo,
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_04: two other fun Waymo factoids of the week.
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_04: They're testing the minivans everywhere.
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_04: So I've been seeing them out in the peninsula now.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_04: I don't know if you guys are seeing them.
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_04: And then also though, I did see one on the flatbed truck
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_04: on the 101, which definitely, you know,
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_04: I'm going through my head, what happened here?
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_04: Aaron Levy, funny guy said, well,
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_04: they didn't say how they were going to do freeway driving,
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_04: which I thought was very funny.
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_04: And you guys love Aaron Levy so much.
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_04: Well, we're just a constant conversation with them.
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_03: You're going to constant, his Twitter is just hilarious.
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_02: I'm very pro- Aaron.
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_02: You need to make him the fifth wheel on the pod.
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_03: He should just jump in the mud.
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_03: He likes to be made fun.
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_03: He loves the talk.
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_02: He loves the talk even more than I do.
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay.
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_04: No, that's not true.
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_04: Just one interesting factoid to add to your self-driving car
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_01: world.
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_01: This week, I was looking at there's a new interface
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_01: on the Tesla when you click on autopilot
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_01: that tells you the percentage of time
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_01: that the car has been self-driving.
[00:48:45] And I hadn't seen this before.
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_01: And mine is somewhere in the range of 70%,
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_01: which is like actually kind of mind blowing to me.
[00:48:55] Mine's 56% more than half of my drives are so.
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_03: That's really interesting.
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_01: More than half of your miles driven or drives
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_03: getting to a miles driven.
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:49:05] Like it's getting that good.
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_01: It's at the point now where it can literally start
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_03: coming out of your driveway.
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_03: And just like knows how to back up out of your driveway
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_03: and go.
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_03: And go into the parking spot.
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_03: Jess, I think you're the laggard on this one.
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_03: You are so afraid of those left turns at intersections
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_03: that you're not.
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_03: I am so afraid of the FOIA Tesla buried crash data
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_04: that my team is half or 10 years.
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_04: But the new, you can just tell Jess
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_01: like the whatever it is 14.1 and 14.2,
[00:49:36] SPEAKER_01: like they're just so good.
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_01: It's really crazy.
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_01: You can just feel it.
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_01: It's better at driving than you are.
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_01: Not than me.
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_01: You know, Waymo's great at driving.
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_04: And they're going to be 25% off weekdays
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_04: around my house, which isn't useful to me at all,
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_04: but I appreciate it.
[00:49:53] He'll freeze over before I let an AI drive my Miata.
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_02: I think that's probably a good thing.
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_02: Probably one of the last brands to get autonomous.
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_03: Autonomies, that's pretty good.
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_03: Should we do a little holiday party digest here, guys?
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_04: Tis the season.
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_04: Tis the season.
[00:50:10] SPEAKER_04: And there's been some suggestion, Sam,
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_04: that your etiquette book is missing holiday party etiquette.
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_04: So maybe we should.
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_04: You should come, this will air after tonight's
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_02: Hunter Perkins edition with a special client
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_02: of Brooklyn's edition.
[00:50:23] SPEAKER_04: You made a special Cliner Perkins edition of your etiquette book.
[00:50:25] SPEAKER_04: It's awesome.
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_04: You're going to love it.
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_04: It's the Cliner Perkins holiday party edition.
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_02: And it's fabulous.
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_02: I'm very excited to give it out to the Cliner Perkins theme tonight.
[00:50:34] SPEAKER_02: You are going to get kicked out of the Cliner Perkins holiday party,
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_04: which is the stodgiest of, I mean, very much fun.
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_04: Really looking forward to it.
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_04: Cliner Perkins, we get the dog.
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_04: No, I'm loving.
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_04: It's a highlight of my year, but it is the stodgy one.
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_04: Great sushi.
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_02: I hope they have good sushi.
[00:50:50] SPEAKER_02: Great sushi.
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_04: Let's grade the slow holiday party last night.
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_04: Moreons, what grade would you give it?
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_03: We were discussing this on our chiroid home.
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_03: We always enjoy the slow holiday party.
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_03: What did we say, Dave?
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_03: It's a bit.
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_03: There were Hollywood people there.
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_01: I was shocked.
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_01: It's a very diverse crowd.
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_03: We were impressed by the diversity of hitters
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_03: as Dave calls them at the party.
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_03: Hitters from many geographies.
[00:51:16] SPEAKER_01: Is it multi-hitter diversity?
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_01: It was.
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_03: It was a very, I was like, what brings you here?
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_03: And they're like, Sam, I'm like, really?
[00:51:23] It was Kevin too.
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_03: Apparently, just like told some people to show up
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_03: last minute.
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_03: So it all worked out.
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Kevin.
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_02: Kevin called.
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_02: I got in trouble by asking some people
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_03: if they were coming, you hadn't invited.
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_03: That was not good.
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_03: But you know, it's awkward.
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_03: It's awkward to mention who was there and who wasn't there.
[00:51:41] I will tell you this, because I want
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_02: of the people who works at slow is Clay Robbins,
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_02: who works so on crypto stuff with me.
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_02: And Kevin was making fun of him at the party,
[00:51:49] SPEAKER_02: and you didn't come to the last partner meeting.
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_02: And Clay was like, yeah, I didn't come to the last partner meeting
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_02: because the partner meeting before it,
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_02: you spent 45 minutes discussing the cost of the beef.
[00:52:00] That didn't seem worth my time.
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_02: And I was like, that is true that Kevin
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_02: didn't spend 45 minutes discussing that.
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_02: And I know exactly how much the beef cost as well.
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_03: Wait, the beef and the party are different.
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_03: Well, and I know you got it like 30% off.
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_03: No, I know all the things about the beef.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_03: Was it a cheap beef?
[00:52:18] No, it's because Justice having an information party.
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_03: And so you were able to negotiate some deals.
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_03: I know all the inside inside anyone does.
[00:52:25] SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_03: I'm nervous.
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_03: My stomach is churning because I'm like,
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_04: if we poured it over the budget from this party
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_04: for it's not an information party, but it's even more exciting
[00:52:34] SPEAKER_04: than that.
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_04: I have decided to put the competition aside for one night.
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_04: And I'm hosting a raucous Bay Area reporter
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_04: and editor party from all publications.
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_04: So about 50 plus people coming.
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_04: So if you want to place this story, come to my house.
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_02: How does that work?
[00:52:52] SPEAKER_03: Are people catty towards each other?
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_03: But they let's find out.
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_03: That's my help.
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_03: What will it be?
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_03: I'll fly on the wall at this party.
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_03: Now, what would be great, Jess?
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_02: What would make me really happy?
[00:53:05] SPEAKER_02: Because I assume that this is unfortunately
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_02: post tax dollars for our family is what if we just
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_02: send the word?
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_02: It's pretend.
[00:53:13] SPEAKER_04: It's just a business.
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_04: It's fabulous.
[00:53:15] SPEAKER_04: That's great.
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_04: It's not tax dollars.
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_04: This is my recruiting budget.
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_04: What are you talking about?
[00:53:20] SPEAKER_04: I love that.
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_02: Great.
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_02: Here's the thing.
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_02: We can just instead of serving the reporters like new food,
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_02: can we just use the leftovers from the last party?
[00:53:30] SPEAKER_04: No, we are.
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_04: We're using leftover flowers.
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_04: We're using leftover cocktail napkins.
[00:53:35] SPEAKER_04: We're using using leftover bar paraphernalia.
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_03: But the food will be fresh.
[00:53:41] SPEAKER_03: I learned about this from Kevin as well.
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, all the cost savings.
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_03: Great.
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_02: I appreciate my wife's instincts where she was like,
[00:53:47] SPEAKER_02: oh, you're having a holiday party here.
[00:53:49] SPEAKER_02: Can you extend the rental by two days
[00:53:51] SPEAKER_02: so that I can reuse exactly the same party?
[00:53:53] SPEAKER_02: And I was like, I like that.
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_02: That's good.
[00:53:55] SPEAKER_02: It's financial engineering.
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_03: Sam and Dave, should we have a GP-only Bay Area holiday
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_03: party?
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_03: And no.
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_03: But only GP's could cost.
[00:54:04] SPEAKER_03: Interesting.
[00:54:05] SPEAKER_03: But so no founders, no LPs, no random other people
[00:54:09] SPEAKER_03: and venture funds.
[00:54:10] SPEAKER_03: You can do a certain scale.
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_02: And you can't just call it.
[00:54:12] SPEAKER_02: It needs to be like the problem is that we have to exclude
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_02: ourselves.
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_02: Of 10 plus what?
[00:54:18] No, why?
[00:54:19] SPEAKER_02: Well, we think it's like a real,
[00:54:19] SPEAKER_02: because like, he's like a billion dollar GP
[00:54:22] SPEAKER_02: fund thing.
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_02: Guys, I would GP less than media.
[00:54:25] SPEAKER_03: That's the problem.
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_02: Okay, fund based on fund size.
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_03: How about fund size or AUM?
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_03: How do you define a fund?
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_03: How about, I like your idea, Brett.
[00:54:35] SPEAKER_02: We take it.
[00:54:36] SPEAKER_02: We invite people, but then you have to like,
[00:54:38] SPEAKER_02: you get like a badge that's like based on
[00:54:42] SPEAKER_02: how much money you manage.
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_02: It's just your DPI or your DPI.
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_03: We P.I.
[00:54:46] SPEAKER_02: I love that.
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_03: A DPI badge.
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_03: It's either green or red.
[00:54:51] We invite LPs.
[00:54:53] SPEAKER_02: It's you've lost money or neutral, you make money.
[00:54:55] SPEAKER_02: We put your returns just on a little placard
[00:54:57] SPEAKER_02: and you walk around and the GP is like,
[00:54:59] SPEAKER_02: Oh, look, it's a five X-er.
[00:55:01] SPEAKER_02: Hello, five X-er.
[00:55:03] SPEAKER_02: You refer to by your returns.
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_02: This reminds me.
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_04: So I'm going to Davos this year for the first time.
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_04: I've avoided until now.
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_04: And apparently each badge has dots and stickers
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_04: based on your levels.
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_04: So it just reminded me of that.
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_04: Which is really just how much you were willing
[00:55:21] SPEAKER_01: to pay to go, right?
[00:55:22] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_04: Exactly.
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_04: Which someone was like, get the good lounge access.
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_04: And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:55:30] SPEAKER_04: I like this though.
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_03: The more stickers, it's like it's like GoaWalla
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_03: or four square.
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_03: We're like our name tags at the GP party.
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_03: The more stickers, the more they fleece to you.
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_01: No, at the GP only party.
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_03: It's just like how many funds you've done,
[00:55:44] SPEAKER_03: like how much GP I you have.
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_03: There's just stickers for everything.
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_03: You need to be like one of noxious concepts.
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_02: It can't be like six.
[00:55:51] SPEAKER_02: It's just like some brutal.
[00:55:53] SPEAKER_02: When we went to Legoland last week,
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_03: we had these necklaces and the boys got different.
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_03: Like they're called pop badges that
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_03: like snapped onto the necklace strap
[00:56:02] SPEAKER_03: and each one of them meant something different.
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_03: So you'll have to earn your pop badge.
[00:56:06] SPEAKER_03: And then it's just whoever has the most flare
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_03: around their neck with it.
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_03: I've always thought that the IRS should just give you
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_02: some sort of like card, which says
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_02: how much you paid in taxes.
[00:56:16] SPEAKER_02: And then you can like flash it to get in the fancy clubs.
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_02: You know, like you'd be like, look,
[00:56:20] SPEAKER_02: because it's like an indirect way
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_02: of saying like, fuck you, I'm rich.
[00:56:23] SPEAKER_02: So if the IRS gave you something in return
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_02: for your taxes rather than just taking them, right?
[00:56:27] SPEAKER_02: Like some sort of badge when we entered that.
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_04: Well guys, we've done, are there any?
[00:56:32] SPEAKER_04: I'm very excited for the circuit.
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_04: We got the offline party coming up too.
