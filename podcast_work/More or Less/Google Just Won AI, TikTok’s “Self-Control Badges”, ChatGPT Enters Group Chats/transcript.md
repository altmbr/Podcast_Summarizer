[00:00:00] Google seems to be ramping up the engine
[00:00:02] Sam Altman: on monetizing these shit out of it in 18 different ways,
[00:00:05] Sam Altman: which is what you get to do when you have a freight train,
[00:00:08] Sam Altman: right, like Google that can put it everywhere
[00:00:11] Sam Altman: with the tech team all the way down to TPUs.
[00:00:13] Sam Altman: Like, they're gonna make money everywhere.
[00:00:15] Sam Altman: Sing them Microsoft.
[00:00:16] Why hello friends, welcome to more or less.
[00:00:40] Jessica Thompson: We've got a really exciting jam packed episode.
[00:00:43] Jessica Thompson: There's so much to discuss.
[00:00:46] Jessica Thompson: First off, dear God,
[00:00:48] Dave Nemeth: Brie, Chella, Brie, how are you four days later still here?
[00:00:55] Jessica Thompson: Like how are you recovered?
[00:00:59] Jessica Thompson: You look like fresh faced.
[00:01:01] Jessica Thompson: Thank you.
[00:01:02] Brie Larson: It's the spray tan.
[00:01:04] I told you Sam, didn't I?
[00:01:06] Brie Larson: Didn't I say?
[00:01:07] Brie Larson: I got a spray tan.
[00:01:08] Brie Larson: I told you spray tan.
[00:01:10] Brie Larson: I had very little clothing on that night.
[00:01:12] Brie Larson: I needed to have consistency of skin.
[00:01:15] Brie Larson: You look great.
[00:01:15] Brie Larson: What was the workout routine leading up to the Brittany
[00:01:17] Sam Altman: bitch performance?
[00:01:19] Sam Altman: A lot of hot yoga.
[00:01:20] Brie Larson: I did some dance lessons and peptides.
[00:01:25] That wasn't workout.
[00:01:26] Brie Larson: We're going to break down.
[00:01:28] Jessica Thompson: We are going to break down the content.
[00:01:29] Jessica Thompson: We need to tell people what Brie, Chella is.
[00:01:31] Jessica Thompson: That's not going to break it down.
[00:01:33] Jessica Thompson: I'm going to do like a tear down of Brie, Chella.
[00:01:35] Jessica Thompson: OK, I'm ready.
[00:01:36] Jessica Thompson: So as we all know, we're celebrating the 40th birthday
[00:01:40] Jessica Thompson: of Brie, Moring.
[00:01:41] And there's a lot of energetic Coachella
[00:01:45] Jessica Thompson: vibe in the invite.
[00:01:47] Jessica Thompson: So you kind of know what to expect
[00:01:49] Jessica Thompson: to wear a certain color based on where you met Brie.
[00:01:52] But I would say this was a, I think we made it through four
[00:01:56] Jessica Thompson: or five hours.
[00:01:57] Jessica Thompson: How long did the whole thing go?
[00:01:58] Jessica Thompson: Oh, the whole thing was five hours.
[00:02:00] Jessica Thompson: Yeah.
[00:02:00] Jessica Thompson: OK, so we made it through four hours.
[00:02:02] Brie Larson: It was.
[00:02:03] Dave Nemeth: I thought it was four.
[00:02:05] Seven to midnight.
[00:02:06] Brie Larson: Yeah.
[00:02:07] Of the Brit spectacular.
[00:02:10] But you missed the best last hour.
[00:02:12] Brie Larson: I missed the best last hour.
[00:02:14] Jessica Thompson: Performances galore from acrobatics, cover bands,
[00:02:19] Jessica Thompson: and from our very own Britney Spears in a red latex jumpsuit,
[00:02:26] Jessica Thompson: which is definitely my highlight of the evening.
[00:02:29] Jessica Thompson: Yeah.
[00:02:30] Brie Larson: Brit took the stage.
[00:02:31] Brie Larson: Little did you know, when I was 16 years old,
[00:02:34] Brie Larson: I was actually recruited to be a Britney Spears impersonator
[00:02:38] Brie Larson: by a company called Celebrity Twins.
[00:02:41] Brie Larson: And this isn't her peak Britney era
[00:02:43] Brie Larson: when she was dating Justin and hadn't gone crazy yet.
[00:02:46] Brie Larson: So this was like the perfect full circle moment of my life
[00:02:50] Brie Larson: to come out and perform oops, I did it again in the red cat suit
[00:02:54] Brie Larson: with the long blonde hair, with the choreography,
[00:02:57] Brie Larson: and of course, with Leonardo DiCaprio
[00:03:01] Brie Larson: as the male counterpart.
[00:03:03] Brie Larson: This would be Sam's highlight of the night, I think.
[00:03:05] Jessica Thompson: But we're going to take turns.
[00:03:07] Jessica Thompson: Sam, what's your highlight?
[00:03:09] Jessica Thompson: I did my highlight is I got a picture with Leonardo DiCaprio,
[00:03:13] Sam Altman: but I was the homeless guy and he was in a tux.
[00:03:15] Sam Altman: It was great.
[00:03:16] Sam Altman: It was like my exact, it was great.
[00:03:18] Sam Altman: I thought that I was really funny.
[00:03:19] Sam Altman: So I can't adjust like, you know,
[00:03:21] Jessica Thompson: he was on the street for this event.
[00:03:23] Jessica Thompson: Well, I've never been to Coachella.
[00:03:25] Sam Altman: And I think as a male, you're supposed to dress like a hobo
[00:03:28] Sam Altman: at Coachella, right?
[00:03:29] Sam Altman: Right?
[00:03:30] Dave Nemeth: Is that where the idea came from?
[00:03:31] Dave Nemeth: The idea came from the Hillsdale Mall three hours earlier.
[00:03:35] Jessica Thompson: Let's be honest.
[00:03:35] Jessica Thompson: To Suburbia on weekends, but just going to, like,
[00:03:38] Sam Altman: twice a year, we'll end up in Suburbia.
[00:03:41] Sam Altman: And we go to the mall and just walks up and down
[00:03:43] Sam Altman: and talks about getting our ears pierced
[00:03:45] Sam Altman: because apparently as we do at the mall.
[00:03:47] Sam Altman: And then I went to Sephora with her.
[00:03:51] I made Sam, I gave him the Sephora experience.
[00:03:54] Jessica Thompson: I bought a homeless person's hat,
[00:03:55] Sam Altman: but I bought it at Banana Republic,
[00:03:57] Sam Altman: which is where homeless people shop.
[00:03:59] Sam Altman: I don't really know.
[00:04:02] What you guys missed though, after the Britney performance,
[00:04:05] Brie Larson: was this dance troupe called Light Balance,
[00:04:09] Brie Larson: that one America's Got Talent, we made everything black.
[00:04:12] Brie Larson: So the whole venue got pitch black.
[00:04:14] Brie Larson: And these five dancers came out with these LED outfits on
[00:04:19] Brie Larson: and just crushed this, like, 15 minute performance
[00:04:22] Brie Larson: of, like, a medley of awesome songs
[00:04:25] Brie Larson: and insane dances all in the dark, like, glowing.
[00:04:28] Brie Larson: And then after that, we had the real, not a cover band,
[00:04:33] Brie Larson: Kesha, straight out of the 90s and early 2000s,
[00:04:38] Brie Larson: things like TikTok, your love is my drug, et cetera,
[00:04:41] Brie Larson: perform.
[00:04:42] Brie Larson: She was pouring whiskey down people's throats.
[00:04:44] Brie Larson: She accidentally splashed me in the eye,
[00:04:46] Brie Larson: pouring champagne down my throat.
[00:04:48] Brie Larson: Well, I saw that you sent us a sizzle reel.
[00:04:51] Jessica Thompson: So I'm gonna watch the sizzle reel.
[00:04:53] Brie Larson: Watch this sizzle reel to catch up on what you missed
[00:04:55] Brie Larson: because you definitely missed the grand finale.
[00:04:57] Sam Altman: I do think you missed an opportunity,
[00:04:59] Sam Altman: which would have been to have, like, an impersonator,
[00:05:01] Sam Altman: Kesha with Kesha, or better yet,
[00:05:04] Sam Altman: have Kesha play an impersonator of Kesha.
[00:05:07] Sam Altman: I don't know if Kesha would have done it.
[00:05:10] These pop stars are kind of divas, you know?
[00:05:12] Brie Larson: They have to have it their way.
[00:05:14] Brie Larson: Do you basically just, like, call Kesha's manager
[00:05:16] Jessica Thompson: and you're, like, come to my party?
[00:05:18] Brie Larson: I actually randomly know Kesha.
[00:05:21] We've known her for the last few years.
[00:05:23] Brie Larson: She's also a proud Aspen Institute
[00:05:25] Brie Larson: Henry Crown fellow, just like me, different class.
[00:05:28] Brie Larson: Oh, there we go.
[00:05:29] Brie Larson: And she actually has a lot of new startup music stuff
[00:05:33] Brie Larson: going on that we've been helping her out with on the side.
[00:05:35] Brie Larson: So.
[00:05:36] And she lives in Marin part of the year.
[00:05:38] I love it.
[00:05:39] Brie Larson: Okay, Dave, you're high life.
[00:05:41] I mean, it's pretty amazing.
[00:05:44] Dave Nemeth: I was to see your wife do a performance of this magnitude.
[00:05:48] Dave Nemeth: I think, Brett, you're fearless.
[00:05:51] Dave Nemeth: I think I would have been terrified,
[00:05:53] Dave Nemeth: particularly in that little of clothing.
[00:05:55] Dave Nemeth: I would need to work out much longer.
[00:05:58] I think we would have been terrified to see you
[00:06:00] Sam Altman: in that little of clothing.
[00:06:01] Dave Nemeth: I know.
[00:06:01] Dave Nemeth: That's what I'm saying.
[00:06:03] You would definitely need a spray tan.
[00:06:05] Brie Larson: All night, you were rocking a very hot outfit,
[00:06:09] Jessica Thompson: very short shorts, no shorts, basically underwear.
[00:06:12] Jessica Thompson: Let's call it what it was.
[00:06:14] That's fascinating because I'll be honest with you, Dave.
[00:06:16] Sam Altman: I had no idea what you were wearing,
[00:06:18] Sam Altman: but apparently you made it impression on my wife.
[00:06:19] Sam Altman: Oh no, she's talking about my outfit.
[00:06:21] Brie Larson: But wait, Jess, did you miss my outfit change?
[00:06:24] Brie Larson: I think you missed my outfit change.
[00:06:25] Brie Larson: It got worse.
[00:06:26] Brie Larson: No, no, no.
[00:06:27] Brie Larson: I saw the red what you changed after the red.
[00:06:30] Brie Larson: Oh, Jess, oh my gosh.
[00:06:32] Brie Larson: I'm going to watch the sizzle.
[00:06:34] Brie Larson: You missed the grand finale, including my grand finale outfit.
[00:06:39] It was basically borderline.
[00:06:41] Brie Larson: This thing is all fringe, but very little fringe.
[00:06:43] Brie Larson: And it was covering all the parts,
[00:06:45] Brie Larson: but I needed the spray tan.
[00:06:47] Brie Larson: I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:06:47] Brie Larson: Is this in the sizzle reel?
[00:06:49] Brie Larson: Yeah.
[00:06:50] Brie Larson: I'm dancing on stage with Kesha in the sizzle reel.
[00:06:54] Brie Larson: Oh, and then just look at the photo booth.
[00:06:56] Brie Larson: We'll get you the media.
[00:06:59] Jessica Thompson: OK, OK, we'll get it.
[00:07:00] Jessica Thompson: But Dave, you're highlight.
[00:07:02] Jessica Thompson: And Dave, you also look fabulous.
[00:07:03] Jessica Thompson: You were fully covered, though.
[00:07:05] Dave Nemeth: Yeah, I was.
[00:07:06] Dave Nemeth: I loved light balance.
[00:07:07] Dave Nemeth: They were truly amazing.
[00:07:09] Dave Nemeth: I knew about all this stuff ahead of time,
[00:07:11] Dave Nemeth: but they were awesome on the internet.
[00:07:13] Dave Nemeth: You should go look up their YouTube videos
[00:07:15] Dave Nemeth: if you're listening.
[00:07:17] Dave Nemeth: These guys are super impressive.
[00:07:19] Dave Nemeth: And I also know now what my 2026 Halloween costume is going to be.
[00:07:23] Dave Nemeth: Well, I was just like, you know what?
[00:07:24] Sam Altman: Richella actually did a very important thing for me,
[00:07:27] Sam Altman: which is I have been searching for a new athletic goal
[00:07:30] Sam Altman: because I get very sad when I don't have an athletic goal.
[00:07:33] Sam Altman: I just like, I'm like a puppy.
[00:07:34] Sam Altman: You don't really get very depressed.
[00:07:35] Sam Altman: Oh.
[00:07:36] Sam Altman: And I think that Richella inspired me.
[00:07:39] Sam Altman: I'm thinking it's going to be some sort of gymnastics routine,
[00:07:43] Sam Altman: like a floor routine, or maybe rings.
[00:07:47] Dave Nemeth: Oh, interesting.
[00:07:48] That guy was real rare.
[00:07:49] Brie Larson: Wait, so you're going to swap out the mountain climbing?
[00:07:52] Dave Nemeth: Are you going to swap the mountain climbing for rings?
[00:07:53] Dave Nemeth: I'm going to swap.
[00:07:54] Dave Nemeth: I'll just do both.
[00:07:55] Sam Altman: But I just think like if my goal for 2026
[00:07:58] Sam Altman: was to have like a sick, like Simone Biles style,
[00:08:02] Sam Altman: either like rings or vault or floor routine,
[00:08:06] Sam Altman: I was thinking like in a worst case,
[00:08:07] Sam Altman: it could be rhythmic gymnastics with the streamers.
[00:08:10] Sam Altman: But like, I want to be able to do like flips
[00:08:12] Sam Altman: in a floor routine or something.
[00:08:13] Sam Altman: But it was because I looked at your gymnastics people.
[00:08:15] Sam Altman: I was like, those people are pretty impressive.
[00:08:17] Sam Altman: They're super ripped.
[00:08:18] Sam Altman: Yeah, the amount of strength.
[00:08:20] Dave Nemeth: One girl's not even, well, she's ripped,
[00:08:22] Brie Larson: but she also hung by her hair on a giant like trapeze.
[00:08:26] Brie Larson: That was crazy.
[00:08:27] Brie Larson: Not I don't need to go.
[00:08:29] Brie Larson: I saw that at the Balienist farm stand
[00:08:31] Jessica Thompson: once, very strange, very strange.
[00:08:33] Jessica Thompson: The physics of it must be more chill than it seems.
[00:08:36] Dave Nemeth: Well, there's multiple things in her.
[00:08:38] Jessica Thompson: Because you know, I can get into this emotion.
[00:08:40] Jessica Thompson: But I think we can just say,
[00:08:42] Jessica Thompson: but I hope you're feeling very proud.
[00:08:44] Jessica Thompson: I also think everyone now I've gone up to them
[00:08:47] Jessica Thompson: and they could say, couldn't come or they were out of town.
[00:08:49] Jessica Thompson: I said, you know, it just is was the most authentically
[00:08:54] Jessica Thompson: Brit celebration of Brit there could be.
[00:08:57] Jessica Thompson: And I think there's like no better achievement
[00:09:01] Jessica Thompson: for to celebrate yourself.
[00:09:03] Jessica Thompson: So I hope everyone out there thinks for them
[00:09:07] Jessica Thompson: what would be the most authentic way to celebrate.
[00:09:10] Jessica Thompson: They're essence.
[00:09:11] Jessica Thompson: And that was amazing.
[00:09:13] The other thing I'll say is that I think
[00:09:15] Dave Nemeth: Brit's had the Brit and Co era creativity
[00:09:18] Dave Nemeth: in a bottle for too many years.
[00:09:20] Dave Nemeth: And I was happy to see it explode back into the real world.
[00:09:23] Dave Nemeth: And I hope that this is not the end
[00:09:25] Dave Nemeth: and that you keep doing these amazing things
[00:09:28] Dave Nemeth: in the real world.
[00:09:30] I've got a 50th and eight years.
[00:09:31] Brie Larson: What are you doing?
[00:09:32] Brie Larson: I'm happy to plan it.
[00:09:33] Brie Larson: Just get me a good budget and be okay with color and weird shit.
[00:09:38] Yeah, I think I mean, the not surprisingly thing
[00:09:41] Jessica Thompson: would surprise no one to know that my essence
[00:09:44] Jessica Thompson: would not be Britella.
[00:09:46] Jessica Thompson: Yours would be like a typewriter at every seat.
[00:09:50] Brie Larson: And we're all gonna write our own poetry about Jess.
[00:09:54] No, what I did for my 40th, which I was reflecting.
[00:09:58] Jessica Thompson: It was a real night of reflection
[00:09:59] Jessica Thompson: because it was such a special celebration.
[00:10:01] Jessica Thompson: I think I kind of nailed mine,
[00:10:04] Jessica Thompson: which was making all my friends surf in Mexico for three days.
[00:10:07] Jessica Thompson: That was kind of my essence forcing them to get on the water.
[00:10:11] Jessica Thompson: But anyway, it was amazing.
[00:10:14] Jessica Thompson: It took San Francisco by storm.
[00:10:16] Jessica Thompson: People are still talking about it and props to you on the content.
[00:10:20] Jessica Thompson: You like published basically a newsletter of content
[00:10:23] Jessica Thompson: based on your party that now I have to consume.
[00:10:26] Jessica Thompson: And it was wonderful.
[00:10:27] Jessica Thompson: So I mean, there's really,
[00:10:29] Jessica Thompson: there's no great way to segue into the week.
[00:10:32] Jessica Thompson: Other than guys, can I read, download Instagram right now?
[00:10:35] Jessica Thompson: Oh, did you go seven days?
[00:10:37] Jessica Thompson: Wait, tell us about your learning.
[00:10:39] Brie Larson: She really did go seven days.
[00:10:40] Dave Nemeth: I can just ask.
[00:10:41] Dave Nemeth: I mean, I don't, I don't have it.
[00:10:43] Jessica Thompson: It seems too short.
[00:10:44] Dave Nemeth: I feel like you should double down.
[00:10:45] Dave Nemeth: Keep going.
[00:10:46] Dave Nemeth: Here are my lessons.
[00:10:48] Jessica Thompson: I hate the phrase learnings.
[00:10:50] Jessica Thompson: It's such a jankony term.
[00:10:51] Jessica Thompson: That's right.
[00:10:52] Jessica Thompson: First of all, Instagram is confused.
[00:10:55] Jessica Thompson: They are sending me so many emails to probably to log back in
[00:10:58] Jessica Thompson: and read my unread DMs that I have definitely tripped
[00:11:02] Jessica Thompson: some algorithm where, well, they're very worried about me.
[00:11:05] Jessica Thompson: So thank you, Instagram.
[00:11:06] Jessica Thompson: I'm fine.
[00:11:07] Jessica Thompson: I'm here.
[00:11:08] Jessica Thompson: There were many moments like Brachella.
[00:11:10] Jessica Thompson: I was really happy I didn't have Instagram
[00:11:12] Jessica Thompson: because I didn't even think about my fun.
[00:11:15] And even my kids birthday.
[00:11:18] Jessica Thompson: And so I think the lesson is to kind of remember that, actually.
[00:11:23] Jessica Thompson: And it really does change my experience of it.
[00:11:25] Jessica Thompson: Like every time you popped up in a new outfit,
[00:11:28] Jessica Thompson: I didn't have to take a photo and post an Instagram.
[00:11:31] Jessica Thompson: But if I could have, my body would have wanted to.
[00:11:34] Jessica Thompson: I would have had to stop myself.
[00:11:36] Dave Nemeth: Isn't it interesting?
[00:11:37] Dave Nemeth: And I just felt none of that.
[00:11:39] Jessica Thompson: I actually walked out without my purse.
[00:11:41] Jessica Thompson: I totally forgot.
[00:11:42] Jessica Thompson: I had to go back and get my purse
[00:11:43] Jessica Thompson: because my phone was such not a part of my experience.
[00:11:47] Jessica Thompson: So I think both things can be true.
[00:11:49] Jessica Thompson: And I look forward to DMing people, memes, and Instagram,
[00:11:54] Jessica Thompson: and catching up on the goss and posting fun stuff.
[00:11:59] But I don't want to lose that, like, put the phone away thing.
[00:12:04] Jessica Thompson: That was pretty good.
[00:12:05] Jessica Thompson: Jess, could you have a dumb phone?
[00:12:07] Jessica Thompson: Would that be a good next step?
[00:12:08] Jessica Thompson: But I've got some of those.
[00:12:09] Sam Altman: I also have a novel phone.
[00:12:10] Sam Altman: But I think it's your friend, Dr. Becky, who says this,
[00:12:13] Jessica Thompson: which I take to heart.
[00:12:14] Jessica Thompson: She's always like, kids don't have a technology problem.
[00:12:18] Jessica Thompson: Parents have a boundary problem.
[00:12:20] Jessica Thompson: I think that's her point.
[00:12:22] And yeah, and then people have boundary problems
[00:12:25] Jessica Thompson: with technology, right?
[00:12:26] Jessica Thompson: Like, and so I actually think, I think I'm strong enough
[00:12:31] Jessica Thompson: to not have to quit cold turkey, but we'll see.
[00:12:35] But let's see how strong my boundaries are.
[00:12:37] Jessica Thompson: And if they're just certain things where I'm deliberately,
[00:12:40] Jessica Thompson: like, this is a phone off kind of thing.
[00:12:43] Jessica Thompson: Now, the problem is it's also my camera, so that...
[00:12:46] Yeah, that's the trodden horse.
[00:12:47] Sam Altman: Everyone needs a camera.
[00:12:49] Sam Altman: And like, I've tried buying standalone cameras as a solution.
[00:12:54] Sam Altman: But honestly, the iPhone camera is just so good.
[00:12:56] Sam Altman: It's like, that's what keeps you going.
[00:12:58] Sam Altman: It doesn't work.
[00:12:59] Sam Altman: So anyway, sorry guys, I'm just luging back in here
[00:13:01] Jessica Thompson: to see what I missed.
[00:13:04] In the middle of the pod.
[00:13:05] Dave Nemeth: Couple dozen DMs.
[00:13:07] Brie Larson: I feel like I saw photos of Wilders' birthday.
[00:13:11] Brie Larson: Was that from Sam's account?
[00:13:13] Brie Larson: Yeah, I posted those.
[00:13:14] Sam Altman: Oh, I can report about the Facebook
[00:13:17] Jessica Thompson: and how it's doing guys.
[00:13:18] Jessica Thompson: The Facebook.
[00:13:19] Sam Altman: She needed to post somewhere.
[00:13:20] Sam Altman: Well, it coincided with my mom's birthday,
[00:13:22] Jessica Thompson: my dad's birthday, and my youngest birthday.
[00:13:25] Jessica Thompson: And I do feel the need to post a nice photo on the birthdays.
[00:13:29] Jessica Thompson: You know?
[00:13:30] Jessica Thompson: So what was a girl to do?
[00:13:31] Jessica Thompson: Well, the big blue app was there.
[00:13:33] Jessica Thompson: It still works just for those who haven't been in a while.
[00:13:36] Jessica Thompson: I don't know how it's going.
[00:13:38] Jessica Thompson: But yeah, that was sort of my experience.
[00:13:41] Jessica Thompson: But there were other options.
[00:13:42] Jessica Thompson: I think my ex-use.
[00:13:43] Jessica Thompson: My ex-use, one up a little.
[00:13:45] Jessica Thompson: You know?
[00:13:46] Jessica Thompson: So we'll see.
[00:13:47] Jessica Thompson: I'm sure everyone's dying for these periodic updates.
[00:13:50] Jessica Thompson: I'll let people know, Dave, how are you doing on your?
[00:13:53] Well, it's interesting that you did this this week
[00:13:55] Dave Nemeth: because I redownloaded Instagram two weeks ago
[00:13:58] Dave Nemeth: because there's a project that I'm working on
[00:14:01] Dave Nemeth: that I wanted to look for some examples of that project.
[00:14:06] Dave Nemeth: And so for a week, I was like actually having kind of the opposite,
[00:14:11] Dave Nemeth: well, I guess, yeah, the opposite experience of you,
[00:14:13] Dave Nemeth: which is I've been off it for I'd even know now almost a year.
[00:14:16] Dave Nemeth: And for the first three days, I was like, oh, I can handle this.
[00:14:20] Dave Nemeth: I've, like, detrained my brain from this.
[00:14:23] Dave Nemeth: But within three or maybe four days,
[00:14:25] Dave Nemeth: I was finding myself just like in these rabbit holes,
[00:14:28] Dave Nemeth: mostly around daft punk returning.
[00:14:31] Dave Nemeth: You know, there's like these weird interesting glints
[00:14:34] Dave Nemeth: that daft punk might return.
[00:14:35] Dave Nemeth: And so I like looked at a few things there
[00:14:37] Dave Nemeth: and then my whole feed became,
[00:14:38] Dave Nemeth: didn't they perform without the helmet or some shit?
[00:14:41] Dave Nemeth: One of the guys did.
[00:14:42] Dave Nemeth: One of the guys did.
[00:14:43] Dave Nemeth: Anyway, but I've ended up in these like weird rabbit holes,
[00:14:46] Dave Nemeth: like learning more about the history of daft punk
[00:14:48] Dave Nemeth: than I should even care about,
[00:14:49] Dave Nemeth: even though they are probably my number one band.
[00:14:51] Dave Nemeth: But like, I've just like ended up in a lot of these sort of places
[00:14:55] Dave Nemeth: that I realized like I didn't even intend to get to.
[00:14:58] Dave Nemeth: And so I've re-deleted it because I was just like,
[00:15:00] Dave Nemeth: my mind is getting occupied by things
[00:15:02] Dave Nemeth: that don't matter to my every day.
[00:15:04] Dave Nemeth: And so it's an interesting, yeah, it's an interesting experience.
[00:15:09] Dave Nemeth: Meanwhile, did you guys see this week TikTok
[00:15:12] Brie Larson: has an affirmation journal feature?
[00:15:14] Brie Larson: And also they are trying to give you badges now
[00:15:18] Brie Larson: for controlling your TikTok usage
[00:15:20] Brie Larson: and doing screen time management.
[00:15:22] Brie Larson: Does anyone believe this is really going to happen?
[00:15:25] Brie Larson: No.
[00:15:26] No.
[00:15:27] Is this a marketing campaign?
[00:15:29] Brie Larson: It's like the badge is going to be like,
[00:15:30] Sam Altman: if you do, if you control yourself,
[00:15:32] Sam Altman: if you're a badge, it just says loser.
[00:15:34] Sam Altman: There's like one badge where if you complete your sleep hours mission
[00:15:38] Brie Larson: by avoiding using TikTok at night,
[00:15:39] Brie Larson: you get then you get that one.
[00:15:41] Brie Larson: Or you can use a meditation tools feature to get a badge.
[00:15:45] Brie Larson: So you're meditating more.
[00:15:48] Brie Larson: I love it because it's like if you were writing
[00:15:50] Sam Altman: like a satirical science fiction,
[00:15:53] Sam Altman: this is exactly what I would release.
[00:15:55] Sam Altman: It's like, hey, you know, we should really like badge,
[00:15:57] Sam Altman: we're gonna like give people cocaine
[00:16:00] Sam Altman: and then like release badges for having cocaine
[00:16:03] Sam Altman: on your nightstand, but not taking it.
[00:16:05] Sam Altman: Exactly.
[00:16:06] I mean, that's basically what TikTok and Instagram do.
[00:16:11] Dave Nemeth: It's like the tools aren't actually good at this.
[00:16:13] Dave Nemeth: I'd say the TikTok years and years ago
[00:16:16] Sam Altman: because I liked it too much briefly during COVID.
[00:16:18] Sam Altman: I thought it was like too good.
[00:16:19] Sam Altman: And I was like, this is, what's funny for me
[00:16:21] Sam Altman: is I re-downloaded it.
[00:16:22] Sam Altman: And it has completely forgotten anything I'm interested in.
[00:16:26] Sam Altman: And so I actually find TikTok
[00:16:27] Sam Altman: has to be kind of shitty for me
[00:16:29] Sam Altman: because it doesn't know me at all.
[00:16:30] Sam Altman: Whereas Instagram reals is just hilarious.
[00:16:33] Sam Altman: So it's like funny.
[00:16:34] Sam Altman: It's like I buy D-trained TikTok to the point
[00:16:36] Sam Altman: that TikTok isn't interesting.
[00:16:38] I guess Sam, that's kind of my point also about Instagram.
[00:16:41] Dave Nemeth: Like I hadn't interacted with it in so long
[00:16:43] Dave Nemeth: that it like was like, didn't know anything about me anymore.
[00:16:46] Dave Nemeth: And I like interacted once with Daff Punk.
[00:16:48] Dave Nemeth: And so now it's like all Daff Punk
[00:16:50] Dave Nemeth: and nothing else that I'm interested in.
[00:16:52] Okay, guys, we're gonna wrap up social media and go to AI.
[00:16:54] Jessica Thompson: So any final point on that?
[00:16:56] Jessica Thompson: Well, Jess, I think one of the more interesting things
[00:16:57] Dave Nemeth: to maybe talk about for a minute here
[00:16:59] Dave Nemeth: is that like in the world of seed investing,
[00:17:02] Dave Nemeth: there is a lot of social going on right now.
[00:17:05] Dave Nemeth: Like I'm getting hit with,
[00:17:07] Dave Nemeth: I'm probably getting hit with, I don't know.
[00:17:11] Dave Nemeth: I mean, probably three,
[00:17:13] Dave Nemeth: I always think of like how many founder meetings
[00:17:16] Dave Nemeth: that I end up in in a five day window.
[00:17:19] Dave Nemeth: And there's been like,
[00:17:21] Dave Nemeth: not a 996 venture capital is they've absolutely not.
[00:17:26] What is the VC ratio?
[00:17:28] Jessica Thompson: Is it?
[00:17:29] It's like a one, two, three.
[00:17:31] Dave Nemeth: Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:32] Dave Nemeth: It depends on what deals are happening.
[00:17:34] Brie Larson: One, two, three in no August.
[00:17:36] Dave Nemeth: I don't know.
[00:17:37] Brie Larson: I've worked on so many holidays
[00:17:39] Brie Larson: that we're really chasing something.
[00:17:41] Brie Larson: But we at least get to pretend, Britt.
[00:17:44] Brie Larson: We know.
[00:17:45] We haven't made it yet, I guess.
[00:17:47] There is a lot of interesting social going on.
[00:17:49] Dave Nemeth: And I actually think the most interesting social thing
[00:17:53] Dave Nemeth: happening in the last week
[00:17:54] Dave Nemeth: is that chat GPT launched group chats
[00:17:57] Dave Nemeth: in a bunch of obscure countries.
[00:17:59] Dave Nemeth: And I kind of look at this and I'm like,
[00:18:02] Dave Nemeth: I think I said this on a previous pod
[00:18:04] Dave Nemeth: that like this was by far the most obvious thing
[00:18:07] Dave Nemeth: to do in social with AI.
[00:18:10] Dave Nemeth: And it's like absolutely shocking to me
[00:18:12] Dave Nemeth: that Meta did not do this first
[00:18:14] Dave Nemeth: because it's like really, really obvious.
[00:18:17] Dave Nemeth: Can you give an example?
[00:18:18] Jessica Thompson: I don't know if I can use it.
[00:18:20] Jessica Thompson: I haven't.
[00:18:20] Jessica Thompson: So like I'm planning a trip.
[00:18:23] Let's say the four of us are planning a surfing trip
[00:18:26] Dave Nemeth: and we want to go somewhere new
[00:18:28] Dave Nemeth: that we've never been before.
[00:18:29] Dave Nemeth: We created a group chat
[00:18:30] Dave Nemeth: and chat GPT is in the chat with us
[00:18:33] Dave Nemeth: and is answering questions.
[00:18:35] Dave Nemeth: Yeah, like this is like not rocket science.
[00:18:38] Dave Nemeth: So it's chat outside.
[00:18:40] Jessica Thompson: It works even if, I mean, the chat is in the chat
[00:18:44] Jessica Thompson: but you don't have to chat about your chat GPT.
[00:18:47] Jessica Thompson: I'm not questioning the chat so many chats
[00:18:49] Jessica Thompson: in that sentence, just.
[00:18:51] So the construct of the chat is still the people
[00:18:54] Jessica Thompson: not the topic.
[00:18:56] Dave Nemeth: Yeah. And so what does this say?
[00:18:58] Dave Nemeth: Well, like to me, this has always been
[00:18:59] Dave Nemeth: like the obvious direction
[00:19:01] Dave Nemeth: and the very strategically dangerous direction
[00:19:04] Dave Nemeth: that chat GPT was going to go in,
[00:19:06] Dave Nemeth: which is, you know, now your friends
[00:19:09] Dave Nemeth: are in the left rail with you
[00:19:11] Dave Nemeth: along with all of your chats
[00:19:13] Dave Nemeth: and you can, you know, talk to chat GPT
[00:19:16] Dave Nemeth: along with your friends and all these kinds of things.
[00:19:18] Dave Nemeth: Like this was like going to happen.
[00:19:20] Dave Nemeth: I think maybe it was a cost-pertokin thing
[00:19:22] Dave Nemeth: that was the gating factor.
[00:19:24] Dave Nemeth: But I think it's a pretty big deal.
[00:19:27] Dave Nemeth: And I think that it's going to heat up
[00:19:30] Dave Nemeth: the battle between particular meta and open AI
[00:19:33] Dave Nemeth: like pretty dramatically.
[00:19:35] Sam Altman: One of them has, you put, you put the AI in the chat
[00:19:39] Sam Altman: and the other you put the people in the AI.
[00:19:41] Sam Altman: Exactly.
[00:19:42] Sam Altman: Well, also Apple and Google
[00:19:44] Brie Larson: because chat is just texting and yeah.
[00:19:47] Brie Larson: But look, in the end of the day,
[00:19:48] Sam Altman: this story of AI is because obviously Google
[00:19:50] Sam Altman: with Gemini3 has now taken the lead
[00:19:53] Sam Altman: and like open AI is looking pretty freaky
[00:19:55] Sam Altman: from my perspective.
[00:19:56] Sam Altman: Yeah, absolutely agree on that.
[00:19:58] Hey, who called Google in the beginning?
[00:20:00] Brie Larson: Just saying a say it.
[00:20:01] Brie Larson: All right, keep going Sam.
[00:20:02] Brie Larson: For it definitely called it.
[00:20:03] Dave Nemeth: And I'll tell you my thing is I called,
[00:20:05] Sam Altman: I think two or three weeks ago,
[00:20:07] Sam Altman: it's like the only stock I wish I owned I don't is Google.
[00:20:09] Sam Altman: You've said that every, hard for the last two months.
[00:20:12] Jessica Thompson: Every day I watch it go up and I'm like,
[00:20:14] Sam Altman: I started buying Google.
[00:20:16] Because I can't figure out a strategy.
[00:20:18] Sam Altman: No, I know, here's the problem.
[00:20:20] Sam Altman: You have to do it with like a ton of leverage, right?
[00:20:23] Sam Altman: Because there's two big company.
[00:20:24] Sam Altman: Like you're betting on it adding a few trillion in market cap.
[00:20:28] Sam Altman: You're not betting on a 10 or 100 X thing.
[00:20:30] Sam Altman: The problem is you put even a few million bucks in
[00:20:32] Sam Altman: at a few trillion dollar evaluation who cares.
[00:20:34] Sam Altman: Like in the other end, it's not worth it.
[00:20:36] Sam Altman: Like risk reward.
[00:20:37] Sam Altman: But so the whole strategy I'm trying to figure out,
[00:20:40] Sam Altman: I'm not an expert at this is what is the right way
[00:20:43] Sam Altman: to go long Google, but short QQQ or figure out?
[00:20:48] Sam Altman: Because like you don't all I'm willing to bet
[00:20:50] Sam Altman: is that Google is a send in and has like six things going on
[00:20:53] Sam Altman: and they're going to crush it relative to technology.
[00:20:56] Sam Altman: But I do not have any opinion about what QQQ
[00:21:00] Sam Altman: or the NASDAQ or the Mag 7 looks like.
[00:21:02] Sam Altman: And I do not want to be exposed to that
[00:21:04] Sam Altman: because I think that there's a very good chance
[00:21:06] Sam Altman: we ended up 30%, 40% drawout.
[00:21:07] Sam Altman: So how do you do that?
[00:21:08] Sam Altman: By the way, I've had some interesting conversations
[00:21:10] Sam Altman: with hedge fund people and would chat GPT
[00:21:12] Sam Altman: and Gemini about this.
[00:21:13] Sam Altman: So what is it, some combination of long calls and...
[00:21:16] Sam Altman: Okay, so where is, yeah, Sam, talk about this
[00:21:18] Jessica Thompson: and then go back to Gemini after.
[00:21:20] Jessica Thompson: No, the only point is like I think Brick called it
[00:21:21] Sam Altman: emotionally for a long time ago and I'm kicking myself
[00:21:24] Sam Altman: because it's a classic thing I do
[00:21:25] Sam Altman: where I either don't do the trade
[00:21:26] Sam Altman: or I do the trade a little bit and don't care
[00:21:28] Sam Altman: when it does really well
[00:21:30] Sam Altman: because I don't have enough exposure to it.
[00:21:31] Sam Altman: So that's my white whale of the moment.
[00:21:34] Sam Altman: But look, I don't know, like look, everyone,
[00:21:37] Sam Altman: the market's obviously selling off in a bunch of places.
[00:21:39] Sam Altman: You're super worried about the AI story
[00:21:41] Sam Altman: but as they well should be, right?
[00:21:43] Sam Altman: There's no new information here.
[00:21:44] Sam Altman: I think it's what a lot of us
[00:21:45] Sam Altman: been saying for years now in terms of where we're at.
[00:21:48] Sam Altman: But then the big thing is like honestly,
[00:21:50] Sam Altman: like Gemini's sick, Google's dropping it
[00:21:52] Sam Altman: into all sorts of places, the releasing faster.
[00:21:55] Sam Altman: I'm now a default Gemini user.
[00:21:57] Sam Altman: I always use it a bunch, but now I'm like default Gemini.
[00:22:00] Sam Altman: And I think ChatGPT is like really an open AI
[00:22:03] Sam Altman: is like the one that has by far the least access
[00:22:06] Sam Altman: to revenue and users at this point.
[00:22:08] Sam Altman: And I just, I think it's, look,
[00:22:10] Sam Altman: I've always been calling ChatGPT0 partially to be cheeky
[00:22:14] Sam Altman: and partially because I actually believe it.
[00:22:16] Sam Altman: But I honestly think this is going to be,
[00:22:19] Sam Altman: this year is like an absolute maker break
[00:22:22] Sam Altman: for if open AI is a thing or not is my view.
[00:22:26] So, and I think Google's crushing it.
[00:22:27] Sam Altman: What do you think open AI would have to do
[00:22:30] Brie Larson: to become a thing in the next 12 months?
[00:22:34] Brie Larson: I mean, to be like when, to be able to win.
[00:22:36] Brie Larson: They need to figure out how to make a fuck ton of money,
[00:22:38] Sam Altman: which they don't make.
[00:22:40] Sam Altman: And like the problem, I think,
[00:22:41] Sam Altman: if you think about what they have to do is like,
[00:22:43] Sam Altman: look, you know, I do think today's point,
[00:22:46] Sam Altman: there is a, basically everyone attacks them
[00:22:48] Sam Altman: in different directions, right?
[00:22:49] Sam Altman: So you have like the social story versus meta, et cetera.
[00:22:53] Sam Altman: Can they put a group chat in ChatGPT
[00:22:55] Sam Altman: does that help a little bit?
[00:22:56] Sam Altman: Sure.
[00:22:57] Sam Altman: But they are not on any direction
[00:22:59] Sam Altman: in the direction of winning a social story, right?
[00:23:01] Sam Altman: If anything, Sora, I think that'd be all called
[00:23:03] Sam Altman: was a flash on the pan and is dead.
[00:23:05] Sam Altman: That was my point with Sora, though, Sam,
[00:23:07] Dave Nemeth: that the actual social story,
[00:23:09] Dave Nemeth: if they were to go after it, is the group chat story.
[00:23:12] Dave Nemeth: 100%.
[00:23:13] Sam Altman: So like we know Sora is not a thing, right?
[00:23:15] Sam Altman: Like we putting a group chat around ChatGPT
[00:23:18] Sam Altman: or something is fine,
[00:23:20] Sam Altman: but I don't think that's gonna be like a singular
[00:23:21] Sam Altman: winning strategy that matters.
[00:23:23] Sam Altman: The more technical way to say it, though, Sam,
[00:23:25] Dave Nemeth: is putting a graph in ChatGPT.
[00:23:27] Dave Nemeth: Yeah, maybe, right?
[00:23:28] Sam Altman: Like I think I'm pretty skeptical.
[00:23:31] Sam Altman: I think it's a fine feature.
[00:23:32] Sam Altman: I don't think it's important, right?
[00:23:34] Sam Altman: In terms of like a defining move.
[00:23:36] Sam Altman: But is that true?
[00:23:37] Dave Nemeth: I mean, we've talked about this on the pod.
[00:23:39] Dave Nemeth: I don't know how many episodes ago,
[00:23:40] Dave Nemeth: maybe 10 episodes ago,
[00:23:41] Dave Nemeth: that the time spent in ChatGPT
[00:23:45] Dave Nemeth: was approaching Instagram.
[00:23:46] Dave Nemeth: Yeah, and also that when it went down,
[00:23:48] Jessica Thompson: they relaxed their content moderation.
[00:23:51] Sam Altman: But even if that's true, which may or may not be true,
[00:23:54] Sam Altman: I just don't, from a monetized ability perspective
[00:23:57] Sam Altman: in an ads pipeline, how do we want it?
[00:23:59] Sam Altman: I just don't buy it.
[00:24:00] Sam Altman: I think what's happened in a lot of the,
[00:24:02] Sam Altman: the thing that's interesting about these chat use cases
[00:24:05] Sam Altman: is what types of queries are they
[00:24:07] Sam Altman: and how monetizable they're relatively?
[00:24:09] Sam Altman: I'm not saying you can't monetize them at all.
[00:24:10] Sam Altman: I'm clearly can't.
[00:24:11] Sam Altman: Yeah, of course.
[00:24:12] Sam Altman: I think you've articulated this well.
[00:24:14] Sam Altman: But the problem is, is like,
[00:24:16] Sam Altman: I actually think what you're doing
[00:24:17] Sam Altman: is stopping up a bunch of time and attention
[00:24:19] Sam Altman: from like the most lonely, least monetizable queries
[00:24:24] Sam Altman: in people.
[00:24:25] Sam Altman: I just don't think that's true.
[00:24:26] Dave Nemeth: I mean, they've got a billion people on the thing.
[00:24:28] Dave Nemeth: They're like an Instagram scale app.
[00:24:31] Dave Nemeth: No.
[00:24:32] Dave Nemeth: But the problem is it's kind of, maybe, right?
[00:24:34] Sam Altman: As we'll see how it plays out.
[00:24:36] Sam Altman: But even if that's true, it's like, look,
[00:24:37] Sam Altman: everyone's like the Google query stream
[00:24:40] Dave Nemeth: that like is, you know, has more,
[00:24:43] Dave Nemeth: they have more text than meta does, right?
[00:24:45] Dave Nemeth: I don't know the numbers
[00:24:47] Sam Altman: and you might know them better,
[00:24:48] Sam Altman: but I just, my personal interest,
[00:24:50] Sam Altman: it's not that I don't use it.
[00:24:51] Sam Altman: I do use it.
[00:24:52] Sam Altman: I actually sent Jess, believe it or not,
[00:24:53] Sam Altman: even yesterday, I think I used it
[00:24:54] Sam Altman: for I was like, pretty impressed with its answers.
[00:24:56] Sam Altman: But I think Gemini's now taking up the mantle.
[00:24:58] Sam Altman: There's no, there's going to be
[00:25:00] Sam Altman: no technical differentiation in these foundation models,
[00:25:03] Sam Altman: right, unless something crazy happens.
[00:25:05] Sam Altman: But like, you're just going to have a bunch
[00:25:06] Sam Altman: of models that are quite good,
[00:25:07] Sam Altman: in which case you're competing for attention
[00:25:11] Sam Altman: and like, you have no revenue.
[00:25:13] Sam Altman: But I guess that's why I'm focused
[00:25:14] Dave Nemeth: on the attention feature, Sam,
[00:25:16] Dave Nemeth: which is that like the product matters, right?
[00:25:19] Dave Nemeth: Like if it becomes your default communications pathway
[00:25:22] Dave Nemeth: as well.
[00:25:22] Dave Nemeth: There's several business models around AI
[00:25:25] Sam Altman: that we've all been talking about in circles, right?
[00:25:27] Sam Altman: There was an arrow and everyone was like,
[00:25:28] Sam Altman: forget chat GPT and the agent,
[00:25:31] Sam Altman: it's all about the business layer.
[00:25:32] Sam Altman: And I was like, no, no, no, no, that's going to be commoditized.
[00:25:34] Sam Altman: It's about time spent and it's more of a social.
[00:25:36] Sam Altman: So people are debating what's valuable, right?
[00:25:39] Sam Altman: What I know, and I'm very convinced of,
[00:25:41] Sam Altman: is that Google seems to be ramping up the engine
[00:25:44] Sam Altman: on monetizing these shit out of it in 18 different ways,
[00:25:47] Sam Altman: which is what you get to do when you have a freight train,
[00:25:50] Sam Altman: right, like Google that can put it everywhere
[00:25:53] Sam Altman: with the tech team all the way down to TPUs.
[00:25:55] Sam Altman: Like, they're going to make money everywhere.
[00:25:57] Sam Altman: It's like, Microsoft is going to make money
[00:25:59] Sam Altman: a thousand ways on this, right?
[00:26:01] Sam Altman: We all know that in different things.
[00:26:03] Sam Altman: You know, then you have like meta,
[00:26:04] Sam Altman: which has a one obvious way to make money on it
[00:26:07] Sam Altman: and they'll make a ton of money on it,
[00:26:08] Sam Altman: which is optimizing ads, doing what they do,
[00:26:10] Sam Altman: and then maybe some bogeys to the upside.
[00:26:12] Sam Altman: And then you have open AI, which does another revenue,
[00:26:15] Sam Altman: they do a bunch of distribution and branding.
[00:26:17] Sam Altman: They don't have technical differentiation increasingly, right?
[00:26:20] Sam Altman: And so the question is like that, and by the way,
[00:26:22] Sam Altman: and like, and they're, so that's an interesting hand to play.
[00:26:25] Sam Altman: But the thing that you're missing, though, Sam,
[00:26:27] Brie Larson: is that like it also is about the data set.
[00:26:29] Brie Larson: The reason I called Google early on
[00:26:32] Brie Larson: is also because they know the most about me than anyone.
[00:26:34] Brie Larson: Like they know everything in my Gmail docs calendar,
[00:26:38] Brie Larson: my YouTube, like entertainment preferences.
[00:26:41] Brie Larson: Sure, I mean, I also think the reality is,
[00:26:43] Sam Altman: if you're anthropic, which is doing really well,
[00:26:45] Sam Altman: if you're a bunch of other people,
[00:26:46] Sam Altman: there are other ways to get the pieces you need,
[00:26:48] Sam Altman: so to speak, right?
[00:26:49] Sam Altman: Like, you know, everyone's in terms of data.
[00:26:51] Sam Altman: Yeah, like everyone's connecting in your Gmail
[00:26:53] Sam Altman: and your calendar now, if you're crazy enough
[00:26:55] Sam Altman: to give it to them.
[00:26:55] Sam Altman: But even beyond that, like they have like Google health data
[00:26:58] Brie Larson: sets from like many, many years.
[00:27:00] Brie Larson: Britain, no one put their data in Google health except you.
[00:27:03] Jessica Thompson: Let's just call it.
[00:27:04] Jessica Thompson: I'll give you this.
[00:27:05] Sam Altman: I know other people maybe even on this podcast,
[00:27:07] Sam Altman: you feel this way, which is like,
[00:27:08] Sam Altman: you know, how do you get data?
[00:27:09] Sam Altman: It's like, well, one is like, who do you trust?
[00:27:11] Sam Altman: Trying to sell me under the bus.
[00:27:13] Jessica Thompson: Who do you know?
[00:27:14] Jessica Thompson: For a whole bunch of reasons, I trust Google,
[00:27:17] Sam Altman: and the value of trust is like much higher
[00:27:20] Sam Altman: than other companies, right?
[00:27:21] Sam Altman: It's the same thing, I trust Waymo,
[00:27:22] Sam Altman: I don't really trust Tesla self-driving.
[00:27:24] Sam Altman: I think the incentives are more aligned.
[00:27:26] Sam Altman: I like just like, so the,
[00:27:28] Sam Altman: I just think there's like a lot of arrows
[00:27:29] Sam Altman: that are pointed against, you know, open AI
[00:27:32] Sam Altman: being successful here.
[00:27:34] Sam Altman: And like, we'll see how it plays out.
[00:27:35] Sam Altman: I mean, this year will be critical.
[00:27:36] Sam Altman: And I do think the biggest thing is like,
[00:27:38] Sam Altman: if you have a shit ton of profit,
[00:27:40] Sam Altman: not even revenue, but profit, you have a lot of shots on goal.
[00:27:43] Sam Altman: You got a lot of ammunition to try different things
[00:27:45] Sam Altman: the whole line yards.
[00:27:46] Sam Altman: Open AI doesn't have that, right?
[00:27:48] Sam Altman: And so they're gonna have to, if you said there's one thing
[00:27:50] Sam Altman: to solve, it's that, but we'll see, right?
[00:27:53] Sam Altman: So all up to Fiji.
[00:27:54] Sam Altman: Open AI still has a blank checkbook for raising money.
[00:27:57] Jessica Thompson: That could change, but from who?
[00:27:59] Jessica Thompson: From the world, from, I'm not sure.
[00:28:02] Jessica Thompson: The Middle East, from, I don't know.
[00:28:03] Jessica Thompson: I think this comes down to the,
[00:28:05] Jessica Thompson: I wanna make a point and then we'll come back to you, Dave.
[00:28:09] Sam Altman: You get blah, blah, blah, by Jessica, you're really in trouble.
[00:28:11] Sam Altman: I know, that's what I'm stopping.
[00:28:13] Okay.
[00:28:14] Jessica Thompson: On the business model for the consumer side point,
[00:28:17] Jessica Thompson: Fiji gave an interview and wired this week,
[00:28:20] Jessica Thompson: saying that they're gonna make money
[00:28:22] Jessica Thompson: because people are gonna play for subscriptions
[00:28:25] Jessica Thompson: that are gonna give them access to the best financial advisor,
[00:28:29] Jessica Thompson: the best personal shopper, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:28:32] Jessica Thompson: And I don't buy that because you can get all of that
[00:28:34] Jessica Thompson: for free now in other places.
[00:28:36] Jessica Thompson: But I think she, this is how media relations works.
[00:28:42] Jessica Thompson: You do an interview when you feel like
[00:28:43] Jessica Thompson: you need to get your narrative out there
[00:28:45] Jessica Thompson: because people are questioning your narrative.
[00:28:48] Jessica Thompson: I don't, I actually should remember,
[00:28:50] Jessica Thompson: she talked a lot about ads, but I don't think she did.
[00:28:52] Jessica Thompson: Because the pieces haven't come together again.
[00:28:56] Jessica Thompson: But I don't think that consumer story flies one bit.
[00:28:59] Jessica Thompson: Now, OpenAI is getting big traction on the business I sue,
[00:29:02] Jessica Thompson: but consumer subscriptions are not gonna be the business.
[00:29:05] Jessica Thompson: There is something happening at the intersection
[00:29:08] Jessica Thompson: of commerce and ads that is really could come together
[00:29:11] Jessica Thompson: in an interesting way, but again,
[00:29:14] Jessica Thompson: is a fragmented space and everyone OpenAI is talking to,
[00:29:16] Jessica Thompson: is also talking to everyone else.
[00:29:18] Jessica Thompson: And of course, Amazon's the big gorilla there.
[00:29:20] Jessica Thompson: So, and Shopify.
[00:29:22] Dave Nemeth: And Shopify.
[00:29:24] Shopify is way bigger than people realize.
[00:29:26] Dave Nemeth: Right, but you could integrate with, but yes.
[00:29:29] Jessica Thompson: You could, but they care, they're trying to take on Amazon,
[00:29:32] Dave Nemeth: right? So they're out there, you know,
[00:29:33] Dave Nemeth: they care about being the front, front surface for commerce,
[00:29:36] Dave Nemeth: right?
[00:29:37] Sam Altman: They're gonna find ways to make more money.
[00:29:38] Sam Altman: That's unquestionably true.
[00:29:40] Sam Altman: I don't think they're gonna be hyper scalable,
[00:29:42] Sam Altman: huge ways that are obvious on the consumer side.
[00:29:44] Sam Altman: And like, look, when you raise it a half a,
[00:29:46] Sam Altman: you build, what a half a truly dollar valuation,
[00:29:49] Sam Altman: it's not clear at all to me, just that the spigots
[00:29:51] Sam Altman: for it and finit financing are on right now, right?
[00:29:53] Sam Altman: Like, I think the reality is, is like,
[00:29:55] Sam Altman: people wanna see some delivery.
[00:29:57] Sam Altman: And again, it's possible to figure it out,
[00:30:00] Sam Altman: but I 100% with you with it.
[00:30:02] Sam Altman: When they start saying that this invented personal
[00:30:05] Sam Altman: assistant finance thing, which they don't have,
[00:30:08] Sam Altman: is gonna be a thing that like, so many people
[00:30:11] Sam Altman: are gonna subscribe to as a net new subscription.
[00:30:14] Sam Altman: We're not even talking about like,
[00:30:15] Sam Altman: I'm already watching video or I'm listening to music,
[00:30:17] Sam Altman: I might as well use Spotify.
[00:30:18] Sam Altman: There's like a net new thing they've created
[00:30:20] Sam Altman: that is like vanishingly unlikely.
[00:30:22] Sam Altman: And I say that as someone who loves subscription,
[00:30:24] Sam Altman: totally.
[00:30:25] Jessica Thompson: Yeah, and it's a great example of like,
[00:30:27] Jessica Thompson: when people say Silicon Valley people don't get,
[00:30:29] Jessica Thompson: how other people spend their money or time,
[00:30:31] Jessica Thompson: I think that is a good example of that.
[00:30:34] Jessica Thompson: The other thing I wanna say though,
[00:30:35] Jessica Thompson: and I do wanna shift the conversation slightly
[00:30:38] Jessica Thompson: because Dave, did you do another chat GBT point?
[00:30:42] Dave Nemeth: Well, I think that what's interesting is
[00:30:44] Dave Nemeth: back to analogy I made maybe six months ago,
[00:30:47] Dave Nemeth: which is that like the actual thing
[00:30:49] Dave Nemeth: that people are buying with these subscriptions
[00:30:51] Dave Nemeth: is a computer.
[00:30:52] Dave Nemeth: It's like these guys runs the run a computer business.
[00:30:54] Dave Nemeth: I subscribe to chat GBT pro because it's like a computer
[00:30:58] Dave Nemeth: that I need to have in my life.
[00:30:59] Dave Nemeth: And so what you're saying Jess,
[00:31:01] Dave Nemeth: is kind of like the early computer days
[00:31:03] Dave Nemeth: where people would pay for more software
[00:31:05] Dave Nemeth: to load onto their computer.
[00:31:07] Dave Nemeth: And that's kind of what they're pitching.
[00:31:08] Dave Nemeth: They're basically saying like,
[00:31:10] Dave Nemeth: we're gonna build quick in and quick books for you
[00:31:12] Dave Nemeth: and you're gonna pay extra money for that
[00:31:13] Dave Nemeth: on top of the computer you already bought from us.
[00:31:15] Dave Nemeth: And that's just not how people think about the internet today.
[00:31:19] Dave Nemeth: Yeah.
[00:31:20] Sam Altman: It's also a pretty hard pitch in the era
[00:31:21] Sam Altman: when like making the actual software
[00:31:23] Sam Altman: is nearly free and easy, right?
[00:31:25] Sam Altman: That's what I mean.
[00:31:26] Dave Nemeth: Like this is just not what we,
[00:31:27] Dave Nemeth: this is just not how people think about software.
[00:31:29] Dave Nemeth: It's not how we run these business models anymore.
[00:31:32] Dave Nemeth: And so it's kind of a strange pitch.
[00:31:34] Dave Nemeth: But if they can get a wedge into some features,
[00:31:36] Brie Larson: like the social thing is really interesting.
[00:31:38] Brie Larson: Like if we start using that as our primary means
[00:31:40] Brie Larson: of communication, I know,
[00:31:42] Brie Larson: well, I also do think they need to build up
[00:31:44] Brie Larson: their enterprise staff.
[00:31:45] Brie Larson: I gotta understand why they're not doing more
[00:31:46] Brie Larson: around everything in enterprise.
[00:31:48] Brie Larson: They look, they have so much money
[00:31:51] Sam Altman: and so many talented people who all want to do
[00:31:52] Sam Altman: their own different things that they're trying everything.
[00:31:55] Sam Altman: I mean, I think they just hired a bunch of people
[00:31:56] Sam Altman: from Morgan Stanley to try to figure out how analysts work
[00:31:58] Sam Altman: and create like analyst thought, right?
[00:32:00] Sam Altman: They're gonna try everything.
[00:32:01] Sam Altman: I just, the problem with trying everything is 95% of it
[00:32:07] Sam Altman: won't work.
[00:32:07] Sam Altman: It's actually very similar to the narrative around AGI.
[00:32:10] Sam Altman: The narrative on AGI is effectively,
[00:32:13] Sam Altman: we get this stuff and no, it's not gonna get us
[00:32:15] Sam Altman: to true, you know, human level intelligence,
[00:32:18] Sam Altman: but yada, yada, yada, it will figure out
[00:32:19] Sam Altman: how to have us get there.
[00:32:21] Sam Altman: It's kind of the same thing here.
[00:32:22] Sam Altman: We're like, we don't actually know what's gonna work.
[00:32:24] Sam Altman: We're gonna do literally everything
[00:32:25] Sam Altman: and like something will work.
[00:32:27] Sam Altman: Right?
[00:32:27] Sam Altman: That's kind of feels like the arrow word in,
[00:32:28] Sam Altman: you know, on the chat GPT opening AGI side for me.
[00:32:31] Sam Altman: Yeah.
[00:32:32] Jessica Thompson: Well, but I, something we haven't talked a lot on this pod,
[00:32:35] Jessica Thompson: which is probably worth talking about,
[00:32:38] Jessica Thompson: is people don't like AGI.
[00:32:40] Jessica Thompson: People don't like it?
[00:32:41] Dave Nemeth: Yeah, people don't like AGI.
[00:32:43] Dave Nemeth: Yeah, you talk to people outside AGI,
[00:32:46] start ups in Silicon Valley,
[00:32:48] Jessica Thompson: and they're like, it's gonna jack my electricity prices up.
[00:32:52] Jessica Thompson: It's gonna make my cans mentally ill.
[00:32:55] Jessica Thompson: Like that feeling has been there for some time.
[00:32:59] Jessica Thompson: It's getting quite big.
[00:33:02] Jessica Thompson: The question that I have on that, Jess,
[00:33:05] Dave Nemeth: what that makes me think of is when I was sitting inside
[00:33:08] Dave Nemeth: of the original Facebook building,
[00:33:10] Dave Nemeth: and when we first launched newsfeed,
[00:33:13] Dave Nemeth: and for like the year after that,
[00:33:16] Dave Nemeth: everyone was saying this, there was this like,
[00:33:19] Dave Nemeth: no one likes newsfeed, everyone like,
[00:33:22] Dave Nemeth: does it like social networking,
[00:33:24] Dave Nemeth: and we would just look at the data,
[00:33:26] Dave Nemeth: and the data was the opposite.
[00:33:27] Dave Nemeth: It's like everybody was using it more than ever.
[00:33:30] Dave Nemeth: Well, this kind of gets to my point, Dave.
[00:33:33] Jessica Thompson: This gets to my point.
[00:33:34] Jessica Thompson: I don't think, I kind of wonder if on a pure tactics basis,
[00:33:39] Jessica Thompson: companies building AGI should be like rebranding it.
[00:33:43] Jessica Thompson: And the reason I thought about this
[00:33:45] Jessica Thompson: is the Gemini launch yesterday.
[00:33:47] Jessica Thompson: It was all about Gemini.
[00:33:48] Jessica Thompson: It was all about Google products.
[00:33:50] Jessica Thompson: Some of them were embedded into search already.
[00:33:53] Jessica Thompson: The search you know, some of them are new tools,
[00:33:56] Jessica Thompson: but it's not like Gemini AI.
[00:33:59] Jessica Thompson: I mean, that was sound weird.
[00:34:01] Jessica Thompson: And I think it will be very interesting.
[00:34:04] Jessica Thompson: Obviously, AIA has been the wrapper of the narrative
[00:34:08] Jessica Thompson: because it's raised money and it's recruited engineers.
[00:34:11] Jessica Thompson: And so we needed a new narrative
[00:34:13] Jessica Thompson: because you can't raise a trillion dollars
[00:34:14] Jessica Thompson: against an incremental narrative.
[00:34:17] But it kind of feels pretty likely
[00:34:21] Jessica Thompson: that we could be sitting here in five years
[00:34:23] Jessica Thompson: with all sorts of new technology at our fingertips,
[00:34:27] Jessica Thompson: but that is just kind of new technology
[00:34:31] Jessica Thompson: powered by new AI models and so forth.
[00:34:34] Jessica Thompson: And that the average consumer isn't sitting there
[00:34:36] Jessica Thompson: being like, oh, I'm using AI now.
[00:34:39] Jessica Thompson: And I also like our eight year old thinks
[00:34:43] Jessica Thompson: Gemini is Google and Google is Gemini
[00:34:45] Jessica Thompson: and he doesn't know the difference.
[00:34:47] And it really doesn't matter.
[00:34:50] Jessica Thompson: Of course, he doesn't know the difference.
[00:34:52] Jessica Thompson: And if the world goes in this direction,
[00:34:56] Google is so much better positioned.
[00:34:58] Jessica Thompson: Just be Google.
[00:34:59] Sam Altman: Then open AI.
[00:35:00] Jessica Thompson: Yeah, look, the argument, the thing
[00:35:01] Sam Altman: you keep hearing people say to that,
[00:35:04] Sam Altman: to just to your point in terms of how this plays out
[00:35:07] Sam Altman: is I've heard a lot of people give a story
[00:35:08] Sam Altman: and being like, look, there's all these things
[00:35:10] Sam Altman: that Google is ascending on
[00:35:12] Sam Altman: and all these other companies are chipping away.
[00:35:13] Sam Altman: But at least open AI still, they own the Kleenex verb.
[00:35:17] Sam Altman: Like they own the chat GPT.
[00:35:19] Sam Altman: And that's true if it's Kleenex,
[00:35:22] Sam Altman: but if it's just like a few year disruption.
[00:35:24] Sam Altman: If it's cocaine.
[00:35:26] Sam Altman: If it's cocaine, if it's Coca Cola, right, like fine.
[00:35:31] Sam Altman: But I actually think there's a very strong argument
[00:35:33] Sam Altman: you're making right now, which I agree with,
[00:35:35] Sam Altman: that actually, like, chat GPT is not Kleenex.
[00:35:39] Sam Altman: And like this will be a branding blip in history.
[00:35:43] Sam Altman: And there's just like, yeah, like our software does more stuff.
[00:35:46] Sam Altman: Yeah.
[00:35:47] Jessica Thompson: And by the way, that's awesome stuff.
[00:35:48] Jessica Thompson: I'm not arguing that the technology
[00:35:50] Jessica Thompson: will lead to more productivity or have these things, but like.
[00:35:54] Jessica Thompson: Well, it may or may not, but yeah.
[00:35:56] Jessica Thompson: But why don't we, and I don't know,
[00:35:57] Jessica Thompson: I think that's a real last 18 months
[00:36:00] Jessica Thompson: where like, tack AI onto your brand to make it more valuable.
[00:36:04] Jessica Thompson: I think the next 18 are going to be take it off.
[00:36:06] Jessica Thompson: Yeah. Well, that's every centralization, decentralization.
[00:36:10] Brand on brand.
[00:36:11] Sam Altman: Brand on brand.
[00:36:12] Jessica Thompson: So that is one of my predictions.
[00:36:14] Jessica Thompson: But the Gemini launch is very interesting.
[00:36:17] I mean, there's first of all, there's so much stuff.
[00:36:20] Jessica Thompson: And I don't even know how companies do these launches anymore
[00:36:22] Jessica Thompson: because I'm pretty tech savvy
[00:36:24] Jessica Thompson: and I don't even know how to do half of the stuff.
[00:36:26] Jessica Thompson: I'm reading like Sundar's tweet thread,
[00:36:29] Jessica Thompson: trying to be like, oh wait, I want to try this or that
[00:36:31] Jessica Thompson: or where's this and.
[00:36:33] Sam Altman: I don't think you need to.
[00:36:34] Sam Altman: I mean, this is kind of the nice part.
[00:36:35] Sam Altman: I think this is going to be so bullish on Google.
[00:36:39] Sam Altman: I say this having not yet bought enough of this stock
[00:36:41] Sam Altman: or have a strategy is like, look.
[00:36:44] Say it one more time, Sam.
[00:36:45] Brie Larson: You go in Gmail.
[00:36:47] And like, all of a sudden there's like a scheduling
[00:36:49] Sam Altman: and they can textually pop stuff
[00:36:51] Sam Altman: and it helps you schedule on the fly with a bunch of AI.
[00:36:53] Sam Altman: And you're like, yup, that's how you deploy it.
[00:36:54] Sam Altman: You just stick it into the places where it's most relevant.
[00:36:57] Sam Altman: And it's like, it's not even a big one.
[00:36:59] Sam Altman: It's just like an evolution of all the things.
[00:37:00] Sam Altman: Guys, is it time for me to move from superhuman back to Gmail?
[00:37:04] Yes, Britt.
[00:37:05] Brie Larson: You're like a lot, is human gone now?
[00:37:07] Sam Altman: Why you?
[00:37:08] Sam Altman: No, superhuman was sold to Grammarly or something.
[00:37:11] Brie Larson: No, it's the other way around, I think.
[00:37:14] Dave Nemeth: No, no, no, no.
[00:37:15] Sam Altman: Superhuman.
[00:37:15] Sam Altman: But it has AI features.
[00:37:17] Brie Larson: Superhuman did not buy Grammarly.
[00:37:19] Sam Altman: Grammarly is way bigger than superhuman.
[00:37:20] Sam Altman: Whatever, anyway, they.
[00:37:21] Brie Larson: Well, one of them bought the other, Sam.
[00:37:23] Sam Altman: Well, not for a lot of money, I can tell you that.
[00:37:25] Sam Altman: They're the same company now.
[00:37:27] Sam Altman: Grammarly is acquiring a bunch of companies
[00:37:29] Sam Altman: very cheaply right now.
[00:37:31] Sam Altman: Because you think about Grammarly is an interesting one, right?
[00:37:33] Sam Altman: Very high fire.
[00:37:34] Sam Altman: Lots of the money.
[00:37:36] Sam Altman: Like people loved it.
[00:37:37] Sam Altman: Rumbai Shashir Mahodra, who's a great executive.
[00:37:40] Jessica Thompson: Yeah, I worked with him at Google back in the day.
[00:37:43] Jessica Thompson: He's one of the reasons where a subscription business
[00:37:46] Jessica Thompson: at the information Shashir.
[00:37:47] Brie Larson: So his wife is one of our offline founders too.
[00:37:50] Brie Larson: Oh, wait, it says he's CEO of superhuman formerly Grammarly.
[00:37:54] Jessica Thompson: They changed the name of...
[00:37:55] Jessica Thompson: They changed the name.
[00:37:56] Sam Altman: It's a better name.
[00:37:58] Sam Altman: But they bought the company.
[00:38:00] Sam Altman: But here's the thing.
[00:38:01] Sam Altman: It's a great example.
[00:38:03] Sam Altman: If you think about Grammarly of a company
[00:38:05] Sam Altman: that is completely fucked by AI, right?
[00:38:07] Sam Altman: So they're basically figuring out how to take what they have now
[00:38:10] Sam Altman: and like to do a bunch of acquisitions
[00:38:11] Sam Altman: they're trying to is my understanding.
[00:38:13] It's pretty smart.
[00:38:14] Jessica Thompson: It's pretty smart.
[00:38:15] Jessica Thompson: Guys, can we do an interlude news break
[00:38:17] Jessica Thompson: because there's some news?
[00:38:18] Jessica Thompson: Okay.
[00:38:18] Jessica Thompson: So we just, Nvidia earnings just came out.
[00:38:21] Jessica Thompson: Yep.
[00:38:22] Jessica Thompson: Up until the right folks, 60% is insane.
[00:38:25] Jessica Thompson: Party is not ending.
[00:38:28] It's just 5% after hours.
[00:38:30] Dave Nemeth: Okay.
[00:38:31] Jessica Thompson: So we'll shrug off that slump.
[00:38:33] But that was obvious.
[00:38:34] Dave Nemeth: I feel like there was no chance
[00:38:35] Dave Nemeth: that wasn't going to happen.
[00:38:36] Dave Nemeth: No chance.
[00:38:37] Sam Altman: You already know because all the companies
[00:38:39] Sam Altman: raised the money already.
[00:38:40] Sam Altman: Like the infrastructure spend has already been locked in.
[00:38:43] Sam Altman: Right?
[00:38:44] Sam Altman: Like it's not like, I don't know.
[00:38:45] Sam Altman: Like to me.
[00:38:46] Sam Altman: So what would you look at Sam
[00:38:47] Jessica Thompson: for your best indicator of bubble-ness in this world?
[00:38:51] Well, I think just look at the second derivative.
[00:38:52] Sam Altman: Right?
[00:38:53] Sam Altman: You can't look at like the infrastructure spend
[00:38:54] Sam Altman: because like that ship has already sailed in so many ways.
[00:38:56] Sam Altman: We're going to think about the holes
[00:38:57] Sam Altman: and rack of much servers, right?
[00:38:59] Sam Altman: And like raise a bunch of debt.
[00:39:00] Sam Altman: And we've already raised it.
[00:39:02] Sam Altman: I think looking at the rate of new debt offerings
[00:39:05] Sam Altman: or whatever it is,
[00:39:06] Sam Altman: that's going to be even more, I think, is interesting.
[00:39:09] Sam Altman: Because I think that's like,
[00:39:10] Sam Altman: the money that's already been raised is going to get spent.
[00:39:12] Sam Altman: And then two, I honestly think it's just
[00:39:14] Sam Altman: how well these companies are able to actually monetize it
[00:39:17] Sam Altman: or build on top of it.
[00:39:18] Sam Altman: Like that's what matters.
[00:39:19] Sam Altman: Like it's, we are getting back to business realities
[00:39:23] Sam Altman: and not fancy, fanciful stuff right now.
[00:39:25] Sam Altman: And like that's, I think we can have to.
[00:39:26] Sam Altman: Are we back to reality, though, Sam?
[00:39:28] Dave Nemeth: Because just my simple answer is,
[00:39:30] Dave Nemeth: I think we talked about this several pods as the debt, right?
[00:39:33] Dave Nemeth: Like as soon as I saw, I think it was meta
[00:39:37] Dave Nemeth: and a few others starting to lever up,
[00:39:40] Dave Nemeth: go way, way beyond their operating cash flow,
[00:39:42] Dave Nemeth: you know, every bubble that's ever really crashed,
[00:39:45] Dave Nemeth: everything is debt-related.
[00:39:47] Dave Nemeth: I think it's a little more complicated than this, Dave,
[00:39:50] Jessica Thompson: because basically, I mean, yes,
[00:39:52] Jessica Thompson: tech companies are changing their debt profile
[00:39:55] Jessica Thompson: and are tapping the debt markets in new ways.
[00:39:57] Jessica Thompson: But as someone who pushed this line of questioning
[00:40:01] Jessica Thompson: and was shot down by all my editors
[00:40:03] Jessica Thompson: who covered the financial crisis from the Wall Street Journal,
[00:40:06] Jessica Thompson: they assured me that all the ratios of like debt versus net cash
[00:40:10] Jessica Thompson: and all those kinds of things
[00:40:11] Jessica Thompson: as the tech companies are still very, very conservative.
[00:40:14] Jessica Thompson: Yeah, I think that's correct.
[00:40:15] Sam Altman: And that, yeah, it's a change, but it's certainly,
[00:40:20] Jessica Thompson: and these editors tend to be like, you know,
[00:40:23] Jessica Thompson: the first to call bubble scandal problem.
[00:40:26] Jessica Thompson: And on this one, they were like,
[00:40:28] Jessica Thompson: Siverdown, Jessica, there's no issue here yet.
[00:40:30] Jessica Thompson: But I think Sam's right.
[00:40:31] Dave Nemeth: Like if we continue to see the debt markets,
[00:40:34] Dave Nemeth: the activity growing, and we don't have good answers
[00:40:37] Dave Nemeth: to these other questions, which is what is the real
[00:40:40] Dave Nemeth: deprecation curve, sorry, depreciation curve
[00:40:43] Dave Nemeth: for a GPU of any kind?
[00:40:46] Dave Nemeth: Like what's the real useful life of these things?
[00:40:49] Dave Nemeth: And then how are they accounting for this?
[00:40:51] Dave Nemeth: And then is the business being built on top of this
[00:40:54] Dave Nemeth: infrastructure at the same speed?
[00:40:57] Dave Nemeth: I think these are like pretty real questions.
[00:40:59] Dave Nemeth: So if the debt continues to go up,
[00:41:01] Dave Nemeth: the revenue's not coming in as fast as I already thinks
[00:41:03] Dave Nemeth: that it is, and the depreciation's much faster
[00:41:06] Dave Nemeth: than it appears, then you've got a serious problem
[00:41:08] Dave Nemeth: on your hands.
[00:41:09] Dave Nemeth: Well, it's a depreciation is faster
[00:41:11] Sam Altman: that's fine for an Nvidia, then they set the somewhere
[00:41:13] Dave Nemeth: things.
[00:41:14] Yeah, it's fine for Nvidia, not for everybody else.
[00:41:17] Yeah, well, the question, Dave, which is still one
[00:41:19] Jessica Thompson: that we spent a lot of time thinking about is just like
[00:41:21] Jessica Thompson: who holds the what in the end, right?
[00:41:24] Jessica Thompson: Like, because yes.
[00:41:24] Jessica Thompson: Who holds the bag?
[00:41:25] Jessica Thompson: It sounds like crypto.
[00:41:27] Yes, okay, that's one piece of news.
[00:41:29] Jessica Thompson: Second piece of news, hot off the press from the information.
[00:41:32] Jessica Thompson: White House working on an exec order
[00:41:35] Jessica Thompson: that would foil state AI regulations.
[00:41:38] Jessica Thompson: So this is important.
[00:41:39] Jessica Thompson: We have to get people a little backstory here, right?
[00:41:40] Jessica Thompson: But meaning that states cannot pass individual
[00:41:43] Jessica Thompson: if this executive order went through
[00:41:46] Jessica Thompson: and was held up to be constitutional,
[00:41:48] Jessica Thompson: individual states could not regulate AI.
[00:41:50] Jessica Thompson: They should not be regulating AI.
[00:41:51] Sam Altman: It's an incredibly stupid idea, so sure.
[00:41:54] Jessica Thompson: Okay, Sam, make that case.
[00:41:55] Jessica Thompson: Wait, can you explain some examples
[00:41:57] Brie Larson: of what they're doing to regulate it?
[00:41:59] So there was a California bill that passed,
[00:42:02] Jessica Thompson: but was vetoed by Newsom, I think roughly,
[00:42:05] Jessica Thompson: I might have gotten the details of that wrong a year or so ago.
[00:42:09] Jessica Thompson: And it was part of, I mean, it's during the Biden administration.
[00:42:14] Jessica Thompson: And it was controversial among the models,
[00:42:17] Jessica Thompson: but inthropic kind of got on board and helped shape it.
[00:42:21] And I don't really remember the details,
[00:42:22] Jessica Thompson: but it was aggressive, right?
[00:42:24] Jessica Thompson: I mean, it was sort of putting up guardrails
[00:42:26] Jessica Thompson: around training models and all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:28] Jessica Thompson: Scott Weiner, who's running now for Nancy Pelosi's congressional seat
[00:42:32] Jessica Thompson: was a big lead on that bill.
[00:42:35] Jessica Thompson: But I mean, it obviously got vetoed by the governor.
[00:42:39] Jessica Thompson: But since then, I mean, California was also a first mover
[00:42:42] Jessica Thompson: on privacy legislation in the lines of Europe
[00:42:46] Jessica Thompson: that spurred away of other things.
[00:42:48] Jessica Thompson: So Sam, make the case.
[00:42:50] Jessica Thompson: I mean, I don't think you're a constitutional lawyer.
[00:42:53] Jessica Thompson: So there is that question.
[00:42:54] Jessica Thompson: But I've won awards for best non-lawyer performance
[00:42:58] Sam Altman: by a non-lawyer and a legal context.
[00:43:00] Sam Altman: But this does not seem like the realm.
[00:43:02] Jessica Thompson: This seems like within the realm of what states do.
[00:43:04] Jessica Thompson: But no, look, what are states are sub-scale things, right?
[00:43:09] Sam Altman: And like, yeah, California is the biggest one.
[00:43:11] Sam Altman: It's almost a size of Germany.
[00:43:12] Sam Altman: They can get away with more than most and try to.
[00:43:14] Sam Altman: But in the end of the day, you want Wyoming
[00:43:16] Sam Altman: with like 100,000 people, like having their own regulates
[00:43:18] Sam Altman: and incredibly stupid.
[00:43:19] Sam Altman: Well, but they regulate a lot of other things.
[00:43:21] Jessica Thompson: The big tension, the big tension and all this stuff
[00:43:24] Sam Altman: is actually the original idea of like the laboratory
[00:43:27] Sam Altman: of democracy and having states is they all
[00:43:29] Sam Altman: had their own economies and ran independently.
[00:43:32] Sam Altman: And so you'd experiment and they have local sovereignty.
[00:43:35] Sam Altman: At this point, there is nothing that's not interstate commerce
[00:43:38] Sam Altman: that we do.
[00:43:39] Sam Altman: And by the way, talk about interstate commerce.
[00:43:41] Sam Altman: You think AI is like, why are we
[00:43:43] Sam Altman: always not going to have its own AI, right?
[00:43:45] Sam Altman: It's like a national thing if not a global thing.
[00:43:47] Sam Altman: So I don't know, Sam, don't put it past Wyoming.
[00:43:50] Sam Altman: Love Wyoming.
[00:43:51] Sam Altman: I'm just saying.
[00:43:51] Sam Altman: I mean, I'm kind of down for Wyoming AI, by the way,
[00:43:55] Jessica Thompson: except for the guns and schools.
[00:43:57] Jessica Thompson: I don't like that.
[00:43:57] Jessica Thompson: The federal government does interstate commerce.
[00:44:00] Sam Altman: In what planet can you possibly think of this not
[00:44:03] Sam Altman: being interstate commerce?
[00:44:04] Sam Altman: I don't know.
[00:44:05] Sam Altman: So this was the discussion in our edit meeting today
[00:44:08] Jessica Thompson: was the definition of interstate commerce.
[00:44:10] Jessica Thompson: It's like, and if you don't think this is, by the way,
[00:44:12] Sam Altman: it's kind of in some ways, I'd actually
[00:44:14] Sam Altman: our unations are sub-scale for AI.
[00:44:16] Sam Altman: Like we now live in a globalized internet world.
[00:44:18] Sam Altman: So we have de-globalization going on with some sites
[00:44:22] Sam Altman: to commerce, little countries want sovereignty again.
[00:44:25] Sam Altman: Fine.
[00:44:26] Sam Altman: Fine.
[00:44:26] Sam Altman: That's all a big debate to have.
[00:44:27] Sam Altman: But the idea that you'd recurse that down,
[00:44:30] Sam Altman: the idea that you would recurse that down
[00:44:32] Sam Altman: and like Florida thinks they should have their own AI
[00:44:35] Sam Altman: regulation is just assinine.
[00:44:36] Sam Altman: OK.
[00:44:37] Jessica Thompson: Well, we'll see.
[00:44:38] Jessica Thompson: Exact order coming.
[00:44:39] Jessica Thompson: Doesn't mean they won't try.
[00:44:40] Sam Altman: I'm just, it just makes absolutely no sense.
[00:44:43] Sam Altman: What is interstate commerce in digital?
[00:44:45] Dave Nemeth: What is interstate commerce in digital?
[00:44:47] Sam Altman: Interstate commerce in atoms is very easy to understand.
[00:44:51] Dave Nemeth: Like you can't produce something, like I don't know,
[00:44:54] Dave Nemeth: good example or like cannabis markets in California.
[00:44:57] Dave Nemeth: Like you can't produce something in California
[00:44:59] Dave Nemeth: and send it across state lines, right?
[00:45:01] Dave Nemeth: Isn't porn like an example of interstate commerce?
[00:45:04] Brie Larson: No.
[00:45:05] Dave Nemeth: Sam?
[00:45:05] Dave Nemeth: I don't know about digital.
[00:45:06] Dave Nemeth: Like, can you, how do you state lines work in digital?
[00:45:11] Dave Nemeth: Yeah.
[00:45:11] Dave Nemeth: There's like, they block websites in certain states.
[00:45:14] Brie Larson: Look, there's also some, even the question of like,
[00:45:16] Sam Altman: how do you pay subscription taxes in different states?
[00:45:19] Sam Altman: It's really complicated.
[00:45:20] Sam Altman: And like most of, yeah, that's hard.
[00:45:22] Jessica Thompson: We do that and it's a nightmare.
[00:45:24] And like you do that.
[00:45:25] Sam Altman: Most people who want subscriptions don't even bother, right?
[00:45:27] Sam Altman: Because it's like, they can't, but it's like,
[00:45:28] Sam Altman: is that interstate commerce if I sell you a subscription
[00:45:31] Sam Altman: to my like, zine in like Florida?
[00:45:34] Sam Altman: That's like, yeah, like I sold to someone in Florida.
[00:45:37] Sam Altman: Like the bits went to Florida.
[00:45:39] Sam Altman: Like, I don't know.
[00:45:40] Sam Altman: But couldn't you put a server in Florida and have it subscribe?
[00:45:43] Dave Nemeth: The con, you sent the thing down to the server in Florida.
[00:45:46] Sam Altman: I don't know.
[00:45:47] Sam Altman: I just think you have to acknowledge the fact
[00:45:48] Sam Altman: the internet.
[00:45:49] Sam Altman: If I'm selling things across state lines,
[00:45:50] Sam Altman: and you clearly are for all this stuff,
[00:45:52] Sam Altman: it like you just should broadly say it's interstate commerce.
[00:45:55] Sam Altman: All right.
[00:45:56] Jessica Thompson: Okay, last headline.
[00:45:57] Jessica Thompson: I'll just go back.
[00:45:58] Sam Altman: Even if you didn't believe any of that,
[00:45:59] Sam Altman: the idea that you want 50 regulatory frameworks
[00:46:03] Sam Altman: in America for AI is a great way to lose, right?
[00:46:07] Sam Altman: I agree with that.
[00:46:08] Jessica Thompson: That's fair.
[00:46:09] Jessica Thompson: That's fair.
[00:46:09] Jessica Thompson: But we do in self-driving cars.
[00:46:11] Jessica Thompson: We do in pretty much everything else.
[00:46:12] Jessica Thompson: So that would be the,
[00:46:14] Jessica Thompson: Well, really, there are a few big states like California
[00:46:17] Sam Altman: and Europe who can like swing their, you know,
[00:46:19] Sam Altman: they're kind of big swinging dick states
[00:46:20] Sam Altman: that can kind of like try to have their own rules
[00:46:23] Sam Altman: because they're powerful enough and get away with it.
[00:46:25] Sam Altman: But as an matter of theoretical policy, it makes no sense.
[00:46:28] Sam Altman: Third headline.
[00:46:30] Jessica Thompson: Coinbase launching a prediction market.
[00:46:34] Well, aren't they just partnering with someone else
[00:46:35] Sam Altman: to do a quote, like,
[00:46:37] Sam Altman: Well, they're partnering with Calshy.
[00:46:39] Jessica Thompson: Calshy.
[00:46:40] Dave Nemeth: So is that just a distribution deal?
[00:46:41] Dave Nemeth: I mean, I think so.
[00:46:43] Brie Larson: And also it's unclear if it's exclusive, right?
[00:46:45] Brie Larson: But can you bet with crypto?
[00:46:46] Brie Larson: Is that what I'm doing?
[00:46:47] Brie Larson: I'm putting my Bitcoin up.
[00:46:49] Dave Nemeth: No, that's not how Calshy works.
[00:46:50] Dave Nemeth: Well, but are you always betting with crypto?
[00:46:53] Jessica Thompson: Like, no, no, that's a dollars.
[00:46:55] Dave Nemeth: No, I think Polly Market, like, I think the,
[00:46:58] Dave Nemeth: I think you like buy the option off chain
[00:47:00] Dave Nemeth: and then when it resolves, it resolves on chain.
[00:47:03] Dave Nemeth: Like, yeah, but there's an on chain resolution.
[00:47:06] I don't think that's how Calshy works though.
[00:47:08] Sam Altman: Oh, I'm not sure.
[00:47:10] Sam Altman: Look, in the end of the day,
[00:47:11] Sam Altman: like, everything becomes what it was set out to fight, right?
[00:47:14] Sam Altman: And like, there's no question that Coinbase
[00:47:16] Sam Altman: is becoming a financial service platform broadly.
[00:47:18] Sam Altman: They're not just doing crypto, like doing all the things.
[00:47:21] Sam Altman: Their community is the audience of crypto people,
[00:47:23] Sam Altman: which by the way, probably correlates with people
[00:47:25] Sam Altman: who do a bunch of stuff around prediction markets
[00:47:28] Sam Altman: and like that stuff.
[00:47:29] Sam Altman: And so it's like fine.
[00:47:31] Sam Altman: They should do that.
[00:47:32] Sam Altman: Who cares?
[00:47:33] Sam Altman: I mean, that's to me actually the main thing here,
[00:47:36] Dave Nemeth: which is that Coinbase and everything that's been going on
[00:47:39] Dave Nemeth: with meme coins and memetic finance
[00:47:42] Dave Nemeth: and people's desire to make bets on things
[00:47:45] Dave Nemeth: that are not basically non-financial,
[00:47:48] Dave Nemeth: you know, cultural elements and cultural trends
[00:47:51] Dave Nemeth: like these kinds of things.
[00:47:53] Dave Nemeth: Like this has been the currency of what the prediction markets
[00:47:57] Dave Nemeth: has risen upon.
[00:47:58] Dave Nemeth: And it's surprising to me actually that Coinbase didn't innovate
[00:48:02] Dave Nemeth: and add their own prediction market much faster.
[00:48:05] Dave Nemeth: And so the fact that they're having to partner with Calshy
[00:48:07] Dave Nemeth: is like, for what it's worth though,
[00:48:09] Sam Altman: I think like look, the whole prediction market idea
[00:48:11] Sam Altman: and like, it's like obviously an old one,
[00:48:14] Sam Altman: people have messing up a while.
[00:48:15] Sam Altman: So Calshy, like a lot of these companies
[00:48:17] Sam Altman: are actually fairly old and they've been around
[00:48:19] Sam Altman: in various forms for a while.
[00:48:21] Sam Altman: And they were the ones who had the balls
[00:48:22] Sam Altman: who do the regulatory work around this,
[00:48:24] Sam Altman: like last administration, right?
[00:48:26] Sam Altman: And so the reality is, they got the benefit
[00:48:29] Sam Altman: of having been around the hoop on this for so long
[00:48:31] Sam Altman: from the regulatory perspective that when it finally unlocked,
[00:48:34] Sam Altman: which really is like a Trump era phenomenon
[00:48:36] Sam Altman: that everyone's like, yeah, whatever, do it.
[00:48:38] Sam Altman: They're like pretty well positioned.
[00:48:39] Sam Altman: I think it's actually fairly hard to spin this stuff up.
[00:48:41] Sam Altman: So everyone likes the idea of them.
[00:48:43] Sam Altman: There was obviously really interesting stuff
[00:48:45] Sam Altman: going on culturally, but you got to hand it
[00:48:47] Sam Altman: to Polymarket Calshy and a few others.
[00:48:49] Sam Altman: You just like did the dog hard work of like staying
[00:48:52] Sam Altman: in the game regularly, long enough to survive
[00:48:55] Sam Altman: for the moment where they were now doable.
[00:48:57] Sam Altman: And then someone like, when is he's like, look,
[00:48:59] Sam Altman: it's gonna be fucking annoying and hard
[00:49:00] Sam Altman: to build this ourselves.
[00:49:02] Sam Altman: We probably wanted to five years ago,
[00:49:04] Sam Altman: but like it was just not a good thing for us to do
[00:49:06] Sam Altman: when we're trying to be a public company and serious
[00:49:08] Sam Altman: and whatever else.
[00:49:09] Sam Altman: And now like the moment's the moment.
[00:49:11] It's like stripe and stable coins.
[00:49:13] Jessica Thompson: And they just bought the way.
[00:49:14] Jessica Thompson: So what's the business deal of this partnership?
[00:49:16] Jessica Thompson: Are they getting like something?
[00:49:17] Brie Larson: Claire, and I think these really are
[00:49:19] Jessica Thompson: just distribution partnerships.
[00:49:21] Jessica Thompson: And it's also not clear they're exclusive.
[00:49:23] Jessica Thompson: I think Coinbase could easily work with Polymarket
[00:49:26] Jessica Thompson: and others too.
[00:49:26] Jessica Thompson: I think there must be business at stake.
[00:49:29] Dave Nemeth: Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
[00:49:30] Jessica Thompson: These are all good questions.
[00:49:31] Jessica Thompson: I thought maybe you smart people would know.
[00:49:33] Jessica Thompson: We're waiting for your reporting, Jess.
[00:49:34] Jessica Thompson: Other more interesting things that I've noticed
[00:49:36] Dave Nemeth: in my own behavior is I actually find it quite fun
[00:49:39] Dave Nemeth: to watch sports and then watch the curves on Colchey.
[00:49:42] Dave Nemeth: I find it more interesting than looking at the athletic anymore.
[00:49:45] Dave Nemeth: Are you saying that data is more interesting
[00:49:47] Jessica Thompson: than journalism, Dave?
[00:49:48] Jessica Thompson: What are you doing?
[00:49:49] Jessica Thompson: Well, no, sorry.
[00:49:50] Dave Nemeth: No, not the journalism.
[00:49:51] Dave Nemeth: Because by the way, the athletic does not do a good job
[00:49:55] Dave Nemeth: at real-time journalism of any kind.
[00:49:59] Dave Nemeth: I'm talking about the community feature of the athletic.
[00:50:02] Dave Nemeth: They have a feature where people sort of talk
[00:50:05] Dave Nemeth: about the game while the game's going on.
[00:50:07] Dave Nemeth: I've always enjoyed that feature.
[00:50:09] Dave Nemeth: But I find the Colchey stuff better.
[00:50:12] Dave Nemeth: And I think that's like an interesting thing going on right
[00:50:15] Dave Nemeth: now that the way that sports and this stuff interacts
[00:50:19] Dave Nemeth: is clearly exploding very, very quickly
[00:50:22] Dave Nemeth: and should be interesting to see where it goes.
[00:50:25] I got a resume for someone.
[00:50:27] Jessica Thompson: And on their resume, they were a writer
[00:50:30] Jessica Thompson: for sports-spending markets.
[00:50:34] And I keep meeting to look into like,
[00:50:37] Jessica Thompson: they just happen to work for a sports-spending publication.
[00:50:39] Jessica Thompson: Or is they are these journalists
[00:50:41] Jessica Thompson: like writing content tied somehow to the betting process?
[00:50:46] I mean, I would bet that it's just now an interesting story.
[00:50:49] Dave Nemeth: I guess that's what I'm trying to say
[00:50:50] Dave Nemeth: is the sports betting story that's going on
[00:50:53] Dave Nemeth: during every game is sufficiently interesting
[00:50:56] Dave Nemeth: to be paying attention to it.
[00:50:58] Dave Nemeth: Like, I actually quite enjoy watching the curves diverge
[00:51:02] Dave Nemeth: in the wrong direction, like effectively predicting
[00:51:04] Dave Nemeth: the game incorrectly while it's going on.
[00:51:08] That in itself is a story.
[00:51:10] Dave Nemeth: And that's kind of interesting.
[00:51:12] Yeah, what happens just watching the game?
[00:51:13] Jessica Thompson: But I hear you, Dave.
[00:51:15] Okay, guys, I want to end with a meme corner.
[00:51:17] Jessica Thompson: And I've got two memes to discuss, okay?
[00:51:20] Jessica Thompson: You guys have any memes to discuss?
[00:51:22] Brie Larson: I thought you're gonna say a meme coin.
[00:51:23] Brie Larson: I was getting excited, but we can do a meme corner.
[00:51:26] Brie Larson: We can do a meme, okay.
[00:51:28] Meme corner, you guys all know about six, seven.
[00:51:30] Brie Larson: No, what is it?
[00:51:32] Dave Nemeth: Oh, yeah, but it's kind of over.
[00:51:33] Brie Larson: It's over.
[00:51:35] Four, one now.
[00:51:36] Brie Larson: It's 41.
[00:51:36] Brie Larson: Four, one!
[00:51:38] Brie Larson: Jess, this was like a month ago.
[00:51:40] Brie Larson: Oh my God.
[00:51:41] Brie Larson: Britt, come on.
[00:51:42] Dave Nemeth: I didn't even know this.
[00:51:43] Brie Larson: Our kids taught us what, Dave, you didn't know this.
[00:51:45] Dave Nemeth: No.
[00:51:45] Dave Nemeth: Hilariously, life 360, where I'm on the board, put in,
[00:51:48] Brie Larson: there's a feature where you can just like press
[00:51:50] Brie Larson: instant reactions to people.
[00:51:51] Brie Larson: And for like a week, they put in six, seven as one.
[00:51:54] Brie Larson: And it was the most used thing ever.
[00:51:56] Brie Larson: And but then they were like, we have to retire it
[00:51:59] Brie Larson: because six, seven is dead now.
[00:52:01] Brie Larson: And it's 41.
[00:52:02] Brie Larson: It's the same.
[00:52:03] Brie Larson: Yeah.
[00:52:04] Dave Nemeth: What, six, seven was killed by parents being that
[00:52:07] Dave Nemeth: for Halloween.
[00:52:08] Brie Larson: It was killed by South Park.
[00:52:09] Brie Larson: It was killed by South Park.
[00:52:10] Dave Nemeth: All right.
[00:52:10] Dave Nemeth: Well, what's 41?
[00:52:12] Dave Nemeth: It's just a number, Dave.
[00:52:14] Brie Larson: It's just a meme.
[00:52:15] Dave Nemeth: It's just the next meme.
[00:52:16] Dave Nemeth: All right.
[00:52:17] It's also the age I will be next year for my next birthday party.
[00:52:21] Brie Larson: Oh my God, we're having a meme party.
[00:52:23] Jessica Thompson: But I'm going to have a 401 meme party.
[00:52:25] Jessica Thompson: As our eight year old pointed out, it's just not a satisfying
[00:52:29] Jessica Thompson: a meme because six, seven are next to each other.
[00:52:32] Jessica Thompson: So that happens, but like 401 don't happen in this naturally
[00:52:36] Jessica Thompson: occurring kind of harmony.
[00:52:38] Jessica Thompson: So, okay.
[00:52:40] Jessica Thompson: Last meme, Brett, have you been following the ladies
[00:52:44] Jessica Thompson: as San Francisco's dressing habits meme?
[00:52:47] Jessica Thompson: No.
[00:52:48] Jessica Thompson: What are we wearing these days, ladies of San Francisco?
[00:52:51] Jessica Thompson: Oh, no, no.
[00:52:51] Jessica Thompson: I'm going to butcher this or something.
[00:52:53] Jessica Thompson: But like, has Sam left the pod?
[00:52:56] Jessica Thompson: Has Sam left the pod?
[00:52:58] Jessica Thompson: No, I'm here.
[00:52:59] Jessica Thompson: Okay.
[00:53:00] Jessica Thompson: Sam, do you want to set this one up?
[00:53:01] Jessica Thompson: The Ackman thing?
[00:53:03] So Bill Ackman tweeted something.
[00:53:05] Sam Altman: What was it like dating advice?
[00:53:08] Sam Altman: May I meet you or something?
[00:53:09] Jessica Thompson: Oh yeah, the may I meet you thing.
[00:53:11] Sam Altman: What's the D-Jan males who follow him were like,
[00:53:14] Sam Altman: may I meet you?
[00:53:16] Sam Altman: And then like some attractive young women
[00:53:19] Sam Altman: like took this and ran with it on Twitter.
[00:53:21] Sam Altman: He started posting photos themselves,
[00:53:22] Sam Altman: like making like make SF hot again.
[00:53:24] Sam Altman: And so they're all posting pictures,
[00:53:25] Sam Altman: and looking dressed up.
[00:53:26] Sam Altman: And like there's a whole dating revolution-y thing
[00:53:30] Sam Altman: going on in the feeds.
[00:53:31] Sam Altman: I have no idea if it's real or not.
[00:53:32] Sam Altman: I will say one person has slow tweeted
[00:53:35] Sam Altman: out something along the lines that may I meet you.
[00:53:37] Sam Altman: And all these like women responded to him
[00:53:39] Sam Altman: and it was kind of fun to eat to watch.
[00:53:40] Sam Altman: But like, I don't, it's not my generation.
[00:53:42] Sam Altman: I don't really get it.
[00:53:43] Sam Altman: I know.
[00:53:44] Jessica Thompson: This is why I'm sort of stumbling on it.
[00:53:45] Jessica Thompson: But I feel like I'm improving my cred by mentioning it.
[00:53:48] Jessica Thompson: But so it's wear nice clothes in SF.
[00:53:52] So it went from may I meet you or can I meet you to, you know,
[00:53:56] Jessica Thompson: female techies posting nice looking pictures of themselves.
[00:54:00] Jessica Thompson: And now there's a backlash to the meme.
[00:54:02] Jessica Thompson: I think Sam started this trend.
[00:54:05] Yes, no, I think you did too.
[00:54:07] Jessica Thompson: I don't even I heard it.
[00:54:08] Dave Nemeth: And one of the creators of the meme
[00:54:10] Jessica Thompson: who I'm DMing with actually credits him.
[00:54:12] Jessica Thompson: Really?
[00:54:13] Jessica Thompson: That's very nice.
[00:54:14] Jessica Thompson: Yeah, Sam, this is very clearly directly related
[00:54:17] Dave Nemeth: to etiquette school.
[00:54:19] Dave Nemeth: Well, now I'm excited about it.
[00:54:20] Sam Altman: Guys, can we throw a party?
[00:54:21] Dave Nemeth: Let's throw a more or less party in the city
[00:54:24] Dave Nemeth: where you have to dress up to the nines.
[00:54:26] Dave Nemeth: Yeah, sure.
[00:54:27] Jessica Thompson: I'm there.
[00:54:28] Brit has to wear clothes.
[00:54:29] Jessica Thompson: That's all I said.
[00:54:30] Jessica Thompson: No, it was great.
[00:54:31] Jessica Thompson: That's great.
[00:54:32] Sam Altman: Who cares?
[00:54:33] Sam Altman: I didn't want to move it ever.
[00:54:34] Sam Altman: They want.
[00:54:35] Sam Altman: I was going to say Brit looks fabulous.
[00:54:37] Jessica Thompson: That's spray-ted.
[00:54:37] Jessica Thompson: Your legs lady.
[00:54:39] Jessica Thompson: Pretty amazing.
[00:54:40] Jessica Thompson: I can say that because I'm a woman.
[00:54:43] I can say that because I'm her husband.
[00:54:45] Jessica Thompson: There you go.
[00:54:46] Jessica Thompson: I guess I can say that.
[00:54:47] Dave Nemeth: But now go for it, Sam.
[00:54:50] Jessica Thompson: The latest turn in the meme is it's cold in San Francisco.
[00:54:53] Jessica Thompson: So now the meme is you post pictures
[00:54:57] Jessica Thompson: of your nice clothes.
[00:54:58] Jessica Thompson: But then you wear nice clothes in SF,
[00:55:02] but you can't be in denial in the words of one source
[00:55:05] Jessica Thompson: about how cold and damp it is.
[00:55:07] Jessica Thompson: You need a puffer jacket, a fleece, vest, pants, layers.
[00:55:10] Jessica Thompson: That's complete bullshit.
[00:55:12] Sam Altman: There are cities like New York where women dress
[00:55:13] Sam Altman: very nicely that are much colder.
[00:55:15] Sam Altman: So I call bullshit.
[00:55:18] Sam Altman: Now, if you want to get, if the people need to get
[00:55:20] Sam Altman: like a nice outerwear coat that they can then take off
[00:55:23] Sam Altman: in the very well air condition, whatever is fine.
[00:55:26] Sam Altman: OK, well, I just want the people, the listeners to know
[00:55:29] Jessica Thompson: if you see these memes, feel free post a picture of yourself
[00:55:32] Jessica Thompson: in the next.
[00:55:33] Jessica Thompson: Yeah, look forward to the more or less party.
[00:55:36] Dave Nemeth: It's going to be.
[00:55:37] Dave Nemeth: Sam, is there an etiquette update of the week
[00:55:39] Jessica Thompson: before we send our dear viewers on their way?
[00:55:41] Jessica Thompson: Well, I will say we're publishing
[00:55:43] Sam Altman: which you guys will all receive the slow ventures first guide
[00:55:47] Sam Altman: to etiquette book, which is actually coming along quite nicely.
[00:55:52] Sam Altman: I love that this SF standard was doing memes about etiquette school.
[00:55:56] Dave Nemeth: So the book is, that was great.
[00:55:58] Sam Altman: I love those memes.
[00:55:59] Sam Altman: So yeah, the book is coming along nicely.
[00:56:00] Sam Altman: It'll be given at it or holiday party in a first version.
[00:56:05] Sam Altman: But I would say that if you guys would like to contribute
[00:56:08] Sam Altman: any points of etiquette to the first etiquette book,
[00:56:11] Sam Altman: we're working on them now.
[00:56:12] Sam Altman: And we have some, you know, I think it's actually going to be quite good.
[00:56:14] Sam Altman: So I'm not joking that I think I should run your Women's
[00:56:17] Brie Larson: etiquette program.
[00:56:19] Brie Larson: I don't think it.
[00:56:20] Brie Larson: You know, I volunteered.
[00:56:22] Jessica Thompson: It was pretty much shut down.
[00:56:24] Jessica Thompson: I think he thinks he's got it.
[00:56:25] Jessica Thompson: I think you should do it together.
[00:56:27] Dave Nemeth: That's not true.
[00:56:28] Sam Altman: You guys, I'm more than happy.
[00:56:30] Sam Altman: This is a collaborative.
[00:56:31] Sam Altman: A lot of the best very well-known female executives
[00:56:36] Sam Altman: of San Francisco reached out asking for a women's program
[00:56:38] Sam Altman: and asking to run it or be part of it.
[00:56:40] Sam Altman: I would love to see a great thing to come together.
[00:56:42] Sam Altman: And I think it's needed.
[00:56:43] Sam Altman: I think it's needed.
[00:56:44] Sam Altman: Well, why wouldn't you have your wife and your podcast co-host run that?
[00:56:47] Brie Larson: You guys, I'm solely.
[00:56:48] Sam Altman: We just know Queens.
[00:56:50] Sam Altman: Here's my thing.
[00:56:51] Sam Altman: I need coming in with an executable plan.
[00:56:54] Sam Altman: Because you guys are great.
[00:56:54] Sam Altman: We can do this.
[00:56:55] Sam Altman: But who are your boots on the ground?
[00:56:57] Sam Altman: If we have a whole calendar of etiquette we're building.
[00:57:01] Sam Altman: And if you want to do a Women's SF event, I think absolutely.
[00:57:04] Sam Altman: We just need to pull.
[00:57:05] Sam Altman: We need the boots.
[00:57:06] Sam Altman: You're looking at Brit Moran who just put Coachella on for her 40th birthday.
[00:57:11] Jessica Thompson: Fine.
[00:57:12] Sam Altman: If this is it.
[00:57:13] Sam Altman: I don't want to have to apply, Sam.
[00:57:14] Brie Larson: I want to know that I was nominated by you.
[00:57:16] Brie Larson: And then I'll put together my plan.
[00:57:18] Brie Larson: I just, if you're going to do it, it has to be full-send.
[00:57:22] Sam Altman: We're going broke.
[00:57:23] Sam Altman: I'm going to do a small model.
[00:57:24] Sam Altman: But this is not a franchise because we need to control quality.
[00:57:27] Sam Altman: And the thing is, I totally into it.
[00:57:29] Sam Altman: You were at my birthday.
[00:57:31] Brie Larson: Who's great?
[00:57:32] Sam Altman: I would say, yeah, I'm in.
[00:57:34] Sam Altman: But you got to pick a date.
[00:57:35] Sam Altman: We got to have a schedule.
[00:57:36] Sam Altman: We got to work it.
[00:57:37] Brie Larson: Well, who's your coordinator?
[00:57:38] Brie Larson: Tell me that I'm in and then let's fucking do it.
[00:57:40] Brie Larson: All right.
[00:57:41] Brie Larson: Fine.
[00:57:42] Sam Altman: I'll start it for that right now.
[00:57:43] Sam Altman: We're going to do fan etiquette.
[00:57:44] Brie Larson: Fan etiquette.
[00:57:45] Brie Larson: Okay.
[00:57:46] Brie Larson: Me and you.
[00:57:47] Brie Larson: I got it.
[00:57:48] Sam Altman: To be clear, I want to be clear that the program we're running is for both men and women
[00:57:51] Sam Altman: and the etiquette applies broadly.
[00:57:53] Sam Altman: If there's a separate section, there's more.
[00:57:57] Sam Altman: But I think, look, we include all sections need to be open to everyone.
[00:58:00] Sam Altman: Sure.
[00:58:01] Brie Larson: But we should have breakouts for sure, because there are some things we can only say to other
[00:58:05] Brie Larson: girls.
[00:58:06] Sam Altman: I will say in the book, for instance, there are, we, that we're developing, there are
[00:58:09] Sam Altman: things I'm actually curious to get your take on as women.
[00:58:12] So there are several points of respecting traditional etiquette.
[00:58:16] Sam Altman: There's a whole section on this includes whole doors for women, stand at the table when
[00:58:20] Sam Altman: we come.
[00:58:21] Sam Altman: There's stuff that is gendered in the etiquette book.
[00:58:24] Sam Altman: So I'm going to curious what your take is on that.
[00:58:26] Edicates gendered.
[00:58:27] Jessica Thompson: I have no problem with that.
[00:58:28] Jessica Thompson: Edicates is, that's good.
[00:58:29] Sam Altman: I like it.
[00:58:30] Brie Larson: But my etiquette to women founders would be actually to like pump themselves up a little
[00:58:34] Brie Larson: bit more.
[00:58:35] Brie Larson: Like I, there's a lot with body posture, tone, not ending questions like this.
[00:58:41] Brie Larson: Like just like so much about communication.
[00:58:43] Brie Larson: I took bread on a date last night to San Francisco to the stereophonic play and I opened all
[00:58:48] Dave Nemeth: the doors for her.
[00:58:49] Dave Nemeth: There you go.
[00:58:50] Brie Larson: Is there a kind of view day?
[00:58:52] Brie Larson: Okay.
[00:58:53] Jessica Thompson: Well, people, the news is hopping.
[00:58:55] The news is hopping.
[00:58:56] Jessica Thompson: The meetings are flowing.
[00:58:57] Jessica Thompson: We must do our day jobs.
[00:58:59] Jessica Thompson: A very again, a round of applause for Brichella.
[00:59:03] Jessica Thompson: Brit, you were so busy.
[00:59:05] Jessica Thompson: I did not want to hand you your birthday present, which right here.
[00:59:09] Jessica Thompson: So I brought it all over.
[00:59:10] Jessica Thompson: Did they reveal right now?
[00:59:11] Jessica Thompson: Oh, I brought it all over.
[00:59:13] Jessica Thompson: It's actually, I'll show you here.
[00:59:16] Jessica Thompson: I was going to unbox one of them.
[00:59:19] They were so nicely wrapped.
[00:59:20] Jessica Thompson: Oh my gosh, with rainbow wrap.
[00:59:22] Jessica Thompson: You know me too.
[00:59:23] Brie Larson: I'm going to see you.
[00:59:24] Jessica Thompson: Oh, it might be at the show.
[00:59:26] Jessica Thompson: They're all different.
[00:59:27] Jessica Thompson: They're all different.
[00:59:28] Jessica Thompson: By the way, speaking about the kit.
[00:59:29] It's okay.
[00:59:30] Yeah, with that dear friends, we will see you again here next week for another episode
