[00:00:00] Google seems to be ramping up the engine
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_04: on monetizing these shit out of it in 18 different ways,
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_04: which is what you get to do when you have a freight train,
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_04: right, like Google that can put it everywhere
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_04: with the tech team all the way down to TPUs.
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_04: Like, they're gonna make money everywhere.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_04: Sing them Microsoft.
[00:00:16] Why hello friends, welcome to more or less.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_03: We've got a really exciting jam packed episode.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_03: There's so much to discuss.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_03: First off, dear God,
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_05: Brie, Chella, Brie, how are you four days later still here?
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_03: Like how are you recovered?
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_03: You look like fresh faced.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: It's the spray tan.
[00:01:04] I told you Sam, didn't I?
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_02: Didn't I say?
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_02: I got a spray tan.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_02: I told you spray tan.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_02: I had very little clothing on that night.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_02: I needed to have consistency of skin.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_02: You look great.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_02: What was the workout routine leading up to the Brittany
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_04: bitch performance?
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_04: A lot of hot yoga.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_02: I did some dance lessons and peptides.
[00:01:25] That wasn't workout.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_02: We're going to break down.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_03: We are going to break down the content.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_03: We need to tell people what Brie, Chella is.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_03: That's not going to break it down.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_03: I'm going to do like a tear down of Brie, Chella.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_03: OK, I'm ready.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_03: So as we all know, we're celebrating the 40th birthday
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_03: of Brie, Moring.
[00:01:41] And there's a lot of energetic Coachella
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_03: vibe in the invite.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_03: So you kind of know what to expect
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_03: to wear a certain color based on where you met Brie.
[00:01:52] But I would say this was a, I think we made it through four
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_03: or five hours.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_03: How long did the whole thing go?
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_03: Oh, the whole thing was five hours.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_03: OK, so we made it through four hours.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_02: It was.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_05: I thought it was four.
[00:02:05] Seven to midnight.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:02:07] Of the Brit spectacular.
[00:02:10] But you missed the best last hour.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_02: I missed the best last hour.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_03: Performances galore from acrobatics, cover bands,
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_03: and from our very own Britney Spears in a red latex jumpsuit,
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_03: which is definitely my highlight of the evening.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_02: Brit took the stage.
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_02: Little did you know, when I was 16 years old,
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_02: I was actually recruited to be a Britney Spears impersonator
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_02: by a company called Celebrity Twins.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_02: And this isn't her peak Britney era
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_02: when she was dating Justin and hadn't gone crazy yet.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_02: So this was like the perfect full circle moment of my life
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_02: to come out and perform oops, I did it again in the red cat suit
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_02: with the long blonde hair, with the choreography,
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_02: and of course, with Leonardo DiCaprio
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_02: as the male counterpart.
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_02: This would be Sam's highlight of the night, I think.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_03: But we're going to take turns.
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_03: Sam, what's your highlight?
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_03: I did my highlight is I got a picture with Leonardo DiCaprio,
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_04: but I was the homeless guy and he was in a tux.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_04: It was great.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_04: It was like my exact, it was great.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_04: I thought that I was really funny.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_04: So I can't adjust like, you know,
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_03: he was on the street for this event.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_03: Well, I've never been to Coachella.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_04: And I think as a male, you're supposed to dress like a hobo
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_04: at Coachella, right?
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_04: Right?
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_05: Is that where the idea came from?
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_05: The idea came from the Hillsdale Mall three hours earlier.
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_03: Let's be honest.
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_03: To Suburbia on weekends, but just going to, like,
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_04: twice a year, we'll end up in Suburbia.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_04: And we go to the mall and just walks up and down
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_04: and talks about getting our ears pierced
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_04: because apparently as we do at the mall.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_04: And then I went to Sephora with her.
[00:03:51] I made Sam, I gave him the Sephora experience.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_03: I bought a homeless person's hat,
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_04: but I bought it at Banana Republic,
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_04: which is where homeless people shop.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_04: I don't really know.
[00:04:02] What you guys missed though, after the Britney performance,
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_02: was this dance troupe called Light Balance,
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_02: that one America's Got Talent, we made everything black.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_02: So the whole venue got pitch black.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_02: And these five dancers came out with these LED outfits on
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_02: and just crushed this, like, 15 minute performance
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_02: of, like, a medley of awesome songs
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_02: and insane dances all in the dark, like, glowing.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_02: And then after that, we had the real, not a cover band,
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_02: Kesha, straight out of the 90s and early 2000s,
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: things like TikTok, your love is my drug, et cetera,
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_02: perform.
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_02: She was pouring whiskey down people's throats.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_02: She accidentally splashed me in the eye,
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_02: pouring champagne down my throat.
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_02: Well, I saw that you sent us a sizzle reel.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_03: So I'm gonna watch the sizzle reel.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_02: Watch this sizzle reel to catch up on what you missed
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_02: because you definitely missed the grand finale.
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_04: I do think you missed an opportunity,
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_04: which would have been to have, like, an impersonator,
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_04: Kesha with Kesha, or better yet,
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_04: have Kesha play an impersonator of Kesha.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_04: I don't know if Kesha would have done it.
[00:05:10] These pop stars are kind of divas, you know?
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_02: They have to have it their way.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_02: Do you basically just, like, call Kesha's manager
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_03: and you're, like, come to my party?
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_02: I actually randomly know Kesha.
[00:05:21] We've known her for the last few years.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: She's also a proud Aspen Institute
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_02: Henry Crown fellow, just like me, different class.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_02: Oh, there we go.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: And she actually has a lot of new startup music stuff
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_02: going on that we've been helping her out with on the side.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_02: So.
[00:05:36] And she lives in Marin part of the year.
[00:05:38] I love it.
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_02: Okay, Dave, you're high life.
[00:05:41] I mean, it's pretty amazing.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_05: I was to see your wife do a performance of this magnitude.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_05: I think, Brett, you're fearless.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_05: I think I would have been terrified,
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_05: particularly in that little of clothing.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_05: I would need to work out much longer.
[00:05:58] I think we would have been terrified to see you
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_04: in that little of clothing.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_05: I know.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_05: That's what I'm saying.
[00:06:03] You would definitely need a spray tan.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_02: All night, you were rocking a very hot outfit,
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_03: very short shorts, no shorts, basically underwear.
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_03: Let's call it what it was.
[00:06:14] That's fascinating because I'll be honest with you, Dave.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_04: I had no idea what you were wearing,
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_04: but apparently you made it impression on my wife.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_04: Oh no, she's talking about my outfit.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_02: But wait, Jess, did you miss my outfit change?
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_02: I think you missed my outfit change.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_02: It got worse.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no.
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_02: I saw the red what you changed after the red.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_02: Oh, Jess, oh my gosh.
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to watch the sizzle.
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_02: You missed the grand finale, including my grand finale outfit.
[00:06:39] It was basically borderline.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_02: This thing is all fringe, but very little fringe.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_02: And it was covering all the parts,
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_02: but I needed the spray tan.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_02: Is this in the sizzle reel?
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_02: I'm dancing on stage with Kesha in the sizzle reel.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_02: Oh, and then just look at the photo booth.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_02: We'll get you the media.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_03: OK, OK, we'll get it.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_03: But Dave, you're highlight.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_03: And Dave, you also look fabulous.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_03: You were fully covered, though.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I was.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_05: I loved light balance.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_05: They were truly amazing.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_05: I knew about all this stuff ahead of time,
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_05: but they were awesome on the internet.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_05: You should go look up their YouTube videos
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_05: if you're listening.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_05: These guys are super impressive.
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_05: And I also know now what my 2026 Halloween costume is going to be.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_05: Well, I was just like, you know what?
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_04: Richella actually did a very important thing for me,
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_04: which is I have been searching for a new athletic goal
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_04: because I get very sad when I don't have an athletic goal.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_04: I just like, I'm like a puppy.
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_04: You don't really get very depressed.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_04: Oh.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_04: And I think that Richella inspired me.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_04: I'm thinking it's going to be some sort of gymnastics routine,
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_04: like a floor routine, or maybe rings.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_05: Oh, interesting.
[00:07:48] That guy was real rare.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_02: Wait, so you're going to swap out the mountain climbing?
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_05: Are you going to swap the mountain climbing for rings?
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_05: I'm going to swap.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_05: I'll just do both.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_04: But I just think like if my goal for 2026
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_04: was to have like a sick, like Simone Biles style,
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_04: either like rings or vault or floor routine,
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_04: I was thinking like in a worst case,
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_04: it could be rhythmic gymnastics with the streamers.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_04: But like, I want to be able to do like flips
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_04: in a floor routine or something.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_04: But it was because I looked at your gymnastics people.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_04: I was like, those people are pretty impressive.
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_04: They're super ripped.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, the amount of strength.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_05: One girl's not even, well, she's ripped,
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_02: but she also hung by her hair on a giant like trapeze.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_02: That was crazy.
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_02: Not I don't need to go.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_02: I saw that at the Balienist farm stand
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_03: once, very strange, very strange.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_03: The physics of it must be more chill than it seems.
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_05: Well, there's multiple things in her.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_03: Because you know, I can get into this emotion.
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_03: But I think we can just say,
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_03: but I hope you're feeling very proud.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_03: I also think everyone now I've gone up to them
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_03: and they could say, couldn't come or they were out of town.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_03: I said, you know, it just is was the most authentically
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_03: Brit celebration of Brit there could be.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_03: And I think there's like no better achievement
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_03: for to celebrate yourself.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_03: So I hope everyone out there thinks for them
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_03: what would be the most authentic way to celebrate.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_03: They're essence.
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_03: And that was amazing.
[00:09:13] The other thing I'll say is that I think
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_05: Brit's had the Brit and Co era creativity
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_05: in a bottle for too many years.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_05: And I was happy to see it explode back into the real world.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_05: And I hope that this is not the end
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_05: and that you keep doing these amazing things
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_05: in the real world.
[00:09:30] I've got a 50th and eight years.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_02: What are you doing?
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_02: I'm happy to plan it.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_02: Just get me a good budget and be okay with color and weird shit.
[00:09:38] Yeah, I think I mean, the not surprisingly thing
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_03: would surprise no one to know that my essence
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_03: would not be Britella.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_03: Yours would be like a typewriter at every seat.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_02: And we're all gonna write our own poetry about Jess.
[00:09:54] No, what I did for my 40th, which I was reflecting.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_03: It was a real night of reflection
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_03: because it was such a special celebration.
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_03: I think I kind of nailed mine,
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_03: which was making all my friends surf in Mexico for three days.
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_03: That was kind of my essence forcing them to get on the water.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_03: But anyway, it was amazing.
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_03: It took San Francisco by storm.
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_03: People are still talking about it and props to you on the content.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_03: You like published basically a newsletter of content
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_03: based on your party that now I have to consume.
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_03: And it was wonderful.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_03: So I mean, there's really,
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_03: there's no great way to segue into the week.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_03: Other than guys, can I read, download Instagram right now?
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_03: Oh, did you go seven days?
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_03: Wait, tell us about your learning.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_02: She really did go seven days.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_05: I can just ask.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_05: I mean, I don't, I don't have it.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_03: It seems too short.
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_05: I feel like you should double down.
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_05: Keep going.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_05: Here are my lessons.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_03: I hate the phrase learnings.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_03: It's such a jankony term.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_03: That's right.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_03: First of all, Instagram is confused.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_03: They are sending me so many emails to probably to log back in
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_03: and read my unread DMs that I have definitely tripped
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_03: some algorithm where, well, they're very worried about me.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_03: So thank you, Instagram.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_03: I'm fine.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_03: I'm here.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_03: There were many moments like Brachella.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_03: I was really happy I didn't have Instagram
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_03: because I didn't even think about my fun.
[00:11:15] And even my kids birthday.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_03: And so I think the lesson is to kind of remember that, actually.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_03: And it really does change my experience of it.
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_03: Like every time you popped up in a new outfit,
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_03: I didn't have to take a photo and post an Instagram.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_03: But if I could have, my body would have wanted to.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_03: I would have had to stop myself.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_05: Isn't it interesting?
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_05: And I just felt none of that.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_03: I actually walked out without my purse.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_03: I totally forgot.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_03: I had to go back and get my purse
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_03: because my phone was such not a part of my experience.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_03: So I think both things can be true.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_03: And I look forward to DMing people, memes, and Instagram,
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_03: and catching up on the goss and posting fun stuff.
[00:11:59] But I don't want to lose that, like, put the phone away thing.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_03: That was pretty good.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_03: Jess, could you have a dumb phone?
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_03: Would that be a good next step?
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_03: But I've got some of those.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_04: I also have a novel phone.
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_04: But I think it's your friend, Dr. Becky, who says this,
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_03: which I take to heart.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_03: She's always like, kids don't have a technology problem.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_03: Parents have a boundary problem.
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_03: I think that's her point.
[00:12:22] And yeah, and then people have boundary problems
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_03: with technology, right?
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_03: Like, and so I actually think, I think I'm strong enough
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_03: to not have to quit cold turkey, but we'll see.
[00:12:35] But let's see how strong my boundaries are.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_03: And if they're just certain things where I'm deliberately,
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_03: like, this is a phone off kind of thing.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_03: Now, the problem is it's also my camera, so that...
[00:12:46] Yeah, that's the trodden horse.
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_04: Everyone needs a camera.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_04: And like, I've tried buying standalone cameras as a solution.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_04: But honestly, the iPhone camera is just so good.
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_04: It's like, that's what keeps you going.
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_04: It doesn't work.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_04: So anyway, sorry guys, I'm just luging back in here
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_03: to see what I missed.
[00:13:04] In the middle of the pod.
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_05: Couple dozen DMs.
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_02: I feel like I saw photos of Wilders' birthday.
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_02: Was that from Sam's account?
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I posted those.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_04: Oh, I can report about the Facebook
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_03: and how it's doing guys.
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_03: The Facebook.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_04: She needed to post somewhere.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_04: Well, it coincided with my mom's birthday,
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_03: my dad's birthday, and my youngest birthday.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_03: And I do feel the need to post a nice photo on the birthdays.
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_03: You know?
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_03: So what was a girl to do?
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_03: Well, the big blue app was there.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_03: It still works just for those who haven't been in a while.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_03: I don't know how it's going.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_03: But yeah, that was sort of my experience.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_03: But there were other options.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_03: I think my ex-use.
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_03: My ex-use, one up a little.
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_03: You know?
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_03: So we'll see.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_03: I'm sure everyone's dying for these periodic updates.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_03: I'll let people know, Dave, how are you doing on your?
[00:13:53] Well, it's interesting that you did this this week
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_05: because I redownloaded Instagram two weeks ago
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_05: because there's a project that I'm working on
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_05: that I wanted to look for some examples of that project.
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_05: And so for a week, I was like actually having kind of the opposite,
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_05: well, I guess, yeah, the opposite experience of you,
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_05: which is I've been off it for I'd even know now almost a year.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_05: And for the first three days, I was like, oh, I can handle this.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_05: I've, like, detrained my brain from this.
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_05: But within three or maybe four days,
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_05: I was finding myself just like in these rabbit holes,
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_05: mostly around daft punk returning.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_05: You know, there's like these weird interesting glints
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_05: that daft punk might return.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_05: And so I like looked at a few things there
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_05: and then my whole feed became,
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_05: didn't they perform without the helmet or some shit?
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_05: One of the guys did.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_05: One of the guys did.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_05: Anyway, but I've ended up in these like weird rabbit holes,
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_05: like learning more about the history of daft punk
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_05: than I should even care about,
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_05: even though they are probably my number one band.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_05: But like, I've just like ended up in a lot of these sort of places
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_05: that I realized like I didn't even intend to get to.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_05: And so I've re-deleted it because I was just like,
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_05: my mind is getting occupied by things
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_05: that don't matter to my every day.
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_05: And so it's an interesting, yeah, it's an interesting experience.
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_05: Meanwhile, did you guys see this week TikTok
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_02: has an affirmation journal feature?
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_02: And also they are trying to give you badges now
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_02: for controlling your TikTok usage
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_02: and doing screen time management.
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_02: Does anyone believe this is really going to happen?
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:15:26] No.
[00:15:27] Is this a marketing campaign?
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_02: It's like the badge is going to be like,
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_04: if you do, if you control yourself,
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_04: if you're a badge, it just says loser.
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_04: There's like one badge where if you complete your sleep hours mission
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_02: by avoiding using TikTok at night,
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_02: you get then you get that one.
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_02: Or you can use a meditation tools feature to get a badge.
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_02: So you're meditating more.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_02: I love it because it's like if you were writing
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_04: like a satirical science fiction,
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_04: this is exactly what I would release.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_04: It's like, hey, you know, we should really like badge,
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_04: we're gonna like give people cocaine
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_04: and then like release badges for having cocaine
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_04: on your nightstand, but not taking it.
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_04: Exactly.
[00:16:06] I mean, that's basically what TikTok and Instagram do.
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_05: It's like the tools aren't actually good at this.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_05: I'd say the TikTok years and years ago
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_04: because I liked it too much briefly during COVID.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_04: I thought it was like too good.
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_04: And I was like, this is, what's funny for me
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_04: is I re-downloaded it.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_04: And it has completely forgotten anything I'm interested in.
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_04: And so I actually find TikTok
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_04: has to be kind of shitty for me
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_04: because it doesn't know me at all.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_04: Whereas Instagram reals is just hilarious.
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_04: So it's like funny.
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_04: It's like I buy D-trained TikTok to the point
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_04: that TikTok isn't interesting.
[00:16:38] I guess Sam, that's kind of my point also about Instagram.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_05: Like I hadn't interacted with it in so long
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_05: that it like was like, didn't know anything about me anymore.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_05: And I like interacted once with Daff Punk.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_05: And so now it's like all Daff Punk
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_05: and nothing else that I'm interested in.
[00:16:52] Okay, guys, we're gonna wrap up social media and go to AI.
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_03: So any final point on that?
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_03: Well, Jess, I think one of the more interesting things
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_05: to maybe talk about for a minute here
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_05: is that like in the world of seed investing,
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_05: there is a lot of social going on right now.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_05: Like I'm getting hit with,
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_05: I'm probably getting hit with, I don't know.
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_05: I mean, probably three,
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_05: I always think of like how many founder meetings
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_05: that I end up in in a five day window.
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_05: And there's been like,
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_05: not a 996 venture capital is they've absolutely not.
[00:17:26] What is the VC ratio?
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_03: Is it?
[00:17:29] It's like a one, two, three.
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_05: It depends on what deals are happening.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_02: One, two, three in no August.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_05: I don't know.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_02: I've worked on so many holidays
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_02: that we're really chasing something.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_02: But we at least get to pretend, Britt.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_02: We know.
[00:17:45] We haven't made it yet, I guess.
[00:17:47] There is a lot of interesting social going on.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_05: And I actually think the most interesting social thing
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_05: happening in the last week
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_05: is that chat GPT launched group chats
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_05: in a bunch of obscure countries.
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_05: And I kind of look at this and I'm like,
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_05: I think I said this on a previous pod
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_05: that like this was by far the most obvious thing
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_05: to do in social with AI.
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_05: And it's like absolutely shocking to me
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_05: that Meta did not do this first
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_05: because it's like really, really obvious.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_05: Can you give an example?
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_03: I don't know if I can use it.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_03: I haven't.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_03: So like I'm planning a trip.
[00:18:23] Let's say the four of us are planning a surfing trip
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_05: and we want to go somewhere new
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_05: that we've never been before.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_05: We created a group chat
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_05: and chat GPT is in the chat with us
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_05: and is answering questions.
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, like this is like not rocket science.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_05: So it's chat outside.
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_03: It works even if, I mean, the chat is in the chat
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_03: but you don't have to chat about your chat GPT.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_03: I'm not questioning the chat so many chats
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_03: in that sentence, just.
[00:18:51] So the construct of the chat is still the people
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_03: not the topic.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_05: Yeah. And so what does this say?
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_05: Well, like to me, this has always been
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_05: like the obvious direction
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_05: and the very strategically dangerous direction
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_05: that chat GPT was going to go in,
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_05: which is, you know, now your friends
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_05: are in the left rail with you
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_05: along with all of your chats
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_05: and you can, you know, talk to chat GPT
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_05: along with your friends and all these kinds of things.
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_05: Like this was like going to happen.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_05: I think maybe it was a cost-pertokin thing
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_05: that was the gating factor.
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_05: But I think it's a pretty big deal.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_05: And I think that it's going to heat up
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_05: the battle between particular meta and open AI
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_05: like pretty dramatically.
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_04: One of them has, you put, you put the AI in the chat
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_04: and the other you put the people in the AI.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_04: Exactly.
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_04: Well, also Apple and Google
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_02: because chat is just texting and yeah.
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_02: But look, in the end of the day,
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_04: this story of AI is because obviously Google
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_04: with Gemini3 has now taken the lead
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_04: and like open AI is looking pretty freaky
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_04: from my perspective.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, absolutely agree on that.
[00:19:58] Hey, who called Google in the beginning?
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_02: Just saying a say it.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_02: All right, keep going Sam.
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_02: For it definitely called it.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_05: And I'll tell you my thing is I called,
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_04: I think two or three weeks ago,
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_04: it's like the only stock I wish I owned I don't is Google.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_04: You've said that every, hard for the last two months.
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_03: Every day I watch it go up and I'm like,
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_04: I started buying Google.
[00:20:16] Because I can't figure out a strategy.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_04: No, I know, here's the problem.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_04: You have to do it with like a ton of leverage, right?
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_04: Because there's two big company.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_04: Like you're betting on it adding a few trillion in market cap.
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_04: You're not betting on a 10 or 100 X thing.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_04: The problem is you put even a few million bucks in
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_04: at a few trillion dollar evaluation who cares.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_04: Like in the other end, it's not worth it.
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_04: Like risk reward.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_04: But so the whole strategy I'm trying to figure out,
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_04: I'm not an expert at this is what is the right way
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_04: to go long Google, but short QQQ or figure out?
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_04: Because like you don't all I'm willing to bet
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_04: is that Google is a send in and has like six things going on
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_04: and they're going to crush it relative to technology.
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_04: But I do not have any opinion about what QQQ
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_04: or the NASDAQ or the Mag 7 looks like.
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_04: And I do not want to be exposed to that
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_04: because I think that there's a very good chance
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_04: we ended up 30%, 40% drawout.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_04: So how do you do that?
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_04: By the way, I've had some interesting conversations
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_04: with hedge fund people and would chat GPT
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_04: and Gemini about this.
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_04: So what is it, some combination of long calls and...
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_04: Okay, so where is, yeah, Sam, talk about this
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_03: and then go back to Gemini after.
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_03: No, the only point is like I think Brick called it
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_04: emotionally for a long time ago and I'm kicking myself
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_04: because it's a classic thing I do
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_04: where I either don't do the trade
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_04: or I do the trade a little bit and don't care
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_04: when it does really well
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_04: because I don't have enough exposure to it.
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_04: So that's my white whale of the moment.
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_04: But look, I don't know, like look, everyone,
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_04: the market's obviously selling off in a bunch of places.
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_04: You're super worried about the AI story
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_04: but as they well should be, right?
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_04: There's no new information here.
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_04: I think it's what a lot of us
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_04: been saying for years now in terms of where we're at.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_04: But then the big thing is like honestly,
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_04: like Gemini's sick, Google's dropping it
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_04: into all sorts of places, the releasing faster.
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_04: I'm now a default Gemini user.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_04: I always use it a bunch, but now I'm like default Gemini.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_04: And I think ChatGPT is like really an open AI
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_04: is like the one that has by far the least access
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_04: to revenue and users at this point.
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_04: And I just, I think it's, look,
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_04: I've always been calling ChatGPT0 partially to be cheeky
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_04: and partially because I actually believe it.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_04: But I honestly think this is going to be,
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_04: this year is like an absolute maker break
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_04: for if open AI is a thing or not is my view.
[00:22:26] So, and I think Google's crushing it.
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_04: What do you think open AI would have to do
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_02: to become a thing in the next 12 months?
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_02: I mean, to be like when, to be able to win.
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_02: They need to figure out how to make a fuck ton of money,
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_04: which they don't make.
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_04: And like the problem, I think,
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_04: if you think about what they have to do is like,
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_04: look, you know, I do think today's point,
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_04: there is a, basically everyone attacks them
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_04: in different directions, right?
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_04: So you have like the social story versus meta, et cetera.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_04: Can they put a group chat in ChatGPT
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_04: does that help a little bit?
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_04: Sure.
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_04: But they are not on any direction
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_04: in the direction of winning a social story, right?
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_04: If anything, Sora, I think that'd be all called
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_04: was a flash on the pan and is dead.
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_04: That was my point with Sora, though, Sam,
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_05: that the actual social story,
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_05: if they were to go after it, is the group chat story.
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_05: 100%.
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_04: So like we know Sora is not a thing, right?
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_04: Like we putting a group chat around ChatGPT
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_04: or something is fine,
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_04: but I don't think that's gonna be like a singular
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_04: winning strategy that matters.
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_04: The more technical way to say it, though, Sam,
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_05: is putting a graph in ChatGPT.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, maybe, right?
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_04: Like I think I'm pretty skeptical.
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_04: I think it's a fine feature.
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_04: I don't think it's important, right?
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_04: In terms of like a defining move.
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_04: But is that true?
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_05: I mean, we've talked about this on the pod.
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_05: I don't know how many episodes ago,
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_05: maybe 10 episodes ago,
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_05: that the time spent in ChatGPT
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_05: was approaching Instagram.
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, and also that when it went down,
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_03: they relaxed their content moderation.
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_04: But even if that's true, which may or may not be true,
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_04: I just don't, from a monetized ability perspective
[00:23:57] SPEAKER_04: in an ads pipeline, how do we want it?
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_04: I just don't buy it.
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_04: I think what's happened in a lot of the,
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_04: the thing that's interesting about these chat use cases
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_04: is what types of queries are they
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_04: and how monetizable they're relatively?
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_04: I'm not saying you can't monetize them at all.
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_04: I'm clearly can't.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, of course.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_04: I think you've articulated this well.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_04: But the problem is, is like,
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_04: I actually think what you're doing
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_04: is stopping up a bunch of time and attention
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_04: from like the most lonely, least monetizable queries
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_04: in people.
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_04: I just don't think that's true.
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_05: I mean, they've got a billion people on the thing.
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_05: They're like an Instagram scale app.
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_05: No.
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_05: But the problem is it's kind of, maybe, right?
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_04: As we'll see how it plays out.
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_04: But even if that's true, it's like, look,
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_04: everyone's like the Google query stream
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_05: that like is, you know, has more,
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_05: they have more text than meta does, right?
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_05: I don't know the numbers
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_04: and you might know them better,
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_04: but I just, my personal interest,
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_04: it's not that I don't use it.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_04: I do use it.
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_04: I actually sent Jess, believe it or not,
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_04: even yesterday, I think I used it
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_04: for I was like, pretty impressed with its answers.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_04: But I think Gemini's now taking up the mantle.
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_04: There's no, there's going to be
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_04: no technical differentiation in these foundation models,
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_04: right, unless something crazy happens.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_04: But like, you're just going to have a bunch
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_04: of models that are quite good,
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_04: in which case you're competing for attention
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_04: and like, you have no revenue.
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_04: But I guess that's why I'm focused
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_05: on the attention feature, Sam,
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_05: which is that like the product matters, right?
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_05: Like if it becomes your default communications pathway
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_05: as well.
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_05: There's several business models around AI
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_04: that we've all been talking about in circles, right?
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_04: There was an arrow and everyone was like,
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_04: forget chat GPT and the agent,
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_04: it's all about the business layer.
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_04: And I was like, no, no, no, no, that's going to be commoditized.
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_04: It's about time spent and it's more of a social.
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_04: So people are debating what's valuable, right?
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_04: What I know, and I'm very convinced of,
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_04: is that Google seems to be ramping up the engine
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_04: on monetizing these shit out of it in 18 different ways,
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_04: which is what you get to do when you have a freight train,
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_04: right, like Google that can put it everywhere
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_04: with the tech team all the way down to TPUs.
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_04: Like, they're going to make money everywhere.
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_04: It's like, Microsoft is going to make money
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_04: a thousand ways on this, right?
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_04: We all know that in different things.
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_04: You know, then you have like meta,
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_04: which has a one obvious way to make money on it
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_04: and they'll make a ton of money on it,
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_04: which is optimizing ads, doing what they do,
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_04: and then maybe some bogeys to the upside.
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_04: And then you have open AI, which does another revenue,
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_04: they do a bunch of distribution and branding.
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_04: They don't have technical differentiation increasingly, right?
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_04: And so the question is like that, and by the way,
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_04: and like, and they're, so that's an interesting hand to play.
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_04: But the thing that you're missing, though, Sam,
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_02: is that like it also is about the data set.
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_02: The reason I called Google early on
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_02: is also because they know the most about me than anyone.
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_02: Like they know everything in my Gmail docs calendar,
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_02: my YouTube, like entertainment preferences.
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_02: Sure, I mean, I also think the reality is,
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_04: if you're anthropic, which is doing really well,
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_04: if you're a bunch of other people,
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_04: there are other ways to get the pieces you need,
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_04: so to speak, right?
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_04: Like, you know, everyone's in terms of data.
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, like everyone's connecting in your Gmail
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_04: and your calendar now, if you're crazy enough
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_04: to give it to them.
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_04: But even beyond that, like they have like Google health data
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_02: sets from like many, many years.
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_02: Britain, no one put their data in Google health except you.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_03: Let's just call it.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_03: I'll give you this.
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_04: I know other people maybe even on this podcast,
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_04: you feel this way, which is like,
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_04: you know, how do you get data?
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_04: It's like, well, one is like, who do you trust?
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_04: Trying to sell me under the bus.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_03: Who do you know?
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_03: For a whole bunch of reasons, I trust Google,
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_04: and the value of trust is like much higher
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_04: than other companies, right?
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_04: It's the same thing, I trust Waymo,
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_04: I don't really trust Tesla self-driving.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_04: I think the incentives are more aligned.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_04: I like just like, so the,
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_04: I just think there's like a lot of arrows
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_04: that are pointed against, you know, open AI
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_04: being successful here.
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_04: And like, we'll see how it plays out.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_04: I mean, this year will be critical.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_04: And I do think the biggest thing is like,
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_04: if you have a shit ton of profit,
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_04: not even revenue, but profit, you have a lot of shots on goal.
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_04: You got a lot of ammunition to try different things
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_04: the whole line yards.
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_04: Open AI doesn't have that, right?
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_04: And so they're gonna have to, if you said there's one thing
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_04: to solve, it's that, but we'll see, right?
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_04: So all up to Fiji.
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_04: Open AI still has a blank checkbook for raising money.
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_03: That could change, but from who?
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_03: From the world, from, I'm not sure.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_03: The Middle East, from, I don't know.
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_03: I think this comes down to the,
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_03: I wanna make a point and then we'll come back to you, Dave.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_04: You get blah, blah, blah, by Jessica, you're really in trouble.
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_04: I know, that's what I'm stopping.
[00:28:13] Okay.
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_03: On the business model for the consumer side point,
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_03: Fiji gave an interview and wired this week,
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_03: saying that they're gonna make money
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_03: because people are gonna play for subscriptions
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_03: that are gonna give them access to the best financial advisor,
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_03: the best personal shopper, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_03: And I don't buy that because you can get all of that
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_03: for free now in other places.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_03: But I think she, this is how media relations works.
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_03: You do an interview when you feel like
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_03: you need to get your narrative out there
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_03: because people are questioning your narrative.
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_03: I don't, I actually should remember,
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_03: she talked a lot about ads, but I don't think she did.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_03: Because the pieces haven't come together again.
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_03: But I don't think that consumer story flies one bit.
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_03: Now, OpenAI is getting big traction on the business I sue,
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_03: but consumer subscriptions are not gonna be the business.
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_03: There is something happening at the intersection
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_03: of commerce and ads that is really could come together
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_03: in an interesting way, but again,
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_03: is a fragmented space and everyone OpenAI is talking to,
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_03: is also talking to everyone else.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_03: And of course, Amazon's the big gorilla there.
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_03: So, and Shopify.
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_05: And Shopify.
[00:29:24] Shopify is way bigger than people realize.
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_05: Right, but you could integrate with, but yes.
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_03: You could, but they care, they're trying to take on Amazon,
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_05: right? So they're out there, you know,
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_05: they care about being the front, front surface for commerce,
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_05: right?
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_04: They're gonna find ways to make more money.
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_04: That's unquestionably true.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_04: I don't think they're gonna be hyper scalable,
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_04: huge ways that are obvious on the consumer side.
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_04: And like, look, when you raise it a half a,
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_04: you build, what a half a truly dollar valuation,
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_04: it's not clear at all to me, just that the spigots
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_04: for it and finit financing are on right now, right?
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_04: Like, I think the reality is, is like,
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_04: people wanna see some delivery.
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_04: And again, it's possible to figure it out,
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_04: but I 100% with you with it.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_04: When they start saying that this invented personal
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_04: assistant finance thing, which they don't have,
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_04: is gonna be a thing that like, so many people
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_04: are gonna subscribe to as a net new subscription.
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_04: We're not even talking about like,
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_04: I'm already watching video or I'm listening to music,
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_04: I might as well use Spotify.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_04: There's like a net new thing they've created
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_04: that is like vanishingly unlikely.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_04: And I say that as someone who loves subscription,
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_04: totally.
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and it's a great example of like,
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_03: when people say Silicon Valley people don't get,
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_03: how other people spend their money or time,
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_03: I think that is a good example of that.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_03: The other thing I wanna say though,
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_03: and I do wanna shift the conversation slightly
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_03: because Dave, did you do another chat GBT point?
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_05: Well, I think that what's interesting is
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_05: back to analogy I made maybe six months ago,
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_05: which is that like the actual thing
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_05: that people are buying with these subscriptions
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_05: is a computer.
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_05: It's like these guys runs the run a computer business.
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_05: I subscribe to chat GBT pro because it's like a computer
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_05: that I need to have in my life.
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_05: And so what you're saying Jess,
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_05: is kind of like the early computer days
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_05: where people would pay for more software
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_05: to load onto their computer.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_05: And that's kind of what they're pitching.
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_05: They're basically saying like,
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_05: we're gonna build quick in and quick books for you
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_05: and you're gonna pay extra money for that
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_05: on top of the computer you already bought from us.
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_05: And that's just not how people think about the internet today.
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_04: It's also a pretty hard pitch in the era
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_04: when like making the actual software
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_04: is nearly free and easy, right?
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_04: That's what I mean.
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_05: Like this is just not what we,
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_05: this is just not how people think about software.
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_05: It's not how we run these business models anymore.
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_05: And so it's kind of a strange pitch.
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_05: But if they can get a wedge into some features,
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_02: like the social thing is really interesting.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_02: Like if we start using that as our primary means
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_02: of communication, I know,
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_02: well, I also do think they need to build up
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_02: their enterprise staff.
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_02: I gotta understand why they're not doing more
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_02: around everything in enterprise.
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_02: They look, they have so much money
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_04: and so many talented people who all want to do
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_04: their own different things that they're trying everything.
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_04: I mean, I think they just hired a bunch of people
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_04: from Morgan Stanley to try to figure out how analysts work
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_04: and create like analyst thought, right?
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_04: They're gonna try everything.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_04: I just, the problem with trying everything is 95% of it
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_04: won't work.
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_04: It's actually very similar to the narrative around AGI.
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_04: The narrative on AGI is effectively,
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_04: we get this stuff and no, it's not gonna get us
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_04: to true, you know, human level intelligence,
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_04: but yada, yada, yada, it will figure out
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_04: how to have us get there.
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_04: It's kind of the same thing here.
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_04: We're like, we don't actually know what's gonna work.
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_04: We're gonna do literally everything
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_04: and like something will work.
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_04: Right?
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_04: That's kind of feels like the arrow word in,
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_04: you know, on the chat GPT opening AGI side for me.
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_03: Well, but I, something we haven't talked a lot on this pod,
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_03: which is probably worth talking about,
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_03: is people don't like AGI.
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_03: People don't like it?
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, people don't like AGI.
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, you talk to people outside AGI,
[00:32:46] start ups in Silicon Valley,
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_03: and they're like, it's gonna jack my electricity prices up.
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_03: It's gonna make my cans mentally ill.
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_03: Like that feeling has been there for some time.
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_03: It's getting quite big.
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_03: The question that I have on that, Jess,
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_05: what that makes me think of is when I was sitting inside
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_05: of the original Facebook building,
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_05: and when we first launched newsfeed,
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_05: and for like the year after that,
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_05: everyone was saying this, there was this like,
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_05: no one likes newsfeed, everyone like,
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_05: does it like social networking,
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_05: and we would just look at the data,
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_05: and the data was the opposite.
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_05: It's like everybody was using it more than ever.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_05: Well, this kind of gets to my point, Dave.
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_03: This gets to my point.
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_03: I don't think, I kind of wonder if on a pure tactics basis,
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_03: companies building AGI should be like rebranding it.
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_03: And the reason I thought about this
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_03: is the Gemini launch yesterday.
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_03: It was all about Gemini.
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_03: It was all about Google products.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_03: Some of them were embedded into search already.
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_03: The search you know, some of them are new tools,
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_03: but it's not like Gemini AI.
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_03: I mean, that was sound weird.
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_03: And I think it will be very interesting.
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_03: Obviously, AIA has been the wrapper of the narrative
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_03: because it's raised money and it's recruited engineers.
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_03: And so we needed a new narrative
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_03: because you can't raise a trillion dollars
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_03: against an incremental narrative.
[00:34:17] But it kind of feels pretty likely
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_03: that we could be sitting here in five years
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_03: with all sorts of new technology at our fingertips,
[00:34:27] SPEAKER_03: but that is just kind of new technology
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_03: powered by new AI models and so forth.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_03: And that the average consumer isn't sitting there
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_03: being like, oh, I'm using AI now.
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_03: And I also like our eight year old thinks
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_03: Gemini is Google and Google is Gemini
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_03: and he doesn't know the difference.
[00:34:47] And it really doesn't matter.
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_03: Of course, he doesn't know the difference.
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_03: And if the world goes in this direction,
[00:34:56] Google is so much better positioned.
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_03: Just be Google.
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_04: Then open AI.
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, look, the argument, the thing
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_04: you keep hearing people say to that,
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_04: to just to your point in terms of how this plays out
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_04: is I've heard a lot of people give a story
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_04: and being like, look, there's all these things
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_04: that Google is ascending on
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_04: and all these other companies are chipping away.
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_04: But at least open AI still, they own the Kleenex verb.
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_04: Like they own the chat GPT.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_04: And that's true if it's Kleenex,
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_04: but if it's just like a few year disruption.
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_04: If it's cocaine.
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_04: If it's cocaine, if it's Coca Cola, right, like fine.
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_04: But I actually think there's a very strong argument
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_04: you're making right now, which I agree with,
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_04: that actually, like, chat GPT is not Kleenex.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_04: And like this will be a branding blip in history.
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_04: And there's just like, yeah, like our software does more stuff.
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_03: And by the way, that's awesome stuff.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_03: I'm not arguing that the technology
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_03: will lead to more productivity or have these things, but like.
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_03: Well, it may or may not, but yeah.
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_03: But why don't we, and I don't know,
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_03: I think that's a real last 18 months
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_03: where like, tack AI onto your brand to make it more valuable.
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_03: I think the next 18 are going to be take it off.
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Well, that's every centralization, decentralization.
[00:36:10] Brand on brand.
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_04: Brand on brand.
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_03: So that is one of my predictions.
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_03: But the Gemini launch is very interesting.
[00:36:17] I mean, there's first of all, there's so much stuff.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_03: And I don't even know how companies do these launches anymore
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_03: because I'm pretty tech savvy
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_03: and I don't even know how to do half of the stuff.
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_03: I'm reading like Sundar's tweet thread,
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_03: trying to be like, oh wait, I want to try this or that
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_03: or where's this and.
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_04: I don't think you need to.
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_04: I mean, this is kind of the nice part.
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_04: I think this is going to be so bullish on Google.
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_04: I say this having not yet bought enough of this stock
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_04: or have a strategy is like, look.
[00:36:44] Say it one more time, Sam.
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_02: You go in Gmail.
[00:36:47] And like, all of a sudden there's like a scheduling
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_04: and they can textually pop stuff
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_04: and it helps you schedule on the fly with a bunch of AI.
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_04: And you're like, yup, that's how you deploy it.
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_04: You just stick it into the places where it's most relevant.
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_04: And it's like, it's not even a big one.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_04: It's just like an evolution of all the things.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_04: Guys, is it time for me to move from superhuman back to Gmail?
[00:37:04] Yes, Britt.
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_02: You're like a lot, is human gone now?
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_04: Why you?
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_04: No, superhuman was sold to Grammarly or something.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_02: No, it's the other way around, I think.
[00:37:14] SPEAKER_05: No, no, no, no.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_04: Superhuman.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_04: But it has AI features.
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_02: Superhuman did not buy Grammarly.
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_04: Grammarly is way bigger than superhuman.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_04: Whatever, anyway, they.
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_02: Well, one of them bought the other, Sam.
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_04: Well, not for a lot of money, I can tell you that.
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_04: They're the same company now.
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_04: Grammarly is acquiring a bunch of companies
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_04: very cheaply right now.
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_04: Because you think about Grammarly is an interesting one, right?
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_04: Very high fire.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_04: Lots of the money.
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_04: Like people loved it.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_04: Rumbai Shashir Mahodra, who's a great executive.
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I worked with him at Google back in the day.
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_03: He's one of the reasons where a subscription business
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_03: at the information Shashir.
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_02: So his wife is one of our offline founders too.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_02: Oh, wait, it says he's CEO of superhuman formerly Grammarly.
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_03: They changed the name of...
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_03: They changed the name.
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_04: It's a better name.
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_04: But they bought the company.
[00:38:00] SPEAKER_04: But here's the thing.
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_04: It's a great example.
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_04: If you think about Grammarly of a company
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_04: that is completely fucked by AI, right?
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_04: So they're basically figuring out how to take what they have now
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_04: and like to do a bunch of acquisitions
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_04: they're trying to is my understanding.
[00:38:13] It's pretty smart.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_03: It's pretty smart.
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_03: Guys, can we do an interlude news break
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_03: because there's some news?
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_03: So we just, Nvidia earnings just came out.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_03: Yep.
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_03: Up until the right folks, 60% is insane.
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_03: Party is not ending.
[00:38:28] It's just 5% after hours.
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_05: Okay.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_03: So we'll shrug off that slump.
[00:38:33] But that was obvious.
[00:38:34] SPEAKER_05: I feel like there was no chance
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_05: that wasn't going to happen.
[00:38:36] SPEAKER_05: No chance.
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_04: You already know because all the companies
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_04: raised the money already.
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_04: Like the infrastructure spend has already been locked in.
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_04: Right?
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_04: Like it's not like, I don't know.
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_04: Like to me.
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_04: So what would you look at Sam
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_03: for your best indicator of bubble-ness in this world?
[00:38:51] Well, I think just look at the second derivative.
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_04: Right?
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_04: You can't look at like the infrastructure spend
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_04: because like that ship has already sailed in so many ways.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_04: We're going to think about the holes
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_04: and rack of much servers, right?
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_04: And like raise a bunch of debt.
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_04: And we've already raised it.
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_04: I think looking at the rate of new debt offerings
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_04: or whatever it is,
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_04: that's going to be even more, I think, is interesting.
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_04: Because I think that's like,
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_04: the money that's already been raised is going to get spent.
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_04: And then two, I honestly think it's just
[00:39:14] SPEAKER_04: how well these companies are able to actually monetize it
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_04: or build on top of it.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_04: Like that's what matters.
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_04: Like it's, we are getting back to business realities
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_04: and not fancy, fanciful stuff right now.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_04: And like that's, I think we can have to.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_04: Are we back to reality, though, Sam?
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_05: Because just my simple answer is,
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_05: I think we talked about this several pods as the debt, right?
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_05: Like as soon as I saw, I think it was meta
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_05: and a few others starting to lever up,
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_05: go way, way beyond their operating cash flow,
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_05: you know, every bubble that's ever really crashed,
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_05: everything is debt-related.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_05: I think it's a little more complicated than this, Dave,
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_03: because basically, I mean, yes,
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_03: tech companies are changing their debt profile
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_03: and are tapping the debt markets in new ways.
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_03: But as someone who pushed this line of questioning
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_03: and was shot down by all my editors
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_03: who covered the financial crisis from the Wall Street Journal,
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_03: they assured me that all the ratios of like debt versus net cash
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_03: and all those kinds of things
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_03: as the tech companies are still very, very conservative.
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think that's correct.
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_04: And that, yeah, it's a change, but it's certainly,
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_03: and these editors tend to be like, you know,
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_03: the first to call bubble scandal problem.
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_03: And on this one, they were like,
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_03: Siverdown, Jessica, there's no issue here yet.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_03: But I think Sam's right.
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_05: Like if we continue to see the debt markets,
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_05: the activity growing, and we don't have good answers
[00:40:37] SPEAKER_05: to these other questions, which is what is the real
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_05: deprecation curve, sorry, depreciation curve
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_05: for a GPU of any kind?
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_05: Like what's the real useful life of these things?
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_05: And then how are they accounting for this?
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_05: And then is the business being built on top of this
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_05: infrastructure at the same speed?
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_05: I think these are like pretty real questions.
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_05: So if the debt continues to go up,
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_05: the revenue's not coming in as fast as I already thinks
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_05: that it is, and the depreciation's much faster
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_05: than it appears, then you've got a serious problem
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_05: on your hands.
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_05: Well, it's a depreciation is faster
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_04: that's fine for an Nvidia, then they set the somewhere
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_05: things.
[00:41:14] Yeah, it's fine for Nvidia, not for everybody else.
[00:41:17] Yeah, well, the question, Dave, which is still one
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_03: that we spent a lot of time thinking about is just like
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_03: who holds the what in the end, right?
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_03: Like, because yes.
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_03: Who holds the bag?
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_03: It sounds like crypto.
[00:41:27] Yes, okay, that's one piece of news.
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_03: Second piece of news, hot off the press from the information.
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_03: White House working on an exec order
[00:41:35] SPEAKER_03: that would foil state AI regulations.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_03: So this is important.
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_03: We have to get people a little backstory here, right?
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_03: But meaning that states cannot pass individual
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_03: if this executive order went through
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_03: and was held up to be constitutional,
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_03: individual states could not regulate AI.
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_03: They should not be regulating AI.
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_04: It's an incredibly stupid idea, so sure.
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_03: Okay, Sam, make that case.
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_03: Wait, can you explain some examples
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_02: of what they're doing to regulate it?
[00:41:59] So there was a California bill that passed,
[00:42:02] SPEAKER_03: but was vetoed by Newsom, I think roughly,
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_03: I might have gotten the details of that wrong a year or so ago.
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_03: And it was part of, I mean, it's during the Biden administration.
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_03: And it was controversial among the models,
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_03: but inthropic kind of got on board and helped shape it.
[00:42:21] And I don't really remember the details,
[00:42:22] SPEAKER_03: but it was aggressive, right?
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_03: I mean, it was sort of putting up guardrails
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_03: around training models and all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_03: Scott Weiner, who's running now for Nancy Pelosi's congressional seat
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_03: was a big lead on that bill.
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_03: But I mean, it obviously got vetoed by the governor.
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_03: But since then, I mean, California was also a first mover
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_03: on privacy legislation in the lines of Europe
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_03: that spurred away of other things.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_03: So Sam, make the case.
[00:42:50] SPEAKER_03: I mean, I don't think you're a constitutional lawyer.
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_03: So there is that question.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_03: But I've won awards for best non-lawyer performance
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_04: by a non-lawyer and a legal context.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_04: But this does not seem like the realm.
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_03: This seems like within the realm of what states do.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_03: But no, look, what are states are sub-scale things, right?
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_04: And like, yeah, California is the biggest one.
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_04: It's almost a size of Germany.
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_04: They can get away with more than most and try to.
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_04: But in the end of the day, you want Wyoming
[00:43:16] SPEAKER_04: with like 100,000 people, like having their own regulates
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_04: and incredibly stupid.
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_04: Well, but they regulate a lot of other things.
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_03: The big tension, the big tension and all this stuff
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_04: is actually the original idea of like the laboratory
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_04: of democracy and having states is they all
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_04: had their own economies and ran independently.
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_04: And so you'd experiment and they have local sovereignty.
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_04: At this point, there is nothing that's not interstate commerce
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_04: that we do.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_04: And by the way, talk about interstate commerce.
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_04: You think AI is like, why are we
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_04: always not going to have its own AI, right?
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_04: It's like a national thing if not a global thing.
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_04: So I don't know, Sam, don't put it past Wyoming.
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_04: Love Wyoming.
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_04: I'm just saying.
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_04: I mean, I'm kind of down for Wyoming AI, by the way,
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_03: except for the guns and schools.
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_03: I don't like that.
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_03: The federal government does interstate commerce.
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_04: In what planet can you possibly think of this not
[00:44:03] SPEAKER_04: being interstate commerce?
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_04: So this was the discussion in our edit meeting today
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_03: was the definition of interstate commerce.
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_03: It's like, and if you don't think this is, by the way,
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_04: it's kind of in some ways, I'd actually
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_04: our unations are sub-scale for AI.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_04: Like we now live in a globalized internet world.
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_04: So we have de-globalization going on with some sites
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_04: to commerce, little countries want sovereignty again.
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_04: Fine.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_04: Fine.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_04: That's all a big debate to have.
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_04: But the idea that you'd recurse that down,
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_04: the idea that you would recurse that down
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_04: and like Florida thinks they should have their own AI
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_04: regulation is just assinine.
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_04: OK.
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_03: Well, we'll see.
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_03: Exact order coming.
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_03: Doesn't mean they won't try.
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_04: I'm just, it just makes absolutely no sense.
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_04: What is interstate commerce in digital?
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_05: What is interstate commerce in digital?
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_04: Interstate commerce in atoms is very easy to understand.
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_05: Like you can't produce something, like I don't know,
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_05: good example or like cannabis markets in California.
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_05: Like you can't produce something in California
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_05: and send it across state lines, right?
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_05: Isn't porn like an example of interstate commerce?
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_05: Sam?
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_05: I don't know about digital.
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_05: Like, can you, how do you state lines work in digital?
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_05: There's like, they block websites in certain states.
[00:45:14] SPEAKER_02: Look, there's also some, even the question of like,
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_04: how do you pay subscription taxes in different states?
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_04: It's really complicated.
[00:45:20] SPEAKER_04: And like most of, yeah, that's hard.
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_03: We do that and it's a nightmare.
[00:45:24] And like you do that.
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_04: Most people who want subscriptions don't even bother, right?
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_04: Because it's like, they can't, but it's like,
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_04: is that interstate commerce if I sell you a subscription
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_04: to my like, zine in like Florida?
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_04: That's like, yeah, like I sold to someone in Florida.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_04: Like the bits went to Florida.
[00:45:39] SPEAKER_04: Like, I don't know.
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_04: But couldn't you put a server in Florida and have it subscribe?
[00:45:43] SPEAKER_05: The con, you sent the thing down to the server in Florida.
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_04: I just think you have to acknowledge the fact
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_04: the internet.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_04: If I'm selling things across state lines,
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_04: and you clearly are for all this stuff,
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_04: it like you just should broadly say it's interstate commerce.
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_04: All right.
[00:45:56] SPEAKER_03: Okay, last headline.
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_03: I'll just go back.
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_04: Even if you didn't believe any of that,
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_04: the idea that you want 50 regulatory frameworks
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_04: in America for AI is a great way to lose, right?
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_04: I agree with that.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_03: That's fair.
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_03: That's fair.
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_03: But we do in self-driving cars.
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_03: We do in pretty much everything else.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_03: So that would be the,
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_03: Well, really, there are a few big states like California
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_04: and Europe who can like swing their, you know,
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_04: they're kind of big swinging dick states
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_04: that can kind of like try to have their own rules
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_04: because they're powerful enough and get away with it.
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_04: But as an matter of theoretical policy, it makes no sense.
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_04: Third headline.
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_03: Coinbase launching a prediction market.
[00:46:34] Well, aren't they just partnering with someone else
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_04: to do a quote, like,
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_04: Well, they're partnering with Calshy.
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_03: Calshy.
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_05: So is that just a distribution deal?
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_05: I mean, I think so.
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_02: And also it's unclear if it's exclusive, right?
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_02: But can you bet with crypto?
[00:46:46] SPEAKER_02: Is that what I'm doing?
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_02: I'm putting my Bitcoin up.
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_05: No, that's not how Calshy works.
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_05: Well, but are you always betting with crypto?
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_03: Like, no, no, that's a dollars.
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_05: No, I think Polly Market, like, I think the,
[00:46:58] SPEAKER_05: I think you like buy the option off chain
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_05: and then when it resolves, it resolves on chain.
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_05: Like, yeah, but there's an on chain resolution.
[00:47:06] I don't think that's how Calshy works though.
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_04: Oh, I'm not sure.
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_04: Look, in the end of the day,
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_04: like, everything becomes what it was set out to fight, right?
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_04: And like, there's no question that Coinbase
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_04: is becoming a financial service platform broadly.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_04: They're not just doing crypto, like doing all the things.
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_04: Their community is the audience of crypto people,
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_04: which by the way, probably correlates with people
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_04: who do a bunch of stuff around prediction markets
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_04: and like that stuff.
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_04: And so it's like fine.
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_04: They should do that.
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_04: Who cares?
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_04: I mean, that's to me actually the main thing here,
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_05: which is that Coinbase and everything that's been going on
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_05: with meme coins and memetic finance
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_05: and people's desire to make bets on things
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_05: that are not basically non-financial,
[00:47:48] SPEAKER_05: you know, cultural elements and cultural trends
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_05: like these kinds of things.
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_05: Like this has been the currency of what the prediction markets
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_05: has risen upon.
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_05: And it's surprising to me actually that Coinbase didn't innovate
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_05: and add their own prediction market much faster.
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_05: And so the fact that they're having to partner with Calshy
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_05: is like, for what it's worth though,
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_04: I think like look, the whole prediction market idea
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_04: and like, it's like obviously an old one,
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_04: people have messing up a while.
[00:48:15] SPEAKER_04: So Calshy, like a lot of these companies
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_04: are actually fairly old and they've been around
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_04: in various forms for a while.
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_04: And they were the ones who had the balls
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_04: who do the regulatory work around this,
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_04: like last administration, right?
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_04: And so the reality is, they got the benefit
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_04: of having been around the hoop on this for so long
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_04: from the regulatory perspective that when it finally unlocked,
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_04: which really is like a Trump era phenomenon
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_04: that everyone's like, yeah, whatever, do it.
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_04: They're like pretty well positioned.
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_04: I think it's actually fairly hard to spin this stuff up.
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_04: So everyone likes the idea of them.
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_04: There was obviously really interesting stuff
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_04: going on culturally, but you got to hand it
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_04: to Polymarket Calshy and a few others.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_04: You just like did the dog hard work of like staying
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_04: in the game regularly, long enough to survive
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_04: for the moment where they were now doable.
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_04: And then someone like, when is he's like, look,
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_04: it's gonna be fucking annoying and hard
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_04: to build this ourselves.
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_04: We probably wanted to five years ago,
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_04: but like it was just not a good thing for us to do
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_04: when we're trying to be a public company and serious
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_04: and whatever else.
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_04: And now like the moment's the moment.
[00:49:11] It's like stripe and stable coins.
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_03: And they just bought the way.
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_03: So what's the business deal of this partnership?
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_03: Are they getting like something?
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_02: Claire, and I think these really are
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_03: just distribution partnerships.
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_03: And it's also not clear they're exclusive.
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_03: I think Coinbase could easily work with Polymarket
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_03: and others too.
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_03: I think there must be business at stake.
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_05: Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_03: These are all good questions.
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_03: I thought maybe you smart people would know.
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_03: We're waiting for your reporting, Jess.
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_03: Other more interesting things that I've noticed
[00:49:36] SPEAKER_05: in my own behavior is I actually find it quite fun
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_05: to watch sports and then watch the curves on Colchey.
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_05: I find it more interesting than looking at the athletic anymore.
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_05: Are you saying that data is more interesting
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_03: than journalism, Dave?
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_03: What are you doing?
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_03: Well, no, sorry.
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_05: No, not the journalism.
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_05: Because by the way, the athletic does not do a good job
[00:49:55] SPEAKER_05: at real-time journalism of any kind.
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_05: I'm talking about the community feature of the athletic.
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_05: They have a feature where people sort of talk
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_05: about the game while the game's going on.
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_05: I've always enjoyed that feature.
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_05: But I find the Colchey stuff better.
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_05: And I think that's like an interesting thing going on right
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_05: now that the way that sports and this stuff interacts
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_05: is clearly exploding very, very quickly
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_05: and should be interesting to see where it goes.
[00:50:25] I got a resume for someone.
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_03: And on their resume, they were a writer
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_03: for sports-spending markets.
[00:50:34] And I keep meeting to look into like,
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_03: they just happen to work for a sports-spending publication.
[00:50:39] SPEAKER_03: Or is they are these journalists
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_03: like writing content tied somehow to the betting process?
[00:50:46] I mean, I would bet that it's just now an interesting story.
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_05: I guess that's what I'm trying to say
[00:50:50] SPEAKER_05: is the sports betting story that's going on
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_05: during every game is sufficiently interesting
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_05: to be paying attention to it.
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_05: Like, I actually quite enjoy watching the curves diverge
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_05: in the wrong direction, like effectively predicting
[00:51:04] SPEAKER_05: the game incorrectly while it's going on.
[00:51:08] That in itself is a story.
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_05: And that's kind of interesting.
[00:51:12] Yeah, what happens just watching the game?
[00:51:13] SPEAKER_03: But I hear you, Dave.
[00:51:15] Okay, guys, I want to end with a meme corner.
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_03: And I've got two memes to discuss, okay?
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_03: You guys have any memes to discuss?
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_02: I thought you're gonna say a meme coin.
[00:51:23] SPEAKER_02: I was getting excited, but we can do a meme corner.
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_02: We can do a meme, okay.
[00:51:28] Meme corner, you guys all know about six, seven.
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_02: No, what is it?
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_05: Oh, yeah, but it's kind of over.
[00:51:33] SPEAKER_02: It's over.
[00:51:35] Four, one now.
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_02: It's 41.
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_02: Four, one!
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_02: Jess, this was like a month ago.
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_02: Oh my God.
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_02: Britt, come on.
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_05: I didn't even know this.
[00:51:43] SPEAKER_02: Our kids taught us what, Dave, you didn't know this.
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_05: No.
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_05: Hilariously, life 360, where I'm on the board, put in,
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_02: there's a feature where you can just like press
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_02: instant reactions to people.
[00:51:51] SPEAKER_02: And for like a week, they put in six, seven as one.
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_02: And it was the most used thing ever.
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_02: And but then they were like, we have to retire it
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_02: because six, seven is dead now.
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_02: And it's 41.
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_02: It's the same.
[00:52:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_05: What, six, seven was killed by parents being that
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_05: for Halloween.
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_02: It was killed by South Park.
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_02: It was killed by South Park.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_05: All right.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_05: Well, what's 41?
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_05: It's just a number, Dave.
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_02: It's just a meme.
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_05: It's just the next meme.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_05: All right.
[00:52:17] It's also the age I will be next year for my next birthday party.
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_02: Oh my God, we're having a meme party.
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_03: But I'm going to have a 401 meme party.
[00:52:25] SPEAKER_03: As our eight year old pointed out, it's just not a satisfying
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_03: a meme because six, seven are next to each other.
[00:52:32] SPEAKER_03: So that happens, but like 401 don't happen in this naturally
[00:52:36] SPEAKER_03: occurring kind of harmony.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_03: So, okay.
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_03: Last meme, Brett, have you been following the ladies
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_03: as San Francisco's dressing habits meme?
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_03: No.
[00:52:48] SPEAKER_03: What are we wearing these days, ladies of San Francisco?
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_03: Oh, no, no.
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_03: I'm going to butcher this or something.
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_03: But like, has Sam left the pod?
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_03: Has Sam left the pod?
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_03: No, I'm here.
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_03: Sam, do you want to set this one up?
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_03: The Ackman thing?
[00:53:03] So Bill Ackman tweeted something.
[00:53:05] SPEAKER_04: What was it like dating advice?
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_04: May I meet you or something?
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah, the may I meet you thing.
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_04: What's the D-Jan males who follow him were like,
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_04: may I meet you?
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_04: And then like some attractive young women
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_04: like took this and ran with it on Twitter.
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_04: He started posting photos themselves,
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_04: like making like make SF hot again.
[00:53:24] SPEAKER_04: And so they're all posting pictures,
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_04: and looking dressed up.
[00:53:26] SPEAKER_04: And like there's a whole dating revolution-y thing
[00:53:30] SPEAKER_04: going on in the feeds.
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_04: I have no idea if it's real or not.
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_04: I will say one person has slow tweeted
[00:53:35] SPEAKER_04: out something along the lines that may I meet you.
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_04: And all these like women responded to him
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_04: and it was kind of fun to eat to watch.
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_04: But like, I don't, it's not my generation.
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_04: I don't really get it.
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_04: I know.
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_03: This is why I'm sort of stumbling on it.
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_03: But I feel like I'm improving my cred by mentioning it.
[00:53:48] SPEAKER_03: But so it's wear nice clothes in SF.
[00:53:52] So it went from may I meet you or can I meet you to, you know,
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_03: female techies posting nice looking pictures of themselves.
[00:54:00] SPEAKER_03: And now there's a backlash to the meme.
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_03: I think Sam started this trend.
[00:54:05] Yes, no, I think you did too.
[00:54:07] SPEAKER_03: I don't even I heard it.
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_05: And one of the creators of the meme
[00:54:10] SPEAKER_03: who I'm DMing with actually credits him.
[00:54:12] SPEAKER_03: Really?
[00:54:13] SPEAKER_03: That's very nice.
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Sam, this is very clearly directly related
[00:54:17] SPEAKER_05: to etiquette school.
[00:54:19] SPEAKER_05: Well, now I'm excited about it.
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_04: Guys, can we throw a party?
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_05: Let's throw a more or less party in the city
[00:54:24] SPEAKER_05: where you have to dress up to the nines.
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, sure.
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_03: I'm there.
[00:54:28] Brit has to wear clothes.
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_03: That's all I said.
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_03: No, it was great.
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_03: That's great.
[00:54:32] SPEAKER_04: Who cares?
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_04: I didn't want to move it ever.
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_04: They want.
[00:54:35] SPEAKER_04: I was going to say Brit looks fabulous.
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_03: That's spray-ted.
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_03: Your legs lady.
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_03: Pretty amazing.
[00:54:40] SPEAKER_03: I can say that because I'm a woman.
[00:54:43] I can say that because I'm her husband.
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_03: There you go.
[00:54:46] SPEAKER_03: I guess I can say that.
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_05: But now go for it, Sam.
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_03: The latest turn in the meme is it's cold in San Francisco.
[00:54:53] SPEAKER_03: So now the meme is you post pictures
[00:54:57] SPEAKER_03: of your nice clothes.
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_03: But then you wear nice clothes in SF,
[00:55:02] but you can't be in denial in the words of one source
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_03: about how cold and damp it is.
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_03: You need a puffer jacket, a fleece, vest, pants, layers.
[00:55:10] SPEAKER_03: That's complete bullshit.
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_04: There are cities like New York where women dress
[00:55:13] SPEAKER_04: very nicely that are much colder.
[00:55:15] SPEAKER_04: So I call bullshit.
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_04: Now, if you want to get, if the people need to get
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_04: like a nice outerwear coat that they can then take off
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_04: in the very well air condition, whatever is fine.
[00:55:26] SPEAKER_04: OK, well, I just want the people, the listeners to know
[00:55:29] SPEAKER_03: if you see these memes, feel free post a picture of yourself
[00:55:32] SPEAKER_03: in the next.
[00:55:33] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, look forward to the more or less party.
[00:55:36] SPEAKER_05: It's going to be.
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_05: Sam, is there an etiquette update of the week
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_03: before we send our dear viewers on their way?
[00:55:41] SPEAKER_03: Well, I will say we're publishing
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_04: which you guys will all receive the slow ventures first guide
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_04: to etiquette book, which is actually coming along quite nicely.
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_04: I love that this SF standard was doing memes about etiquette school.
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_05: So the book is, that was great.
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_04: I love those memes.
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_04: So yeah, the book is coming along nicely.
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_04: It'll be given at it or holiday party in a first version.
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_04: But I would say that if you guys would like to contribute
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_04: any points of etiquette to the first etiquette book,
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_04: we're working on them now.
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_04: And we have some, you know, I think it's actually going to be quite good.
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_04: So I'm not joking that I think I should run your Women's
[00:56:17] SPEAKER_02: etiquette program.
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_02: I don't think it.
[00:56:20] SPEAKER_02: You know, I volunteered.
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_03: It was pretty much shut down.
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_03: I think he thinks he's got it.
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_03: I think you should do it together.
[00:56:27] SPEAKER_05: That's not true.
[00:56:28] SPEAKER_04: You guys, I'm more than happy.
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_04: This is a collaborative.
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_04: A lot of the best very well-known female executives
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_04: of San Francisco reached out asking for a women's program
[00:56:38] SPEAKER_04: and asking to run it or be part of it.
[00:56:40] SPEAKER_04: I would love to see a great thing to come together.
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_04: And I think it's needed.
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_04: I think it's needed.
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_04: Well, why wouldn't you have your wife and your podcast co-host run that?
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_02: You guys, I'm solely.
[00:56:48] SPEAKER_04: We just know Queens.
[00:56:50] SPEAKER_04: Here's my thing.
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_04: I need coming in with an executable plan.
[00:56:54] SPEAKER_04: Because you guys are great.
[00:56:54] SPEAKER_04: We can do this.
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_04: But who are your boots on the ground?
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_04: If we have a whole calendar of etiquette we're building.
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_04: And if you want to do a Women's SF event, I think absolutely.
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_04: We just need to pull.
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_04: We need the boots.
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_04: You're looking at Brit Moran who just put Coachella on for her 40th birthday.
[00:57:11] SPEAKER_03: Fine.
[00:57:12] SPEAKER_04: If this is it.
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_04: I don't want to have to apply, Sam.
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_02: I want to know that I was nominated by you.
[00:57:16] SPEAKER_02: And then I'll put together my plan.
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_02: I just, if you're going to do it, it has to be full-send.
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_04: We're going broke.
[00:57:23] SPEAKER_04: I'm going to do a small model.
[00:57:24] SPEAKER_04: But this is not a franchise because we need to control quality.
[00:57:27] SPEAKER_04: And the thing is, I totally into it.
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_04: You were at my birthday.
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_02: Who's great?
[00:57:32] SPEAKER_04: I would say, yeah, I'm in.
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_04: But you got to pick a date.
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_04: We got to have a schedule.
[00:57:36] SPEAKER_04: We got to work it.
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_02: Well, who's your coordinator?
[00:57:38] SPEAKER_02: Tell me that I'm in and then let's fucking do it.
[00:57:40] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_02: Fine.
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_04: I'll start it for that right now.
[00:57:43] SPEAKER_04: We're going to do fan etiquette.
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_02: Fan etiquette.
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:57:46] SPEAKER_02: Me and you.
[00:57:47] SPEAKER_02: I got it.
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_04: To be clear, I want to be clear that the program we're running is for both men and women
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_04: and the etiquette applies broadly.
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_04: If there's a separate section, there's more.
[00:57:57] SPEAKER_04: But I think, look, we include all sections need to be open to everyone.
[00:58:00] SPEAKER_04: Sure.
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_02: But we should have breakouts for sure, because there are some things we can only say to other
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_02: girls.
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_04: I will say in the book, for instance, there are, we, that we're developing, there are
[00:58:09] SPEAKER_04: things I'm actually curious to get your take on as women.
[00:58:12] So there are several points of respecting traditional etiquette.
[00:58:16] SPEAKER_04: There's a whole section on this includes whole doors for women, stand at the table when
[00:58:20] SPEAKER_04: we come.
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_04: There's stuff that is gendered in the etiquette book.
[00:58:24] SPEAKER_04: So I'm going to curious what your take is on that.
[00:58:26] Edicates gendered.
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_03: I have no problem with that.
[00:58:28] SPEAKER_03: Edicates is, that's good.
[00:58:29] SPEAKER_04: I like it.
[00:58:30] SPEAKER_02: But my etiquette to women founders would be actually to like pump themselves up a little
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_02: bit more.
[00:58:35] SPEAKER_02: Like I, there's a lot with body posture, tone, not ending questions like this.
[00:58:41] SPEAKER_02: Like just like so much about communication.
[00:58:43] SPEAKER_02: I took bread on a date last night to San Francisco to the stereophonic play and I opened all
[00:58:48] SPEAKER_05: the doors for her.
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_05: There you go.
[00:58:50] SPEAKER_02: Is there a kind of view day?
[00:58:52] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_03: Well, people, the news is hopping.
[00:58:55] The news is hopping.
