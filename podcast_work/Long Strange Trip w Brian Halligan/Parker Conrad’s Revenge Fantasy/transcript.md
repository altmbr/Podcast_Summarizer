[00:00:00] Ripley was born out of this revenge fantasy.
[00:00:04] Parker Conrad: That's what got the company going
[00:00:06] Parker Conrad: and it's certainly what kept me going
[00:00:09] Parker Conrad: for the first couple of years.
[00:00:10] Parker Conrad: And I love the people I work with.
[00:00:12] Parker Conrad: I really like the problems that we're solving.
[00:00:15] Parker Conrad: I feel like we're making a difference for customers
[00:00:18] Parker Conrad: in this small way for their companies.
[00:00:20] Parker Conrad: And that's all extremely motivating.
[00:00:21] Parker Conrad: But early on, it's a grind.
[00:00:24] Parker Conrad: People come to me all the time,
[00:00:25] Parker Conrad: they're like, oh, I'm thinking about doing,
[00:00:26] Parker Conrad: sorry, your company, what do you think?
[00:00:28] Parker Conrad: And my advice is always, don't do it.
[00:00:29] Parker Conrad: It's a terrible idea.
[00:00:30] Parker Conrad: Okay.
[00:00:31] Parker Conrad: In this episode, you're going to hear from Parker Conrad.
[00:00:52] He's one of the most compelling CEOs
[00:00:54] Unknown Host: in Silicon Valley in my opinion.
[00:00:56] Unknown Host: He runs Ripley.
[00:00:57] Unknown Host: It's an amazing back office software company.
[00:01:00] Unknown Host: It's a $17 billion market cap
[00:01:02] Unknown Host: with 4,000 employees incredibly successful.
[00:01:05] Unknown Host: Almost everyone, including myself,
[00:01:07] Unknown Host: never thought he would get this company off the ground.
[00:01:10] Unknown Host: And that's because he was very violently fired
[00:01:13] Unknown Host: from his last company's benefits.
[00:01:15] Unknown Host: And I remember when that went down,
[00:01:17] Unknown Host: I thought, man, he's done.
[00:01:19] Unknown Host: He'll never get up off the mat.
[00:01:20] Unknown Host: And I'm really impressed the ass and how well he's done.
[00:01:23] Unknown Host: He's also had a lot of drama with a competitor,
[00:01:25] Unknown Host: Deal, very recently, who was spying on information
[00:01:29] Unknown Host: inside his systems.
[00:01:30] Unknown Host: And there's a lawsuit and arrests
[00:01:32] Unknown Host: and all kinds of drama around that.
[00:01:33] Unknown Host: So there's lots of good drama in here for you
[00:01:36] Unknown Host: who are into that.
[00:01:37] Unknown Host: But in between the drama, there's some pearls
[00:01:39] Unknown Host: of skill up CEO wisdom.
[00:01:41] Unknown Host: He's not your typical CEO.
[00:01:43] Unknown Host: He re-thinks things from scratch
[00:01:45] Unknown Host: in a way that I find compelling.
[00:01:46] Unknown Host: I like the way he thinks about hiring.
[00:01:49] Unknown Host: I think it's quite interesting how his company
[00:01:51] Unknown Host: has over 100 former founders in it.
[00:01:54] Unknown Host: I like the way he thinks about scaling
[00:01:57] Unknown Host: without getting his chloretic.
[00:01:58] Unknown Host: 4,000 people is pretty big.
[00:02:00] Unknown Host: It's still moving fast, very hard to do.
[00:02:02] Unknown Host: And I like how his chip on his shoulder
[00:02:05] Unknown Host: can supercharge his whole career.
[00:02:06] Unknown Host: And that came supercharge years, too.
[00:02:08] Unknown Host: So he's going to get into that.
[00:02:09] Unknown Host: Parker's basically written the book
[00:02:11] Unknown Host: on turning your darkest professional moment
[00:02:14] Unknown Host: into your greatest competitive advantage.
[00:02:16] Unknown Host: I hope you like it.
[00:02:18] How you doing?
[00:02:19] Doing pretty good.
[00:02:20] Unknown Host: It's Sequoia, one of the things they always talk about
[00:02:23] Unknown Host: is they like founders with chips on their shoulders.
[00:02:27] Unknown Host: Do you have a chip on your shoulder?
[00:02:28] Unknown Host: I think so.
[00:02:30] Parker Conrad: I think it's like maybe faded a little bit over time.
[00:02:33] Parker Conrad: I tried very hard to keep it home to razor sharpness.
[00:02:36] Parker Conrad: But I think certainly,
[00:02:38] Parker Conrad: Ripley was born out of this revenge fantasy.
[00:02:43] Parker Conrad: And that's what got the company going.
[00:02:46] Parker Conrad: And it's certainly what kept me going
[00:02:49] Parker Conrad: for the first couple of years.
[00:02:51] Parker Conrad: There are a lot of other things that I love about my job.
[00:02:52] Parker Conrad: I love the people I work with.
[00:02:54] Parker Conrad: I sort of really like the problems that we're solving.
[00:02:57] Parker Conrad: I feel like we're making a difference for customers
[00:03:00] Parker Conrad: in this sort of small way for their companies.
[00:03:02] Parker Conrad: And that's all extremely motivating.
[00:03:04] Parker Conrad: But yeah, early on, it's a grind
[00:03:07] Parker Conrad: when you're starting a company.
[00:03:09] Parker Conrad: And this wasn't like my first rodeo.
[00:03:11] Parker Conrad: It's my third.
[00:03:12] Parker Conrad: And doing it the third time around,
[00:03:15] Parker Conrad: I think they're really like it was helpful to have this
[00:03:18] Parker Conrad: like extra bit of motivation that was there for me.
[00:03:22] Parker Conrad: Every night when I went to bed
[00:03:24] Parker Conrad: and like every morning when I woke up,
[00:03:26] do you think that you have exacted revenge
[00:03:30] Unknown Host: on those doubters and those people who did you wrong
[00:03:34] Unknown Host: or not and do you think you'll ever put that
[00:03:37] Unknown Host: to bed in your own brain?
[00:03:40] Or is it a source of constant motivation
[00:03:42] Unknown Host: for the rest of your life?
[00:03:44] I don't know.
[00:03:45] Parker Conrad: So have you ever seen there's a South Park episode?
[00:03:47] Parker Conrad: The underpants, Nomes.
[00:03:50] Parker Conrad: I love it.
[00:03:50] Parker Conrad: It's my favorite episode.
[00:03:52] Unknown Host: So it's sort of, yeah, underpants those for people
[00:03:54] Parker Conrad: who are familiar with it.
[00:03:56] Parker Conrad: The kids sort of follow these Nomes
[00:03:57] Parker Conrad: that are like stealing everyone's underpants
[00:03:59] Parker Conrad: and they follow them to their secret underground layer.
[00:04:02] And they're like, why are you stealing everyone's underpants?
[00:04:04] Parker Conrad: And there's this sort of secret plan for world domination.
[00:04:07] Parker Conrad: And it's like step one, like steal underpants, step three,
[00:04:10] Parker Conrad: world domination.
[00:04:12] Parker Conrad: And the kids are like, what step two?
[00:04:14] Parker Conrad: And they're like, oh shit, we never really,
[00:04:16] Parker Conrad: we never really thought about that.
[00:04:17] Parker Conrad: And sometimes I think it's a little bit like that with me
[00:04:20] Parker Conrad: where it was like, I felt like when things went
[00:04:23] Parker Conrad: south as benefits, I wasn't allowed to talk about it.
[00:04:27] Parker Conrad: And the entire story was being written
[00:04:30] Parker Conrad: by sort of my antagonists that were just saying all the stuff
[00:04:34] Parker Conrad: that I felt wasn't true, wasn't actually what was going on,
[00:04:38] Parker Conrad: like it was unfair.
[00:04:39] Parker Conrad: And I couldn't do anything about it.
[00:04:41] Parker Conrad: And so for me, there was always kind of this idea
[00:04:43] Parker Conrad: where I was like step one, build this like multi hundred
[00:04:48] Parker Conrad: billion dollar outcome in like the exact same space
[00:04:51] Parker Conrad: and by doing it in exactly the opposite way
[00:04:53] Parker Conrad: of everything that they said was like the right way to do it.
[00:04:57] Parker Conrad: And then like step three was like somehow like,
[00:04:59] Parker Conrad: you know, get like revenge on all of them.
[00:05:02] Parker Conrad: And like step two was like always sort of like vaguely
[00:05:04] Parker Conrad: like how's like a connected to be was like
[00:05:06] Parker Conrad: sort of has always been sort of unclear.
[00:05:08] Parker Conrad: The company's a lot of fun.
[00:05:10] Parker Conrad: You know, like I started out and not just revenge.
[00:05:13] Parker Conrad: Yeah, I mean, everyone sort of told me what you need
[00:05:14] Parker Conrad: to develop actually early on like our series A investor.
[00:05:19] Parker Conrad: You know, I was very open about these motivations
[00:05:23] Parker Conrad: and the moon was like, he has kind of dark.
[00:05:26] Parker Conrad: Like maybe you should talk to someone about that.
[00:05:28] Parker Conrad: And actually there's like an exact coach that came in
[00:05:30] Parker Conrad: and I talked to the sky and you know, he was sort of constantly
[00:05:33] Parker Conrad: like you need to have all these positive motivations
[00:05:36] Parker Conrad: and no negative motivations.
[00:05:37] Parker Conrad: And he went and he did sort of interviews
[00:05:39] Parker Conrad: with all of my direct reports of the company.
[00:05:42] Parker Conrad: And one of his questions was like,
[00:05:43] Parker Conrad: how do you feel about the fact that Parker
[00:05:45] Parker Conrad: is like motivated in these ways?
[00:05:47] Parker Conrad: And everyone was like, I hope he never loses it.
[00:05:50] Parker Conrad: And so there was definitely like that element of it.
[00:05:54] Parker Conrad: But like over time, I think, you know,
[00:05:58] Parker Conrad: despite all of my attempts to sort of like focus
[00:06:02] Parker Conrad: my anger on this stuff, I think that yeah,
[00:06:05] Parker Conrad: like a lot of, you know, sort of day to day is like,
[00:06:08] Parker Conrad: you know, all of that stuff is very distant
[00:06:10] Parker Conrad: and it's much more about sort of the excitement
[00:06:14] Parker Conrad: of what we're building and the problems that we're solving
[00:06:17] Parker Conrad: and the people that I work with.
[00:06:19] Parker Conrad: Oh, I really enjoy working with.
[00:06:20] Parker Conrad: Yes or no, have you exacted revenge
[00:06:25] Unknown Host: on your antagonists from benefits?
[00:06:28] I don't think so.
[00:06:29] Unknown Host: Will you at some point answer that question as a yes
[00:06:33] Unknown Host: and what point is that a yes?
[00:06:35] Unknown Host: I'm not sure that there is any John
[00:06:38] billion dollar IPO kind of thing.
[00:06:41] Unknown Host: It's like, okay, check, I was right.
[00:06:45] I don't think that that, I'm not sure
[00:06:47] Parker Conrad: that like one leads to the other, you know,
[00:06:49] Parker Conrad: and I think that you don't necessarily
[00:06:51] Parker Conrad: get that kind of satisfaction.
[00:06:54] Parker Conrad: But also everything sort of fades with time.
[00:06:58] Parker Conrad: It stops being the thing that is like the focus
[00:07:03] Parker Conrad: of what you're doing every single day.
[00:07:04] Parker Conrad: I remember when that whole thing went down
[00:07:07] and then I remember you got your series A and I thought,
[00:07:13] okay, you had someone painted a scarlet letter on you
[00:07:17] Unknown Host: and I was like, it's gonna be hard for him to raise again
[00:07:20] Unknown Host: and you raise.
[00:07:21] Unknown Host: You talk about that fundraise and how did it go down
[00:07:26] Unknown Host: like getting over that must have been non-trivial.
[00:07:30] Unknown Host: It was a weird process because there were definitely,
[00:07:36] Parker Conrad: I mean, at the time, Rippling was doing really well.
[00:07:39] Parker Conrad: I mean, like the numbers, we kind of showed everyone
[00:07:41] Parker Conrad: our numbers and the numbers were quite impressive.
[00:07:44] Unknown Host: And you had a personally angel fund today, I assume.
[00:07:48] Unknown Host: You seated it.
[00:07:48] Unknown Host: I did some amount and then we raised a seed round
[00:07:52] Parker Conrad: where we had a bunch of like really early believers
[00:07:55] Parker Conrad: and a lot of them were former Zenefitz seed investors
[00:08:00] Parker Conrad: who really backed me again
[00:08:02] Parker Conrad: and a lot of sort of people in the YC community,
[00:08:05] Parker Conrad: YC partners initialized Gary Tan,
[00:08:08] Parker Conrad: the Samultman, all those guys.
[00:08:09] Parker Conrad: So you're doing the A, you got the scarlet letter.
[00:08:11] Unknown Host: And so then we went out to raise our series A
[00:08:14] Parker Conrad: and it was very controversial and there were,
[00:08:18] Parker Conrad: like every firm was really interested
[00:08:19] Parker Conrad: because the numbers were so good.
[00:08:22] Parker Conrad: And I think there were a couple of firms
[00:08:25] Parker Conrad: that went really deep.
[00:08:26] Parker Conrad: Like basically at the time,
[00:08:28] Parker Conrad: the partner at Sequoia, Mike Furnall,
[00:08:31] Parker Conrad: who was looking at the deal,
[00:08:33] Parker Conrad: Mike came to me and he said,
[00:08:34] Parker Conrad: look, there's one reason to do this deal
[00:08:37] Parker Conrad: and there's one reason not to do this deal
[00:08:39] Parker Conrad: and they're the same reason.
[00:08:41] Parker Conrad: And that was what everyone was trying to figure out.
[00:08:43] Parker Conrad: And I think Sequoia went really deep.
[00:08:49] Parker Conrad: And I think Mike told me that you guys did,
[00:08:52] Parker Conrad: I mean, because Sequoia always does this
[00:08:53] Parker Conrad: just incredibly deep diligence.
[00:08:56] Parker Conrad: You know, talk to like 50 different executives
[00:08:59] Parker Conrad: or people in management positions at Zenefitz
[00:09:01] Parker Conrad: to really understand the picture
[00:09:03] Parker Conrad: and came away with a lot of conviction
[00:09:06] that they felt like, okay, you know,
[00:09:08] Parker Conrad: Sequoia feel very, very comfort with this.
[00:09:10] Parker Conrad: Unfortunately, we didn't end up working with Sequoia
[00:09:13] Parker Conrad: at that point.
[00:09:14] Parker Conrad: It was a little bit later.
[00:09:16] But a couple of other firms did that as well
[00:09:18] Parker Conrad: and there were a couple that kind of just like backed out
[00:09:22] Parker Conrad: and you know, one firm sort of lead guy there,
[00:09:25] Parker Conrad: you know, called up David Sachs
[00:09:28] Parker Conrad: and you know, I got a phone call in the Sunday night
[00:09:31] Parker Conrad: and said, hey, so and so spoke with David,
[00:09:33] Parker Conrad: we've got to cancel the child.
[00:09:35] Parker Conrad: He met him on Monday, you know, like it was just,
[00:09:37] Parker Conrad: there was sort of a more superficial amount of diligence
[00:09:41] Parker Conrad: on it.
[00:09:42] Parker Conrad: There were these two camps.
[00:09:43] Parker Conrad: And, you know, but even so, there were enough people
[00:09:48] Parker Conrad: in the camp of like, we're excited about the business
[00:09:51] Parker Conrad: and not concerned about the history
[00:09:53] Parker Conrad: that the round was like really competitive.
[00:09:56] Parker Conrad: And yeah, it's done nice, you know, on great terms.
[00:09:58] Parker Conrad: We were pretty excited about it.
[00:09:59] Parker Conrad: And once the last time you saw David,
[00:10:01] Unknown Host: I have not spoken to him since about a week
[00:10:06] Parker Conrad: before I left benefits.
[00:10:07] Parker Conrad: I see.
[00:10:08] Parker Conrad: I've sort of like seen him across the room
[00:10:10] Parker Conrad: at a conference since then.
[00:10:12] Parker Conrad: Anything you want to say to him today?
[00:10:17] Probably not a great idea.
[00:10:19] Parker Conrad: How about, I'll say it for you.
[00:10:22] I told you so.
[00:10:23] Unknown Host: I don't actually, I don't actually think that that's what,
[00:10:27] Parker Conrad: I think like if I was talking to David or like Ben
[00:10:34] Parker Conrad: or Lars, I would really be like, why?
[00:10:37] Parker Conrad: You know, like why?
[00:10:39] Parker Conrad: Like I look at it, it just, it feels like it was so unnecessary.
[00:10:42] Parker Conrad: You know, like even in a world where they were like,
[00:10:45] Parker Conrad: hey, we've got to make a change.
[00:10:47] Parker Conrad: Like those types of things are usually not accompanied
[00:10:52] Parker Conrad: by the type of character assassination.
[00:10:54] Parker Conrad: Like, and it was like deep and prolonged effort.
[00:11:00] Like they hired people and those people were sort of doing this
[00:11:04] Parker Conrad: in the media, like pitching stories about like week
[00:11:06] Parker Conrad: after week after week.
[00:11:08] Parker Conrad: And that is just like, it's unusual, it's expensive,
[00:11:10] Parker Conrad: it's like a lot of effort.
[00:11:12] Parker Conrad: I remember I went down and I remember the media,
[00:11:14] Unknown Host: they wrote some things that were very tough.
[00:11:17] Unknown Host: They basically blamed a lot of stuff on you.
[00:11:20] Unknown Host: I don't remember the prolonged,
[00:11:22] Unknown Host: why do you think they thought that was a good idea?
[00:11:25] Unknown Host: I mean, they're relatively irrational economic actors.
[00:11:29] Some of this I think is like David.
[00:11:31] Parker Conrad: And some of this you sort of see in the way that David,
[00:11:34] Parker Conrad: I mean, is like, you know, very successful
[00:11:38] Parker Conrad: as sort of this more political type of actor.
[00:11:43] Parker Conrad: And I remember David came to me at one point,
[00:11:46] you know, it's benefits when we were having our own
[00:11:48] Parker Conrad: sort of conflict with ADP.
[00:11:50] Parker Conrad: We ended up in some litigation with them.
[00:11:52] Parker Conrad: And David told me he said, look, here's the thing.
[00:11:56] Parker Conrad: If you're ever in kind of one of these media shit fights,
[00:12:01] you want to attack, attack, attack, attack.
[00:12:05] Parker Conrad: He had to play.
[00:12:05] Parker Conrad: And if the other guy rolls over and cries uncle,
[00:12:09] Parker Conrad: that means it's working.
[00:12:11] Parker Conrad: And you want to keep attacking, attacking, attacking, attacking.
[00:12:16] Parker Conrad: And I think that that was like his playbook.
[00:12:20] Parker Conrad: Like that was sort of the way it operated.
[00:12:22] Parker Conrad: And you know, and some of it, it wasn't just that
[00:12:25] Parker Conrad: like they blamed me for everything.
[00:12:27] Parker Conrad: I mean, like, look, ultimately I'm the CEO.
[00:12:29] Parker Conrad: I am responsible for things.
[00:12:31] Parker Conrad: It was the way that things that were mistakes, you know,
[00:12:35] Parker Conrad: that were like, hey, we thought this was what we were supposed
[00:12:38] Parker Conrad: to do.
[00:12:40] And it was something else.
[00:12:41] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:12:42] Parker Conrad: We're instead the legal word for this would be like,
[00:12:44] Parker Conrad: it was like, you know, they're like,
[00:12:46] Parker Conrad: there's some intentional kind of thing
[00:12:48] Parker Conrad: for what was, I think in retrospect,
[00:12:52] Parker Conrad: much more just sort of accidental, like as companies are growing
[00:12:56] Parker Conrad: up quickly.
[00:12:57] Parker Conrad: And you know, little things that, you know,
[00:12:59] Parker Conrad: you sort of don't recognize as, or just unaware
[00:13:03] Parker Conrad: as like things that are happening, you know, suddenly
[00:13:05] Parker Conrad: are like, actually, you overlooked something.
[00:13:07] Parker Conrad: And how did you feel like when you first saw it?
[00:13:11] Unknown Host: I assume you didn't have a heads up, you saw it.
[00:13:13] Unknown Host: Like, was it anger, was it confusion?
[00:13:17] Unknown Host: What did you say to your wife?
[00:13:19] Unknown Host: Like, what was going on inside the four walls of your body?
[00:13:22] Unknown Host: One of the things that happened right before the announcement
[00:13:26] Parker Conrad: is I was like so depressed about the whole thing
[00:13:30] Parker Conrad: that I stopped looking at the media.
[00:13:34] Parker Conrad: And I didn't read stories about me or about rippling
[00:13:40] Parker Conrad: for like five or six years from that.
[00:13:44] Parker Conrad: I was a long time, or as benefits.
[00:13:47] Parker Conrad: And my wife would always read them.
[00:13:49] Parker Conrad: And so when the announcement came out,
[00:13:50] Parker Conrad: there was a press release that we had drafted,
[00:13:53] Parker Conrad: you know, that was like, you know, me and like the people
[00:13:56] Parker Conrad: from Andreessen and like David.
[00:13:59] Parker Conrad: And it was sort of one of these sort of anti-dying things
[00:14:02] Parker Conrad: that was like, hey, look, company needs new type of leadership.
[00:14:06] Unknown Host: Yeah, Parker, you know, like great job taking it this far.
[00:14:10] Parker Conrad: Yep.
[00:14:10] Parker Conrad: David coming in, wants to spend more time with this family?
[00:14:12] Parker Conrad: Typical stuff.
[00:14:13] Parker Conrad: Typical stuff.
[00:14:14] Parker Conrad: And instead, they just like David issued a different press release.
[00:14:20] Parker Conrad: And the press release was like, this company
[00:14:24] Parker Conrad: has a whole bunch of compliance problems.
[00:14:26] Parker Conrad: It's because, you know, Parker doesn't care about compliance.
[00:14:29] Parker Conrad: He's not here anymore.
[00:14:30] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:14:31] Parker Conrad: And it went south from there.
[00:14:32] Parker Conrad: And I remember, you know, when it came out,
[00:14:35] Parker Conrad: I mean, it was such a shock.
[00:14:37] Parker Conrad: It was just very unexpected.
[00:14:39] Parker Conrad: And then it just got worse from there.
[00:14:41] Parker Conrad: And it was actually my wife that read it and turned to me
[00:14:43] Parker Conrad: and said, oh, they fucked you.
[00:14:46] Parker Conrad: Like she was like, don't even read it.
[00:14:47] Parker Conrad: Like, don't look at it.
[00:14:48] Parker Conrad: It was deeply depressing.
[00:14:49] Parker Conrad: I mean, there were like really, really dark moments.
[00:14:53] Parker Conrad: And some of like the chip on the shoulder was kind of like,
[00:14:57] Parker Conrad: I'm either there was sort of this one little ray of light,
[00:15:02] Parker Conrad: this one path out, which was like, you know,
[00:15:07] Parker Conrad: build this company and make it successful.
[00:15:10] Parker Conrad: Or like, it's just all over and you kind of give up.
[00:15:12] Parker Conrad: And it was kind of like, it felt like those were the two choices
[00:15:15] Parker Conrad: and like that.
[00:15:16] Parker Conrad: And that was very hard and very depressing.
[00:15:19] Parker Conrad: But it was also like very clarifying and very motivating
[00:15:22] Parker Conrad: that I felt like, okay, like this is like,
[00:15:24] Parker Conrad: this is the only thing that I'm here for.
[00:15:26] Parker Conrad: And this is the only thing that I care about
[00:15:28] Parker Conrad: is like making this thing work.
[00:15:31] Parker Conrad: Okay.
[00:15:32] Unknown Host: A lot of people listening are founder CEOs,
[00:15:36] Unknown Host: people want to be CEOs.
[00:15:38] Unknown Host: You've been through some crises and some shit shows.
[00:15:41] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:15:42] Unknown Host: I have to advice for people.
[00:15:46] Crisis going on.
[00:15:48] Most CEOs hit some big shit show crises during their tenure.
[00:15:53] Unknown Host: Any advice?
[00:15:55] People come to me all the time.
[00:15:56] Parker Conrad: They're like, oh, I'm like thinking about doing,
[00:15:57] Parker Conrad: you know, I'm sorry to accompany, what do you think?
[00:15:58] Parker Conrad: And my advice is always like, don't do it.
[00:16:00] Parker Conrad: It's terrible idea.
[00:16:01] Parker Conrad: And like, and people always sort of laugh.
[00:16:04] Parker Conrad: They're like, aha, but like, it's very like,
[00:16:07] Parker Conrad: it's very real.
[00:16:08] Parker Conrad: Like I do think that it is like,
[00:16:11] Parker Conrad: like much, much harder than people expect.
[00:16:14] Parker Conrad: It's not just that it's hard to be successful.
[00:16:16] Parker Conrad: It's that it's sort of really kind of soul-destroying,
[00:16:19] Parker Conrad: like even when you're successful.
[00:16:21] Parker Conrad: And very hard to kind of manage your psychology
[00:16:24] Parker Conrad: through that process.
[00:16:27] Parker Conrad: And people come out the other end.
[00:16:28] Parker Conrad: And there's a lot of, you know,
[00:16:30] Parker Conrad: there's a lot of, I think, talk about, you know,
[00:16:33] Parker Conrad: failure being sort of this positive thing
[00:16:35] Parker Conrad: that you've learned a lot from.
[00:16:37] Parker Conrad: And actually, I think you don't learn a whole lot from failure.
[00:16:41] Parker Conrad: And you learn a lot more from success.
[00:16:44] Parker Conrad: And it's really hard.
[00:16:46] Parker Conrad: You know, usually I think people,
[00:16:47] Parker Conrad: I see many more people that do something like this
[00:16:50] Parker Conrad: and don't succeed.
[00:16:51] Parker Conrad: And it sort of like destroys a lot.
[00:16:54] Parker Conrad: You know, it destroys marriages, relationships,
[00:17:00] Parker Conrad: you know, ambitions, you know, like people kind of
[00:17:04] Parker Conrad: come out like a shell.
[00:17:06] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:17:06] Parker Conrad: They're former selves.
[00:17:07] Parker Conrad: And so it's not something that I'd recommend.
[00:17:10] Parker Conrad: I kind of agree.
[00:17:11] Unknown Host: I describe HubSpot as like two steps forward.
[00:17:14] Unknown Host: One giant step back, two steps forward.
[00:17:16] Unknown Host: One giant step back.
[00:17:18] Unknown Host: Go over and over again.
[00:17:19] Unknown Host: It was, it looked smooth and easy from the outside.
[00:17:21] Unknown Host: But man, it was a grind.
[00:17:23] Unknown Host: It was not easy.
[00:17:24] Unknown Host: And there were, there were a lot of moments
[00:17:26] Unknown Host: where I really hated my job.
[00:17:28] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:17:29] Unknown Host: You feel the same way.
[00:17:31] Yeah, I mean, I would say that one thing
[00:17:34] Parker Conrad: that was different about Ripley,
[00:17:36] Parker Conrad: I think in part because of the experience,
[00:17:39] Parker Conrad: it's benefits.
[00:17:40] Parker Conrad: Like people sometimes ask me like, you know, what I learned
[00:17:42] Parker Conrad: and you know, sort of, there's like,
[00:17:44] Parker Conrad: insuciently I'm kind of like, I didn't learn anything.
[00:17:47] Parker Conrad: Like, you know, if benefits failed for dumb reasons
[00:17:49] Parker Conrad: and like, there was nothing to learn from that.
[00:17:52] Parker Conrad: But I do think that like, you know, over time
[00:17:55] Parker Conrad: you sort of slowly accumulate a kind of pattern recognition
[00:17:59] Parker Conrad: about like what matters and what doesn't.
[00:18:01] Parker Conrad: And that can, that makes things a little bit easier
[00:18:05] Parker Conrad: because there are a lot of things that come up
[00:18:08] Parker Conrad: where you're like, this probably doesn't matter.
[00:18:10] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:18:11] Parker Conrad: Okay.
[00:18:12] Parker Conrad: When it sucks, but like, it's no where's near.
[00:18:14] Parker Conrad: And no matter how bad things have ever been at Ripley,
[00:18:17] Parker Conrad: they have never come even close
[00:18:19] Parker Conrad: to how bad things were in the sort of six months,
[00:18:23] Parker Conrad: like, you know, right after the end of benefits
[00:18:26] Parker Conrad: or one or one I left benefits.
[00:18:27] Parker Conrad: And so everything kind of pales in comparison.
[00:18:30] Parker Conrad: And that is always the sort of comforting in a way.
[00:18:34] Parker Conrad: What?
[00:18:35] You brought something up.
[00:18:36] What matters and what doesn't?
[00:18:39] Unknown Host: Like what matters that people don't think matter
[00:18:41] Unknown Host: and what doesn't matter that people think matters?
[00:18:43] Unknown Host: I mean, sort of the advantage of having done something before,
[00:18:46] Parker Conrad: I think you start to have good judgment about what is,
[00:18:51] Parker Conrad: you know, cause so many of the things that come up
[00:18:53] Parker Conrad: are probably like, doesn't matter.
[00:18:56] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:18:57] Parker Conrad: Not gonna make a difference.
[00:18:58] Parker Conrad: Things come up are like, ooh, that one's gonna count.
[00:19:01] Parker Conrad: And I think it's hard for first time CEOs
[00:19:06] Parker Conrad: to really see the difference.
[00:19:07] Parker Conrad: But you know, it feels like everything's gonna matter.
[00:19:10] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:19:10] Parker Conrad: And that's part of why it's like so overwhelming and awful.
[00:19:14] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:19:14] Parker Conrad: And some of the things really actually do matter.
[00:19:16] Parker Conrad: What really matters?
[00:19:19] I think getting your strategy right,
[00:19:21] Unknown Host: like where are we headed in the bus
[00:19:24] Unknown Host: and getting the right people on the team
[00:19:27] Unknown Host: are really important things.
[00:19:29] Unknown Host: And a lot of other stuff can fall by the wayside.
[00:19:32] Unknown Host: Yeah, I mean, those things matter.
[00:19:33] Parker Conrad: And getting like your mission set up
[00:19:35] Unknown Host: so people can get excited about the darn thing.
[00:19:38] Yeah, I'm trying to think like,
[00:19:40] I mean, I think like there are little things
[00:19:42] Parker Conrad: that go wrong that feel very consequential in the moment
[00:19:44] Parker Conrad: that you start to realize over time don't matter.
[00:19:48] Parker Conrad: And like if you're not growing that obviously matters,
[00:19:53] Parker Conrad: at Ripley and it took us like two years to get to a point
[00:19:57] Parker Conrad: where things started working.
[00:19:58] Parker Conrad: Yeah, I was about that too.
[00:20:00] Unknown Host: And like for two years,
[00:20:02] Parker Conrad: it was sort of this exercise to try and like basically
[00:20:05] Parker Conrad: beg the team not to leave until things started working.
[00:20:09] Parker Conrad: Yeah, but there was also like zero doubt in my mind
[00:20:13] Parker Conrad: that it was going to work.
[00:20:14] Parker Conrad: And that was sort of a big difference
[00:20:17] Parker Conrad: because like I sort of knew that like if you built these things
[00:20:22] Parker Conrad: and got to this sort of, you know,
[00:20:25] Parker Conrad: this island of product market fit
[00:20:27] Parker Conrad: that was admittedly pretty far over the edge of the horizon line.
[00:20:31] Parker Conrad: But like I knew that there was land out there.
[00:20:34] Parker Conrad: And that if you could get there, this was going to work.
[00:20:38] Parker Conrad: And I, you know, I mean,
[00:20:39] Parker Conrad: seeing what was working and why it's benefits,
[00:20:42] Parker Conrad: I just had like unshakable convictions.
[00:20:45] Parker Conrad: And so there was never a doubt that was going to work.
[00:20:48] Parker Conrad: And it was merely about like whether like right,
[00:20:51] Parker Conrad: frankly we could keep prevent everyone from quitting
[00:20:54] Parker Conrad: like before we got there.
[00:20:56] Parker Conrad: And so early on actually like,
[00:20:58] Parker Conrad: you know, trying to just keep the team together.
[00:21:00] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:21:00] Parker Conrad: Mattered a lot.
[00:21:02] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:21:02] Parker Conrad: And at that point, whether it was like working today
[00:21:05] Parker Conrad: or not like didn't so much
[00:21:07] Parker Conrad: in this very specific context of the company
[00:21:10] Parker Conrad: that I was building.
[00:21:11] Parker Conrad: And I think for a lot of other companies,
[00:21:12] Parker Conrad: that's not true because like, you know,
[00:21:15] Parker Conrad: you might believe that these are gonna work,
[00:21:17] Parker Conrad: but you're probably wrong.
[00:21:19] Parker Conrad: Or you know, like you're,
[00:21:19] Parker Conrad: if you have a lot of conviction about it,
[00:21:21] Parker Conrad: your conviction is like misplaced.
[00:21:23] Parker Conrad: Maybe mine was too, but I, you know,
[00:21:25] Parker Conrad: like I was sort of crazy enough or believed
[00:21:27] Parker Conrad: that I had reasons to believe that this was going to work.
[00:21:30] Parker Conrad: Parker, you're kind of a contrarian along a lot of lines.
[00:21:36] Unknown Host: That's one of the things I've always liked about you.
[00:21:38] Unknown Host: What do people have totally wrong about being a CEO?
[00:21:43] Unknown Host: Like there seems to be sort of a rule book around it
[00:21:47] Unknown Host: that is kind of getting rethought these days.
[00:21:49] Unknown Host: And I feel like you're rethinking pieces of it.
[00:21:51] Unknown Host: What's all wrong about CEO-ing?
[00:21:57] What are these founder CEOs?
[00:21:59] Unknown Host: What mistakes are they making?
[00:22:01] Well, I'll tell you, I mean, I don't know.
[00:22:05] Parker Conrad: I know so little about like any business that's not my own.
[00:22:08] Parker Conrad: So it's hard for me to have like big opinions
[00:22:12] Parker Conrad: about like sort of the ecosystem.
[00:22:14] Parker Conrad: But I think that like one thing that I,
[00:22:17] Parker Conrad: that I sort of believe in that maybe is becoming
[00:22:21] Parker Conrad: like more sort of more of the conventional wisdom today.
[00:22:29] Is I've always struggled with the idea
[00:22:31] Parker Conrad: that as a CEO, you're supposed to kind of manage top down
[00:22:34] Parker Conrad: through a set of deputies.
[00:22:36] Parker Conrad: And you know, you hire people who are knowledgeable
[00:22:39] Parker Conrad: about this area, you trust them
[00:22:41] Parker Conrad: and you let them kind of do their thing.
[00:22:44] Parker Conrad: And that's just never worked for me.
[00:22:45] Parker Conrad: Like what's worked is you kind of have to reason
[00:22:51] Parker Conrad: from first principles.
[00:22:52] Parker Conrad: And you could do that with some of your lieutenants
[00:22:55] Parker Conrad: who can help you through it to sort of convince yourself
[00:22:58] Parker Conrad: of exactly what the right approach is in that area.
[00:23:01] Parker Conrad: And you have to have like real on the ground understanding
[00:23:06] Parker Conrad: of what's actually going on yourself.
[00:23:10] Parker Conrad: And if you don't have that, like that's the only thing
[00:23:13] Parker Conrad: that's worked for me.
[00:23:16] Parker Conrad: And it's really, it's tough to scale.
[00:23:18] Parker Conrad: It's tough to scale that.
[00:23:20] Parker Conrad: It's hard on you.
[00:23:21] Parker Conrad: I think it's hard on some of the other people.
[00:23:22] Parker Conrad: But it's the only thing that sort of work for me
[00:23:27] Parker Conrad: and the only thing that's the thing that's really worked
[00:23:28] Parker Conrad: for Ripley and so we have a leadership principle
[00:23:32] Parker Conrad: that we formalize on this that we call go and see.
[00:23:34] Parker Conrad: That's basically like, look, if you're, it's true for me,
[00:23:38] Parker Conrad: but it's also true for executives and managers
[00:23:41] Parker Conrad: that like, you've gotta go right to the ground.
[00:23:46] Parker Conrad: Cold face.
[00:23:47] Unknown Host: Yeah, and get, that's a good way of saying it, right?
[00:23:51] Parker Conrad: And you've gotta, you know, something,
[00:23:53] Parker Conrad: there was a point in time where things were just like,
[00:23:56] Parker Conrad: really going wrong with tax operations.
[00:24:00] Parker Conrad: And like, you know, we're a payroll company.
[00:24:02] Parker Conrad: One of the things that we do is we do,
[00:24:04] Parker Conrad: you know, we do these sort of quarterly filings for clients
[00:24:08] Parker Conrad: and, you know, there are thousands of agencies
[00:24:10] Parker Conrad: across the country that you need to send these to.
[00:24:13] Parker Conrad: And there are a million little things that can go wrong.
[00:24:15] Parker Conrad: And if anything's off by like a penny clients get like
[00:24:18] Parker Conrad: angry letters about this and it's really bad,
[00:24:21] Parker Conrad: things were going wrong.
[00:24:22] Parker Conrad: Like the notice, the rate at which clients were getting notices
[00:24:25] Parker Conrad: from Ripley and we knew was like higher
[00:24:27] Parker Conrad: than the notice rate at other companies
[00:24:29] Parker Conrad: and it was like an existential threat to the business.
[00:24:33] Parker Conrad: And like, that was something where there was some
[00:24:34] Parker Conrad: muscle memory for me that this was actually something
[00:24:37] Parker Conrad: that we killed the company.
[00:24:38] Parker Conrad: That matters.
[00:24:38] Parker Conrad: It was something that matters.
[00:24:40] Parker Conrad: You know, the only thing that worked to solve it was,
[00:24:44] Parker Conrad: you know, was what happened is I got, you know,
[00:24:47] Parker Conrad: like me and my COO and like, you know,
[00:24:51] Parker Conrad: the person running the team and like someone else,
[00:24:53] Parker Conrad: we sort of wiped out our calendars and we sat down
[00:24:56] Parker Conrad: and we said, for the next week, you know,
[00:24:58] we're gonna just be tax ops agents.
[00:25:02] Parker Conrad: And so we're literally going to, you know,
[00:25:04] Parker Conrad: because there was this growing backlog of notices
[00:25:06] Parker Conrad: that needed to be addressed that clients were sending us.
[00:25:08] Parker Conrad: And we're just gonna pick from the queue
[00:25:11] Parker Conrad: and start figuring out, like, calling up the tax agency,
[00:25:15] Parker Conrad: why did the client get this notice?
[00:25:17] Parker Conrad: What happened, you know, why did they believe that,
[00:25:20] Parker Conrad: you know, the amount was wrong or the money didn't get there
[00:25:23] Parker Conrad: or the filing was not on time or something.
[00:25:26] Parker Conrad: And then reverse engineer it in our systems and be like,
[00:25:29] Parker Conrad: and it was just like doing the actual work of doing,
[00:25:32] Parker Conrad: it was the only, and then sort of like,
[00:25:35] Parker Conrad: by doing that, we developed this understanding of like,
[00:25:37] Parker Conrad: what was broken about the process,
[00:25:39] Parker Conrad: what was broken about the systems,
[00:25:40] Parker Conrad: what were the changes that need to be made?
[00:25:42] Parker Conrad: But it was like impossible to diagnose or understand
[00:25:46] Parker Conrad: without sitting there and doing that.
[00:25:48] Parker Conrad: Okay.
[00:25:49] Unknown Host: On the matters thing, it seems to me from just listening to you
[00:25:53] Unknown Host: and I also spoke to a couple of people on your team,
[00:25:55] Unknown Host: a lot of things matter.
[00:25:57] Unknown Host: And then one of the insights I think you've had is,
[00:26:00] Unknown Host: details matter from the CEO on down.
[00:26:03] Unknown Host: And you're in the details in a big way
[00:26:06] Unknown Host: for a company that has four, four, five thousand employees.
[00:26:09] Unknown Host: Is that fair to say?
[00:26:12] Unknown Host: I think more so than me for sure.
[00:26:15] Unknown Host: It seems like you are,
[00:26:16] Unknown Host: like you sit in the middle of the engineering floor,
[00:26:19] Unknown Host: it sounds like you are on the coal phase for somebody
[00:26:22] Unknown Host: in a pretty good size organization.
[00:26:24] Unknown Host: I certainly try to be.
[00:26:28] Parker Conrad: I view that as like a huge compliment,
[00:26:29] Parker Conrad: if you know, from the team.
[00:26:31] Parker Conrad: I think the place where I try and do that the most,
[00:26:35] Parker Conrad: and what's maybe sort of most unusual about RIPLIN
[00:26:39] Parker Conrad: is that I'm the only like full admin
[00:26:44] Parker Conrad: for RIPLIN and RIPLIN.
[00:26:45] Parker Conrad: And so like I run payroll for the entire company
[00:26:49] Parker Conrad: across dozens of countries.
[00:26:50] Parker Conrad: I manage sort of like benefits and you know,
[00:26:54] Parker Conrad: a lot of like, you know, IT policies and other stuff
[00:26:56] Parker Conrad: within the system.
[00:26:58] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:26:59] Parker Conrad: You know, approve expense reimbursements, things like that.
[00:27:02] Parker Conrad: I was similar to HubSpot.
[00:27:03] Unknown Host: I was a very active user of HubSpot,
[00:27:07] Unknown Host: one of the most active user for many years.
[00:27:09] Unknown Host: So I think it's important.
[00:27:10] Unknown Host: It's like one of the things like people,
[00:27:12] Parker Conrad: you know, learn when they join RIPLIN
[00:27:13] Parker Conrad: is like the CEO approves every expense reimbursement
[00:27:16] Parker Conrad: over $10.
[00:27:18] Parker Conrad: And the reason for that is like not that I'm like this jerk
[00:27:22] that's like harassing people about their expenses.
[00:27:26] Parker Conrad: It's that I'm trying to actually use the product
[00:27:29] Parker Conrad: in the same ways that clients would,
[00:27:31] Parker Conrad: like a diligent controller or, you know,
[00:27:35] Parker Conrad: sort of accountant would use the system
[00:27:37] Parker Conrad: and help review it in the same ways that they would
[00:27:39] Parker Conrad: and try and use that to sort of iterate
[00:27:41] Parker Conrad: and improve on things over time.
[00:27:43] Parker Conrad: There are a lot of things that we get wrong as a company,
[00:27:46] Parker Conrad: but I do think that that element is like
[00:27:49] Parker Conrad: a little bit of a superpower because I know that,
[00:27:53] the CEOs of ADP or they're not doing that.
[00:27:58] Unknown Host: They're like, hey, you've never run payroll in their lives.
[00:28:01] Parker Conrad: Like never.
[00:28:02] Parker Conrad: No way.
[00:28:03] Parker Conrad: You know, there's a sort of on the ground
[00:28:06] Parker Conrad: understanding the system and that, you know,
[00:28:08] Parker Conrad: that doesn't mean that, you know,
[00:28:09] Parker Conrad: we always get everything right,
[00:28:10] Parker Conrad: but I think that, you know, it's a sort of control
[00:28:15] Parker Conrad: on the system and one of the ways that it played,
[00:28:18] Parker Conrad: one of the things that I'm most proud about
[00:28:20] Parker Conrad: is that we did this study where we looked at companies
[00:28:24] Parker Conrad: that use RIPLIN and companies that use anything
[00:28:28] Parker Conrad: other than RIPLIN.
[00:28:29] Parker Conrad: And some of them use like modern systems, competitors
[00:28:33] Parker Conrad: of ours that are sort of more recent market entrance.
[00:28:35] Parker Conrad: Some of them use the more old school systems
[00:28:37] Parker Conrad: and you just look at how many people those companies have
[00:28:41] Parker Conrad: in HR, IT and finance roles and GNA roles
[00:28:45] Parker Conrad: within the organization based on LinkedIn data.
[00:28:48] Parker Conrad: And what you find is that the companies that use RIPLIN
[00:28:50] Parker Conrad: at any even size range.
[00:28:52] Parker Conrad: So you'd have to look at it by company size, obviously.
[00:28:56] Parker Conrad: You know, companies that use RIPLIN have about half
[00:28:58] Parker Conrad: the people in those functions,
[00:29:00] Parker Conrad: then companies that use anything.
[00:29:02] Parker Conrad: I love that stem.
[00:29:03] Parker Conrad: I love that stem.
[00:29:04] Parker Conrad: And that's, look, I think that that, you know,
[00:29:06] Parker Conrad: it's not that, you know, our pitch is not like,
[00:29:07] Parker Conrad: hey, like, you know, like lay off people if you use RIPLIN,
[00:29:10] Parker Conrad: it's those extra head count,
[00:29:12] Parker Conrad: they represent all of this administrative burden.
[00:29:15] Parker Conrad: They represent attacks on your business
[00:29:18] Parker Conrad: because those are people that are just moving data
[00:29:23] Parker Conrad: between systems dealing with administrative pain.
[00:29:26] Parker Conrad: That you could instead redeploy for things
[00:29:29] Parker Conrad: that matter within your business.
[00:29:30] Parker Conrad: A parker, so you're in the details.
[00:29:32] Unknown Host: You just talk about your own CEO journey from like,
[00:29:36] Unknown Host: the four of you, to those 40 of you,
[00:29:38] Unknown Host: to those 400 of you, is 4,000 of you.
[00:29:41] Unknown Host: Somehow you've managed to say in the details,
[00:29:43] Unknown Host: how has your job changed?
[00:29:45] Unknown Host: What advice do you give to that founder
[00:29:47] Unknown Host: with 40 people on how to scale it?
[00:29:50] Unknown Host: How did your job change?
[00:29:52] Unknown Host: And how did your day-to-day change?
[00:29:55] Unknown Host: I think probably the most important thing
[00:29:58] Parker Conrad: was the people a level below me.
[00:30:03] Parker Conrad: And honestly, I think probably their jobs have changed
[00:30:06] Parker Conrad: a lot more.
[00:30:06] Parker Conrad: Interesting.
[00:30:07] Parker Conrad: Then mine has, because-
[00:30:09] Parker Conrad: Interesting.
[00:30:10] Parker Conrad: The executive team at RIPLIN has been pretty stable
[00:30:15] Parker Conrad: over time.
[00:30:16] Parker Conrad: There's been some turnover,
[00:30:18] Parker Conrad: but I think a lot of the people that are there,
[00:30:21] Parker Conrad: like the R-C-R-O, was the eighth person in the company.
[00:30:26] Parker Conrad: And my COO joined right after the series A,
[00:30:30] Parker Conrad: but he and I had known each other since college.
[00:30:34] Parker Conrad: So we've been friends for a long time.
[00:30:36] Parker Conrad: There have been a bunch of people
[00:30:37] Parker Conrad: that have been there a long time.
[00:30:40] Parker Conrad: And so there's just, I think, a lot of trust.
[00:30:44] Parker Conrad: I think everyone's grown in their function
[00:30:49] Parker Conrad: and in their job for time.
[00:30:51] Unknown Host: One of the things I've noticed part of VCs do
[00:30:53] Unknown Host: is as soon as they make their investment,
[00:30:54] Unknown Host: like the first thing they say is,
[00:30:56] Unknown Host: we got to up level the team.
[00:30:58] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:30:59] Unknown Host: And when I look at the best companies,
[00:31:01] Unknown Host: a lot of the management teams are kind of homegrown.
[00:31:04] Unknown Host: A lot of HubSpots management team been there
[00:31:07] Unknown Host: since the pretty early days.
[00:31:10] Unknown Host: What do you think of that advice?
[00:31:11] Unknown Host: I think homegrown is really underrated.
[00:31:13] Unknown Host: Homegrown's underrated, but also,
[00:31:15] Parker Conrad: sometimes the people that you're trying to grow
[00:31:19] Parker Conrad: are not going to make it.
[00:31:20] Parker Conrad: And sometimes.
[00:31:20] Parker Conrad: And so I think what I would say is hiring people
[00:31:25] Parker Conrad: that you just are really close to,
[00:31:28] Parker Conrad: I mean, we were just saying,
[00:31:29] Parker Conrad: but hiring people that you've worked with,
[00:31:32] Parker Conrad: that you're friends with, that you enjoy working with.
[00:31:34] Parker Conrad: Really low as the rest.
[00:31:35] Unknown Host: Really underrated, actually.
[00:31:37] Parker Conrad: Yeah, and low as the rest is underrated.
[00:31:39] Unknown Host: And so...
[00:31:40] Unknown Host: Went to school with...
[00:31:42] Yeah, there are people that we brought in that,
[00:31:44] Parker Conrad: we hired that were not like that
[00:31:46] Parker Conrad: that had been unbelievably successful as well.
[00:31:48] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:31:50] Parker Conrad: But there is something to the fact that like...
[00:31:54] Parker Conrad: You know, for a long time, Ripley and CMO,
[00:31:58] Parker Conrad: he's now stepped into a different role,
[00:31:59] Parker Conrad: but was this guy Matt Epstein,
[00:32:01] Parker Conrad: who was like, you know, I worked with him as CMO,
[00:32:05] Parker Conrad: my first company, he was CMO.
[00:32:06] Parker Conrad: It's benefits.
[00:32:08] Parker Conrad: He joined Ripley and was CMO Ripley.
[00:32:09] Parker Conrad: Like it was just this longstanding,
[00:32:13] Parker Conrad: like professional relationship that I had.
[00:32:15] Parker Conrad: And there's sort of something to that.
[00:32:19] Parker Conrad: I feel like I have a pretty good sense of whether
[00:32:22] Parker Conrad: someone's gonna make it or not.
[00:32:24] Parker Conrad: And I'm sort of wondering like,
[00:32:25] Parker Conrad: how would I do your job at Sequoia
[00:32:28] Parker Conrad: and advise like an entrepreneur on their team?
[00:32:32] Parker Conrad: I would have a lot of humility about it,
[00:32:34] Parker Conrad: and I'd be like, man, I just don't,
[00:32:35] Parker Conrad: I don't know how I would explain that or judge that.
[00:32:38] Parker Conrad: And one of the problems I think for investors
[00:32:40] Parker Conrad: is I think it's actually really hard to do from the outside.
[00:32:44] Parker Conrad: And so even if you have like done it yourself,
[00:32:47] Parker Conrad: you're just not spending enough time at the company
[00:32:51] Parker Conrad: to really know about this exec
[00:32:54] Parker Conrad: and whether they're gonna make it.
[00:32:55] Parker Conrad: And so the advice is like maybe not all that useful.
[00:32:59] Parker Conrad: And then, you know, if you're an entrepreneur
[00:33:02] Parker Conrad: doing this for the first time,
[00:33:04] it just, I don't see how anyone figures.
[00:33:06] Parker Conrad: I mean, looking back, I'm like,
[00:33:08] Parker Conrad: I don't understand how anyone figures their way through this
[00:33:10] Parker Conrad: because it seems like so hard to know having not seen it.
[00:33:13] Parker Conrad: But some of the one thing I've noticed
[00:33:14] Unknown Host: was so many of the early stage mid-stage startups
[00:33:18] Unknown Host: is their hit rate on hiring that external bin there,
[00:33:21] Unknown Host: done that, CMO, CWD.
[00:33:23] Unknown Host: It's 50% within 18 months.
[00:33:25] Unknown Host: It's much harder than it looks.
[00:33:27] Unknown Host: People don't talk about it.
[00:33:29] Unknown Host: What have in this vein,
[00:33:31] Unknown Host: you're interviewing somebody,
[00:33:33] Unknown Host: what's your filter, what are you looking for?
[00:33:37] Unknown Host: What's your process, is there anything unusual
[00:33:40] Unknown Host: you're doing around there
[00:33:41] Unknown Host: that you think you might be have some intuition
[00:33:44] Unknown Host: that people don't?
[00:33:44] Unknown Host: Here's what I do.
[00:33:45] Parker Conrad: And I'm not saying that what I do
[00:33:47] Parker Conrad: is like the right thing to do.
[00:33:48] Parker Conrad: But usually what I do is I send candidates
[00:33:53] Parker Conrad: all of the investor materials that I prepare.
[00:33:56] Parker Conrad: So I send them like we write up a memo on the business,
[00:33:58] Parker Conrad: there's like some metrics.
[00:34:00] Parker Conrad: And I send all of that to them ahead of time
[00:34:02] Parker Conrad: so they have context.
[00:34:03] Parker Conrad: And they show up to the meeting,
[00:34:05] Parker Conrad: and I'm just like, look, this first meeting
[00:34:08] Parker Conrad: is really just a chance for you to ask me questions.
[00:34:11] Parker Conrad: So, sure you had a chance to look through this.
[00:34:14] Parker Conrad: What didn't make sense to you?
[00:34:17] Parker Conrad: What were you like?
[00:34:18] Parker Conrad: I don't think that's right.
[00:34:19] Parker Conrad: What did you have questions on,
[00:34:21] Parker Conrad: unless talk through it?
[00:34:22] Parker Conrad: And then usually we sort of talk through their questions.
[00:34:26] Parker Conrad: And sort of secretly,
[00:34:29] Parker Conrad: I'm sort of judging them by how that conversation progresses.
[00:34:33] Parker Conrad: And so some people have no questions.
[00:34:36] Parker Conrad: And that's usually a pretty bad sign.
[00:34:39] Parker Conrad: Or some people have clearly fake questions.
[00:34:42] Parker Conrad: And some people, actually even very skeptical questions
[00:34:46] Parker Conrad: are really good.
[00:34:47] Parker Conrad: If you're smart, there are some people that immediately get
[00:34:51] Parker Conrad: to the core of the issue,
[00:34:53] Parker Conrad: where they identify the two things
[00:34:55] Parker Conrad: that are going to really be problems.
[00:34:57] Parker Conrad: And then sometimes we have a great discussion about it.
[00:35:00] Parker Conrad: Because I've thought about those things too.
[00:35:04] Parker Conrad: I spend a lot of time.
[00:35:05] Parker Conrad: Here's how we're approaching.
[00:35:06] Parker Conrad: Here's what I think.
[00:35:07] Parker Conrad: And here's what didn't work.
[00:35:09] Parker Conrad: And here's what I think is going to work.
[00:35:10] Parker Conrad: And this is why this is so important.
[00:35:12] Parker Conrad: And sometimes the people that ask those really challenging
[00:35:15] Parker Conrad: questions, they get it really quickly.
[00:35:17] Parker Conrad: And they're like, oh yeah.
[00:35:19] Parker Conrad: And that means also that,
[00:35:20] Parker Conrad: and then as a consequence of that.
[00:35:23] Parker Conrad: And I think it works because it kind of simulates
[00:35:26] Parker Conrad: the actual working relationship
[00:35:28] Parker Conrad: as going to be like where we're going to have
[00:35:29] Parker Conrad: those types of conversations in our one-on-one meetings.
[00:35:33] Parker Conrad: I love this.
[00:35:34] Parker Conrad: And that's going to work.
[00:35:35] Parker Conrad: So that's always been the thing that's been most telling for me.
[00:35:39] Parker Conrad: That and back-channel references.
[00:35:40] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:35:41] Parker Conrad: No, not.
[00:35:42] Parker Conrad: I usually ask people, give me six references.
[00:35:48] Parker Conrad: Not two, because everyone's got two.
[00:35:50] Parker Conrad: So give me six.
[00:35:51] Parker Conrad: And then I call two randomly from that list.
[00:35:54] Parker Conrad: And then I try really hard to find people
[00:35:55] Parker Conrad: that are not on your list.
[00:35:56] Parker Conrad: I'm the same.
[00:35:57] Parker Conrad: And that's been really telling.
[00:36:00] Parker Conrad: The thing that I've always, I don't have a good answer for,
[00:36:03] Parker Conrad: is I found it's really hard to summon great executives
[00:36:08] Parker Conrad: on demand.
[00:36:09] Parker Conrad: And so, wait, what do you mean by that?
[00:36:11] Parker Conrad: Well, it's like someone suddenly someone reaps.
[00:36:14] Parker Conrad: Or someone is like, it's like not going to make it.
[00:36:16] Parker Conrad: And you're like, crap, I need a CTO.
[00:36:20] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:36:21] Parker Conrad: Our current CTO who's amazing was someone
[00:36:26] Parker Conrad: that randomly fell into my lap.
[00:36:31] Parker Conrad: That someone at Sequoia introduced me to.
[00:36:35] Parker Conrad: And it was like, wow, this is amazing.
[00:36:39] Parker Conrad: And it was very clear that this person was exactly who we
[00:36:43] Parker Conrad: should hire.
[00:36:44] Parker Conrad: But we'd hired someone else six months earlier.
[00:36:49] Parker Conrad: It was not working now.
[00:36:50] Parker Conrad: And we hired that person.
[00:36:52] Parker Conrad: Sort of like it was one of those things
[00:36:54] Parker Conrad: where we had been looking for so long.
[00:36:56] Parker Conrad: Yeah, you gave up.
[00:36:58] Parker Conrad: It was like, oh, maybe it'll work.
[00:37:04] Parker Conrad: And we had, does that ever work?
[00:37:06] Parker Conrad: Never.
[00:37:07] Parker Conrad: Never does.
[00:37:07] Parker Conrad: But what are you going to, I mean, like we've been looking,
[00:37:10] Parker Conrad: I don't know, I think we've been looking for like a year.
[00:37:13] Unknown Host: It's just, you know, all the his direct reports report
[00:37:15] Unknown Host: to you in the meantime, which is like brutal.
[00:37:18] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:37:18] Unknown Host: And so, and, you know, and so what, I mean,
[00:37:21] Parker Conrad: I'll tell you what doesn't work is like usually,
[00:37:24] Parker Conrad: like, exact recruiters don't work.
[00:37:26] Parker Conrad: OK.
[00:37:27] Unknown Host: I was just about to ask you that, OK?
[00:37:30] Exact recruiters are, you know, great at sending you solid B
[00:37:36] Parker Conrad: candidates.
[00:37:37] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:37:38] And there's always the exception that proves the rules.
[00:37:41] Parker Conrad: So we hired our CFO, who's amazing.
[00:37:45] Parker Conrad: Good person to hire through in a second.
[00:37:47] Unknown Host: Through an executive.
[00:37:48] Parker Conrad: Like actually like really incredible.
[00:37:50] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:37:51] Unknown Host: And so there are some exceptions.
[00:37:53] Parker Conrad: But usually they send you a lot of B candidates.
[00:37:57] Parker Conrad: And the problem is that I think the really incredible people,
[00:38:02] Parker Conrad: they get snatched up totally before they know for they leave
[00:38:05] Parker Conrad: with an exact recruiter.
[00:38:06] Parker Conrad: Like they're, they're like, you know,
[00:38:08] Parker Conrad: they've always got people paying them.
[00:38:11] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:38:11] Parker Conrad: And they get a million options.
[00:38:12] Parker Conrad: And they've got, they've got relationships with people
[00:38:14] Parker Conrad: and someone is yanking them out.
[00:38:16] Parker Conrad: And like they sort of, you know, they sort of secretly whisper
[00:38:20] Parker Conrad: to their spouse that maybe they're thinking about leaving.
[00:38:23] Parker Conrad: And there's five people next morning that heard about it.
[00:38:26] Parker Conrad: And are already like, you know,
[00:38:27] Parker Conrad: been talking with them for a long time.
[00:38:29] Parker Conrad: And it worked with them before and have been nurturing them.
[00:38:31] Parker Conrad: They're on drip marketing campaign.
[00:38:33] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:38:33] Unknown Host: Make it into the, okay.
[00:38:35] Unknown Host: Let me ask the related to this.
[00:38:37] Unknown Host: You hire someone.
[00:38:38] Unknown Host: It's a month in.
[00:38:39] Unknown Host: You're like, I might have fucked this up.
[00:38:44] But it ended up working.
[00:38:45] Unknown Host: Has that ever happened?
[00:38:46] Unknown Host: Never.
[00:38:48] Okay.
[00:38:48] So a month in if you, if your gut tells you it's not right,
[00:38:52] Unknown Host: you, but you just, how long do you wait?
[00:38:56] Always longer than a month.
[00:38:58] Unknown Host: How long do you wait?
[00:38:59] Unknown Host: Six months?
[00:39:00] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:39:00] Unknown Host: I mean, I, like, in the frustrating thing is like,
[00:39:04] Parker Conrad: I see this behavior in managers at Ripley
[00:39:07] Parker Conrad: and I get very upset about it.
[00:39:09] Parker Conrad: And I'm already angry about it.
[00:39:10] Parker Conrad: Like, what?
[00:39:12] Parker Conrad: Did you, why did you fuck this up?
[00:39:14] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:39:15] Parker Conrad: Like, you can see it happening.
[00:39:16] Parker Conrad: Like I have this conversation all the time where I'm like,
[00:39:19] Parker Conrad: you know, I'm like, okay, here's your team.
[00:39:21] Parker Conrad: How many of these people right now?
[00:39:23] Parker Conrad: Like tell me which of these people
[00:39:25] Parker Conrad: you would bet your career on.
[00:39:28] Unknown Host: And like, whoa.
[00:39:30] And it's like, well, this person and this person.
[00:39:34] And I'm like, none of the rest.
[00:39:35] Parker Conrad: You're like, well, that's the tough idea.
[00:39:37] Parker Conrad: I, you know, and I'm like, okay, get, you know, like,
[00:39:40] Parker Conrad: fire all, like, let's start over, you know, and like,
[00:39:42] Parker Conrad: well, you know, like, you know, but, you know,
[00:39:44] Parker Conrad: there's all kinds of reasons why, you know,
[00:39:46] Parker Conrad: kid, you know, not yet.
[00:39:47] Parker Conrad: And inevitably, they're all gone in here.
[00:39:49] Unknown Host: They're all gone, but it takes a long time to get there.
[00:39:53] Parker Conrad: And it's so frustrating, it's so infuriating.
[00:39:55] Parker Conrad: And it's like, why, why can't you as a manager
[00:39:59] Parker Conrad: just do the job that we expect of you and make the hard decisions?
[00:40:02] Parker Conrad: And I make all the same mistakes myself.
[00:40:04] Parker Conrad: Right. You know, it's like, you know, equally difficult for me
[00:40:08] Parker Conrad: when things are not working out.
[00:40:10] Parker Conrad: It sounds to me from people that's spoken with inside of
[00:40:14] Unknown Host: Ripley and yourself that it was an intense startup.
[00:40:20] Unknown Host: An alt startups are pretty intense.
[00:40:22] Unknown Host: But it's now an intense scale up.
[00:40:24] Unknown Host: You've kept that pace and intensity up as you scale through the
[00:40:29] Unknown Host: years. Most of the founders I work with are really struggling
[00:40:32] Unknown Host: around 150 employees to bring in new people.
[00:40:36] Unknown Host: They didn't know well.
[00:40:37] Unknown Host: They're a couple of middle managers showing up that intensity
[00:40:41] Unknown Host: and that pace doesn't seem to scale.
[00:40:43] Unknown Host: How have you scaled that?
[00:40:44] Unknown Host: Well, I think one, one thing that I believe very firmly is that
[00:40:49] Parker Conrad: there's ultimately only one person in the organization.
[00:40:53] Parker Conrad: There's only one constituency for speed and it's you as the CEO.
[00:40:59] Parker Conrad: And so it's really one of your biggest jobs is to sort of set the
[00:41:03] Parker Conrad: clock speed of the organization.
[00:41:05] Parker Conrad: And the reason is that everyone else in the organization can sort
[00:41:09] Parker Conrad: of solve for all of their problems by just extending the timelines.
[00:41:14] Parker Conrad: You know, like they can get it done to, you know, the ways that
[00:41:19] Parker Conrad: they want to get it done.
[00:41:20] Parker Conrad: They can, you know, they don't have to, you know, sort of make
[00:41:23] Parker Conrad: unreasonable asks of people that they're, you know, like every,
[00:41:26] Parker Conrad: every other constraint can be solved for with more time.
[00:41:31] Parker Conrad: What happens is things start to get like really slow and there are
[00:41:35] Parker Conrad: real problems with that for the organization long term, but
[00:41:38] Parker Conrad: usually not for like any individual manager or executive with
[00:41:43] Parker Conrad: in the company.
[00:41:45] Parker Conrad: And so you're the only natural constituency for moving quickly.
[00:41:48] Parker Conrad: And so you really have to be, you really have to care about it.
[00:41:53] Parker Conrad: And you have to sort of pay attention when, when people are trying to
[00:41:59] Parker Conrad: slow it down.
[00:42:00] Parker Conrad: And so one of, one of the things that happens is like your team will
[00:42:04] Parker Conrad: often come to you and they will present you with what I call CEO
[00:42:08] Parker Conrad: on a box decisions where they will say, look, we can do A or we can do
[00:42:12] Parker Conrad: B like you choose and it's this illusion of the choice.
[00:42:15] Parker Conrad: Here in the of or.
[00:42:16] Unknown Host: Yeah, it's this a little bit it's an illusion of choice because the
[00:42:19] Parker Conrad: choice has already been made for you because the important choice
[00:42:23] Parker Conrad: was the decision that A and B cannot coexist.
[00:42:28] Parker Conrad: And usually like my immediate reaction when someone brings me
[00:42:32] Parker Conrad: something like that is to just on principle insist that we have
[00:42:36] Parker Conrad: both a and me and like understand like what laws of physics
[00:42:41] Parker Conrad: are violated that prevent A and B from coax it is like the second
[00:42:46] Parker Conrad: law of thermodynamics problem.
[00:42:48] Parker Conrad: Sometimes it's like it's much harder for the team to do A and B and
[00:42:51] Parker Conrad: they would prefer not to do that.
[00:42:53] Parker Conrad: Sometimes it's actually just as simple as asking people for a third
[00:42:58] Parker Conrad: path, you know, to like say, I don't, I don't like these options.
[00:43:01] Parker Conrad: Like can we just think a little bit harder?
[00:43:04] Parker Conrad: And is there some way to kind of get there when you think about
[00:43:07] Parker Conrad: like the pace at which organizations move?
[00:43:12] Parker Conrad: I think the natural thing is people sort of believe man, if you're
[00:43:16] Parker Conrad: like tyrannical CEO that's like driving people really hard.
[00:43:21] Parker Conrad: And like, you know, what's going to happen?
[00:43:23] Parker Conrad: It most maybe it's like 20% more.
[00:43:25] Parker Conrad: Patrick Collison has this great site that he put together on sort
[00:43:29] Parker Conrad: of like things that moved absurdly quickly and things that moved
[00:43:33] Parker Conrad: very slowly.
[00:43:34] Parker Conrad: And it's this example of like we the space program to land some on
[00:43:37] Parker Conrad: the moon was like four years and the Van Ness bust lane was like two
[00:43:41] Parker Conrad: decades or something.
[00:43:42] Parker Conrad: That's San Francisco.
[00:43:43] Parker Conrad: And you sort of look at these two different organizations that
[00:43:46] Parker Conrad: might both have good, well-meaning people.
[00:43:51] Parker Conrad: And like, you know, the organization that moves quickly, it's like, it's
[00:43:54] Parker Conrad: like orders of it's like an order of magnitude faster.
[00:43:56] Parker Conrad: It's not like 20% faster.
[00:43:58] Parker Conrad: It's just amazing what what you can accomplish.
[00:44:00] Parker Conrad: And so maybe the, the sort of slightly more positive way of
[00:44:04] Parker Conrad: articulating this is I think that that people are often capable of so
[00:44:09] Parker Conrad: much more than they believe themselves to be capable of.
[00:44:13] Parker Conrad: And so if you can sort of challenge them about the perceived
[00:44:17] Parker Conrad: constraints on the problem and explain to them the impact of being
[00:44:21] Parker Conrad: able to do A and B and why like what happens if we could do A and D.
[00:44:26] Parker Conrad: Yeah, startups are somewhere between completely impossible and
[00:44:31] Parker Conrad: very, very, very, very hard.
[00:44:32] Parker Conrad: And there's such a narrow ray of light that passes between those two.
[00:44:36] Parker Conrad: The companies that make it through usually at multiple points in the
[00:44:40] Parker Conrad: journey find ways to do things that are seemingly impossible.
[00:44:46] Parker Conrad: And it is, you have to sort of acknowledge that what you're asking for is
[00:44:49] Parker Conrad: like really hard and you understand that.
[00:44:52] Parker Conrad: And it's just there's no other way, you know, and so let's sit down together
[00:44:56] Parker Conrad: and think about whether it's possible.
[00:44:58] Parker Conrad: And sometimes people find clever solutions or new, new reserves of
[00:45:05] Parker Conrad: possibility to kind of get there.
[00:45:07] Parker Conrad: And if you kind of do that enough, it compounds.
[00:45:11] And like you can accomplish a lot more than the company that isn't doing that.
[00:45:17] Parker Conrad: I had a line where somebody would bring me something like that.
[00:45:20] Unknown Host: No, it's say when Moses came down from the mountain and he had the tablet
[00:45:27] Unknown Host: was there an 11th commandment that we all miss that we couldn't do this thing.
[00:45:32] Unknown Host: We're talking about right now.
[00:45:34] Unknown Host: Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:35] Unknown Host: Yeah. Yeah.
[00:45:36] Parker Conrad: Well, it's not, it's not a lot of physics.
[00:45:39] Unknown Host: We can figure it out.
[00:45:40] Unknown Host: Okay.
[00:45:41] Unknown Host: I hear you've got something like 40 or 50 ex founders on your
[00:45:47] Unknown Host: management teams in your company.
[00:45:49] Unknown Host: What's going on with that?
[00:45:50] Unknown Host: Why are you doing it?
[00:45:51] Unknown Host: How do you manage that cast?
[00:45:53] Unknown Host: I think it's actually a lot more than that now.
[00:45:54] Parker Conrad: Okay.
[00:45:56] Unknown Host: But why?
[00:45:59] Parker Conrad: I think that are you aquahiring or hiring like what's the, what's the, sometimes we
[00:46:05] Parker Conrad: aquahire, sometimes we hire.
[00:46:08] Parker Conrad: It's a profile that we look for.
[00:46:11] Parker Conrad: You know, Ripley, you know, we sort of coined this phrase.
[00:46:15] Parker Conrad: I know HubSpot HubSpot's been doing this for a long time, but we coined this phrase
[00:46:19] Parker Conrad: of like compound software.
[00:46:20] Parker Conrad: You know, I'm really mad at you about this.
[00:46:21] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:46:22] Unknown Host: Because we are a compound star, but we never came up with a clever name.
[00:46:27] Unknown Host: Like you, it had totally stuck.
[00:46:29] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:46:30] Unknown Host: And everyone's like, yeah, Parker's the original like we're the original
[00:46:33] Unknown Host: compound.
[00:46:34] Unknown Host: So spot was doing it long before us.
[00:46:36] Unknown Host: Well done.
[00:46:37] Unknown Host: But we, um, the reason that we, we do this is because I'm convinced that this is
[00:46:43] Parker Conrad: the right way to build software.
[00:46:44] Parker Conrad: And that actually we've been building software wrong.
[00:46:47] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:46:47] Parker Conrad: For a couple of decades now.
[00:46:49] Parker Conrad: Um, and most people believe, yeah, yeah, you're doing compound
[00:46:52] Parker Conrad: software. There's some like sales and marketing advantages to building, you
[00:46:56] Parker Conrad: know, good enough, but integrated products.
[00:46:59] Parker Conrad: And like that's not it at all.
[00:47:01] Parker Conrad: Like I think the belief is that actually you can build better products by
[00:47:06] Parker Conrad: building them in this integrated way.
[00:47:08] Parker Conrad: And you can do it because the fact that these things are deeply integrated
[00:47:12] Parker Conrad: and seamlessly interoperable on its own makes them better.
[00:47:16] Parker Conrad: But also when you're building across like multiple applications, you can
[00:47:20] Parker Conrad: afford to invest much more deeply in a set of capabilities that are common to
[00:47:25] Parker Conrad: all of the applications, you know, things like analytics and permissions and
[00:47:29] Parker Conrad: workflows and custom objects and stuff like that.
[00:47:31] Parker Conrad: But I think a lot of, you know, and this was sort of the original like before
[00:47:35] Parker Conrad: we were this articulate about what we were doing and why it was one of the
[00:47:39] Parker Conrad: original founding principles of Ripley and was that we were going to do more
[00:47:44] Parker Conrad: things, not less.
[00:47:44] Parker Conrad: So yeah, this focused thing was bullshit and like, you know, that was like what
[00:47:48] Parker Conrad: David wanted us to do with us completely wrong and we should do it this way.
[00:47:52] Parker Conrad: And so a lot of same with HubSpot, we're like this whole focus thing.
[00:47:56] Unknown Host: Like you should do one thing really well.
[00:47:57] Unknown Host: We're like, no, we're going to be very thin.
[00:48:00] Unknown Host: And but we're going to get to table stakes at some point.
[00:48:02] Unknown Host: It was exact same thesis we had.
[00:48:04] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:48:04] Unknown Host: So yeah.
[00:48:05] Parker Conrad: But a lot of the history of the company is trying to figure out novel
[00:48:10] Parker Conrad: solutions for the very real challenges with that approach.
[00:48:14] Parker Conrad: Yes.
[00:48:14] Parker Conrad: There are a lot of reasons why it is easier to focus on one thing along the way.
[00:48:20] Parker Conrad: A lot of problems come up and they're bottlenecks that develop in different
[00:48:23] Parker Conrad: parts of the organization.
[00:48:25] Parker Conrad: And one of the places that, you know, a bottleneck forms is really at the
[00:48:31] Parker Conrad: level of sort of executive attention around these things.
[00:48:35] Parker Conrad: And so you end up, you end up needing people who can be like the CEO of these
[00:48:41] Parker Conrad: products or who can drive things forward, who can find a path.
[00:48:45] Parker Conrad: Because a lot of people who are like very good managers and executives in
[00:48:51] Parker Conrad: engineering or product or whatever, what they do is they come to you with
[00:48:57] Parker Conrad: problems.
[00:48:58] Parker Conrad: And so they say, there's a series of gaps we have like in order to win.
[00:49:02] Parker Conrad: Here's like a long list of things we need to do.
[00:49:04] Parker Conrad: And they unroll the list and it rolls out on the floor and goes all the way
[00:49:08] Parker Conrad: down the hallway.
[00:49:09] Parker Conrad: And like we've prioritized it by sort of most important on down.
[00:49:17] Parker Conrad: And I have a team of the size and this is about one quarter's worth of work is
[00:49:22] Parker Conrad: like, you know, these things this far down the list.
[00:49:25] Parker Conrad: And so we're going to do one quarter's worth of work and we're going to solve
[00:49:28] Parker Conrad: these things.
[00:49:30] Parker Conrad: And and that's what it is.
[00:49:32] Parker Conrad: And the problem is is like, yeah, but the list goes all the way down the hallway.
[00:49:36] Parker Conrad: And they're like, well, but my job is to sort of, you know, that's your problem,
[00:49:40] Parker Conrad: right?
[00:49:40] Parker Conrad: Yeah, you're like, and so they're asking you to find a way to make ends meet
[00:49:45] Parker Conrad: because, you know, they're like, their job is just to kind of move down the list.
[00:49:50] Parker Conrad: And and then you're, you're still fucked because like at the end of the day,
[00:49:53] Parker Conrad: they're going to do those things, but you're still not, you still haven't solved
[00:49:57] Parker Conrad: the problem.
[00:49:57] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:49:58] Parker Conrad: Just like you need to win.
[00:49:59] Parker Conrad: And so you need people who can find ways to do the impossible that sort of
[00:50:04] Parker Conrad: understand, look, like the CEO that's asking you to do unreasonable things,
[00:50:11] Parker Conrad: like I didn't create the situation, like the market created that, like,
[00:50:16] Parker Conrad: this is the reality that we find ourselves in, which is like, we need to do these
[00:50:20] Parker Conrad: things.
[00:50:22] Parker Conrad: And if we don't, we're dead.
[00:50:24] Parker Conrad: We're screwed.
[00:50:25] Parker Conrad: And so we need to find some way or some alternate path or some sort of, you know,
[00:50:29] Parker Conrad: there needs to be some effort to solve the whole problem or like it doesn't
[00:50:34] Parker Conrad: matter, you know, then you think X founders are particularly good.
[00:50:39] Unknown Host: I think the founders understand breaking the laws of physics.
[00:50:42] Unknown Host: Or they just, they've been in situations where they've, they understand that,
[00:50:48] Parker Conrad: like, yeah, like it's like, we either, you know, they, they've sat there and
[00:50:52] Parker Conrad: stared at the dwindling bank balance while, you know, while the sales isn't working
[00:50:58] Parker Conrad: and they're like, oh shit.
[00:50:59] Parker Conrad: And like, and they understand that like, yes, it's absolutely true that like,
[00:51:03] Parker Conrad: you know, this is a reasonable set of expectations for the team.
[00:51:07] Parker Conrad: This week, this month, this quarter, this year, and yet if we do the reasonable
[00:51:12] Parker Conrad: set of things, we're dead.
[00:51:14] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:51:15] Unknown Host: And so like we can either give up or we can try and find a way to accomplish an
[00:51:21] Parker Conrad: unreasonable set of things.
[00:51:23] Unknown Host: How do you manage them though?
[00:51:24] Unknown Host: Founders are typically a little unruly, want a crap ton of autonomy.
[00:51:29] Unknown Host: Often don't play with that well with others.
[00:51:31] Unknown Host: Like, how do you manage the chaos?
[00:51:34] Unknown Host: I don't know if I found that to be the case.
[00:51:37] Parker Conrad: Like, you know, if you're, if you've started a company, I mean,
[00:51:40] Parker Conrad: look, there's all kinds of people, but like, you know, man, like you've got to
[00:51:44] Parker Conrad: convince a bunch of people to work for you, you know, that, you know,
[00:51:47] when it doesn't make any sense, you know, and like, there's a certain amount
[00:51:52] Parker Conrad: of charisma or interpersonal skills that you've had to like develop.
[00:51:58] Parker Conrad: Like even if you didn't have it, I think that most people are more well
[00:52:03] Parker Conrad: socialized than that.
[00:52:04] Parker Conrad: But they're always, I guess, exceptions.
[00:52:06] Parker Conrad: And we do people a lot of autonomy because like the best thing in the world
[00:52:10] Parker Conrad: for me is someone who can run with something, you know, and, and sort of take
[00:52:14] Parker Conrad: it off my plate.
[00:52:16] Parker Conrad: Like that's, that's ideal.
[00:52:18] Parker Conrad: So everyone, everyone's aligned on their being that kind of autonomy.
[00:52:22] Parker Conrad: Just switching gears briefly, um, deal.
[00:52:29] Unknown Host: Your main competitor, been a lot of drama around it.
[00:52:34] Do you want to talk about it?
[00:52:35] Sure.
[00:52:36] Parker Conrad: We weirdly, I would say deal is a competitor, but probably not the main one.
[00:52:42] Parker Conrad: You know, the, the companies, you got a lot of them.
[00:52:44] Parker Conrad: Yeah, there's a lot of, you know, if I was like, it was our main competitor.
[00:52:47] Parker Conrad: Right.
[00:52:48] Parker Conrad: I would be like, man, you know, in payroll, it's probably,
[00:52:52] pay, comp, pay, velocity, ADP, you know, work day for H.C.M.
[00:52:58] Parker Conrad: Maybe, you know, gusto down market.
[00:53:00] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:53:00] Parker Conrad: You know, we, we come up against deal in specifically this sort of global part
[00:53:06] Parker Conrad: of the business where you're, I need to hire someone in X, Y, Z country.
[00:53:11] Parker Conrad: And I have like one or two people that I'm hiring there.
[00:53:13] Parker Conrad: And I don't know anything about it and need some help.
[00:53:15] Parker Conrad: And like that's where we compete with them.
[00:53:17] Parker Conrad: But, but we have, you know, much, much stronger competition with these other companies.
[00:53:25] Parker Conrad: It is just the weird stuff happened with, with them.
[00:53:30] Parker Conrad: Tell me about it.
[00:53:31] Unknown Host: So when was the first inkling you had that there was a spy that someone was spying
[00:53:39] Unknown Host: on, someone from deal with spying on your company?
[00:53:42] Unknown Host: The weird thing about spy is like, spy makes it sound.
[00:53:45] Parker Conrad: It's great.
[00:53:46] Parker Conrad: It's a podcast sort of sexy and thought that's the idea part.
[00:53:49] Parker Conrad: Which for podcast crap.
[00:53:50] Parker Conrad: And I think it's really like, it's not that deal was spying
[00:53:53] Parker Conrad: is that they were stealing.
[00:53:54] Parker Conrad: And it was, it was just theft pure and worse from the CEO of the company.
[00:54:00] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:54:00] Parker Conrad: It's worse.
[00:54:00] Parker Conrad: And the, the thing that happened is we got a reporter who was writing a story,
[00:54:05] Parker Conrad: sent us a bunch of rippling internal Slack messages that, you know,
[00:54:10] Parker Conrad: many of which were sort of cropped in sort of like unflattering ways
[00:54:14] Parker Conrad: and taking out of context and was like asking for our comment on it.
[00:54:17] Parker Conrad: And just, you know, because of the context, it was, it was very clear for a bunch
[00:54:22] Parker Conrad: of reasons when you thought about it that the only place that this could have come
[00:54:25] Parker Conrad: from, like it had to have been deal.
[00:54:27] Parker Conrad: Like no one else would have sort of known to send this stuff to that reporter.
[00:54:31] Parker Conrad: And so the implication was the deal had, you know, full access to our Slack.
[00:54:38] Parker Conrad: And then from there, you know, we, so we sort of knew what was going on immediately.
[00:54:42] Parker Conrad: But even before that did you have an inkling
[00:54:44] Unknown Host: like in some territory that they were winning an unusual number of deals
[00:54:48] Unknown Host: and like, how are they doing it?
[00:54:49] Unknown Host: Was there an inkling before that?
[00:54:52] They're really, you know, once you started looking, you know, there were these examples.
[00:54:57] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:54:57] Parker Conrad: There were, like when this story came out, you know, there were customers that
[00:55:01] Parker Conrad: wrote into us and ex former customers, you know, that, that wrote into us.
[00:55:05] Parker Conrad: And there was, there was a guy that was a former deal customer that took a demo
[00:55:10] Parker Conrad: with Ripley and was talking with us, came to us because he wanted to switch.
[00:55:15] Parker Conrad: And he spoke with a Ripley to count executive.
[00:55:18] Parker Conrad: And within hours, he got a WhatsApp message from Alex Boosys, this CEO of
[00:55:24] Parker Conrad: Diel, you know, who he never ever for sure.
[00:55:27] Parker Conrad: There was like, Hey, I hear you're like, you know, looking at other stuff.
[00:55:29] Parker Conrad: Like, you know, let's try and find a way to get you to, you know, like, seems like
[00:55:32] Parker Conrad: an awful big coincidence.
[00:55:33] Parker Conrad: He was, and he emailed at the time.
[00:55:35] Parker Conrad: And this was before we knew anything was going on.
[00:55:38] Parker Conrad: He emailed his rep.
[00:55:39] Parker Conrad: He was like, whoa, this is super weird.
[00:55:41] Parker Conrad: Like this freaked the hell out of me.
[00:55:43] Parker Conrad: Like I, you know, how did, how did Diel know that like, you know, and of course
[00:55:47] Parker Conrad: the rep thought nothing of it.
[00:55:48] Parker Conrad: So I didn't go anywhere, right?
[00:55:50] Parker Conrad: Until later you look back and you're like, Oh, yeah, you can actually trace
[00:55:54] Parker Conrad: the person that was a Ripley employee that deal started paying to send them
[00:55:59] Parker Conrad: all of this internal steel Ripley internal data, including mostly like CRM
[00:56:06] Parker Conrad: data, just like every opportunity we were working, every customer we were talking
[00:56:11] Parker Conrad: to, it's a pricing we were offering now on the objections they had.
[00:56:16] Parker Conrad: You know, it's just every single day just sending all of it directly to out of
[00:56:22] Parker Conrad: disease.
[00:56:22] Parker Conrad: Do you think Alex and crew targeted someone or took an employee and got them to
[00:56:29] Unknown Host: work for you?
[00:56:30] Unknown Host: Or there was somebody working for you that they got to.
[00:56:33] Unknown Host: They have a lot of, they've gathered somebody.
[00:56:35] Unknown Host: And you know, the thing is that hasn't been talked about a lot is it really seems like
[00:56:41] Parker Conrad: it was, you know, wasn't, wasn't just us.
[00:56:44] Parker Conrad: There are a bunch of other companies.
[00:56:46] Parker Conrad: So, you know, there was, they were doing it too, or in the industry writ large is a
[00:56:50] Unknown Host: lot of this going.
[00:56:51] Unknown Host: No, no, that deal was doing this.
[00:56:53] Parker Conrad: I say, you know, like we were not the only ones.
[00:56:56] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:56:57] Parker Conrad: And, and that it was a defined play.
[00:57:00] Yeah, this was, I think I believe that this, that company was built on this
[00:57:05] Parker Conrad: foundation of theft from competitors and that that was like a critical component of what
[00:57:13] Parker Conrad: they're doing.
[00:57:13] Parker Conrad: And so, you know, one of the things that we decided to do is we decided to be extremely
[00:57:19] Parker Conrad: public about this and come forward.
[00:57:21] Parker Conrad: But even before that, so you get this thing from your press guy, like they have to have
[00:57:27] Unknown Host: access to our slack.
[00:57:29] Yeah.
[00:57:29] And then you ran a honey pot operation to kind of prove what you thought.
[00:57:34] Unknown Host: You just talk about that meeting and what was going on.
[00:57:38] Unknown Host: Can you just give us a glimpse behind the scenes of what happened in that meeting?
[00:57:43] Unknown Host: Well, so actually first before that, what happened is we needed to figure out like who
[00:57:49] Parker Conrad: was doing this.
[00:57:49] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:57:50] Parker Conrad: And I, my assumption was that this was probably a former employee that left, you know,
[00:57:59] Parker Conrad: because sometimes people leave one company, they go to another.
[00:58:02] Parker Conrad: And sometimes people like you shouldn't do this.
[00:58:04] Parker Conrad: It's wrong.
[00:58:04] Parker Conrad: It's legal.
[00:58:05] Parker Conrad: But sometimes it happens that people take some stuff on the way out.
[00:58:08] Parker Conrad: Yep.
[00:58:09] Parker Conrad: And so I was like, maybe there's someone who kind of like, you know, did, did their new
[00:58:14] Parker Conrad: employer a favor on the way and sort of unethically.
[00:58:18] Parker Conrad: Instead of, you know, what, what we would do in a situation like that is we would say,
[00:58:21] Parker Conrad: whoa, whoa, whoa, like don't, you know, delete that.
[00:58:24] Parker Conrad: We don't want it.
[00:58:25] Parker Conrad: You know, and unethically they said, goodie, you know, like great.
[00:58:29] Parker Conrad: And then what we did is, you know, the, the, the sort of light signature.
[00:58:34] Parker Conrad: Of, of the behavior that really popped up was the search history in Slack.
[00:58:38] Parker Conrad: Like what, you know, there were certain searches that this person had to have been
[00:58:42] Parker Conrad: doing.
[00:58:42] Parker Conrad: So did you invite your IT guy in like how?
[00:58:45] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:58:45] Unknown Host: How did it do?
[00:58:46] Parker Conrad: Well, so this is the crazy thing is the search logs in Slack are not visible to
[00:58:53] Parker Conrad: slack clients.
[00:58:54] Parker Conrad: Oh, he pinged Salesforce.
[00:58:55] Unknown Host: And so, and in fact, like cynically, I think they were doing it in this way
[00:59:00] Parker Conrad: precisely to avoid detection as they were doing searches.
[00:59:03] Parker Conrad: And then getting things from not joining the channels, but getting things from the
[00:59:06] Parker Conrad: preview from the search, from the actual searches.
[00:59:09] Parker Conrad: And so really the only way we were able to do this is we got introduced to some
[00:59:14] Parker Conrad: like very senior people at Salesforce who like to their credit, you know,
[00:59:19] Parker Conrad: sort of agreed to help us track this down.
[00:59:21] Parker Conrad: And they, they pulled from their own internal logs.
[00:59:25] Parker Conrad: What the search history was.
[00:59:27] Parker Conrad: And it was very clear exactly who the person was.
[00:59:29] Parker Conrad: And that person was still an active, rippling employee.
[00:59:32] Parker Conrad: Who is the one who came up with the idea to look at that particular thing?
[00:59:36] Unknown Host: To look at the searches.
[00:59:37] Parker Conrad: Yes.
[00:59:39] I can't even remember, but it was so obvious.
[00:59:41] Unknown Host: It was like you call the meeting of a bunch of smart people and like, how are we
[00:59:43] Unknown Host: going to catch him?
[00:59:44] Unknown Host: It was like, I mean, it was a very small team.
[00:59:46] Parker Conrad: It was like, you know, it was like, you know, me, my general council, like, you
[00:59:51] Parker Conrad: know, the deputy GC, you know, it was like a couple.
[00:59:54] Parker Conrad: It was like two or three people on legal, two or three people in security.
[00:59:58] And it was like, hey, we're going to catch him.
[01:00:00] Parker Conrad: You know, to get this, the slacks that we saw, they must have done these searches to get,
[01:00:06] Parker Conrad: you know, so we, and these are weird searches, like someone.
[01:00:10] Parker Conrad: And so we've got to be able to find this.
[01:00:11] Parker Conrad: And so then we, we, we clearly, there's one person that was like doing this.
[01:00:15] Parker Conrad: And it was very clear who it was.
[01:00:17] Parker Conrad: The big kind of insight was like, well, look, it's actually, because we were thinking,
[01:00:21] Parker Conrad: like, is there something that we could do where we could put something in Slack?
[01:00:26] Parker Conrad: You know, like, maybe like put like a fake customer in Salesforce with a phone number
[01:00:31] Parker Conrad: that like goes to our law firm, put that in Slack and like see if a deal of sales rep calls that phone
[01:00:37] Parker Conrad: number, you know, and like kind of train you like that way.
[01:00:39] Parker Conrad: It was just, it was too hard to sort of know, like, cause we, it was too hard to see what
[01:00:45] Parker Conrad: deal would be doing with it.
[01:00:47] Parker Conrad: And so the insight was realizing that you could flip it around.
[01:00:51] Parker Conrad: And you could actually, the thing that we could see was the searches.
[01:00:55] Parker Conrad: And so we could see what this guy was searching for.
[01:00:58] Parker Conrad: And so we had to do it the other way.
[01:01:00] Parker Conrad: We had to give some information to deal and see this guy searched for it.
[01:01:06] Parker Conrad: How did you get the information to deal?
[01:01:08] So, you know, look, a lot of companies that are in competing spaces have some,
[01:01:14] Parker Conrad: some what regular exchange of like legal letters where, you know, for whatever reason,
[01:01:20] Parker Conrad: you know, they send you a letter and they're like, we're angry that this person joined
[01:01:25] Parker Conrad: and make sure that they're, you know, or that's person recruited.
[01:01:28] Parker Conrad: Some of the words, yes, they're recruiting.
[01:01:29] Parker Conrad: And, you know, and so this is a sort of fairly form.
[01:01:31] Parker Conrad: There's a sort of low level of that that was kind of happening.
[01:01:34] Parker Conrad: And so there happened to have been a letter that they had sent us about something
[01:01:38] Parker Conrad: or other related to a deal employee that had joined Ripley.
[01:01:42] Parker Conrad: That we had, you know, sort of, I think at the time, I had decided we're not even
[01:01:45] Parker Conrad: going to bother responding to this.
[01:01:47] Parker Conrad: But we suddenly said, well, let's respond to it.
[01:01:50] And when we responded to it and we said, okay, we decided to put together
[01:01:55] like a screenshot of a Slack message that was like basically like a fake Slack message,
[01:02:02] Parker Conrad: although to make sure that it wasn't actually fake, we actually had someone send that Slack message.
[01:02:08] Parker Conrad: So we could, we could be like, no, it was a real Slack message.
[01:02:10] Parker Conrad: But, but we put this thing together and the Slack message, what's actually the funniest part
[01:02:16] Parker Conrad: of this is that initially this was designed by the legal team.
[01:02:20] Parker Conrad: And man, the Slack message was so boring.
[01:02:22] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[01:02:23] Parker Conrad: It was like no one would have cared.
[01:02:25] Parker Conrad: It was so uninteresting.
[01:02:26] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[01:02:27] Parker Conrad: And so and this was a very, you know, closed circle.
[01:02:30] Parker Conrad: Like you weren't allowed to tell anyone about what was going on.
[01:02:33] Parker Conrad: And so I called up our former CMO who was like that he had moved into a new role at Ripley.
[01:02:42] Parker Conrad: But he was like one of the things about him that's so amazing is he's like just great
[01:02:46] Parker Conrad: at writing, coming up with like cold email messages.
[01:02:50] Parker Conrad: So he was always a guy who went to when we needed like a new cold email to send people
[01:02:55] Parker Conrad: that was good.
[01:02:56] Parker Conrad: And so I called up Mepstein and I said Mepstein, we need you to write a cold email
[01:03:01] Parker Conrad: that's going to have a 100% S1 to S2 conversion, right?
[01:03:05] Parker Conrad: That like definitely someone's going to have to click on this.
[01:03:09] Parker Conrad: And he came up with the actual thing.
[01:03:11] Parker Conrad: It was this message that sort of suggested that there was this channel in Ripley and Slack
[01:03:17] Parker Conrad: called Deedefectors where ex-deal employees were talking about deal maybe in ways that were
[01:03:22] Parker Conrad: unflattering.
[01:03:24] Parker Conrad: And there were, you know, we sent them the message and then just for added sort of theatrical
[01:03:27] Parker Conrad: effect, we like blacked out like parts of it.
[01:03:31] Parker Conrad: You know, it was really like what are the blacked out parts of it?
[01:03:35] Parker Conrad: And it was included in this letter that we sent to their CFO who is, you know, the CEO's father
[01:03:44] Parker Conrad: and their outside counsel and their head of legal, the part that was the sort of person's style.
[01:03:51] Parker Conrad: So there was only three people.
[01:03:52] Parker Conrad: One of them, you know, presumably it's not the outside counsel.
[01:03:55] Parker Conrad: And then the other two are quite senior within the company.
[01:03:58] Parker Conrad: And we sent them this letter.
[01:04:00] Parker Conrad: You know, it like, I think it was like 8 p.m.
[01:04:03] Parker Conrad: And then we waited.
[01:04:04] Parker Conrad: And I remember waking up at like four in the morning and checking my Slack.
[01:04:10] Parker Conrad: And there was just all these messages.
[01:04:11] Parker Conrad: It was like, holy shit.
[01:04:13] Parker Conrad: They did it.
[01:04:14] Parker Conrad: And we were getting somebody was searching on that channel.
[01:04:17] Unknown Host: He was searching and going in, you know, this, they're going into this channel.
[01:04:21] Parker Conrad: And like, you know, it's a, we was purposefully a weird search term.
[01:04:24] Parker Conrad: And yes, never been searched before we checked, you know, it was not a real channel.
[01:04:28] Parker Conrad: You know, it's there's only one way that this could have happened.
[01:04:31] Parker Conrad: Okay. Now, you know, who it is, your month and a half searches over.
[01:04:35] Unknown Host: Then what happened?
[01:04:37] Well, then, you know, who approached them?
[01:04:39] Unknown Host: So this, the employee was, was based in Ireland.
[01:04:42] Parker Conrad: Yes.
[01:04:43] Parker Conrad: And Ireland has, um, the Irish legal system has an extraordinary form of relief
[01:04:50] Parker Conrad: in civil litigation that allows you to file an X part A process.
[01:04:55] Parker Conrad: So basically you can, you don't have to alert the other side.
[01:04:58] Parker Conrad: You can go to court and get without the other side being aware of it.
[01:05:02] Parker Conrad: An order from the court that's effectively sort of like a warrant.
[01:05:06] Parker Conrad: You know, in the US legal system, that exists in like a criminal case,
[01:05:10] Parker Conrad: but not in civil litigation.
[01:05:12] Parker Conrad: Um, and so we, we were able to get this because of the sort of strength of the evidence
[01:05:18] Parker Conrad: that sort of there was a court order to get access to this guy's phone.
[01:05:21] Parker Conrad: And, and so there was a court officer that came to police officer ish person.
[01:05:28] Unknown Host: I don't know the police officer but court officer was like a solicitor is the uniform.
[01:05:34] Parker Conrad: I actually don't know, but, but in, in the Irish legal system,
[01:05:37] Parker Conrad: there are solicitors and barristers and, you know, and so you may be more like a lawyer.
[01:05:42] Parker Conrad: Wait, wearing a white wig or, man, I don't even know.
[01:05:46] Parker Conrad: Now I'm gonna let that up.
[01:05:48] Parker Conrad: But anyway, you know, they showed up at the office.
[01:05:50] Parker Conrad: Met this guy was taking, you know, sort of, you know, the,
[01:05:53] Parker Conrad: went into a room for a meeting and there was this team arrayed with, you know,
[01:05:58] Parker Conrad: sort of forensic IT people, the sort of officer of the court said,
[01:06:01] Parker Conrad: look, I've got this order for your phone.
[01:06:03] Parker Conrad: And he sort of said, I don't have my phone with me.
[01:06:07] Parker Conrad: I need to go get it.
[01:06:09] Parker Conrad: That turned out not to be true.
[01:06:11] Parker Conrad: And then he sort of, while he was like going to get it, kind of ran into a bathroom
[01:06:15] Parker Conrad: and locked himself in the bathroom.
[01:06:18] In what we later learned is that in the bathroom, he did a factory reset on his phone,
[01:06:21] Parker Conrad: tried to flush it down the toilet.
[01:06:23] Parker Conrad: And then came out of the, the bathroom and, you know, the, the court officer was telling
[01:06:28] Parker Conrad: me, like you're violating the court order.
[01:06:30] Parker Conrad: There's, you know, there's something you can be a prison for.
[01:06:32] Parker Conrad: And he ran out of the building and took off.
[01:06:35] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[01:06:36] Parker Conrad: And then, you know, over the next sort of 10 to 12 days,
[01:06:41] Parker Conrad: there was this sort of bat sort of ongoing legal process to try and get,
[01:06:46] Parker Conrad: you know, sort of like real like police enforcement of this, to get this guy,
[01:06:51] Parker Conrad: to get a lawyer, to sort of, and, you know, get like contempt charges filed.
[01:06:56] Parker Conrad: Eventually, what happened is, is he, you know, sort of facing, you know,
[01:07:04] Parker Conrad: sort of these legal consequences, he eventually sort of, like, turned and sort of started
[01:07:10] Parker Conrad: cooperating up and said that he had destroyed his phone.
[01:07:13] Parker Conrad: But he also, he told us, and this is all, you know, in the sort of, the sort of court proceedings
[01:07:19] Parker Conrad: in the affidavit that he produced.
[01:07:20] Parker Conrad: According to these proceedings, you know, allegedly what happened is that he,
[01:07:26] Parker Conrad: immediately after he left our office, he got called Alex, the CEO of DL, told him what had
[01:07:33] Parker Conrad: happened. Alex said someone would reach out to him, you know, allegedly.
[01:07:37] Parker Conrad: And, and then two attorneys at DL, like, like employees of DL who were attorneys,
[01:07:45] Parker Conrad: called him back and they, they told him to destroy his phone, which is, like, if you're,
[01:07:51] Parker Conrad: that's a, that's a bad thing for anyone, but it's really bad for attorneys to be, to be saying that.
[01:07:58] Parker Conrad: Told him, destroy his phone, get a new burner phone, call them back, delete all of his accounts,
[01:08:05] Parker Conrad: and they offered to relocate him and his family to Dubai, and get him out of the country to buy his,
[01:08:13] no extradition.
[01:08:14] Unknown Host: No, like, not a lot of extradition options.
[01:08:17] Parker Conrad: So one of those lawyers, by the way, who was based in the UK, practice law in the UK,
[01:08:23] Parker Conrad: has since relocated to Dubai himself.
[01:08:25] Parker Conrad: Nice.
[01:08:26] Parker Conrad: This all came out.
[01:08:27] Parker Conrad: And so there was, and this, there was this crazy thing where he detailed, you know, like,
[01:08:31] Parker Conrad: the person who's doing this detailed, except everything that happened and how he was recruited by
[01:08:36] Parker Conrad: the CEO directly and sent all of this information to the CEO and was paid, how he was paid,
[01:08:42] Parker Conrad: and all, you know, sort of all of this stuff.
[01:08:45] Parker Conrad: Do you think this is going on a lot in tech?
[01:08:49] Unknown Host: I don't think it's going on a lot.
[01:08:51] Parker Conrad: And look, I think the reason that we really came forward with this is for the very public.
[01:08:58] Unknown Host: You know, obviously there's a reason for rippling that, you know, for the business, we defend
[01:09:01] Parker Conrad: the business, but, you know, more importantly, I do think that if deal,
[01:09:05] Parker Conrad: it sort of moves forward, like, in a way that's unscathed.
[01:09:11] Parker Conrad: There is this risk that the over-tun window shifts, and that this becomes,
[01:09:17] Parker Conrad: I know.
[01:09:18] Parker Conrad: A norm, you know, that it's sort of like, ah, you know, your competitor paid someone to steal
[01:09:24] Parker Conrad: your CRM data.
[01:09:25] Parker Conrad: If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
[01:09:27] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[01:09:28] Parker Conrad: You got to be doing the same thing.
[01:09:30] Parker Conrad: And everyone's, and everyone's got to have an espionage team and a counter-espionage team.
[01:09:35] Parker Conrad: And I just don't think that that's the way I want the world to work.
[01:09:41] Parker Conrad: And one of the things that's actually, there's a lot of crazy things about the story,
[01:09:44] Parker Conrad: but one of the things that's, I think, is the craziest to me is that, you know,
[01:09:49] Parker Conrad: a deal's largest investor,
[01:09:52] Parker Conrad: Andrew Sinorowitz has been very clear, but they've made it very clear that they,
[01:09:59] Parker Conrad: they do not care.
[01:10:01] Parker Conrad: Like, it does not, they are totally fine.
[01:10:05] Parker Conrad: With what happened here, and they're going to continue to back these guys, presumably because,
[01:10:12] Parker Conrad: you know, they have three billion reasons to do so.
[01:10:16] Parker Conrad: If you're making enough money, it doesn't matter how you got there, or what you did,
[01:10:23] Parker Conrad: or the rules that you broke, or the lines that you crossed, or the ethics that you transgressed,
[01:10:29] Parker Conrad: if it worked, and you got away with it.
[01:10:31] Parker Conrad: And so, you know, the board seems like they're not going to hold them accountable.
[01:10:37] And so we felt like we kind of had to do something. Appreciate that, by the way.
[01:10:44] Unknown Host: You've had a lot of drama.
[01:10:46] If a movie is made, which I think it should be,
[01:10:52] who would you like to play you, and who would you like to play Mark Andreessen?
[01:10:58] Oh, man, I will.
[01:10:59] Parker Conrad: Or Ben Horowitz.
[01:11:00] Parker Conrad: I love it. If there's a movie that gets made, hopefully the movie is about deal,
[01:11:03] Parker Conrad: and I am sort of a minor character.
[01:11:06] Parker Conrad: No, I think the better movie would be your arc, and all the interesting stuff that's happened around you.
[01:11:11] Unknown Host: Who plays Parker?
[01:11:14] Man, I don't know. That's a good question.
[01:11:16] Parker Conrad: Someone, someone, hopefully, someone extremely good looking.
[01:11:22] Parker Conrad: We can maybe have some slight departures from reality since it's a movie.
[01:11:27] Parker Conrad: And you mean playing Mark Andreessen and replicating that noggin of his going to be tricky?
[01:11:34] Unknown Host: Yeah, for sure.
[01:11:35] Unknown Host: John Luke Picard, like, can be tricky to do.
[01:11:38] Unknown Host: Oh, yeah, that's a great one. That's a good idea.
[01:11:40] Unknown Host: Okay, anything else you want to tell the audience? Any other advice you would give to founders
[01:11:46] Unknown Host: and people who want to go from four people to 40 to 400 to 4,000 and 40,000 someday?
[01:11:53] I think everyone needs to find their own path through this stuff.
[01:11:56] Parker Conrad: It's one of things that's hard.
[01:11:59] Parker Conrad: I don't really think that there are a lot of recipes.
[01:12:02] Parker Conrad: And recipes.
[01:12:04] Parker Conrad: It's why I probably have a lot more...
[01:12:10] Parker Conrad: There was a point in my life when I was very angry at investors.
[01:12:14] Parker Conrad: And I think I've reached some point where I actually have a lot of empathy for investors
[01:12:20] Parker Conrad: and how hard it is to be in their position and how impossible the job is.
[01:12:28] Parker Conrad: Because I think it's really hard, even if you have a lot of experience yourself,
[01:12:34] Parker Conrad: there are people all find their own paths.
[01:12:38] Parker Conrad: Things changed. Ripley was a business that was so close to what we were building at Santa
[01:12:45] Parker Conrad: Fits. It wasn't the same industry slightly tinkered with the principle,
[01:12:53] Parker Conrad: the foundational principles of what we were building.
[01:12:56] Parker Conrad: The world was four years into the future from when I had started Zenefits.
[01:13:04] Parker Conrad: That one thing changed everything.
[01:13:07] Parker Conrad: All of the things that...
[01:13:10] Parker Conrad: Or many of the things that had worked for us at Zenefits didn't work at Ripley.
[01:13:13] Parker Conrad: And just like everything was different because of a few changes to the starting assumptions.
[01:13:18] Parker Conrad: And it really made me realize why so much of the advice that people give out about how to do this
[01:13:26] Parker Conrad: is so useless. Because everyone is fighting yesterday's war from their own experience.
[01:13:35] Things are very different. Things have changed just because of the slow advance of time.
[01:13:39] Parker Conrad: If not because this is a completely different business and a completely different industry
[01:13:44] Parker Conrad: with a totally different set of people. So it's a real struggle.
[01:13:49] Parker Conrad: And it's probably one of the reasons why I'm like, man, it sucks if you have any other thing
[01:13:55] Parker Conrad: that you can go do. Maybe that's the right thing to do instead of getting involved in this whole thing.
[01:14:00] Parker Conrad: I appreciate you. Thank you on behalf of the listeners.
[01:14:03] Unknown Host: You're an inspiration to many. Congrats on all your success.
[01:14:06] Unknown Host: Congrats on your revenge chore.
[01:14:09] Well, thank you very much.
[01:14:10] Parker Conrad: Appreciate you.
[01:14:11] Okay. Hope you like that interview with Parker.
[01:14:13] Unknown Host: I really liked it. He's a smart guy.
[01:14:16] Unknown Host: On hiring, he's got a bunch of cool ideas, some of which I'm definitely going to borrow.
[01:14:21] Unknown Host: I like his idea that if he's got a candidate that's coming to meet him,
[01:14:25] Unknown Host: he sends them an old board deck or his investor memo.
[01:14:29] Unknown Host: Let's them read it.
[01:14:30] Unknown Host: And he spends like the first half of the interview just talking about that.
[01:14:34] Unknown Host: In the reaction of the candidate to that memo and the ideas they come up with,
[01:14:38] Unknown Host: really says a lot about them.
[01:14:39] Unknown Host: I love that he does that.
[01:14:41] Unknown Host: He relies a lot on on reference checks.
[01:14:44] Unknown Host: He does something interesting there.
[01:14:45] Unknown Host: He asked the candidate to give him six references, which is kind of a lot.
[01:14:51] Unknown Host: And he only calls two.
[01:14:52] Unknown Host: He's trying to figure out if they have six references or not.
[01:14:55] Unknown Host: But then he leans much more heavily on the blind references.
[01:14:58] Unknown Host: And this is something I did as well.
[01:15:00] Unknown Host: I would say 60% of my decision criteria was around the third party references
[01:15:06] Unknown Host: of people who used to work for them.
[01:15:07] Unknown Host: So I thought that was interesting.
[01:15:09] Unknown Host: This is something we didn't do in HubSpot.
[01:15:10] Unknown Host: But I really liked how he hires a lot of ex-founders.
[01:15:15] Unknown Host: And he talked about how ex-founders are used to
[01:15:19] Unknown Host: breaking the laws of physics.
[01:15:21] Unknown Host: They're used to just really tight constraints and having to really do hard things.
[01:15:25] Unknown Host: And so he has those sprinkled throughout his award.
[01:15:27] Unknown Host: And he's had a lot of success for them.
[01:15:29] Unknown Host: He likes his senior team to be a mix of homegrown talent and Ben there done that talent.
[01:15:35] Unknown Host: And this is pretty consistent across most of the CEOs I interviewed.
[01:15:40] Unknown Host: And I feel like it's a little bit of conventional wisdom and skill up land
[01:15:44] Unknown Host: that you just hire a bunch of Ben there done that people.
[01:15:47] I'm not sure that's right.
[01:15:48] Unknown Host: A lot of HubSpot's team over the years was 50% homegrown at 50% Ben there done that.
[01:15:53] Unknown Host: And that mix I think is just about right.
[01:15:56] Unknown Host: I took some things away from on pace.
[01:15:59] Unknown Host: He's at 4,000 people.
[01:16:01] Unknown Host: A lot of companies slow down when you hit 4,000 people.
[01:16:05] Unknown Host: He seems to be keeping the pace up.
[01:16:08] And he does a few things that I think are smart.
[01:16:10] Unknown Host: And a lot of the CEOs they interviewed do a couple of these things.
[01:16:14] Unknown Host: First, he really tries to stay on the coal face with the customer.
[01:16:18] Unknown Host: And he's one of the most active users of rippling the product.
[01:16:21] Unknown Host: He runs payroll for all 4,000 employees of rippling.
[01:16:24] Unknown Host: He's very close to the customer experience through that.
[01:16:26] Unknown Host: He stays on the coal face with the employees too.
[01:16:29] Unknown Host: He sits right inside the engineering organization where you can see what's going on.
[01:16:34] Unknown Host: Here what's going on.
[01:16:35] Unknown Host: And he talked about the CEO sets the pace.
[01:16:37] Unknown Host: CEO slows down the work slows down.
[01:16:39] Unknown Host: CEO speeds up the work.
[01:16:41] Unknown Host: Speeds up.
[01:16:41] Unknown Host: One of my big takeaways on Parker is he doesn't have a chip on his shoulder.
[01:16:46] Unknown Host: He's got a boulder on his shoulder.
[01:16:48] Unknown Host: And that boulder really drives him.
[01:16:51] Unknown Host: He calls it his revenge tour, the whole company.
[01:16:53] Unknown Host: I think this is pretty common amongst some of the best CEOs.
[01:16:57] Unknown Host: And can be a real motivator.
[01:16:59] Unknown Host: And in his case, David Sachs put a boulder on his shoulder.
[01:17:02] Unknown Host: I have a chip on my shoulder.
[01:17:03] Unknown Host: And I had an old boss put it there.
[01:17:05] Unknown Host: I had a guy work for for a decade.
[01:17:08] Unknown Host: When I went to resigned, he said,
[01:17:10] Unknown Host: you'll be nothing without me.
[01:17:12] Unknown Host: And this is like 30 years ago.
[01:17:14] Unknown Host: And I still remember it.
[01:17:14] Unknown Host: And if I really want to get fired up,
[01:17:16] Unknown Host: I think about the day I resigned from that company.
[01:17:19] Unknown Host: So boulder on the shoulder, super useful.
[01:17:22] Unknown Host: Channel it.
[01:17:23] Unknown Host: I think it can be really useful for you.
[01:17:25] Unknown Host: My last thought on Parker and about scale up startup land writ large.
[01:17:29] Unknown Host: I meet with lots and lots of founders these days.
[01:17:32] Unknown Host: There's a new breed of founder.
[01:17:34] Unknown Host: I call five tool founders.
[01:17:36] Unknown Host: Now a great baseball player can hit,
[01:17:38] Unknown Host: can hit with power, can catch, can run and throw all in an elite level.
[01:17:44] Unknown Host: And I'm noticing a new breed of founder who was kind of like that.
[01:17:48] Unknown Host: And I think Parker's one of them.
[01:17:50] Unknown Host: I think Brett from Sierra's one of them.
[01:17:52] Unknown Host: My T from 11 Labs gave from Rogo, Darra from Delphi,
[01:17:56] Unknown Host: where they're very good at coding.
[01:18:00] Unknown Host: They're very good at design.
[01:18:02] Unknown Host: They have vision.
[01:18:03] Unknown Host: They can recruit and they can sell.
[01:18:06] Unknown Host: Those are all five tools that they have in their back.
[01:18:08] Unknown Host: And I'm noticing more and more of them.
[01:18:11] Unknown Host: And if you're one of those founders
[01:18:13] Unknown Host: as deeply technical like them,
[01:18:14] Unknown Host: but can't quite storytell in sell,
[01:18:17] Unknown Host: I would work on that and get some coaching on that
[01:18:20] Unknown Host: and get some feedback on it because those five tool players
[01:18:23] Unknown Host: are worth their weight and gold.
[01:18:25] Unknown Host: And if you can be a five tool player that really opens up a lot of doors for you.
[01:18:29] Unknown Host: Okay, those are my thoughts.
[01:18:30] Unknown Host: Lots of takeaways from Parker.
[01:18:32] Unknown Host: I'll see you on the next episode.
