[00:00:00] Ripley was born out of this revenge fantasy.
[00:00:04] Parker Conrad: That's what got the company going
[00:00:06] Parker Conrad: and it's certainly what kept me going
[00:00:09] Parker Conrad: for the first couple of years.
[00:00:10] Parker Conrad: And I love the people I work with.
[00:00:12] Parker Conrad: I really like the problems that we're solving.
[00:00:15] Parker Conrad: I feel like we're making a difference for customers
[00:00:18] Parker Conrad: in this small way for their companies.
[00:00:20] Parker Conrad: And that's all extremely motivating.
[00:00:21] Parker Conrad: But early on, it's a grind.
[00:00:24] Parker Conrad: People come to me all the time,
[00:00:25] Parker Conrad: they're like, oh, I'm thinking about doing,
[00:00:26] Parker Conrad: sorry, your company, what do you think?
[00:00:28] Parker Conrad: And my advice is always, don't do it.
[00:00:29] Parker Conrad: It's a terrible idea.
[00:00:48] Okay, in this episode, you're going to hear
[00:00:50] Unknown Host: from Parker Conrad.
[00:00:52] He's one of the most compelling CEOs
[00:00:54] Unknown Host: in Silicon Valley, in my opinion.
[00:00:56] Unknown Host: He runs Ripley.
[00:00:57] Unknown Host: It's an amazing back office software company.
[00:01:00] Unknown Host: It's a $17 billion market cap
[00:01:02] Unknown Host: with 4,000 employees incredibly successful.
[00:01:05] Unknown Host: Almost everyone including myself never thought
[00:01:08] Unknown Host: he would get this company off the ground.
[00:01:10] Unknown Host: And that's because he was very violently fired
[00:01:14] Unknown Host: from his last company's benefits.
[00:01:15] Unknown Host: And I remember when that went down,
[00:01:17] Unknown Host: I thought, man, he's done.
[00:01:19] Unknown Host: He'll never get up off the mat.
[00:01:20] Unknown Host: And I'm really impressed the ass and how well he's done.
[00:01:23] Unknown Host: He's also had a lot of drama with a competitor,
[00:01:25] Unknown Host: deal very recently, who was spying on information
[00:01:29] Unknown Host: inside his systems.
[00:01:30] Unknown Host: And there's a lawsuit and arrests
[00:01:32] Unknown Host: and all kinds of drama around that.
[00:01:33] Unknown Host: So there's lots of good drama in here for you
[00:01:36] Unknown Host: who are into that.
[00:01:37] Unknown Host: But in between the drama, there's some pearls
[00:01:39] Unknown Host: of skill up CEO wisdom.
[00:01:41] Unknown Host: He's not your typical CEO.
[00:01:43] Unknown Host: He re-thinks things from scratch
[00:01:45] Unknown Host: in a way that I find compelling.
[00:01:46] Unknown Host: I like the way he thinks about hiring.
[00:01:49] Unknown Host: I think it's quite interesting how his company
[00:01:51] Unknown Host: has over 100 former founders in it.
[00:01:54] Unknown Host: I like the way he thinks about scaling
[00:01:57] Unknown Host: without getting his chloretic.
[00:01:58] Unknown Host: 4,000 people is pretty big.
[00:02:00] Unknown Host: It's still moving fast, very hard to do.
[00:02:02] Unknown Host: And I like how his chip on his shoulder
[00:02:05] Unknown Host: can supercharge his whole career.
[00:02:06] Unknown Host: And that came supercharge years too.
[00:02:08] Unknown Host: So he's going to get into that.
[00:02:09] Unknown Host: Parker's basically written the book
[00:02:11] Unknown Host: on turning your darkest professional moment
[00:02:14] Unknown Host: into your greatest competitive advantage.
[00:02:16] Unknown Host: I hope you like it.
[00:02:18] How you doing?
[00:02:19] Doing pretty good.
[00:02:20] Unknown Host: It's Sequoia, one of the things they always talk about
[00:02:23] Unknown Host: is they like founders with chips on their shoulders.
[00:02:27] Unknown Host: Do you have a chip on your shoulder?
[00:02:28] Unknown Host: I think so.
[00:02:30] Parker Conrad: I think it's like maybe faded a little bit over time.
[00:02:33] Parker Conrad: I tried very hard to keep it home to razor sharpness.
[00:02:36] Parker Conrad: But I think certainly,
[00:02:38] Parker Conrad: Ripley was born out of this revenge fantasy.
[00:02:43] Parker Conrad: And that's what got the company going.
[00:02:46] Parker Conrad: And it's certainly what kept me going
[00:02:49] Parker Conrad: for the first couple of years.
[00:02:51] Parker Conrad: There are a lot of other things that I love about my job.
[00:02:52] Parker Conrad: I love the people I work with.
[00:02:54] Parker Conrad: I sort of really like the problems that we're solving.
[00:02:57] Parker Conrad: I feel like we're making a difference for customers
[00:03:00] Parker Conrad: in this sort of small way for their companies.
[00:03:02] Parker Conrad: And that's all extremely motivating.
[00:03:04] Parker Conrad: But yeah, early on, it's a grind
[00:03:07] Parker Conrad: when you're starting a company.
[00:03:09] Parker Conrad: And this wasn't like my first rodeo.
[00:03:11] Parker Conrad: It's my third.
[00:03:12] Parker Conrad: And doing it the third time around,
[00:03:15] Parker Conrad: I think they're really like it was helpful to have this
[00:03:18] Parker Conrad: like extra bit of motivation that was there for me.
[00:03:22] Parker Conrad: Every night when I went to bed
[00:03:24] Parker Conrad: and like every morning when I woke up,
[00:03:26] do you think that you have exacted revenge
[00:03:30] Unknown Host: on those doubters and those people who did you wrong
[00:03:34] Unknown Host: or not and do you think you'll ever put that
[00:03:37] Unknown Host: to bed in your own brain?
[00:03:40] Or is it a source of constant motivation
[00:03:42] Unknown Host: for the rest of your life?
[00:03:44] I don't know.
[00:03:45] Parker Conrad: So have you ever seen there's a South Park episode?
[00:03:47] Parker Conrad: The underpants, Nomes.
[00:03:50] Parker Conrad: I love it.
[00:03:50] Parker Conrad: It's my favorite episode.
[00:03:52] Unknown Host: So it's sort of, yeah, underpants those for people
[00:03:54] Parker Conrad: who are familiar with it.
[00:03:56] Parker Conrad: The kids sort of follow these Nomes
[00:03:57] Parker Conrad: that are like stealing everyone's underpants
[00:03:59] Parker Conrad: and they follow them to their secret underground layer.
[00:04:02] And they're like, why are you stealing everyone's underpants?
[00:04:04] Parker Conrad: And there's this sort of secret plan for world domination.
[00:04:07] Parker Conrad: And it's like step one, like steal underpants,
[00:04:09] Parker Conrad: step three, world domination.
[00:04:12] Parker Conrad: And the kids are like, what step two?
[00:04:14] Parker Conrad: And they're like, oh shit, we never really,
[00:04:16] Parker Conrad: we never really thought about that.
[00:04:17] Parker Conrad: And sometimes I think it's a little bit like that with me
[00:04:20] Parker Conrad: where it was like, I felt like when things went
[00:04:23] Parker Conrad: south as benefits, I wasn't allowed to talk about it.
[00:04:27] Parker Conrad: And the entire story was being written
[00:04:30] Parker Conrad: by sort of my antagonists that were just saying all the stuff
[00:04:34] Parker Conrad: that I felt wasn't true, wasn't actually what was going on,
[00:04:38] Parker Conrad: like it was unfair.
[00:04:39] Parker Conrad: And I couldn't do anything about it.
[00:04:41] Parker Conrad: And so for me, there was always kind of this idea
[00:04:43] Parker Conrad: where I was like step one, build this like
[00:04:47] Parker Conrad: multi-hundred billion dollar outcome
[00:04:49] Parker Conrad: in like the exact same space and by doing it
[00:04:52] Parker Conrad: in exactly the opposite way of everything that they said
[00:04:55] Parker Conrad: was like the right way to do it.
[00:04:57] Parker Conrad: And then like step three was like somehow like, you know,
[00:04:59] Parker Conrad: get revenge on all of them.
[00:05:02] Parker Conrad: And like step two was like always sort of like vaguely
[00:05:04] Parker Conrad: like how's like a connected to B was like,
[00:05:06] Parker Conrad: sort of has always been sort of unclear.
[00:05:08] Parker Conrad: The company's a lot of fun.
[00:05:10] Parker Conrad: You know, like I started out and not just revenge.
[00:05:13] Parker Conrad: Yeah, I mean everyone sort of told me,
[00:05:14] Parker Conrad: well you need to develop actually early on.
[00:05:16] Parker Conrad: Like our series A investor, you know,
[00:05:20] Parker Conrad: I was very open about these motivations.
[00:05:23] Parker Conrad: And the moon was like, he has kind of dark.
[00:05:26] Parker Conrad: Like maybe you should talk to someone about that.
[00:05:28] Parker Conrad: And actually there's like an exact coach that came in
[00:05:30] Parker Conrad: and I talked to this guy and you know,
[00:05:32] Parker Conrad: he was sort of constantly like you need to have all
[00:05:34] Parker Conrad: these positive motivations and no negative motivations.
[00:05:37] Parker Conrad: And he went and he did sort of interviews
[00:05:39] Parker Conrad: with all of my direct reports of the company.
[00:05:42] Parker Conrad: And one of his questions was like,
[00:05:43] Parker Conrad: how do you feel about the fact that Parker is like motivated
[00:05:46] Parker Conrad: in these ways and everyone was like,
[00:05:49] Parker Conrad: I hope he never loses it.
[00:05:50] Parker Conrad: And so there was definitely like that element of it.
[00:05:54] Parker Conrad: But like over time, I think, you know,
[00:05:58] Parker Conrad: despite all of my attempts to sort of like focus
[00:06:02] Parker Conrad: my anger on this stuff, I think that yeah,
[00:06:05] Parker Conrad: like a lot of, you know, sort of day to day is like,
[00:06:08] Parker Conrad: you know, all of that stuff is very distant
[00:06:10] Parker Conrad: and it's much more about sort of the excitement
[00:06:14] Parker Conrad: of what we're building and the problems that we're solving
[00:06:17] Parker Conrad: and the people that I work with.
[00:06:19] Parker Conrad: Oh, I really enjoy working with.
[00:06:20] Parker Conrad: Yes or no, have you exacted revenge
[00:06:25] Unknown Host: on your antagonists from benefits?
[00:06:28] I don't think so.
[00:06:29] Unknown Host: Will you at some point answer that question as a yes
[00:06:33] Unknown Host: and what point is that a yes?
[00:06:35] Unknown Host: I'm not sure that there is any $100 billion IPO kind of thing.
[00:06:40] Unknown Host: It's like, okay, check, I was right.
[00:06:44] Unknown Host: I don't think that that, I'm not sure that like one leads
[00:06:47] Parker Conrad: to the other, you know, and I think that you don't necessarily
[00:06:51] Parker Conrad: get that kind of satisfaction.
[00:06:53] Parker Conrad: But also everything sort of fades with time.
[00:06:58] Parker Conrad: It stops being the thing that is like the focus
[00:07:02] Parker Conrad: of what you're doing every single day.
[00:07:04] Parker Conrad: I remember when that whole thing went down
[00:07:07] and then I remember you got your series A and I thought,
[00:07:12] Unknown Host: okay, you had someone painted a scarlet letter on you
[00:07:17] Unknown Host: and I was like, it's going to be hard for him to raise again
[00:07:20] Unknown Host: and you raise.
[00:07:21] Unknown Host: You talk about that fundraise and how did it go down
[00:07:26] Unknown Host: like getting over that must have been non-trivial.
[00:07:30] Unknown Host: It was a weird process because there were definitely
[00:07:36] Parker Conrad: like, I mean, at the time, Rippling was doing really well.
[00:07:39] Parker Conrad: I mean, like the numbers, we kind of showed everyone our numbers.
[00:07:42] Parker Conrad: The numbers were quite impressive.
[00:07:44] Unknown Host: And you had a personally, you know, angel funded it, I assume.
[00:07:48] Unknown Host: You seated it.
[00:07:49] Parker Conrad: I did some amount and then we raised a seed round
[00:07:52] Parker Conrad: where we had a bunch of like really early believers.
[00:07:55] Parker Conrad: A lot.
[00:07:56] Parker Conrad: And a lot of them were former Xanafits seed investors.
[00:08:00] Parker Conrad: Who really backed me again.
[00:08:02] Parker Conrad: And a lot of sort of people in the YC community.
[00:08:05] Parker Conrad: YC partners initialized Gary Tan, the Sam Oldman, all those guys.
[00:08:09] Parker Conrad: So you're doing the A, you got the scarlet letter.
[00:08:11] Unknown Host: And so then we went out to raise our series A
[00:08:14] Parker Conrad: and it was very controversial.
[00:08:16] Parker Conrad: And there were like every firm was really interested
[00:08:19] Parker Conrad: because the numbers were so good.
[00:08:21] Parker Conrad: And I think there were a couple of firms that went really deep.
[00:08:26] Parker Conrad: Like basically at the time, the partner at Sequoia,
[00:08:30] Parker Conrad: Mike Furnall, who was looking at the deal.
[00:08:33] Parker Conrad: Mike came to me and he said, look, there's one reason to do this deal.
[00:08:37] Parker Conrad: And there's one reason not to do this deal.
[00:08:39] Parker Conrad: And they're the same reason.
[00:08:41] Parker Conrad: And that was what everyone was trying to figure out.
[00:08:44] Parker Conrad: And I think, you know, Sequoia went really deep.
[00:08:49] Parker Conrad: And, you know, I think Mike told me that, you know, you guys did,
[00:08:52] Parker Conrad: I mean, because Sequoia always does this just incredibly deep diligence.
[00:08:55] Parker Conrad: You know, talk to like 50 different executives
[00:08:59] Parker Conrad: or people in management positions,
[00:09:01] Parker Conrad: it's benefits to really understand the picture.
[00:09:03] Parker Conrad: And came away with a lot of conviction that they felt like,
[00:09:07] Parker Conrad: okay, you know, we Sequoia feel very, very comfort with this.
[00:09:10] Parker Conrad: Unfortunately, we didn't end up working with Sequoia at that point.
[00:09:14] Parker Conrad: It was a little bit later.
[00:09:15] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:09:16] But a couple of other firms did that as well.
[00:09:18] Parker Conrad: And there were a couple that kind of just like backed out.
[00:09:22] Parker Conrad: And you know, one firm sort of lead guy there, you know,
[00:09:26] Parker Conrad: called up David, David Sacks.
[00:09:29] Parker Conrad: And, you know, I got a phone call in the Sunday night,
[00:09:31] Parker Conrad: said, hey, so and so spoke with David,
[00:09:33] Parker Conrad: we've got to cancel the child immediately on the Monday.
[00:09:36] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:09:37] Parker Conrad: You know, like it was just that there was sort of a more superficial amount of diligence on it.
[00:09:41] Parker Conrad: There were these two camps.
[00:09:43] Parker Conrad: And, you know, but even so,
[00:09:46] Parker Conrad: there were enough people in the camp of like,
[00:09:49] Parker Conrad: we're excited about the business and not concerned about the history
[00:09:53] Parker Conrad: that the round was like really competitive and yeah,
[00:09:56] Parker Conrad: it's done nice, you know, on great terms.
[00:09:58] Parker Conrad: Nice.
[00:09:59] Parker Conrad: We were pretty excited about it.
[00:10:00] Unknown Host: Once the last time you saw David,
[00:10:02] Parker Conrad: I have not spoken to him since about a week before I left benefits.
[00:10:07] Parker Conrad: I see.
[00:10:08] Parker Conrad: I've sort of like seen him across the room at a conference since then.
[00:10:12] Parker Conrad: Anything you want to say to him today?
[00:10:15] Probably not a great idea.
[00:10:19] Parker Conrad: How about, I'll say it for you.
[00:10:22] I told you so.
[00:10:24] Parker Conrad: I don't actually think that that's what I think like if I was talking to David or like,
[00:10:33] Parker Conrad: like Ben or Lars,
[00:10:35] Parker Conrad: yeah, I would really be like, why?
[00:10:37] Parker Conrad: You know, like why?
[00:10:39] Parker Conrad: Like I look at it and it just,
[00:10:40] Parker Conrad: it feels like it was so unnecessary.
[00:10:42] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:10:43] Parker Conrad: You know, like, like even in a world where they were like,
[00:10:46] Parker Conrad: hey, we've got to make a change.
[00:10:48] Like those types of things are usually not accompanied by the type of character assassination.
[00:10:54] Parker Conrad: Like, and it was like,
[00:10:56] deep and prolonged effort.
[00:11:00] Like they hired people and those people were sort of doing this in the media,
[00:11:05] Parker Conrad: like pitching stories about like week after week after week.
[00:11:08] Parker Conrad: And that is just like, it's unusual, it's expensive, it's like a lot of effort.
[00:11:12] Parker Conrad: I remember I went down and I remember the media, they wrote some things that were very tough.
[00:11:17] Unknown Host: They basically blamed a lot of stuff on you.
[00:11:20] Unknown Host: I don't remember the prolonged, but why do you think they thought that was a good idea?
[00:11:25] Unknown Host: I mean, they're relatively irrational economic actors.
[00:11:29] Some of this I think is like David.
[00:11:31] Parker Conrad: And some of this you sort of see in the way that David,
[00:11:34] Parker Conrad: I mean, is like, you know, very successful as sort of this more political type of actor.
[00:11:43] Parker Conrad: And I remember David came to me at one point.
[00:11:46] We know it's benefits when we were having our own sort of conflict with ADP.
[00:11:50] Parker Conrad: We ended up in some litigation with them.
[00:11:52] Parker Conrad: And David told me he said, look, here's the thing.
[00:11:56] Parker Conrad: If you're ever in kind of one of these media shit fights,
[00:12:00] Parker Conrad: you want to attack attack attack attack.
[00:12:04] Parker Conrad: He had a play.
[00:12:05] Parker Conrad: And if the other guy rolls over and cries, Uncle,
[00:12:09] Parker Conrad: that means it's working.
[00:12:11] Parker Conrad: And you want to keep attacking attacking attacking attacking.
[00:12:16] Parker Conrad: And I think that that was like his playbook.
[00:12:20] Parker Conrad: Like that was sort of the way it operated.
[00:12:23] And you know, and some of it it wasn't just that they blamed me for everything.
[00:12:27] Parker Conrad: I mean, like, look, ultimately I'm the CEO.
[00:12:29] Parker Conrad: I am responsible for things.
[00:12:31] Parker Conrad: It was the way that things that were mistakes that were like,
[00:12:36] Parker Conrad: hey, we thought this was what we were supposed to do.
[00:12:40] And it was something else.
[00:12:41] Parker Conrad: We were instead the legal word for this would be like,
[00:12:45] Parker Conrad: it was like, you know, there's some intentional kind of thing.
[00:12:48] Parker Conrad: For what was, I think, in retrospect,
[00:12:52] Parker Conrad: much more just sort of accidental, like as companies are growing quickly.
[00:12:57] Parker Conrad: And you know, little things that you know, you sort of don't recognize
[00:13:01] Parker Conrad: as or just unaware as like things that are happening.
[00:13:05] Parker Conrad: And suddenly are like, actually, you overlooked something.
[00:13:08] Parker Conrad: And how did you feel like when you first saw it,
[00:13:11] Unknown Host: I assume you didn't have a heads up, you saw it.
[00:13:14] Unknown Host: Like, was it anger?
[00:13:16] Unknown Host: Was it confusion?
[00:13:17] Unknown Host: What did you say to your wife?
[00:13:19] Unknown Host: Like, what was going on inside the four walls of your body?
[00:13:22] Unknown Host: One of the things that happened right before the announcement
[00:13:26] Parker Conrad: is I was like so depressed about the whole thing.
[00:13:30] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:13:31] Parker Conrad: That I stopped looking at the media.
[00:13:34] Parker Conrad: And I didn't read stories about me or about rippling
[00:13:39] Parker Conrad: for like five or six years from that.
[00:13:44] Parker Conrad: I was a long time or as benefits.
[00:13:47] Parker Conrad: And my wife would always read them.
[00:13:49] Parker Conrad: And so when the announcement came out,
[00:13:51] Parker Conrad: there was a press release that we had drafted.
[00:13:53] Parker Conrad: You know, there was like, you know, me and like the people from Andreessen
[00:13:57] Parker Conrad: and like David.
[00:13:59] Parker Conrad: And it was sort of one of these sort of anodine things that was like,
[00:14:02] Parker Conrad: hey, look, company needs new type of leadership.
[00:14:05] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:14:06] Unknown Host: Parker, you know, like great job taking it this far.
[00:14:09] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:14:10] Parker Conrad: David coming in.
[00:14:11] Parker Conrad: What's this been more time with this family?
[00:14:13] Parker Conrad: Typical stuff.
[00:14:14] Parker Conrad: Typical stuff.
[00:14:15] Parker Conrad: And instead, they just like David issued a different press release.
[00:14:20] Parker Conrad: And the press release was like, this company has a whole bunch
[00:14:24] Parker Conrad: of compliance problems.
[00:14:25] Parker Conrad: It's because, you know, Parker doesn't care about compliance.
[00:14:29] Parker Conrad: He's not here anymore.
[00:14:30] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:14:31] Parker Conrad: And it went south from there.
[00:14:32] Parker Conrad: And I remember, you know, when it came out, I mean, it was such a shock.
[00:14:37] Parker Conrad: It was just very unexpected.
[00:14:39] Parker Conrad: And then it just got worse from there.
[00:14:41] Parker Conrad: And it was actually my wife that read it and turned to me and said,
[00:14:44] Parker Conrad: oh, they fucked you.
[00:14:46] Parker Conrad: Like, she was like, don't even read it.
[00:14:47] Parker Conrad: Like, don't look at it.
[00:14:48] Parker Conrad: It was deeply depressing.
[00:14:49] Parker Conrad: I mean, there were like really, really dark moments.
[00:14:53] Parker Conrad: And some of like the chip on the shoulder was kind of like,
[00:14:57] Parker Conrad: I'm either there was sort of this one little ray of light,
[00:15:03] Parker Conrad: this one path out, which was like, you know, build this company
[00:15:08] Parker Conrad: and make it successful.
[00:15:10] Parker Conrad: Or like, it's just all over and you kind of give up.
[00:15:13] Parker Conrad: And it was kind of like, it felt like those were the two choices.
[00:15:15] Parker Conrad: And like that.
[00:15:16] Parker Conrad: And that was very hard and very depressing.
[00:15:19] Parker Conrad: But it was also like very clarifying and very motivating.
[00:15:22] Parker Conrad: That I felt like, okay, like this is like, this is the only thing
[00:15:25] Parker Conrad: that I'm here for.
[00:15:26] Parker Conrad: And this is the only thing that I care about is like making this thing work.
[00:15:31] Parker Conrad: Okay.
[00:15:32] Unknown Host: A lot of people listening are founder CEOs, people want to be CEOs.
[00:15:38] Unknown Host: You've been through some crises and some shit shows.
[00:15:41] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:15:42] Unknown Host: I have to advice for people.
[00:15:46] Crisis going on.
[00:15:48] Most CEOs hit some big shit show crises during their tenure.
[00:15:53] Unknown Host: Any advice?
[00:15:54] Unknown Host: People come to me all the time.
[00:15:55] They're like, I'm like, thinking about doing, you know, a starting company,
[00:15:58] Parker Conrad: what do you think?
[00:15:59] Parker Conrad: And my advice is always like, don't do it.
[00:16:00] Parker Conrad: It's terrible idea.
[00:16:01] Parker Conrad: And like, and people always sort of laugh.
[00:16:04] Parker Conrad: They're like, ha ha.
[00:16:05] Parker Conrad: But like, it's very like, it's very real.
[00:16:08] Parker Conrad: Like, I do think that it is like, like, much, much harder than people expect.
[00:16:14] Parker Conrad: It's not just that it's hard to be successful.
[00:16:16] Parker Conrad: It's that it's sort of really kind of soul-destroying,
[00:16:19] Parker Conrad: like even when you're successful.
[00:16:21] Parker Conrad: And very hard to kind of manage your psychology through that process.
[00:16:27] Parker Conrad: And people come out the other end.
[00:16:28] Parker Conrad: And there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of, I think, talk about, you know,
[00:16:33] Parker Conrad: failure being sort of this positive thing that you've learned a lot from.
[00:16:37] Parker Conrad: And actually, I think you don't learn a whole lot from failure.
[00:16:41] Parker Conrad: And you learn a lot more from success.
[00:16:44] Parker Conrad: And it's really hard.
[00:16:46] Parker Conrad: You know, usually I think people, I see many more people that do something like this
[00:16:50] Parker Conrad: and don't succeed.
[00:16:51] Parker Conrad: And it sort of like destroys a lot.
[00:16:54] Parker Conrad: You know, it destroys marriages, relationships, you know, ambitions.
[00:17:02] Parker Conrad: You know, like people kind of come out like a shell.
[00:17:06] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:17:07] Parker Conrad: They're former selves.
[00:17:08] Parker Conrad: And so it's not something that I'd recommend.
[00:17:10] Parker Conrad: I kind of agree.
[00:17:11] Unknown Host: I described HubSpot as like, two steps forward.
[00:17:14] Unknown Host: One giant step back, two steps forward.
[00:17:16] Unknown Host: One giant step back.
[00:17:18] Unknown Host: Over and over again.
[00:17:19] Unknown Host: It was, it looks smooth and easy from the outside.
[00:17:22] Unknown Host: But man, it was a grind.
[00:17:23] Unknown Host: It was not easy.
[00:17:24] Unknown Host: And there were, there were a lot of moments where I really hated my job.
[00:17:28] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:17:29] Unknown Host: You feel the same way.
[00:17:31] Yeah, I mean, I would say that one thing that was, that was different about Ripley.
[00:17:36] Parker Conrad: I think in part because of the experience, its benefits.
[00:17:40] Parker Conrad: It's like people sometimes ask me like, you know, what I learned.
[00:17:42] Parker Conrad: And, and you know, sort of, there's like, insuciently, I'm kind of like, I didn't learn anything.
[00:17:47] Parker Conrad: Like, you know, if benefits failed for dumb reasons and like, there was nothing to learn from that.
[00:17:52] Parker Conrad: But I do think that like, you know, over time you sort of slowly accumulate a kind of pattern recognition
[00:17:59] Parker Conrad: about like what matters and what doesn't.
[00:18:02] Parker Conrad: And, and that can, that makes things a little bit easier because there are a lot of things that come up
[00:18:08] Parker Conrad: where you're like, this probably doesn't matter.
[00:18:11] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:18:12] Parker Conrad: Well, and it sucks, but like, it's no where's near and no matter how bad things have ever been at Ripley,
[00:18:17] Parker Conrad: they have never come even close to how bad things were in the sort of six months,
[00:18:23] Parker Conrad: like, you know, right after the end of Zenefits or one or one I left Zenefits.
[00:18:27] Parker Conrad: And so everything kind of pales in comparison.
[00:18:30] Parker Conrad: And, and that is always, that's sort of comforting in a way.
[00:18:34] Parker Conrad: What?
[00:18:35] You brought something up.
[00:18:37] Unknown Host: What matters and what doesn't?
[00:18:39] Unknown Host: Like what matters that people don't think matter and what doesn't matter that people think matters?
[00:18:43] Unknown Host: I mean, sort of the advantage of having done something before,
[00:18:46] Parker Conrad: I think you start to have good judgment about what is, you know,
[00:18:51] Parker Conrad: because so many of the things that come up are probably like, doesn't matter.
[00:18:56] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:18:57] Parker Conrad: Not going to make a difference.
[00:18:58] Parker Conrad: And some things come up are like, ooh, that one's going to count.
[00:19:01] Parker Conrad: And I think it's hard for first time CEOs to really see the difference.
[00:19:08] Parker Conrad: I mean, those, it feels like everything's going to matter.
[00:19:10] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:19:11] Parker Conrad: And that's part of why it's like so overwhelming and awful.
[00:19:14] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:19:15] Parker Conrad: And some of the things really actually do matter.
[00:19:17] Parker Conrad: What really matters?
[00:19:20] Unknown Host: I think getting your strategy right, like where are we headed in the bus
[00:19:24] Unknown Host: and getting the right people on the team are really important things.
[00:19:29] Unknown Host: And a lot of other stuff can fall by the wayside.
[00:19:32] Unknown Host: Yeah, I mean, those things matter.
[00:19:34] Unknown Host: And getting like your mission set up so people can get excited about the darn thing.
[00:19:38] Yeah, I'm trying to think like, I mean, I think like there are little things that go wrong
[00:19:43] Parker Conrad: that feel very consequential in the moment, that you start to realize over time
[00:19:48] Parker Conrad: don't matter.
[00:19:49] Parker Conrad: And like, if you're not growing that, that obviously matters.
[00:19:53] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:19:54] Parker Conrad: At Ripley, and it took us like two years to get to a point where things started working.
[00:19:59] Parker Conrad: Yeah, I was about that too.
[00:20:01] Parker Conrad: And in two years, it was sort of this exercise to try and basically beg the team not to leave
[00:20:08] Parker Conrad: until things started working.
[00:20:10] Parker Conrad: But there was also like zero doubt in my mind that it was going to work.
[00:20:15] Parker Conrad: And that was sort of a big difference because like I sort of knew that if you built these things
[00:20:22] Parker Conrad: and got to this island of product market fit that was admittedly pretty far over the edge of the horizon.
[00:20:30] Parker Conrad: But like I knew that there was land out there.
[00:20:33] Parker Conrad: And that if you could get there, this was going to work.
[00:20:37] Parker Conrad: And I had seen what was working and why it's benefits.
[00:20:41] Parker Conrad: I just had like unshakable convictions that this was.
[00:20:45] Parker Conrad: And so there was never a doubt that was going to work.
[00:20:47] Parker Conrad: And it was merely about like whether like we're really we could keep prevent everyone from quitting
[00:20:53] Parker Conrad: like before we got there.
[00:20:56] Parker Conrad: And so early on actually like trying to just keep the team together.
[00:21:00] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:21:01] Parker Conrad: Mattered a lot.
[00:21:02] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:21:03] Parker Conrad: And at that point, whether it was like working today or not like didn't so much in this very specific context
[00:21:09] Parker Conrad: of the company that I was building.
[00:21:11] Parker Conrad: And I think for a lot of other companies, that's not true because like you know you might believe
[00:21:16] Parker Conrad: that things are going to work but you're probably wrong.
[00:21:19] Parker Conrad: Or you know like you're if you have a lot of conviction about it, your conviction is like misplaced.
[00:21:23] Parker Conrad: Maybe mine was too, but I you know like I was sort of crazy enough or believe that I had reasons
[00:21:28] Parker Conrad: to believe that this was going to work.
[00:21:31] Unknown Host: Parker.
[00:21:33] Unknown Host: You're kind of a contrarian along a lot of lines.
[00:21:36] Unknown Host: That's one of the things I've always liked about you.
[00:21:38] Unknown Host: What do people have totally wrong about being a CEO?
[00:21:43] Unknown Host: Like there seems to be sort of a rule book around it that is kind of getting rethought these days.
[00:21:50] Unknown Host: I feel like you're rethinking pieces of it.
[00:21:53] What's all wrong about CEOing?
[00:21:57] What are these founder CEOs?
[00:21:59] Unknown Host: What mistakes are they making?
[00:22:02] Parker Conrad: Well, I'll tell you.
[00:22:04] Parker Conrad: I mean, I don't know.
[00:22:05] Parker Conrad: I know so little about like any business that's not my own.
[00:22:08] Parker Conrad: So it's hard.
[00:22:09] Parker Conrad: It's hard for me to have like big opinions about like sort of the ecosystem.
[00:22:14] Parker Conrad: But I think that like one thing that I sort of believe in that maybe is becoming like more sort of more of the conventional wisdom today.
[00:22:28] Parker Conrad: I've always struggled with the idea that as a CEO you're supposed to kind of manage top down through a set of deputies.
[00:22:36] Parker Conrad: And you know, you hire people who are knowledgeable about this area.
[00:22:41] Parker Conrad: You trust them and you let them kind of do their thing.
[00:22:44] Parker Conrad: And that's just never worked for me.
[00:22:46] Parker Conrad: Like what's worked is you kind of have to reason from first principles.
[00:22:53] Parker Conrad: And you can do that with some of your lieutenants who can help you through it to sort of convince yourself of exactly what the right approach is in that area.
[00:23:02] Parker Conrad: And you have to have like real on an on the ground understanding of what's actually going on yourself.
[00:23:10] Parker Conrad: And if you don't have that like that's the only thing that's that's worked for me.
[00:23:15] Parker Conrad: And it's really it's tough to scale.
[00:23:18] Parker Conrad: It's tough to scale that it you know it's hard.
[00:23:20] Parker Conrad: It's hard on you.
[00:23:21] Parker Conrad: I think it's hard on some of the other people.
[00:23:23] Parker Conrad: But it's the it's the only thing that sort of work for me and the only thing that it's the thing that's really worked for Ripley.
[00:23:30] Parker Conrad: And so we have a leadership principle that we formalize on this that we call go and see that's that's basically like look if you're.
[00:23:37] Parker Conrad: It's true for me, but it's also true for you know executives and managers that like you know you've got to you've got to go right to the ground.
[00:23:46] Parker Conrad: Cold face.
[00:23:47] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:23:48] Parker Conrad: And get that's a good way of saying it right.
[00:23:51] Parker Conrad: And you've got to you know something there was a point in time where things were just like really going wrong with tax operations.
[00:24:00] Parker Conrad: And like you know we're we're a payroll company one of the things that we do is we do you know we do these sort of quarterly filings for clients.
[00:24:08] Parker Conrad: And you know there are thousands of agencies across the country that you need to send these to.
[00:24:12] Parker Conrad: And there are a million little things that can go wrong.
[00:24:15] Parker Conrad: And if anything's off by like a penny clients get like angry letters about this and it's really bad things were going wrong like the notice the rate at which clients were getting notices from Ripley.
[00:24:25] Parker Conrad: We knew was like higher than the notice rate at other companies and it was like an existential threat to the business.
[00:24:32] Parker Conrad: And like that was something where there was some muscle memory for me that this was actually something that we killed the company matters.
[00:24:38] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:24:39] Parker Conrad: It was something that matters.
[00:24:40] Parker Conrad: You know the only thing that worked to solve it was you know was what happened is I got you know like me and my COO and like you know the person running the team and like someone else we sort of wiped out our calendars we sat down.
[00:24:56] Parker Conrad: And we said for the next week you know we're going to just be tax ox ops agents.
[00:25:02] Parker Conrad: And so we're literally going to you know because there was this growing backlog of notices that needed to be addressed the clients were sending us.
[00:25:09] Parker Conrad: And we're just going to pick from the queue and start figuring out like calling up the tax agency.
[00:25:15] Parker Conrad: Why did the client get this notice what happened you know why did they believe that you know the amount was wrong or the money didn't get there the filing was not on time or something.
[00:25:26] Parker Conrad: And then reverse engineer it in our systems and be like and it was just like doing doing the actual work of do it was the only and then sort of like by doing that we developed this understanding of like what was broken about the process what was broken about the systems what were the changes that need to be made.
[00:25:42] Parker Conrad: But it was like impossible to diagnose or understand without sitting there and doing that.
[00:25:48] Parker Conrad: Okay on the matters thing it seems to me from just listening to you and I also spoke to a couple people on your team.
[00:25:55] Unknown Host: A lot of things matter and then one of the insights I think you've had is details matter from the CEO on down and you're in the details in a big way for a company that has four or
[00:26:08] Unknown Host: five thousand employees is that fair to say.
[00:26:12] Unknown Host: I think more so than me for sure it seems like you are like you sit in the middle of the engineering floor it sounds like you are on the coal phase for somebody in a pretty good size organization.
[00:26:25] Parker Conrad: I certainly try to be.
[00:26:27] Parker Conrad: I view that as like a huge compliment if you know from from the team I think the place where I try and do that the most and what's what's maybe sort of most unusual about Rippling is is that I'm the the only like full admin for Rippling in the
[00:26:45] Parker Conrad: other plane and so like I run payroll for the entire company across dozens of countries I manage sort of like benefits and you know a lot of like you know IT
[00:26:56] Parker Conrad: policies and other stuff within within the system.
[00:26:59] Parker Conrad: Yeah.
[00:27:00] Parker Conrad: You know approve expense reimbursements things like that.
[00:27:03] Unknown Host: I was similar to how spot I was at very active use of up spot one of the most active user for many.
[00:27:09] Unknown Host: So I think it's important it's like one of the things like people you know learn when they join Rippling is like the CEO approves every expense reimbursement over $10.
[00:27:18] Parker Conrad: And the reason for that is like not that I'm like this jerk that's like harassing people about their expenses.
[00:27:26] Parker Conrad: It's that I'm trying to actually use the product in the same ways that that clients would like a diligent controller or you know sort of accountant.
[00:27:36] Parker Conrad: Yeah would use the system and help review it in the same ways that they would and try and use that to sort of iterate and improve on things over time.
[00:27:43] Parker Conrad: There are a lot of things that we get wrong as a company but I do think that that element is like a little bit of a superpower because I know that you know the CEOs of you know ADP or they're not doing that.
[00:27:59] Unknown Host: They've never run payroll in their lives.
[00:28:02] Parker Conrad: Like never.
[00:28:04] Parker Conrad: You know there's a sort of on the ground understanding the system and that you know that doesn't mean that you know we always get everything right but I think that you know it's a it's a sort of control on the system.
[00:28:17] Parker Conrad: And one of the ways that it played one of the things that I'm most proud about is that we did the study where we we looked at companies that use Rippling and companies that use anything other than Rippling.
[00:28:28] Parker Conrad: And some of them use like modern systems competitors as far as that are sort of more recent market entrance. Some of them use the more old school systems and you just look at how many people those companies have in HR IT and finance roles and GNA roles within the organization.
[00:28:46] Parker Conrad: Based on LinkedIn data and what you find is that the companies that use Rippling at any even size range so you you have to look at it by company size obviously.
[00:28:55] Parker Conrad: You know companies that use Rippling have about half the people in those functions then companies that use anything I love that stem I love that's that and that's look I think that that you know it's not that you know our pitch is not like hey like you know like lay off people if you
[00:29:11] Parker Conrad: those extra headcount they represent all of this administrative burden they represent a tax on your business because those are people that are just moving data between systems dealing with administrative pain that you could instead redeploy for things that matter within your business.
[00:29:31] Unknown Host: So you're in the details you just talk about your own CEO journey from like the four of you to those 40 of you to 400 of you is 4,000 of you somehow you've managed to say in the details how has your job change what advice do you give to that founder with 40 people on how to scale it how did your job change and how did your day to day change.
[00:29:55] Unknown Host: I think probably the most important thing was the like the people a level below me and honestly I think that probably like their jobs have changed a lot more interesting then then mine has because the executive senior Rippling has been like pretty like stable over time there's been like there's been some turnover but I think you know a lot of the people that are there you know like the R CRO was the eighth
[00:30:24] Parker Conrad: person in the company and you know my COO joined when you know right after the series a but he and I you know had known each other since college so even friends for a long time you know there been a bunch of people that have sort of been there a long time.
[00:30:39] Parker Conrad: And so there's just I think a lot of trust and I think every you know everyone's kind of grow like everyone sort of grown in their in their function and their job for time.
[00:30:51] Unknown Host: One of the things I've noticed part of these do is as soon as they make their investment like the first thing they say it's like we got up level the team.
[00:30:58] Unknown Host: Yeah and when I look at the best companies a lot of the management teams are kind of homegrown like a lot of Hubspots management team been there since the pretty early days.
[00:31:09] Unknown Host: What do you think of that advice I think homegrown is really underrated homegrown is underrated but also like if the people sometimes the people that you're trying to grow or not going to make it sometimes you know and so I think that's the
[00:31:20] Parker Conrad: thing that you know and so I think what I would say is like hiring people that you just are you're really close to I mean we're just say but hiring people that like you've worked with that you're friends with that you enjoy working like really lowers the risk really underrated actually lowers the risk of
[00:31:38] Unknown Host: and and so what to school with yeah there are people that we brought in that you know we hired that we're not like that that have been unbelievably successful as well yeah.
[00:31:49] Parker Conrad: But there is something to the fact that like.
[00:31:53] Parker Conrad: You know for the for a long time Ripley and CMO he's now stepped into a different role but was this guy mad Epstein who was like you know I worked with him.
[00:32:04] Parker Conrad: I was a CMO my first company he was CMO it's benefits he joined Ripley and was CMO Ripley like it was just this long standing like professional relationship that I had and and there's some there's sort of something to that I feel like I have a pretty good sense of whether someone's going to make it or not and I'm sort of wondering like how would I do you know your job at Sequoia and advise like an entrepreneur on their team.
[00:32:32] Parker Conrad: I would have a lot of humility about it and I'd be like man I just don't I don't know how I would explain that or judge that and and one of the problems I think for investors is I think it's actually really hard to do from the outside and so even if you have like.
[00:32:45] Parker Conrad: Don't it yourself you know you're just not spending enough time at the company to really know about this exact and whether they're going to make it so the advice is like maybe not all that useful and then you know if you're if you're not referred to this for the first time.
[00:33:03] Parker Conrad: It just I don't see how anyone figures I mean looking back I'm like it I don't understand how anyone figures their way through this because it seems like so hard to know having not seen it but say the one thing I've known this was so many of the.
[00:33:15] Unknown Host: Early stage mid-stage startups is their hit rate on hiring that external been there done that CMO see what it is 50% within 18 months it's much harder than it looks you able to talk about it what have in this vein you're interviewing somebody what what's your filter what are you looking for what's your process these like do is there anything unusual you're doing around there that you think you might be have some intuition that people don't.
[00:33:44] Unknown Host: Here's what I do and I'm not I'm not saying that what I do is like the right thing to do yeah but usually what I do is I send candidates all of the investor materials that I prepared so I send like we write up a memo on the business there's like some metrics and I send all of that to them ahead of time so they have context and they show up to the meeting and I'm just like look this first meeting is really just a chance for you to ask me questions so you know sure you had a chance to look through this.
[00:34:13] Parker Conrad: You know what what didn't make sense to you what were you like I don't think that's right you know what did you have questions on let's talk through it and then usually we sort of talk through their questions and and and sort of secretly I'm sort of judging them by how that conversation progresses and so some people have like no questions and that's like that's usually pretty a pretty bad sign or some people have like clearly like fake questions yeah
[00:34:41] Parker Conrad: and some people like actually like even very skeptical questions are really good like if you're smart there's some people that like they immediately get to the core of the issue you know where they the identify like the two things that are going to really be problems and then and then sometimes we have a great discussion about it because you know I've got I thought about those things too you know I spend a lot of time like here's how we're approaching here's what I think and here's what didn't work and here's what I think is going to work and this is why this is so important.
[00:35:11] Parker Conrad: And and and sometimes the people that asked those really challenging questions they get it really quickly and they're like oh yeah and that means also that and then as a consequences of that and I think it works because it kind of simulates the act what the actual working relationship is going to be like where we're going to have those types of conversations in our one-on-one meetings like this and and that's going to work and so that's always been the thing that's been most telling for me that in back channel references yeah you know you know
[00:35:41] Parker Conrad: they're not I usually ask people like give me like six references not to because everyone's got to so you know give me six and then I call to randomly from that list and then I try really hard to find people that are not on your list and that that's been really telling the thing that I've always I don't have a good answer for is I found it's really hard to summon great executives on demand and so wait what do you mean by that?
[00:36:11] Parker Conrad: Well it's like someone suddenly someone weeps or someone is like it's like not going to make it and is you know and you're like crap I need a CTO yeah our current CTO who's amazing was someone that randomly fell into my lap you know that that someone it's a coil introduced me to and and it was like wow like this is amazing and it was very clear that
[00:36:41] Parker Conrad: you know this person was exactly who we should hire but we hired someone else you know six months earlier it was not working out and we hired that person
[00:36:52] Parker Conrad: sort of like it was one of those things where we had been looking for so long yeah you know
[00:36:58] Parker Conrad: we're so long it was like oh maybe
[00:37:02] maybe it'll work you know and we had does that ever work never never never does but like what are you gonna I mean like
[00:37:09] Parker Conrad: we've been looking I don't know I think we've been looking for like a year yeah you know it's just in all the his direct reports report to you in the meantime which is like brutal yeah and so
[00:37:20] Parker Conrad: and you know and and so what I mean I'll tell you what doesn't work is like usually like exact recruiters don't work okay and I was just about to ask you that okay
[00:37:30] exactly recruiters are you know great at sending you solid B candidates yeah and there's always the exception that proves the rules so we hired our CFO who's amazing good person to hire
[00:37:46] Unknown Host: through an executive crew and exactly like actually like really incredible yeah and so there are some exceptions but usually they
[00:37:54] Parker Conrad: send you a lot of of B candidates and the problem is that I think the really incredible people they get snatched up totally before they know for they leave with an
[00:38:05] Parker Conrad: exact recruiter like they're they're like you know they've always got people paying them yeah and they get a million options and they've got
[00:38:13] Parker Conrad: they've got relationships with people and someone is yanking them out like they sort of you know they sort of secretly whisper to their spouse that
[00:38:22] Parker Conrad: maybe they're thinking about leaving and there's five people in the morning that heard about it and are already like you know
[00:38:27] Parker Conrad: bit talking with them for a long time and it worked with them before and have been nurturing them the round drip marketing campaign make it into the okay let me ask
[00:38:35] Unknown Host: to relate to this you hire someone it's a month in you're like I might have fucked this up but it ended up working has that ever happened never
[00:38:47] Parker Conrad: okay so a month in if you if if your gut tells you it's not right you but all you just you how long do you wait
[00:38:56] always longer than a month how long do you wait six months yeah like I mean I like in the frustrating thing is like I see this behavior in
[00:39:05] Parker Conrad: managers at Ripley and I get very upset about it and I'm very angry about it like what I did you why did you
[00:39:13] Parker Conrad: fuck this up yeah you know like like you can see it happening like I have this conversation all the time where I'm
[00:39:18] Parker Conrad: like you know I'm like okay here's your team how many of these people right now like tell me which of these people you
[00:39:25] Parker Conrad: would bet your career on hmm and like whoa and it's like well this person and this person and I'm like none of the
[00:39:35] Parker Conrad: rest like well it's a tough value you know and I'm like okay get you know like fire all you like let's start over you
[00:39:41] Parker Conrad: know and like well you know like yeah but you know there's all kinds of reasons why you know yep
[00:39:46] Parker Conrad: can't you know not yet and inevitably they're all gone in here all gone but it takes a long time
[00:39:52] Parker Conrad: to get there and it's so frustrating so infuriating and it's like why why can't you as a manager just do
[00:39:59] Parker Conrad: the job that we expect if you and make the hard decisions and I make all the same mistakes myself right
[00:40:05] Parker Conrad: you know it's like you know equally difficult for me when things are not working out it sounds to
[00:40:11] Unknown Host: me from people that's spoken with inside of rippling in yourself that it was an intense startup
[00:40:20] Unknown Host: an all startups are pretty intense but it's now an intense scale up you've kept that peace and
[00:40:26] Unknown Host: intensity up as you scale through the years most of the founders I work with are really struggling
[00:40:32] Unknown Host: around 150 employees to bring in new people they didn't know well they're seeing a couple of middle
[00:40:39] Unknown Host: managers showing up that intensity and that pace doesn't seem to scale how have you scaled that
[00:40:44] Unknown Host: well I think one one thing that I believe very firmly is that there's ultimately only one person
[00:40:52] Parker Conrad: in the organization there's only one constituency for speed and it's you as the CEO
[00:40:59] Parker Conrad: and and so it's really one of your biggest jobs is to sort of set the clock speed of the organization
[00:41:05] Parker Conrad: and the reason is is that everyone else in the organization can sort of solve for
[00:41:11] Parker Conrad: all of their problems by just extending the timelines you know like they can get it done to
[00:41:18] Parker Conrad: you know the ways that they want to get it done they can you know they don't have to you know
[00:41:23] Parker Conrad: sort of make unreasonable asks of people that they're you know like every every other constraint
[00:41:28] Parker Conrad: can be solved for with more time what happens is things start to get like really slow and there are
[00:41:35] Parker Conrad: real problems with that for the organization long term but usually not for like any individual
[00:41:42] Parker Conrad: manager or executive within the company and so you're the only natural constituency for moving quickly
[00:41:48] Parker Conrad: and so you really have to be you really have to care about it and and you have to sort of
[00:41:55] Parker Conrad: pay attention when when people are trying to slow it down and so one of one of the things that
[00:42:02] Parker Conrad: happens is like your team will often come to you and they will present you with what I call
[00:42:07] Parker Conrad: CEO and a box decisions where they will say look we can do A or we can do B like you choose and
[00:42:13] Parker Conrad: it's this illusion of the choice. Yeah it's this a little bit it's an illusion of choice because the
[00:42:19] Parker Conrad: choice has already been made for you because the important choice was the decision that A and B
[00:42:25] Parker Conrad: cannot coexist and usually like my immediate reaction when someone brings me something like that
[00:42:33] Parker Conrad: is to just on principle insist that we have both a and E and like understand like what laws of
[00:42:40] Parker Conrad: physics are violated that prevent A and B from coax it is like the second law of thermodynamics
[00:42:47] Parker Conrad: problem sometimes it's like it's much harder for the team to do A and B and they would prefer not
[00:42:52] Parker Conrad: to do that. Sometimes it's actually just as simple as asking people for a third path you know
[00:42:59] Parker Conrad: to like say I don't I don't like these options like can we just think a little bit harder and is
[00:43:04] Parker Conrad: there some way to kind of get there when you think about like the pace at which organizations move
[00:43:12] Parker Conrad: I think the natural thing is people sort of believe man if you're like tyrannical CEO that's like
[00:43:18] Parker Conrad: driving people really hard and like you know what's going to happen it most maybe it's like 20% more
[00:43:25] Parker Conrad: Patrick callson has this great site that he put together on sort of like things that moved
[00:43:31] Parker Conrad: absurdly quickly and things that moved very slowly and it's this example of like we the space
[00:43:36] Parker Conrad: program to land some on the moon was like four years and the vanness bus lane was like two decades
[00:43:41] Parker Conrad: or something that's over Zesco and you sort of look at these at two different organizations that might
[00:43:47] Parker Conrad: both have good well-meaning people and like you know the organization that moves quickly it's like
[00:43:53] Parker Conrad: it's like orders it's like an order of magnitude faster it's not like 20% faster it's just amazing
[00:43:58] Parker Conrad: what what you can accomplish and so maybe the the sort of slightly more positive way of articulating
[00:44:05] Parker Conrad: this is I think that that people are often capable of so much more than they believe themselves to be
[00:44:11] Parker Conrad: capable of and so if you can sort of challenge them about the perceived constraints on the problem
[00:44:18] Parker Conrad: and explain to them the impact of being able to do a and b and why like what happens if we could do
[00:44:25] Parker Conrad: and the startups are somewhere between completely impossible and very very very very hard and there's
[00:44:32] Parker Conrad: such a narrow ray of light that passes between those two right the companies that make it through
[00:44:38] Parker Conrad: usually at multiple points in the journey find ways to do things that are seemingly impossible
[00:44:45] Parker Conrad: and it is you have to sort of acknowledge that what you're asking for is like really hard and you
[00:44:50] Parker Conrad: understand that and it's just there's no other way you know and so let's sit down together and think
[00:44:56] Parker Conrad: about whether it's possible and sometimes people find clever solutions or new new reserves of
[00:45:05] Parker Conrad: possibility to kind of get there and if you kind of do that enough it compounds
[00:45:11] and and like you can accomplish a lot more than the company that isn't doing that.
[00:45:16] Parker Conrad: I had a line where somebody would bring me something like that no it's say
[00:45:22] when Moses came down from the mountain and he had the tablet was there an 11th
[00:45:29] Unknown Host: commandment that we all miss that we couldn't do this thing we're talking about right now.
[00:45:34] Unknown Host: Yeah exactly you know yeah well it's not it's not a lot of physics we can figure it out.
[00:45:40] Unknown Host: Okay I hear you've got something like 40 or 50 ex founders on your management teams in your company
[00:45:49] Unknown Host: what's going on with that why are you doing it how do you manage that cast?
[00:45:53] Unknown Host: I think it's actually a lot more than that now okay um but why?
[00:45:59] Parker Conrad: I think that are you aquahiring or hiring like what's the what's the sometimes we acquire sometimes
[00:46:06] Parker Conrad: we hire it's a profile that we look for you know rippling you know we sort of coined this phrase I
[00:46:16] Parker Conrad: know HubSpot HubSpot has been doing this for a long time but we coined this phrase of like
[00:46:19] Parker Conrad: compound software you know I'm really mad at you about this yeah because we are a compound star
[00:46:24] Unknown Host: but we never came up with a clever name for you it had totally stuck yeah and everyone's like yeah
[00:46:31] Unknown Host: Parker's the original like we're the original HubSpot was doing it long before us well done
[00:46:38] Parker Conrad: but we the reason that we we do this is because I'm convinced that this is the right way to build
[00:46:44] Parker Conrad: software and that actually we've been building software wrong yeah for a couple of decades now
[00:46:49] Parker Conrad: and most people believe yeah yeah you're doing compound software there's some like sales and marketing
[00:46:53] Parker Conrad: advantages to building you know good enough but integrated products and like that's not it at all
[00:47:00] Parker Conrad: like I think the belief is that actually you can build better products by building them in this
[00:47:07] Parker Conrad: integrated way and you can do it because the fact that these things are deeply integrated and
[00:47:12] Parker Conrad: seamlessly interoperable on its own makes them better but also when you're building across like
[00:47:18] Parker Conrad: multiple applications you can afford to invest much more deeply in a set of capabilities that
[00:47:24] Parker Conrad: are common to all of the applications you know things like analytics and permissions and workflows
[00:47:29] Parker Conrad: and custom objects and stuff like that but I think a lot of you know and this was sort of the
[00:47:34] Parker Conrad: original like before we were this articulate about what we were doing and why it was one of the
[00:47:39] Parker Conrad: original founding principles of Ripley and was that we were going to do more things not less
[00:47:44] Parker Conrad: so yeah this focused thing was bullshit and like you know that was like what David wanted us to do
[00:47:50] Parker Conrad: with us completely wrong and we should do it this way and and so a lot of same with HubSpot
[00:47:54] Unknown Host: we're like this whole focus thing like you should do one thing really well we're like nope we're
[00:47:58] Unknown Host: going to be very thin and but we're going to get to table stakes at some point it was exact same
[00:48:03] Unknown Host: thesis we had yeah so yeah but a lot of the history of the company is trying to figure out novel
[00:48:10] Parker Conrad: solutions for the very real challenges with that approach yes there are a lot of reasons why
[00:48:16] Parker Conrad: it is easier to focus on one thing along the way a lot of problems come up and they're bottlenecks
[00:48:22] Parker Conrad: that develop in different parts of the organization and one of the places that you know a bottleneck
[00:48:29] Parker Conrad: forms is really at the level of sort of executive attention around these things and so you end up
[00:48:36] Parker Conrad: you end up needing people who can be like the CEO of these products yeah or who can drive things
[00:48:43] Parker Conrad: forward who can find a path because a lot of people who are like very good managers and executives
[00:48:50] Parker Conrad: in engineering or product or whatever what what they do is they they come to you with problems
[00:48:58] Parker Conrad: and so they say there's a series of gaps we have like in order to win here's like a long list of
[00:49:03] Parker Conrad: things we need to do and they unroll the list and it rolls out onto the floor and goes all the way
[00:49:08] Parker Conrad: down the hallway you know and and like we've prioritized it by sort of most important on on down
[00:49:17] Parker Conrad: and I have a team of this size and this is about one-quarters worth of work is like you know these
[00:49:23] Parker Conrad: things this far down the list and so we're going to do one-quarters worth of work and we're going to
[00:49:28] Parker Conrad: solve these things and and and that's what it is and the problem is is like yeah but the list
[00:49:34] Parker Conrad: goes all the way down the hallway and and they're like well but my job is to sort of you know
[00:49:39] Parker Conrad: that's your problem right yeah you're like and so they're asking you to find a way to make ends
[00:49:44] Parker Conrad: meet because you know they're like their job is just to kind of move down the list and and then
[00:49:50] Parker Conrad: you're you're still fucked because like at the end of the day they're going to do those things
[00:49:55] Parker Conrad: but you're still not you still haven't solved the problem which is like you need to win
[00:49:59] Parker Conrad: and so you need people who can find ways to do the impossible that sort of understand look
[00:50:07] Parker Conrad: like the CEO that's asking you to do unreasonable things like I didn't create this situation like
[00:50:14] Parker Conrad: the market created that like this is the reality that we find ourselves in which is like we need to
[00:50:20] Parker Conrad: do these things and if we don't we're dead we're screwed and so we need to find some way or
[00:50:26] Parker Conrad: some alternate path or some sort of you know there needs to be some effort to solve the whole
[00:50:31] Parker Conrad: problem or like it doesn't matter you know then you think X founders are particularly good
[00:50:39] Unknown Host: founders like understand breaking the laws of physics or they just they've been in situations where
[00:50:47] Parker Conrad: they've they understand that like yeah like it's like we either you know they they've sat there
[00:50:52] Parker Conrad: and stared at the dwindling bank balance while you know while the sales isn't working and they're like
[00:50:58] Parker Conrad: oh shit and like and they understand that like yes it's absolutely true that like you know this
[00:51:04] Parker Conrad: is a reasonable set of expectations for the team this week this month this quarter this year
[00:51:11] Parker Conrad: and yet if we do the reasonable set of things we're dead yeah and and so like we can either give up
[00:51:17] Parker Conrad: or we can try and find a way to accomplish an unreasonable set of things how do you manage them
[00:51:23] Unknown Host: though founders are typically a little unruly want a crap ton of autonomy often don't play with
[00:51:30] Unknown Host: that well with others like how do you manage the chaos I don't know if I found that to be the
[00:51:36] Parker Conrad: because like you know if you're if you've started a company I mean look there's all kinds of people
[00:51:41] Parker Conrad: but like you know man like you've got to convince a bunch of people to work for you you know that
[00:51:47] you know when it doesn't make any sense you know and like there's a certain amount of
[00:51:54] Parker Conrad: charisma or interpersonal skills that you've had to like develop like even if you didn't have it
[00:51:59] Parker Conrad: I think that that most people are more well socialized than that but they're always I guess
[00:52:05] Parker Conrad: exceptions and and we do people a lot of autonomy because like the best thing in the world for me
[00:52:10] Parker Conrad: is someone who can run with something you know and and and sort of take it off my plate like that's
[00:52:17] Parker Conrad: that's ideal so everyone everyone's aligned yeah on there being that kind of autonomy just switching
[00:52:23] Unknown Host: gears briefly um deal your main competitor been a lot of drama around it do you want to talk about it
[00:52:35] sure weirdly I would say deal is a competitor but probably not the main one um you know the
[00:52:42] Parker Conrad: the companies you got a lot of them yeah there's a lot of you know if I was like who's our main
[00:52:46] Parker Conrad: competitor I would be like man you know in payroll it's probably
[00:52:52] paycom, paylocity, ADP you know workday for HCM maybe you know gusto down market you know we come
[00:53:02] Parker Conrad: against deal in specifically this sort of global part of the business where you're I need to hire
[00:53:08] Parker Conrad: someone in xyz country and I have like one or two people that I'm hiring there and I don't know
[00:53:14] Parker Conrad: anything about it need some help but like that's where we compete with them but um but we have
[00:53:19] you know much much stronger competition with these other companies it's just that this weird stuff
[00:53:28] Parker Conrad: happened yeah with with them tell me about it so when was the first inkling you had that there was
[00:53:37] Unknown Host: a spy that that someone was spying on someone from deal with spying on your company the weird thing
[00:53:42] Unknown Host: about spy is like spy makes it sound it's great it's a podcast sort of sexy and that's the idea
[00:53:48] Parker Conrad: part for podcast crap but I think it's really like it's not that deal with spious that they were
[00:53:53] Parker Conrad: stealing and it was it was just theft pure and worse from the CEO of the company yeah it's worse
[00:54:00] Parker Conrad: and the the thing that happened is we got a reporter who was writing a story sent us a bunch of
[00:54:07] Parker Conrad: rippling internal slack messages that you know many of which were sort of cropped in sort of like
[00:54:13] Parker Conrad: unflattering ways and taken out of context and was like asking for our comment on it and just
[00:54:18] Parker Conrad: you know because of the context it was it was very clear for a bunch of reasons when you thought about
[00:54:23] Parker Conrad: it that the only place that this could have come from like it had to have been deal like no one
[00:54:28] Parker Conrad: else would have sort of known to send this stuff to that reporter and so the implication was the
[00:54:33] Parker Conrad: deal had you know full access to our slack and then from there you know we so we sort of knew
[00:54:41] Parker Conrad: what was going on immediately but even before that did you have an inkling like in some territory
[00:54:45] Unknown Host: that they were winning an unusual number of deals and like how are they doing it was there an inkling
[00:54:50] Unknown Host: before that they're really you know once you started looking you know there were these examples
[00:54:57] Parker Conrad: yeah there were like when the story came out you know there were customers that wrote into us and
[00:55:02] Parker Conrad: ex-former customers you know that that wrote into us and there was there was a there was a guy that
[00:55:06] Parker Conrad: was a former deal customer that took a demo with rippling and was talking with us came to us
[00:55:13] Parker Conrad: because he wanted to switch and he spoke with a rippling account executive and within hours he got
[00:55:20] Parker Conrad: a WhatsApp message from Alex Boosys this CEO of deal you know who you know never have for sure
[00:55:27] Parker Conrad: there was like hey I hear you're like you know looking at other stuff like you know let's try
[00:55:30] Parker Conrad: and find a way to get you you know like seems like an awful big coincidence and he emailed at the time
[00:55:35] Parker Conrad: and this was before we knew anything was going on he emailed his rep he was like whoa this is super
[00:55:40] Parker Conrad: weird like this freak the hell out of me like I was you know how did how to deal know that like you
[00:55:46] Parker Conrad: know and of course the rep thought nothing of it so it didn't go anywhere right until later you look
[00:55:51] Parker Conrad: back and you're like oh yeah you can actually trace the person who's a rippling employee that deal
[00:55:56] Parker Conrad: started paying to send them all of this internal steel rippling internal data including mostly like
[00:56:05] Parker Conrad: CRM data just like every opportunity we were working every customer we were talking to the
[00:56:12] Parker Conrad: pricing we were offering now the objections they had you know it's just every single day
[00:56:19] Parker Conrad: just sending all of it directly to Alex disease do you think Alex and crew
[00:56:25] Unknown Host: targeted someone or took an employee and got them to work for you or there was somebody
[00:56:31] Unknown Host: working for you that they got to you that a lot they collected somebody and you know the thing is
[00:56:36] Parker Conrad: that hasn't been talked about a lot is it it really seems like it was you know wasn't wasn't just us
[00:56:44] Parker Conrad: there are a bunch of other companies so you know there was that they were doing it too or in the
[00:56:49] Unknown Host: industry writ large is a lot of this going no no that that deal was doing this I say you know
[00:56:54] like we were not the only ones yep and and that it was a defined play yeah this was I I think I
[00:57:02] Parker Conrad: believe that this that company was built on this foundation of theft from competitors and that
[00:57:10] Parker Conrad: that was like a critical component of what they're doing and so you know one of the things that we
[00:57:16] Parker Conrad: decided to do is we decided to be extremely public about this and come forward even before that
[00:57:23] Unknown Host: so you get this thing from your press guy like they have to have access to our slack yeah and then
[00:57:30] Unknown Host: you ran a honey pot operation to kind of prove what you thought you just talk about that meeting
[00:57:36] Unknown Host: and what was going on can you just give us a glimpse behind the scenes of what happened in that
[00:57:42] Unknown Host: meeting well so actually first before that okay what happened is we needed to figure out like who
[00:57:49] Parker Conrad: was doing this yeah and I my assumption was that this was probably a former employee that left
[00:57:59] Parker Conrad: you know because sometimes people leave one company they go to another yep and sometimes
[00:58:02] Parker Conrad: people like you shouldn't do this it's wrong it's legal but sometimes it happens that people take
[00:58:07] Parker Conrad: some stuff on the way out yep and so I was like maybe there's someone who kind of like you know
[00:58:13] Parker Conrad: did did their new employer a favor on the way and sort of unethically yeah instead of you know
[00:58:19] Parker Conrad: what what we would do in a situation like that as we would say whoa whoa whoa like don't you know
[00:58:23] Parker Conrad: delete that we don't want you know and unethically they said goody you know like great and then what
[00:58:29] Parker Conrad: we did is you know the the sort of light signature of the behavior that really popped up was the
[00:58:37] Parker Conrad: search history in slack like what you know there were certain searches that this person had to have
[00:58:42] Parker Conrad: been doing so he did you invite your IT guy in like how how did it well so this is the crazy thing
[00:58:47] Parker Conrad: is the search logs in slack are not visible to slack clients oh he pingsail for it and so and in fact
[00:58:56] Parker Conrad: like cynically I think they were doing it in this way precisely to avoid detection as they were
[00:59:02] Parker Conrad: doing searches and then getting things from not joining the channels but getting things from the
[00:59:06] Parker Conrad: preview from the search from the actual searches and so really the only way we were able to do this
[00:59:12] Parker Conrad: is we got introduced to some like very senior people at Salesforce who like to their credit you know
[00:59:19] Parker Conrad: sort of agreed to help us track this down and they they pulled from their own internal logs
[00:59:25] Parker Conrad: what the search history was and it was very clear exactly who the person was and that person
[00:59:29] Parker Conrad: was still an active rippling employee who is the one who came up with the idea to look at that
[00:59:34] Unknown Host: particular thing to look at the searches yes I can't even remember but it was so obvious it was like
[00:59:41] Unknown Host: you called a meeting of a bunch of smart people like how are we going to catch him it was like I mean
[00:59:45] Parker Conrad: it was a very small team it was like you know it was like you know me my general counsel like
[00:59:51] Parker Conrad: you know the deputy GC you know it was like a couple it was like two or three people on legal two or
[00:59:56] Parker Conrad: three people in security and it was like hey we're gonna catch him you know to get this in the slacks
[01:00:02] Parker Conrad: that we saw they must have done these searches to get you know so yeah we and these are weird
[01:00:08] Parker Conrad: searches like someone and so we've got to be able to find this and so then we we clearly there's one
[01:00:13] Parker Conrad: person that was like doing this and it was very clear who it was the big kind of insight was like
[01:00:18] Parker Conrad: well look it's actually because we were thinking like is there something that we could do where we could
[01:00:24] Parker Conrad: put something in slack you know like maybe like put like a fake customer in Salesforce with a phone
[01:00:30] Parker Conrad: number that like goes to our law firm put that in slack and like see if a deal sales rep calls that
[01:00:36] Parker Conrad: phone number you know and like kind of train you like that way it was just it was too hard to sort of
[01:00:41] Parker Conrad: know like because we it was too hard to see what deal would be doing with it and so the insight
[01:00:48] Parker Conrad: was realizing that you could flip it around and you could actually the thing that we could see was
[01:00:54] Parker Conrad: the searches and so we could see what this guy was searching for and so we had to do it the other way
[01:01:00] Parker Conrad: we had to give some information to deal and see this guy searched for how did you get the information
[01:01:07] Parker Conrad: to deal so you know look a lot of companies that are in competing spaces have some somewhat regular
[01:01:15] Parker Conrad: exchange of like legal letters where you know for whatever reason you know they send you a letter
[01:01:22] Parker Conrad: and they're like we're angry that this person joined and yeah make sure that they're you know
[01:01:26] Parker Conrad: or that's person recruited someone they were as yes recruiting you know and so this is a sort
[01:01:30] Parker Conrad: of fairly formed there's a sort of low level of that that was kind of happening and so there
[01:01:34] Parker Conrad: happened to have been a letter that they had sent us about something or other related to a deal
[01:01:40] Parker Conrad: employee that had joined Ripley and that we had you know sort of I think at the time I had
[01:01:44] Parker Conrad: decided we're not even going to bother responding to this but we suddenly said well let's respond
[01:01:49] Parker Conrad: to it and when we respond to it and we said okay we decided to put together like a screenshot
[01:01:56] Parker Conrad: of a Slack message that was like basically like a fake Slack message although to make sure that
[01:02:03] Parker Conrad: it wasn't actually fake we actually had someone send that Slack message so we could we could be
[01:02:09] Parker Conrad: like no it was a real Slack message but but we put this thing together and the Slack message
[01:02:14] Parker Conrad: what's actually the funniest part of this is that initially this was designed by the legal team
[01:02:20] Parker Conrad: and man the Slack message was so boring yeah it was like no one would have carried it was so
[01:02:25] Parker Conrad: uninteresting yeah and so and this was a very you know closed circle like you weren't allowed to tell
[01:02:31] Parker Conrad: anyone about what was going on and so I called up our former CMO who was like that he had moved
[01:02:40] Parker Conrad: into a new role at Ripley but he was like one of the things about him that's so amazing is he's
[01:02:45] Parker Conrad: like just great at writing coming up with like cold email messages and so he was always the guy
[01:02:51] Parker Conrad: went to when we needed like a new cold email to send people that was good and so I called up
[01:02:57] Parker Conrad: Mepstein and I said Mepstein we need you to write a cold email that's gonna have a 100% S1 to S2
[01:03:05] Parker Conrad: conversion right that like like definitely someone's gonna have to click on this yeah and he came
[01:03:10] Parker Conrad: up with the actual thing it was this message that sort of suggested that there was this channel
[01:03:16] Parker Conrad: in Ripley and Slack called de-defectors where ex-deal employees were talking about deal maybe in ways
[01:03:22] Parker Conrad: that were unflattering and there were you know we sent them the message and then just for added
[01:03:26] Parker Conrad: sort of theatrical effect we like blacked out like parts of it you know there's be like really
[01:03:33] Parker Conrad: like what are the blacked out parts of it and and it was included in this letter that we sent to
[01:03:39] Parker Conrad: their CFO who is you know the CEO's father and their outside counsel and their head of legal the
[01:03:50] Parker Conrad: per those that sort of person's style so there's only three people one of them you know presumably
[01:03:54] Parker Conrad: it's not the outside counsel and then the other two are quite see or within the company and we
[01:03:59] sent them this letter you know at like I think it was like 8 p.m. and then we waited and I remember
[01:04:05] Parker Conrad: waking up at like four in the morning and checking my slack and and there was just all these messages
[01:04:11] Parker Conrad: it was like holy shit they did it and we were getting somebody was searching on that channel he was
[01:04:17] Unknown Host: searching and going in you know this they're going into this channel and like you know it's a we
[01:04:22] Parker Conrad: was purposefully a weird search term and yes never been searched before we checked you know it was
[01:04:27] Parker Conrad: not a real channel you know it's there's only one way that this could have happened okay now you
[01:04:31] Parker Conrad: know who it is your month and a half searches over them what happened well then you know who approached
[01:04:38] Parker Conrad: them so this the the employee was was based in Ireland yes and Ireland has the Irish legal system
[01:04:48] Parker Conrad: has an extraordinary form of relief in civil litigation that allows you to file an ex-parte process
[01:04:55] Parker Conrad: so basically you can you don't have to alert the other side you can go to court and get without
[01:05:00] Parker Conrad: the other side being aware of it an order from the court that's effectively sort of like a warrant
[01:05:06] Parker Conrad: you know in the US legal system that exists in like a criminal case but not in civil litigation
[01:05:12] Parker Conrad: um and so we we were able to get this because of the sort of strength of the evidence
[01:05:18] Parker Conrad: that sort of there was a court order to get access to this guy's phone and and so there was a court
[01:05:23] Parker Conrad: officer that came to police officer ish person I don't know the police officer would court officer
[01:05:31] Parker Conrad: was like a solicitor is the uniform I actually don't know but but in in in the Irish legal system
[01:05:37] Parker Conrad: there are solicitors and barristers and you know and so you may be more like a lawyer
[01:05:42] Parker Conrad: with wearing a white wig or man I don't even know now I'm gonna let that up but anyway you know
[01:05:49] Parker Conrad: showed up at the office met this guy was take you know sort of you know the win into a room for a
[01:05:54] Parker Conrad: meeting and there was this team arrayed with you know sort of forensic IT people the sort of officer
[01:06:00] Parker Conrad: of the court said look I've got this order for your phone and um he uh sort of said I don't have
[01:06:06] Parker Conrad: my phone with me I need to go get it that turned out not to be true um and then he sort of while he
[01:06:13] Parker Conrad: was like going to get it kind of ran into a bathroom and locked himself in the bathroom
[01:06:18] in what we later learned is that in the bathroom he did a factory reset on his phone tried to
[01:06:22] Parker Conrad: flush it down the toilet and then came out of the the bathroom and you know the the court officer
[01:06:27] Parker Conrad: was telling him look you're violating the court order there's you know there's something you can
[01:06:31] Parker Conrad: be a prison for and he ran out of the building and took off yep and then you know over the next sort
[01:06:39] Parker Conrad: of 10 to 12 days there was this sort of bat sort of ongoing legal process to try and get you know
[01:06:46] Parker Conrad: sort of like real like police enforcement of this to get this guy to get a lawyer to sort of and
[01:06:53] Parker Conrad: you know get like contempt charges filed and eventually what happened is is he um you know sort of
[01:07:02] Parker Conrad: facing you know sort of these legal consequences he eventually sort of like turned and sort of
[01:07:09] Parker Conrad: started cooperating up and said that he had destroyed his phone but he also um he told us and this
[01:07:15] Parker Conrad: is all you know in the sort of the sort of court proceedings and the affidavit that he produced but
[01:07:20] Parker Conrad: according to these proceedings you know allegedly what happened is that he immediately after he left
[01:07:27] Parker Conrad: our office he got uh called Alex the CEO of DL told him what had happened Alex said someone
[01:07:35] Parker Conrad: would reach out to him you know allegedly and and and then two attorneys at DL like a stab like
[01:07:43] Parker Conrad: employees of DL who were attorneys called him back and they they told him to destroy his phone
[01:07:50] Parker Conrad: which is like if you're that's a that's a bad thing for anyone but it's really bad for attorneys
[01:07:55] Parker Conrad: to be to be saying that um told him destroy his phone get a new burner phone um call them back
[01:08:04] Parker Conrad: delete all of his accounts and they offered to relocate him and his family to Dubai um and get him out
[01:08:10] Parker Conrad: of the country to buy his no extradition you know like not a lot of extradition options so one of
[01:08:18] Parker Conrad: those lawyers by the way who was based in the UK practice law in the UK has since relocated to
[01:08:24] Parker Conrad: Dubai himself I see this all came out and so there was and this so there was this crazy thing where
[01:08:29] Parker Conrad: he detailed you know like the the person who's doing this detailed because everything that happened
[01:08:34] Parker Conrad: and how he was recruited by the CEO directly and sent all of this information to the CEO and was
[01:08:40] Parker Conrad: paid how he was paid um and and all you know sort of all of the stuff do you think this is going on
[01:08:48] Unknown Host: a lot in tech I don't think it's going on a lot and uh look I think the reason that we really
[01:08:55] Parker Conrad: came forward with this yeah you went very public you know obviously there's a reason for rippling
[01:09:00] Parker Conrad: that you know for the business we defend the business but you know more importantly I do think that
[01:09:05] Parker Conrad: if deal sort of moves forward like in a way that's unscathed there is this risk that the over-tun
[01:09:14] Parker Conrad: window shifts and that this becomes a norm you know that it's sort of like ah you know yeah
[01:09:21] Parker Conrad: your competitor paid someone to steal your CRM data if you can't stand the heat get out of the
[01:09:27] Parker Conrad: kitchen yeah you got to be doing the same thing and everyone is at a precedent and everyone's
[01:09:31] Parker Conrad: got to have an espionage team and a counter esp team and and and I just don't think that that's the
[01:09:37] Parker Conrad: that's not the way I want the world to work and one of the things that's actually there's a lot
[01:09:43] Parker Conrad: of crazy things about the story but one of the things that's that's I think is the craziest to me
[01:09:47] Parker Conrad: is that you know a deals largest investor and recent hero it's has a very clear but they've
[01:09:55] Parker Conrad: made it very clear that they it they do not care like it does not they are totally fine with
[01:10:06] what what happened here and they're going to continue to back these guys presumably because
[01:10:12] Parker Conrad: you know they have three billion reasons to do so if you're making enough money
[01:10:18] Parker Conrad: it doesn't matter how you got there or what you did or the rules that you broke or the lines
[01:10:26] Parker Conrad: that you crossed or the ethics that you transgressed if if it worked and you got away with it and so
[01:10:32] Parker Conrad: you know their the board seems like they're not going to hold them accountable and so we felt like
[01:10:38] Parker Conrad: we kind of had to do something appreciate that by the way um you've had a lot of drama
[01:10:45] Unknown Host: uh if the movie is made which I think it should be who would you like to play you
[01:10:54] Unknown Host: and who would you like to play Mark Andreessen oh man I will or Ben Horowitz I love it if there's
[01:11:01] Parker Conrad: a movie that gets made hopefully the movie is about deal and I am sort of a minor character
[01:11:06] Parker Conrad: no I think the better movie would be your arc and all the interesting stuff that's happened around
[01:11:11] Unknown Host: you who plays Parker man I don't know that's a good question someone someone hopefully
[01:11:18] Parker Conrad: someone extremely good looking we can we can we can maybe have like some slight departures from
[01:11:25] Parker Conrad: from reality since it's a movie so uh and and and you mean playing Mark Andreessen and replicating that
[01:11:32] Unknown Host: nugget of his gonna be tricky yeah for short uh John Luke Picard like can we trick it oh yeah
[01:11:38] Unknown Host: that's a great one that's a good idea okay anything else you want to tell the audience any other
[01:11:44] Unknown Host: advice you would give to founders and people who want to go from four people to 40 to 400 to
[01:11:50] Unknown Host: 4000 and 40 thousand someday I think like everyone kind of needs to find their own path through this
[01:11:56] Parker Conrad: stuff it's one of things that's that's kind of hardest like I don't I don't really think that
[01:12:00] Parker Conrad: there are a lot of recipes and recipes and so um you know it's why um I probably have like a lot
[01:12:08] Parker Conrad: more you know I there was a point in my life when I was like very angry at investors and and I
[01:12:15] Parker Conrad: think I've sort of sort of reached some point where I actually have a lot of empathy for investors
[01:12:20] Parker Conrad: and like how hard it is to be in in their position and and how impossible the job is um and uh
[01:12:28] Parker Conrad: because I think it's really hard you know even if you have a lot of experience yourself
[01:12:32] Parker Conrad: you know there like people all find their own paths and the things changed like Ripley was like a
[01:12:39] Parker Conrad: business that was like so close to what we were building at Zenefits like it wasn't was the same
[01:12:46] Parker Conrad: industry slight slightly tinkered with kind of the the sort of principle kind of the foundational
[01:12:53] Parker Conrad: principles of sort of what we were building but like the world was like like four years into the
[01:13:01] Parker Conrad: future from when I had started Zenefits and that one thing like changed everything it was like
[01:13:07] Parker Conrad: you know all of the things that you know or many of the things that had worked for us at Zenefits
[01:13:12] Parker Conrad: didn't work at Ripley and and like you know just like like everything was different because of a few
[01:13:17] Parker Conrad: changes to the starting assumptions and it really sort of made me realize why so much of the advice
[01:13:24] Parker Conrad: that people give out about how to do this is so useless because everyone is fighting yesterday's war
[01:13:32] Parker Conrad: you know from their own experience and like things are very different you know things have changed
[01:13:37] Parker Conrad: just because of the slow advance of time if not because this is a completely different business
[01:13:42] Parker Conrad: and a completely different a different industry with a totally different set of people um so it's
[01:13:47] Parker Conrad: it's a real struggle um and it it's probably one of the reasons why I'm like man it sucks if you
[01:13:53] Parker Conrad: have any other any other thing that you can go do like maybe that's the right thing to do instead
[01:13:58] Parker Conrad: of instead of getting involved in this whole thing I appreciate you thank you on behalf of the
[01:14:03] Unknown Host: listeners you're an inspiration to many congrats on all your success congrats on your revenge chore
[01:14:09] well thank you very much appreciate you okay hope you like that interview with Parker I really liked it
[01:14:15] Unknown Host: he's a smart guy on hiring he's got a bunch of cool ideas uh some of which I'm definitely going to
[01:14:20] Unknown Host: borrow I like his idea that if he's got a candidate that's coming to meet him he sends them an
[01:14:26] Unknown Host: old board deck or his investor memo let's them read it and he spends like the first half of the
[01:14:32] Unknown Host: interview just talking about that in the reaction of the candidate to that memo and the ideas they
[01:14:37] Unknown Host: come up with really says a lot about them I love that he does that he relies a lot on on reference
[01:14:44] Unknown Host: checks he does something interesting there he asked the candidate to give him six references
[01:14:49] Unknown Host: which is kind of a lot and he only calls two he's trying to figure out if they have six references
[01:14:55] Unknown Host: but then he leans much more heavily on the blind references and this is something I did as well
[01:15:00] Unknown Host: I would say 60% of my decision criteria was around the third party references of people
[01:15:06] Unknown Host: used to work for them so I thought that was interesting this is something we didn't do in HubSpot
[01:15:10] Unknown Host: but I really liked how he hires a lot of ex-founders and he talked about how ex-founders are used to
[01:15:19] Unknown Host: breaking the laws of physics they're used to just really tight constraints and having to really
[01:15:24] Unknown Host: do hard things and so he has to sprinkle to write his award and he's had a lot of success with them
[01:15:29] Unknown Host: he likes his senior team to be a mix of homegrown talent and been there done that talent and this
[01:15:36] Unknown Host: is pretty consistent across most of the CEOs I interviewed and I feel like it's a little bit of
[01:15:41] Unknown Host: conventional wisdom and skill upland that you just hire a bunch of been there done that people
[01:15:47] I'm not sure that's right a lot of HubSpot's team over the years was 50% homegrown at 50%
[01:15:52] Unknown Host: been there done that and that mix I think is just about right I took some things away from on pace
[01:15:59] Unknown Host: he's at 4,000 people a lot of companies slow down when you hit 4,000 people he seems to be keeping
[01:16:06] Unknown Host: the pace up and he does a few things that I think are smart and a lot of the CEOs they interview do
[01:16:12] Unknown Host: a couple of these things first he really tries to stay on the coal face with the customer and he's
[01:16:18] Unknown Host: one of the most active users of rippling the product he runs payroll for all 4,000 employees
[01:16:23] Unknown Host: and rippling he's very close to the customer experience through that he sees on the coal face with
[01:16:28] Unknown Host: the employees too he sits right inside the engineering organization where you can see what's going
[01:16:33] Unknown Host: on here what's going on and he talked about the CEOs sets the pace CEOs slows down the workflows
[01:16:39] Unknown Host: CEOs speeds up the org speeds up one of my big takeaways on Parker is he doesn't have a chip on
[01:16:45] Unknown Host: the shoulder he's got a boulder on his shoulder and that boulder really drives him he calls it his
[01:16:52] Unknown Host: revenge tour the whole company I think this is pretty common among some of the best CEOs and can
[01:16:57] Unknown Host: be a real motivator and in his case David sacks put a boulder on the shoulder I have a chip on my
[01:17:03] Unknown Host: shoulder and I had an old boss put it there I had a guy work for for a decade when I went to
[01:17:08] Unknown Host: resign he said you'll be nothing without me and this is like 30 years ago and I still remember it
[01:17:14] Unknown Host: and if I really want to get fired up I think about the day I resigned from that company so boulder
[01:17:19] Unknown Host: on the shoulder super useful channel it I think it can be really useful for you my last thought on
[01:17:26] Unknown Host: Parker and about scale up startup land writ large I meet with lots and lots of founders these days
[01:17:32] Unknown Host: there's a new breed of founder I call five tool founders now a great baseball player can hit
[01:17:38] Unknown Host: can hit with power can catch can run and throw all in an elite level and I'm noticing a new breed of
[01:17:45] Unknown Host: founder who was kind of like that and I think Parker's one of them I think Brett from Sierra's one
[01:17:52] Unknown Host: of them my T from 11 labs gave from rogo dara from delfai where they're very good at coding they're
[01:18:00] Unknown Host: very good at design they have vision they can recruit and they can sell those are all five tools
[01:18:07] Unknown Host: that they have in their back and I'm noticing more more of them and if you're one of those founders
[01:18:13] Unknown Host: as deeply technical like them but can't quite storytell and sell I would work on that and get some
[01:18:19] Unknown Host: coaching on that and get some feedback on it because those five tool players are worth their
[01:18:24] Unknown Host: weight and gold and if you can be a five tool player that really opens up a lot of doors for you
[01:18:29] Unknown Host: okay those are my thoughts lots of takeaways from Parker I'll see you on the next episode
