[00:00:00] We were born 40 some odd years ago, right in the era of DOS.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: And right, which makes it even more impressive how well you guys are done.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_00: And I would just say our successes when we were always in love with the customer
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: problem and always willing to disrupt ourselves.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: And that's so much easier said than done.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: By the way, so much easier said than done.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_00: But that's why we're still around.
[00:00:30] Hey, welcome to the pod.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_01: Today we have Sassan, the CEO of Intuit.
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_01: I'm known in like Sassan for a very long time.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_01: And I've known in like Intuit for a very long time.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_01: They're an interesting company that been around for many, many decades in a bit
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: of a contrarian space selling into very small businesses.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: And they've scaled to 180 billion market cap.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_01: So there's a lot to learn from these guys.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_01: And I'm excited to dig in.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_01: I've actually met three different Intuit CEOs.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_01: And I work with tons of CEOs in my daily life.
[00:01:11] These are grownups.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_01: And I think there's something to be learned from grownups.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_01: And we're going to dig into some grown up topics.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_01: We dig into what is a grown up CEO operating system look like?
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: What is Sassan's hiring criteria, which I did not expect.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's pretty interesting.
[00:01:28] How do you build an indirect channel?
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_01: Most of the quick books revenue comes through an accounting channel
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: that they build that's fascinating.
[00:01:36] We talked about second acts and third acts and platforms.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: One of my favorite topics and something they're very, very good at.
[00:01:42] And then we talk about SMB.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: There are very few companies that have built with any scale in the SMB segment of the market.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_01: I hope you come back and we chat again after the interview.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_01: Just have a lot of takes on it.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_01: See you on the other side.
[00:01:57] So it's not great to see you.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_01: Very good to see you, man.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_00: It's been a long time.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_00: I know. I miss you.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: You look great.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_01: YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_01: So I came on the campus today and it reminded me the first time I visited the Intuit campus,
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_01: which was in 2010.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_01: HubSpot was four years old.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_01: And my co-founder and I were coming to visit Scott Cook and your CEO.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_01: And we were just sitting in the lobby.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_01: And I just remember I wanted to throw up on myself.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_01: I was so nervous because we were a little tiny company.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: We were really looked up to you.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_01: And we met with you guys and we had a really good meeting.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_01: And you guys gave us a lot of insight.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: At the end of the meeting, I was kind of taken with Brad Smith, your CEO.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_01: And I said, is there any chance you'd let me shadow you for a day?
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: And he said, sure, come on.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_01: I'm back any time, which I was delighted.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_01: And so about a month later, it came back because that in the lobby,
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_01: I wanted to throw up on myself because I was so nervous.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: And I shadowed Brad Smith, the legend.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: And it was a fascinating day.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_01: I learned a lot.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: He brought me to executive leadership committee meeting.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_01: All the executives in there.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: I saw how he ran it.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: It was really good founders in there.
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_01: Just went through the whole day with them lunch, everything.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_01: The most interesting meeting was he had a performance review of someone.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_01: And you were in the room and it was kind of a tough performance review.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_01: Oh, wow.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_01: And he's like, nope, you're going to stay in the room.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: So I was in the room in this guy.
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I guess all of the pluses and minuses.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_01: So that's when I think back to it, I learned so much from Brad and so much from you guys.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_01: And there's so much into it inside of HubSpot.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_01: But we're not here to talk about me.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_01: We're here to talk about you.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: You're becoming a legend running into it doing so well.
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_01: Tell me about when you first took the job.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_01: You took the job over from Brad.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: The building is named after Brad.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_01: What was that like?
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_01: So 2018, Brad Smith's done a great job is stepping down.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_01: They're looking for a new CEO.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_01: There's this was it at all like the show succession.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: That's a good one.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: So you know, I did something very much like, I'm just, I'm curious.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: And I'm always out learning from, from customers from our product teams and, and external leaders.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: So one of the things I did, but I would just say more like an event.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: When I was announced is I went out and talked to 15, 20 folks that if I were to name them,
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: you would know all of them.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_00: And, and it was really to get advice.
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: But, but the one person that comes to mind is given your question with Steve Young.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: So quarterback of the 49ers, hella famer.
[00:04:19] I went and met him and, and it's a let he's a legend.
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_00: And the reason I went to meet him is he had to step in, you know, behind big shoes.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: Joe Montana, right?
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_00: It was the most unforgettable meeting because he actually took me through the journey of when he became
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: quarterback.
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: I think it was when Joe Montana got hurt.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: And long story short, he said, listen, I was getting booed.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_00: People were like, bring Joe back and we were having a tough time.
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: And, and he said I was on a plane ride back with someone famous that I won't name
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: here because he asked me not to ever name them.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: And as the person said, oh, here, Steve Young.
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_00: And he was said I was pouting and telling him how pissed off I was because I had taken a
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: couple of day break.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: And the person said, you have been chosen as the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_00: You are not here to fill Joe Montana shoes.
[00:05:14] You are here to win.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: They picked you as the quarterback.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_00: So he said, go be the best that you can be.
[00:05:23] And don't try to follow Joe Montana.
[00:05:27] And he said that conversation changed him.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: After that conversation, if you look at when he had the conversation and then his trajectory
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: and then the 49ers, it completely changed.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: Did someone have that conversation with you?
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_01: That's the advice he gave me.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_01: It does seem like there's the seat.
[00:05:43] You old CEO play playbook seems to be changing like Jensen Huang is doing all kinds
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_01: of interesting things.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_01: The whole founder mode thing.
[00:05:52] What are the non obvious things that really work for you and the job that maybe
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_01: not be part of the normal playbook?
[00:06:00] Well, first of all, you're right.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: I think there is no playbook and it changes on a monthly basis.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: So if you try to stick to a playbook, you could be in trouble.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: The couple of things that have always kept me grounded is the main theme is just
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_00: curiosity.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: So I spend a lot of time with customers.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_00: They always keep me grounded in terms of like, what's important?
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: What are they trying to do with their life?
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_00: What tools are they using?
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: Why are they using them?
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_00: So that's one, too.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: I spent a lot of time also doing a lot of CEOs.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: I just couldn't push back a bit every CEO does that these days.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: You should do it.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: But I use that as one element of always be grounded.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: The second is I spent a lot of time with our frontline engineers to try to understand
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: like what's getting in their way?
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: Are there dependencies that slows them down because of velocity is everything.
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: So I'm close to customers, close to our front lines because I think it was sitting
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: in our shoes.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: A lot of stuff gets filtered.
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_00: And so you have to be in touch with customers.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: You have to be in touch with frontline employees and you have to be in touch with
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: just your KPIs like what's working?
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: What's not?
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: So one is just helicopter skills.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_00: And no matter what is going on, that's one common thing that always grounds me.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: I called it speed-lunking kind of.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: You're up here and then we're down like, and you grow people crazy by the way,
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_01: but that's kind of how I do it.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: But by the way, I think every successful leader, you don't have to be a CEO.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: Every successful leader has to be, has to have a method in which they operate.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: You have to be grounded in the details.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: You have to be close to the details because if you just operate in the cloud and you
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_00: don't know what's going on with employees, customers, products and your KPIs,
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: then I don't think you're effective.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_00: So that's you asked about playbook.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: That's the common thing that always helps me be in love with the problem and how fast
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_00: the world is moving and not in love with what we've declared.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_00: I would say just second thing is I'm just big on principles and mechanisms.
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_00: Like what are the principles?
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: Principles aren't like, for instance, we have a mechanism in which we run the company,
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: but it's really how I spend my time.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: And just if even if I think about today, you know, in one meeting, we were talking about
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: things that are coming around the corner and haven't even been invented yet.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_00: I'm reconcilating what we should do to doing a product review, to reviewing our dashboard,
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_00: to meeting with a customer.
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_00: So mechanisms are just about how do we manage short and long?
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_00: How do we ensure that we're really monitoring the things that we said we're going to do
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: around product around, around go to market, but also mechanisms to invest
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: time with thought partners that are very comfortable telling me, hey, I don't think your
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: strategy is right.
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: I don't think what you're doing is right.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: Here's what I think you should be doing.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: So we have mechanisms in terms of how we run the company.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: A lot of those been around or those new or that's like into it in the, in the, you know,
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_01: in them.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_01: We changed it completely six years ago, but we've evolved them almost every year.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_00: There isn't just one, but this, I would say the three or four that I would call out is
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_00: we have a mechanism where the intent of the mechanism is question everything we've declared.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_00: And if today was day one, what would you do?
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_00: I love that.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: And that just keeps us grounded.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_00: It's the objective of the mechanism.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_00: So you don't go into that discussion with the senior team protecting what you're doing.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: You're actually in there to blow up what you're doing.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_00: I love that.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: The intent is outside in today's day one.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_00: You took over a CEO as a leadership team.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_00: What would you do?
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: That's a very important mechanism.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_00: And how often does that meeting or that contact that happens at least
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_00: once a year?
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: And I use the word at least because situationally if something is going on, we'll, we'll
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_00: impromptu have a conversation, which we've done twice in the last two years because of
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: luck going on.
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_01: All I going on.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_00: So that's, that's a very important one.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_00: The other one is when we actually review are deliverable.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: One of the, you talked about shadowing.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_00: I'm big on shadowing.
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: Oh, you are.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_00: And so I had the opportunity to shadow Andy Jassy at, at Amazon when I was the CIO and
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: he was running AWS.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_00: And there's a number of things that I learned from Amazon.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: One of them that we copied is what, what's called their input goal system.
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: And their input goals are really around like what are the big products go to market, technology
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: deliverable?
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_00: So you're, it's the biggest decisions, investments that you're making.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_00: And with success metrics, that's another mechanism I would call out.
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_00: It's really changed clarity of the inputs that we're focused on and how are we doing against
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_00: them?
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_00: And they expose where we have prioritization issues, resource allocation issues, talent
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: issues.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_01: I just found with HubSpot just on the input thing like gravity pulls you towards lagging indicators
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_01: and trying to keep the company on leading indicators is just hard.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_01: Hard.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_01: Which is why I love this mechanism.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_00: It's not just a mechanism.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_00: It's not just a meeting.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: It's a process around input goals.
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_00: I love that one.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_00: And the third one is we just, we, not only do I spend a lot of time with customers, but
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_00: we have a sort of a customer experience review mechanism where we're, we're really talking
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: about the experience, what's working, what's not.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_00: If I were to call out three and there's, there's more than three mechanisms, those are
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_00: the ones that I just think are, they're game changing for us.
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_00: The third one I like, like I called it the call face I wanted to get on the call face
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_01: and hear from the customers.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_01: So we had a customer at every company meeting.
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_01: Once a month we had a staff meeting, we would have customer panels of the staff meeting
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_01: in the most lively ones were the customers that had canceled.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: That was always the most ones.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_01: And then we just had our board meeting yesterday and we have a customer panel or our board meeting.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_01: Those are terrific.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: So similar to HubSpot trying to create mechanisms to keep the customer loud in our ears.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_01: That's right.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_01: And I love what you just said, which is, I think the most powerful situations in our lives
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: is when somebody is in a very authentic way challenging you.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_01: And you're giving them permission to challenge you.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_00: So as a customer, if it's interesting, we had a couple of customers that had left us
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_00: at our leadership conference in front of hundreds of our leaders and there were like, here's
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_00: why I left.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: Here's what you need to do differently.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_00: And I just think there's a lot of power when you learn from what you could have done differently
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_00: and I love what you all do at HubSpot.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_00: I just think it really brings to life a culture of learning and curiosity.
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_00: Yep.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_01: I think we got a lot of that from you, by the way.
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_01: I coach CEOs.
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_01: I get very consistent questions about certain things.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: And anyone who's starting a company and is a CEO targeting small, medium businesses finds
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_01: me.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_00: You guys are the world champions of SMB.
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_01: What's working so well there?
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_01: Why does so many start up to get it wrong and end up going up in the enterprise?
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_01: What is the magic to creating a company that really thrives in us and because very few?
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_01: You know, Brian, it's, first of all, I would say it's a magic that Scott Cook created
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: years ago that we've just been over the years building on.
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_00: And I think the first element of the magic is going to sound real obvious, but they're
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: actually consumers.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: They behave like consumers.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: They act like consumers.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: The minute you put the word, they're a business in front of it, then you start thinking
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_00: large business, large enterprise, and they behave and act like consumers.
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_00: And so the obsessive focus that you have to have on like what problem can you solve
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_00: for that business that doesn't have the infrastructure that Hubspot and Intuit has,
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_00: but there are two, three people shop.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_00: And they're like, how do you help them with the basics?
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: Like get a customer.
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_00: Know which ones are profitable, help them get paid, cash flow, like really narrow, narrow
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_00: problems to solve.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: It's really been the success of what Scott created and what we built in over the years.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_00: Is the follow me home thing that Scott invented?
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_01: Is that still a thing and into it?
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it is.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_00: And what we are coupling it with is a couple of things.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: One, there's follow me homes and then there's follow me homes.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_00: You can do a follow me home where you're telling the customer, here's what I'm doing,
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_00: and just you want confirmation bias.
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_00: And so we have to have a follow me home, which is a real technique and you're truly there
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_00: to observe, learn and try to capture the a-ha's, the surprises, because the big thing we've
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: learned is customer don't do what they say.
[00:14:15] Yeah.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: And so really we have continued investing like the technique of a follow me home.
[00:14:22] It's a thing, but it's not the biggest thing.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_00: Because before, before data, before we were in the cloud, it was the thing when we were
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_00: shipping CDs.
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_00: And that's coupled with data, right?
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: And in the world of cloud, you have so much data so you can real time understand and see
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: what's the customer behavior, what are they doing, why do they get stuck there, why do
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_00: they fall off.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_00: And so now we try to couple the two, but it is still a thing.
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: Our focus is how do you do the thing the right way?
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_00: Now, I spend a lot of time, it's quite capital.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_01: I spend a lot of time fundraising an HubSpot.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_01: Seeing who wrote is allergic to SMBs.
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_01: Any business SMB, they're allergic to it.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_01: Why do you think that is?
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_01: And why do you think more companies haven't pulled it off?
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_01: I think more companies are successful today serving businesses than they were before.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: You all are a great example of that.
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_00: Not a lot of examples of them, though.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: There's not too many.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: There's not too many.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_00: I think it's folks that really understand these are consumers and really focus on what's
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_00: that narrow problem that is big enough for the customer that you can go after and get
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: started.
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_00: And one that you actually can build advantage and one that they're willing to pay for.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_00: That sounds, well, of course, everybody needs to do that for any customer problem that
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_00: they solve.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: But I think most people treat small businesses like their large enterprises because they're
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_00: business and the reality is they are absolutely consumers that behave like this.
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_00: So I get, follow me home in data on that side.
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_01: Talk about just the go-to market and how do you keep the countdown?
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_01: And how do you keep churn from not running away on these small businesses?
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_01: Because the unit economics is, I think, something that where so many companies fall down
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_01: on small businesses.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: It's hard.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: I mean, how do you scale a CAC and get so many customers and then how do you control retention
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_01: and up like your gross retention revenue?
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: It's hard.
[00:16:12] Of course.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: Let me start there.
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_01: It's really, really hard.
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_00: On the CAC side.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_00: I would say two big things.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: One is referral and our partners in accountants.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_00: The better of a job that you do serving one business, the word of mouth is huge.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: The word of mouth is huge and then accountants recommending it.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_00: And accountants only recommend things that they use, love and recommend.
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_00: That's how we've learned to keep the CAC down.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: Now what I would tell you is every time we've tried to go into a new country, CAC is very
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: high.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: For exactly that reason, you're trying to get the first customer, get them to, you know,
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_00: ward them off the spread, then get an accountants to use it, and then get the accountants,
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_00: and then you create that network effect.
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_00: And we have found where we can create network effects like we've done it in the US and
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: Canada and in UK, we can keep the CAC under control, but we don't look at CAC holistically.
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_00: We'll look at it based on new product, new markets, held tolerations should be very
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: different than like in the US where we have a big scale, but that's success is word
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_00: of mouth and accounts.
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_01: I wanted to do a lot to unpack there.
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: You do super bowl ads for quick books and things like that.
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_01: Does that stuff work?
[00:17:20] Yeah.
[00:17:21] Yeah.
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_01: How do you know?
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_01: We've talked about it in HubSpot.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_01: It's like, we don't know.
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_00: First of all, we started doing them and we primarily, you know, where we've been consistent
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_00: is TurboTax.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_00: And you did do quick, you've done quick book.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: We have.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_00: And I'm obsessed with quick books on TurboTax.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, of course.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_01: But just in terms of like super bowl ads, our consistency has been TurboTax.
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_00: And it absolutely pays off.
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: So we do a lot of work afterwards in terms of just what was the RI, what were the number
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_00: of eyeballs?
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_00: What happened to our consideration?
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately conversion.
[00:17:57] Yeah.
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: Did we get customers to convert and can we associate it back causally to the super bowl?
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_00: And I would tell you generally, it's a really been a great ROI.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_00: There's been a couple of years here and there where it's not met our expectations.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: But where do you get those kind of eyeballs?
[00:18:16] Okay.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_01: And it can go very wrong if you don't do it right.
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: It's just back in the fray have a second.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_01: And it doesn't go right.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_01: It's because the actual ad itself just isn't that good.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_01: Is it just very dependent on the quality of the ad you put out there?
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: It all comes down to the quality and the impact of the ad.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_01: Absolutely.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_00: Was it compelling to get into that?
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_00: And do you make that decision?
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: So like lots of people are working on different ad like ideas for it.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_01: Are you the final decision?
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_01: You like you look at seven and you pick it?
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_01: First of all, I have to tell you a story and then I answer your question because the
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_00: story is about the super bowl ad.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_00: I remember vividly was a learning that I had when I worked for Brad.
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_00: So the first super bowl ad we ran was when I was running TurboTax.
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_00: Is that your idea?
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_00: It was the team's idea.
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_00: No good idea is ever mind.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: It's the team's idea.
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_00: And so Brad finds out that we're running a super bowl ad.
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_00: I never even thought to talk to Brad about hey, we're going to run a super bowl ad.
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: And so you know how kind Brad as he called me and goes to San.
[00:19:07] I don't need to approve the super bowl ad.
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: But if you're going to run a super bowl ad like I need to be aware of it because if it
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_00: goes sideways.
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_00: I don't blame him by the way.
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_00: To see you on the board.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: I shared that story with you and he was so right.
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_00: And so yes, I look at it.
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_00: The team owns the creativity.
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_00: I mean, the biggest thing I've learned about ads is everybody has an opinion.
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_00: And most people, it's an end of one are wrong with their opinions.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: Even whether they love it or not, you have to have a systematic way in which you don't
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_00: pick it.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_00: I don't pick it.
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_00: However, I absolutely review it before it goes on.
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: It's going to go on there.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_00: I review everything that before it goes on air.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_00: The big thing that I'm looking for beyond just how does it sit with me, which is the least
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_00: important, but how it sits with me matters is actually I'm looking for reputational risk.
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_00: Does this pass the bar of who we are as a company, the reputation we need to uphold?
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_00: And so that's really what I'm looking for in a super bowl ad.
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_00: Of course, I'll give my opinion.
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: It's not that great or wow, this is amazing, but I'm really looking for the reputational
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_00: element.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_01: Sticking on CAC for just another second.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_01: You love CAC, don't you?
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_01: I do.
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_01: It's SMB.
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_01: How do you scale?
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_01: Get a scale.
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to give you my secret.
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_01: Yes you are.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_01: Is it yield NPS?
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_01: Is that how you measure word of mouth?
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_01: Like how do you know if you're getting the word of mouth or not?
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_01: It's hard to go in the shop and see if Mary's telling Joe that they should use quick
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_01: questions.
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_01: 100% yield NPS or something fancy.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_01: There's a few things that we look at.
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_00: One, we'll look at product recommendation scores.
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_00: That's a big input, but it's just one input.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: The other we look at is services because customers may give you one NPS, but if they're
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_00: using more and more of your services, then that's a huge indication.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_00: So we'll look at, are they using payments?
[00:20:51] Are they using payroll?
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_00: Are they using all of our services?
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_00: Are they using more and more of our services?
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_00: So that's one thing that we look for.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: So it's NPS, it's the number of services.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_00: And then we also have...
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_00: And it's a grocery tension, just like how many, the number of logos churning.
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the grocery tension also just retention dollars that we look at.
[00:21:11] SPEAKER_00: So we look at three, four things because what we've learned, this is probably the most
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: important thing that I would pass on to those that listen to.
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: If you just look at one metric, like our customers recommending, is your NPS high?
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_00: You can have a very high NPS and no new customer growth.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: So you have to really look at multiple metrics again.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_00: We look at what I just articulated to really get a feel for are the things that we're
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_00: doing working or not.
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_01: Lots of founders ask me about HubSpot's channel program, which we've lifted a lot of it
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_01: from you guys.
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_01: And you guys kind of took accountants and turned them into resellers and software companies.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_01: We took website designers and turned them into marketing agencies.
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_01: Talk to me about your advising a founder.
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_01: We get, he's growing, doing great.
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_01: Wants to do a channel program like, how do you do it?
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_01: What works?
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_01: What doesn't work?
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_01: The first piece of advice I would give is, what problem are you trying to solve with
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_00: a channel partner before you jump into how do you become great at channel partners?
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_00: You know, in our case, really, our biggest partner is our accountants.
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_00: And we don't have a bunch of channel partners.
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: We have developers that will build apps on our platforms.
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_00: We have partners, but we don't have the platform to account in channel.
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the accountant channel.
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_00: And really, so why the accountant channel for us?
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_00: Well, accountants also serve consumers and businesses, right?
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_00: They're helping them with their taxes, their books, their accounting advice.
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_00: And the larger you are as a business, you may have them take care of your audit.
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_00: You may outsource your payroll to them, right?
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_00: It depends on who you are and the size of your business.
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_00: And they're very influential in what a business uses in every dimension possible.
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_00: And so that's a great example of like, well, that's a very important partner.
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_00: In fact, one of the big things that we've really evolved in the last years accounts are
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_00: very important partners.
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_00: They're not, it's not just a channel.
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_00: It's not a reseller.
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_00: They're like, they're our partner.
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_00: And we have to really up our game in terms of how we co-develop with them, how we think
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_00: about going to market with them together, how we take their input.
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_00: It's an area we had to significantly improve in the last year.
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_00: And really to answer your question for us, it was about, well, they play a very
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_00: critical role in ultimately what businesses use.
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_00: So not only do we have to be great at the products we build for the end business, but
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_00: we also have to have a relationship with them and they have to use our stuff, love it,
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_00: and then recommended.
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_00: And that's the biggest advice I would give when you're thinking about a channel partner,
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_00: like, why are you doing it?
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_00: Are you doing it because you're trying to manage your CAC?
[00:23:47] And if you're doing that, what does that mean to your overall economics?
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_00: Everybody's talking about the reason people want to do is they want to grow faster.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_00: And the question though is, you grow faster, but what's the economics look like?
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: And you have to think about those things.
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_00: But I would just advise I'd give is be very clear about the problem you're trying to
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_00: solve.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_00: And it's okay to throw some stuff at the wall and see what works.
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_00: But if you just start with, I need channel partners.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_00: I think you may make the wrong choice.
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_01: Let me run some things we've learned about channel partners through HubSpot by you.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: And I'm just curious of it's kind of the same.
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_01: Stuff that worked early was we took website designers to dying business and turn them
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_01: into an agency.
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_01: And we taught them about this new technology and idea called inbound marketing, which is
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_01: ancient now.
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_01: And we taught them how to run a proper agency.
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_01: Like we ran a little university.
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_01: How do you bill?
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_01: How do you charge?
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_01: How do you run your agency?
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_01: That worked.
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_01: Another thing that really worked is once these agencies starting it's signing up lots
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_01: of customers, they needed software themselves.
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_01: So we funded a development team to help them manage all their customers.
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_01: That is their own firm.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_01: And when we come to a nonprofit agency, we come to a nonprofit agency, which is really
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_01: really smart.
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_01: It really is smart.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_01: It really is smart.
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_01: It really is smart.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_01: It really is smart.
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_01: It really is smart.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_01: It really is smart.
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_01: It really is smart.
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_01: It really is smart.
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_01: directly from us, you figure it out, we teach you, or is doing it for me, and that's where
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_01: the agencies come in.
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_01: And that has worked for us.
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_01: Does any of that resonate for you?
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_01: Is that kind of some of the playbook?
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_01: Almost all of it, because I could take that same, what you just said, and place it with
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_00: accountants.
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_00: That's what I figured.
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_00: That's the same exact thing applies.
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_00: But I would just ask you, what problem were you trying to solve when you first started
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_00: engaging these agencies?
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_00: We wanted to grow faster.
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_01: Just be very honest, if you wanted to grow faster.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: And I'll tell you a funny story about it.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_01: It's like two, three years in the HubSpot, and our product was awful, just awful.
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_01: And we had a few sales reps, and we had a lot of leads from agencies who were curious
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_01: about in that marketing.
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_01: What's this HubSpot thing we had a lot of buzz.
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_01: And I told the sales reps, just leave those leads, there's a pile of them over there,
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_01: don't touch them.
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_01: You know, they sat in HubSpot, don't touch them.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_01: We're not going to do the channel part.
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_01: The product's not ready.
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_01: And they kept asking me, no.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_01: And we had this little bit like Google's 20% time where we say, you do whatever you want
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_01: nice weekends.
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_01: So this guy, Pete Caputa, a great but really irritating sales rep.
[00:26:32] He started calling them nice weekends.
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_01: And then you know, there's a distribution of sales reps.
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_01: Let's say we had five of them.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_01: And like, as usually a bell curve, art was like, Pete Caputa was like 50 times more
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: rep than the rest of them.
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_01: Maybe we ought to call on these agency partners.
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: That's how we started it.
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_01: Fascinating.
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_00: It's all of the money.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_01: Talking to this issue about our agency partners, if we look at our retention numbers,
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_01: gross and net, the agency customers have better economic, actually better economics than
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_01: our direct customers.
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_01: Interesting.
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: They take, actually take better customer care of their, of our customers and we do.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_01: By the way, so many similarities.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_00: Like, for instance, when an accountant recommends a customer to use this particularly like
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_00: larger customers that we're now pursuing, that what we call a mid market, the cycle time
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_00: with flows is 10 times faster.
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_00: And we end up offering more services, payments, payroll to that customer than otherwise.
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: So there's so many, so many similarities.
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_01: You guys, founders always asked me to, you add an app.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_01: That was your first act and then you created a suite, second act and then you create a
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_01: platform third act.
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_01: How'd you do it?
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_01: Give some advice to that founder.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_01: She's got 100 employees.
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_01: She wants to go from first act to second act.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_01: You guys have mastered that.
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_00: There's a big part of it as you know, it comes out of necessity, right?
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_00: You've solved one problem while accounting and ultimately what you realize is the customer
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_00: can be far more, you can deliver far more benefit and be far more sticky if then you actually
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_00: help them with creating estimate and then voice and getting paid.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_00: And then the next thing is well, they have employees.
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_00: We need the payroll, payroll, etc, etc.
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_00: And so how far into like the QuickBooks journey, did you start building other stuff?
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_01: Well, early on, but remember, you've been around since the dinosaur ages.
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_01: You said it more directly than I was going to say.
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_01: Remember, we used to ship CDs.
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_00: And so when we were shipping CDs and we had desktop platform, we had payroll, we had
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_00: payments on desktop years ago.
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_00: I see.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_00: But then in order to shift from desktop to the cloud, that was a massive transformation
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_00: for us as a company because we weren't born in the cloud.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_00: It was a hard one, is that recall?
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_01: Very hard.
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_01: A very hard one.
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, we're, we've shifted to the cloud, but we still have customers on desktop
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_00: that were trying to motivate to come to online.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_00: In some cases, they're not very happy with us because they want to remain on desktop.
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_00: But the reason I share that with you is that journey from going to desktop to online took
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_00: a lot out of the company.
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_00: And so when we then shifted to the cloud, we were once again only an accounting platform
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_00: because we had to build everything in the cloud.
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_00: And then we started building out same journey, money solutions, payroll, et cetera.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_00: So the biggest advice I would give a founder is, first of all, everybody has an anchor.
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_00: ours was taxing accounting.
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_00: Then the question is, what's the next problem you can solve for that customer?
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_00: That's right next to that anchor.
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_00: And for us, after accounting, it was, well, people need to, we serve service-based businesses.
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_00: They need to create an estimate and then voice and get paid.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_00: So let's build that out.
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_00: And then let's build out payroll, which is very hard, right?
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_00: Because state, local taxes, country, rules, regulations.
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_00: And so it's really be very intentional about what's next to your anchor.
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_00: And is that a big enough problem to solve?
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_00: Can you build advantage by solving it?
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_00: And then really nail that and then go to the next thing.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_00: And then at some point decide, do you partner on certain things until you build it?
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_00: Do you acquire, that's why we acquired a credit karma?
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_00: We wanted to do more than taxes.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_00: We could have replicated credit karma just taking us five plus years because of the data
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_00: and AI capabilities.
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_00: So that's the advice I would give.
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_01: This is self-serving.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_01: So we built marketing and then we said we're going to go into sales.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_01: We were kind of forced into salesforce.com was coming into marketing.
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_01: And then we went to service and we added, I think we have eight of these applications.
[00:30:28] SPEAKER_01: We always debated.
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_01: We always knew there was going to be eight.
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_01: Should we pin better all seven new ones or should we really almost finish the second one
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_01: before we go to the third?
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: How do you think about second versus third versus like when did you go?
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_01: So your first one was paying people, right?
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_01: Payroll?
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_01: No, well, it was actually, it was actually creating estimates and invoices.
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_01: And then your third one's payroll.
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_01: When did you go to, when did you go through?
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_01: What was it like?
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_01: Do you look at market share before you go where?
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_01: So this is a great question because I now want to go back to your first question you
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_00: asked me, which is playbook of CEOs or playbook of any leader.
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_00: I think that playbook is very different today.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_00: Then it was when you were looking at things seriously to decide what's next.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_00: I mean, today, you know this is well as I.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_00: With data and AI, what we're trying to do is build a system of intelligence where it's
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_00: no longer about what workflow do I build, what app do I build.
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_00: It's actually about learning from the customer and with our data and AI capabilities, solving
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_00: that problem for the customer.
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_00: That's really important because I don't think things are serial today than they were years
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_00: ago.
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_00: You can also build much faster now.
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_00: You can build much faster.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_00: You don't need to be as serial as long as by the way you have some elements of data and
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_00: AI capability.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: So I just think that playbook is very, very different today than it was four or five years
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_00: ago.
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_00: But the thing that doesn't change in my view is being clear.
[00:31:53] What customer problem are you trying to solve is that a big enough problem for the customer.
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_00: And can you solve it in a way where your advantage versus others and you know, they can get
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_00: big.
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_01: Let me press in this a little bit.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_01: I mean, put the clock back.
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_01: I don't know what year called 2020.
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_01: Your back office.
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_01: We just the canonical small business back office.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_01: And then we're going to buy a meal chip in front office.
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_01: I remember that very well.
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_01: And that decision at that point time was that because man, we've got 90 freaking percent
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_01: of the SMB back office.
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: We better go in the front office.
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_01: We're almost done with these applications.
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_01: Like, talk to me about that.
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_01: When we observed customers and their data, they had created our customers, had created
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_00: 20 billion records within our QuickBooks platform, trying to manage their customers within
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_00: QuickBooks.
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_00: So they were creating shit.
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_00: They were using QuickBooks as their secret.
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_01: And so what we realized is we have to solve this problem because customers are manually creating
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_00: a bunch of records because they don't want to use multiple different platforms.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_00: And sort of back to, can we build it?
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_00: Of course, is this where we want to put our internal capital?
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_00: Do we have the know how the domain X for dessert you go buy it?
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_00: What we let to buying milk.
[00:33:09] Okay.
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_01: Got it.
[00:33:11] SPEAKER_01: You've made a lot of acquisition.
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_01: Not a lot.
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_01: You made a bunch.
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_01: Some have been real dogs.
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_01: Some have been terrific.
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_01: We don't have the name names.
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_01: And like HubSpots, we've started it, made by a bunch of companies.
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_01: What advice would you give HubSpot and an ECO about, you know, the lemon, the one that
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_01: did work versus this work?
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_01: Is there some best practices or some things you've learned about how to do them?
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_01: 100%.
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_00: Well, let's just put to this side, the foundational stuff, which is you've done your homework.
[00:33:37] There's real clarity of strategically why you're doing it.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_00: You understand the culture that you're buying.
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: You have a plan around that you've done your delete.
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_00: Like let's put all that to the side because that's really foundational.
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_00: The two big things that we've learned is the pace of product integration and talent.
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_00: Where we moved fast on integrating the platform, I would use TurboTax and credit karma.
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_00: I mean, credit karma is an absolute home run.
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_00: Where we move fast to know what problems we're going to solve and integrate the product
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_00: so we can get to benefit for customers, which by the way, translates into growth.
[00:34:11] And then where we need it to either upgrade talent or make talent changes, when we do
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_00: those two things well, what we've seen is, and by the way, little acquisitions that nobody
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_00: asks about, and then there's the big ones, right?
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_00: Credit karma and MailChimp.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_00: Did you leave the CEOs in place and leave them independent or you put your people in
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: the...
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_00: It was situational.
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_00: Like in the case of credit karma, it's situational.
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_00: Ken and I had a great relationship.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_00: He wanted the Continuity BCO, very effective CEO, and he and his team were in place for
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_00: quite some time.
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_00: Whereas in the case of MailChimp, Ben actually told us and told me from day one, we got
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_00: to upgrade the leadership team.
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_00: So you put your folks in there.
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_01: That's right.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_00: But back to your question, it's product integration and it's talent.
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_00: Those make an enormous difference in terms of success.
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_00: And making the tough decisions up front is far better than waiting.
[00:35:05] Okay.
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_01: I want to come back to something you talked about earlier.
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_01: You guys have been around a while.
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_01: You were desktop software and then you had to transcend.
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_01: And I think it was like client server and then went to SAS.
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_01: I went to AI.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_01: We're kind of on a big shift now.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_01: You were one of few companies that made that shift pretty well.
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_01: Adobe and SAP, not a lot of companies, made that shift from client software to SAS.
[00:35:31] What did you do right there?
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_01: Did you wait too long?
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_01: Were you too fast?
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_01: Like when you look at that shift back then.
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_01: My sense was you moved to SAS actually kind of slow.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: First of all, your premise of your question is a really important one,
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_00: which is we were born 40 some odd years ago in the era of DOS.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:35:49] Right.
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_00: Which makes it even more impressive how well you guys have done.
[00:35:53] SPEAKER_00: And I would just say our success is when we were always in love with the customer problem
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_00: and always willing to disrupt ourselves.
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_00: And that's so much easier said than done, by the way, so much easier said than done.
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_00: But that's why we're still around.
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_00: And it's also why we were absolutely slow to move to SAS.
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_00: We were probably four to five years to slow.
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_00: But your customers weren't asking for SAS.
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_00: Customers weren't asking for it.
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_00: They absolutely didn't want to move to the cloud.
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_00: And as much as we are a culture of disruption, that's a very hard move to make.
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_00: Did you rebuild from scratch?
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_00: In many cases, we had to rebuild from scratch.
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_00: And they're service.
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_00: But remember, it's even harder than the way you're asking the question.
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_00: We were a desktop company.
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_00: We had all of our data was siloed across turbo tax, across accounting, across back then
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_00: when we had payroll payments on every bunch of siloed vertical stacks and data.
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_00: It was mess to move to the cloud.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't a mess the way we were running it.
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_00: But to move to become SAS, that's like, that is so hard to do, which is why we were slow.
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_00: Because it was more technological problem or business model problem.
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_01: This model was totally changed.
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_01: Culture, talent.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_00: Interesting.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_01: Business model.
[00:37:01] It's everything.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_00: Got it.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_00: That's why you can look back and go while we were slow.
[00:37:07] But when you're in it, what we had to do was you follow the customer home.
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_01: They're not going to tell you to make a platform shift.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_01: Of course.
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: But if you want to keep growing, you have to make a platform shift.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_00: So yes, we were slow.
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_00: But the degree of difficulty was very high.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_00: I would say we were on reverse.
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_00: We were very early in AI.
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_00: I agree.
[00:37:24] Which is hard to talk to me about that.
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_01: What's going on now for you on that shift?
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_01: Why were you were like, we're an AI company in like, 2008, a long time ago.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_01: Way before it was cool.
[00:37:37] Were you too early?
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_00: I would tell you, looking back, we absolutely weren't too early.
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_00: We're not.
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_00: We're not.
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_00: I'm glad we declared.
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_00: But you did all say, did any of it really work in 2008?
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_00: Well, let me first tell you why.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_00: And then I'll answer your question.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_00: We did it for very practical reasons.
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_00: When I stepped into this role because I had the privilege of being in all the businesses
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_00: serving all the different customers, there are two big things that we put in place six
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_00: and a half years ago.
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_00: One was we have to solve more problems in tax and accounting.
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_00: And we have to become a platform so we can play a meaningful role in the lives of consumers
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_00: and businesses.
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_00: That was one big decision.
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_00: We didn't know how, but that was one big strategic decision.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_00: The other big strategic decision was data and AI for very practical reasons.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_00: Because the biggest thing I learned being in all these businesses is consumers and businesses
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_00: want things done for them.
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_00: It's money, it's confidence, get my stuff done for me, second manage, focus on my business
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: or my life as a consumer.
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_00: So we said the only way we could do that was data and AI.
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_00: And that was the second big decision.
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_00: And to your question level, were you too early declaring it a big heavy lift was all the
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_00: work we did around data and data services, like cleaning the data, making sure it's usable,
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_00: making sure we can ingest data.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_00: So it's actually teaking on you already.
[00:38:52] Yeah, the AI part was actually the easier part.
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_00: The harder part is all the data.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_00: And now that it's usable and all the services we have to ingest data, that's why I'm glad
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_00: we started six and a half years ago because now we're far better positioned for what
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_00: we're doing today in the future.
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_00: And when you think of it, are you infusing AI into your current platform or are you saying,
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_01: hey, we're going to start from a blank sheet of paper and build an AI native version
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: of QuickBooks.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_01: I would say both.
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_00: Everything and I get asked a lot.
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: So what's your AI revenues?
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_00: The whole company is sits on our data and AI platform, like everything from payments
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_00: to payroll, the tax, everything sits on our data layer, data models and our AI platform.
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_00: So that's sort of number one.
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_00: Number two, one of the things we launched in July of this year is a virtual team of AI
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: agents to do a lot of the work for you.
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: A lot of that is AI native.
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_00: You're going to put the account inside of business to buy doing that?
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_00: No, we're actually our focus is how do we fuel their success.
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_00: And we're also very transparent with accounts, which is if you only have 50 customers and
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_00: all you do is tax, you should really be part of our platform, our expert platform because
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_00: with technology and the supply issues, it's going to be tough as you look ahead.
[00:40:08] SPEAKER_00: So we're trying to fuel their success, but we're also partnering with the large firms
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_00: to really fuel their success because they're trying to digitize, they want efficiency,
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_00: they want to improve profitability, particularly the PE back firms.
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_00: Our goal is partnership because we believe in AI plus HI.
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_00: We think human intelligence is essential for today and the future.
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_00: Our focus is everything needs to be done for you.
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_00: How do we deliver experiences that's done for you versus building more workflows and
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_00: designing more products?
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_00: Yep.
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_01: We only have a couple minutes left.
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_01: I have a thousand more questions, by the way.
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_01: They coach all these CEOs of Schmort.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_01: They're hungry.
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_01: They're between 10 and call it 500 employees.
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_01: And they want to go from like start up founder to scale up CEO.
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_01: What CEO advice would you give to these people?
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_01: That's a loaded question.
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_01: You're smart guy.
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_00: I would say really focus on winning.
[00:40:56] These jobs are hard.
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_00: You know, I do like your job.
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_00: No, I love winning.
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_01: Is the day to day do you enjoy it?
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_00: There are a lot of days where I'm like that was no.
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_00: I'm not solving for joy.
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_00: I think that's the advice I would give is if you're solving for just following your
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_00: passion and defining how the day went by joy and happiness, you're not going to succeed
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_00: in this world.
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_00: As a CEO or not a CEO.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_00: So the advice I would give is focus on the customer and focus on winning.
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_00: These jobs are hard.
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_00: Be prepared.
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_00: If you want to do this job, you got to have grit.
[00:41:31] SPEAKER_00: You got to work hard.
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_00: You got to have resilience.
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_00: You got to understand that most days you're not.
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_00: It's not about passion.
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_00: It's not about joy.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_00: It's about winning.
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_00: And what we do is very hard.
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_00: And I just think the mental toughness, I think talent is overrated.
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:41:44] I think it's all about grit and it's all about hard work.
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_00: I will take anyone that has grit and hard work versus how do you know someone see a year
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_00: interview and someone?
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_01: How do you know if they get grit and hard work?
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_00: Just you know what?
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_00: I there's one of the things we have is one over one approval.
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_00: Most of if my team is going to hire anyone, ultimately I interview them.
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_00: And more than 50% of time I go back to them and say, I don't think this is the right
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_00: person.
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_00: Grit.
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_00: Because it's just it's the grit.
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_00: It's the hunger.
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_00: It's the passion.
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_00: You know, sometimes what do you have someone to figure that out?
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_00: I figure it out in the conversation.
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_00: You can smell if somebody's hungry, if they have grit, if they have perseverance.
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's what it takes to do this job back to your question is the biggest advice
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_00: I'd give CEOs is don't lose sight of the prize and it's hard.
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_00: Get after it.
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_00: Outwork everyone.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_00: Have grit.
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_00: And if you fail, figure out how to get up and bounce back and you'll achieve great things
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_00: in life.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_00: It may not be that CEO gig, but you'll achieve great things in life.
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_00: So advice I give my kids.
[00:42:41] You've done an amazing job here and into it.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_01: You've done an amazing job in this podcast.
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_01: Thank you for sharing all your knowledge.
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_01: Your legend.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_01: Appreciate you.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_01: Thank you, my friend.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
[00:42:50] Okay.
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: Hope you like that interview with Sassan.
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_01: I really enjoyed it.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_01: A couple of high level things.
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_01: Both Sassan and his predecessor Brad Smith are very polished and very smooth and they
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_01: kind of rhyme with a couple of other folks have had on the pod.
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_01: David Solomon from Goldman and the Kesher Roar from Palo Alto.
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_01: It seems like that's sort of a common thread amongst the CEOs who have been hired in to
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_01: replace the founder and a company.
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_01: Kind of interesting that they have that common.
[00:43:23] Another thought like I spent that day with Brad Smith, their CEO a few years ago.
[00:43:30] Just my suggestion to all of you listening if you're a CEO or you want to be a CEO, that
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_01: really worked and was really helpful to me.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_01: So if you know a CEO and you admire them, ask, hey, can I come in and sit with you for
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_01: a day and sit through your meetings.
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: But very worse thing that can happen is a CEO is very flattered and says no.
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_01: And so you kind of win either way.
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_01: He asked a good question of himself every six months.
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_01: He asked himself the question, if I joined the company today from the outside, what changes
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_01: would I make?
[00:44:03] SPEAKER_01: And that's the question I always said I was asked myself at HubSpot and I rarely did
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_01: it.
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_01: That stuck with you, I recommend you do it.
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_01: I like that he and almost everyone have talked to is gets on the coal face with the customers.
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_01: Like gets on support calls, goes and talks to customers, follows them home.
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_01: And I think way kills a lot of startups kind of between 100 and 1000 employees is you get
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_01: some layers in there and you get all the feedback filtered and you lose that sort of coal face
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_01: touch with the customers.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_01: One thing he talked about was this follow me home concept and it's at least it used to
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_01: be.
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_01: It's a famous concept in my mind where the founder of into it they sell to very small business
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_01: and people typically run them out of their home.
[00:44:48] SPEAKER_01: So he would go to someone's home and watch them do all their paperwork and watch them
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_01: do all their accounting and see how frustrating it was and then kind of build from them.
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_01: That was his sort of secret sauce.
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_01: And almost every CEO I speak with is really obsessed with understanding the customer.
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_01: When I think people get in trouble with now is they look at the analytics for the customer
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_01: and they can see usage data and everything's very wired up quite nicely for the CEO to
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_01: see.
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_01: But I think you miss something when you don't actually do that follow me home because when
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_01: you do the follow me home and you sit with virtually or not that end user, you can see
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_01: not just what they're using, but where are they cutting and pasting into other things
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_01: and where's the messiness in the process.
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_01: I see a lot of CEOs are getting away from that.
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_01: I would encourage you all to say there.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_01: I think a very common cause of death for companies going from 100 to 1000 employees is they
[00:45:44] kind of lose that coal face with the customer.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_01: They get their information filtered heavily by their by their staff.
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_01: They get reporting from analytics apps, but they don't actually talk to those customers
[00:45:56] SPEAKER_01: and they don't make their senior team talk to those customers.
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_01: So I think that's key.
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_01: Then we talked about the SMB segment and we have this in common within to it, although
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_01: we sell more to M than S than they do.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_01: What he says about S I think is right is you can't treat them like many enterprises.
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_01: You have to treat them like consumers like the individual is like a consumer product.
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_01: You have to build it that way.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_01: And it's a different mindset and it's very easy to get talked into building all kinds
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_01: of other stuff for many enterprises.
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_01: So I like that they did that.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: The key in SMB is to keep your cat low.
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_01: If your cat is relying on Facebook ads or whatever advertising model, it's very hard
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_01: to scale that.
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_01: And I like that they focused on that.
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_01: They work through channels.
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_01: They were obsessive about word of mouth and net promoter score.
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_01: So I like that a lot.
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_01: And the other thing you have to do if you want to build an SMB business is you need a really
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_01: solid LTV.
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_01: You're going to have churn.
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_01: Some of these folks are going to go out of business.
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_01: I like how spot will lose.
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_01: Call it 11%.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_01: So we start the over the hundred dollars and then we end the year actually with $89.
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_01: But then we upsell them up to $203 and $104.
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_01: So you have to be able to fill that divot with your best customer buying more stuff.
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_01: So I think they've kind of got it down how you build an SMB business.
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_01: I think more companies should go after this target.
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_01: There's just like gravity on San Toro that everyone wants to go to the enterprise.
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_01: But if you can think it through, man, you can build a huge business in SMB.
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_01: They've come from spot into it, Shopify, they're all cranking, okay, we talked about second
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_01: apps and platforms and lots of founders asked me about this, a lot of companies died because
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_01: they can never figure that second act out.
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_01: I kind of always thought of it in HubSpot, either you build a platform, or you get eaten
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_01: by a platform, and so we ended up building a platform, what they did and HubSpot did
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_01: is they had their first app was accounting, and the second app, which just right next
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_01: to it, was invoicing.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_01: So they didn't go way into HR or something like that.
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_01: We're going to do invoicing.
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_01: So that was the first act, second act.
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_01: And then after a while, they went into payroll, which
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_01: is a little further away.
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_01: They're pretty close to that.
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_01: So when you're building a second act,
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_01: keep it tight, keep it close.
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_01: Very helpful if it's the same buyer who's
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_01: buying both of those products, not always the case
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_01: and hard to find that, but really important.
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_01: And then the other thing I would say
[00:48:15] SPEAKER_01: is as you're going to your third act,
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_01: I think you want to be a little bit more
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_01: serial than parallel in the way you think about this stuff.
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_01: So you build your first act.
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_01: And then instead of doing second, third, fourth
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_01: act and peanut buttering it, really
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_01: go after that second act and get to table states on there
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_01: before you go to your third act, your fourth act, et cetera.
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_01: I really like Sassan's hiring criteria, grit.
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_01: It's the first time I've interviewed 9 or 10 of these really
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_01: terrific CEOs and no one said that before.
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_01: It reminds me of Sequoias hiring criteria for entrepreneurs.
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_01: They look for that chip on the shoulder.
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_01: I don't think they always get it.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_01: Pretty much.
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_01: And so he looks for that.
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_01: And most founders are telling me these days
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_01: we're looking for slope or we're looking for experience.
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_01: But I like his grit.
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_01: What's your hiring criteria?
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_01: What's your through line for all your
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_01: execs you're hiring?
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_01: That's a good question to ask yourself.
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_01: Okay, those are my my take sons Sassan.
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_01: I think there's a lot there.
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_01: And I hope you enjoyed it.
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_01: And I'll see you on the next one.
