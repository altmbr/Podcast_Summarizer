[00:00:00] We were born 40 some odd years ago, right in the era of DOS.
[00:00:04] Sasan Goodarzi: And right, which makes it even more impressive how well you guys are done.
[00:00:08] Sasan Goodarzi: And I would just say our successes when we were always in love with the customer
[00:00:12] Sasan Goodarzi: problem and always willing to disrupt ourselves.
[00:00:14] Sasan Goodarzi: And that's so much easier said than done.
[00:00:16] Sasan Goodarzi: By the way, so much easier said than done.
[00:00:19] Sasan Goodarzi: But that's why we're still around.
[00:00:30] Hey, welcome to the pod.
[00:00:39] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Today we have Sassan, the CEO of Intuit.
[00:00:42] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I'm known in like Sassan for a very long time.
[00:00:45] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I've known in like Intuit for a very long time.
[00:00:48] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They're an interesting company that been around for many, many decades in a bit
[00:00:53] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): of a contrarian space selling into very small businesses.
[00:00:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And they've scaled to 180 billion market cap.
[00:01:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So there's a lot to learn from these guys.
[00:01:03] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I'm excited to dig in.
[00:01:04] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I've actually met three different Intuit CEOs.
[00:01:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I work with tons of CEOs in my daily life.
[00:01:11] These are grownups.
[00:01:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I think there's something to be learned from grownups.
[00:01:16] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And we're going to dig into some grown up topics.
[00:01:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We dig into what is a grown up CEO operating system look like?
[00:01:23] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What is Sassan's hiring criteria, which I did not expect.
[00:01:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I think it's pretty interesting.
[00:01:28] How do you build an indirect channel?
[00:01:30] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Most of the quick books revenue comes through an accounting channel
[00:01:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): that they build that's fascinating.
[00:01:36] We talked about second acts and third acts and platforms.
[00:01:39] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): One of my favorite topics and something they're very, very good at.
[00:01:42] And then we talk about SMB.
[00:01:44] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): There are very few companies that have built with any scale in the SMB segment of the market.
[00:01:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I hope you come back and we chat again after the interview.
[00:01:53] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Just have a lot of takes on it.
[00:01:55] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): See you on the other side.
[00:01:57] So it's not great to see you.
[00:01:58] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Very good to see you, man.
[00:01:59] Sasan Goodarzi: It's been a long time.
[00:02:00] Sasan Goodarzi: I know. I miss you.
[00:02:01] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You look great.
[00:02:03] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.
[00:02:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So I came on the campus today and it reminded me the first time I visited the Intuit campus,
[00:02:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): which was in 2010.
[00:02:12] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): HubSpot was four years old.
[00:02:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And my co-founder and I were coming to visit Scott Cook and your CEO.
[00:02:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And we were just sitting in the lobby.
[00:02:20] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I just remember I wanted to throw up on myself.
[00:02:21] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I was so nervous because we were a little tiny company.
[00:02:23] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We were really looked up to you.
[00:02:24] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And we met with you guys and we had a really good meeting.
[00:02:29] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And you guys gave us a lot of insight.
[00:02:30] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): At the end of the meeting, I was kind of taken with Brad Smith, your CEO.
[00:02:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I said, is there any chance you'd let me shadow you for a day?
[00:02:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Oh, yeah.
[00:02:38] Sasan Goodarzi: And he said, sure, come on.
[00:02:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I'm back any time, which I was delighted.
[00:02:42] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And so about a month later, it came back because that in the lobby,
[00:02:45] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I wanted to throw up on myself because I was so nervous.
[00:02:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I shadowed Brad Smith, the legend.
[00:02:50] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And it was a fascinating day.
[00:02:52] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I learned a lot.
[00:02:53] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): He brought me to executive leadership committee meeting.
[00:02:55] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): All the executives in there.
[00:02:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I saw how he ran it.
[00:02:58] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It was really good founders in there.
[00:02:59] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Just went through the whole day with them lunch, everything.
[00:03:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): The most interesting meeting was he had a performance review of someone.
[00:03:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And you were in the room and it was kind of a tough performance review.
[00:03:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Oh, wow.
[00:03:09] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And he's like, nope, you're going to stay in the room.
[00:03:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So I was in the room in this guy.
[00:03:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah, I guess all of the pluses and minuses.
[00:03:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So that's when I think back to it, I learned so much from Brad and so much from you guys.
[00:03:20] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And there's so much into it inside of HubSpot.
[00:03:24] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): But we're not here to talk about me.
[00:03:25] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We're here to talk about you.
[00:03:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You're becoming a legend running into it doing so well.
[00:03:29] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Tell me about when you first took the job.
[00:03:31] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You took the job over from Brad.
[00:03:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): The building is named after Brad.
[00:03:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What was that like?
[00:03:36] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So 2018, Brad Smith's done a great job is stepping down.
[00:03:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They're looking for a new CEO.
[00:03:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): There's this was it at all like the show succession.
[00:03:43] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That's a good one.
[00:03:44] Sasan Goodarzi: So you know, I did something very much like, I'm just, I'm curious.
[00:03:49] Sasan Goodarzi: And I'm always out learning from, from customers from our product teams and, and external leaders.
[00:03:56] Sasan Goodarzi: So one of the things I did, but I would just say more like an event.
[00:04:00] Sasan Goodarzi: When I was announced is I went out and talked to 15, 20 folks that if I were to name them,
[00:04:06] Sasan Goodarzi: you would know all of them.
[00:04:07] Sasan Goodarzi: And, and it was really to get advice.
[00:04:09] Sasan Goodarzi: But, but the one person that comes to mind is given your question with Steve Young.
[00:04:15] Sasan Goodarzi: So quarterback of the 49ers, hella famer.
[00:04:19] I went and met him and, and it's a let he's a legend.
[00:04:22] Sasan Goodarzi: And the reason I went to meet him is he had to step in, you know, behind big shoes.
[00:04:27] Sasan Goodarzi: Joe Montana, right?
[00:04:28] Sasan Goodarzi: It was the most unforgettable meeting because he actually took me through the journey of when he became
[00:04:34] Sasan Goodarzi: quarterback.
[00:04:34] Sasan Goodarzi: I think it was when Joe Montana got hurt.
[00:04:36] Sasan Goodarzi: And long story short, he said, listen, I was getting booed.
[00:04:41] Sasan Goodarzi: People were like, bring Joe back and we were having a tough time.
[00:04:45] Sasan Goodarzi: And, and he said I was on a plane ride back with someone famous that I won't name
[00:04:51] Sasan Goodarzi: here because he asked me not to ever name them.
[00:04:54] Sasan Goodarzi: And as the person said, oh, here, Steve Young.
[00:04:57] Sasan Goodarzi: And he was said I was pouting and telling him how pissed off I was because I had taken a
[00:05:01] Sasan Goodarzi: couple of day break.
[00:05:02] Sasan Goodarzi: And the person said, you have been chosen as the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers.
[00:05:10] Sasan Goodarzi: You are not here to fill Joe Montana shoes.
[00:05:14] You are here to win.
[00:05:16] Sasan Goodarzi: They picked you as the quarterback.
[00:05:19] Sasan Goodarzi: So he said, go be the best that you can be.
[00:05:23] And don't try to follow Joe Montana.
[00:05:27] And he said that conversation changed him.
[00:05:29] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:05:30] Sasan Goodarzi: After that conversation, if you look at when he had the conversation and then his trajectory
[00:05:35] Sasan Goodarzi: and then the 49ers, it completely changed.
[00:05:37] Sasan Goodarzi: Did someone have that conversation with you?
[00:05:39] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That's the advice he gave me.
[00:05:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It does seem like there's the seat.
[00:05:43] You old CEO play playbook seems to be changing like Jensen Huang is doing all kinds
[00:05:48] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): of interesting things.
[00:05:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah.
[00:05:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): The whole founder mode thing.
[00:05:52] What are the non obvious things that really work for you and the job that maybe
[00:05:58] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): not be part of the normal playbook?
[00:06:00] Well, first of all, you're right.
[00:06:01] Sasan Goodarzi: I think there is no playbook and it changes on a monthly basis.
[00:06:07] Sasan Goodarzi: So if you try to stick to a playbook, you could be in trouble.
[00:06:10] Sasan Goodarzi: The couple of things that have always kept me grounded is the main theme is just
[00:06:17] Sasan Goodarzi: curiosity.
[00:06:18] Sasan Goodarzi: So I spend a lot of time with customers.
[00:06:22] Sasan Goodarzi: They always keep me grounded in terms of like, what's important?
[00:06:26] Sasan Goodarzi: What are they trying to do with their life?
[00:06:27] Sasan Goodarzi: What tools are they using?
[00:06:29] Sasan Goodarzi: Why are they using them?
[00:06:30] Sasan Goodarzi: So that's one, too.
[00:06:31] Sasan Goodarzi: I spent a lot of time also doing a lot of CEOs.
[00:06:33] Sasan Goodarzi: I just couldn't push back a bit every CEO does that these days.
[00:06:36] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yes.
[00:06:37] Sasan Goodarzi: You should do it.
[00:06:38] Sasan Goodarzi: But I use that as one element of always be grounded.
[00:06:41] Sasan Goodarzi: The second is I spent a lot of time with our frontline engineers to try to understand
[00:06:45] Sasan Goodarzi: like what's getting in their way?
[00:06:47] Sasan Goodarzi: Are there dependencies that slows them down because of velocity is everything.
[00:06:51] Sasan Goodarzi: So I'm close to customers, close to our front lines because I think it was sitting
[00:06:55] Sasan Goodarzi: in our shoes.
[00:06:56] Sasan Goodarzi: A lot of stuff gets filtered.
[00:06:58] Sasan Goodarzi: And so you have to be in touch with customers.
[00:06:59] Sasan Goodarzi: You have to be in touch with frontline employees and you have to be in touch with
[00:07:03] Sasan Goodarzi: just your KPIs like what's working?
[00:07:05] Sasan Goodarzi: What's not?
[00:07:05] Sasan Goodarzi: So one is just helicopter skills.
[00:07:08] Sasan Goodarzi: And no matter what is going on, that's one common thing that always grounds me.
[00:07:13] Sasan Goodarzi: I called it speed-lunking kind of.
[00:07:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You're up here and then we're down like, and you grow people crazy by the way,
[00:07:19] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): but that's kind of how I do it.
[00:07:20] Sasan Goodarzi: But by the way, I think every successful leader, you don't have to be a CEO.
[00:07:23] Sasan Goodarzi: Every successful leader has to be, has to have a method in which they operate.
[00:07:28] Sasan Goodarzi: You have to be grounded in the details.
[00:07:30] Sasan Goodarzi: You have to be close to the details because if you just operate in the cloud and you
[00:07:35] Sasan Goodarzi: don't know what's going on with employees, customers, products and your KPIs,
[00:07:38] Sasan Goodarzi: then I don't think you're effective.
[00:07:39] Sasan Goodarzi: So that's you asked about playbook.
[00:07:41] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah.
[00:07:42] Sasan Goodarzi: That's the common thing that always helps me be in love with the problem and how fast
[00:07:47] Sasan Goodarzi: the world is moving and not in love with what we've declared.
[00:07:49] Sasan Goodarzi: I would say just second thing is I'm just big on principles and mechanisms.
[00:07:53] Sasan Goodarzi: Like what are the principles?
[00:07:55] Sasan Goodarzi: Principles aren't like, for instance, we have a mechanism in which we run the company,
[00:07:59] Sasan Goodarzi: but it's really how I spend my time.
[00:08:01] Sasan Goodarzi: And just if even if I think about today, you know, in one meeting, we were talking about
[00:08:06] Sasan Goodarzi: things that are coming around the corner and haven't even been invented yet.
[00:08:10] Sasan Goodarzi: I'm reconcilating what we should do to doing a product review, to reviewing our dashboard,
[00:08:16] Sasan Goodarzi: to meeting with a customer.
[00:08:17] Sasan Goodarzi: So mechanisms are just about how do we manage short and long?
[00:08:21] Sasan Goodarzi: How do we ensure that we're really monitoring the things that we said we're going to do
[00:08:25] Sasan Goodarzi: around product around, around go to market, but also mechanisms to invest
[00:08:31] Sasan Goodarzi: time with thought partners that are very comfortable telling me, hey, I don't think your
[00:08:35] Sasan Goodarzi: strategy is right.
[00:08:36] Sasan Goodarzi: I don't think what you're doing is right.
[00:08:37] Sasan Goodarzi: Here's what I think you should be doing.
[00:08:39] Sasan Goodarzi: So we have mechanisms in terms of how we run the company.
[00:08:42] Sasan Goodarzi: A lot of those been around or those new or that's like into it in the, in the, you know,
[00:08:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): in them.
[00:08:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We changed it completely six years ago, but we've evolved them almost every year.
[00:08:53] Sasan Goodarzi: There isn't just one, but this, I would say the three or four that I would call out is
[00:08:59] Sasan Goodarzi: we have a mechanism where the intent of the mechanism is question everything we've declared.
[00:09:03] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:09:04] Sasan Goodarzi: And if today was day one, what would you do?
[00:09:06] Sasan Goodarzi: I love that.
[00:09:07] Sasan Goodarzi: And that just keeps us grounded.
[00:09:09] Sasan Goodarzi: It's the objective of the mechanism.
[00:09:10] Sasan Goodarzi: So you don't go into that discussion with the senior team protecting what you're doing.
[00:09:15] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah.
[00:09:15] Sasan Goodarzi: You're actually in there to blow up what you're doing.
[00:09:17] Sasan Goodarzi: I love that.
[00:09:18] Sasan Goodarzi: The intent is outside in today's day one.
[00:09:20] Sasan Goodarzi: You took over a CEO as a leadership team.
[00:09:22] Sasan Goodarzi: What would you do?
[00:09:23] Sasan Goodarzi: That's a very important mechanism.
[00:09:24] Sasan Goodarzi: And how often does that meeting or that contact that happens at least
[00:09:29] Sasan Goodarzi: once a year?
[00:09:30] Sasan Goodarzi: And I use the word at least because situationally if something is going on, we'll, we'll
[00:09:34] Sasan Goodarzi: impromptu have a conversation, which we've done twice in the last two years because of
[00:09:39] Sasan Goodarzi: luck going on.
[00:09:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): All I going on.
[00:09:41] Sasan Goodarzi: So that's, that's a very important one.
[00:09:43] Sasan Goodarzi: The other one is when we actually review are deliverable.
[00:09:45] Sasan Goodarzi: One of the, you talked about shadowing.
[00:09:48] Sasan Goodarzi: I'm big on shadowing.
[00:09:49] Sasan Goodarzi: Oh, you are.
[00:09:50] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:09:51] Sasan Goodarzi: And so I had the opportunity to shadow Andy Jassy at, at Amazon when I was the CIO and
[00:09:57] Sasan Goodarzi: he was running AWS.
[00:09:59] Sasan Goodarzi: And there's a number of things that I learned from Amazon.
[00:10:02] Sasan Goodarzi: One of them that we copied is what, what's called their input goal system.
[00:10:07] Sasan Goodarzi: And their input goals are really around like what are the big products go to market, technology
[00:10:13] Sasan Goodarzi: deliverable?
[00:10:14] Sasan Goodarzi: So you're, it's the biggest decisions, investments that you're making.
[00:10:18] Sasan Goodarzi: And with success metrics, that's another mechanism I would call out.
[00:10:22] Sasan Goodarzi: It's really changed clarity of the inputs that we're focused on and how are we doing against
[00:10:28] Sasan Goodarzi: them?
[00:10:29] Sasan Goodarzi: And they expose where we have prioritization issues, resource allocation issues, talent
[00:10:34] Sasan Goodarzi: issues.
[00:10:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I just found with HubSpot just on the input thing like gravity pulls you towards lagging indicators
[00:10:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): and trying to keep the company on leading indicators is just hard.
[00:10:46] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Hard.
[00:10:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Which is why I love this mechanism.
[00:10:48] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:10:49] Sasan Goodarzi: It's not just a mechanism.
[00:10:50] Sasan Goodarzi: It's not just a meeting.
[00:10:51] Sasan Goodarzi: It's a process around input goals.
[00:10:54] Sasan Goodarzi: I love that one.
[00:10:55] Sasan Goodarzi: And the third one is we just, we, not only do I spend a lot of time with customers, but
[00:10:58] Sasan Goodarzi: we have a sort of a customer experience review mechanism where we're, we're really talking
[00:11:03] Sasan Goodarzi: about the experience, what's working, what's not.
[00:11:06] Sasan Goodarzi: If I were to call out three and there's, there's more than three mechanisms, those are
[00:11:09] Sasan Goodarzi: the ones that I just think are, they're game changing for us.
[00:11:12] Sasan Goodarzi: The third one I like, like I called it the call face I wanted to get on the call face
[00:11:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): and hear from the customers.
[00:11:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So we had a customer at every company meeting.
[00:11:21] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Once a month we had a staff meeting, we would have customer panels of the staff meeting
[00:11:25] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): in the most lively ones were the customers that had canceled.
[00:11:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That was always the most ones.
[00:11:30] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And then we just had our board meeting yesterday and we have a customer panel or our board meeting.
[00:11:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Those are terrific.
[00:11:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So similar to HubSpot trying to create mechanisms to keep the customer loud in our ears.
[00:11:39] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That's right.
[00:11:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I love what you just said, which is, I think the most powerful situations in our lives
[00:11:45] Sasan Goodarzi: is when somebody is in a very authentic way challenging you.
[00:11:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And you're giving them permission to challenge you.
[00:11:54] Sasan Goodarzi: So as a customer, if it's interesting, we had a couple of customers that had left us
[00:11:58] Sasan Goodarzi: at our leadership conference in front of hundreds of our leaders and there were like, here's
[00:12:03] Sasan Goodarzi: why I left.
[00:12:04] Sasan Goodarzi: Here's what you need to do differently.
[00:12:05] Sasan Goodarzi: And I just think there's a lot of power when you learn from what you could have done differently
[00:12:10] Sasan Goodarzi: and I love what you all do at HubSpot.
[00:12:12] Sasan Goodarzi: I just think it really brings to life a culture of learning and curiosity.
[00:12:17] Sasan Goodarzi: Yep.
[00:12:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I think we got a lot of that from you, by the way.
[00:12:20] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I coach CEOs.
[00:12:21] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I get very consistent questions about certain things.
[00:12:25] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And anyone who's starting a company and is a CEO targeting small, medium businesses finds
[00:12:31] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): me.
[00:12:32] Sasan Goodarzi: You guys are the world champions of SMB.
[00:12:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What's working so well there?
[00:12:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Why does so many start up to get it wrong and end up going up in the enterprise?
[00:12:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What is the magic to creating a company that really thrives in us and because very few?
[00:12:46] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You know, Brian, it's, first of all, I would say it's a magic that Scott Cook created
[00:12:51] Sasan Goodarzi: years ago that we've just been over the years building on.
[00:12:56] Sasan Goodarzi: And I think the first element of the magic is going to sound real obvious, but they're
[00:13:00] Sasan Goodarzi: actually consumers.
[00:13:02] Sasan Goodarzi: They behave like consumers.
[00:13:04] Sasan Goodarzi: They act like consumers.
[00:13:06] Sasan Goodarzi: The minute you put the word, they're a business in front of it, then you start thinking
[00:13:10] Sasan Goodarzi: large business, large enterprise, and they behave and act like consumers.
[00:13:15] Sasan Goodarzi: And so the obsessive focus that you have to have on like what problem can you solve
[00:13:20] Sasan Goodarzi: for that business that doesn't have the infrastructure that Hubspot and Intuit has,
[00:13:25] Sasan Goodarzi: but there are two, three people shop.
[00:13:28] Sasan Goodarzi: And they're like, how do you help them with the basics?
[00:13:30] Sasan Goodarzi: Like get a customer.
[00:13:31] Sasan Goodarzi: Know which ones are profitable, help them get paid, cash flow, like really narrow, narrow
[00:13:37] Sasan Goodarzi: problems to solve.
[00:13:38] Sasan Goodarzi: It's really been the success of what Scott created and what we built in over the years.
[00:13:44] Sasan Goodarzi: Is the follow me home thing that Scott invented?
[00:13:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Is that still a thing and into it?
[00:13:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah, it is.
[00:13:50] Sasan Goodarzi: And what we are coupling it with is a couple of things.
[00:13:53] Sasan Goodarzi: One, there's follow me homes and then there's follow me homes.
[00:13:56] Sasan Goodarzi: You can do a follow me home where you're telling the customer, here's what I'm doing,
[00:14:01] Sasan Goodarzi: and just you want confirmation bias.
[00:14:03] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah.
[00:14:04] Sasan Goodarzi: And so we have to have a follow me home, which is a real technique and you're truly there
[00:14:07] Sasan Goodarzi: to observe, learn and try to capture the a-ha's, the surprises, because the big thing we've
[00:14:11] Sasan Goodarzi: learned is customer don't do what they say.
[00:14:15] Yeah.
[00:14:16] Sasan Goodarzi: Right?
[00:14:17] Sasan Goodarzi: And so really we have continued investing like the technique of a follow me home.
[00:14:22] It's a thing, but it's not the biggest thing.
[00:14:25] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:14:26] Sasan Goodarzi: Because before, before data, before we were in the cloud, it was the thing when we were
[00:14:29] Sasan Goodarzi: shipping CDs.
[00:14:30] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah.
[00:14:31] Sasan Goodarzi: And that's coupled with data, right?
[00:14:34] Sasan Goodarzi: And in the world of cloud, you have so much data so you can real time understand and see
[00:14:38] Sasan Goodarzi: what's the customer behavior, what are they doing, why do they get stuck there, why do
[00:14:41] Sasan Goodarzi: they fall off.
[00:14:42] Sasan Goodarzi: And so now we try to couple the two, but it is still a thing.
[00:14:47] Sasan Goodarzi: Our focus is how do you do the thing the right way?
[00:14:49] Sasan Goodarzi: Now, I spend a lot of time, it's quite capital.
[00:14:52] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I spend a lot of time fundraising an HubSpot.
[00:14:54] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Seeing who wrote is allergic to SMBs.
[00:14:56] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Any business SMB, they're allergic to it.
[00:14:58] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Why do you think that is?
[00:15:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And why do you think more companies haven't pulled it off?
[00:15:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I think more companies are successful today serving businesses than they were before.
[00:15:07] Sasan Goodarzi: You all are a great example of that.
[00:15:08] Sasan Goodarzi: Not a lot of examples of them, though.
[00:15:10] Sasan Goodarzi: There's not too many.
[00:15:11] Sasan Goodarzi: There's not too many.
[00:15:12] Sasan Goodarzi: I think it's folks that really understand these are consumers and really focus on what's
[00:15:17] Sasan Goodarzi: that narrow problem that is big enough for the customer that you can go after and get
[00:15:23] Sasan Goodarzi: started.
[00:15:24] Sasan Goodarzi: And one that you actually can build advantage and one that they're willing to pay for.
[00:15:30] Sasan Goodarzi: That sounds, well, of course, everybody needs to do that for any customer problem that
[00:15:34] Sasan Goodarzi: they solve.
[00:15:35] Sasan Goodarzi: But I think most people treat small businesses like their large enterprises because they're
[00:15:41] Sasan Goodarzi: business and the reality is they are absolutely consumers that behave like this.
[00:15:45] Sasan Goodarzi: So I get, follow me home in data on that side.
[00:15:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Talk about just the go-to market and how do you keep the countdown?
[00:15:54] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah.
[00:15:55] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And how do you keep churn from not running away on these small businesses?
[00:15:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Because the unit economics is, I think, something that where so many companies fall down
[00:16:01] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): on small businesses.
[00:16:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's hard.
[00:16:03] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I mean, how do you scale a CAC and get so many customers and then how do you control retention
[00:16:09] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): and up like your gross retention revenue?
[00:16:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's hard.
[00:16:12] Of course.
[00:16:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Let me start there.
[00:16:14] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's really, really hard.
[00:16:15] Sasan Goodarzi: On the CAC side.
[00:16:16] Sasan Goodarzi: I would say two big things.
[00:16:18] Sasan Goodarzi: One is referral and our partners in accountants.
[00:16:22] Sasan Goodarzi: The better of a job that you do serving one business, the word of mouth is huge.
[00:16:27] Sasan Goodarzi: The word of mouth is huge and then accountants recommending it.
[00:16:31] Sasan Goodarzi: And accountants only recommend things that they use, love and recommend.
[00:16:35] Sasan Goodarzi: That's how we've learned to keep the CAC down.
[00:16:37] Sasan Goodarzi: Now what I would tell you is every time we've tried to go into a new country, CAC is very
[00:16:40] Sasan Goodarzi: high.
[00:16:41] Sasan Goodarzi: For exactly that reason, you're trying to get the first customer, get them to, you know,
[00:16:45] Sasan Goodarzi: ward them off the spread, then get an accountants to use it, and then get the accountants,
[00:16:49] Sasan Goodarzi: and then you create that network effect.
[00:16:51] Sasan Goodarzi: And we have found where we can create network effects like we've done it in the US and
[00:16:54] Sasan Goodarzi: Canada and in UK, we can keep the CAC under control, but we don't look at CAC holistically.
[00:17:02] Sasan Goodarzi: We'll look at it based on new product, new markets, held tolerations should be very
[00:17:06] Sasan Goodarzi: different than like in the US where we have a big scale, but that's success is word
[00:17:11] Sasan Goodarzi: of mouth and accounts.
[00:17:12] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:17:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I wanted to do a lot to unpack there.
[00:17:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You do super bowl ads for quick books and things like that.
[00:17:19] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Does that stuff work?
[00:17:20] Yeah.
[00:17:21] Yeah.
[00:17:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): How do you know?
[00:17:23] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yes.
[00:17:24] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We've talked about it in HubSpot.
[00:17:25] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's like, we don't know.
[00:17:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah.
[00:17:27] Sasan Goodarzi: First of all, we started doing them and we primarily, you know, where we've been consistent
[00:17:32] Sasan Goodarzi: is TurboTax.
[00:17:33] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:17:34] Sasan Goodarzi: And you did do quick, you've done quick book.
[00:17:36] Sasan Goodarzi: We have.
[00:17:37] Sasan Goodarzi: And I'm obsessed with quick books on TurboTax.
[00:17:38] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah, of course.
[00:17:39] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): But just in terms of like super bowl ads, our consistency has been TurboTax.
[00:17:45] Sasan Goodarzi: And it absolutely pays off.
[00:17:46] Sasan Goodarzi: So we do a lot of work afterwards in terms of just what was the RI, what were the number
[00:17:52] Sasan Goodarzi: of eyeballs?
[00:17:54] Sasan Goodarzi: What happened to our consideration?
[00:17:55] Sasan Goodarzi: But ultimately conversion.
[00:17:57] Yeah.
[00:17:58] Sasan Goodarzi: Did we get customers to convert and can we associate it back causally to the super bowl?
[00:18:04] Sasan Goodarzi: And I would tell you generally, it's a really been a great ROI.
[00:18:08] Sasan Goodarzi: There's been a couple of years here and there where it's not met our expectations.
[00:18:13] Sasan Goodarzi: But where do you get those kind of eyeballs?
[00:18:16] Okay.
[00:18:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And it can go very wrong if you don't do it right.
[00:18:19] Sasan Goodarzi: It's just back in the fray have a second.
[00:18:21] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And it doesn't go right.
[00:18:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's because the actual ad itself just isn't that good.
[00:18:25] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Is it just very dependent on the quality of the ad you put out there?
[00:18:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It all comes down to the quality and the impact of the ad.
[00:18:30] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Absolutely.
[00:18:31] Sasan Goodarzi: Was it compelling to get into that?
[00:18:33] Sasan Goodarzi: And do you make that decision?
[00:18:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So like lots of people are working on different ad like ideas for it.
[00:18:38] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Are you the final decision?
[00:18:39] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You like you look at seven and you pick it?
[00:18:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): First of all, I have to tell you a story and then I answer your question because the
[00:18:44] Sasan Goodarzi: story is about the super bowl ad.
[00:18:46] Sasan Goodarzi: I remember vividly was a learning that I had when I worked for Brad.
[00:18:49] Sasan Goodarzi: So the first super bowl ad we ran was when I was running TurboTax.
[00:18:53] Sasan Goodarzi: Is that your idea?
[00:18:54] Sasan Goodarzi: It was the team's idea.
[00:18:55] Sasan Goodarzi: No good idea is ever mind.
[00:18:56] Sasan Goodarzi: It's the team's idea.
[00:18:57] Sasan Goodarzi: And so Brad finds out that we're running a super bowl ad.
[00:18:59] Sasan Goodarzi: I never even thought to talk to Brad about hey, we're going to run a super bowl ad.
[00:19:03] Sasan Goodarzi: And so you know how kind Brad as he called me and goes to San.
[00:19:07] I don't need to approve the super bowl ad.
[00:19:09] Sasan Goodarzi: But if you're going to run a super bowl ad like I need to be aware of it because if it
[00:19:12] Sasan Goodarzi: goes sideways.
[00:19:13] Sasan Goodarzi: I don't blame him by the way.
[00:19:15] Sasan Goodarzi: To see you on the board.
[00:19:16] Sasan Goodarzi: I shared that story with you and he was so right.
[00:19:19] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah.
[00:19:20] Sasan Goodarzi: And so yes, I look at it.
[00:19:22] Sasan Goodarzi: The team owns the creativity.
[00:19:24] Sasan Goodarzi: I mean, the biggest thing I've learned about ads is everybody has an opinion.
[00:19:28] Sasan Goodarzi: And most people, it's an end of one are wrong with their opinions.
[00:19:31] Sasan Goodarzi: Even whether they love it or not, you have to have a systematic way in which you don't
[00:19:36] Sasan Goodarzi: pick it.
[00:19:37] Sasan Goodarzi: I don't pick it.
[00:19:38] Sasan Goodarzi: However, I absolutely review it before it goes on.
[00:19:40] Sasan Goodarzi: It's going to go on there.
[00:19:41] Sasan Goodarzi: I review everything that before it goes on air.
[00:19:43] Sasan Goodarzi: The big thing that I'm looking for beyond just how does it sit with me, which is the least
[00:19:47] Sasan Goodarzi: important, but how it sits with me matters is actually I'm looking for reputational risk.
[00:19:51] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah.
[00:19:52] Sasan Goodarzi: Does this pass the bar of who we are as a company, the reputation we need to uphold?
[00:19:58] Sasan Goodarzi: And so that's really what I'm looking for in a super bowl ad.
[00:20:00] Sasan Goodarzi: Of course, I'll give my opinion.
[00:20:02] Sasan Goodarzi: It's not that great or wow, this is amazing, but I'm really looking for the reputational
[00:20:06] Sasan Goodarzi: element.
[00:20:07] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Okay.
[00:20:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Sticking on CAC for just another second.
[00:20:09] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You love CAC, don't you?
[00:20:10] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I do.
[00:20:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's SMB.
[00:20:12] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): How do you scale?
[00:20:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Get a scale.
[00:20:14] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I'm not going to give you my secret.
[00:20:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yes you are.
[00:20:16] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Is it yield NPS?
[00:20:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Is that how you measure word of mouth?
[00:20:19] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Like how do you know if you're getting the word of mouth or not?
[00:20:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's hard to go in the shop and see if Mary's telling Joe that they should use quick
[00:20:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): questions.
[00:20:27] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): 100% yield NPS or something fancy.
[00:20:30] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): There's a few things that we look at.
[00:20:32] Sasan Goodarzi: One, we'll look at product recommendation scores.
[00:20:35] Sasan Goodarzi: That's a big input, but it's just one input.
[00:20:37] Sasan Goodarzi: The other we look at is services because customers may give you one NPS, but if they're
[00:20:43] Sasan Goodarzi: using more and more of your services, then that's a huge indication.
[00:20:48] Sasan Goodarzi: So we'll look at, are they using payments?
[00:20:51] Are they using payroll?
[00:20:52] Sasan Goodarzi: Are they using all of our services?
[00:20:54] Sasan Goodarzi: Are they using more and more of our services?
[00:20:57] Sasan Goodarzi: So that's one thing that we look for.
[00:20:59] Sasan Goodarzi: So it's NPS, it's the number of services.
[00:21:03] Sasan Goodarzi: And then we also have...
[00:21:04] Sasan Goodarzi: And it's a grocery tension, just like how many, the number of logos churning.
[00:21:08] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah, the grocery tension also just retention dollars that we look at.
[00:21:11] Sasan Goodarzi: So we look at three, four things because what we've learned, this is probably the most
[00:21:15] Sasan Goodarzi: important thing that I would pass on to those that listen to.
[00:21:18] Sasan Goodarzi: If you just look at one metric, like our customers recommending, is your NPS high?
[00:21:24] Sasan Goodarzi: You can have a very high NPS and no new customer growth.
[00:21:27] Sasan Goodarzi: So you have to really look at multiple metrics again.
[00:21:30] Sasan Goodarzi: We look at what I just articulated to really get a feel for are the things that we're
[00:21:33] Sasan Goodarzi: doing working or not.
[00:21:34] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:21:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Lots of founders ask me about HubSpot's channel program, which we've lifted a lot of it
[00:21:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): from you guys.
[00:21:43] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And you guys kind of took accountants and turned them into resellers and software companies.
[00:21:48] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We took website designers and turned them into marketing agencies.
[00:21:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Talk to me about your advising a founder.
[00:21:55] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We get, he's growing, doing great.
[00:21:58] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Wants to do a channel program like, how do you do it?
[00:22:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What works?
[00:22:01] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What doesn't work?
[00:22:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): The first piece of advice I would give is, what problem are you trying to solve with
[00:22:06] Sasan Goodarzi: a channel partner before you jump into how do you become great at channel partners?
[00:22:12] Sasan Goodarzi: You know, in our case, really, our biggest partner is our accountants.
[00:22:17] Sasan Goodarzi: And we don't have a bunch of channel partners.
[00:22:19] Sasan Goodarzi: We have developers that will build apps on our platforms.
[00:22:21] Sasan Goodarzi: We have partners, but we don't have the platform to account in channel.
[00:22:24] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah, the accountant channel.
[00:22:25] Sasan Goodarzi: And really, so why the accountant channel for us?
[00:22:28] Sasan Goodarzi: Well, accountants also serve consumers and businesses, right?
[00:22:32] Sasan Goodarzi: They're helping them with their taxes, their books, their accounting advice.
[00:22:37] Sasan Goodarzi: And the larger you are as a business, you may have them take care of your audit.
[00:22:41] Sasan Goodarzi: You may outsource your payroll to them, right?
[00:22:43] Sasan Goodarzi: It depends on who you are and the size of your business.
[00:22:48] Sasan Goodarzi: And they're very influential in what a business uses in every dimension possible.
[00:22:55] Sasan Goodarzi: And so that's a great example of like, well, that's a very important partner.
[00:22:59] Sasan Goodarzi: In fact, one of the big things that we've really evolved in the last years accounts are
[00:23:04] Sasan Goodarzi: very important partners.
[00:23:05] Sasan Goodarzi: They're not, it's not just a channel.
[00:23:07] Sasan Goodarzi: It's not a reseller.
[00:23:08] Sasan Goodarzi: They're like, they're our partner.
[00:23:09] Sasan Goodarzi: And we have to really up our game in terms of how we co-develop with them, how we think
[00:23:14] Sasan Goodarzi: about going to market with them together, how we take their input.
[00:23:17] Sasan Goodarzi: It's an area we had to significantly improve in the last year.
[00:23:21] Sasan Goodarzi: And really to answer your question for us, it was about, well, they play a very
[00:23:25] Sasan Goodarzi: critical role in ultimately what businesses use.
[00:23:29] Sasan Goodarzi: So not only do we have to be great at the products we build for the end business, but
[00:23:33] Sasan Goodarzi: we also have to have a relationship with them and they have to use our stuff, love it,
[00:23:38] Sasan Goodarzi: and then recommended.
[00:23:39] Sasan Goodarzi: And that's the biggest advice I would give when you're thinking about a channel partner,
[00:23:42] Sasan Goodarzi: like, why are you doing it?
[00:23:43] Sasan Goodarzi: Are you doing it because you're trying to manage your CAC?
[00:23:47] And if you're doing that, what does that mean to your overall economics?
[00:23:50] Sasan Goodarzi: Everybody's talking about the reason people want to do is they want to grow faster.
[00:23:52] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah.
[00:23:53] Sasan Goodarzi: And the question though is, you grow faster, but what's the economics look like?
[00:23:58] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah.
[00:23:59] Sasan Goodarzi: And you have to think about those things.
[00:24:00] Sasan Goodarzi: But I would just advise I'd give is be very clear about the problem you're trying to
[00:24:03] Sasan Goodarzi: solve.
[00:24:04] Sasan Goodarzi: And it's okay to throw some stuff at the wall and see what works.
[00:24:06] Sasan Goodarzi: But if you just start with, I need channel partners.
[00:24:08] Sasan Goodarzi: I think you may make the wrong choice.
[00:24:10] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:24:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Let me run some things we've learned about channel partners through HubSpot by you.
[00:24:14] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I'm just curious of it's kind of the same.
[00:24:16] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Okay.
[00:24:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah.
[00:24:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Stuff that worked early was we took website designers to dying business and turn them
[00:24:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): into an agency.
[00:24:23] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And we taught them about this new technology and idea called inbound marketing, which is
[00:24:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): ancient now.
[00:24:29] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And we taught them how to run a proper agency.
[00:24:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Like we ran a little university.
[00:24:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): How do you bill?
[00:24:36] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): How do you charge?
[00:24:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): How do you run your agency?
[00:24:38] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That worked.
[00:24:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Another thing that really worked is once these agencies starting it's signing up lots
[00:24:44] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): of customers, they needed software themselves.
[00:24:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So we funded a development team to help them manage all their customers.
[00:24:50] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That is their own firm.
[00:24:51] Sasan Goodarzi: Right.
[00:24:52] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And when we come to a nonprofit agency, we come to a nonprofit agency, which is really
[00:24:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): really smart.
[00:24:58] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It really is smart.
[00:25:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It really is smart.
[00:25:01] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It really is smart.
[00:25:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It really is smart.
[00:25:04] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It really is smart.
[00:25:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It really is smart.
[00:25:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It really is smart.
[00:25:09] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It really is smart.
[00:25:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): directly from us, you figure it out, we teach you, or is doing it for me, and that's where
[00:25:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): the agencies come in.
[00:25:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And that has worked for us.
[00:25:30] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Does any of that resonate for you?
[00:25:32] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Is that kind of some of the playbook?
[00:25:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Almost all of it, because I could take that same, what you just said, and place it with
[00:25:40] Sasan Goodarzi: accountants.
[00:25:41] Sasan Goodarzi: Right.
[00:25:42] Sasan Goodarzi: That's what I figured.
[00:25:43] Sasan Goodarzi: That's the same exact thing applies.
[00:25:45] Sasan Goodarzi: But I would just ask you, what problem were you trying to solve when you first started
[00:25:49] Sasan Goodarzi: engaging these agencies?
[00:25:50] Sasan Goodarzi: We wanted to grow faster.
[00:25:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Just be very honest, if you wanted to grow faster.
[00:25:54] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I'll tell you a funny story about it.
[00:25:56] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's like two, three years in the HubSpot, and our product was awful, just awful.
[00:26:03] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And we had a few sales reps, and we had a lot of leads from agencies who were curious
[00:26:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): about in that marketing.
[00:26:09] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What's this HubSpot thing we had a lot of buzz.
[00:26:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I told the sales reps, just leave those leads, there's a pile of them over there,
[00:26:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): don't touch them.
[00:26:16] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You know, they sat in HubSpot, don't touch them.
[00:26:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We're not going to do the channel part.
[00:26:19] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): The product's not ready.
[00:26:20] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And they kept asking me, no.
[00:26:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And we had this little bit like Google's 20% time where we say, you do whatever you want
[00:26:27] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): nice weekends.
[00:26:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So this guy, Pete Caputa, a great but really irritating sales rep.
[00:26:32] He started calling them nice weekends.
[00:26:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And then you know, there's a distribution of sales reps.
[00:26:36] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Let's say we had five of them.
[00:26:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And like, as usually a bell curve, art was like, Pete Caputa was like 50 times more
[00:26:42] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): rep than the rest of them.
[00:26:44] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Maybe we ought to call on these agency partners.
[00:26:46] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That's how we started it.
[00:26:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Fascinating.
[00:26:48] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yes.
[00:26:49] Sasan Goodarzi: It's all of the money.
[00:26:50] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Talking to this issue about our agency partners, if we look at our retention numbers,
[00:26:54] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): gross and net, the agency customers have better economic, actually better economics than
[00:26:58] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): our direct customers.
[00:26:59] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Interesting.
[00:27:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They take, actually take better customer care of their, of our customers and we do.
[00:27:03] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): By the way, so many similarities.
[00:27:04] Sasan Goodarzi: Like, for instance, when an accountant recommends a customer to use this particularly like
[00:27:09] Sasan Goodarzi: larger customers that we're now pursuing, that what we call a mid market, the cycle time
[00:27:14] Sasan Goodarzi: with flows is 10 times faster.
[00:27:16] Sasan Goodarzi: And we end up offering more services, payments, payroll to that customer than otherwise.
[00:27:21] Sasan Goodarzi: So there's so many, so many similarities.
[00:27:23] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:27:24] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You guys, founders always asked me to, you add an app.
[00:27:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That was your first act and then you created a suite, second act and then you create a
[00:27:32] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): platform third act.
[00:27:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): How'd you do it?
[00:27:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Give some advice to that founder.
[00:27:36] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): She's got 100 employees.
[00:27:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): She wants to go from first act to second act.
[00:27:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah.
[00:27:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You guys have mastered that.
[00:27:43] Sasan Goodarzi: There's a big part of it as you know, it comes out of necessity, right?
[00:27:47] Sasan Goodarzi: You've solved one problem while accounting and ultimately what you realize is the customer
[00:27:56] Sasan Goodarzi: can be far more, you can deliver far more benefit and be far more sticky if then you actually
[00:28:01] Sasan Goodarzi: help them with creating estimate and then voice and getting paid.
[00:28:04] Sasan Goodarzi: And then the next thing is well, they have employees.
[00:28:07] Sasan Goodarzi: We need the payroll, payroll, etc, etc.
[00:28:10] Sasan Goodarzi: And so how far into like the QuickBooks journey, did you start building other stuff?
[00:28:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Well, early on, but remember, you've been around since the dinosaur ages.
[00:28:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah.
[00:28:23] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Thank you.
[00:28:24] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You said it more directly than I was going to say.
[00:28:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Remember, we used to ship CDs.
[00:28:27] Sasan Goodarzi: And so when we were shipping CDs and we had desktop platform, we had payroll, we had
[00:28:33] Sasan Goodarzi: payments on desktop years ago.
[00:28:35] Sasan Goodarzi: I see.
[00:28:36] Sasan Goodarzi: But then in order to shift from desktop to the cloud, that was a massive transformation
[00:28:40] Sasan Goodarzi: for us as a company because we weren't born in the cloud.
[00:28:43] Sasan Goodarzi: It was a hard one, is that recall?
[00:28:44] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Very hard.
[00:28:45] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): A very hard one.
[00:28:46] Sasan Goodarzi: And by the way, we're, we've shifted to the cloud, but we still have customers on desktop
[00:28:49] Sasan Goodarzi: that were trying to motivate to come to online.
[00:28:53] Sasan Goodarzi: In some cases, they're not very happy with us because they want to remain on desktop.
[00:28:56] Sasan Goodarzi: But the reason I share that with you is that journey from going to desktop to online took
[00:29:00] Sasan Goodarzi: a lot out of the company.
[00:29:02] Sasan Goodarzi: And so when we then shifted to the cloud, we were once again only an accounting platform
[00:29:06] Sasan Goodarzi: because we had to build everything in the cloud.
[00:29:09] Sasan Goodarzi: And then we started building out same journey, money solutions, payroll, et cetera.
[00:29:16] Sasan Goodarzi: So the biggest advice I would give a founder is, first of all, everybody has an anchor.
[00:29:21] Sasan Goodarzi: ours was taxing accounting.
[00:29:23] Sasan Goodarzi: Then the question is, what's the next problem you can solve for that customer?
[00:29:27] Sasan Goodarzi: That's right next to that anchor.
[00:29:28] Sasan Goodarzi: And for us, after accounting, it was, well, people need to, we serve service-based businesses.
[00:29:34] Sasan Goodarzi: They need to create an estimate and then voice and get paid.
[00:29:36] Sasan Goodarzi: So let's build that out.
[00:29:38] Sasan Goodarzi: And then let's build out payroll, which is very hard, right?
[00:29:40] Sasan Goodarzi: Because state, local taxes, country, rules, regulations.
[00:29:45] Sasan Goodarzi: And so it's really be very intentional about what's next to your anchor.
[00:29:50] Sasan Goodarzi: And is that a big enough problem to solve?
[00:29:52] Sasan Goodarzi: Can you build advantage by solving it?
[00:29:55] Sasan Goodarzi: And then really nail that and then go to the next thing.
[00:29:58] Sasan Goodarzi: And then at some point decide, do you partner on certain things until you build it?
[00:30:03] Sasan Goodarzi: Do you acquire, that's why we acquired a credit karma?
[00:30:06] Sasan Goodarzi: We wanted to do more than taxes.
[00:30:08] Sasan Goodarzi: We could have replicated credit karma just taking us five plus years because of the data
[00:30:13] Sasan Goodarzi: and AI capabilities.
[00:30:14] Sasan Goodarzi: So that's the advice I would give.
[00:30:16] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:30:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): This is self-serving.
[00:30:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So we built marketing and then we said we're going to go into sales.
[00:30:21] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We were kind of forced into salesforce.com was coming into marketing.
[00:30:25] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And then we went to service and we added, I think we have eight of these applications.
[00:30:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We always debated.
[00:30:29] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We always knew there was going to be eight.
[00:30:32] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Should we pin better all seven new ones or should we really almost finish the second one
[00:30:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): before we go to the third?
[00:30:38] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): How do you think about second versus third versus like when did you go?
[00:30:42] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So your first one was paying people, right?
[00:30:44] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Payroll?
[00:30:45] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): No, well, it was actually, it was actually creating estimates and invoices.
[00:30:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And then your third one's payroll.
[00:30:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): When did you go to, when did you go through?
[00:30:53] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What was it like?
[00:30:54] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Do you look at market share before you go where?
[00:30:56] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So this is a great question because I now want to go back to your first question you
[00:31:00] Sasan Goodarzi: asked me, which is playbook of CEOs or playbook of any leader.
[00:31:05] Sasan Goodarzi: I think that playbook is very different today.
[00:31:07] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:31:08] Sasan Goodarzi: Then it was when you were looking at things seriously to decide what's next.
[00:31:13] Sasan Goodarzi: I mean, today, you know this is well as I.
[00:31:16] Sasan Goodarzi: With data and AI, what we're trying to do is build a system of intelligence where it's
[00:31:20] Sasan Goodarzi: no longer about what workflow do I build, what app do I build.
[00:31:24] Sasan Goodarzi: It's actually about learning from the customer and with our data and AI capabilities, solving
[00:31:29] Sasan Goodarzi: that problem for the customer.
[00:31:31] Sasan Goodarzi: That's really important because I don't think things are serial today than they were years
[00:31:35] Sasan Goodarzi: ago.
[00:31:36] Sasan Goodarzi: You can also build much faster now.
[00:31:37] Sasan Goodarzi: You can build much faster.
[00:31:38] Sasan Goodarzi: You don't need to be as serial as long as by the way you have some elements of data and
[00:31:41] Sasan Goodarzi: AI capability.
[00:31:42] Sasan Goodarzi: So I just think that playbook is very, very different today than it was four or five years
[00:31:48] Sasan Goodarzi: ago.
[00:31:49] Sasan Goodarzi: But the thing that doesn't change in my view is being clear.
[00:31:53] What customer problem are you trying to solve is that a big enough problem for the customer.
[00:31:58] Sasan Goodarzi: And can you solve it in a way where your advantage versus others and you know, they can get
[00:32:03] Sasan Goodarzi: big.
[00:32:04] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Let me press in this a little bit.
[00:32:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I mean, put the clock back.
[00:32:07] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I don't know what year called 2020.
[00:32:10] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Your back office.
[00:32:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We just the canonical small business back office.
[00:32:14] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And then we're going to buy a meal chip in front office.
[00:32:16] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I remember that very well.
[00:32:19] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And that decision at that point time was that because man, we've got 90 freaking percent
[00:32:24] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): of the SMB back office.
[00:32:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We better go in the front office.
[00:32:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We're almost done with these applications.
[00:32:31] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Like, talk to me about that.
[00:32:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): When we observed customers and their data, they had created our customers, had created
[00:32:38] Sasan Goodarzi: 20 billion records within our QuickBooks platform, trying to manage their customers within
[00:32:44] Sasan Goodarzi: QuickBooks.
[00:32:45] Sasan Goodarzi: So they were creating shit.
[00:32:47] Sasan Goodarzi: They were using QuickBooks as their secret.
[00:32:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And so what we realized is we have to solve this problem because customers are manually creating
[00:32:54] Sasan Goodarzi: a bunch of records because they don't want to use multiple different platforms.
[00:32:58] Sasan Goodarzi: And sort of back to, can we build it?
[00:33:00] Sasan Goodarzi: Of course, is this where we want to put our internal capital?
[00:33:04] Sasan Goodarzi: Do we have the know how the domain X for dessert you go buy it?
[00:33:07] Sasan Goodarzi: Yes.
[00:33:08] Sasan Goodarzi: What we let to buying milk.
[00:33:09] Okay.
[00:33:10] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Got it.
[00:33:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You've made a lot of acquisition.
[00:33:12] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Not a lot.
[00:33:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You made a bunch.
[00:33:14] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Some have been real dogs.
[00:33:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Some have been terrific.
[00:33:16] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We don't have the name names.
[00:33:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And like HubSpots, we've started it, made by a bunch of companies.
[00:33:21] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What advice would you give HubSpot and an ECO about, you know, the lemon, the one that
[00:33:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): did work versus this work?
[00:33:27] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Is there some best practices or some things you've learned about how to do them?
[00:33:31] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): 100%.
[00:33:32] Sasan Goodarzi: Well, let's just put to this side, the foundational stuff, which is you've done your homework.
[00:33:37] There's real clarity of strategically why you're doing it.
[00:33:40] Sasan Goodarzi: You understand the culture that you're buying.
[00:33:42] Sasan Goodarzi: You have a plan around that you've done your delete.
[00:33:44] Sasan Goodarzi: Like let's put all that to the side because that's really foundational.
[00:33:47] Sasan Goodarzi: The two big things that we've learned is the pace of product integration and talent.
[00:33:53] Sasan Goodarzi: Where we moved fast on integrating the platform, I would use TurboTax and credit karma.
[00:34:00] Sasan Goodarzi: I mean, credit karma is an absolute home run.
[00:34:03] Sasan Goodarzi: Where we move fast to know what problems we're going to solve and integrate the product
[00:34:06] Sasan Goodarzi: so we can get to benefit for customers, which by the way, translates into growth.
[00:34:11] And then where we need it to either upgrade talent or make talent changes, when we do
[00:34:16] Sasan Goodarzi: those two things well, what we've seen is, and by the way, little acquisitions that nobody
[00:34:20] Sasan Goodarzi: asks about, and then there's the big ones, right?
[00:34:22] Sasan Goodarzi: Credit karma and MailChimp.
[00:34:23] Sasan Goodarzi: Did you leave the CEOs in place and leave them independent or you put your people in
[00:34:28] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): the...
[00:34:29] Sasan Goodarzi: It was situational.
[00:34:30] Sasan Goodarzi: Like in the case of credit karma, it's situational.
[00:34:32] Sasan Goodarzi: Ken and I had a great relationship.
[00:34:34] Sasan Goodarzi: He wanted the Continuity BCO, very effective CEO, and he and his team were in place for
[00:34:40] Sasan Goodarzi: quite some time.
[00:34:41] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:34:42] Sasan Goodarzi: Whereas in the case of MailChimp, Ben actually told us and told me from day one, we got
[00:34:48] Sasan Goodarzi: to upgrade the leadership team.
[00:34:50] Sasan Goodarzi: So you put your folks in there.
[00:34:52] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That's right.
[00:34:53] Sasan Goodarzi: But back to your question, it's product integration and it's talent.
[00:34:57] Sasan Goodarzi: Those make an enormous difference in terms of success.
[00:35:00] Sasan Goodarzi: And making the tough decisions up front is far better than waiting.
[00:35:05] Okay.
[00:35:06] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I want to come back to something you talked about earlier.
[00:35:09] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You guys have been around a while.
[00:35:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You were desktop software and then you had to transcend.
[00:35:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I think it was like client server and then went to SAS.
[00:35:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I went to AI.
[00:35:19] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We're kind of on a big shift now.
[00:35:21] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You were one of few companies that made that shift pretty well.
[00:35:24] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Adobe and SAP, not a lot of companies, made that shift from client software to SAS.
[00:35:31] What did you do right there?
[00:35:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Did you wait too long?
[00:35:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Were you too fast?
[00:35:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Like when you look at that shift back then.
[00:35:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): My sense was you moved to SAS actually kind of slow.
[00:35:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): First of all, your premise of your question is a really important one,
[00:35:44] Sasan Goodarzi: which is we were born 40 some odd years ago in the era of DOS.
[00:35:48] Sasan Goodarzi: Right.
[00:35:49] Right.
[00:35:50] Sasan Goodarzi: Which makes it even more impressive how well you guys have done.
[00:35:53] Sasan Goodarzi: And I would just say our success is when we were always in love with the customer problem
[00:35:57] Sasan Goodarzi: and always willing to disrupt ourselves.
[00:36:00] Sasan Goodarzi: And that's so much easier said than done, by the way, so much easier said than done.
[00:36:04] Sasan Goodarzi: But that's why we're still around.
[00:36:06] Sasan Goodarzi: And it's also why we were absolutely slow to move to SAS.
[00:36:10] Sasan Goodarzi: We were probably four to five years to slow.
[00:36:12] Sasan Goodarzi: But your customers weren't asking for SAS.
[00:36:14] Sasan Goodarzi: Customers weren't asking for it.
[00:36:15] Sasan Goodarzi: They absolutely didn't want to move to the cloud.
[00:36:18] Sasan Goodarzi: And as much as we are a culture of disruption, that's a very hard move to make.
[00:36:23] Sasan Goodarzi: Did you rebuild from scratch?
[00:36:26] Sasan Goodarzi: In many cases, we had to rebuild from scratch.
[00:36:27] Sasan Goodarzi: And they're service.
[00:36:28] Sasan Goodarzi: But remember, it's even harder than the way you're asking the question.
[00:36:33] Sasan Goodarzi: We were a desktop company.
[00:36:34] Sasan Goodarzi: We had all of our data was siloed across turbo tax, across accounting, across back then
[00:36:39] Sasan Goodarzi: when we had payroll payments on every bunch of siloed vertical stacks and data.
[00:36:45] Sasan Goodarzi: It was mess to move to the cloud.
[00:36:48] Sasan Goodarzi: It wasn't a mess the way we were running it.
[00:36:50] Sasan Goodarzi: But to move to become SAS, that's like, that is so hard to do, which is why we were slow.
[00:36:54] Sasan Goodarzi: Because it was more technological problem or business model problem.
[00:36:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): This model was totally changed.
[00:36:58] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Culture, talent.
[00:36:59] Sasan Goodarzi: Interesting.
[00:37:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Business model.
[00:37:01] It's everything.
[00:37:02] Sasan Goodarzi: Got it.
[00:37:03] Sasan Goodarzi: That's why you can look back and go while we were slow.
[00:37:07] But when you're in it, what we had to do was you follow the customer home.
[00:37:10] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They're not going to tell you to make a platform shift.
[00:37:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Of course.
[00:37:12] Sasan Goodarzi: But if you want to keep growing, you have to make a platform shift.
[00:37:15] Sasan Goodarzi: So yes, we were slow.
[00:37:17] Sasan Goodarzi: But the degree of difficulty was very high.
[00:37:20] Sasan Goodarzi: I would say we were on reverse.
[00:37:22] Sasan Goodarzi: We were very early in AI.
[00:37:23] Sasan Goodarzi: I agree.
[00:37:24] Which is hard to talk to me about that.
[00:37:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What's going on now for you on that shift?
[00:37:29] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Why were you were like, we're an AI company in like, 2008, a long time ago.
[00:37:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Way before it was cool.
[00:37:37] Were you too early?
[00:37:39] Sasan Goodarzi: I would tell you, looking back, we absolutely weren't too early.
[00:37:42] Sasan Goodarzi: We're not.
[00:37:43] Sasan Goodarzi: We're not.
[00:37:44] Sasan Goodarzi: I'm glad we declared.
[00:37:45] Sasan Goodarzi: But you did all say, did any of it really work in 2008?
[00:37:48] Sasan Goodarzi: Well, let me first tell you why.
[00:37:50] Sasan Goodarzi: And then I'll answer your question.
[00:37:52] Sasan Goodarzi: We did it for very practical reasons.
[00:37:54] Sasan Goodarzi: When I stepped into this role because I had the privilege of being in all the businesses
[00:37:58] Sasan Goodarzi: serving all the different customers, there are two big things that we put in place six
[00:38:02] Sasan Goodarzi: and a half years ago.
[00:38:03] Sasan Goodarzi: One was we have to solve more problems in tax and accounting.
[00:38:07] Sasan Goodarzi: And we have to become a platform so we can play a meaningful role in the lives of consumers
[00:38:11] Sasan Goodarzi: and businesses.
[00:38:12] Sasan Goodarzi: That was one big decision.
[00:38:13] Sasan Goodarzi: We didn't know how, but that was one big strategic decision.
[00:38:17] Sasan Goodarzi: The other big strategic decision was data and AI for very practical reasons.
[00:38:21] Sasan Goodarzi: Because the biggest thing I learned being in all these businesses is consumers and businesses
[00:38:25] Sasan Goodarzi: want things done for them.
[00:38:27] Sasan Goodarzi: It's money, it's confidence, get my stuff done for me, second manage, focus on my business
[00:38:32] Sasan Goodarzi: or my life as a consumer.
[00:38:35] Sasan Goodarzi: So we said the only way we could do that was data and AI.
[00:38:38] Sasan Goodarzi: And that was the second big decision.
[00:38:41] Sasan Goodarzi: And to your question level, were you too early declaring it a big heavy lift was all the
[00:38:44] Sasan Goodarzi: work we did around data and data services, like cleaning the data, making sure it's usable,
[00:38:48] Sasan Goodarzi: making sure we can ingest data.
[00:38:50] Sasan Goodarzi: So it's actually teaking on you already.
[00:38:52] Yeah, the AI part was actually the easier part.
[00:38:54] Sasan Goodarzi: The harder part is all the data.
[00:38:56] Sasan Goodarzi: And now that it's usable and all the services we have to ingest data, that's why I'm glad
[00:39:01] Sasan Goodarzi: we started six and a half years ago because now we're far better positioned for what
[00:39:04] Sasan Goodarzi: we're doing today in the future.
[00:39:06] Sasan Goodarzi: And when you think of it, are you infusing AI into your current platform or are you saying,
[00:39:12] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): hey, we're going to start from a blank sheet of paper and build an AI native version
[00:39:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): of QuickBooks.
[00:39:18] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I would say both.
[00:39:20] Sasan Goodarzi: Everything and I get asked a lot.
[00:39:21] Sasan Goodarzi: So what's your AI revenues?
[00:39:24] Sasan Goodarzi: The whole company is sits on our data and AI platform, like everything from payments
[00:39:28] Sasan Goodarzi: to payroll, the tax, everything sits on our data layer, data models and our AI platform.
[00:39:35] Sasan Goodarzi: So that's sort of number one.
[00:39:36] Sasan Goodarzi: Number two, one of the things we launched in July of this year is a virtual team of AI
[00:39:41] Sasan Goodarzi: agents to do a lot of the work for you.
[00:39:43] Sasan Goodarzi: A lot of that is AI native.
[00:39:45] Sasan Goodarzi: You're going to put the account inside of business to buy doing that?
[00:39:48] Sasan Goodarzi: No, we're actually our focus is how do we fuel their success.
[00:39:51] Sasan Goodarzi: And we're also very transparent with accounts, which is if you only have 50 customers and
[00:39:56] Sasan Goodarzi: all you do is tax, you should really be part of our platform, our expert platform because
[00:40:03] Sasan Goodarzi: with technology and the supply issues, it's going to be tough as you look ahead.
[00:40:08] Sasan Goodarzi: So we're trying to fuel their success, but we're also partnering with the large firms
[00:40:10] Sasan Goodarzi: to really fuel their success because they're trying to digitize, they want efficiency,
[00:40:14] Sasan Goodarzi: they want to improve profitability, particularly the PE back firms.
[00:40:17] Sasan Goodarzi: Our goal is partnership because we believe in AI plus HI.
[00:40:20] Sasan Goodarzi: We think human intelligence is essential for today and the future.
[00:40:24] Sasan Goodarzi: Our focus is everything needs to be done for you.
[00:40:27] Sasan Goodarzi: How do we deliver experiences that's done for you versus building more workflows and
[00:40:31] Sasan Goodarzi: designing more products?
[00:40:32] Sasan Goodarzi: Yep.
[00:40:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Okay.
[00:40:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We only have a couple minutes left.
[00:40:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I have a thousand more questions, by the way.
[00:40:36] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They coach all these CEOs of Schmort.
[00:40:39] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They're hungry.
[00:40:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They're between 10 and call it 500 employees.
[00:40:43] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And they want to go from like start up founder to scale up CEO.
[00:40:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What CEO advice would you give to these people?
[00:40:50] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That's a loaded question.
[00:40:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You're smart guy.
[00:40:52] Sasan Goodarzi: I would say really focus on winning.
[00:40:56] These jobs are hard.
[00:40:58] Sasan Goodarzi: You know, I do like your job.
[00:41:00] Sasan Goodarzi: No, I love winning.
[00:41:01] Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah.
[00:41:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Is the day to day do you enjoy it?
[00:41:04] Sasan Goodarzi: There are a lot of days where I'm like that was no.
[00:41:07] Sasan Goodarzi: Yes.
[00:41:08] Sasan Goodarzi: I'm not solving for joy.
[00:41:09] Sasan Goodarzi: I think that's the advice I would give is if you're solving for just following your
[00:41:13] Sasan Goodarzi: passion and defining how the day went by joy and happiness, you're not going to succeed
[00:41:19] Sasan Goodarzi: in this world.
[00:41:21] Sasan Goodarzi: As a CEO or not a CEO.
[00:41:22] Sasan Goodarzi: So the advice I would give is focus on the customer and focus on winning.
[00:41:27] Sasan Goodarzi: These jobs are hard.
[00:41:28] Sasan Goodarzi: Be prepared.
[00:41:29] Sasan Goodarzi: Right.
[00:41:30] Sasan Goodarzi: If you want to do this job, you got to have grit.
[00:41:31] Sasan Goodarzi: You got to work hard.
[00:41:32] Sasan Goodarzi: You got to have resilience.
[00:41:33] Sasan Goodarzi: You got to understand that most days you're not.
[00:41:36] Sasan Goodarzi: It's not about passion.
[00:41:37] Sasan Goodarzi: It's not about joy.
[00:41:38] Sasan Goodarzi: It's about winning.
[00:41:39] Sasan Goodarzi: And what we do is very hard.
[00:41:40] Sasan Goodarzi: And I just think the mental toughness, I think talent is overrated.
[00:41:43] Sasan Goodarzi: Okay.
[00:41:44] I think it's all about grit and it's all about hard work.
[00:41:47] Sasan Goodarzi: I will take anyone that has grit and hard work versus how do you know someone see a year
[00:41:52] Sasan Goodarzi: interview and someone?
[00:41:53] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): How do you know if they get grit and hard work?
[00:41:55] Sasan Goodarzi: Just you know what?
[00:41:56] Sasan Goodarzi: I there's one of the things we have is one over one approval.
[00:42:00] Sasan Goodarzi: Most of if my team is going to hire anyone, ultimately I interview them.
[00:42:05] Sasan Goodarzi: And more than 50% of time I go back to them and say, I don't think this is the right
[00:42:07] Sasan Goodarzi: person.
[00:42:08] Sasan Goodarzi: Grit.
[00:42:09] Sasan Goodarzi: Because it's just it's the grit.
[00:42:10] Sasan Goodarzi: It's the hunger.
[00:42:11] Sasan Goodarzi: It's the passion.
[00:42:12] Sasan Goodarzi: You know, sometimes what do you have someone to figure that out?
[00:42:14] Sasan Goodarzi: I figure it out in the conversation.
[00:42:17] Sasan Goodarzi: You can smell if somebody's hungry, if they have grit, if they have perseverance.
[00:42:21] Sasan Goodarzi: And I think that's what it takes to do this job back to your question is the biggest advice
[00:42:25] Sasan Goodarzi: I'd give CEOs is don't lose sight of the prize and it's hard.
[00:42:29] Sasan Goodarzi: Get after it.
[00:42:30] Sasan Goodarzi: Outwork everyone.
[00:42:31] Sasan Goodarzi: Have grit.
[00:42:32] Sasan Goodarzi: And if you fail, figure out how to get up and bounce back and you'll achieve great things
[00:42:36] Sasan Goodarzi: in life.
[00:42:37] Sasan Goodarzi: It may not be that CEO gig, but you'll achieve great things in life.
[00:42:39] Sasan Goodarzi: So advice I give my kids.
[00:42:41] You've done an amazing job here and into it.
[00:42:43] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You've done an amazing job in this podcast.
[00:42:45] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Thank you for sharing all your knowledge.
[00:42:46] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Your legend.
[00:42:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Appreciate you.
[00:42:48] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Thank you, my friend.
[00:42:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Thank you.
[00:42:50] Okay.
[00:42:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Hope you like that interview with Sassan.
[00:42:53] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I really enjoyed it.
[00:42:54] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): A couple of high level things.
[00:42:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Both Sassan and his predecessor Brad Smith are very polished and very smooth and they
[00:43:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): kind of rhyme with a couple of other folks have had on the pod.
[00:43:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): David Solomon from Goldman and the Kesher Roar from Palo Alto.
[00:43:12] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It seems like that's sort of a common thread amongst the CEOs who have been hired in to
[00:43:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): replace the founder and a company.
[00:43:20] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Kind of interesting that they have that common.
[00:43:23] Another thought like I spent that day with Brad Smith, their CEO a few years ago.
[00:43:30] Just my suggestion to all of you listening if you're a CEO or you want to be a CEO, that
[00:43:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): really worked and was really helpful to me.
[00:43:39] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So if you know a CEO and you admire them, ask, hey, can I come in and sit with you for
[00:43:44] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): a day and sit through your meetings.
[00:43:46] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): But very worse thing that can happen is a CEO is very flattered and says no.
[00:43:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And so you kind of win either way.
[00:43:52] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): He asked a good question of himself every six months.
[00:43:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): He asked himself the question, if I joined the company today from the outside, what changes
[00:44:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): would I make?
[00:44:03] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And that's the question I always said I was asked myself at HubSpot and I rarely did
[00:44:07] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): it.
[00:44:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That stuck with you, I recommend you do it.
[00:44:10] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I like that he and almost everyone have talked to is gets on the coal face with the customers.
[00:44:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Like gets on support calls, goes and talks to customers, follows them home.
[00:44:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I think way kills a lot of startups kind of between 100 and 1000 employees is you get
[00:44:27] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): some layers in there and you get all the feedback filtered and you lose that sort of coal face
[00:44:32] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): touch with the customers.
[00:44:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): One thing he talked about was this follow me home concept and it's at least it used to
[00:44:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): be.
[00:44:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's a famous concept in my mind where the founder of into it they sell to very small business
[00:44:46] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): and people typically run them out of their home.
[00:44:48] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So he would go to someone's home and watch them do all their paperwork and watch them
[00:44:52] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): do all their accounting and see how frustrating it was and then kind of build from them.
[00:44:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That was his sort of secret sauce.
[00:45:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And almost every CEO I speak with is really obsessed with understanding the customer.
[00:45:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): When I think people get in trouble with now is they look at the analytics for the customer
[00:45:10] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): and they can see usage data and everything's very wired up quite nicely for the CEO to
[00:45:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): see.
[00:45:16] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): But I think you miss something when you don't actually do that follow me home because when
[00:45:21] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): you do the follow me home and you sit with virtually or not that end user, you can see
[00:45:27] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): not just what they're using, but where are they cutting and pasting into other things
[00:45:30] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): and where's the messiness in the process.
[00:45:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I see a lot of CEOs are getting away from that.
[00:45:36] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I would encourage you all to say there.
[00:45:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I think a very common cause of death for companies going from 100 to 1000 employees is they
[00:45:44] kind of lose that coal face with the customer.
[00:45:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They get their information filtered heavily by their by their staff.
[00:45:52] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They get reporting from analytics apps, but they don't actually talk to those customers
[00:45:56] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): and they don't make their senior team talk to those customers.
[00:45:59] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So I think that's key.
[00:46:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Then we talked about the SMB segment and we have this in common within to it, although
[00:46:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): we sell more to M than S than they do.
[00:46:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What he says about S I think is right is you can't treat them like many enterprises.
[00:46:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You have to treat them like consumers like the individual is like a consumer product.
[00:46:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You have to build it that way.
[00:46:19] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And it's a different mindset and it's very easy to get talked into building all kinds
[00:46:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): of other stuff for many enterprises.
[00:46:25] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So I like that they did that.
[00:46:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): The key in SMB is to keep your cat low.
[00:46:29] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): If your cat is relying on Facebook ads or whatever advertising model, it's very hard
[00:46:34] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): to scale that.
[00:46:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I like that they focused on that.
[00:46:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They work through channels.
[00:46:38] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They were obsessive about word of mouth and net promoter score.
[00:46:41] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So I like that a lot.
[00:46:43] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And the other thing you have to do if you want to build an SMB business is you need a really
[00:46:47] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): solid LTV.
[00:46:48] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): You're going to have churn.
[00:46:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Some of these folks are going to go out of business.
[00:46:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I like how spot will lose.
[00:46:53] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Call it 11%.
[00:46:54] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So we start the over the hundred dollars and then we end the year actually with $89.
[00:46:59] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): But then we upsell them up to $203 and $104.
[00:47:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So you have to be able to fill that divot with your best customer buying more stuff.
[00:47:07] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So I think they've kind of got it down how you build an SMB business.
[00:47:10] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I think more companies should go after this target.
[00:47:13] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): There's just like gravity on San Toro that everyone wants to go to the enterprise.
[00:47:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): But if you can think it through, man, you can build a huge business in SMB.
[00:47:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They've come from spot into it, Shopify, they're all cranking, okay, we talked about second
[00:47:26] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): apps and platforms and lots of founders asked me about this, a lot of companies died because
[00:47:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): they can never figure that second act out.
[00:47:35] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I kind of always thought of it in HubSpot, either you build a platform, or you get eaten
[00:47:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): by a platform, and so we ended up building a platform, what they did and HubSpot did
[00:47:45] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): is they had their first app was accounting, and the second app, which just right next
[00:47:50] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): to it, was invoicing.
[00:47:51] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So they didn't go way into HR or something like that.
[00:47:54] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): We're going to do invoicing.
[00:47:55] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So that was the first act, second act.
[00:47:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And then after a while, they went into payroll, which
[00:48:01] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): is a little further away.
[00:48:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They're pretty close to that.
[00:48:03] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So when you're building a second act,
[00:48:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): keep it tight, keep it close.
[00:48:06] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Very helpful if it's the same buyer who's
[00:48:09] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): buying both of those products, not always the case
[00:48:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): and hard to find that, but really important.
[00:48:14] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And then the other thing I would say
[00:48:15] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): is as you're going to your third act,
[00:48:17] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I think you want to be a little bit more
[00:48:19] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): serial than parallel in the way you think about this stuff.
[00:48:22] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): So you build your first act.
[00:48:24] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And then instead of doing second, third, fourth
[00:48:25] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): act and peanut buttering it, really
[00:48:27] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): go after that second act and get to table states on there
[00:48:30] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): before you go to your third act, your fourth act, et cetera.
[00:48:33] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I really like Sassan's hiring criteria, grit.
[00:48:37] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It's the first time I've interviewed 9 or 10 of these really
[00:48:40] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): terrific CEOs and no one said that before.
[00:48:42] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): It reminds me of Sequoias hiring criteria for entrepreneurs.
[00:48:46] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): They look for that chip on the shoulder.
[00:48:48] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I don't think they always get it.
[00:48:49] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Pretty much.
[00:48:50] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And so he looks for that.
[00:48:53] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And most founders are telling me these days
[00:48:55] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): we're looking for slope or we're looking for experience.
[00:48:57] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): But I like his grit.
[00:48:59] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What's your hiring criteria?
[00:49:00] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): What's your through line for all your
[00:49:02] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): execs you're hiring?
[00:49:03] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): That's a good question to ask yourself.
[00:49:05] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): Okay, those are my my take sons Sassan.
[00:49:08] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): I think there's a lot there.
[00:49:10] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I hope you enjoyed it.
[00:49:11] Unknown (Likely Host from Sequoia Capital): And I'll see you on the next one.
