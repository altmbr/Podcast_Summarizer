[00:00:00] 0.5% of the world can even code, and much fewer can build a great product like
[00:00:05] Anton Osika: Maltini's co-founder, right? So I decided let's build something for the 99%
[00:00:10] Anton Osika: and not this productivity boost for developers, and that's going to be a completely new type
[00:00:15] Anton Osika: of interface. So here we don't give any timelines, we do research initiatives beyond the plan,
[00:00:20] Mati Staniszewski: we need to stay nimble that like the moment it comes out, you have 24 hours to start
[00:00:25] Mati Staniszewski: integrating that into your product, that's like the most important time to really be ahead.
[00:00:30] 0.5% of the world can be done by using the
[00:00:33] Maltini's co-founder, right?
[00:00:36] 0.5% of the world can be done by using the
[00:00:40] Maltini's co-founder, right?
[00:00:47] Okay this is a real treat. I interviewed two friends of mine, Mati from 11 Labs in Anton
[00:00:54] Brian Halligan: from Lovable, two terrific CEOs and companies that are absolutely ripping, and they're both
[00:01:00] Brian Halligan: doing it from e-old Europe. So we're going to get into it on the Europe thing, but there's some
[00:01:05] Brian Halligan: topics that are just terrific. These two are kind of blossoming before our eyes, they're
[00:01:10] Brian Halligan: right in the heart of hyper growth, and we get to see like how do they think about co-founders,
[00:01:16] Brian Halligan: how they're thinking about delegation and letting go, how they're thinking about building their
[00:01:20] Brian Halligan: exec teams, managing all the chaos coming in at them when you're in hyper growth, there's just a
[00:01:25] Brian Halligan: lot of chaos, and really just pushing to keep the speed up. It's a really good episode, I hope you
[00:01:30] Brian Halligan: enjoy it, and I'll be back at the end with my takes. Okay, you two are in your early 30s, similar ages.
[00:01:40] Brian Halligan: You've got some very good experience under your belt. A lot of founders I'm meeting, and a lot of
[00:01:46] Brian Halligan: founders are getting funded, are rate in school, rate out of school, 21, 22. What would your
[00:01:51] companies be like if you had started them when you were 21 or 22? I'll let you go. Well, I think
[00:01:57] Mati Staniszewski: a thing would have been hard. I think it still would have the pleasure of working with
[00:02:02] Mati Staniszewski: Michael Futter, I know him in his high school. Okay. So we always wear best friends, we did
[00:02:06] Mati Staniszewski: everything together. This is Mati from 11 Labs. Exactly, so I'm working across voice AI research
[00:02:14] Mati Staniszewski: and probably deployment. We are in the mission to create a voice of technology. So I think I still
[00:02:18] Mati Staniszewski: would have started with that of Michael Funder, which would have been the advantage. That this
[00:02:22] Mati Staniszewski: advantage is I don't know how I would approach the first customers, how the world, like at the time,
[00:02:28] Mati Staniszewski: I didn't even know the world of entrepreneurship existed. So I study mathematics. When you study
[00:02:33] Mati Staniszewski: mathematics, the clear career paths you take is either finance or consulting, I chose finance,
[00:02:38] Mati Staniszewski: I joined BlackRock. And then of the only after BlackRock, I learned about Pantir and decided to
[00:02:44] Mati Staniszewski: join them where it turned out you can actually be deployed of the customer, learn about the problems,
[00:02:48] Mati Staniszewski: try to understand those problems and bring them back and build the product, which was like the first
[00:02:52] Mati Staniszewski: glimpse into how to build something, Grump Scratch. But before that, that was still some further out
[00:02:58] Mati Staniszewski: if I didn't know how to approach. So I don't think I would be able to understand the first early
[00:03:03] Mati Staniszewski: dynamics of starting something in the same way. Okay, your several hundred million in revenue,
[00:03:08] Brian Halligan: if you would start a radar school with your body, where would you be?
[00:03:14] Nowhere? You know, the other thing, I think we would have probably worked on a very different idea.
[00:03:19] Mati Staniszewski: I think it took the of course the pleasure of having the Cofunder I know and inside out.
[00:03:25] Mati Staniszewski: Then over the years, got experience of working at other companies which helped us understand
[00:03:30] Mati Staniszewski: some of the dynamics, your sort of Google's, that Pantir, so we understand how to build things at
[00:03:33] Mati Staniszewski: scale. But then the first thing, which I think was the most important was the idea. And of course,
[00:03:37] Mati Staniszewski: through the years, we looked into different projects from trying to build a crypto risk analyzer
[00:03:43] Mati Staniszewski: during the crypto days, which was really hard to recommendation system. But then when we stumbled
[00:03:48] Mati Staniszewski: on voice, we knew that, A, this is a good timing where the technology is going for the shift, we
[00:03:53] Mati Staniszewski: can be part of that shift of that technology. And then two, this is a huge problem that the problem,
[00:03:59] Mati Staniszewski: that the user is the world have and we can solve it. If I started something on 21, 22, I just don't
[00:04:05] Mati Staniszewski: think we would work on the same idea and probably I wouldn't understand the pain the same way we do
[00:04:10] Mati Staniszewski: now that we approach voice. Anton, lovable, also on fire. You were started this company
[00:04:16] Brian Halligan: where at school, what would it be like? I also think it might have not been as ambitious because,
[00:04:23] Anton Osika: I mean, I had never done something entrepreneurial. And the biggest disadvantage, that young would
[00:04:30] Anton Osika: have been that I wouldn't know why to hire very senior engineers and what type of great senior
[00:04:37] Anton Osika: engineers are out there because they don't want to, they will be very scared of working for me.
[00:04:42] Anton Osika: But I think I would have a lot of other advantages, maybe even be more naive. And
[00:04:48] Anton Osika: I already done, I think, as around myself by super, super smart people. So I think I could have
[00:04:54] Anton Osika: built something very different, fast-paced, racial-based. I had a bit of a success.
[00:04:59] Anton Osika: And I got a little bit of what you took from Palantir. You had some very interesting experiences
[00:05:04] Brian Halligan: before lovable. You talked a little bit about them and what kind of you took from those that you're
[00:05:09] Brian Halligan: leveraging at lovable? Yeah, sure. So if you go away, I also studied like sciences and physics
[00:05:16] Anton Osika: specifically. When I was a, I was in this long internship, but CERN, where I, and CERN,
[00:05:22] Anton Osika: a CERN, particle physics, and where they discovered a lot of recent physics, but there's a lot of
[00:05:29] Anton Osika: smart people there. And I was like, wait, they're all working on these impossible problems without
[00:05:33] Anton Osika: any elasticity. So I'm not going to be here. I'm going to go applying great innovation to the real world.
[00:05:41] Anton Osika: And then I was kind of inspired to start a company when I was in university, which I'm very happy
[00:05:49] Anton Osika: about. But I ended up doing some finance, actually. Unfortunately, unfortunately. I wish I was a bit
[00:05:58] Anton Osika: too boring for me. But fortunately, I started this community Stockholm AI. When this was around,
[00:06:04] Anton Osika: when deep learning was like taking off in 2015, 2016. And I did the foundation models of
[00:06:11] Anton Osika: Australian current, like large, small language models before it was called and met great people
[00:06:17] Anton Osika: there. And one was the founder, Sona, so Joel, who recently sold the Sona to work day for a
[00:06:23] Anton Osika: billion dollars. Congratulations. Yes, great job by the team there. My contribution was bringing
[00:06:28] Anton Osika: in some of those smart people that went on to grow it to what it became. And I was there for three
[00:06:34] Anton Osika: years. And it was like, oh, AI, let's build it. You were super young. But we learned to
[00:06:42] Anton Osika: be fast and it became successful. Then I joined as a co-founder at a company that just got into YC.
[00:06:49] Anton Osika: And that was in recommendation systems, specifically for e-commerce. That could have been
[00:06:54] Anton Osika: absolutely widely successful. That can't be. It had a lot of things going for it. But
[00:07:00] Anton Osika: after a bit of momentum loss and my co-founder and me being, I wanted the people to do something
[00:07:08] Anton Osika: more successful. And I can say, not neco-mars. But I decided to do the most possible ambitious thing.
[00:07:16] Anton Osika: And all my life, I'd been approached by people who want to find a great engineer to help them
[00:07:25] Anton Osika: realize their dreams or their ideas. The world is full of them. 0.5% of the world can even code. And
[00:07:32] Anton Osika: much fewer can build a great product like Mt. Yanis co-founder. So I decided let's build something
[00:07:39] Anton Osika: for the 99% and not this productivity boost for developers. And that's going to be a completely
[00:07:45] Anton Osika: new type of interface where you dream your idea of some technical AI product into existence.
[00:07:54] Anton Osika: Yeah. And that's what we set out to build. Okay. So your first company, you were the founding
[00:08:00] Brian Halligan: engineer. Your next company depict your co-founder's CTO. Now your CEO, is it everything you ever
[00:08:07] Brian Halligan: hoped? That's a good question. I think it's quite different. What I love about it is that I get
[00:08:14] Anton Osika: to know myself and how to surround myself with the right complementary skillsets and
[00:08:23] Anton Osika: shall be challenging all the possible ways, much more than being a co-founder's CTO. And
[00:08:30] Anton Osika: I run the company on Founder Mode. I would mostly empathize with. But at this stage,
[00:08:38] Anton Osika: I mean, there's a big shift in focusing on empowering and blocking the leaders in the company.
[00:08:45] Anton Osika: And I mean, I like that. It's more analytical. Is it being a CEO? What surprised you about it?
[00:08:55] Anton Osika: You have to do so many things. Or unless you're very disciplined about what you delegate and
[00:09:01] Anton Osika: how you delegate it is like there's so many, many different things thrown at you, especially as you
[00:09:06] Anton Osika: just start to hyperscaling. Yes. How about for you? You're CEO, your first time CEO.
[00:09:14] Brian Halligan: What's harder than you thought? What's easier than the thought? What's different than you thought?
[00:09:20] Yeah. I think the first one is definitely you want to hire people better than yourself and all
[00:09:24] Mati Staniszewski: those RES that you know for the first time. In our case, things like legal or finance or
[00:09:30] Mati Staniszewski: building the go-to-market motion in sales, like all of these things, which I've seen
[00:09:35] Mati Staniszewski: kind of results of that work, but never have actually done the work. So it's a very quick learning
[00:09:40] Mati Staniszewski: of like how do you do that? So you actually understand it. And you need to understand at least a little
[00:09:44] Mati Staniszewski: bit to then be able and assess the person that you want to bring in. So that was kind of the
[00:09:48] Mati Staniszewski: the two things that they now repetitively try to do. When we have a new area, I'm trying to first
[00:09:53] Mati Staniszewski: put myself in those shoes, understand the basics, and then hire persons I know that they are
[00:09:58] Mati Staniszewski: doing that work. And the delegation too was something that I think I hold on for too long
[00:10:04] Mati Staniszewski: life, like to do myself rather than then delegate. And then actually how to delegate was an
[00:10:09] Mati Staniszewski: interesting piece in itself, where I think you do want to give a lot of the work to other leaders
[00:10:17] Mati Staniszewski: that you hire, the other people that you grow. But you still want to understand the detail that's
[00:10:21] Mati Staniszewski: happening. And then like how do you let them own it, be the leaders they want to be, but still remain
[00:10:27] Mati Staniszewski: in the details and to find their modes to be able to jump in when needed that balance of like
[00:10:31] Mati Staniszewski: how do you interact with that is it's a tricky thing that is still I think a continuous learning for
[00:10:37] Mati Staniszewski: me. And like I finally have this kind of three types of CEOs as people who are really in all the
[00:10:44] Brian Halligan: details in in everyone's shorts all the time. Their CEOs are a pretty high level and like I have
[00:10:51] Brian Halligan: an expression to keep your feet in the ground, your head in the clouds or you're in the details
[00:10:55] Brian Halligan: and you're up high, some people who stay very high. And then there's what I call speed lunkers people
[00:11:00] Brian Halligan: kind of go down deep in one thing for a while they come back out and go down into another thing.
[00:11:05] Brian Halligan: Have you got one of those models that is it like what are you? It sounds like you're the first.
[00:11:12] I do like the details. I think similar like the the I think to to to how Anton mentioned that
[00:11:19] Mati Staniszewski: that you operate is like you do on the the funder more you want to understand the product you
[00:11:23] Mati Staniszewski: want to actually work with the product all the time so you know how to actually use the product
[00:11:29] Mati Staniszewski: better than the most time trying to trying to stay extremely detailed like what is that we are
[00:11:34] Mati Staniszewski: shipping how we're shipping it how it works behind the scenes. So that's probably the the key thing.
[00:11:40] Mati Staniszewski: I like your analogy of head in the clouds the feet on the ground. I think the the thing that I'm
[00:11:49] Mati Staniszewski: trying and I think where where the magic happens if you do it well is being able to zoom out and
[00:11:55] Mati Staniszewski: zoom in extremely quickly before those contexts. So you're able to understand the problem zoom into
[00:12:00] Mati Staniszewski: the detail you understand the detail and then the next second you need to go to another problem which
[00:12:04] Mati Staniszewski: requires the same activity. There's a lot of context for changing the SEO. Exactly. And that's and you
[00:12:09] Mati Staniszewski: kind of need to be immediate in that. My co-founder who was the smartest person I know and is kind of
[00:12:16] Mati Staniszewski: leading the research work in his case he needs to go extremely deep for very long time. So we like
[00:12:22] Mati Staniszewski: very we frequently speak about this very different way of approaching the work where one is like
[00:12:28] Mati Staniszewski: all about context switching the other one is all about going as deep as possible.
[00:12:31] Mati Staniszewski: And how about when are you thinking on how are you feeling about delegation? Is it natural just
[00:12:35] Brian Halligan: delegate all this stuff or is it like I want to be in the details. I had a hard I had a very hard time
[00:12:40] Brian Halligan: delegating. I think it's often the I'm very impatient generally and like okay there's some
[00:12:51] Anton Osika: friction when I when there's many things that are feel very urgent and I know no one thing but maybe
[00:12:57] Anton Osika: not all the other ones. Are you driving people crazy? No mostly no mostly they like me they
[00:13:03] Anton Osika: feel around okay. And I actually this this is kind of from a good place. Okay let's talk about
[00:13:09] Brian Halligan: team you just hired a friend of mine to run sales. Yeah. You're building out your team. How are
[00:13:14] Brian Halligan: you thinking about building out your team? You're seeing your team in particular and then are you
[00:13:18] Brian Halligan: looking? Are you looking for people with high slope or high experience? Oh that's a good question.
[00:13:24] Anton Osika: I think like at this stage there's so there's many things we just like need to be done very
[00:13:33] Anton Osika: predictably and like because of like all the opportunities they're out there and hiring people
[00:13:40] Anton Osika: who have done it before and are a maybe wouldn't be as effective early stage because they're accepting
[00:13:47] Anton Osika: their ways that that is very effective. It's very effective. Oh wait so you lean towards experience
[00:13:53] Anton Osika: not necessarily for the things that have to get done we know like what those things are. Okay it is
[00:13:57] Anton Osika: is effective. Like well. So for sales everything that comes with some sales a lot of
[00:14:03] Anton Osika: fun some functions of marketing that has like all this. I'm looking for experience and then so
[00:14:10] Anton Osika: at least to run them and then I want if you have capacity to also hire people people with high
[00:14:16] Anton Osika: slopes and the whole like generalist and you also find a good way to be able to move them around
[00:14:21] Anton Osika: in the company that's something that has worked really well for us. I cannot predict how it's
[00:14:28] Anton Osika: going to work when there is more structure in the company but I'm coming to defining a good
[00:14:33] Anton Osika: experience. I mean high slope generalists who are you moving around on your senior team,
[00:14:38] Brian Halligan: direct reports senior team. To senior team. Are any of your direct reports any of these?
[00:14:44] Brian Halligan: No high slope people moving around. Not all my actually. But many of the ones I work with
[00:14:51] Anton Osika: they today would like to feel like they're reporting directly to me on many things. Sorry more of that.
[00:14:56] Anton Osika: I just yeah. How about you on the team you're building it you're getting a little you get a
[00:14:59] Brian Halligan: few under employees you're less than a hundred. What do you think about the senior team? What are
[00:15:04] Brian Halligan: you looking for? Have you had any misfires? In our case we have we have we are over 300 people
[00:15:11] Mati Staniszewski: but inside of the company it's effectively a lot of small teams. It's third teams of five to ten
[00:15:15] Mati Staniszewski: people and it usually is a combination of depending on the space either few with with with with the
[00:15:23] Mati Staniszewski: experience with the past work in that space and then usually infused with some of the high slope
[00:15:28] Mati Staniszewski: and we we like that because a you get the generalist that can adopt a lot of the new tool
[00:15:33] Mati Staniszewski: laying and kind of do new work and second we try to bring out the engineers across in some of
[00:15:38] Mati Staniszewski: those teams. So even a traditional growth team we have growth engineers and the ops team will have
[00:15:43] Mati Staniszewski: operations engineering to help automate a lot of the process. Sometimes use lovable in the
[00:15:49] Mati Staniszewski: any process to help to help with that work and and and that has that has helped tremendously to
[00:15:55] Mati Staniszewski: kind of get the experience the domain expertise while while creating the new the new process across
[00:16:02] Mati Staniszewski: the leadership. So then all those team roll up to each effective lead. So we have a go-to-market
[00:16:07] Mati Staniszewski: than the engineering leads. I need direct reports. I have 15 direct reports. That's a lot. Okay.
[00:16:13] Brian Halligan: And that crew of 15 are they kind of young hungry group of the company high slope or are they
[00:16:21] Brian Halligan: kind of then they're done that? Almost exactly how health. So how health have done not before?
[00:16:27] Mati Staniszewski: Usually are growing with the role of Chris we are growing extremely quickly so we grew from
[00:16:31] Mati Staniszewski: we started 2022 from zero to now over 200 million in revenue so that growth has been quick for
[00:16:37] Mati Staniszewski: for everybody so everybody is learning at the same time but half of them have seen that before
[00:16:42] Mati Staniszewski: and the other half are growing as well. You think that's right? Yeah, 50-50. Like at HubSpot we were
[00:16:48] Brian Halligan: kind of the same. I was I'd look around the table about half grew up in the company very high
[00:16:53] Brian Halligan: slope and half at a lot of experience. That felt right to me. Does that feel right to you? It's
[00:16:59] Brian Halligan: so it's in in many ways the people that are there have grown with the company incredibly.
[00:17:06] Mati Staniszewski: Victoria who leads our ops team has never done anything like this before. And also from
[00:17:11] Mati Staniszewski: Palantir background so also physics background so trying to like create a process as we go across
[00:17:18] Mati Staniszewski: and has grown incredibly with the company and then others kind of are still super important for
[00:17:23] Mati Staniszewski: the company but we'll stay in more of the product teams or on the IC roles in other parts. How about
[00:17:28] you on the you know what's your mix of kind of homegrown and been there down that you're probably
[00:17:33] Brian Halligan: just starting to hire execs I guess from the outside. Yeah so I built out this this leadership team
[00:17:39] Anton Osika: which is like seven people with Michael. Okay, so you have seven direct reports. Yeah, so we
[00:17:45] Anton Osika: without me and Michael from his five direct reports. Yeah. And officially everyone else like
[00:17:50] Anton Osika: reports something into them. Yeah. And you feeling you got that right or over time it's going to
[00:17:54] Brian Halligan: be a much bigger or where you are. Like I think of Jensen Huang has 45 direct reports and wow.
[00:18:00] Brian Halligan: You have a lot too now. No, I didn't. I had like 10. No. Yeah. And it's amazing to me that
[00:18:06] Brian Halligan: they get people with 45 or 15 people with three. There's such a range. Anyway, it was the five
[00:18:12] Brian Halligan: intentional or it just kind of happened. You will think that's not very much to the lot more
[00:18:19] Anton Osika: structure. And then if you I think generally like if you say okay, let's try to have a lot of
[00:18:23] Anton Osika: structure and then it's easier to add more like chaotic things on top of that. Yeah. And see how that
[00:18:29] Anton Osika: works. Okay, so you're hired. We kind of worked together on that. Had a sales search. How are you
[00:18:35] Brian Halligan: thinking about these senior searches? How are you deciding? You know, you're never run the sales
[00:18:40] Brian Halligan: orchids. So hard thing. Like lots of people are in your shoes like how are you making those calls?
[00:18:48] Anton Osika: Yes, so with the head of sales, I worked closely with the Jania Dexel who had done this before
[00:18:53] Anton Osika: many times. Okay, Danny Horsberg from Jania Dexel and Jania Dexel. Exactly. And they coached you.
[00:19:00] Anton Osika: They got they got to give me a lot of impact input on it. And I mean, in the end, it was me spending
[00:19:06] Anton Osika: a lot of time with this kind of a lot of candidates and then spending time with the team and
[00:19:11] Anton Osika: presenting how they would do things. And that that felt like that gave a lot of
[00:19:16] Anton Osika: installed a lot of confidence. Okay. So you had a bunch of help. Yeah. Let's both spoke to many people.
[00:19:23] Brian Halligan: I mean, on your side, same thing. You hadn't run a sale. You haven't done what we did. But you
[00:19:28] Brian Halligan: hadn't run a sales award. You had to make a decision on the sales year. You had a lot of qualifiers.
[00:19:32] Brian Halligan: I can't it's how did you go about it? Yeah, it's a tricky one. And especially I think for sales,
[00:19:38] Mati Staniszewski: the salespeople know how to sell themselves. They need to be able. So they are so you're going
[00:19:42] Mati Staniszewski: to need to filter through like do they actually know how to sell it, but they are all like good at it.
[00:19:47] Mati Staniszewski: So we are we are in a good setup where one of the salespeople was our investor. So we've seen him
[00:19:54] Mati Staniszewski: actually help us advise before he became a salesperson. So when when we started a company, we started
[00:20:00] Mati Staniszewski: getting enterprise inbound. We realized, okay, we can start something very quickly. And he already
[00:20:05] Mati Staniszewski: has spent so much time with us. Then it became natural. Okay, we want to bring that person in.
[00:20:10] Mati Staniszewski: And then as we've hired other roles, we have of course, amazing investors across like Sequoia
[00:20:16] Mati Staniszewski: who are on recent team who are helping us on that hunt. So we would partner very close here
[00:20:21] Mati Staniszewski: of the domain experts to help us through the network, through the back references to make sure
[00:20:27] Mati Staniszewski: that they are right ones. I think the back references really helps across that beyond the spending time
[00:20:31] Mati Staniszewski: with the team which which I think is crucial. And then the other part which which I haven't realized
[00:20:37] Mati Staniszewski: until later is that for sales specifically is that you are hiring of course a great individual for
[00:20:43] Mati Staniszewski: creating the sales playbook, helping you sell into the enterprises. But then ultimately the person
[00:20:48] Mati Staniszewski: you hire, they will set the culture for the sales team too. Like a lot of the people they will hire
[00:20:52] Mati Staniszewski: will be so similar in the approach to that work, which which I didn't appreciate until the other
[00:20:59] Mati Staniszewski: after the fact I was happy that the culture was very aligned. But then you can see they are
[00:21:04] Mati Staniszewski: very much similar. And we have Europe and US sales team. They're slightly different. The Europe
[00:21:09] Brian Halligan: is a lot more confident like they're a little bit like a lot the European versus US of bringing.
[00:21:15] Mati Staniszewski: So a lot more confident than our European counterparts that take more of like partner sales approach.
[00:21:21] Mati Staniszewski: But they have core similar values which helps. Okay, one of the things that confuses me about life
[00:21:27] Brian Halligan: today as a CEO is like from HubSpot from let's call it we went public in 2012 until I set down
[00:21:34] Brian Halligan: 2020. We had an annual planning cycle and the world just didn't change a whole lot every year.
[00:21:41] How about held you guys plan with the changes going on underneath like what's your cycle? How do
[00:21:46] Brian Halligan: you do it? We've done very little planning. Okay. And I think that's pretty smart because
[00:21:55] Anton Osika: you can like everything is changing very rapidly on as at least for our I mean I'd be to be
[00:22:02] Anton Osika: offering these like enterprises are huge ones are using our products that are huge extent.
[00:22:09] Anton Osika: We are just like giving it trying to give them the time they can get like as much as time as you
[00:22:15] Anton Osika: can get. And not being like okay this is our ICP this is exactly the same process at least so far.
[00:22:21] Anton Osika: But there's like tens of thousands of people in a hackathon that's not many of the world's like
[00:22:27] Anton Osika: larger healthcare companies using us. And we will I think start taking us that back and being okay.
[00:22:37] Anton Osika: Where are we seeing like from what much better the data analytics as well. Where are we going to focus?
[00:22:43] Anton Osika: Okay, and let me push back a little bit. You just had a big release that looks amazing.
[00:22:48] Brian Halligan: You must plan for that. You just didn't pull that out of a hackathon this week.
[00:22:53] Anton Osika: I mean we do have a launch roadmap and like it goes out six notes, like six months.
[00:22:59] Anton Osika: Okay. It's just like I'm sure it's going to change. Okay. So there's a lightweight six month
[00:23:06] Brian Halligan: product roadmap. Yeah. Okay. Got it. And it's pretty flexible like within that six months deep
[00:23:10] Brian Halligan: of it. Yeah. I do know this site in the company. We are of course going into longer time.
[00:23:17] Anton Osika: Yeah. Alright. So yeah. I think it's just hard to plan more than six months right now with all the
[00:23:22] Brian Halligan: underlying platform changes. I can't yeah it's an interesting time to be a CEO. How about over
[00:23:28] Brian Halligan: 11 labs like what's the cycle? The cycle. So we do so the teams have a pretty high flexibility in
[00:23:35] Mati Staniszewski: how they operate week to week so they can kind of take different directions. But on the quarterly
[00:23:40] Mati Staniszewski: basis, we'll get the teams together. They'll spend up to a day effectively outlining what are the
[00:23:46] Mati Staniszewski: initiatives they want to run for the next quarter. And then it's even less for the team itself.
[00:23:50] Mati Staniszewski: Sometimes it helps formalize the ideas, but it's more valuable for the teams around. So they know
[00:23:55] Mati Staniszewski: what to expect so they can learn from that that process. And we just came back from from an
[00:24:00] Mati Staniszewski: offside with the entire team where we where we are looking like what where we would like to be as
[00:24:05] Mati Staniszewski: a company in 2026 and in next three years. The thing that's probably the hardest is research. So we
[00:24:11] Mati Staniszewski: do also the foundational part for for voice. Yeah. And have a lot of research teams that that that
[00:24:18] Mati Staniszewski: crunk up some of the best models out there. And that's of course so hard to predict. So here we
[00:24:23] Mati Staniszewski: don't give any time. We do research initiatives. We want to plan. Yeah. So that's the one that goes
[00:24:27] Mati Staniszewski: out of the cycle. They don't know what's going to come out. It's very different than you don't know
[00:24:32] Brian Halligan: what you need to stay nimble that like the moment it comes out. That's why the small teams I think
[00:24:36] Mati Staniszewski: help so much as well. Because the moment something comes out either internally from our research
[00:24:40] Mati Staniszewski: team or from other teams, you know that this is like you have 24 hours to start integrating
[00:24:46] Mati Staniszewski: that into your product. That's like the most important time to really to really be ahead. Okay.
[00:24:50] Mati Staniszewski: Speaking of planning, I remember in the early days of HubSpot before CRM, we were marketing out.
[00:24:56] Brian Halligan: In every year, we go to the salesforce.com conference called Dreamforce. And as sit in the audience,
[00:25:02] Brian Halligan: and our pitch by the way at that time was salesforce.com is to sales as HubSpot is to marketing.
[00:25:09] And we would always think in the back of our head until salesforce.com wants to become salesforce.com
[00:25:13] Brian Halligan: marketing. And so with sit in the audience every year, hoping they didn't announce a marketing product.
[00:25:20] Brian Halligan: And sure enough, 2012 was there was that was the marketing year. They bought for marketing companies
[00:25:25] Brian Halligan: and they really went for it. We ended up pivoting and going to CRM. I would imagine you have a
[00:25:31] Brian Halligan: similar feeling when anthropics doing a big announcement or open ads having a big announcement.
[00:25:36] Brian Halligan: Even HubSpot is like we don't know. It's open AI. It's going to be a platform company like Google
[00:25:40] Brian Halligan: was or they're going to go build vertical apps. Are you as paranoid as I was or are you not that
[00:25:47] Brian Halligan: wearing? Yeah, I mean, they do have a lot of distribution out of the box. So that's
[00:25:54] Anton Osika: it would hurt. Are you or do you sit there like, where you do when they're doing their announcements?
[00:25:59] Brian Halligan: Are they going to not really know like I have so many things to think about. I catch up on like
[00:26:04] Anton Osika: the on the recent announcement. And I'm sure they will announce something. I wouldn't
[00:26:09] Anton Osika: mention that it will be in your space. It will be. It will be. It will be.
[00:26:12] Anton Osika: So you've got to start. Yeah. But I kind of think it would be an obvious thing for them to do.
[00:26:19] Anton Osika: Something yet like what we're building is this full platform where you're serving like most of
[00:26:27] Anton Osika: the product needs for an entire product and engineering organization. And that takes a lot of
[00:26:32] Anton Osika: iterations. That's the yet to do full thing. And unless they're like building that out completely
[00:26:38] Anton Osika: in the dark and then launching it, I don't think it's going to be a threat from the first.
[00:26:41] Anton Osika: Okay, I'm very impressed with your lack of paranoia. Are you paranoid? I would imagine.
[00:26:45] Brian Halligan: Are you are you like I was paranoid nervous about what's going on?
[00:26:49] Brian Halligan: Definitely a little always nervous and watching closely. I mean, they have great, great research
[00:26:54] Mati Staniszewski: teams. So they they we know that they will be pushing into the voice space. Yes.
[00:26:59] Mati Staniszewski: But at the same time, given like the spread of work that you just mentioned, that
[00:27:04] Mati Staniszewski: corollary is they lack focus. And we are fully focused on voice, or whether that's creating the
[00:27:09] Mati Staniszewski: research or products for creating voice agent or creating creative workflows, which does take a lot
[00:27:15] Mati Staniszewski: of iterations to actually bring that to the user to make the best experience that they require to solve
[00:27:20] Mati Staniszewski: their problems, solve their integrations. So I do think it's, you know, it's it's going to
[00:27:26] become increasingly competitive, especially on the research side. But that's where the product
[00:27:30] Mati Staniszewski: platform brand the design, the taste will matter a lot more. Something we speak a little,
[00:27:35] Mati Staniszewski: but with Anton every so often. And that will be the big piece where companies going deep into
[00:27:41] Mati Staniszewski: that space will win. Okay, speaking of taste, one thing I really like about both of you is I think
[00:27:47] Brian Halligan: you have taste, particularly in your marketing. Like you guys do some interesting stuff.
[00:27:52] Brian Halligan: You were fantastic on Twitter. Fantastic on Twitter. You're one of my favorite follows.
[00:27:58] Brian Halligan: How much time are you spending doing it? Do you do it all yourself?
[00:28:04] You're you're out there on stuff. Like just talk about your Twitter strategy. Sure.
[00:28:10] Brian Halligan: No, you like did you tweet just before we got in here? Like what's the deal?
[00:28:14] Brian Halligan: No, but I do spend quite a sometime on it. And it feels like, oh my god, I'm doing so many,
[00:28:20] Anton Osika: there is a lot of me see yo, I'm doing so many things and then I have to sit down every weekend and
[00:28:24] Anton Osika: get some of this, some of the post right. But I do have a team that comes to me with ideas.
[00:28:31] Anton Osika: Like every Monday we go through it's it's 50 minutes in the calendar. Okay.
[00:28:35] Anton Osika: Okay, usually thanks for that. They bring you here's the tweet that would be good.
[00:28:37] Anton Osika: No, they bring me ideas. Like okay, should we do something on this? And I like drop a lot of ideas
[00:28:44] Anton Osika: as well in a slack channel. And but this is not their full time job either. So it's a bit it's
[00:28:50] Anton Osika: like it's not the proper function in the company. It's very very effective in my opinion.
[00:28:56] Brian Halligan: Like your brand is very strong. It's working really well. Are you actually pressing the button
[00:29:02] Brian Halligan: when the tweet goes out or somebody doing it for you? It's usually me. Okay. So there's
[00:29:08] Anton Osika: a actually very good company called the type fully that you can draft them in and then you can
[00:29:13] Anton Osika: like collaborate on them. Okay. And I usually want to schedule them in that. I'll do the final
[00:29:20] Anton Osika: first one. I would keep going and getting even wackier if I were you. I think you're killing it.
[00:29:27] Brian Halligan: You guys are busy. I remember when I was your size. I get I got asked to do so much shit. Speak
[00:29:37] Brian Halligan: at my conference. Can you interview my daughter? Can you talk to this venture capitalist? This
[00:29:43] Brian Halligan: candidate? It's just an endless like of asks. And it's chaotic. And the firm is asking you to
[00:29:51] Brian Halligan: all that kind of stuff. How do you guys manage just like kind of tactically manage the chaos,
[00:29:58] Brian Halligan: manage your schedule, get shit done in the in the hurricane of requests, inputs chaos.
[00:30:06] Brian Halligan: Any tricks? A few tricks. A few tricks for sure. I think that we run a lot of the company on Slack.
[00:30:14] Mati Staniszewski: So the Slack is one part. And of course the email is especially the external piece. For email,
[00:30:18] Mati Staniszewski: now it's a combination of two. My my really understanding and how nice helping and the
[00:30:23] Mati Staniszewski: script is helping to auto classify a lot of emails to effectively p0 p1 p2 p0 is we need to
[00:30:29] Mati Staniszewski: somebody else's reading emails in p0. Someone else's reading and now we have a script as well
[00:30:34] Mati Staniszewski: to auto classify them. Okay. And and then p0 is that it's interesting. It's super helpful.
[00:30:39] Mati Staniszewski: Okay. Same day reply on the p0 p1 can wait for the week p2. Not important. I can I can I can take
[00:30:46] Mati Staniszewski: out and then I have like unblocked piece. So somebody's reading your emails is like, Hey,
[00:30:50] Brian Halligan: you need to respond to this is p0 labels. So every email gets a label and by homo sapiens and a script.
[00:30:58] Mati Staniszewski: So now it's a combination of both. So script as a first pass and then the homo sapiens does the
[00:31:04] Mati Staniszewski: second second pass. Fascinating. Who is that great at it too. Okay. And and and then you know exactly
[00:31:10] Mati Staniszewski: okay, this is I need to reply this day. This is an important customer partner. How does she know
[00:31:15] Brian Halligan: what's important? Like I send you an email. She must be like, that's so important. You get a
[00:31:20] Brian Halligan: response. So she knows what's important. Well, the first thing is sometimes there's of course
[00:31:27] Mati Staniszewski: new where you don't, but usually she knows means I doubt. And the second thing is for a lot of the
[00:31:30] Mati Staniszewski: people, a lot of the clients you buy and you will be in my contact list, you will have a p0 in
[00:31:36] Mati Staniszewski: bound. So the first moment you hit me with the email, it will auto classify that as a p0.
[00:31:42] Mati Staniszewski: So I know that it's at the top and and that I should reply on that on the same day.
[00:31:46] Mati Staniszewski: So that has worked tremendously across across email. I get I think I'm I'm very good on like
[00:31:52] Mati Staniszewski: getting up to all the else. How much slack is slack must be a firestorm? Slag is a firestorm. Slag is
[00:31:57] Mati Staniszewski: a firestorm. So it's usually a combination. If I think it's taking more than five minutes,
[00:32:03] Mati Staniszewski: then I will remind myself later. So I'm big on the remind function. And then if it's less than
[00:32:08] Mati Staniszewski: five minutes, I usually try to to reply straight away. Yeah. Kind of inbox zero on your slack.
[00:32:13] Brian Halligan: In bugs you're on the slack. Okay. What about your calendar? Calendar is at least we can advance
[00:32:21] Mati Staniszewski: clean in terms of like what I want to do. And then if there's like an urgent thing that comes up,
[00:32:25] Mati Staniszewski: then things get reshuffled. Yeah. And then I think the biggest piece that I've done over
[00:32:32] Mati Staniszewski: last six months and you mentioned the conferences, the events is planning at least a quarter ahead,
[00:32:37] Mati Staniszewski: which which continents I'll be in. And I'm trying to never be
[00:32:41] Mati Staniszewski: switching the continent in a in the same month. So like I would 10 a month, I'm trying to stay in one
[00:32:46] Mati Staniszewski: place. Oh, so you go to the US for a month? I usually try to be in a US for close to a month. I see.
[00:32:52] Mati Staniszewski: And that helps a lot with getting on the ground, working with the team, but also working with the
[00:32:57] Mati Staniszewski: customers. I think it's going to decrease to two weeks now given how distributed we are. Yeah.
[00:33:02] Mati Staniszewski: But but before that, I used to go for like a few days sometimes to US. And that has that has been
[00:33:09] Mati Staniszewski: not not ideal. Yeah. Before. Okay. Your calendar must be nuts. What does it look like? And where do
[00:33:18] Brian Halligan: you build in time to like actually think? It's a good question.
[00:33:26] I kind of I think I think best by talking with together with someone else. Okay. So it not
[00:33:32] Anton Osika: actually like happens. I say maybe late in the office or something with one on one time.
[00:33:38] Anton Osika: Yeah. I think I'm like, I'm still in this like a firestorm. And I'm going
[00:33:45] sat on innovating on what works best. Like there's this sort of type of creativity that you also
[00:33:51] Anton Osika: only get like when you're bored or like you get some downtime. And I don't I think there's
[00:33:57] Anton Osika: some way to program myself with the like this environment to get more of that. I did a Wednesday
[00:34:02] Brian Halligan: every Wednesday I work from home. And no meeting I was no meeting Wednesday that helped. I'm also
[00:34:07] Brian Halligan: a little introverted. So I needed a little time to re-charge the introverted or extroverted.
[00:34:13] Are you introverted? I say that but people around me are like, no, you're fake introverts.
[00:34:19] Anton Osika: Yeah. But like I mean if I if I'm alone for a full day I'm like, oh god. Oh you are.
[00:34:23] Anton Osika: Human. I'm not like that. I'm like, well, I need another alone day. Okay. Interesting.
[00:34:29] Brian Halligan: The no meetings they help. We I also have no meetings they usually gets meetings but they are
[00:34:35] Mati Staniszewski: meetings I actually want to do rather than like our like kind of proactive for the future rather than
[00:34:40] Mati Staniszewski: like in the moment and it is given weeks. So one of the things that really helped me was like once
[00:34:44] Brian Halligan: a month I made it to do list of like here's the eight things I want to get done. And I would publish
[00:34:50] Brian Halligan: that honor. We got a wiki at the time. And so everyone in the company is see what I was working on.
[00:34:55] Brian Halligan: And I would look at it every couple days and be like, does my calendar match my to do list? Because
[00:35:00] Brian Halligan: all the slacks and emails are everybody else's priorities imposed on you. And by putting it on there
[00:35:07] Brian Halligan: it sort of allowed me to say no. It's just so much stuff and it was hard to say no. And so it gave me
[00:35:16] Brian Halligan: license to say, you know what's not on my to do list. I'm not going to do it. And then I got a hat
[00:35:20] Brian Halligan: with a big NO on it. A no hat and a walk around the office and people call me doctor. No because
[00:35:26] Brian Halligan: I just wanted to keep it focused on a couple things that I was trying to get done and the company
[00:35:30] Brian Halligan: was trying to get done. And I would lose focus and then to be a firestorm and then back. So I didn't
[00:35:35] Brian Halligan: nail it. But that was a small hack that helped a little. Okay, you two are doing an amazing job
[00:35:42] Brian Halligan: building amazing companies in Europe. My two favorite entrepreneurs. What's it like building an
[00:35:49] Brian Halligan: amazing AI company in Europe? And what are the pluses and minuses of building in Europe?
[00:35:57] Brian Halligan: I think the network around you is not as mature as compared to
[00:36:04] Anton Osika: especially Silicon Valley. And that makes it more difficult with distribution.
[00:36:11] Anton Osika: I mean, like sophisticated investors or like just a coffee away can be valuable. And then once
[00:36:21] Anton Osika: you're staffing especially on like not the high-slow generalists are distributed across the
[00:36:27] Anton Osika: world right. But as you're staffing with people who have done it in silver for it's a
[00:36:33] Anton Osika: free cure to find it in Europe. But I heard you referred to building in Europe as hard mode.
[00:36:40] Brian Halligan: I mean, those parts are hard mode. But at the same time, I think I don't know maybe we would
[00:36:46] Anton Osika: have been more successful building from the value or something. I could see that. But I think
[00:36:51] Anton Osika: it has been very helpful for us to be like the go to number one talent destination in Stockholm.
[00:36:58] Anton Osika: And that's the reason I decided no, we're going to stay here. We're going to stay in Beton
[00:37:02] Anton Osika: on that there is much more available talent that doesn't jump around. They aren't entitled in
[00:37:09] Anton Osika: spoil. And they're yearning for a possibility to literally change the world. And there's not many
[00:37:21] Anton Osika: companies that have done it from Europe. There has not been a trillion dollar company from Europe
[00:37:25] Anton Osika: and being at 11 labs or building at 11, but it's one of those very, very rare opportunities here.
[00:37:30] Anton Osika: I agree with that. I'm going to ask you this. You've got employees in the US in Europe.
[00:37:36] Any difference? Definitely differences. And similar, I will quickly add that I think that talent in
[00:37:43] Mati Staniszewski: Europe can be incredible. You just need to find a talent. And you're building in London mostly or
[00:37:51] Brian Halligan: all over. All over, but London and Poland are our biggest hubs. Poland must be terrific.
[00:37:56] Brian Halligan: Poland is incredible. Like some of the best central Eastern Europe. Everybody must want to work for
[00:38:00] Mati Staniszewski: you in Poland. It's like, it's like Antonin's dog. We are heavily building the brand across
[00:38:04] Mati Staniszewski: the Eastern Europe. And we think those engineers are just so incredible. They are yearning for
[00:38:08] Mati Staniszewski: something. They are yearning for a company that actually wants to build something, a generation
[00:38:12] Mati Staniszewski: or something big. And there's just so few of those opportunities at the same time the companies
[00:38:17] Mati Staniszewski: of Silicon Valley frequently don't give that opportunity. So it's like perfect.
[00:38:21] Brian Halligan: To build new stuff. They give like exactly stuff. And so I think one of the differences, which is
[00:38:27] Mati Staniszewski: on a lot of Europeans, especially Eastern Europe, is very straightforward straight to the point,
[00:38:32] Mati Staniszewski: very direct sometimes, sometimes too direct, which we actually really enjoy as a company. It
[00:38:38] Mati Staniszewski: helped share a lot of ideas, criticism, feedback in a much better way. On the other hand,
[00:38:45] Mati Staniszewski: what I think US is going for them is that confidence of things are going to be amazing,
[00:38:50] Mati Staniszewski: are great, are very ambitious across the entirety of the people. And that's something that
[00:38:56] Mati Staniszewski: that we are continuously trying to instill in some of the people across Europe.
[00:39:02] Mati Staniszewski: And maybe the other thing that helps across Europe is that if you're building in Europe,
[00:39:06] you of course need to build for the global market. You can build just for European market.
[00:39:10] Mati Staniszewski: But then when you do that, then you at the time zone is actually perfect for
[00:39:14] Mati Staniszewski: gathering to US to to to to let South America to Europe and to Asia as well, which helped in our case
[00:39:21] Mati Staniszewski: as well. And the difference between American employees and European. It will be that. I think that
[00:39:26] Mati Staniszewski: the main one is also beyond being direct and confident. I think the entrepreneur's ship kind of
[00:39:33] Mati Staniszewski: aspiration is very different in US. Everybody knows value of equity. Everybody is treating that as part
[00:39:39] Mati Staniszewski: of like a good career. In Europe, you kind of need to convince the employees. Sometimes you need to
[00:39:43] Mati Staniszewski: convince the families that this is the right thing. In Poland, we need to frequently explain that
[00:39:49] Mati Staniszewski: equity is worth something. Almost forced employees to take the equity, which which I said,
[00:39:54] Mati Staniszewski: it's an interesting surprise of like how does it work. But now we've went through this cycle
[00:40:00] Mati Staniszewski: a few times and the equity is worth something we do tender offers. So people started educating
[00:40:05] Mati Staniszewski: other people that this is actually the right choice, which we hope will like in places like
[00:40:10] Mati Staniszewski: Poland and wider Europe will become more, more normalized and and then something that people will
[00:40:15] Mati Staniszewski: want to do across entrepreneurship. When I was in my late 20s, I spent or in early 37 years in Asia.
[00:40:23] Brian Halligan: And I worked for this company, PTC, a very good company in the US. And I had to convince
[00:40:29] Brian Halligan: Japanese people in Chinese people in Korean people that this thing called equity is going to be worth
[00:40:33] Brian Halligan: a lot. And man, it was a dog fight convincing them. I'm like, what? You're just trying to pay me
[00:40:38] Brian Halligan: less money. I remember those days and people made a lot of money on that stock.
[00:40:45] Brian Halligan: Okay, on this topic like 996, or you guys in office, 996 hardcore, like one interesting thing,
[00:40:53] Brian Halligan: like my generation of CEOs, we kind of followed Steve Jobs was sort of on our Mount Rushmore.
[00:41:00] Brian Halligan: And the current generations, it feels like it's a lot more Elon and companies are working much
[00:41:06] Brian Halligan: more like Elon's companies. Who's your Mount Rushmore? Are you 996 like Elon plus? Where are you guys at?
[00:41:13] Brian Halligan: Steve Jobs is great. Yeah, I think it was a good one.
[00:41:17] Anton Osika: What I like about him is he really understands that like a team working better and better and
[00:41:21] Anton Osika: better over time and like really obsessing and caring about what you're doing is.
[00:41:26] Anton Osika: Steve Jobs. Yes. Yes. So, if I'm Steve Jobs, are you Elon?
[00:41:33] Who's your... I mean, my style can be a bit Elon or Mac. This has to be a good done now.
[00:41:38] Anton Osika: Yes. What does it take to this faster? Is it Daniela?
[00:41:42] Anton Osika: No, I don't know him that unfortunately. Okay. He operated. But so based on reading about Elon,
[00:41:48] Anton Osika: I mean, have a bit of that. But I think he lost a lot of the autonomy and
[00:41:54] Anton Osika: teams feeling ownership of doing it in too much the Elon way. So I might get back to you on with
[00:42:01] Anton Osika: a bit of the... Are you 996 plus?
[00:42:06] Anton Osika: Me, many people are on the company. Are 996 plus?
[00:42:08] Anton Osika: Very company. Many people on the company, but people have family. That's families as well.
[00:42:13] Anton Osika: It's just we have very, very high expectations of everyone to drive impact.
[00:42:19] Anton Osika: And then if you're not working many hours, you need to...
[00:42:24] Anton Osika: Clearly, I have to have clearly added back in other ways.
[00:42:27] Anton Osika: You think that scale, like one of the problems with scale is that
[00:42:31] Brian Halligan: drives sort of wanes and that, you know, do you think that fades in? Is there ideas in your head?
[00:42:37] Brian Halligan: How you keep that motivation going?
[00:42:44] I think it's about setting very, very ambitious goals every week.
[00:42:48] Anton Osika: And that's what I think is every week you put out goals.
[00:42:52] Anton Osika: Yeah. And then it's very, it's being very clear before someone joins,
[00:42:56] Anton Osika: some of the expectations are. And it's about the value of impact.
[00:43:03] Anton Osika: And if you lost candidates, like VP candidates, because like, you know what?
[00:43:08] Brian Halligan: Yeah, I love the mission. I love you, but I can only do 50 hours a week. And I've got to,
[00:43:15] Brian Halligan: I've got a life, I've got four kids.
[00:43:18] Anton Osika: I lost, I think we lost some kind of, like, yeah, but that's maybe good life in the big city.
[00:43:23] Brian Halligan: Okay. Who's your mind rush more?
[00:43:27] It's very closer to Steve Jobs between those two.
[00:43:32] Mati Staniszewski: But it's, he was always like so caring about the design, about making it kind of
[00:43:38] Mati Staniszewski: hiding the complexity from the user, making it easy to use.
[00:43:40] Mati Staniszewski: And he does, he does have this obsessive piece, which is maybe a slightly different to how I would
[00:43:47] Mati Staniszewski: try to, to run it or work in a company. But I love what he created as his legacy.
[00:43:52] Mati Staniszewski: But they're amazing. Other CEOs there, you know, there's like more pockets from different people
[00:43:58] Mati Staniszewski: that they are incredible. I like Jamie Dimon and how his clarity and his like across so many
[00:44:05] Mati Staniszewski: things that he runs. And I think it's like half a million people under him.
[00:44:08] Mati Staniszewski: He feels very calm and under control. I think this is admirable.
[00:44:13] Mati Staniszewski: Satya, I think the way he kind of turned it out. And he is like a very caring person around,
[00:44:19] Mati Staniszewski: around how he runs the company. I think this, this is, this is another great, great either.
[00:44:26] Mati Staniszewski: But from the 996, I think in our, you guys 996. Not in the office. I think everybody is online
[00:44:34] chronically and all the time. We definitely make it very explicit before you join. It's,
[00:44:39] Mati Staniszewski: we think it's like once in a lifetime change with AI across the world, we can be the voice of
[00:44:45] Mati Staniszewski: the change, the voice of the technology. And everybody understands the opportunity ahead is rare.
[00:44:50] Mati Staniszewski: And we do lose kind of that's across. But then you filter, we do frequent, I mean, they frequently
[00:44:55] Mati Staniszewski: want, I think, even apply. We are like very vocal in the process that that that it's, it's,
[00:45:01] Mati Staniszewski: it's a lot of time commitment. We never impose it or ask anyone for doing that, but they do.
[00:45:08] Mati Staniszewski: It's usually seven days a week, but you are not maybe working all the seven days a week,
[00:45:13] Mati Staniszewski: but you are online and ready to jump in, especially on the weekends on any, on any questions.
[00:45:18] Mati Staniszewski: And I think people, people enjoy working next to passionate people. So you kind of like get
[00:45:26] Mati Staniszewski: that bar higher, you run together. And then when you see results, it's awesome.
[00:45:30] Mati Staniszewski: In like the last 50 employees like you're from employee 250 to 500 versus 50 to 100,
[00:45:36] Brian Halligan: is there a difference in your mind and commitment and zeal and whatever?
[00:45:43] Brian Halligan: You know, it's definitely some, but, but the current employees are also on it.
[00:45:47] Mati Staniszewski: Like, and I think the small teams helped where you have like, you know, you're effectively joined
[00:45:52] Mati Staniszewski: that unit of 10 people or less. So you are seeing that everybody's running in that unit and
[00:45:58] Mati Staniszewski: everybody else is running too. So you are going after after that too. Of course, we also have
[00:46:04] Mati Staniszewski: people with families, people that will have other other things and that can work and, and,
[00:46:10] Mati Staniszewski: and it does. But usually those people are thinking about work and how to improve
[00:46:15] Mati Staniszewski: model things. What do you guys think European like, what needs to happen in Europe to,
[00:46:20] Brian Halligan: to have like a lot more of you guys? I think they're coming. You do the other truly.
[00:46:26] Anton Osika: Yes. 100%. Okay. There is like an engineering school. So now you asked them, would you consider
[00:46:31] Anton Osika: you're so we're being in part of the funding team? Yeah. 80% yes. Okay.
[00:46:36] Anton Osika: We went up to 10x. Okay. Okay. Interesting. That first generation will help. I think like few
[00:46:42] Mati Staniszewski: of the companies, if we, if we go to a good job, get to get some people to start another set of
[00:46:48] Mati Staniszewski: companies. I think the second thing of what's, I think missing in the European ecosystem is people
[00:46:53] Mati Staniszewski: that have done it before, have seen that scale. And that, and then of course, have got a good
[00:46:58] Mati Staniszewski: outcome to then make, make clear of like, this is actually a really cool thing to do. Hopefully,
[00:47:03] Mati Staniszewski: those people can infuse additional set of startups across across your. We started up Hub Spot in Boston.
[00:47:11] Brian Halligan: And it's got a lot of the same benefits Europe like so much talent. MIT's there. Just we were
[00:47:16] Brian Halligan: a magnet for it. The, the area it fell down is as we scaled and we need to hire, you know, a head
[00:47:22] Brian Halligan: of marketing who had seen the movie before or someone who had really operated at scale. So we
[00:47:28] Brian Halligan: started hiring more people in the valley. That started to happen around a thousand employees.
[00:47:33] Brian Halligan: But it feels similar. Boston feels similar to Europe in that way. Boston's conservative. It's kind
[00:47:38] Brian Halligan: of similar. Any advice for all this lots of young smart entrepreneurs listen to this pod
[00:47:46] Brian Halligan: that want to build the next level, although the next 11 labs, any advice.
[00:47:51] Brian Halligan: First of all, I think go for it. It's amazing to build a company. And, you know, of course,
[00:47:58] Mati Staniszewski: maybe I was in the lacky position where I had saved things and I didn't have the dependencies.
[00:48:03] Mati Staniszewski: But if you are in that similar situation, I think it's go for it. The learning experience you get
[00:48:09] Mati Staniszewski: across building a company, even if it doesn't go the way you expect. I think it's so much more
[00:48:14] Mati Staniszewski: valuable than frequently joining other companies and being a smaller coggle in a big machine.
[00:48:21] Mati Staniszewski: And then I think obsess about the problem. Try to deeply understand what you are actually
[00:48:24] Mati Staniszewski: solving for. Talk with customers. And the simplest advice, I think, is the most valuable here,
[00:48:29] Mati Staniszewski: which is actually working with the user and iterating very, very deeply. And then I think it's
[00:48:34] Mati Staniszewski: all about the team and hiring. So the people you bring across and who you build with will be,
[00:48:39] Mati Staniszewski: will be defining for the company. So pick your co funders carefully and well, and know them
[00:48:45] Mati Staniszewski: ideally for a longer time before you decide to start something. And then as a sample, the team,
[00:48:49] Mati Staniszewski: you really want the trust tips individuals that you want to go for the next decades together.
[00:48:57] Anton Osika: I think you want to learn things very, very fast if you're getting started. And
[00:49:03] Anton Osika: you want to learn a lot of things. You want to learn how to hire. I mean, you don't have to be
[00:49:07] Anton Osika: so good at managing about having high expectations for people and giving them clear feedback.
[00:49:12] Anton Osika: And you want to learn how to sell. You want to sell to your customers or an seller or
[00:49:17] Anton Osika: another market to your people you want to hire. And if you want to always sell it, you're always
[00:49:23] Anton Osika: selling. I see you should do that all the time. And then ask someone who you respect to give
[00:49:30] Anton Osika: it to you hard on how bad you are because you're just getting started. Of course.
[00:49:39] Anton Osika: Just go out there and try to find joy probably by having a co-founder as you're talking about
[00:49:47] Anton Osika: in the failings and the learnings. That's the other thing which I was thinking about your
[00:49:52] Mati Staniszewski: earlier question. What do you don't expect as a CEO's role? You don't expect that you don't have
[00:49:57] Mati Staniszewski: anyone to complain to effectively. So your co-founder is your soulmate that you can speak through.
[00:50:03] Mati Staniszewski: And then there are some sometimes amazing people in the team you can iterate through but not to the same,
[00:50:08] Mati Staniszewski: not to the same. I totally agree with that. I want to congratulate you guys and all your success.
[00:50:14] Brian Halligan: I admire what you guys are doing. I sure hope you guys build trillion dollar companies in Europe.
[00:50:19] Brian Halligan: That would be amazing. Good luck to you. Thanks for doing the pod. Thank you so much.
[00:50:23] Brian Halligan: Thank you. Thank you.
[00:50:26] Okay, those two are terrific. It's nice to see them kind of blossoming before our eyes.
[00:50:32] Brian Halligan: What they haven't common is they both had like seven or eight years of experience with like one
[00:50:38] Brian Halligan: good company in there. And I know it's fashionable to drop out of Harvard and start a company like
[00:50:43] Brian Halligan: Suck did. But at least for me, I did two startups before HubSpot. One was very successful when
[00:50:51] Brian Halligan: public didn't got very large. Man did I learn a lot from that. And man, there are a lot of
[00:50:56] Brian Halligan: lessons inside of HubSpot about scaling. But you do you. But I don't think it hurts a founder
[00:51:01] Brian Halligan: to being a really good startup to learn before they start a company. They talked a lot about their
[00:51:06] Brian Halligan: co-founders. And one of the things about being a CEO is you're you're a shit umbrella. Like all the
[00:51:13] Brian Halligan: shit rains on you and you get an umbrella for your whole organization. It's hard. The other thing
[00:51:19] Brian Halligan: about being a CEO is like no one is coming to save you. In my startups, my boss would come and
[00:51:25] Brian Halligan: save me and other team would come and save me. There was a lot of resources around. You're pretty
[00:51:29] Brian Halligan: alone and it's on you as a founder. But one person you can complain to is your co-founder. And so my
[00:51:37] Brian Halligan: advice to you would be to really get to know your co-founder because it's an incredibly important
[00:51:42] Brian Halligan: relationship for you going forward. We've gone into mechanics of the job and we talked about
[00:51:47] Brian Halligan: delegation. And they're kind of starting to it's actually in the starting to delegate. They're like
[00:51:54] Brian Halligan: we're kind of founder mode. We're not sure how to do this but the starting to do it is
[00:51:57] Brian Halligan: impressive to see what they're doing. My experience the way that work as HubSpot scaled, I was very
[00:52:04] Brian Halligan: founder mode in sales and in product. And man, the rest of the organization I was very manager
[00:52:10] Brian Halligan: mode. And I drove both constituencies crazy. The sales and product folks I was in their shorts
[00:52:17] Brian Halligan: and they always complained. I was too much in the details. All the rest of them complained that
[00:52:21] Brian Halligan: they didn't respond to their emails. So that was sort of the blend for me. I wasn't all manager mode.
[00:52:25] Brian Halligan: It was an all founder mode. And that kind of worked for me. And maybe that would work for you
[00:52:30] Brian Halligan: running your company. I like the way they were thinking about their teams. I ask all the CEOs on
[00:52:35] Brian Halligan: these episodes. What's their spana control? And it's all over the map. By the way, I caught everyone
[00:52:42] Brian Halligan: was copying Justin Huang and having 60 direct reports. That is definitely not true. He is an
[00:52:49] Brian Halligan: end of one on that. And like Anton Helmley has five direct reports. I had 10. Tia's 15. So it's
[00:52:56] Brian Halligan: a little bit all over the map. If I were you, I would think about that. What do you want your spana
[00:53:01] Brian Halligan: control to be? And I would have it as wide as you can tolerate. As you scale from 100 to 1000
[00:53:07] Brian Halligan: employees, all those layers in there really will slow you down. So you want to keep it as flat as you
[00:53:12] Brian Halligan: can. The other thing I liked about that we're thinking about teams is they were definitely starting
[00:53:16] Brian Halligan: to bring in some Ben there, done that people. The whole team wasn't been there, done that. The way
[00:53:22] Brian Halligan: HubSpot ended up as we had about half been there, done that and a half homegrown. And DC's tried
[00:53:27] Brian Halligan: to jam you full of Ben there, done that. I like that balance having a little bit of both. The home
[00:53:32] Brian Halligan: grown talent is underrated on your teams most likely. We also talked about just managing the chaos.
[00:53:37] Brian Halligan: Like they're growing crazy. They have so much opportunity. It's just a hurricane of input coming
[00:53:44] Brian Halligan: into them. And a couple of things, a couple of hacks I liked Anton is really going to Twitter,
[00:53:50] Brian Halligan: by the way, if you don't follow him, he's really good. I like that every Monday morning, he has a
[00:53:55] Brian Halligan: 15 minute meeting with a couple of his staff members and they brainstorm on tweets. So he's not
[00:53:59] Brian Halligan: just coming up at that extemporaneously. He's thought about it a little bit and he's very good at
[00:54:04] Brian Halligan: it. Most of them, or at least I had a no meaning day where I can actually think and get some room
[00:54:08] Brian Halligan: and work on projects. I think that's a good hack. I had it on Fridays for a while. Everyone thought
[00:54:12] Brian Halligan: I was thinking a long weekend, they moved it to Wednesdays. And they're going to have to get
[00:54:18] Brian Halligan: good at saying no. Like I was working on saying no. So I made myself this hat, my no hat, and I had
[00:54:24] Brian Halligan: a no shirt too. And I think startups are much, much more likely to die of overeating starvation.
[00:54:32] Brian Halligan: That's probably true of yours. You might need your own no hat. Speaking of chaos,
[00:54:38] Brian Halligan: I asked them are they 996 and they're both 996 plus. And I think that's interesting. I've asked
[00:54:46] Brian Halligan: all the CEOs that I've been interviewing, that's been 10 so far. And the early stage startups are
[00:54:51] Brian Halligan: all doing 996 and the bigger ones aren't. And I think that's probably life and the fastening.
[00:54:56] Brian Halligan: As your employees start having families and you're hiring people to families, it's just
[00:55:01] Brian Halligan: hard to get people in the office six days of work, working nine to nine. But I think keep it going
[00:55:05] Brian Halligan: as long as you can if you're doing 996. I think it's good. I was 996, but I didn't ask my team to be 996.
[00:55:13] We talked a lot about Europe. There's two amazing companies in Europe. In Europe, so we started in
[00:55:18] Brian Halligan: Boston. In Boston's a little bit like Europe. You're like outside the echo chamber of Silicon Valley.
[00:55:27] Brian Halligan: And there's some real pluses and minuses to being outside of the valley. The pluses are you
[00:55:32] Brian Halligan: end up being a very large fish in a very small pond, which can help. And you have really good access
[00:55:39] Brian Halligan: to talent and not a lot of competition for that talent. So real pluses, the minuses we found out at
[00:55:47] Brian Halligan: HubSpot and they're going to find out is inside of Boston, there's just not a lot of scale tech
[00:55:52] Brian Halligan: companies. So we had a hard time finding executives who had seen that movie on that next level of
[00:55:57] Brian Halligan: scale. Like we took a couple people from Akamai and that worked out, but it was pretty lean. And so
[00:56:02] Brian Halligan: we started hiring execs out in San Francisco. So real pluses and minuses to being in a big city.
[00:56:08] If I had to do HubSpot over again, by the way, you didn't ask, but I would have we were in Boston.
[00:56:15] Brian Halligan: I'd have a big office in Boston, big office in San Francisco. Then another big office in,
[00:56:20] Brian Halligan: I don't know, Nashville or Denver, Toronto would be pretty good where you can hire lots and lots
[00:56:25] Brian Halligan: of people for less money and have them be a little bit more loyal than let's say in your San Francisco
[00:56:30] Brian Halligan: office. I wouldn't let everybody work from home. I'd have three big hooks. Okay, we wound up obviously
[00:56:35] Brian Halligan: talking about Europe. They're both in Europe, really encouraging for Europe. The world could use
[00:56:39] Brian Halligan: more Silicon Valley and the world could use, you know, a vibrant European entrepreneurial scene.
[00:56:45] Brian Halligan: I love to hear from them that the engineering schools are a shock full of kids that want to start
[00:56:50] Brian Halligan: companies. I think that's going to be good for the world and good for Europe. So I'm excited about
[00:56:54] Brian Halligan: that. I hope you enjoyed the episode. I really liked it. These two are great. I will see you on the
[00:56:59] Brian Halligan: next episode on Longestrain Trip.
