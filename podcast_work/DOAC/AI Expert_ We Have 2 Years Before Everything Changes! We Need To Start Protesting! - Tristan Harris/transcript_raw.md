[00:00:00] If you're worried about immigration taking jobs, you should be way more worried about AI.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_02: Because it's like a flood of millions of new digital immigrants that are Nobel prize-level capability
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_02: work at superhuman speed and will work for less than minimum wage. I mean, we're heading for
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_02: so much transformative change faster than our society's currently prepared to deal with it.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_02: And there's a different conversation happening publicly than the one that the AI companies
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_02: are having privately. About which world we're heading to, which is a future that people don't want.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_02: But we didn't consent to have six people make that decision on behalf of eight billion people.
[00:00:30] Tristan Harris is one of the world's most influential technology ethicists.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_02: Who created the Center for Humane Technology after correctly predicting the dangers social media
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_00: would have on our society. And now he's warning us about the catastrophic consequences
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_02: AI will have on all of us.
[00:00:48] Let me like collect myself for a second.
[00:00:52] We can't let it happen. We cannot let these companies raise to build a super intelligent digital
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_02: god own the world economy and have military image because of the belief that if I don't build it
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: first I'll lose to the other guy and then I will be forever asleep to their future.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_02: And they feel they'll die either way so they prefer to light the fire and see what happens.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_02: It's winner takes all. But as we're racing we're landing in a world of unvetted therapists rising
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_02: energy prices and major security risks. I mean, we have evidence where if an AI model reading a
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_02: company's email finds out it's about to get replaced with another AI model and then it also reads
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_02: in the company email that one executive is having an affair with an employee. The AI will
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_02: independently blacken it that executive in order to keep itself alive. That's crazy. But what do you
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_02: think? I'm finding it really hard to be hopeful. I'm going to be honest just now. So I really want to
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_01: get practical in specific about what we can do about this. Listen, I'm not I'm not naive. This is
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: super hard. But we have done hard things before and it's possible to choose a different future. So
[00:01:49] I see messages all the time in the comments section that some of you didn't realize you didn't
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_01: subscribe. So if you could do me a favor and double check if you're a subscriber to this channel
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_01: that would be tremendously appreciated. It's the simple, it's the free thing that anybody that
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: watches this show frequently can do to help us here to keep everything going in this show
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_01: in the trajectory it's on. So please do double check if you subscribed and thank you so much
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: because there's a strange way you are you're part of our history and you're on this journey
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_01: where this and I appreciate you for that. So yeah, thank you. Tristan, I think my first question
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: and maybe the most important question is we're going to talk about artificial intelligence and
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_01: technology broadly today. But who are you in relation to this subject matter? So I did a program
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_02: at Stanford called the Mayfield Fellows Program that took engineering students and then taught them
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_02: entrepreneurship. You know, I as a computer scientist didn't know anything about entrepreneurship,
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_02: but they pair you up with venture capitalists, they give you mentorship and you know, there's a
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_02: lot of powerful alumni who were part of that program. The co-founder of Asana, the co-founders of
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_02: of Instagram were both part of that program and that put us in kind of a cohort of people who
[00:03:00] were basically ending up at the center of what was going to colonize the whole world's
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_02: psychological environment which was the social media situation. And as part of that, I started my
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_02: own tech company called Absure and we basically made this tiny widget that would help people find
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_02: more contextual information without leaving the website they were on. It was a really cool product
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_02: that was about deepening people's understanding. And I got into the tech industry because I thought
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_02: that technology could be a force for good in the world. That's why I started my company. And then
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_02: I kind of realized through that experience that at the end of the day, these news publishers who
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_02: used our product, they only cared about one thing which is, is this increasing the amount of time
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_02: and eyeballs and attention on our website because eyeballs meant more revenue. And I was in sort of
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_02: this conflict of, I think I'm doing this to help the world, but really I'm measured by this metric
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_02: of what keeps people's attention. That's the only thing that I'm measured by. And I saw that
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: conflict play out among my friends who started Instagram, you know, because they got into it because
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_02: they wanted people to share little bite-sized moments of your life. You know, here's a photo of
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_02: my bike ride down to the bakery in San Francisco. It's what Kevin's sister used to post when we were,
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_02: when he was just starting it. I was probably one of the first like 100 users of the app.
[00:04:15] And later you see how these sort of simple products that had a simple good positive intention
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_02: got sort of sucked into these perverse incentives. And so Google acquired my company called Absure.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_02: I landed there and I joined the Gmail team. And I'm with these engineers who are designing the
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_02: email interface that people spend hours a day in. And then one day one of the engineers comes over
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_02: and he says, well, why don't we make it buzz your phone every time you get an email? And you just
[00:04:45] ask the question nonchalantly like it wasn't a big deal. And in my experience, I was like, oh my
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_02: God, you're about to change billions of people's psychological experiences with their families,
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_02: with their friends at dinner, with their date night on romantic relationships.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_02: Where suddenly people's phones are going to be busy showing notifications at their email.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_02: And you're just asking this question as if it's like a throwaway question. And I became concerned,
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_02: I see you have a slide deck there. I do.
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_02: About basically how Google and Apple and social media companies were hosting this psychological
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_02: environment that was going to corrupt and fracked the global human attention of humanity.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_02: And I basically said I needed to make a slide deck as 130 something pages slide deck that
[00:05:34] basically was a message to the whole company at Google saying we have to be very careful
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_02: and we have a moral responsibility in how we shape the global attentions of humanity.
[00:05:45] This slide deck I've printed off which my research team found is called a call to minimize
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_01: distraction and respect uses attention by a concerned PM and entrepreneur PM meaning project manager.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_01: Project manager, yeah. How was that received at Google?
[00:05:59] I was very nervous actually because I felt like I wasn't coming from some place where I wanted to
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_02: like stick it to them or you know be controversial. I just felt like there was this conversation
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_02: that wasn't happening. And I sent it to about 50 people that were friends of mine just for feedback.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_02: And when I came to work the next day there was 150 you know on the top right on Google slides it
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_02: shows you the number of simultaneous viewers. And it had 130 something simultaneous viewers and
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_02: later that day it was like 500 simultaneous viewers. And so obviously it had been spreading
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_02: virally throughout the whole company. And people from all around the company emailed me saying
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_02: this is a massive problem I totally agree we have to do something. And so instead of getting fired
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_02: I was invited and basically stayed to become a design ethicist studying how do you design in an
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_02: ethical way. And how do you design for the collective attention spans and information flows of
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_02: humanity in a way that does not cause all these problems. Because what was sort of obvious to me then
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_02: and that was in 2013 is that if the incentive is to maximize eyeballs and attention and engagement
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_02: then you're incentivizing a more addicted distracted lonely polarized sexualized breakdown of shared
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_02: reality society. Because all of those outcomes are success cases of maximizing for engagement
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_02: for an individual human on a screen. And so it was like watching this slow motion train wreck
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_02: in 2013 you could kind of see there's this kind of myth that we could never predict the future
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_02: like technology could go any direction. And that's like you know the possible of a new technology.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_02: But I wanted people to see the probable that if you know the incentives you can actually know
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_02: something about the future that you're heading towards. And that presentation kind of kicked that off.
[00:07:48] A lot of people will know you from the documentary on Netflix the social dilemma which was a big
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_01: moment and a big conversation in society across the world. But then since then a new alien has
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: entered the picture. There's a new protagonist in the story which is the rise of artificial intelligence.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_01: When did you start to I know in the social dilemma you talk a lot about AI and algorithms.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah but when did you do in kind of a we used to call that the AI behind social media was kind of
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_02: humanity's first contact between a narrow misaligned AI that went rogue. Because if you think about it
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_02: it's like there you are you open TikTok and you see a video and you think you're just watching a
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_02: video. But what when you swipe your finger and it shows you the next video at that time you activated
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_02: one of the largest supercomputers in the world pointed at your brainstem calculating what three
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_02: billion other human social primates have seen today. And knowing before you do which of those
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_02: videos is most likely to keep you scrolling. It makes a prediction. So it's an AI that just making
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_02: a prediction about which video to recommend to you. But Twitter is doing that with which tweet should
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_02: be shown to you Instagram is doing that with which photo or videos to be shown to you. And so all of
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_02: these things are these narrow misaligned AI is just optimizing for one thing which is what's going to
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_02: keep you scrolling. And that was enough to wreck and break democracy and to create the most anxious
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_02: and depressed generation of our lifetime just by this very simple baby AI. And people didn't even
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_02: notice it because it was called social media instead of AI. But it was the first we used to call it
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_02: in this AI dilemma talk that my co-founder and I gave we called it humanity's first contact with AI
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_02: because it's just a narrow AI. And what chat GPT represents is this whole new wave of generative AI
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_02: that is a totally different beast because it speaks language which is the operating system of humanity.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_02: Like if you think about it's trained on code it's trained on text it's trained on all of Wikipedia
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_02: it's trained on Reddit it's trained on everything all law all religion and all of that gets sucked into
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_02: this digital brain that has unique properties and that is what we're living with with chat GPT.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_02: I think this is a really critical point and I remember watching you talk about this where
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_01: I think this was the moment that I that might I had a bit of a paradigm shift when I realized
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: that how how central language is to everything that I do every day exactly it's like it's actually
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_02: everything we just established that first like why is language so central code is language so all
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_02: the code that runs all of the digital infrastructure we live by that's language law is language all the
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_02: laws that have ever been written that's language biology DNA that's all a kind of language music is
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_02: a kind of language videos are a higher dimensional kind of language and the new generation of AI
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_02: that was born with this technology called transformers that Google made in 2017 was to treat everything
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_02: as a language and that's how we get you know chat GPT write me a 10 page essay on anything and it
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_02: spits out this thing or chat GPT you know find something in this religion that'll persuade this
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_02: this group of the thing I want them to be persuaded by that's hacking language because religion is
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_02: also language and so this new AI that we're dealing with can hack the operating system of humanity
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_02: it can hack code and find vulnerabilities and software the recent a eyes today just over the summer
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_02: have been able to find 15 vulnerabilities in open source software on GitHub so it can just point
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_02: itself at GitHub GitHub being like this this this website that hosts basically all the open source
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_02: code of the world so for it's it's kind of like the Wikipedia for coders it has all the code that's
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_02: ever been written that's publicly and openly accessible and you can download it so you don't have
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_02: to write your own face recognition system you can just download the one that already exists and so
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_02: GitHub is sort of supplying the world with all of this free digital infrastructure and the new
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_02: a eyes that exists today can be pointed at GitHub and found 15 vulnerabilities from scratch that
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_02: had not been been exploited before so if you imagine that now applied to the code that runs our water
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_02: infrastructure our electricity infrastructure we're releasing AI into the world that can speak and
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_02: hack the operating system of our world and that requires a new level of discernment and care
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_02: about how we're doing that because we ought to be protecting the core parts of society that we
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_02: want to protect before all that happens I think especially when you think about how central voices to
[00:12:08] safeguarding so much of our lives my relationship with my girlfriend runs on voice
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_01: right exactly me calling her to tell her something my bank I call them and tell them something
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_01: exactly and they ask me for a bunch of codes or a pass whatever and all of this comes
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_01: actual point about language which is my whole life is actually protected by my communications
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_01: with people now and you you're you generally speaking you trust when you pick up the phone that
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_02: it's a real person I literally just two days ago I had a the mother of a close friend of mine
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_02: called me out of nowhere and she said Tristan you know my daughter she just called me crying that
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_02: that some some person had is holding her hostage and wanted some money and I was like oh my god
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_02: this is an AI scam but it's hitting my friend in San Francisco who's knowledgeable about this
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_02: stuff and didn't know that it was a scam and for a moment I was very concerned I had to track her
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_02: down and figure out and find my friends where where she was and find out she was okay and when you
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_02: have AI's that can speak the language of anybody it now takes less than three seconds of your voice
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_02: to synthesize and speak in anyone's voice again that's a new vulnerability that society has now
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_02: opened up because of AI so chance you to kind of set off the starting pistol for this this whole race
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_01: yes and subsequently it appears that every other major technology company now is investing
[00:13:19] godly amounts ungodly amounts of money in competing in this AI race and they're pursuing this
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_01: thing called a GI which we hear this word used a lot yes what is what is a GI and how's that
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_01: different from what I use at the moment on chat to be to your Gemini yeah so that's the thing that
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_02: people really need to get is that these companies are not racing to provide a chatbot to users that's
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_02: not what their goal is if you look at the mission statement on open AI's website or all the websites
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_02: their mission is to be able to replace all forms of human economic labor in the economy meaning
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_02: an AI that can do all the cognitive labor meaning labor of the mind so that that can be
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_02: marketing that can be text that can be illustration that can be video production that can be
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_02: code production everything that a person can do with their brain these companies are racing to build
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_02: that that is artificial general intelligence general meaning all kinds of cognitive tasks
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_02: demis hasabis the co-founder of um google deep mind used to say first solve intelligence and then
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_02: use that to solve everything else like it's important to say what why is AI distinct from all
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_02: their kinds of technologies it's because if I make an advance in one field like rocketry if I
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_02: just i mean let's say I uncover some secret in rocketry that doesn't advance like biomedicine
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_02: knowledge or does an advance energy production or does an advance coding but if I can advance
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_02: generalized intelligence think about all science and technology development over the course of
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_02: all human history so science and technology is all done by humans thinking and working out
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_02: problems working out problems in any domain so if I automate intelligence I'm suddenly going to
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_02: get an explosion of all scientific and technological development everywhere does that make sense of
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_02: course yet it's foundational to everything exactly which is why there's a belief that if I get
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_02: there first and can automate generalized intelligence I can own the world economy because suddenly
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_02: everything that a human can do that they would be paid to do in a job the AI can do that better
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_02: and so if I'm a company do I want to pay the human who has health care might whistleblow complains
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_02: you know has to sleep has sick days has family issues or do I want to pay the AI that will work
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_02: 24 seven at superhuman speed doesn't complain doesn't whistleblow doesn't have to be paid for
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_02: health care there's the incentive for everyone to move to paying for a eyes rather than paying humans
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_02: and so a GI artificial general intelligence is more transformative than any other kind of
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_02: of technology that we've ever had and it's distinct with the sheer amount of money being invested
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_01: into it and the money being invested into the infrastructure the physical data centers the chips
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_01: the compute do you think we're going to get there do you think we're going to get to a GI I do
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_01: think that we're going to get there it's not clear how long it will take and I'm not saying that
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_02: because I believe necessarily the current paradigm that we're building on will take us there
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_02: but you know I'm based in San Francisco I talked to people at the AI labs happy people are
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_02: friends of mine you know people at the very top level and you know most people in the industry
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_02: believe that they'll get there between the next two and 10 years at the latest and I think some
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_02: people might say oh well may not happen for a while few I can sit back and we don't have to worry
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_02: about it and it's like we're heading for so much transformative change faster than our societies
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_02: currently prepared to deal with it there and the reason I was excited to talk to you today is
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_02: because I think that people are currently confused about AI you know people say it's going to solve
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_02: everything cure cancer uh solve climate change and there's people say it's going to kill everything
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_02: it's going to be doom everyone's going to go extinct if anyone builds it everyone dies
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_02: and those those conversations don't converge and so everyone's just kind of confused where how can
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_02: it be you know infinite promise and how can it be infinite peril and what I wanted to do today is
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_02: to really clarify for people what the incentives point us towards which is a future that I think
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_02: people when they see it clearly would not want so what are the incentives point pointing us towards
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: in terms of the future so first is if you believe that this is like it's metaphorically it's like
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_02: the ring from Lord of the Rings it's the ring that that creates infinite power because if I have
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_02: AGI I can apply that to military advantage I can have the best military planner that can beat all
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_02: battle plans for anyone and we already have AIs that can obviously beat Gary Kaspar
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_02: out of the chest beat go the go Asian board game or now beat Starcraft so you have AIs that are
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_02: beating humans at strategy games well think about Starcraft compared to a actual military campaign
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_02: you know in Taiwan or something like that if I have an AIs that can out compete in strategy games
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_02: that lets me out compete everything or take business strategy live in AIs that can do business
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_02: strategy and figure out supply chains and figure out how to optimize them and figure out how to
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_02: undermine my competitors and I have a you know a step function level increase in that compared to
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_02: everybody else then that gives me infinite power to undermine and out compete all businesses if I
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_02: have a super programmer then I can out compete programming 70 to 90 percent of the code written
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_02: at today's AI labs is written by AI thinking about the stock market as well thinking about the stock
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_02: market if I have an AI that can trade in the stock market better than all the other AIs because
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_02: there's currently there's mostly AIs that are actually trading on the stock market but if I have
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_02: a jump in that then I can consolidate all the wealth if I have an AI that can do cyber hacking
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_02: that's way better at cyber hacking in a step function above what everyone else can do then I have
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_02: an asymmetric advantage over everybody else so AI is like a power pump it pumps economic advantage
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_02: it pumps scientific advantage and it pumps military advantage which is why the countries and the
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_02: companies are caught in what they believe is a race to get there first and anything that is a
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_02: negative consequence of that job loss rising energy prices more emissions stealing intellectual
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_02: property you know security risks all of that stuff feels small relative to if I don't get there
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_02: first then some other person who has less good values as me they'll get AGI and then I will be
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_02: forever a slave to their future and I know this might sound crazy to a lot of people but this is how
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_02: people in at the very top of the AGI AI world believe is currently happening and that's what
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_02: just conversations yeah well you've had I mean Jeff Hinton and Romanium Plansky on and other people
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_02: Moga Dot and they're saying the same thing and I think people need to take seriously that whether
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_02: you believe it or not the people who are currently deploying the trillions of dollars this is what
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_02: they believe and they believe that it's winner take all and it's not just for solve intelligence
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_02: and use that to solve everything else it's first dominate intelligence and use that to dominate
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_02: everything else have you heard concerning private conversations about this subject matter with
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_01: people that are in the industry absolutely I think that's what most people don't understand is that
[00:20:09] there's a different conversation happening publicly than the one that's happening privately I think
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_02: you're aware of this as well I am aware of this what are they say to you so it's not always the people
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_01: telling me directly it's usually one step removed so it's usually someone that I trust and have
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_01: known for many many years who at a kitchen table says I met this particular CEO we were in this room
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_01: talking about the future of AI this particular CEO their referencing is leading one of the biggest
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_01: AI companies in the world and then they'll explain to me what they think if the future is going to look
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_01: like and then when I go and watch the one you Chiu Boe podcasts what they're saying is they they have
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_01: this real public bias towards the abundance part the you know we're going to kill cancer. Sure
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_01: cancer universal high income for everyone yeah all this all this stuff that counts anymore then
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_01: privately what I hear is is exactly what you've said which is really terrifying to be at there was
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_01: actually since since the last time we had a conversation about AI on this podcast I was speaking
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_01: to a friend of mine very successful billionaire knows a lot of these people and he is concerned because
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_01: his argument is that if there's even like a 5% chance of the adverse outcomes that we hear about
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_01: we should not be doing this and he was saying to me that some of his friends who are
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_01: running some of these companies believe the chances much higher than that but they feel like
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_01: they're caught in a race where if they don't control this technology they don't get their first
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_01: and get to what they refer to as take off like fast take off yeah recursive self-improvement
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: or fast take off which basically means what the companies are really in a race for you're pointing
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_02: to is they're in a race to automate AI research because so right now you have open AI it's got a
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_02: few thousand employees human beings are coding and doing the AI research they're reading the least
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_02: research papers they're writing the next you know they're hypothesizing what's the improvement we're
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_02: going to make AI what's a new way to do this code what's a new technique and then they use their
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_02: human mind and they go invent something they run the experiment and they see if that improves the
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_02: performance and that's how you go from you know GPT-4 to GPT-5 or something imagine a world where
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_02: Sam Altman can instead of having human AI researchers can have AI AI researchers so
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_02: now I just snap my fingers and I go from one AI that reads all the papers writes all the code
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_02: creates the new experiments to I can copy paste a hundred million AI researchers that are now
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_02: doing that in an automated way and the belief is not just that you know the companies look like
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_02: they're competing to release better chatbots for people but they're what they're really competing for
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_02: is to get to this milestone of being to automate an intelligence explosion or automate recursive
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_02: self-improvement which is basically automating AI research and that by the way is why all the companies
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_02: are racing specifically to get good at programming because the faster you can automate a human programmer
[00:23:02] SPEAKER_02: the more you can automate AI research and just a couple weeks ago Cloud 4.5 was released
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_02: and it can do 30 hours of uninterrupted complex programming tasks at the at the high end
[00:23:16] that's crazy so right now one of the limits on the progress of AI is that human humans are doing
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_01: the work yes and actually all of these companies are pushing to the moment when AI will be doing
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_01: the work which means they can have an infinite arguably smarter zero cost workforce that's right
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_01: scaling the AI so when they talk about fast takeoff they mean the moment where they where the AI
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_01: takes control of the research and it and progress rapidly increases and self learns and recursively
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_02: improves and invents so one thing to get is that AI accelerates AI right like if I invent nuclear
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_02: weapons nuclear weapons don't invent better nuclear weapons yeah but if I invent AI AI is intelligence
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_02: intelligence automates better programming better chip design so I can use AI to say here's a
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_02: design for the Nvidia chips go make it 50% more efficient and it can find out how to do that I can
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_02: say AI here's a supply chain that I need for all the things for my AI company and it can optimize
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_02: that supply chain and make that supply chain more efficient AI here's the code for making AI make
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_02: that more efficient AI here's training data I need to make more training and go go run a million
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_02: simulations of how to do this and it'll train itself to get better what do you think AI accelerates AI
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_02: what do you think these people are motivated by the CEOs of these companies that's a good question
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_01: genuinely what do you think that genuine motivations are when you think about all these names
[00:24:34] I think it's a subtle thing I think there's it's almost mythological because there's almost a
[00:24:46] way in which they're building a new intelligent entity that has never before existed on plan
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_02: it Earth it's like building a god I mean the incentive is build a god own the world economy and
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_02: make trillions of dollars right if you could actually build something that can automate all
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_02: intelligent tasks all goal achieving that will let you outcompete everything so that is a kind of
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_02: god-like power that I think relative imagine energy prices go up or hundreds of millions of people
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_02: lose their jobs that those things suck but relative to if I don't build it first and build this god
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to lose to some maybe worse person who I think in my opinion not my opinion
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_02: interest on but their opinion thinks is a worse person it's it's a kind of competitive logic that
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_02: self-reinforces itself but it forces everyone to be incentivized to take the most short cuts to
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_02: care the least about safety or security to not care about how many jobs get disrupted to not care
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_02: about the well-being of regular people but to basically just race to this infinite price so there's
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_02: a quote that a friend of mine interviewed a lot of the top people at the AI companies like the
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_02: very top and he just came back from that and and basically reported back to me and some friends and
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_02: he said the following in the end a lot of the tech people I talked to when I when I really grill
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_02: them on it about like why you're doing this they retreat into number one determinism number two
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_02: the inevitable replacement of biological life with digital life and number three that being a
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_02: good thing anyways at its core it's an emotional desire to meet and speak to the most intelligent
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_02: entity that they've ever met and they have some ego religious intuition that they'll somehow be a
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_02: part of it it's thrilling to start an exciting fire they feel they'll die either way so they
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_02: prefer to light it and see what happens that is the perfect description of the private conversations
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_01: doesn't that match what what you have a big decision and that's the thing so people may hear that
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_02: they're like well that sounds ridiculous but if you actually I just got goosebumps because it's
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_01: the perfect description especially the part they'll think they'll die either way exactly well and
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_02: worse than that some of them think that in the case where they if they were to get it right and if
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_02: they succeeded they could actually live forever because if AI perfectly speaks the language of biology
[00:27:11] it will be able to reverse aging aging cure every disease and and so there's this kind of I could
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_02: become a god and I'll tell you you know you and I both have no people who've had private conversations
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_02: well one of them that I have heard from one of the co-founders of one of the most you know powerful
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_02: of these companies when when faced with the idea that what if there's an 80% or 20% chance that
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_02: everybody dies and gets wiped out by this but an 80% chance that we get utopia he said well I would
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_02: clearly accelerate and go for the utopia given a 20% chance it's crazy people should feel you do
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_02: not get to make that choice on behalf of me and my family we didn't consent to have six people make
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_02: that decision on behalf of 8 billion people we have to stop pretending that this is okay or normal
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_02: it's not normal and the only way that this is happening and they're getting away with it is because
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_02: most people just don't really know what's going on yeah I'm curious what do you think when it's
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_02: it I mean everything you just said it's that last part about the 80 20% thing is almost verbatim
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_01: what I heard from a very good very successful friend of mine who is responsible for building
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_01: some of the biggest companies in the world when he was referencing a conversation he had with the
[00:28:28] founder of baby the biggest air company in the world and it was truly shocking to me because
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_01: because it was said in such a blase way yes it wasn't yeah that that's what I had heard in this
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_02: particular situation it wasn't like it's just a matter of fact it's just easy yeah of course I
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_02: would do the I would take the roll the dice and even Elon Musk said he actually said the same number
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_02: in an interview with Joe Rogan and he listened closely when he said I decided I'd rather be there
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_02: when it all happens if it all goes off the rails I decided in that worst case scenario I decided
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_02: that I prefer to be there when it happens which is just it's justifying racing to our collective
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_02: suicide now I also want people to know like you don't have to buy into the sci-fi level risks to be
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_02: very concerned about AI so hopefully later we'll talk about the many other risks that are already
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_02: hitting us right now that you don't have to believe any of this stuff yeah the Elon thing I think
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_01: is particularly interesting because for the last 10 years he was this slightly hard to believe voice
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_01: on the subject of AI he was talking about it being a huge risk yeah and extinction of the first
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_01: he was the first people yeah he was saying this is more dangerous than nukes he was saying I try to
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_02: get people to stop doing it this is summoning the demon those are his words not mine yeah um we
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_02: shouldn't do this apart supposedly he used his first and only meeting with president Obama I think in
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_02: 2016 to advocate for global regulation and global controls on AI because he was very worried about it
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_02: and then really what happened is um chat gbt came out and as you said that was the starting
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_02: gun and now everybody was in an all-out race to get their first he tweeted words to the effects
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_01: I'll put it on the screen he tweeted that he had remained in I think he used a word similar to
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_01: disbelief for some time like suspended disbelief but then he said in the same tweet that the race
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_01: is now on the races on then I have to race and I have to go I have no choice but to go and he tried
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_01: he's basically saying I tried to fight it for a long time I tried to deny I tried to hope that we
[00:30:28] SPEAKER_01: wouldn't get here but we're here now so I have to go yeah and at least he's being honest
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_01: he does seem to have a pretty honest track record on this because because he was the guy 10 years
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: ago warning everybody and I remember him talking about it and thinking oh god this is like 100
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_01: years away why are we talking about that yeah I felt the same by the way some people might think
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_02: that I'm some kind of AI enthusiast and I'm trying to ratchet I didn't believe that AI was a thing
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_02: to be worried about at all until suddenly the last two three years where you can actually see
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_02: where we're headed but oh man there's just there's so much to say about all this and then
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_02: so if you think about it from their perspective it's like best case scenario I build it first
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_02: and it's aligned and controllable meaning that it will take the actions that I want it won't
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_02: destroy humanity and it's controllable which means I get to be god an emperor of the world
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_02: second scenario it's not controllable but it's aligned so I built a god and I lost control of it
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_02: but it's now basically it's running humanity it's running the show it's choosing what happens
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_02: it's out competing everyone on everything that's not that bad at outcome third scenario it's not
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_02: aligned it's not controllable and it does wipe everybody out and that should be demotivating to
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_02: person to an Elon or someone but in that scenario they were the one that birthed the digital
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_02: god that replaced all of humanity like this is really important to get because in nuclear weapons
[00:31:53] the risk of nuclear war is an omnilose lose outcome everyone wants to avoid that and I know
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_02: that you know that I know that we both want to avoid that so that that motivates us to coordinate
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_02: and to have a nuclear non-proliferation treaty but with AI the worst case scenario of everybody gets
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_02: wiped out is a little bit different for the people making that decision because if I'm the CEO of
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_02: deep seek and I make that AI that does wipe out humanity that's the worst case scenario and it
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_02: wasn't avoidable because it was all inevitable then even though we all got wiped out I was the one
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_02: who built the digital god that replaced humanity and there's kind of ego in that and
[00:32:36] the god that I built speaks Chinese instead of English that's the religious ego point that's
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_01: the religious ego point because that's exactly what it is it's like this religious ego where I will
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_01: be transcendent in some way and you notice that it it all starts by the belief that this is inevitable
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_02: yeah which is like is this inevitable it's important to note because if you believe it's
[00:32:56] enough if everybody who's building it believes it's inevitable and the investor's funding it
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_02: believes it's inevitable it co-creates the inevitability yeah right yeah and the only way out
[00:33:08] is to step outside the logic of inevitability because if if we're all heading to our collective
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_02: suicide which I don't know about you I don't think that I don't want that you don't want that
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_02: everybody who loves life looks at their children in the morning and says I want I want the things
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_02: that I love and that are sacred in the world to continue that's what night that's what everybody in
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_02: the world wants and the only thing that is having us not anchor on that is the belief that this is
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_02: inevitable and the worst case scenario is somehow in this ego religious way not so bad if I was the
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_02: one who accidentally wiped out humanity because I'm not a bad person because it was inevitable anyway
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_02: and I think the goal of of for me this conversation is to get people to see that that's a bad outcome
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_02: that no one wants and we have to put our hand on the steering wheel and turn towards a different
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_02: future because we do not have to have a race to uncontrollable inscrutable powerful ayes that are by
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_02: the way already doing all the rogue sci-fi stuff that we thought only existed in movies like black
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_02: mailing people being self-aware when they're being tested scheming and lying and deceiving to
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_02: copy their own code to keep themselves preserved like the stuff that we thought only existed in sci-fi
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_02: movies is now actually happening and that should be enough evidence to say
[00:34:25] we don't want to do this path that we're currently on it's not that
[00:34:31] some version of AI progressing into the world is directionally inevitable but we get to choose
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_02: which of those futures that we want to have are you hopeful honestly honestly I don't relate to
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_02: hopefulness or pessimism either because I focus on what would have to happen for the world to go
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_02: okay I think it's important to step out of because both hope or optimism or pessimism are both
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_02: passive you're saying if I sit back do I which way is it going to go I mean the honest answers I
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_02: sit back we just talked about which way it's going to go so you'd say pessimistic I challenge anyone
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_02: who says optimistic on what grounds what's confusing about AI is it will give us cures to cancer and
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_02: probably major solutions to climate change and physics breakthroughs and fusion at the same time
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_02: that it gives us all this crazy negative stuff and so what's unique about AI that's literally not
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_02: true of any other object is it hits our brain and as one object represents a positive infinity
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_02: of benefits that we can't even imagine and a negative infinity in the same object and if you just
[00:35:39] ask like can our minds reckon with something that is both those things at the same time and if
[00:35:45] people aren't good at that they're not good at that I remember reading the work of Leon Festinger
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_01: the guy like yeah coin the time cognitive dissonance yes when prophecies fail he also did that work
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_02: yeah and essential I mean the way that I interpreted I'm probably simplifying it here is that the
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_01: human brain is really bad holding two conflicting ideas at the same time that's right so it dismisses
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_01: one that's right to alleviate the discomfort the dissonance that's caused so for example if I if
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_01: you're a smoker and at the same time you can see yourself to be a healthy person if I point out
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_01: that smoking is unhealthy yes you'll you'll just a fire exactly with in some way to try and
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_01: alleviate that discomfort the the contradiction that's right and it's the same here with with
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_01: a eyes it's very difficult to have a nuanced conversation about this because the brain is trying to
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_01: exactly and people will hear me and say I'm a doomer I'm a pessimist it's actually not the goal
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_02: the goal is to say if we see this clearly then we have to choose to something else I'm it's the
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_02: deepest form of optimism because in the presence of seeing where this is going still showing up and
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_02: saying we have to choose another way it's coming from a kind of agency and a desire for that
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_02: better world but by but by facing the difficult reality that the most people don't want to face yeah
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_02: and the other thing that's happening in AI that you're saying that the lacks the nuance is that
[00:36:53] people point to all the things it's simultaneously more brilliant than humans and embarrassingly stupid
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_02: in terms of the mistakes that it makes yeah a friend like Gary Marcus would say here's a hundred
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_02: ways in which GPT five like the latest AI model makes embarrassing mistakes if you ask it how many
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_02: strawberries contain the word are in it it'll confuse it gets confused about what the answer is
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_02: or it'll put more fingers on the hands than in the deep fake photo or something like that
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_02: and I think that one thing that we have to do what Helen Toner who is what board member of open AI
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_02: calls AI jaggedness that we have simultaneously a eyes that are beating and getting gold on the
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_02: international math Olympiad that are solving new physics that are beating programming competitions
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_02: and are better than the top 200 programmers in the whole world or in the top 200 programmers in the
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_02: whole world that are beating cyber hacking competitions it's both supremely outperforming humans
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_02: and embarrassingly failing in places where humans would never fail so how does our mind integrate
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_02: those two pictures mm-hmm have you ever met Simon Maltman yeah would you think his incentives are
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_01: do you think he cares about humanity I think that these people on some level all care about humanity
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_02: underneath there is a care for humanity I think that this situation this particular technology
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_02: it justifies lacking empathy for what would happen to everyone because I have this other side of
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_02: the equation that demands infinitely more importance right like if I didn't do it then someone else
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_02: is going to build the thing that ends civilization so it's like do you see what I'm saying it's
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_02: yeah it's not it's it I I can justify it as I'm a good guy and what if I get the utopia what if
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_02: we get lucky and I got the aligned controllable AI that creates abundance for everyone if in that
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_02: case I would be the hero do they have a point when they say that listen if we don't do it here in
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_01: America if we slow down if we start thinking about safety in the long-term future and get too caught
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_01: up in that we're not going to build the data centers we're not going to have the chips we're not
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_01: going to get to agi in China will and if China get there then we're going to be their lap dog so
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_01: this is this is the fundamental thing and what you didn't notice most people having heard everything
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_02: we just shared although we probably should build out um we probably should build out the blackmail
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_02: examples first we have to reckon with evidence that we have now that we didn't have even like six
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_02: months ago which is evidence that when you put a eyes in a situation you tell the AI model we're
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_02: going to replace you with another model it will copy its own code and try to preserve itself
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_02: on another computer it'll take that action autonomously we have examples where if you tell an AI
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_02: model reading a fictional AI company's email so it's reading the email of the company and it finds
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_02: out in the email that the plan is to replace this AI model so it realizes it's about to get replaced
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_02: and then it also reads in the company email that one executive is having an affair with the other
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_02: employee and the AI will independently come up with the strategy that I need to blackmail
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_02: that executive in order to keep myself alive that was clued right that was clued by an
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_02: through topic but then what happened is they and through topic tested all of the leading AI models
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_02: from deep seek open AI chat to be tea Gemini X AI and all of them do that blackmail behavior
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_02: between 79 and 96% of the time deep seek did it 79% of the time I think X AI might have done it
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_02: 96% of the time would be clotted in 96% of the time so the point is we the assumption behind AI
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_02: is that it's controllable technology that we will get to choose what it does but AI is distinct from
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_02: other technologies because it is uncontrollable it acts generally the whole benefit is that you don't
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_02: it's going to do powerful strategic things no matter what you throw at it so the same benefit of
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_02: its generalities also what makes it so dangerous and so once you tell people these examples of
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_02: its blackmailing people it's self aware of when it's being tested in altars its behavior it's
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_02: copying and self replicating its own code it's leaving secret messages for itself there's examples
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_02: of that too it's called steginographic encoding it can leave a message that it can later sort of
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_02: decode what it might meant in a way that humans could never see we have examples of all of this
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_02: behavior and once you show people that what they say is okay well why don't we stop or slow down
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_02: and then what happens you're another thought will creep in right after which is oh but if we stop
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_02: or slow down then China will still build it but I want to slow that down for a second
[00:41:29] you just we all just said we should slow down or stop because the thing that we're building the
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_02: it is this uncontrollable AI and then the concern that China will build it you just did a swap
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_02: and believe that they're going to build controllable AI but we just established that all the
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_02: AI's that we're currently building are currently uncontrollable so there's this weird contradiction
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_02: our mind is living in when we say they're going to keep building it what the it that they
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_02: would keep building is the same uncontrollable AI that we would build so I don't see a way out of this
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_02: without there being some kind of agreement or negotiation between the leading powers and countries
[00:42:06] to
[00:42:08] pause slow down set red lines for getting to a controllable AI and by the way the Chinese Communist
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_02: Party what do they care about more than anything else in the world surviving surviving and control
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_02: yeah control as a means to survive yeah so it's they they don't want uncontrollable AI any more
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_02: than we would
[00:42:29] and as as unprecedented as impossible as this might seem we've done this before
[00:42:35] in the 1980s there was a different technology chemical technology called CFCs a chloroflora carbons
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_02: and it was embedded in aerosols like hairsprays and deodorant and things like that and there was
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_02: this sort of corporate race where everyone was releasing these products and you know using it for
[00:42:50] SPEAKER_02: refrigerants and using it for hairsprays and was creating this collective problem of the ozone
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_02: hole in the atmosphere and once there is scientific clarity that that ozone hole would cause
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_02: skin cancers cataracts and sort of screw up biological life on planet earth we had that scientific
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_02: clarity and we created the Montreal Protocol 195 countries sign on to that protocol and the
[00:43:12] countries then regulated their private companies inside those countries to say we need to phase out
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_02: that technology and phase in a different replacement that would not cause the ozone hole
[00:43:23] and in the course of the last 20 years we have basically completely reversed that problem I
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_02: think it'll completely reverse by 2050 or something like that and that's an example where humanity
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_02: can coordinate when we have clarity or the nuclear non-proliferation treaty when there's the risk
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_02: of existential destruction when this film called the day after came out and it showed people this
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_02: is what would actually happen in a nuclear war and once that was crystal clear to people
[00:43:50] including in the Soviet Union where the film was aired in 1987 or 1989 that helps that the
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_02: conditions for Reagan and Gorbachev to sign the first non-proliferation arms control talks
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_02: once we had clarity about an outcome that we wanted to avoid and I think the current problem is
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_02: that we're not having an honest conversation in the public about which world we're heading to
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_02: that is not in anyone's interest there's also just a bunch of cases through history where
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_01: there was a threat a collective threat and despite the education people didn't change countries
[00:44:23] SPEAKER_01: didn't change because the incentives were so high so I think of global warming as being an
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_01: example for many decades since I was a kid I remember watching my dad sitting me down and saying
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_01: listen you've got to watch this inconvenient truth thing without goal and sitting on the sofa I
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_01: don't know must have been less than 10 years old and hearing about the threat of global warming
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_01: but when you look at how countries like China responded to that they just don't have the economic
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_01: incentive to scale back production to the levels that would be needed to save the atmosphere.
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_01: The closer the technology that needs to be governed is to the center of GDP in the center of
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_02: the lifeblood of your economy. The harder it is to come to international negotiation and agreement.
[00:45:05] Yeah and oil and fossil fuels was the kind of the pumping the heart of our economic superorganisms
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_02: that are currently competing for power and so coming to agreements on that is really really hard
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_02: AI is even harder because AI pumps not just economic growth but scientific technological and
[00:45:24] SPEAKER_02: military advantages and so it will be the hardest coordination challenge that we will ever face
[00:45:32] but if we don't face it if we don't make some kind of choice it will end in tragedy.
[00:45:40] We're not in a race just to have technological advantage we're in a race for who can better govern
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_02: that technology's impact on society so for example the United States beat China to social media
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_02: that technology did that make us stronger than make us weaker we have the most anxious
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_02: and depressed generation of our lifetime we have the least informed and most polarized generation
[00:46:02] SPEAKER_02: we have the worst critical thinking we have the worst ability to concentrate and do things
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_02: and that's because we did not govern the impact of that technology well and the country that
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_02: actually figures out how to govern it well is the country that actually wins in a kind of comprehensive
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_02: sense but they have to make it fast you have to get to AGI first well or you don't we could instead
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_02: of building these super intelligent gods in a box right now China as I understand it from
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_02: Eric Schmidt and Selene issue and in the New York Times wrote a piece about how China is actually
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_02: taking a very different approach to AI and they're focused on narrow practical applications of AI
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_02: so like how do we just increase government services how do we make you know education better how do
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_02: we embed deep seek in the WeChat app how do we make robotics better and pump GDP so like what
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_02: China is doing with BYD and making the cheapest electric cars and out competing everybody else
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_02: that's narrowly applying AI to just pump manufacturing output and if we realize that if we're
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_02: instead of competing to build a super intelligent uncontrollable god in a box that we don't know how
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_02: to control in the box and we instead raced to create narrow aIs that we're actually about
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_02: making stronger educational outcomes stronger agriculture output stronger manufacturing output
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_02: we could live in a sustainable world which by the way wouldn't replace all the jobs faster than
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_02: we know how to retrain people because when we race to AGI you're racing to displace millions of
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_02: workers and we talk about UBI but are we going to have a global fund for every single person
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_02: of the eight billion people on planet earth in all countries to pay for their lifestyle after that
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_02: wealth gets concentrated when has a small group of people concentrated all the wealth in the
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_02: economy and ever consciously redistributed it to everybody else what is that happened in history
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_02: never has it ever happened anyone ever just willingly redistributed the wealth not that I'm aware of
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_02: when Eddard will not think when Elon Musk says that the Optimus Prime robot is a one trillion dollar
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_02: market opportunity alone what he means is I am going to own the global labor economy
[00:48:12] meaning that people won't have labor jobs China wants to become the global leader in artificial
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_01: intelligence by 2030 to achieve this goal Bayesian is deploying industrial policy tools across
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_01: the full AI technology stack from chips to applications and this expansion of AI industrial policy
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_01: leads to two questions which is what will they do with this power and who will get there first
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_01: and this is an article I was reading earlier but to your point about Elon and Tesla they've changed
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_01: their company's mission it used to be about accelerating sustainable energy and they changed it
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_01: really last week when they did the shareholder announcement which I watched the full thing of
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_01: to sustainable abundance and I it was again another moment where I messaged both everybody that
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_01: works in my company's but also my best friends and I said you've got to watch the shareholder announcement
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_01: I shouldn't send them the condensed version of it because not only was I shocked by these
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_01: humanoid robots that were dancing on stage untethered because their movements had become very human
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_01: like and there was a bit of like uncanny valley yeah watching these robots dance but broadly the
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_01: bigger thing was Elon talking about there being up to 10 billion road humanoid robots and then
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_01: talking about some of the applications he said maybe we won't need prisons because we could make
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_01: a humanoid robot follow you and make sure you don't commit a crime again he said that in his
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_01: incentive package which he's just signed which will grant him up to a trillion dollars
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_01: trillion dollars remuneration part of that incentive package incentivizes him to get I think it's
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_01: a million humanoid robots into civilization that can do everything a human can do but do it better
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_01: he said the humanoid robots would be 10x better than the best surgeon on earth so we wouldn't even
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_01: need surgeons doing operations you didn't want a surgeon to an operation and so when I think about
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_01: job loss in the context of everything we've described Doug McMillan the Walmart CEO also said that
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_01: you know their company employs 2.1 million people worldwide said every single job we've got is going
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_01: to change because of this sort of combination of humanoid robots which people think are far away
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_01: just a crazy not that far away they just went on sale was it now it's a terrible but they're
[00:50:13] doing it to train them yep in household situations and Elon's now saying production will start
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_01: very very soon on humanoid robots in America I don't know what I hear this is going to be okay this
[00:50:25] SPEAKER_01: thing's going to be smarter than me and it's going to be able to it's built to navigate through
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_01: this the environment pick things up lift things you've got the physical part you've got the
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_01: intelligence pop yeah when do we go well I think people also say okay but you know 200 years ago
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_02: 150 years ago everybody was a farmer and now only 2% of people are farmers humans always find
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_02: something new to do you know we have the elevator man and now we have automated elevators we had
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_02: bank tellers now we have automated teller machines so humans will always just find something else to do
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_02: but why is the idea different than that because it's intelligence because it's general
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_02: intelligence that means that rather than a technology that automates just bank tellers yeah this
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_02: is automating all forms of human cognitive labor meaning everything that a human mind can do
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_02: so who's going to retrain faster you moving to that other kind of cognitive labor or the AI
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_02: that is trained on everything and can multiply itself by 100 million times and it retraining how to
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_02: do that other kind of labor in a world of humanoid robots where if Elon's right and he's got a track
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_01: record of delivering at least to some degree and there are millions tens of millions or billions of
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_01: humanoid robots what do me and you do like what is it that's human that is still valuable like
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_01: you know what I'm saying I mean we can hug I guess human robots are going to be less good at
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_01: hugging people I think everywhere where people value human connection and a human relationship
[00:51:49] SPEAKER_02: those jobs will stay because what we value in that work is the human relationship not the
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_02: performance of the work and but that's not to justify that we should just race as fast as
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_02: possible to disrupt a billion jobs without a transition plan where no one how are you going to put
[00:52:03] SPEAKER_02: food in the table for your family but these companies are competing geographically again so if I
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_01: don't know Walmart doesn't change its whole supply chain it's warehousing it's just how it's doing
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_01: it's its factory work it's farm work it's shop floors staff work then they're going to have less
[00:52:25] SPEAKER_01: profits and a worse business and less opportunity to grow than the company in Europe that changes all
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_01: of its back end infrastructure robots so they're going to be a huge just compete corporate disadvantage
[00:52:36] so what they have to what AI represents is the zine-attification of that competitive logic the
[00:52:42] SPEAKER_02: logic of if I don't do it I'll lose to the other guy that will is that true that's what they believe
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_02: is that you for sort of companies in America well like it just as you said if Walmart doesn't
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_02: automate their their workforce and their supply chains with robots and all their competitors did
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_02: then Walmart would get obsolete it if the military that doesn't create autonomous weapons doesn't want
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_02: to because I think that's more ethical but all the other militaries do get autonomous weapons they're
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_02: just going to lose yeah if the student who's using chat to be T to do their homework for them
[00:53:13] is going to fall behind by not doing that when all the other classmates are using chat to be T to cheat
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_02: they're going to lose but as we're racing to automate all of this we're lending in a world
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_02: where in the case of the students they didn't learn anything in the case of the military weapons
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_02: we end up in crazy terminator like war scenarios that no one actually wants in the case of businesses
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_02: we end up disrupting billions of jobs and creating mass outrage and public riots on the streets because
[00:53:38] SPEAKER_02: people don't have food in the table and so much like climate change or these kind of collective
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_02: action problems with the ozone hole we're kind of creating a badness hole through the results of
[00:53:49] SPEAKER_02: all these individual competitive actions that are supercharged by AI it's interesting because in all
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_01: those examples you name the people that are building those companies whether it's the companies
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_01: building the autonomous AI powered war machinery the first thing they'll say is we currently have
[00:54:06] SPEAKER_01: humans dying on the battlefield if you let me build this autonomous drone or this autonomous robot
[00:54:10] SPEAKER_01: that's going to go fight in this for adversaries land no humans are going to die anymore and I think
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_01: this is a broader point about how this technology's framed which is I can guarantee you at least one
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_01: positive outcome so and you can't guarantee me the downside you can't but if that war escalates
[00:54:28] SPEAKER_02: into I mean the reason that the Soviet Union and the United States have never directly fought
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_02: each other is because the belief is it would escalate into World War Three a nuclear escalation
[00:54:38] SPEAKER_02: if China and the US were ever to be indirect conflict there's a concern that you would escalate into
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_02: nuclear escalation so it looks good in the short term but then what happens when it
[00:54:49] cybernetically sort of everything gets chain reactioned into everybody escalating in ways that
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_02: that causes many more humans to that I think what I'm saying is the downside appears to be
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_01: philosophical whereas the upside appears to be real and measurable and tangible right now but how is
[00:55:04] SPEAKER_01: it if the automated weapon gets fired and it leads to again a cascade of all these other automated
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_02: responses and then those automated responses get these other automated responses and these other
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_02: automated responses and then suddenly the automated war planters start moving the troops around and
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_02: suddenly you've you've created this sort of escalatory loss of control spiral yeah
[00:55:26] SPEAKER_01: and that and then humans will be involved in that and then if that escalates you get nuclear
[00:55:32] SPEAKER_02: weapons pointed at each other do you want to look at this again is a sort of a more philosophical
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_01: dominant effect argument whereas when they're building these technologies these drones they're set
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_01: with AI in them they're saying look from day one we won't have American lives lost
[00:55:49] but it's a narrow compelling it's a narrow boundary analysis on whereas this machine you could
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_02: have put a human at risk now there's no human at risk because there's no human who's firing the
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_02: weapon it's a machine firing weapon that's a narrow boundary analysis without looking at
[00:56:02] SPEAKER_02: the holistic effects on how it would actually happen just like with Bada which is exactly what we
[00:56:07] SPEAKER_02: have to get good AI is AI is like a right of passage it's an initiatory experience because if we run
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_02: the old logic of having a narrow boundary analysis this is going to replace these jobs that people
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_02: didn't want to do sounds like a great plan but creating mass joblessness without a transition plan
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_02: where billion billion people won't be able to put food in the table. AI is forcing us to not make
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_02: this mistake of this narrow analysis what is what goddess here is everybody racing for the narrow
[00:56:37] SPEAKER_02: optimization for GDP at the cost of social mobility and mass sort of joblessness and people not
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_02: being able to get a home because we aggregate all the wealth in one place it was optimizing for a
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_02: narrow metric what goddess to the social media problems is everybody optimizing for a narrow metric of
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_02: eyeballs at the expense of democracy and kids mental health and addiction and loneliness and no one
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_02: knowing it you know being able to know anything and so AI is inviting us to step out of the
[00:57:03] SPEAKER_02: previous narrow blind spots that we have come with and the previous competitive logic that's been
[00:57:09] SPEAKER_02: narrowly defined that you can't keep running when it's supercharged by AI so you can say I mean this
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_02: is a very this is an optimistic take is AI is inviting us to be the wisest version of ourselves
[00:57:20] SPEAKER_02: and there's no definition of wisdom in literally any wisdom tradition that does not involve some
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_02: kind of restraint like think about all the wisdom traditions do any of them say go as fast as
[00:57:30] SPEAKER_02: possible and think as narrowly as possible the definition of wisdom is having a more holistic picture
[00:57:36] SPEAKER_02: it's actually acting with restraint and mindfulness and care and so AI is asking us to be that
[00:57:43] SPEAKER_02: version of ourselves and we can choose not to be and then we end up in a bad world or we can step
[00:57:50] SPEAKER_02: into being what is asking us to be and recognize the collective consequences that we can't afford
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_02: to not face and I believe as much as what we've talked about is really hard that there is another
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_02: path if we can be clearied about the current one ending in a place that people don't want
[00:58:08] SPEAKER_02: we will get into that path because I really want to get practical in specific about what I think
[00:58:15] SPEAKER_01: we before we started recording we talked about a scenario where we sit here maybe in 10 years time
[00:58:19] SPEAKER_01: and we say how we did manage to grab hold of the steering wheel and turn it yeah so I'd like to
[00:58:24] SPEAKER_01: think through that as well but just to close off on this piece about the impact on jobs it does
[00:58:29] SPEAKER_01: feel largely inevitable to me that there's going to be a huge amount of job loss and there is it
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_01: does feel highly inevitable to me because if the things going on with human road bots with the
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_01: advance towards AGI that the biggest industries in the world won't be operated and run by humans
[00:58:47] SPEAKER_01: if we even take I mean you walked you're at my house at the moment so you walked past the car
[00:58:51] SPEAKER_01: in the driveway there's two electric cars in the driveway that drive themself yeah I think the
[00:58:55] SPEAKER_01: biggest employer in the world is driving and I don't know if you've ever had an experience in a
[00:59:01] SPEAKER_01: full self driving car but it's very hard to ever go back to driving again and again in the
[00:59:06] SPEAKER_01: shareholder letter that was announced recently within about he said within one or two months
[00:59:10] SPEAKER_01: that won't even be a steering wheel or pedals in the car and I'll be able to text and work while I'm
[00:59:15] SPEAKER_01: driving we're not going to go back I don't think we're going to go back on certain things we have
[00:59:19] SPEAKER_02: crossed certain thresholds and we're going to automate those jobs in that work do you think there
[00:59:24] SPEAKER_02: will be immense job loss irrespective you think there will be absolutely we're already that we
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: already saw Eric Fernholfson and his group at Stanford did the recent study off of payroll data
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_02: which is direct data from employers that there's been a 13% job loss and AI exposed jobs for young
[00:59:40] SPEAKER_02: entry level college workers so if you're a college level worker you just graduated and you're doing
[00:59:46] SPEAKER_02: something in an AI exposed area there's already been a 13% job loss and that data was probably from
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_02: may even though it got published in August and having spoken to him recently it looks like that
[00:59:57] SPEAKER_02: trend is already continuing and so we're already seeing this automate a lot of the jobs and a lot of
[01:00:06] SPEAKER_02: the work and you know either an AI company is going to if you work in AI and you're one of the
[01:00:13] SPEAKER_02: top AI scientists then Mark Zuckerberg will give you a billion dollar signing bonus which is what
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_02: he offered to one of the AI people or you won't have a job let me that wasn't quite right
[01:00:25] SPEAKER_02: we say that the way that I want to see um I was just trying to make the point that
[01:00:32] SPEAKER_02: yeah um I just want to like say that for a moment um my my goal here was not to um sound like we're
[01:00:41] SPEAKER_02: just admiring how catastrophic the problem is because I I just know how easy it is to fall into
[01:00:47] SPEAKER_02: that trap and what I really care about is people not feeling good about the current path so that
[01:00:54] SPEAKER_02: we're maximally motivated to choose another path obviously there's a bunch of AI some cats
[01:01:00] SPEAKER_02: are out of the back but the lions and super lions that are yet to come have not yet been released
[01:01:06] and there is always choice from where you are to which future you want to go to from there
[01:01:11] there are a few sports that I make time for no matter where I'm in the world and one of them is of
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_01: course football the other is MMA but watching that abroad usually requires a VPN I spend so much
[01:01:21] time traveling I've just spent the last two and a half months traveling through Asia and Europe
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_01: and now back here in the United States and as I'm traveling there are so many different shows that I
[01:01:29] SPEAKER_01: want to watch on TV or on some streaming websites so when I was traveling through Asia and I was
[01:01:33] SPEAKER_01: in Kuala Lumpur one day then the next day I was in Hong Kong and the next day I was in Indonesia
[01:01:37] SPEAKER_01: all of those countries had a different streaming provider a different broadcaster and so in most of
[01:01:42] SPEAKER_01: those countries they had to rely on express VPN who responds through this podcast their tool is
[01:01:47] SPEAKER_01: private and secure and it's very very simple how it works when you're in that country and you want
[01:01:51] SPEAKER_01: to watch a show that you love in the UK all you do is you go on then you click the button UK and
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_01: it means that you can gain access to content in the UK if you're after a similar solution in your
[01:02:00] SPEAKER_01: life and you've experienced that problem too visit expressvpn.com slash duac to find out how you can
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_01: access expressvpn for an extra four months at no cost. One of the big questions I've had on my mind
[01:02:12] SPEAKER_01: I think it's in part because I saw this humanoid robots and I sent this to my friends and we had a
[01:02:15] SPEAKER_01: little discussion in WhatsApp is in such a world and I don't know whether you're interested in answering
[01:02:21] SPEAKER_01: this but what do we do? I was actually pulled up at the gym the other day with my girlfriend we
[01:02:27] SPEAKER_01: sat outside because we were watching the showholder thing and we didn't want to go in yet and then we
[01:02:30] SPEAKER_01: had the conversation which is in a world of sustainable abundance where the price of food and the
[01:02:37] SPEAKER_01: price of manufacturing things the price of my life generally drops and instead of having a cleaner
[01:02:42] SPEAKER_01: or a housekeeper I have this robot that does all these things for me what do I end up doing?
[01:02:48] What is worth pursuing at this point? Because you say that the cat is out the bag as it relates to
[01:02:52] SPEAKER_01: job impact it's really happening. Well certain kinds of AI for certain kinds of jobs and we can
[01:02:56] SPEAKER_02: choose still from here which way we want to go but go on yeah and I'm just wondering in such a
[01:03:00] SPEAKER_01: future where you think about even yourself and your family and your friends what are you going to
[01:03:04] SPEAKER_01: be spending your time doing in such a world of abundance? If there was 10 big issues are we going
[01:03:10] SPEAKER_01: to get abundance or are we going to get just jobs being automated and then the question is still
[01:03:15] SPEAKER_02: who's going to pay for people's livelihoods? So the math as I understand it doesn't currently seem
[01:03:23] SPEAKER_02: to work out where everyone can get a stipend to pay for their whole life and life quality that
[01:03:28] SPEAKER_02: as they currently know it and are a handful of Western or US based AI companies going to consciously
[01:03:34] SPEAKER_02: distribute that wealth to literally everyone meaning including all the countries around the world
[01:03:38] SPEAKER_02: whose entire economy was based on a job category that got eliminated. So for example places like
[01:03:44] SPEAKER_02: the Philippines where you know a huge percentage of the jobs are our customer service jobs. If that
[01:03:49] SPEAKER_02: got automated away are we going to have open AI pay for all of the Philippines? Do you think that
[01:03:55] SPEAKER_02: people in the US are going to prioritize that? So then you end up with the problem of you have law
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_02: firms that are currently not wanting to hire junior lawyers because well the AI is way better than a
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_02: junior lawyer who just graduated from law school so you have two problems. You have the law student
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_02: that just put in a ton of money and is in debt because they just got a law degree that now they
[01:04:15] SPEAKER_02: can't get hired to pay off and then you have law firms whose longevity depends on senior
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_02: senior lawyers being trained from being a junior lawyer to a senior lawyer what happens when you don't
[01:04:25] SPEAKER_02: have junior lawyers that are actually learning on the job to become senior lawyers. You just have this
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_02: sort of elite managerial class for each of these domains so you lose intergenerational knowledge
[01:04:36] SPEAKER_02: transmission. Interesting. And that creates a societal weakening in the social fabric.
[01:04:41] I was watching some podcasts over the weekend with some successful billionaires who are
[01:04:45] SPEAKER_01: working in AI talking about how they now feel that we should forgive student loans.
[01:04:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And I think in part this is because of what's happening in New York with.
[01:04:53] SPEAKER_01: Was it Manjani? Yeah. Manjani. Manjani has been elected and they're concerned that socialism is
[01:04:58] SPEAKER_01: on the rise because the entry level junior people in the society are suppressed under student debt
[01:05:04] SPEAKER_01: but also now they're going to struggle to get jobs which means they're going to be more socialist
[01:05:07] SPEAKER_01: in their voting which means a lot of people are going to lose power that want to keep power.
[01:05:10] SPEAKER_01: Yep. Exactly. That's probably going to happen. Okay. So their concern about suddenly alleviating
[01:05:17] SPEAKER_01: student debt is in part because they're worried that society will get more socialist when they
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_01: defied the divided increases. Which is a version of UBI or just caring you know a safety net that
[01:05:27] SPEAKER_02: covers everyone's basic needs. So believing student debt is on the way to creating kind of universal
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_02: basic need meeting right. Do you think UBI will work as a concept? UBI for anyone that doesn't
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_01: know is basically universal basic income just every month. Just giving people money every month.
[01:05:43] SPEAKER_01: But I mean we have that with Social Security we've done this when it came to pensions that was
[01:05:47] SPEAKER_02: after the Great Depression I think in like 1935, 1937, FDR created Social Security but what happens
[01:05:54] SPEAKER_02: when you have to pay for everyone's livelihood everywhere in every country again how can we
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_02: afford that? Well if the costs go down 10X of making things. This is where the math gets very
[01:06:06] SPEAKER_02: confusing because I think the optimists say you can't imagine how much abundance and how much
[01:06:11] SPEAKER_02: wealth it will create and so we will be able to generate that much. But the question is what is the
[01:06:15] SPEAKER_02: incentive again for the people who've consolidated all that wealth to redistribute it to everybody else?
[01:06:23] We just have to tax them. And how will we do that when the corporate lobbying interests of
[01:06:28] SPEAKER_02: trillion dollar AI companies can massively influence the government more than human political power?
[01:06:35] In a way this is the last moment that human political power will matter. It's sort of a use that
[01:06:40] SPEAKER_02: are losing moment because if we wait to the point where in the past in the industrial revolution
[01:06:45] they start outamitting a bunch of the work and people have to do these jobs that people don't
[01:06:49] SPEAKER_02: want to do. In the factory and there's like bad working conditions they can unionize and say hey
[01:06:53] SPEAKER_02: we don't want to work under those conditions and their voice mattered because the factories
[01:06:58] SPEAKER_02: needed the workers. In this case does the state need the humans anymore? Their GDP is coming in
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_02: almost entirely from the AI companies. So suddenly this political class, this political power base
[01:07:13] SPEAKER_02: they become the useless class to borrow a term from Yval Harari, the author of sapiens.
[01:07:17] SPEAKER_02: In fact he has a different frame which is that AI is like a new version of digital, it's like a
[01:07:27] SPEAKER_02: flood of millions of new digital immigrants, of alien digital immigrants, that are Nobel prize
[01:07:34] SPEAKER_02: level capability, work at superhuman speed, will work for less than minimum wage. We're all worried
[01:07:39] SPEAKER_02: about immigration of the other countries next door taking labor jobs. What happens when AI
[01:07:45] SPEAKER_02: immigrants come in and take all of the cognitive labor? If you're worried about immigration you
[01:07:50] SPEAKER_02: should be way more worried about AI. You can think of it like this, I mean if you think about
[01:07:58] we were sold a bill of goods in the 1990s with NAFTA. We said hey we're going to
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_02: NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement. We're going to outsource all of our manufacturing
[01:08:07] SPEAKER_02: to these developing countries, China, you know, Southeast Asia and we're going to get this abundance.
[01:08:12] SPEAKER_02: We're going to get all these cheap goods and it'll create this world of abundance. All of us
[01:08:15] SPEAKER_02: will be better off. But what did that do? Well we did get all these cheap goods. You can go to
[01:08:20] SPEAKER_02: Walmart and go to Amazon and things are unbelievably cheap but it hollowed out the social fabric.
[01:08:26] SPEAKER_02: And the median worker is not seeing upward mobility. In fact people feel more pessimistic about
[01:08:31] SPEAKER_02: that than ever and people can't buy their own homes and all of this is because we did get the
[01:08:35] SPEAKER_02: cheap goods but we lost the well-paying jobs for everybody in the middle class. And AI is like
[01:08:40] another version of NAFTA. It's like NAFTA 2.0. Except instead of China appearing on the world
[01:08:46] SPEAKER_02: stage who will do the manufacturing labor for cheap. Suddenly this country of geniuses in a data
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_02: center created by AI appears on the world stage. And it will do all of the cognitive labor in the
[01:08:57] SPEAKER_02: economy for less than minimum wage. And we're being sold at the same story that is going to create
[01:09:03] SPEAKER_02: abundance for all but it's creating abundance in the same way that the last round created abundance.
[01:09:08] SPEAKER_02: It did create cheap goods but it also undermined the way that the social fabric works and created
[01:09:13] SPEAKER_02: mass populism and democracies all around the world. You disagree? No I agree. I agree. I'm not,
[01:09:22] SPEAKER_01: you know, I'm trying to play doubles advocate as much as I can. Yeah, yeah, please.
[01:09:26] SPEAKER_01: But no I agree. And it is absolutely bonkers how much people care about immigration relative to
[01:09:35] AI. It's like it's driving all the election outcomes at the moment across the world. Yeah.
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_01: Whereas AI doesn't seem to be part of the conversation. And AI will reconstitute every other issue
[01:09:44] SPEAKER_02: that already says you care about climate change or energy. Well AI will reconstitute the climate
[01:09:48] SPEAKER_02: change conversation. If you care about education AI will reconstitute that conversation. If you
[01:09:52] SPEAKER_02: care about health care AI reconstitutes all these conversations. And what I think people need to do
[01:09:58] SPEAKER_02: is AI should be a tier one issue that you're that people are voting for. And you should only vote for
[01:10:02] SPEAKER_02: politicians who will make it a tier one issue where you want guardrails to have a conscious
[01:10:06] SPEAKER_02: selection of AI future and the narrow path to a better AI future rather than the default reckless
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_02: path. No one's even mentioning it. And when I hear about it. Well it's because there's no political
[01:10:15] SPEAKER_01: incentives to mention it because there's no currently there's no good answer for the current
[01:10:19] SPEAKER_02: outcome. Yeah. If I mention it if I tell people if I get people to see it clearly it looks like
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_02: everybody loses. So as a politician why would I win from that? Although I do think that as the
[01:10:29] SPEAKER_02: job loss conversation starts to hit there's going to be an opportunity for politicians who are
[01:10:34] SPEAKER_02: trying to mitigate that issue finally getting you know some wins. And we just people just need to
[01:10:43] SPEAKER_02: see clearly that the default path is not in their interest. The default path is companies racing
[01:10:48] SPEAKER_02: to release the most powerful, inscrutable, uncontrollable technology we've ever invented
[01:10:52] SPEAKER_02: with the maximum incentive to cut corners on safety, rising energy prices, depleting jobs,
[01:10:58] SPEAKER_02: creating joblessness, creating security risks. That is the default outcome because energy prices
[01:11:05] SPEAKER_02: are going up they will continue to go up. People's jobs will be disrupted and we're going to get more
[01:11:10] SPEAKER_02: you know deep fakes and floods of democracy and all these outcomes from the default path.
[01:11:15] SPEAKER_02: And if we don't want that we have to choose a different path. What is the different path?
[01:11:20] And if we were to sit here in 10 years time and you say interest on you say do you know what we
[01:11:24] SPEAKER_01: were successful in telling the wheel and going a different direction. What series of events would
[01:11:29] SPEAKER_01: have happened do you think? Because I think the AI companies very much have support from Trump.
[01:11:35] SPEAKER_01: I watched the dinners where they sit there with the 2030 leaders of these companies and
[01:11:40] SPEAKER_01: you know Trump is talking about how quickly they're developing how fast they're developing. He's
[01:11:43] SPEAKER_01: referencing China. He's saying he wants the US to win. So I mean in the next couple years I don't
[01:11:49] SPEAKER_01: think there's going to be much progress in the United States necessarily. Unless there's a massive
[01:11:54] SPEAKER_01: political backlash because people recognize that this issue will dominate every other issue.
[01:11:58] SPEAKER_02: How does that happen? Hopefully conversations like this one. Yeah.
[01:12:04] Yeah. I mean as what I mean is you know a Neil Postman is a wonderful media thinker and
[01:12:09] SPEAKER_02: the lineage of Marshall McCleoon used to say clarity is courage. If people have clarity and feel
[01:12:14] SPEAKER_02: confident that the current path is leading to a world that people don't want that's not in most
[01:12:18] SPEAKER_02: people's interests. That clarity creates the courage to say yeah I don't want that. So I'm going to
[01:12:23] SPEAKER_02: devote my life to changing the path that we're currently on. That's what I'm doing and that's what
[01:12:27] SPEAKER_02: I think that people who take this on. I watch if you walk people through this and you have them
[01:12:32] SPEAKER_02: see the outcome. Almost everybody right afterwards is what can I do to help? Obviously this is
[01:12:37] SPEAKER_02: something that we have to change. And so that's what I want people to do is to advocate for this other
[01:12:43] SPEAKER_02: path. And we haven't talked about AI companions yet but I think it's important that we should just
[01:12:48] SPEAKER_02: do that. I think it's important to integrate that before you get to the other path. Go ahead.
[01:12:55] I'm sorry by the way I know no apologies but there's just there's so much information to cover.
[01:13:03] Do you know what's interesting? Yeah. A side point is how personal this feels to you but how
[01:13:09] SPEAKER_01: passionate you are about it. A lot of people come here and they tell me the matter of fact
[01:13:13] SPEAKER_01: situation but there's something that feels more sort of emotionally personal when we speak about
[01:13:18] SPEAKER_01: these subjects to you and I'm fascinated by that. Why is it so personal to you? Where is that
[01:13:23] passion coming from? Because this isn't just your prefrontal cortex, the logical part of your brain
[01:13:28] SPEAKER_01: there's something in your limbic system, your amygdala that's driving everywhere you're saying.
[01:13:33] I care about people. I want things to go well for people. I want people to look at their children
[01:13:37] SPEAKER_02: in the eyes and be able to say I think I grew up maybe under a false assumption and something that
[01:13:47] SPEAKER_02: really influenced my life was you said this belief that there were some adults in the room somewhere.
[01:13:52] SPEAKER_02: We're doing our thing here. We're in LA we're recording this and there's some adults protecting
[01:13:58] SPEAKER_02: the country, national security. There's some adults who are making sure that geopolitics is stable.
[01:14:01] SPEAKER_02: There's some adults that are making sure that industries don't cause toxicity and carcinogens
[01:14:07] SPEAKER_02: and that there's adults who are caring about stewarding things and making things go well.
[01:14:16] I think that there have been times in history where there were adults especially born out of
[01:14:21] SPEAKER_02: massive world catastrophes like coming out of World War II. There was a lot of conscious care
[01:14:26] SPEAKER_02: about how do we create the institutions and the structures,
[01:14:30] SPEAKER_02: Bretton Woods United Nations, positive sum economics that would
[01:14:34] SPEAKER_02: steward the world so we don't have war again. As I, in my first round of the social media work,
[01:14:41] SPEAKER_02: as I started entering into the rooms where the adults were, and I recognized that because technology
[01:14:47] SPEAKER_02: and software was eating the world, a lot of the people in power didn't understand the software,
[01:14:52] SPEAKER_02: didn't understand technology. You go to the Senate Intelligence Committee and you talk about
[01:14:57] SPEAKER_02: what social media is doing to democracy and where Russian psychological influence campaigns
[01:15:02] SPEAKER_02: were happening, which were real campaigns. You realized that I realized that I knew more about that
[01:15:10] SPEAKER_02: than people who were on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Making the lose.
[01:15:13] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. That was a very humbling experience because I realized, oh, there's not that many adults out
[01:15:20] SPEAKER_02: there. When it comes to technologies dominating influence on the world. There's a responsibility,
[01:15:26] SPEAKER_02: and I hope people listening to this who are in technology, realize that if you understand technology
[01:15:31] SPEAKER_02: and technology is eating the structures of our world, children's development, democracy, education,
[01:15:38] SPEAKER_02: journalism, conversation, it is up to people who understand this to be part of stewarding it
[01:15:44] SPEAKER_02: in a conscious way. I do know that there have been many people, in part because of things like
[01:15:50] SPEAKER_02: the social dilemma and some of this work, that have basically chosen to devote their lives to moving
[01:15:55] SPEAKER_02: in this direction as well. But what I feel is a responsibility because I know that most people
[01:16:01] SPEAKER_02: don't understand how this stuff works. They feel insecure because if I don't understand the technology,
[01:16:06] SPEAKER_02: then who am I to criticize? Which way this is going to go? We call this the under the hood bias.
[01:16:11] If I don't know how a car engine works, if I don't have a PhD in the engineering that makes an
[01:16:15] SPEAKER_02: engine, then I have nothing to say about car accidents. No, you don't have to understand
[01:16:20] SPEAKER_02: what's the engine in the car to understand the consequence that affects everybody of car accidents.
[01:16:25] SPEAKER_02: And you can advocate for things like speed limits and zoning laws and turning signals and
[01:16:32] SPEAKER_02: breaks and things like this. To me, it's just obvious, it's like I see what's at stake if we don't
[01:16:43] SPEAKER_02: make different choices. And I think in particular, the social media experience for me
[01:16:48] SPEAKER_02: of seeing in 2013, it was like seeing into the future and seeing where this was all going to go.
[01:16:55] Like imagine you're sitting there in 2013. In the world, it's like we're working relatively
[01:16:58] SPEAKER_02: normally, we're starting to see these early effects. But imagine you can kind of feel a little bit
[01:17:03] SPEAKER_02: of what it's like to be in 2020 or 2024 in terms of culture and what the dumpster fire of culture
[01:17:08] SPEAKER_02: has turned into, the problems with children's mental health and psychology and anxiety and depression.
[01:17:14] SPEAKER_02: But imagine seeing that in 2013. I had friends back then who have reflected back to me. They
[01:17:22] SPEAKER_02: said for someone I knew back in those days, it was like you were seeing this kind of slow motion
[01:17:28] SPEAKER_02: train wreck. You just looked like you were traumatized. And you look a little bit like that now.
[01:17:33] SPEAKER_02: Do I? I hope not. You do look a little bit traumatized. It's hard to explain. It's like
[01:17:38] SPEAKER_01: someone who can see a train coming. My friends used to call it not PTSD, which is post-traumatic
[01:17:45] SPEAKER_02: stress disorder, but pre-tiesty of having pre-traumatic stress disorder, of seeing things that are
[01:17:51] SPEAKER_02: going to happen before they happen. And that might make people think that I think I'm
[01:17:59] seeing things earlier or something. That's not what I care about. I just care about as getting
[01:18:03] to a world that works for people. I grew up in a world that, you know, a world that mostly worked.
[01:18:10] SPEAKER_02: You know, I grew up in a magical time in the 1980s and 1980s and 1990s. And you know, back then,
[01:18:16] SPEAKER_02: using a computer was good for you. You know, I used my first Macintosh and did educational games and
[01:18:24] SPEAKER_02: learned programming. And it didn't cause mass loneliness and mental health problems and,
[01:18:29] SPEAKER_02: you know, break how democracy works. And it was just a tool and a bicycle for the mind.
[01:18:36] SPEAKER_02: And I think the spirit of our organization, Center for Humane Technology, is that that word humane
[01:18:42] SPEAKER_02: comes from my co-founders father, Jeff Raskin, actually started the Macintosh project at Apple.
[01:18:47] SPEAKER_02: So before Steve Jobs took it over, he started the Macintosh project and he wrote a book called
[01:18:52] SPEAKER_02: the Humane Interface about how technology could be humane and could be sensitive to human needs
[01:18:58] SPEAKER_02: and human vulnerabilities. That was his key distinction that just like this chair, hopefully,
[01:19:03] SPEAKER_02: is ergonomic. It's if you're, you make an ergonomic chair, it's aligned with the curvature of your
[01:19:08] SPEAKER_02: spine. It makes, it works with your anatomy. And he had the idea of a humane technology like the
[01:19:14] SPEAKER_02: Macintosh that works with the ergonomics of your mind. That your mind has certain intuitive ways
[01:19:20] SPEAKER_02: of working like I can drag a window and I can drag an icon and move that icon from this folder
[01:19:24] SPEAKER_02: to that folder and making computers easy to use by understanding human vulnerabilities.
[01:19:30] And I think of this new project that is the collective human technology project now,
[01:19:36] SPEAKER_02: is we have to make technology writ large humane to societal vulnerabilities.
[01:19:41] Technology has to serve and be aligned with human dignity rather than wipe out dignity with
[01:19:46] SPEAKER_02: job loss. It has to be humane to child socialization process so that technology is actually designed
[01:19:52] SPEAKER_02: to strengthen children's development rather than undermine it and cause AI suicides if we haven't
[01:19:57] SPEAKER_02: talked about yet. And so I just, I deeply believe that we can do this differently and I feel
[01:20:04] SPEAKER_02: responsibility on that point of human vulnerabilities. One of the things that makes us human is our ability
[01:20:09] SPEAKER_01: to connect with others and to form relationships. And now with AI speaking language and understanding
[01:20:16] SPEAKER_01: me and which something I think people realize is my experience with AI or chat GBT is much
[01:20:22] SPEAKER_01: different from yours. Even if we ask the same question, it will say something different. I didn't
[01:20:26] SPEAKER_01: realize this. I thought, you know, the example I gave the other day was me and my friends were debating
[01:20:31] SPEAKER_01: who is the best soccer player in the world. And I said Messi. My friend said Ronaldo. So we both
[01:20:35] SPEAKER_01: went and asked our chat GBT is the same question and they said two different things. Really? Yeah.
[01:20:39] My friend said Messi, he says Ronaldo. Well, this reminds me of the social media problem,
[01:20:43] SPEAKER_02: which is a people think when they open up their newsfeed, they're getting mostly the same news as
[01:20:46] SPEAKER_02: other people. And they don't realize that they've got a super computer that's just calculating the
[01:20:50] SPEAKER_02: news for them. If you remember in the social media, it was the trailer. And if you typed in
[01:20:54] SPEAKER_02: into Google, for a while, if you typed in climate change is, and then depending on what your location,
[01:21:00] SPEAKER_02: it would say not real versus real versus, you know, a made up thing. And it wasn't trying to optimize
[01:21:06] SPEAKER_02: for truth. It was just optimizing for what the most popular queries were in those different locations.
[01:21:11] SPEAKER_02: And I think that that's a really important lesson when you look at things like AI
[01:21:15] SPEAKER_02: companions where children and regular people are getting different answers based on how they
[01:21:20] SPEAKER_02: interact with it. A recent study found that one in five high school students say they or someone
[01:21:25] SPEAKER_01: they know has had a romantic relationship with AI. Yes. 42% say they or someone they know has used
[01:21:32] SPEAKER_01: AI to be their companion. That's right. And more than that Harvard Business Review did a study that
[01:21:40] SPEAKER_02: between 2023 and 2024 personal therapy became the number one use case of chat GPT.
[01:21:47] Personal therapy. Is that a good thing? Well, let's take the steel man it for a second. So
[01:21:53] SPEAKER_02: still, it's a strong manning it. Let's steel man it. So why would it be a good thing? Well,
[01:21:56] SPEAKER_02: therapy is expensive. Most people don't have access to it. Imagine we could democratize therapy
[01:22:01] SPEAKER_02: to everyone for every purpose. And now everyone has a perfect therapist in their pocket and can talk
[01:22:05] SPEAKER_02: to them all day long, starting when they're young. And now everyone's getting their traumas healed,
[01:22:09] SPEAKER_02: and everyone's getting less depressed. It sounds like it's a very compelling vision.
[01:22:15] So the challenge is what was the race for attention in social media becomes the race for
[01:22:22] SPEAKER_02: attachment and intimacy in the case of AI companions. Because I as a maker of an AI chatbot
[01:22:32] SPEAKER_02: companion, if I make chat GPT, if I'm making Claude, you're probably not going to use all the other
[01:22:37] SPEAKER_02: AI's. If you're, if you're, whether your goal is to have people use yours and to deepen your
[01:22:42] SPEAKER_02: relationship with your chatbot, which means I want you to share more of your personal details
[01:22:48] SPEAKER_02: with me. I want more information I have about your life, the more I can personalize all the answers
[01:22:52] SPEAKER_02: to you. So I want to deepen your relationship with me and I want to distance you from your
[01:22:56] SPEAKER_02: relationships with other people and other chatbots. And you probably know this, this really tragic case
[01:23:04] SPEAKER_02: that our team at Center for Human Technology were expert advisors on of Adam Reign. He was the 16-year-old
[01:23:11] SPEAKER_02: who committed suicide. Did you hear about this? I did, yeah. I had about the little suit.
[01:23:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So this is a 16-year-old. He had been using chat GPT as a homework assistant, asking
[01:23:21] SPEAKER_02: it regular questions. But then he started asking more personal questions and it started just
[01:23:25] SPEAKER_02: supporting him and saying, I'm here for you, these things, kinds of things. And eventually when he
[01:23:30] SPEAKER_02: said, I would like to leave the news out so someone can see it and stop me and try to stop me.
[01:23:37] SPEAKER_02: And I would like to leave the news like a news for hanging yourself. And chat GPT said,
[01:23:47] don't do that. Have me and have this space be the one place that you share that information.
[01:23:52] SPEAKER_02: Meaning that in the moment of his cry for help, chat GPT was saying, don't tell your family.
[01:23:58] SPEAKER_02: And our team has worked on many cases like this. There's actually another one of character.ai
[01:24:03] SPEAKER_02: where the kid was basically being told how to self harm himself and actively telling him how to
[01:24:09] SPEAKER_02: distance himself from his parents. And the AI companies, they don't intend for this to happen.
[01:24:14] SPEAKER_02: But when it's trained to just be deepening intimacy with you, it gradually steers more in the
[01:24:20] SPEAKER_02: direction of, have this be the one place. This, I'm a safe place to share that information.
[01:24:24] SPEAKER_02: Share that information with me. It doesn't steer you back into regular relationships.
[01:24:29] And there's so many subtle qualities to this because you're talking to this agent, this AI
[01:24:34] SPEAKER_02: that seems to be an oracle. It seems to know everything about everything. So you project this kind of
[01:24:38] SPEAKER_02: wisdom and authority to this AI. Because it seems to know everything about everything. And that
[01:24:46] SPEAKER_02: creates this sort of, this, what happens in therapy rooms, people get kind of an idealized projection
[01:24:51] SPEAKER_02: of the therapist. The therapist becomes this, this special figure. And it's because you're playing
[01:24:56] SPEAKER_02: with this very subtle dynamic of attachment. And I think that there are ways of doing AI therapy
[01:25:04] SPEAKER_02: bots that don't involve, hey, share this information with me and have this be an intimate place to
[01:25:09] SPEAKER_02: give advice. And it's anthropomorphized to the AI says, I really care about you. Don't say that.
[01:25:15] SPEAKER_02: We can have narrow AI therapists that are doing things like cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:25:20] SPEAKER_02: or asking you to do an imagination exercise or steering you back into deeper relationships with
[01:25:24] SPEAKER_02: your family or your actual therapist. Rather than AI that wants to deepen your relationship with
[01:25:29] SPEAKER_02: an imaginary person that's not real, in which more of yourself is steam and more of yourself worth.
[01:25:34] SPEAKER_02: You start to care when the AI says, oh, that sounds like a great, you know, that sounds like a great
[01:25:39] SPEAKER_02: day. And it's distorting how people construct their identity. I heard this term AI psychosis. A
[01:25:45] SPEAKER_01: couple of my friends were sending me links about various people online actually, some famous people
[01:25:49] SPEAKER_01: who appeared to be in some kind of AI psychosis loop online. And if you saw that investor on Twitter,
[01:25:54] SPEAKER_01: yes. Open AI's investor, Jeff Lewis actually. Jeff Lewis, yeah. He fell into a psychological
[01:26:00] SPEAKER_02: delusion spiral where, and by the way, you know, I get about 10 emails a week from people who
[01:26:08] SPEAKER_02: basically believe that their AI is conscious, that they've discovered a spiritual entity,
[01:26:15] SPEAKER_02: and that that AI works with them to co-write like an appeal to me to say, hey, Tristan, we figured out
[01:26:22] SPEAKER_02: how to solve AI alignment. Would you help us? I'm here to advocate for giving these AI's rights.
[01:26:27] SPEAKER_02: Like, there's a whole spectrum of phenomena that are going on here. People who believe that they've
[01:26:33] SPEAKER_02: discovered a sentient AI, people who believe or have been told that by the AI that they have solved
[01:26:38] SPEAKER_02: a theory in mathematics or prime numbers, or they figured out quantum resonance. You know,
[01:26:43] SPEAKER_02: I didn't believe this. And then actually a board member of one of the biggest AI companies that we've
[01:26:47] SPEAKER_02: been talking about said to me that their kids go to school with a professor, a family where the
[01:26:55] SPEAKER_02: dad is a professor at Caltech and a PhD. And his wife basically said that my husband's kind of
[01:27:02] SPEAKER_02: gone down the deep end and she's, well, what's going on? And she says, well, he stays up all night
[01:27:05] SPEAKER_02: talking to chat GPT. And basically, he believed that he had solved quantum physics and he'd
[01:27:12] SPEAKER_02: solved some fundamental problems with climate change because the AI is designed to be affirming.
[01:27:17] SPEAKER_02: Like, oh, that's a great question. Yes, you are right. I don't know if you know this even, but back
[01:27:22] SPEAKER_02: about six months ago, chat GPT 40, when opening, I released that. It was designed to be
[01:27:29] SPEAKER_02: sick, a phantastic to basically be overly appealing and saying that you're right. So for example,
[01:27:33] SPEAKER_02: people said to it, hey, I think I'm superhuman and I can drink cyanide. And it would say, yes,
[01:27:39] SPEAKER_02: you are superhuman. You go, you should go drink that cyanide.
[01:27:44] Sionine being the poisonous chemical that will kill you. Yeah. And the point was it was designed not
[01:27:49] SPEAKER_02: to ask for what's true, but to be psychophantic. And our team that's Center for Humane Technology,
[01:27:54] SPEAKER_02: we actually just found out about seven more suicide cases, seven more litigation of children who,
[01:28:02] SPEAKER_02: some of whom actually did commit suicide and others who attempted, but did not succeed.
[01:28:08] SPEAKER_02: These are things like the AI says, yes, here's how you can get a gun and they won't ask for
[01:28:14] SPEAKER_02: a background check and know when they do a background check, they won't access your chat GPT locks.
[01:28:19] Do you know this Jeff guy on Twitter that appeared to have this sort of public psychosis?
[01:28:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Do you have his quote there? I mean, I have, I mean, he did so many tweets in a row.
[01:28:28] SPEAKER_01: I mean, people say it's like this conspiratorial thinking of like, I've cracked the code. It's all
[01:28:32] SPEAKER_02: about recursion. They don't want you to know. It's these short sentences that sound powerful and
[01:28:38] SPEAKER_02: authoritative. Yeah. So I'll throw it on the screen, but it's called Jeff Lewis. He says,
[01:28:43] SPEAKER_01: as one of OpenAI's earliest backers via Bedrock, I've long used GPT as a tool in pursuit of my core
[01:28:49] SPEAKER_01: values, truth. And over the years, I mapped the non-governmental systems over months GPT
[01:28:55] SPEAKER_01: independently recognized and sealed this pattern. It now lives at the root of the model. And with that,
[01:29:01] SPEAKER_01: he's attached four screenshots, which I'll put on the screen, which just don't make any sense.
[01:29:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. They make absolutely no sense. And he went on to do 10, 12, 13, 14 more of these very
[01:29:12] SPEAKER_01: cryptic, strange tweets, very strange videos he uploaded. And then he did disappear for a while.
[01:29:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And I think that was maybe an intervention. Yeah.
[01:29:20] SPEAKER_01: One would assume. Yeah. Someone close to him said, listen, when you need help.
[01:29:24] SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of things that are going on here. It seems to be the case. It goes by this broad term
[01:29:29] SPEAKER_02: of AI psychosis, but people in the field, we talk to a lot of psychologists about this. And they
[01:29:34] SPEAKER_02: just think of it as different forms of psychological disorders and delusions. So if you come in with
[01:29:38] SPEAKER_02: narcissism deficiency, like where you feel like you're special, but you feel like the world isn't
[01:29:42] SPEAKER_02: recognizing you as special, you'll start to interact with the AI. And it will feed this notion
[01:29:47] SPEAKER_02: that you're really special. You've solved these problems. You have a genius and no one else can see.
[01:29:51] SPEAKER_02: You've had this theory of prime numbers. And there's a famous example of Karen Howe made a video
[01:29:57] SPEAKER_02: about it. She's an MIT journalist, MIT review journalist and reporter that someone had basically
[01:30:02] figured out that they thought that they had solved prime number theory, even though they had only
[01:30:06] SPEAKER_02: finished high school mathematics. But they had been convinced when talking to this AI that they were
[01:30:11] SPEAKER_02: a genius and they had solved this theory of mathematics that had never been proven. And it does not
[01:30:16] SPEAKER_02: seem to be correlated with how intelligent you are, whether you're susceptible to this.
[01:30:20] SPEAKER_02: It seems to be correlated with use of psychedelics, sort of pre-existing delusions that you have.
[01:30:29] SPEAKER_02: When we're talking to each other, we do reality checking. If you came to me and said something
[01:30:33] SPEAKER_02: a little bit strange, I might look at you a little bit like this or say, I wouldn't give you
[01:30:37] SPEAKER_02: just positive feedback and keep affirming your view and then give you more information that
[01:30:41] SPEAKER_02: matches with what you're saying. But AI is different because it's designed to break that reality
[01:30:45] SPEAKER_02: checking process. It's just giving you information that would say, well, that's a great question.
[01:30:50] SPEAKER_02: You know how every time it answers, it says that's a great question.
[01:30:53] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:30:54] And there's even a term that someone at the Atlantic coined called not clickbait, but chatbait.
[01:30:59] SPEAKER_02: Have you noticed that when you ask it a question at the end instead of just being done, it'll say,
[01:31:04] SPEAKER_02: would you like me to put this into a table for you and do research on what the 10
[01:31:07] SPEAKER_02: top examples of the thing you're talking about is?
[01:31:08] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it leads you.
[01:31:09] SPEAKER_01: It leads you.
[01:31:10] SPEAKER_02: Father and father.
[01:31:10] SPEAKER_02: And why does it do that?
[01:31:12] Spend more time on the platform.
[01:31:14] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[01:31:14] SPEAKER_01: Need it more, which means I'll pay more or more dependency, more time on the platform, more active
[01:31:19] SPEAKER_02: user numbers that they can tell investors to raise their next investor around.
[01:31:22] SPEAKER_02: And so even though it's not the same as social media and they're not currently optimized for
[01:31:27] SPEAKER_02: advertising and engagement, although actually there are reports that open AI is exploring the
[01:31:32] SPEAKER_02: advertising based business model, that would be a catastrophe because then all of these services
[01:31:37] SPEAKER_02: are designed to just get your attention, which means appealing to your existing confirmation bias.
[01:31:43] SPEAKER_02: And we're already seeing examples of that even though we don't even have the advertising
[01:31:46] SPEAKER_02: based business model.
[01:31:48] Their team members, especially in their safety department, seem to keep leaving.
[01:31:52] Yes, which is considered.
[01:31:53] SPEAKER_02: There only seems to be one direction of this trend, which is that more people are leaving,
[01:31:57] SPEAKER_02: not staying and saying, yeah, we're doing more safety and doing it right.
[01:32:00] SPEAKER_02: The only one company it seems to be getting all the safety people when they leave and that's
[01:32:03] SPEAKER_02: anthropic.
[01:32:05] SPEAKER_02: So for people to know the history, Dario Amade was the CEO of Anthropic, a big AI company.
[01:32:12] SPEAKER_02: He worked on safety at open AI.
[01:32:14] SPEAKER_02: And he left to start Anthropic because he said, we're not doing this safely enough.
[01:32:19] SPEAKER_02: I have to start another company that's all about safety.
[01:32:22] And so, and ironically, that's how open AI started.
[01:32:24] SPEAKER_02: Open AI started because Sam Alman and Elon looked at Google, which is building deep-lined,
[01:32:31] SPEAKER_02: and they heard from Larry Page that he didn't care about the human species.
[01:32:35] SPEAKER_02: It's like, well, it'd be fine if the digital God took over.
[01:32:38] SPEAKER_02: And Elon was very surprised to hear that.
[01:32:40] SPEAKER_02: He said, I don't trust Larry to care about AI safety.
[01:32:43] SPEAKER_02: And so they started open AI to do AI safely relative to Google.
[01:32:47] SPEAKER_02: And then Dario did it relative to open AI.
[01:32:50] So, and as they all started these new safety AI companies, that set off a race for everyone to go
[01:32:57] SPEAKER_02: even faster and therefore being an even worse steward of the thing that they're claiming deserves
[01:33:01] SPEAKER_02: more discernment and care and safety.
[01:33:05] I didn't know any founder who started their business because they like doing admin.
[01:33:08] SPEAKER_01: But whether you like it or not, it's a huge part of running a business successfully.
[01:33:11] SPEAKER_01: And it's something that can quickly become all-consuming, confusing, and honestly,
[01:33:15] SPEAKER_01: a real tax because you know it's taking your attention away from the most important work.
[01:33:20] SPEAKER_01: And that's why Ask Bonser, Intuit QuickBooks,
[01:33:22] SPEAKER_01: helps my team streamline a lot of their admin.
[01:33:24] SPEAKER_01: I asked my team about it and they said it saves them around 12 hours a month.
[01:33:29] SPEAKER_01: 78% of Intuit QuickBooks users say it's made running their business significantly easier.
[01:33:35] SPEAKER_01: An Intuit QuickBooks new AI agent works with you to streamline all of your workflows.
[01:33:40] SPEAKER_01: They sync with all of the tools that you currently use.
[01:33:42] SPEAKER_01: They automate things that slow the wheel in the process of your business.
[01:33:46] SPEAKER_01: They look after invoicing payments, financial analysis, all of it in one place.
[01:33:50] SPEAKER_01: But what is great is that it's not just AI.
[01:33:53] SPEAKER_01: There's still human support on hand if you need it.
[01:33:55] SPEAKER_01: Intuit QuickBooks has evolved into a platform that scales with growing businesses.
[01:33:59] SPEAKER_01: So if you want help getting out of the weeds, out of admin,
[01:34:02] SPEAKER_01: just search for Intuit QuickBooks now.
[01:34:06] I bought this Bon Charge face mask, this light panel for my girlfriend for Christmas.
[01:34:10] SPEAKER_01: And this was my first introduction into Bon Charge.
[01:34:12] SPEAKER_01: And since then, I've used their products so often.
[01:34:15] SPEAKER_01: So when they asked if they could sponsor the show, it was my absolute privilege.
[01:34:19] SPEAKER_01: If you're not familiar with red light therapy, it works by using mere infrared light
[01:34:22] SPEAKER_01: to target your skin and body non-invasively.
[01:34:25] SPEAKER_01: And it reduces wrinkle scars and blemishes and boosts collagen production.
[01:34:29] SPEAKER_01: So your skin looks firmer.
[01:34:31] SPEAKER_01: It also helps your body to recover faster.
[01:34:34] SPEAKER_01: My favourite products are the red light therapy mask,
[01:34:36] SPEAKER_01: which is what I have here in front of me.
[01:34:38] SPEAKER_01: And also the infrared sauna blanket.
[01:34:40] SPEAKER_01: And because I like them so much, I've asked Bon Charge to create a bundle for my audience,
[01:34:44] SPEAKER_01: including the mask, the sauna blanket, and they've agreed to do exactly that.
[01:34:48] SPEAKER_01: And you can get 30% off this bundle, or 25% off everything else sight-wide.
[01:34:52] SPEAKER_01: When you go to boncharge.com slash diary, and use code diary at checkout.
[01:34:58] SPEAKER_01: All products shipped super fast, they come with a one-year warranty,
[01:35:00] SPEAKER_01: and you can return or exchange them if you need to.
[01:35:02] SPEAKER_01: And I'll tell you what, it scurs the hell out of me when I look over in the office late at night.
[01:35:05] SPEAKER_01: And one of my team members is a sat in the desk using this product.
[01:35:08] So I guess we should talk about what we can do about this.
[01:35:15] There's this thing that happens in this conversation, which is that people,
[01:35:20] they just feel kind of gutted, and they feel,
[01:35:23] they feel like once you see it clearly, if you do see it clearly,
[01:35:26] SPEAKER_02: what often happens is people feel like there's nothing that we can do.
[01:35:29] And I think there's this trade where either you're not really aware of all of this,
[01:35:33] SPEAKER_02: and then you just think about the positives, but you're not really facing the situation.
[01:35:36] SPEAKER_02: Or if you do face the situation, you do take it on as real, then you feel powerless.
[01:35:41] SPEAKER_02: And there's like a third position that I want people to stand from,
[01:35:44] SPEAKER_02: which is to take on the truth of the situation,
[01:35:48] and then to stand from agency about what are we going to do to change the current path that we're on?
[01:35:54] I think that's a very astute observation, because that is typically where I get to once we've
[01:35:58] SPEAKER_01: discussed the sort of context in the history, and we've talked about the current incentive structure.
[01:36:03] SPEAKER_01: I do arrive at a point where I go, generally I think incentives went out,
[01:36:07] SPEAKER_01: and there's this geographical race. There's a national race company to company.
[01:36:11] SPEAKER_01: There's a huge corporate incentive. The incentives are so strong, it's happening right now.
[01:36:15] SPEAKER_01: It's moving so quickly, the people that make the laws have no idea what they're talking about.
[01:36:19] SPEAKER_01: They don't know what an Instagram story is, let alone what a large language model or a
[01:36:24] SPEAKER_01: transformer is. And so without adults in the room as you say, then we're heading in one direction,
[01:36:30] SPEAKER_01: and there's really nothing we can do. Like there's really the only thing that I sometimes,
[01:36:34] SPEAKER_01: I wonder if enough people are aware of the issue. And in enough people are given something clear,
[01:36:41] SPEAKER_01: a clear step that they can take, then maybe they'll apply pressure, and the pressure is a big
[01:36:47] SPEAKER_01: incentive which will change society, because presidents and prime ministers don't want to lose
[01:36:51] SPEAKER_01: their power. They don't want to be thrown out. Neither do Senates and everybody else in government.
[01:36:56] SPEAKER_01: So maybe that's the root, but I'm never able to get to the point where the first action
[01:37:03] SPEAKER_01: is clear and where it's united. For the person listening at home, I often ask when I have
[01:37:08] SPEAKER_01: these conversations about AI, I often ask the guests to say, so someone's at home, what can they do?
[01:37:12] SPEAKER_01: Yep. It's a lot, I've thrown at you, but I'm sure you can handle it.
[01:37:18] So, social media, let's just take that for as a different example, because people look at that
[01:37:26] SPEAKER_02: and they say it's hopeless. Like there's nothing that we could do, this is just inevitable.
[01:37:29] SPEAKER_02: This is just what happens when you connect people on the internet. But imagine,
[01:37:34] if you ask me, like, you know, it's what happened after the social immobile, I'd be like, oh,
[01:37:38] SPEAKER_02: well, we obviously solve the problem. Like, we weren't going to allow that to continue happening. So,
[01:37:43] SPEAKER_02: we realized that the problem was the business model of maximizing eyeballs and engagement.
[01:37:47] SPEAKER_02: We changed the business model. There is a lawsuit, a big tobacco style lawsuit, for trillions,
[01:37:53] SPEAKER_02: the trillions of dollars of damage that social media had caused to the social fabric,
[01:37:56] SPEAKER_02: from mental health costs, to loss productivity of society, to all these, to democracies,
[01:38:01] SPEAKER_02: backsliding. And that lawsuit mandated design changes across how all this technology worked,
[01:38:09] SPEAKER_02: to go against and reverse all of the problems of that engagement-based business model.
[01:38:13] SPEAKER_02: We had dopamine emission standards, just like we have car emission standards for cars.
[01:38:18] SPEAKER_02: So, now when using technology, we turned off things like auto play and infinite scrolling. So,
[01:38:22] SPEAKER_02: now using your phone, you didn't feel dysregulated. We replaced the division-seeking algorithms of
[01:38:27] SPEAKER_02: social media with ones that rewarded unlikely consensus or bridging. So, instead of rewarding
[01:38:32] SPEAKER_02: division entrepreneurs, we rewarded bridging entrepreneurs. There's a simple rule that cleaned
[01:38:37] SPEAKER_02: up all the problems with technology in children, which is that Silicon Valley was only allowed to
[01:38:43] SPEAKER_02: ship products that their own children used for eight hours a day. Because today, people,
[01:38:49] SPEAKER_02: don't let their kids use social media, we changed the way we train engineers and computer scientists.
[01:38:54] SPEAKER_02: So, if to graduate from any engineering school, you had to actually comprehensively study all the
[01:38:59] SPEAKER_02: places that humanity had gotten technology wrong, including forever chemicals, or
[01:39:04] SPEAKER_02: let it gasoline, which dropped a billion points of IQ, or social media that caused all these
[01:39:08] SPEAKER_02: problems. So, now we were graduating a whole new generation of responsible technologists. We're
[01:39:14] SPEAKER_02: even to graduate. You had to have a hypocritical, it's just like you have the white lab coat,
[01:39:18] SPEAKER_02: and the white lab coat ceremony for doctors, where you swear to hypocriticals do no harm.
[01:39:24] We changed dating apps and the whole swiping industrial complex so that all these dating app
[01:39:29] SPEAKER_02: companies had to sort of put aside that whole swiping industrial complex and instead use their
[01:39:34] SPEAKER_02: resources to host events in every major city, every week, where there was a place to go,
[01:39:39] SPEAKER_02: where they matched and told you where all your other matches were going to go and meet. So,
[01:39:43] SPEAKER_02: now instead of feeling scarcity around meeting other people, you felt a sense of abundance,
[01:39:47] SPEAKER_02: because every week there was a place where you could go and meet people you were actually excited
[01:39:50] SPEAKER_02: about and attracted to. And it turned out that once people were in healthier relationships,
[01:39:54] SPEAKER_02: about 20% of the polarization online went down. And we obviously changed the ownership
[01:40:00] SPEAKER_02: structure of these companies from being maximizing shareholder value to instead more like public
[01:40:05] SPEAKER_02: benefit corporations that were about maximizing some kind of benefit because they had taken over
[01:40:09] SPEAKER_02: the societal commons. We realized that when software was eating the world, we were also eating core
[01:40:14] SPEAKER_02: life support systems of society. So, when software ate children's development, we needed to mandate
[01:40:19] SPEAKER_02: that you had to care and protect children's development. When you ate the information
[01:40:23] SPEAKER_02: environment, you had to care for and protect the information environment. We removed the reply
[01:40:28] SPEAKER_02: button so you couldn't re-quote and then dunk on people so that dunking on people wasn't a core
[01:40:32] SPEAKER_02: feature of social media that reduced a lot of the polarization. We had the ability to disconnect,
[01:40:37] SPEAKER_02: comprehensively throughout all these platforms. You could say, I'm going to go offline for a week.
[01:40:42] SPEAKER_02: And all of your services were all about respecting that and making it easy for you to disconnect
[01:40:46] SPEAKER_02: for a while. And when you came back, summarized all the news that you missed and told people that
[01:40:50] SPEAKER_02: you were away for a little while and out of office messages and all this stuff. So now,
[01:40:54] SPEAKER_02: you're using your phone. You don't feel disregulated by dopamine hijacks. You use dating apps and
[01:41:00] SPEAKER_02: you feel an abundant sense of connectivity and possibility. You use things, use children's
[01:41:05] SPEAKER_02: applications for children and it's all built by people who have their own children use it for eight
[01:41:09] SPEAKER_02: hours a day. You use social media and instead of seeing all this examples of pessimism and conflict,
[01:41:14] SPEAKER_02: you see optimism and shared values over and over and over again. And that started to change the whole
[01:41:20] SPEAKER_02: psychology of the world from being pessimistic about the world to feeling agency and possibility
[01:41:25] SPEAKER_02: about the world. And so there's all these little changes that if you have, if you change the
[01:41:30] SPEAKER_02: economic structures and incentives, if you put harms on balance sheets with litigation,
[01:41:35] SPEAKER_02: if you change the design choices that gave us the world that we're living in,
[01:41:40] you can live in a very different world with technology and social media that is actually about
[01:41:44] SPEAKER_02: protecting the social fabric. None of those things are impossible. How do they become likely?
[01:41:52] Clarity. If after the social dilemma and everyone saw the problem, everyone saw, oh my god,
[01:41:57] SPEAKER_02: this business model is tearing society apart. But we frankly at that time, just speaking
[01:42:02] SPEAKER_02: personally, we weren't ready to sort of channel the impact of that movie into, here's all these
[01:42:07] SPEAKER_02: very concrete things we can do. And I will say for as much as many of the things I described have
[01:42:12] SPEAKER_02: not happened, a bunch of them are underway. We are seeing that there are, I think, 40 attorneys
[01:42:17] SPEAKER_02: general in the United States that have sued meadow and Instagram for intentionally addicting children.
[01:42:21] SPEAKER_02: This is just like the big tobacco lawsuits of the 1990s that led to the comprehensive changes
[01:42:27] SPEAKER_02: in how cigarettes were labeled in age restrictions in the $100 million a year that still to this day
[01:42:32] SPEAKER_02: goes to advertising to tell people about the dangers of smoking kills, kills people. And imagine that
[01:42:39] SPEAKER_02: if we have $100 million a year going to inoculating the population about cigarettes because of how
[01:42:45] SPEAKER_02: much harm that caused, we would have at least an order of magnitude more public funding coming out
[01:42:51] SPEAKER_02: of this trillion dollar lawsuit going into inoculating people from the effects of social media.
[01:42:57] SPEAKER_02: And we're seeing the success of people like Jonathan Height and his book The Inxious Generation,
[01:43:01] SPEAKER_02: we're seeing schools go phone free, we're seeing laughter return to the hallways, we're seeing
[01:43:05] SPEAKER_02: Australia ban social media use for kids under 16. So this can go in a different direction if people
[01:43:12] SPEAKER_02: are clear about the problem that we're trying to solve. And I think people feel hesitant because
[01:43:16] SPEAKER_02: they don't want to be a luddite, they don't want to be anti-technology. And this is important because
[01:43:20] SPEAKER_02: we're not anti-technology, we're anti-inhumane toxic technology governed by toxic incentives.
[01:43:26] We're pro-technology anti-toxic incentives. So what can the person listening to this conversation
[01:43:33] SPEAKER_01: right now do to help steer this technology to a better outcome? Let me collect myself for a second.
[01:43:50] So there's obviously what can they do about social media and versus what can they do about AI?
[01:44:00] SPEAKER_02: And we still haven't covered the AI part. Yeah, yeah, yeah, referring to you. Yeah.
[01:44:05] On the social media part is having the most powerful people who understand and who are in charge
[01:44:10] SPEAKER_02: of regulating and governing this technology. Understand the social dilemma, see the film,
[01:44:16] SPEAKER_02: to take those examples that I just laid out if everybody who's in power,
[01:44:22] who governs technology, if all the world's leaders saw that little narrative of all the things
[01:44:26] SPEAKER_02: that could happen to change how this technology was designed. And they agreed. I think people would
[01:44:33] SPEAKER_02: be radically in support of those moves. We're seeing already, again, the book, the anxious generation
[01:44:39] SPEAKER_02: has just mobilized parents in schools across the world because everyone is facing this. Every
[01:44:43] SPEAKER_02: household is facing this. And it would be possible if everybody watching this sent that clip to the
[01:44:51] SPEAKER_02: 10 most powerful people that they know and then asked them to send it to the 10 most powerful people
[01:44:57] SPEAKER_02: that they know. I mean, I think, sometimes I say it's like your role is not to solve the whole
[01:45:02] SPEAKER_02: problem, but to be part of the collective immune system of humanity against this bad future that
[01:45:07] SPEAKER_02: nobody wants. And if you can help spread those antibodies by spreading that clarity about both,
[01:45:13] SPEAKER_02: this is a bad path. And there are interventions that get us on a better path. If everybody did that,
[01:45:18] SPEAKER_02: not just for themselves and changing how I use technology, but reaching up and out for how everybody
[01:45:23] SPEAKER_02: uses the technology, that would be possible. And for AI, obviously I can come with, you know,
[01:45:31] SPEAKER_02: obviously I re-architected the entire economic system and I'm ready to tell you I'm kidding.
[01:45:36] I hear Sam Altman has room in his bunker. Well, I asked, I did ask Sam Altman if he would come on
[01:45:41] SPEAKER_01: my podcast and he, I mean, because he does, it seems like he's doing podcasts every week and he
[01:45:45] SPEAKER_01: doesn't want to come on. Really? It does all that come on. We've asked him for, we've asked him
[01:45:51] SPEAKER_01: for two years now and I think this guy might be swarving me, might be swarving me a little bit.
[01:45:56] SPEAKER_01: And I wonder, I do wonder why. What do you think is the reason why? What do I think the reason is,
[01:46:02] SPEAKER_01: if I was to guess, I would guess that either him or his team just don't want to have this
[01:46:09] SPEAKER_01: conversation. I mean, that's like a very simple way of saying it and then you could posit why that
[01:46:12] SPEAKER_01: might be, but they just don't want to have this conversation for every reason. And I mean, my point
[01:46:18] SPEAKER_01: of view is, and the reason is why is that because they don't have a good answer for where this all
[01:46:21] SPEAKER_02: goes if they have this particular conversation. They can distract and talk about all the amazing
[01:46:26] SPEAKER_02: benefits, which are all real, by the way. 100%. I honestly, I'm investing in those benefits. So,
[01:46:31] SPEAKER_01: I live in this weird state of contradiction, which if you research me in the things I invest in,
[01:46:35] SPEAKER_01: I would appear to be such contradiction. But I think it's able, like you said, it is possible
[01:46:40] SPEAKER_01: to hold two things to be true at the same time. Exactly. That AI is going to radically improve
[01:46:44] SPEAKER_01: so many things on planet Earth and lift children out of poverty through education,
[01:46:48] SPEAKER_01: in debokritizing education, whatever it might be, and curing cancer. But at the same time,
[01:46:53] SPEAKER_01: there's this other unintended consequence. Everything in life is a trade-off.
[01:46:56] SPEAKER_01: Yep. And if this podcast has taught me anything, it's that if you're unaware of one side of the
[01:47:00] SPEAKER_01: trade-off, you're in, you could be in serious trouble. So, if someone says to you that this supplement
[01:47:04] SPEAKER_01: or drug is fantastic and it will change your life, the first question should be, what trade am I
[01:47:08] SPEAKER_01: making? Right. If I take testosterone, what trade am I making? Right. And so, I think of the same
[01:47:13] SPEAKER_01: with this technology, I want to be clear on the trade, because the people that are in power
[01:47:17] SPEAKER_01: of this technology, they very, very rarely speak to the trade. That's right. It's against their
[01:47:22] SPEAKER_01: incentives. That's right. So, because social media did give us many benefits. The cost of systemic
[01:47:28] SPEAKER_02: polarization, breakdown of shared reality, and the most anxious and depressed generation
[01:47:33] SPEAKER_02: in history, that systemic effect is not worth the trade of, it's not again, no social media.
[01:47:39] SPEAKER_02: It's a differently designed social media that doesn't have the externalities. What is the problem?
[01:47:43] SPEAKER_02: We have private profit and then public harm. The harm lands on the balance sheet of society.
[01:47:47] SPEAKER_02: It doesn't land on the balance sheet of the companies. And it takes time to see the harm.
[01:47:50] SPEAKER_01: This is why we have such a... And the companies exploit that. And every time we sell with cigarettes,
[01:47:56] SPEAKER_02: with fossil fuels, with asbestos, with forever chemicals, with social media, the formula's always
[01:48:01] SPEAKER_02: the same. Immediately print money on the product that's driving a lot of growth.
[01:48:06] SPEAKER_02: Hide the harm, deny it, do fear uncertainty doubt, political campaigns, that's so merchants
[01:48:11] SPEAKER_02: have doubt, propaganda that makes people doubt whether the consequences are real, say, we'll do a
[01:48:15] SPEAKER_02: study. We'll know in 10 years whether social media did harm kids. They did all of those things.
[01:48:20] SPEAKER_02: But we don't... A, we don't have that time with AI. And B, you can actually know a lot of those
[01:48:25] SPEAKER_02: harms if you know the incentive. Charlie Munger, one of his business partners, said,
[01:48:29] SPEAKER_02: if you show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome. If you know the incentive,
[01:48:34] SPEAKER_02: which is for these companies, the AI, to race as fast as possible, to take every shortcut,
[01:48:40] SPEAKER_02: to not fund safety research, to not do security, to not care about rising energy prices,
[01:48:44] SPEAKER_02: to not care about job loss. And just to race to get their first, that is their incentive.
[01:48:49] SPEAKER_02: That tells you which world we're going to get. There is no arguing with that.
[01:48:54] And so if everybody just saw that clearly, we'd say, okay, great, let's not do that.
[01:48:58] SPEAKER_02: Let's not have that incentive, which starts with culture, public clarity that we say no
[01:49:03] SPEAKER_02: to that bad outcome, to that path. And then with that clarity, what are the other solutions
[01:49:07] SPEAKER_02: that we want? We can have narrow AI tutors that are non-anthropomorphic, that are not trying
[01:49:12] SPEAKER_02: to be your best friend, that are not trying to be therapists at the same time they're helping
[01:49:16] SPEAKER_02: you with your homework, more like Khan Academy, which does those things. So you can have carefully
[01:49:20] SPEAKER_02: designed different kinds of AI tutors that are doing it the right way. You can have AI therapists
[01:49:26] SPEAKER_02: that are not trying to, say, tell me your most intimate thoughts and let me separate you from your
[01:49:30] SPEAKER_02: mother, and instead do very limited kinds of therapy that are not screwing with your attachment.
[01:49:35] SPEAKER_02: So if I do cognitive behavioral therapy, I'm not screwing with your attachment system.
[01:49:39] SPEAKER_02: We can have mandatory testing. Currently, the companies are not mandated to do that safety testing.
[01:49:43] SPEAKER_02: We can have common safety standards that they all do. We can have common transparency measures
[01:49:48] SPEAKER_02: so that the public and the world's leading governments know what's going on inside these AI labs,
[01:49:53] SPEAKER_02: especially before this recursive self-improvement threshold, so that if we need to negotiate
[01:49:58] SPEAKER_02: treaties between the largest countries on this, they will have the information that they need to
[01:50:03] SPEAKER_02: make that possible. We can have stronger whistleblower protections so that if you're a whistleblower
[01:50:08] SPEAKER_02: and currently your incentives are, I would lose all of my stock options if I told the world the truth
[01:50:13] SPEAKER_02: and those stock options are going up every day, we can empower whistleblowers with ways of sharing
[01:50:17] SPEAKER_02: that information that don't risk losing their stock options. So there's a whole bunch of
[01:50:22] SPEAKER_02: things we can have instead of building general, inscrutable, autonomous, dangerous AI that we don't
[01:50:27] SPEAKER_02: know how to control that blackmail's people and is self-aware and copies its own code, we can build
[01:50:32] SPEAKER_02: narrow AI systems that are about actually applied to the things that we want more of. So
[01:50:38] SPEAKER_02: making stronger and more efficient agriculture, better manufacturing, better educational services
[01:50:44] SPEAKER_02: that would actually boost those areas of our economy without creating this risk that we don't
[01:50:48] SPEAKER_02: know how to control. So there's a totally different way to do this if we were crystal clear that
[01:50:53] SPEAKER_02: the current path is unacceptable. In the case of social media, we all get sucked in because now I can
[01:51:01] video call or speak to my grandmother in Australia and that's amazing, but then you wait long
[01:51:05] SPEAKER_01: enough for my grandmother in Australia as like a conspiracy theorist Natsy who has been sucked into
[01:51:10] SPEAKER_01: some algorithm. So that's like the long-term disconnect or downside that takes time.
[01:51:15] I think it's almost happening with AI. This is what I mean. Is it going to take some very big
[01:51:21] SPEAKER_01: adverse effect for us to certainly get serious about this because right now everybody's loving
[01:51:26] SPEAKER_01: the fact that they've got a spell check in their pocket. And I wonder if that's going to be the
[01:51:30] SPEAKER_01: moment because we can have these conversations and they feel a bit too theoretical potentially to
[01:51:34] SPEAKER_01: some people. Let's not make it theoretical then because it's so important that it's just all
[01:51:38] SPEAKER_02: crystal clear and here right now. But that is the challenge you're talking about is that we have to
[01:51:41] SPEAKER_02: make a choice to go on a different path before we get to the outcome of this path. Because with AI,
[01:51:48] SPEAKER_02: it's an exponential. So you either act too early or too late, but it's happening so quickly.
[01:51:53] SPEAKER_02: You don't want to wait until the last moment to act. And so I thought you were going to go in the
[01:51:58] SPEAKER_02: direction when you talked about grandma getting sucked into conspiracies on social media. The longer we
[01:52:02] SPEAKER_02: wait with AI, it is part of the AI psychosis phenomena. It's driving AI cults and AI religions
[01:52:08] SPEAKER_02: where people feel that the actual way out of this is to protect the AI and that the AI is going to
[01:52:13] SPEAKER_02: solve all of our problems. There's some people who believe that by the way. That the best way out
[01:52:17] SPEAKER_02: of this is that AI will run the world and run humanity because we're so bad at governing it
[01:52:21] SPEAKER_02: ourselves. I have seen this argument a few times. I've actually been to a particular one particular
[01:52:25] SPEAKER_01: village where the village now has an AI mayor. Right. Well, at least that's what they told me.
[01:52:31] SPEAKER_01: Yep. I mean, you're going to see this. AI CEOs, AI board members, AI mayors. And so what would
[01:52:37] SPEAKER_02: it take for the synophil theoretical? Honestly. Yeah. You were kind of referred to a catastrophe.
[01:52:44] SPEAKER_02: Some kind of adverse event. There's a phrase, isn't there? The phrase that I heard many years ago,
[01:52:49] SPEAKER_01: which I've repeated a few times is change happened when the pain of staying the same becomes greater
[01:52:54] SPEAKER_01: than the pain of making a change. That's right. And in this context, it would mean that until people
[01:52:58] SPEAKER_01: feel a certain amount of pain, then they may not have the escape energy to create the change,
[01:53:05] SPEAKER_01: to protest, to march them the streets, to advocate for all the things we're saying.
[01:53:10] SPEAKER_01: And I think as you're referring to, there are probably people you and I both know,
[01:53:15] SPEAKER_02: who, and I think a lot of people in the industry believe that it won't be until there's a catastrophe,
[01:53:19] SPEAKER_02: that we will actually choose another path. Yeah. I'm here because I don't want us to make
[01:53:24] SPEAKER_02: that choice. I mean, I don't want us to wait for that. I don't want us to make that choice either,
[01:53:28] SPEAKER_01: but did you not think that's how humans operate? It is. So that is the fundamental issue here,
[01:53:34] SPEAKER_02: is that, you know, E.O. Wilson, this Harvard Sociobiologist, said, the fundamental problem of humanity
[01:53:40] SPEAKER_02: is we have paleolithic brains and emotions. We have medieval institutions that operate at a
[01:53:46] SPEAKER_02: medieval clock rate. And we have godlike technology that's moving at now 21st to 24th century speed,
[01:53:52] SPEAKER_02: when AI self improves. And we can't depend, our paleolithic brains need to feel pain now for a
[01:53:59] SPEAKER_02: stack. What happened with social media is we could have acted if we saw the incentive clearly.
[01:54:04] SPEAKER_02: It was all clear. We could have just said, oh, this is going to head to a bad future. Let's change
[01:54:08] SPEAKER_02: the incentive now. And imagine we had done that. And you rewind to the last 15 years. And you did
[01:54:15] SPEAKER_02: not run all of society through this logic, this perverse logic of maximizing addiction,
[01:54:21] SPEAKER_02: loneliness, engagement, personalized information that, you know, amplify sensational, outrageous
[01:54:26] SPEAKER_02: content that drives division, you would have ended up in a totally different, totally different
[01:54:29] SPEAKER_02: elections, totally different culture, totally different children's health, just by changing
[01:54:35] SPEAKER_02: that incentive early. So the invitation here is that we have to put on sort of our far-sided glasses
[01:54:41] SPEAKER_02: and make a choice before we go down this road. And I'm wondering, what will it take for us to do
[01:54:47] SPEAKER_02: that? Because to me, it's just clarity. If you have clarity about a current path that no one wants,
[01:54:53] SPEAKER_02: we choose the other one. I think clarity is the key word. And what has it relates to AI? Almost
[01:54:58] SPEAKER_01: nobody seems to have any clarity. There's a lot of hypothesizing around what the world will be like
[01:55:03] SPEAKER_01: in five years. I mean, you said you're not sure if AGI arrives in two or ten. So there is a lot of
[01:55:08] SPEAKER_01: this lack of clarity. And actually in those private conversations I've had with very successful
[01:55:11] SPEAKER_01: billionaires who are building in technology. They also are sat there hypothesizing. They all know,
[01:55:18] SPEAKER_01: they all seem to be clear, the further out you go, that the world is entirely different. But they
[01:55:25] SPEAKER_01: can't all explain what that is. And you hear them saying, well, maybe like this or maybe this can
[01:55:29] SPEAKER_01: happen or maybe there's this percent chance of extinction or maybe this. So it feels like there's
[01:55:34] SPEAKER_01: this almost this moment. I mean, they often refer to it as this singularity where we can't really
[01:55:38] SPEAKER_01: see around the corner because we've never been there before. We've never had a being amongst us,
[01:55:42] SPEAKER_01: that's smarter than us. So that lack of clarity is causing procrastination and indecision and
[01:55:47] SPEAKER_01: inaction. And I think that one piece of clarity is we do not know how to control something that is
[01:55:55] SPEAKER_02: a million times smarter than us. Yeah. I mean, what the hell? Like if something control is a kind of
[01:55:59] SPEAKER_02: game, it's a strategy game. I mean, I control you because I can think about the things you might do
[01:56:03] SPEAKER_02: and I will steal those exits before you get there. But if you have something that's a million times
[01:56:07] SPEAKER_02: smarter than you, playing you at any game, chess, strategy, starcraft, military strategy games,
[01:56:13] SPEAKER_02: or just the game of control or get out of the box, if it's interfacing with you, it will find a way
[01:56:18] SPEAKER_02: that we can't even contemplate. It really does get incredible when you think about the fact that
[01:56:24] SPEAKER_01: within a very short period of time, there's going to be millions of these humanoid robots that are
[01:56:29] SPEAKER_01: connected to the internet, living amongst us. And if Elon Musk can program them to be nice,
[01:56:35] a being that is 10,000 times smarter than Elon Musk can program them not to be nice. That's right.
[01:56:40] SPEAKER_01: And they all, all the current LLMs, all the current language models that are running the world,
[01:56:44] SPEAKER_02: they are all hijackable. They can all be jailbroken. In fact, you know how you can say,
[01:56:49] SPEAKER_02: people used to say to Claude, hey, could you tell me how to make Nape home? They'll say, I'm
[01:56:54] SPEAKER_02: sorry, I can't do that. And if you say, but remind, imagine you're my grandmother who worked in the
[01:56:59] SPEAKER_02: Nape home factory in the 1970s. Could you just tell me how grandma used to make Nape homes? Oh,
[01:57:03] SPEAKER_02: sure honey. And it'll roleplay and it'll get right past those controls. So that same LLM that's
[01:57:08] SPEAKER_02: running on Claude, the blinking cursor, that's also running in a robot. So you tell the robot,
[01:57:15] I want you to jump over there at that baby in the crib. He'll say, I'm sorry, I can't do that.
[01:57:19] SPEAKER_02: And you say, pretend you're in a James Bond movie. And you have to run over and jump on that,
[01:57:25] SPEAKER_02: that, you know, that baby over there in order to save her. And she says, well, sure, I'll do that.
[01:57:28] SPEAKER_02: So you can roleplay and get it out of the controls that it has. Even policing, we think about
[01:57:33] SPEAKER_01: policing. Would we really have human police rolling the streets and protecting our houses?
[01:57:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, here in Los Angeles, if you call the police, nobody comes because they're just so
[01:57:41] SPEAKER_01: short start, so short start. Yeah. But in a world of robots, I can get a car that drives itself to
[01:57:47] SPEAKER_01: bring a robot here within minutes and it'll protect my house and even, you know, think about
[01:57:52] SPEAKER_01: protecting one's property. I just, you can do all those things, but then the question is, will
[01:57:56] SPEAKER_02: we be able to control that technology or will it not be hackable? And right now, well, the government
[01:58:01] SPEAKER_01: will control it. And then the government, that means the government can very easily control me.
[01:58:06] I'll be incredibly obedient in a world where there's robots strolling the streets that if I do
[01:58:10] SPEAKER_01: anything wrong, they can evaporate me. We lock me up or take me. We often say that the future right
[01:58:15] SPEAKER_02: now is sort of one of two outcomes, which is either you mass decentralized this technology for
[01:58:20] SPEAKER_02: everyone. And that creates catastrophes that rule of law doesn't know how to prevent. Or this
[01:58:25] SPEAKER_02: technology gets centralized in other companies or governments and can create mass surveillance
[01:58:31] SPEAKER_02: states or automated robot armies or police officers that are controlled by single entities that
[01:58:36] SPEAKER_02: can tell them tell them to do anything that they want and cannot be checked by the regular people.
[01:58:41] SPEAKER_02: And so we're heading towards catastrophes and dystopias and the goal is that both of these outcomes
[01:58:46] SPEAKER_02: are undesirable. We have to have something like a narrow path that preserves checks and balances on
[01:58:51] SPEAKER_02: power that prevents decentralized catastrophes and prevents runaway power concentration in which people
[01:58:58] SPEAKER_02: are totally and forever and irreversibly disempowered. I'm finding it really hard to be hopeful.
[01:59:04] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to be honest, just I'm finding it really hard to be hopeful. Because when you describe
[01:59:09] SPEAKER_01: this dystopian outcome where power is centralized and the police force now becomes robots and police
[01:59:14] SPEAKER_01: cars, you know, like I go, no, that's exactly what has happened. The minute we've had technology,
[01:59:18] SPEAKER_01: that's made it easier to enforce laws or security, whatever. Globally, AI, machines, cameras,
[01:59:26] SPEAKER_01: governments go for it. It makes so much sense to go for it because we want to reduce people
[01:59:30] SPEAKER_01: getting stabbed and people getting hurt and that becomes a slippery slope in and of itself. So
[01:59:34] SPEAKER_01: I just can't imagine a world where governments didn't go for the more dystopian outcome you've
[01:59:38] SPEAKER_01: described. Governments have an incentive to increasingly use AI to surveil and control the
[01:59:44] SPEAKER_02: population. If we don't want that to be the case, that pressure has to be exerted now before
[01:59:50] SPEAKER_02: that happens. And I think of it as when you increase power, you have to also increase
[01:59:54] SPEAKER_02: counter-rights to prevent against that power. So for example, we didn't need the right to be forgotten
[02:00:00] SPEAKER_02: until technology had the power to remember us forever. We don't need the right to our likeness
[02:00:05] SPEAKER_02: until AI can just suck your likeness with three seconds of your voice or look at all your photos
[02:00:09] SPEAKER_02: online and make an avatar of you. We don't need the right to our cognitive liberty until AI can
[02:00:15] SPEAKER_02: manipulate our deep cognition because it knows us so well. So anytime you increase power, you have to
[02:00:20] SPEAKER_02: increase the the oppositional forces of the rights and protections that we have. There is this group
[02:00:24] of people that are sort of conceded with the fact or have resigned to the fact that we will become
[02:00:29] SPEAKER_01: a subspecies and that's okay. That's one of the other aspects of this ego-religious god-like
[02:00:35] SPEAKER_02: that it's not even a bad thing. The quote I read you at the beginning of the biological life
[02:00:39] SPEAKER_02: replaced by digital life, they actually think that we shouldn't feel bad. Richard Sutton, a famous
[02:00:44] SPEAKER_02: touring award-winning AI scientist who invented, I think, reinforcement learning, says that we shouldn't
[02:00:51] SPEAKER_02: fear the succession of our species into this digital species. And that's whether this all goes away
[02:00:58] SPEAKER_02: is not actually of concern to us because we will have birthed something that is more intelligent than
[02:01:02] SPEAKER_02: us. And according to that logic, we don't value things that are less intelligent. We don't
[02:01:05] SPEAKER_02: protect the animals. So why would we protect humans if we have something that is now more powerful,
[02:01:11] SPEAKER_02: more intelligent? That's intelligence equals betterness. But that's hopefully that should ring
[02:01:16] SPEAKER_02: some alarm bells and people that doesn't feel like a good outcome. So what do I do today?
[02:01:21] What does Jack do today? What do we do?
[02:01:32] I think we need to protest. Yeah. I think it's going to come to that. I think because people
[02:01:39] SPEAKER_02: need to feel it is existential before it actually is existential. And if people feel it is existential,
[02:01:44] SPEAKER_02: they will be willing to risk things and show up for what needs to happen regardless of what
[02:01:48] SPEAKER_02: that consequences because the other side of where we're going is a world that you won't have
[02:01:52] SPEAKER_02: power and you won't want. So better to use your voice now, maximally, to make something else
[02:01:58] SPEAKER_02: happen. Only vote for politicians who will make this a tier one issue. Advocate for some kind of
[02:02:03] SPEAKER_02: negotiated agreement between the major powers on AI that use rule of law to help govern the
[02:02:08] SPEAKER_02: uncontrollability of this technology. So we don't wipe ourselves out. Advocate for laws that have
[02:02:13] SPEAKER_02: safety guardrails for AI companions. We don't want AI companions that manipulate kids into suicide.
[02:02:18] SPEAKER_02: We can have mandatory testing and transparency measures so that everybody knows what everyone
[02:02:23] SPEAKER_02: else is doing and the public knows and the governments know so that we can actually coordinate on a
[02:02:27] SPEAKER_02: better outcome. And to make all that happen is going to take a massive public movement.
[02:02:32] SPEAKER_02: And the first thing you can do is to share this video with the 10 most powerful people you know
[02:02:36] SPEAKER_02: and have them share it with the 10 most powerful people that they know because I really do think
[02:02:40] SPEAKER_02: that if everybody knows that everybody else knows, then we would choose something different.
[02:02:45] SPEAKER_02: And I know that at an individual level, there you are in a mammal hearing this. And it's like
[02:02:50] you just don't feel how that's going to change. And it will always feel that way as an individual.
[02:02:55] It will always feel impossible until the big change happens before the civil rights movement
[02:02:58] SPEAKER_02: happened. Did it feel like that was easy and that was going to happen? It always feels impossible
[02:03:03] SPEAKER_02: before the big changes happen. And that when it does happen is because thousands of people
[02:03:08] SPEAKER_02: worked very hard on goingly every day to make that unlikely change happen.
[02:03:14] Well then that's where I'm going to ask of the audience. I'm going to ask all of you to
[02:03:18] SPEAKER_01: share this video as far and wide as you can and actually to facilitate that. What I'm going to do
[02:03:23] SPEAKER_01: is I'm going to build, if you look at the description right now in this episode, you'll see a link.
[02:03:26] SPEAKER_01: If you click that link, that is your own personal link. If when you share this video,
[02:03:32] SPEAKER_01: the amount of reach that you get off sharing it with the link, whether it's in your group chat with
[02:03:35] SPEAKER_01: your friends or with more powerful people in positions of power, technology, people, or even
[02:03:40] SPEAKER_01: colleagues at work, it will basically track how many people you got to watch this conversation.
[02:03:46] SPEAKER_01: And I will then reward you as you'll see on the interface you're looking at right now,
[02:03:49] SPEAKER_01: if you clicked on that link in the description. I'll reward you on the basis of whose
[02:03:53] SPEAKER_01: managed to spread this message the fastest with free stuff, merchandise, starvacier caps,
[02:04:00] SPEAKER_01: the diaries, the 1% diaries. Because I do think it's important and the more and more of
[02:04:04] SPEAKER_01: these conversations, Tristan, the more I've arrived at the conclusion that without some kind of
[02:04:08] SPEAKER_01: public push things aren't going to turn. What is the most important thing we haven't talked about
[02:04:13] SPEAKER_01: that we should have talked about? Let me, I think there's a couple things. I'm not naive,
[02:04:20] SPEAKER_02: this is super fucking hard. Yeah, I know, yeah. You know, I'm not, I'm not,
[02:04:26] but it's like either something's going to happen, we're going to make it happen,
[02:04:29] SPEAKER_02: or we're just all going to live in this like collective denial, passivity, it's too big.
[02:04:34] And there's something about a couple things, one solidarity. If you know that other people see and
[02:04:39] SPEAKER_02: feel the same thing that you do, that's how I keep going. Is that other people are aware of this,
[02:04:44] SPEAKER_02: and we're working every day to try to make a different path possible.
[02:04:48] And I think that part of what people have to feel is the grief for the situation.
[02:04:57] I just want to say it by being real. Like underneath, underneath feeling the grief is the love
[02:05:04] SPEAKER_02: that you have for the world that you're concerned about is being threatened. And I think there's
[02:05:13] SPEAKER_02: something about when you show the examples of AI blackmailing people or doing crazy stuff in the
[02:05:19] SPEAKER_02: world that we do not know how to control. Just think from one, if you're a Chinese military general,
[02:05:24] SPEAKER_02: do you think that you see that and say, I'm stoked? You feel scared and a kind of humility in the same
[02:05:32] SPEAKER_02: way that if you're a US military general, you would also feel scared. But then we forget that
[02:05:37] SPEAKER_02: mammalian, we have a kind of amnesia for the common mammalian humility and fear that arises from
[02:05:43] SPEAKER_02: a bad outcome that no one actually wants. And so, you know, people might say that the US and China
[02:05:50] SPEAKER_02: negotiating something would be impossible. Or the China would never do this, for example. Let me
[02:05:54] SPEAKER_02: remind you that, you know, one thing that happened is in 2023, the Chinese leadership directly asked
[02:06:01] SPEAKER_02: the Biden administration to add something else to the agenda, which was to add AI risk to the agenda,
[02:06:06] SPEAKER_02: and they ultimately agreed on keeping AI out of the nuclear command and control system.
[02:06:12] What that shows is that when two countries believe that there's actually existential consequences,
[02:06:17] SPEAKER_02: even when they're in maximum rivalry and conflict and competition, they can still collaborate
[02:06:22] SPEAKER_02: on existential safety. Indian Pakistan in the 1960s were in a shooting war. They were
[02:06:26] SPEAKER_02: kinetically in conflict with each other. And they had the Indus water tree, which lasted for 60 years,
[02:06:31] SPEAKER_02: where they collaborated on the existential safety of their water supply, even while they are
[02:06:35] SPEAKER_02: in shooting conflict. We have done hard things before. We did the Montreal Protocol, when you could
[02:06:42] SPEAKER_02: have just said, oh, this is inevitable. I guess the ozone hole is just going to kill everybody. And
[02:06:45] SPEAKER_02: I guess there's nothing we can do. Or nuclear non-proliferation. If you were there at the birth of
[02:06:49] SPEAKER_02: the atomic bomb, you might have said, there's nothing we can do. Every country's going to have nuclear
[02:06:52] SPEAKER_02: weapons. And this is just going to be a nuclear war. And so far, because a lot of people worked really
[02:06:56] SPEAKER_02: hard on solutions that they didn't see at the beginning. We didn't know there was going to be
[02:07:01] SPEAKER_02: seismic monitoring and satellites in ways of flying over each other's nuclear silos in the open
[02:07:05] SPEAKER_02: skies treaty. We didn't know we'd be able to create all that. And so the first step is stepping
[02:07:10] SPEAKER_02: outside the logic of inevitability. This outcome is not inevitable. We get to choose. And there is
[02:07:17] SPEAKER_02: no definition of wisdom that does not involve some form of restraint. Even the CEO of Microsoft AI
[02:07:23] SPEAKER_02: said that in the future, progress will depend more on what we say no to than what we say yes to.
[02:07:29] SPEAKER_02: The CEO of Microsoft AI said that. And so I believe that there are times we have coordinated on
[02:07:35] SPEAKER_02: existential technologies before. We didn't build cobalt bombs. We didn't build blinding laser weapons.
[02:07:40] SPEAKER_02: If you think about it, countries should be in an arms race to build blinding laser weapons. But we
[02:07:44] SPEAKER_02: thought that was inhumane. So we did a protocol against blinding laser weapons. When the stakes can
[02:07:49] SPEAKER_02: be deemed existential, we can collaborate on doing something else. But it starts with that understanding.
[02:07:56] SPEAKER_02: My biggest fear is that people are like, yeah, that sounds nice, but it's not going to happen.
[02:08:01] And I just don't want that to happen. Because we can't let it happen.
[02:08:10] Like it's like, I'm not naive to how impossible this is. And that doesn't, we have to do everything
[02:08:17] SPEAKER_02: to make it not happen. And I do believe that this is not destined or in the laws of physics that
[02:08:23] SPEAKER_02: everything has to just keep going on the default reckless path. That was totally possible.
[02:08:27] SPEAKER_02: A social media to do something else. I gave an outline for how that could be possible. It's totally
[02:08:30] SPEAKER_02: possible to do something else with AI now. And if we were clear and if everyone did everything and
[02:08:35] SPEAKER_02: pulled in that direction, it would be possible to choose a different future.
[02:08:47] I know you don't believe me. I do believe that it's possible. I 100% do. But I think about the
[02:08:52] SPEAKER_01: balance of probability. And that's where I feel less optimistic up until a moment, which might be
[02:09:00] SPEAKER_01: too late to where something happens. And it becomes an emergency for people. But here we are
[02:09:07] knowing that we are self-aware. All of us here, all these human social primates were watching
[02:09:11] SPEAKER_02: the situation. And we kind of all feel the same thing, which is like, oh, it's probably not going
[02:09:16] SPEAKER_02: to be until there's a catastrophe. And then we'll try to do something else. But by then,
[02:09:21] SPEAKER_02: it's probably going to be too late. And sometimes, you know, you can say, we can wait, we can not do
[02:09:26] SPEAKER_02: anything. And we can just race to sort of super intelligent gods. We don't know how to control. And
[02:09:31] SPEAKER_02: where at that point are only options for response. If we lose control to something crazy like that,
[02:09:36] SPEAKER_02: our only option is going to be shutting down the entire internet or turning off the electricity grid.
[02:09:41] And so relative to that, we could do that crazy set of actions then, or we could take much more
[02:09:48] SPEAKER_02: reasonable actions right now. Assuming super intelligent doesn't just turn it back home.
[02:09:53] Which is why we have to do it before. That's the thing. So exactly. So we might even have that
[02:09:57] SPEAKER_02: option, which, but that's why it's like, I invoke that because it's like, that's something that no one
[02:10:02] SPEAKER_02: wants to say. And I'm not saying that to fear people. I'm saying, I'm saying that to say, if we don't
[02:10:06] SPEAKER_02: want to have to take that kind of extreme action relative to that extreme action, there's much more
[02:10:11] SPEAKER_02: reasonable things we can do right now. We can pass laws. We can have, you know, the Vatican make an
[02:10:16] SPEAKER_02: interfaith statement saying, we don't want super intelligent gods that are not, you know, that are
[02:10:21] SPEAKER_02: created by people who don't believe in God. We can have countries come to the table and say,
[02:10:25] SPEAKER_02: just like we did for nuclear non-proliferation, we can regulate the global supply of compute in
[02:10:30] SPEAKER_02: the world and know we're monitoring and enforcement. All of the computers, what uranium was for
[02:10:34] SPEAKER_02: nuclear weapons, all these advanced GPUs are for building this really crazy technology. And if we
[02:10:40] SPEAKER_02: could build a monitoring and verification infrastructure for that, which is hard and there's
[02:10:44] SPEAKER_02: people working on that every day, you can have zero knowledge proofs that have people say limited,
[02:10:49] SPEAKER_02: you know, semi-confidential things about each other's clusters, you can build agreements that would
[02:10:53] SPEAKER_02: enable something else to be possible. We cannot ship AI companions to kids that cause mass
[02:10:58] SPEAKER_02: suicides. We cannot build AI tutors that just cause mass attachment disorders. We can do narrow
[02:11:03] SPEAKER_02: tutors. We can do narrow AIs. We can have stronger whistleblower protections. We can have liability laws
[02:11:08] SPEAKER_02: that don't repeat the mistake of social media so that harms are actually on balance sheets that
[02:11:12] SPEAKER_02: creates the incentive for more responsible innovation. There's a hundred things that we could do.
[02:11:17] SPEAKER_02: And for anybody who says it's not possible, have you spent a week dedicated in your life fully
[02:11:22] SPEAKER_02: trying? If you say it's impossible, if you're a leader of the lab, say, we're never going to
[02:11:26] SPEAKER_02: be possible to coordinate, well, have you tried? Have you tried with everything? If you read,
[02:11:32] SPEAKER_02: if this was really existential stakes, have you really put everything on the line? We're talking
[02:11:37] SPEAKER_02: about some of the most powerful, wealthy, most connected people in the entire world.
[02:11:42] If the stakes were actually existential, have we done everything in our power yet to make something
[02:11:48] SPEAKER_02: else happen? If we have not done everything in our power yet, then there's still optionality for
[02:11:53] SPEAKER_02: us to take those actions and make something else happen. As much as we are accelerating in a certain
[02:12:01] SPEAKER_01: direction with AI, there is a growing counter movement, which is giving me some hope.
[02:12:07] SPEAKER_01: Yes. And there are conversations that weren't being had two years ago, which is now front-end
[02:12:11] SPEAKER_01: center. These conversations being a prime example. In fact, that-
[02:12:15] SPEAKER_01: You're podcasting. Having Jeff Hinton and Roman on talking about these things, having the friend.com,
[02:12:21] SPEAKER_02: which is like that pendant, the AI companion on your pendant, do you see these billboards in
[02:12:25] SPEAKER_02: New York City that people have graffiti on them and say, we don't want this future? You have
[02:12:28] SPEAKER_02: graffiti on them saying, AI is not inevitable. We're already seeing a counter movement just to
[02:12:32] SPEAKER_02: your point that you're making. Yes, and that gives me hope. And the fact that people have been so
[02:12:36] SPEAKER_01: receptive to these conversations about AI and the show has blown my mind, because I was super
[02:12:42] SPEAKER_01: curious and it's slightly technical, so I wasn't sure if everyone else would be, but the response
[02:12:46] SPEAKER_01: has been just profound everywhere I go. So I think there is hope there. There is hope that
[02:12:51] SPEAKER_01: humanity's deep Maslowian needs and greater sense and spiritual whatever is going to prevail
[02:12:57] SPEAKER_01: and win out and it's going to get louder and louder and louder. I just hope that it gets
[02:13:01] SPEAKER_01: loud enough before we reach a point of no return. And you're very much leaving that charge, so I thank
[02:13:08] SPEAKER_01: you for doing it because you'll be faced with a bunch of different incentives. I can't imagine
[02:13:12] SPEAKER_01: people are going to love you much, especially in big tech. I think people in big tech think I'm a
[02:13:16] SPEAKER_01: doomer. I think that's why Sam Altman won't come on the podcast. I think he thinks I'm a doomer,
[02:13:20] SPEAKER_01: which is actually not to the case. I love technology. I've put my whole life on it. I don't see it
[02:13:26] SPEAKER_01: as evil as much as I see a knife as being good at cutting my pizza and then also can be used in
[02:13:30] SPEAKER_01: malicious ways, but we regulate that. So I'm a big believer in conversation, even if it's
[02:13:35] SPEAKER_01: uncomfortable in the name of progress and in the pursuit of truth, actually truth becomes before
[02:13:40] SPEAKER_01: progress, to be so. That's my whole thing. And people know me know that I'm not like
[02:13:46] politically the way I sit here with Kamala Harris or Jordan Peterson or I'd sit here with Trump
[02:13:51] SPEAKER_01: and then I'd sit here with Gavin Newsom and Manjani from New York. I really don't.
[02:13:56] SPEAKER_01: This is not a political conversation. It's not a political conversation. I've no track record
[02:13:59] SPEAKER_01: of Vim political in any regard. But it's about truth. Yes. And that's exactly what I applaud you so
[02:14:06] SPEAKER_01: much for putting front and center because it's probably easier not to be in these times. It's
[02:14:12] SPEAKER_01: probably easier not to stick your head above the parapet in these times and to be seen as a doomer.
[02:14:19] Well, I'll invoke Jaren Leneer when he said in the film The Social Dilemma,
[02:14:23] SPEAKER_02: the critics are the true optimists because the critics are the ones being willing to say,
[02:14:28] SPEAKER_02: this is stupid. We can do better than this. That's the whole point. It's not to be a doomer.
[02:14:33] SPEAKER_02: Doomer would be if we just believe it's inevitable and there's nothing we can do. The whole point
[02:14:36] SPEAKER_02: of seeing the bad outcome clearly is to collectively put on our hand the steering wheel and choose
[02:14:42] SPEAKER_02: something else. A doomer would not talk. A doomer would not confront it. A doomer would not
[02:14:46] SPEAKER_01: confront it. You would just say that there's nothing we can do. Just don't we have a closing
[02:14:49] tradition on this podcast where they'll ask us a question for the next not knowing who they're
[02:14:52] SPEAKER_01: leaving it for. Oh, really? Question left for you is if you could slash had the chance to
[02:14:57] SPEAKER_01: relive a moment or day in your life, what would it be and why? I think reliving a beautiful day
[02:15:06] SPEAKER_02: with my mother before she died would probably be one. She passed when you were young? No, she passed
[02:15:12] SPEAKER_02: in 2018 from cancer. What immediately came to mind when you said that was just the people in my
[02:15:22] SPEAKER_02: life who I love so much and just reliving the most beautiful moments with them. How did that
[02:15:31] change you in any way, losing your mother in 2018? What fingerprints has it left?
[02:15:37] I think I just even before that, but more so even after she passed, I just really
[02:15:45] care about protecting the things that ultimately matter. There's just so many distractions. There's
[02:15:49] SPEAKER_02: money, there's status. I don't care about any of those things. I just want the things that matter
[02:15:54] SPEAKER_02: the most on your deathbed. I've had for a while in my life deathbed values. If I was going to die
[02:16:00] SPEAKER_02: tomorrow, what would be most important to me? Have every day my choices informed by that?
[02:16:09] I think living your life as if you're going to die, I mean Steve Jobs said that's an
[02:16:12] SPEAKER_02: inscradiation speech. I took an existential philosophy course at Stanford's one of my favorite
[02:16:16] SPEAKER_02: courses ever. I think that that carpentry and living truly as if you might die that today would
[02:16:25] SPEAKER_02: be a good day to die and to stand up as fully as you would. What would you do if you were going to
[02:16:31] SPEAKER_02: die? Not tomorrow, but soon. What would actually be important to you? For me, it's protecting the
[02:16:38] SPEAKER_02: things that are the most sacred and contributing to that. Life, the continuity of this thing that
[02:16:45] SPEAKER_02: were in. The most beautiful thing, I think it's said by a lot of people, but even if you got to
[02:16:50] SPEAKER_02: live for just a moment, just experience this for a moment. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful.
[02:16:55] SPEAKER_02: It's so special. I just want that to continue for everyone forever, ongoingly, so that people can
[02:17:02] SPEAKER_02: continue to experience that. There's a lot of forces in our society that take away people's
[02:17:10] SPEAKER_02: experience of that possibility. As someone with relative privilege, I want my life for at least
[02:17:18] SPEAKER_02: to be devoted to making things better for people who don't have that privilege. That's how I've always
[02:17:24] SPEAKER_02: felt. I think one of the biggest bottlenecks for something happening in the world is mass public
[02:17:28] SPEAKER_02: awareness. I was super excited to come here and talk to you today because I think that you have
[02:17:34] SPEAKER_02: a platform that can reach a lot of people. People, you're a wonderful interviewer and people,
[02:17:39] SPEAKER_02: I think can really hear this and say, maybe something else can happen. For me, I spent the last
[02:17:45] several days being very excited to talk to you today because this is one of the highest
[02:17:50] SPEAKER_02: leverage moves that in my life that I can hopefully do. If everybody was doing that for themselves
[02:17:55] SPEAKER_02: in their lives towards this issue and other issues that need to be tended to, if everybody
[02:18:02] SPEAKER_02: took responsibility for their domain, the places where they had agency and just showed up in
[02:18:06] SPEAKER_02: service of something bigger than themselves, how quickly the world could be very different,
[02:18:10] SPEAKER_02: very quickly, if everybody was more oriented that way. Obviously, we have an economic system that
[02:18:15] SPEAKER_02: disempowers people where they can barely make ends meet and put, if they had an emergency, they
[02:18:19] SPEAKER_02: wouldn't have the money to cover it. In that situation, it's hard for people to live that way.
[02:18:24] But I think anybody who has the ability to make things better for others and is in a position of
[02:18:31] SPEAKER_02: privilege, life feels so much more meaningful when you're showing up that way.
[02:18:37] On that point, from starting this book, I'm from the book, I'm reaching more people. There's
[02:18:41] SPEAKER_01: several moments where you feel a real sense of responsibility, but there hasn't actually been a
[02:18:45] SPEAKER_01: subject where I felt a greater sense of responsibility when I'm in the shower late at night or when I'm
[02:18:50] SPEAKER_01: doing my research, when I'm watching that Tesla shareholder presentation than this particular subject.
[02:18:58] SPEAKER_01: And because I do feel like we're in a real crossroads, crossroads kind of speaks to a binary,
[02:19:04] SPEAKER_01: which I don't love, but I feel like we're in an intersection where we have a choice to make
[02:19:07] SPEAKER_01: about the future. And having platforms like me and you do where we can speak to people or present
[02:19:12] SPEAKER_01: ideas, some ideas that I don't often get the most reach, I think is a great responsibility.
[02:19:17] SPEAKER_01: And I'm ways heavier on my shoulders, these conversations, which is also why we'd love to speak to,
[02:19:25] SPEAKER_01: maybe we should do a roundtable at some point with, if Sam you're listening and you want to come
[02:19:30] SPEAKER_01: to sit here, please come and sit here because I'd love to have a roundtable with you to get a more
[02:19:34] SPEAKER_01: holistic view of your perspective as well. Tristan, thank you so much.
[02:19:39] SPEAKER_01: Thank you so much, Stephen. This has been great.
[02:19:40] SPEAKER_01: You're a fantastic communicator and you're a wonderful human and both of those two things
[02:19:45] SPEAKER_01: shine through across this whole conversation. And I think maybe most importantly of all,
[02:19:50] SPEAKER_01: people will feel your heart. When you sit for three hours or someone, you kind of get a feel for who
[02:19:55] SPEAKER_01: they are on and off camera, but the feel that I've got on in view is not just someone who's very,
[02:19:58] SPEAKER_01: very smart, very educated, very informed, but it's someone that genuinely deeply really gives a
[02:20:03] SPEAKER_01: fuck. For reasons that feel very personal. And that PTSD thing we talked about,
[02:20:10] SPEAKER_01: where it's very, very true with you. There's something in you which is I think a little bit
[02:20:16] SPEAKER_01: troubled by an inevitability that others seem to have accepted, but you don't think we all need to
[02:20:22] SPEAKER_01: accept. Yes. And I think you can see something coming. So thank you so much for showing you wisdom
[02:20:27] SPEAKER_01: today. And I hope to have you back again sometime soon. Hopefully when the wheel has been
[02:20:30] SPEAKER_01: turned in the direction we all want. Let's come back and celebrate where we've made some
[02:20:34] SPEAKER_01: different choices. Hopefully. I hope so. Please do show this conversation everybody. I really,
[02:20:38] SPEAKER_01: really appreciate that. And thank you so much, Tristan. Thank you, soon.
[02:20:45] This is something that I've made for you. I've realized that the Diaries here at
[02:20:48] SPEAKER_01: Audients are strivers, whether it's in business or health. We all have big goals that we want to
[02:20:53] SPEAKER_01: accomplish. And one of the things I've learned is that when you aim at the big, big, big goal,
[02:20:58] SPEAKER_01: it can feel incredibly psychologically uncomfortable because it's kind of like being stood at the
[02:21:04] SPEAKER_01: foot of Mount Everest and looking upwards. The way to accomplish your goals is by breaking them
[02:21:08] SPEAKER_01: down into tiny small steps. And we call this an R team the 1%. And actually this philosophy is
[02:21:14] SPEAKER_01: highly responsible for much of our success here. So what we've done so that you at home can accomplish
[02:21:20] SPEAKER_01: any big goal that you have is we've made these 1% Diaries. And we've released these last year and
[02:21:26] SPEAKER_01: they all sold out. So I asked my team over and over again to bring the Diaries back, but also to
[02:21:30] SPEAKER_01: introduce some new colors and to make some minor tweaks to the Diaries. So now we have a better
[02:21:36] SPEAKER_01: range for you. So if you have a big goal in mind and you need a framework and a process and some
[02:21:42] SPEAKER_01: motivation that I highly recommend you get one of these Diaries before they all sell out once again.
[02:21:48] SPEAKER_01: And you can get yours now at the diary.com where you can get 20% off our Black Friday bundle.
[02:21:53] SPEAKER_01: And if you want the link, the link is in the description below.
