[00:00:00] A lot of people are looking for passive income from side hustles.
[00:00:03] Unknown Host: Yeah, it's the financial ozemic.
[00:00:05] Chris Kerner: And it's more accessible than ever.
[00:00:06] Chris Kerner: Like 90% of the ideas I talk about can be launched with $500 or less.
[00:00:10] Chris Kerner: And there's enough time in the day to do these on the nights and weekends.
[00:00:14] Unknown Host: So in these three suitcases in front of me, I have three different amounts of money.
[00:00:17] Unknown Host: And during this conversation, I'm gonna punish you a box at random.
[00:00:19] Unknown Host: And your job is to tell me what kind of business you would start with that amount of money.
[00:00:23] Unknown Host: Sounds good. Let's do this.
[00:00:25] Unknown Host: Known as the King of Side Hustles, Chris Kerner has launched over 80 businesses,
[00:00:29] Chris Kerner: earning millions in the process.
[00:00:31] Chris Kerner: And now the serial entrepreneur is going to teach us how to adopt a business mindset.
[00:00:36] Unknown Host: And launch simple, overlooked, but profitable ventures with little money.
[00:00:40] Chris Kerner: Many of us struggle financially and they see a side hustle as a solution to that.
[00:00:44] Chris Kerner: Like for me, growing up kind of poor, business allowed me to take hold of my life and make it what I wanted it to be.
[00:00:48] Chris Kerner: And it started when I was nine years old and wanting a red-swin bicycle.
[00:00:52] Chris Kerner: My friends had a bicycle, my neighbors had a bicycle, and my parents didn't have money for it.
[00:00:55] Chris Kerner: But I live across the street from a golf course.
[00:00:57] Chris Kerner: And these golf balls would fly in my yard.
[00:00:58] Chris Kerner: And I would go to my neighbors yard and go across the street, dig through the ditches,
[00:01:01] Chris Kerner: and I pull out all these golf balls, and I started selling them.
[00:01:03] Chris Kerner: That was my first business.
[00:01:05] Chris Kerner: That taught me that business is approachable.
[00:01:07] Chris Kerner: And we all have ideas, but we usually don't do anything about it.
[00:01:10] Chris Kerner: Why? I think number one, they're afraid of what people think.
[00:01:12] Chris Kerner: Number two is they don't have the tools, or they're not connecting the tools with the ideas.
[00:01:16] Chris Kerner: If we can get over those, the world is our oyster at that point.
[00:01:20] I got $1,000. What side hustle do you stop?
[00:01:22] Chris Kerner: The first thing that comes to mind is my favorite business idea of all right now.
[00:01:25] Chris Kerner: This is a zero-employed business.
[00:01:27] Chris Kerner: It's highly profitable.
[00:01:28] Chris Kerner: And that would be...
[00:01:30] So how important is it for you to love the things to be successful about it?
[00:01:33] Chris Kerner: Wait, nor passion. Follow the profit until you can afford to follow your passion.
[00:01:37] Chris Kerner: Do they need a business partner?
[00:01:38] Chris Kerner: No. If you look at the stats on business failure rates with companies that have co-founders,
[00:01:43] Chris Kerner: it's significantly higher than companies that have solo founders.
[00:01:46] Chris Kerner: And how does someone validate their business idea?
[00:01:48] Unknown Host: If I had to pick one tool, it's one that one and four humans use every day.
[00:01:51] Chris Kerner: That's everything you need right there.
[00:01:58] I see messages all the time in the comments section that some of you didn't realize you didn't subscribe.
[00:02:02] Unknown Host: So if you could do me a favor and double check if you're a subscriber to this channel,
[00:02:06] Unknown Host: that would be tremendously appreciated.

[00:02:15] Unknown Host: So please do double check if you subscribed.
[00:02:17] Unknown Host: And thank you so much because it's strange where you are,
[00:02:20] Unknown Host: you're part of our history and you're on this journey with us.
[00:02:23] Unknown Host: And I appreciate you for that. So yeah, thank you.
[00:02:33] Chris, who are you?
[00:02:35] Unknown Host: And what is the mission that you're on?
[00:02:39] I am a father.
[00:02:41] Chris Kerner: I am a husband and I'm a serial entrepreneur.
[00:02:44] Chris Kerner: And I love talking about business and starting businesses and inspiring other people to do the same.
[00:02:51] Why?
[00:02:53] Business has given me everything.
[00:02:55] Chris Kerner: Growing up kind of poor.
[00:02:56] Chris Kerner: It was my outlet.
[00:02:58] Chris Kerner: It was my way of just kind of taking hold of my life and making it what I wanted it to be.
[00:03:03] Chris Kerner: And I have immense gratitude for that.
[00:03:06] And I love, I just love talking about it.
[00:03:07] Chris Kerner: I, it's the only thing I know.
[00:03:10] Chris Kerner: I can't talk you about history or nutrition or anything, but when it comes to business, I just love it.
[00:03:15] Chris Kerner: And I want other people to love it as well.
[00:03:17] Chris Kerner: How have you made your name in the world of business?
[00:03:20] Unknown Host: Because I've heard your name a lot recently.
[00:03:22] Unknown Host: People call you the King of Side Hustles.
[00:03:25] Where has this come from?
[00:03:27] I think I just published my life on the internet now.
[00:03:30] Chris Kerner: I, I'm always testing and launching and starting businesses.
[00:03:34] Chris Kerner: But only over the last couple of years have I started publishing that.
[00:03:38] Chris Kerner: And I didn't try to be like the King of Side Hustles.
[00:03:42] Chris Kerner: That's not something that I've ever like intentionally tried to brand myself as.
[00:03:46] Chris Kerner: But I think people see what I do as a side hustle and they call it that.
[00:03:50] Chris Kerner: But I think that anything is scalable.
[00:03:52] Chris Kerner: Any side hustle could, could be a multi-million dollar business.
[00:03:56] Chris Kerner: I mean, we live on a planet with 8 billion people and we're all connected and anything can be scaled.
[00:04:01] Chris Kerner: And you make a lot of content now.
[00:04:02] Unknown Host: So you've probably had a bit of a feedback loop in terms of understanding
[00:04:07] Unknown Host: what it is that you say and do and create that's resonant with people.
[00:04:11] Unknown Host: And also why it's resonant.
[00:04:12] Unknown Host: Like what is the crux of what people like my audiences are looking for?
[00:04:17] Unknown Host: As humans, we all want a silver bullet.
[00:04:21] Chris Kerner: We want a solution to our problems and many of us struggle financially.
[00:04:26] Chris Kerner: And they see a side hustle as an outlet to that or as a solution to that.
[00:04:31] Chris Kerner: I think everyone has ideas.
[00:04:33] Chris Kerner: Most people are very hesitant to execute on those ideas.
[00:04:38] Chris Kerner: And so when they see someone like me freely executing on all the ideas,
[00:04:42] Chris Kerner: it hopefully it opens their mind and helps them look at their ideas in a different way
[00:04:48] Chris Kerner: or a more approachable way and maybe gives them confidence to do the same.
[00:04:52] Chris Kerner: In the boxes in front of me here, I have three different amounts of money.
[00:04:57] $500, I think I have $1,000 and $5,000.
[00:05:01] Unknown Host: And during this conversation, I'm going to punish you a box at random.
[00:05:04] Unknown Host: And your job is to tell me what kind of business you would start with that amount of money
[00:05:08] Unknown Host: because I know my audience, many of them are interested in starting their business one day.
[00:05:13] Unknown Host: And I use specifically low amounts of money just to make it as accessible to them as possible.
[00:05:17] Unknown Host: So we will do that at some point.
[00:05:19] Unknown Host: I'll pass you the boxes.
[00:05:20] Unknown Host: You give me three business ideas.
[00:05:21] Unknown Host: You'd start with $500, $1,000 and $5,000.
[00:05:25] Unknown Host: But I want to get a view on you and the businesses that you've started
[00:05:29] Unknown Host: and the variety of success you've had.
[00:05:32] Unknown Host: So can you give me another view?
[00:05:33] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:05:34] Chris Kerner: So I was nine years old living in Utah and I lived across the street from a golf course.
[00:05:39] Chris Kerner: And these golf balls would fly in my yard.
[00:05:41] Chris Kerner: And I don't know what gave me the idea, but I started selling them.
[00:05:45] Chris Kerner: I just wanted money for a bike.
[00:05:47] Chris Kerner: I wanted the Shwin bicycle and it was red and my friends had a bicycle, my neighbors had
[00:05:51] Chris Kerner: a bicycle and my parents didn't have money for it.
[00:05:53] Chris Kerner: And so for whatever reason, I connected that white golf ball in my grass with money.
[00:05:58] Chris Kerner: And I would go to my neighbors yards, I'd go across the street, I'd dig through the
[00:06:02] Chris Kerner: ditches and I'd pull out all these golf balls, I'd wash them.
[00:06:05] Chris Kerner: And then I put up this huge piece of plywood in front of my house that said golf balls
[00:06:08] Chris Kerner: three for a dollar.
[00:06:10] Chris Kerner: And that was my first business.
[00:06:12] Chris Kerner: And at the time it was just normal, it was natural.
[00:06:14] Chris Kerner: I didn't know any different.
[00:06:16] Chris Kerner: And now I have a nine year old and I was nine when I did that.
[00:06:20] Chris Kerner: And we live on a busy road today.
[00:06:21] Chris Kerner: I lived on a busy road then.
[00:06:22] Chris Kerner: And the thought of him like negotiating, haggling with grownups wearing polo shirts on our
[00:06:29] Chris Kerner: doorstep is unfathomable.
[00:06:31] Chris Kerner: But that's what I was doing.
[00:06:32] Chris Kerner: And that planted the seed.
[00:06:34] Chris Kerner: That kind of taught me that business is approachable.
[00:06:38] Chris Kerner: Preferably it's approachable.
[00:06:40] Chris Kerner: Approachable and scalable can be the same thing.
[00:06:42] Chris Kerner: They don't have to be adults with one another.
[00:06:44] Chris Kerner: So.
[00:06:45] Unknown Host: And how many businesses have you started since then?
[00:06:46] Unknown Host: I lose count.
[00:06:47] Chris Kerner: I have a spreadsheet, but it's at least 80.
[00:06:51] And what's the, what are the outcomes been?
[00:06:53] Unknown Host: How much money have you made?
[00:06:55] Unknown Host: How has that changed your life?
[00:06:56] Unknown Host: What freedom has that given you?
[00:06:57] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:06:58] Chris Kerner: So cumulatively, all of the businesses have generated low hundreds of millions of revenue,
[00:07:04] Chris Kerner: low tens of millions of profit.
[00:07:07] Chris Kerner: But on a real number basis, the majority of them have been abandoned or fizzled out or
[00:07:14] Chris Kerner: failed or there was too much opportunity costs.
[00:07:17] Chris Kerner: So I pivoted to something else.
[00:07:20] It's just a numbers game.
[00:07:22] And how has that changed your life?
[00:07:24] Unknown Host: What does your lifestyle look like?
[00:07:26] My life is awesome.
[00:07:27] Chris Kerner: We built our dream house in our 20s.
[00:07:30] Chris Kerner: We had all four of our kids in our 20s.
[00:07:32] Chris Kerner: We travel a lot.
[00:07:34] Chris Kerner: We're, I've been married for 17 years.
[00:07:35] Chris Kerner: And we're a very close family.
[00:07:37] Chris Kerner: We take a lot of trips.
[00:07:40] We live in a good school district, but my kids go to public school and we have everything
[00:07:44] Chris Kerner: we need and more.
[00:07:45] Chris Kerner: And we're very grateful for that.
[00:07:47] What is the over sort of underpinning mentality that's required for someone to be successful
[00:07:54] Unknown Host: starting businesses in the way that you've started them, starting these side hustles
[00:07:57] Unknown Host: at volume and seeing success?
[00:08:00] Unknown Host: Is there like a foundational mentality or personality or character trait required
[00:08:05] Unknown Host: before we get into the tactics?
[00:08:07] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:08:08] Chris Kerner: The, I should say that the pain of your problem needs to be greater than how much you
[00:08:16] Chris Kerner: care about what people think about you.
[00:08:18] Chris Kerner: It needs to get to that point.
[00:08:20] Chris Kerner: Because by far, that is the biggest roadblock to success is people caring too much about
[00:08:25] Chris Kerner: what people think about them.
[00:08:27] Chris Kerner: And so they don't want to do the thing or they don't want to talk about doing the thing
[00:08:30] Chris Kerner: because some random person from high school follows them on Facebook and might comment
[00:08:35] Chris Kerner: something, right?
[00:08:37] Chris Kerner: Which is really silly, but I've been there.
[00:08:38] Chris Kerner: I get it, right?
[00:08:40] Chris Kerner: If we can get over that, if we can just flip the switch in our brain that says people
[00:08:43] Chris Kerner: are thinking about me, people are caring about me.
[00:08:46] Chris Kerner: They just switch that to off.
[00:08:47] Chris Kerner: Well, when, right?
[00:08:49] Chris Kerner: Because the world is our oyster at that point.
[00:08:51] Chris Kerner: And in terms of where we sit at this moment of time with technology, with AI, with
[00:08:56] Unknown Host: fast internet, with mobile phones, do you think this is the best time for people to start
[00:09:01] Unknown Host: something, to start a side hustle or to try?
[00:09:06] Chris Kerner: Every day that goes by, the timing gets better for people, right?
[00:09:10] Chris Kerner: Things are getting more competitive, but there are more tools than ever.
[00:09:13] Chris Kerner: 10 years ago, if I wanted to start a business, and this is what the internet's in full swing,
[00:09:18] Chris Kerner: social media's in full swing.
[00:09:20] Chris Kerner: I probably had to spend a lot of money or move to San Francisco or raise venture capital.
[00:09:25] Chris Kerner: That's like, I would love for you to try to convince me.
[00:09:28] Chris Kerner: Try to give me an idea where you have to raise money or where you have to go all in or
[00:09:33] Chris Kerner: where you have to quit your job.
[00:09:35] Chris Kerner: It doesn't exist.
[00:09:36] Chris Kerner: With all these AI tools, software tools, you can make a website with one prompt, you can
[00:09:40] Chris Kerner: make an app with one prompt, you can post a Facebook marketplace and have hundreds of
[00:09:44] Chris Kerner: inquiries within an hour, you can post Facebook ads, you can go to Craigslist, you can
[00:09:48] Chris Kerner: put a sign up in front of your house, you can go launch a survey to people.
[00:09:53] Chris Kerner: There are so many tools for testing and validating and experimenting with these concepts that
[00:09:58] Chris Kerner: it is more accessible than ever.
[00:10:01] Why don't people?
[00:10:04] I think number one is, they're afraid of what people think.
[00:10:07] Chris Kerner: Number two is they don't have the tools or at least they're not connecting the tools
[00:10:11] Chris Kerner: with the ideas.
[00:10:12] Chris Kerner: They'll use Facebook marketplace to sell a sectional, but then they won't think to
[00:10:17] Chris Kerner: use it when validating their woodworking idea.
[00:10:22] Chris Kerner: They're just not connecting the dots.
[00:10:24] Chris Kerner: There's too many tools in a sense, so we don't know how to tie them all together.
[00:10:30] They also probably don't know how much the law of abundance is a real thing.
[00:10:37] Chris Kerner: People think business is a zero sum game.
[00:10:39] Chris Kerner: They think things are oversaturated.
[00:10:42] Chris Kerner: They'll have an idea for a product or service and then they'll get really excited and then
[00:10:46] Chris Kerner: they'll go Google it and then they'll see it exist and they'll move on.
[00:10:50] Chris Kerner: When I do that and I see it exist, I'm like, yes, this is it.
[00:10:54] Chris Kerner: Someone went to the front lines of the battlefield and validated this for me.
[00:10:58] Chris Kerner: Then I'll go to the web archive.
[00:11:00] Chris Kerner: I'll go to who is and I'll go look at what their website is look like over the last decade.
[00:11:05] Chris Kerner: See where they started.
[00:11:06] Chris Kerner: Maybe their product was $99.
[00:11:08] Chris Kerner: Now it's like 49 every two months.
[00:11:11] Chris Kerner: Interesting.
[00:11:12] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[00:11:13] Chris Kerner: I'll look at the copy of their headline.
[00:11:15] Chris Kerner: I'll look at how many tabs they have on their website.
[00:11:19] Chris Kerner: Do they post their Instagram feed?
[00:11:20] Chris Kerner: I'll look at all these things and see how it's evolved over time and think, awesome.
[00:11:25] Chris Kerner: I'm going to start where he's at today.
[00:11:27] Chris Kerner: This guy already proved it out for me.
[00:11:29] Chris Kerner: He took all the risk.
[00:11:30] Chris Kerner: This is amazing.
[00:11:31] Chris Kerner: This exists.
[00:11:32] Chris Kerner: I don't need to do it better.
[00:11:33] Chris Kerner: I don't need to do it differently.
[00:11:35] Chris Kerner: I just need to do the same thing.
[00:11:38] Chris Kerner: The market is big enough.
[00:11:39] Chris Kerner: The world is big enough to where I can win as well.
[00:11:42] You said on web archive, what role does web archive play?
[00:11:45] Unknown Host: What is that for anyone that isn't familiar and how do you use that?
[00:11:48] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:11:49] Chris Kerner: It's just a tool that shows snapshots over time of what a website looks like.
[00:11:54] Chris Kerner: It's a great way of reverse engineering.
[00:11:56] Chris Kerner: What businesses have done to be successful?
[00:11:59] Chris Kerner: There's another tool called Similar Web where you can see what their traffic has been
[00:12:02] Chris Kerner: over time.
[00:12:04] Chris Kerner: You can overlay the two.
[00:12:06] Chris Kerner: You can say, oh, interesting.
[00:12:07] Chris Kerner: When they redesigned their website to be more mobile friendly, their traffic went from
[00:12:11] Chris Kerner: 3000 a month to 4500 a month.
[00:12:15] Chris Kerner: Interesting.
[00:12:16] Chris Kerner: I'm just going to make it mobile friendly from day one.
[00:12:19] Chris Kerner: We are at a great advantage when we start where our competitors or our future competitors
[00:12:24] Chris Kerner: already are.
[00:12:25] Chris Kerner: Instead of starting where we think we need to be, starting trying to be different or innovative
[00:12:29] Chris Kerner: or unique.
[00:12:30] Chris Kerner: In my experience, that's more of a signal of our pride or our ego.
[00:12:35] Chris Kerner: We feel kind of weird or odd or even dirty or unethical if we're just copying and pasting
[00:12:41] Chris Kerner: a business.
[00:12:42] Chris Kerner: Even if we had the original idea ourselves, when really there's nothing to be ashamed
[00:12:46] Chris Kerner: of, we don't want to steal their intellectual property or their logo or anything.
[00:12:50] Chris Kerner: But copy was already working.
[00:12:53] People don't think that that's a thing because they think if I copy a business that's
[00:12:58] Unknown Host: already working, then I'm not going to get any customers because this existing business
[00:13:02] Unknown Host: has all the customers.
[00:13:03] Unknown Host: But it's interesting.
[00:13:04] Unknown Host: I had some on the show where they talked about how some of the greatest entrepreneurs
[00:13:08] Unknown Host: in the world basically just copy 95% of the blueprint.
[00:13:10] Unknown Host: I think it was Walmart.
[00:13:11] Unknown Host: I think it was doing it Walmart.
[00:13:12] Unknown Host: But they copied other regional grocery chains.
[00:13:17] Copying is a strategy.
[00:13:20] Have you done that?
[00:13:21] Oh, absolutely.
[00:13:22] Unknown Host: Many examples.
[00:13:23] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[00:13:24] Well, I had a phone repair business in when I was in college 2010.
[00:13:31] Chris Kerner: And I got a call one day from someone that said, hey, Chris, I want to buy all of your broken
[00:13:37] Chris Kerner: iPhone screens.
[00:13:38] Chris Kerner: Do you have any broken iPhone screens?
[00:13:39] Chris Kerner: Sure.
[00:13:40] Chris Kerner: We don't throw them away because we think it's bad for the environment.
[00:13:42] Chris Kerner: We just have a box of them.
[00:13:44] Chris Kerner: How much will you pay me?
[00:13:45] Chris Kerner: Three bucks a piece.
[00:13:46] Chris Kerner: Why?
[00:13:47] Chris Kerner: What?
[00:13:48] Chris Kerner: Why will you pay me $3?
[00:13:49] Chris Kerner: It's just broken glass.
[00:13:50] Chris Kerner: And they said, well, there's actually a way of remanufacturing these.
[00:13:53] Chris Kerner: You can send China.
[00:13:54] Chris Kerner: We can remove the broken glass, put new glass on them, and then we can resell them as a
[00:13:58] Chris Kerner: remanufactured unit.
[00:14:00] And that was just like a light bulb, right?
[00:14:02] Chris Kerner: So most people I think at this point would say, yeah, like, yeah, where do I ship these?
[00:14:07] Chris Kerner: But I was like, oh, I need to be in that business.
[00:14:10] Chris Kerner: I want to copy that guy who called me, right?
[00:14:12] Chris Kerner: Now, I don't know what his website was.
[00:14:14] Chris Kerner: I don't know.
[00:14:15] Chris Kerner: I don't know what the name of his business was.
[00:14:17] Chris Kerner: There was no web archive at the time to look at.
[00:14:19] Chris Kerner: I just wanted to copy the business model because I thought, this is going to be a thing.
[00:14:24] Chris Kerner: I'm in the industry.
[00:14:25] Chris Kerner: I know the industry.
[00:14:26] Chris Kerner: I'm going to do this as well.
[00:14:27] Chris Kerner: So we did two million the first year, then five, and then nine, and then we exited
[00:14:31] Chris Kerner: a few years after that.
[00:14:33] It's interesting, but you know, you often don't think that everyone's in search of a new
[00:14:37] Unknown Host: idea.
[00:14:39] And it's tough to find new ideas.
[00:14:41] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:14:42] Chris Kerner: Like, I think, was it Einstein that said, there's no such thing as a new idea?
[00:14:45] Unknown Host: That sounds right.
[00:14:46] Chris Kerner: But you have an orientation just to look at existing models and to replicate them.
[00:14:50] Unknown Host: Do you put a spin on it at all?
[00:14:53] I'll develop my own spins over time, right?
[00:14:55] Chris Kerner: Because we're all a product of our environment.
[00:14:57] Chris Kerner: And so in the case of this business, I started copying exactly, right?
[00:15:03] Chris Kerner: I went and found people in China.
[00:15:05] Chris Kerner: I just went to Alibaba.
[00:15:06] Chris Kerner: I messaged a ton of people to sold iPhone screens and I said, do you recycle?
[00:15:10] Chris Kerner: Do you recycle?
[00:15:11] Chris Kerner: Do you recycle?
[00:15:12] Chris Kerner: And like five or 10% of them said, yes.
[00:15:14] Chris Kerner: So then I shipped them samples and then they shipped me some back.
[00:15:18] Chris Kerner: And then over time, I started like taking some marketing principles, principles from
[00:15:22] Chris Kerner: previous businesses like Facebook ads, cold calling.
[00:15:25] Chris Kerner: And I started applying them just because I didn't know how this other competitor was
[00:15:30] Chris Kerner: finding success.
[00:15:31] Chris Kerner: I knew he was cold calling and that was working.
[00:15:33] Chris Kerner: That's all I knew.
[00:15:34] Chris Kerner: Remember, I didn't even know the name of his business.
[00:15:35] Chris Kerner: And so over time, you start using your previous experiences to apply these tweaks to the
[00:15:41] Chris Kerner: business and to make it your own.
[00:15:43] Chris Kerner: But if you do that right at the outset, right?
[00:15:45] Chris Kerner: Like if I got a call and he said, I want to buy your broken iPhone screens and I said,
[00:15:48] Chris Kerner: okay, I'm going to do that, but I don't want to just sell iPhone screens.
[00:15:51] Chris Kerner: That's lame.
[00:15:52] Chris Kerner: I'm going to do Samsung, right?
[00:15:54] Pretty good chance there's not even a market for that or there's not even a method
[00:15:56] Chris Kerner: for that.
[00:15:57] Chris Kerner: And because of my ego, my pride, my unwillingness to just copy what's already working, I wouldn't
[00:16:03] Chris Kerner: that I wouldn't have that successful business in my back pocket, right?
[00:16:08] Chris Kerner: So if you do twist in the beginning, it's kind of like your kind of thinking, you know,
[00:16:13] Chris Kerner: thinking of an analogy, like if you're on a long road trip and you start taking detours
[00:16:17] Chris Kerner: early on, or if a flight is on a flight path and he starts like getting off track just
[00:16:21] Chris Kerner: a little bit at the beginning, he's going to end up, he's going to end up hundreds of miles
[00:16:25] Chris Kerner: away from his destination.
[00:16:27] Chris Kerner: But if he starts making tweaks along the way, then he'll be much closer to where he would
[00:16:31] Chris Kerner: have been anyway.
[00:16:32] And you might reach a better destination with some of the exact weeks because you're
[00:16:37] Chris Kerner: blending it with your, your experience.
[00:16:39] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:16:40] Chris Kerner: You know better than the person that you're copying.
[00:16:42] Unknown Host: And so it's important to copy the model exactly at the beginning because you're also going
[00:16:47] Unknown Host: to learn what it is about that existing model that works.
[00:16:50] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:16:51] Unknown Host: And therefore what you can iterate on change expand.
[00:16:54] Unknown Host: If you, if you didn't, then you might miss something.
[00:16:56] Unknown Host: Exactly.
[00:16:57] Chris Kerner: Because so often I made the mistake of looking at another business and saying, man, why
[00:17:01] Chris Kerner: are they doing that?
[00:17:02] Chris Kerner: Why are they charging like that?
[00:17:04] Chris Kerner: Well, like they're charging all these different things that are so confusing.
[00:17:07] Chris Kerner: I made this mistake.
[00:17:08] Chris Kerner: I had an e-commerce fulfillment business where brands would send us all their products
[00:17:12] Chris Kerner: we have this big warehouse.
[00:17:14] Chris Kerner: And we would ship all of their stuff out.
[00:17:17] And I was like, why do they have storage fees, pick back and ship fees?
[00:17:22] Chris Kerner: They charge fees for tracking their expiration dates.
[00:17:26] Chris Kerner: They charge extra fees if there's five items in a box for four.
[00:17:29] Chris Kerner: Like, there's so much friction there.
[00:17:30] Chris Kerner: That's so messy.
[00:17:31] Chris Kerner: Like, we're going to make this simple.
[00:17:33] Chris Kerner: We're going to just one flat fee, no storage fee, and that's going to be our differentiator,
[00:17:37] Chris Kerner: right?
[00:17:38] Chris Kerner: Over time, over the course of months and years, we learned, oh, storage fees.
[00:17:43] Chris Kerner: It's because sometimes your customers go out of business and then you're left holding
[00:17:47] Chris Kerner: the bill and like your storage costs are actually very high.
[00:17:50] Chris Kerner: But there's nothing to pass on.
[00:17:52] Chris Kerner: Oh, pick back and ship fees because you learn all these things.
[00:17:55] Chris Kerner: And you're like, okay, I wasn't like this genius that had an MBA.
[00:17:59] Chris Kerner: I was just like trying to put my own spin on it because I thought I was smarter than
[00:18:02] Chris Kerner: that business owner.
[00:18:03] Chris Kerner: Turns out someone that's been doing this for 15 years versus 15 days knows a lot more
[00:18:07] Chris Kerner: about the industry than me.
[00:18:09] Chris Kerner: And I'm much better off just copying his pricing, copying the land of his website, copying
[00:18:13] Chris Kerner: the size of the warehouse he has, copying the same niche that he's going after, because
[00:18:18] Chris Kerner: that's clearly working for him.
[00:18:20] Chris Kerner: So I don't make that mistake anymore.
[00:18:21] Chris Kerner: I don't assume that other competitors are idiots, right?
[00:18:25] Chris Kerner: Yeah, I've been proven wrong too many times.
[00:18:27] Chris Kerner: I assume that they're doing that because they've learned the hard way.
[00:18:32] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:18:33] Unknown Host: And if I copy them, then I won't have to learn the hard way.
[00:18:35] Chris Kerner: I had several of our executives over at my house over the last couple of days.
[00:18:39] Unknown Host: And we were looking at different models.
[00:18:41] Unknown Host: So basically, we're looking at other companies that do similar things to us that have been
[00:18:45] Unknown Host: around for a long time.
[00:18:47] Unknown Host: And the question I ended up asking at one moment, when I was at the exact same epiphany,
[00:18:50] Unknown Host: I was like, why did they do it that way, isn't that shitty?
[00:18:53] Chris Kerner: And there was a second where I think we were tempted to trend reinvent the wheel.
[00:18:58] Unknown Host: But the question I asked myself now with the wisdom of like many years of businesses,
[00:19:01] Unknown Host: like, why did it end up that way?
[00:19:05] Unknown Host: Which is why did our competitor who's been doing this for 50 years end up there?
[00:19:10] Unknown Host: Because as you said, there's clearly a set of things that have happened that have made
[00:19:15] Unknown Host: them conclude, whether it's that scale or some other factor that's made them conclude.
[00:19:20] Unknown Host: This is the best way of doing it.
[00:19:21] Unknown Host: And just like you, I've been wrong so many times where I've thought, how they're just
[00:19:24] Unknown Host: idiots, that's why they, they, they, they, they, they, I can't see this obvious thing.
[00:19:27] Unknown Host: But actually, their model is stress tested in the market much more than minus.
[00:19:31] Unknown Host: Maybe I should, I should put my ego aside and at least start how they start, as you said,
[00:19:37] Unknown Host: which I think is really important advice.
[00:19:38] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:19:39] Chris Kerner: Well, there are times when a company just keeps doing something because it works.
[00:19:41] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:19:42] Chris Kerner: And so they don't take the time to test something that works better, right?
[00:19:46] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:19:47] Chris Kerner: But it's almost impossible to guess what that is, right?
[00:19:49] Chris Kerner: Like if a, if a clothing brand is growing their business entirely through Facebook ads,
[00:19:54] Chris Kerner: and they've just never tried Google ads, maybe Google ads could convert twice as better,
[00:19:58] Chris Kerner: twice, but twice better, right?
[00:20:00] Chris Kerner: But I don't want to guess that.
[00:20:02] Chris Kerner: I just want to start with Facebook ads and then I'll still take 5% of my budget and start
[00:20:05] Chris Kerner: testing other concepts.
[00:20:07] Chris Kerner: But nine times out of 10, I ended up just coming right back to Facebook ads.
[00:20:11] It got me thinking about how in business, basically everything, again, speaking broadly
[00:20:15] Unknown Host: here, can be put into one of two categories, either like old problems, where thousands of
[00:20:19] Unknown Host: people have come before you.
[00:20:21] Unknown Host: And the same solutions and same thinking is still relevant and their new problems.
[00:20:27] Unknown Host: You know, things like AI have created a set of new problems and new opportunities as
[00:20:31] Unknown Host: well.
[00:20:32] Unknown Host: And what I tend to find is that like 95% of the things in business are like old problems.
[00:20:36] Unknown Host: Like hiring, cash flow, how finance is done legal, all those kinds of things.
[00:20:40] And when you're dealing with an old problem, expertise is usually the answer, which is
[00:20:45] Unknown Host: like find someone who knows who hire someone or mentor or whatever.
[00:20:49] Unknown Host: And then you have these new problems where there is no blueprint in our industry.
[00:20:53] Unknown Host: It's a new challenge.
[00:20:54] Unknown Host: So experimentation is the answer.
[00:20:57] Unknown Host: Does that like broadly hold in your mind?
[00:20:59] Unknown Host: Oh, 100%.
[00:21:00] Unknown Host: Yeah, I like to say test everything except drugs.
[00:21:03] Chris Kerner: Like we're always testing.
[00:21:06] Chris Kerner: It's the basis to everything we do.
[00:21:08] But do you test when it's an old problem?
[00:21:11] Can you give me an example?
[00:21:12] Unknown Host: So like things like cash flow management, hiring principles around like probation and notice
[00:21:22] Unknown Host: periods, a lot of legal structuring and deals, things with like a well established president,
[00:21:29] Unknown Host: well established presidents, well, nothing has fundamentally changed in the world.
[00:21:32] Unknown Host: That makes that invalid.
[00:21:35] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:21:36] I think if it's an old problem, I look to an example of someone within the last decade that
[00:21:41] Chris Kerner: solved it in an interesting way.
[00:21:43] Chris Kerner: And I'm more likely to copy that like in hiring, traditionally companies will they'll
[00:21:48] Chris Kerner: spend hours and weeks or days hiring going from round to round to round person person
[00:21:52] Chris Kerner: person.
[00:21:53] Chris Kerner: And if you look at why combinator, arguably the greatest, you know, startup in computer
[00:21:57] Chris Kerner: in the world, they have seven minute interviews.
[00:22:00] Chris Kerner: And they said they would make it five minutes, but it just felt rude, right?
[00:22:03] Chris Kerner: And in their interviews, they really know in the first three minutes if it's a fit or
[00:22:07] Chris Kerner: not.
[00:22:08] Chris Kerner: And then the interview is done like they're either in or they're not.
[00:22:10] Chris Kerner: I approach hiring the same way.
[00:22:13] Chris Kerner: I would much rather take like a law of large numbers approach to it and give five people
[00:22:21] Chris Kerner: 30 days to show what their skills are as opposed to spending 30 days going all in on one
[00:22:26] Chris Kerner: person.
[00:22:27] Chris Kerner: Because in my experience, that one person that I spent 30 days on is not anymore likely
[00:22:31] Chris Kerner: to succeed than those those other five people that I might be testing.
[00:22:36] Unknown Host: Okay.
[00:22:38] And you'll example of that storage company started.
[00:22:41] Chris Kerner: It sounds like you hit an old problem.
[00:22:43] Chris Kerner: Yes, very much so.
[00:22:44] Chris Kerner: And you tried to innovate and experiment, but this was an old problem where the laws of
[00:22:48] Unknown Host: human beings and how they behave and businesses getting bust was still pertinent.
[00:22:51] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:22:52] Chris Kerner: And at the end of our two year experiment, like we look just like all of our competitors.
[00:22:56] Chris Kerner: Right.
[00:22:57] Chris Kerner: So if we would have started there, we could have saved two years.
[00:23:00] Chris Kerner: And this is what I find is founders waste years trying to experiment where old problems
[00:23:06] Unknown Host: are still strong and still hold.
[00:23:10] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:23:11] Unknown Host: And I think that the mistake, several of the mistakes I made in my company was that
[00:23:13] Unknown Host: I should have spent all of my time experimenting on the new problems and should have hired
[00:23:17] Unknown Host: people to tell me how to navigate the old problems.
[00:23:21] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:23:22] Unknown Host: What was your, I think one of the videos that made you go pretty viral was your story
[00:23:27] Unknown Host: of buckies.
[00:23:28] We don't know what buckies is around the world.
[00:23:30] Unknown Host: I think it's a US brand.
[00:23:31] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:23:32] Chris Kerner: But this shows, I think, how you've always had an orientation to things slightly differently
[00:23:36] Unknown Host: or in it, innovatively.
[00:23:37] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:23:38] Chris Kerner: What happened with buckies?
[00:23:39] Chris Kerner: So this was during the time when I was running that business shipping products for other
[00:23:43] Chris Kerner: companies, right?
[00:23:44] Chris Kerner: Buckies is a gas station brand with only 50 locations.
[00:23:48] Chris Kerner: And from those 50 locations, they do billions of dollars of revenue.
[00:23:52] Chris Kerner: I say gas station.
[00:23:53] Chris Kerner: They're between 40,000, 80,000 square feet.
[00:23:56] Chris Kerner: Wow.
[00:23:57] Chris Kerner: They're massive.
[00:23:58] Chris Kerner: They have an amazing brand, an amazing logo.
[00:24:00] Chris Kerner: And they just have a lot of trust from their customers.
[00:24:04] Chris Kerner: But these gas stations are like, they're on the way out to these road trip destinations.
[00:24:07] Chris Kerner: They're out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:24:09] Chris Kerner: And so if you're, if you live in Dallas and you're driving down to the beach, you're going
[00:24:12] Chris Kerner: to stop by buckies on the way there, on the way back and you're probably going to spend
[00:24:14] Chris Kerner: hundreds of dollars, right?
[00:24:16] Chris Kerner: You're going to fill up the tank, then you're going to buy shirts and snacks and all that
[00:24:19] Chris Kerner: stuff.
[00:24:20] So at the time we were running this e-commerce fulfillment business, we went to buckies.
[00:24:24] Chris Kerner: I brought my cousin, my business partner, just to kind of show him the experience.
[00:24:29] Chris Kerner: And we were just having a conversation.
[00:24:30] Chris Kerner: I remember exactly where I was.
[00:24:32] Chris Kerner: I was like under this underpass, this huge underpass in DFW.
[00:24:35] Chris Kerner: We were driving home.
[00:24:36] Chris Kerner: And I said, man, these guys must kill it online.
[00:24:39] Chris Kerner: They must sell so much stuff.
[00:24:42] Chris Kerner: Why?
[00:24:43] Chris Kerner: Because I knew that Disney sells like billions of dollars of t-shirts on their website,
[00:24:48] Chris Kerner: right?
[00:24:49] Chris Kerner: I read a stat recently.
[00:24:50] Chris Kerner: So I kind of just took that data point connected to buckies and said, all right, buckies
[00:24:52] Chris Kerner: is a fraction of the size of Disney, but they have the same amount of brand loyalty.
[00:24:57] Chris Kerner: People love their shirts.
[00:24:58] Chris Kerner: You'll see their shirts all over the world, even though they only have 50 locations like
[00:25:02] Chris Kerner: in the southeast, right?
[00:25:03] Chris Kerner: And so we went to their website and there was no shop button.
[00:25:06] Chris Kerner: There was no place to buy their stuff.
[00:25:09] Chris Kerner: And I was just like, like all the light bulbs were going off at once, right?
[00:25:13] Chris Kerner: It was like, oh my gosh, okay.
[00:25:16] Chris Kerner: We need to reach out to them.
[00:25:17] Chris Kerner: Like we need to bring them online.
[00:25:18] Chris Kerner: I just had all these ideas and my cousin is much more balanced than I am.
[00:25:23] Chris Kerner: He's like the operator and I'm like the ADHD crazy guy, right?
[00:25:27] Chris Kerner: So his role is to like calm me down.
[00:25:29] Chris Kerner: And he's very good at that.
[00:25:30] Chris Kerner: But I just couldn't be calmed down from this.
[00:25:32] Chris Kerner: I'm like, no, no, no, no, we got to do something here.
[00:25:35] Chris Kerner: We're going to buy one of everything.
[00:25:37] We're going to hire a photographer to take pictures of it.
[00:25:40] Chris Kerner: We're going to launch our own Bucky's online store.
[00:25:43] Chris Kerner: And we're going to try to go viral.
[00:25:45] Chris Kerner: Like it's viral or bust, right?
[00:25:46] Chris Kerner: If we don't go viral, then I'll just be eating these unhealthy snacks for the next three
[00:25:50] Chris Kerner: years of my life.
[00:25:52] Chris Kerner: And so we did.
[00:25:53] Chris Kerner: We bought one of everything.
[00:25:54] Chris Kerner: Costs thousands of dollars.
[00:25:55] Chris Kerner: I brought all four of my kids and we brought it back to our warehouse.
[00:25:59] Chris Kerner: We took pictures of it.
[00:26:00] Chris Kerner: We launched a website.
[00:26:02] Chris Kerner: And I emailed all the reporters I could find.
[00:26:05] Chris Kerner: And one of them just loved the idea.
[00:26:08] Chris Kerner: He ran with it.
[00:26:09] Chris Kerner: And so he reached out to Bucky's for comment because they wouldn't respond to my cold emails.
[00:26:13] Chris Kerner: I wanted to launch this like with them in tandem, but who am I?
[00:26:16] Chris Kerner: They didn't care about me.
[00:26:17] Chris Kerner: And I don't blame them.
[00:26:18] Chris Kerner: And so he wrote this big article about me.
[00:26:21] Chris Kerner: Millions of people read it.
[00:26:22] Chris Kerner: All these other news outlets wrote about it.
[00:26:25] Chris Kerner: And we did hundreds of thousands of dollars in our first 30 days, organically, from that.
[00:26:30] How did Bucky's feel about that?
[00:26:32] Chris Kerner: They wanted us to make some key changes to the website.
[00:26:35] Chris Kerner: They wanted us to basically put disclaimers everywhere that said we are not Bucky's.
[00:26:40] Chris Kerner: We're not affiliated with Bucky's.
[00:26:42] Chris Kerner: They wanted us to change the name.
[00:26:43] Chris Kerner: They had the word beaver in the name.
[00:26:45] Chris Kerner: That's their mascot.
[00:26:46] Chris Kerner: They didn't want it to be confusing at all.
[00:26:49] Chris Kerner: So we made all those changes.
[00:26:51] Chris Kerner: And then we got the unofficial thumbs up from them.
[00:26:54] Chris Kerner: They said we're not going to sign anything, but you have our blessing.
[00:26:57] Chris Kerner: Have fun.
[00:26:58] Chris Kerner: And did that website make you a little money?
[00:27:00] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:27:02] Chris Kerner: It's been five years.
[00:27:02] Chris Kerner: We still own it.
[00:27:03] Chris Kerner: 100% of it.
[00:27:04] Chris Kerner: And it's going great.
[00:27:05] Chris Kerner: And it's made you millions.
[00:27:06] Chris Kerner: Huh?
[00:27:08] What can someone listening take from that in terms of applying that to their own life,
[00:27:15] Unknown Host: finding opportunities like that out in the world?
[00:27:16] Unknown Host: Or is that just a one and done?
[00:27:18] Unknown Host: Is there any one opportunity like that?
[00:27:20] Okay.
[00:27:21] Chris Kerner: So specific.
[00:27:22] Chris Kerner: I can ask that question a lot.
[00:27:23] Chris Kerner: How could someone do that with another brand?
[00:27:26] I don't know.
[00:27:27] Chris Kerner: If there was another brand out there like that, I would be doing it.
[00:27:31] Chris Kerner: Trader Joe's a similar, but they're very litigious.
[00:27:33] Chris Kerner: I think that was kind of lightning in a bottle for that particular experiment as in launching
[00:27:40] Chris Kerner: an online brand for an in-person business.
[00:27:42] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[00:27:43] Chris Kerner: But people should not be disheartened hearing that because on a macro level, like people
[00:27:49] Chris Kerner: should take their curious ideas very seriously.
[00:27:53] Chris Kerner: They need to shorten the amount of time spent between having the idea and doing something
[00:27:58] Chris Kerner: about that idea.
[00:27:59] Chris Kerner: What?
[00:28:00] Chris Kerner: Because that will strengthen their bias for action muscle.
[00:28:04] Chris Kerner: Right?
[00:28:05] Chris Kerner: We all have ideas.
[00:28:07] Chris Kerner: Some of them good, some of them bad on a regular basis.
[00:28:09] Chris Kerner: We usually don't do anything about it.
[00:28:11] Chris Kerner: It's just a passing thought.
[00:28:12] Chris Kerner: Whether it's a business idea or a hard conversation that you need to have with something, any idea,
[00:28:17] Chris Kerner: right?
[00:28:18] Chris Kerner: But the more we shrink the amount of time between doing something about that idea and having
[00:28:23] Chris Kerner: the idea, that idea, the more often we'll do that.
[00:28:26] Chris Kerner: And it becomes a self-perpetuating snowball that just compounds.
[00:28:31] Chris Kerner: And then before we know it, we'll get more ideas.
[00:28:33] Chris Kerner: We'll do more about those ideas.
[00:28:35] Chris Kerner: We'll be testing things.
[00:28:36] Chris Kerner: We'll be learning tools.
[00:28:37] Chris Kerner: We'll be experimenting and we'll have a whole portfolio of businesses.
[00:28:42] Is there something in your mentality or perspective there where you walk into a bucket and you
[00:28:45] Unknown Host: even think about how you could do something where as most people walk into a bucket and
[00:28:49] Unknown Host: buy their stuff and leave?
[00:28:50] Unknown Host: Is there something foundational in the way that you're looking at the world?
[00:28:53] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:28:54] Chris Kerner: But I don't think I'm any different.
[00:28:56] Chris Kerner: I think a lot of people have ideas like that.
[00:29:00] Chris Kerner: You walk into a bucket and you see something about something that could be improved.
[00:29:05] Chris Kerner: And people have these passing thoughts and they move on.
[00:29:08] Chris Kerner: I think that you become an expert at doing something about those ideas when you do something
[00:29:14] Chris Kerner: about those ideas.
[00:29:15] Chris Kerner: You get better at what you do, at what you test.
[00:29:18] Because you've built up some kind of muscle, which means that you don't really care about.
[00:29:22] Unknown Host: It seems failure as much as the average person.
[00:29:25] Unknown Host: And also in that particular case, the average person might think, well, I've got no experience
[00:29:30] Unknown Host: in doing that.
[00:29:32] No, no one has any experience in anything until they do it.
[00:29:35] Chris Kerner: Every expert started out as a beginner.
[00:29:40] Sometimes though, people try this and they learn, it doesn't give them energy.
[00:29:46] Chris Kerner: It's not for them.
[00:29:47] Chris Kerner: That's okay.
[00:29:48] Chris Kerner: Now when they have ideas, they can know, all right, box checked.
[00:29:52] That's not really for me that entrepreneurship thinks someone else needs to do that.
[00:29:55] Chris Kerner: Great.
[00:29:56] Chris Kerner: Good.
[00:29:57] Chris Kerner: All the power to them.
[00:29:58] Chris Kerner: I just want people to answer that question for themselves.
[00:30:01] Chris Kerner: I hate seeing regret in people's faces.
[00:30:04] Chris Kerner: Like I have friends that want to start a business they've always talked about.
[00:30:08] Chris Kerner: And I know they would be good at it.
[00:30:10] Chris Kerner: And I know it just eats them up.
[00:30:11] Chris Kerner: And they have really, really good ideas, objectively.
[00:30:14] Chris Kerner: And I just hate seeing them have that question for the rest of their lives.
[00:30:19] Chris Kerner: I just want them to taste entrepreneurship.
[00:30:24] Unknown Host: Is it for everybody though?
[00:30:25] Unknown Host: You can think of all your friends.
[00:30:27] Unknown Host: You can probably put them in groups of this person to show this person shouldn't.
[00:30:31] Unknown Host: And what defines who goes in which group?
[00:30:35] To me, it's how far they go in doing something about that idea.
[00:30:41] Because I will have friends that will text me ideas or talk to me about ideas.
[00:30:46] Chris Kerner: And then I never hear from them again about that thing.
[00:30:49] I don't worry about them.
[00:30:51] Right?
[00:30:52] Chris Kerner: I feel like there's a selection bias at play.
[00:30:54] Chris Kerner: Like if they really want to do something about it, they would get a little further down
[00:30:58] Chris Kerner: the line.
[00:30:59] Chris Kerner: They'd follow up with me.
[00:31:00] Chris Kerner: They'd say, yeah, I did this thing.
[00:31:01] Chris Kerner: Because I'll always give them tips and feedback.
[00:31:02] Chris Kerner: You should do this.
[00:31:03] Chris Kerner: You should try this.
[00:31:04] Chris Kerner: And they'll follow up.
[00:31:05] Chris Kerner: And then, you know, at some point along the line, it'll die.
[00:31:08] Chris Kerner: Right?
[00:31:09] Chris Kerner: But if they don't get any further than just telling me their idea, then I don't lose sleep
[00:31:15] Chris Kerner: over them.
[00:31:16] Chris Kerner: So it's kind of, it's kind of sort of self-selecting itself anyway.
[00:31:19] Unknown Host: It is.
[00:31:20] Unknown Host: Entrepreneurship.
[00:31:21] Unknown Host: But then I have other friends that are like they'll follow up, they'll follow up, they'll
[00:31:24] Chris Kerner: follow up, and then it dies.
[00:31:26] Chris Kerner: Which is okay.
[00:31:27] Chris Kerner: A lot of my ideas die too.
[00:31:29] Chris Kerner: And to me, that's the signal that it was supposed to die.
[00:31:30] Chris Kerner: Right?
[00:31:31] Chris Kerner: I'll just move on to the next thing.
[00:31:33] Chris Kerner: So it's those people that maybe I'm just biased and they look more like me, you know?
[00:31:39] Chris Kerner: Maybe that's not an accurate signal or not.
[00:31:41] Chris Kerner: But if they look more like me, then that's a signal that they should get further down
[00:31:45] Chris Kerner: the line and actually launch something that gets to revenue.
[00:31:48] Then you'll head think of one person you know that should never start a business.
[00:31:52] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[00:31:53] Why did you think of that person without telling me who they are?
[00:31:57] Because they make a lot of money at their job and they like their job well enough, they're
[00:32:05] Chris Kerner: not miserable.
[00:32:08] Chris Kerner: And they're in their late 40s and they probably feel like it would be too big of a risk
[00:32:13] Chris Kerner: to start something.
[00:32:14] Unknown Host: And do you objectively agree that it would be too big of a risk for them?
[00:32:16] Unknown Host: I do.
[00:32:17] Unknown Host: So you're looking at that on a risk reward basis thinking the reward doesn't outweigh
[00:32:21] Unknown Host: the risk here for you.
[00:32:22] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:32:23] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:32:24] Chris Kerner: Because people come to me like hoping that I'll encourage them to quit their job, right?
[00:32:27] Chris Kerner: Like begging me to do that without actually begging me.
[00:32:30] Chris Kerner: And I don't want to do that.
[00:32:31] Chris Kerner: Like I've never had to quit a job.
[00:32:34] Chris Kerner: Like I started with entrepreneurship, right?
[00:32:36] Chris Kerner: So the thought of being 48 with four kids, including my $400,000 a year job to test something,
[00:32:44] Chris Kerner: it just sounds crazy to me.
[00:32:46] On the other hand, think of one person you know that isn't an entrepreneur, but definitely
[00:32:50] Unknown Host: should be.
[00:32:51] Unknown Host: But you always think, why don't they do it?
[00:32:52] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:32:53] Why did you think of that person?
[00:32:55] Because it's a person that comes to me the most often with ideas and they're really,
[00:33:00] really good ideas.
[00:33:02] Chris Kerner: He's an engineer.
[00:33:04] Chris Kerner: And so he sees the world in that way.
[00:33:06] Chris Kerner: Engineers make great entrepreneurs.
[00:33:09] And he has a great work ethic.
[00:33:12] Chris Kerner: And he's like mid-career, but not so far along.
[00:33:15] Chris Kerner: And I know objectively that he's not, he's actually quite miserable in his job.
[00:33:21] Chris Kerner: And I hate that for him because I see the talent that's there.
[00:33:25] Chris Kerner: And I want him, like I think he would excel and I want to see that dream come true for
[00:33:30] Chris Kerner: him.
[00:33:31] Chris Kerner: Why isn't he doing it?
[00:33:33] I think it's insecurity.
[00:33:35] Chris Kerner: Fear.
[00:33:36] Yeah.
[00:33:37] Chris Kerner: Fear of.
[00:33:43] Chris Kerner: Really fear of just letting go of something certain that's provided his family a nice lifestyle.
[00:33:48] Chris Kerner: And not getting that back again ever.
[00:33:53] I think that insecurities are at the root of our best and our worst selves.
[00:33:58] Chris Kerner: And it can drive us to be our best or our worst selves, depending on how self-aware we are
[00:34:03] Chris Kerner: about those insecurities.
[00:34:06] Is that a little bit of a flaw in his thinking in your perspective?
[00:34:12] Unknown Host: Why is it you still, even though what he's saying there about, what you think he believes
[00:34:16] Unknown Host: there about security for his family is true, you still think he should, which suggests
[00:34:21] Unknown Host: that there's some kind of flaw you see and the way he's thinking about it.
[00:34:24] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:34:25] Chris Kerner: Because he doesn't have to quit his job.
[00:34:30] Chris Kerner: There's enough time in the day to do this on the nights and weekends, to do enough of
[00:34:35] Chris Kerner: it to really prove itself out.
[00:34:37] Chris Kerner: Sometimes like whatever our side hustle is, it has a very low ceiling if we're only working
[00:34:46] Chris Kerner: on it after hours, right?
[00:34:50] Chris Kerner: Let's say we're spending 20 hours a week on a side hustle and it makes us $50,000 a year.
[00:34:56] Chris Kerner: But our job pays us $200,000 a year when we spend 40 hours a week on that.
[00:35:00] Chris Kerner: One thing that I've noticed, which is kind of contradictory to how I feel about quitting
[00:35:04] Chris Kerner: something, is when we go from 20 hours a week on the $50,000 a year side hustle to 40
[00:35:12] Chris Kerner: hours a week and we quit the full time thing, that $50,000 a year goes to $500,000, right?
[00:35:18] Chris Kerner: We double the amount of hours, but we tend times the amount of money that comes from it.
[00:35:23] Chris Kerner: Because of the fact that we burn the boats, that it has to work, I just, I don't want people
[00:35:27] Chris Kerner: to burn the boats too soon, right?
[00:35:30] Chris Kerner: Like there has to be a pathway.
[00:35:32] Chris Kerner: Let's say our Facebook ads are converting really well.
[00:35:34] Chris Kerner: We've tested scaling it and they're profitable and we know what that would look like.
[00:35:39] Chris Kerner: But if we scale it, then we're going to have more customer service complaints.
[00:35:41] Chris Kerner: We're going to have to do more architecture of the website.
[00:35:44] Chris Kerner: But we see a path to scaling and it's already profitable.
[00:35:48] Chris Kerner: We know that probably my boss will take me back.
[00:35:51] Chris Kerner: We have these safety nets.
[00:35:55] Chris Kerner: That's the perfect time to really burn the boats.
[00:35:58] Chris Kerner: Not when we have an idea or we've tested it a little bit, but not thoroughly.
[00:36:02] Chris Kerner: Just too soon, in my opinion.
[00:36:03] Chris Kerner: By burning the boats, you mean the analogy of some of the wartime leaders who would pull
[00:36:07] Unknown Host: up on an island that they were invading and burn the boats so that they had no plan B?
[00:36:12] Unknown Host: Exactly, yeah, to quit.
[00:36:13] Do you think that really matters the whole idea of a plan B?
[00:36:17] Do you think people should have a plan B when they embark on entrepreneurship?
[00:36:22] Can I contradict myself?
[00:36:23] Chris Kerner: 100%.
[00:36:24] Chris Kerner: All right.
[00:36:25] So the rational Chris, the Chris with four kids says absolutely.
[00:36:30] Chris Kerner: You got to be a dad.
[00:36:31] Chris Kerner: You got to be a husband.
[00:36:32] Chris Kerner: You got to provide for your family, right?
[00:36:34] And again, there's so many tools out there for testing, for scaling, for outsourcing.
[00:36:39] Chris Kerner: We can find a business partner to help pick up the slack.
[00:36:41] Chris Kerner: We can use our kids.
[00:36:42] Chris Kerner: We can use our spouse, whatever.
[00:36:43] Chris Kerner: There's so many ways to really vet something out before quitting that we don't have to quit.
[00:36:48] But on the other side of my mouth, there's been two times in my entrepreneurial career
[00:36:55] Chris Kerner: when someone burned the boats for me, right?
[00:36:59] Chris Kerner: I pull up to an island and it's like, I've got my plan B.
[00:37:02] Chris Kerner: I'm testing this business.
[00:37:03] Chris Kerner: This business is profitable.
[00:37:04] Chris Kerner: It's paying the bills.
[00:37:06] Chris Kerner: And then someone else, the middle of the night, they snuck out, they burned my boats.
[00:37:11] Chris Kerner: I wake up and I'm like, whoa, where's my plan B?
[00:37:13] Chris Kerner: I wasn't ready to burn those boats yet.
[00:37:17] Chris Kerner: And plan A, just freaking, thrives, right?
[00:37:22] Chris Kerner: And it's not so much because of the fact that I don't have a safety net anymore, but
[00:37:26] Chris Kerner: it's because that event put a chip on my shoulder that makes me want to prove those bad guys
[00:37:32] Chris Kerner: wrong, right?
[00:37:33] Chris Kerner: To oversimplify.
[00:37:34] Chris Kerner: Those guys that burn my boat.
[00:37:35] Chris Kerner: Toxic motivation.
[00:37:36] Unknown Host: Exactly.
[00:37:37] Chris Kerner: That's a good way to put it.
[00:37:39] Chris Kerner: To show them, I didn't need those boats.
[00:37:41] Chris Kerner: I'm not going back, right?
[00:37:43] Chris Kerner: This island is better than where I came from.
[00:37:45] I remember reading about a study on plan B's where they got a group of students, two
[00:37:49] Unknown Host: groups, and then they told them to do a puzzle to win a treat.
[00:37:53] Unknown Host: And then in one of the groups, they told them that they could get this treat out of
[00:37:57] Unknown Host: them, machine down the hallway if they wanted it after.
[00:38:00] Unknown Host: And the group that didn't understand, they could get the same reward from a plan B,
[00:38:06] Unknown Host: worked significantly harder to complete that puzzle.
[00:38:09] Unknown Host: So there's something in the human psyche of, when you know that you could get the reward
[00:38:14] in another way, when you have a plan B, we work less hard at the plan A.
[00:38:19] Unknown Host: How does that?
[00:38:20] Unknown Host: Logically, maybe we should, you know, my practical and unresponsible, remove the plan B from
[00:38:27] Unknown Host: our mind.
[00:38:28] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:38:29] Yeah, I just like, I can't think of any stories from people in my sphere of influence
[00:38:34] Chris Kerner: that have tested something, quit the plan A, and then plan B just failed.
[00:38:42] Chris Kerner: And like they just lost everything.
[00:38:44] Chris Kerner: Like surely that's happened, right?
[00:38:46] Chris Kerner: It does happen when people like prematurely quit.
[00:38:49] Chris Kerner: But in my experience, it just, it doesn't happen.
[00:38:52] Chris Kerner: Like it has the opposite effect.
[00:38:54] Chris Kerner: It becomes this huge motivating factor.
[00:38:56] Chris Kerner: And when they quit, I ask them, like, how do you feel?
[00:38:59] Chris Kerner: Are you freaking out?
[00:39:01] And it's always, always, I'm so excited right now.
[00:39:05] Chris Kerner: Like I'm going to go all in on this.
[00:39:07] Like this has to work.
[00:39:08] Chris Kerner: And it does.
[00:39:09] Chris Kerner: It just does.
[00:39:10] A lot of people are looking for passive income from side hustles.
[00:39:14] Unknown Host: Now I wondered what your your opinion was on passive income, because it's a word that
[00:39:17] Unknown Host: comes up so often in the comment section of this channel.
[00:39:20] Unknown Host: But when we're doing sort of sentiment analysis and what people are, what they're interested
[00:39:24] Unknown Host: in passive income seems to be a bit of a buzz word.
[00:39:26] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:39:27] Chris Kerner: It's the silver bullet, right?
[00:39:29] Chris Kerner: It's like, it's the, it's the financial ozempic, you could say.
[00:39:33] Chris Kerner: What is passive income?
[00:39:34] Chris Kerner: How would one define that?
[00:39:36] I would define it as income that you receive that you don't have to continually put effort
[00:39:42] Chris Kerner: towards.
[00:39:44] Buying treasuries, earning 4% on your money and you don't do anything and you just get paid.
[00:39:50] And it's very hard to find, especially early on.
[00:39:53] Chris Kerner: Like we have to be willing to create active income, sweaty income, ugly income, like by
[00:39:59] Chris Kerner: whatever means necessary.
[00:40:01] Chris Kerner: And the more we do that, the longer we do that, the more realistic, true passive income
[00:40:06] Chris Kerner: actually is.
[00:40:09] Sweaty, ugly income.
[00:40:10] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:40:11] Chris Kerner: Give me an example of some sweaty, ugly income that anyone listening right now could
[00:40:16] Unknown Host: create.
[00:40:17] Unknown Host: What are your favorite examples of non-obvious businesses that people have started that
[00:40:20] Unknown Host: have resulted in passive, sweaty, ugly income?
[00:40:22] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:40:23] Chris Kerner: I mean, most things that I've started have been just that.
[00:40:28] Chris Kerner: I had a, a concierge car buying business.
[00:40:32] Chris Kerner: A concierge car buying business.
[00:40:34] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:40:35] Chris Kerner: What's that?
[00:40:36] Chris Kerner: So picture a traditional car dealership, a used car dealership.
[00:40:38] Chris Kerner: You got to get your dealers permit that enables you legally to go to the auctions and buy
[00:40:43] Chris Kerner: cars at wholesale, put them on your lot and sell them.
[00:40:45] Chris Kerner: So I did all the regulatory stuff.
[00:40:47] Chris Kerner: I got my dealers permit, but then I would go to individuals and they would say, I want
[00:40:52] Chris Kerner: a 2024 Sequoia.
[00:40:54] Chris Kerner: I wanted to be blue under 30,000 miles and I would just go to the auction and buy for them
[00:40:58] Chris Kerner: for like $700 fee.
[00:41:00] Chris Kerner: So they get wholesale, they save money.
[00:41:02] Chris Kerner: I make money.
[00:41:03] Chris Kerner: I don't have to bear the inventory risk and I can buy exactly what they want.
[00:41:08] That sounds great, right?
[00:41:09] Chris Kerner: On paper, people do that business successfully.
[00:41:11] Chris Kerner: I didn't invent it.
[00:41:12] Chris Kerner: I copied it, right?
[00:41:13] Chris Kerner: I hated it.
[00:41:14] Chris Kerner: I was breaking down on the side of the road driving these things back from the auction.
[00:41:18] Chris Kerner: I'm not a car guy.
[00:41:19] Chris Kerner: I don't care about cars.
[00:41:20] Chris Kerner: I don't work on cars.
[00:41:21] Chris Kerner: It's not my passion.
[00:41:23] Chris Kerner: That was ugly.
[00:41:24] Chris Kerner: It was hot in Texas.
[00:41:25] Chris Kerner: I was standing out on the black top.
[00:41:27] Chris Kerner: I was making money.
[00:41:28] Chris Kerner: It was profitable.
[00:41:29] Chris Kerner: And I got to the point where I just like quit it.
[00:41:32] Chris Kerner: I just shut it down, moved on to something else.
[00:41:35] Chris Kerner: That was very active.
[00:41:37] Chris Kerner: It was not scalable on the surface.
[00:41:39] Chris Kerner: It was ugly.
[00:41:40] Chris Kerner: I hated it.
[00:41:41] Chris Kerner: And so I pivoted because I had a plan B.
[00:41:43] Chris Kerner: I didn't have to do that, right?
[00:41:45] Chris Kerner: That's one example.
[00:41:47] Chris Kerner: If someone likes cars, it's actually a great business.
[00:41:50] Chris Kerner: Like I know a gentleman in Alabama that makes a lot of money doing that, right?
[00:41:53] Chris Kerner: For me, it was not great.
[00:41:55] Chris Kerner: So how important is passion in this equation?
[00:41:58] Unknown Host: How important it is for you to love the thing to be successful at it in your view?
[00:42:02] I think you need to fall in love with business, with commerce.
[00:42:05] Chris Kerner: And if you can love entrepreneurship, turning $1 into 2, and that, like if you could focus
[00:42:10] Chris Kerner: on that being your passion, then anything that falls underneath that you should win at,
[00:42:16] Chris Kerner: right?
[00:42:17] Chris Kerner: But I like to say, follow the profit, P-R-O-F-I-T, until you can afford to follow your
[00:42:25] Chris Kerner: passion, right?
[00:42:26] Chris Kerner: Because if we're trying to follow our passion from day one, we're probably not if we're
[00:42:31] Chris Kerner: going to get there because the statistical likelihood that what we love and what makes
[00:42:35] Chris Kerner: us money overlaps in the beginning is almost zero.
[00:42:39] Chris Kerner: So ignore passion for a time, try to build your passion around commerce, and then start
[00:42:46] Chris Kerner: anything.
[00:42:47] Chris Kerner: And then once you're able to have more passive income, then start things that you're passionate
[00:42:52] Chris Kerner: about, like in the actual industry that you're passionate about.
[00:42:57] Unknown Host: Persistence.
[00:42:58] Persistence is obviously going to create repetitions to understand the problem, to learn more,
[00:43:03] Unknown Host: to, you know.
[00:43:04] Unknown Host: So I want to, as it relates to passion and persistence, they seem sort of instrichably
[00:43:09] Unknown Host: linked, something I'm more passionate about, I'm more likely to continue at even when
[00:43:13] Unknown Host: the rules don't show up.
[00:43:14] Unknown Host: Yeah, like my car business, right?
[00:43:17] Chris Kerner: I know passion for cars.
[00:43:18] Chris Kerner: And I had another business that was doing great.
[00:43:21] Chris Kerner: So I abandoned that.
[00:43:23] Chris Kerner: But people think that like, people sometimes look at themselves as lazy, or they're not
[00:43:29] Chris Kerner: a hard worker.
[00:43:30] Chris Kerner: And so they're just, they're not confident that they could do this.
[00:43:34] Chris Kerner: But there's like everyone is a hard worker.
[00:43:37] Chris Kerner: Everyone on this planet has the same DNA that enables them to work hard.
[00:43:41] Chris Kerner: But the problem is what they're working on probably gives them no energy, right?
[00:43:45] Chris Kerner: They're probably not passionate about it.
[00:43:47] Chris Kerner: So what am I passionate about?
[00:43:49] Chris Kerner: Well, you've got to, you've got to test everything.
[00:43:50] Chris Kerner: We have to try new things.
[00:43:51] Chris Kerner: We have to take that curious question and turn it into a business.
[00:43:55] Chris Kerner: Maybe that's fun.
[00:43:56] Chris Kerner: Maybe it's not, right?
[00:43:57] Chris Kerner: So I'm not going to ask you about the purpose area for finding what our passions actually
[00:44:00] Chris Kerner: are because we might think that like, like I love woodworking, right?
[00:44:03] Chris Kerner: I don't have to build a business around that because I love business, right?
[00:44:06] Chris Kerner: So I can build a business around anything.
[00:44:08] Chris Kerner: But if I got super hung up on like, I cannot make a profit from this woodworking business,
[00:44:13] Chris Kerner: then I would fail it entrepreneurship if I started there, right?
[00:44:16] Chris Kerner: Whereas if I approach this from the angle of, all right, I like woodworking.
[00:44:21] Chris Kerner: What else do I like?
[00:44:23] Chris Kerner: Maybe I like running.
[00:44:24] Chris Kerner: Maybe I like cooking.
[00:44:25] Chris Kerner: Maybe I like short form videos.
[00:44:27] Chris Kerner: And I just start trying all those new things.
[00:44:29] Chris Kerner: And eventually, I'm going to have enough surface area for testing that I'm going to find
[00:44:33] Chris Kerner: things where, if you heard of the eQ guy principle, right?
[00:44:38] Chris Kerner: So what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can charge for,
[00:44:44] Chris Kerner: right?
[00:44:45] Chris Kerner: The overlap of that is the sweet spot.
[00:44:47] Chris Kerner: That's what's scalable.
[00:44:48] Chris Kerner: That's what you can do until you die.
[00:44:50] Chris Kerner: But if you get super hung up on that on day one, like I'm just not passionate about that.
[00:44:54] Chris Kerner: Like you're never going to find it.
[00:44:55] Chris Kerner: Like you're going to be in that job forever.
[00:44:57] My career follows the same, same mark, which is I tried tons of things.
[00:45:00] Unknown Host: And then I built this marketing business, and then that became more of a product business
[00:45:05] Unknown Host: and grew.
[00:45:06] Unknown Host: And I didn't love it.
[00:45:07] Unknown Host: Like it wasn't my passion to do, to help Coca-Cola, some will cancel Coca-Cola, or like,
[00:45:12] you know, Uber sell more, Uber's necessarily.
[00:45:14] Unknown Host: That wasn't like my passionate life.
[00:45:16] Unknown Host: However, it taught me a bunch of skills, which then in, when I quit that business and
[00:45:20] Unknown Host: I spent some time in psychedelics, DJing, building software, web through you name it.
[00:45:25] Unknown Host: I came out on the other side and could ask myself that, I could go question, which is,
[00:45:28] Unknown Host: of all the things that I have tried, what is the thing that I would do, like really irrespective
[00:45:32] Unknown Host: of money?
[00:45:33] Unknown Host: Now I had that luxury to do that.
[00:45:34] Unknown Host: And actually, in 2020, the answer was this.
[00:45:37] Unknown Host: Like, this was the answer.
[00:45:39] Unknown Host: This answer was, I literally moved to London from New York and found a place without viewing
[00:45:44] Unknown Host: it properly that looked like this because I thought this would be a good podcast set, and
[00:45:48] Unknown Host: moved into that place called Jack and then we started about five years ago doing this
[00:45:54] Unknown Host: weekly.
[00:45:56] Unknown Host: And it's become a business off the back of it.
[00:45:58] Yeah.
[00:45:59] Unknown Host: But I didn't have that luxury to start.
[00:46:00] Unknown Host: If I tried that from day one, I wouldn't have had either skills to know how to scale an
[00:46:03] Unknown Host: audience.
[00:46:04] Unknown Host: I wouldn't have had the flexibility to buy all these cameras, which was like 50 grand
[00:46:09] Unknown Host: or whatever at the start.
[00:46:11] Unknown Host: So I do think some people sometimes get that inverted.
[00:46:14] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:46:15] Chris Kerner: And you're not distracted anymore, right?
[00:46:16] Chris Kerner: You're not looking for the next DJ thing or like found it.
[00:46:20] Chris Kerner: You're here, right?
[00:46:21] Chris Kerner: Now you're focused on scaling this.
[00:46:22] Chris Kerner: Like, people get so hung up on focus or lack thereof and they just beat themselves up
[00:46:27] Chris Kerner: over it.
[00:46:28] Chris Kerner: But in my experience, like a lack of focus is a signal that there's something else out
[00:46:33] Chris Kerner: there, right?
[00:46:34] Chris Kerner: That maybe we shouldn't be focusing on that thing because you've probably worked on things
[00:46:38] Chris Kerner: that had perfect product market fit and we're just crushing.
[00:46:41] Chris Kerner: And you weren't thinking about starting a DJing business at that point, right?
[00:46:45] Chris Kerner: You were all in on this one thing.
[00:46:47] Chris Kerner: But and the times when you were working on something, you're like, maybe I'll try this,
[00:46:49] Chris Kerner: maybe I'll try this and you beat yourself up.
[00:46:51] Chris Kerner: You're like, focus, focus, focus.
[00:46:53] Chris Kerner: Let's actually pay attention to those signals.
[00:46:56] Chris Kerner: Why am I distracted from this thing?
[00:46:58] So that's, I don't know if that's just me coping with my own ADHD or if that's actually
[00:47:03] Chris Kerner: a true principle, but I try to lend some credence to those signals of distraction that I get
[00:47:09] Chris Kerner: on a regular basis.
[00:47:10] Chris Kerner: Yeah, I have a Sunday shelf, which is just a digital board on my Monday board where,
[00:47:17] Unknown Host: when I have ideas that like captivate me at 11 p.m. at night one night instead of trying
[00:47:21] Unknown Host: to act on them immediately because I think in some respects like you, I put it on the
[00:47:24] Unknown Host: Sunday shelf and I wait and see.
[00:47:28] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:47:29] Unknown Host: I wait and see how much it pulls at me to come with the shelf.
[00:47:32] And then sometimes it comes off the shelf, I get a little bit of a way down, I discover
[00:47:35] Unknown Host: that actually there's something I didn't realize and then I quit.
[00:47:37] Unknown Host: And then there's this, you know, when you think about the, like, the excitement arc of
[00:47:41] Unknown Host: a new idea, you have the, like, initial surge of excitement, like this is the best thing
[00:47:44] Unknown Host: ever.
[00:47:45] Unknown Host: I'm going to become a billionaire, wise no one ever thought of this before.
[00:47:47] Unknown Host: And then you kind of get into it and you get into that sort of valley of, or fuck, this
[00:47:51] Unknown Host: is a terrible idea.
[00:47:52] Unknown Host: I'm an idiot.
[00:47:53] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:47:54] Unknown Host: If I can come out of that valley, if something pulls me up out of that valley, then I think
[00:47:57] Unknown Host: it's worth pursuing.
[00:47:58] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:47:59] Chris Kerner: That's a good way of looking at it.
[00:48:00] Chris Kerner: The valley of despair or something.
[00:48:02] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:48:03] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:48:04] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:48:05] Do you follow a similar sort of path with an idea, your ideas?
[00:48:09] It's funny because I, my kind of framework is, if I have an idea, am I thinking about
[00:48:16] Chris Kerner: it still two weeks later?
[00:48:18] Chris Kerner: For whatever reason, that's just my timeline, two weeks.
[00:48:21] Chris Kerner: I had an idea yesterday and I was at the airport.
[00:48:24] Chris Kerner: I was excited about it and I was doing research.
[00:48:26] Chris Kerner: I feel like forgot about it, right?
[00:48:29] Chris Kerner: Who cares, you know?
[00:48:30] Chris Kerner: But I have ideas where I just cannot get it out of my head and I'll see something out
[00:48:33] Chris Kerner: there in the world that adds to the idea and I tell my friend about it and I send these
[00:48:38] Chris Kerner: manic voicemails or these manic voice notes to my friends about it.
[00:48:42] Chris Kerner: And I'm still thinking about it two weeks later.
[00:48:44] Chris Kerner: That's my signal that there's actually something here.
[00:48:49] Use the word validating early run when you're talking about these ideas.
[00:48:53] Unknown Host: And I think this is something that could really, really help a lot of people who have a lot
[00:48:57] Unknown Host: of ideas is this idea of trying to validate your ideas as fast as possible.
[00:49:02] Unknown Host: How might one validate an idea?
[00:49:03] Unknown Host: Can you give me an example of an idea that you have validated?
[00:49:06] Unknown Host: What does validation mean?
[00:49:07] Unknown Host: Yeah, so I like to see people get joy from my product or service, right?
[00:49:15] Chris Kerner: Not just like, oh, it's good.
[00:49:16] Chris Kerner: Like, let's say I'm selling a food product.
[00:49:17] Chris Kerner: It's taste good.
[00:49:18] Chris Kerner: It's good.
[00:49:19] Okay.
[00:49:20] People might buy this, but I'm not going to have product market fit.
[00:49:24] Chris Kerner: I'm going to be pushing a boulder up the hill, right?
[00:49:26] Chris Kerner: But if people are like, oh my gosh, this is the best thing I've ever had.
[00:49:31] Chris Kerner: Where did you make this?
[00:49:32] Chris Kerner: How did you make this?
[00:49:33] Chris Kerner: Up in their face, that's an example of a validation in my case, right?
[00:49:38] Chris Kerner: Same industry, food product, completely different reactions, right?
[00:49:43] Chris Kerner: So one specific example is my wife has a cookie bar business, right?
[00:49:51] Chris Kerner: Square cookies.
[00:49:53] Chris Kerner: And they're amazing.
[00:49:54] Chris Kerner: And we're not trying to scale it.
[00:49:56] Chris Kerner: We don't want to scale it.
[00:49:57] Chris Kerner: It's a way to teach our kids entrepreneurship.
[00:49:58] Chris Kerner: And we love it.
[00:49:59] Chris Kerner: But the best way to validate this was going to our local farmers market and just posting
[00:50:05] Chris Kerner: up and just giving people samples and just watching them, right?
[00:50:09] Chris Kerner: What do they say versus how do they react?
[00:50:12] Chris Kerner: And is it the same?
[00:50:13] Chris Kerner: What do you mean by that?
[00:50:14] Unknown Host: Well, sometimes we try to use the internet in places where it's not needful, right?
[00:50:19] Chris Kerner: She sold these online, right?
[00:50:21] Chris Kerner: She shipped them friends family across the country.
[00:50:23] Chris Kerner: They're like, they're great.
[00:50:24] Chris Kerner: We love them.
[00:50:25] Chris Kerner: Okay, I didn't see you eat it.
[00:50:26] Chris Kerner: I don't know how you actually love it.
[00:50:27] Chris Kerner: Are you saying that because you're my mom, right?
[00:50:30] Chris Kerner: Or you're my friend.
[00:50:31] Chris Kerner: But when you solicit feedback on your product or service in person, even if it's like an
[00:50:36] Chris Kerner: internet tool or an app in person makes all the difference.
[00:50:39] Chris Kerner: You want to take note of what they say and take note of their body language and how they
[00:50:44] Chris Kerner: react when they experience your product or service, right?
[00:50:48] Chris Kerner: And if all three of those things overlap, then either they're a psychopath and they're
[00:50:53] Chris Kerner: just lying for no good reason or you have something really special on your hands.
[00:50:58] Chris Kerner: So that's what we did with her cookie bar business and they love it.
[00:51:02] Chris Kerner: And you can do that with any business.
[00:51:03] Chris Kerner: It doesn't have to be food.
[00:51:05] What does a validation mean?
[00:51:07] Unknown Host: It's checking if the market gives a fuck about the thing you're making as fast as you can.
[00:51:11] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:51:12] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:51:13] Chris Kerner: I like to kind of picture a, you know, a boulder up a hill, right?
[00:51:18] Chris Kerner: And most people in their businesses, even businesses that are working, there are two
[00:51:22] Chris Kerner: steps forward, one step back, two steps forward, one step back.
[00:51:25] Chris Kerner: And that's okay.
[00:51:26] Chris Kerner: Like that's not a bad thing.
[00:51:28] Chris Kerner: But in my experience, 5% of the time, I'll have a business where the boulder is chasing
[00:51:33] Chris Kerner: me.
[00:51:34] Chris Kerner: Like I'm trying to not die because this boulder is chasing me down a hill.
[00:51:38] Chris Kerner: And that boulder in this case represents customers, demand, right?
[00:51:41] Chris Kerner: Like I can't sleep because I'm fulfilling orders.
[00:51:44] Chris Kerner: I'm answering emails like I'm not getting distracted by the next shiny object.
[00:51:49] Chris Kerner: That is validation.
[00:51:50] Chris Kerner: That's product market fit in my experience.
[00:51:53] Chris Kerner: You don't have to have that to launch.
[00:51:54] Chris Kerner: I don't want people to misunderstand.
[00:51:57] Chris Kerner: But if you have that, like you have something very special and you need to go all in on
[00:52:00] Chris Kerner: that thing.
[00:52:01] Chris Kerner: There was a book published several years ago called The Lean Startup, which talks about
[00:52:06] Unknown Host: this idea of just like testing an MVP as quickly as you possibly can.
[00:52:11] Can you explain that to the audience who probably have ideas, but in their head of thinking,
[00:52:15] Unknown Host: well, I've got to quit my job.
[00:52:16] Unknown Host: I'm going to have to raise money.
[00:52:18] Unknown Host: I'm going to have to spend two to three years building something to figure out if this
[00:52:21] Unknown Host: is a good idea or not.
[00:52:22] Unknown Host: What is the alternative approach that you adopt when you're trying to stress that some
[00:52:25] Unknown Host: idea quickly?
[00:52:26] Yeah.
[00:52:27] Chris Kerner: So if I had to pick one tool, I mean, it's one that one and four humans use every day.
[00:52:32] Chris Kerner: And it's Facebook, right?
[00:52:34] Chris Kerner: You've got Facebook groups.
[00:52:36] Chris Kerner: You've got WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook marketplace, Facebook pages, Facebook ads, right?
[00:52:43] Chris Kerner: Let's just say there's six different meta products, Facebook products.
[00:52:46] Chris Kerner: Everything you need right there, right?
[00:52:49] Chris Kerner: Why don't you give me an example of just a random business and I'll tell you or the
[00:52:54] Chris Kerner: audience how they could validate that with a Facebook product.
[00:52:58] Okay.
[00:52:59] Unknown Host: I'm thinking of starting a creatine brand for women that makes creatine taste good.
[00:53:14] Okay.
[00:53:16] Are we talking powder gummy?
[00:53:17] Chris Kerner: What form factor?
[00:53:18] Chris Kerner: I did not.
[00:53:19] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[00:53:20] Chris Kerner: Well, let's try both.
[00:53:21] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[00:53:22] Chris Kerner: So I'm going to do something that seems very non-obvious and probably won't work, but it's
[00:53:26] Chris Kerner: the lowest amount of friction.
[00:53:27] Chris Kerner: I'm going to take a description for that and I'm going to use nano-banana, G-G-G-P-T,
[00:53:32] Chris Kerner: any of the AI image generators to come up with what the product could look like, right?
[00:53:37] Chris Kerner: In both a gummy form and a powder form.
[00:53:39] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[00:53:40] Chris Kerner: Then I'm going to go to Facebook marketplace.
[00:53:41] Chris Kerner: You're just going to post a foot.
[00:53:43] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[00:53:44] Chris Kerner: I'm just going to say like, women's creatine brand actually tastes good, right?
[00:53:48] Chris Kerner: Did you know that creatine improves cognitive function or whatever?
[00:53:51] Chris Kerner: Just your standard pitch.
[00:53:52] Chris Kerner: I could even use AI to generate it.
[00:53:54] Chris Kerner: It doesn't really matter at this point.
[00:53:55] Chris Kerner: I'm going to post it to Facebook marketplace simply because that's the lowest amount of
[00:53:59] Chris Kerner: friction to get some level of validation or not, right?
[00:54:03] Chris Kerner: Because in my experience, focus is overrated and momentum is underrated.
[00:54:10] Chris Kerner: And so you could have told me any idea.
[00:54:13] Chris Kerner: And my first step that I tell you to do is going to be something very, very low friction
[00:54:17] Chris Kerner: because I want you to get something back from the world, right?
[00:54:21] Chris Kerner: Because the most likely way to sell that product is with meta ads, right?
[00:54:24] Chris Kerner: But there's a lot of friction there.
[00:54:26] Chris Kerner: Like it's hard to use.
[00:54:28] Chris Kerner: So you're going to be like, okay, you're going to go chat with you, how do I use meta-ads?
[00:54:31] Chris Kerner: And then you're going to burn out and you're going to have, be honest, something else
[00:54:33] Chris Kerner: bad tomorrow.
[00:54:34] Chris Kerner: But that might be an amazing idea, right?
[00:54:36] Chris Kerner: So I'm going to tell you to go to Facebook marketplace, even though people don't sell creatine
[00:54:39] Chris Kerner: on Facebook marketplace.
[00:54:41] Chris Kerner: And then we're going to see, you know, Facebook gives us like three stats when you post
[00:54:45] Chris Kerner: something to Facebook marketplace.
[00:54:47] Chris Kerner: Clicks and then how many people that reach out and then how many views, okay?
[00:54:52] Chris Kerner: So I'm going to post one Facebook marketplace ad for the gummies, different picture.
[00:54:57] Chris Kerner: It'll look like gummies.
[00:55:00] Chris Kerner: Basically same headlines, same benefits, same description, post to Facebook in the same
[00:55:04] Chris Kerner: local market with the same radius.
[00:55:06] Chris Kerner: Don't want to change any variables.
[00:55:08] Chris Kerner: And then I'm going to open a Google sheet and I'm going to say how many views, how many
[00:55:12] Chris Kerner: clicks, how many messages for that.
[00:55:15] Chris Kerner: Then I'm going to do the same thing.
[00:55:16] Chris Kerner: Take the same features, the same benefits, different picture because this one's powder,
[00:55:20] Chris Kerner: post it in the same market with the same radius to Facebook marketplace and have a new
[00:55:23] Chris Kerner: column, views reach out and clicks, right?
[00:55:29] Chris Kerner: And then I'm going to watch and I'm going to see what's getting more clicks.
[00:55:33] Chris Kerner: And I'm going to know within two hours where there's more demand.
[00:55:37] Chris Kerner: Now does that little sample size indicate like what form factor I should go all in on?
[00:55:42] Chris Kerner: Not necessarily, but it's something.
[00:55:43] Chris Kerner: It's a relevant data point, right?
[00:55:45] Chris Kerner: There's not very likely to be a large amount of people searching for creating gummies on
[00:55:49] Chris Kerner: Facebook marketplace, but it doesn't matter because there's 2 billion people using it,
[00:55:52] Chris Kerner: right?
[00:55:53] Chris Kerner: So we're just trying to capture some of that traffic.
[00:55:56] Chris Kerner: So I'm going to do that with two ads and then after a day or two, I'm going to boost
[00:56:01] Chris Kerner: those two ads, put $10 behind each of them to see how my results differ.
[00:56:07] Chris Kerner: Does it make any difference?
[00:56:08] Chris Kerner: Do I get a lot more clicks, a lot more views?
[00:56:09] Chris Kerner: Or is it just wasted?
[00:56:11] Chris Kerner: And then I'm going to, I'm going to probably post like 10 more ads of like different photos,
[00:56:17] Chris Kerner: different headings, different descriptions, different price points, and then put all
[00:56:21] Chris Kerner: those in a Google sheet and track it.
[00:56:23] Chris Kerner: All right, now I have a lot of data.
[00:56:25] Now concurrently, so while I'm doing all these things, I'm going to go to Facebook Groups
[00:56:30] Chris Kerner: and I'm going to join Facebook Groups like Mom's who work out, Mom's who love creatine,
[00:56:36] Chris Kerner: Mom's who love rocking ultra runner moms like healthy moms, whatever.
[00:56:40] Chris Kerner: I'm going to join all these groups and just start doing searches for creatine, gummies,
[00:56:44] Chris Kerner: powders, price points, vendors, websites, and just start like pulling pieces of data out
[00:56:51] Chris Kerner: of the atmosphere, right?
[00:56:53] Chris Kerner: And I'm going to put that in my spreadsheet.
[00:56:55] Chris Kerner: And I want to wait till the Facebook Marketplace test are done.
[00:56:57] Chris Kerner: I want to do that at the same time.
[00:56:58] Chris Kerner: Then I'm going to start learning Facebook ads because everything I've told you to do
[00:57:02] Chris Kerner: so far takes like two hours.
[00:57:04] Chris Kerner: Let's say we have an afternoon to dedicate to this, right?
[00:57:06] Chris Kerner: Then I'm going to learn Facebook ads and I'm going to watch a YouTube video about, you
[00:57:09] Chris Kerner: know, how to get Facebook ads up in 10 minutes.
[00:57:12] Chris Kerner: How important is it to understand Facebook ads and how long would it take me to get a
[00:57:16] Unknown Host: sufficient understanding of Facebook ads?
[00:57:19] Chris Kerner: You could be proficient in a couple days.
[00:57:23] Chris Kerner: If you had like one thing to sell and you just wanted to go all in on that thing and
[00:57:27] Chris Kerner: you actually learned by launching ads and not just learning, not just endlessly watching
[00:57:31] Chris Kerner: YouTube videos.
[00:57:32] Chris Kerner: You could be fairly proficient within a couple days easily.
[00:57:37] Do you think that's the skill everybody should have?
[00:57:39] Absolutely.
[00:57:40] I mean, Facebook ads are like the infinite money glitch.
[00:57:43] Chris Kerner: It's just like a magic money machine.
[00:57:46] Chris Kerner: It's the reason they're a trillion dollar company.
[00:57:49] It's like a cheat code.
[00:57:50] Chris Kerner: Yeah, we should know Facebook ads like we know how to write emails.
[00:57:54] Chris Kerner: We should know Facebook ads like we know how to build websites or to do anything.
[00:57:58] Chris Kerner: It should be foundational.
[00:58:03] Oh, now many people actually have that skill.
[00:58:06] Chris Kerner: Very few.
[00:58:07] Chris Kerner: That's why there's so many ad agencies charging a lot of money.
[00:58:10] And then so you've got the data back in your spreadsheet on this creating situation.
[00:58:14] Unknown Host: How do you then make a decision whether this is something worth pursuing?
[00:58:17] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[00:58:18] Chris Kerner: Then I would go find like a co-packer.
[00:58:21] Chris Kerner: That's a co-packer.
[00:58:22] Chris Kerner: It's a company that will take my idea and put it into a physical form, right?
[00:58:28] Chris Kerner: I'd find like a supplement company that can actually make this.
[00:58:31] Chris Kerner: And I would tell it roughly like what I'm thinking and then ask for samples.
[00:58:35] Chris Kerner: And then I would use those samples to go get feedback from people in person, right?
[00:58:40] Chris Kerner: But I wouldn't get those samples until I got feedback from all these Facebook tests telling
[00:58:43] Chris Kerner: me what form factor, what price point, what color, what flavor, et cetera.
[00:58:48] Chris Kerner: And then I would go to a farmer's market and actually have people try it.
[00:58:52] I've had so many founders speak to me and say, why didn't this particular ad that I ran
[00:58:56] Unknown Host: on this platform work for me?
[00:58:58] Unknown Host: Maybe the copy wasn't good, the creative wasn't strong.
[00:59:00] Unknown Host: But usually the problem is they're not having the right conversation because that ad never
[00:59:03] Unknown Host: reached the right person.
[00:59:05] Unknown Host: And if you're in B2B marketing, that is much of the game.
[00:59:08] Unknown Host: And this is where LinkedIn ads solves that problem for you.
[00:59:11] Unknown Host: Their targeting is ridiculously specific.
[00:59:14] Unknown Host: You can target by job title, seniority, company size, industry and even someone's skillset.
[00:59:20] Unknown Host: And then network includes over a billion professionals, about 130 million of them are decision
[00:59:25] Unknown Host: makers.
[00:59:26] Unknown Host: So when you use LinkedIn ads, you're putting your brand in front of the right people.
[00:59:30] Unknown Host: And LinkedIn ads also drive the highest B2B return on ad spend across all ad networks
[00:59:34] Unknown Host: in my experience.
[00:59:35] Unknown Host: If you want to give them a try, head over to LinkedIn.com slash diary.
[00:59:41] Unknown Host: And when you spend $250 on your first LinkedIn ads campaign, you'll get an extra $250
[00:59:47] Unknown Host: credit from me for the next one.
[00:59:49] Unknown Host: That's LinkedIn.com slash diary terms and conditions apply.
[00:59:53] I've heard you say that there's various types of entrepreneurs.
[00:59:56] Unknown Host: There's the sort of zero to one entrepreneur who's good at starting things.
[00:59:59] Unknown Host: There's the Montana.
[01:00:01] Unknown Host: And then there's the finisher.
[01:00:02] Unknown Host: Which one of you?
[01:00:03] Unknown Host: I'm a starter.
[01:00:04] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:00:05] Chris Kerner: Threw and through.
[01:00:08] If I stay in a business too long, it all falls apart.
[01:00:13] Chris Kerner: Right?
[01:00:14] Chris Kerner: Just objectively.
[01:00:15] Chris Kerner: So I need to hand off the reins at a very specific point.
[01:00:18] Chris Kerner: Or I need to have a partner from the outset that knows me, my strengths and my weaknesses,
[01:00:23] Chris Kerner: that just takes over at a certain point.
[01:00:26] So I like to say there are starters, maintainers, and finishers.
[01:00:30] Chris Kerner: A starter could be called like a visionary.
[01:00:33] Chris Kerner: And not as like a backhanded compliment way, but someone an idea guy, right?
[01:00:37] Chris Kerner: Not just a business idea guy, but like a marketing idea guy.
[01:00:41] Chris Kerner: Let's change the subject line to this idea guy.
[01:00:43] Chris Kerner: Like an idea machine, right?
[01:00:46] Chris Kerner: That's a visionary.
[01:00:47] Chris Kerner: And then you have the maintainer, which would be an operator.
[01:00:51] Chris Kerner: That's a guy that just wakes up every day and loves tweaking little things and making
[01:00:54] Chris Kerner: small improvements, process oriented, someone that loves growing something and just fixing
[01:01:01] Chris Kerner: little problems all day, right?
[01:01:03] Chris Kerner: And then you have a finisher, which is like a deal guy, right?
[01:01:07] Chris Kerner: That's the guy that's a super connector.
[01:01:09] Chris Kerner: He likes to, oh, you need to talk to Barry and he calls Emmy Connects him and like, he
[01:01:13] Chris Kerner: just gets a lot of energy from connecting deals, coming up with creative deals for an exit
[01:01:18] Chris Kerner: for a sale, putting people together, hiring the right people, seeing something to its
[01:01:24] Chris Kerner: completion.
[01:01:25] Chris Kerner: But I'm definitely in the first camp.
[01:01:27] Chris Kerner: Is it possible to be able to be able to be?
[01:01:29] Yeah, when you're all three, you're Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:01:31] Chris Kerner: I mean, truly, like you start something from scratch and you see it to a trillion dollars.
[01:01:37] Chris Kerner: There's been like, I think there've been three people on the planet that have brought something
[01:01:41] Chris Kerner: from zero to a trillion.
[01:01:43] Jensen Hoang in video, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:01:49] Chris Kerner: I think like even Bill Gates, even Steve Jobs, I might be wrong.
[01:01:53] Chris Kerner: Yeah, but even Steve Jobs got out long before they hit a trillion market cap.
[01:01:56] Chris Kerner: But a billion.
[01:01:57] Unknown Host: A lot of people get out of their business.
[01:01:58] Unknown Host: Yeah, that's a billion.
[01:02:00] Chris Kerner: That's not nothing.
[01:02:01] Chris Kerner: It's also very impressive.
[01:02:02] Chris Kerner: But when you get all three, that's what you get.
[01:02:05] One of the things that I find really interesting about your story is you start, what's, is it
[01:02:09] Unknown Host: 75, 80 businesses?
[01:02:11] When I speak to people like Kevin O'Leary who have worked with some of the greatest entrepreneurs
[01:02:16] Unknown Host: to ever live like Steve Jobs and he's very familiar with Elon Musk, they talk to me about
[01:02:22] Unknown Host: focus.
[01:02:24] And he says to me that the great thing about Steve Jobs is he was 80% signal and 20% noise.
[01:02:30] Unknown Host: IE 80% of his time, he was focused on the most important thing and he was brutal about
[01:02:35] Unknown Host: not entertaining anything else.
[01:02:38] Unknown Host: Johnny Ives has famously said that the one thing Steve Jobs was most known for is his
[01:02:41] Unknown Host: remarkable ability to focus.
[01:02:43] Unknown Host: He would literally ask you what you said no to in order to focus on the most important
[01:02:47] Unknown Host: thing.
[01:02:48] Unknown Host: I think about Mark Zuckerberg in his unbelievable ability to focus.
[01:02:52] Unknown Host: I remember several people at Meta, but also I think it's a public story telling me that
[01:02:56] Unknown Host: when he realized he was late to mobile, he refused to take any meetings about anything
[01:03:00] Unknown Host: other than mobile.
[01:03:01] Unknown Host: Like extreme levels of focus.
[01:03:03] Unknown Host: And then Kevin O'Leary from Shark Tank said the same to me about Elon Musk.
[01:03:06] Unknown Host: He says Elon Musk is the only person that I think operates close to 100% signal, which
[01:03:09] Unknown Host: is he, I interviewed Walter Isaacson, his biographer and he said, Elon will sit in a meeting
[01:03:14] Unknown Host: and if people aren't talking about something, that is the most important thing.
[01:03:17] Unknown Host: He'll completely zone out.
[01:03:19] Unknown Host: And then the minute he hears something that he considers to be the most important thing,
[01:03:22] Unknown Host: it's like he snaps into reality and he takes control and he's deep into the detail.
[01:03:26] Unknown Host: And it sits in contradiction to a lot of the narrative of like lots of side hustles,
[01:03:32] Unknown Host: lots of businesses do as many things as you can.
[01:03:34] How do you, but you've both kind of, you know, you've, you know, you've, you've, you've
[01:03:36] Unknown Host: should create a life yourself where you're, you're a millionaire and you're free in that
[01:03:40] Unknown Host: regard.
[01:03:41] Unknown Host: But when I look at the biggest companies in the world, there's this like, there appears
[01:03:45] Unknown Host: to be obsessive focus.
[01:03:46] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:03:48] I love that question.
[01:03:49] Chris Kerner: I, I think that all else equal, the guy who focuses more is more likely to be a billionaire.
[01:03:56] Chris Kerner: But back to momentum, right?
[01:03:59] Chris Kerner: The person that keeps and has and maintains momentum and has, gets energy from what they
[01:04:04] Chris Kerner: do.
[01:04:05] Chris Kerner: They're more likely to be a millionaire by the average, than the average person.
[01:04:08] Chris Kerner: Right.
[01:04:09] Chris Kerner: I genuinely have no desire to be a billionaire.
[01:04:12] Chris Kerner: Genuinely, if I get there, cool.
[01:04:15] Chris Kerner: But I don't want to leave my kids tens of millions of dollars anyway.
[01:04:18] Chris Kerner: I know where I get most of my energy from.
[01:04:20] Chris Kerner: I have a lot of surface area for this.
[01:04:22] Chris Kerner: I've tried the focus.
[01:04:23] Chris Kerner: I've tried having a board.
[01:04:25] Chris Kerner: I don't want any of that.
[01:04:27] Chris Kerner: Genuinely, I don't, right?
[01:04:29] Chris Kerner: So if my life with hyper focused Chris looks like billion dollar exits, reporting to
[01:04:36] Chris Kerner: a board, being chairman of the board, being CEO, sitting in meetings all day, that's miserable
[01:04:42] Chris Kerner: Chris.
[01:04:43] Chris Kerner: Right?
[01:04:44] Chris Kerner: And if I'm not going to, if I don't want to leave a ton of money to my kids anyway, then
[01:04:47] Chris Kerner: why am I making Chris miserable?
[01:04:50] Chris Kerner: So my fourth great-grandkids can be rich instead of just my second great-grandkids.
[01:04:54] Chris Kerner: Like that's genuinely how I look at it.
[01:04:56] Chris Kerner: I'm one of my superpowers is my long term perspective.
[01:05:00] Chris Kerner: I think of things on an eternal scale.
[01:05:02] Chris Kerner: And if I have to have a miserable life, so my kids in year 20, 300 can still be wealthy?
[01:05:10] Forget that.
[01:05:11] Chris Kerner: I don't, I don't want them to have all that money anyway.
[01:05:14] Chris Kerner: You know?
[01:05:15] Chris Kerner: So I want to live an awesome life where I'm a good and present father.
[01:05:18] Chris Kerner: And to me, that looks like focusing less, not more.
[01:05:21] What if you focused for the next 10 years?
[01:05:24] Unknown Host: You made it to a billion dollars on one thing.
[01:05:26] Unknown Host: And then, because you've done that, you can take even more sort of experimental bets
[01:05:33] Unknown Host: with higher risk and more enjoyment and more sort of pleasure centric bets over the next
[01:05:37] Unknown Host: 40, 50, 60 years of the rest of your life.
[01:05:39] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:05:40] Chris Kerner: I just don't think that that juice would be worth the squeeze.
[01:05:44] Chris Kerner: I think that those bigger bets that I take will just amount to more meetings and more
[01:05:49] Chris Kerner: travel and more time away from my kids.
[01:05:52] Chris Kerner: And I don't like it might sound controversial.
[01:05:56] Chris Kerner: Like I'm not trying to change the world.
[01:05:58] Chris Kerner: Like I want to help people start businesses and I can do that with my iPhone.
[01:06:02] Chris Kerner: And that will change the world, right?
[01:06:04] Chris Kerner: But I'm not trying to solve world hunger.
[01:06:05] Chris Kerner: I think that someone else is probably going to solve.
[01:06:07] Chris Kerner: And so I just want to be a good dad and work on really cool things.
[01:06:10] Chris Kerner: And it's been a grind to get here, right?
[01:06:14] Chris Kerner: Like I've had more years with zero income than I've had up years, right?
[01:06:21] Chris Kerner: But my up years have more than compensated for my down years.
[01:06:24] Chris Kerner: So what you're looking at today is the end result of 17 years, of a lot of testing.
[01:06:29] Chris Kerner: Like a very patient wife that was unquestioning and unwavering and extremely loyal, which I
[01:06:35] Chris Kerner: could not have done it without.
[01:06:37] Chris Kerner: And so there were a lot of periods of my life where I beat myself up over that lack of
[01:06:41] Chris Kerner: focus.
[01:06:42] Chris Kerner: I wouldn't got my MBA because of my lack of focus.
[01:06:44] Chris Kerner: I finished my undergrad because of my lack of focus.
[01:06:46] Chris Kerner: Like getting a full time job has never really been off the table until the last five or
[01:06:51] Chris Kerner: so years.
[01:06:52] Chris Kerner: So I've never been unwilling to get a job or to focus.
[01:06:56] Chris Kerner: And I probably did it the hard way, honestly.
[01:06:59] Chris Kerner: But I'm to the point now where I don't feel the need to focus all on one thing.
[01:07:04] Did you ever feel guilty because of the situation you put your family or your partner in?
[01:07:10] Yeah.
[01:07:11] More than once.
[01:07:13] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:07:14] Chris Kerner: More than many times.
[01:07:17] Give me an example.
[01:07:18] Chris Kerner: I spent 18 months working on a project that had no cash flow along the way with the hope
[01:07:29] Chris Kerner: of a big payout.
[01:07:32] Chris Kerner: And we were making no income, right?
[01:07:34] Chris Kerner: And I was focused on this one thing.
[01:07:36] Chris Kerner: And that is kind of the downside of focus.
[01:07:38] Chris Kerner: If you focus on the wrong thing, it can really come back to bite you, right?
[01:07:41] Chris Kerner: But to me, this is objectively the right thing.
[01:07:43] Chris Kerner: It was showing all the signals it was growing.
[01:07:47] Chris Kerner: We had like a few rental homes.
[01:07:48] Chris Kerner: We had some assets.
[01:07:50] Chris Kerner: And I was selling those things so my family could maintain the quality of life, right?
[01:07:55] Chris Kerner: So I felt guilty, but I was also insulating them from feeling the pinch that I was feeling
[01:08:02] Chris Kerner: in the office, right?
[01:08:03] Chris Kerner: And then at the end of that experiment, it all went to zero.
[01:08:07] Chris Kerner: I was out money.
[01:08:08] Chris Kerner: I was out time.
[01:08:09] Chris Kerner: I was out everything.
[01:08:11] Chris Kerner: And I felt very guilty.
[01:08:13] Chris Kerner: That was one example.
[01:08:16] But thankfully, we didn't have to sell our house.
[01:08:19] Chris Kerner: We didn't have to do anything drastic.
[01:08:20] Chris Kerner: And what that looked like at home was, dad was quiet more often than not.
[01:08:24] Chris Kerner: Dad was grumpy more often than not.
[01:08:27] Chris Kerner: But dad wasn't really talking freely and openly about the things he was going through
[01:08:31] Chris Kerner: because he was trying to put on a brave face and insulate the family from that.
[01:08:36] Chris Kerner: Even when my wife was begging to know more, to get more out of me, I just, if I talk about
[01:08:41] Chris Kerner: stressors, then it becomes more stressful to me oftentimes.
[01:08:44] Chris Kerner: So I just keep it in.
[01:08:46] I find the same.
[01:08:47] Unknown Host: I think my partner understands this of me.
[01:08:50] Unknown Host: And I tried to explain to her that I don't like talking about the stress because in this
[01:08:53] Unknown Host: environment, it's actually de-stressing me from not having to explain and conversate
[01:08:57] Unknown Host: about it.
[01:08:59] So, which is a bit of a paradox because then they don't really understand.
[01:09:02] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:09:03] Unknown Host: And if they don't understand, they might misunderstand.
[01:09:06] Unknown Host: Misunderstandments might lead to arguments.
[01:09:08] Unknown Host: The arguments create stress.
[01:09:09] Unknown Host: And then you're going to tell them in some sort of like argument.
[01:09:12] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:09:13] Unknown Host: What's going on?
[01:09:14] Chris Kerner: Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:15] Chris Kerner: I've loved that for sure.
[01:09:16] Chris Kerner: I don't know how to navigate that, but it's definitely true that me going through
[01:09:20] Unknown Host: something in work and then having to come home and like go through it for another
[01:09:23] hour to someone else and stress them out, potentially.
[01:09:27] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:09:28] Unknown Host: I don't feel like the right approach.
[01:09:29] Unknown Host: No.
[01:09:30] Chris Kerner: But I don't know what the right approach is because they have a right to know about it as
[01:09:33] Chris Kerner: well, right?
[01:09:34] I think we just need an outlet.
[01:09:36] Unknown Host: Whether it's a friend that kind of understands or someone else that, you know, is in our
[01:09:40] Unknown Host: space that we can just talk to about the situation.
[01:09:43] Unknown Host: I think having no outlet is also bad.
[01:09:45] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:09:46] Chris Kerner: And I'm guilty of that.
[01:09:48] I find a lot of joy in my work and so I don't look at it as work often, but it's still
[01:09:53] Chris Kerner: work, right?
[01:09:54] Chris Kerner: Like it's still taxing.
[01:09:57] Chris Kerner: I need to be better by having an outlet.
[01:10:00] Have you developed a new relationship with rejection and failure because, you know, starting
[01:10:04] Unknown Host: eight-year businesses, you must have dealt with a lot of failure?
[01:10:08] Unknown Host: And how does that feed into everything we're talking about today?
[01:10:12] Oh, man.
[01:10:13] Chris Kerner: I would, I don't know where I'd be without rejection and failure.
[01:10:17] Chris Kerner: I'm not good at sales.
[01:10:19] So if anyone's watching this and like, I can't start a business, business is all sales.
[01:10:22] Chris Kerner: Like you don't have to be good at sales.
[01:10:24] Chris Kerner: I'm not good at sales.
[01:10:25] Chris Kerner: I can't think of a business that where I had to rely on like early customers coming from
[01:10:30] Chris Kerner: friends and family because I cared a lot about what people thought.
[01:10:33] Chris Kerner: I didn't want to post my side hustle number 37 to Facebook because I just thought my friends
[01:10:38] Chris Kerner: would roll their eyes.
[01:10:39] Chris Kerner: So I created this stupid constraint for me where like I had to launch things without the
[01:10:43] Chris Kerner: help of my ever-willing friends and family because I was too prideful, right?
[01:10:47] Chris Kerner: So I advise against that, first of all.
[01:10:49] Chris Kerner: Second of all, I served a mission for my church.
[01:10:53] Chris Kerner: I went to Eastern Europe for two years and I knocked doors in Hungarian for two years
[01:10:59] Chris Kerner: straight.
[01:11:00] Chris Kerner: I approached people on the street in freezing weather, wearing a big Russian cat.
[01:11:06] Chris Kerner: Like I got rejected tens of thousands of times over the course of two years.
[01:11:11] Chris Kerner: Being an introvert, staying an introvert, still an introvert, still bad at sales, still
[01:11:15] Chris Kerner: hating sales today at age 38, right?
[01:11:18] Chris Kerner: But that like changed me as a man, as a person, right?
[01:11:23] Chris Kerner: That rewired my brain to just realize that every now is closer to a yes.
[01:11:28] Chris Kerner: If my conversion rate is 0.1%, I got to talk to a thousand people and I will surely get
[01:11:34] Chris Kerner: a conversion.
[01:11:35] Chris Kerner: If I talk to a thousand and I don't get a conversion, then I'm going to get two conversions by the
[01:11:38] Chris Kerner: time I get to 2000, statistically speaking.
[01:11:40] Chris Kerner: So I just need to keep getting rejected.
[01:11:44] Chris Kerner: And that changed everything for me.
[01:11:46] I think it's super underrated to give kids a job in like cold sales.
[01:11:50] Unknown Host: That's what I did when I was 16 till 19.
[01:11:53] Unknown Host: Sounds like it's what you did as a young man.
[01:11:57] Unknown Host: Are your kids going to do that?
[01:11:59] Unknown Host: Yeah, hopefully.
[01:12:00] Chris Kerner: And two of my kids are introverts, two are extroverted, but they are selling.
[01:12:05] Chris Kerner: Like they already have businesses, little side oscillals here and there.
[01:12:09] Chris Kerner: But I am encouraging them to go on missions and to do selling because it's the fastest way
[01:12:13] Chris Kerner: to learn.
[01:12:14] Chris Kerner: Like it's the fastest way to test.
[01:12:16] Chris Kerner: If I talk to a thousand people, then I can have a thousand different approaches.
[01:12:20] Chris Kerner: And if my conversion rate is 0.1%, I'm going to get that to 0.5% over time because I've
[01:12:25] Chris Kerner: been able to test and iterate and pivot based on all that feedback I get.
[01:12:30] Unknown Host: What have you learnt about team building and business partners through this process?
[01:12:34] Unknown Host: What advice would you give to someone who sat there alone listening to this right now?
[01:12:38] Unknown Host: Do they need a business partner if they do who, how, what?
[01:12:42] So man, usually people don't need a business partner.
[01:12:49] If you look at the stats on business failure rates with companies that have co-founders,
[01:12:55] Chris Kerner: it's significantly higher than companies that have solo founders.
[01:12:59] Chris Kerner: We see their survivorship bias examples, right?
[01:13:02] Chris Kerner: The apples and a lot of companies we can look at that had two co-founders that won.
[01:13:07] Chris Kerner: Nobody talks about or writes about the 90, 60, 80% of companies that fail with co-founders.
[01:13:15] Chris Kerner: Think about it this way.
[01:13:16] Chris Kerner: When we get married, we'll spend years talking about our potential plans, like big goals.
[01:13:21] Chris Kerner: Like, where do we want to live?
[01:13:23] Chris Kerner: How many kids do we have?
[01:13:24] Chris Kerner: My wife and I wanted seven kids and we got married.
[01:13:26] Chris Kerner: We settled on four, right?
[01:13:27] Chris Kerner: They changed over time.
[01:13:28] Chris Kerner: It took years to change.
[01:13:29] Chris Kerner: We realized kids are actually freaking hard, right?
[01:13:32] Chris Kerner: So then we're like, where do we live?
[01:13:33] Chris Kerner: What kind of a house do we want?
[01:13:34] Chris Kerner: We spend all this time.
[01:13:36] Chris Kerner: Maybe while we're engaged, maybe while we're dating, maybe after we're married.
[01:13:40] Chris Kerner: But those are big decisions, right?
[01:13:42] Chris Kerner: But when we choose a business partner, we go get avocado toast together and we're like,
[01:13:46] Chris Kerner: 50, 50?
[01:13:47] Chris Kerner: Cool.
[01:13:48] Chris Kerner: Sounds good.
[01:13:49] Chris Kerner: Let's do this.
[01:13:50] Chris Kerner: I'll get the doc signed.
[01:13:51] Chris Kerner: It's like, who is that guy?
[01:13:52] Chris Kerner: You might have even known him your whole life, but who is he as a business partner or
[01:13:55] Chris Kerner: as a business person?
[01:13:57] Chris Kerner: I feel like business partnerships are significantly harder than marriages, even.
[01:14:03] Chris Kerner: But we put 99% less thought into the structure of things and that's a giant failure that
[01:14:10] Chris Kerner: I've made over and over again.
[01:14:12] What you wish someone had said to you in the situations where it didn't work out with
[01:14:15] Unknown Host: business partners or really like across the board because I read that you'd had what
[01:14:18] Unknown Host: seven business partners?
[01:14:20] It says that I've had like 15.
[01:14:22] Unknown Host: Okay.
[01:14:23] Unknown Host: So in those 15 occasions, what is the advice you wish someone had given you before you
[01:14:27] Unknown Host: engaged in those business relationships?
[01:14:29] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:14:30] Chris Kerner: Well, what do they say about dating?
[01:14:31] Chris Kerner: It's like be a good, like the best way to find a good spouse is to be a good spouse.
[01:14:36] Chris Kerner: Best way to find a good girlfriend.
[01:14:37] Chris Kerner: You know what I'm saying?
[01:14:38] Chris Kerner: You've got to learn more about yourself before you partner with someone else.
[01:14:42] Chris Kerner: Most people have no idea like who they are as a business person or as an entrepreneur
[01:14:45] Chris Kerner: when they partner.
[01:14:46] Chris Kerner: They don't know what their strengths are or their weaknesses are.
[01:14:49] Chris Kerner: They sure don't know what the other guys' strengths or weaknesses are.
[01:14:51] Chris Kerner: So I suggest people solo found things to start to learn more about themselves.
[01:14:57] Chris Kerner: Are they a visionary?
[01:14:58] Chris Kerner: Are they an integrator, starter, maintainer, finisher?
[01:15:00] Chris Kerner: Who are they?
[01:15:02] Chris Kerner: And then when they want to jump into another thing, because inevitably if we launch one
[01:15:05] Chris Kerner: thing, we're going to launch more, they know more about what to look for in a partner
[01:15:10] Chris Kerner: and they can optimize for that.
[01:15:12] Chris Kerner: What about equity?
[01:15:14] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:15:15] I mean, 50-50 is the old standby, right?
[01:15:20] Could you imagine if you go in a first date and it's like, how many kids do you want for?
[01:15:27] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[01:15:28] Chris Kerner: We'll have four.
[01:15:29] Chris Kerner: We'll get married.
[01:15:30] Chris Kerner: And that's how many we will have, no matter what.
[01:15:33] Chris Kerner: That's a 50-50 partnership, right?
[01:15:35] Chris Kerner: It's making an incredibly important decision based on, both equal 100, number sound clean
[01:15:42] Chris Kerner: to me, but like what is the statistical chance?
[01:15:45] Chris Kerner: This is what needs to be true for a 50-50 partnership to work, okay?
[01:15:49] They both have to be all in.
[01:15:51] Chris Kerner: They both have to always be all in for the whole lifespan of the business, maybe years,
[01:15:55] Chris Kerner: maybe decades.
[01:15:56] Chris Kerner: They have to put in the same amount of money, same amount of effort, same amount of connections,
[01:16:00] Chris Kerner: value, history, background.
[01:16:03] Chris Kerner: Also, both of them should be completely selfless, right?
[01:16:07] Chris Kerner: And not care if the other one's not pulling his weight.
[01:16:09] Chris Kerner: I'm taking a month-long vacation.
[01:16:11] Chris Kerner: Cool.
[01:16:12] Chris Kerner: You'll make up for it later.
[01:16:13] Chris Kerner: They have to be like that chill of a human being.
[01:16:15] Chris Kerner: And of course, they have to be the same as the other person.
[01:16:18] Chris Kerner: If all those things are true, 50-50 works great.
[01:16:21] Chris Kerner: And they need to develop going forward in the same way, because the next 10 future,
[01:16:25] Chris Kerner: you need to grow at the same rate, yeah, which will never, never, ever be the case.
[01:16:29] Chris Kerner: So I like to say like, you don't want a DTR to find the relationship too early or too
[01:16:36] Chris Kerner: late.
[01:16:37] If you sit down and branching on it, those two 50-50 cool big mistakes.
[01:16:41] Chris Kerner: If you're two years down the line and you've got all this revenue and customers and
[01:16:45] Chris Kerner: you're like, all right, we should probably formalize this too late.
[01:16:48] Chris Kerner: Because like, that only works if the business just stays at like a steady state forever.
[01:16:52] Chris Kerner: Which you won't.
[01:16:53] Chris Kerner: It's going to go up or it's going to go down, right?
[01:16:56] Chris Kerner: And like, things get really ugly when either one of those two scenarios happen.
[01:17:00] Chris Kerner: So the sweet spot in my experience is listen, this is how this conversation would work.
[01:17:05] Chris Kerner: We're going to partner together.
[01:17:06] Chris Kerner: Hey, I think you're going to be great for this business because you have a sales background,
[01:17:11] Chris Kerner: your granite sales, you have a lot of contacts in the industry.
[01:17:14] Chris Kerner: I don't have any of that.
[01:17:15] Chris Kerner: I don't even like sales.
[01:17:16] Chris Kerner: I don't know anything about sales.
[01:17:17] Chris Kerner: But I'm an amazing engineer.
[01:17:19] Chris Kerner: Like I know I can build this thing.
[01:17:20] Chris Kerner: You've seen me build other websites, other apps in the past.
[01:17:23] Chris Kerner: I already have like a wireframe in mind.
[01:17:25] Chris Kerner: Like we're going to be great for this, right?
[01:17:28] Chris Kerner: So let's just do this.
[01:17:30] Chris Kerner: I don't know how this is going to go.
[01:17:31] Chris Kerner: I don't know how much time you have.
[01:17:32] Chris Kerner: We both have full-time jobs.
[01:17:35] Chris Kerner: Why don't we just get to $10,000 in revenue?
[01:17:39] Chris Kerner: Let's get product market fit.
[01:17:41] Chris Kerner: Let's get some good traction.
[01:17:42] Chris Kerner: Maybe we'll get like you really have to set up a defined metric around it.
[01:17:46] Chris Kerner: Not like let's see how this goes in 30 days.
[01:17:48] Chris Kerner: It's something like a revenue number, number of customers or something.
[01:17:51] Chris Kerner: At that point, let's sit down.
[01:17:53] Chris Kerner: Let's just like put it in the calendar today and let's have a conversation about what
[01:17:57] Chris Kerner: our equity looks like.
[01:17:59] Chris Kerner: Because almost every time they're going to be remote, just based on the world we live
[01:18:04] Chris Kerner: in, or one person will put in more money, or one person has more experience.
[01:18:10] And all those things are relevant.
[01:18:11] Chris Kerner: But unless you're going to get resentment, 100%.
[01:18:15] Chris Kerner: And you're probably not going to talk about that resentment.
[01:18:18] Chris Kerner: And it's only going to get worse.
[01:18:20] It'll only get worse if things either go up or down.
[01:18:24] Chris Kerner: So they will always get worse.
[01:18:27] Chris Kerner: But it's hard to define because one person might have 30 years of industry experience
[01:18:31] Chris Kerner: in context and expertise.
[01:18:32] Chris Kerner: And he can make one phone call that changes everything.
[01:18:35] Chris Kerner: And the other person might be 18 years old and just a hustler and willing to put in 80
[01:18:39] Chris Kerner: hours a week.
[01:18:40] Chris Kerner: So is the level of value the same if the level of hours put into the business?
[01:18:44] Chris Kerner: Not the same.
[01:18:47] It's hard.
[01:18:48] Chris Kerner: It's really hard to say, hey, my one phone call made us 10 millions of dollars, tens of
[01:18:52] Chris Kerner: millions of dollars that you've done all the work.
[01:18:55] Chris Kerner: You're the operator.
[01:18:56] Chris Kerner: So we should be 50, 50.
[01:18:58] They're both going to take issue with that.
[01:19:01] The only instance I was thinking about all the business partnerships that I'm aware of.
[01:19:05] Unknown Host: So companies I've invested in, this about six or 70 companies I've invested in, and
[01:19:09] Unknown Host: then businesses I've started myself.
[01:19:10] Unknown Host: And the one time I've seen it work to split equally, the two people had known each other
[01:19:17] Unknown Host: for a long, long time and they were both late in their career.
[01:19:23] Unknown Host: So they're like, you know, when we think about rate of development and potential, not only
[01:19:28] did they have a strong relationship, they'd known each other a long time, they'd work
[01:19:31] Unknown Host: together more than five years together.
[01:19:35] And they're sort of later in a more mature phase of their career where you know, like the
[01:19:40] Unknown Host: kids situations figure itself out.
[01:19:42] Unknown Host: Yeah, they're going to have kids or not.
[01:19:44] Unknown Host: And there hasn't been some of the big life disruptors.
[01:19:46] Unknown Host: Sometimes can come along and change things.
[01:19:49] And then I can give another example where two people knew each other.
[01:19:53] Unknown Host: They were very, very young.
[01:19:54] Unknown Host: They'd worked together before.
[01:19:56] Unknown Host: The contract went in 50, 50, although it was never really equal.
[01:20:00] Unknown Host: And then their rate of growth changed wildly where one person really just like became a
[01:20:07] Unknown Host: superstar.
[01:20:08] Unknown Host: And they look back at the contract in its 50, 50.
[01:20:10] Unknown Host: And I remember being privy to the conversation where that person turned around to their business
[01:20:13] Unknown Host: partner.
[01:20:14] Unknown Host: It's like, this is not fair.
[01:20:15] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:20:16] Chris Kerner: This company without me goes to zero without you, it keeps growing.
[01:20:20] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:20:21] Unknown Host: And there was an adjustment made to the equity at that point, which is hard to do because
[01:20:23] Unknown Host: attack reasons and stuff.
[01:20:25] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:20:26] Chris Kerner: The one thing I will say about a 50, 50 and going in with someone that you've known
[01:20:29] Chris Kerner: for a long time or going in with your best friend, that can be really freaking fun.
[01:20:33] Chris Kerner: Like it can just be the most enjoyable life ever.
[01:20:36] Chris Kerner: So it's just very high risk and very high reward.
[01:20:40] Chris Kerner: And if you can make it work, like oftentimes the biggest and the best in the most well-ranned
[01:20:44] Chris Kerner: companies you see were 50, 50 partners that knew each other for a long time for that
[01:20:49] Chris Kerner: reason.
[01:20:50] Chris Kerner: But the rate of failure is higher than average.
[01:20:53] So in these three suitcases in front of me, I have a different amounts of money.
[01:21:00] And all I want you to do is to let me know if I was giving you this amount of money, what
[01:21:05] business you would start.
[01:21:08] Okay.
[01:21:10] Okay.
[01:21:11] So the first one has 500 dollars.
[01:21:17] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:21:18] Chris Kerner: Awesome.
[01:21:19] So most people would look at this and think, what are we going to do with $500?
[01:21:23] Chris Kerner: It's a lot of money, right?
[01:21:25] Chris Kerner: In the age of today with 30 day free trials and a lot of Silicon Valley funded companies
[01:21:31] Chris Kerner: willing to give you a lot of money to test your product, this goes a long way.
[01:21:34] Chris Kerner: So the first thing to come to mind that comes to mind is probably my favorite business
[01:21:39] Chris Kerner: idea of all right now.
[01:21:41] Chris Kerner: Thankfully you can start it with even less than this.
[01:21:43] Chris Kerner: And that would be a business that helps implement AI into small businesses, small to medium-sized
[01:21:48] Chris Kerner: businesses.
[01:21:49] Chris Kerner: So some facts for you.
[01:21:51] There's 400 million small businesses on the planet.
[01:21:54] Chris Kerner: They've surveyed some of these business owners.
[01:21:57] Chris Kerner: And 77% of them have admitted that like AI would be transformational to their business.
[01:22:04] Chris Kerner: They need AI.
[01:22:05] Chris Kerner: It's not a fad.
[01:22:06] Chris Kerner: It's not going away.
[01:22:07] Chris Kerner: Five percent of them have claimed they're using AI in a meaningful way, right?
[01:22:11] Chris Kerner: And define that as you will.
[01:22:13] Chris Kerner: So basically we have this knowledge gap, right?
[01:22:16] Chris Kerner: We know it's like a business cognitive dissonance of you all.
[01:22:19] Chris Kerner: We know we need to do something and we're not doing it.
[01:22:21] Chris Kerner: It doesn't matter how easy the tools are.
[01:22:24] Chris Kerner: It doesn't matter how much you can create a new website or an app with one prompt.
[01:22:28] Chris Kerner: They need someone to do it, right?
[01:22:30] Chris Kerner: I know how to vacuum my floor.
[01:22:31] Chris Kerner: I know how to clean my house.
[01:22:33] Chris Kerner: I still would rather just pay someone to do it.
[01:22:36] Chris Kerner: And so with a fifth of the money, call it $100.
[01:22:39] Chris Kerner: I would start learning some vibe coding tools.
[01:22:42] Chris Kerner: Repolate, Lindy, there's a ton of them out there.
[01:22:44] Chris Kerner: What is vibe coding for anyone that is vibe coding is the non-technical person, the non-coder
[01:22:49] Chris Kerner: such as myself, using their natural language to just say, hey, build me an app that manages
[01:22:56] Chris Kerner: customers for dog trainers.
[01:22:59] You'll have an app, right?
[01:23:01] Chris Kerner: Is it fully functional, workable yet, not quite, but 10 to 20 more prompts and you're
[01:23:05] Chris Kerner: going to go.
[01:23:06] Unknown Host: For anyone that doesn't know, I'm an investor in both lovable and replete, so just
[01:23:09] Unknown Host: glamour.
[01:23:10] Unknown Host: But I would recommend going on replete or lovable and typing in any website ID you have,
[01:23:18] Unknown Host: just to have that sort of eureka moment of watching it be made in front of you.
[01:23:21] Unknown Host: I think that eureka moment is the moment your mind expands to the possibilities that
[01:23:24] Unknown Host: are currently right in front of all of us.
[01:23:27] Unknown Host: We think of building websites or apps as exclusive to those that have spent five years
[01:23:31] Unknown Host: learning to code that has now changed.
[01:23:33] Unknown Host: Yeah, we can all do it.
[01:23:35] Chris Kerner: Yeah, and everyone should, like you said, one prompt, develop an app.
[01:23:38] Chris Kerner: What do I prompt?
[01:23:39] Chris Kerner: What do I build?
[01:23:40] Chris Kerner: Ask Chad Gbt what to build.
[01:23:42] Chris Kerner: Copy paste one of those.
[01:23:43] Chris Kerner: Ask Chad Gbt to prompt it, take it over to the replete or lovable, paste it and see
[01:23:47] Chris Kerner: what it builds.
[01:23:48] Chris Kerner: So, I would use this as my education.
[01:23:50] Chris Kerner: And also to build a website, right, Chris's AI Automations.com, whatever, anything.
[01:23:55] Chris Kerner: And then I would take the rest of the money and I would put it into ads, right?
[01:24:01] Chris Kerner: Preferably meta ads, Facebook ads.
[01:24:03] Chris Kerner: And I would target local businesses.
[01:24:06] Chris Kerner: Even though this is a global thing, if I live in Omaha, Nebraska, I could sell this to
[01:24:09] Chris Kerner: people in Tokyo.
[01:24:10] Chris Kerner: It doesn't matter.
[01:24:11] Chris Kerner: I'm going to put radius around Omaha and my ads are going to say I'm Chris and I can
[01:24:16] Chris Kerner: help put AI into your business.
[01:24:18] Chris Kerner: I'm going to use fifth grade words.
[01:24:20] Chris Kerner: I'm not going to use LLM.
[01:24:21] Chris Kerner: I'm not going to say Chad Gbt.
[01:24:23] Chris Kerner: I'm just going to say I will make your business more money or save your business money with
[01:24:28] Chris Kerner: AI.
[01:24:29] Chris Kerner: Just a service business.
[01:24:31] Chris Kerner: And then I'll get on discovery calls with these business owners and I'll just start peppering
[01:24:35] Chris Kerner: them with questions about their business.
[01:24:37] Chris Kerner: And over time, I'm going to learn based on their answers what their problems are, what
[01:24:41] Chris Kerner: they're struggling with is a hiring, is a payroll, is it sales, usually it's going
[01:24:44] Chris Kerner: to be sales, right?
[01:24:46] Chris Kerner: And then I'm going to take this money over here, this $100 and go back to those apps and
[01:24:51] Chris Kerner: start building solutions for them for free.
[01:24:53] Chris Kerner: Just to kind of implement myself as an expert.
[01:24:55] Chris Kerner: What are you going to challenge them?
[01:24:57] Chris Kerner: I'm going to charge them between $50 and $5,000 up front one time to implement it and then
[01:25:03] Chris Kerner: I'm going to charge them 20% of that amount in an ongoing basis to maintain it and fix
[01:25:08] Chris Kerner: it as it breaks.
[01:25:10] Let's say there's a gutter cleaning business in Omaha, Nebraska that doesn't want to take
[01:25:16] Chris Kerner: calls after hours.
[01:25:18] Chris Kerner: He's with his wife watching Netflix and he knows that's a $3,000 job.
[01:25:22] Chris Kerner: He doesn't want to take it.
[01:25:23] Chris Kerner: So he's always going to voicemail and they're calling someone else that is taking it, right?
[01:25:27] Chris Kerner: So I'm going to build an AI voice agent for him, which sounds really intimidating.
[01:25:31] Chris Kerner: It feels like we have to have all these skills you don't.
[01:25:33] Chris Kerner: You just need to prompt a couple tools a couple times.
[01:25:35] Chris Kerner: I'm going to build a voice agent for him and then I'm going to tell him to call that agent
[01:25:39] Chris Kerner: as if he were a customer and say, hey, pretend you're a customer that needs a gutter cleaning
[01:25:43] Chris Kerner: you're calling at 9.30 pm.
[01:25:45] Chris Kerner: And just see how it reacts.
[01:25:46] Chris Kerner: He's expecting there to be delay.
[01:25:48] Chris Kerner: There's really not.
[01:25:49] Chris Kerner: He's expecting it to be dumb.
[01:25:51] Chris Kerner: There's not.
[01:25:51] Chris Kerner: He's expecting it to need to know all about his business.
[01:25:54] Chris Kerner: It doesn't.
[01:25:55] Chris Kerner: Right?
[01:25:56] Chris Kerner: The AI know is about gutter cleaning businesses.
[01:25:58] Then he sold, right?
[01:26:00] Chris Kerner: Charge him $3,000 for that.
[01:26:02] You build it and then you charge him, call it $500 or $600 a month to maintain it over
[01:26:06] Chris Kerner: time.
[01:26:07] Chris Kerner: And then the beautiful thing is you can go to every other gutter cleaning business in Omaha
[01:26:10] Chris Kerner: or anywhere and copy and paste that same app and sell it to them.
[01:26:14] Got you.
[01:26:15] Unknown Host: So selling AI to small business owners who are in huge demand, but don't have the time
[01:26:19] Unknown Host: or think they need some sort of incredible expensive time and resource expensive competence
[01:26:28] Unknown Host: to understand AI when actually AI is really, really simple.
[01:26:30] Unknown Host: Yes.
[01:26:31] Chris Kerner: We see this play out over history where there's an initial arbitrage when a new technology
[01:26:36] Unknown Host: comes into play.
[01:26:37] Unknown Host: In fact, one of the core center jobs that I had when I was very, very broke many, many
[01:26:42] Unknown Host: years ago when I was like 18 or 19 was calling businesses from the yellow pages and
[01:26:49] Unknown Host: selling them Facebook ads.
[01:26:51] Chris Kerner: I would call a builder on a building site.
[01:26:53] Unknown Host: I'd speak to Dave who's the owner of the building company and I'd explain Facebook ads
[01:26:57] Unknown Host: to him over the phone.
[01:26:59] Unknown Host: And then I'd set them up for him and manage them for him on a long, ongoing basis and
[01:27:03] Unknown Host: just send him the leads because he didn't understand Facebook ads and these opportunities
[01:27:07] Unknown Host: you seem to exist for years when there's any technology as we're seeing how they are.
[01:27:13] Unknown Host: But the thing is with that idea and with most ideas in my experience, we think there's
[01:27:17] Chris Kerner: a very limited time span.
[01:27:18] Chris Kerner: And if I were to start that business today, just start calling me, it would work.
[01:27:22] Unknown Host: Yeah, you could still do it.
[01:27:23] Chris Kerner: I might have more competitors, but like it doesn't matter, it would still work.
[01:27:26] Unknown Host: Interestingly, the issue back then was people didn't even know what Facebook ads were.
[01:27:30] Unknown Host: So maybe it works to some degree better now.
[01:27:33] Unknown Host: People have heard the word.
[01:27:34] Unknown Host: Yeah, you worked pretty early.
[01:27:35] Chris Kerner: Yeah, it was 2015 or something.
[01:27:38] Unknown Host: So it was quite rough, but it was a business nonetheless.
[01:27:41] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:27:42] Unknown Host: And there was 40 other people in the room with me and that cool center doing it.
[01:27:44] Unknown Host: Wow.
[01:27:45] So that's the first idea you have.
[01:27:46] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:27:47] Chris Kerner: What else?
[01:27:48] Chris Kerner: 500 dollars, what else could you do?
[01:27:49] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[01:27:50] Chris Kerner: Do you want a physical business or an online business?
[01:27:53] Chris Kerner: It doesn't not matter.
[01:27:54] Chris Kerner: What about a physical one?
[01:27:55] Chris Kerner: All right.
[01:27:56] Chris Kerner: For a physical one, I would have you heard of drop servicing?
[01:28:00] Chris Kerner: No.
[01:28:01] Unknown Host: So the phrase drop shipping is kind of as a bad rap.
[01:28:04] Chris Kerner: And some of it for good reason, which is basically buying a product in China, having a website
[01:28:10] Chris Kerner: for it, and basically having the Chinese manufacturer, the supplier ship it directly to your customer.
[01:28:15] Chris Kerner: So you don't have to take possession of the inventory, right?
[01:28:17] Chris Kerner: drop servicing is doing something similar with a service.
[01:28:21] Chris Kerner: Let's call it a home service business, right?
[01:28:23] Chris Kerner: So in this case, it would look like a garage repair company that has a website that looks
[01:28:29] Chris Kerner: like they have a physical presence in a market, but it's really just a lead gen factory, right?
[01:28:34] Chris Kerner: And so what you're doing is you're using Facebook or Google ads to generate leads kind
[01:28:38] Chris Kerner: of like what you were doing on Facebook for a local business.
[01:28:42] Chris Kerner: And then you're instead of just selling the leads for $20, you're actually doing more
[01:28:48] Chris Kerner: of the work.
[01:28:49] Chris Kerner: You're you're subcontracting out the work to a local business that actually repairs garage
[01:28:53] Chris Kerner: doors.
[01:28:54] Chris Kerner: They're the fulfillment arm of the business.
[01:28:56] Chris Kerner: You're the marketing arm of the business.
[01:28:58] Chris Kerner: So in essence, you have a garage repair business without actually having one.
[01:29:03] Chris Kerner: Like you don't know anything about garage doors.
[01:29:05] Chris Kerner: You've never been on site.
[01:29:06] Chris Kerner: You're just drop servicing.
[01:29:08] Chris Kerner: You're sending all the work to a local company to do it.
[01:29:10] Chris Kerner: So I a car repair company, I put up a car repair website.
[01:29:16] Unknown Host: I use Facebook ads to drive people towards it.
[01:29:18] Unknown Host: When they click to buy my car repair, I call a local car repair person and say, hey, I've
[01:29:24] Unknown Host: got a customer here for you.
[01:29:26] Unknown Host: Can you take them?
[01:29:27] Unknown Host: I book the customer in.
[01:29:29] Unknown Host: They handle the car repair.
[01:29:30] Unknown Host: I take the payment and pay the garage.
[01:29:32] Unknown Host: Yep.
[01:29:33] Unknown Host: Great question.
[01:29:34] Chris Kerner: So let's just say in your example, an oil change at some at Bob's car repair that
[01:29:39] Chris Kerner: doesn't have a website is 40 bucks, which is a great price.
[01:29:42] Chris Kerner: Your website is clean.
[01:29:43] Chris Kerner: It's nice.
[01:29:44] Chris Kerner: They can pay with a few clicks and it's 80 bucks, right?
[01:29:47] Chris Kerner: So you call Bob one day and say, hey, congratulations.
[01:29:50] Chris Kerner: I have a lead.
[01:29:51] Chris Kerner: I don't have a lead.
[01:29:52] Chris Kerner: I have a customer.
[01:29:53] Chris Kerner: I want to send you $40.
[01:29:54] Chris Kerner: Her name is Mary.
[01:29:55] Chris Kerner: She's going to be coming in.
[01:29:56] Chris Kerner: She has a Sequoia.
[01:29:57] Chris Kerner: She needs an oil change, right?
[01:29:59] Chris Kerner: And so Mary just interacts with you.
[01:30:01] Chris Kerner: She's trusting you with the money.
[01:30:02] Chris Kerner: You don't have to trust Bob with the money.
[01:30:04] Chris Kerner: You just send Bob the money.
[01:30:06] Chris Kerner: You make even more margin than Bob's makes, right?
[01:30:09] Chris Kerner: It's a higher price service, but what you're charging for is the better UI, the better
[01:30:13] Chris Kerner: user experience, and having a cleaner checkout method.
[01:30:18] Unknown Host: And it's a particular types of businesses you would target with that approach.
[01:30:21] Unknown Host: Are you targeting ones that have a shitty customer experience, bad website, et cetera?
[01:30:25] Unknown Host: In the home services, like to take your pick, they pretty much all do, right?
[01:30:30] Chris Kerner: There are some more established industries like roofing that don't have those issues
[01:30:34] Chris Kerner: because they have higher margins so they can afford better websites, but they pretty
[01:30:38] Chris Kerner: much all have a bad experience.
[01:30:40] Any of us at that $500 level that stand out to you?
[01:30:43] Unknown Host: Yeah, I love directory websites.
[01:30:46] Chris Kerner: What's that?
[01:30:47] Chris Kerner: So, travelosity is a directory website.
[01:30:49] Chris Kerner: Yelp is a directory website.
[01:30:51] Chris Kerner: It's a website with a list of things that helps people find answers to their questions
[01:30:56] Chris Kerner: more easily.
[01:30:57] Chris Kerner: So another example of a website could be like, Wisconsin, Ice Suppliers.com.
[01:31:03] Chris Kerner: I don't know if that's a website, right?
[01:31:05] Chris Kerner: Or if I need to go by ice for my party, I'm going to Google Ice Near Me.
[01:31:10] Chris Kerner: Some categories are so niche or so unevenly distributed that Google Maps is not a good
[01:31:14] Chris Kerner: solution for it, right?
[01:31:16] Chris Kerner: So you're directed to these random directory websites that are just lists some other businesses.
[01:31:21] Chris Kerner: And what people are doing is they're proactively creating their own directories by scraping,
[01:31:26] Chris Kerner: let's say, every dog park in Seattle, Washington and putting them on a website.
[01:31:31] Chris Kerner: And then they don't even drive traffic to it.
[01:31:33] Chris Kerner: There's no paid ads.
[01:31:34] Chris Kerner: They just wait for Google and for SEO to do its trick.
[01:31:38] Chris Kerner: And it's very much an 80-20 rule.
[01:31:40] Chris Kerner: You could kind of build the architecture for a directory website with replete or lovable.
[01:31:45] Chris Kerner: And then you just copy and paste it, right, in different markets.
[01:31:48] Chris Kerner: So the play here is to have dozens of directory websites and some of them make $0 a month,
[01:31:53] Chris Kerner: some make a few hundred, some make a few thousand.
[01:31:56] Chris Kerner: But it's very passive.
[01:31:57] Chris Kerner: It's like one of those rare things that's passive yet also doesn't need a ton of money
[01:32:01] Chris Kerner: to get started.
[01:32:03] Chris Kerner: Where's the money coming from?
[01:32:04] Chris Kerner: It's the revenue.
[01:32:05] Chris Kerner: Great question.
[01:32:06] You can either do like display ads.
[01:32:08] Chris Kerner: What's a display ad?
[01:32:09] Unknown Host: Just a banner ad on a website.
[01:32:11] Unknown Host: And you having to go and sell that ad to someone that wants to buy it.
[01:32:14] Unknown Host: You would just take Google's like ad network and just put it on your website so you don't
[01:32:18] Unknown Host: have to do anything.
[01:32:20] Unknown Host: So you can just click a button and it'll add to your website, which you'll then pay
[01:32:23] Unknown Host: for.
[01:32:24] Unknown Host: Yep.
[01:32:25] Chris Kerner: Or you could just aggregate those leads like if we had dog parks in Seattle and we see
[01:32:31] Chris Kerner: on our Google analytics that we're driving traffic to this one dog park, then we reach out
[01:32:35] Chris Kerner: to them proactively and say, Hey, you notice all these customers you've been getting?
[01:32:38] Chris Kerner: That's because I put you on my website.
[01:32:40] Chris Kerner: Would you like to pay $300 a year or a month or whatever for priority placement?
[01:32:45] Chris Kerner: Right.
[01:32:46] Chris Kerner: So I like to call this permissionless marketing.
[01:32:48] Chris Kerner: You're just proactively adding these businesses to a website.
[01:32:51] Chris Kerner: They have nothing to lose.
[01:32:52] Chris Kerner: You have nothing to lose.
[01:32:53] Chris Kerner: And then once you see traffic, then you reach out to them and say, Hey, I've been bringing
[01:32:57] Chris Kerner: you more business.
[01:32:58] Chris Kerner: Would you like to start paying for that?
[01:33:01] And how much money can someone hope to make if they execute that strategy well in your
[01:33:05] Unknown Host: view?
[01:33:06] Unknown Host: What's realistic with the directory website?
[01:33:08] Chris Kerner: It could be tens of dollars a month and it could be tens of thousands of dollars a month.
[01:33:12] Chris Kerner: But we're not talking about building another yelp or travel.
[01:33:15] Chris Kerner: This is a zero employee business with that cost almost nothing less than $100 to start.
[01:33:22] Chris Kerner: But it's just a numbers game.
[01:33:23] Chris Kerner: You're not really going to know what directory really hits until months have passed and
[01:33:28] Chris Kerner: until you have a lot of surface area for these experiments.
[01:33:32] Here are a lot of people talking about vending machines online.
[01:33:36] Unknown Host: And I've always been really curious about that.
[01:33:38] Unknown Host: People say you can make money from vending machines.
[01:33:40] Yeah.
[01:33:41] Unknown Host: Could you do that with $500?
[01:33:42] Chris Kerner: Absolutely.
[01:33:43] Chris Kerner: So if we were doing another physical business, I would go to Facebook, Marketplace, and
[01:33:48] Chris Kerner: I would find an existing vending machine for $300 to $400.
[01:33:54] Chris Kerner: That could be a snack or a drink vending machine.
[01:33:57] Chris Kerner: Oftentimes the expensive part of a vending machine is the credit card reader.
[01:34:00] Chris Kerner: It can often cost more or as much as the whole machine itself.
[01:34:04] Chris Kerner: And then I would use $100 to stock the machine with Costco, Costco or Sam's Club is where all
[01:34:09] Chris Kerner: of these operators buy their snacks believe it or not.
[01:34:12] Chris Kerner: And then I just need one business owner to give me a chance to allow me to put the vending
[01:34:16] Chris Kerner: machine in his lobby.
[01:34:17] Chris Kerner: Let's say it's a car repair business.
[01:34:19] Chris Kerner: I can say, hey, I'll pay you $100 a month or hey, I'll split the revenue with you.
[01:34:23] Chris Kerner: I'll give you 30% of the revenue.
[01:34:24] Chris Kerner: And then once I have one, that's the hardest part.
[01:34:27] Chris Kerner: Now you have a track record.
[01:34:28] Chris Kerner: Now you can say, hey, Bob's auto repair makes $700 a month passively because he let me put
[01:34:33] Chris Kerner: this vending machine there.
[01:34:34] Chris Kerner: This is a business that can be passive if you have an employee to restock it.
[01:34:38] Chris Kerner: That is the active part of the business is the restocking and the selling of new locations.
[01:34:43] Chris Kerner: But if you have an ATM, then that becomes even easier because you can outsource all of
[01:34:47] Chris Kerner: the restocking to a cash management company.
[01:34:50] Chris Kerner: How much money could one person hope to make from a vending machine business?
[01:34:53] Unknown Host: And have you ever run this business yourself?
[01:34:55] Unknown Host: I have.
[01:34:56] Chris Kerner: I've actually been in a different part of the vertical.
[01:34:58] Chris Kerner: I've sold vending machines.
[01:35:00] Chris Kerner: I posted a video to Instagram that got tens of millions of views and we started just importing
[01:35:05] Chris Kerner: those vending machines that I was talking about in the video and then selling them to entrepreneurs.
[01:35:10] Chris Kerner: But the level of revenue is, I mean, it's as much as you want to scale it.
[01:35:14] Chris Kerner: I have a friend in San Diego that makes seven years a year on vending machines.
[01:35:19] Chris Kerner: It's snacks and drinks.
[01:35:20] Chris Kerner: Is there an art to good vending machine placement or the right things to sell in the vending
[01:35:24] Unknown Host: machine or anything else?
[01:35:26] Chris Kerner: Yeah, it's funny that you asked that because he said, you know, I'm in San Diego, people
[01:35:30] Chris Kerner: are health conscious here and he tested all these healthy concepts and they all failed.
[01:35:35] Chris Kerner: Like, people want to read those and cook and die, right?
[01:35:38] Chris Kerner: So that's all they have now.
[01:35:39] Chris Kerner: That's where the demand is.
[01:35:41] Chris Kerner: But the biggest needle mover on this is the location.
[01:35:45] Chris Kerner: And it's a matter of testing, back to testing, right?
[01:35:47] Chris Kerner: Testing what types of locations.
[01:35:48] Chris Kerner: He landed on apartment complexes, like apartment lobbies.
[01:35:52] Chris Kerner: He tried auto repair shops and they just weren't high volume.
[01:35:56] Chris Kerner: But it's the type of business, kind of like directories where if you have 100 vending machines,
[01:36:01] Chris Kerner: you're going to have 20 of them that make $3,000 a month each and then you're going to have
[01:36:06] Chris Kerner: 80 of them that make $400 a month each.
[01:36:09] Chris Kerner: But once you find out what types of locations are the most profitable, then you just start
[01:36:13] Chris Kerner: directly reaching out to those types of locations.
[01:36:17] I've just finished writing my third book.
[01:36:19] Unknown Host: I haven't found up the title yet, but I have started walking up some different designs
[01:36:23] Unknown Host: and I've been doing this with Adobe Express, which is one of our sponsors.
[01:36:26] Unknown Host: What I love about Adobe Express is that it makes it so easy for me to obsess over the
[01:36:30] Unknown Host: tiniest details, the typography, the font, the color, the text placement, the stuff that
[01:36:35] Unknown Host: might sound petty to most people, but actually compounds to create something that stands
[01:36:39] Unknown Host: out, something that's one better than the rest.
[01:36:43] Unknown Host: And designing my cover art has reminded me of how many creative things I've learnt over
[01:36:46] Unknown Host: the year, but it's also reminded me that there are so many creative minds around me that
[01:36:50] Unknown Host: are also sitting on their own secrets.
[01:36:52] Unknown Host: So I've created the one better guide in Adobe Express to bring those tips to you.
[01:36:57] Unknown Host: And in it, you'll find principles from the very, very best in their industry turned
[01:37:01] Unknown Host: into quick and easy practices for you to apply.
[01:37:04] Unknown Host: So you can train yourself to create exactly like the best performing teams in the world
[01:37:07] Unknown Host: do.

[01:37:20] Unknown Host: You know, every once in a while, you come across a product that has such a huge impact on
[01:37:24] Unknown Host: your life that you'd probably describe it as a game changer.
[01:37:28] Unknown Host: And I would say for about 35 to 40% of my team, they would currently describe this product
[01:37:35] Unknown Host: that I have in front of me called keytone IQ, which you can get at keytone.com as a game
[01:37:41] Unknown Host: changer.
[01:37:42] Unknown Host: But the reason I became a co-owner of this company and the reason why they now are responsive
[01:37:45] Unknown Host: to this podcast is because one day when I came to work, there was a box of this stuff set
[01:37:49] Unknown Host: on my desk.
[01:37:50] Unknown Host: I had no idea what it was.
[01:37:51] Unknown Host: Lily in my team says that this company have been in touch.
[01:37:54] Unknown Host: So I went upstairs, tried it, and quite frankly, the rest is history in terms of my focus,
[01:37:59] Unknown Host: my energy levels, how I feel, how I work, how productive I am, game changer.
[01:38:05] Unknown Host: So if you want to give it a try, visit keytone.com slash Stephen for 30% off.

[01:38:17] Unknown Host: shot is completely free of charge.
[01:38:20] So I have another box here.
[01:38:22] This box has slightly more money in double, okay, $1,000.
[01:38:28] Unknown Host: What would you do with $1,000?
[01:38:30] Unknown Host: All right.
[01:38:32] Unknown Host: So for whatever reason when I see $1,000, I think about the wedding rental business.
[01:38:41] Do you know anything about that?
[01:38:43] Chris Kerner: No.
[01:38:44] So believe it or not, weddings are increasing in popularity.
[01:38:48] Chris Kerner: People are getting married outside more than ever.
[01:38:51] Chris Kerner: I think like 75% of weddings are outside now, which is increasing every year.
[01:38:57] Chris Kerner: And that increases the market for these random one-off rentals, right?
[01:39:01] Chris Kerner: I read an article on Reddit about a guy that built a wedding arch from his garage with
[01:39:07] Chris Kerner: some two by fours, some lumber.
[01:39:09] Chris Kerner: I think he spent like $200 or $300 to build it.
[01:39:13] Chris Kerner: And he rented out to weddings for like $1,000 per wedding.
[01:39:17] And it's just a piece of wood for the couples to stand under as they say, I do, right?
[01:39:21] Chris Kerner: And so he works with event organizers, wedding organizers to continually rent it to the wedding
[01:39:26] Unknown Host: organizer.
[01:39:27] Unknown Host: Exactly.
[01:39:28] Chris Kerner: He doesn't go through the brides.
[01:39:29] Chris Kerner: He goes through the wedding planners because surface area, they're touching all kinds of
[01:39:33] Chris Kerner: weddings on a regular basis.
[01:39:35] Chris Kerner: To find these wedding planners, you go to the knot, you go to Zola, wedding wire, you scrape
[01:39:41] Chris Kerner: them, and all of their phone numbers and emails and names and businesses are on the website
[01:39:45] Chris Kerner: for everyone to see.
[01:39:47] Chris Kerner: And you just start reaching out.
[01:39:48] Chris Kerner: And one contact could be one wedding a week.
[01:39:51] Chris Kerner: So that could be started.
[01:39:53] Chris Kerner: That could be in the $500 box, right?
[01:39:55] Chris Kerner: You could spend $300 on supplies.
[01:39:59] Chris Kerner: You could spend $100 on scraping all the emails quite cheaply.
[01:40:05] Chris Kerner: And then you could spend $100 on gas.
[01:40:09] Chris Kerner: And then, or let's say another $100 on renting a truck and trailer from Home Depot.
[01:40:14] Chris Kerner: So you have a car.
[01:40:15] Chris Kerner: So you don't have a car, right?
[01:40:17] Chris Kerner: You've got $400 left over to go to a nice meal or to or for Facebook ads.
[01:40:23] Chris Kerner: So photo walls are very popular.
[01:40:26] Chris Kerner: Sharkootary carts, where wedding patrons can make their own Sharkootary board.
[01:40:33] Chris Kerner: You can do custom pizzas at weddings.
[01:40:35] Chris Kerner: You could do wedding arches.
[01:40:39] Chris Kerner: There's a lot of different opportunities there.
[01:40:42] Unknown Host: Weddings and futuros.
[01:40:43] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:40:44] Unknown Host: Because everything you said that I could also apply to.
[01:40:46] Unknown Host: That's true.
[01:40:47] Unknown Host: That's true.
[01:40:48] Unknown Host: They don't seem to be stopping either.
[01:40:50] I guess futuros are going to get more popular with the population.
[01:40:53] Unknown Host: Yep.
[01:40:54] Unknown Host: Continuing to increase.
[01:40:55] What else?
[01:40:56] So wedding rentals is the first one you do with $1,000 anything else?
[01:41:00] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:41:01] Chris Kerner: Should we do an online one?
[01:41:03] Chris Kerner: Sure.
[01:41:04] Chris Kerner: So there's a lot of people nowadays making money with local email newsletters.
[01:41:08] Chris Kerner: Are you very familiar with that?
[01:41:10] Chris Kerner: No.
[01:41:11] Chris Kerner: So basically what you do, we keep coming back.
[01:41:13] Chris Kerner: This is like a big ad for Facebook.
[01:41:15] Chris Kerner: Right?
[01:41:16] Chris Kerner: I swear it's not.
[01:41:17] Chris Kerner: But people are using local Facebook ads.
[01:41:20] Chris Kerner: Let's say you live in Boise, I know.
[01:41:22] Chris Kerner: There's 200,000 people there.
[01:41:23] Chris Kerner: You post a Facebook ad that says, hey, find out what's happening in Boise, I know one email
[01:41:28] Chris Kerner: per week in your inbox.
[01:41:29] Chris Kerner: You can acquire a subscriber for about 50 cents from Facebook or Instagram.
[01:41:36] Chris Kerner: Okay?
[01:41:37] Let's call it a dollar to be more conservative.
[01:41:40] Chris Kerner: Acquire a subscriber for a dollar.
[01:41:42] Chris Kerner: If you sell ads inside that email newsletter, you can charge about 50 cents per month
[01:41:48] Chris Kerner: per subscriber.
[01:41:51] Chris Kerner: So if we had a thousand dollars, I would use a free trial for an email newsletter software
[01:41:58] Chris Kerner: like BI or ConvertKit or any of those.
[01:42:02] Chris Kerner: And so I've already spent zero dollars.
[01:42:04] Chris Kerner: And I would give all $1,000 to meta.
[01:42:07] Chris Kerner: I would set a defined radius in a local area.
[01:42:09] Chris Kerner: Preferably it's where you live, but it doesn't have to be.
[01:42:11] Chris Kerner: It could be on the other side of the world.
[01:42:12] Chris Kerner: I've launched this, I tested this in New Mexico and it worked.
[01:42:16] Chris Kerner: I'd spend a thousand dollars to acquire a thousand subscribers.
[01:42:19] Chris Kerner: And then I would start sending them weekly newsletters.
[01:42:22] Chris Kerner: What's happening in Boise, Idaho?
[01:42:24] Chris Kerner: Discounts in Boise, Idaho, news in Boise, Idaho.
[01:42:27] Chris Kerner: I would not use chat to be to write it.
[01:42:29] Chris Kerner: I would write it myself in my own natural language, whether I'm a good writer or not.
[01:42:33] Chris Kerner: Because it needs to feel personal.
[01:42:35] Chris Kerner: It needs to feel like a local is writing it.
[01:42:38] Chris Kerner: Not like an author or not like chat to be to you.
[01:42:40] Chris Kerner: And then I would use those same subscribers to source sponsors.
[01:42:45] So Bob's car repair owner is potentially in your list.
[01:42:50] Chris Kerner: There are 10% of all adults are business owners, right?
[01:42:53] Chris Kerner: So if I have a thousand email subscribers, a hundred of them are going to be business owners.
[01:42:57] Chris Kerner: Are going to be potential sponsors to my newsletter.
[01:42:59] Chris Kerner: So after a month or so, I'm going to put a send out an email that says, Hey, you're
[01:43:03] Chris Kerner: ad here.
[01:43:04] Chris Kerner: I'd love to sponsor your business.
[01:43:05] Chris Kerner: It's a very relevant market.
[01:43:07] Chris Kerner: It costs $500 per send to send your email.
[01:43:12] Chris Kerner: So then if I spend $1,000 to acquire these customers, I will get that money back within
[01:43:17] Chris Kerner: two months because I'm making $500 a month, 50 cents per subscriber from a thousand newsletter
[01:43:25] Chris Kerner: subscribers.
[01:43:26] And that can scale as much as you want.
[01:43:28] Chris Kerner: If Boise, Idaho is only so big, you copy and paste the template in another city or a
[01:43:32] Chris Kerner: bigger city.
[01:43:33] Chris Kerner: Okay, let's move up then.
[01:43:37] This briefcase has a lot more money in it.
[01:43:42] $5,000.
[01:43:44] Unknown Host: What side house will do you start if you've got $5,000?
[01:43:49] Okay.
[01:43:50] Chris Kerner: So if we've got a sliding scale of active, depressive income, the closer you get to this to $5,000,
[01:43:57] Chris Kerner: the more realistic the passive income becomes.
[01:44:00] Chris Kerner: Okay.
[01:44:01] Chris Kerner: So I'm going to go closer to that.
[01:44:05] Chris Kerner: I love RV parks.
[01:44:07] Chris Kerner: It's an RV park.
[01:44:09] An RV park is one of two things.
[01:44:12] It's a place for someone to live in full time for months or years at a time where they live
[01:44:16] Chris Kerner: in a recreational vehicle in an RV, a camper van.
[01:44:20] Chris Kerner: It could be a fixed income, a retired person, it could be a blue collar worker, it could
[01:44:26] Chris Kerner: be a digital nomad.
[01:44:27] Chris Kerner: Right.
[01:44:28] Chris Kerner: That's kind of the three categories.
[01:44:30] Chris Kerner: The other type of RV park is a recreational, like a more short term RV park that might be
[01:44:36] Chris Kerner: right outside of the Grand Canyon or a popular tourist destination where people are staying
[01:44:41] Chris Kerner: one to four nights at a time.
[01:44:43] Chris Kerner: This is a business I've been in for about seven years.
[01:44:46] Chris Kerner: Now they have very small RV parks out there that are three to ten pad sites that are about
[01:44:53] Chris Kerner: three to ten times more profitable than buying a single family home as a rental.
[01:44:59] Chris Kerner: So I genuinely, I don't understand why people buy single family homes because like buying
[01:45:04] Chris Kerner: a small RV park costs the same, but is significantly more profitable and more flexible because
[01:45:11] Chris Kerner: you have your risk is more distributed amongst five to ten tenants as opposed to one tenant
[01:45:16] Chris Kerner: that could go bankrupt or disappear in the middle of the night.
[01:45:18] Chris Kerner: So with this $5,000, I would call every small RV park in my area, preferably within a three-hour
[01:45:28] Chris Kerner: drive, I would just find them on Google Maps.
[01:45:30] Chris Kerner: This would take a little more time because we can't allocate any of this budget to the
[01:45:34] Chris Kerner: finding of the park.
[01:45:35] Chris Kerner: We've got to do that very manually with our iPhone and our internet connection.
[01:45:40] Chris Kerner: I'm going to find, in my experience, for every 100 parks I find, about two or three of them
[01:45:46] Chris Kerner: can be a really good deal.
[01:45:48] Chris Kerner: So if I get a hundred people on the phone, I know I can find one good deal from that with
[01:45:52] Chris Kerner: seller financing because we can't use any of this to buy the park either.
[01:45:55] Chris Kerner: We've got a lot of constraints.
[01:45:57] Chris Kerner: I'm going to use, let's say, $2,000 of these dollars from my due diligence.
[01:46:05] Chris Kerner: I've got to get inspections on the park.
[01:46:07] Chris Kerner: I've got to get a title policy on the park to make sure it's on a scam, to make sure that
[01:46:11] Chris Kerner: the owner who says they own it actually owns it.
[01:46:15] Chris Kerner: And then with the remainder of the money, I need some operating capital.
[01:46:20] Chris Kerner: I need to be able to pay the power bill to maybe trim some trees to get the park looking
[01:46:25] Chris Kerner: nice on day one.
[01:46:26] Chris Kerner: And then to actually buy the park, I need to set up creative financing with the seller.
[01:46:31] Chris Kerner: And the best way you can do that is by building a relationship with the seller, building some
[01:46:34] Chris Kerner: trust with them, showing them that you're going to take good care of the park.
[01:46:38] Chris Kerner: Now the unit economics on this, let's say you buy a park for $200,000 in the real estate
[01:46:44] Chris Kerner: world, they're valued on a cap rate basis, which is the profit of the park divided by
[01:46:49] Chris Kerner: the asking price of the park.
[01:46:52] Chris Kerner: So if I buy a park for a 10% cap rate, that means it's going to make $20,000 a year of
[01:47:00] Chris Kerner: profit and it's going to cost me $200,000.
[01:47:04] Chris Kerner: So that park probably has no website.
[01:47:07] Chris Kerner: It probably has way under market rents.
[01:47:10] Chris Kerner: It probably has occupancy issues because there has no website.
[01:47:14] Chris Kerner: They're not doing anything.
[01:47:15] Chris Kerner: So I'm going to get the park to perform by literally posting ads on Facebook Marketplace,
[01:47:23] Chris Kerner: free ads, making a free website with a vibe coding app and increasing the occupancy.
[01:47:29] Chris Kerner: And that $20,000 a year goes to $30,000 a year.
[01:47:34] Chris Kerner: And the park is worth an 8% cap rate.
[01:47:37] Chris Kerner: You bought it undervalued at 10%.
[01:47:39] Chris Kerner: So it's now a $360,000 park that you pay $200,000 for.
[01:47:45] Chris Kerner: So you can either sell it or you can just manage it and enjoy the profits.
[01:47:50] Chris Kerner: When you said, sell a financing, what does that mean?
[01:47:53] Unknown Host: That means the seller is holding the note.
[01:47:56] Chris Kerner: They are bearing the risk of you buying the park.
[01:48:00] Chris Kerner: But what's in it for them is a, they can get the park back if you default.
[01:48:05] Unknown Host: Okay, so then not actually giving you the park up front.
[01:48:08] Unknown Host: They're letting you have it today on the basis that you'll pay them in the future with
[01:48:11] Unknown Host: profits you make.
[01:48:13] Unknown Host: Exactly.
[01:48:14] Chris Kerner: So you're making monthly payments to them because oftentimes they're going to take that
[01:48:18] Chris Kerner: money that you give them and they're going to have to invest in something else, something
[01:48:21] Chris Kerner: they don't understand.
[01:48:22] Chris Kerner: So your pitch to them is, hey, you know this park better than anyone, right?
[01:48:26] Chris Kerner: You know what I can do to fix it.
[01:48:28] Chris Kerner: You know what the deficiencies are.
[01:48:30] Chris Kerner: If for some reason I'm not who I say, I am, you just get it back.
[01:48:33] Chris Kerner: You take it back and you where you started and you keep all the money that I paid you
[01:48:35] Chris Kerner: some so far.
[01:48:36] Chris Kerner: How much money have you made from doing this?
[01:48:39] I've made net profit probably four to $600,000.
[01:48:45] Chris Kerner: Revenue?
[01:48:46] Chris Kerner: I would say between three and four million a year with these RV parks and mobile home parks
[01:48:52] Chris Kerner: as well.
[01:48:53] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:48:54] Chris Kerner: How many of them?
[01:48:55] Chris Kerner: I've been involved with 35 or so over the last seven years.
[01:48:59] What about business?
[01:49:02] Unknown Host: No, I mean, you're capitalizing on baby boomers retiring and on millennials traveling.
[01:49:06] Chris Kerner: And on, yeah, it's just it's a growing market.
[01:49:09] Chris Kerner: People are getting outside more.
[01:49:11] What are the macro things you think about at the moment when you're trying to decide
[01:49:16] Unknown Host: on a new side hustle or a new business system?
[01:49:18] Unknown Host: Are they like obvious macro things that are happening that we should all be thinking
[01:49:21] Unknown Host: about?
[01:49:22] You just can't ignore AI.
[01:49:23] Chris Kerner: Like whatever you're doing, AI has to be part of it.
[01:49:26] Chris Kerner: So I like the framework of implementing new AI tools into old businesses.
[01:49:33] I like the framework that 10,000 baby boomers are retiring every single day.
[01:49:39] Chris Kerner: And that will be the case for the next five to 10 years.
[01:49:41] Chris Kerner: What's your opportunity there to either buy the businesses or to implement AI into the
[01:49:46] Chris Kerner: businesses?
[01:49:47] Chris Kerner: Those are the two biggest opportunities I see.
[01:49:49] Chris Kerner: Let's do.
[01:49:50] Chris Kerner: Get them to give you the business and you run it better in a more digital way.
[01:49:54] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:49:55] Unknown Host: And you pay them off for that business when you've made profit from it.
[01:49:58] Unknown Host: If you don't make the profit, they get their business back.
[01:50:00] Unknown Host: Yes.
[01:50:01] Chris Kerner: So the way finding seller financing on a business is harder than on a piece of real estate,
[01:50:07] Chris Kerner: but it is possible.
[01:50:10] Unknown Host: Of all the businesses you've started, which one has been most profitable?
[01:50:15] Unknown Host: And was the easiest.
[01:50:16] Unknown Host: Oh, man.
[01:50:17] Unknown Host: So like what is the winner?
[01:50:19] I would say either my RV parks business or my Texas snacks business, my e-commerce business.
[01:50:30] Chris Kerner: And they weren't easy because they're easy businesses or industry industries.
[01:50:33] Chris Kerner: They're easy because I had matured enough to a point to find good operators to run those
[01:50:41] Chris Kerner: businesses where I had little to no involvement in them.
[01:50:45] Chris Kerner: That makes sense.
[01:50:46] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:50:47] Unknown Host: You found people to run them for you so that as a starter, they didn't die the minute you
[01:50:50] Unknown Host: got bored.
[01:50:51] Chris Kerner: Exactly.
[01:50:52] Chris Kerner: Whereas they carried on growing and evolving.
[01:50:53] Unknown Host: Right.
[01:50:54] Chris Kerner: Whereas those are both quite hard industries.
[01:50:56] Chris Kerner: E-commerce is quite hard and real estate is as well, but I had good operators.
[01:51:02] Unknown Host: What have you learnt about finding good operations?
[01:51:05] Hmm.
[01:51:07] Oh, man.
[01:51:11] Chris Kerner: It all comes down to trust.
[01:51:16] Chris Kerner: How much trust am I able to put in them?
[01:51:18] Chris Kerner: How much trust do I have them?
[01:51:19] Chris Kerner: I've found a direct correlation between people I know really well and people that have
[01:51:25] Chris Kerner: made really good operators.
[01:51:27] Chris Kerner: How do you incentivize them directly from the profits of the business so that they feel
[01:51:32] more like an entrepreneur, they've got more of a piece of the money.
[01:51:36] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:51:37] Chris Kerner: I made the mistake in my 20s of dangling a carrot of equity too often, genuinely meaning
[01:51:43] Chris Kerner: it.
[01:51:45] But most equity goes to zero.
[01:51:47] Period.
[01:51:48] Chris Kerner: I put a lot more emphasis on cash flow now in my 30s than I do on equity.
[01:51:53] Chris Kerner: I think equity is overrated.
[01:51:55] Chris Kerner: And so nowadays, I'm less likely to give an operating partner equity, not because I
[01:52:00] Chris Kerner: don't think they deserve it, but because it's more likely to go to zero.
[01:52:03] Chris Kerner: And I'm more likely to cut them in on the profits so they can get paid ongoing.
[01:52:07] Chris Kerner: On an annual basis or quarterly basis, etc.
[01:52:10] Unknown Host: Quarterly, yeah.
[01:52:11] Interesting.
[01:52:12] Hmm.
[01:52:13] Is there any side hustles that you've heard about that you wish it started?
[01:52:17] Unknown Host: It's funny because a lot of the ones that I wish I started, I started like a lot of
[01:52:21] Chris Kerner: the 80s that I've done.
[01:52:23] Chris Kerner: I just, it's something that I thought about for two weeks.
[01:52:25] Chris Kerner: I can't get out of my head and I just, I have to get it out of my head.
[01:52:28] Chris Kerner: And so if I start something and it fails, I don't really care because I don't invest a
[01:52:33] Chris Kerner: lot of money into it.
[01:52:34] Chris Kerner: And I answered the question.
[01:52:35] Chris Kerner: I don't have to like, stab at night wondering if that thing would have worked anymore.
[01:52:39] Chris Kerner: Sometimes I'll like run these tests on Facebook that show me such amazing results that just
[01:52:44] Chris Kerner: kind of unlock an opportunity for me.
[01:52:47] Chris Kerner: Can I give you an analogy?
[01:52:48] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:52:49] Chris Kerner: Have you ever been deep sea fishing?
[01:52:50] Not deep sea fishing, no.
[01:52:52] Unknown Host: Okay.
[01:52:53] Chris Kerner: I was a real story.
[01:52:54] I was out deep sea fishing and we were just throwing lures and we weren't getting any,
[01:52:59] Chris Kerner: any bites.
[01:53:00] Chris Kerner: And the captain reaches in under the seat and he pulls out straws from McDonald's.
[01:53:06] Chris Kerner: McDonald's straws specifically because they have red and yellow stripes along the side
[01:53:10] Chris Kerner: of them.
[01:53:11] Chris Kerner: And he pulled out scissors and he started cutting them into fourths.
[01:53:14] And then he, he took the hook off the line and he, he put the string through the straw
[01:53:19] Chris Kerner: and then he tied the hook back on.
[01:53:21] He's like, I know, seems crazy.
[01:53:23] Chris Kerner: Just stick with me and we cast it out and we started getting bites.
[01:53:26] And I'm like, what?
[01:53:27] Chris Kerner: It was the same place with the same lure, same hook, which is just a straw.
[01:53:31] Chris Kerner: And I'm like, what?
[01:53:32] Chris Kerner: Why does this work?
[01:53:34] Chris Kerner: And he's like, it's the colors.
[01:53:37] Chris Kerner: It's like the white and the red and it just spins as you reel it in and it mimics a fish.
[01:53:42] Chris Kerner: And I was like, how did you learn this?
[01:53:44] Chris Kerner: Like what made you think to try this?
[01:53:46] Chris Kerner: He's like, I don't know.
[01:53:48] Chris Kerner: Maybe alcohol was involved?
[01:53:49] Chris Kerner: I don't know.
[01:53:50] Chris Kerner: Like that worked and we started catching fish the rest of the day.
[01:53:53] Chris Kerner: So it just got me thinking like entrepreneurship is this massive ocean with millions of varieties
[01:53:59] Chris Kerner: of fish, billions of fish, some sharks, some minnows.
[01:54:02] Chris Kerner: And so many of us go out there and we cast a few times and we just go back home.
[01:54:06] Chris Kerner: Like entrepreneurship doesn't work.
[01:54:07] Chris Kerner: It's not for me.
[01:54:08] Chris Kerner: Back to the 9 to 5.
[01:54:09] Chris Kerner: But we're not testing enough stuff.
[01:54:11] Chris Kerner: There's different depths, there's different baits.
[01:54:13] Chris Kerner: We could spray something on it to make it smell different.
[01:54:15] Chris Kerner: We could put a McDonald's straw on it.
[01:54:17] Chris Kerner: Occasionally we'll find something, we'll get a bite.
[01:54:20] Maybe we won't get another bite for another hour, but the bite is a signal and it's like,
[01:54:24] oh, there's something there.
[01:54:25] Chris Kerner: Okay, let's try that again but try this.
[01:54:27] Chris Kerner: Or maybe let's just cast a hundred more times.
[01:54:29] Chris Kerner: And then you get a fish and then you get a bigger fish.
[01:54:31] Chris Kerner: And like the more you're out there, not just focusing on one type of fishing, but increasing
[01:54:36] Chris Kerner: your surface area and trying all kinds of different things, the more you learn.
[01:54:41] Chris Kerner: Like the more you test and like now you have a bunch of sharks in the boat and you have this
[01:54:45] Chris Kerner: and you have this and you have all these options at your disposal.
[01:54:47] Chris Kerner: We're eating shark tonight.
[01:54:48] Chris Kerner: We're eating group or we're eating snapper.
[01:54:50] Chris Kerner: You have this amazing life that's dynamic and full of color and all these other awesome
[01:54:55] Chris Kerner: things are coming into play because you stayed out there and you didn't just do one thing.
[01:54:58] Chris Kerner: You tried all these other things.
[01:55:01] Chris Kerner: So that's how I look at business.
[01:55:02] Chris Kerner: Like I'm out there on the ocean testing other things and even if I don't catch anything,
[01:55:06] Chris Kerner: it's fun.
[01:55:07] Chris Kerner: And I think other people should try that too.
[01:55:09] Chris Kerner: A lot of people want sexy stuff, didn't they?
[01:55:11] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:55:12] They want to build the next Facebook or they want to do a chat GPT or the AI app that
[01:55:16] Unknown Host: does this that and the other.
[01:55:19] Do you think that's in part a trap for the average person to be aiming at sexy?
[01:55:24] Yeah.
[01:55:25] Chris Kerner: Because the fact that everyone wants sexy means the fact that the sexy things are the most
[01:55:28] Chris Kerner: competitive.
[01:55:29] Chris Kerner: It's the exact reason why we should go as unsexy as possible because no one's looking
[01:55:34] Chris Kerner: at it.
[01:55:35] And looking forward, Chris, what is, is there anything that you're mulling over now in
[01:55:41] Unknown Host: terms of new business ideas, but you could give me?
[01:55:44] Man, lately it's been about stuff I can launch with my content.
[01:55:50] Chris Kerner: I love the phrase unfair advantage.
[01:55:54] Chris Kerner: I will only start businesses today where I have an unfair advantage.
[01:55:58] Everyone has an unfair advantage in something.
[01:56:00] Chris Kerner: Even a 13-year-old has an unfair advantage.
[01:56:03] Chris Kerner: They might know row blocks better than anyone.
[01:56:07] Chris Kerner: So unfair advantage is not only for the rich or the wealthy or the elite or the most
[01:56:11] Chris Kerner: experienced or the PhDs.
[01:56:13] Chris Kerner: So I try to start businesses where I have an unfair advantage.
[01:56:16] Chris Kerner: That might be because I can grow it with my content.
[01:56:19] Chris Kerner: It might be because I have a bunch of friends in that space or have a unique knowledge or
[01:56:22] Chris Kerner: insight into that space.
[01:56:25] If I have a zillion ideas and a spreadsheet a mile long with a bunch of business ideas,
[01:56:29] Chris Kerner: the ones I'm most likely to start are the ones where I have an unfair advantage.
[01:56:32] Chris Kerner: Right, to win.
[01:56:33] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:56:34] Chris Kerner: I have this phrase called moralical opportunity, which I use.
[01:56:41] Unknown Host: When I look at an industry that never seems to work for anybody, but seems so obvious.
[01:56:47] Unknown Host: Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:56:48] Yeah, I do.
[01:56:49] Unknown Host: I'm thinking of something.
[01:56:50] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[01:56:51] Unknown Host: And this has been a bit of a way for me to know what not to work on is if I see everybody
[01:56:55] Unknown Host: trying to solve this particular problem and nobody's been successful, yet more and more
[01:56:59] Unknown Host: people are plowing in.
[01:57:00] Unknown Host: And yeah, it seems obvious to me I just stay away from it.
[01:57:02] Unknown Host: Because there's something in my understanding of consumer behavior or current alternatives
[01:57:09] Unknown Host: that I'm like misunderstanding.
[01:57:12] Unknown Host: An example I'll give you.
[01:57:14] Everyone at the moment is trying to start a...
[01:57:17] Unknown Host: So this is the first sort of first principles they're reasoning up from.
[01:57:20] Unknown Host: They're saying people are more lonely than ever before.
[01:57:23] Unknown Host: They're saying there's no clear place to organize a group of people.
[01:57:29] Unknown Host: WhatsApp has its limitations, its restrictions, doesn't have the feature set one would like,
[01:57:35] Unknown Host: Facebook groups aren't working for a certain generation of people anymore for sort of
[01:57:38] Unknown Host: gencies and younger generations millennials.
[01:57:41] Unknown Host: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make an app for groups.
[01:57:44] Unknown Host: You run club, your friends, your piano, recital group, your entrepreneurs, we're going to
[01:57:50] Unknown Host: build all the group features into this app.
[01:57:51] Unknown Host: And it's going to be dedicated to that.
[01:57:54] Unknown Host: I've heard this pitch over and over again.
[01:57:55] Unknown Host: I've seen all of them seem to have any traction or work.
[01:57:58] Unknown Host: It's a mirage, something fundamental about your assumptions is off.
[01:58:02] Yeah.
[01:58:03] When I said mirage opportunities, did you think of anything in particular?
[01:58:06] Unknown Host: I stay away.
[01:58:07] Unknown Host: I stay away from businesses where I don't know why it's not working, but clearly it's
[01:58:12] Unknown Host: not working.
[01:58:13] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:58:14] Chris Kerner: I think of banking or healthcare.
[01:58:15] Chris Kerner: Banking is terrible.
[01:58:17] Chris Kerner: Look at the UI at Bank of America.
[01:58:18] Chris Kerner: It's probably like that for a reason.
[01:58:22] Chris Kerner: Or Amazon's UI is terrible.
[01:58:24] Chris Kerner: They probably know why it looks like that.
[01:58:27] Chris Kerner: I assume they're smarter than I am.
[01:58:29] Chris Kerner: One idea that I thought of is everyone hates typing in their password as many times
[01:58:32] Chris Kerner: today.
[01:58:33] Chris Kerner: You have these password managers, but I've seen a dozen companies that are going to fix
[01:58:37] Chris Kerner: the password, right?
[01:58:38] Chris Kerner: Some like replacement to a password and they've all failed.
[01:58:42] It's probably because it's a really hard problem to solve.
[01:58:45] Chris Kerner: I don't want to try to invest in a person that's trying to solve it because statistics
[01:58:48] Chris Kerner: are not on their side.
[01:58:50] Another one that comes to mind for me is at university, every entrepreneurial college
[01:58:53] Unknown Host: kid decides that they're going to build a on-campus, what's going on app, to let everybody know
[01:58:58] Chris Kerner: what's going on on campus.
[01:59:00] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[01:59:01] Unknown Host: They never seem to work.
[01:59:03] Yeah.
[01:59:04] Unknown Host: They don't work is because both you're losing 33% of your potential customers every year
[01:59:08] Unknown Host: and getting 33% new customers every year.
[01:59:10] Unknown Host: So you have a bit of an acquisition problem.
[01:59:12] Unknown Host: But then also people don't decide what they're going to do based on some notice board.
[01:59:15] Unknown Host: They decide based on their dorm room friends and where they're going and where the girl
[01:59:19] Unknown Host: they like is going.
[01:59:21] Unknown Host: And so it's not really about what's going on.
[01:59:23] Unknown Host: It's like what does my group of people want to do?
[01:59:25] Unknown Host: I think that's the mirage in that.
[01:59:29] Unknown Host: I thought of another example.
[01:59:30] Unknown Host: That's like building apps around podcasting.
[01:59:32] Chris Kerner: Oh my God.
[01:59:33] Yeah.
[01:59:34] Chris Kerner: Right.
[01:59:35] Chris Kerner: I have a friend that he had a podcast.
[01:59:36] Chris Kerner: A great one that helped podcasters.
[01:59:38] Chris Kerner: Right.
[01:59:39] Chris Kerner: And it was great.
[01:59:40] Chris Kerner: Like really I listened to it.
[01:59:42] Chris Kerner: And he realized over time like I'm selling to a market that quits.
[01:59:47] Chris Kerner: Right.
[01:59:48] Chris Kerner: I'm asking for customers to pay for my thing that are statistically like 95% of them
[01:59:51] Chris Kerner: are going to quit within six months.
[01:59:54] Chris Kerner: So it's just a broken market to sell to it.
[01:59:56] Chris Kerner: And then the 5% that are successful, what percentage of them are actually profitable, what
[02:00:00] Chris Kerner: percentage of them can afford to pay for an expensive agency or software?
[02:00:04] Chris Kerner: Very few.
[02:00:05] More around opportunities.
[02:00:08] Unknown Host: I like that.
[02:00:09] Unknown Host: I would, yeah, it's been a really useful framework because it's the obvious ones that
[02:00:13] Unknown Host: no one's doing.
[02:00:14] Unknown Host: But there's clearly a huge opportunity that I think pulls people in the most.
[02:00:19] Unknown Host: But for me now with the amount of time I've spent starting businesses, those are the
[02:00:24] Unknown Host: ones that push me away the most.
[02:00:25] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[02:00:26] Chris Kerner: It all comes back to the value of just copying what's already working.
[02:00:29] Chris Kerner: Amen.
[02:00:30] Is there anything we haven't talked about that we should have talked about Chris?
[02:00:33] Unknown Host: For young and old people that are considering starting their own business, their inside
[02:00:38] Unknown Host: hustle, building positive income.
[02:00:42] Chris Kerner: Many of the people that think they want to be an entrepreneur, they just like the idea
[02:00:45] Chris Kerner: of it.
[02:00:46] Chris Kerner: And they think there's freedom and entrepreneurship.
[02:00:48] Chris Kerner: When oftentimes it's even more of a prison than their 95.
[02:00:52] Chris Kerner: It can be at least in the first years.
[02:00:54] Chris Kerner: Not months, not years, sometimes decades, right?
[02:00:57] And so I want people to answer the question for themselves, is this for me?
[02:01:03] Chris Kerner: So they don't regret.
[02:01:05] Chris Kerner: They need to find out if they love the idea of it or they like the actual day to day grind
[02:01:09] Chris Kerner: of it.
[02:01:10] Chris Kerner: Because they probably won't.
[02:01:13] Chris Kerner: But I want them to find out.
[02:01:15] Such an important point because the narrative online at the moment is, you know, beer and
[02:01:19] Unknown Host: boss, etc, etc.
[02:01:21] Unknown Host: And I just, I don't think people, I'm speaking for myself here, I don't want to speak for
[02:01:25] Unknown Host: you, but I don't think people realize how many people I have to answer to.
[02:01:28] Unknown Host: Oh, yeah.
[02:01:29] Unknown Host: I have all of my team members, which is hundreds of people that I have my investors.
[02:01:31] Unknown Host: I have my suppliers, my clients.
[02:01:34] Unknown Host: So it's not like I'm living as a free man.
[02:01:37] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[02:01:38] Unknown Host: I'm less free now than I was before.
[02:01:41] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[02:01:42] What did you start to do all this stuff?
[02:01:43] Unknown Host: Isn't it nice when someone just also just tells you what to do and exactly what path
[02:01:47] Chris Kerner: to take?
[02:01:48] Yeah.
[02:01:49] Chris Kerner: Like my wife does that.
[02:01:50] Chris Kerner: Like, hey, I need you to do this.
[02:01:51] Chris Kerner: It's like, oh, it's so nice.
[02:01:53] Chris Kerner: I don't have to like think like thank you.
[02:01:55] Chris Kerner: You know, so I have bosses and other areas of my life.
[02:01:58] Chris Kerner: And it's really nice.
[02:01:59] Chris Kerner: Like there's something to be set for a 95.
[02:02:01] And some people have no desire to even test an entrepreneurship.
[02:02:03] Chris Kerner: Great.
[02:02:04] Chris Kerner: I'll power to you, but I want people to test it.
[02:02:07] And I think, you know, people would look at someone like me or you and think, oh, you
[02:02:09] Unknown Host: know, they've got total freedom.
[02:02:11] Unknown Host: But this is just not the case.
[02:02:13] Unknown Host: Even for me as a podcaster, you know, I'm now kind of somewhat constrained by the fact
[02:02:18] Unknown Host: that I need to publish on a Monday and I need to publish on Thursday.
[02:02:21] Unknown Host: And that means lots of other work takes place throughout the week.
[02:02:23] Unknown Host: And I can't just go to Hawaii and chill out and spend a month off.
[02:02:27] Unknown Host: And then I've got all my clients now and the team members, et cetera.
[02:02:30] Unknown Host: So I think I'm starting a bit of a war against this idea that independence and total freedom
[02:02:37] Unknown Host: is both something to aim for, but also like realistic when you're pursuing something
[02:02:42] Unknown Host: you love.
[02:02:43] Unknown Host: I think a generation have been solved this idea of independence.
[02:02:46] Unknown Host: And I don't think it's gotten us anywhere.
[02:02:47] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[02:02:48] Unknown Host: So the whole freedom independence, the all the freedom independence, the all the freedom
[02:02:51] Unknown Host: independence that the all the freedom independence that the all the freedom independence
[02:02:52] Unknown Host: that the all the freedom independence that the all the freedom independence that the all
[02:02:54] Unknown Host: the freedom independence that the all the freedom independence that the all the freedom
[02:02:56] Unknown Host: that the all the freedom independence that the all the freedom independence that the all
[02:02:58] Unknown Host: businesses, you've got so much dependency.
[02:03:02] And that's probably the source of much of your happiness.
[02:03:04] Unknown Host: Yeah, exactly. My quote of this year is, there are no solutions only trade
[02:03:08] Chris Kerner: off. That entrepreneurship is not a solution. You're trading something for it.
[02:03:13] Chris Kerner: The question is, is that tradeoff worth it or not? And we won't know until we try it.
[02:03:18] And what's the tradeoff you're making? Stability, lack of volatility.
[02:03:22] Chris Kerner: Yeah, predictability. My life has been volatile and unpredictable.
[02:03:28] Chris Kerner: But the more I do it, the more predictable it becomes in a good way.
[02:03:32] Chris Kerner: But that's been the tradeoff is the mental load of not knowing where my
[02:03:38] Chris Kerner: paycheck's coming from or if it's coming at all.
[02:03:42] It's not for the thing targeted. No.
[02:03:46] Chris, we have an eclipsed in tradition where the last guest leaves a question
[02:03:48] Unknown Host: for the next not knowing who they're leaving it for.
[02:03:50] Unknown Host: And the question of view, I love this question for obvious reasons, is
[02:03:53] Unknown Host: during your interview with Stephen today, what is one thing he did that you genuinely
[02:03:58] Unknown Host: appreciated?
[02:04:04] I would say that I, I appreciate that the questions you asked me got me to look
[02:04:14] Chris Kerner: at the things I've been looking at in one way completely differently.
[02:04:20] I came into this conversation, you know, looking at things in a specific way in
[02:04:26] Chris Kerner: ways that I always have, but your questions got me to approach it from a different
[02:04:29] Chris Kerner: angle that made me learn something more about my own story, if you will.
[02:04:37] And what was that in particular? Was there a specific thing you're thinking
[02:04:41] Unknown Host: about? Maybe just the overall framework that
[02:04:44] Chris Kerner: you're talking about.
[02:04:47] Maybe it's just a recency biased, but just that it's not for everyone.
[02:04:55] It's not for everyone.
[02:04:57] Chris Kerner: And that we just need to learn if the trade-offs are worth it.
[02:05:02] There's an element of your personal trauma experiences upbringing, insecurities,
[02:05:08] Unknown Host: toxic fuel that makes the trade-offs worth it, that makes you in some respect
[02:05:13] Unknown Host: unreasonable, unrealistic, willing to take the risk.
[02:05:17] Unknown Host: And we don't talk about that enough because we're not able to go into people's
[02:05:20] Unknown Host: trauma and the nuance of their life and childhood and what their dad said to them and
[02:05:23] Unknown Host: what the how they were believed to be able to like trans, trans, transmit into their
[02:05:29] Unknown Host: mind to make that, to figure that out for themselves.
[02:05:31] Unknown Host: But I think probably is in both your life and my life.
[02:05:34] Unknown Host: I mean, you both, we both, I think have ADHD to some degree.
[02:05:37] And we have a brainwired in a certain way.
[02:05:40] So it's not, it can seem like we're making a choice.
[02:05:44] But I, it often doesn't feel like that for me.
[02:05:46] Unknown Host: Does it feel like I'm making a choice?
[02:05:48] Unknown Host: It feels like there is no other choice.
[02:05:50] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[02:05:50] Unknown Host: In the same way that one might make a choice to get a 95 job.
[02:05:55] I have, I think for me, that would be a terrible thing.
[02:05:58] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[02:05:59] Unknown Host: And vice versa, probably.
[02:06:00] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[02:06:02] What you just said just brought up a memory.
[02:06:04] Chris Kerner: I don't know if it's relevant to this or not.
[02:06:05] Chris Kerner: But you said ADHD when I was an undergrad, I got tested for ADHD.
[02:06:10] And the psychiatrist said, it was a big report.
[02:06:14] Chris Kerner: I'm summarizing it to the only sentence that I remember.
[02:06:17] Chris Kerner: But she said that I just had delusions of grandeur.
[02:06:21] Right?
[02:06:22] It wasn't like an official diagnosis.
[02:06:23] Chris Kerner: It was one line in like an eight-page document.
[02:06:26] Chris Kerner: But I saw that just like bounce off the page and I was like,
[02:06:29] Chris Kerner: how do you know that's a delusion?
[02:06:31] Chris Kerner: Right?
[02:06:32] Chris Kerner: Like it's only a delusion if enough time has passed so we could look back and say,
[02:06:36] Chris Kerner: yeah, he was wrong.
[02:06:37] Chris Kerner: He was way off base.
[02:06:38] Chris Kerner: By delusions of grandeur, what does she mean?
[02:06:41] Unknown Host: She means like I had unrealistic expectations about how my life would turn out.
[02:06:48] And that was causing strife in my personal relationships.
[02:06:53] And I thought it was wrong.
[02:06:54] I still think it was wrong.
[02:06:56] Chris Kerner: But it put a chip on my shoulder.
[02:06:57] Chris Kerner: It planted a seed that I never forgot.
[02:06:59] Chris Kerner: I have that printed.
[02:07:00] Chris Kerner: It's in my drawer at work.
[02:07:03] Chris Kerner: Is it saying?
[02:07:05] Just I just have like literally the report that she gave me back in 2009.
[02:07:10] Chris Kerner: It's like highlighted and drawn up in my in my drawer at work.
[02:07:13] Chris Kerner: And I just look at it sometimes for motivation because what
[02:07:16] Chris Kerner: what is a delusion of grandeur?
[02:07:18] Chris Kerner: Like I have plans of grandeur.
[02:07:20] This is a plan.
[02:07:22] Chris Kerner: And so I think about her sometimes.
[02:07:23] Chris Kerner: She probably has no idea who I am.
[02:07:25] Chris Kerner: She probably forgot all about me.
[02:07:26] Chris Kerner: But if people want to learn more,
[02:07:30] Unknown Host: where's the best place they should go to check your work out?
[02:07:34] Unknown Host: You've got your podcast on YouTube.
[02:07:37] Unknown Host: It's not necessarily a podcast in the same way that this is a podcast.
[02:07:39] Unknown Host: It's much more practical than specific around specific subject matters.
[02:07:43] Unknown Host: So I highly recommend people go check that out.
[02:07:44] Unknown Host: I'm going to link it below and put it on the screen.
[02:07:46] Unknown Host: But where else?
[02:07:47] Unknown Host: Where's a good place to get in touch with you or to consume your work?
[02:07:50] Unknown Host: Probably tkopod.com.
[02:07:53] Chris Kerner: As in.
[02:07:54] Chris Kerner: Corner office.
[02:07:55] Chris Kerner: It's just like my main website.
[02:07:57] Chris Kerner: And people can sign up here for your news.
[02:08:00] Chris Kerner: My newsletter.
[02:08:01] Chris Kerner: Yep.
[02:08:01] Chris Kerner: I used one email per week.
[02:08:03] Chris Kerner: What'd you send out?
[02:08:05] Chris Kerner: Like a very tactical guide on how to start X, Y, or Z business.
[02:08:09] Chris Kerner: And I asked my audience like what they want to learn about.
[02:08:11] Chris Kerner: So they tell me and then I dive deep and then break it all down for me.
[02:08:15] Chris Kerner: I'll link that as well below for anyone that's interested.
[02:08:17] Unknown Host: What is the most popular, most frequent request you get through that website?
[02:08:22] On business ideas to talk about?
[02:08:24] Chris Kerner: Yeah.
[02:08:25] Probably the AI agency, the AI implementation agency idea that I talked about.
[02:08:31] Chris Kerner: And what is the most viral video you've ever made?
[02:08:34] Oh man, that was about a,
[02:08:38] Chris Kerner: this this Chinese street vendor that sold ice cream.
[02:08:41] Chris Kerner: She had this little contraption.
[02:08:44] Chris Kerner: It was like a frozen cylinder that she poured cream over.
[02:08:47] Chris Kerner: And it would scrape off ice cream in this really visually appealing way.
[02:08:52] Chris Kerner: And so I basically broke down in 30 seconds.
[02:08:54] Chris Kerner: Like you could pay $200 for this.
[02:08:56] Chris Kerner: You could post it at any given street corner.
[02:08:58] Chris Kerner: And you could make $1,000 by the end of the day.
[02:09:01] Chris Kerner: So it's like ABC.
[02:09:02] Chris Kerner: Here's how to get to this revenue.
[02:09:04] Chris Kerner: And like 30 or 40 million people saw it.
[02:09:07] Chris Kerner: I'll put the video on the screen for anyone that's interested in that as well.
[02:09:10] Unknown Host: Just so you know what this ice cream contraption is.
[02:09:13] Unknown Host: Yeah.
[02:09:13] Unknown Host: Chris, thank you so much.
[02:09:15] Thank you so much for being yourself in every respect.
[02:09:17] Unknown Host: You teach me that there's many ways to skin a cat as the saying goes.
[02:09:21] Unknown Host: There's many ways to become successful to be happy to be motivated in your life.
[02:09:23] Unknown Host: There's many ways to become a millionaire.
[02:09:25] Unknown Host: Some of it bucks sort of conventional wisdom of how to grow business.
[02:09:28] Unknown Host: And I think that is actually liberating to know that your own unique wiring
[02:09:32] Unknown Host: and your only unique perspective and Ika guy can drive you to the same outcome of financial freedom.
[02:09:38] Unknown Host: If you do have the self awareness, if you're willing to work hard,
[02:09:40] Unknown Host: and if you can cope with the opinions of others.
[02:09:45] And also if you're willing to sacrifice tremendously,
[02:09:47] Unknown Host: because you have sacrificed tremendously.
[02:09:48] Unknown Host: And especially as someone as a man that has,
[02:09:50] Unknown Host: a young man that has four kids, you've taken on your shoulders a huge amount of risk.
[02:09:54] Unknown Host: And I applaud you for simplifying and demystifying the pursuit of side-house souls and business
[02:10:00] Unknown Host: and entrepreneurship for so many people because I think in the world we live in,
[02:10:04] Unknown Host: it's probably going to become more and more important that people have more options.
[02:10:08] Unknown Host: Great.
[02:10:09] Unknown Host: In a world of AI and if Elon Musk is to be successful in creating the age of abundance that he's
[02:10:13] Unknown Host: describing, then maybe we're all going to end up with entrepreneurs who knows.
[02:10:17] Unknown Host: Who knows?
[02:10:18] Unknown Host: Thank you.
[02:10:18] Unknown Host: Chris, thank you.
