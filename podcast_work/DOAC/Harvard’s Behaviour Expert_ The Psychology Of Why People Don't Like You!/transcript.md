[00:00:00] People really care about what's making them disliked and they really want to know how to be liked.
[00:00:04] Stephen Bartlett: Okay, so first this is an exercise that I do in my class at Harvard called 10 questions to fall in like.
[00:00:09] Allison Wood Brooks: So if I have some of those lessons they're going to like me.
[00:00:11] Stephen Bartlett: It's a great starting point but let's talk about this because they're going to be little clues about
[00:00:16] Allison Wood Brooks: how to be better liked and it's the most teachable, practical, scientifically rigorous framework
[00:00:22] Allison Wood Brooks: in the world for communication. Do you want to hear about it Stephen? Of course I want to hear about it.
[00:00:26] Stephen Bartlett: Don't want to be the most persuasive, influential, likable,
[00:00:29] Stephen Bartlett: talker in the world. So I shall follow your lead. Oh my gosh! It's a lot of power.
[00:00:34] Stephen Bartlett: I love it. I love it so much. Harvard professor Allison Woodbrooks is a behavioral scientist
[00:00:39] Stephen Bartlett: who has spent two decades studying conversational science.
[00:00:42] Allison Wood Brooks: And she's revealing the communication mistakes we all make the art of negotiation
[00:00:46] Stephen Bartlett: and how to get anyone to like you. We all get to adulthood and we feel like
[00:00:51] Allison Wood Brooks: conversation should be easy but as a scientist when you look under the hood we realize this is why
[00:00:55] Allison Wood Brooks: we have so many awkward moments why we say things that we shouldn't why we are boring why we get
[00:01:01] Allison Wood Brooks: angry and hostile and there's very clear strategies to help us with all of that. Like one of my biggest
[00:01:05] Allison Wood Brooks: findings was how we reframe social anxiety as excitement which makes you focus on opportunities
[00:01:10] Allison Wood Brooks: rather than threats and that paper ended up being featured inside out the movie and then
[00:01:14] Allison Wood Brooks: their small talk. I hate small talk. I'm going to help you reframe that because it's really important
[00:01:19] Allison Wood Brooks: but the mistake that people make is that they stay that way too long and they need to move up
[00:01:23] Allison Wood Brooks: this topic pyramid. What about in a digital age do we need to start communicating differently?
[00:01:27] Stephen Bartlett: Yeah there's clear things that we should do to make our text based communication better
[00:01:31] Allison Wood Brooks: and we'll go through all of them. And you said you've done an interesting study recently
[00:01:35] Stephen Bartlett: about male friendship. Yes and it's quite troubling. So how can I make more friends as a man?
[00:01:41] Stephen Bartlett: Yeah let's talk about that.
[00:01:45] I see messages all the time in the comments section that some of you didn't realize you didn't
[00:01:49] Stephen Bartlett: subscribe. So if you could do me a favor and double check if you're a subscriber to this channel
[00:01:53] Stephen Bartlett: that would be tremendously appreciated. It's the simple, it's the free thing that anybody that
[00:01:57] Stephen Bartlett: watches the show frequently can do to help us here to keep everything going in the show
[00:02:01] Stephen Bartlett: in the trajectory it's on. So please do double check if you subscribed and thank you so much
[00:02:06] Stephen Bartlett: because there's a strange way you are you're part of our history and you're on this journey
[00:02:10] Stephen Bartlett: with us and I appreciate you for that so yeah thank you.
[00:02:20] Professor Allison Wood Brooks. What is it that you do and why do you think it matters so much to
[00:02:27] Stephen Bartlett: the world? I am a professor at Harvard and I'm a behavioral scientist. I study how people talk to
[00:02:35] Allison Wood Brooks: each other and how they can do it better. I teach a course that I created there called Talk.
[00:02:41] Allison Wood Brooks: I wrote a book about it also called Talk, the Science of Conversation and the Art of Being
[00:02:46] Allison Wood Brooks: Ourselves. And if someone's chosen to listen to this conversation now they've just clicked on it
[00:02:51] Stephen Bartlett: and they're thinking you know should I stay or should I should I go? What promise can we give them
[00:02:56] Stephen Bartlett: if they stay and listen to this conversation that is based on the work you've done in your book
[00:03:00] Stephen Bartlett: and all the research you've done. What is it that you think the average person can come away with that
[00:03:04] Stephen Bartlett: will have a meaningful impact on their day-to-day life? All of life is about relationships
[00:03:10] Allison Wood Brooks: and relationships are about talking so if they can learn even one strategy that helps them in
[00:03:17] Allison Wood Brooks: their conversations it will massively improve their lives. If you think of everything from work to
[00:03:23] Allison Wood Brooks: romantic relationships, friendships, productivity, all of it hinges on having excellent conversations.
[00:03:31] Allison Wood Brooks: But conversations are easy right? We all feel that way. We all get to adulthood and we feel like
[00:03:38] Allison Wood Brooks: conversation should be easy because we started learning how to do it when we were one and a half
[00:03:44] Allison Wood Brooks: years old as toddlers and we practice doing it with an enormous number of partners, conversation
[00:03:51] Allison Wood Brooks: partners every day of our lives. So by the time we become adults it feels like we should be experts
[00:03:57] Allison Wood Brooks: like we should be great at it. But as a scientist when you look under the hood and you see oh my
[00:04:03] Allison Wood Brooks: goodness all of the complexity that's happening under the hood you realize oh this is why we have
[00:04:08] Allison Wood Brooks: so many awkward moments why we say things that we shouldn't why we don't say things that we should,
[00:04:13] Allison Wood Brooks: why we hurt each other why we get defensive why we are boring why we get angry and hostile
[00:04:20] Allison Wood Brooks: and there are very clear strategies to help us with all of that. As you were saying that I was
[00:04:25] Stephen Bartlett: thinking do you think there's a lot of people that are going through life giving off the wrong
[00:04:29] Stephen Bartlett: impression because they don't know how to talk maybe they are disliked maybe they are misunderstood
[00:04:35] Stephen Bartlett: because they haven't mastered the science of how to have a great conversation.
[00:04:39] Stephen Bartlett: On my worst days I worry that everybody's walking around being misunderstood. When you think about
[00:04:45] Allison Wood Brooks: talking even as I'm talking right now there's no way to take the entire contents of your mind and
[00:04:51] Allison Wood Brooks: all of your personality and say it out loud and so we're always curating we're always choosing what
[00:04:58] some subset of stuff to share with other people through conversation and no one is doing that
[00:05:05] Allison Wood Brooks: perfectly and I fear that many people are really struggling with it.
[00:05:09] Allison Wood Brooks: If you had to pinpoint just a few things that people want when they think about becoming a great
[00:05:16] Stephen Bartlett: conversationist like what is it that we actually are aiming at is it to be you know what is that?
[00:05:21] Stephen Bartlett: Yeah usually people want to be liked even loved usually we want to enjoy our conversations to
[00:05:28] Allison Wood Brooks: not have them be miserable we want to feel safe and protected and not have it be dreadful and
[00:05:34] Allison Wood Brooks: time consuming and we want to achieve professional goals so advancing and achieving and making
[00:05:39] Allison Wood Brooks: great decisions. So already the very basic drives of what people are trying to achieve in conversation
[00:05:46] Allison Wood Brooks: are actually a little bit more complicated than just like oh we're looking for connection
[00:05:51] and then when you really dig into it within all of the goals that people want in those categories
[00:05:57] Allison Wood Brooks: it's like a vast constellation of of motives. I would like you to teach me how to talk really really
[00:06:03] Stephen Bartlett: well. I don't know if you need my help that much Stephen but I'd love to even the best communicators
[00:06:08] Allison Wood Brooks: of room for improvement. No I think I do. I was thinking about this last week and all the
[00:06:14] Stephen Bartlett: conversations I've had had the different types of conversations. I had one conversation where I
[00:06:19] Stephen Bartlett: met someone's family for the first time who works with me and it was you know it was a little bit
[00:06:24] Stephen Bartlett: nerve-racking because that contact you know people have have these moments where they meet the in-laws
[00:06:29] Stephen Bartlett: or whatever they meet for me it's often meeting someone who works with me's family I find quite
[00:06:33] Stephen Bartlett: nerve-racking because I think they're kind of really judging me. I've also had difficult business
[00:06:37] Stephen Bartlett: conversations. Because they are judging. Yeah they are judging me and I can feel it and as I go towards
[00:06:42] Stephen Bartlett: those conversations I'm like I'm going to go to the the the the the the the the the the the the
[00:06:44] Stephen Bartlett: and then I end up just like freezing or being a little bit paralyzed and you think is someone like
[00:06:48] Stephen Bartlett: me who does this for a living living finds conversations easy I absolutely do not. I actually the more
[00:06:54] Allison Wood Brooks: you know I talk to very high-level C-suite very successful people and in fact the higher and more
[00:07:02] Allison Wood Brooks: successful people are the more likely they are to be aware that this is really important
[00:07:08] Allison Wood Brooks: and that they have room for improvement. It's almost like you're aware that this skill is probably
[00:07:13] Allison Wood Brooks: what helped you get where you are and therefore you want to get even better at it and you're keenly
[00:07:19] Allison Wood Brooks: aware of when you have awkward moments or make mistakes or missed steps and you're like I would
[00:07:23] Allison Wood Brooks: really like to get that out of my life please. Amen I'm like ruminate on an awkward encounter I had
[00:07:28] Stephen Bartlett: like two and a half weeks ago. Of course. I should have just did it but actually in reading some of
[00:07:32] Stephen Bartlett: your work I thought about what I could have done and we'll get to this this idea of preparing for
[00:07:37] Stephen Bartlett: those moments which I typically don't because I assume I should be a natural. Can I ask you as you
[00:07:41] Allison Wood Brooks: were talking about these different examples of things that you're ruminating about do you feel like
[00:07:47] Allison Wood Brooks: you have a weakness or like a recurring thing that you suspect you need to get better at?
[00:07:55] Allison Wood Brooks: I think one of them is I am a bit of an introvert in my sort of self-classification and as people
[00:08:02] Stephen Bartlett: know who I am or in the world I think I've become more introverted. So and sometimes that can
[00:08:07] Stephen Bartlett: be perceived in the wrong way so my like happy state is kind of being alone or around people that
[00:08:12] Stephen Bartlett: I'm extremely familiar with. If I leave the house and I go say to a gym or something I have a little
[00:08:17] Stephen Bartlett: bit of paranoia. So I'm always kind of on edge which means that this kind of shuts me down more so
[00:08:22] Stephen Bartlett: when I do have conversations I can sometimes appear to be a bit more shut down. I don't want to
[00:08:26] Stephen Bartlett: carry that into moments where I need to be a bit more open and then I would say generally I just
[00:08:33] Stephen Bartlett: like hate small talk. Yeah you're not alone there. This is why I think I podcast because you can
[00:08:38] Stephen Bartlett: just get straight into the deep stuff and I can ask people about their trauma. You can do that
[00:08:42] Allison Wood Brooks: in normal conversations too actually. Do you find that you get stuck in small talk? Yes.
[00:08:47] Allison Wood Brooks: A good bit. I just try and avoid it. So I've got this funny story. One of the most that the most
[00:08:52] Stephen Bartlett: prestigious people on planet earth invited me to come to a thing and I said no because there would
[00:08:56] Stephen Bartlett: be a hundred other people there and I just didn't want to be in a room for four hours with a bunch
[00:09:00] Stephen Bartlett: of other people. Like it just for me it's so exhausting. Yeah. And if I told you that what this
[00:09:04] Stephen Bartlett: context was you burst out laughing. My team were like you go to fucking me. And you enjoy it.
[00:09:12] Allison Wood Brooks: I'm like no I'm not going. There's too many people there. But that's that's kind of what I'm like I
[00:09:16] Stephen Bartlett: love this environment but I hate small talk and I hate. I don't know is that's a weakness as much as
[00:09:21] Allison Wood Brooks: it is you learning your preferences. I think it's okay. Maybe we'll get there but large groups are
[00:09:27] Allison Wood Brooks: very stressful. Group conversation and figuring out the structure of like who should be talking to
[00:09:32] Allison Wood Brooks: whom when and about what is very overwhelming for the human mind. It's quite different than one
[00:09:39] Allison Wood Brooks: not intimate one on one conversation which is much more within your control and it's much clearer
[00:09:44] Allison Wood Brooks: what the purpose is. So we should think about it maybe not we can reframe it and it's not a
[00:09:51] Allison Wood Brooks: weakness but thinking about your social portfolio. Who are you talking to? Is it the right people
[00:09:57] Allison Wood Brooks: and is it in the right arrangements in the right group size. So what we're doing right now one on
[00:10:02] Allison Wood Brooks: one is a categorically different task than going to a party with a hundred people. So I'm going to
[00:10:08] Allison Wood Brooks: help you reframe that right. Ron. Why did you choose to do this? The things you could have done
[00:10:12] Stephen Bartlett: with your life. Yeah. It's isn't life so fascinating. I often think about the paths not taken
[00:10:18] Allison Wood Brooks: but I'm very happy to be on this path. I grew up in upstate New York on a small lake in a small town.
[00:10:25] Allison Wood Brooks: I was a late girl just gorgeous place and I love playing sports, team sports in particular. I love
[00:10:34] Allison Wood Brooks: female friendship from an early age and probably most formatively I'm an identical twin.
[00:10:39] Allison Wood Brooks: And all of the things I just described I think are either indicators of how much I love
[00:10:47] Allison Wood Brooks: conversation or formed my love of conversation but either way I arrived at college deeply
[00:10:54] Allison Wood Brooks: interested in understanding humans and their behavior and by the time I got to Harvard I realized
[00:11:02] wow there are whole fields like social psychology and communication that are purportedly about
[00:11:07] Allison Wood Brooks: communication but nobody's bothered to actually transcribe real conversations and study them
[00:11:13] Allison Wood Brooks: at very large scale. And so that's what I've been up to for the last 15 years.
[00:11:17] How has being an identical twin been formative in this robot? So my twin's name is Sarah.
[00:11:23] Allison Wood Brooks: Being an identical twin I'm sure there are many things that are similar to being a close sibling
[00:11:27] Allison Wood Brooks: I'm sure but an identical twin it's like you have another version of you in the world
[00:11:32] Allison Wood Brooks: and we share a bedroom we were on the same sports teams we played in band together
[00:11:38] Allison Wood Brooks: and so it's sort of like watching a version of yourself up close and I got to see
[00:11:44] Allison Wood Brooks: how she failed and thought oh well I'm going to avoid that and I would see how she succeeds. She
[00:11:51] Allison Wood Brooks: hits an amazing joke she answers an amazing question. I know that I'm able to do that because we
[00:11:57] Allison Wood Brooks: have the same DNA, the same abilities. In a sort of subconscious way I think I've just been chasing
[00:12:03] Allison Wood Brooks: trying to help other people find that in their relationships, in their friendships and their
[00:12:08] Allison Wood Brooks: romantic relationships and their work collaborations because I've gotten to see how amazing that can
[00:12:14] Allison Wood Brooks: be for two human beings, how close you can be and how much you can actually understand each other
[00:12:18] Allison Wood Brooks: when you communicate well. And what research have you done? What are the reference points you're
[00:12:24] Stephen Bartlett: pulling on? Do you do your own research? So much. And give me a flavor of the so-
[00:12:29] Stephen Bartlett: Too much probably. It's almost like I'm a recovering academic. I've been working in academia doing
[00:12:35] Allison Wood Brooks: behavioral science research for 20 years. I know I look impossible young. I started in graduate
[00:12:41] Allison Wood Brooks: school studying emotions especially anxiety and not the kind of anxiety that requires
[00:12:47] Allison Wood Brooks: medication or therapy necessarily but the types of social anxiety that people feel constantly
[00:12:52] Allison Wood Brooks: all day long and figuring out, okay, how does it affect different behaviors like how we negotiate
[00:12:58] Allison Wood Brooks: or how we take advice from each other or how we perform when we're public speaking these types of
[00:13:04] Allison Wood Brooks: things and then figuring out strategies and tips to help people manage that anxiety more effectively.
[00:13:12] Allison Wood Brooks: And one of my biggest findings was how we reframe anxiety as excitement. It's a very easy flip
[00:13:18] Allison Wood Brooks: to move from it. Essentially they're the same emotion because they're both high arousal,
[00:13:23] high energy, high cortisol, stress hormone, high heart rate, sweaty palms. You just change how you
[00:13:29] Allison Wood Brooks: think about it in your mind. So literally saying things out loud like I'm excited, change how
[00:13:35] Allison Wood Brooks: you're appraisal of it. So you actually experience excitement. It helps you perform a lot better
[00:13:38] Allison Wood Brooks: in a lot of different ways. So you did a study in 2011? Yes. Yes. The nervisinaly negotiation study.
[00:13:45] Stephen Bartlett: So that one was about negotiation specifically. This excitement re-appraisal, the papers
[00:13:51] Allison Wood Brooks: called get excited. And that paper actually ended up being featured in Inside Out, the movie.
[00:13:57] Allison Wood Brooks: Yeah, there's a great scene where the main character is about to have a panic attack and joy
[00:14:02] Allison Wood Brooks: sneaks into the little cubicle farm of minions and says, stop drawing. All of these projections
[00:14:07] Allison Wood Brooks: about how things are going to go badly and instead draw how things could go well.
[00:14:12] So great. I was sitting in the movie theater with my kids and my husband kind of looked down
[00:14:16] Allison Wood Brooks: the way and he was like, is that your thing? And I was like, yeah, yeah, it's my thing.
[00:14:20] Allison Wood Brooks: So what did that study share those two studies? The nervisinaly one, but also the
[00:14:24] Stephen Bartlett: total excitement? Yeah. When we feel anxious, as most people do in negotiations because it's an
[00:14:29] Allison Wood Brooks: intense environment, filled with uncertainty and a lack of control, which is the recipe for anxiety,
[00:14:36] Allison Wood Brooks: we tend we want to escape. We either want to relieve that feeling by making concessions.
[00:14:41] Or get out of there, right? Just exit the interaction. That was the main finding of the
[00:14:45] Allison Wood Brooks: nervisinaly anxiety and negotiation paper. The reframing anxiety as excitement paper is lots of
[00:14:52] Allison Wood Brooks: different ways to convince yourself that you're feeling excited just by saying I'm excited out loud.
[00:14:58] And in doing so, that makes you focus on opportunities rather than threats,
[00:15:02] Allison Wood Brooks: how things could go well rather than poorly. And it has incredible downstream consequences,
[00:15:07] Allison Wood Brooks: helps you sing better, helps you do public speaking better, helps you collaborate more effectively.
[00:15:12] Allison Wood Brooks: So it's just a very powerful intervention. And what was the sort of mechanics of the study?
[00:15:16] Stephen Bartlett: So we would bring people in, you tell them, hey, Steven, you're going to be singing karaoke in front
[00:15:22] Allison Wood Brooks: of an audience. People start to feel quite nervous about this naturally. Then right before they're
[00:15:30] Allison Wood Brooks: going to get up and sing this song, we say, okay, an experimenter is going to ask you how you're
[00:15:34] Allison Wood Brooks: feeling. Some of you, we want you to say you're feeling excited. And some of you, we want you to
[00:15:39] Allison Wood Brooks: say you're feeling anxious. And that alone, when I say, Steven, how are you feeling right now?
[00:15:44] Allison Wood Brooks: And you say, anxious. Great. Okay, let's go sing the song. You go, people who said, I'm anxious,
[00:15:51] Allison Wood Brooks: sing worse compared to people who say, I'm excited. They get out there. They're more in tempo,
[00:15:57] Allison Wood Brooks: more unpitch. They have better rhythm. And we measure it with a software when they're actually
[00:16:02] Allison Wood Brooks: singing in front of the experimenters. Just by me saying, I am excited. So the other day when I met
[00:16:08] Stephen Bartlett: my team members family, I should have been saying to myself, I'm so excited to meet them.
[00:16:13] Stephen Bartlett: Among other things. So this, and this is important, it doesn't always work, right? If you're terrified
[00:16:21] and it's really something dreadful, like you're terrified that your mother's going to die and
[00:16:26] Allison Wood Brooks: turns out it's going to be hard to get excited about that if she has a terminal illness.
[00:16:30] Allison Wood Brooks: But on the margin, if you're sort of torn between feeling nervous or excited, in your mind, if
[00:16:36] Allison Wood Brooks: you can really convince yourself that you actually are excited and that things could go well,
[00:16:40] Allison Wood Brooks: I'm going to crush this exam. I'm going to, I'm going to tear it up on the basketball court.
[00:16:45] That flip, if repeated enough, actually becomes more likely to come true. And certainly before
[00:16:51] Allison Wood Brooks: a high stakes conversation like meeting your colleagues family. So interesting. I really,
[00:16:55] Stephen Bartlett: I have this behind the scenes channel called Behind the Diary on YouTube. And the other day when I
[00:17:00] Stephen Bartlett: did Jimmy Fallon, because it's kind of outside of my wheelhouse to go on like late night TV in America
[00:17:04] Stephen Bartlett: in like seven minutes to be funny or whatever. So I was shaking myself because I'm a very serious guy.
[00:17:10] So before I went out, there's a video of me and I said to my team, what I said to myself before
[00:17:15] Stephen Bartlett: the little curtain opened was this is going to be amazing. Can't wait. You've, you've like prepared
[00:17:20] Stephen Bartlett: for this. I said all this nonsense in my head thinking that it was nonsense. And I walked out,
[00:17:24] Stephen Bartlett: had the best time of my life. It went so great. Great. And I made a video about that. How,
[00:17:29] Stephen Bartlett: you know, I'm not one to believe in things that without like rigor and evidence. And I didn't have it.
[00:17:35] Now you do. Now I do. I have a study that proves that it's not. This one is interesting. I think
[00:17:40] Allison Wood Brooks: this was the beginning of my scientific journey realizing that the way we talk to other people
[00:17:45] Allison Wood Brooks: and the way we talk to ourselves, especially in a repeated sense. If you think about, okay,
[00:17:50] Allison Wood Brooks: you did that before Jimmy Fallon. Now what if you do it before the next time you meet a
[00:17:54] Allison Wood Brooks: colleagues family. Now what if you do it before you interview Bill Gates before you do it?
[00:17:58] Allison Wood Brooks: Right. If you're then get in the habit of telling yourself you're excited and that becomes
[00:18:03] Allison Wood Brooks: effective for you, it's incredibly meaningful and accumulation over time. Right. So just focusing
[00:18:09] Allison Wood Brooks: on one time. Yes, it's helpful. But if you can make it habitual, it has this sort of upward
[00:18:13] Allison Wood Brooks: spiral effect on people. It was the beginning of my scientific journey thinking, oh,
[00:18:19] Allison Wood Brooks: well, if we can study one phrase, like get excited or I'm excited, what if we start studying
[00:18:24] Allison Wood Brooks: the cascading on folding ways that people talk to each other and not just one line, but like every
[00:18:29] Allison Wood Brooks: turn of a conversation, no one had done that before. And this negotiation study you did. What was
[00:18:35] Stephen Bartlett: the mechanism for that? Yeah. That was a more class of the literature. People have been studying
[00:18:40] Allison Wood Brooks: negotiations for decades now. And there's a really great negotiation course at almost every
[00:18:46] Allison Wood Brooks: business school and law school that's based in all of this rigorous work. What had not been studied
[00:18:51] Allison Wood Brooks: in terms of negotiating our people's emotions, it was about 15 years ago that people,
[00:18:57] Allison Wood Brooks: even including scholars, came to the point where we were like, oh, people's feelings matter.
[00:19:00] Allison Wood Brooks: When they feel nervous or when they feel angry, that's actually an important distinction,
[00:19:04] Allison Wood Brooks: how you feel on the inside versus what you're expressing to your counterpart.
[00:19:09] So in this paper, what we found is as a base rate, most people feel anxious before and during
[00:19:14] Allison Wood Brooks: a negotiation because it is an intense environment, it's probably one of the greatest benefits of
[00:19:20] Allison Wood Brooks: taking a negotiation course is that you just get reps and so you get more comfortable with the
[00:19:24] Allison Wood Brooks: process of doing it. That might be the biggest takeaway from doing a training course like that.
[00:19:29] Allison Wood Brooks: And so in this paper, we had that sort of base rate look, everybody's feeling anxious.
[00:19:34] Allison Wood Brooks: And then what are the downstream consequences of feeling anxious? And what we find, people we had
[00:19:39] Allison Wood Brooks: people doing negotiations, playing these negotiation games, what we find is that people are much more
[00:19:44] Allison Wood Brooks: likely to sort of leave prematurely or make more concessions to relieve the feelings of anxiety.
[00:19:51] Allison Wood Brooks: Make bad offers. Yeah. Or it depends on your goals, right? If your goal is to claim a lot of value
[00:19:58] Allison Wood Brooks: than making concessions and giving money away is not going to help you with that.
[00:20:02] Allison Wood Brooks: So if I'm asking my boss for a pay rise, for example, and I'm very, very nervous, I'm much more likely to
[00:20:09] do lower my expectations except a bad offer and leave the situation prematurely.
[00:20:15] Stephen Bartlett: Absolutely. So what do I do about that? Oh, so many things. If we're talking about asking for a raise,
[00:20:21] Allison Wood Brooks: what you want is to go in there with as much sort of personal power as you can.
[00:20:26] Allison Wood Brooks: One way to do that is to get another job offer somewhere else first. So when you talk about this as
[00:20:32] Allison Wood Brooks: the best alternative to a negotiated agreement, a batina, you want to strengthen your batina.
[00:20:37] Allison Wood Brooks: So if your boss says no, I'm not giving you a raise, you can legitimately say,
[00:20:43] I'm going to go take this other job offer because I just got a better offer from the guy down the
[00:20:46] Allison Wood Brooks: street. What if you don't want to take the other offer? Then you need to be honest with yourself
[00:20:52] Allison Wood Brooks: about how much power you have in the negotiation. You also probably, a lot of people make the mistake
[00:20:58] Allison Wood Brooks: of going in sort of hands-on hips like I deserve more money. There are lots of questions that you
[00:21:02] Allison Wood Brooks: should ask first to know, am I negotiating with the right person? Does my company have the funds
[00:21:08] Allison Wood Brooks: to actually give me more money? How can I justify this in a way that's compelling to them?
[00:21:15] Allison Wood Brooks: It's not up to you. They need to want to keep you and to feel like you are being fairly and
[00:21:23] Allison Wood Brooks: generously rewarded. All of that requires asking a lot of questions before you go in and start
[00:21:29] Allison Wood Brooks: making demands. In that context, how would you try and persuade me if you work for me?
[00:21:33] Stephen Bartlett: So what would you say? Because I do think it's very easy to get someone's backup when you walk in
[00:21:39] Stephen Bartlett: and ask them for money. If you do it. 100%. It's hard for me to answer this because
[00:21:47] Allison Wood Brooks: maybe this is sort of my personal values. It's almost like I'm taking off my expert hat for a moment.
[00:21:52] Allison Wood Brooks: I think the best way to get a raise is to be awesome. Do things that are valuable.
[00:21:59] Allison Wood Brooks: And your company is going to give you more money without even having to ask for it.
[00:22:04] Allison Wood Brooks: So in my heart, this question of how do we have a conversation where I ask for more money? It's
[00:22:10] Allison Wood Brooks: almost like I would hope that you don't even get to that point. If you are truly making yourself
[00:22:16] Allison Wood Brooks: almost irreplaceable and incredibly valuable, your boss is going to be coming to you and saying,
[00:22:22] Allison Wood Brooks: I have to keep you around. You're amazing. You're so incredible. That's a much easier conversation
[00:22:26] Allison Wood Brooks: have than walking in and saying, I'm not fair. I don't make enough.
[00:22:31] I do think that holds it to be true. I think that generally, if people's first priorities,
[00:22:36] what they want, then they often don't tend to get what they want. But people who have the priority,
[00:22:41] Stephen Bartlett: their first priority is what I can give tend to get what they want. That's right. It's so,
[00:22:47] Allison Wood Brooks: it's a bit of a sort of like a mindset shift. If you prioritize other people's needs,
[00:22:53] Allison Wood Brooks: if you're thinking about what your boss finds valuable, what the organization finds valuable,
[00:22:58] Allison Wood Brooks: and you rise to meet those needs, you make yourself valuable, which is going to come back to you.
[00:23:05] Hopefully, that's what that's the hope. I think often that is the case, almost always that is the case.
[00:23:10] Allison Wood Brooks: In the talk framework, and we'll get there, the K is for kindness, and it's not kindness in the
[00:23:15] Allison Wood Brooks: sense of like altruism because I'm going to help my boss and do everything he wants because I
[00:23:20] care so deeply. That can be part of it. But also, it's this sort of loop of like, well, if you give
[00:23:25] Allison Wood Brooks: him everything, if you give the organization what it needs, that's going to come back to you. You
[00:23:30] Allison Wood Brooks: will actually become valuable and get what you want as well. That's how relationships work.
[00:23:36] Usually when I interview people, I lead the way. Today, I'm going to follow.
[00:23:40] Because you know the outcome, me and the audience want to get to. So, I have all this stuff here.
[00:23:46] Stephen Bartlett: I love it. Props. All these props. Fabulous. I have these blocks that for anyone that can't see
[00:23:51] Stephen Bartlett: the conversation, say T-A-L-K on them talk. Fabulous. And you tell me the best place to start. You know
[00:23:57] Stephen Bartlett: the outcome. You know where I want to get to. I want to be the best conversationist, the best
[00:24:00] Stephen Bartlett: talker, the most persuasive, influential, likable talker in the world. So, I shall follow your
[00:24:09] Stephen Bartlett: lead. Oh my gosh. It's a lot of power. I love it. I love it so much. Let's start with this.
[00:24:16] Allison Wood Brooks: I want you to think of a conversation that you had recently. It has to be more than five minutes
[00:24:23] Allison Wood Brooks: long. More than five. Yes, I can think of one immediately. It was a conversation I had with my
[00:24:27] Stephen Bartlett: girlfriend where I just wanted her to know that I accept the fact that I fucked up. Like, I accept
[00:24:32] Stephen Bartlett: the fact that I should have been more present in a particular moment and I wasn't. And I just
[00:24:36] wanted to like own it. And convey that to her. And convey that I'm sorry that I get it.
[00:24:42] Stephen Bartlett: Yep. And this is not one where I'm going to try and justify my whatever. No, actually,
[00:24:48] objectively, I should have been more attentive and present. Yep. I just wanted her to know that.
[00:24:53] Stephen Bartlett: Yep. So you still have an admission of blameworthiness. Why? Why did you want to do that?
[00:24:59] Allison Wood Brooks: Because I felt that she was right and I regretted my behavior. Yep. So, sometimes I don't
[00:25:06] Stephen Bartlett: feel like she's right. Sometimes I'm here to, you know, respond. In this particular scenario,
[00:25:11] Stephen Bartlett: I thought, you know, actually, on balance, I should have been more present. This was an important
[00:25:16] Stephen Bartlett: time for her. And in hindsight, that's not how I wish I'd behaved. Okay. How did you want her to feel
[00:25:25] Allison Wood Brooks: during and at the end of this conversation? Understood. And you really understood, that was really
[00:25:35] Stephen Bartlett: it. It's like I wanted her to feel understood and I guess like connected to me, but it's more,
[00:25:43] Stephen Bartlett: it's really more I just wanted her to not worry that I didn't understand. So she didn't have to
[00:25:48] Stephen Bartlett: say it again. I just wanted her to know that I get it. And that in future, I wish I behaved
[00:25:53] Stephen Bartlett: differently. How did you want to feel during and after this conversation? I guess I wanted to
[00:26:00] Stephen Bartlett: offload the guilt. Good. Because I felt bad. I felt like, no, she's and it was weighing on your
[00:26:06] Allison Wood Brooks: conscience. Yeah. I got to say that I got to own this because it's making me feel like a
[00:26:10] Allison Wood Brooks: chit head. Yeah. Okay. Fabulous. Okay. When we look back on our conversations and try and
[00:26:17] Allison Wood Brooks: describe what our goals were, very quickly you start to realize that our goals are very complicated
[00:26:22] Allison Wood Brooks: that we want a lot of things. I'm also guessing there may have been a time component. Can you talk
[00:26:27] Allison Wood Brooks: a little bit about that? How much time did you have to achieve these goals? I mean, I never
[00:26:33] Stephen Bartlett: seemed to have enough time. So it was like it was yeah. So I had about probably about 20 minutes.
[00:26:40] Stephen Bartlett: Great. Hey, that's pretty good. I wish I had 20 minutes with my husband. Okay. So I have a
[00:26:47] framework that helps us think about conversational goals. And I call it the conversational compass.
[00:26:54] Allison Wood Brooks: Okay. And like a compass that you might use to find your way out of the desert or the forest,
[00:27:00] Allison Wood Brooks: the compass helps you decide which way not to walk but to talk. Okay. So the x-axis.
[00:27:07] Allison Wood Brooks: I'll put this on the screen for anyone. That's conceit the video. Great. The x-axis, which runs
[00:27:12] Allison Wood Brooks: horizontally, is about your relationship. Also, I'll link it below. So this relational access,
[00:27:18] Allison Wood Brooks: high relational goals are things that you care about that are serving the other person,
[00:27:23] Allison Wood Brooks: or your relationship. This conversation sounded very high relational. You're truly like,
[00:27:28] I just really want her to know that I feel like a shithead and that I'm owning it and like,
[00:27:33] Allison Wood Brooks: I care and I maybe won't do it again. Something like that. Low relational goals are things we care
[00:27:39] Allison Wood Brooks: about that serve us. So in this case, you said something like I want to offload, give her to my guilt.
[00:27:44] Allison Wood Brooks: I wasn't I was feeling bad. The y-axis is about information exchange. High informational goals are
[00:27:52] hinge on exchanging accurate information. It's sort of the reason human beings
[00:27:58] Allison Wood Brooks: develop the ability to communicate at all, right? Way back when is to take what's in my brain,
[00:28:02] Allison Wood Brooks: communicate it to you accurately. But we care about tons of stuff that is low informational. So
[00:28:07] Allison Wood Brooks: it's not about exchanging information and sometimes it's about concealing it. In this case,
[00:28:12] Allison Wood Brooks: you had a high informational goal. You wanted to sort of persuade her or prove to her that you're
[00:28:18] Allison Wood Brooks: a good guy and that she should stay with you essentially. Trust you. But you also had low informational
[00:28:23] Allison Wood Brooks: goals. Like you didn't want it to be emotionally unpleasant to have this conversation. You also
[00:28:28] Allison Wood Brooks: had low informational goals like a time constraint. You needed to protect your time and her time.
[00:28:35] Allison Wood Brooks: And so we're always limited by time and cognitive resources. So the point of this is to help us plot
[00:28:42] Allison Wood Brooks: all of those goals in a logical way. Each quadrant is good. We live in all four quadrants. We're not
[00:28:49] Allison Wood Brooks: trying to get to one or another. It's just to help us describe all of the many things that we
[00:28:55] Allison Wood Brooks: actually care about. Almost to validate them and say, listen, it's legit that you wanted to relieve
[00:29:00] Allison Wood Brooks: your guilt. It's super admirable that you wanted to signal to her that like you're owning this
[00:29:05] Allison Wood Brooks: mistake. It's legit that you have time constraints. It's legit that you don't want your conversations
[00:29:10] Allison Wood Brooks: to be unpleasant. So each of the quadrants gets a positive name. High informational, high relational
[00:29:16] Allison Wood Brooks: is about connection. Often you'll hear communications experts just talk about connection, which is
[00:29:23] Allison Wood Brooks: too narrow. It's not the only thing that we care about. Down here, low informational, high relational
[00:29:29] Allison Wood Brooks: is about savoring. And it does informational mean in this context. Like how much
[00:29:35] Allison Wood Brooks: accurate information you are trying to, you need to exchange with each other. If we just sat
[00:29:42] Allison Wood Brooks: here kind of quietly and I hummed a song because we, and I said something like, I love your shirt,
[00:29:49] Allison Wood Brooks: we're not exchanging a lot of information, but we might be having a very lovely interaction
[00:29:54] Allison Wood Brooks: with each other. So not every conversation is about high information exchange, though many people
[00:30:01] Allison Wood Brooks: think that it is. You know these people. They're very transactional. They feel like a conversation
[00:30:06] Allison Wood Brooks: is where you just say things you know at other people and that they're going to say things they know
[00:30:12] Allison Wood Brooks: back at you. That's a big mistake. So having fun, I can see it's in the bottom right.
[00:30:17] Stephen Bartlett: Having fun, yes. Because it's not about huge information on exchange. It is about connections.
[00:30:21] Stephen Bartlett: That's right. Oh, and it's really important. Many of my students at Harvard almost forget about
[00:30:26] Allison Wood Brooks: this quadrant. They're like, if we're not persuading and making decisions, we're not living,
[00:30:30] Allison Wood Brooks: right? Like this is really important, especially over time. If we're not enjoying being with each
[00:30:36] Allison Wood Brooks: other, I'm not going to look forward to talking to you again. That's true at work and outside of work.
[00:30:42] Lower left is essentially discernment. We call it protection. It's protecting your time,
[00:30:46] Allison Wood Brooks: protecting your reputation, protecting information. So concealing, keeping secrets, moving quickly,
[00:30:53] Allison Wood Brooks: we can't sit here for hours and hours and hours. And then protecting your reputation. Like,
[00:30:58] Allison Wood Brooks: you care about making a positive impression on other people. I want you to see me as smart
[00:31:02] Allison Wood Brooks: and warm and calm and trustworthy. These are self-serving low relational or low informational goals.
[00:31:11] And then we get up to upper left, which is low relational. They're self-serving. High
[00:31:15] informational. This is a lot of work related, goal persuasion, making decisions, brainstorming,
[00:31:20] Allison Wood Brooks: et cetera. So if I want to be liked and have great relationships, I need to be on the right side
[00:31:25] Stephen Bartlett: of this. Is that accurate? So what happens if someone who trusts you and loves you tells you
[00:31:31] Allison Wood Brooks: something in confidence and then you go tell everybody else? You need trust? Yeah. So it's not that
[00:31:39] Allison Wood Brooks: you can only live on this side of the compass because discernment matters for relationships.
[00:31:46] Allison Wood Brooks: Okay. Right? So and here, you are going to be in a relationship where hopefully you're going to
[00:31:52] Allison Wood Brooks: be like brainstorming things together, making decisions together. Even with a friend, you're like,
[00:31:56] Allison Wood Brooks: oh, where should we go to dinner tonight? You need to make that coordinate that choice well
[00:32:00] Allison Wood Brooks: together. So I think that one aspiration is to try and be over on the right side as much as you
[00:32:06] Allison Wood Brooks: can. And in fact, having the mindset of pushing yourself to try and think about your goals that are
[00:32:12] Allison Wood Brooks: more prosocial, more often is a virtuous goal. But like, listen, we all have actual needs. So like,
[00:32:19] Allison Wood Brooks: you can't only live on the right side of the compass. It's about moving around in a way that is
[00:32:26] Allison Wood Brooks: savvy and actually serves what you care about. Yeah. Do you have a sense of where your goals from
[00:32:34] Allison Wood Brooks: that conversation that you described would be? Apologize, which is high relational and not very
[00:32:41] Stephen Bartlett: high on information, because I didn't have a bunch. I didn't have a lot to say. It was just
[00:32:44] Stephen Bartlett: very simply about letting a note that I was sorry. And it wasn't, I didn't have a big explanation
[00:32:49] Stephen Bartlett: or a bunch of excuses or justifications. It was just a knife. I got it. Can we talk about apologies
[00:32:55] Allison Wood Brooks: for a sec? I love that you chose this as your example, because and the way you're describing it.
[00:33:01] Allison Wood Brooks: I love how you're saying, I didn't go into a huge explanation of why I did it or anything.
[00:33:07] Allison Wood Brooks: More people should apologize that way. A lot of people, their instinct when they're apologizing
[00:33:11] Allison Wood Brooks: is to revisit the problem and sort of make excuses or explain why they did the thing wrong.
[00:33:18] It's not effective. What is more effective is what you're describing, taking ownership and saying,
[00:33:24] Allison Wood Brooks: look, I just messed up and I'm so sorry and I feel awful about it. And the most effective
[00:33:30] Allison Wood Brooks: component of an apology is actually making a promise to change. If you say to your girlfriend,
[00:33:36] Allison Wood Brooks: I realize I messed up here, I'm not going to do it again. Here's how I'm going to be different
[00:33:40] Allison Wood Brooks: in the future, like a concrete plan. It's so compelling to hear that you've thought about that.
[00:33:47] Allison Wood Brooks: It's measurable because she can see in the future, do you actually live up to that promise?
[00:33:52] Allison Wood Brooks: Do you follow through on this promise to never make the mistake again?
[00:33:56] Allison Wood Brooks: Is there a point where you can apologize too much?
[00:33:59] We studied this. I ran some studies on this. We started by looking at
[00:34:05] frequency of apologies made during normal conversations. It's quite rare for someone to
[00:34:10] Allison Wood Brooks: over-apologize, but it does seem like within one conversation, if you apologize more than twice,
[00:34:15] Allison Wood Brooks: it starts to be more of a reminder of the bad thing that happened. You just keep revisiting it,
[00:34:22] Allison Wood Brooks: and it brings you back to the negativity rather than moving forward.
[00:34:26] Allison Wood Brooks: We also studied apologies in a really large data set of parole hearings,
[00:34:31] Allison Wood Brooks: like among people who had committed really serious crimes, and we looked at the types of
[00:34:36] Allison Wood Brooks: apologies that they made during their parole hearings. There, it seems like you actually
[00:34:41] Allison Wood Brooks: can't over-apologize. More is better. Again, the most effective component is making a promise to
[00:34:48] Allison Wood Brooks: change in the future. When I get out, I'm going to be in AA. I'm going to live with my grandmother.
[00:34:54] Allison Wood Brooks: Here's the job I'm going to do. Whatever the plan is, you're actually more likely to get out of jail.
[00:35:01] Going into those difficult conversations, is there anything one needs to do to prepare?
[00:35:07] Because our lives are full of difficult conversations, and actually it's the avoidance of them
[00:35:10] Stephen Bartlett: that ends up messing up our lives the most. When you think about difficult conversations that
[00:35:14] Stephen Bartlett: we all have to have, or with difficult people, do I have to prepare for that?
[00:35:18] Stephen Bartlett: This is very natural. Almost every person that you hear talk about communication tends to focus on
[00:35:23] Allison Wood Brooks: difficult conversations. I'm going to suggest to you that that is a very narrow view of the
[00:35:28] Allison Wood Brooks: conversational world, actually. In fact, thinking about difficult conversations is a little bit of
[00:35:35] Allison Wood Brooks: a misnomer. It's not like there are some conversations that are difficult and some that are easy.
[00:35:41] It's that in every conversation, there can be moments of difference where we use different
[00:35:47] Allison Wood Brooks: language to mean the same thing, where we have an incongruence in our emotions, where we have a
[00:35:52] Allison Wood Brooks: difference in motives. I want to give you advice, but you don't want to take it. Or something
[00:35:56] Allison Wood Brooks: dips down to a difference in our identities. I'm American and you're a Brit. Anytime you encounter
[00:36:03] Allison Wood Brooks: these little fleeting moments of difference in all of these different ways, and maybe there was
[00:36:08] Allison Wood Brooks: an image here. Let me see. No, it's not here. It looks like layers. We talk about it like layers
[00:36:12] Allison Wood Brooks: of the earth. Above the surface are the words and sounds that you hear while people are talking.
[00:36:18] Allison Wood Brooks: Right at the surface are people's emotions. I feel excited, but you feel tired and bored.
[00:36:25] Allison Wood Brooks: That's going to be tough. Right below that are people's motives. What I want to expect to
[00:36:31] Allison Wood Brooks: the compass, what I want to achieve is different than what you want to achieve. We're all walking
[00:36:35] Allison Wood Brooks: around with a compass in our mind, and they're different from each other. Right below that are
[00:36:39] Allison Wood Brooks: beliefs. I believe that immigration is a problem, and you believe that AI is a way bigger problem
[00:36:48] Allison Wood Brooks: than human immigration. How do we talk about that in a way? Then all of it dips down to the
[00:36:54] Allison Wood Brooks: hot magma in the layers of the earth model of our identities. Even an easy conversation, we're on
[00:37:00] Allison Wood Brooks: a date or two spouses are driving in a car or friends are hanging out watching a movie. You can
[00:37:06] Allison Wood Brooks: stumble upon these little moments of difficulty anytime for any reason, and you need to have the skill
[00:37:13] Allison Wood Brooks: set to be able to make sure the temperature doesn't get too hot. What is that skill set? There's
[00:37:18] Stephen Bartlett: fabulous research on this. I have found it incredibly helpful in my life. Researched by
[00:37:23] Allison Wood Brooks: Juliamonson, Mike Yomons, Hannah Collins called Receptiveness. It's Receptiveness to opposing
[00:37:29] Allison Wood Brooks: viewpoints. It's both the mindset. When someone comes to you with something that seems crazy,
[00:37:37] you don't judge it negatively. You have to fight the human instinct to think of it as like
[00:37:43] that's crazy. That's wrong. Now I'm going to win. Now I'm going to be right and prove you wrong,
[00:37:50] Allison Wood Brooks: because all of those instincts ruin our conversations and our relationships.
[00:37:56] It makes us defensive on the receiving end. It makes us sort of accusatory and hostile on the
[00:38:02] Allison Wood Brooks: attack end. Once we get into an accusation and defense mode, the conversation is broken down.
[00:38:08] Allison Wood Brooks: It's no longer about connection, savoring, protecting and advancing. We're now in this new world
[00:38:15] Allison Wood Brooks: that is not achieving any of our goals. Just as someone comes to me and comes to you and says
[00:38:20] Stephen Bartlett: something's crazy, they say, you know the sky is purple. Yeah. It's actually, it's not blue,
[00:38:26] Stephen Bartlett: it's purple. Here's a magical phrase that you can say in that moment. It makes sense that you
[00:38:31] Allison Wood Brooks: feel that the sky is purple. It makes sense that you feel excited to tell me that the sky is purple.
[00:38:36] Allison Wood Brooks: It makes sense that you feel ex about why. It makes sense that you feel skeptical about
[00:38:42] Allison Wood Brooks: podcasts. It makes sense that you feel annoyed that I speak quickly. It makes sense that you
[00:38:49] Allison Wood Brooks: are worried about AI. Whatever people are feeling, whatever they express to you,
[00:38:54] Allison Wood Brooks: we can validate that feeling because whatever is going on in their mind is their reality.
[00:38:59] Allison Wood Brooks: And we have to say that out loud before we go on to do anything else, even if we're about to
[00:39:04] Allison Wood Brooks: disagree with them vehemently. But we have to say the validation piece first, just like therapists do
[00:39:10] Allison Wood Brooks: all the time. In order for them to feel heard and like, oh yeah, I'm safe here so that I can join
[00:39:16] Allison Wood Brooks: you on your side of the table. And now we're going to untangle this weird problem together.
[00:39:22] You say the sky is purple. Tell me more. Like what, how did you come to feel like the sky is purple?
[00:39:27] Allison Wood Brooks: Are you colorblind? Do you see everything in purple? Like now I can ask you questions about how
[00:39:35] Allison Wood Brooks: you came to that perspective and we can learn, I can learn about it. I guess the risk is you don't
[00:39:39] want to validate something wrong. Yeah. Why not? You don't want to appear to be saying, because if I say,
[00:39:46] Stephen Bartlett: it makes sense that you think the sky is purple, but it's actually blue. The word thinks is
[00:39:50] Allison Wood Brooks: important. It makes sense that you feel x about y. Not it makes sense that you think x about y.
[00:39:57] Allison Wood Brooks: Thinking is like a cognition. Is there risk of it sounding patronizing? Maybe, but in practice,
[00:40:04] Allison Wood Brooks: it feels really, really good. When I run this, so I run the exercise in my class where we go around,
[00:40:09] Allison Wood Brooks: let's say there's a group of five students. And you have to share something. We start easy,
[00:40:16] Allison Wood Brooks: like share one song you love. And then the next person has to validate that before they share
[00:40:21] Allison Wood Brooks: there for a favorite next song. And you go around and around very quickly. And so it feels very
[00:40:26] Allison Wood Brooks: contrived to say, okay, you have to say, I love that you love that Taylor Swift song. That's so
[00:40:30] Allison Wood Brooks: interesting. I actually don't like Taylor Swift. It's feels very contrived, but when you talk to
[00:40:36] Allison Wood Brooks: the students after it, they say, yes, I knew what we were doing. It did feel over the top to say
[00:40:41] Allison Wood Brooks: that about people's song preferences. And still, it felt amazing to have the person next to me say,
[00:40:47] Allison Wood Brooks: I love that you love that Taylor Swift song. Validation, we are all so hungry for validation that
[00:40:53] Allison Wood Brooks: even ridiculous validation feels amazing. So then when you get to round two and everybody's
[00:40:59] Allison Wood Brooks: sharing something that they're really struggling with. And the person next to them says,
[00:41:04] well, I'm so sorry, that sounds really, really hard. It makes sense that you feel upset about your mom.
[00:41:08] Allison Wood Brooks: Now you've got that habit and you're making them feel quite good about something that actually
[00:41:15] Allison Wood Brooks: does deserve that validation. So it's all about like developing these habits no matter where the
[00:41:22] Allison Wood Brooks: difference or disagreement is coming from. What's the opposite of that? The opposite is what how
[00:41:28] Allison Wood Brooks: people naturally respond tend to naturally respond, which is by trying to win and prove them wrong
[00:41:34] Allison Wood Brooks: and prove that they're right. So you say the sky is purple and I say, what's crazy? Sky's blue.
[00:41:42] And then where does our conversation go? It feels terrible for you. It's so, I learned this
[00:41:48] because I employed this person once and this person when we talk about ideas, the first word out
[00:41:54] Stephen Bartlett: of their mouth was always, I disagree and then they'd make their point. That's right. And I don't know
[00:41:59] Stephen Bartlett: what it was about it. But I noticed that it would like get my back up. Of course.
[00:42:04] Allison Wood Brooks: And so I'd say, I don't know, I'd say, I think we should do it like this. I disagree. And then
[00:42:08] Stephen Bartlett: they'd make their point. And I remember thinking, gosh, that's such a... And it's so ironic because
[00:42:13] Allison Wood Brooks: their goal is to persuade you. At the end of it, they want you to agree with their position.
[00:42:18] Allison Wood Brooks: That's not at all how persuasion works. The only way that we change our beliefs is usually
[00:42:24] Allison Wood Brooks: cross many conversations. And we're around someone we like talking to and respect and have
[00:42:30] Allison Wood Brooks: admiration for. And then over time, we sort of bend to the gentle pressure of their differing viewpoint.
[00:42:37] If I say, I disagree. Now let's fight about it. You get your back up and you're not having,
[00:42:44] Allison Wood Brooks: you're not enjoying talking to me. Even if you're right and right, like it's not about being
[00:42:49] Allison Wood Brooks: right or wrong in that moment, the goal here is to keep the conversation in an emotional place
[00:42:54] Allison Wood Brooks: where it can continue. So you can continue to engage. And that's what these researchers find in
[00:42:59] Allison Wood Brooks: this receptiveness. Research is if you qualify your statement saying, like, I wonder if the sky could
[00:43:05] Allison Wood Brooks: be a different color rather than the sky is blue with certainty. They're all of these sort of
[00:43:11] Allison Wood Brooks: hedging language. You can divide yourself into multiple parts. So if you said to me, the sky is
[00:43:16] Allison Wood Brooks: purple, I would say, oh my gosh, as your friend and as a painter, that is so intriguing to me.
[00:43:21] Allison Wood Brooks: As a biologist or as a meteorologist, maybe we should investigate that.
[00:43:27] Allison Wood Brooks: Literally dividing yourself into two disagreeing parts. It's usually how we actually feel.
[00:43:32] Allison Wood Brooks: So if your mother says something crazy to you, that seems crazy to you, you could say as your
[00:43:36] Allison Wood Brooks: daughter, I'm so intrigued that you've come to hold that perspective. I'd love to hear more.
[00:43:41] Allison Wood Brooks: As a representative of Gen Z, I know my friends would want you to want me to say this.
[00:43:46] It means that you can hold two perspectives at once and it is very helpful to the other person
[00:43:51] Allison Wood Brooks: to keep the conversation going. But all of the elements of this receptiveness recipe have
[00:43:56] Allison Wood Brooks: this flavor. It's a little surprising. I think often people think of these types of things as
[00:44:00] Allison Wood Brooks: weakness because it's like our instinct is to try to win and be right. And instead, what I'm saying
[00:44:07] Allison Wood Brooks: is, no, hedge your claims. Show that you're uncertain about stuff. Validate their feelings.
[00:44:13] Allison Wood Brooks: Divide yourself into disagreeing parts because you're not certain about anything
[00:44:17] in order to keep the conversation going so that you have any shred of hope of persuading them
[00:44:22] Allison Wood Brooks: over the longer term. I remember Tally Sharat telling me about a study. Either she told me, she's
[00:44:26] Stephen Bartlett: an neuroscientist in London and she told me they put two people in a brain imaging scanner
[00:44:32] Stephen Bartlett: and got them to like look at photos and come to agreement on the price of something. Yes.
[00:44:38] Stephen Bartlett: And then eventually in these studies, I'm super paraphrasing here. She's probably like cringes.
[00:44:42] Stephen Bartlett: I think I know what study you're talking about. Oh, do you? Could you explain it?
[00:44:44] Stephen Bartlett: Yes. So they studied what lights up in your brain when you're in a situation of disagreement
[00:44:51] Allison Wood Brooks: versus agreement. And it is actually more taxing to your mind when someone is disagreeing with you.
[00:44:56] Allison Wood Brooks: It's like these neurological alarm bells go off. And all of a sudden, like you describe,
[00:45:03] Allison Wood Brooks: what was your friend? My back goes up. What was your friend? Yeah, my back goes up. I get my back up.
[00:45:06] Stephen Bartlett: That's it. It's actually in your brain. Your brain goes up. And it's hard. It's very hard to
[00:45:10] Allison Wood Brooks: continue to engage once that process is underway. Yeah. Right. Some people call it a migdala
[00:45:16] Allison Wood Brooks: hijacking, which is not quite right. But your brain does look different when you're in a situation
[00:45:22] Allison Wood Brooks: of disagreement. So whatever we can do, conversational need to sort of tamp that down so that your back
[00:45:27] Allison Wood Brooks: doesn't go up is going to be quite helpful. She showed pictures of the brain in these scans
[00:45:33] Stephen Bartlett: when someone disagrees with you. And I think, and I might be getting this inverted,
[00:45:37] Stephen Bartlett: that it was almost like the brain had shut down to receptiveness. Yes. In that moment,
[00:45:42] Stephen Bartlett: it was like, so I always, I whenever I wrote this chapter in my book called Do Not Disagree,
[00:45:46] Stephen Bartlett: it's an intentionally provocative chapter because people think, would you be never disagree with
[00:45:49] Stephen Bartlett: anybody? No, it's my like, yeah. Don't make the first thing you say I disagree. That's right.
[00:45:53] Stephen Bartlett: It can come later. 100%. It can come later. But first has to come like, that's so intriguing that
[00:45:57] Allison Wood Brooks: you said that I'm so fascinated. And it makes sense that you might feel that way. I wonder if,
[00:46:02] Allison Wood Brooks: and then you can go on instead of I disagree. I got called Anne, who always said yes and instead
[00:46:10] Stephen Bartlett: of but good. And it shocked me because it was so different. I, having a conversation with her,
[00:46:15] Stephen Bartlett: you say something to her and you go, I think there she goes, yes, and then she would make her point.
[00:46:20] Stephen Bartlett: And it could be a complete disagreement. But I noticed she was doing it and I loved it.
[00:46:23] Stephen Bartlett: Yeah. Oh, yeah. And we often think of the yes and as part of sort of improv comedy, humor,
[00:46:29] Allison Wood Brooks: et cetera, they were the comedians are really on to something much more profound about conversation
[00:46:35] Allison Wood Brooks: broadly. If you can come from a sort of mindset or like spiritual place of yes and essentially,
[00:46:42] you're saying, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here, even though what you're saying
[00:46:47] Allison Wood Brooks: seems a little crazy. That's what is required to have great relationships. It's like we're all
[00:46:53] Allison Wood Brooks: going to have these moments where someone feels something or says something that seems crazy. And if
[00:46:58] Allison Wood Brooks: you react to it in an invalidating way, that's how we kill our relationships. Do we need to kill
[00:47:05] Stephen Bartlett: the word but because what ends up happening is someone will say, I think you just said about
[00:47:09] Stephen Bartlett: valedictive relationship. Yes, I completely understand. I think you made a great point, Alison.
[00:47:14] Stephen Bartlett: But and the minute I say but it's kind of like I've just taken an eraser to everything you just said.
[00:47:18] Stephen Bartlett: I would love to get rid of the word but not but with two teas but with one tea. Yes.
[00:47:24] Allison Wood Brooks: Yeah, you never need it. You can make the same point and say and.
[00:47:33] But it just completely, it just it immediately says. It also reveals that you're sitting there
[00:47:41] in a state of I can't wait. I'm like on the tip of my tongue is something I can't wait to say
[00:47:47] Allison Wood Brooks: that's opposite of what you're saying. And it's the spirit of it is antagonistic.
[00:47:53] One of the things we notice when we have conversations on this share about conversation is
[00:47:58] Stephen Bartlett: people really care about likability. Yes. Like they really want to know what's making them
[00:48:03] Stephen Bartlett: disliked. They really want to know how to be liked. Good. So being liked is a huge drive.
[00:48:12] But it's just one of many things that we care about in terms of gaining status. So status is
[00:48:17] Allison Wood Brooks: respect, admiration, liking and the eyes of other people. Liking is usually comes from sort of
[00:48:23] Allison Wood Brooks: warmth and charm. Admiration often comes from like perceptions of competence. So we want warmth
[00:48:29] Allison Wood Brooks: and competence at once ideally. Okay, let's go back in time. Should we talk about the talk framework
[00:48:34] Allison Wood Brooks: because they're going to be little clues about how to be better liked across the whole framework.
[00:48:40] Allison Wood Brooks: Okay. Okay. Let's start with tea. I'm going to push these to the side. Tea is first I just want to
[00:48:47] Allison Wood Brooks: say as a whole framework, TALK is the most comprehensive, teachable, practical, scientifically rigorous
[00:48:55] Allison Wood Brooks: framework in the world for communication. Did you invent it? I did. But I didn't when I first
[00:49:02] Allison Wood Brooks: wrote the book, I didn't say it strongly enough. And in the last almost year, I've come to realize why
[00:49:10] one part is because most people focus only on difficult conversations. And here we are focusing
[00:49:15] Allison Wood Brooks: on all conversations, even the ones that seem like they should be easy and fun. It's all conversations
[00:49:20] Allison Wood Brooks: everywhere, personal and professional. The other piece is that I didn't even really intend this as a
[00:49:26] Allison Wood Brooks: scientist, but the way we do research is essentially natural language processing machine learning
[00:49:31] Allison Wood Brooks: fits into this new world of AI. So the framework can be used by humans or machines to coach people to
[00:49:38] Allison Wood Brooks: be better conversationalists and use as a rubric after the fact of saying, okay, how did this go?
[00:49:43] Allison Wood Brooks: Did you do well? Let's look at TALK and evaluate. Okay, it's the best in the world ever. Thank you,
[00:49:50] Stephen Bartlett: Stephen. Thank you. Thank you for recognizing. Okay, tea is for topics. Topics. Topics are the building blocks
[00:50:00] Allison Wood Brooks: of conversation. It is what we choose to talk about. Okay. Very simple. We all have an intuitive
[00:50:06] Allison Wood Brooks: understanding that we sort of work through different chunks. First, we're going to talk about your
[00:50:11] Allison Wood Brooks: conversation with your girlfriend. Then we're going to talk about the talk framework. Then we're
[00:50:15] Allison Wood Brooks: talk about the compass, whatever. We're working through topics. What I think most people don't realize
[00:50:19] Allison Wood Brooks: is that we're choosing topics every time we talk. It's not just at the beginning of a conversation,
[00:50:26] Allison Wood Brooks: like an opener, like, hey, what do you think of this, you know, the diplomat? No, it's every time
[00:50:30] Allison Wood Brooks: you're talking, we're making moves to gently stay on topic or switch to something else. What's so
[00:50:37] Allison Wood Brooks: beautiful about that is it means we all have power. We all have control to nudge the conversation
[00:50:43] Allison Wood Brooks: one way or another. We can all do a better job with it. So what's the game here to pick better topics
[00:50:51] Stephen Bartlett: to know what topic we're aiming at? There's a lot of goals. It's both about choosing better topics.
[00:50:57] Allison Wood Brooks: It's also about how can we make any topic better? Okay. One huge piece of advice that when you start
[00:51:05] Allison Wood Brooks: to realize how much your mind is doing during a live conversation is to offload some of that
[00:51:10] Allison Wood Brooks: cognitive work to beforehand. Okay. So prepping topics ahead of time. This does not mean writing out
[00:51:18] Allison Wood Brooks: an agenda before you call your parents or before you call your girlfriend. What it does mean is
[00:51:23] Allison Wood Brooks: spending even 30 seconds, maybe even 10 seconds before you're in the chaos of a conversation,
[00:51:29] Allison Wood Brooks: to think about what you could talk about or what might be important for you to remember to talk
[00:51:33] Allison Wood Brooks: about. Did you do that today? Always. Sometimes you don't have to write like you did it today. You
[00:51:38] Allison Wood Brooks: did extensive prep. You even have things printed on cards here. And in a way, I have been prepping
[00:51:45] Allison Wood Brooks: for this conversation for 20 years. I've been studying these things. I designed the framework
[00:51:49] Allison Wood Brooks: myself. I've gotten on a different podcast. That's all prep for this moment. What about in your
[00:51:56] personal life? Yeah. Can you give me an example of where you prepared topics? Every conversation that
[00:52:01] Allison Wood Brooks: I know is coming. So with Cassie before I got here, which is a member of our team. Yes, thank you.
[00:52:09] Allison Wood Brooks: I thought about I wanted to ask her what it's like to be moving from London to LA. I wanted to
[00:52:16] ask her what it's like to work with you. She said, oh, good. Oh, good. Next question. What does
[00:52:23] Stephen Bartlett: I say? I often will. So you can it's not rocket science. It's literally just a little bit of
[00:52:33] Allison Wood Brooks: forethought. What kinds of questions or topics could I ask you that will make our conversation feel
[00:52:39] Allison Wood Brooks: a little bit better than just like winging it in the moment and talking about like some random
[00:52:44] Allison Wood Brooks: thing I see in the room. I try to do this before every conversation because now I know how powerful
[00:52:49] Allison Wood Brooks: it is and how kind it is. If you are calling somebody and you're like, okay, oh, yeah,
[00:52:54] Allison Wood Brooks: their kid was going to take a tar less than I should remember to ask about that. Or, oh, my friend
[00:52:58] Allison Wood Brooks: had this big presentation at work. I should remember to ask how that went. That means you're going
[00:53:03] to remember to ask them and that's super kind. And they're excited to talk about it too. It makes
[00:53:08] Allison Wood Brooks: everything better. So topic prep is a huge deal in our research what we find when you randomly
[00:53:13] Allison Wood Brooks: assign people to prep topics or not. The conversations where people have thought ahead even for 30
[00:53:19] Allison Wood Brooks: seconds, they feel less anxious. They're much smoother. There are fewer just fluency. So ums,
[00:53:24] Allison Wood Brooks: us, stutters between topics. They cover more topics, which is usually a good thing. More likely to land
[00:53:31] Allison Wood Brooks: on good topics. You're less likely to blurt. So you're less likely to share things that you don't
[00:53:35] Allison Wood Brooks: want to share with people. It's just an incredibly powerful strategy. And it doesn't need to be
[00:53:42] Allison Wood Brooks: complicated. I've gotten in the habit of putting like two or three bullet points for people in my
[00:53:46] Allison Wood Brooks: Google calendar notes when you know you have a meeting coming up. And you don't even have to do it
[00:53:51] Allison Wood Brooks: right before. Like, oh, a week ahead of time, if it pops in my head that I want to ask Steven about,
[00:53:56] Allison Wood Brooks: do you want to have children? I might write that as a little bullet point in my calendar note
[00:54:00] Allison Wood Brooks: for the time that I'm going to be here with you. And then I'll be more likely to remember it.
[00:54:05] Allison Wood Brooks: Do you feel a little skeptical about this? No. I was just thinking it probably makes you more,
[00:54:10] Stephen Bartlett: going back to the point about likeability, it probably makes you more, more likeable person.
[00:54:13] Stephen Bartlett: Much more likeable. Yeah. In fact, if you can achieve more of your goals, whether they're high
[00:54:19] Allison Wood Brooks: informational loan, informational high relational, low relational, all of that makes you more likeable.
[00:54:25] Allison Wood Brooks: You're seeing more competent. You seem more warm, especially when you lean towards those
[00:54:29] Allison Wood Brooks: prosocial high relational goals. Because everyone talks about how if you're interested in someone
[00:54:34] Stephen Bartlett: else like you're interested in cozy. Yes. That must have felt good for her, which must make her like
[00:54:39] Stephen Bartlett: you more. We should go ask her. That's a good point. I ask them, I have my students sometimes
[00:54:45] Allison Wood Brooks: you have a reflection task where I say, if you had to walk into a room and your your job was to
[00:54:49] Allison Wood Brooks: make people like you a one out of 10, a five out of 10, or a 10 out of 10, what are the behaviors
[00:54:56] Allison Wood Brooks: that you would do to try and pursue those three worlds? Okay. So if I wanted people to like me one
[00:55:01] Stephen Bartlett: out of 10. Yeah. What would you do? You tell me. You tell me. You're the expert. I want to hear your
[00:55:07] Allison Wood Brooks: guesses. My guesses. I would walk in quiet on my phone and I would ignore them. And maybe I'd look
[00:55:16] Stephen Bartlett: up and make some kind of snide comment. I definitely wouldn't notice that they were there.
[00:55:20] Stephen Bartlett: Yeah. And I wouldn't make eye contact with them. I would maybe be rid like maybe like take a phone
[00:55:30] Stephen Bartlett: call. I was going to say you need ones really low. You probably insults probably. Oh yeah, I'd offend
[00:55:36] Allison Wood Brooks: offend them. Yeah, offend them. Maybe take a phone call and then while you're on the phone call,
[00:55:41] Allison Wood Brooks: talk about how great you are. Or something like some sort of arrogance, etc.
[00:55:47] Allison Wood Brooks: Maybe if they try and talk to you, interrupt them. Yeah. And be like not now. Or look at my phone
[00:55:52] midway through what they're saying. Yeah. Okay. So there's lots of things you can imagine there.
[00:55:57] Allison Wood Brooks: Okay. Already we've touched on topics though, right? When you think about, okay, I'm talking
[00:56:02] Allison Wood Brooks: on the phone in front of them. And what am I going to be talking about that reduces my
[00:56:06] Allison Wood Brooks: likeability, even for someone who's like just observing you talking. That's great. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[00:56:11] Allison Wood Brooks: Yep. Yep. That's a good way to say you don't matter to me. Yeah. Yeah. Five out of 10 is an
[00:56:16] Allison Wood Brooks: interesting one. You want to do it probably more blasey like you engage with them, but not very well.
[00:56:23] Talk about small talk topics like you were saying, things that you could talk about with anyone
[00:56:27] Allison Wood Brooks: that are not personalized at all seem a bit disinterested, but not offensive. Just bland. Okay.
[00:56:35] Stephen Bartlett: Then we get to 10 out of 10 world. 10 out of 10 likeability. Yeah. What are you doing if you're
[00:56:41] Allison Wood Brooks: trying to get 10 out of 10? I am completely focused on them. Good. I'm attentive. I'm complimentary.
[00:56:47] Stephen Bartlett: I'm going to flatter them. Yep. Do you think it will seem obsequious? And I don't know if I get it right.
[00:56:53] Stephen Bartlett: Okay. Because I'm going to mean it. Yeah. Because it's going to be sincere. It's going to be really
[00:56:58] Stephen Bartlett: sincere. Yeah. I'm going to crack a great joke. Yes. Knock knock. Yeah. Who's there? I don't know.
[00:57:04] You're like, I don't know my panic. Exactly. So yeah, I'm going to flatter them. Crack jokes.
[00:57:10] Be very attentive. Get their name right. Ask them about their grandchild. Good. Okay. Let's pause.
[00:57:14] I want to in that description already, you're moving quite quickly through topics. As you're
[00:57:20] Allison Wood Brooks: interacting with them, you know that you can't be circling the drain talking about the weather
[00:57:26] Allison Wood Brooks: for long periods of time. So just briefly, let me say, we don't need to avoid small talk. In fact,
[00:57:32] it's a very important social ritual for people who are strangers to each other, people who haven't
[00:57:37] seen each other in a long time. It's where we land and say, oh, we're doing conversation now.
[00:57:42] Allison Wood Brooks: The mistake that people make is they stay there too long. Way too long. Any more than like one
[00:57:50] Allison Wood Brooks: beat of, oh my goodness, the weather's really warm. It's like summer in California. Then you
[00:57:57] Allison Wood Brooks: need to make it more personal and move up this topic pyramid towards medium talk, deep talk quickly.
[00:58:02] Allison Wood Brooks: Right. So small talk is at the bottom. These are topics anybody can talk about.
[00:58:06] Allison Wood Brooks: Tailored talk is more exciting, more personalized, more relevant to your interest. Deep talk is the
[00:58:12] Allison Wood Brooks: peak of this pyramid. Only we can talk about this thing in this special way. Not every conversation
[00:58:18] Allison Wood Brooks: is bound to get to the deep talk, but when it does, we should feel very appreciative. It's one of
[00:58:22] Allison Wood Brooks: the most magical things about being humans. So we don't need to get to deep talk with like the
[00:58:28] Allison Wood Brooks: barista at Starbucks or with your neighbor when they're taking out their trash, but it does happen
[00:58:33] Allison Wood Brooks: sometimes and it's quite lovely. I think I used to put girls off when I was a leaven because I used
[00:58:37] Stephen Bartlett: to ask them like the meaning of life too quickly on my mother's stolen Nokia phone. Yeah. And so
[00:58:41] Allison Wood Brooks: they would stop texting back. Yeah. So I think I learned early that like some people just don't
[00:58:46] Stephen Bartlett: well, the jokes on them now. Now you get to do it for your for your life's work. No, but I think
[00:58:50] Allison Wood Brooks: we're you were on to something there. It's not that you asked them about the meaning of life at all.
[00:58:54] Allison Wood Brooks: You asked it too quickly. So getting it's about the pacing as we move up here. Most people stay too
[00:59:00] Allison Wood Brooks: long at the bottom, but we also cannot jump to the top often. You kind of have to do the ritual
[00:59:06] Allison Wood Brooks: of climbing to feel like you get there in a natural way. And is that where relationships
[00:59:10] about deep ones for sure at the top moments at the top probably right. This is where vulnerability
[00:59:17] Allison Wood Brooks: takes you often asking lots of questions, especially follow up questions gets you up the pyramid
[00:59:23] Allison Wood Brooks: more quickly. So shall we shall we shift to the a of the talk framework because a is for asking
[00:59:32] Allison Wood Brooks: topics and asking are intimately tied to each other. The most common way that people switch
[00:59:37] Allison Wood Brooks: topics is by asking a question. So you can use questions like what are you excited about recently
[00:59:43] Allison Wood Brooks: or what has been your favorite guest to talk to or what have you and your girlfriend done together
[00:59:48] Allison Wood Brooks: recently. You can you do that to switch topics. Once you're on a topic, we use follow up questions
[00:59:54] Allison Wood Brooks: to kind of dive deeply and move up the topic pyramid. So you think I should ask more questions.
[01:00:01] Stephen Bartlett: Yes. Okay. Well, ask more than they're asking me. Maybe not you because you spend a lot of time
[01:00:07] Allison Wood Brooks: asking questions. But most people, the top line advice to make their conversations better is to ask
[01:00:13] Allison Wood Brooks: many more questions. Asking it sounds so simple and it's almost like everybody already knows that
[01:00:19] Allison Wood Brooks: but doing it in practice is quite hard and it's a skill. And people who do it well are more successful
[01:00:27] Allison Wood Brooks: on romantic dates. They're more successful in work meetings. They're more successful as
[01:00:32] Allison Wood Brooks: collaborators. They're more successful as entrepreneurs in getting funding. All of it hinges on
[01:00:38] Allison Wood Brooks: on question asking. So the top line advice just ask more questions. At the very least, don't be a zero
[01:00:45] Allison Wood Brooks: question asker. What happens to the fate of zero question askers? They're not they're not getting a
[01:00:50] Allison Wood Brooks: second date. They're not going to get that funding. They're not they're not learning enough about
[01:00:54] Allison Wood Brooks: their partner to enable them to succeed. If you go on a first date and you're asking zero questions
[01:01:01] Allison Wood Brooks: which like imagine that we've all sort of been on that date probably. You want to leave within 10
[01:01:07] Allison Wood Brooks: minutes. When you're in a first date you have so much to learn about each other. You have everything
[01:01:14] Allison Wood Brooks: to learn about each other. So if someone's not asking it's a real real real problem. Especially
[01:01:21] I think this is a very especially good hack for men in on heterosexual dates. Often what they're
[01:01:28] Allison Wood Brooks: getting wrong is that they're not asking enough questions. How did you know this? From data. From data.
[01:01:34] Stephen Bartlett: Yeah. So we have a thousand speed dates and we the outcome is does the other person want to go on a
[01:01:40] Allison Wood Brooks: second date with you? And we have transcripts. It was an amazing study run by this incredible
[01:01:46] Allison Wood Brooks: research group at Sanford about 10 years ago. And you can just measure it measure how many questions
[01:01:51] Allison Wood Brooks: they ask on each date. People who ask more questions are enormously more likely to get asked to
[01:01:57] Allison Wood Brooks: on a second date. So much so. Imagine you go on 21st dates. And I say, okay Steven you just have
[01:02:04] Allison Wood Brooks: to ask one extra question on those 20 dates. If you do you'll convert another date into a second date
[01:02:12] Allison Wood Brooks: from just one question per date. According to the data. Yes. It's true for both men and women.
[01:02:20] But it's particularly helpful for men because they ask fewer questions on average than women do.
[01:02:25] Allison Wood Brooks: Really? Yeah. Significantly less. Yes. And the other funny gender effect in the data is that
[01:02:31] Allison Wood Brooks: men are just more likely to agree to go on second dates. They're less discerning in general.
[01:02:36] But if they want if men want to get asked on the second date. Just ask more questions.
[01:02:41] Allison Wood Brooks: What is it me asking more questions doing to the other person? It makes them feel heard and like
[01:02:47] Allison Wood Brooks: you want to know their answer that you're interested in them. And so it signals your interest. But also
[01:02:52] Allison Wood Brooks: you learn what's in their mind and what their experience is which gives arms you with more information
[01:02:57] Allison Wood Brooks: that to then ask more better questions. So it's not just about asking more. Although that's a good start.
[01:03:03] Allison Wood Brooks: It's about asking fuck great follow up questions. The benefits of question asking are almost entirely
[01:03:10] Allison Wood Brooks: driven by the power of follow up questions. So what give me an example of asking a great follow up
[01:03:15] Stephen Bartlett: question? We're on a date. There's food. It's going really well. I've just shared with you that I
[01:03:21] Allison Wood Brooks: went on an amazing walk down the sunset strip this morning. And then I would say really oh my god
[01:03:27] Stephen Bartlett: I've always wanted to go tell me about it. Oh incredible. So I got to this point. I had never been
[01:03:34] Allison Wood Brooks: there before. There was I had to decide was like in a veer off and go see the Maryland Monroe
[01:03:40] Allison Wood Brooks: apartment which by the way is right next to the Frank Lloyd Wright house or was I going to go a
[01:03:45] Allison Wood Brooks: few blocks away was the Menendez brothers house. Who's that? Though two brothers who killed
[01:03:51] Allison Wood Brooks: their parents. Oh yeah. On Netflix. Yeah. So I would literally right in between and I was at this
[01:03:57] Allison Wood Brooks: crossroads. Do I choose cultured? Do I choose morbid curiosity? Which one did you choose? I went
[01:04:04] Allison Wood Brooks: with cultured. I was too afraid to find myself. You're so cute. So okay so we okay we're off our
[01:04:11] Allison Wood Brooks: date now. That was so fun. You were asking such lovely questions and it really helped to like
[01:04:17] Allison Wood Brooks: cheer me on. Like you actually wanted to hear this story. Even though it might like someone else
[01:04:23] Allison Wood Brooks: might have been like not that interested and then you feel embarrassed. Like oh I just shared
[01:04:28] Allison Wood Brooks: a bunch of vulnerable stuff. I was a walking alone in LA. I had morbid curiosity about these two
[01:04:35] Allison Wood Brooks: brothers in this story. It's very easy to make someone feel invalidated in that moment but
[01:04:41] Allison Wood Brooks: follow up questions make me feel like oh he wants to know more. He's coming with me on this journey.
[01:04:47] Allison Wood Brooks: So did I do the right thing then? Yeah you were doing great. Okay. Yeah. What's the wrong thing to
[01:04:50] Allison Wood Brooks: have done for me to just just imagine if I had been like oh I went this on an amazing walk down
[01:04:57] Allison Wood Brooks: the sunset strip and you said oh my favorite restaurant on the strip is a sushi place. Oh shit.
[01:05:01] Allison Wood Brooks: Um I I went to this amazing restaurant and I went to this amazing store. Yeah they carried our
[01:05:06] Allison Wood Brooks: meds. I bought an amazing pair of boots. People do that all the time. Constantly. So this is called
[01:05:11] Allison Wood Brooks: boomer asking. Boomer asking. Not because of boomers we love. I say it's for people of all ages.
[01:05:18] Allison Wood Brooks: Commit boomers. It's a boomerang. Oh I agree. So I say to you um. I lost subscribers. No we love
[01:05:25] Allison Wood Brooks: boomers. So I say to you like Steven what's your favorite restaurant? Mr. Chow. Oh I've been to
[01:05:30] Stephen Bartlett: Mr. Chow's. Last time I went to Mr. Chow's I went with a whole bunch of friends and I had a friend
[01:05:34] Allison Wood Brooks: who's really. So I've asked the question you've shared something with me that is such a gift
[01:05:40] Allison Wood Brooks: any sort of self-disclosure such a gift and instead of saying oh who did you go with or what did
[01:05:45] Allison Wood Brooks: you order or what is it like inside how did you like it um I bring it the focus of the conversation
[01:05:51] Allison Wood Brooks: right back to myself. People that do that don't know they do it. Correct. Because I will obviously
[01:05:58] Stephen Bartlett: you know I will go for dinner or we'll have I don't know 10 of my colleagues there and then sometimes
[01:06:03] Stephen Bartlett: I'll have one particular colleague who is doing exactly that. Yes. And they have no idea. Don't
[01:06:08] Stephen Bartlett: you want to be like stop. Yes. Just like ask them about their thing they're new here we're trying
[01:06:14] Stephen Bartlett: to make them feel comfortable. Even one follow-up question may be enough and so if you use this mindset
[01:06:20] Allison Wood Brooks: of like ask the next question before you pull it back to yourself it sometimes can be enough
[01:06:26] Allison Wood Brooks: probably many more follow-up questions is better but even just one where I was like oh who did you
[01:06:30] Allison Wood Brooks: go to Mr. Chow's with and I let you answer then I say oh I've been there too. You can see it
[01:06:35] Allison Wood Brooks: happening in the head because you say the word Mr. Chow's is your favorite restaurant and they
[01:06:39] Stephen Bartlett: imagine the association. I've got brilliant story about Mr. Chow's that I need to tell everybody.
[01:06:43] Stephen Bartlett: It makes sense that people do this our brains are incredibly are wired to be egocentric. We know
[01:06:49] Allison Wood Brooks: all of our lived experiences are own with 100% accuracy we lived it it's all up here so anything
[01:06:56] Allison Wood Brooks: that we see or hear in our conversations is of course going to trigger all of these memories
[01:07:01] Allison Wood Brooks: and associations in your mind about your lived experience and it's such an enemy of good conversation
[01:07:07] Allison Wood Brooks: because it constantly tugs you away from being interested in the other person first.
[01:07:12] Allison Wood Brooks: The other thing I've seen in meetings which I've had to have a conversation about historically
[01:07:17] Stephen Bartlett: is when someone will be talking and then someone's listening and going yeah yeah yeah yeah and I know
[01:07:22] Stephen Bartlett: I'm like oh my god they've got something to say and they're like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:07:26] Stephen Bartlett: they're hearing them out yes they're trying to get them into silence so that they can get their
[01:07:31] Stephen Bartlett: point across yes and I've had to send messages in the past I say by the way you were saying yeah yeah yeah
[01:07:36] Stephen Bartlett: yeah it made it seem to an objective observer like you weren't listening and actually you were just
[01:07:40] Stephen Bartlett: trying to say something so I just mean the interest of you were like you know maybe maybe don't just
[01:07:45] Allison Wood Brooks: don't say like how do they respond to that feeling well because I didn't I constructed it more tactfully
[01:07:50] than I just described but I thought about it a lot and I just wanted to because I'd seen them
[01:07:55] Stephen Bartlett: doing this 30 40 times in meetings yeah and I don't think they realize how it's perceived
[01:08:02] now you know how I feel during so many conversations for so many different there are so many things
[01:08:07] Allison Wood Brooks: like that where you see other people doing the dastardly conversational thing and it's totally
[01:08:14] understandable why they're excited they have a thing they want to say and it's preventing them
[01:08:20] Allison Wood Brooks: from actually engaging with the person who's talking and what they're saying all of these things
[01:08:26] Allison Wood Brooks: are understandable I it's important to come from a place of like non-judgment it's because our brains
[01:08:32] Allison Wood Brooks: were built to wander not focus on another person because we're deeply egocentric beings and we
[01:08:38] Allison Wood Brooks: focus on our own perspective both of those things hold us back from really being able to engage
[01:08:44] Allison Wood Brooks: with someone else I want to go back to your thing of like a 10 out of 10 like ability that those
[01:08:49] are the little things the little um death by a thousand cuts to your like ability are these things
[01:08:55] Allison Wood Brooks: where it's like you're not able to actually really focus on someone else and really engage with
[01:09:00] Allison Wood Brooks: what they're saying and ask follow-up questions and then later in the conversation call back to
[01:09:05] Allison Wood Brooks: something they said earlier because you're just that clever um are there so much stands in the way
[01:09:12] Allison Wood Brooks: of of doing that in that particular example I'm thinking about I started to get negative feedback
[01:09:19] Stephen Bartlett: from people that worked with this person and I noticed one day the negative feedback was I don't
[01:09:24] Stephen Bartlett: think they're even listening to me yeah um because they're not because they weren't really listening
[01:09:29] Stephen Bartlett: and so the minute I got the feedback was the minute I thought you know actually even you've you've
[01:09:32] Stephen Bartlett: watched this happen you know it's objectively true you owe it because you're this person's
[01:09:38] Stephen Bartlett: report to have a conversation with them about it because it's getting in the way of their success
[01:09:42] Stephen Bartlett: the fascinating thing for me is if I plot everybody I know and work with on an axis of like self-awareness
[01:09:47] Stephen Bartlett: as a relative to their communication yeah some people are just they kind of just got to have it
[01:09:53] Stephen Bartlett: and then some people are on the other end of this spectrum where there's like no apparent
[01:09:58] Stephen Bartlett: self-awareness of like how they're coming across yeah and they're so talented and so hard working
[01:10:04] Stephen Bartlett: but this one thing of like their communication self-awareness is honestly in some cases the
[01:10:10] Stephen Bartlett: single thing the single gravitational force on that career trajectory yes and like can people change
[01:10:16] Stephen Bartlett: or is it just like a genetic thing they can let first let me address there are pros and cons to
[01:10:22] Allison Wood Brooks: being at both ends of that spectrum if you are too hyper vigilant and too self-aware it can be
[01:10:28] Allison Wood Brooks: distracting it might mean that you're sort of people pleasing too which can lead to burnout and
[01:10:33] Allison Wood Brooks: exhaustion if you're at this lack of self-awareness and of course it's going to be a real problem and so
[01:10:41] I love teaching and coaching people at that end because you can become more self-aware
[01:10:47] so many of my students at Harvard come into the course and that's how they are what you mean
[01:10:52] they are not aware of what their strengths and weaknesses are they don't know what they're doing
[01:10:58] Allison Wood Brooks: right and wrong they just know they either hate conversation or aren't good at it and so just
[01:11:05] Allison Wood Brooks: by going through this talk course they become much more sort of clear-eyed and open to the fact that
[01:11:10] Allison Wood Brooks: conversation is a skill that matters profoundly not in a sort of soft skill fuzzy way but as
[01:11:17] Allison Wood Brooks: a quantifiable way that impacts everything that matters to them like at the bottom line almost
[01:11:24] Allison Wood Brooks: is like an economic value to them and so just having their eyes open to the fact that like this is
[01:11:29] Allison Wood Brooks: a skill and a skill they need to get better at even if I don't see them getting massively better in
[01:11:34] Allison Wood Brooks: the course of three months it means that they are likely to get better at it over the longer term
[01:11:38] Allison Wood Brooks: because now they know now they get it and now they know that they aren't great at it yet
[01:11:43] the world of business looks entirely different today than it did 15 years ago back then building a
[01:11:47] Stephen Bartlett: brand meant having huge budgets warehouse is office space and lots and lots of staff but now you can
[01:11:52] Stephen Bartlett: start a business with your laptop and idea and the right tools and I would know more so than
[01:11:57] Stephen Bartlett: anybody else because that's exactly what I did Shopify is one of our long-standing sponsors on
[01:12:00] Stephen Bartlett: the show and they're a brand I often refer people to when they're starting their businesses
[01:12:04] Stephen Bartlett: because it's a tool that contains many more tools within itself and when you're starting out
[01:12:09] Stephen Bartlett: everything is everywhere it's messy and it's confusing so having everything in the same place
[01:12:13] Stephen Bartlett: is incredibly useful Shopify puts store design payments inventory shipping and even AI tools
[01:12:19] Stephen Bartlett: all in one place and you can sell directly from your website or on social media essentially wherever
[01:12:24] Stephen Bartlett: your customers spend their time it's truly a brilliant business tool so if you want to give it a
[01:12:29] Stephen Bartlett: go head to Shopify.com slash Bartlett and sign up for your $1 per month trial period that
[01:12:36] Stephen Bartlett: Shopify.com slash Bartlett are there anything else that you know we talked about death by a thousand
[01:12:42] Stephen Bartlett: cuts as it relates to being a ten out of ten conversation list and like a likable person are there
[01:12:46] Stephen Bartlett: any of these other small things that we do which are harming us by tiny that most people don't know
[01:12:53] Stephen Bartlett: they're doing let's move to K and because I'm moving along in this framework we're
[01:12:58] Allison Wood Brooks: going to skipping out for now which we would never skip out forever K is for kindness
[01:13:03] Allison Wood Brooks: often we're all taught this virtue of kindness when we're children and spend the rest of our
[01:13:10] Allison Wood Brooks: lives sort of falling short of actually doing it in practice I've ever been obsessed with this idea
[01:13:16] Allison Wood Brooks: of what are like people who are actually kind what are they thinking about and how are they
[01:13:21] Allison Wood Brooks: interacting with other people what kinds of choices are they making how do they talk to other people
[01:13:25] Allison Wood Brooks: and so when you say death by a thousand cuts there are these sort of mistakes that we make in
[01:13:30] Allison Wood Brooks: the respectfulness of our language that undermine our actual kindness to other people making sure
[01:13:36] Allison Wood Brooks: you use someone's name you gave this example and the one out of ten is like use the wrong name
[01:13:41] Allison Wood Brooks: that is really meaningful you need to know people's names and use them correctly and with appropriate
[01:13:46] formality right sometimes it's wonderful to say like hey honey and sometimes you need to say
[01:13:52] Allison Wood Brooks: it's nice to meet you doctor Brooks right like it you need to be able to read that
[01:13:57] there is this paper where they studied conversations between police officers and citizens in Oakland
[01:14:04] Allison Wood Brooks: actually close to here in normal traffic stops so when police pulled over citizens and walked up to
[01:14:10] Allison Wood Brooks: the car and said you were speeding you know and they used body cam footage and got all the transcripts
[01:14:16] Allison Wood Brooks: from these interactions and then measured the respectfulness of the language that the police
[01:14:20] Allison Wood Brooks: officers were using there are some really you know not surprising but terrible findings that police
[01:14:27] Allison Wood Brooks: officers were using less respectful language towards black citizens compared to white citizens but
[01:14:33] Allison Wood Brooks: sort of more broadly speaking the interactions where they were using more respectful language
[01:14:38] Allison Wood Brooks: went better there were less conflicts there were they they walked they drive away without further
[01:14:43] Allison Wood Brooks: infractions so the tiny choices we make in our language and the language of respect is varies
[01:14:52] Allison Wood Brooks: along like hundreds of features of language and it's a very gradient concept but they have a real
[01:14:58] Allison Wood Brooks: impact on how these interactions go when we think about sort of like things like systemic racial bias
[01:15:05] Allison Wood Brooks: that's it comes from that kind of stuff that's where it leaks out is in the language we use with
[01:15:11] Allison Wood Brooks: each other so we can all you learn to use more respectful language do you think much about
[01:15:19] Stephen Bartlett: how our emotional state is impacting our ability to accomplish any of these things because I think
[01:15:25] Stephen Bartlett: you know the days where I'm least likely to be kind are the days where I haven't slept yeah
[01:15:29] Allison Wood Brooks: I should probably be avoiding all conversations that day it's really I think one of the biggest
[01:15:34] Allison Wood Brooks: things I've learned from all of this work is that conversation is remarkably effortful and it
[01:15:39] requires quite a bit of energy even if you know how to be a good conversationalist often we don't
[01:15:45] Allison Wood Brooks: have the energy to actually do it oh I don't have the energy to brainstorm topics I don't have the
[01:15:50] Allison Wood Brooks: energy to continue asking follow up questions I'm going to let my ego centrist them take over and
[01:15:55] Allison Wood Brooks: boomer ask till the sun comes down goes down not boomers I'm going to accidentally use disrespectful
[01:16:06] Allison Wood Brooks: language and not repair that not correct it that's kind of what keeps me up at night is that
[01:16:10] Allison Wood Brooks: human beings do have limitations we are limited in time we're limited in energy our brains are not
[01:16:16] super computers and so in practice people who are great communicators will often fall short of
[01:16:23] Allison Wood Brooks: their own hopes because they don't have the energy to do it I think Brunei Brown said to me that
[01:16:29] Stephen Bartlett: when she comes home and she's out of energy she'll just say to her partner listen I'm on 10%
[01:16:33] Stephen Bartlett: today's what can't deal with this now in what talk about self-awareness boy if you can do that if
[01:16:38] Allison Wood Brooks: you can say and you have sturdy enough relationships at work and at home that you could say dude I'm
[01:16:44] Allison Wood Brooks: like a two out of 10 you got to cut me a break today it would be tremendously helpful it requires
[01:16:49] Allison Wood Brooks: quite a bit of self-awareness to recognize that you're at a two out of 10 and a lot of grace from
[01:16:56] Allison Wood Brooks: the people around you which means that you're going to have to give them grace in response at some
[01:17:01] Allison Wood Brooks: point that's what good relationships are and the L shall we put them in the correct order
[01:17:09] Allison Wood Brooks: yeah okay L is for levity so we've talked a bit about difficult conversations and how they can
[01:17:15] Allison Wood Brooks: so easily get overheated when you think about chats that go off the rails it's quite easy to think
[01:17:22] Allison Wood Brooks: of hostile conflict difficult conversations because they're very salient they're very memorable
[01:17:28] there's might be shouting there's going to be hurt feelings defensiveness the more common enemy
[01:17:33] Allison Wood Brooks: of conversation is actually boredom and disengagement so yes do we get annoyed with each other
[01:17:40] Allison Wood Brooks: absolutely but almost every conversation has stints of disengagement where people aren't interested
[01:17:47] Allison Wood Brooks: and so levity is humor and warmth to help us avoid disinterest and boredom and levity is important
[01:17:57] Allison Wood Brooks: for sort of happiness and engagement sake itself you know it matters that we're enjoying our time
[01:18:02] Allison Wood Brooks: together but maybe even more profoundly if we are not leaning towards each other and interested in
[01:18:09] Allison Wood Brooks: what the other person is saying we can't achieve any of our other goals good conversation requires
[01:18:15] Allison Wood Brooks: mutual engagement so if I'm bored and my mind is wandering which happens a lot because I have
[01:18:19] Allison Wood Brooks: attentional issues it happens to a lot of people a lot the human mind wanders 25% of the time
[01:18:26] Allison Wood Brooks: during conversation so it's quite common if your mind is wandering and you're not engaged with
[01:18:33] Allison Wood Brooks: each other then you can't do anything else either persuasion making decisions together brainstorming
[01:18:38] Allison Wood Brooks: connecting none of it so the L is very important because it makes things fun and enjoyable but it's
[01:18:45] Allison Wood Brooks: also important because we need to stay here with each other and not disengage what if you're not
[01:18:52] Stephen Bartlett: a warm person it's so much I think you say to me you're very serious I'm like ready I'm I think I
[01:19:01] come across this series sometimes I think you may come across as serious I think but you do come
[01:19:06] Allison Wood Brooks: across as very warm and so that's an important distinction you're using flatter I've seen that
[01:19:11] Stephen Bartlett: when you're accomplished I'm not I'm giving I'm giving very direct feedback so there's levity is
[01:19:22] Allison Wood Brooks: two parts it's humor and warmth and I always start this part of my class at Harvard by saying to
[01:19:27] Allison Wood Brooks: my students if you're not funny and you think you never will be it's okay because I don't think I'm
[01:19:35] Allison Wood Brooks: going to be the one to make you funny within the span of two months if you are a deeply serious
[01:19:40] Allison Wood Brooks: unfunny person other people I believe that you can get funny or over time we can talk about that in
[01:19:45] Allison Wood Brooks: a moment what I do deeply believe is that anyone can be more warm so warmth moves include anything
[01:19:53] Allison Wood Brooks: expressing gratitude I'm so grateful for your time today I'm so grateful for you engaging with
[01:19:57] Allison Wood Brooks: the content of my work flattery giving compliments just shifting topics so if you can get better at
[01:20:04] Allison Wood Brooks: sensing when people are getting bored with a topic and getting more courageous and assertive
[01:20:09] Allison Wood Brooks: about switching more frequently can be very very helpful for keeping the conversations sort of bubbling
[01:20:14] Allison Wood Brooks: along callbacks callbacks are any reference back to something that you've talked about previously
[01:20:23] they're total magic it shows that you were listening to someone earlier in the conversation maybe
[01:20:30] Allison Wood Brooks: even earlier in your relationship like a month ago if I can call back to something we talked about
[01:20:35] Allison Wood Brooks: it shows I heard you I was thinking about what you said I was able to retain it in my mind and
[01:20:42] Allison Wood Brooks: I'm clever enough to reference back to it now and often it has this really amazing quality where if
[01:20:49] Allison Wood Brooks: I bring it up again it's funny because you're like oh shit that's super clever um often people
[01:20:56] Allison Wood Brooks: a lot of people ask me how do we end conversations well and I have two pieces of advice there I'm
[01:21:01] Allison Wood Brooks: going to bring this back to callbacks one is nobody knows when to end conversations it's the final
[01:21:07] Allison Wood Brooks: topic switch it's the final coordination choice there's no way to know there's no right answer
[01:21:12] so it's better to just end it like be assertive walk away rather than hemming and hawing and feeling
[01:21:17] Allison Wood Brooks: bad and embarrassed about it the second piece of advice is that it's a great time to try a callback
[01:21:23] Allison Wood Brooks: the very last beat of the conversation you can say and I hope you have a great time with your
[01:21:28] Allison Wood Brooks: girlfriend this weekend right like whatever they they they had mentioned now I'm going to go we're
[01:21:32] Allison Wood Brooks: going to go to see this movie I hope you have a great time at the movie this weekend right showing
[01:21:36] Stephen Bartlett: that like oh I heard you 30 minutes ago when you told me this thing that can help to smooth the
[01:21:41] Allison Wood Brooks: exit ramp away I find it really useful to give people my email address to end a conversation
[01:21:47] that's so interesting it just ends the conversation immediately yeah someone will come up to me and say
[01:21:53] Stephen Bartlett: hey I've got this business idea on a pitch and then they'll start pitching and if I could do not send
[01:21:57] Stephen Bartlett: me here's my email the conversation and I shake the hand the conversation ends immediately do you
[01:22:01] feel it is dismissive maybe however in the context of like being in the gym yeah and I'm like
[01:22:09] Allison Wood Brooks: mid-set yeah that's there someone comes over and says I and I go oh here's my email here's if you
[01:22:14] Stephen Bartlett: want to it seems to end the conversation and it feels to be like please help me here what would be
[01:22:20] a better way to I know I think that's quite good because it could be perceived as a little dismissive
[01:22:26] Allison Wood Brooks: but that person in the gym is gonna be like yeah I probably doesn't want to talk about my business
[01:22:30] Allison Wood Brooks: while he's you know lifting and you're opening the door to them you're saying I really would love
[01:22:35] Allison Wood Brooks: to receive an email from you it is my real email is what I'm not giving out a fake comment yeah
[01:22:40] Stephen Bartlett: exactly yeah you should feel like a jerk if you were giving out a fake email I do read them yeah exactly
[01:22:46] Allison Wood Brooks: depending on your tolerant I also don't I think most people wouldn't be excited about having a
[01:22:52] Allison Wood Brooks: deep conversation with a stranger at the gym and I think giving yourself grace for that
[01:22:58] is also helpful like it doesn't make you a bad person I think of an important thing that we take
[01:23:03] Allison Wood Brooks: from the book in this course is like talking more is not always the answer often it's not often
[01:23:11] Allison Wood Brooks: it's important it's these low informational goals right like protecting your time protecting your
[01:23:17] Allison Wood Brooks: mental health some people most people are under social loneliness is a real problem they don't have
[01:23:24] Allison Wood Brooks: enough friends they're not connected enough but some people probably are over connected and your
[01:23:30] Allison Wood Brooks: social portfolio is too large and there's too many people who need too many things from you and so
[01:23:34] Allison Wood Brooks: thinking carefully about what are your strategies to sort of stave off over conversation is quite
[01:23:40] Allison Wood Brooks: worthwhile and is this intrava ambava extravast stuff real it's a great question people have preferences
[01:23:47] Allison Wood Brooks: about what makes them feel connected to other people some people would love to go to that party with
[01:23:54] Allison Wood Brooks: a hundred famous people tell me about Zara in my team said that the thing she wants to do on a
[01:23:58] Stephen Bartlett: Friday after really really really really really busy week is she wants to go to a busy coffee shop
[01:24:03] Stephen Bartlett: and be around loads of people and I was like what she goes yeah it recharges me I'm like what are
[01:24:06] Stephen Bartlett: you like psych about yeah and then there's me who after the same week all I want to do is being a
[01:24:13] Stephen Bartlett: dark cold rain yep oh my god yep totally and both of those are fair and fine and knowing that about
[01:24:21] Allison Wood Brooks: yourself is really helpful I don't know is that relates to introversion and extraversion as much as
[01:24:26] Allison Wood Brooks: like where what are your preferences for conversation it's both about how frequently who do you want to
[01:24:32] Allison Wood Brooks: be interacting with and what topics are exciting is she going to that coffee shop and talking about
[01:24:37] Allison Wood Brooks: work still or is she like no I can't wait to talk about this weird other stuff to try and get work
[01:24:41] Allison Wood Brooks: off my mind but there's those people though in society we all know them that are like around people
[01:24:46] Stephen Bartlett: they just become like a social butterfly yeah yeah yeah they're like talk loads they're really
[01:24:50] Stephen Bartlett: engaged they're energized by it sure and then there's us lot who are just drained by that stuff
[01:24:56] Stephen Bartlett: and I look at these people and get I'm almost jealous of them I get I don't know how you do that
[01:25:00] Stephen Bartlett: sometimes for sure whether you when you get excited around lots of people can be a huge advantage
[01:25:07] Allison Wood Brooks: because we need to do that sometimes I actually think I'm possibly a better indicator of
[01:25:12] Allison Wood Brooks: introversion might be if you went into a party or you were in a group conversation and it was super
[01:25:17] Allison Wood Brooks: awkward nobody's talking do you feel like it's your job to fix it extraverts would be like that's
[01:25:26] Allison Wood Brooks: my number one job in life I am the what don't worry I'm here I'm here to save the awkwardness
[01:25:34] Allison Wood Brooks: introverts are often like I'm gonna go loiter by the guacamole this is not my problem and I don't
[01:25:40] Allison Wood Brooks: want no part of it yeah so sometimes it's not even about the number of people that are around but
[01:25:45] Allison Wood Brooks: how you're managing conversation I just put a new quiz on my website that helps people figure out
[01:25:51] Allison Wood Brooks: what are your preferences what are your natural habits in tricky situations like that
[01:25:56] and it gives you a sort of typo type what type are you do you tend to sort of be avoidant do
[01:26:01] Allison Wood Brooks: tend to approach and try and fix things and then strategies to use and what you see in terms of
[01:26:07] Stephen Bartlett: percentages there and different find out it's new it's new yeah yeah we're just launching it so I'm
[01:26:11] Allison Wood Brooks: gonna find out and does have classifications in terms of like yeah how many classifications yeah
[01:26:16] Stephen Bartlett: so it's only three types that you could be with this quiz and then sort of like strategies that
[01:26:22] Allison Wood Brooks: whatever your type is this is going to help you in terms of topics asking levity and kindness
[01:26:27] Allison Wood Brooks: and what are the three categories one could be so some one person could be sort of an approach
[01:26:32] Allison Wood Brooks: person who's like and I guess probably correlated with extraversion we'll find out
[01:26:38] if it's awkward and quiet you're the one that wants to jump in and fix it there are pros and
[01:26:42] Allison Wood Brooks: cons to this too if you jump in and you might say things and do things that you don't actually aren't
[01:26:49] Allison Wood Brooks: very proud of and might lower your value correct yeah there are avoiders who are like no thank you
[01:26:55] Allison Wood Brooks: I'm just gonna I'm gonna stay here but I'm gonna not say anything and then there are people who are
[01:26:59] Allison Wood Brooks: like I'm out of here this party sucks right like they're the exit the exit people I feel attacked
[01:27:05] no but I you know this interesting because is it true that some people who overtalk are less
[01:27:12] Stephen Bartlett: respected can you over talk I I had this this thought many years ago based on again observations
[01:27:18] Stephen Bartlett: I'd seen in boardrooms that I'd been in and I'd see 12 of my team members in a boardroom
[01:27:23] Stephen Bartlett: trying to come to an idea for a campaign we were doing yeah and I noticed that one particular person
[01:27:28] Stephen Bartlett: who I shot name many years ago in our New York office would talk so much and two I would say too
[01:27:36] Stephen Bartlett: much to the extent that the next time they spoke I could see everybody in the room not paying
[01:27:42] Stephen Bartlett: attention in discounting it before it had come so I came up with this idea I was like I think we
[01:27:45] Stephen Bartlett: all have a contribution score yeah like a credit score love that and it's based on how thoughtful
[01:27:52] Stephen Bartlett: and valuable our previous contributions have been yeah and what I would see is with this particular
[01:27:59] Stephen Bartlett: person I should call her Katie the minute she spoke halfway through her first sentence I could see
[01:28:03] Stephen Bartlett: the person's next to her basically just pre rebuttling it yeah like pre dismissing it yeah
[01:28:09] Stephen Bartlett: and then on the contrary there's another particular person in our in our Manchester office back in
[01:28:13] Stephen Bartlett: the day who spoke so little that the minute they spoke it was like the room fell silent and we all
[01:28:19] Stephen Bartlett: just swung our heads over to them yeah because you're like here comes a really good take yeah so I
[01:28:23] Stephen Bartlett: thought everybody has a contribution score protect yours yes so group conversation is incredibly
[01:28:28] Allison Wood Brooks: complicated and one of the most difficult things is so obvious is just how do we share airtime
[01:28:34] Allison Wood Brooks: there are always going to be people who have high power tend to take up more airtime just naturally
[01:28:40] it's something that high power people need to fight against because it's not productive
[01:28:44] Allison Wood Brooks: it makes lower power people feel like they're not welcome to join but then if you just look at
[01:28:49] Allison Wood Brooks: airtime balance the person who's dominating the airtime that is not productive and right like
[01:28:54] Allison Wood Brooks: especially if they're not the expert okay that's where things get problematic you can imagine a
[01:28:59] Allison Wood Brooks: balance where okay there might be a group where we are all dying to hear we need to talk about aerospace
[01:29:05] Allison Wood Brooks: engineering and only one out of the ten of us is an aerospace engineer I want to hear that guy talk
[01:29:11] Allison Wood Brooks: for 45 minutes and I want to learn everything I possibly can in that in that time the it becomes
[01:29:17] Allison Wood Brooks: problematic when the person dominating the airtime is not the sole expert or maybe not an expert
[01:29:23] Allison Wood Brooks: at all there's another piece to this and I love your idea of a contribution score where talking is not
[01:29:30] Allison Wood Brooks: the only way to add value to a group there are so many roles that people play there are time keepers
[01:29:37] Allison Wood Brooks: there's someone who's writing on the board at the same time often the person holding the pen
[01:29:41] Allison Wood Brooks: ends up being the most powerful person because they're making diagrams and taking notes and they decide
[01:29:46] Allison Wood Brooks: what is worthy of being up on the board there are people who keep the agenda so we're saying okay
[01:29:51] Allison Wood Brooks: here are the topics we want to talk about here the goals we came in with we want to make this decision
[01:29:56] Allison Wood Brooks: I'd like to note that we haven't moved to the pasture where we're going to make the decision
[01:30:00] Allison Wood Brooks: right the person who is sort of facilitating the meeting becomes very valuable so there's all kinds
[01:30:08] Allison Wood Brooks: of so there's goals there's roles in a group and then there's the soul the warmth of it all
[01:30:14] Allison Wood Brooks: the other thing in line with that that I've noticed from people with a low contribution score in
[01:30:19] Stephen Bartlett: businesses that I've got whatever is their bad switches and it appears to be linked what I mean by
[01:30:26] Stephen Bartlett: bad switcher is the group will be talking about I see yes yes yes yes yes they're unwilling to go where
[01:30:33] Allison Wood Brooks: the group wants to go they come they keep coming back to their thing or they're they're like it
[01:30:38] yeah or something completely unrelated yeah as if they just needed to say something yeah
[01:30:42] Stephen Bartlett: and it just it veers the group off the subject so the group are talking about let's just say
[01:30:48] Stephen Bartlett: we're talking about a campaign we're doing for Starbucks and we're saying do you think we should do
[01:30:53] Stephen Bartlett: an event in Manhattan and because it it almost seems like they can't not talk they'll say
[01:31:01] I went on holiday to Manhattan once and it was and it was it was voted in the top 15 on the
[01:31:08] Stephen Bartlett: Forbes list of best places to go and you just go and you just look and go what that's not one
[01:31:12] Stephen Bartlett: what if that person let me play devil's out of your purse like it what if they made a joke about
[01:31:18] Allison Wood Brooks: New York that was actually funny slightly off topic great but actually funny and then you get
[01:31:22] Allison Wood Brooks: right back into right right it's great so it's not about in that case it's not about bad switching
[01:31:28] Allison Wood Brooks: it's about egocentrism you're not reading the room well you're not serving the goals of the group
[01:31:35] Allison Wood Brooks: yeah right levity moments of levity often are about briefly switching to an adjacent topic and then
[01:31:41] Allison Wood Brooks: switching back yeah and it's actually worth that side bar because it's fun and everybody's like oh
[01:31:48] Allison Wood Brooks: thank god an angel like circle the drain on New York for a million more minutes the problem is
[01:31:54] Allison Wood Brooks: this guy is chiming in being like let me tell you about the time I went to New York yeah and
[01:31:59] Stephen Bartlett: the collective are trying to go in one direction actually think this about this a lot in the
[01:32:03] Stephen Bartlett: context of podcasting I would hate to have a co-host and it would be very hard it would be so hard
[01:32:10] Stephen Bartlett: because in my mind there's a particular direction I'm going in yes and if they one aligned with
[01:32:16] Stephen Bartlett: the direction I'm going in it's rough I mean you see it sometimes with on podcast with a co-host
[01:32:20] Stephen Bartlett: where they're going in a direction talking about immigration they say like but wait wait wait
[01:32:24] Allison Wood Brooks: just one thing one quick thing before we move on and then you go back to a different direction
[01:32:28] Stephen Bartlett: oh no and as a viewer you're like oh you are making progress towards the crux of the issue but this
[01:32:33] Stephen Bartlett: but I think that's what I'm talking about like how would you make sure you're moving in the right
[01:32:36] Stephen Bartlett: direction is the group and it's and this is a great example because we we often think of one on
[01:32:42] Allison Wood Brooks: one conversation is the same task as a three person group as soon as a third person pulls up a
[01:32:48] Allison Wood Brooks: chair whether it's a podcast co-host or a friend at a bar that task it's a categorically
[01:32:54] Allison Wood Brooks: different task now because that third person has the power to take you on side bars it's no longer
[01:33:01] Allison Wood Brooks: being co-created intimately between two minds all of a sudden we get into this like coordination
[01:33:06] Allison Wood Brooks: kerfuffle that can be very very frustrating I suspect that's part of why you don't like groups
[01:33:12] Allison Wood Brooks: actually is that you like so strongly prefer one on one yeah I think that's true I think that's
[01:33:19] Stephen Bartlett: true I prefer one on one I prefer the depth and small torque feels are like really disingenuous
[01:33:26] Stephen Bartlett: sometimes I push you do you think it's about control because I imagine you had a co-host the problem
[01:33:33] Allison Wood Brooks: the reason you feel so frustrated with that yes it's about the flow of a conversation getting
[01:33:38] Allison Wood Brooks: to a magical moment it's also like oh you have to like relinquish control to someone else in that
[01:33:43] Allison Wood Brooks: moment it's interesting because I was with a colleague of mine the other day and we were interviewing
[01:33:50] Stephen Bartlett: some people so we just say we're interviewing three people yeah the first interview I told her
[01:33:56] Stephen Bartlett: to lead the interview and I enjoyed the interview because I could watch her go in her direction
[01:34:01] Stephen Bartlett: felt very like a straight line the second interview I didn't say anything and what happened is
[01:34:06] Stephen Bartlett: I started asking them a question now I'm sat there asking this guy a question because I'm trying
[01:34:10] Stephen Bartlett: to figure out this particular answer so I'm kind of like circling this issue not kind of giving it
[01:34:14] Stephen Bartlett: away and I'm getting one step closer and another step closer and then my colleague comes in and asks
[01:34:20] Stephen Bartlett: a completely different question and you're like oh and I'm like oh no I was like so close to figuring
[01:34:25] Stephen Bartlett: out this thing about them that I suspect is a red flag so like and then she came and asked a question
[01:34:31] Stephen Bartlett: and then I'm set the guy on my guard no no I have to go right back to this completely different
[01:34:34] Stephen Bartlett: subject I'm not going to get your answer so anyway afterwards I had a conversation with her and I said
[01:34:39] Stephen Bartlett: listen when we do interviews I think we need to clarify who's leading that's right I'll sit and listen
[01:34:43] Stephen Bartlett: when you do it then when I do it you sit and you know and so I think that's part of it that's part
[01:34:48] Stephen Bartlett: of the roles thing I was talking about before too right like there's this the roles of like you're
[01:34:52] Allison Wood Brooks: scribing you're keeping time whatever but also being having clarity about like who's the topic
[01:34:58] Allison Wood Brooks: leader here yeah and clarity especially in a group of three can be incredibly helpful in lack of it
[01:35:04] Allison Wood Brooks: is chaotic and nightmare yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what is the most important thing we haven't talked
[01:35:09] Stephen Bartlett: about as it relates to likability and having great conversations and dislikeability if that's a word
[01:35:15] I want to distance ourselves from likability I think likability is one very narrow goal of good
[01:35:20] Allison Wood Brooks: conversation what are the things do people care about do you know why you certain words tell me
[01:35:26] is because the audience have told me yeah so I take what they care about please they care about
[01:35:30] Allison Wood Brooks: dealing with narcissists good they care about and how to have because they struggle with it
[01:35:36] I guess so yeah yeah it's an interesting label it's very accusatory of other people very
[01:35:40] Allison Wood Brooks: just to read yeah because I think everybody thinks the person they disagree with the narcissist
[01:35:45] Stephen Bartlett: it's like a nice way to like just so an a reframe of it is they struggle with
[01:35:50] Allison Wood Brooks: disagreement yeah okay the other thing is they care a lot about
[01:35:54] Stephen Bartlett: difficult conversations it's the pain of their life they struggle with them they avoid them
[01:35:59] Stephen Bartlett: they think if they could only get good at it then they'd be everything they want to be yeah they
[01:36:02] Stephen Bartlett: care about being liked yeah they care about avoiding things that make them dislike that they're unaware
[01:36:09] Stephen Bartlett: of doing I would say I guess the fifth one is they they care a lot about persuasion remarkably and
[01:36:19] Stephen Bartlett: Julian Treasure who did that Ted talk about speaking told me this people don't really care much
[01:36:24] Stephen Bartlett: about listening yeah yeah because they don't know it's funny it's it's so interesting to hear you say
[01:36:31] Allison Wood Brooks: those things to me those are all very related to each other and revealing that people don't have great
[01:36:39] Allison Wood Brooks: instincts about their strengths and weaknesses and what's hard and easy about conversation
[01:36:45] Allison Wood Brooks: persuasion difficult conversations thinking other people are narcissists and being liked
[01:36:54] they're all related to mismanaging conflict and disagreement and have is struggling to manage
[01:37:01] Allison Wood Brooks: moments of difficulty well the social landscape of all conversation is so much broader than people
[01:37:09] Allison Wood Brooks: realize I think because you were so narrowly focused on these very noticeable memorable salient moments
[01:37:19] of disagreement that were like oh shit that's hard and we got mad and it ruined and we broke up
[01:37:24] Allison Wood Brooks: of course but you're also super boring like 80% of the time and also you're you're not really
[01:37:32] Allison Wood Brooks: listening other people you're missing so many opportunities to actually learn from people because
[01:37:37] Allison Wood Brooks: you're not listening you're not asking enough follow-up questions you're not asking enough questions
[01:37:42] Allison Wood Brooks: at all you're talking too much time talking about yourself like obviously this is what people like
[01:37:47] Stephen Bartlett: because the thing that I will remember the most is the conflict the issue the problem the emotional
[01:37:53] Stephen Bartlett: situation yeah people don't think they're boring like no it's it's hard to it's such a it's a much
[01:37:59] Allison Wood Brooks: harder thing to notice yeah and it's a much harder thing to get feedback about because no one's
[01:38:05] Allison Wood Brooks: going to be like hey bro you're boring yeah and if the things I'm interested in by way of me being
[01:38:10] Stephen Bartlett: interested I think they're interesting yeah so I think that I'm just making stuff at Pokemon
[01:38:15] Stephen Bartlett: I think that's the most important interesting thing in the world and let me now tell you everything
[01:38:19] Allison Wood Brooks: I know about Pokemon yeah it's like this it's like this misunderstanding of what is the purpose of
[01:38:24] Allison Wood Brooks: conversation is not to say things we know at other people it's about finding things we're both
[01:38:30] Allison Wood Brooks: interested in and then learning everything that you know about that like now I'm just gonna
[01:38:36] like take a journey through your brain of everything that you think and feel about this thing
[01:38:40] Allison Wood Brooks: that we're both interested in and on that journey we might land in this magical place where
[01:38:45] Allison Wood Brooks: I'm learning stuff from you you find me quite charming we're laughing together and we feel seen and
[01:38:50] Allison Wood Brooks: known and understood but it's definitely not going to be me telling you about Pokemon if you're
[01:38:55] Allison Wood Brooks: deeply disinterested in it and there's just the difference between being interesting and
[01:38:59] Stephen Bartlett: interested we think yes like I think that the game of being interesting is to show you life is not
[01:39:06] Allison Wood Brooks: about walking through life giving like many speeches or like many TED talks right it's about
[01:39:13] Allison Wood Brooks: conversational conversation is interactive it's co-created with two independent minds
[01:39:18] Allison Wood Brooks: entrepreneurs make this mistake a lot too they they may be driven by you know dragon's
[01:39:24] Allison Wood Brooks: dead and shark tank you feel like it's not your fault you feel like you need to stand up there
[01:39:30] Allison Wood Brooks: and like pitch your idea and in order to be successful you give the most compelling public speech
[01:39:36] Allison Wood Brooks: about it most entrepreneurs or business owners actually are talking to investors and colleagues
[01:39:42] Allison Wood Brooks: and potential partner strategic partners in conversation and so before you get to the point where
[01:39:47] Allison Wood Brooks: you're like let me tell you about my amazing company you need to ask them a million questions
[01:39:52] Allison Wood Brooks: and get to know them and understand what their pain points are and how many kids they have and
[01:39:57] Allison Wood Brooks: what they actually care about so if you're lucky the thing that and product or service you have
[01:40:03] Allison Wood Brooks: actually fills that need and be like guess what I have this amazing thing for you wouldn't you
[01:40:07] Allison Wood Brooks: love to invest in it? Andrew Pustamonte said something to me about this he said he's a spy for
[01:40:13] Stephen Bartlett: the CIA for about 10 years and he said one of the things you you have to train yourself to understand
[01:40:18] Stephen Bartlett: as a spy is that there's a difference between your perspective which is like what I see right now
[01:40:25] Stephen Bartlett: yes in my perspective I see a mirror over there and there's an award and I see some things behind you
[01:40:28] Stephen Bartlett: I see two cameras over your shoulder I see that there's a wooden beam over there behind you by the
[01:40:32] Stephen Bartlett: way and there's like some green tape above there and then there's your perception yes your
[01:40:37] Stephen Bartlett: perception is all this shit like I couldn't see any of this stuff yeah behind me that's right
[01:40:41] Allison Wood Brooks: and he said like as a spy they train you to sit in the other person's perception because if you
[01:40:46] Stephen Bartlett: can't do that you're never going to be able to persuade them like you have to realize that
[01:40:49] Stephen Bartlett: actually you sat in front of me have a different brain and the only I can guess what's in your
[01:40:54] Allison Wood Brooks: brain I can guess maybe there's a mirror behind me maybe there's art maybe there's just a wall
[01:41:00] Allison Wood Brooks: I can guess based on what I see based on what I've experienced we're in a room so I'm going to
[01:41:05] Allison Wood Brooks: guess there's some sort of wall behind me and not out into the street but we're really bad at guessing
[01:41:11] Allison Wood Brooks: tons of psychological research suggests that human beings are terrible at using our own experiences
[01:41:16] Allison Wood Brooks: to guess other people's perceptual realities guess your perspective so instead of guessing I need
[01:41:23] Allison Wood Brooks: to ask you hey Steven what do you see behind me I need to ask you directly how does that make you
[01:41:30] Allison Wood Brooks: feel why do you think it was built that way what do you feel when you're sitting here why do you
[01:41:33] Allison Wood Brooks: think it's asymmetrical why do I see books but you don't the only way to truly understand
[01:41:38] Allison Wood Brooks: another person's mind is to ask them and to talk about it I asked my sister so if you define
[01:41:44] Stephen Bartlett: your reliable security system for a new place in LA what she discovered is that most available
[01:41:48] Stephen Bartlett: options have the same issue they're reactive and only take action after someone is broken into your
[01:41:54] Stephen Bartlett: house simply say if who sponsors this show has a completely different approach if someone's lurking
[01:41:59] Stephen Bartlett: near your home or office their AI powered cameras detect them then human agents who act like a
[01:42:04] Stephen Bartlett: remote security guard take action speaking directly to the intruder letting them know they're
[01:42:09] Stephen Bartlett: being watched on camera and if necessary triggering a siren or spotlight to scare them off or they
[01:42:15] Stephen Bartlett: can call 911 for police dispatch this immediate response is why I went with Simply Safe no one
[01:42:20] Stephen Bartlett: else approaches security in the same way but they have no long-term contracts or hidden fees so
[01:42:25] Stephen Bartlett: you can cancel at any time they also have a 60 day money back guarantee my audience can say 50%
[01:42:31] Stephen Bartlett: on a Simply Safe Home Security System at SimplySafe.com slash DOAC that is SimplySafe.com slash DOAC
[01:42:39] Stephen Bartlett: there's no safe like a Simply Safe you know every once in a while you come across a product that has

[01:43:43] business meeting or I'm trying to persuade someone to I don't know join our company whatever
[01:43:48] Stephen Bartlett: at the beginning of that conversation are there key questions that I should be using to
[01:43:54] Stephen Bartlett: understand their ideology like understand the heroes journey that they they have in their head
[01:44:01] Stephen Bartlett: of them you should ask more and listen to their answers and then ask the next question what kind
[01:44:06] Allison Wood Brooks: of questions a good one that I like to start with is what are you excited about lately okay right
[01:44:11] Allison Wood Brooks: it's very revealing of what there's is top of mind you ask me that question today loved it
[01:44:16] Allison Wood Brooks: it's it also implies that you knew what they were excited about previously so it can help you
[01:44:22] Allison Wood Brooks: kind of revisit that a bit over time whatever there everyone has an answer to that question
[01:44:27] Allison Wood Brooks: even if they're terribly depressed they're excited about something maybe the prospect of making a
[01:44:32] Allison Wood Brooks: friend and anything that someone is excited about means you can stay on that topic and ask more
[01:44:38] Allison Wood Brooks: oh well what could I do to help you do that right like we we can just carry carry on down that path
[01:44:45] Allison Wood Brooks: when I asked you that question three hours ago you said two things you said about putting
[01:44:49] Stephen Bartlett: curriculum the script clip into schools but you also talked about men and their conversations
[01:44:54] Stephen Bartlett: yeah you've done a study recently yeah about men this is me remembering what you call back loving
[01:45:00] Stephen Bartlett: it loving it thank you for that but men in their conversations you said you've done an
[01:45:04] Stephen Bartlett: interesting study recently which can't go into the details about but it was revealing about male
[01:45:08] Stephen Bartlett: friendship yes our men bad at communication if so why are we bad at communication conversation's hard
[01:45:14] Allison Wood Brooks: when you look under the hood it looks more like a train wreck you're being diplomatic then I will
[01:45:19] Stephen Bartlett: be ugly less diplomatic in a moment um looks more like a train wreck than a sort of tidy script that
[01:45:24] Allison Wood Brooks: you would see on a TV show it's messy we make mistakes we have to repair it we need to check our
[01:45:31] Allison Wood Brooks: understanding we need to make apologies constantly so perfection is not the goal for anyone
[01:45:37] in conversation when you look at gender differences there are real gender differences um we know that
[01:45:44] Allison Wood Brooks: in friendship women tend to actually face each other and talk to each other men tend to do activities
[01:45:49] Allison Wood Brooks: right shoulder to shoulder we're fishing we're playing basketball we're in fantasy sports on our
[01:45:54] Allison Wood Brooks: computers this project that I did recently I always spend lots of time analyzing transcripts at
[01:46:01] Allison Wood Brooks: very large scale this project though I was observing conversations live and for whatever reason
[01:46:07] Allison Wood Brooks: that was much more visceral than what I usually do as a scientist and it was all men meeting other
[01:46:13] Allison Wood Brooks: men for the first time and sort of trying to forge friendships and what was so hard to watch
[01:46:20] is that they don't they've really struggled with vulnerability vulnerability is such a key
[01:46:26] Allison Wood Brooks: component of friendship when friendship experts say you need consistency so interacting
[01:46:33] repeatedly positivity having fun together but maybe most importantly vulnerability like sharing
[01:46:39] Allison Wood Brooks: not only your feelings with each other but like what are you struggling with what are you
[01:46:43] Allison Wood Brooks: what are your hopes and dreams what are your goals what do you want to get out of this it was so
[01:46:47] Allison Wood Brooks: maddening to watch these men have hundreds of conversations and like none of them ask those questions
[01:46:56] Allison Wood Brooks: or talked about those things with each other as a woman it was it was almost shocking because it's
[01:47:02] Allison Wood Brooks: sort of like what women would probably talk about within the first three minutes of the conversation
[01:47:08] Allison Wood Brooks: and I couldn't believe I was like wow this is really this really seems like a massive difference
[01:47:13] Allison Wood Brooks: and I worry that large scale the leap from being basketball buddies or fantasy sports buddies
[01:47:22] Allison Wood Brooks: into vulnerable conversation feels so scary and risky that men are unable to make the leap
[01:47:30] Allison Wood Brooks: and that's a huge part of what's holding back men from having meaningful friendships
[01:47:36] Allison Wood Brooks: and we know that loneliness is so much worse for men than for women and they have way less friends
[01:47:41] Stephen Bartlett: yes yes a ridiculous proportion of men say report having zero close friends 40 percent potentially
[01:47:51] wow it's quite troubling and I think that I think the conversation skills and courage
[01:47:59] listen everything that we've talked about choosing good topics shifting to new topics when they
[01:48:03] Allison Wood Brooks: get boring asking good questions asking follow up questions finding moments of levity um apologizing
[01:48:10] Allison Wood Brooks: listening all of these things take a surprising amount of courage and confidence and it feels like
[01:48:17] Allison Wood Brooks: this thing for men who have been socialized to believe that vulnerability is a sign of weakness
[01:48:22] Allison Wood Brooks: it feels like it it's like almost takes too much courage for them to make that leap in their
[01:48:28] Allison Wood Brooks: relationships and it's quite problematic men are 400 percent more likely to say they have no
[01:48:34] Stephen Bartlett: one to turn to in a ton of crisis um half of the men say they are unsatisfied with their friendships
[01:48:40] Stephen Bartlett: men's number of close friends has dropped by 30 to 40 percent since 1990 men come to rely on their
[01:48:48] Allison Wood Brooks: in heterosexual relationships come to rely on their partner for emotional fulfillment and support
[01:48:54] women do not so when you know woman this female spouse dies men have to remarry to fill that void
[01:49:00] Allison Wood Brooks: they don't have that friendship when a husband dies the woman has her friends to support her
[01:49:08] Allison Wood Brooks: so how can we how can I make more friends as a man I think it's really one conversation at a time
[01:49:14] Allison Wood Brooks: the power you have is as an individual is signaling to other men hey let's take this courage
[01:49:19] Allison Wood Brooks: asleep like here's a question you can ask what have you been struggling with recently
[01:49:25] what do you hope to achieve but what have you but what kind of thing have you been thinking about
[01:49:29] Allison Wood Brooks: that you haven't shared with anyone before and in the study you did what kind give me a flavor of
[01:49:34] Stephen Bartlett: how the conversation sounded hey man you want to get oh this this hot dog is gross yeah it's really
[01:49:40] gross yeah this is yeah I don't like the food I'm gonna go take a nap it's like narrating what's
[01:49:52] Allison Wood Brooks: happening around you sometimes they'd be like where are you from or then that would turn into
[01:50:00] Stephen Bartlett: a narration yeah I love Chicago has the team I hate the Chicago Bears oh yeah remember when so
[01:50:09] Allison Wood Brooks: and so played there then you've devolved into the sports talk which can be important but you can
[01:50:14] Allison Wood Brooks: you move a step beyond and be like did you ever feel vulnerable when you played football in high
[01:50:20] Allison Wood Brooks: school right like or like what did you struggle with in terms of sports why didn't you play college
[01:50:26] Allison Wood Brooks: sports I whatever it wherever the whatever the topic is you can take that next step to make it
[01:50:31] Allison Wood Brooks: actually personal and vulnerable and interesting so that you walk away one step closer to having
[01:50:39] Allison Wood Brooks: an actual friend and not just someone you say things you know too I did a talk in Canary War for
[01:50:47] Stephen Bartlett: a couple of weeks couple of mmm maybe a year ago and a kid stood up in the front row you got a
[01:50:52] Stephen Bartlett: bear mind there's 500 young I say younger me probably 21 they're all working in this part of
[01:50:57] Stephen Bartlett: clinical canary wolf where you kind of your first job after university 500 people in this room
[01:51:02] Stephen Bartlett: kids stands up front row says hi my question is I want to know how to make friends and it was
[01:51:11] Stephen Bartlett: shocking to me because I could see 499 of his peers did next to him but he had the guts to stand
[01:51:16] Stephen Bartlett: up in front of all these people and say hi Stephen my question is how do you make friends it's a fabulous
[01:51:21] Allison Wood Brooks: question isn't it if he'd asked you that question he might be listening now hello friend
[01:51:28] starts with hello and the number of times that I have run at conversation exercises as part of my
[01:51:35] Allison Wood Brooks: class and the students at the end of that very first session say this is the first time I've turned
[01:51:40] Allison Wood Brooks: to the person next to me and actually talked to them it's like every time I do that first session
[01:51:45] Allison Wood Brooks: thank you thank you for the opportunity to turn the reason giving us a reason to turn to each other
[01:51:50] Allison Wood Brooks: and actually talk get to know my classmates even that takes tremendous courage especially if
[01:51:57] Allison Wood Brooks: there are norms of not doing of coming in sitting down at a desk or in an auditorium and being on
[01:52:02] Allison Wood Brooks: your phone so literally turning to someone next to you and saying like hey I'm Allison what's your name
[01:52:07] Allison Wood Brooks: Mary from starting right god we don't do that in the UK it's a creepy behavior it's okay and that's
[01:52:12] Stephen Bartlett: you do need to read the room right like it may be not appropriate in all situations it can be
[01:52:17] Allison Wood Brooks: shame it depends on the norms once you are engaged with people it's all of the talk things what
[01:52:23] Allison Wood Brooks: topics will they actually find helpful to them are you asking questions are you listening and asking
[01:52:28] Allison Wood Brooks: follow-up questions are you moving beyond just trading things you know are you learning about
[01:52:36] Allison Wood Brooks: each other in a way that feels revealing that's where real relationships come from what is some
[01:52:43] what are these here yeah let's find out this list of questions here oh this is an exercise that I do
[01:52:50] Allison Wood Brooks: this is based on a very well-known exercise called 36 questions to fall in love oh I heard about that
[01:52:54] yeah or three it was phase in the New York Times many years ago it's based on some academic research
[01:52:59] Allison Wood Brooks: this is 10 a subset of 10 of those 36 questions and exercise I do in my class called 10 questions
[01:53:06] Allison Wood Brooks: to fall in like instead of love so if I have some of those 10 questions they're gonna like me
[01:53:11] probably yeah more than if you didn't ask the questions um what you want to do is you
[01:53:17] Allison Wood Brooks: actually go back and forth and ask each other these questions so the first one is what are you excited
[01:53:22] Allison Wood Brooks: about lately next is what is something you're good at but don't like doing what's something you're
[01:53:26] Allison Wood Brooks: bad at but love to do is there's something you'd like to learn more about is there something you'd
[01:53:30] Allison Wood Brooks: like to learn how to do what can we celebrate about you has someone made you laugh recently what
[01:53:35] something cute your kid friend Pat or partner has been doing did you grow up in a city and have
[01:53:40] Allison Wood Brooks: you fall in in love with any new music books movies shows lately it's just 10 questions that are
[01:53:45] Allison Wood Brooks: of this flavor that many people but I suspect lots of men don't ask that are a great starting point
[01:53:54] Allison Wood Brooks: it's just the first turn right you have to actually listen to what the person says and ask follow-up
[01:53:59] Allison Wood Brooks: questions to really deepen the conversation and move up that topic pyramid but these are good
[01:54:05] Allison Wood Brooks: questions you could prep just one or two of them you could carry two of them in your back pocket
[01:54:10] Allison Wood Brooks: all the time as go to topics for people so when this opportunity arises you could ask them I like
[01:54:18] the one what are you excited about lately that's my go-to with a lot of people also like have you
[01:54:23] Allison Wood Brooks: are you obsessed with any shows right now it's pretty a pretty good one too but the key is not
[01:54:28] Allison Wood Brooks: just asking that question but actually asking follow-up questions about like why do you connect with
[01:54:32] Allison Wood Brooks: that show what do you see in the main character do you see anything from the main character that
[01:54:36] Allison Wood Brooks: you see in yourself you know you got to get more got to get deeper into it the original research
[01:54:42] Allison Wood Brooks: with the 36 questions to fall in love suggest that going through these 36 questions makes you
[01:54:48] Allison Wood Brooks: like each other a lot and certainly these 10 questions would help you start if you need the excuse
[01:54:55] Allison Wood Brooks: I would love for your listeners to blame me if you're feeling if they feel nervous to ask questions
[01:55:01] Allison Wood Brooks: especially boys or men say like I saw this crazy lady on diary with the EO and she said I should
[01:55:08] Allison Wood Brooks: try asking this question so I'm going to try I might even my students at Harvard find that
[01:55:13] Allison Wood Brooks: quite helpful to have a scapegoat to point at me and say my professor made me do this
[01:55:19] but doesn't matter who makes you do it whether it's yourself or someone else the fact is that
[01:55:24] Allison Wood Brooks: you're doing it and they're going to answer this question and then you can ask a follow-up and it's
[01:55:29] Allison Wood Brooks: the beginning of a friendship I did that when I was younger to a girl I was interested in I'd
[01:55:36] Stephen Bartlett: seen that Ted talk about the 36 questions whatever and I said to her over text messages like I want
[01:55:41] Stephen Bartlett: to play a game with you something that I've just watched you get are you willing to play it with
[01:55:45] Stephen Bartlett: me she said yes I asked these 36 questions and at the end of it I told her about the research
[01:55:50] Stephen Bartlett: and whatever in a non-creepy way you're a real dork yeah but like but it did it did exactly that
[01:55:56] Stephen Bartlett: it taught me that vulnerability is the doorway to connection that's right it's the doorway to
[01:56:00] Allison Wood Brooks: connection it's what makes relationships real without it you don't have real friendship right it's
[01:56:06] Allison Wood Brooks: again it's consistency of interaction positivity so you can't be plagued by negativity and fighting
[01:56:12] Allison Wood Brooks: and anger but positive be fun being relaxed around each other having positive experiences
[01:56:18] Allison Wood Brooks: but then vulnerability you have to learn these things about each other so that you feel known to
[01:56:24] Allison Wood Brooks: each other and feel like they're uniquely sharing stuff with you what about persuasion have you
[01:56:33] Stephen Bartlett: got any any useful actionable advice for me on how to be a better salesperson and when I say
[01:56:40] Stephen Bartlett: salesperson I don't mean I'm trying to sell someone a car I mean trying to convince other people
[01:56:43] Stephen Bartlett: of my ideas so that I what I do talks in companies oftentimes someone will stand up and say I'm
[01:56:49] Stephen Bartlett: trying to persuade my boss to do X innovative thing they won't listen to me how you got any tips
[01:56:54] Stephen Bartlett: for me to persuade them but also persuasion is at all levels right up down left right in
[01:56:59] Stephen Bartlett: organizations and in the world we are persuaded by people we trust and like and admire right it's
[01:57:06] Allison Wood Brooks: people we interact with and over time we bend to their view or we are compelled by what they're
[01:57:11] Allison Wood Brooks: sharing with us because we know that they are smart and trustworthy and we like them persuasion
[01:57:16] Allison Wood Brooks: doesn't often happen within the bounds of one conversation it could if you are asking lots of
[01:57:24] Allison Wood Brooks: questions and able to sort of sit on the same side of a table together and say hey let's learn
[01:57:29] Allison Wood Brooks: as much as we can about this complicated tangle of yarn whatever that topic is let's see if we
[01:57:34] Allison Wood Brooks: can pull threads together and figure this out we were talking earlier about receptiveness to
[01:57:38] Allison Wood Brooks: opposing viewpoints ironically if you push yourself to learn as much as you can about the other person
[01:57:46] Allison Wood Brooks: and validate their views however you view those views over the longer term you are more likely to
[01:57:55] Allison Wood Brooks: be persuasive because they're willing to stay engaged with you and listen to what you have to
[01:57:59] Allison Wood Brooks: say in return because they feel heard and understood yeah and they trust that you're not a jerk and
[01:58:05] Allison Wood Brooks: that you're reasonable and that you're open even to their crazy viewpoints I have learned that actually
[01:58:10] Stephen Bartlett: in my relationships that if I make the other person feel heard and understood they validate you
[01:58:15] Stephen Bartlett: validate yes a good word validate it's and validation is not equivalent to agreement you can validate
[01:58:22] Allison Wood Brooks: validate validate validate validate validate and then go on to vehemently disagree yeah and probably
[01:58:27] Allison Wood Brooks: that disagreement is going to go a lot better after you validated them quite a bit like the mistakes
[01:58:34] Stephen Bartlett: I made in maybe past relationships where when I didn't validate it was kind of like a broken record
[01:58:38] Stephen Bartlett: the person continued to make the same point because they didn't feel heard and understood that's
[01:58:42] Stephen Bartlett: right but if I validate remarkable thing happens where they the kind of record player stops and then
[01:58:47] Stephen Bartlett: you can make your case it's like a magic trick there's really beautiful research recently that people
[01:58:54] Allison Wood Brooks: can flate agreement with listening I only think you're listening when you're agreeing with me and then
[01:59:03] Allison Wood Brooks: and when you disagree with me I feel like you're not hearing me you're not listening because obviously
[01:59:08] Allison Wood Brooks: what I'm saying is so sensical and so compelling that if you're disagreeing with it you're literally
[01:59:13] Allison Wood Brooks: not hearing me agreement and listening are not the same thing but in our minds we get mixed up about
[01:59:20] Allison Wood Brooks: it okay so I should start every sentence with I agree you know if I don't I would I would I think
[01:59:25] Allison Wood Brooks: you should start with tell me more it makes sense that you feel this way and I'd like to understand
[01:59:31] Allison Wood Brooks: how you came to hold this viewpoint I think you should start with validation
[01:59:35] Allison Wood Brooks: before you do anything else yeah Julian treasure what he said to me was that he did two
[01:59:43] Stephen Bartlett: third talks one of them about speaking one of them about listening rough numbers he said the what
[01:59:47] Stephen Bartlett: about speaking did 40 million views the one about listening did like a fraction of that yeah
[01:59:54] Stephen Bartlett: it listening is a it's a weird concept to codify and most people don't realize that it's a
[02:00:00] Allison Wood Brooks: very very high level skill it's interesting it's to why they don't think it's important I think
[02:00:06] Stephen Bartlett: we think of things active things that's right and speaking in particular public speaking is very
[02:00:12] Allison Wood Brooks: nerve-wracking it's like an activity that makes people incredibly nervous so any little thing that
[02:00:18] Allison Wood Brooks: you could toss my way that might reduce even a sliver of that anxiety and make me better at it
[02:00:23] Allison Wood Brooks: people are so hungry for it's it's sort of like more obvious yeah right it's more salient it's more
[02:00:28] Allison Wood Brooks: active like you're saying listening is easy to say nothing literally oh listen people think
[02:00:32] Allison Wood Brooks: that listening is like oh just sit there yeah when in fact it's incredibly effortful it's incredibly
[02:00:37] Allison Wood Brooks: hard because our minds are built to wander right our minds are wandering at least a 25% of the time
[02:00:42] Allison Wood Brooks: probably a lot more than that and people who are good at it when we think of people who are
[02:00:46] Allison Wood Brooks: charismatic likeable smart savvy it's not because of what they're saying it's because of how they're
[02:00:54] Allison Wood Brooks: listening and reacting to what they've heard Mike Baker who's another spy who's a spy for 20 years
[02:01:01] Stephen Bartlett: I think with his CIA in America said to me that much of the job of being a spy and persuading and
[02:01:06] Stephen Bartlett: manipulating a target in a foreign land to give over secrets he said to me that he would for example
[02:01:12] Stephen Bartlett: let's just say it was in Afghanistan he had land in Afghanistan he would find the taxi driver that
[02:01:18] Stephen Bartlett: was driving the government official who he wanted secrets from and he said to me he might spend
[02:01:23] Stephen Bartlett: seven weeks in that taxi doing nothing but listening to this guy yes listening to the taxi driver
[02:01:29] Stephen Bartlett: yes because he said most people in their life have not had someone listen to them uninterrupted for
[02:01:34] Stephen Bartlett: like 10 minutes and when you listen to someone they will offload about themselves especially if you
[02:01:39] Allison Wood Brooks: ask for a lot of questions exactly so and he and he I was like so what are you doing when you're
[02:01:43] Stephen Bartlett: listening he was just asking them and just you know asking a follow-up question and they would take
[02:01:47] Stephen Bartlett: me down the path they wanted to take me and by week seven of the eight weeks I would understand
[02:01:53] Stephen Bartlett: what motivates them it's right and I would have heard in week seven that their son has a knee injury
[02:01:58] Stephen Bartlett: and they're very worried about their son's health and then in week eight when I got in the taxi
[02:02:02] Stephen Bartlett: I'd make a proposition to them I'd say I know your son has a bad knee we can take care of him
[02:02:07] Stephen Bartlett: this is exactly the same thing that I was saying about entrepreneurs right you can you got to have
[02:02:12] Allison Wood Brooks: a relationship ask questions questions questions questions questions before you finally get to
[02:02:16] Allison Wood Brooks: the thing where you're like I have a proposition for you yeah right two things about listening first
[02:02:23] Allison Wood Brooks: I'm not surprised to hear that a taxi driver is a very simple relationship they're serving one very
[02:02:29] Allison Wood Brooks: clear purpose in that person's life interacting with someone like a romantic partner or a work colleague
[02:02:35] Allison Wood Brooks: they what we it's called multiplexity they're serving many more roles your girlfriend is
[02:02:41] liver friend co-chef you keep a home together you're coordinating domestic domestic tasks so she's
[02:02:49] Allison Wood Brooks: serving all of these purposes that's much more complicated to sort through and there will be conflicts
[02:02:54] Allison Wood Brooks: of interest between those roles that she plays in your life a way that you would talk to the future
[02:02:58] Allison Wood Brooks: mother of your children is quite different than how you would talk to your chef and yet she is
[02:03:04] Allison Wood Brooks: both of those things to you right so a taxi driver is easier to talk to in a way because it's
[02:03:09] Allison Wood Brooks: simpler okay that's one thing the next thing is about listening as a skill like this by
[02:03:15] Allison Wood Brooks: is saying I'm not surprised to hear that he's asking follow-up questions often people think of
[02:03:20] Allison Wood Brooks: listening as something that happens silently you're just sitting there absorbing and that is part
[02:03:25] Allison Wood Brooks: of it but listening is actually three parts the first is perception I'm seeing you I'm observing
[02:03:31] Allison Wood Brooks: everything that's happening about you during our conversation and everything in your environment
[02:03:36] Allison Wood Brooks: there and then there's auditory cues I'm hearing your voice I'm hearing these acoustic things like
[02:03:41] Allison Wood Brooks: mm-hmm yeah and the tone of your voice and how quickly you speak so we take in all this stuff
[02:03:49] then we process some of it we elaborate on some of the things that you've said and I think more deeply
[02:03:54] Allison Wood Brooks: I can't process all of it because it's a lot of information what's so unique about conversation is
[02:04:01] Allison Wood Brooks: there's a third step where I can reflect back to you what I've heard I can say well that's so
[02:04:08] Allison Wood Brooks: interesting that you met this guy who was a spy who wrote in the taxi can you tell me more about
[02:04:13] Allison Wood Brooks: that I've now indicated to you that I was listening that I'm curious that I want to know more so
[02:04:19] our instincts are to think about nonverbal cues like smiling and nodding quietly leaning forward
[02:04:26] advanced listening people who really develop the skill of listening actually use their words to
[02:04:32] Allison Wood Brooks: show people that they've heard them by validating affirming asking follow-up questions in a group you
[02:04:38] Allison Wood Brooks: can paraphrase and say like oh Steven Steven said this Kasi said this then he said this I think
[02:04:44] Allison Wood Brooks: together what we're really talking about is status you know that nodding in that mm-hmm stuff is
[02:04:50] Stephen Bartlett: that good or bad it's useful that's what we think of as active listening which has been studied
[02:04:54] Allison Wood Brooks: for decades it doesn't indicate that someone is here and you at all they could be thinking about
[02:04:58] Allison Wood Brooks: their grocery lists and smiling and nodding at the same time it is useful though to convince your
[02:05:04] Allison Wood Brooks: partner that you're listening to them and that matters even if it's not connected to what you're
[02:05:09] Allison Wood Brooks: thinking about at all if you were to not smile and nod the omission of it would be jarring so in that
[02:05:16] Allison Wood Brooks: sense it's like normative you have to do it it's sort of like listening 101 but listening
[02:05:21] Allison Wood Brooks: to a one three oh one is using these verbal cues to show someone you've heard them
[02:05:26] you understood the objective when we sat down I want to become the best talker conversation list
[02:05:32] Stephen Bartlett: the most persuasive most like personal that that was the objective that I gave you the brief
[02:05:37] is there anything that we haven't talked about that we should have talked about we haven't
[02:05:42] Stephen Bartlett: talked about silence wrote a chapter about silence that I dropped because I think it's an
[02:05:47] Allison Wood Brooks: entirely separate book it's kind of ironic that this book is called talk because we do so much
[02:05:53] Allison Wood Brooks: communicating between the lines there's so much information exchanged in just a shared glance
[02:05:59] Allison Wood Brooks: when people don't know each other well long pauses are a sign that the conversation's not going well
[02:06:05] Allison Wood Brooks: so if you're on a first date and you feel like the conversation is dying and you're in have the
[02:06:09] Allison Wood Brooks: panicky feeling of what do we talk about next that's legit you should not let that happen you should
[02:06:14] Allison Wood Brooks: go in with topics prepped and not let there or this list of lovely questions and ask those questions
[02:06:21] later in a relationship after you've known someone a long time longer pauses are a sign that
[02:06:26] Allison Wood Brooks: you're comfortable with each other that you could sit in total silence and companionable silence
[02:06:31] Allison Wood Brooks: and that it's comfortable and nice so it means different things as relationships evolve there's
[02:06:38] Allison Wood Brooks: so much we can do in our conversations that are not about the words we say to each other to
[02:06:47] there's another chapter I dropped do you want to hear about it Stephen of course I want to hear
[02:06:50] about it it's about talking in the digital age so this is this is what I was going to ask you about
[02:06:55] Stephen Bartlett: as well is now we have large language models which are writing lots of AI slop for us yes and if
[02:07:01] Stephen Bartlett: you log into social media even email slack channel sometimes in WhatsApp I look at the messages that
[02:07:09] Stephen Bartlett: I'll take a responsibility as well sometimes that I'm sending sometimes that I'm receiving and because
[02:07:14] Stephen Bartlett: of AI
[02:07:20] they're getting increasingly less soulful when I scroll certain social media platforms which I
[02:07:27] Stephen Bartlett: shout name I feel disconnected from people now yes because my comments are all like AI slop stuff
[02:07:38] Stephen Bartlett: yeah with the big M-dash and oh my god this is so amazing Stephen and you know that no human rights
[02:07:43] Stephen Bartlett: like that yeah in a digital age in an AI world do we need to start communicating differently
[02:07:50] so that people
[02:07:51] Stephen Bartlett: do you know I've started doing intentional spelling mistakes I love that if you go on my LinkedIn
[02:07:58] Stephen Bartlett: you'll notice that I have totally disregarded grammar okay let me start by telling you about an
[02:08:04] Allison Wood Brooks: exercise that I do in my class I think it'll be thought provoking for you so your question is about
[02:08:09] Allison Wood Brooks: the content of what we type to each other it's a text-based communication whether it's on social media
[02:08:16] Allison Wood Brooks: or over text or over email and there are clear things that we should do to make our text-based
[02:08:23] Allison Wood Brooks: communication better mostly make it shorter emails shorter use headings use bullet points get
[02:08:30] Allison Wood Brooks: to the point think about what other people need only give them that okay but I think more broadly
[02:08:37] what is quite thought provoking is to think about how your life proceeds these days your conversational
[02:08:42] Allison Wood Brooks: life unfolds so in my class I ask my students to do a communication audit of like 20 to 30 minutes
[02:08:47] Allison Wood Brooks: in their life where you transcribe every incoming and outgoing message across all digital and face-to-face
[02:08:57] Allison Wood Brooks: modalities so your DMs your emails your texts your phone calls your zoom calls your face-to-face
[02:09:04] Allison Wood Brooks: interactions all of it can you imagine no it's quite hard yeah it's the sort of top-line thing you
[02:09:14] Allison Wood Brooks: notice is that it's so much it's just a crazy amount of communication that's happening in our
[02:09:22] Allison Wood Brooks: lives now when only maybe 20 years ago it was like 10% of what it is now I think we all feel that
[02:09:30] Allison Wood Brooks: sort of overwhelm not only is it a lot it's a we're constantly sort of toggling and adjusting
[02:09:37] Allison Wood Brooks: from one mode of communication to the next so I'm like talking to you while I'm like texting
[02:09:42] Allison Wood Brooks: under the table while I hear my emails going and knowing that my DMs are blowing up
[02:09:47] that mental adjustment is really exhausting and across each of those modes we're like engaging in
[02:09:54] Allison Wood Brooks: different ideas and different threads different topics with different people and so you start to
[02:10:00] Allison Wood Brooks: realize how braided and overlapping all of these things are and it's quite hard to keep it all
[02:10:07] Allison Wood Brooks: straight and to make all of these decisions about like well who does who should I be responding to
[02:10:14] we then default to the people who are right in front of us but any other mode of communication
[02:10:20] Allison Wood Brooks: where like well who should come first who gets my attention first and attention is love right like
[02:10:25] Allison Wood Brooks: who gets my love essentially the thing that my students note about this exercise which is
[02:10:33] Allison Wood Brooks: completely mind-blowing and I would recommend that anybody try it is that only face-to-face conversations
[02:10:39] Allison Wood Brooks: feel real in retrospect and while they're happening yeah now that doesn't mean that the other
[02:10:46] Allison Wood Brooks: ones aren't important of course email is so important for transactional information exchange
[02:10:50] Allison Wood Brooks: but it's not real it's not what the human brain was built to do our brains evolved to do this face-to-face
[02:10:57] Allison Wood Brooks: why I prefer doing it interview like this in person then on Zoom because it's real and we're
[02:11:03] Allison Wood Brooks: gonna have it's so engaging and we're gonna have a real memory of it later and that memory might be
[02:11:09] Allison Wood Brooks: sort of vague you'll be like oh I knew this like you know middle-aged white woman with brown hair
[02:11:14] Allison Wood Brooks: she had a lot of energy right like that might be the extent of what you remember but it's it was
[02:11:19] Allison Wood Brooks: real and we can hold that memory and I think what I find so troubling there's a lot I find troubling
[02:11:27] Allison Wood Brooks: but this our conversational lives have become very unreal and that's why we feel so disconnected and
[02:11:42] Allison Wood Brooks: lonely and that loneliness is just outrageously high we're not having real interactions and real
[02:11:49] Allison Wood Brooks: relationships even even having this device here by the way is it is a portal to another place
[02:11:55] Allison Wood Brooks: so devices replace our conversations because we're on here instead of engaging they also disrupt
[02:12:04] Allison Wood Brooks: it's just so if it's on a table in front of you or you hear it buzzing or dinging in the background
[02:12:09] Allison Wood Brooks: it distracts your attention away from having a real engaged interaction do you have any advice
[02:12:15] Stephen Bartlett: for anybody in a world of AI where it's gonna be really easy to make our communications
[02:12:20] Stephen Bartlett: yeah generatively using chat to be to you or whatever else I I just had just have noticed that what
[02:12:27] Stephen Bartlett: I started what I've started to discount and there's certain there was there's certain team members
[02:12:33] Stephen Bartlett: that I have that have really lent into the use of AI for all of their columns and I noticed myself
[02:12:39] Stephen Bartlett: ignoring them yeah because when they sent me an email report of something that happened in one
[02:12:45] Stephen Bartlett: particular scenario every email report I knew was written by AI so I didn't think it was worth
[02:12:50] Stephen Bartlett: reading because I actually want to hear from them yeah I trust them in their opinion my relationship
[02:12:54] Stephen Bartlett: is to their experience and their knowledge and if I when I realized that it was all just AI
[02:12:59] Stephen Bartlett: because of the formatting of it I start I started ignoring it that three or four weeks goes past and
[02:13:03] Stephen Bartlett: I thought you know I should tell them yeah they should know so I went and told I had a conversation
[02:13:07] Stephen Bartlett: with them I said this is just a perception thing but I've noticed myself now not paying the same
[02:13:11] Stephen Bartlett: attention I used to because I want to know what you think yeah and because it feels like I'm
[02:13:16] Stephen Bartlett: speaking to chat you be to what's there come back to that they were really they were really thankful
[02:13:21] Stephen Bartlett: and they completely changed and it completely immediately even though I now know they're still using
[02:13:25] Stephen Bartlett: it's so crazy because I know they're still using it they've got this bot basically yeah for this
[02:13:29] Stephen Bartlett: particular part of feedback which which they're using all they've done is change the prompt
[02:13:36] Stephen Bartlett: into their bot to make it sound a little bit more human yeah yeah and I'm now reading it again
[02:13:40] Stephen Bartlett: because I can't tell the difference oh my goodness they were really that's so that's what I mean
[02:13:44] Allison Wood Brooks: there's two things going on there one you are invested in people that's what we get invested
[02:13:49] Allison Wood Brooks: in we care about people and relationships as soon as you feel like you're not getting them
[02:13:53] Allison Wood Brooks: and you're getting some weird proxy of them are we're less motivated to engage with it that's
[02:13:58] Allison Wood Brooks: going to be that's totally normal I'll tell you the context it was a it's interview feedback
[02:14:02] Stephen Bartlett: so they're interviewing someone and then the feedback they're sending me is was written by AI yeah
[02:14:08] Stephen Bartlett: I trust their experience and their intuition and their ability just to feel someone I don't know
[02:14:13] Stephen Bartlett: if I trust chat Gbt to view my candidates yeah so I just wanted to feel like I was getting it from
[02:14:20] Stephen Bartlett: that person so there's this relational replacement thing where you're like oh and you just want
[02:14:24] Allison Wood Brooks: to disengage there's this other piece that's sort of more meta which is that llm sort of push us
[02:14:30] Allison Wood Brooks: our communications a reversion to the mean like I'm like it right to the middle so it literally
[02:14:35] is taking at the personality and weirdness and creativity out of it can I tell you I did an
[02:14:41] Allison Wood Brooks: experiment this semester in my class I had my students do office hours with an AI version of me
[02:14:48] okay okay um I'm gonna provide it well the reason I actually think she is better than me in some ways
[02:14:58] Allison Wood Brooks: I want to preface this by saying I think chatbots are most chatbots are deeply problematic but
[02:15:03] Allison Wood Brooks: this one its goal is not to convince users to talk more with her it's to sort of coach them
[02:15:10] on their questions related to conversations so that they can preff and perform better in their
[02:15:14] Allison Wood Brooks: real conversations with humans okay I do think she's better than me in many ways most importantly
[02:15:20] Allison Wood Brooks: she's available she's available all the time whenever they need her and I'm a nightmare to schedule with
[02:15:26] Allison Wood Brooks: uh number two she's not grading them so anytime a student comes to me and has office hours there's
[02:15:31] Allison Wood Brooks: this conflict of interest where they're worried they should be I am grading them yeah like I do care
[02:15:38] Allison Wood Brooks: about the most people and also I am gonna grade them at the end of the semester that's a weird
[02:15:43] Allison Wood Brooks: that makes a relationship quite weird so they don't ask dumb questions and I have to question their
[02:15:48] Allison Wood Brooks: motives because I'm like are you here because you're actually interested in what you're asking me
[02:15:51] Allison Wood Brooks: or because you're trying to impress me and get a better grade right that's a weird context
[02:15:56] Allison Wood Brooks: so she's less judgmental in a way I guess the other thing that she can do is what you were saying
[02:16:01] Allison Wood Brooks: which is after they talk with her and get advice about their conversations she gives them feedback
[02:16:08] Allison Wood Brooks: about how the conversation went she says here are the topics we covered here's how many questions
[02:16:13] Allison Wood Brooks: you asked here were the moments of levity here's how while you were listening and doing kindness
[02:16:18] even if I as a human can think those things I do not have the bandwidth or time to craft the
[02:16:24] Allison Wood Brooks: feedback to the students to 200 students at once so I in short I feel incredibly torn about all
[02:16:34] Allison Wood Brooks: things AI I think there are use cases like this that are really amazing and intriguing and make
[02:16:41] Allison Wood Brooks: things easier and more efficient and as a manager policy maker that's why it's so troubling
[02:16:48] Allison Wood Brooks: because as long as things continue to AI continues to make individuals lives easier
[02:16:54] Allison Wood Brooks: and more convenient I don't know how we can stop and regulate it I think as well that in a world of
[02:17:04] Stephen Bartlett: AI and robots it's going to be very tempting to overlook the most human skills yes and those that
[02:17:12] Stephen Bartlett: don't those that fight against the ease of allowing a chatbot to speak for you will develop a
[02:17:21] Stephen Bartlett: superpower what that's going to be in even more scarce in the future which is all the things you
[02:17:26] Stephen Bartlett: said in this framework yeah like really understanding how to be with a person IRL and have great
[02:17:30] Stephen Bartlett: conversations I think is going to be such a superpower it is talk is the advantage that humans have
[02:17:38] Allison Wood Brooks: over AI it has always been true that conversation is the skill that we that matters most for achieving
[02:17:45] Allison Wood Brooks: everything you want in life but it just seems more obvious now that we need to lean into that even
[02:17:52] Allison Wood Brooks: more the irreplaceably human stuff correct and some of it I don't even know if you're replaceable
[02:18:00] Allison Wood Brooks: as the right word it's like the things that no matter what the future holds for us the things
[02:18:04] Allison Wood Brooks: that are still going to matter I'll put all my chips on a bet when I think about what I need to
[02:18:10] Allison Wood Brooks: be teaching my kids I can imagine worlds where like work is no longer a thing and
[02:18:15] what an innovation is no longer a thing but I cannot imagine a world where
[02:18:20] they're not going to need to connect with other human beings and talk to them well and joyfully
[02:18:25] Allison Wood Brooks: and with respect in real life in real life yeah I think we were talking about boomers early around
[02:18:33] Stephen Bartlett: I think boomers are much better conversation lists than genziers and because they have more reps
[02:18:40] Allison Wood Brooks: they have more repetitions and they grip in the real world when they were forced to develop the skills
[02:18:44] Stephen Bartlett: that's right it's part of the reason that I think we see a lot of sort of like misunderstanding
[02:18:48] Allison Wood Brooks: and judgment between the generations is that right now the people who are alive
[02:18:53] Allison Wood Brooks: have experienced very very different realities and the skills that you do have developed in those
[02:18:59] Allison Wood Brooks: different realities are quite different and it means that we actually are more different from
[02:19:06] Allison Wood Brooks: each other across the generations and on the front of your book talk it says the science of
[02:19:11] Stephen Bartlett: conversation and the art of being ourselves do you think we should shut to work as our authentic
[02:19:18] Stephen Bartlett: selves there's a great freight what a great question um there's a great phrase by a scholar named
[02:19:24] Allison Wood Brooks: Juliana Pillamer who's at NYU um called strategic authenticity okay if you were to bring your
[02:19:33] Allison Wood Brooks: full self to work it would be a nightmare for you and everyone around you
[02:19:42] Allison Wood Brooks: tell me about it at the beginning of my class I have people do this thing that's like okay identify
[02:19:47] Allison Wood Brooks: your tight your conversation types and there's like 13 good types and 13 bad types
[02:19:54] you know there's like the asker and the curious cat and the cheddar box and whatever
[02:19:58] Allison Wood Brooks: the whole thing is a straw man because we're all all of those things we all have habits that are good
[02:20:06] Allison Wood Brooks: sometimes and habits that are bad sometimes and our behavior shifts radically from one situation
[02:20:13] Allison Wood Brooks: to the next I'm not going to behave the same way at a bachelorette party in Vegas as I do when I'm
[02:20:18] Allison Wood Brooks: doing bath time with my children if you did it would be insane and it wouldn't serve anybody's goals
[02:20:25] Allison Wood Brooks: what happens in Vegas that's not being wigs apparently and chippendale dancers um yeah um
[02:20:34] the point is that our behavior shifts from one conversation to the next even from one moment to the
[02:20:40] Allison Wood Brooks: next in every conversation and it should that's what it means to read the room and read the context
[02:20:47] Allison Wood Brooks: in a gym my at my husband has a saying athletes adjust and it's exactly right good conversationalists
[02:20:52] Allison Wood Brooks: adjust so if you in your mind are like this is who I am and I'm going to bring that whole self
[02:20:58] Allison Wood Brooks: to every space that I inhabit it's not going to go well strategic authenticity yeah bring bring
[02:21:06] Allison Wood Brooks: the things that make the values that make you you bring them to work it's the things that you
[02:21:12] care about and are uncompromising about but you can adjust your behavior to to fit the needs of
[02:21:18] Allison Wood Brooks: the situation do you pretend and act no this is a great question I we like to debate this in my class
[02:21:24] Allison Wood Brooks: about um authenticity manipulation what is real what's sincere I guess sincerity might be the right
[02:21:33] Allison Wood Brooks: word to use let's use question asking it as an example imagine that we get to a point in
[02:21:39] Allison Wood Brooks: in in the interview where you're like oh I think I need to ask a question right now you might not
[02:21:44] Allison Wood Brooks: be dying to hear the answer to it but you know as a good interviewer that you need to ask that
[02:21:48] Allison Wood Brooks: question in that moment that doesn't mean that you are evil unkind insincere manipulative it means
[02:21:58] Allison Wood Brooks: that you're trying to live up to the goal of the conversation and trying to live up to the goal of
[02:22:03] Allison Wood Brooks: hey we're going to learn as much as we can from each other I want to show you respect and interest in
[02:22:07] Allison Wood Brooks: your perspective I want to have a good conversation that itself lives up to who you are like that's
[02:22:14] Allison Wood Brooks: the whole point of being here you know what I mean yeah of course yeah so these pleading moments of
[02:22:20] Allison Wood Brooks: like insincereity it I think people over focus on that as a signal of inauthenticity okay fine if
[02:22:27] Stephen Bartlett: it's tied to an more overarching goal of like I want to be a good human being in a good conversationalist
[02:22:33] Allison Wood Brooks: often because I want to serve the needs of others so you can be slightly insincere
[02:22:40] Stephen Bartlett: in the pursuit of sincerity and those those moments of insincereity are gone in an instant as
[02:22:48] Allison Wood Brooks: soon as I ask this question that maybe I'm not dying to hear how is your weekend you're going to
[02:22:53] Allison Wood Brooks: give me an answer and I'm sincerely going to search for something in there that I am interested in
[02:22:58] Allison Wood Brooks: and I'm going to ask a follow-up question and make it better okay so when I met you you did ask
[02:23:02] Stephen Bartlett: me how how I was doing was that I the question I've been dying to ask you is about children
[02:23:08] me and my girlfriend are trying so hopefully I'm so excited for you how excited about I just think
[02:23:15] Stephen Bartlett: it's one of the most miraculous things that you can experience as a human being and I'm hopeful for
[02:23:20] Allison Wood Brooks: you yeah good luck yeah I hope you get to experience it it's a very it's a very different experience
[02:23:30] Allison Wood Brooks: to add to your resume I know I think that's why I'm excited by it because it is the great unknown
[02:23:36] Stephen Bartlett: and in some respects in my head this might be the wrong framing but it feels like the great sacrifice
[02:23:40] Stephen Bartlett: yeah it's both and you know what I always say it's like the most self center self-interested and
[02:23:46] Allison Wood Brooks: least self-interested thing you can do self-interested in this you're like making a copy of yourself
[02:23:52] Allison Wood Brooks: okay like talk about narcissism but it's just incredible it really life is no longer about you
[02:23:58] Allison Wood Brooks: that's terrifying to hear it is terrifying to hear objectively like I understand what you're saying
[02:24:03] Stephen Bartlett: and I and I agree but it's also as a statement for anybody to know that they're kind of giving up
[02:24:10] your current self sense of self for someone else you've never met oh you're giving it up not
[02:24:16] Allison Wood Brooks: you're giving giving up might not be the right phrase you're changing you're evolving into a
[02:24:21] Allison Wood Brooks: different version of you for them the more freedom and like resources you have before kids means
[02:24:28] Allison Wood Brooks: it's you may experience that as a more as a loss but are you also have more to gain it really is it's
[02:24:36] Allison Wood Brooks: um really incredible it's easy to focus on like fertility and having children and to ask
[02:24:42] Allison Wood Brooks: probing crying questions about you know how many do you want and whatever but I I think it's easy
[02:24:47] Allison Wood Brooks: to focus on like the birth process and and overlook how long childhood is it's 18 years and I think
[02:24:54] Allison Wood Brooks: the major project of it is helping kids learn to talk to other people and how do you do that I'm
[02:25:02] Stephen Bartlett: sure there's a parent screaming right now like how do I how do I set my kid up so that they can talk
[02:25:06] Stephen Bartlett: well yeah I think it's what you were doing every moment of every day you're interacting with them
[02:25:12] Allison Wood Brooks: directly and sort of role modeling what you think that looks like helping them through difficult
[02:25:17] Allison Wood Brooks: moments helping them both fail and succeed it's very important um and we're hoping to adapt the
[02:25:23] Allison Wood Brooks: talk course for high schoolers and younger children quite soon do I need to get them off youtube and
[02:25:28] Stephen Bartlett: all that stuff and yes and screens yes it's a little bit of youtube okay a little bit of anything
[02:25:37] Allison Wood Brooks: might be okay digital stuff is hard though because they you give them an inch they take a mile
[02:25:42] Allison Wood Brooks: and it becomes habitual so what you do with your kids it's a constant um evolution and learning and
[02:25:49] Allison Wood Brooks: we give them 20 minutes a day yeah on a computer that doesn't move and nothing moves and they can't
[02:25:57] Allison Wood Brooks: carry it with them and what age does that change uh to be determined they know that they're not
[02:26:03] Allison Wood Brooks: getting a phone like a phone phone um now I'm getting more and more extreme I feel like maybe never
[02:26:09] Allison Wood Brooks: but um certainly not until ninth grade and then social media much later than that I mean if
[02:26:17] I it's like it's an interest they will see how it goes but it's uh it's it's just such a slippery
[02:26:22] Allison Wood Brooks: slope but it's so bad for them Jonathan Heitz done a wonderful job angel of my friend Angel of
[02:26:27] Allison Wood Brooks: Duckworth is doing great work Matt Gensko at Stanford um trying to help schools sort this out
[02:26:34] I have that look forward to
[02:26:39] Stephen Bartlett: and listen we have a closing tradition where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest
[02:26:42] Stephen Bartlett: not knowing who that leaving it for and the question left few is if your life was a movie
[02:26:46] Stephen Bartlett: and the audience were watching up to this point what would they be screaming at the screen
[02:26:52] Stephen Bartlett: telling you to do right now what a fabulous question thank you previous guest
[02:27:05] leave Harvard save the children with talk
[02:27:13] devote all of your time and resources to helping every high schooler in the world
[02:27:19] Allison Wood Brooks: learn to do this better why I think it's the ultimate human skill and everyone has the potential
[02:27:28] Allison Wood Brooks: to do it well and it's not a zero-sum game the more people who do it well the better off will all be
[02:27:34] you said save why did you use the word save I think we're in a period where we actually are
[02:27:39] Allison Wood Brooks: needing to save them from digital addiction and loneliness we've gotten to a place that we need
[02:27:47] Allison Wood Brooks: roll back and it's really scary and I think one first step is let's get the devices out of schools
[02:27:57] Allison Wood Brooks: ideally out of families in their hands but then the next step is like what rises to replace it
