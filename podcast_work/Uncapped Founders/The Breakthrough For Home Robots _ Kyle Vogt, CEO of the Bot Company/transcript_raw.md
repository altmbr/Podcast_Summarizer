[00:00:00] You think it's like cooking a steak at some point?
[00:00:02] Yeah, why not?
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_01: If you think about at the end of the day,
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_01: you have pick and place and simple manipulation.
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_01: That's what cooking is.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_01: They're just like a much higher degree of reliability.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_01: And there's other things around food safety and bacteria.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_01: And other things that come in cooking and temperature sensing
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_01: and whatnot like that.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_01: So it's all doable.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_01: It's just like, I would not stop there.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_01: Do you think at some point it's like, hey, robot,
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm at work right now.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_00: There's a steak in the fridge.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: Please cook it and clean up everything.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_00: By the time I'm like 15 years from now,
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: that's got doable.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: Less than five.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: Less than five.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:00:29] All right.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: I'm really pumped to be here with Kyle Vote.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_00: Kyle, thanks a ton for making time for this.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for having me.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: So I want to start with talking about why robotics seems
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: to be having such a moment.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's obviously been really important for a long time.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_00: But in the last few years, it seems like a lot of really
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_00: good entrepreneurs, a lot of good investors
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_00: have started to pour a bunch of time, money, resources,
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: and effort into this.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_00: And I guess I'm curious just to start
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_00: with sort of laying a foundation of like,
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_00: can you put this in some context and like what
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_00: used to be the case and what has changed.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: That's like making people so energized right now?
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_00: It's like the most excited I've ever seen people in robotics.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_01: And you know, I guess as an engineer,
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_01: there's something like romantic about building machines
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_01: to do the stuff that we don't want to do.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_01: And that's why I've been doing this for so long first
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_01: with a decade on self-driving cars.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_01: But for me, even going back to like teenage years
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_01: doing battle bots and then going to MIT
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_01: to basically build more robots.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_01: But you know, during that entire spectrum,
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_01: it's always been this niche thing.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: And frankly, like robots have never really lived up
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_01: to their promise.
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_01: There's always something, there's always overly fragile,
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: like in a factory environment, we put them in cages.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_01: And things don't line up.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: Like within a millimeter, the whole thing doesn't work.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: So it's the battle bots.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: Those were good actually.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_01: Not thinking about it.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_01: Robots were, yeah.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_01: You needed them with like the saws and everything.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: RS had like a hydraulic axe, which was,
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_01: which was pretty cool.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_01: But the Colleen's robots is a bit of a stretch.
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: They're basically glorified RC cars, right?
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, with a weapon.
[00:01:47] Yeah, so with a weapon.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: What's different now is, you know, for the first time,
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_01: you have robots that are powered by,
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_01: essentially they have all the brains of an LLM
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_01: built into this robot.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_01: And we're controlling them with neural networks
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_01: instead of classically engineered algorithms.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_01: And so the difference was, before,
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_01: if you have a robot that's like in a room like this,
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_01: even saying like go to the whiteboard
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: is almost like an impossibly hard computer science problem.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_01: It's like, okay, I have to build an exact 3D map
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_01: of the world, like have a detector
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_01: that can figure out what a whiteboard is,
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_01: train it on millions of examples
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_01: of what whiteboards look like just to be able to do this.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_01: And even then the failure rate would be high
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: if you put it in a different room
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_01: and it just have a map.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_01: But now it's almost like cheating.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_01: You can take all the common sense that's on the internet
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: and inject it into a robot brain.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_01: And so if you're like, where's the whiteboard?
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_01: It knows instantly.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_01: You open the chat GPT, even if you open video,
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: you can like show it anything
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: and it like knows what it is.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and so imagine like robots
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: before started with zero knowledge of the world.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_01: And now like suddenly have this kind of knowledge of the world.
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_01: Like better than us, like they can look around the room
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: and see stuff better than we can.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and then on the motion side,
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: you used to have to have a PhD
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_01: to compute these complex trajectories,
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_01: you have like 12 joints on a motor or on a robot.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_01: How do you get all 12 joints to move
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: and type coordination to like move an arm to a place?
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: And this is a very difficult
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_01: and computationally intensive problem.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_01: And now we just kind of jump over that whole thing.
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_01: And now if you have a way to teleoperate a robot
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_01: or to put it in a simulation,
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_01: you can just learn how to move all those joints
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_01: to mimic the human operator
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: or to accomplish some reward function or to maximize it.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: And so you can skip that whole computational challenge.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_01: And so those two things together basically mean
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_01: that everything we thought we knew about robotics
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_01: or like what kind of businesses were good at businesses
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_01: or bad businesses,
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_01: all like that slate has been wiped clean.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_01: And so I think you're gonna see this canberian explosion
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: of different robots for different applications
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_01: that now suddenly just work.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_01: Whereas before they would like really struggle
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_01: to do the most basic things.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_01: When you say for different applications,
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_00: is that, are you saying it won't be terribly generalized,
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: will it be medium generalized?
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_00: Like what made you say for different applications
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: or like different environments maybe?
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, classically like a lot of robot businesses
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_01: like try to really get really really narrow
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_01: the successful ones.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: We're gonna focus on this one problem.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_01: Like factory automation for three PLs,
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_01: we're putting things in boxes and putting them on a conveyor belt
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_01: like very specific.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_01: And that's just so you can narrow the problem
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_01: enough to be good at it.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_01: Now I think you're gonna see people broaden their horizons
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: a little bit because it's much easier to go from,
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_01: you know, a piece of dumb hardware
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_01: to something that's performing a useful task.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_01: You know, I say multiple applications too
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: because this might be that there's gonna be a whole bunch
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_01: of different shapes and sizes of robots
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_01: each optimized for different types of work.
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_01: You know, as opposed to maybe like a humanoid robot
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_01: which you know, it's very, very expensive
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_01: but interior you could do everything.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_01: I think we're probably gonna see some of those
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_01: but the vast majority of robots will be
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_01: more special purpose in nature.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: In fact, there was a moment in AI
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: where the researchers who were sort of closest to the work
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_00: were like very sure it was gonna work
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_00: before the rest of the world sort of knew
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_00: is there an equivalent thing in robotic?
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_00: Like have people cross to similar threshold
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: to like whatever that was
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_00: at like the pre-Chachypti moment in robotics
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: where like some people who are at the very front
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: have been working on it for decades
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: are like this is definitely happening now.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, if you had like secret microphones
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_01: in like robotics labs across the country right now,
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_01: you just be hearing holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_01: It's like constantly happening
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_01: and I think finally like the light bulb moments are happening
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_01: and it all like in the early days of this stuff
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_01: it all looks very rudimentary and kind of simple
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: but if you know what you're looking at,
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_01: you see the signs of life that mean over the next three
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_01: or five, 10, you know, even less years of development,
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_01: this will go from an interesting technology
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_01: in a research organization to like, you know,
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: broad mainstream appeal.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_01: And yeah, those signs of life are happening,
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_01: those light bulb moments are happening
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: all over the place right now.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_01: So what are the components?
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: Like there's obviously, you know, we talked about
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: like there's like vision, there's like the ability
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: for the robot to do like manipulation the right way
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: for it to have the right sort of dexterity.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: It's gonna be something around like reliability.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: I don't know about like decision making
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: or if that's its own sort of like what are the components
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: basically to like this up level?
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you've touched on a bunch of good ones.
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_01: Depends on the type of robot,
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_01: but the ones we're building like robots
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_01: that operate in your home, they need to navigate through a home,
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_01: they need to remember where things are in the home,
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_01: they need to interact with them and manipulate these objects,
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_01: like you said, and probably have some way of incorporating
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_01: your user preferences into all of this.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_01: And so you've got a reasoning component
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_01: like I see a certain thing in a home,
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_01: plus I know, you know, the preferences you've told me
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_01: in the past about how you like things organized
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_01: or how you run things in your home.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_01: And then I'm gonna take that and reason about
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: what the next steps I should take as a robot.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_01: And then once you have those next steps
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_01: you're gonna take, you know, drive to the,
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_01: of input the towel on it, then go over here.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: Once you have those discrete steps,
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_01: then you can move to more one of these, you know,
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_01: into in models that basically given a simple task
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_01: can go executed.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: My implicit assumption here is that on sometimes scale,
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: you're like extremely confident this will all work.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_00: But like what are you unsure about in the next,
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: let's say like five to 10 years?
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: Or like what will drag?
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: You know, one of the biggest challenges for something
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: like this is the brand new product is like,
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_01: how do I use it?
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_01: Like how does my life change
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_01: and how do I adapt the way I live to best,
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_01: you know, make use of a robot like this?
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_01: And that could be, you know, in a home environment
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_01: or maybe it's like a manufacturing business
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: that, you know, its entire workflow
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_01: is organized around people, standing in work cells,
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_01: doing a task and handing things on to the conveyor belt.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_01: Like how does all this change?
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_01: And so I think that the technology part will come pretty fast
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_01: and I'm pretty confident in that.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_01: The part that I think traditionally takes longer
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_01: is the world has to adapt to basically
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_01: now that this new thing exists.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_01: How does everything about how I run my business
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_01: or how I live in my home
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_01: or how do I operate my hotel or whatever it is
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_01: need to change or should change to best make use of this.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_01: And it's like this is like where like AI software is,
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_00: where like it's obviously much better
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_00: than like what's currently being deployed and used
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_00: at like takes time to get from like the tech is good
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: to now it's like implemented everywhere.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: So you're basically saying it's like the robots will be good
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_00: enough at some point soon,
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: but then figuring out how to use them in daily life
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_00: and like where does it actually fit
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: into like a life workflow, that kind of thing.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and I think the companies building these technologies
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: have a responsibility to help us figure that out.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, they're closest to technology
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_01: and I think they need to think not just about
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_01: like what is technology building do?
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_01: Or you know what's the fancy new thing I built in there?
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_01: But like you know three steps from move from that.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_01: How do businesses actually make use of this?
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_01: And like you know what do they need to know about it?
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_01: And like what things do you need to build in
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: so that it's as easy as possible
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_01: to sort of go on this adoption curve
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: and make it happen?
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_01: Are you more in a mindset of like
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_00: we are Apple and we're gonna like
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: bulls tell you the product kind of
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_00: and like this is how it's gonna work
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_00: and this is what the robot will be
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: or is it more of like the YC?
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: Like let's just get into some homes and iterate.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: Like which mindset do you think you feel closer to?
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_00: Well, frustrating answer, but a little bit of both.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_01: It's one of those things like strong opinions weekly held.
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_01: So I think you have to have an opinion.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_01: You have to have your taste and your preferences built
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_01: into the design of a product or it feels bland.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_01: Like a product with no opinions
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_01: is just like you know you wouldn't even notice it.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_01: So I think you have to start off with strong opinions
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_01: and then be willing to put those in people's hands
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_01: and then quickly abandon them.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_01: If it's not, you know, if it doesn't work
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_01: the way you want to.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_01: I think if you're not stubborn enough
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: you end up with a just product
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_01: no one is interested in.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_01: And if you're too stubborn then you end up
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_01: with a flop in the market once it's out there.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_01: And so you know, I think it's a careful balance.
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_01: Why did you feel compelled to go for the home?
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_00: Like you obviously even with this generalized robot
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_00: sort of idea, there's a lot of things
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: that you could do that aren't just like pack a box
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_00: in a warehouse type of thing
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_00: that's sort of like more dynamic than that.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_00: But like you picked home for some reason.
[00:09:14] Yeah, for some reason.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_01: So I just turned 40.
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_01: This is my third company that I'm working on.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_01: I've got this too.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_01: Big one.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but I bring this up because like at this point
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_01: in my career I kind of know how I want to spend my time
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: and like what's important to me.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_01: And first of all, I want to have a lot of fun
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_01: and working on home robots that I could use
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_01: on my friends can use like couldn't think of anything
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_01: more interesting that are more fun.
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_01: Especially compared to robots that are hidden
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_01: in a factory that no one would ever see.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_01: Totally.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: I think that one of the great promises of working
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_01: on really cool technology is you know,
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_01: you certainly get some dopamine hits
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_01: when you're solving a problem and you make it work.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_01: But like 10 times that or 100 times more
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_01: is when you see your hard work go in someone's hands
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_01: and they use it for the first time.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_01: And they come back to you and say,
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_01: oh, this is so cool or my life changed because of this.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_01: I remember one of my favorite stories from our examples
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_01: of this was when we were working on Twitch.
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_01: And there was this guy who was like a carpet cleaner
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_01: in Minnesota or something who started streaming on the side
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_01: and like they had a really popular channel
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_01: who's making, you know, he's like the first,
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_01: one of the first streamers to make six figures
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_01: just playing video games online.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_01: And he's like this completely changed my life.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_01: And so like moments like that when you build some cool technology
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_01: but then it actually like moves the needle for someone
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_01: and they tell you their stories,
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_01: that's the really motivating thing for me.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_01: And you're just not going to get that, you know,
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_01: if you don't have billions of people using the product.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the idea that you could get like a robot
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: and everyone's home is it's really,
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_00: it's actually totally believable to me.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_00: Like I could see a future which I guess this is what you're building
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_00: towards if it's the right form factor and price point
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: and it does the right set of things.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_00: It seems very believable.
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_00: And I guess like you probably had some range
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: of considerations where you're like,
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: we could make the smallest possible,
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: cheapest possible thing all the way up to,
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: we could try to make a $50,000 humanoid
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_00: and you picked something at some point
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_00: along that spectrum trying to be somewhere there.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: Did you think about it in sort of like a range
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: of like what was technologically possible,
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_00: what future you thought kind of made the most sense?
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_00: Like how'd you pick what sort of like
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_00: complexity and price point to live along?
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_00: Because you're not doing humanoid.
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_00: From day one, my concern is that there's always going to be
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_01: an expectation for what the home robot product can deliver
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_01: and what reality is, especially in the early days.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_01: And that expectation versus reality kind of goes into value.
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_01: How much value you perceive you get from this product.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: There's a scale, there's like cost on one hand,
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_01: value on the other.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_01: We want to do everything possible in our favor
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_01: to tip the scale towards like value.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_01: And so that means like being really aggressive on cost
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_01: to get the price down and make these affordable.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_01: That has the dual benefit on one hand,
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_01: making it so that people are delighted by the product
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_01: because it's not something they spent as much as a new car
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_01: on, they spent something much, much less
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_01: and they're pleasantly surprised hopefully.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_01: And the other is if you get the cost line up,
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_01: you can sell these to a lot of people
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_01: because lots of people can afford them.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: And at this day and age data, real world data
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_01: is one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics.
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_01: And so if you can get lots of robots out there,
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_01: you're going to have lots of data much sooner,
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_01: which then creates this feedback loop
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_01: where the product gets better and then it's worth more
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_01: to people and then more people buy it.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_01: There are a lot of trades where you can build a cool robot
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_01: or add more capabilities or you can reduce the cost
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_01: and we've almost always been in the reduce the cost kind of thing.
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, do you think that the like the humanoid vision
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_00: which is obviously extremely sci-fi and cool?
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_00: Like does it make sense?
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_00: Obviously you could build a robot a bunch of ways
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_00: and like one way you could choose to do it
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: is just like shape it like a person but it's a robot.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_00: You know, maybe there's some reason for it,
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: but like when you think about like the humanoid question,
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_00: like does it intuitively make sense
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: to something that like ought to exist or is it kind of random?
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_00: First of all, when I see the videos
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_01: of human humanoid robots these days
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_01: having worked in the field for a long time,
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_01: it is just so cool.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_01: It's so amazing to see what people are able to come up with
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_01: these days and how fluid the movement looks
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_01: and how dexterous they're getting in terms of the things
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: that they can do.
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_01: And so I think they're amazing machines
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_01: and I think they need to exist in the world.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_01: I think the question for me is,
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_01: if we're talking about putting these robots to work
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_01: or like people owning them,
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_01: the question is like at the end of the day,
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_01: is this the most cost effective way
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_01: to deliver the most value I can,
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_01: you know, to that customer or to that person?
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_01: And I think for humanoids,
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_01: there are very few uses for which the answer is yes.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: Most of the time the answer is no,
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_01: I can build a simpler machine that works in this environment.
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_01: But it's a factory thing where the floors are all flat
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_01: and you're just moving things from one place to another,
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_01: that robot should probably have wheels.
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_01: If you're in a home environment
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_01: and you know, like a humanoid presents all these safety issues
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_01: like with walk-up stairs, if it slips on up,
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_01: banana peel and falls, it becomes a, you know,
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_01: ballistic missile basically going down your stairs.
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_01: These are not good things for the problem.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_01: That's true, actually, like a big, heavy robot
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_00: falling down your stairs is a huge problem.
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so for the home,
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: you probably want to optimize more on low mass, low cost
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_01: and try to maximize what you can do,
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_01: but not running into some of the challenges of a humanoid.
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_01: That said, like there are some things
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_01: that be really hard for a non-humanoid robot to accomplish.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_01: Like if you're on a construction site
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_01: and you're climbing up and down ladders
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_01: and using hand tools to sign for humans,
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_01: all these things, I buy that argument
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_01: that there are some uses where we'll want humanoids,
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_01: but I think it is currently,
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_01: I think people advertising humanoids
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_01: are trying to get hype in the space,
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_01: get more investment in the space which we need,
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_01: but I think the actual practical uses of them,
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_01: it will be a little bit smaller
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_01: than what is being portrayed currently.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_01: It also could make sense that they don't make
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: the most sense in a home, but they live other places.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_00: Like it would be good, for example,
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_00: if like a lot of like defense was carried out by machines,
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: like cause that could in some world, you know,
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_00: I hope that could like save lives, for example,
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: or like you could imagine it sort of like, you know,
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_00: guarding at like, you know, a stadium,
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_00: or like taking care of like, you know,
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_00: big sort of like a patrol areas and things like that.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: So I could see that cause it is like a very mobile thing
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_00: in the home, that example that you just gave,
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_00: you know, it slips and it falls on the stairs
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_00: and it, you know, hurts a kid
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: or an animal or something like that.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_00: I mean, maybe in the distant future,
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_01: we can solve these problems.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_01: I think just near time, you're less likely to see them
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_01: in the home first.
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_01: Along that curve though, between now and of course,
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_00: you know, 50 years out, like obviously these things
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_00: are gonna be, I think it's like cars,
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_00: like get safer than people, you know, one day,
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_00: I assume, but on the way up, what's the regulation
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_00: gonna be like for robotics?
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: Like do you need to be like really involved
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_00: with the government to like put these robots in a home
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: or as part of what you're doing with the design
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_00: like to avoid a lot of that stuff?
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_00: Right now, you know, it's very different
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_01: than some of the industries I've worked in
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_01: or defense things or automotive things
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_01: where they're very, very heavily regulated industries
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_01: and for good reason.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_01: I think you're gonna see a lot of products in the home
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_01: and it depends on your view.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_01: On one hand, we have these little robot vacuums
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_01: going around today and you could make an argument
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_01: that this is kind of just a step up from that.
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_01: But you don't see for consumer products
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_01: a whole lot of targeted regulations for individual products.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_01: We have, you know, general product liability laws
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_01: and other things that are generally applicable
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_01: to everything from chain saws to blenders
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_01: or other things that you might have in your home
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_01: that carry some risk associated with them.
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_01: But I think there's an immense responsibility
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_01: on the developers of these products
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_01: to try to make them safe
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_01: and to do everything possible, following best practices
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_01: regardless of whether or not there's regulation.
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_01: One thing that we may see more of is looking at
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: how the data is used from these products.
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_01: You know, the security of these products,
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_01: I think that's really important.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_01: Obviously, like the home is one of the most intimate spaces
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: in your life.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_01: You know, there needs to be a great degree of trust
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: and responsibility that goes with the companies
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_01: where, you know, have these machines
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_01: that are likely covered with cameras,
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: you know, running around our homes.
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_01: And most of us don't even think about today,
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_01: like when we buy a robot vacuum,
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_01: where does it come from?
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_01: Like, who is the company behind it?
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: Are they trustworthy?
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_01: Are they gonna do the right thing in my home?
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_01: And that's where I'd like to see a lot more scrutiny.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_01: So what does that mean you're gonna need to do?
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_00: Because you're right.
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, I remember, you know,
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_00: people got comfortable at some point,
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: but like the Alexa problem,
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_00: where there's like a microphone in your home,
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_00: it like now there's like a microphone in a camera
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_00: and like whatever else in your home.
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_00: So like what, what does that mean?
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_00: You need it as like a company to sort of a,
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: be, you know, a trusted brand there.
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_00: Like you have to go from day one, pretty hard at that, I guess.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, you have to have some principles
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_01: and opinions and be able to talk about it publicly, I think.
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_01: But, you know, all these products are gonna,
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_01: every new category product like this goes through
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_01: weird snappy was in the early days.
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_01: I mean, when you mentioned Alexa,
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_01: I was thinking to mine when those first came out
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_01: and I was like, I wasn't there with something
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_01: where there's like a TV commercial that came on
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_01: and said, hey, Alexa, something, something,
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_01: and then like across the United States,
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_01: like thousands of people bought toilet paper.
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_01: And then recently with the meta-medaglasses,
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_01: Zuckerberg was on stage and he said something
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: and all the people in the audience,
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_01: their device pinged the server at the same time
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_01: and the demo failed.
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_01: You know, so there's gonna be these weird moments
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_01: and things that come along and the early days that,
[00:17:16] but anyways, on the data side, for us,
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_01: we have like two things we care about.
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_01: One is transparency.
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_01: So if there's data being collected in your home,
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_01: like what was it?
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_01: I wanna be able to know that, you know,
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_01: what that data was and what's going from the robot
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_01: to anywhere else.
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_01: And the second is control.
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_01: You know, if this product is in your home,
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_01: you own it, you need to have the on-off switch
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_01: and be able to control what that data is used for.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_01: And I think if you have those two things
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_01: and you are principled about those things
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_01: and hold true to them and basically fulfill your promises,
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_01: and you give the control to the user,
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_01: I think that's the best, you know,
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: to restarting position for something like this
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_01: is just establish those principles upfront.
[00:17:51] One last question on Robots and we can go to another topic,
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_00: AI models behind robotics.
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_00: How distinct is the concept of like robotics AI
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_00: versus like other AI?
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_01: So I mean, there's a lot of similarities.
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_01: And I think in a way like LLMs that started off as,
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_01: you know, like chatbots that exist purely in the text world
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_01: and robots, which are like physical machines,
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_01: very multimodal in nature.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_01: You can see these things kind of converging
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_01: because the latest models are multimodal.
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_01: They can take in audio, images, other things
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_01: in the same way that your robot is expecting that.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_01: And so over time, I think they're converging a little bit.
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_01: And in fact, a lot of the training approaches,
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: pre-training post-training,
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: those concepts exist in the robotics world.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_01: However, there's still a lot of things
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_01: that are unique to robots,
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: the robotics that you would never do
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_01: if you're working purely on an LLM.
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_01: And that's a lot basically like mixing in real world data,
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_01: different ways of collecting it,
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_01: different ways of using simulation
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_01: and figuring out how to tie that to all the intelligence
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_01: that's embedded in like a modern LLM.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_01: And then the data is like super important here, obviously.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_01: Data is important today.
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_01: I think this is like a now problem.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_01: If you look at LLMs, I think the reason
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_01: that you can see so many different companies,
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_01: like 20 different companies,
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_01: all building foundational models
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_01: and get within a stone's throw of each other
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_01: in terms of performance, small teams, large teams,
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_01: whatever it is, is because essentially,
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_01: they're all starting from the same data set,
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_01: which is the internet and everything
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_01: that can be downloaded from it.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_01: And that data kind of determines the quality
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_01: of the model you can get.
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_01: And there's certainly some alpha on top of that
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_01: from individual teams.
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_01: But in the robotics world,
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_01: there's no corpus of data like the internet that exists.
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_01: There isn't an entire internet of point clouds
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_01: or camera images of robots manipulating objects.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: And so right now we're in this early days
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_01: where you've got either bootstrap that data yourself,
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_01: you've got to pay people to collect it for you
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_01: or you've got to try to interpret
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_01: or generate robot data from other things,
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: like watching YouTube videos and trying to infer
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_01: from hand motions how a robot should do the same thing.
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_01: And so we're just kind of in the early days
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_01: of that for robotics.
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_01: Do you think there should be like a scale AI
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_00: for robotics data or will it be that a company
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_00: like yours just generates its own data
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: and gets smur as a result of that?
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_01: I think there will probably be both.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_01: In fact, I've probably talked to it.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_01: At least it does in companies
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_01: who want to be the scale AI for robotics.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_01: And I think that there's going to be
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_01: plenty of customers for that in the near term,
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_01: especially as this data void exists.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_01: But when that starts to be filled
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_01: and we start to see useful robots in the world,
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_01: I do think the majority of data collection
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_01: will come from robots and less from people getting data.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_01: I would also think that for like for your product,
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_00: for example, any data set that is not your products
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_00: in the wild is going to be approximating the data
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: and the perfect data set I would imagine
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_00: would be if you had armies of robots out in homes
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_00: giving you data.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_00: If your technology is sufficiently advanced
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_01: that you can do transfer learning
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_01: from other forms of data, other robots, YouTube videos,
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_01: whatever it is, any source of data.
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_01: And you can use that to train your robot.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_01: That's like an advantage because you don't,
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_01: that total size of that data set may be much larger
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_01: than just the data set that would be collected
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_01: on your specific robots.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_01: However, where we are today,
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_01: it's much easier to get robots to do amazing things
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_01: if the data collected came from the exact robot
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_01: that you're trying to deploy a model on.
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_01: Totally.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_01: And we'll see if that changes over time.
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_01: So we lived in this before,
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_00: but you obviously started twitch, started crews,
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_00: you're doing it again.
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_00: First of all, why are you so motivated
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_00: to keep doing these hard companies?
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_00: And so like many people after this much success
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_00: wouldn't go back to the beginning.
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_00: And you've had two really successful companies
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_00: which I want to talk about, particularly crews,
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_00: because I think it's related.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_00: But I guess to get started, like,
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_00: what's driving you now to do this again?
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I had a very, very short-lived existential crisis
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_01: after crews is like, oh my gosh,
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm done with this company.
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_01: This is like, you know,
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_01: practically my identity for a full decade, what next?
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_01: I spent some time thinking about that.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_01: You could retire, you could become a venture capitalist.
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_01: Which now?
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_01: There's the same thing.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_01: I think I think I don't know if I'm just getting it.
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_01: And we were super.
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_01: And then after thinking about that for a while,
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_01: I realized like the thing that, you know,
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_01: outside of spending time with my family and friends,
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_01: the thing that brings me the most joy
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_01: is solving really hard problems with really smart people.
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_01: And so like, that is retirement for me.
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_01: That's like the most fun, you know,
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_01: satisfying thing that I could possibly think of to do.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_01: And it also ends up being you can do more of that.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_01: And do it at a larger scale if you work with like a big team
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_01: of people and you do it in the form of a company
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_01: as opposed to a hobby or something
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_01: that you're doing it on your own.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_01: And so to me, I think there's no better thing.
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_01: And maybe at some point I'll run out of energy
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_01: to go hard like I am right now.
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_01: But for now, like this is great.
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_01: We have a brilliant team.
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_01: We're going on this, you know,
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_01: building this exciting new product and a big market.
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_01: And that is energizing to me.
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_01: I want to talk about a couple of the things
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: that you've said about how you want to build this time.
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_00: One this stuck out to me was that you never want to be
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_00: more than 100 people.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_00: First of all, actually, no, is that like literal
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_00: or is that directional?
[00:22:44] To be seen.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_01: OK.
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_01: I think right now we're taking it very seriously.
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_01: So if that is actually your belief and talk about why.
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_01: But if that's actually your belief,
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_01: then you make very different hiring decisions.
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, if I think about the future company
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_01: having 100 people in it, I can allocate this many people
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_01: to this type of role.
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_01: That means every person and every seat
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_01: has to be the best in the world at this
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_01: for the company to be successful.
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_01: And so you end up passing on a lot of people
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_01: that are great people, really talented.
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_01: But they're not at that specific level we want
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_01: for that particular role.
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_01: And I think if you're successful in doing that,
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_01: you end up with this.
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_01: There needs to be a name for it.
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_01: But in the early days of a startup,
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_01: when everyone is on the same page, maybe just the founders,
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_01: they're all in it, 110%.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_01: They're all usually brilliant working together.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_01: They're almost mind-melded.
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_01: And then you have insane productivity
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_01: for some period of time until you get bogged down
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_01: by the organization growing and adding more functions
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_01: and teams of people and management-related
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_01: and some of those kinds of stuff.
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_01: This connected, you have communication issues.
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_00: And so you get this drift away from this pure force of energy
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_01: that isn't the beginning stage of the company.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: And so the reason for trying to have a cap
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_01: on the size of the company is to keep it
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_01: so that we're always in that pure, high output zone.
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_01: And you can't get that if you have too much of a range
[00:23:57] SPEAKER_01: of people in the company, I really think of it more
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_01: like a pro sports team.
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_01: Like you're not going to have the Lakers.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_01: I think you're going to have LeBron James
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_01: and a bunch of high school kids on the team.
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_01: It's like they're all players that are the best
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_01: in the world so that when they work together as a team,
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_01: they can outperform a team that is like a mix of talents.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_01: I was like, if you have the LeBrons with the high school players,
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_00: the LeBrons are like, what are we doing here?
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_00: And they don't stay.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_00: They're going to go play with the best people in the world
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_01: against the best people in the world.
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_01: And that's how you get better and grow.
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_01: And people who are the best in the world of what they do,
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_01: typically got there because I have this growth mindset
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_01: that constantly want to get better.
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_01: And what better way to do that than to surround yourself
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_01: with people of different skill sets that
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_01: are all the best in the world of what they do.
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_01: And to absorb from that.
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_01: Thanks so much for what gets hard as you start
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_00: getting into scaling operations
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_00: and you get into that side of things.
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_00: It just gets so hard to keep it really small.
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_00: Even you think about like, let's say you only
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_00: have 10 non-engineering roles.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_00: It's like, well, someone's got to run finance.
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_00: They probably can't do it alone.
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_00: You've got like, you're going to have all these physical parts.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_00: You're going to have to have buildings for things.
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_00: So how do you think you'll actually try
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_00: to keep a limit on that?
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_00: Will you partner?
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_00: Do you go sort of work with people?
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: How do you actually think that maybe with new AI tool
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_00: and you could just go way further with people?
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_00: And it's just sort of like a do the angioplace?
[00:25:14] Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:25:14] And that's part of why I said to be seen.
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_01: This is a great mental model now.
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_01: And it may not be that special.
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_01: And by the way, I think most of the one
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_00: of the healthiest changes I feel like I've
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_00: seen from five years ago is the shift
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_00: from thinking that big teams are cool to thinking
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_00: big teams are lame.
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, things seem to have been flow, right?
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_01: I'm taking the extreme position here.
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_01: But I do think if that has the effect of causing
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_01: a small shift in that direction,
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_01: that's probably net good for the industry
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: and good for these companies.
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_01: So it would be a question for us.
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: Do we partner or outsource things?
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_01: I think keeping the team small also forces you to focus on
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_01: what are our core competencies, the things that we need
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_01: to do uniquely because we think we can actually do them better
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_01: than any other company that we could potentially work with.
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_01: And for things like a lot of operations or facilities
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_01: or buildings, these are things where maybe we have no reason
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_01: to think we would be the best in the world at this.
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_01: So we should partner.
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of companies have lots of funding.
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_01: They have lots of teams.
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_01: It's almost like they take on these responsibilities
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_01: because they can, not necessarily because they should.
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_00: If that's one of the most important things,
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_00: which I think you've obviously shipped in self-driving
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_00: in a way that very few have.
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_00: But I think in a lot of these more sci-fi areas,
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_00: it's very easy to not be in shipping mindset.
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_00: And I think you did this really well at cruise.
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_00: Obviously, opening it, I was doing this wall before chat
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_00: GPT.
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_00: And so you basically probably are in a mindset
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_00: I assume I figured out how quickly can we ship
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_00: and iterate and that's got to be the mindset rather than just
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_00: in warehouse building the perfect robot forever.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: I think for that, it's starting the thing you want to build.
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_01: And then working back to what is the constraint?
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: What are the constraints or bottlenecks
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_01: that we need to be, that we need to make our number one priority
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_01: because it can not go faster than what that one bottleneck
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_01: or constraint would dictate.
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_01: And for self-driving, that's a combination of safety, trust,
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_01: and public acceptance.
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: And so those are different work streams
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_01: or basically, unless those are all green,
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_01: you don't have a product.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't matter how good the technology is.
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_01: And there are similar things for home robot
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_01: or really any business.
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_01: And so mapping out what those are
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_01: and basically making that the company's top priority.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_01: Like it cruise, for example, see,
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_01: the metrics were the single thing we talked about
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_01: every week, week over week over week,
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_01: making progress towards those.
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_01: And I think for any company, what you talk about,
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_01: what you may design your metrics around,
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_01: kind of sets the tone for the company.
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_01: And it's got to be aligned with that,
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_01: whatever the constraints are.
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_01: What do you think you can do in a home first reliant?
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_00: What do you think will be the first activity
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_00: that can really be done well in a home?
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_00: And then what are the things that you think are closed
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_00: to maybe follow in the next 12 to 24 months or something?
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, there are hierarchies,
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_01: I think of tasks for a home robot.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_01: And if you look at, I think, a classic 2x2 grid,
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_01: I guess one is maybe the technical complexity of the task,
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_01: like how hard is it to get a robot to do this successfully?
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_01: And then the second is, what is the success rate
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_01: that is acceptable to a customer or product like this?
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_01: And I'll give you an example.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_01: If you are in the easy side of things
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_01: from the technical capability and also the very forgiving
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_01: side of things in terms of success rate,
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_01: it's probably picking up your kid's toys.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_01: So I have two kids, a one-year-old and a seven-year-old,
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_01: and they're between the two of them
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_01: and they're constantly making messes and toys
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_01: or all over the house running around picking up toys.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_01: And so if you have a product that you can buy,
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_01: you can go to the store, buy this thing,
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_01: put it in your house, push a button, turn it on,
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_01: and then when you're gone for the day,
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_01: all the toys are magically put away
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_01: the whole time you get home.
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_01: It's like a mind-blowing experience.
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_01: And let's say it screws up in two out of the hundred toys
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_01: are still on the floor when you get home.
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_01: That's okay.
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't skip the beat.
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_01: So that, you think about
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_01: nine's of reliability for engineering.
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_01: Maybe one nine is fine for that particular task.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_01: There are other things, putting a wine glass
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_01: in a dishwasher where the technical complexity
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_01: is a little higher.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_01: What's hard about that, by the way,
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_01: is it like the grabbing?
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so if you think about picking up objects,
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_01: this microphone, which is gonna make a noise when I squish it,
[00:28:58] is compliant.
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_01: And so if I'm off a little bit on where I grip it,
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_01: or how much I squeeze it,
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_01: I'm not gonna shatter this microphone
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_01: in two million pieces.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_01: For wine glass, the margin is very thin.
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_01: And so from a dexterity standpoint,
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_01: it's a little more fragile.
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_01: Actually, sometimes I think about that.
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_00: That's like a good example of a thing
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_00: where I'm like, it's amazing that people can do certain things.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_00: Squeeze a wine glass, the right amount,
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_00: or hit a ball with a racket,
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_00: or a golf club with the right angle,
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_00: or something like that,
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_00: or catch something that's flying while you're moving.
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_00: It's actually pretty crazy what you can do mechanically.
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_00: It is, and the evolution to how we get there
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_01: is interesting too, because my one-year-old daughter,
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_01: her hands are like open clothes.
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_01: There's nothing in between.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_01: She grabs objects.
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_01: The wine glass is shattered.
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_01: And at some point along the way,
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_01: we developed much more nuanced skills and abilities.
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_01: But so wine glass is another one.
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_01: The only thing is challenging is if you're putting a wine glass
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_01: on a rack, and it's a thin stem or something,
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_01: and you think bump into something,
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_01: you might break the stem off, right?
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_01: And so not only is it more difficult
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_01: from a technical standpoint,
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_01: but if you shatter a wine glass in someone's dishwasher,
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_01: they're probably not going to be your customer anymore.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_01: That's right.
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_01: And so that's like several nines of reliability.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_01: And so I think that this sort of spectrum
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_01: of technical difficulty and basically forgivability
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_01: is going to take the types of things.
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_01: You see homework bots do first.
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_01: And I think we'll work our way up towards,
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_01: I think the holy grail of a homework bot,
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_01: which is like dishes, laundry, and maybe cooking.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_01: These things, all of them have all of these little,
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_01: it's like a minefield.
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_01: You do one thing wrong and you ruin the whole process.
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_01: Like for laundry, if you put the red sock in with the whites,
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_01: you know, have pink laundry, that's like game over, right?
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_01: And it's, you know, so there's things like that.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_01: For cooking, it's the same thing.
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_01: You put too much salt or pepper in there in the dishes room.
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: You know, so these are things that I think we'll get to
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_01: and it'll happen pretty quick.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_01: But, you know, I think it's like cooking a steak at some point.
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, why not?
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_01: If you think about at the end of the day,
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_01: you have pick and place and simple manipulation,
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_01: that's what cooking is.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: They're just like a much higher degree of reliability.
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_01: And there's other things around food safety and bacteria
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: and other things that come in cookie, cooking and temperature sensing
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_01: and whatnot like that.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: So it's all doable.
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_01: It's just like, I think at some point, it's like,
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_01: hey, robot, I'm at work right now.
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_00: There's a steak in the fridge.
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_00: Please cook it and clean up everything by the time I'm like 15 years
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_00: from now, that's that doable.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_00: Less than five.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_01: Less than five.
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_01: This stuff is going fast.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_01: Again, if you saw, if you look at the robots you can buy today
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_01: in the world, like the nice robot vacuums, you may not think that.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_01: If you see what's happening behind closed doors
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_01: at the Betz robotics companies in the world,
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_01: you might think that.
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_01: And if you're the leadership of these companies,
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_01: the technical leadership and you kind of know where things are going,
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_01: you absolutely, if that,
[00:31:30] SPEAKER_01: the hand seems really, as we're talking about this,
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_00: I was sort of like stupidly like,
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_00: I was like, actually, hands pretty good.
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_00: Like your fingers are like pliable.
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_00: You have like a lot of degrees of freedom.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_00: You have like multiple grip points.
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_00: Is the hand the optimal thing?
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: The hand is really important to get right
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_01: because it is the robot's interface to every object
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_01: that it interacts with.
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_01: If you make it too simplistic or not enough sensing capabilities
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_01: or whatever, then you have to have a much, much smarter brain
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_01: to figure out how to use this primitive tool
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_01: to accomplish a complicated task.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_01: And so the more mechanical complexity or capability
[00:32:02] SPEAKER_01: that you add to a hand, the more sensing ability,
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_01: interior, we require less rocket science
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_01: to figure out how to do a task with that hand.
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_01: The trade, of course, is the more technology,
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_01: the more degrees of freedom or motors
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_01: that you pack into a hand,
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_01: the more complicated it becomes,
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_01: which impacts durability and also cost.
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_01: And so there's push and pull there to find that sweet spot
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_01: where you can basically come up with the simplest hand possible
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_01: to do the tasks you want to do at the lowest cost
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_01: while also being able to accomplish everything
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_01: in a fairly straightforward manner.
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_01: But I think in the limit,
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_01: there's a lot of, we think by analogy a lot.
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_01: And we have two hands and two arms.
[00:32:37] SPEAKER_01: And so a lot of the robots you see today
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_01: have two hands and two arms.
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_01: But it is really interesting thought experiment.
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_01: What does the ultimate hand arm thing look like?
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_01: And I think it was Rodney Brooks who said this the other day.
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_01: But I actually do kind of think maybe it ends up being
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_01: some crazy octopus tentacle-looking thing
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_01: in the future that's very adaptable
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_01: and collision to small spaces.
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_01: Interesting.
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_01: Well, I think that the human hand was ended up
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: where we are due to probably some impossible
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_01: to unravel sequence of evolutionary pressures, right?
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_01: Well, it's like you start down some path
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_00: and then you do your best.
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_00: Evolution does its best,
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_00: given some somewhat random starting point, I suppose, right?
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so if you could go back a million years
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_01: and hit the reset button on human evolution,
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_01: you might start with something
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_01: that you fork would emerge and it would be more
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_01: a typical like or who knows what.
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_01: But I am skeptical that the way that human hands
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_01: and arms evolved is the ultimate.
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_01: And so the challenge will be like,
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_01: can we figure out what that is?
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_00: I have a couple of stupid questions about the robot at home.
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_00: One is how strong could it be?
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_00: Like is it a hundred pound robot?
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_00: Like it must be ridiculously stronger than a person, right?
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_00: I would think for a hundred pound robot,
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_01: you could certainly make it maybe stronger
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_01: in some dimensions.
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_01: There are some things that are sort of soft biological muscles
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_01: are pretty good at.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_01: Are stronger than like a physical robot pound
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_00: for pound kind of thing?
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's really hard to say.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_01: I think so.
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_01: I think probably the state of the art
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_01: Boston Dynamics robot seems like it's on par
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_01: if not more capable than a human.
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_01: And if not now, I'm sure the next couple of generations
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_01: will be.
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_01: So that's kind of interesting.
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_01: That's surprising that a soft muscle is stronger than like,
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_00: I don't know why I would think a robot
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_00: could be dramatically stronger.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I've been going down the rabbit hole
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_01: on this a little bit, thinking about like, you know,
[00:34:09] SPEAKER_01: as again, our focus on affordability and cost.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_01: Like is a electromagnetic gear motor
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_01: where you've got a magnets and copper winding
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_01: in a bunch of gears in a housing?
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_01: Is that the most cost effective durable way
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_01: to generate motion for a robot?
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: And the answer in the short term is probably yes.
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_01: But I think there are some interesting things happening
[00:34:27] SPEAKER_01: where we're trying to mimic either some
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: of the chemical processes or electrostatic actuators
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_01: or other things that are similar in how they work
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_01: to like a human muscle.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_01: And the benefit there is you can get a higher cycle count,
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_01: more silent operation, and potentially more power density.
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_01: Like how much strength can you get into a physical volume
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_01: than what we have today in gear motors?
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_01: And then potentially much, much beyond what humans have
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_01: in our muscles.
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_01: Isn't like hydraulic is pretty strong.
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_01: Like hydraulic pressure is pretty strong.
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_01: Hydrologs can be extremely powerful,
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_01: but they have other trades, typically noisy,
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_01: the valves and things are pretty expensive,
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_01: can be harder to control and get high fidelity motion.
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_01: And so in terms of power density may be good,
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_01: but there are other trades and the reasons
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_01: you don't see this on a lot of robots.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_01: In my sense.
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_00: Another question I have that's sort of like probably
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_00: off spec, but while we're talking,
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_00: is this going to be something that would have home security
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_00: applications as well?
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_00: Or does that then take you into weird territory
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_00: that's just not worth going to?
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think so.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_01: I mean, one of the challenges with a home robot
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_01: is this kind of general purpose.
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_01: And so what are people going to use this thing for?
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's hard if you just have a laundry list
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_01: of 50 different items that the thing can do
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_01: and security is one of them.
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_01: But I do think a lot of people will be out and about
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_01: and with their home robot at home be like,
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_01: oh, I wonder if I forgot to turn off the gas on the stove
[00:35:38] SPEAKER_01: and some robot over there to just tell you
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: or even take it on for yourself.
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_01: In the same way, you could be like,
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_01: hey, robot, if you see any person in my home
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_01: or any doors open, let me know.
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, if you see me getting burglarized, like do something.
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_00: But I don't know if you would think of it
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_01: as a security robot so much as like,
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_01: this is just one of the many responsibilities
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_01: of my home robot is to keep tabs on my home.
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_01: Totally.
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_01: Alerting probably is good.
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_00: Taking actions probably not.
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_00: I hadn't thought about that side of that.
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_01: You know, that's not really in our, that makes sense.
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm just thinking because like, you know,
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_00: in my head I'm like, okay, if there's this brilliant
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_00: capable robot in the house, my guess is you're going to have
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_00: a lot of people want it to start doing a ridiculous number
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_00: of things for them.
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_00: It'll be the arc of time and then you'll have to choose
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_00: from that set, like what goes in.
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think so.
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_01: But for sure, I'm in the security side.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_01: I would hope though, rather than having like physical
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_01: deterrence and like, you know, having your home robot turn
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_01: into a security guard with a baton or something,
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_01: it's more so that it just becomes unattractive
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_01: to rob homes or do, you know, break in and enter into a home,
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: maybe in the same way that, you know,
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_01: a world full of cars where everyone has like that Tesla
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_01: sent you the mode.
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_01: There's very little incentive to break into cars.
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_01: It's not worth the risk.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, even like a security system just makes a
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_00: loud sound and calls the police.
[00:36:52] SPEAKER_00: I think that's pretty effective.
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_00: It's a true effect.
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_00: And I think those systems are pretty old.
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_00: And you know, they're deeply embedded and but yeah.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_00: It's like you may figure out how to disable the alarm
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_01: and sneak into the house.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_01: But if there's a robot, you know, rolling around and then
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_00: a sirens blaring and stuff.
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: I just think it'll be interesting where if this gets in there,
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_00: my guess is people will start to, I could see a future
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_00: where people expect a ridiculous amount from these things.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean, it's such something interesting.
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_01: I've thought about is like when you ask people,
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_01: are we ask people, what would you do with a home robot?
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_01: You know, they immediately what comes to mind is like the
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_01: thing that's most annoying to you today to do in your home.
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's good.
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_01: We want to help with the annoying stuff.
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_01: And what comes out like laundry probably?
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, laundry dishes picking up after my kids,
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_01: you know, wiping surfaces cleaning, like these are the
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_01: things you would expect.
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_01: And so we're going to chip away those things for sure.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_01: But what I also like to think about is the things that
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_01: we don't do because we value our time more than that.
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_01: The example is if you've ever gone to like a really nice hotel,
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_01: you know, the slippers are laid out for you.
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_01: There's a glass of water on the night stand,
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_01: a little chocolate on the pillow,
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_01: all these like little bushes.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_01: Like I don't know.
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_01: I think that, you know,
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_01: robot should not only automate the things that we don't want to do,
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_01: but also like elevate our standard of living to some degree.
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:38:00] SPEAKER_01: And so I love the idea that if you can afford a really
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_01: affordable home robot, we're going to give you a lifestyle
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_01: that, you know, would otherwise be inaccessible to you.
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_01: Totally.
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_00: I mean, that's actually a really interesting point that like,
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_00: a lot of the types of things you're talking about don't require any new inputs.
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_00: It's just about taking care of your home in a certain way.
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_00: That's like beyond what you would normally need.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_00: But it's like, you've got a bunch of towels that are like sitting in the laundry room
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_00: that are clean.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_00: But can you like put those by, you know, the shower and like roll them up nicely?
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_01: And maybe don't eat all these things.
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_01: But the point is like, you know, your time is more valuable than it's very scarce.
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_01: Like humanity's time, I think is really important.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_01: But for a robot that's got 24 hours to sit around in your home and like,
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_01: yeah, make your life better, what could we come up with for it to do?
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_01: What could it come up with to do for you?
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_01: That's an interesting question.
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_01: Wow.
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_00: I'm curious about reflecting on what you've learned from the way self driving cars played
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_00: out and how it might matter here.
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_00: Maybe one interesting sort of case study is, you know, the Tesla versus way more approaches.
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_00: Do you think in any way that how that played out or any learnings there that poured over
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_00: to like what could, you know, be impactful in the robotics land?
[00:39:05] Well, it's hard to say that, you know, very different approaches to getting to market,
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_01: but it does seem like they're both trying to converge at the same thing,
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_01: which is self driving cars everywhere.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_01: I think one thing that was really brilliant about Tesla's approach,
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: they found a way to sell the product essentially before it was full of complete
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_01: if we're looking purely at the self driving side and generate billions of dollars of cash flow,
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_01: which they could use to bolster their core business,
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_01: but also continue to invest in R&D to make this self-driving product.
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_01: Waymo by comparison, you know, has taken almost a couple decades at this point,
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_01: maybe not quite that long, and probably tens of billions of dollars of investment
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_01: in the revenue relative to that has been fairly neager compared to that total investment over time,
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_01: which basically means that the only companies in the world who can do this
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_01: are the ones with that kind of capital on their balance sheet to basically fund this crazy amount
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_01: of R&D year over year.
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's no coincidence that the only companies who succeeded in that approach
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_01: or are on track to succeed in that approach are owned by Amazon, Google,
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_01: or like a major car company, and that was even a struggle for a company like General Motors.
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_01: And so in the home robot space, I hope we don't repeat that.
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_01: I hope it doesn't become the case that the only companies that make it
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_01: are ones that are basically kept alive through billions or tens of billions of dollars
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_01: from a corporate benefactor.
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_01: And instead, we can find clever ways to get to market that...
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_01: Which I guess is why you need to get to market and be selling something along the way
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_00: to fund all of this.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_00: Well, I think if your development cycle means you don't get to meaningful revenue
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_01: or five to ten years after the company has started, it means you're entirely dependent
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_01: on either being acquired or the capital market's point being pointed in the right direction.
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_01: And historically, things tend to cycle back and forth.
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_01: And a five to ten year timeline, you're getting awfully close to almost guaranteeing that
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_01: you straddle like a down cycle as well as an up one, and that can be the killer for these companies.
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_01: We don't need to talk about crews and GM too much, but I am curious about...
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_00: I saw you share it on cheeky paint about not wanting to sell.
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_00: And I'm just curious, your mindset about the sense of autonomy
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_00: and how you think about selling the companies since you've been through it a couple of times
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_00: and everything.
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_01: I think...
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_01: And I said this before, but my conclusion is if you are selling a company, it should be
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_01: because the reason you started the company or the thesis that you had in mind
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_01: or the thing you wanted to build, something has changed.
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_01: And maybe you're no longer interested in it, your life circumstances have changed, whatever.
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_01: But I think it is a fantasy to believe that you can sell your company, like how you're
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_01: kicking it to, like sell your company in order for the mission.
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_00: And for the mission.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_01: And I think in theory, this can happen sometimes, but it is so, so rare.
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_01: It is right.
[00:41:42] SPEAKER_01: And I think more likely than not, you'd be disappointed with that outcome.
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_01: And therefore, like for me, I can't imagine being in a situation where I would trade,
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_01: you know, the opportunity to build this amazing thing and control it and make sure it happens
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_01: in a way that I want it to for some kind of partnership or liquidity.
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_01: So that just doesn't make sense to me, maybe not for everyone.
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_01: And maybe that's just because I'm so excited about this thing and bringing this new idea
[00:42:02] SPEAKER_01: of a home robot into the world that like it just wouldn't even cross my mind that thought
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_01: of like handing over the reins to someone else.
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're sort of pointing out, well, like this type of company is such a forever project.
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_00: And like you're now able to start a company that's like, you know, it's not, it is not
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_00: some little thing like if this works, it's just such an important thing.
[00:42:18] SPEAKER_00: Which also I guess that probably also drives you to want to sort of hold on to it indefinitely.
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, perhaps.
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_00: But I think I'm not selfish about it.
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_01: Like if I, you know, I feel like I have an obligation to stay true to, you know, our
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_01: investors, the employees and the mission.
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, even though I certainly want to hold on to this, I'm not treating it like
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_01: a pet project.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_01: I actually do want to like fulfill this broader vision that we all share.
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, maybe as a final thing to touch on, you did this crazy like marathon around the
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_00: world experience.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_00: What was that like why did you do something that seemed so, you know, hard?
[00:42:50] SPEAKER_00: Deep in the, in the middle of crews, I was, I think I was frankly like kind of frustrated
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_01: that like we were putting in all this energy and sometimes there would just be periods
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_01: where the metrics wouldn't always go up into the right.
[00:42:59] SPEAKER_01: We'd dig a regression and then go back and forth.
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know, the result wasn't always proportionate to the energy going in.
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_01: And for running for me at least, that was not the case.
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_01: You put in the time.
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_01: You're running better.
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_01: And so that's very deterministic and satisfying.
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_01: So I needed something to balance that I feel like in my life.
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_01: And as I do, I went down a rabbit hole reading about like extreme marathons that you can
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_01: do.
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_01: I was like sort of amateur marathon runner and came across the world marathon challenge.
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_01: It's this thing you can sign up for.
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_01: They take you to each continent one continent per day and you run a marathon on each one.
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_01: And then like the next day you fly to the next continent.
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_01: I thought that is insane.
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_01: And then in fine print on the website, it's like the world record is like five days and
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_01: ten hours by this one guy.
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: And that got through the wheels turning.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, I wonder what the theoretical engine or brain clicks on.
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_01: I wonder what the fastest theoretical time you could do is if you optimize the traveling
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_01: salesman.
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_01: It's a part of the continent.
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, where you land, opt-ons for customs, in and out and logistics and like really
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_01: dial it up to 11.
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_01: And that turned into an 18 month obsession.
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_01: Got stuck in my head.
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_01: And I ended up writing some software to find the shortest route between the seven continents.
[00:44:03] SPEAKER_01: That's crazy.
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_01: My problem is that I could run a half marathon.
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_01: That's where I would struggle.
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_01: This sort of stubbornness and attachment to this idea meant that part of this was I had
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_01: to train my body physically to be able to do this.
[00:44:13] SPEAKER_01: Because like you're running a marathon and then you're not resting afterwards.
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_01: So the cycle, for example, is you know, you start in Cape Town so that you fly to Antarctica.
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_01: You have to start there because the weather is so okay.
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_01: The Antarctica one, that's tough.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_00: You need like a at least a call it a six hour window of decent weather.
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_01: And you're like looking at the weather forecast when it clears, then you fly in and you land,
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_01: you run the marathon, you get out because that can throw off the.
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_01: Where in Antarctica do you do this?
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_00: And like the most temperate outer part of Antarctica.
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_01: So it's on the continent, but we're not talking like South Pole.
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_01: So it's full, but it's not like, but it's not snowy.
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's icy and you can't say it's like bare in all ice and you land the plane
[00:44:48] SPEAKER_01: on ice, you run on ice.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_01: You're running on ice.
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_01: On ice.
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_01: Kind of like crunchy ice.
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_01: There's like a ski slope groomer that did a course down there.
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_01: It's like a six mile loop or something.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_01: And so it was like running on, it's like trail running.
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: Got it.
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_01: So pretty crazy.
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_01: That's crazy.
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_01: I was organizing the logistics for the training, training my body and everything and
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_01: doing it in the end, ended up doing this in about three and a half days, which blew
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_01: the world record aside.
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_01: And then after 18 months doing this and finishing it, you know, I got to say like it was,
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_01: it was, it was, you ever like finished the last item on your to-do list and it's just
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_01: like a dopamine hit.
[00:45:20] SPEAKER_01: You know, I feel so great.
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_01: That's what it was.
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_01: It was like relief.
[00:45:24] SPEAKER_01: It's like check the box.
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_01: Now I can, my tormented brain, which wouldn't let this go for 18 months, can finally relax.
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_01: Where do you go Cape Town, Antarctica, South America?
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_01: And then to Panama City and then I think to Madrid and then Oman.
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_01: And you're just like by the last one, are you just crazy fried or were you in shape to
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_00: just not be, you know, so beaten down as pretty fried, pretty fried.
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_01: But it's like, you know, the training I did peaked it doing three marathons within a
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_01: 24 hour period in three different cities.
[00:45:53] SPEAKER_01: That was like the stress test for this, if you will.
[00:45:56] SPEAKER_01: And my coach was like, you know, it's like only three marathons.
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_01: That's not seven.
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_01: Is that actually the red amount of training?
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_01: And he said, I promise you, when you're doing the real thing and you have this whole crew
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_01: of people with you and everything is on the line and the adrenaline going, if you can
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_01: do three and 24 hours, you can do the rest and he was right as well.
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_01: That's like the hardest physical task.
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm mad.
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_00: You know, mental toughness is important for startups.
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_01: And I feel like it really helps me quite a bit in that domain.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_00: Totally.
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_00: Kyle, this is really fun.
[00:46:23] Thanks for making time for it.
[00:46:24] Thank you.
