[00:00:00] We call it vibe trading.
[00:00:02] Vlad Tenev: So you know, there's vibe coding.
[00:00:03] Vlad Tenev: I think there will be vibe trading,
[00:00:04] Vlad Tenev: which sounds a little flippant.
[00:00:06] Vlad Tenev: Well, but you know what?
[00:00:07] Vlad Tenev: The thing is that we're not a trading platform.
[00:00:09] Jack Altman: It's like, you know, it's like a financial home.
[00:00:10] Jack Altman: It's like vibe finances.
[00:00:12] Jack Altman: It's like, you know, because you have all these other products,
[00:00:14] Jack Altman: I assume it's going to, you know,
[00:00:15] Jack Altman: like vibes set up my, you know, kids 529 account,
[00:00:18] Jack Altman: which is, you know, not okay.
[00:00:20] Vlad Tenev: Here's the areas that I'm most interested in.
[00:00:22] All right, glad I'm super excited to be here.
[00:00:24] Jack Altman: Thanks for doing this with you today.
[00:00:26] Jack Altman: Oh, glad to have you.
[00:00:27] Jack Altman: Okay, so I wanted to start by getting sort of your
[00:00:30] Jack Altman: historical lay of the land of online brokerage.
[00:00:33] Jack Altman: And maybe we don't have to go all the way back,
[00:00:35] Jack Altman: but if you could sort of just go back to, you know,
[00:00:37] Jack Altman: maybe like the early days of online stock trading
[00:00:41] Jack Altman: into sort of like, you know,
[00:00:42] Jack Altman: Vanguard and Schwab and Fidelity.
[00:00:45] Jack Altman: And now you've got like online platforms
[00:00:47] Jack Altman: for trading that are modern like Robinhood.
[00:00:49] Jack Altman: Just like what sort of the history
[00:00:51] Jack Altman: and sort of the narrative as you see it?
[00:00:53] Jack Altman: There's a great book about this.
[00:00:55] Vlad Tenev: A piece of the action by Noceira.
[00:00:58] Vlad Tenev: It covers basically the modern, the rise of the modern
[00:01:01] Vlad Tenev: financial industry, which is super interesting.
[00:01:05] Vlad Tenev: I mean, it's basically a story of a big wave
[00:01:09] Vlad Tenev: of democratization associated with lower costs.
[00:01:14] Vlad Tenev: So, Charles Schwab began in the 70s.
[00:01:20] Vlad Tenev: I think there's a lot of similarities
[00:01:21] Vlad Tenev: if you look back between what Charles Schwab was to begin with
[00:01:26] Vlad Tenev: and kind of what Robinhood is sometimes accused of being, right?
[00:01:30] Vlad Tenev: Before Schwab, Merrill Lynch was the big broker.
[00:01:35] Vlad Tenev: And really they had brokers that would sell you trades
[00:01:39] Vlad Tenev: and call you and convince you to buy stuff.
[00:01:42] Vlad Tenev: And they would charge hundreds of dollars per trade.
[00:01:45] Vlad Tenev: And then after that, there was the event
[00:01:48] Vlad Tenev: that led to the creation of Charles Schwab was called Mayday.
[00:01:51] Vlad Tenev: I forget the exact date, but it was in 1972.
[00:01:55] Vlad Tenev: And up until that point, commissions were regulated.
[00:01:59] Vlad Tenev: So you could not charge under a certain amount
[00:02:04] Vlad Tenev: per trade for commission.
[00:02:06] Vlad Tenev: And Mayday led to deregulation of trading commissions,
[00:02:11] Vlad Tenev: which allowed Schwab to enter the business.
[00:02:14] Vlad Tenev: And Schwab said, you know what, we're going to cut costs.
[00:02:16] Vlad Tenev: We're going to make it as efficient as possible.
[00:02:19] Vlad Tenev: So we're not going to have branch offices.
[00:02:22] Vlad Tenev: You're going to call us on the phone.
[00:02:23] Vlad Tenev: We're not going to try to sell you anything.
[00:02:26] Vlad Tenev: We'll just process your ticket over the phone, make your trade.
[00:02:29] Vlad Tenev: And we'll do it for, I don't know what it was, call it $75 per trade.
[00:02:34] Vlad Tenev: And so they were in the news in the early days
[00:02:37] Vlad Tenev: for creating this like extremely sophisticated phone
[00:02:41] Vlad Tenev: dialing system that could handle lots of simultaneous,
[00:02:45] Vlad Tenev: like they innovated using the tools they had at the time.
[00:02:49] And then in the 1980s, the Apple 2 came out, right?
[00:02:54] Vlad Tenev: And actually in Palo Alto, not very far from here,
[00:02:58] Vlad Tenev: two guys, Bill Porter.
[00:03:01] Vlad Tenev: And I forget his partner's name, Randy or something.
[00:03:06] Vlad Tenev: They met at a party and Bill Porter had just bought an Apple 2 computer.
[00:03:12] And he had this idea of what could I, what if I use this machine
[00:03:16] Vlad Tenev: to trade stocks from my home?
[00:03:19] Vlad Tenev: And the two of them got very excited about this idea
[00:03:24] Vlad Tenev: and they decided to make a business out of it.
[00:03:26] Vlad Tenev: And each trade was born.
[00:03:28] Vlad Tenev: And of course, that was sort of the origins of it.
[00:03:31] Vlad Tenev: It went public 10 years later during the .com boom.
[00:03:36] Vlad Tenev: And it became one of the first profitable .coms.
[00:03:42] Vlad Tenev: For a long time, the whole internet thing was dismissed as a fad.
[00:03:47] Vlad Tenev: Nobody thought that there would be a way for many of these companies to make money.
[00:03:51] Vlad Tenev: But online brokerage was, I think one of the first, if not the first,
[00:03:56] Vlad Tenev: proven business model that could be profitable in the internet era.
[00:04:01] Vlad Tenev: So that was e-trade.
[00:04:02] Vlad Tenev: And you probably remember maybe when you were a kid,
[00:04:06] Vlad Tenev: they were heavy on marketing.
[00:04:07] Vlad Tenev: They had that baby, it was kind of a cultural moment.
[00:04:10] Vlad Tenev: The .com boom was when I started trading myself.
[00:04:13] Vlad Tenev: I opened my first brokerage account.
[00:04:14] Vlad Tenev: And then Robinhood started, let's say,
[00:04:19] Vlad Tenev: what would have that been?
[00:04:20] Vlad Tenev: 2015 was when we launched.
[00:04:22] Vlad Tenev: 2012, 2013 was when I got the idea.
[00:04:26] Vlad Tenev: And our big innovation, I think there were three innovations that led to Robinhood.
[00:04:32] Vlad Tenev: First was obviously mobile.
[00:04:34] Vlad Tenev: Everyone else had ignored mobile.
[00:04:36] Vlad Tenev: And we made the bet that people were saying mobile is a toy.
[00:04:41] Vlad Tenev: Nobody would do serious financial transactions on their smartphone.
[00:04:45] Vlad Tenev: But that would become primary.
[00:04:47] Vlad Tenev: So we'd built for that when everyone else was ignoring it.
[00:04:52] Vlad Tenev: The second bet we made was that
[00:04:56] high frequency trading had completely changed institutional finance
[00:05:01] Vlad Tenev: on an infrastructure level.
[00:05:03] Vlad Tenev: So entire rooms that would have been full of trading desks, people picking up phones and making trades.
[00:05:11] Vlad Tenev: Or being disrupted by five to 10 kids out of MIT creating HFT firms.
[00:05:18] Vlad Tenev: And so we took the technology from a sophisticated high frequency trading firm.
[00:05:22] Vlad Tenev: And that became the backbone for our retail product, which allowed us to lower costs and
[00:05:27] Vlad Tenev: offer commission-free trading.
[00:05:29] Vlad Tenev: And at that time, commissions were still between $7 to $10.
[00:05:32] Vlad Tenev: So that was a huge disruption.
[00:05:34] Vlad Tenev: And the third thing, the company was sort of formed in the wake of
[00:05:39] Vlad Tenev: the global financial crisis and the whole Occupy Wall Street movement.
[00:05:43] Vlad Tenev: And if you think back on the global financial crisis,
[00:05:48] Vlad Tenev: I had graduated Stanford 2008 and gone to grad school.
[00:05:51] Vlad Tenev: My first month in grad school, Lehman Brothers went under.
[00:05:55] Vlad Tenev: It was kind of an interesting thing because a lot of my friends, the ones that were most secure
[00:06:00] Vlad Tenev: in their financial careers, just all of a sudden, as quickly as they came into their jobs.
[00:06:06] Vlad Tenev: And they had their internship at Lehman Brothers.
[00:06:09] Vlad Tenev: They got their return offer.
[00:06:11] Vlad Tenev: They were very proud.
[00:06:12] Vlad Tenev: They had three years of job security in front of them.
[00:06:14] Vlad Tenev: And then they were going to go get an MBA.
[00:06:17] Vlad Tenev: There was this well-defined path.
[00:06:18] Vlad Tenev: And then it evaporated.
[00:06:19] Vlad Tenev: Evaporated.
[00:06:20] Vlad Tenev: And you had the images of them with the packing up their cubicles with the boxes.
[00:06:25] Vlad Tenev: There was just a lot of disillusionment, particularly among young people,
[00:06:30] Vlad Tenev: among millennials with the financial system.
[00:06:33] Vlad Tenev: Because some of this happened to them.
[00:06:35] Vlad Tenev: They saw it happen to their parents.
[00:06:37] Vlad Tenev: It felt like they were the victims, young people in particular,
[00:06:40] Vlad Tenev: of forces beyond their understanding that were just like packaging products and taking risk,
[00:06:48] Vlad Tenev: making things complicated, and that there was no accountability.
[00:06:51] Vlad Tenev: No one went to jail as a result of crimes committed in the global financial crisis.
[00:06:57] Vlad Tenev: Nobody big anyway.
[00:06:58] Vlad Tenev: Yeah.
[00:06:59] Vlad Tenev: And I think this led to the Occupy Wall Street movement, which was really a young
[00:07:05] Vlad Tenev: person, a millennial thing.
[00:07:08] Vlad Tenev: And I think it opened the door to a new brand in the space.
[00:07:11] Vlad Tenev: Like, no love was lost between young people and the big financial companies.
[00:07:17] Vlad Tenev: And Robin Hood, along with mobile, along with the great technology that enabled
[00:07:23] Vlad Tenev: commission-free trading, I think it had a particular resonance.
[00:07:27] Vlad Tenev: Because it was a very optimistic message in a way.
[00:07:31] Vlad Tenev: It was kind of the anti-occupy, whereas Occupy said the system doesn't work.
[00:07:37] Vlad Tenev: We just have to reset and start it all over,
[00:07:41] Vlad Tenev: which I think was not really actionable.
[00:07:43] Vlad Tenev: And that's why the whole movement ended up fizzling out without much impact.
[00:07:47] Vlad Tenev: And we were saying, why don't we plug you into the system?
[00:07:51] Vlad Tenev: If we get more and more people to become investors,
[00:07:54] Vlad Tenev: to own the best companies.
[00:07:56] Vlad Tenev: And we want to make it easy and engaging and actually
[00:08:01] Vlad Tenev: enjoyable to do so, then we could solve a lot of these same problems.
[00:08:05] Vlad Tenev: And I think at the time, there was a need for a new brand.
[00:08:09] Vlad Tenev: And the story of Robin Hood resonated just as much as the product and the technology.
[00:08:13] Vlad Tenev: When I think about Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, for some reason,
[00:08:17] Jack Altman: I think those brands were always not deeply connecting with the younger generation,
[00:08:23] Jack Altman: or maybe going out of their way to be as loud as they could have been.
[00:08:28] Jack Altman: When I think about the big banks, there was definitely a lot of animosity
[00:08:32] Jack Altman: between just the population and the big banks.
[00:08:35] Jack Altman: I feel like that, for whatever reason,
[00:08:37] Jack Altman: I feel like there was neither animosity nor love towards those brokerages.
[00:08:41] Jack Altman: Did you experience it that way?
[00:08:42] Jack Altman: Or is that maybe just I wasn't paying attention?
[00:08:44] Jack Altman: I think a lot of people lump the brokerages in the big banks
[00:08:48] Vlad Tenev: into one thing, one thing, one thing, one thing to one.
[00:08:50] Vlad Tenev: I think so.
[00:08:51] Vlad Tenev: Yeah, I mean, and not even those guys,
[00:08:53] Vlad Tenev: but you look at the market makers like Citadel.
[00:08:56] Vlad Tenev: For sure.
[00:08:57] Vlad Tenev: This during the GameStop era,
[00:08:59] Vlad Tenev: I mean, there's just an association that
[00:09:03] there's sort of like these puppet masters that are moving things around in the dark
[00:09:07] Vlad Tenev: and nobody understands.
[00:09:09] Vlad Tenev: And I think trust in general tends to be quite low.
[00:09:12] Vlad Tenev: Yeah.
[00:09:13] Vlad Tenev: Now, now that was at the time.
[00:09:15] Vlad Tenev: Now, I think Gen Z and Gen Alpha,
[00:09:18] Vlad Tenev: there's almost this opposite thing happening where
[00:09:22] Vlad Tenev: the old big storied incumbents are kind of cool again.
[00:09:27] Vlad Tenev: Interesting.
[00:09:27] Vlad Tenev: And so we're trying to figure out how to navigate this scenario.
[00:09:30] Vlad Tenev: What is that?
[00:09:30] Vlad Tenev: I didn't know.
[00:09:31] Jack Altman: Like Keisha more about that.
[00:09:32] Jack Altman: I think there's a broader trend of
[00:09:36] Vlad Tenev: things that are old and kind of,
[00:09:39] Vlad Tenev: maybe that your grandparents would use being cool again.
[00:09:42] Vlad Tenev: So Gen Zs are really into buying vinyl.
[00:09:45] Vlad Tenev: And cassette tapes are selling again.
[00:09:47] Vlad Tenev: I don't know.
[00:09:48] Vlad Tenev: 10 years ago, maybe it would have been very hard to get a cassette tape.
[00:09:50] Vlad Tenev: But now people are buying them.
[00:09:52] Vlad Tenev: And so, you know, my daughter asked me if she could have a walkman.
[00:09:56] Vlad Tenev: And I think in the same way,
[00:09:58] Vlad Tenev: financially, people are actually like the younger generation is interested in retirement.
[00:10:04] Vlad Tenev: You and I probably be close to the same age.
[00:10:07] Vlad Tenev: When I was graduating from college in 2008,
[00:10:12] Vlad Tenev: I wasn't really thinking about retirement that much.
[00:10:14] Vlad Tenev: Yeah, I was 2011 and saying.
[00:10:15] Jack Altman: Yeah.
[00:10:16] Jack Altman: Yeah.
[00:10:16] Jack Altman: Like retirement seemed really, really far away.
[00:10:20] Vlad Tenev: Now Gen Zs are opening retirement accounts at 19 years old.
[00:10:24] Vlad Tenev: So they're like, they're thinking a little bit more conservatively, I think, than prior generations.
[00:10:30] Vlad Tenev: I'm not a cultural historian, even though I try to be.
[00:10:34] Vlad Tenev: It's important context because I assume that for business like years,
[00:10:38] Jack Altman: I would think that capturing the sort of like,
[00:10:41] Jack Altman: hearts and minds of people between 18 and 30 must be super important for the long term.
[00:10:47] Jack Altman: Yeah. And there's a lot of counterintuitive things there.
[00:10:49] Vlad Tenev: For example, for older people, I think we've had a lot of success.
[00:10:56] Vlad Tenev: You would think with older customers, we would emphasize how stable and how long we've been around
[00:11:03] Vlad Tenev: and held these things.
[00:11:04] Vlad Tenev: But actually, that resonates very strongly with young people.
[00:11:07] Vlad Tenev: And older people, older people, you could be plugged into the cool new thing.
[00:11:11] Jack Altman: Yeah, it's innovative, easy to use.
[00:11:14] Vlad Tenev: We have all these features.
[00:11:16] Vlad Tenev: Is that new for you or was it this way for you all along?
[00:11:18] Jack Altman: I think it's relatively new for us.
[00:11:20] Jack Altman: If you had to invert those seven years ago or something?
[00:11:23] Jack Altman: Yeah, I think we have to constantly change the way we think about our products,
[00:11:29] Vlad Tenev: communicator products, what we build.
[00:11:33] Vlad Tenev: And I think the trap that we would like to avoid is to some degree,
[00:11:39] Vlad Tenev: these companies that came before us, Schwab, E-Trade,
[00:11:44] Vlad Tenev: they're kind of stuck in a generation.
[00:11:47] Vlad Tenev: E-Trade was very popular with Gen X.
[00:11:50] Vlad Tenev: Gen X broker, Schwab, average customers in their 60s, maybe 70s now.
[00:11:56] Vlad Tenev: So it's very much the broker of the boomer generation.
[00:12:01] Vlad Tenev: What we try very hard to do is always pay attention to the next generation.
[00:12:05] Vlad Tenev: While also moving up market in the sense of being able to serve older customers,
[00:12:11] Vlad Tenev: people that are in their 60s and 70s because they have needs and they also have a lot of assets
[00:12:16] Vlad Tenev: that we could benefit from.
[00:12:17] Vlad Tenev: So we've been trying to do both over the last 10 years with I think some success.
[00:12:24] Vlad Tenev: How do you think about, if at all,
[00:12:27] Jack Altman: index fund investing versus a more hands-on active style of trading?
[00:12:32] Jack Altman: And I'm asking because when I think about Vanguard or Schwab,
[00:12:35] Jack Altman: I think about it as pioneers of champions of the passive investment,
[00:12:40] Jack Altman: sort of mindset.
[00:12:41] Jack Altman: Absolutely. In my think of Robinhood, I think of like you can trade for free.
[00:12:44] Jack Altman: And so therefore you should trade.
[00:12:45] Jack Altman: Yeah.
[00:12:46] Jack Altman: Like how do you think of those things?
[00:12:47] Jack Altman: Does it matter?
[00:12:48] Jack Altman: Is it, you know, people should do both?
[00:12:49] Jack Altman: Do you strongly advocate for one or another for young people?
[00:12:53] Jack Altman: When I first started raising capital for Robinhood,
[00:12:58] Vlad Tenev: there was this perception that ETFs and index investing had kind of eaten the
[00:13:06] Vlad Tenev: active trading market and that there was no growth in trading and there was all this growth
[00:13:11] Vlad Tenev: in ETFs and that was just going to continue.
[00:13:13] Vlad Tenev: And young people wouldn't want to trade.
[00:13:15] Vlad Tenev: They just wanted to buy ETFs.
[00:13:17] Vlad Tenev: And I think that that's not exactly true.
[00:13:21] Vlad Tenev: And I think we've demonstrated that.
[00:13:24] Vlad Tenev: But it's not a graduation.
[00:13:26] Vlad Tenev: A lot of people ask, okay, well,
[00:13:28] Vlad Tenev: is do you first start out trading individual stocks and eventually graduate to
[00:13:34] buying and holding ETFs?
[00:13:36] Vlad Tenev: What we've seen is it's not that people go from being a trader to being an investor.
[00:13:43] Vlad Tenev: As their money grows, they just have more and more buckets, right?
[00:13:46] Vlad Tenev: They have your retirement, long term money, which for many people is passively managed.
[00:13:52] Vlad Tenev: But they always want to have a little bit at least that they're making decisions on.
[00:13:58] Vlad Tenev: Yeah.
[00:13:58] Vlad Tenev: And so we've tried to conform to that.
[00:14:00] Vlad Tenev: It used to be that there was only one account in Robinhood.
[00:14:03] Vlad Tenev: And I think one of the big unlocks for us in the past four years, I'd say,
[00:14:08] Vlad Tenev: is figuring out how to actually conform to people's mental accounting of their finances.
[00:14:13] Vlad Tenev: And now you can have over 10 accounts and many different account types.
[00:14:18] Vlad Tenev: Do you think of your role as just give people the tools to do whatever they think is best?
[00:14:23] Jack Altman: Or do you think of your role as we're going to help create certain sort of healthy
[00:14:30] Jack Altman: patterns and pathways for people to do the right thing at the right time?
[00:14:34] Jack Altman: Yeah. So at the top level, we are aligned.
[00:14:38] Vlad Tenev: Like we make money generally proportional to our total assets under custody.
[00:14:42] Vlad Tenev: Do you want your customers to do well?
[00:14:44] Jack Altman: We want our customers to do well.
[00:14:45] Vlad Tenev: We don't want them to send their accounts to zero.
[00:14:48] Vlad Tenev: The best behavior for us is if someone's account balance will
[00:14:51] Vlad Tenev: us just monotonically and continuously grows over time.
[00:14:55] Vlad Tenev: I think the best way to do that is to actually conform to how customers like to use financial
[00:15:02] Vlad Tenev: products. And this has pushed us to, we don't really think of ourselves as a trading app anymore.
[00:15:09] Vlad Tenev: The way to describe what we are and what we're increasingly becoming is a financial super app.
[00:15:16] Vlad Tenev: Like we want to be your primary and your secondary financial account.
[00:15:20] Vlad Tenev: So we have Robinhood banking, which is rolling out right now.
[00:15:24] Vlad Tenev: I think it's the best banking product on the market.
[00:15:26] Vlad Tenev: And if we serve customers well there, their direct deposit comes into Robinhood.
[00:15:32] Vlad Tenev: And then once we've got the direct deposit, it's sort of like our assets to lose.
[00:15:38] Vlad Tenev: And we look at all the ways in which customers take money off the platform.
[00:15:43] Vlad Tenev: We ask ourselves, is that something that should be happening on platform?
[00:15:47] Vlad Tenev: And I think that's what's pushed us into this multi-product line conglomerate.
[00:15:51] Vlad Tenev: It's like a financial conglomerate.
[00:15:54] Vlad Tenev: Across some of our businesses, we do have a fiduciary responsibility where the leaders of those
[00:15:59] Vlad Tenev: businesses, for example, Robinhood strategies, they spend day and night thinking about how they can
[00:16:04] Vlad Tenev: make as much money for you as possible. Other businesses are more about selection.
[00:16:09] Vlad Tenev: Like for example, prediction markets. What do customers want to trade?
[00:16:12] Vlad Tenev: How can we make sure we have the highest market share relative to our peers?
[00:16:17] Vlad Tenev: Yeah, actually this is a good moment to sort of transition to that.
[00:16:19] Jack Altman: Robinhood has like a crazy number of big businesses. I think the
[00:16:23] Jack Altman: Saturday was 11 businesses at over 100 million of revenue.
[00:16:27] Jack Altman: So could you just like talk about just at the high level, like what the portfolio of businesses are?
[00:16:32] Jack Altman: We organize it into kind of three arcs.
[00:16:35] Vlad Tenev: So one of those arcs is we call it number one in active traders.
[00:16:40] Vlad Tenev: So we want to be the place where if you're an active trader,
[00:16:45] Vlad Tenev: you would feel like you're at a disadvantage using any other platform.
[00:16:48] Vlad Tenev: And that's where you have our options business, our crypto trading businesses.
[00:16:52] Vlad Tenev: Robinhood legend, which is a new product that we have that's active traders on web.
[00:16:57] Vlad Tenev: I was talking you a little bit about how there needs to be like a cursor for web if that makes sense.
[00:17:03] Vlad Tenev: Like a AI driven active trading home for the people that are extremely sophisticated.
[00:17:09] Vlad Tenev: That's what Robinhood legend is. And that's where our prediction markets business is as well.
[00:17:15] Vlad Tenev: It's like, where are the things where we can track our market share?
[00:17:20] Vlad Tenev: We're for now sticking to regulated financial products.
[00:17:23] Vlad Tenev: So that's kind of the organizing principle.
[00:17:26] Vlad Tenev: And we look at our market share and we wanted to grow over time.
[00:17:30] Vlad Tenev: The second bucket is just we call it number one in wallet share.
[00:17:33] Vlad Tenev: All the things that lead to all of your finances being on Robinhood.
[00:17:37] Vlad Tenev: The credit card, a Robinhood gold program, which is kind of the subscription
[00:17:42] Vlad Tenev: wrapper that gives you a better deal on everything.
[00:17:46] Vlad Tenev: We have retirement, which is now 25 billion in assets.
[00:17:49] Vlad Tenev: We made some acquisitions there to trade PMR, which is you can actually get a human advisor,
[00:17:55] Vlad Tenev: which will eventually grow into hopefully your point person for your family office for those that
[00:18:00] Vlad Tenev: have one. But the end game there is how can we get all of your money in Robinhood and how can we
[00:18:05] Vlad Tenev: get everyone to be a gold subscriber so that you just get incredible value from everything.
[00:18:12] Vlad Tenev: Yeah.
[00:18:12] Vlad Tenev: And then the third bucket is we call it number one global financial ecosystem,
[00:18:17] Vlad Tenev: which is us growing our business across two linearly independent vectors.
[00:18:23] Vlad Tenev: One is from retail only to business and institutional.
[00:18:26] Vlad Tenev: The other is from US only or US primary to fully global.
[00:18:30] Vlad Tenev: And we think in 10 years, over half of our business can be XUS and cut another way over half
[00:18:37] Vlad Tenev: of our business can be non-retail. So I think there's multiple vectors by which we can grow at 10X
[00:18:43] Vlad Tenev: and we're trying to kind of go after all of them.
[00:18:47] Vlad Tenev: Can we talk about prediction markets a little bit? I think that's been like a very interesting
[00:18:52] Jack Altman: new category that has grown crazily. And obviously that's been like a big success for you.
[00:18:57] Jack Altman: Like what has made prediction markets take off in the way that they have, do you think?
[00:19:01] Vlad Tenev: This is a funny one because there's actually a very simple answer and it's just one thing.
[00:19:07] Vlad Tenev: The sort of like big bang of prediction markets was the presidential election last year.
[00:19:13] Vlad Tenev: In my opinion, you know, I've been kind of a student of prediction markets for many years.
[00:19:19] Vlad Tenev: I've just loved them. And I remember in 2016 with the presidential election, I was like
[00:19:28] Vlad Tenev: voraciously looking at the prediction markets trying to figure out who was going to win this thing.
[00:19:32] Vlad Tenev: And at that point, there was nothing in the US. It was basically Betfair, which is a UK-based
[00:19:40] Vlad Tenev: exchange that was pricing the odds in real time. And you know, you could tell you're watching
[00:19:47] Vlad Tenev: the news. They didn't have an answer on that election until the next morning when Clinton
[00:19:54] Vlad Tenev: conceded that 7 p.m. 730 Pacific at night. Betfair showed, you know, Donald Trump had a 95% chance
[00:20:02] Vlad Tenev: of winning. So that was I think the first instance where you could tell that this was a valuable new
[00:20:08] Vlad Tenev: forecasting tool and source of information. And then in 2020, it was the same thing.
[00:20:14] Vlad Tenev: Predict it was probably the main platform, which was run as a research experiment.
[00:20:20] Vlad Tenev: But I remember everyone, they had this nice electoral map. They had prediction markets, not just
[00:20:26] Vlad Tenev: for the election as a whole, but for each state. And their website crashed from so much use on
[00:20:33] Vlad Tenev: election night. And for the longest time, having prediction markets for the US elections were
[00:20:40] Vlad Tenev: impermissible. Like the CFTC said, no. And then there was a Supreme Court case that got resolved
[00:20:47] Vlad Tenev: literally a month before the election last year. That's actually it's okay. You can roll out
[00:20:54] Vlad Tenev: federally regulated CFTC presidential election markets. And that surprised everyone. Like,
[00:21:00] Vlad Tenev: nobody thought that this result would shake out this way. So credit to Calche for actually
[00:21:06] Vlad Tenev: taking on that fight and going to the Supreme Court and arguing for their business. When we saw
[00:21:12] Vlad Tenev: that, we basically mobilized our entire company. And we're like, we have two weeks to get this ready.
[00:21:18] Vlad Tenev: We've got to be ready for for the presidential election. And that week, we were actually,
[00:21:25] Vlad Tenev: it was it was very high degree of difficulty because we began integrating with Calche for that.
[00:21:32] Vlad Tenev: And then Calche didn't get the approval to allow other brokers to connect. So we integrated
[00:21:39] Vlad Tenev: with forecast X, which is which is another DCM. But our team sprinted towards this thing. Then we
[00:21:45] Vlad Tenev: had to change vendors. So we had to sprint again. And we shipped it with about a week before,
[00:21:50] Vlad Tenev: a week to go before the presidential election. And we still saw, I think over half a billion
[00:21:56] Vlad Tenev: contracts traded, which is a big business for us. And then what happened was essentially the same
[00:22:04] Vlad Tenev: argument that you could make for why the presidential election has a lot of economic value
[00:22:12] Vlad Tenev: could be adapted to the Super Bowl, like a big sporting event. Clearly a Super Bowl,
[00:22:18] Vlad Tenev: a huge event, lots of economic value. And then you could imagine, you know, if the Super Bowl has
[00:22:25] Vlad Tenev: economic value, every football game has economic value as well. Because the Super Bowl is just a
[00:22:30] Vlad Tenev: function of what happens the rest of the season. And it allows you to make those trades more granularly.
[00:22:36] Vlad Tenev: And that has essentially unlocked the sports prediction markets industry, which has been a big thing.
[00:22:42] Vlad Tenev: Which is enormous, right? Yeah. And if you look at it, it's a disruptive force to traditional sports
[00:22:49] Vlad Tenev: betting because sports betting is state by state regulated. It's a patchwork. Taxes are quite high.
[00:22:56] Vlad Tenev: Mm-hmm. You have this annoying effect where, you know, if you're using one of these sports betting
[00:23:01] Vlad Tenev: apps in New York, you get shut out. And you have to drive across the bridge to New Jersey. And maybe
[00:23:08] Vlad Tenev: there you have different products and services. Brick and Mordor, rules intended for brick and
[00:23:13] Vlad Tenev: mortar casinos have been applied to digital platforms, which I think makes a little bit less sense
[00:23:22] Vlad Tenev: in this case. So it's been a disruptive force. And for Robinhood, if you look on a contract's
[00:23:28] Vlad Tenev: traded basis, it's been doubling quarter after quarter. And in October, which is just one month,
[00:23:37] Vlad Tenev: we did more than all of Q3 put together. And I think that's a function of more contracts.
[00:23:43] Vlad Tenev: Not just in sports, but diversity across the board. Like we have really interesting AI
[00:23:48] Vlad Tenev: contracts, too, where you can trade what's going to be the best AI model at the end of the year,
[00:23:52] Vlad Tenev: what's going to be the AI coding model that wins. It's just more people finding out about it,
[00:23:58] Vlad Tenev: figuring out what prediction markets are. So it's getting more adoption within our user base.
[00:24:02] Vlad Tenev: We're also getting new customers coming in. But yeah, I think at least definitely on the retail
[00:24:09] Vlad Tenev: side, or kind of the only broker that offers prediction markets to a significant degree right now.
[00:24:14] Vlad Tenev: One of the things I'm very proud of is how quickly we like jumped on it. I mean, there's
[00:24:19] Vlad Tenev: some of our competitors have been integrating and trying to do this for years. And they still
[00:24:24] Vlad Tenev: haven't shipped. I think it's not just a trading product. This is a unique one where there's actually
[00:24:30] Vlad Tenev: a huge use case almost as a media forecasting tool. I did like a tweet storm about this a couple
[00:24:37] Vlad Tenev: months ago. I said prediction markets a way to think about them is their truth machines.
[00:24:42] Vlad Tenev: Like we're bombarded by all this information constantly. Like anyone can write anything on Twitter.
[00:24:48] Vlad Tenev: It can go viral. How do you sift through what's real and what's not and what's actually going to
[00:24:55] Vlad Tenev: happen? Well, now we've created a tool that lets you do that. And I think the benefit is not just
[00:25:00] Vlad Tenev: for the folks that are trading. It's almost like the trading and speculating is doing the work.
[00:25:05] Vlad Tenev: So that all of us have this reliable source of information. I should have looked this up
[00:25:09] Jack Altman: before I came here, but I feel like I remember seeing that like if you ask a million people to
[00:25:13] Jack Altman: guess the weight of a cow or something ridiculous like that. Yeah, it's actually very like the
[00:25:19] Jack Altman: middle is actually very close. And I feel like that is basically what prediction markets are doing
[00:25:23] Jack Altman: right is like the wisdom of crowds betting with like skin in the game leads to truth. Yeah,
[00:25:28] Jack Altman: I think the skin in the game is the big yeah distinguishing feature rather than just a poll.
[00:25:34] Vlad Tenev: I mean, you can run a poll. Yeah, it's different because it's a price. This is a price.
[00:25:39] Vlad Tenev: It's not a poll. It's not a guess. It's from people with real skin in the game. And I think that's
[00:25:44] Vlad Tenev: there's empirical evidence that they're super accurate even one month before the event in question.
[00:25:49] Vlad Tenev: To what extent do you think of prediction markets as like economic value via this like truthy
[00:25:57] Jack Altman: sort of outcome from the wisdom of crowds with skin in the game versus just like a
[00:26:02] Jack Altman: cool form of entertainment for people. Yeah, we get asked this all the time. And that is
[00:26:06] Vlad Tenev: that by the way, I love poker, for example. Yeah, isn't it just gambling, but the thing is
[00:26:11] every tradable asset has had that criticism over time. Right, futures contracts where people have
[00:26:19] Vlad Tenev: been speculating over the price of oil or the price of gold. I mean, this was a huge fight back in
[00:26:27] Vlad Tenev: the I think 60s where a lot of people are on both sides saying, you know, retail shouldn't have
[00:26:32] Vlad Tenev: access to these products because it's just speculation. But I think yeah, another word for gambling
[00:26:38] Vlad Tenev: is speculation, right? Well, but also I mean, there's nothing wrong with gambling really. I mean,
[00:26:42] Vlad Tenev: like put aside that and I agree. Without speculation, you can't have a functional financial market.
[00:26:51] Vlad Tenev: So we need the speculators. Otherwise, things just don't work. You need people that have a view
[00:26:57] Vlad Tenev: on what's going to happen in the future to create the market. And I think most people would agree
[00:27:02] Vlad Tenev: we need the market. But that said, well, I don't think everyone should be speculating with 100%
[00:27:07] Vlad Tenev: of their money. That's an extreme case. I'm just thinking out loud here for fun. But like I
[00:27:11] Jack Altman: suppose maybe the counter there would be it's useful to get price discovery on like like an equity
[00:27:18] Jack Altman: asset or something like that. But there's not particular value to getting price discovery on the
[00:27:23] Jack Altman: outcome of the Ravens game or something. I imagine there'd be some counter like that. Yeah. But
[00:27:28] Vlad Tenev: it's definitely the case that that has value because any forecast has value. The politics is a good
[00:27:33] Vlad Tenev: example. There's obviously value. Well, just think about how much money is there in informing people
[00:27:40] Vlad Tenev: and like commenting on what's going to happen to that Ravens game. Totally. People buy the newspaper
[00:27:46] Vlad Tenev: to read the sports section and see the commentary. You're listening to sports center. And I think
[00:27:51] Vlad Tenev: that's just going to become a bigger and bigger part of the economy. Like let's say we get to this
[00:27:58] Vlad Tenev: future where AI is automating more and more jobs, right? One of the things that probably will be
[00:28:04] Vlad Tenev: difficult to automate is entertainment and sports with real humans. So I would make a bet actually
[00:28:11] Vlad Tenev: that this just continues to grow. And you know, the lion's share of jobs and job families that
[00:28:19] Vlad Tenev: we consider in the future probably look to us like some form of entertainment today.
[00:28:25] Vlad Tenev: Totally. One of the things that I asked Dylan Field about on the podcast the other week that
[00:28:30] Jack Altman: I think maybe kind of relates to prediction markets. It kind of relates to some of the other things
[00:28:33] Jack Altman: we've been talking about is I have this sense that I think to some degree with you know, today's
[00:28:41] Jack Altman: young people, but I think it's actually with all of us there's there is some growing degree of like
[00:28:46] Jack Altman: a financial sort of aggression or like you might like the negative way to say it might be gambling
[00:28:53] Jack Altman: as a positive way to say it might be risk taking. Yeah. I think it shows up in a lot of ways like
[00:28:58] Jack Altman: obviously prediction markets are easy and to point to also gave the example when I was talking to
[00:29:02] Jack Altman: Dylan about like collectible cards kind of you know that and like NFTs and you have these like
[00:29:07] Jack Altman: small things that people start speculating on like crazy. I think a lot of behaviors that people
[00:29:12] Jack Altman: have just in general have gone sort of the way of like a lot more like risk I would say. And I
[00:29:20] Jack Altman: don't think that's a bad thing, but to me it seems like a thing. And I'm just curious if it's
[00:29:24] Jack Altman: something that you've noticed if something you've thought about it at all how you think Robinhood
[00:29:28] Jack Altman: you know, sweet of products can you know channel that in positive ways. I don't know, I'm just
[00:29:34] Jack Altman: curious anything about it. Yeah. I actually think that it's not a huge fundamental change in
[00:29:41] Vlad Tenev: people's mindset, but more what they have access to. So for example, it used to be very difficult
[00:29:49] Vlad Tenev: and cost prohibitive to invest in individual stocks. I think there's a big reason why
[00:29:55] Vlad Tenev: why ETFs had extreme product market fit because before ETF came along if you want to be invested in
[00:30:03] Vlad Tenev: 500 companies, you're not going to buy 500 individual stocks. You could get that diversification
[00:30:10] Vlad Tenev: quite simply and easily. We're on a trajectory where people want more granular ways to express
[00:30:16] Vlad Tenev: their opinion about things. So one example I can give you is how many times have you seen a company
[00:30:23] Vlad Tenev: just blow out their earnings estimates like they blew out EPS, they blew out revenue, but the stock
[00:30:33] Vlad Tenev: goes down. And folks get frustrated because they're like I'm a student of this company, I figured out
[00:30:39] Vlad Tenev: you know, I have a pretty good model of how well they're going to do, but the stock might not always
[00:30:43] Vlad Tenev: be a perfect representation of that. So you know, then you have prediction markets for EPS and
[00:30:50] Vlad Tenev: revenue where if you have a point of view of how something's going to shake out, you can actually
[00:30:54] Vlad Tenev: trade that more directly. Options trading, I think, is part of this trend too, where maybe you do
[00:31:01] Vlad Tenev: want to hold a company for a very long time, but you have a view that it's going to do well this
[00:31:06] Vlad Tenev: quarter. So you can design a contract and trade it profitably based on that viewpoint. Then you
[00:31:13] Vlad Tenev: have you know, zero day contracts, which take that to the extreme, which is I have a pretty good
[00:31:19] Vlad Tenev: idea of how something's going to do today. And maybe it's an earnings day and you don't want to
[00:31:23] Vlad Tenev: take the time decay risk. So I think in general, even though to some degree, these are called more
[00:31:30] Vlad Tenev: complex products, there's a certain simplicity in that so many things drive the value of a stock,
[00:31:38] Vlad Tenev: but like these contracts let you express a more granular point of view. And I think the other
[00:31:43] Vlad Tenev: thing is they just weren't available easily. You would have had to be very, very sophisticated,
[00:31:48] Vlad Tenev: have unique access to have them in the past. And now, you know, through tools like Robinhood,
[00:31:54] Vlad Tenev: we make them available to traders with costs that are really low. And then I think the third
[00:32:00] Vlad Tenev: thing is you hear a lot about it in the news, predominantly because it's more interesting than like
[00:32:06] Vlad Tenev: buy and hold passive investing. Like everyone wants to write about options trading in prediction
[00:32:11] Vlad Tenev: markets and crypto, because it's speculative. You have big swings. Nobody's interested in writing
[00:32:17] Vlad Tenev: the story about how, you know, index funds are gaining AUM or money market funds are seeing
[00:32:21] Vlad Tenev: huge inflows. Even though that's also happening. So I think it's the combination of these three
[00:32:28] Vlad Tenev: things that makes it seem like there's a huge increase in speculation. Yeah, but I think on a
[00:32:33] Vlad Tenev: relative basis, the story is much more tempered. I mean, it's probably also true what you're saying
[00:32:37] Jack Altman: were like, if in the year 1950, you gave people, you know, a smart phone with an app that let them
[00:32:43] Jack Altman: bet on the baseball game they're watching. A lot of people would have bet. And so I think the
[00:32:46] Jack Altman: tooling probably is just expressing, you know, like human interest to do various things. I guess,
[00:32:52] Jack Altman: you know, if they respect, there was always been speculation, you look back, Isaac Newton,
[00:32:56] Jack Altman: there's just been a lot of friction in the past though. Yes. Like the, like the EPS example is
[00:33:00] Jack Altman: really good, because I think a lot of times people are like, you work really hard to, you know,
[00:33:05] Jack Altman: take a certain view on a company and you have confidence in it. And then you bet on a proxy,
[00:33:10] Jack Altman: which is like share price goes up. Yeah. It's a good, it's a good example. Totally. There was a trend
[00:33:15] Jack Altman: over time that I do think is like harder for young people as it does seem like it is um,
[00:33:21] Jack Altman: like compared to, and maybe this is sort of like a not truthful nostalgia, but I think like,
[00:33:28] Jack Altman: it probably seems to be the case that like our parents generation had an easier time like
[00:33:32] Jack Altman: buying a first home than today's like recent college grad or something like that. So I do wonder if
[00:33:37] Jack Altman: there is like a long term trend that does make it harder to like get on the financial ramp
[00:33:43] Jack Altman: for people out of school of others to do with, you know, home prices going up on a relative
[00:33:47] Jack Altman: basis or something to do with, you know, inflation or, or I don't know what else, but it does seem like
[00:33:53] Jack Altman: there is a long term directional trend where it's harder for young people to like get into the
[00:33:59] Jack Altman: place and their financial life that they want to get to at a young age. I think that's true. I think
[00:34:03] Vlad Tenev: the social safety net has kind of frayed a little bit. I mean, you have the home ownership
[00:34:09] Vlad Tenev: becoming a little bit more difficult, a lot more difficult in the Bay Area perhaps. Yeah. You also
[00:34:15] Vlad Tenev: have the student loan burden, which is like a disaster. Yeah, the cost of education has just
[00:34:23] Vlad Tenev: continued to inflect. Yes, I mean, I went to Stanford and when I was there, the tuition plus
[00:34:29] Vlad Tenev: room and board was like 50, 40 to 50, right? And now I think it's like 80 to 90, which is insane.
[00:34:36] Vlad Tenev: And state schools have kind of encroached upon the 40 to 50 level for in-state tuition in some
[00:34:43] Vlad Tenev: cases. So yeah, I think I think there's a lot of problems. Probably like a lot of these like
[00:34:48] Jack Altman: sort of like common goods have just gotten hard to get. There's a lot of there's a lot of that.
[00:34:54] Vlad Tenev: That's a huge problem for sure. I would think that would be a big opportunity for you though to
[00:34:57] Jack Altman: engage with people young and find some way to sort of give you know products that can help them
[00:35:03] Jack Altman: get there. Well, you know what's gone the other way trading commissions. Yeah. In our generation,
[00:35:09] Vlad Tenev: trading commissions were like $100 per trade when I was born and now there's zero. So when you
[00:35:15] Vlad Tenev: hitch it on to the technology wagon, yeah, I think things get taken to zero pretty quickly.
[00:35:20] Vlad Tenev: Another thing along these lines I'm really interested in is now as a I suppose as a venture capitalist,
[00:35:26] Jack Altman: you know, a lot of value gets created in private markets. And I think as companies, I mean,
[00:35:31] Jack Altman: you're public, but a lot of you know, peer companies that are of similar scale or private and
[00:35:36] Jack Altman: a lot of value compounds in private markets. And I think that's becoming more true every year.
[00:35:42] Jack Altman: And so maybe you know, this touches on like the tokenization of everything type of idea,
[00:35:46] Jack Altman: where like one way that you could help you know, bridge some of these gaps would be to like give
[00:35:51] Jack Altman: people access to some of these hard to access, you know, equities. Yeah. I mean, this is something that
[00:35:57] Vlad Tenev: I'm personally very passionate about. I think that it's one of the biggest inequities in capital
[00:36:03] Vlad Tenev: markets. It wasn't too long ago. I mean, a few years before we were born, Microsoft then Apple
[00:36:10] Vlad Tenev: went public at valuations and hundreds of millions, right? Or maybe low single digit billions.
[00:36:16] Vlad Tenev: And then like 99.9% of their value, you know, it's created in the public markets. Yeah. And you
[00:36:21] Vlad Tenev: still see examples of that right now, you're seeing a lot of companies that are worth hundreds of
[00:36:26] Vlad Tenev: billions. Right. At the frontier of their industries, you know, not just open AI and a
[00:36:31] Vlad Tenev: topic, but also SpaceX, which is leading the space revolution. Yeah. But before they're available
[00:36:37] Vlad Tenev: to retail, it's it's not hard to imagine that they're going to be in the trillions, right?
[00:36:42] Vlad Tenev: And then what kind of appreciation to get a Microsoft IPO till now appreciation, they're going
[00:36:48] Vlad Tenev: to have to get to a quadrillion of value. It's tough. It's going to be tough. It's like
[00:36:54] Vlad Tenev: with hyperinflation. Right. So yeah, I'm very motivated. I think XUS, we've we're pushing on
[00:37:02] Vlad Tenev: tokenization, which I think is probably something like the end state. A lot of people have to get
[00:37:08] Vlad Tenev: comfortable with the implications of it. And it's it's really going to be disruptive. Can you explain
[00:37:13] Vlad Tenev: how it would work? It works at the fundamental level. It's it's basically the same idea as what
[00:37:18] Vlad Tenev: stablecoins are. You have some traditional financial stuff that you put in a bucket. And, you know,
[00:37:26] Vlad Tenev: it's stable coins. It's US dollars and treasury notes and bonds. And you mint and burn tokens
[00:37:33] Vlad Tenev: against that. The traditional stuff stays in the bucket. And the tokens are freely tradable on
[00:37:39] Vlad Tenev: blockchains. So you can imagine 24 seven liquid trading around the clock just like a stock.
[00:37:46] Vlad Tenev: And the only time tokens change hands with shares is in like a mint and burn scenario. So
[00:37:54] Vlad Tenev: another analog is you imagine it's kind of like an ETF or an ADR. You have a bunch of stuff here.
[00:38:01] Vlad Tenev: S&P 500 ETF warehouses. The underlying stocks. The ETF is traded freely. And then at some point
[00:38:10] Vlad Tenev: very rarely you have a mechanism that exchanges the underlying for for the ETF, which is more of
[00:38:17] Vlad Tenev: an institutional product. But yeah, you can extend this concept with blockchain technology to anything.
[00:38:23] Vlad Tenev: So you can put private stocks or SPV LP interests in the bucket. Do you think that's where things go
[00:38:30] Jack Altman: in the US over time? I think so. Yeah. I think that it's it's really hard to imagine a cleaner
[00:38:38] Vlad Tenev: solution. I think a lot of people talk about on chain issuance. I don't think the end user gives a
[00:38:43] Vlad Tenev: shit about on chain issuance or really any of this. The end user just wants economic exposure to
[00:38:49] Vlad Tenev: things in a way that works. And I think some mechanism of this and there's a lot of questions to
[00:38:56] Vlad Tenev: be answered. So currently in Europe, the structure is a derivative. But this is more of like a paperwork
[00:39:05] Vlad Tenev: thing. The underlying mechanism could stay the same. And the regulatory description of it and what
[00:39:12] Vlad Tenev: it is and whether you get ownership or voting rights, that could all change. So I think there's
[00:39:17] Vlad Tenev: going to be questions of is it a derivative? Is it a tokenized stock? Is it a new thing?
[00:39:22] Vlad Tenev: Do you get to vote your shares? But we'll be able to make it at least as good as from an experience
[00:39:29] Vlad Tenev: standpoint as the existing things that are out there. Obviously everybody talks about like AI.
[00:39:35] Jack Altman: Now I'm curious how much of an impact it has been for you to date and where you think it's going
[00:39:41] Jack Altman: to be the most impact in the future. A lot of people speak about this in generalities, don't they?
[00:39:46] Vlad Tenev: I think that well, if you just speak in generalities, then everybody just, you know, make, you know,
[00:39:49] Jack Altman: yeah, yeah. You go up to say, it's good. Yeah, I like to measure things. I think we're very,
[00:39:57] Vlad Tenev: yeah, we we pick the areas kind of internally that we thought AI would make the biggest difference
[00:40:03] Vlad Tenev: for us. And then we spend a lot of time trying to we continually spend time thinking about how to
[00:40:09] Vlad Tenev: measure it and how the progress should go. Did you have any guesses that you thought would matter
[00:40:13] Jack Altman: and it didn't? And then were there any where, you know, you were surprised in the other direction?
[00:40:17] The two areas where we really invested big time in or customer support and engineering,
[00:40:23] Vlad Tenev: which I think were the two most, if you had to think about where human capital really matters,
[00:40:29] Vlad Tenev: writing code determines how fast we ship products and fix bugs and improve infrastructure.
[00:40:34] Vlad Tenev: Customer supports like the frontline interface with our system. Yeah, I think outside of chat,
[00:40:39] Jack Altman: those are probably like the biggest two AM or could so far, so that makes sense. Yeah. And so
[00:40:43] Vlad Tenev: customer support we measure AI deflection. It works super well. And with deflection rate, which
[00:40:51] Vlad Tenev: you probably can can understand, but I don't know if most viewers would you kind of look at
[00:40:59] Vlad Tenev: it's a measurement of what ticket would have gone to a human, but instead has been fully solved by
[00:41:04] Vlad Tenev: by AI. Would you get to? I don't know if we've announced that publicly. That's something good.
[00:41:11] Vlad Tenev: It's relatively it's very high. I think it's the best in the industry actually. And we do all
[00:41:16] Vlad Tenev: this work in house. We don't use vendors. Have you measured if it doesn't just, you know,
[00:41:20] Jack Altman: save costs by, you know, not just human, but have you measured if there's also higher satisfaction
[00:41:25] Jack Altman: on the way the ticket was handled? Like is it both a better experience and cheaper? We do measure
[00:41:29] Jack Altman: that. And I think the story is complex. And the reason is there's some percentage of people,
[00:41:35] Vlad Tenev: called 10 to 15% that just don't like talking to an AI agent. They have, you know, predisposition
[00:41:43] Vlad Tenev: to not like that. We actually track that number and that's going down over time too, which is very
[00:41:48] Vlad Tenev: good. And then we have to do all this work to make the agent try to convince them, right? It says,
[00:41:53] Vlad Tenev: actually, I'm very helpful. Give me a try, you know, the weight might be quite long.
[00:41:57] Vlad Tenev: Should have been. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Yeah. It's getting better and better. And there was
[00:42:00] Vlad Tenev: an incident a couple of weeks ago where our AI customer support agents actually went offline
[00:42:06] Vlad Tenev: for a few hours. Immediately the phone started ringing like crazy. So then we have, we have
[00:42:12] Vlad Tenev: clear direct evidence that the deflections are actually real. We haven't talked much publicly
[00:42:17] Vlad Tenev: about progress there, but we're doing an AI event in a couple of weeks. And I think that one
[00:42:21] Vlad Tenev: will be good. And then engineering, we look at obviously a number of lines of code that are
[00:42:28] Vlad Tenev: contributed by AI. And we also look at overall, like commits per engineer per month. And both
[00:42:38] Vlad Tenev: basically have been going up into the right. And I think for those areas, those are probably the
[00:42:44] Vlad Tenev: important things to track if you're an entrepreneur. Like if you're looking for metrics. And I think
[00:42:48] Vlad Tenev: they're controversial because the engineers will say, oh, I thought about the lines of codes,
[00:42:52] Jack Altman: about the quality of each line. And you're like, yeah, yeah, exactly. But let's look at the data.
[00:42:58] Vlad Tenev: Of course. Yeah. Investing more deeply, right? I remember we found that it was not just we did
[00:43:04] Jack Altman: like a sort of like a core sampling on this. We found that engineers who contributed more lines of
[00:43:08] Jack Altman: code also contributed higher quality per line of code. We've seen the same thing. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:43:12] Jack Altman: Yeah. The two aren't as contradictory as you might think. And then I think the next one is just
[00:43:19] Vlad Tenev: marketing and creative output. You should measure the total throughput of marketing creative
[00:43:25] Vlad Tenev: and also like the lion's share of that should be generated by AI. I think the tools at this point
[00:43:31] Vlad Tenev: are good enough to where you can actually move the needle on big way.
[00:43:35] Vlad Tenev: I feel like the cursor idea you mentioned should be very interesting. If at some point you get to a
[00:43:39] Jack Altman: place where you like sort of trust Robinhood enough to just sort of tell it, here's what I'm
[00:43:44] Jack Altman: looking for both in the short term and the long term. Here's my risk appetite. Here's the
[00:43:48] Jack Altman: products I want. Just like go make it all happen. We call it vibe trading. So you know, there's
[00:43:53] Vlad Tenev: vibe coding. I think there will be vibe trading, which sounds a little flippant. Well, but you know,
[00:43:58] Vlad Tenev: the thing you said that we're not a trading platform. It's like, you know, it's like a financial
[00:44:01] Jack Altman: home. It's like vibe finances. It's like, you know, because you have all these other products,
[00:44:05] Jack Altman: I assume it's going to, you know, like vibes that my, you know, kids 529 account, which is, you know,
[00:44:10] Jack Altman: not totally. Yeah. Here's the areas that I'm most interested in. So I think vibe trading and going
[00:44:16] Vlad Tenev: down that path of helping first active traders, but eventually seeping in a more general use cases
[00:44:24] Vlad Tenev: with indicator analysis. Right now these guys are writing code in languages that you and I have never
[00:44:30] Vlad Tenev: heard of to write these custom indicators and different scanners. So we can turn that to English.
[00:44:37] Vlad Tenev: And we announced that through our Robinhood Cortex for Legend product at our active trader event
[00:44:43] Vlad Tenev: a few, a few weeks ago. We have stock digest and crypto digest in app, which actually are really
[00:44:50] Vlad Tenev: cool, like incredible feedback from users so far. Basically, the way it works is you get a
[00:44:55] Vlad Tenev: notification saying some stock or crypto is up 5%. You immediately want to find out what's going on.
[00:45:03] Vlad Tenev: And so we actually give you a digest in the product that explains and it's up, it's accurate up to
[00:45:09] Vlad Tenev: seconds or low single digit minutes. And that's been really good. So you could imagine AI
[00:45:17] Vlad Tenev: unobtrusively being this like assistant and some in some cases autonomous financial agent for
[00:45:24] Vlad Tenev: many of these things. I also think that there's just some really, really boring stuff that's very
[00:45:30] Vlad Tenev: hard right now that we're going to push to fully automate. So moving your bank account.
[00:45:37] Vlad Tenev: I don't know if you've ever moved a bank account, but it's a pain in the blood. You have all sorts
[00:45:42] Vlad Tenev: of bills that are hooked into it, all sorts of subscriptions. Totally. And I think at some point,
[00:45:47] Vlad Tenev: you'll just press a button and that bank account will move. And the first companies that figure out
[00:45:52] Vlad Tenev: how to do this are going to have a pretty big advantage because like it's considered a very sticky
[00:45:58] Vlad Tenev: thing precisely for this reason. Nobody wants to go to the effort of changing their credit card number
[00:46:04] Vlad Tenev: or their ACH information for 20 to 30 different things. Yeah, you don't even know what you forgot.
[00:46:10] Vlad Tenev: Yeah, you don't want to even think about it. And yeah, that's just that's why it doesn't happen.
[00:46:16] Vlad Tenev: I think if we can, if it becomes a button, I think it's headed there, right? Then it's going to be
[00:46:23] Vlad Tenev: very disruptive to a lot of incumbent firms. Moving brokerage accounts. Same idea, very complicated.
[00:46:30] Vlad Tenev: They don't want to make it easy either. Like your counterparties are not interested in having like
[00:46:34] Vlad Tenev: a streamlined integration. Totally, but I guess an agent that read all of your documents from the old
[00:46:40] Jack Altman: brokerage could figure out everything that you need to know, I suppose. Yeah, yeah, it could be like,
[00:46:46] Vlad Tenev: you know, if you have a person doing this on your behalf and they make the calls, they talk to
[00:46:50] Vlad Tenev: customer support, they have access to your emails. Yeah, but there's no reason why an AI agent
[00:46:57] Vlad Tenev: won't be able to do all of that work for you. Yeah, maybe just to finish up, I guess you've
[00:47:02] Jack Altman: been doing this for over 10 years now. And obviously, you know, over $100,000 public company, but you
[00:47:08] Jack Altman: still have, I know like an intensity of drive like to keep going. So I guess one thing I'm curious
[00:47:15] Jack Altman: about is where have you found the sort of drive to stay hardcore detail focus like, you know, founder
[00:47:22] Jack Altman: through like, you know, both a lot of years, but also it's like you've gotten to a like a level of
[00:47:26] Jack Altman: success where it would be easy to not bite so hard, but obviously you're pushing the boundary on
[00:47:30] Jack Altman: so many things at once. I think that the one amazing thing that you have as a founder of a company
[00:47:38] Vlad Tenev: that I don't think is as easy if you're an employee or even a senior executive is ultimately,
[00:47:44] Vlad Tenev: you have a lot of control, right? So if there's something about your company that doesn't work well
[00:47:52] Vlad Tenev: or that you don't like or you find yourself having to say things to the employees that you don't
[00:47:58] Vlad Tenev: agree with, I think that's a good opportunity to reset and to change something. You either have to
[00:48:05] Vlad Tenev: change something about yourself or about your policies or what you're saying. I think I learned
[00:48:11] Vlad Tenev: this during COVID, which was a hard time for us for many reasons, but also for me personally,
[00:48:17] Vlad Tenev: was some of the folks in the company maybe also like the press and what you're hearing from the
[00:48:23] Vlad Tenev: internet pushed me into the directions where I was just like saying things that I didn't really
[00:48:28] Vlad Tenev: believe in. Like, oh, we really care about having the best health and wellness benefits so that our
[00:48:34] Vlad Tenev: employees can feel good and you can bring your whole self to work. And I noticed that I was saying
[00:48:41] Vlad Tenev: things that I didn't really believe in. And I think that's the source of ultimately a lot of
[00:48:46] Vlad Tenev: unhappiness. And at the end of the day as a founder, I think the company values have to be your values.
[00:48:53] Vlad Tenev: The way you run the company has to be the way you run your life to some degree. And I became
[00:48:59] Vlad Tenev: unhappy when there was a disconnect. And then I figured out, okay, actually, this is why I'm unhappy.
[00:49:05] Vlad Tenev: I have to fix it. And the good thing was you have the power to fix it because you're,
[00:49:10] Vlad Tenev: if you're lucky enough to still be running your company as a founder, then the buck stops with you
[00:49:15] Vlad Tenev: for better and for worse. And I'm sure you've gotten much more confident to like,
[00:49:19] Jack Altman: call it like you see it and make changes as time's gone on and you have more years doing it and
[00:49:23] Jack Altman: everything too. Yeah, for sure. And I think I have to obviously we're doing very well right now.
[00:49:29] Vlad Tenev: There were times where we were doing quite poorly in the eyes of other people. And I've been through
[00:49:35] Vlad Tenev: maybe like two or three of these cycles. So I know there's probably going to be some time in the
[00:49:39] Vlad Tenev: future where there's shit heads again. Do you do anything in the good times to like bank any of the
[00:49:44] Jack Altman: like good vibes or any of the just like sentiment? Like can you bank any of it for the hard times?
[00:49:50] Jack Altman: Is it all you can do? Just know it's going to not always be good. Good question.
[00:49:54] Vlad Tenev: I try to go on more podcasts. Yeah, maybe most people don't want to talk to me right when we're
[00:50:00] Vlad Tenev: when we've done something bad. I do want with you in the next bad situation. We can run it back.
[00:50:04] Jack Altman: We're glad this was super fun. Thanks a bunch for doing this to me. I really enjoyed it. Yeah, like wise.
