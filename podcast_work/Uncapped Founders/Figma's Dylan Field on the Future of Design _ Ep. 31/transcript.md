[00:00:00] We're gonna get to a world where we're already kind of there where good enough is not enough
[00:00:06] Unknown (Host): Good enough is gonna be mediocre
[00:00:08] Unknown (Host): And you're gonna need to differentiate through design through craft three point of view through brand through storytelling
[00:00:15] Unknown (Host): And marketing and I think the people that internalize that now they're gonna be winners. Yep. That's my
[00:00:22] Unknown (Host): Point of view is that this is what's gonna matter stuff the top the stack and if you don't internalize it now like you got an issue
[00:00:30] Dylan it's pleasure to have you here thanks for doing this Jack. Thank you. Okay. I want to start by teeing up a
[00:00:39] Dylan Field: Contrast between figma in the early days, which was like a multi-year long build before you kind of got things going and
[00:00:47] Dylan Field: Then the state of the world today where like AI startups are
[00:00:51] Dylan Field: Racing out of the gates and there's tons of competition and everything's frenetic 13 years in
[00:00:57] Dylan Field: 13 years and it's a little different now, isn't it? Yeah, so you started in 2012
[00:01:02] Dylan Field: Mm-hmm August 2012 was where official start and then you got really kind of off to the races went like four or five years later
[00:01:08] Dylan Field: Close beta was launched to summer 2015
[00:01:12] GA October 2016 didn't start charging till summer 2017 geez same days are CFO now CFO started fun fact
[00:01:19] Unknown (Host): CFO started the day you started charging. Yeah, he was like a bizarre guy then. Yeah, now you see a phone
[00:01:24] Unknown (Host): Okay, so you had this five-year period and I guess when you look back at it
[00:01:29] Dylan Field: You could you could either sort of I imagine feel like that was a little too long
[00:01:34] Dylan Field: We should have really do a lot of your watching don't do that
[00:01:37] Unknown (Host): But on the other hand you built some hard stuff like you put like you know and a design product in the browser when people had never done it
[00:01:45] Dylan Field: You'd made like collaboration which you don't I've read is very was a very difficult task and that had advantages too
[00:01:52] Dylan Field: So how do you sort of make sense looking back now in sort of the fullness of time on that five-year period?
[00:01:57] Dylan Field: Yeah, I think definitely there were ways we could have speedrun it
[00:02:01] Unknown (Host): hiring faster
[00:02:03] noticing that we had product market pull and that folks were like literally begging us to go do things
[00:02:09] Unknown (Host): You know when we got very long dox from people saying I was so inspired by our last night together
[00:02:16] Unknown (Host): When we went through this very long user test with everything was not performed and it was you know
[00:02:22] Unknown (Host): The tool was a terrible shape when they followed up the next morning with like you know 13 14-page doc and
[00:02:28] Unknown (Host): It was like here's all the stuff that I want you to build
[00:02:30] Unknown (Host): I probably should have known that maybe people I cared and wanted this thing
[00:02:34] Unknown (Host): But you know, I was also nervous
[00:02:36] Unknown (Host): I kind of took the road map feedback and I was like how man should take forever do all this stuff
[00:02:41] Unknown (Host): In reality, I should have hired faster
[00:02:44] Unknown (Host): I think we had the resources to do it. I was just a little trepidacious
[00:02:48] Unknown (Host): But beyond that, I think um yeah, there was a lot of stuff to build and
[00:02:53] Unknown (Host): There were certain things we could have not done that we like later pulled out
[00:02:57] Unknown (Host): You know, we had Evan my co-founder
[00:03:00] Unknown (Host): a lot of sort of
[00:03:02] Unknown (Host): Thinking about cross-platform stuff compilation and general program language theory and so he made like a way to do a cross-platform targeting
[00:03:11] Unknown (Host): To not just web but also as a backup in case something didn't work out
[00:03:14] Unknown (Host): You know desktop and at some point was like yes is
[00:03:18] Unknown (Host): All stuff we can rip out we can move way faster without doing this. Yeah, so there's things that we can't on speed up and not that much
[00:03:23] Dylan Field: Yeah, I mean there is this category of product
[00:03:25] Dylan Field: I think about like air tables maybe another example where I think it's like a hard product to build
[00:03:29] Dylan Field: I think like email is classically just like you can't you just like can't ship a quick V1 that people will use
[00:03:35] Dylan Field: So maybe there's some element of that that you had yeah, and I think also is like you'd have to relaunched
[00:03:41] Unknown (Host): In GA we kept adding new features and every time we did
[00:03:45] Unknown (Host): Or almost every time would see just that retention would go up
[00:03:50] Unknown (Host): And so it's also interesting, you know, there was folks beginning that were
[00:03:54] Uh very minimalist and they liked the minimalism on the tool
[00:03:59] We started adding everything people needed for their workflows
[00:04:01] And they're like can we have the old Tima back please?
[00:04:05] Unknown (Host): It's always to find that balance between adding and complexity and then
[00:04:08] Unknown (Host): simplicity and approachability but also you gotta make sure it's powerful
[00:04:12] Unknown (Host): Did you have the sense when you were in those early
[00:04:15] Dylan Field: Innings that anything you built worked in other words like were you like
[00:04:19] Dylan Field: All of our ideas that we seem to build they all make the product better like were you sort of like
[00:04:25] Dylan Field: Were you having to make hard calls between A, B and C and one was gonna be good and one was gonna be bad or was it just
[00:04:31] Dylan Field: All of these improvements were good because it was such strong product pull and it was just like the fast rebuilt better
[00:04:36] Dylan Field: Once we got out and once we had people using it
[00:04:40] Unknown (Host): We kind of separated the workstreams into two
[00:04:42] Unknown (Host): So one was the blockers workstream
[00:04:44] Unknown (Host): Whereas like these are things that are literally blocking people from adopting
[00:04:48] Unknown (Host): We know this for a fact
[00:04:49] Unknown (Host): What's the prioritization and rank order of you know, which ones were removed first
[00:04:54] And there's kind of like differentiators we didn't call it that but it was one project at a time mostly
[00:04:59] These are things like design systems and the ability to share
[00:05:02] Unknown (Host): Uh a components and a file across your entire team
[00:05:06] You know and uh
[00:05:08] We have to do both we really had to go evolve this year the world but also
[00:05:12] Make it so more people could try the thing. Yeah
[00:05:14] Dylan Field: When you think about
[00:05:15] Dylan Field: That sort of experience and then you look around at AI tools now and you know
[00:05:20] Dylan Field: There was like a bit going around recently of an investor talking about how you got to get to you know
[00:05:26] A couple million of ARR or no time and you know
[00:05:28] Dylan Field: It's like a bit that you hear a lot and a lot of I think founders feel self-conscious
[00:05:32] Dylan Field: If they're not going one to ten million in like a month or something. Yeah
[00:05:37] Unknown (Host): And there's like a lot of that and I think then you know investors
[00:05:40] Dylan Field: I think are
[00:05:41] Dylan Field: You know kind of helping probably perpetuate it because the next you know round of investors are going to think about the same thing
[00:05:47] Dylan Field: And you know, it's like very very
[00:05:50] Dylan Field: Different than the way Figma got started. Mm-hmm
[00:05:52] Dylan Field: And I'm just curious how you make sense of seeing that around you
[00:05:56] Dylan Field: Since you came up through one of the like slow build type of startups. Yeah
[00:06:00] Unknown (Host): And again, don't recommend slow build either, but I think
[00:06:03] Unknown (Host): First of all if we had today's tools like if I had Figma made today or prompt
[00:06:08] Unknown (Host): App tool to build a faster. Yeah, probably could build a lot faster
[00:06:12] Unknown (Host): But I also think that
[00:06:15] Unknown (Host): Maybe my hot take here is that
[00:06:18] There's a lot of really awesome companies right now that are not like really AI companies
[00:06:23] Unknown (Host): And
[00:06:25] So first of all, I think if you're looking at only AI stuff
[00:06:28] You're just missing a lot. It's like actually there's some gems there
[00:06:31] Unknown (Host): For example recently, you know did investments in companies like Ambrook
[00:06:36] Unknown (Host): Ambrook's amazing company trying to help
[00:06:40] Farmers with their financial situation and like figure out how to make it so they can do taxes better and deal with all the compliance and forms
[00:06:47] Unknown (Host): They come along with it
[00:06:49] Unknown (Host): And I think that they have a real opportunity
[00:06:52] Unknown (Host): In front of them other company invested in
[00:06:55] Unknown (Host): Or I mean her
[00:06:58] Unknown (Host): Companies called until labs and they're a whole body reversible cryogenics company
[00:07:04] Unknown (Host): That's their moon shun goal, but along the way
[00:07:07] You know, there's a real problem to solve
[00:07:10] Unknown (Host): Where organs
[00:07:12] Unknown (Host): You might have an organ come available, but you have a very limited time window
[00:07:17] To get it to a recipient
[00:07:20] And
[00:07:21] if you're able to
[00:07:23] Unknown (Host): Basically use that same tech
[00:07:26] Unknown (Host): To be able to vitrify the organ
[00:07:30] And then
[00:07:31] Unknown (Host): Rewarm it as a nation
[00:07:34] Then you have a longer period of time
[00:07:36] To go make that match and that can save a ton of lives
[00:07:40] Especially combined with new new emerging technologies
[00:07:44] and
[00:07:45] Unknown (Host): You know, it's like yeah neither of them are really yeah, I companies, but like they're great businesses and I'm strong and convicted
[00:07:52] Unknown (Host): It's interesting when you have these like trends as strong as
[00:07:56] Dylan Field: AI now maybe crypto some number of years ago, you know, obviously there's others
[00:08:01] Dylan Field: There's probably a dynamic where there becomes such a strong gold rush to that thing
[00:08:05] Dylan Field: That the people who are not working on that thing are missionaries at a much higher rate also
[00:08:10] Dylan Field: And that's probably also the flip side trap is in the gold rush
[00:08:14] Dylan Field: There's a lot of people who are gonna be you know very missionary about it
[00:08:17] Dylan Field: But there's also a lot of people who are hey, I can go zero to ten next month, so
[00:08:21] Well, I think the other thing that's interesting is that
[00:08:24] Unknown (Host): Yeah, I close its gaps and so
[00:08:28] Unknown (Host): Because it closes gaps and makes it so you can do things that my otherwise take like a very long time
[00:08:34] Unknown (Host): In a short amount of time
[00:08:36] It also expands markets and so I think that's probably implicit to assumptions here. Yeah, is that there's a little hanging fruit all over
[00:08:44] Unknown (Host): Yeah, if we're able to identify these companies growing so fast
[00:08:47] Unknown (Host): We're also identifying the big markets people have tapped yet. Yeah
[00:08:50] Unknown (Host): And I think that um that might be true certainly be true for some companies, but also there's you know
[00:08:59] Unknown (Host): A dynamic where yeah, probably some of the companies that go straight up go straight down
[00:09:03] Unknown (Host): Yeah, it's a question of when and then there'll be some amazing winners. I mean, you know, of course, uh, but also it's just like this default of
[00:09:11] Unknown (Host): Yeah, okay if the why now is AI
[00:09:15] Unknown (Host): You know it's the same why now is kind of like everyone else is why now right and
[00:09:20] Unknown (Host): You know if your pure strategy is like it's gold rush. I'm gonna get their fastest
[00:09:25] Unknown (Host): Then you have to be
[00:09:27] Unknown (Host): Charging incredibly hard. Yep, and you have to be strategic and I think uh
[00:09:33] You know
[00:09:34] First of all, you have to know that you got that in you. Yeah, cuz I run does totally, you know
[00:09:39] Unknown (Host): 999
[00:09:40] Unknown (Host): 6997 whatever it is yeah, that people need to sign up for total. Um, it's also besides the hours
[00:09:46] Dylan Field: It's also a set of business decisions. Mm-hmm. They
[00:09:49] Dylan Field: Look a certain way. They look very different than the way you built it my for example for short and uh, I think also it's it's like okay
[00:09:59] Is this
[00:10:00] Unknown (Host): Something that you think is long term defensible. Is there any reason for you to believe that
[00:10:05] Unknown (Host): But also at the same time if you get there first
[00:10:08] Unknown (Host): It's often the case you can just kind of go all sorts of interesting places
[00:10:12] Unknown (Host): So it's it's uh, you know all these companies. It's very hard to puzzle through what will happen
[00:10:18] Unknown (Host): If you and I think that's like leading to the climate we're in where
[00:10:21] Unknown (Host): Uh, folks are just raising towards opportunities and then yeah they get there and uh people are lining up to go back
[00:10:28] Unknown (Host): Then that very large
[00:10:29] Unknown (Host): Fioeations yeah, where we're seeing these mega seat deals before people even launch anything and that's not a judgment on
[00:10:35] Unknown (Host): Whatever is going on right now because some of them will be amazing companies. It's just a description of where we're at
[00:10:40] Unknown (Host): Do you ever I'm curious do you ever think about um
[00:10:44] Like imagining building a company sort of like in the opposite ethos of the way you built figma and
[00:10:49] Dylan Field: Think about it and save like that actually sounds kind of fun like
[00:10:53] Dylan Field: Does it sound fun to you or tiring to you to do like a very hard charging?
[00:10:59] Dylan Field: You know, just like go for a really aggressive raise a ton higher a ton burn a ton take a market
[00:11:06] Dylan Field: Which is very different than you know, you obviously built this like super profitable
[00:11:09] Dylan Field: You know high sort of you know focused company
[00:11:12] Dylan Field: I mean basically
[00:11:14] Unknown (Host): Uh, the first part of that the hard charging part
[00:11:18] Um
[00:11:19] Is what we were doing at figma
[00:11:22] Uh, I think that the team is working incredibly hard right now myself included and uh, we see massive opportunity in front of us
[00:11:30] Unknown (Host): Figuemake is one example
[00:11:32] Unknown (Host): Um, that's an industry where you know, if there's a lot of different players
[00:11:35] Unknown (Host): We think we have a differentiated approach where you can go from figma design pull context in
[00:11:41] Unknown (Host): Into figma make
[00:11:43] Use that to create a better design application
[00:11:46] Unknown (Host): Uh, and then also go back to figmazine tweak and eventually it'll be you know, hopefully around trip to size the same coin
[00:11:52] Unknown (Host): Yeah, and you'll be able to uh to we've talked about this a little bit publicly
[00:11:57] Unknown (Host): But be able to do more workflows assistant
[00:12:01] Unknown (Host): Type things in figmazine where you can prompt there too um
[00:12:04] Unknown (Host): Uh, and just in general
[00:12:07] Like so excited about making it so that more people
[00:12:11] Unknown (Host): Can create these designs that are consistent
[00:12:14] With or overall brand language the design system
[00:12:17] Unknown (Host): Um and get the ideas out there because if like you scribble something on napkin it will not be treated seriously
[00:12:23] Unknown (Host): As if it looks you know the same as your usual UI. Yeah
[00:12:28] Doesn't mean you don't need a designer
[00:12:29] Unknown (Host): Uh, we're gonna get to a world where are you kind of there
[00:12:33] Unknown (Host): Where good enough is not enough
[00:12:37] Unknown (Host): Good enough is gonna be mediocre. Mm-hmm
[00:12:39] Unknown (Host): And you're gonna need to differentiate through design through craft through point of view
[00:12:44] Unknown (Host): Through brand through storytelling and
[00:12:47] Unknown (Host): Marketing and I think uh the people that internalize that now they're gonna be winners. Yep. That's my
[00:12:53] Point of view is that this is what's gonna matter the stuff at the top of the stack
[00:12:57] And if you don't internalize it now like you got an issue
[00:13:00] Unknown (Host): This is one of the topics I want to ask you about is
[00:13:03] As far as you can see I don't even know how many years that is today, but as far as you can see
[00:13:09] Do you think that
[00:13:11] The role of the human designer will flip somehow from
[00:13:15] Dylan Field: Maker to editor or something different like that or does it become you know only focus
[00:13:21] Dylan Field: You know people on the most creative most pivotal flourishes or you know most important integral parts of the product like where does this go?
[00:13:30] You know if you look out as far as you're able to look out I think um
[00:13:35] First of all
[00:13:38] I think it's I've been kind of in this place of uh maybe the roles are all
[00:13:43] Unknown (Host): merging together and I was saying that before even AI
[00:13:47] Unknown (Host): Was the topic you were uh, you know, even 10 years ago five years ago
[00:13:51] Unknown (Host): There's been something I've been kind of noticing just slow progression towards
[00:13:55] Unknown (Host): Uh, and now I feel like the world's being sort of uh opm
[00:13:59] Unknown (Host): Engineer designer researcher, you know the sort of typical roles you find in the product design development process and
[00:14:08] I think that um
[00:14:10] If you look at sort of like the general pull of AI
[00:14:14] It makes everyone feel like they should be more generalist to keep up
[00:14:18] And then also if you look at the way that things are actually playing out
[00:14:21] Unknown (Host): I think it's this rules merging because the rules are still there
[00:14:25] For the responsibilities. It's the things that people are doing every day
[00:14:28] Unknown (Host): Those are starting at more murky. It's like everyone has their specialization
[00:14:32] Unknown (Host): But then they also have uh
[00:14:34] Unknown (Host): increased ability
[00:14:36] Unknown (Host): To have impact elsewhere outside their specialization
[00:14:39] Unknown (Host): So now it's like okay as a designer like
[00:14:42] I'll go commit some code
[00:14:43] Unknown (Host): Whereas a product manager actually go actually make a person from idea rather than just a priority
[00:14:48] Unknown (Host): Yeah, I mean obviously you've always had like full stack product builders that like uh start up and like uh
[00:14:54] Dylan Field: Co-founder CTO has always done all of that for um since this longest software's been going
[00:14:59] Dylan Field: Well, but oftentimes they go work with a product manager designer. Yeah, and all them just uh
[00:15:05] Unknown (Host): Or doing it all totally and I think though that now we're in a place where you should be hiring a designer right away
[00:15:11] Unknown (Host): Came back to your question around what's the future of the designer role?
[00:15:15] Uh, I think design has like kind of everything going forward
[00:15:18] Unknown (Host): If you think of that as the top of the value stack
[00:15:21] Unknown (Host): And you think about all the things that can impact design and all the things you're trying to pull in
[00:15:25] Unknown (Host): You're thinking about the business logic you're thinking about the user problems
[00:15:29] Unknown (Host): You're trying to get to the hard user problems like was they really want
[00:15:33] Unknown (Host): Um trying to think about the system and how it shows up in all these different places. Yep the brand
[00:15:40] Unknown (Host): The way that you're able to incorporate culture the affordances you want to use the style that you want to go with
[00:15:46] Unknown (Host): But also the structure and all these decisions
[00:15:49] Unknown (Host): Are at the root of how you'll win or was the business? Yeah, and there's good AI tooling around a lot of what you just said
[00:15:55] Dylan Field: I mean even like getting user feedback
[00:15:58] Dylan Field: Mm-hmm, you know used to be and you know to some extent still is
[00:16:01] Dylan Field: But it used to be like the way you had to do it was like ghost-guadal 130-minute calls
[00:16:06] Dylan Field: And now you can do it other ways
[00:16:08] Dylan Field: Yeah, and so it's like you think about a designer and they're able to get feedback
[00:16:11] Dylan Field: Scalably they're probably able to like make at least good enough versions of designs that they can start playing with
[00:16:18] Dylan Field: They can probably start to get something into production like all from sort of like a cockpit
[00:16:23] Yeah, I'm not saying that like in the next year two years
[00:16:27] Unknown (Host): Um that designer will then be able to sell the company as one person. Yep. I actually think
[00:16:34] Unknown (Host): Engineers are more needed than ever to be able to architect systems properly to think through
[00:16:41] Unknown (Host): What is the right way to go and figure out
[00:16:44] Unknown (Host): Uh
[00:16:45] Unknown (Host): How you should structure everything because if you just let these agents run right now. Yep
[00:16:50] Unknown (Host): You're gonna have a mess and that's where we see security vulnerabilities and we see hacks going on and these beta
[00:16:55] Unknown (Host): Leakeen and we see you know companies that start to scale and they break
[00:17:00] Dylan Field: Doing this is like a moment in time issue or do you think that this is like a perpetual issue?
[00:17:04] Dylan Field: Um, I think it's for sure that issue right now and I would expect this issue for a while longer
[00:17:12] Unknown (Host): And I think the developer will still be in that outer loop even as these models improve
[00:17:17] Unknown (Host): As well researchers like it's kind of an interesting question for math as well like
[00:17:22] Unknown (Host): uh, I think math is probably underappreciated as one of the most deterministic areas
[00:17:28] Unknown (Host): Where rl should shine the most like even more so than code
[00:17:33] Uh, and it should be the case that like I don't know how much it costs but we have a ASI
[00:17:39] Unknown (Host): by
[00:17:40] Unknown (Host): mathematician
[00:17:41] Does that mean that mathematicians are out of a job?
[00:17:43] Unknown (Host): No, I don't think so I think that the mathematicians will be prompting and reasoning through things and working with
[00:17:48] Unknown (Host): That ASI and they're kind of going to be almost fishermen trying to fish for the theorems the proofs
[00:17:54] Do you think that we are I think what you're describing is there's a future where we have
[00:18:00] potentially even more designers and engineers than we have now, but they're just much more productive
[00:18:04] Dylan Field: I think much more productive
[00:18:05] Unknown (Host): But let's be clear about productivity
[00:18:08] Unknown (Host): In the engineering context productivity is building smith well
[00:18:12] Dylan Field: In the design context it might be that it is just further exploration of the options based on times
[00:18:19] Because I think right now oftentimes you're constrained by timeline
[00:18:23] Unknown (Host): You can only explore so much you might not be getting to the best solution
[00:18:26] Unknown (Host): If you can explore even further look at more options. Yeah, and figure out how those actually will work out in the decision tree
[00:18:33] Then from there you can figure out okay
[00:18:35] Unknown (Host): Here's the option I want to go with and then go even deeper and you can actually go and apply even more craft
[00:18:40] Unknown (Host): To that option and I think that design is inherently non-aterministic unlike math
[00:18:46] And so the role of AI and how it shows up in a sign will be very different than the more
[00:18:52] Unknown (Host): Terministic loops like code and math
[00:18:55] Dylan Field: Do you buy the argument that will have like lots of small companies with a billion of revenue?
[00:19:01] Or do you think that
[00:19:03] Dylan Field: Instead role happen is the level of competitions just going to rise and companies will be about the same size
[00:19:08] Dylan Field: But the software is just going to be like waycicker
[00:19:11] Dylan Field: You know, I think that there's already companies that are smaller than you expect
[00:19:17] Unknown (Host): With large runs of revenue and then the question is
[00:19:20] Unknown (Host): How much will they scale before they just totally break?
[00:19:23] Unknown (Host): And I think we're going to find out
[00:19:26] Unknown (Host): I'm sure that you and I both have mutual friends that are in this situation
[00:19:30] Unknown (Host): and
[00:19:31] Unknown (Host): You know, I talked to these founders and they're
[00:19:35] Unknown (Host): proud of like how much they've accomplished with so few people
[00:19:38] Unknown (Host): It's like oh my god, I got to this revenue milestone. It's like quite huge and I've got like 10 people
[00:19:43] It's amazing wow, I think all this positive reinforcement and they also say who talked them all the longer
[00:19:48] Unknown (Host): I'm really trying to hire you got near referrals for me. Yeah, cuz like they are desperate for more people to go help with all the problems
[00:19:56] Unknown (Host): They now have a scale. Yeah, and so I I don't know
[00:19:59] Unknown (Host): If it's true that like team sizes will decrease a lot
[00:20:03] Unknown (Host): There's a lot of problems to deal with you know, yes, AI makes
[00:20:07] Unknown (Host): Summer rolls more efficient not all rolls. Yeah, and as AI improves
[00:20:12] Unknown (Host): We'll get more efficiencies, but that also is just more work done totally
[00:20:16] Dylan Field: I mean to that point
[00:20:17] Dylan Field: It's like if the engineers get much more productive because of code gen
[00:20:21] Dylan Field: It's like well, you're going to start building a lot more product. Yeah, you need a little testing a lot more product too
[00:20:25] Dylan Field: Probably more designers. Yeah, so I do think it all kind of plays that way
[00:20:28] Dylan Field: And I think the competition aspect is really important if you have more software in the world
[00:20:33] Unknown (Host): We've had this exponential curve so far. That's the part I've never understood
[00:20:36] Dylan Field: It's like company A is like doing the same with less now
[00:20:40] Dylan Field: Then company B's like well, I'll just do more with the same and we'll win. I see it as
[00:20:45] Dylan Field: For Figma, I mean we just went through headcount planning
[00:20:48] You know
[00:20:50] It didn't really cross my mind to go hey, let's reduce headcount or let's keep headcount flat
[00:20:54] Unknown (Host): It's like we got so much we want to do we have so many ideas
[00:20:58] Unknown (Host): Let's increase headcount let's go higher people that are great
[00:21:01] Unknown (Host): And let's go do all stuff. Yeah amazing stuff for our users
[00:21:06] Unknown (Host): And I think just like that's the mindset. I think more companies will find themselves in is oh my gosh
[00:21:11] Unknown (Host): Like there's more possibility
[00:21:13] Unknown (Host): I can do more and I need more people for it. Yeah, and then some companies will go oh maybe I can get more efficient
[00:21:18] Unknown (Host): But I think that might be a recipe for long-term
[00:21:22] Unknown (Host): You know sort of
[00:21:24] They might not be as effective as the companies that are trying to grow with the technology on this competition point
[00:21:30] One of the things I wanted to ask you about that might come off is you know
[00:21:34] Dylan Field: ignorant or annoying so sorry in advance, but that's a good way done
[00:21:38] Unknown (Host): I always read Figma as
[00:21:40] Dylan Field: Having somewhat low competition relative to being such a big market and
[00:21:46] Dylan Field: Obviously you had you know other products that you were competing with and there was Adobe and there was sketch
[00:21:52] Dylan Field: Um, and that's not to minimize any of it
[00:21:55] Dylan Field: But it seemed to me like the market didn't catch on
[00:21:59] Around you as fast as I thought it might have versus in other markets that seem smaller
[00:22:04] There's many many more companies working on it. Is that right or am I misreading it?
[00:22:09] Dylan Field: I think it's changed over different periods of time. I mean
[00:22:13] Unknown (Host): In the beginning of Figma when we first started
[00:22:16] I am really looking at the Bureau of Aperiastics because I want to know the market size
[00:22:20] Unknown (Host): Like you should know if you're reading any business book
[00:22:24] And the answer was two hundred fifty thousand designers
[00:22:26] Unknown (Host): There's two hundred fifty thousand designers in the United States
[00:22:30] I'm like
[00:22:31] shit
[00:22:32] Like that that's not the market that we can use to go get VC funding
[00:22:37] Unknown (Host): So my pitch was basically like we'll start with design. We're gonna rot them out
[00:22:41] and then
[00:22:43] Unknown (Host): I think was actually happening to my intuition but I can't articulate it very well all the time
[00:22:48] was
[00:22:49] Everything else is getting easier like you don't have to host servers anymore
[00:22:52] Unknown (Host): You could just use the cloud you didn't have to go make box software you could go
[00:22:56] Unknown (Host): Use app stores dev tools are getting better
[00:22:59] And as all these things were changing
[00:23:02] Whereas value crew top the stack
[00:23:04] Unknown (Host): To designs and people are whether they're able to articulate that or not they're hiring more designers
[00:23:09] And the ramp we saw in terms of number designers in the world
[00:23:12] Unknown (Host): Over the first decade of Figma was tremendous. That market got so much bigger
[00:23:17] Unknown (Host): So yeah when we started off I mean Adobe had just killed fireworks
[00:23:20] Unknown (Host): Because they thought it was not
[00:23:23] Unknown (Host): You know it's kind of mess. I think maybe on the code side and
[00:23:26] Unknown (Host): Acquired through macamedia and they thought okay. This is not worth for efforts right now
[00:23:31] Unknown (Host): That's my sense and um
[00:23:34] Basically then people switched the sketch
[00:23:36] And our main competitor was sketch and then vision
[00:23:39] As a combination
[00:23:40] Unknown (Host): There are other tools that start to appear like abstract
[00:23:44] All these companies founded by really amazing impressive people. Yep with really cool
[00:23:49] Unknown (Host): You know strategies and marketing and tech
[00:23:52] Unknown (Host): And some of the people that you know have worked these companies are at Figma some or not
[00:23:57] But you know sketch was really the competitor. Yeah, and is today still a competitor
[00:24:02] Unknown (Host): They keep going on and they're a really really cool company
[00:24:07] The
[00:24:08] Invision aspect was fascinating because I remember
[00:24:12] Unknown (Host): They're marking was just so good. I mean at some point
[00:24:16] Unknown (Host): They put out basically a teaser of their next product in vision studio
[00:24:21] Unknown (Host): I was trying to raise the time and um, there are VCs that
[00:24:26] You know told me hey like I just cannot reconcile your position with vision pass
[00:24:31] I'm like, but they haven't even launched the thing yet like are you sure?
[00:24:34] Unknown (Host): You know
[00:24:36] Unknown (Host): As a founder you're like come on
[00:24:39] Unknown (Host): But I also I think because you know, it was
[00:24:42] Unknown (Host): Teams that were distributed in like
[00:24:44] Unknown (Host): Weird ways across time zones and they were always racing for the next milestone
[00:24:49] Unknown (Host): They just had so much tech debt and it really slowed them down
[00:24:52] Unknown (Host): Which I also think is a potential issue for all the companies that are moving so fast right now
[00:24:57] Unknown (Host): In doing so in a way that's not like well thought out. Yes, so anyway
[00:25:02] Unknown (Host): I think that the the commission felt very real then the dobi xd came along
[00:25:06] Unknown (Host): We're really worried about it
[00:25:08] Then it kind of faded away. They put it until I guess on set mode
[00:25:13] And just kind of went hey, this is not working
[00:25:16] Uh, and then you know, you compare that to now. Yeah, and I think it's the most exciting time ever
[00:25:21] Unknown (Host): I mean the reason we got into the space. Yes, was that we could create more tools for people building products
[00:25:27] Unknown (Host): And now I think we validate that there's a mark of their
[00:25:30] Unknown (Host): People are excited about that
[00:25:32] There's a lot of people they're trying all these cool different approaches
[00:25:36] Unknown (Host): And I think it's awesome like so much for people to try and learn from like the options space
[00:25:42] Unknown (Host): It can be fully explored of how we build products. Yep, and software. I think it's great
[00:25:48] I think what I heard in there is besides the fact that there was competition
[00:25:52] Dylan Field: Maybe one of the like learnable things for founders is you started and it was not the market size that it is right now
[00:25:59] Dylan Field: Yeah, and so you know you started in a thing that was
[00:26:03] Dylan Field: 250,000 users maybe people thought you could charge 20 bucks a month
[00:26:06] Dylan Field: So some VCs probably sitting there thinking well like geez, that's not like a ton of revenue possible
[00:26:10] Dylan Field: And I can get the whole thing
[00:26:12] Dylan Field: So you probably had a lot of people passing over market size
[00:26:14] Dylan Field: And so one of the flip sides of being in a sort of illegible market is you might get a little bit more time to build and grow
[00:26:23] definitely true in the past
[00:26:25] You know the tree today maybe I think
[00:26:28] Dylan Field: It would be different today because there's just so much more of everything
[00:26:32] Unknown (Host): Yeah, I think to the amount of software going back to exponential graph
[00:26:35] Unknown (Host): It's like it's been exponential since Mark and Dreson wrote that essay was a 2011 of like you know software's in the world
[00:26:42] Unknown (Host): You know back to that time and it's like the exponential increase in real and now it's like vertical
[00:26:46] Unknown (Host): Yeah, but I also think there's an opportunity
[00:26:49] Unknown (Host): That is underappreciated to go build and boring spaces
[00:26:54] It's like as long as you're passionate about it. Don't do something you're not passionate about
[00:26:58] If you're a founder and you're waking up in 10 years and going why the heck am I working on this
[00:27:02] Unknown (Host): Like what's be really you didn't even make it 10 years
[00:27:04] Unknown (Host): You probably made a few and you burnt out and you like either try to flip it and work or did work
[00:27:09] Unknown (Host): And you're stuck with this thing if you didn't and uh if you take it on VC money then you know you can't keep going
[00:27:15] Unknown (Host): It's like our friend Adam guilt building owner you and I both obviously invest in her friends with them and
[00:27:19] Dylan Field: He's very passionate
[00:27:20] Dylan Field: It's very passionate and he's building in a space that I think has been overlooked by tons of entrepreneurs
[00:27:24] Dylan Field: I think he thinks it's the most interesting thing in the possible in the world and
[00:27:29] Unknown (Host): a lot of other folks are
[00:27:31] Unknown (Host): Of the opinion that this is like very boring. Yeah, and I think it's an advantage to work in a space that other people consider boring
[00:27:37] Unknown (Host): Yes, but to your point you can't go just like fake that. Nope because you got to work on the thing for 10 years
[00:27:42] Dylan Field: Yeah, maybe 20 maybe 30. Yeah, if you're lucky you'll work out forever. Yeah, exactly. I'm hoping for figma
[00:27:48] Dylan Field: I think you will I want to talk about the way that you show up as a CEO because I think there is a
[00:27:52] somewhat widely held opinion which might have grain siftries, but maybe not
[00:27:57] Dylan Field: Which is that to be an unbelievable founder unbelievable CEO you kind of got to be
[00:28:03] Rough and you got to be aggressive and you kind of got to be
[00:28:06] Dylan Field: Charkey and out for you know your company and yourself and all these other things
[00:28:11] Dylan Field: and
[00:28:12] Dylan Field: Obviously there are people who do it that way and who are very successful and that's fine, but um
[00:28:18] You to me are an example of doing it the other way where
[00:28:21] Dylan Field: It doesn't come from a place of like you know, hate and revenge or winning or all these things
[00:28:26] Dylan Field: Which again, there's nothing negative about building in those ways
[00:28:30] Dylan Field: But there is this other way to do it and I'm just curious if you
[00:28:34] Dylan Field: Have reflected on this because I'm guessing you also see that in yourself and you see this in other people
[00:28:41] Dylan Field: And I just be curious to sort of like hear your musings on this topic of like to be a world-class founder CEO
[00:28:48] Dylan Field: Do you have to be a certain way here?
[00:28:50] Well, first of all, I think there's just like a bajillion ways to start a company
[00:28:54] You know, you don't have to take PC funding at all. You can bootstrap it
[00:28:57] Unknown (Host): You can take the PC funding. There's like patients attached to that
[00:29:01] Unknown (Host): you can you know do it on your own you can do it with a team
[00:29:05] Uh, and all personalities can shine
[00:29:08] Unknown (Host): You can look at the founders that are in Silicon Valley right now that are scaling
[00:29:12] Unknown (Host): I mean you can find every personality
[00:29:14] Unknown (Host): Uh every kind of makeup of a founder that you can imagine. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah
[00:29:18] Unknown (Host): Uh, I think that
[00:29:20] Unknown (Host): You know some investors have this thesis of like
[00:29:23] They got to have a chip on their shoulder. It's gotta be like some like mega trauma. Yeah
[00:29:28] Unknown (Host): Um, I don't know how to pretty amazing childhood. I'm very thankful to my parents like
[00:29:33] You know, I do like to win. I'll say that. I hate losing but otherwise
[00:29:38] Unknown (Host): It's not like a yeah big chip on the shoulder that you know, I gotta go prove myself every day
[00:29:44] Unknown (Host): Um, it's more that I really enjoy building when I'm building
[00:29:48] Unknown (Host): I think I found this amazing group of people to do that with and
[00:29:52] You know, uh, it's really fun
[00:29:54] Unknown (Host): That's what's interesting is you are
[00:29:56] Dylan Field: Extremely driven and motivated, but it doesn't seem to come from
[00:30:00] Dylan Field: Any of that stuff that you'd often hear from a VC on a podcast about a chip on a shoulder or
[00:30:06] Dylan Field: Something that you know happen wrong in their life or somebody wronged them
[00:30:10] Dylan Field: It seems like you just love what you do. I mean I get to do the most awesome stuff ever
[00:30:15] Unknown (Host): Which is like build tools for designers create a people
[00:30:18] Unknown (Host): Uh, and then go see what they make in the world like I can't imagine something more interesting or exciting to work on
[00:30:24] Do you think this is like an uncommon source of this type of motivation or do you think like like in other words
[00:30:30] Dylan Field: Do you think that this conception that a lot of investors made founders a lot of people have do you think it's off base
[00:30:38] Dylan Field: Or do you think it is in fact at the more common source that drives people?
[00:30:43] I don't know. I think I probably get like a
[00:30:46] A sample that's you may not representative because I have a lot of friends that also you track people like you
[00:30:51] Unknown (Host): Uh are just really driven by mission um some of them have some of the shoulders some of them don't
[00:30:57] Unknown (Host): I guess the bigger thing is maybe just like
[00:31:01] Don't get so attached to the chip on your shoulder that you don't work through it like
[00:31:07] Unknown (Host): If you're excited about what you're doing and you like heal a bit. That's okay. Trust me
[00:31:12] Unknown (Host): Uh, I've seen friends go through that journey and they shop their company next day and
[00:31:16] Unknown (Host): Our week or month or year or 10 years. How long it takes them to work through it and yeah, yeah, they're kick nass
[00:31:23] Unknown (Host): Yeah, so like I don't think it's this thing where you know, you should
[00:31:27] Unknown (Host): Sigma ties some like therapy or yeah, introspection
[00:31:32] Uh, because you're trying to feed the sort of VC capitalist machine. Yeah, like you can still feed the machine
[00:31:38] Unknown (Host): And you can like work on your ship. It is fun. I don't know if you experienced this way, but I experienced building a company
[00:31:44] Form of therapy is probably too strong of a word
[00:31:46] Dylan Field: But it is a form of understanding yourself and working through a lot of some mirror. It's something. Yeah, and uh
[00:31:53] Well, don't be wrong like
[00:31:55] Unknown (Host): I hope I'm on asshole, but I definitely am in tents and many meetings and oftentimes I reflect afterwards and go
[00:32:01] Unknown (Host): Oh man, I should shut up there better, right?
[00:32:05] Unknown (Host): But yeah, you trouble a certain way
[00:32:07] Unknown (Host): People will tell you if you got a good culture of communication and then you improve
[00:32:12] Unknown (Host): Yeah, it also just forces so many like weird psychological situations and then you have to reflect on those and
[00:32:20] Dylan Field: You know, sometimes you do realize that like behaving a way that I'm not
[00:32:24] You know, the most proud of was effective and now how do I deal with that?
[00:32:28] Dylan Field: You know, like I had a lot of those kind of things too, where I was just like wow
[00:32:31] Dylan Field: You're just put in these situations that force a lot of reflection and personal growth, I think which is good
[00:32:38] But
[00:32:39] Dylan Field: But yeah, I just thought this was interesting because like you're often cited as like an example is in the counter to this thing
[00:32:45] Dylan Field: And I just like want there to be more of that in the world
[00:32:49] Dylan Field: So okay, thank you. Yeah, well changing gears to another topic
[00:32:54] You and I I think first got to know each other. This wasn't how but around the time we got to know each other
[00:33:00] Dylan Field: um
[00:33:01] Dylan Field: When we were younger we had this group of other friends and people I think even younger than us who were like smart engineers
[00:33:08] Dylan Field: We called it towed chat for whatever you call it toad
[00:33:10] Dylan Field: I called you made the group to speak clear. I made the group but you let me join as an honorary toad
[00:33:14] Unknown (Host): You were very like I'm not a toad but I'm here to be I'm here to I was honored to be there and
[00:33:21] Looking back there were like a lot of people in that group
[00:33:24] Dylan Field: You know, there was you Alex Wang
[00:33:27] Dylan Field: um are you in conrat like there was like many others many others. Yeah, it was awesome
[00:33:31] Dylan Field: And I look back at that and I don't know we must have been
[00:33:35] Middle late 20s or you know people in the early 20s early 20s
[00:33:39] Unknown (Host): and I often think about that as like
[00:33:43] The importance being connected to young people as a founder as an investor as just anybody in tech because I do think
[00:33:50] Dylan Field: There's so much just raw
[00:33:53] Sort of effort understanding you're at the front of so much stuff there and
[00:33:59] Dylan Field: You know, I think about this now as we're like and getting into like mid 30s and you know like how does that change over time
[00:34:06] Dylan Field: And I don't know. I'm just curious your own experience because you're somebody who
[00:34:09] Yourself started as a young person. You know start the computing person. You've been connected to young people throughout
[00:34:15] Dylan Field: You still are of course, but like how is that journey changed for you?
[00:34:18] Yeah, I fear sometimes I'm not as connected to the youth as I once was uh, and I think that when you're young
[00:34:24] Unknown (Host): Me me starting figma Evan as well
[00:34:27] Unknown (Host): We've grown up like you know playing world of work craft multiplayer games
[00:34:32] Unknown (Host): Using Google docs at school. So just gave us a mindset
[00:34:36] Because of the tech stack we've grown up in the culture we've grown up in that
[00:34:41] seemed to us obvious native
[00:34:43] Unknown (Host): And then I would go talk to an investor be like oh, yeah, like Google docs and they're like wait
[00:34:48] Like use Google docs
[00:34:49] Unknown (Host): Like it's 2012 this 2013 like who doesn't use Google docs? They're like a word and outlook here
[00:34:56] Unknown (Host): And sometimes collaboration not sure if I've ever experienced it. I'm like what
[00:35:00] Like this is my life. Yeah
[00:35:02] Unknown (Host): Yeah, so the generational divides can sometimes be very real and
[00:35:07] I always try to educate myself by like understanding what it is that people are trying to buy
[00:35:12] Unknown (Host): uh, I think that social media can be one way to do that
[00:35:15] Unknown (Host): But it's hard to reconstruct in an ago feed world same context now
[00:35:21] I think just talking to people like understanding their frame is always important and also just making friends
[00:35:27] Unknown (Host): Across age groups. I've got friends that are younger than me. You know, I've got friends that are 80
[00:35:33] Unknown (Host): The other day I was talking to this incredibly percussive amazing 16 year old to like a gothic column
[00:35:39] Unknown (Host): It's like oh my god. How do I hire you? Is that legal?
[00:35:42] Unknown (Host): Like please come work to pick my name is amazing when you talk to somebody who's like those ages and you're like I can't believe it
[00:35:48] Dylan Field: Yeah, I mean, you know talking this person
[00:35:51] I was just like you're more mature than a lot of third year old. Yeah, and she's incredible
[00:35:56] Unknown (Host): I drive very so many. Yeah, I was talking to a founder that I would have guessed just by the way he was talking
[00:36:01] Dylan Field: I would have guessed was 30 there's 20. Yeah, I was like man. I was not I was not like that when I was 20
[00:36:07] Dylan Field: I think that you know the generational divide and the notion of generations is real like millennials
[00:36:13] Unknown (Host): Well, come on out look and you know, we're
[00:36:17] Unknown (Host): Raising a time where we were the most famous millennials
[00:36:22] Taylor Swift. Yeah, Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah
[00:36:25] Unknown (Host): I actually know who the famous famous people in Gen ZR. I mean you do
[00:36:30] I don't know who are the role models. I don't know who the role models are. I mean, I could probably
[00:36:35] But then there's like the shift in philosophy too. I mean for Gen Z
[00:36:38] Unknown (Host): I think there's a very different view and framework through which
[00:36:42] Unknown (Host): People that are in that generation roughly not saying for everyone, but for a lot of them
[00:36:46] Unknown (Host): go through the world and and see the world and
[00:36:50] Unknown (Host): For folks that went through COVID and had to be locked up and
[00:36:55] Unknown (Host): Antisocial and not see other humans for a few years totally is everyone in school
[00:36:58] Unknown (Host): I mean what effect does that have on you a lot of effect also imagine if you graduated
[00:37:03] You know and came into the workforce in 2020 like right as COVID is happening. Yeah, right as you know
[00:37:09] Dylan Field: We have plenty of people that did it figure yeah, yeah, or you know, but but then you like you know
[00:37:13] Dylan Field: You start Serp or imagine coming in in 2022 and everything's tough
[00:37:17] Dylan Field: And then imagine coming in 2025 and everything's AI
[00:37:20] Dylan Field: It's just like a few years make a big difference huge. Yeah, and I think the mindsets the
[00:37:26] Unknown (Host): Also just approach. I mean, I think um there's a lot of emergence right now of nihilism. Yeah
[00:37:32] Unknown (Host): I don't think it's like a permanent thing maybe but if you look at it and you're like
[00:37:36] Okay, well if you're told that AI is going to take all entry-level jobs
[00:37:40] Unknown (Host): I like a lot of media and you're told that climate change is going to affect the world
[00:37:45] Unknown (Host): um, and you believe that you have no economic prospect long-term. Yeah, I'll never own a house
[00:37:52] Unknown (Host): In their real support kids in America like that'll change your outlook on things. Yes
[00:37:57] Unknown (Host): And that's like the media narrative for a lot of people right now
[00:38:00] Unknown (Host): I don't think it's quite right
[00:38:02] Unknown (Host): I'm more optimistic than that. Yeah, but like well, I think you get both
[00:38:06] Dylan Field: I'm optimistic too. I think there's a lot of people who don't succumb to that
[00:38:09] Dylan Field: but I think you can also sort of empirically see it and
[00:38:14] You know, I think there's great parts of crypto, but there's parts of crypto that reflect nihilism
[00:38:18] Dylan Field: There's great parts of sports card and collectibles and there's parts that are nihilism
[00:38:23] Dylan Field: You know, there's probably good parts of well, I think often the work is like
[00:38:27] Unknown (Host): You know, for example in crypto. I got excited about fts
[00:38:30] Unknown (Host): Yeah, really early before they called it fts. We called them crypto collectibles. Yeah, usually I remember on clubhouse
[00:38:35] Dylan Field: You have that big that that sort of yeah, well that was years later
[00:38:39] Unknown (Host): I mean, yeah, but like I went from this era where it's all idealism and all this energy around like this
[00:38:47] Just kind of like tension of the yeah, like idea of digital scarcity. How can something digital be scarce?
[00:38:52] Unknown (Host): That's so cool early crypto was this very like romantic missionary thing. Yeah
[00:38:56] Dylan Field: Well, and then there's early crypto and early Bitcoin which was like, you know libertarian philosophy and
[00:39:02] Unknown (Host): hard money and people that really didn't believe in state and
[00:39:07] Unknown (Host): Thought it shall be debundled. That was a totally different mindset. I was I was there because I thought yeah
[00:39:12] Unknown (Host): It's not so digital is scarcity and art was cool and like but then that excited and then it evolved. Yeah, and as it picks up
[00:39:19] A lot of crypto
[00:39:21] Unknown (Host): Becomes degenerate gambling. Yes, and NFTs base was no different. I think I missed the tradition at some point
[00:39:26] Unknown (Host): Where it became that and I was still in the idealistic frame and then the
[00:39:30] Unknown (Host): So like no, this is how you make like a lot of money really fast and get rich quick. Yeah, and it's kind of interesting actually
[00:39:37] Unknown (Host): I feel like right now with
[00:39:40] Unknown (Host): Vibe coding there's been almost like that same arc of you know for me
[00:39:47] Unknown (Host): I think of I think it's like for gonna make and I'm like okay great
[00:39:51] Like now everyone can go make prototypes and make production apps faster and ship them
[00:39:56] It's so cool like you can just do all this stuff that you just takes so long so fast and
[00:40:02] Unknown (Host): And you can improve it you can iterate
[00:40:04] Unknown (Host): I think a lot of people also see it as like I can finally build up use a software and get rich quick
[00:40:09] Unknown (Host): And of course there's stuff in middle two. Yeah, but I I don't know
[00:40:13] Unknown (Host): I mean it takes a long time to go build a company. It's not like yeah
[00:40:16] Unknown (Host): It's just an overnight thing and I think a lot of the folks that are just so this like I will spend an hour on
[00:40:22] Unknown (Host): My app and I'll ship it. Yeah, like
[00:40:25] Unknown (Host): they're probably you know, eventually phase out and
[00:40:29] Unknown (Host): uh, I think that the folks that remain will be the ones that are using as a tool. I think it's interesting because I think this this whole rise of
[00:40:36] Dylan Field: Apathy, nihilism, whatever is is very real and I think
[00:40:41] Dylan Field: You sort of
[00:40:42] Dylan Field: You know opened it up with this but you can't blame people because it's like you know, homes, you know
[00:40:47] Dylan Field: You know like we're sitting here in San Francisco like homes seem like ridiculously unaffordable if you're 22 and just getting started
[00:40:53] Dylan Field: You know, just like all these reasons why it's like while I got to do something like a little divergent to get something to happen
[00:40:59] Dylan Field: So like why not gamble?
[00:41:01] And I think a lot of this same sort of mindset applies and sort of just like it's not just in the gamble
[00:41:06] Dylan Field: Like it's also when people build like you know companies and doing venture and all of that
[00:41:10] Dylan Field: I think you get to see sort of the range of just like going for it for
[00:41:15] Dylan Field: You know sort of the the long-term reasons versus like what can I what can I flip this year?
[00:41:19] Dylan Field: And then there's a lot of people who were also like extremely long-term have a thesis about the world
[00:41:25] Unknown (Host): Yeah, optimistic yep
[00:41:27] Unknown (Host): And they're trying to inflect the world for the better and their mission driven not voluntarily driven
[00:41:31] Unknown (Host): Yeah, I mean hopefully more of those than ever like as tech grows. Hopefully it's more than ever
[00:41:34] Dylan Field: Those are the folks inspire me. Yeah
[00:41:36] Dylan Field: One of the things that I thought was very impressive among many on the figment journey is
[00:41:42] Dylan Field: um
[00:41:43] The company seemed to get stronger through the Adobe acquisition and you know sort of it falling apart
[00:41:50] Dylan Field: And I would imagine that would be the kind of thing that could like spiritually break a lot of companies culturally a lot of founders who were like
[00:41:58] Dylan Field: Man, I was like right there and I got to do this whole like emotional and cultural reset
[00:42:05] Dylan Field: So like um how did you how did you navigate that I guess starting with your own psychology?
[00:42:11] Dylan Field: Yeah, um that was probably the hardest of man psychology
[00:42:15] uh
[00:42:16] Unknown (Host): Because and everything else
[00:42:17] Unknown (Host): It's downstream of that if you're not like
[00:42:21] Right in your own head then how can you lead? Yeah?
[00:42:24] Unknown (Host): Or make good decisions even and for me, I think um
[00:42:28] You know the starter was kind of like oh 95% certainty will go through no worries
[00:42:32] Unknown (Host): Just kind of every time we checked in the certainty went down
[00:42:36] Unknown (Host): Uh eventually you know the end is like oh there's maybe a five or some chance
[00:42:40] Unknown (Host): You know it in that arc, you know at some point very quickly. We were like okay. This is not a sure thing
[00:42:46] Keep the phone the gas keep building
[00:42:48] Unknown (Host): um
[00:42:48] Unknown (Host): That's the best outcome whether we join Adobe or we're independent and
[00:42:54] You know, it's like you can't be in this constant state of word, you know, we're so back it's over
[00:43:00] Unknown (Host): And it's just rapid cycling through that like just your brain falls apart and turns to mush in my opinion
[00:43:07] Unknown (Host): noise for me
[00:43:08] And so the word of the year for me then was like equanimity
[00:43:11] Unknown (Host): I think I said equanimity more times that year
[00:43:14] Unknown (Host): uh
[00:43:15] Unknown (Host): Then I ever will say the rest of my life probably
[00:43:18] But it's just like okay. How do you find peace in every option and know that everything's gonna be okay
[00:43:24] We're building a great company for amazing customers
[00:43:28] And we have a lot of stuff to do. Let's go do it and uh
[00:43:31] Unknown (Host): Whatever happens we're gonna put our best foot forward. It's the contract we signed with Adobe
[00:43:36] And we're gonna make sure that we do everything we can to close this
[00:43:40] Unknown (Host): If it doesn't work out
[00:43:41] Unknown (Host): We'll have a great independent path
[00:43:44] And then you know you get to the end of it and uh, I think
[00:43:48] The relief the team felt at knowing and answer
[00:43:52] Unknown (Host): And having just like this, you know, super-vistual state
[00:43:55] Unknown (Host): Collapse into okay, we know we're gonna be independent like that was real relief. I bet um it was the end of the year
[00:44:03] You know, we found out
[00:44:05] Unknown (Host): as I was about to fly out of his my in-laws and
[00:44:10] I think I was like
[00:44:12] Unknown (Host): hashing through
[00:44:13] Unknown (Host): All the details of how to communicate with the team on like a Saturday night and a Sunday then Monday
[00:44:19] Unknown (Host): We announced that it was not going through
[00:44:22] and and and people had already gone break starting on that Friday
[00:44:26] Unknown (Host): Send a message to this team on Slack like at channel, you know, at fire
[00:44:31] Unknown (Host): press release
[00:44:32] Unknown (Host): and details about like what meant for them and
[00:44:37] And said hey if you want no pressure if you want to join though, here's a zoom call
[00:44:41] Unknown (Host): And we'll be talking about this then and you know, just the relief on the zoom call was like palpable over zoom
[00:44:48] Which was pretty wild just the chat was it makes sense though. It was like a big relief to know and then
[00:44:54] You know the break is going and I'm like okay not everyone is not placed
[00:44:59] Unknown (Host): And so we made a program called detach which is a Figma pun you can detach a component
[00:45:04] Unknown (Host): It's like something that some people frown on
[00:45:07] Unknown (Host): But like it's also a necessary task sometimes and
[00:45:10] Unknown (Host): The idea was just hey look if you don't want to be at Figma. We don't want to trap you
[00:45:16] Here's three months of pay if you decide to leave leave
[00:45:20] Unknown (Host): and
[00:45:21] Unknown (Host): You're still like cool with us work cool with you
[00:45:26] Everything's fine and if you decide to reapply you can't reapply for six months, but then you're welcome to reapply after that
[00:45:32] and
[00:45:33] Unknown (Host): Yeah, you're
[00:45:35] Like there's no issue if you decide to take this and if you don't like FII
[00:45:40] Unknown (Host): We are a hard charging startup. It's gonna be intense. We got a lot to do
[00:45:46] Unknown (Host): Um, and so we rolled us out, you know kind of a nervous few weeks as people made their calls and then
[00:45:51] Unknown (Host): A little over four percent of people took us up on it. What year was that again? That would have been
[00:45:56] I think 2023. Mm-hmm. I have to double check that
[00:45:59] Unknown (Host): I get that dates. I'll confuse sometimes was there any element coinciding there too of like
[00:46:04] Dylan Field: There was like something in the water intact at that time where like
[00:46:09] Dylan Field: Cultural reset was happening at a lot of companies and did that
[00:46:13] Play in any way did it help in any way that that was
[00:46:16] Dylan Field: Going on other places or did it just have a factor in just be clear
[00:46:20] Unknown (Host): I think it was end of 2023 that
[00:46:22] Unknown (Host): We communicated for the first time but like early 2024 that it was the detached program
[00:46:27] um
[00:46:28] Unknown (Host): If I'm accurate there, yeah, and
[00:46:31] I think that um really what we looked at what people were doing and why they decided
[00:46:37] I mean a lot of it was just like you know, I
[00:46:41] I'm tired and a break. Yeah, and uh, I want a lot of people making career changes
[00:46:47] Unknown (Host): I go it's really interesting. I got like early stage or sorry early career sales reps moving over to
[00:46:54] Unknown (Host): uh like politics stuff like that
[00:46:57] Unknown (Host): It's also like a little domain hobby. I bet you for a lot of people
[00:47:00] Dylan Field: It's you know when you like flip a coin
[00:47:02] Dylan Field: Even you don't know what you want you like flip a coin you get tails and then you're like sad
[00:47:05] Dylan Field: You wish it was heads or vice versa
[00:47:07] Dylan Field: There's probably also some people going through that experience with like oh wow
[00:47:11] Dylan Field: I was actually really hoping that we could put a bow on this because I was ready for my next thing well
[00:47:14] Dylan Field: I mean or people got attached to the idea and
[00:47:18] Unknown (Host): Yeah, there's definitely a few people who were you know amazing and
[00:47:22] Unknown (Host): Of course you go talk to the folks that you're like okay. I know you said this but like are you sure? Yeah, and
[00:47:28] Unknown (Host): Their head space was one of okay like guys I get it you're done
[00:47:32] Um at least for now some people boomering back. It's a really great move though because basically you just like
[00:47:38] Dylan Field: Took the situation like on the front foot and rather than just being like oh, let's just see how we do you're like hey
[00:47:44] Dylan Field: You want this like you got to sign up. Yeah, I feel like it's best in general to deal with things and move on
[00:47:50] And so we try to be direct to my communication with people make sure I'm saying queer expectations. Yeah
[00:47:55] Unknown (Host): You know for friends like, you know
[00:47:58] Unknown (Host): Like give what very clear feedback you're always telling bad stuff. Oh my gosh. It's not true
[00:48:04] Unknown (Host): It's not much not much to critique, but the um
[00:48:08] But yeah, I mean
[00:48:09] Unknown (Host): Then from there it was like because we had put our phone the gas entire time
[00:48:13] Unknown (Host): We were able to launch a bunch of product. I mean we doubled our product offering
[00:48:19] Unknown (Host): I can figure recently
[00:48:20] Unknown (Host): Due to the work we did in that period at time we
[00:48:24] Right after the deal was dissolved launched in GA dev mode
[00:48:28] And that was was really really exciting to watch that take off. Yeah
[00:48:32] Unknown (Host): As well as just like countless other product updates the velocity only increased the momentum was real
[00:48:38] Unknown (Host): Yeah, I think lean into it and to acknowledge in it and
[00:48:41] Unknown (Host): Sorry that conversation was part of it. Yeah. Okay on that note
[00:48:44] Dylan Field: I want to go to sort of like the final area which is how you're thinking about just AI impacting
[00:48:49] Sort of your roadmap and your product and maybe you could just even talk about like the things that you've been working on over the last
[00:48:56] Dylan Field: Six or 12 months that you know
[00:48:58] Dylan Field: AI related that I think are sort of most important for figma so much um, I think that
[00:49:04] First of all, you know, it's not just designers in the process although they're the heart of it
[00:49:09] Unknown (Host): The work with developers the work with product managers
[00:49:12] Unknown (Host): and more researchers marketers and
[00:49:15] Unknown (Host): I think that
[00:49:17] Unknown (Host): If you can give developers a good way through mcp to pull context from design
[00:49:22] Unknown (Host): So they can be able to make things faster. It's a win. So we use dev mode mcp
[00:49:27] Unknown (Host): and folks are able to use that with well structured design files to go build the final experience so much faster
[00:49:34] Unknown (Host): It's really wild to see how this works when you actually experience alive
[00:49:39] Unknown (Host): You know, you get a lot of the fun built for you by the AI that can interpret what we said over
[00:49:46] and do inference and it can be just extraordinarily fast
[00:49:50] Unknown (Host): um
[00:49:51] Unknown (Host): We're also thinking a lot about of course
[00:49:53] Unknown (Host): How do we make sure that you're able to have great prompting experiences in
[00:49:58] Unknown (Host): Both think my make but also think my design and think my design and we've teased it is my out yet, but we're really excited about that
[00:50:05] Unknown (Host): um in general
[00:50:06] Unknown (Host): I'd say like it feels like we're kind of in this MS-DOS era of AI
[00:50:11] Unknown (Host): We're we're going to look back in some number of years and go
[00:50:15] Unknown (Host): It's kind of wild that we're just like typing text all that time
[00:50:18] Unknown (Host): There will be some amount of dimensionality collapse into interfaces
[00:50:22] Unknown (Host): and
[00:50:23] You know
[00:50:23] It's also the case. I think for any AI company the strategic question you have to be positive on
[00:50:29] Unknown (Host): Is as models get better to we get better and their answer has to be yes if it's no in some way you got to readjust strategy
[00:50:38] in wait October as you know, we announced we be
[00:50:42] Unknown (Host): now if it may weave
[00:50:43] Unknown (Host): And this is an acquisition made that I think really met meets these attributes and I am so excited about
[00:50:49] Unknown (Host): Basically it makes it so you can use all these different generative models for image video
[00:50:53] Unknown (Host): Transform across modalities like image or 3e for example and you can then connect them in a node-based workflow
[00:51:02] Unknown (Host): Use it to creatively explore or also create a pipeline
[00:51:06] Unknown (Host): make process and
[00:51:08] Unknown (Host): The things we're seeing people do with it are just so cool and wild and expressive and
[00:51:14] Unknown (Host): I guess like overall it's ultimately reflect a lot because
[00:51:18] Unknown (Host): A lot of people call the output of these models slop
[00:51:21] Unknown (Host): So almost like a derogatory term and
[00:51:24] And you know without making any comment on slop versus not slop
[00:51:28] Unknown (Host): I mean some things like see us out of some like wow it's amazing
[00:51:31] But I think the more important point is like
[00:51:34] Whatever you start with it's starting point and you can use that in a workflow to get to something amazing
[00:51:40] Unknown (Host): Your own craft yeah, and I think with weave that's what we're seeing is just this incredible way that artists and creatives can go and
[00:51:48] Unknown (Host): Create all sorts of different types of multimedia generation
[00:51:51] Unknown (Host): And then also use it across the Figma platform
[00:51:54] Unknown (Host): And some really really excited we're doing there and just the fact that they trusted us to join up
[00:52:00] And what we can do in the future as you add more and more AI into the product
[00:52:04] Dylan Field: What do you
[00:52:06] Dylan Field: What do you think is like the final bastion of like human designers? Will it be
[00:52:10] Dylan Field: Taste coordination? What will the set of things be that you're most confident in like will always be just like human tasks?
[00:52:19] I mean, I think that um
[00:52:22] We are so far away from AI replacing designers
[00:52:27] Unknown (Host): uh
[00:52:28] And
[00:52:29] Unknown (Host): If you actually look at the designs generated. I think it's very easy to tell that
[00:52:34] Unknown (Host): But even if the design generation from this that I stand for is better
[00:52:38] Like it's not considering the entire system
[00:52:42] It's not considering all the constraints
[00:52:44] Unknown (Host): You're not exploring the full option space you're not thinking about like
[00:52:49] Unknown (Host): The context culturally
[00:52:51] You're not thinking about the business problems you have to solve or the greater system that connects
[00:52:56] Unknown (Host): Uh, everything that's all these different targets across all these different
[00:53:00] Experiences you're trying to create
[00:53:02] You're not thinking about the emotional quality you're trying to create in the brand and how that gets pulled in
[00:53:06] Unknown (Host): I'm just so much and the best designers are able to take all these different inputs
[00:53:11] Unknown (Host): And then be able to explore out very
[00:53:14] Unknown (Host): dense and uh deep trees of possibility to figure out what is the best approach
[00:53:20] Systematically and then go build on it and I don't know it's like um
[00:53:26] One example I go through a lot that resonates with the Gen Z people binoculars or
[00:53:31] Unknown (Host): Folks that are older always is brat summer. Hmm. You know brat summer, right? Oh brat summer. Yes, brat summer
[00:53:38] SPEAKER_00: Of course to see you're you got a Brad summer. I was like this brat summer. Yeah, no, Brad
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we can talk about Brad summer later. Yeah, Brad summer school anyway brat summer and uh
[00:53:47] Unknown (Host): You know, I use brat summer as an example a lot because
[00:53:51] Unknown (Host): What I think about it right like the album cover obviously not just the album cover but as a design artifact
[00:53:56] Unknown (Host): Line green square I think it was what come of sand or something that was really brilliant. Yeah, what ASI
[00:54:03] Unknown (Host): Uh, you know
[00:54:05] Unknown (Host): Designer would create brat summer. I don't know. I mean or if they did it would be one out of a hundred thousand
[00:54:12] Dylan Field: And no way it would be thrown behind it
[00:54:14] Dylan Field: Because I think that's the other piece of design is it's not just the artifact. It's knowing this is good
[00:54:19] Dylan Field: And you know, we're gonna put the right sort of message behind it and so for aesthetic
[00:54:25] Unknown (Host): I mean the ability to go
[00:54:27] Think of all the possibilities in the world and end up on that album cover
[00:54:31] Like you put me in a room for a hundred years. I don't think I would come up with that
[00:54:35] Unknown (Host): I definitely wouldn't yeah and on the other hand of it
[00:54:38] Unknown (Host): There are extreme. It's like okay. What about usability? What about
[00:54:42] Hierarchy? What about the ability to think about the different permutations of the way you take a day a model
[00:54:48] Unknown (Host): Express it through UI. Yeah, and allow people to actually control an interface and what affordances to use and which ones to get rid of and
[00:54:54] Unknown (Host): Innovate on and go find new ways to do something that are out of distribution
[00:54:57] Unknown (Host): Yeah, like I think that the role of a designer is
[00:55:01] Unknown (Host): Point be one where AI makes it so that they are
[00:55:04] Unknown (Host): able to get rid of the drudgery
[00:55:07] They won't have to
[00:55:08] Unknown (Host): Engage with repetitive tasks anymore
[00:55:11] Unknown (Host): Instead, they'll be able to be like really
[00:55:14] Thinking more holistically thinking further and going going to beyond
[00:55:19] Unknown (Host): And I think it'll lead to an explosion of creativity explosion of really interesting amazing outputs. Yeah, and I'm pretty excited for it
[00:55:26] Unknown (Host): You know, I think the same thing that you just described is true with music
[00:55:30] Dylan Field: Where obviously AI music sounds pretty good
[00:55:34] Dylan Field: But I still think like these albums that like take over a summer or just like a song that captures everybody like
[00:55:41] Dylan Field: I just there's something like more like soulful that has to be captured that I just don't think we're there yet
[00:55:47] Dylan Field: well, I also think it's possible that like on the music side
[00:55:52] Unknown (Host): AI generated music can inspire an artist
[00:55:55] Unknown (Host): To go and riff on that and inspiration can come from anywhere for sure

[00:56:04] Unknown (Host): It's also a great tool to figure out what you not want to do like I never use AI for writing personally
[00:56:09] Unknown (Host): I find it doesn't capture voice
[00:56:11] Unknown (Host): But I love asking AI

[00:56:20] Dylan Field: and
[00:56:21] Unknown (Host): I don't know I think that just like
[00:56:23] Unknown (Host): We're the more we capture the distribution that exists today
[00:56:27] the more we can think outside of it
[00:56:29] And that's human creativity. Yeah, I love it. Don't this is super fun. Thanks for having me. Yeah, great to see you as always you too
