[00:00:00] I always tell defense tech companies this,
[00:00:01] Trae Stephens: it's like, this is not the field of dreams.
[00:00:03] Trae Stephens: If you build it, they do not come.
[00:00:05] Trae Stephens: That's not how it works.
[00:00:06] Trae Stephens: Like if you build a perpetual motion machine
[00:00:09] Trae Stephens: and the point of the perpetual motion machine
[00:00:11] Trae Stephens: is like powering forward operating bases,
[00:00:13] Trae Stephens: you go to the Department of War and you say,
[00:00:15] Trae Stephens: I have built you a perpetual motion machine
[00:00:18] Trae Stephens: and I will sell it to you for a million dollars.
[00:00:20] Trae Stephens: They would, okay, we're gonna bid this out to market
[00:00:23] Trae Stephens: and we're gonna lock you Martin a $100 billion contract
[00:00:27] Trae Stephens: to rebuild from white paper
[00:00:29] Trae Stephens: your perpetual motion machine.
[00:00:30] Trae Stephens: That's how it works.
[00:00:32] Trey, I'm really happy to be doing this
[00:00:33] Jack Altman: with you. Thanks for making time for it.
[00:00:35] Jack Altman: Great to be here.
[00:00:36] Jack Altman: I wanna start with you wrote a blog post
[00:00:38] Jack Altman: a couple years ago, I think good, hard quests
[00:00:39] Jack Altman: or good, choose good quests.
[00:00:41] Jack Altman: That really stuck with me.
[00:00:43] Jack Altman: And I think in many ways we're in a moment in time right now
[00:00:45] Jack Altman: where people are sort of grappling with like
[00:00:47] Jack Altman: what that means in the world of AI.
[00:00:49] Jack Altman: And I think both because of like the technology itself,
[00:00:53] Jack Altman: which like creates all these like weird,
[00:00:55] Jack Altman: what does it mean to be human,
[00:00:56] Jack Altman: what part of the experience actually matters?
[00:00:58] Jack Altman: It like creates like a lot of odd questions.
[00:01:00] Jack Altman: Then you also get these like gold rush dynamics
[00:01:02] Jack Altman: where like money's flowing
[00:01:04] Jack Altman: and you can start a company quickly
[00:01:05] Jack Altman: and there's like a lot of get rich quick ideas.
[00:01:07] Jack Altman: And so I think for a lot of reasons
[00:01:09] Jack Altman: this blog post is like super relevant right now.
[00:01:11] Jack Altman: And I'll just be curious to hear how you think
[00:01:13] Jack Altman: about this concept of like choosing good quests
[00:01:17] Jack Altman: like when we're in the middle of something like AI.
[00:01:20] Jack Altman: Yeah, you know, I think the distorting characteristics of AI
[00:01:25] Trae Stephens: have less to do with the ability to do interesting
[00:01:28] Trae Stephens: hard things and it has much more to do with how easy it is
[00:01:31] Trae Stephens: to do uninteresting, unhard things.
[00:01:35] Trae Stephens: You know, there's the constant conversation
[00:01:36] Trae Stephens: that comes up about like the first company
[00:01:38] Trae Stephens: to a billion dollar valuation with one employee.
[00:01:41] Trae Stephens: It is possible to do that.
[00:01:42] Trae Stephens: But what that means is that all of these people
[00:01:45] Trae Stephens: that are coming out of college
[00:01:46] Trae Stephens: or that have aspirations to be founders,
[00:01:49] Trae Stephens: you know, they're doing like whiteboard founding.
[00:01:50] Trae Stephens: You know, they're walking up to a whiteboard,
[00:01:52] Trae Stephens: they're writing down 100 different ideas.
[00:01:55] Trae Stephens: Many of them are just like using the, you know,
[00:01:58] Trae Stephens: LLM APIs to do some highly specific task
[00:02:02] Trae Stephens: or something like that.
[00:02:03] Trae Stephens: And then as they enter the market,
[00:02:05] Trae Stephens: there's, you know, dozens of competitors
[00:02:08] Trae Stephens: and it's kind of like a battle to the death
[00:02:10] Trae Stephens: in like a really highly consensus category.
[00:02:13] Trae Stephens: And that's kind of what I would say is the opposite
[00:02:16] Trae Stephens: of a good quest, like going into something
[00:02:18] Trae Stephens: because you can try to generate wealth
[00:02:21] Trae Stephens: as your primary motivation, not super interesting.
[00:02:25] Trae Stephens: It's sort of akin to like a celebrity
[00:02:27] Trae Stephens: starting at Tequila Company
[00:02:29] Trae Stephens: where they're just monetizing their own personal brand.
[00:02:32] Trae Stephens: One of those sort of frames I've heard
[00:02:33] Jack Altman: just talking to founders that I think about this
[00:02:35] Jack Altman: is that we're like in a moment
[00:02:36] Jack Altman: where there are a lot of ideas
[00:02:37] Jack Altman: that both seem good and are good
[00:02:39] Jack Altman: as a result of kind of like there's a big new technology.
[00:02:41] Jack Altman: And so you have a lot of these like blue ocean areas
[00:02:44] Jack Altman: which are like, you know, kind of rare to have that.
[00:02:47] Jack Altman: And so then you have all these people thinking,
[00:02:49] Jack Altman: well, yeah, like it's kind of consensus,
[00:02:51] Jack Altman: but no one's done it yet
[00:02:52] Jack Altman: because like the wine now just happened.
[00:02:54] Jack Altman: And so I see people grappling with that
[00:02:56] Jack Altman: and they're like, it's not exactly bad for anybody.
[00:02:59] Jack Altman: It's like a thing that auto exists,
[00:03:00] Jack Altman: but to your point, there's like 19 of them going
[00:03:02] Jack Altman: at the same time.
[00:03:03] Jack Altman: It's a weird sort of dynamic.
[00:03:05] Yeah, and you know, maybe some of these things
[00:03:07] Trae Stephens: are worth building and people are gonna make
[00:03:09] Trae Stephens: a bunch of money on it
[00:03:10] Trae Stephens: and that's not bad in and of itself.
[00:03:12] Trae Stephens: The question is like an opportunity cost question
[00:03:14] Trae Stephens: in my mind.
[00:03:15] Trae Stephens: It's like for our most talented people,
[00:03:17] Trae Stephens: you know, if you think of like every person
[00:03:19] Trae Stephens: in the tech ecosystem as like a Dungeons and Dragons character
[00:03:22] Trae Stephens: and they have like a skill set
[00:03:24] Trae Stephens: and they have ratings for different characteristics,
[00:03:27] Trae Stephens: if we take all of our level 100 players
[00:03:30] Trae Stephens: and we put them on AI slot companies,
[00:03:33] Trae Stephens: what does that mean for all of the things
[00:03:35] Trae Stephens: that aren't being done at the same time?
[00:03:37] Trae Stephens: I would really like our level 100 wizards
[00:03:39] Trae Stephens: to be fabricating semiconductors
[00:03:42] Trae Stephens: or you know, something that's gonna move the needle
[00:03:43] Trae Stephens: for humanity.
[00:03:44] Trae Stephens: And so it has sort of this distracting distortion effect
[00:03:48] Trae Stephens: rather than necessarily being bad.
[00:03:50] Trae Stephens: This kind of happened during like crypto booms,
[00:03:52] Jack Altman: you know, like when people just sort of like get lost
[00:03:54] Jack Altman: and sort of like, oh my God,
[00:03:55] Jack Altman: there's so much money being made here that it's very tempting
[00:03:59] Jack Altman: and you get a lot of people that go there.
[00:04:01] Yeah, and then over time,
[00:04:02] Trae Stephens: that kind of worked itself out in crypto, I would say,
[00:04:05] Trae Stephens: but it's less clear that that's what would happen
[00:04:07] Trae Stephens: in the AI moment.
[00:04:09] Jack Altman: There's also a genre with AI
[00:04:10] Jack Altman: where it's less this area of like it's a straightforward thing
[00:04:13] Jack Altman: with 20 companies working on the same problem.
[00:04:16] Jack Altman: But there's these types of AI companies
[00:04:17] Jack Altman: that I think like get close to people's sense
[00:04:20] Jack Altman: of like where are the moral boundaries?
[00:04:22] Jack Altman: Like what does it mean to be human?
[00:04:24] Jack Altman: And you know, like I think there's these things
[00:04:26] Jack Altman: that people have a lot of very negative
[00:04:28] Jack Altman: visceral reactions to.
[00:04:30] Jack Altman: You know, I recently saw like, you know,
[00:04:32] Jack Altman: a post about a company that sort of brings sort of like,
[00:04:35] Jack Altman: you know, deceased loved ones to sort of life
[00:04:37] Jack Altman: and some kind of form.
[00:04:38] Jack Altman: And on one hand, you're like,
[00:04:40] Jack Altman: I guess that kind of makes sense
[00:04:41] Jack Altman: that could be comforting for people on another hand.
[00:04:43] Jack Altman: Like there was a lot of kind of, you know,
[00:04:45] Jack Altman: sort of like a visceral disgust reactional
[00:04:47] Jack Altman: and people were having that sort of like cross-deline
[00:04:49] Jack Altman: for people.
[00:04:50] Jack Altman: How do you think about these things that sort of like
[00:04:53] Jack Altman: that feel bad on first glance
[00:04:54] Jack Altman: but are sort of exploring the edges?
[00:04:57] Jack Altman: Like are those quests that are good that look bad
[00:04:59] Jack Altman: or how do you know?
[00:05:00] Trae Stephens: The key question with companies like this,
[00:05:03] Trae Stephens: which there's like literally a black-nure episode
[00:05:05] Trae Stephens: that exists about this topic of bringing back deceased loved ones.
[00:05:09] Trae Stephens: I lost my dad in 2013 to Alzheimer's
[00:05:11] Trae Stephens: and you know, I would love to talk to my dad.
[00:05:13] Trae Stephens: That would be awesome.
[00:05:14] Trae Stephens: Like every time I buy a car,
[00:05:16] Trae Stephens: it's like, who do I talk to?
[00:05:18] Trae Stephens: I end up talking to like my co-founders that Androle about it.
[00:05:21] Trae Stephens: But I would love to talk to my dad.
[00:05:22] Trae Stephens: That would be super cool.
[00:05:23] Trae Stephens: But I think the challenge behind these things
[00:05:25] Trae Stephens: is like what happens to interpersonal relationships?
[00:05:28] Trae Stephens: And this has started long before AI.
[00:05:31] Trae Stephens: If you look at online dating as an example of this,
[00:05:33] Trae Stephens: long before AI, you realize as a society
[00:05:36] Trae Stephens: that like the way that we pair off
[00:05:38] Trae Stephens: is going to look super different.
[00:05:39] Trae Stephens: Like in, you know, decades past,
[00:05:42] Trae Stephens: it was done locally and like a local minima.
[00:05:45] Trae Stephens: It was like, you know, you met people at school
[00:05:47] Trae Stephens: or you met people at church
[00:05:49] Trae Stephens: or you met people professionally in a workplace.
[00:05:52] Trae Stephens: And you were able to measure, you know,
[00:05:55] Trae Stephens: the fidelity of a match across a number of characteristics.
[00:05:58] Trae Stephens: Like this person is funny.
[00:05:59] Trae Stephens: This person is charming.
[00:06:01] Trae Stephens: This person is romantic.
[00:06:02] Trae Stephens: This person is talented, ambitious, smart.
[00:06:05] Trae Stephens: And now if you look at the way that the sorting is happening,
[00:06:07] Trae Stephens: it's done on the shallowest possible measures.
[00:06:10] Trae Stephens: It's like men over six foot two get 80% of the matches.
[00:06:14] Trae Stephens: I'm sure that there's a lot of really talented,
[00:06:17] Trae Stephens: charming, well matched, matchable people
[00:06:19] Trae Stephens: that are less than six foot two,
[00:06:21] Trae Stephens: but they don't get any of the right swipes.
[00:06:23] Trae Stephens: And so we've created this entire like social demographic
[00:06:27] Trae Stephens: of in-sales that historically,
[00:06:30] Trae Stephens: if you look back over the course of human civilization,
[00:06:32] Trae Stephens: have been the powder keg for implosions of societies.
[00:06:36] Trae Stephens: Like you don't want to have a bunch of young,
[00:06:39] Trae Stephens: 20 something single men that are under employed
[00:06:42] Trae Stephens: running around in your economy.
[00:06:44] Trae Stephens: It doesn't, doesn't bode well.
[00:06:46] Trae Stephens: And you add AI on top of that now,
[00:06:49] Trae Stephens: where you have like people that can talk
[00:06:51] Trae Stephens: with their deceased loved ones,
[00:06:52] Trae Stephens: but also they can talk with AI companions.
[00:06:54] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:06:55] Trae Stephens: And they find that they have this very low risk,
[00:06:59] Trae Stephens: very low probability of disagreement,
[00:07:03] Trae Stephens: companion that basically acknowledges and affirms
[00:07:05] Trae Stephens: whatever they want them to acknowledge and affirm.
[00:07:08] Trae Stephens: Well, that becomes much easier
[00:07:09] Trae Stephens: than the complicated dynamics of a real human relationship.
[00:07:13] Trae Stephens: And then what does that do to the way that our society
[00:07:16] Trae Stephens: sustains a birth rate at a very basic level?
[00:07:19] Trae Stephens: But beyond that, what happens when you have unmatched people
[00:07:23] Trae Stephens: at numbers that society has never seen before?
[00:07:26] Trae Stephens: What impact does that have?
[00:07:27] Trae Stephens: It's sort of interesting when you think about this,
[00:07:29] Jack Altman: I like your framing of dungeons and dragons,
[00:07:31] Jack Altman: because it makes us all feel like we're on one team.
[00:07:34] Jack Altman: And it's like, how do you want to deploy resources?
[00:07:35] Jack Altman: How would you think about like,
[00:07:37] Jack Altman: there's a one category of like company idea
[00:07:39] Jack Altman: that's like, let's bring back deceased loved ones
[00:07:41] Jack Altman: where you're like, ooh, that's weird.
[00:07:43] Jack Altman: I don't know what to make of that,
[00:07:44] Jack Altman: but it's new and it's weird and like, there's that.
[00:07:46] Jack Altman: And then there's like maybe a category
[00:07:47] Jack Altman: that like more or less everybody would agree is bad.
[00:07:50] Jack Altman: And you know, like there's things
[00:07:51] Jack Altman: that you could probably profit off of
[00:07:53] Jack Altman: that just like are not unclear like that,
[00:07:56] Jack Altman: but are like definitively bad.
[00:07:58] Jack Altman: Do you have any way that you think about sort of like
[00:08:00] Jack Altman: what ought to be explored,
[00:08:02] Jack Altman: even if it feels uncomfortable?
[00:08:03] Jack Altman: Well, yeah, I mean, I traditionally have thought about this
[00:08:05] Trae Stephens: as like on a two by two matrix.
[00:08:06] Trae Stephens: Where you have like feels bad feels good on one axis
[00:08:09] Trae Stephens: and then is good is bad on the other.
[00:08:11] Trae Stephens: Like everyone kind of agrees in the diagonal
[00:08:14] Trae Stephens: of feels good is good.
[00:08:15] Trae Stephens: It's like do good or stuff, edtech, health tech, whatever.
[00:08:18] Trae Stephens: That's like super obvious.
[00:08:19] Trae Stephens: And then the feels bad is bad.
[00:08:21] Trae Stephens: Like things that are illegal, like murder theft,
[00:08:25] Trae Stephens: cheating, whatever.
[00:08:26] Trae Stephens: Yeah, we can all kind of agree on that.
[00:08:27] Trae Stephens: It's the other diagonal that's interesting.
[00:08:29] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:08:30] Trae Stephens: And the feels bad is good.
[00:08:32] Trae Stephens: I would argue it's kind of where Andral lives.
[00:08:34] Trae Stephens: It's this duty and responsibility.
[00:08:36] Trae Stephens: Like things that you have to do,
[00:08:37] Trae Stephens: not because you want to glorify those things,
[00:08:40] Trae Stephens: but because they're really important for a functioning society.
[00:08:43] Trae Stephens: That's like everything from disciplining children
[00:08:45] Trae Stephens: to law and order inside of society
[00:08:48] Trae Stephens: or defense of a nation or something like that.
[00:08:50] Trae Stephens: Then you have that other category,
[00:08:52] Trae Stephens: the quadrant of feels good is bad.
[00:08:56] Trae Stephens: And this is like sort of the edgy stuff
[00:08:58] Trae Stephens: that you're talking about.
[00:08:59] Trae Stephens: Like gambling, pornography,
[00:09:01] Trae Stephens: sort of what I would call like hedonism.
[00:09:04] Trae Stephens: And there's always arguments you can make
[00:09:05] Trae Stephens: about a libertarian society.
[00:09:07] Trae Stephens: Like we should allow people free expression.
[00:09:10] Trae Stephens: We should allow drug use to some extent.
[00:09:13] Trae Stephens: But then you can also look at the negative impacts
[00:09:16] Trae Stephens: on a society of these things
[00:09:17] Trae Stephens: and have to make hard decisions about
[00:09:19] Trae Stephens: how you're going to build policies
[00:09:22] Trae Stephens: around whether or not these things should exist.
[00:09:24] Trae Stephens: Because a lot of them are highly addictive.
[00:09:26] Trae Stephens: And like that, those can be really good businesses.
[00:09:29] Trae Stephens: And this policy basically the only answer to that quadrant.
[00:09:31] Jack Altman: People are going to build companies
[00:09:32] Jack Altman: that they can build that are profitable within the rules.
[00:09:35] Jack Altman: And the vices are always going to make money.
[00:09:37] Jack Altman: 100%.
[00:09:38] Trae Stephens: You could look at the most extreme example of this
[00:09:40] Trae Stephens: is like if fentanyl was legal in the United States,
[00:09:42] Trae Stephens: there would be a massive company
[00:09:44] Trae Stephens: that just sold very low cost fentanyl.
[00:09:47] Trae Stephens: Sure.
[00:09:48] Trae Stephens: It would be a huge company.
[00:09:49] Trae Stephens: So yeah, policy is probably the only way
[00:09:51] Trae Stephens: that you can really address those problems.
[00:09:52] Trae Stephens: And then it's interesting.
[00:09:54] Jack Altman: Some of the things that look like gambling,
[00:09:57] Jack Altman: you don't know whether things are in the really bad quadrant
[00:10:00] Jack Altman: or actually they're in this sort of new exploratory quadrant.
[00:10:04] Jack Altman: Like prediction markets,
[00:10:05] Jack Altman: like I was talking to Vlad,
[00:10:07] Jack Altman: on on Cap recently.
[00:10:08] Jack Altman: And he's making good points about how
[00:10:10] Jack Altman: the prediction markets actually also allow you
[00:10:12] Jack Altman: to bet on specific things that are narrow.
[00:10:16] Jack Altman: They allow for market sort of true price discovery
[00:10:20] Jack Altman: to happen on business.
[00:10:21] Jack Altman: Not to mention that.
[00:10:21] Jack Altman: Also underwriting.
[00:10:22] Jack Altman: Yeah.
[00:10:23] Jack Altman: There's a lot that you can benefit from.
[00:10:24] Jack Altman: Big to some of those.
[00:10:25] Jack Altman: Yeah.
[00:10:25] Jack Altman: So some of these newer things that are teetering on the edge,
[00:10:29] Jack Altman: it's like you do want some of that stuff to get explored too.
[00:10:32] Trae Stephens: Well, I mean, the nature of policy development
[00:10:34] Trae Stephens: is always like the thing develops in real time.
[00:10:37] Trae Stephens: And then you build policy to constrain and control
[00:10:40] Trae Stephens: the negative societal impacts.
[00:10:42] Trae Stephens: And this is why the way that AI company is engaged
[00:10:45] Trae Stephens: with Capital Hill, it's not like Capital Hill
[00:10:48] Trae Stephens: is going to be the smartest people on AI.
[00:10:50] Trae Stephens: And they're going to walk in and they're
[00:10:51] Trae Stephens: going to lay all the groundwork for how it's going to be.
[00:10:54] Trae Stephens: It's not going to work like that.
[00:10:56] Trae Stephens: I think there are two people in all of Congress
[00:10:59] Trae Stephens: that have computer science degrees.
[00:11:00] Trae Stephens: And they all got those degrees long before AI was so good.
[00:11:03] Trae Stephens: I guess they would have been studying.
[00:11:05] Trae Stephens: Most of these are like lifelong career civil servants
[00:11:08] Trae Stephens: have no idea how technology works.
[00:11:11] Trae Stephens: Realistically, what's going to happen is AI is going
[00:11:13] Trae Stephens: to build, build, build boundaries will be crossed
[00:11:15] Trae Stephens: that we realize as a society have negative implications.
[00:11:19] Trae Stephens: And then in a well functioning democracy,
[00:11:22] Trae Stephens: you build guard rails for those things.
[00:11:24] Trae Stephens: Now the well functioning democracy thing,
[00:11:25] Trae Stephens: we could have a whole conversation about.
[00:11:26] Trae Stephens: But that is ideally how it should work.
[00:11:28] Trae Stephens: I mean, well, you're working with DC a lot of this point
[00:11:30] Jack Altman: through Andrewl.
[00:11:31] Jack Altman: I mean, I guess implicitly what you're saying
[00:11:33] Jack Altman: is the right way for regulation to go is let the technology
[00:11:35] Jack Altman: develop to some degree and then start regulating
[00:11:37] Jack Altman: once you're observing things, right?
[00:11:39] Trae Stephens: How does that play out for Andrewl?
[00:11:41] Jack Altman: What does that experience like?
[00:11:43] Jack Altman: Because obviously there's a ton of regulation going on there.
[00:11:45] Jack Altman: What is the way like a new prime should like ought to get built?
[00:11:49] Yeah, I mean, luckily, like defense policy
[00:11:51] Trae Stephens: is the most bipartisan of really any category, which is funny,
[00:11:55] Trae Stephens: because in Silicon Valley, most people
[00:11:57] Trae Stephens: wouldn't think of it that way.
[00:11:58] Trae Stephens: They'd be like, wow, this is really edgy stuff.
[00:12:00] Trae Stephens: But then the National Defense Authorization Act passes
[00:12:02] Trae Stephens: with a super majority.
[00:12:03] Trae Stephens: For sure.
[00:12:04] Trae Stephens: Like it's like the only bill that passes.
[00:12:05] Trae Stephens: I do always think that like people think it's person,
[00:12:07] Jack Altman: but like at the end of the day, like people
[00:12:10] Jack Altman: are reasonable in government and everyone's a safe country.
[00:12:12] Jack Altman: Yes, exactly.
[00:12:13] Jack Altman: Which is one thing I very much appreciate.
[00:12:14] Jack Altman: Yeah, there's not a whole lot of partisan debate
[00:12:17] Trae Stephens: on these topics.
[00:12:18] Trae Stephens: But that also means that they're usually way out ahead
[00:12:21] Trae Stephens: of regulations.
[00:12:22] Trae Stephens: Like a lot of the existing law in the books
[00:12:25] Trae Stephens: around autonomy and artificial intelligence actually
[00:12:27] Trae Stephens: started in the defense community.
[00:12:30] Trae Stephens: There have been commissions on studying
[00:12:32] Trae Stephens: that how AI is going to be leveraged and active warfare.
[00:12:36] Trae Stephens: We've had autonomous systems for decades.
[00:12:39] Trae Stephens: There's a turret system called CWIS,
[00:12:42] Trae Stephens: close in support for naval vessels
[00:12:45] Trae Stephens: that is basically like a machine gun
[00:12:49] Trae Stephens: that shoots inbound threats to vessels to ships.
[00:12:54] Trae Stephens: And there's no human controlling this,
[00:12:55] Trae Stephens: aiming at the aerial targets or anything.
[00:12:57] Trae Stephens: It just identifies a threat.
[00:12:59] Trae Stephens: You say engage the threat.
[00:13:00] Trae Stephens: And then CWIS takes over and will shoot down
[00:13:03] Trae Stephens: the missile or the aircraft or whatever it is.
[00:13:05] Trae Stephens: So autonomy has existed for a long time.
[00:13:07] Trae Stephens: The law behind how that stuff is supposed to be utilized
[00:13:12] Trae Stephens: has existed inside of the defense community
[00:13:15] Trae Stephens: throughout that entire period.
[00:13:16] Trae Stephens: So I think, you know, Andrew has the benefit of kind of being
[00:13:20] Trae Stephens: on the edge of that and helping our lawmakers
[00:13:23] Trae Stephens: make decisions about how we're going
[00:13:25] Trae Stephens: to leverage these new technologies.
[00:13:27] Trae Stephens: But not in a way that's like defensive.
[00:13:30] Trae Stephens: There's not a conversation that we're having.
[00:13:31] Trae Stephens: There's like a really toxic debate going on about these things
[00:13:36] Trae Stephens: because a lot of that law has been bubbling for a while.
[00:13:38] Trae Stephens: You were talking about how like, you know,
[00:13:40] Jack Altman: Andrew and many ways this in the like,
[00:13:42] Jack Altman: seems bad is good quadrant.
[00:13:44] Jack Altman: But, you know, obviously government
[00:13:46] Jack Altman: didn't feel that way about it.
[00:13:47] Jack Altman: Like, government seems good as good.
[00:13:49] Jack Altman: Maybe in like Silicon Valley, it was, you know,
[00:13:51] Jack Altman: in the other quadrant.
[00:13:52] Jack Altman: Like, what was your experience?
[00:13:53] Jack Altman: I think this is like maybe flipped now,
[00:13:55] Jack Altman: but like five, six years ago, maybe like the tone was different.
[00:13:58] Jack Altman: And so like, we're used sort of like having to convince a lot
[00:14:01] Jack Altman: of people in Silicon Valley that like, actually,
[00:14:02] Jack Altman: this is a good thing.
[00:14:03] Jack Altman: Yeah, I mean, you probably remember Google pulled out
[00:14:06] Trae Stephens: of a federal contract called Project Maven.
[00:14:09] Trae Stephens: And there was thousands of people signed a letter criticizing
[00:14:13] Trae Stephens: the employer for supporting this.
[00:14:16] Trae Stephens: And it was kind of a cultural moment
[00:14:18] Trae Stephens: where it was really not okay to be working
[00:14:21] Trae Stephens: with the defense department.
[00:14:23] Trae Stephens: Yeah, there's some like partisan reasons for this, you know,
[00:14:26] Trae Stephens: at the time Trump was president,
[00:14:28] Trae Stephens: I think people were mostly upset
[00:14:30] Trae Stephens: about Trump being president rather than any particular,
[00:14:33] Trae Stephens: like specific policy that was being employed.
[00:14:36] Trae Stephens: But Andrew will never really encountered any of those headwinds
[00:14:39] Trae Stephens: in Washington.
[00:14:40] Trae Stephens: All of those headwinds were like recruiting conversations.
[00:14:43] Trae Stephens: Like, why is this important?
[00:14:44] Trae Stephens: Are we able to articulate how what we're doing is like,
[00:14:47] Trae Stephens: an advancement of just worth theory,
[00:14:49] Trae Stephens: not a destruction of just worth theory?
[00:14:51] Trae Stephens: And we've been very open since the beginning
[00:14:53] Trae Stephens: and engaging in that conversation proactively.
[00:14:55] Trae Stephens: So I was like an interesting thing.
[00:14:56] Jack Altman: Like sometimes I'll like see a clip of some like,
[00:14:59] Jack Altman: you know, somebody in the middle, it's like active duty,
[00:15:01] Jack Altman: it's like talking about like how they know
[00:15:03] Jack Altman: that like a lot of the people they're protecting,
[00:15:05] Jack Altman: like hate what they're doing,
[00:15:06] Jack Altman: but like they're like my job to protect anyway.
[00:15:08] Jack Altman: It's like a weird thing where you're like, you know,
[00:15:10] Jack Altman: that tension of people who sort of like love
[00:15:13] Jack Altman: what they get out of the military, but don't like it.
[00:15:16] Jack Altman: It's a, that's like a weird thing to grapple with.
[00:15:18] Jack Altman: I think this is like the longstanding nature of the,
[00:15:22] Trae Stephens: you know, the professional soldier is this idea
[00:15:25] Trae Stephens: that in the United States, you know,
[00:15:27] Trae Stephens: they're protecting your First Amendment right
[00:15:30] Trae Stephens: to not like what they're doing.
[00:15:32] Trae Stephens: And it turns out that you can only be a pacifist
[00:15:35] Trae Stephens: inside of a geopolitical system
[00:15:38] Trae Stephens: where the government has monopoly on power
[00:15:40] Trae Stephens: on the use of violence.
[00:15:41] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:15:42] Trae Stephens: Like you can't be a pacifist in a like a real
[00:15:44] Trae Stephens: polity cassence.
[00:15:45] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:15:46] Trae Stephens: If the government doesn't have a monopoly on power,
[00:15:48] Trae Stephens: but it doesn't work.
[00:15:50] Trae Stephens: I find this like this perspective,
[00:15:52] Jack Altman: like it's purely frustrating,
[00:15:53] Jack Altman: but now I'm thinking a lot of like,
[00:15:55] Jack Altman: is there like a reframe I should have
[00:15:57] Jack Altman: that it's actually like,
[00:15:58] Jack Altman: like do we want a certain percentage of the population
[00:16:01] Jack Altman: to like dislike the military in the war?
[00:16:04] Jack Altman: Does that do anything valuable?
[00:16:06] Jack Altman: I think it's great.
[00:16:07] Trae Stephens: I mean, I think it's really important to test hypotheses,
[00:16:11] Trae Stephens: to test ethics, to test our politicians,
[00:16:14] Trae Stephens: to make sure that they're thinking about hard issues,
[00:16:17] Trae Stephens: ethical issues.
[00:16:18] Trae Stephens: You know, at any time there's some debate about how
[00:16:20] Trae Stephens: the Department of War like executed some policy strategy,
[00:16:24] Trae Stephens: whether it's towards like, you know,
[00:16:25] Trae Stephens: Venezuela and drug boats,
[00:16:27] Trae Stephens: or taking out known terrorists in foreign countries
[00:16:30] Trae Stephens: with, you know, predators and Amnit X's
[00:16:32] Trae Stephens: and things like that.
[00:16:33] Trae Stephens: I want that debate to happen
[00:16:35] Trae Stephens: because that's how we get to good policy.
[00:16:37] Trae Stephens: If that was absent,
[00:16:38] Trae Stephens: everybody was just like,
[00:16:39] Trae Stephens: let's throw in our cowboy hats
[00:16:41] Trae Stephens: and swing our lassoes in the air
[00:16:43] Trae Stephens: and go take on the world.
[00:16:44] Trae Stephens: That's how you get to team America world police.
[00:16:46] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:16:47] Trae Stephens: And I don't think that's what any of us really want
[00:16:49] Trae Stephens: at our deep down.
[00:16:50] Trae Stephens: That's why I love the debate.
[00:16:52] Trae Stephens: I think it's really important.
[00:16:53] Trae Stephens: What does Andrew need to do like from where it is now
[00:16:56] Jack Altman: to like giving to, you know,
[00:16:57] Jack Altman: the scale that you want to be to?
[00:16:58] Jack Altman: It seems like from, you know,
[00:17:00] Jack Altman: at least the outside,
[00:17:01] Jack Altman: you've, you have de-risked and proven so much,
[00:17:04] Jack Altman: but I'm sure there's still like a lot in front of you
[00:17:06] Jack Altman: to like get up to the size and scale that like,
[00:17:08] Jack Altman: you know, you could be operating that.
[00:17:09] Jack Altman: So like what's now?
[00:17:11] Yeah, it's all about production.
[00:17:12] Trae Stephens: That's like the end of the day is that we've gone
[00:17:15] Trae Stephens: from building dozens of things to hundreds of things,
[00:17:17] Trae Stephens: two thousands of things,
[00:17:19] Trae Stephens: and now we need to make tens of thousands of things.
[00:17:22] Trae Stephens: And the only way that you can do that is by developing
[00:17:24] Trae Stephens: a muscle around manufacturing
[00:17:26] Trae Stephens: that most venture-back startups don't have.
[00:17:29] Trae Stephens: That's not how we think about building things.
[00:17:31] Trae Stephens: And so if you look at the way that like a contract
[00:17:33] Trae Stephens: manufacturer likes to like a flux tromics works,
[00:17:36] Trae Stephens: where, you know, a company comes to them
[00:17:38] Trae Stephens: and says we have a design,
[00:17:39] Trae Stephens: we have some sense of design for manufacturing,
[00:17:42] Trae Stephens: how this is going to be built,
[00:17:43] Trae Stephens: and then flux tromics figures out how to do that
[00:17:45] Trae Stephens: at massive scale, how to reduce cost.
[00:17:48] Trae Stephens: They work directly with the engineers
[00:17:49] Trae Stephens: at the company to design for manufacturing.
[00:17:52] Trae Stephens: That's kind of what we need to do at this point.
[00:17:53] Trae Stephens: We need to get to the point where we are building at scale,
[00:17:57] Trae Stephens: and that means that we're making design decisions
[00:17:59] Trae Stephens: when we build things that are enabling,
[00:18:02] Trae Stephens: scaling up to tens of thousands of units.
[00:18:05] Trae Stephens: So last year we announced that we're building out
[00:18:08] Trae Stephens: a facility in Ohio that we're calling Arsoma 1,
[00:18:11] Trae Stephens: which is a, over the next few years
[00:18:13] Trae Stephens: will be a five million square foot manufacturing campus.
[00:18:16] Trae Stephens: The first about 800,000 square feet will come on line
[00:18:20] Trae Stephens: in the first quarter of 2026.
[00:18:22] Trae Stephens: And, you know, we're building out that team
[00:18:24] Trae Stephens: and starting to kind of take very seriously the challenges
[00:18:29] Trae Stephens: that are going to be a big part of scaling
[00:18:31] Trae Stephens: from where we are now to that point.
[00:18:32] Trae Stephens: It seems like Tesla and SpaceX are like
[00:18:34] Jack Altman: couple of the only companies that have like
[00:18:36] Jack Altman: really done this at scale.
[00:18:37] Jack Altman: I mean, we talk about SpaceX a little bit
[00:18:39] Jack Altman: because I've seen us are close,
[00:18:40] Jack Altman: but can you like explain why it is so hard?
[00:18:43] Jack Altman: Like, what are the capabilities that are like
[00:18:47] Jack Altman: extremely hard to acquire to like produce cars at scale
[00:18:51] Jack Altman: or military equipment at scale, rockets at scale?
[00:18:54] Jack Altman: Like, can you like, you know, articulate why
[00:18:56] Jack Altman: it's so hard to do 20,000 instead of 200?
[00:19:00] Trae Stephens: There are people like to do it better than I can,
[00:19:02] Trae Stephens: but I'll do my best.
[00:19:03] Trae Stephens: I mean, the Tesla example is a good one.
[00:19:05] Trae Stephens: Like, the skill set that was required to build
[00:19:08] Trae Stephens: the first roadster, like how you can spend
[00:19:12] Trae Stephens: basically an infinite amount of money,
[00:19:14] Trae Stephens: you know, you can be highly exquisite
[00:19:15] Trae Stephens: in your approach to every problem
[00:19:17] Trae Stephens: that you're trying to solve.
[00:19:18] Trae Stephens: Very different than we're going to make a million cars.
[00:19:21] Trae Stephens: And like, if we're going to make a million cars,
[00:19:23] Trae Stephens: what is the most efficient way to weld door panels?
[00:19:26] Trae Stephens: What's the most efficient way to acquire the materials
[00:19:29] Trae Stephens: that we need to manufacture batteries?
[00:19:31] Trae Stephens: Yeah, actually, you know, it's like when you say
[00:19:32] Jack Altman: like a million cars, you're like, okay,
[00:19:34] Jack Altman: like how many has done a day?
[00:19:35] Jack Altman: Isn't it like, geez, it's crazy.
[00:19:37] Trae Stephens: The scale is just absolutely crazy.
[00:19:39] Trae Stephens: Yeah, it's just a different mentality
[00:19:42] Trae Stephens: that you need internally to do that.
[00:19:44] Trae Stephens: Space X is a little different
[00:19:45] Trae Stephens: because it's still highly exquisite airspace kind of stuff.
[00:19:49] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:19:50] Trae Stephens: But even in that case, you see that, you know,
[00:19:51] Trae Stephens: Elon and team has, they've verticalized the supply chain.
[00:19:55] Trae Stephens: Yeah, so they're like making things in house.
[00:19:57] Trae Stephens: There's still a lot of volume of really complicated stuff.
[00:19:59] Trae Stephens: Exactly.
[00:20:00] Trae Stephens: And so they figured out like,
[00:20:01] Trae Stephens: we can't actually go to suppliers for a lot of these parts
[00:20:04] Trae Stephens: because the cost of to the business,
[00:20:07] Trae Stephens: the risk to the business of that part failing
[00:20:10] Trae Stephens: is catastrophic.
[00:20:11] Trae Stephens: And so they end up having to verticalize a lot of this.
[00:20:14] Trae Stephens: In the end, okay, it's like, you know,
[00:20:16] Trae Stephens: if we're building missiles, like right now,
[00:20:18] Trae Stephens: like a Patriot missile is $2.25 million.
[00:20:20] Trae Stephens: And it's a lot of money for one missile.
[00:20:23] Trae Stephens: What if you were to build a Patriot equivalent
[00:20:26] Trae Stephens: or better missile for one-tenth of the cost?
[00:20:29] Trae Stephens: A lot of the changes that you would make
[00:20:30] Trae Stephens: are literally manufacturing decisions.
[00:20:33] Trae Stephens: It's like, how are you molding the exterior of it?
[00:20:36] Trae Stephens: How are you making solid rocket motors?
[00:20:38] Trae Stephens: What is the, like what materials are being used
[00:20:41] Trae Stephens: in the seekers?
[00:20:42] Trae Stephens: Do we have the ability to acquire enough
[00:20:44] Trae Stephens: of those materials that we can manufacture at scale
[00:20:47] Trae Stephens: at lower cost?
[00:20:49] Trae Stephens: And so there's obviously engineering design decisions,
[00:20:52] Trae Stephens: but a lot of that is also can you manufacture
[00:20:55] Trae Stephens: at a price that is attractive?
[00:20:57] Trae Stephens: It's interesting.
[00:20:58] Jack Altman: Like you see like a lot, you know, here you talk about it.
[00:20:59] Jack Altman: It's like you see a lot of, you know,
[00:21:01] Jack Altman: which is amazing new companies that are like working on
[00:21:03] Jack Altman: like a particular weapon or product or something
[00:21:06] Jack Altman: in like the defense space.
[00:21:07] Jack Altman: And then like I wonder like how much of the battle
[00:21:10] Jack Altman: is that versus government relationships, production,
[00:21:14] Jack Altman: capabilities, like capital access, like, you know,
[00:21:17] Jack Altman: relative to like in a software company
[00:21:18] Jack Altman: where like building a great software product is like,
[00:21:20] Jack Altman: let's say it's like 70% of the battle,
[00:21:22] Jack Altman: like I wonder what the equivalent is.
[00:21:24] Jack Altman: Yeah, I always tell defense tech companies
[00:21:25] Trae Stephens: that it's like, this is not the field of dreams.
[00:21:28] Trae Stephens: If you build it, they do not come.
[00:21:30] Trae Stephens: That's not how it works.
[00:21:31] Trae Stephens: Like if you build a perpetual motion machine
[00:21:33] Trae Stephens: and the point of the professional motion machine
[00:21:35] Trae Stephens: is like powering forward operating bases,
[00:21:38] Trae Stephens: you go to the Department of War and you say,
[00:21:40] Trae Stephens: I have built you a perpetual motion machine
[00:21:43] Trae Stephens: and I will sell it to you for a million dollars.
[00:21:46] Trae Stephens: They would, okay, we're gonna bid this out to market
[00:21:48] Trae Stephens: and we're gonna lock you Martin a $100 billion contract
[00:21:52] Trae Stephens: to rebuild from white paper
[00:21:54] Trae Stephens: your perpetual motion machine.
[00:21:55] Trae Stephens: That's how it works.
[00:21:56] Trae Stephens: The challenge is really do you understand well enough
[00:22:00] Trae Stephens: how the government works that you can navigate a strategy
[00:22:04] Trae Stephens: so that they're going to buy from a non-traditional player
[00:22:07] Trae Stephens: and that's like, you flip it.
[00:22:10] Trae Stephens: It's like not 70% product, it's like 30% product.
[00:22:13] Trae Stephens: The product matters.
[00:22:14] Trae Stephens: You have to build something that works
[00:22:15] Trae Stephens: and that serves the word fighters needs
[00:22:17] Trae Stephens: and is better than the alternative, all of that.
[00:22:19] Trae Stephens: You also have to know what you're doing
[00:22:21] Trae Stephens: on the business side of the equation.
[00:22:23] Trae Stephens: One last question because we were just talking about
[00:22:26] Jack Altman: there was space for us announced
[00:22:28] Jack Altman: and years ago people kind of made fun.
[00:22:30] Jack Altman: It seems to me like space warfare is actually
[00:22:33] Jack Altman: super important.
[00:22:34] Jack Altman: Is there like a sense that you have
[00:22:36] Jack Altman: that like as time goes on, more and more of the way war
[00:22:41] Jack Altman: is gonna happen between countries will happen
[00:22:42] Jack Altman: like maybe without people on land
[00:22:45] Jack Altman: will a lot of it be in space.
[00:22:46] Jack Altman: What's the future of like the way that like powers
[00:22:49] Jack Altman: are going to struggle?
[00:22:50] Trae Stephens: Yeah, I mean space is going to be really important
[00:22:52] Trae Stephens: without a doubt but all of it like every domain
[00:22:55] Trae Stephens: is going to have its own version of low cost autonomy.
[00:22:58] Trae Stephens: The era of putting 5,000 people on a $15 billion
[00:23:02] Trae Stephens: aircraft carrier and using that for force projection
[00:23:05] Trae Stephens: is over.
[00:23:06] Trae Stephens: You can fire a single digit millions,
[00:23:10] Trae Stephens: hypersonic carrier killer missile
[00:23:12] Trae Stephens: and take that asset out.
[00:23:14] Trae Stephens: It's like you really, that's not the way
[00:23:15] Trae Stephens: that you're gonna do that.
[00:23:17] Trae Stephens: Are you sure you're still important?
[00:23:18] Trae Stephens: I mean not in great power complex.
[00:23:20] Trae Stephens: Maybe they're important from like a logistics perspective
[00:23:23] Trae Stephens: but because of this like cost calculus,
[00:23:25] Trae Stephens: it's pretty because not that long ago
[00:23:26] Trae Stephens: they were like these just machines of dominance, right?
[00:23:29] Trae Stephens: Well, I think in the types of conflicts
[00:23:31] Trae Stephens: we were engaging in in the era of counter terrorism
[00:23:35] Trae Stephens: or something very different.
[00:23:36] Trae Stephens: Like the non-state actors terrorist organizations,
[00:23:40] Trae Stephens: they're not going to be taking out aircraft carriers
[00:23:42] Trae Stephens: by March.
[00:23:43] Trae Stephens: That is, it's just like a different kind of risk calculus.
[00:23:46] Jack Altman: So what will it be now?
[00:23:47] Jack Altman: Like will we have like a lot like human,
[00:23:50] Jack Altman: human human combat is gonna go down as soon.
[00:23:52] Trae Stephens: Well, human human combat has been going down for a while.
[00:23:54] Trae Stephens: I mean you look at the exception to that of course
[00:23:58] Trae Stephens: is like in a conflict like between Ukraine and Russia,
[00:24:00] Trae Stephens: you still have a lot of casualties.
[00:24:02] Trae Stephens: Like a lot of casualties.
[00:24:03] Trae Stephens: I don't think people,
[00:24:04] Trae Stephens: most people,
[00:24:05] Trae Stephens: people recognize just how many casualties
[00:24:07] Trae Stephens: there have been in that conflict.
[00:24:08] Trae Stephens: But the way that the United States Armed Forces
[00:24:10] Trae Stephens: has been engaging internationally
[00:24:12] Trae Stephens: is very heavily driven by special forces,
[00:24:14] Trae Stephens: which I think is going to be the case for a long time.
[00:24:16] Trae Stephens: If you're going to have highly trained,
[00:24:18] Trae Stephens: highly skilled operators that do super risky missions
[00:24:22] Trae Stephens: and things like that.
[00:24:23] Trae Stephens: But most of the other engagement
[00:24:24] Trae Stephens: is very likely going to be autonomy.
[00:24:27] Trae Stephens: It's like low cost undersea, low cost surface vessels,
[00:24:30] Trae Stephens: low cost ground vehicles, low cost aerial vehicles,
[00:24:34] Trae Stephens: and doing that in a way that takes the human
[00:24:36] Trae Stephens: out of the dullest, dirtiest, most dangerous jobs
[00:24:40] Trae Stephens: and empowers our ability to execute a strategy
[00:24:44] Trae Stephens: in a way that reduces potential for casualties
[00:24:46] Trae Stephens: in most of human life.
[00:24:47] Trae Stephens: So I just was thinking as we're talking,
[00:24:50] Jack Altman: I'm like, you know, talking to an Android founder,
[00:24:52] Jack Altman: but like we're also like we're here founders fund
[00:24:54] Jack Altman: like you're an investor too.
[00:24:55] Jack Altman: And so you really are doing both, you know,
[00:24:57] Jack Altman: both things at once,
[00:24:58] Jack Altman: but like really doing both things at once.
[00:25:00] Jack Altman: And you know, many people that founders fund
[00:25:02] Jack Altman: do it that way.
[00:25:03] Jack Altman: What's like the ethos for you,
[00:25:05] Jack Altman: maybe for a founder's founder,
[00:25:06] Jack Altman: but I guess just for you, like what is this sort of like
[00:25:10] Jack Altman: founder investor, like do you think about it?
[00:25:12] Jack Altman: Does it matter?
[00:25:12] Jack Altman: Are you just doing what feels, you know,
[00:25:14] Jack Altman: most important in any given time?
[00:25:15] Jack Altman: Like what's the, what are the mindset behind
[00:25:18] Jack Altman: the way that you work like this?
[00:25:20] Jack Altman: Yeah, it really is the latter.
[00:25:21] Trae Stephens: Just kind of doing whatever feels
[00:25:22] Trae Stephens: the most important at that moment.
[00:25:25] Trae Stephens: I didn't start Android because I was like,
[00:25:26] Trae Stephens: man, I really want to be a slashy, like an actor model
[00:25:30] Trae Stephens: from Zoolander.
[00:25:31] Trae Stephens: I really want to do investor operator.
[00:25:32] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:25:33] Trae Stephens: That was not my thought process.
[00:25:35] Trae Stephens: I didn't even think that was an option.
[00:25:37] Trae Stephens: I had been looking for, you know,
[00:25:40] Trae Stephens: what we did, we're larger investors
[00:25:41] Trae Stephens: and balance your antispas X.
[00:25:42] Trae Stephens: The question is, is there another one
[00:25:44] Trae Stephens: that we should be looking for?
[00:25:46] Trae Stephens: I have been kind of poking around,
[00:25:47] Trae Stephens: didn't find anything and went back to the team
[00:25:49] Trae Stephens: and I said, when I really think we need
[00:25:51] Trae Stephens: is a software defined, but how we're enabled defense prime
[00:25:55] Trae Stephens: rather than just like a software company,
[00:25:56] Trae Stephens: like Palantir.
[00:25:58] Trae Stephens: And I was like, oh, it's going to be really hard.
[00:25:59] Trae Stephens: SpaceX and Palantir are both founded by billionaires.
[00:26:02] Trae Stephens: I'm not really sure how this company is going to exist.
[00:26:04] Trae Stephens: But if it does exist, we will know about it
[00:26:06] Trae Stephens: because it's going to have to be pretty high profile.
[00:26:09] Trae Stephens: And to my surprise, the team was like,
[00:26:10] Trae Stephens: well, who better to do it?
[00:26:12] Trae Stephens: You should just go and build the team to do that.
[00:26:14] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:26:15] Trae Stephens: So it was kind of accidental.
[00:26:17] Trae Stephens: But then like from a day-to-day perspective,
[00:26:19] Trae Stephens: my chief of staff is awesome.
[00:26:20] Trae Stephens: She's been with me for the last two years here.
[00:26:23] Trae Stephens: We just kind of divide and conquer.
[00:26:24] Trae Stephens: And she sets the priorities for, you know,
[00:26:28] Trae Stephens: here are the androles things that really have to happen today.
[00:26:30] Trae Stephens: Here are the founders fun things that really
[00:26:31] Trae Stephens: have to happen today.
[00:26:33] Trae Stephens: And we context switch a lot.
[00:26:35] Trae Stephens: One of the things that I would find
[00:26:37] Jack Altman: probably interesting in your shoes is the relationships
[00:26:40] Jack Altman: with Palantir's SpaceX, you know, androle.
[00:26:43] Jack Altman: Like they're so deep that, you know, you're also like out,
[00:26:46] Jack Altman: you know, you might be meeting a seed or series A
[00:26:48] Jack Altman: or B company or whatever.
[00:26:49] Jack Altman: And you've also got these relationships
[00:26:51] Jack Altman: where you can and do just continue investing in these companies
[00:26:54] Jack Altman: that you are helping build.
[00:26:55] Jack Altman: You know very well, you have crazy close relationships.
[00:26:58] Jack Altman: So like how do you internally think about comparing
[00:27:01] Jack Altman: deploying more capital into these things
[00:27:03] Jack Altman: where you're spending tons of time,
[00:27:04] Jack Altman: you know everything versus like you meet a new company,
[00:27:06] Jack Altman: the regular VC way?
[00:27:07] Jack Altman: I still love the kind of curiosity
[00:27:10] Trae Stephens: that venture capital brings to the table.
[00:27:13] Trae Stephens: Like I love learning about new things.
[00:27:14] Trae Stephens: There's energy that I get from the VC side of things
[00:27:18] Trae Stephens: that is super fun.
[00:27:19] Trae Stephens: You know, one of the things that I noticed,
[00:27:21] Trae Stephens: I've been in venture now for just about 12 years.
[00:27:23] Trae Stephens: One of the first things I noticed when I joined Founders Fund
[00:27:25] Trae Stephens: is that BC's make for incredible dinner table conversations
[00:27:29] Trae Stephens: because we know like six inches of depth
[00:27:32] Trae Stephens: across the widest possible breadth of sectors.
[00:27:35] Trae Stephens: But I also found that to be like sort of boring over time.
[00:27:39] Trae Stephens: And Androle has been an amazing antidote to that.
[00:27:42] Trae Stephens: So it's like I can go mile deep and then I can come out
[00:27:45] Trae Stephens: and do the six inches of depth thing.
[00:27:48] Trae Stephens: There's actually a funny thing with these podcasts
[00:27:50] Jack Altman: where I will, you know, like a,
[00:27:52] Jack Altman: an accomplished CEO is just succeeded wildly.
[00:27:56] Jack Altman: That has a smaller Tam audience than a VC
[00:27:59] Jack Altman: who can just talk about a bunch of things,
[00:28:00] Jack Altman: which I sort of get like as a listener
[00:28:02] Jack Altman: or just as like a dinner guest.
[00:28:04] Jack Altman: I understand that, but I think the really interesting
[00:28:06] Jack Altman: meet usually is deep somewhere.
[00:28:08] Jack Altman: Totally, yeah.
[00:28:09] Trae Stephens: I mean, this is the most remarkable thing
[00:28:11] Trae Stephens: about a person like Elon is that he's deep in so many people.
[00:28:14] Trae Stephens: He's deep in so many places.
[00:28:16] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:28:17] Trae Stephens: And the closer that I'm not Elon
[00:28:20] Trae Stephens: and I'll never be Elon.
[00:28:21] Trae Stephens: But the closer I've gotten to that is I've gotten deep
[00:28:23] Trae Stephens: in like multiple things.
[00:28:24] Trae Stephens: I've really respected and appreciated
[00:28:28] Trae Stephens: even more how insanely hard this is.
[00:28:30] Trae Stephens: Like I was, I was with him a few months back
[00:28:33] Trae Stephens: as we were transitioning between two meetings
[00:28:35] Trae Stephens: that we were trying to, he was like on a conference call
[00:28:38] Trae Stephens: with SpaceX talking about like the literal
[00:28:41] Trae Stephens: metal liturgical materials that were going to be used
[00:28:44] Trae Stephens: for this specific part of the rock industry.
[00:28:46] Trae Stephens: And I was like, I was a possible that you're that involved
[00:28:49] Trae Stephens: at that level.
[00:28:50] Trae Stephens: And it's not like the learnings port from like it's not
[00:28:52] Jack Altman: like Tesla needs those materials.
[00:28:54] Jack Altman: So it's like you learned it for one purpose.
[00:28:55] Jack Altman: For one purpose.
[00:28:56] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:28:57] Trae Stephens: I don't feel like I'm even remotely close to that.
[00:28:59] Trae Stephens: But there is, there's something intellectually much more
[00:29:03] Trae Stephens: meaty for me on the operation side for sure.
[00:29:06] Trae Stephens: Is that something that is like cultural to founders
[00:29:09] Jack Altman: since I've said like, you know, there's a lot of other
[00:29:11] Jack Altman: companies that get like built by partners here?
[00:29:14] Jack Altman: Is there something about the attraction to people
[00:29:17] Jack Altman: that have depth in them that like,
[00:29:19] Jack Altman: is that necessary?
[00:29:20] Jack Altman: The founders fund?
[00:29:21] Jack Altman: Well, you know, I think that the name of the fund
[00:29:24] Trae Stephens: can be interpreted in two ways.
[00:29:26] Trae Stephens: You know, why are we called founders fund?
[00:29:28] Trae Stephens: The most straightforward way that most people think
[00:29:31] Trae Stephens: is what you just said, which is that we were like founders.
[00:29:35] Trae Stephens: Like most of us, or at least many of us have started
[00:29:37] Trae Stephens: companies before we kind of have an operational engagement
[00:29:40] Trae Stephens: with the world that a lot of other more finance
[00:29:42] Trae Stephens: oriented bcs don't have.
[00:29:44] Trae Stephens: The real answer to the question is that we're a fund
[00:29:46] Trae Stephens: for founders, which means that if we believe
[00:29:48] Trae Stephens: that we could run a company better than a founder,
[00:29:50] Trae Stephens: like we want a board C, we want to help you,
[00:29:52] Trae Stephens: we want to give all the strategic guidance.
[00:29:54] Trae Stephens: Like we would probably just start the companies ourselves,
[00:29:56] Trae Stephens: but we're investing in these companies
[00:29:58] Trae Stephens: because we believe that the founder is the right person
[00:30:01] Trae Stephens: to run that specific business.
[00:30:03] Trae Stephens: And so it kind of works in both ways.
[00:30:06] Trae Stephens: But I do think because of that second piece,
[00:30:08] Trae Stephens: because we are not trying to get super operationally hands
[00:30:11] Trae Stephens: on with our portfolio, it means that we have time and space
[00:30:16] Trae Stephens: and the permission from the fund to go and explore the things
[00:30:21] Trae Stephens: that we think are most interesting.
[00:30:22] Trae Stephens: So you end up with Scott Nolan starting a nuclear fuels
[00:30:25] Trae Stephens: company, General Matt or Delana Esperot,
[00:30:27] Trae Stephens: Hofstranding, Varda, hypersonics,
[00:30:29] Trae Stephens: and in space manufacturing company,
[00:30:32] Trae Stephens: Peter started Palantir, I started Androle.
[00:30:35] Trae Stephens: There's no intentional incubation strategy.
[00:30:37] Trae Stephens: It's literally just the output, the exhaust of a system
[00:30:42] Trae Stephens: that rewards and incentivizes people on going deep.
[00:30:45] Trae Stephens: You must have companies that are asking for things
[00:30:48] Jack Altman: though from the team, of course,
[00:30:49] Jack Altman: like even without board seats, I'm sure people are still
[00:30:51] Jack Altman: at the time.
[00:30:52] Jack Altman: Oh yeah, we are very good at being reactively supportive.
[00:30:55] Trae Stephens: Right.
[00:30:56] Trae Stephens: So we're close to pick up right away, I'm sure.
[00:30:57] Jack Altman: Totally.
[00:30:58] Jack Altman: Totally.
[00:30:59] Trae Stephens: We're the first people to go out, make introductions,
[00:31:01] Trae Stephens: help with business strategy, help with pricing,
[00:31:03] Trae Stephens: whatever it is, we're very engaged at that level,
[00:31:06] Trae Stephens: but we don't want board seats.
[00:31:09] Trae Stephens: Like we don't have 20 board seats, like a lot of VCs.
[00:31:12] Trae Stephens: I think I have like four board seats right now,
[00:31:14] Trae Stephens: which is so different.
[00:31:15] Jack Altman: Yeah.
[00:31:15] Jack Altman: Taking aside the incubations,
[00:31:18] Jack Altman: although that's obviously part of it
[00:31:19] Jack Altman: or there's building companies being a founder,
[00:31:21] Jack Altman: the investing itself has just been like extremely good.
[00:31:23] Jack Altman: And I'd be curious if you could try to pick a part
[00:31:27] Jack Altman: or point to some of the things that have mattered for that.
[00:31:30] Jack Altman: Maybe I'll start by prompting like what I have sort of
[00:31:33] Jack Altman: observed that seems particularly good.
[00:31:35] Jack Altman: One is like the ability to concentrate over and over again
[00:31:39] Jack Altman: in aggressive ways within a fund, across a fund.
[00:31:43] Jack Altman: That seems very important.
[00:31:44] Jack Altman: There's obviously calling trends early
[00:31:48] Jack Altman: and like not hopping into things that are already hot,
[00:31:50] Jack Altman: but like doing things before they're hot,
[00:31:52] Jack Altman: there seems to be something about like the way
[00:31:54] Jack Altman: the partnership operates and like the type of dynamics
[00:31:57] Jack Altman: that you have with one another
[00:31:58] Jack Altman: and how ideas get debated.
[00:32:00] Jack Altman: But I'm curious like you're obviously living it.
[00:32:02] Jack Altman: Like what would you point to as the things
[00:32:03] Jack Altman: that I mean founders fund as high performances as a husband?
[00:32:06] Jack Altman: If you divided this into access evaluation of companies
[00:32:12] Trae Stephens: and like follow on, there's probably an answer
[00:32:16] Trae Stephens: in each of those categories.
[00:32:17] Trae Stephens: On the access front, it's like I've been here 12 years,
[00:32:20] Trae Stephens: the fund has been around for 20 years.
[00:32:22] Trae Stephens: Most of the access edge that we have happened before my time.
[00:32:25] Trae Stephens: You know, it's like the PayPal Mafia coming together,
[00:32:27] Trae Stephens: Peter's brand, there's like a long history
[00:32:30] Trae Stephens: of people leaving storied VC funds to start their own firms
[00:32:33] Trae Stephens: and stuff like that.
[00:32:34] Trae Stephens: I am literally zero interested in doing that.
[00:32:37] Trae Stephens: I am just writing the way of Peter Teal's genius.
[00:32:41] Trae Stephens: That's awesome.
[00:32:42] Trae Stephens: That's awesome.
[00:32:43] Trae Stephens: It's like it's a great strategy.
[00:32:45] Trae Stephens: So that's like that edge.
[00:32:47] Trae Stephens: The middle one on evaluation, I think that like, you know,
[00:32:50] this is also sort of a Peter culture thing,
[00:32:54] Trae Stephens: which is open debate.
[00:32:55] Trae Stephens: There are no sacred cows.
[00:32:57] Trae Stephens: Hierarchy doesn't exist.
[00:32:58] Trae Stephens: It's like, you know, whether it's me, Peter and Napoleon
[00:33:02] Trae Stephens: which are like the GP or the newest person into the fund.
[00:33:05] Trae Stephens: We want everyone to be fighting and advocating
[00:33:08] Trae Stephens: for what they believe we should be investing in.
[00:33:11] Trae Stephens: And because of that, you get this really vibrant culture
[00:33:13] Trae Stephens: of debate.
[00:33:14] Trae Stephens: It's not like a single hegemonic figure coming in
[00:33:17] Trae Stephens: and beating down the junior people
[00:33:19] Trae Stephens: and telling them how to do.
[00:33:20] Trae Stephens: The firm I'm used to work here was saying that like,
[00:33:22] Jack Altman: somebody asked him if like the fact that people like debate
[00:33:25] Jack Altman: hard was like one of the tough things and part of me,
[00:33:27] Jack Altman: and he's like, no, that was like amazing.
[00:33:29] Jack Altman: It was like, there was enough trust and respect
[00:33:30] Jack Altman: between people to like fight it out for real.
[00:33:32] Jack Altman: Totally.
[00:33:33] Jack Altman: Which doesn't exist in like a lot of places.
[00:33:35] Trae Stephens: One of the most shocking things to me,
[00:33:37] Trae Stephens: when I first joined, I had worked with Peter for a while
[00:33:41] Trae Stephens: when I was a palenter.
[00:33:42] Trae Stephens: I was a palenter for six years before I came here.
[00:33:44] Trae Stephens: But I kind of had this expectation that Peter
[00:33:45] Trae Stephens: would be this sort of immovable intellectual force.
[00:33:48] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:33:49] Trae Stephens: And actually, that's the convincements.
[00:33:50] Trae Stephens: You can convince them all the time.
[00:33:53] Trae Stephens: You have to construct a good argument.
[00:33:54] Trae Stephens: And that's how you're going to gain respect with them
[00:33:57] Trae Stephens: is by winning an argument.
[00:33:58] Trae Stephens: But I was shocked at how he would take a position.
[00:34:01] Trae Stephens: We would litigate the position.
[00:34:04] Trae Stephens: And if he felt like there was a better argument being made,
[00:34:07] Trae Stephens: he would say, yeah, I think I agree with an ex-wisey person
[00:34:10] Trae Stephens: that made that argument instead.
[00:34:12] Trae Stephens: And so that is very core to who we are as a fund.
[00:34:14] Trae Stephens: And I think that served as well.
[00:34:15] Trae Stephens: And so that's unpicking.
[00:34:16] Trae Stephens: That's unpicking the evaluation.
[00:34:18] Trae Stephens: Is there anything else besides just like,
[00:34:21] Jack Altman: so there's the debating.
[00:34:22] Jack Altman: But then there's the contents of what's being debated.
[00:34:24] Jack Altman: Like, are there any ways of thinking or mindsets
[00:34:27] Jack Altman: that are in there?
[00:34:30] Jack Altman: Because it's like you want to, you want good ideas
[00:34:32] Jack Altman: or winning obviously.
[00:34:33] Jack Altman: It's like, what's in that?
[00:34:34] Trae Stephens: Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of different ideological
[00:34:36] Trae Stephens: pieces to this.
[00:34:37] Trae Stephens: Many of them are described in Peter's book, Zero to One.
[00:34:41] Trae Stephens: We really don't like consensus categories.
[00:34:43] Trae Stephens: Anywhere where you find a bunch of competition,
[00:34:45] Trae Stephens: we try to stay away from.
[00:34:46] Trae Stephens: I think chapter six of Peter's book
[00:34:49] Trae Stephens: is literally titled Competition As For Losers.
[00:34:52] Trae Stephens: We don't love competitive market spaces.
[00:34:54] Trae Stephens: Just to click on that.
[00:34:55] Trae Stephens: If there's a space, let's say there's like AI customer support.
[00:34:59] Jack Altman: There's something where like,
[00:35:00] Jack Altman: as is both good and competitive.
[00:35:03] Jack Altman: Like, you're not going to not invest just
[00:35:04] Jack Altman: because there's competition.
[00:35:06] Jack Altman: So how, like, what would the conversation be like
[00:35:08] Jack Altman: if you're looking at something in code or support
[00:35:11] Jack Altman: or one of these places that are both competitive
[00:35:13] Jack Altman: but obviously valuable?
[00:35:14] Jack Altman: Yeah, I mean, we're huge investors in cognition.
[00:35:16] Jack Altman: Yeah, for example.
[00:35:17] Trae Stephens: This was literally the tenor of the debate internally
[00:35:20] Trae Stephens: when we looked at writing that first check in the cognition.
[00:35:22] Trae Stephens: It's like, do we believe that the founder
[00:35:25] Trae Stephens: that like, atomic element of the company
[00:35:27] Trae Stephens: is so good that we have to get over
[00:35:30] Trae Stephens: our philosophical, nearly dogmatic hesitance
[00:35:34] Trae Stephens: to go into these competitive consensus markets.
[00:35:37] Trae Stephens: And in that case, the answer was yes.
[00:35:38] Trae Stephens: But in many cases, the answer is no.
[00:35:41] Trae Stephens: Like, you have to have an absolute killer
[00:35:43] Trae Stephens: to feel really good about making that bet.
[00:35:46] Trae Stephens: But then it's really not a company bet.
[00:35:47] Trae Stephens: It's a founder bet.
[00:35:48] Trae Stephens: And so you're not betting in the category.
[00:35:50] Trae Stephens: You're investing in the person at that stage.
[00:35:52] Trae Stephens: You know, we also only invest in founder CEOs.
[00:35:55] Trae Stephens: So like, once a company has a professional CEO
[00:35:58] Trae Stephens: we're out, we're just not going to do it.
[00:35:59] Trae Stephens: We also are much more willing to take tech risk
[00:36:02] Trae Stephens: than a lot of other funds.
[00:36:03] Trae Stephens: We're happy to write sizable checks
[00:36:05] Trae Stephens: in the companies that are a ways out
[00:36:07] Trae Stephens: from having a product in market.
[00:36:09] Trae Stephens: And you know, there's kind of the famous moniker
[00:36:12] Trae Stephens: of founders from over a decade ago
[00:36:14] Trae Stephens: is we want to fly in cars.
[00:36:16] Trae Stephens: And instead we got 140 characters.
[00:36:17] Trae Stephens: And so we're very...
[00:36:19] Trae Stephens: And that's just a cheer of founder bet too.
[00:36:21] Jack Altman: Yeah, you're just, you're trying to figure out
[00:36:23] Trae Stephens: is this the type of person that's going to be able
[00:36:25] Trae Stephens: to manifest this reality?
[00:36:27] Trae Stephens: How much do you talk about like markets
[00:36:30] Jack Altman: in these early stage investments?
[00:36:32] Jack Altman: Or is it always about the founder?
[00:36:33] Jack Altman: Early stage, it's about the founder.
[00:36:35] Trae Stephens: Obviously later stage, you have a lot more data.
[00:36:37] Trae Stephens: And that stuff comes in.
[00:36:39] Trae Stephens: But early stage, like something is probably binary.
[00:36:42] Trae Stephens: It's like, it's either going to work
[00:36:43] Trae Stephens: because the founder wills it into existence or it's not.
[00:36:46] Trae Stephens: And it's probably going to be because the team
[00:36:50] Trae Stephens: wasn't able to pull it off.
[00:36:51] Trae Stephens: Not because there's a fundamental Tam constraint
[00:36:53] Trae Stephens: or anything like that.
[00:36:54] Trae Stephens: What are the other like big tenants or principles
[00:36:56] Jack Altman: that like often are getting, you know,
[00:36:59] Jack Altman: harken back to in these debates?
[00:37:00] Jack Altman: I mean, a lot of it is sort of philosophical
[00:37:03] Trae Stephens: about like, do we believe that this needs to exist
[00:37:05] Trae Stephens: in the world?
[00:37:06] Trae Stephens: And do we believe that us coming in with capital
[00:37:09] Trae Stephens: is going to help the founder bring this thing
[00:37:12] Trae Stephens: into existence?
[00:37:14] Trae Stephens: And you know, some of our best bets have been predicated
[00:37:16] Trae Stephens: on exactly that, whether that's SpaceX
[00:37:19] Trae Stephens: or Android, like these are really complicated companies
[00:37:23] Trae Stephens: to pull off.
[00:37:25] Trae Stephens: And it takes kind of that like hope
[00:37:26] Trae Stephens: and vision type of investment
[00:37:28] Trae Stephens: how to be early stages.
[00:37:29] Trae Stephens: Do you buy in at all on like, high brand VC
[00:37:33] Jack Altman: kingmaking as a thing?
[00:37:34] Jack Altman: And I'm sort of asking this from the perspective of,
[00:37:36] Jack Altman: I think a lot of other brands that are sort of in your same
[00:37:40] Jack Altman: echelon smartly sometimes use like what I would see
[00:37:43] Jack Altman: is kind of like, not, I don't want to say,
[00:37:46] Jack Altman: this sounds negative.
[00:37:47] Jack Altman: I was going to say kingmaking tactics,
[00:37:49] Jack Altman: which sounds negative.
[00:37:50] Jack Altman: I don't mean it that way.
[00:37:51] Jack Altman: But like where I see a decision where I'm like,
[00:37:53] Jack Altman: I think what they're doing is calculating
[00:37:55] Jack Altman: that if by doing this round, this company's going to do well.
[00:37:58] Jack Altman: And unlike I'm guessing that was the conversation that's
[00:38:00] Jack Altman: happening and I think it's sometimes true.
[00:38:02] Jack Altman: But I'm curious if that's ever how you think about it
[00:38:04] Jack Altman: or you just like, we don't buy into that.
[00:38:05] Jack Altman: Because like, I don't see founders fund flexing its brand
[00:38:09] Jack Altman: and stature in these sort of dynamics
[00:38:11] Jack Altman: the way that I think you could.
[00:38:13] Jack Altman: And I wonder if that's because there's like a dis-taste for it
[00:38:15] Jack Altman: or if it's because you think it doesn't work.
[00:38:17] Trae Stephens: Going back to the point I'll about consensus
[00:38:19] Trae Stephens: competitive businesses that because we don't do a whole lot
[00:38:21] Trae Stephens: of those were in less of a position to do the kingmaking
[00:38:24] Trae Stephens: and then a firm would be that it's going directly
[00:38:27] Trae Stephens: at like crowded enterprise SaaS categories or something.
[00:38:31] Trae Stephens: So that's kind of half the answer to the question.
[00:38:33] Trae Stephens: The other half of the answer is,
[00:38:34] Trae Stephens: we have debates about this all the time internally.
[00:38:37] Trae Stephens: You know, I published a blog post a couple of months ago
[00:38:40] Trae Stephens: about Kamikaze rounds, which is basically
[00:38:42] Trae Stephens: what I would call like kingmaking
[00:38:44] Trae Stephens: where like adventure fund comes in and they're like,
[00:38:47] Trae Stephens: you know, I want to invest this huge check,
[00:38:49] Trae Stephens: 100, 200, 500 million dollars into the company.
[00:38:52] Trae Stephens: And obviously in order for that to be like minimally delutive,
[00:38:55] Trae Stephens: that means that you're going to have to accept evaluation
[00:38:58] Trae Stephens: as way higher than the current status for the business.
[00:39:01] Trae Stephens: And founders can very easily be convinced
[00:39:03] Trae Stephens: to take huge checks at high valuations.
[00:39:06] Trae Stephens: But that's like, you know, an anchor around your neck
[00:39:09] Trae Stephens: that oftentimes destroys companies.
[00:39:12] Trae Stephens: And there's countless examples of these.
[00:39:14] Trae Stephens: And it's always funny like publicly talking about
[00:39:16] Trae Stephens: Kamikaze rounds, people will ask for names
[00:39:18] Trae Stephens: and it's like the community is so small.
[00:39:20] Trae Stephens: It's like, do I really want to burn relationships
[00:39:22] Trae Stephens: by naming names?
[00:39:23] Trae Stephens: But everyone knows who I'm talking about
[00:39:25] Trae Stephens: and I say that this happens.
[00:39:26] Trae Stephens: There's this sort of view that it's the VC's fault
[00:39:30] Trae Stephens: that like the VC is mistracing
[00:39:32] Trae Stephens: and the company has no responsibility.
[00:39:34] Trae Stephens: But like as a founder, you're accountable
[00:39:36] Trae Stephens: for ensuring the long-term viability of your business.
[00:39:39] Trae Stephens: And capital raising is part of that strategy
[00:39:43] Trae Stephens: that you have to roll out.
[00:39:44] Trae Stephens: And so, you know, there's kind of a conversation
[00:39:49] Trae Stephens: that you have to have with companies
[00:39:50] Trae Stephens: as they're going through this process.
[00:39:52] Trae Stephens: It's like, yes, you could take more money at a higher price.
[00:39:54] Trae Stephens: You could also take less money at a lower price.
[00:39:57] Trae Stephens: And that might actually be the better decision
[00:39:59] Trae Stephens: for you as a company.
[00:40:00] Trae Stephens: You know, this is famously trolled
[00:40:02] Trae Stephens: in the HBO show Silicon Valley
[00:40:04] Trae Stephens: where this guy's company failed
[00:40:05] Trae Stephens: and the protagonist was talking to him
[00:40:08] Trae Stephens: over drinks at a bar and he was like,
[00:40:09] Trae Stephens: you know, you could have raised less.
[00:40:11] Trae Stephens: And he was like, no one told me I could have let you know.
[00:40:14] Trae Stephens: Why is this?
[00:40:15] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:40:16] Trae Stephens: So I think Kingmaking in some cases,
[00:40:18] Trae Stephens: especially in highly competitive markets,
[00:40:21] Trae Stephens: might actually work.
[00:40:22] Trae Stephens: But there's tremendous downside risk as well.
[00:40:25] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:40:26] Trae Stephens: And what about on the concentrating part?
[00:40:27] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:40:28] Trae Stephens: So that's like the third category.
[00:40:29] Trae Stephens: So like first category is access, second category is,
[00:40:33] Trae Stephens: you know, analysis evaluation.
[00:40:35] Trae Stephens: And then that third category is the follow on.
[00:40:37] Trae Stephens: One quick question there.
[00:40:38] Jack Altman: Out of all of your dollars,
[00:40:39] Jack Altman: how many like roughly speaking,
[00:40:41] Jack Altman: what percentage are an initiation check
[00:40:43] Jack Altman: versus like a fault?
[00:40:43] Jack Altman: Like out of $100 that go out of the door.
[00:40:46] Jack Altman: Like how important is this third bucket?
[00:40:48] Jack Altman: Well, we have a venture fund and a growth fund,
[00:40:50] Trae Stephens: which is going to be wildly different.
[00:40:51] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:40:52] Trae Stephens: So like the growth fund is writing massive checks right up front.
[00:40:54] Trae Stephens: And the venture fund, ideally the top,
[00:40:57] Trae Stephens: call it five or six companies in each vintage and each venture fund,
[00:41:02] Trae Stephens: should represent like middle size, double digit, millions of,
[00:41:05] Trae Stephens: or percentages, rather of the fund.
[00:41:07] Trae Stephens: So like I want like 40, 40, 40, 50% of the fund,
[00:41:11] Trae Stephens: if we can,
[00:41:12] Trae Stephens: concentrate it into our top positions.
[00:41:14] Trae Stephens: So that bucket's huge.
[00:41:15] Trae Stephens: It's like as important as the first bucket.
[00:41:17] Trae Stephens: Totally.
[00:41:18] Jack Altman: Yeah.
[00:41:19] Jack Altman: Okay.
[00:41:20] Trae Stephens: So how do you do that?
[00:41:21] Trae Stephens: So that's the version of this.
[00:41:22] Trae Stephens: And there's the non-proactive version.
[00:41:23] Trae Stephens: The product of version of it is,
[00:41:25] you have to constantly be asking yourself,
[00:41:28] what are the best companies we've invested in so far
[00:41:30] Trae Stephens: in this venture fund?
[00:41:31] Trae Stephens: And can we get out in front of another round,
[00:41:34] Trae Stephens: giving them more capital,
[00:41:35] Trae Stephens: figuring out some way to intentionally create concentration?
[00:41:39] Trae Stephens: That's like half of it.
[00:41:40] Trae Stephens: The other half of it is not concentrating.
[00:41:43] Trae Stephens: And that's just like,
[00:41:44] Trae Stephens: don't do a bunch of stupid single digit million dollar deals.
[00:41:47] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:41:48] Trae Stephens: You're seeing in the first place,
[00:41:49] Trae Stephens: all the ones of them.
[00:41:50] Trae Stephens: Both.
[00:41:51] Trae Stephens: If you have a billion dollar venture fund,
[00:41:52] Trae Stephens: like Foundersign,
[00:41:53] Trae Stephens: we've pretty consistently raised billion dollar venture funds.
[00:41:57] Trae Stephens: And you spend 10, 15, 20% of the fund,
[00:42:02] Trae Stephens: writing seed checks,
[00:42:03] Trae Stephens: even a really well performing seed fund
[00:42:06] Trae Stephens: of a hundred million dollar size,
[00:42:08] Trae Stephens: like maybe you return your fund one X,
[00:42:10] Trae Stephens: but like,
[00:42:11] Trae Stephens: it's not really going to move the needle.
[00:42:12] Trae Stephens: You need to write larger checks.
[00:42:14] Trae Stephens: That's kind of like the lesson.
[00:42:15] Trae Stephens: We really don't want to be writing a bunch of 100K,
[00:42:17] Trae Stephens: 250K checks,
[00:42:18] Trae Stephens: especially because we now have a signaling anchor
[00:42:21] Trae Stephens: around those companies that they're going to come back
[00:42:23] Trae Stephens: and they're going to really need us to participate
[00:42:25] Trae Stephens: in order to raise their Series A.
[00:42:27] Trae Stephens: But in addition to that,
[00:42:28] Trae Stephens: if we go out and we write five, 10 million dollar checks
[00:42:31] Trae Stephens: into Series A companies,
[00:42:32] Trae Stephens: like we should be doing at that first bet,
[00:42:36] Trae Stephens: when they come back
[00:42:36] Trae Stephens: and they're kind of mediocre performance,
[00:42:40] Trae Stephens: maybe some other VC came in with a really high price.
[00:42:44] Trae Stephens: Are you coming in and doing an auto-pro-rata?
[00:42:46] Trae Stephens: I think that's sort of the bias for the industry
[00:42:48] Trae Stephens: as like we should just do our parrata.
[00:42:50] Trae Stephens: If somebody else marks up the company,
[00:42:51] Trae Stephens: but there's this weird reverse correlation
[00:42:54] Trae Stephens: between companies that need your signaling
[00:42:57] Jack Altman: and companies that ask you to not invest your parrata.
[00:43:00] Trae Stephens: It's like if a company asks you to not invest parrata,
[00:43:03] Trae Stephens: you should be fighting for parrata.
[00:43:05] Trae Stephens: But if a company comes to you and says,
[00:43:06] Trae Stephens: I really need your...
[00:43:07] Trae Stephens: That's a good founder tip for people
[00:43:08] Jack Altman: who want to get parrata.
[00:43:09] Jack Altman: Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:10] Trae Stephens: Exactly.
[00:43:11] Trae Stephens: And so I think part of the concentration thing is like,
[00:43:14] Trae Stephens: I just don't want to play those games.
[00:43:16] Trae Stephens: If it's not at the next investment opportunity,
[00:43:19] Trae Stephens: if it's not a deal that we would have done
[00:43:22] Trae Stephens: ex the initial investment, like we would have passed,
[00:43:25] Trae Stephens: well then you should pass,
[00:43:26] Trae Stephens: or you should minimize the check size to the company.
[00:43:30] Trae Stephens: So there's a bit of a trade off there.
[00:43:32] Trae Stephens: I mean, part of it also, I think the whole thing
[00:43:35] Jack Altman: relies on having companies that can be concentrated in two.
[00:43:39] Jack Altman: Yes.
[00:43:40] Jack Altman: And like there's good software companies
[00:43:41] Jack Altman: that are never gonna need $5 billion of capital
[00:43:43] Jack Altman: and are never gonna be worth $200 billion.
[00:43:46] Jack Altman: And so some of this...
[00:43:46] Jack Altman: And then it is the case,
[00:43:47] Jack Altman: it means you need to write as large of a check as you can.
[00:43:50] Up from.
[00:43:51] Jack Altman: As early as you can.
[00:43:52] Jack Altman: Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:53] Jack Altman: Because you're like, I'm never gonna buy ownership,
[00:43:54] Jack Altman: but totally.
[00:43:55] Jack Altman: As you look around now, like late 2025,
[00:43:58] Jack Altman: and you like see what's happening in the landscape around,
[00:44:01] Jack Altman: and you've got like a lot of firms getting really, really big,
[00:44:04] Jack Altman: you know, a lot of these things that we're talking about
[00:44:06] Jack Altman: are things, you know, you've been saying for a lot of years,
[00:44:07] Jack Altman: but now there's a lot of firms that I think are sort of
[00:44:10] Jack Altman: starting to sort of,
[00:44:11] Jack Altman: magnetically, you know, thinking similar ways, et cetera.
[00:44:14] Jack Altman: But, you know, you've got a lot of interesting stuff going on,
[00:44:16] Jack Altman: like, hard tech is working really well with a lot of your companies,
[00:44:19] Jack Altman: obviously not probably speaking,
[00:44:20] Jack Altman: but there's enough of that.
[00:44:21] Jack Altman: There's a lot of really good AI stuff.
[00:44:23] Jack Altman: And so when you kind of like, smush it all together,
[00:44:26] Jack Altman: I'm just kind of curious like where you think
[00:44:28] Jack Altman: there's like alpha in venture right now.
[00:44:30] Jack Altman: I think venture is just really hard.
[00:44:33] Trae Stephens: The founders on strategy has been stay true to our,
[00:44:36] Trae Stephens: you know, our strategy.
[00:44:38] Trae Stephens: And if that means we go slow and we deploy less quickly
[00:44:42] Trae Stephens: than everyone else in the space, fine.
[00:44:45] Trae Stephens: Yeah. Like I'm not going to stress about that.
[00:44:47] Trae Stephens: There are going to be good deals in every vintage.
[00:44:50] Trae Stephens: Like, you know, even through the dot com crash,
[00:44:52] Trae Stephens: it's like, if you were a Google investor,
[00:44:54] Trae Stephens: you're fine.
[00:44:55] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:44:56] Trae Stephens: And the 0809 or session,
[00:44:57] Trae Stephens: if you were a Facebook investor, you're fine.
[00:44:59] Trae Stephens: Like there's always going to be at a micro level good deals.
[00:45:02] Trae Stephens: Just have to make sure you're in those deals
[00:45:04] Trae Stephens: and not get overly exuberant about chasing hype.
[00:45:08] Trae Stephens: And given the long term strategy of founders fund,
[00:45:11] Trae Stephens: we're kind of immunized against type chasing.
[00:45:14] Trae Stephens: From the outside, I imagine founders fund
[00:45:17] Jack Altman: is like no funnel place.
[00:45:19] Jack Altman: Whereas like, I think most venture firms are like
[00:45:21] Jack Altman: famoscentral.
[00:45:22] Jack Altman: Yeah, we just, we don't do the momentum hype chasing.
[00:45:25] Trae Stephens: Like are you guys never like, we passed on that round
[00:45:27] Jack Altman: and now Sequoia is doing, like,
[00:45:29] Jack Altman: does that conversation just never happen here?
[00:45:30] Jack Altman: Basically never.
[00:45:31] Jack Altman: If someone that you're pissed at, I mean, there have been cases
[00:45:33] Jack Altman: where it's like your anti portfolio or whatever,
[00:45:35] Trae Stephens: like I'm out with this company and I wish I had invested,
[00:45:37] Trae Stephens: but like, that actually happens very rarely.
[00:45:39] Trae Stephens: There's not a whole lot of cases where we feel
[00:45:42] Jack Altman: a lot of regret about it.
[00:45:43] Jack Altman: Yeah, I mean, I think it like requires
[00:45:44] Jack Altman: a whole lot of like different mindsets than in general.
[00:45:47] Jack Altman: Like I feel like, you know, just from talking to you,
[00:45:48] Jack Altman: I can tell you also are not thinking in categories
[00:45:50] Jack Altman: whereas like most people are like,
[00:45:51] Jack Altman: oh, that's a great category.
[00:45:52] Jack Altman: Seems like you don't think that way at all.
[00:45:53] Jack Altman: No, I don't think categories should exist.
[00:45:55] Trae Stephens: It's like once a category exists, it's too late.
[00:45:57] Trae Stephens: If you're a social media investor and you didn't invest
[00:45:59] Trae Stephens: in Facebook, probably last money.
[00:46:01] Trae Stephens: If you're a space investor and you didn't invest
[00:46:02] Trae Stephens: in SpaceX, probably the last money.
[00:46:04] Trae Stephens: You know, you want to be in the first deal,
[00:46:06] Trae Stephens: not in the second, third, fourth one.
[00:46:07] Trae Stephens: Can you build contrarianism or is all you can do
[00:46:10] Jack Altman: shut off the Mimesis?
[00:46:12] Trae Stephens: It's not even necessarily shutting off the Mimesis.
[00:46:14] Trae Stephens: It's more like being aware of Mimesis is the important thing.
[00:46:18] Trae Stephens: We always ask founders what the origin story
[00:46:21] Trae Stephens: for the businesses.
[00:46:22] Trae Stephens: That's like a really important indicator
[00:46:24] Trae Stephens: of memetic kind of rivalry.
[00:46:26] Trae Stephens: It's like someone, they should have a reason
[00:46:28] Trae Stephens: for why they started the business.
[00:46:30] Trae Stephens: What does that story look like when it's good?
[00:46:32] Trae Stephens: Well, at a minimum, it's a story.
[00:46:34] Trae Stephens: You'd be surprised.
[00:46:35] Trae Stephens: Maybe you've done this as well.
[00:46:37] Trae Stephens: Usually there's not even a story.
[00:46:38] Trae Stephens: If you were like, well, my business school class may not,
[00:46:41] Trae Stephens: we really wanted to found a company
[00:46:43] Trae Stephens: and we did 100 interviews.
[00:46:45] Trae Stephens: And this is the thing that we thought would be the fastest
[00:46:48] Trae Stephens: to be able to.
[00:46:49] Trae Stephens: I mean, there's probably some examples
[00:46:50] Trae Stephens: in the course of history.
[00:46:52] Trae Stephens: I heard that Travis did whiteboard his way to Uber.
[00:46:55] Jack Altman: I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:46:56] Jack Altman: I think I heard that.
[00:46:57] Jack Altman: And maybe this is a great exception.
[00:46:59] Trae Stephens: Yeah, it's a great exception to the role.
[00:47:00] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:47:01] Trae Stephens: But I think generally speaking,
[00:47:02] Trae Stephens: the best companies have incredible stories.
[00:47:05] Trae Stephens: Just trying to figure that out is kind of a quick
[00:47:09] Trae Stephens: and easy cheat code for avoiding that.
[00:47:11] Trae Stephens: If you're meeting founders,
[00:47:12] Trae Stephens: is that the main thing you're trying to do?
[00:47:14] Trae Stephens: I mean, it's the first question I always ask.
[00:47:16] Trae Stephens: So tell me about yourself and the origin story of the business.
[00:47:19] Trae Stephens: And then everything else flows from there.
[00:47:21] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:47:22] Jack Altman: Maybe that's a good segue into the last thing
[00:47:23] Jack Altman: I want to talk about, which is just a little bit
[00:47:25] Jack Altman: of your own story and just getting into you as a person
[00:47:29] Jack Altman: a little bit.
[00:47:30] Jack Altman: One of the things I really appreciate
[00:47:31] Jack Altman: is that you've been talking about your religious faith
[00:47:34] Jack Altman: for a long time.
[00:47:35] Jack Altman: And I think that's been something that I think
[00:47:37] Jack Altman: probably a lot of people in tech, obviously,
[00:47:38] Jack Altman: by the numbers a lot have not many people talk about it,
[00:47:42] Jack Altman: or at least they haven't in the past.
[00:47:43] Jack Altman: So why is it something that you've wanted to talk about?
[00:47:46] Jack Altman: Well, I think the kind of weird thing about this
[00:47:48] Trae Stephens: is that I haven't been super intentional about it.
[00:47:51] Trae Stephens: It just so happens to come up all the time.
[00:47:53] Trae Stephens: And I'm not afraid to talk about it.
[00:47:55] Trae Stephens: And then it turns out that a lot of people
[00:47:56] Trae Stephens: resonate with it because a lot of people.
[00:47:57] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:47:58] Trae Stephens: And then it comes up in conversation.
[00:48:00] Trae Stephens: There's been an interesting kind of shift
[00:48:01] Trae Stephens: that we've seen over the last 10 years,
[00:48:04] Trae Stephens: but really even since COVID, where you're starting
[00:48:08] Trae Stephens: to see this sort of theological revival
[00:48:10] Trae Stephens: with people being much more interested
[00:48:12] Trae Stephens: and kind of traditional faith.
[00:48:14] Trae Stephens: I think part of that might just be like,
[00:48:16] Trae Stephens: you know, we went through this decade
[00:48:18] Trae Stephens: plus of like burning man spiritual kind of stuff,
[00:48:22] Trae Stephens: like Eastern mysticism.
[00:48:23] Trae Stephens: And a lot of people came out of that being like,
[00:48:26] Trae Stephens: man, I've done like 12 Iowaska journeys
[00:48:28] Trae Stephens: and I still have a sense of emptiness.
[00:48:31] Trae Stephens: There's something about like the rootedness of like
[00:48:35] Trae Stephens: Judeo-Christian kind of beliefs that are really interesting
[00:48:40] Trae Stephens: to the current moment for one reason or another.
[00:48:44] Trae Stephens: And so I find that there are a lot of people
[00:48:45] Trae Stephens: that just come up to me and ask, like,
[00:48:47] Trae Stephens: I heard that you're a Christian.
[00:48:49] Trae Stephens: Can you explain this to me?
[00:48:50] Trae Stephens: You know, a lot of people traditionally
[00:48:53] Trae Stephens: in Silicon Valley think of Christians
[00:48:54] Trae Stephens: as sort of these backwards, anti-intellectuals or something.
[00:48:58] Trae Stephens: And then they find out that, you know, me or Peter
[00:49:00] Trae Stephens: or, you know, someone that they otherwise respect
[00:49:03] Trae Stephens: intellectually is a Christian.
[00:49:05] Trae Stephens: They're like, okay, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:49:06] Trae Stephens: I'm just curious, like, let's talk about it.
[00:49:09] Trae Stephens: And so it ends up coming up all the time.
[00:49:10] Trae Stephens: It's sort of fine.
[00:49:11] Trae Stephens: It's actually, it's interesting to say that
[00:49:12] Trae Stephens: because you know, you said Judeo-Christian
[00:49:14] Jack Altman: and then for some reason I'm like, I'm Jewish.
[00:49:15] Jack Altman: I have for some reason I feel like Judaism
[00:49:18] Jack Altman: doesn't get that reaction from people of the like,
[00:49:21] Jack Altman: oh, is this like some backwards thing.
[00:49:23] Jack Altman: You know, like, there's a lot in, you know,
[00:49:24] Jack Altman: it's both the Bible and everything like that.
[00:49:26] Jack Altman: What is that?
[00:49:27] Jack Altman: What do you think it is that has, like,
[00:49:28] Jack Altman: is that schism to do with the fact that like,
[00:49:31] Jack Altman: are the beliefs in Christianity like a bit more concrete
[00:49:33] Jack Altman: in a certain way than, you know, Judaism,
[00:49:35] Jack Altman: they're more like floaty or something.
[00:49:38] Jack Altman: Well, I think that there's probably much more
[00:49:40] Trae Stephens: of a cultural kind of part to Judaism
[00:49:42] Trae Stephens: that feels like less tethered to the theology,
[00:49:46] Trae Stephens: whereas like that doesn't exist so much,
[00:49:49] Trae Stephens: especially like in, you know, coastal America,
[00:49:52] Trae Stephens: like maybe in the Midwest or the South,
[00:49:54] Trae Stephens: there's like more of a cultural Christian expectation.
[00:49:58] Trae Stephens: But, you know, if you're in tech in San Francisco,
[00:50:01] Trae Stephens: you have to actually believe in order to be out
[00:50:05] Trae Stephens: or at least talking about this stuff.
[00:50:06] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:50:07] Trae Stephens: I think that's probably one difference.
[00:50:08] Trae Stephens: Maybe another difference is that like, you know,
[00:50:11] Trae Stephens: we have less of an experience in the United States
[00:50:14] Trae Stephens: of Orthodox Judaism than maybe they do in Israel.
[00:50:17] Trae Stephens: But we have much more of an experience
[00:50:19] Trae Stephens: with Orthodox Christianity.
[00:50:21] Trae Stephens: And so we have more of like a cultural societal kind
[00:50:25] Trae Stephens: of debate about the topics that exist.
[00:50:27] Trae Stephens: I'm sure if there were as many Orthodox Jews in America
[00:50:31] Trae Stephens: as there are Orthodox Christians,
[00:50:33] Trae Stephens: you would have a similar level of debate about the topics.
[00:50:37] Trae Stephens: I wonder if like Christianity somehow like ties in
[00:50:41] Jack Altman: with the way that you think about your work at Andral.
[00:50:44] Jack Altman: Mm-hmm.
[00:50:45] Jack Altman: Like I would imagine that there's actually like,
[00:50:46] Jack Altman: quite a lot in terms of the way you'd think about like,
[00:50:48] Jack Altman: morality and what makes, you know, for like a just fight
[00:50:52] Jack Altman: or not and, you know, how to think about people's lives
[00:50:54] Jack Altman: and the stack rank of ethics and things like that.
[00:50:57] Jack Altman: Well, the entirety of just war tradition,
[00:50:59] Trae Stephens: which is like the root of the Western law of war.
[00:51:04] Trae Stephens: Like, you treaties made, like all of this stuff
[00:51:07] Trae Stephens: is rooted in just war theory,
[00:51:09] Trae Stephens: which is a tradition started by St. Augustine.
[00:51:11] Trae Stephens: It was all Christian intellectual thought
[00:51:13] Trae Stephens: from the very beginning.
[00:51:15] Trae Stephens: You know, we benefit a lot from the impact of Christianity
[00:51:19] Trae Stephens: on the development of the West.
[00:51:21] Trae Stephens: And so, yeah, I think that informs a lot of it.
[00:51:24] Trae Stephens: That said, there's also a lot of debate
[00:51:25] Trae Stephens: theologically about these things inside of Christian circles,
[00:51:28] Trae Stephens: you know, like St. Augustine, Martin Luther disagreed
[00:51:32] Trae Stephens: on a bunch of different stuff.
[00:51:34] Trae Stephens: And so I think the robustness of the tradition
[00:51:37] Trae Stephens: enables us to engage in, you know, really, you know,
[00:51:41] Trae Stephens: clarifying ways about how we've reached the beliefs
[00:51:44] Trae Stephens: that we have about the importance of protecting people
[00:51:47] Trae Stephens: who can protect themselves.
[00:51:48] Trae Stephens: And how you think about, you know,
[00:51:51] Trae Stephens: avoiding civilian casualties,
[00:51:52] Trae Stephens: how you think about the quality of persons.
[00:51:55] Trae Stephens: You know, this is all Christian thought,
[00:51:57] Trae Stephens: totally.
[00:51:57] Trae Stephens: It's funny, because it's like, you know,
[00:51:59] Jack Altman: if you want to not grapple with some framework for morality
[00:52:02] Jack Altman: and some sort of way to think about like defense,
[00:52:04] Jack Altman: you might feel good sort of avoiding those topics,
[00:52:07] Jack Altman: but then you end up in a place you don't want to be, I think.
[00:52:09] Jack Altman: Unless you live in a society with a strong monopoly on violence
[00:52:13] Trae Stephens: where you don't have to think about these things
[00:52:15] Trae Stephens: because someone else is better for you.
[00:52:16] Trae Stephens: Yeah.
[00:52:17] Jack Altman: All right.
[00:52:18] Jack Altman: We'll end it there.
[00:52:19] Jack Altman: Try to thank Sponsor to this, really enjoyed it.
[00:52:20] Jack Altman: Great.
[00:52:21] Jack Altman: Thanks, Jack.
[00:52:22] Appreciate it.
