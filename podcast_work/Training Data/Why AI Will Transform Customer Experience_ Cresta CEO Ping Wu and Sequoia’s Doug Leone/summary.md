# [Key Themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h-pGSAfOFM)

### 1. The Abundance vs. Scarcity Mindset in AI Transformation

The most critical shift in thinking about AI's impact on contact centers is moving from a scarcity mindset (job displacement) to an abundance mindset (new interactions and experiences).

**Substantiation:**
Ping Wu stated: "For over hyped, I think it's the mindset of scarcity is the job displacement. I think in the short term is probably a little over hyped. And what's under hyped is the mindset of abundance. Think about new experience that AI can enable... can you talk to a website can directly talk to the app and can you turn a synchronous interaction into a asynchronous interaction... there are so many interaction that today you just cannot happen. And just simply because you do not have the staff."

He elaborated on the long-term vision: "AI agents can make this entire experience a continuous, long going conversation throughout the entire customer journey. And our aim is a perfect tool to do that. And that will really bring the level of personalization, the level of customer experience that wasn't possible before."

### 2. The Last Mile Problem: Why Application Layer Captures Value

The real value in AI accrues not at the infrastructure or model level, but in solving the messy, complex integration challenges in production environments.

**Substantiation:**
Doug Leone emphasized: "Look at the gross margins as you move up markets... I think value is going to crew to quote the application layer. What that ever looks like, you know, it's going to crew up near the customer, near the money, near the business user."

Ping Wu provided concrete evidence: "In order to deploy in some cost centers that today that 20,000 people across multiple continents... how do you get the real time audio... 50% of the conversation happened on premise... how do you handle PIs and then you cannot have the person I find information, you know, unrest. And then by the way, how do you handle, you know, data residency." He concluded: "All these become additional requirements that make something that feel very commoditized like, you know, out of summary, become very, very much harder to do in actually contacts contact center."

### 3. The Hybrid Strategy: Meeting Customers Where They Are

The most successful path to AI transformation isn't full automation, but a phased approach that combines human-agent assistance with autonomous agents.

**Substantiation:**
Ping Wu explained: "Unlike self-driving cars, you really have to automate the entire thing 100% of time. Otherwise, you do not have the economic impact. For context center, we find it's very unique is that the work is very divisible... you can automate X percent of conversation that's ready to be automated. And for the remaining ones, you can still use AI to assist humans."

He noted the strategic advantage: "In order to really do the best possible automation, it's counterintuitively you need to know what actually happened in the context and what are humans actually doing. So not only just the conversations, but also what they're seeing on the screen, that's super important to actually build the best automation possible."

# Contrarian Perspectives

### 1. AI Will Create More Customer Interactions, Not Fewer

While everyone focuses on workforce displacement, the more significant transformation will be AI creating conversations on behalf of customers.

**Substantiation:**
Ping Wu offered this non-obvious insight: "People really seems obsessed with one side of the conversation, which is the workforce. And then people asking how many of the workforce were replaced by AI. But no one ever asked the question is how many inbound calls will be replaced by AI. So my belief is that there will be over the next few years you will probably see a race to getting the AI assistant on the consumer aggregators and and then a lot of things that consumer probably will dedicate to the AI assistant, including making a phone calls."

### 2. The Timeline for Full Automation is Much Longer Than People Think

Despite the hype, the transformation of Fortune 500 contact centers will take significantly longer than anticipated.

**Substantiation:**
Ping Wu shared: "We got this asked this question two years ago when GPD four first came out. And a lot of people will say that maybe in two or three years, there will no longer be humans in the context that are... at that time, our belief is that you're probably the transformation, especially for existing for 4500 companies will probably take way longer than a lot of people think."

He noted research supporting this: "Some garner research actually shows that in none of the fortune 500 over the next five years will have contact center gone entirely humanless."

### 3. AI as Industrial Revolution 2.0, Not Just Another Tool

Most people view AI as an incremental productivity tool similar to mobile or internet. The reality is fundamentally more transformative.

**Substantiation:**
Doug Leone provided this perspective: "I thought of everything else being tools to make us more productive. Meaning we all became networked and we all became network and mobile. I view the I wave as the industrial revolution 2.0. I think this is much, much larger... It was a complete redoing of humanity of how humanity exists, works, lives, enjoys."

Ping Wu added: "One thing AI is very unique is that there's so many surprises. There are surprises of underlying capabilities that you never seen before in internet or mobile age... for AI, I feel there's so many surprises as the underlying model gets better. There are things that even the author is for transformer paper would not have imagined."

### 4. Customer Preference for Humans Over AI is a Transient Problem

The current customer preference for human agents will be overcome by AI's superior training, patience, and capabilities.

**Substantiation:**
Doug Leone stated boldly: "At the limit, it's 100%... I kind of think of gold like versus Bitcoin... it is clear that Bitcoin is going to win. It is clear that Bitcoin is going to be worth more than gold... it is clear that the agents by definition... there's a language component. There's a training component. There's the human component. And I think in all those dimensions, I think AI is going to win in the next two to three years."

# Companies Identified

### 1. Cresta

**Description:** AI-powered contact center platform offering both agent-assist tools and autonomous AI agents, with sub-800ms latency for voice conversations.

**Quotes:**
- Ping Wu on their unique position: "Unlike self-driving cars... the work is very divisible. So first, the conversation is, you know, those are every conversations independent units. And you can automate X percent of conversation that's ready to be automated. And for the remaining ones, you can still use AI to assist humans."
- On technical capabilities: "We streaming into an audio by directional and we orchestrate multiple different models... it's around below 800 milliseconds" latency.
- Doug Leone on their competitive advantage: "We have a whole bunch of stake where a modern company we're best in class of one category. We're going to be best in class in the other category. We have beautiful growing run rate in both the agent assist and in the AI part of the product."

### 2. Eleven Labs

**Description:** Text-to-speech provider being used by Cresta for voice generation.

**Quote:**
Ping Wu mentioned: "For TTS, we yes, we use a lot of lab. There's a great partner. We also use other vendors and we constantly compare the performance."

# Operating Insights

### 1. The River and Rocks Framework for Speed

Remove constraints systematically rather than accepting arbitrary growth targets.

**Substantiation:**
Doug Leone explained: "I paint a picture for the founders of a river a river with rocks and the founders and the CEO's job is to remove those rocks. So when you give me next year's plan, I don't care that's 150% net new AR growth. I want to know why the plan is the plan and I want to challenge you why it's not 3x that and maybe the answer is funding... forcing is forcing the understanding that these companies are capable of doing things which they don't believe they are capable of doing yet."

### 2. Linear Revenue Ramps for Course Correction

Build hiring and revenue plans that allow for mid-course corrections rather than large batch commitments.

**Substantiation:**
Doug Leone advised: "I'm a believer and I hear no we got to train them all the time. Bologna give us us please a revenue ramp that's linear so we can make mid course corruptions up and down and let's not be stuck by these numbers... if you hired 250 sales people in q1 and then you're realizing q3 something's wrong in q3 something's wrong with the product then you stuck with the burn."

### 3. Build Both "Steak and Sizzle" Simultaneously

Successful AI companies need compelling demos AND production-ready operational systems, not one
