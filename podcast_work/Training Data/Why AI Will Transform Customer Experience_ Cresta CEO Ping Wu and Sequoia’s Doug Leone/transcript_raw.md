[00:00:00] Today, if you think about the business, they feel like multiple personality to the customer.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_00: So in the sales phase, they pour you very, very aggressively.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_00: And once you sign up and become a customer, you're dealing with entirely different personality.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: And you're dealing with service departments.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_00: Feel like these are really disconnected.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: And I do feel like AI agents can make this entire experience a continuous
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: long-going conversation throughout the entire customer journey.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: And the LIM is a perfect tool to do that.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_00: And that will really bring the level of personalization, the level of customer
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_00: experience that wasn't possible before.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_00: Hi and welcome to Training Data.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: Today, we're joined by Cresta CEO, Peng Wu, and Sequoia's Doug Leoni, who sits on the Cresta board.
[00:01:02] Today's episode dives into the gnarly world of the contact center.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_01: A giant legacy industry filled with slow moving incumbents that is responsible for driving the vast majority of company customer conversations.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_01: Peng understands this world deeply, having first built Google's contact center business, before becoming product leader and then CEO of Cresta.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_01: Peng joins us to talk about the different waves of technology that have hit the call center,
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_01: how he sees the future of customer experience evolving with LLMs towards an abundance future.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: And his playbook is to meet customers where they are, blending human agent assists with autonomous digital agents.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_01: Doug Leoni also shares his perspectives from several decades of investing in company building, and his hot takes on whether we're in an AI bubble.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_01: He also shares where he believes the value will accrue an AI.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: Hint, it's in the application layer in this gnarly last mile.
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_01: Enjoy the show.
[00:01:55] Thank you for bringing me bringing along our special guest, Doug Leoni as well on your board.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: My pleasure. Thank you.
[00:02:03] Thank you both for joining.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_01: Peng, I'm going to start by asking a big part of the AI thesis is that AI is going to replace labor globally, and that the tam is in the tens of trillions of dollars.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_01: Obviously the contact center, the call center is a big pool of labor that is just begging to be automated.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_01: Have you had to guess how much of call center labor spend will actually be automated fully by AI?
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so we internally were spent a lot of time debating about this.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: The reality is I don't think anyone knows for sure.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: And if you ask, depends on really what they're selling.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: And you ask different people and they give you different answers.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: And some people will say that 100% human will be gone in contact center.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: And some garner research actually shows that in none of the fortune 500 over the next five years will have contact center gone entirely humanless.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, it's also probably falling to somewhere in the middle.
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: And in fact, we got this asked this question two years ago when GPD for first came out.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: And a lot of people will say that maybe in two or three years, there will no longer be humans in the context that are.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_00: And so at that time, our belief is that you're probably the transformation, especially for existing for 4500 companies will probably take way longer than a lot of people think.
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_01: Doug, what do you think? What's your bet?
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_01: At the limit, it's 100%.
[00:03:28] But I'm mindful that there are still IBM mainframes and cobalt being used in American banking system.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_02: So to me is that really what percent to me is the speed of which is going to happen is going to happen within 10, 20, 25 years, 30 years because whether the answer is 30% or 60% if it happens in 50 years, that means one thing for companies that crossed that if it happens in three years, I mean something else.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_02: So the end number is not the relevant metric for me to me is a speed of adoption.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_01: Great distinction.
[00:04:06] Paying you've been working in the contact center AI space for well over decade prior to becoming CEO at Cresta, you ran the equivalent function over at Google.
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_01: And so maybe for those of us in the audience that don't know the contact center market, can you tell us a little bit about what it is, how big it is and how technology has served it so far?
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, when first talk about contacts and a lot of people will naturally think about cost centers, a lot of humans sitting there listening, answering costs, right.
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_00: But contact center really is a broader category that including the only channel interactions from emails to digital chats and you know on website and apps and also including costs, of course.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: And the overall market is quite big and there are historically there are around 17 to 20 million agents human agents actually work in the contact center for the software market is probably in the tens of billions and for AI market, according to some research, it will be in the high tens of billions of dollars.
[00:05:12] And is the use case mostly, you know, customers calling in to complain customer support, is that what these these contact centers are mostly used for.
[00:05:20] Oh, so yeah, so customer call in there are all kind of reason they call it right a complaints or fixing the issue, but also I think a lot of people may not realize that there are probably a quarter of the contact center 25% is actually revenue generating.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: So I think selling staff or collecting money or retaining customers and that kind of conversations so it's not 100% customer support.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: So I have a question for you that I never asked you if you look at the contact center and I'm old enough to date myself.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_02: You go back 30 years, you heard names of I and God knows whoever else that's barely living in and out of bankruptcy.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_02: You go back 15 years, you see Genesis of the world.
[00:06:04] What caused a bright young engineer or ping woo 15 years ago to be attracted with this market and one could have said it's always been a staggy market.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_02: It's always been of low interest.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_02: It always created these slow growing companies.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_02: What is it that interested you now?
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_02: Of course, now we understand it's a vibrant market with lots of opportunity, but during the clock back 10 years ago, what attracted you to this?
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_02: What attracted you to this market?
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_02: First of all, 15 years ago, I didn't even realize that's a long history of slow growth of the market.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: Otherwise, maybe I would think differently.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: And second, at that time, I just do remember there's a period of time.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_00: There's a lot of excitement, a conversation, AI technology, and especially around consumer facing speakers.
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: And at that time, people think that that would disrupt Google.
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: And that would be the most exciting opportunity for a conversation AI to transform.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: And it's because it has all the issues that traditionally people get excited about.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: We see it get excited about.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: It's a massive market.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_00: A lot of people are working there.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: And it's in the middle between businesses and customers.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_00: And it's all interaction going through.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: And also, no one's happy in contact center.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: So if you, you know, by no one, I mean, there are three different parties.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_00: There are customers that call in that most of us may not be too happy because the wait time is very long.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: And agents, by the way, I think a lot of people may not realize the agent, the workforce nutrition in contact center is massive.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: It's our average of 35 to 40%.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: In some cases, during COVID, some company have more than 100% turnover.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's very high stress.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: And it's a lot of people are not aware of it.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's very high stress.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_01: And it's not a very fun job.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: And also the business also feel like they're always the opportunity to do more with less.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_00: It seems no one is happy and it's a massive market.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: But I think, you know, that's the great opportunity for AI and technology to bring abundance.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: And then abundance is the answer, in my opinion, to solve all these issues.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_00: So you were working on this at Google 10 years ago.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: I would imagine this was the small language model wave in the bird days.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_01: With the technology ready at that point and maybe walk us through the different waves of technology that have hit the contact center.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So that's a great question.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: Even longer before that, there's technology called IVR.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: And that you press one, two, three for different routes and through for different core reasons.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: And then since then, there are innovation around the input.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: Right. You can instead of pressing, you can directly speak natural language.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: And that's with the advance of natural language processing and TTS and text to speech generation.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: That experience getting better and better for when we first start in contacts on AI Google.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_00: It's even before birth, actually.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: It's before Transformers.
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_00: It's mainly using AI or at that time using AI to do classification in 10 classification and entity extraction using pre transformer models.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: And then but the conversation experiences still manually crafted.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_00: Right. So so that's the last generation of technology.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: And then after that, of course, the transformer came along.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: Initially, it's also before classification purposes.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_00: Still the experience is manually crafted.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_00: But then the LIMs entirely changed the whole thing.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_00: Not only the conversation experience on automation side, but also just you can understand conversation in the way that never was able before.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_00: And what does that mean practically in terms of the rollout of this technology inside contact centers?
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: Does it mean that, you know, customers were just extremely unhappy when it was IVR and then they were slightly less unhappy when you started to have kind of more transformers in the flow and now.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_01: Now customers are very happy to be talking to an LIM based agent or how is the evolution of technology.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_01: Change the customer experience.
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I think the way we like to think about it is really from the first principle, right?
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: And you know, there are a lot of the conversations shouldn't even happen in our view.
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: And you know, the fact that it happens because the customer is not happy.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_00: I think the solution for that is to use the AI to really understand to bring 100% visibility into all interaction in the context center today.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: And using AI to analyze it and then to do deep research and then find out the root cause.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: And then that usually reflects on process broken or website updates that freak out people or you know, for more update that bring down now working all that kind of stuff.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_00: So you need to fix that first, right? And first, you know, avoid interaction if it's not necessary.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: Right. And you know, PR that I do feel like, you know, there AI can automatically automate a lot of interactions that no one wants to have.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, neither the business nor the customer want to have those interactions.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: Those are what we call low emotion value interactions that should be self self served.
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_00: And on top of that, I do think that context center AI will enable new interactions.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: That's the ones that you cannot afford to do that today.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_00: So all these are improving customer experience.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_00: Do you think and customers will ever prefer talking to an AI agent over a human agent and have we reached that point yet?
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_01: So look, I mean, that's a really interesting question. So I've been thinking about this in on my way here.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_00: So I never met anyone that have this experience of talking to a customer support agent on the phone and go, I'm really frustrated.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_00: Same your AI please. And we never had experience. And in fact, that our encourage people to lock up some of the, you know, some of the companies in a search for their customer service.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: Right. The first question that people ask on Google and Google will surface what is the most popular question.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_00: The first question is always how do I talk to a life person for this type of, you know, customer service.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_00: So, so I think that that time probably hasn't arrived 40 years. It depends on what kind of interactions again.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_00: I'm maybe too techno optimistic or agi pilled here, but I feel like I've seen some recordings now where you know,
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: they can be emotionally intelligent. It has infinite patience, right? It's not trying to hit some metric on time to resolution.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_01: And so for example, if somebody calls in and they're having a really bad day, for example, your AI can be a lot more patient and empathetic than a human agent even could.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_01: And so I'm sort of optimistic on the side of the, the bots here.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_01: Well, I agree. There's the human component of patience or the subtleties of humanity, but there's also the training of the agent versus the training of the AI.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_02: Three years from now, who's going to be much more, much more equipped to answer a question. It's clear that AI is the answer.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_02: I kind of think of gold like versus Bitcoin. Some of the analogy came to my mind, as you said, that it is clear that Bitcoin is going to win.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_02: It is clear that Bitcoin is going to be worth more than gold. It is not investment advice, not investment advice, but it is clear that the agents by definition, and a lot of which don't even reside in America, there's a language component.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_02: You know, I'm not saying anything bad about the agents, but there's a language component. There's a training component. There's the human component.
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_02: And I think in all those dimensions, I think AI is going to win in the next two to three years.
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_02: Bitcoin as digital gold is a really interesting analogy to the agent, the digital agent versus the human agent question.
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. From our perspective, we really want to meet customer with the R today.
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_00: So unlike self-driving cars, you really have to automate the entire thing 100% of time. Otherwise, you do not have the economic impact.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_00: For context center, we find it's very unique is that the work is very divisible. So first, the conversation is, you know, those are every conversations independent units.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: And you can automate X percent of conversation that's ready to be automated. And for a lot of reason, we can get into details.
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: And then for the remaining ones, you can still use AI to assist humans. And to, you know, take away the initial maybe 10% of the interactions like authentication or intake or lead qualification.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: And then take away all the after-call work. And also have AI agents to help humans in the middle of the conversation to do knowledge retrieval, to do data entries, all that stuff.
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_00: So that's not mutually exclusive. And as long as we feel like customer not ready to say that we just need to turn on our cross-center today and then go for AI, we feel like there is a long, you know, depending again, what kind of business and what kind of, you know, technical, you know, the IT infrastructure.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_00: So I think the journey will probably take different time frame, but our goal is really meet the customer with the R.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_00: So cross is an interesting position because you both have the agent assist product that helps make existing contact center agents more productive.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_01: And then you have the actual AI agent product that is directly customer facing, you know, autonomous agents.
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_01: Where do you think most customers are today? Are they ready to go full force, just, you know, put the agent on my website, let it go crazy.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_01: Are they, you know, experimenting with that? What, where is the customer today?
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_01: It depends on the customer. If you and I start a e-bike store today on Shopify and we can automate 100%. I'm sure because it really depends on how complex is a product.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_00: It can be ordered or magnitude difference between like a simple product like e-bike or versus a real world touching many different countries and then millions of tens of millions of people.
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_00: So it's very different and then that impact the complexity of the conversation handle by the contact center.
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_00: And then the other part is the IT infrastructure. A lot of people may actually realize that before you actually enter the contact center, you will feel like, oh, this should be easily very easy to automate.
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_00: The reality is, a lot of those things that human do in the contact center today are optimized for humans.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_00: And those system record or the system action ticketing system, these has been around for decades. A lot of them just simply do not have APIs. Right. So the only thing that to make changes is to a graphic interface that optimize for humans.
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_00: And without a real time API, just, you know, again, these are not AI problems. And we believe that, you know, these are the opportunities that we work with our customer to develop those real time APIs.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: So that's why we feel like those transformation depends on the nature of the business would take different time playing.
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. It's interesting you made the self driving car analogy earlier because I was thinking about your business earlier this morning. And if you've got Tesla, part of the beauty of them getting to full autonomy is that they have so much data coming in from their cars, even when they're on L2, right.
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_01: For you guys, because you are the call center, I said, you were the agents assist, you actually get full data of the conversation, whether it's, you know, voice, whether it's whether it's conversational based digitally and you that can become a training base for customers to automate more and more of their conversations over to the agent over time.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_01: Yes, 100% and in fact, when we first, my first, the journey when I first started seven, eight years ago, it's really automation only I really believe it should be automation only fast forward. We're running to all kind of real deployments.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_00: And then we really actually brought in my own horizon, then I believe that in order to really do the best possible automation, it's counterintuitively you need to know what actually happened in the context and what are humans actually doing.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_00: So not only just the conversations, but also what they're seeing on the screen, that's super important to actually build the best automation possible.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_00: One of them is the sex appeal. It's the sizzle. It's what everybody wants to talk about, which you have to have otherwise your entire company. The other is the realities have a business of run and what they need.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_02: And so if you are one of these new age companies, you're quickly going to hit a wall because you don't have the data and you don't have the systems that you really need to run a context center.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_02: But if you're at the former, don't have the latter, then you're labeled as an online company. So here in our case, we understood this a while back and we make sure we invested.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_02: Not only we double down on the operational system for agents, but we also developed the sex appeal product because that's what all our customers want to talk about, they want.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: And another aspect of it is really just tied to the point I make earlier is that a lot of those costs shouldn't really happen.
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_00: People call in, there's no way to make them happy. It's because they're not happy to begin with.
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_00: And if your product works, if your process works, they shouldn't really happen. So if look, if this room we feel really cold, maybe the answer is not a heater.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_00: Maybe there's a broken window or there is a patio door wide open. The solution is turn on the light and a sea, the root cause and then fix that first and before you turn on the heater.
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:19:04] Love that.
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_01: Customer support is one of those canonical examples of where people think large language models will be most transformative.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_01: And you know, it's almost a consensus category for ventures startups at this point.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_01: But how do you compete? What is it like to to compete when everyone has access to the same old limbs and as you know, latching on to the same big picture vision.
[00:19:24] Yes. So again, in order to really deliver value in the context and the transformation, it's not just the models.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: It's just not a model model is bunch of weights and the data and in itself is not going to provide a value. Right.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_00: And now the question is, how much you need to build on top of it to deliver that value. If that layer is very, very thin, then our argument probably is you don't have much opportunity to keep value.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_00: Right. And then also if that layer will be gone with the model gets better, there's no way you have a durable business. But that is not a case for context centers and in where majority of agencies is still on premise.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_00: And where a lot of there are so many look average agents in the Fortune 500, we look at some surveys, they interact with eight to 10 different systems.
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_00: Remember, these companies also apply other companies over years, over decades, those back and system may not even talk to each other.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_00: You know, depends on where you book the flights or depends on where you book the hotel. They made me to log into different systems. Right. So that's the reality we're talking about.
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_00: So that's why, you know, we believe is our strategy is meeting customer where they are and and and drive value on day one.
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_00: Brother, the integration from the stake to the sizzle. That's how you win. What do you think is over hyped and what's under hyped in the kind of contact center AI space right now?
[00:20:49] Yeah, for over hyped, I think it's the mindset of scarcity is the job displacement. I think in the short term is probably a little over hyped.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: And what's under hyped is the mindset of abundance.
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_00: Think about new experience that AI can enable.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_00: You know, for example, can you talk to a website can directly talk to the app and can you turn a synchronous interaction into a asynchronous interaction.
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_00: Can you talk to the airline app and say that I want to do this XYZ and then call me back when you get it done. Right. And then can you have that super multi language AI agents to have those conversations or there are so many interaction that today you just cannot happen.
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_00: And just simply because you do not have the staff right so and then the other thing actually I feel is really under hyped is people really seems obsessed with one side of the conversation, which is the workforce.
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_00: And then people asking how many of the workforce were replaced by AI. But no one ever asked the question is how many inbound calls will be replaced by AI.
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_00: So my belief is that there will be over the next few years you will probably see a race to getting the AI assistant on the consumer aggregators and and then a lot of things that consumer probably will dedicate to the AI assistant, including making a phone calls.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_00: So I think that's maybe an interesting thing to pay attention to.
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_00: That's really cool. Okay. So you could talk to the United Airlines app and have it, you know, I synchronously go figure something out for you and call you back. Is that something that you're working on.
[00:22:30] Where no coming out that. Okay, very cool. Can I transition to talk a little bit about company building. Doug, you've been around the block for a while.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_01: See the movie a few times means I'm old. That's what you just said.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_02: I was trying to say nice. Yes. How is building a company right now? You're seeing this slide with being how how is building a company in AI different from from your, you know, your last few decades of building legendary companies.
[00:22:58] It's not very different. What I mean by that is you need a terrific founder and we'll talk about the crust of the situation a little later, hopefully.
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_02: You need to plug in world class engineers at the very start unless you start with a pluses you'll never move up you'll only be moving down.
[00:23:21] You have to plug in sales people that are not administrators that are fresh. Maybe there were regional sales manager early on because one you can't get the world class people and two if you get them that to date for the company.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_02: You have to figure out what the ramp is that you're willing to fund. You have to figure out what the role of marketing is.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_02: You have to solve this thing that I called the merchandising cycle that's been getting some play online, which is from product marketing to BDRs to revenue wherever that's broken and looks like a bad sales guy, bad BPO sales, but you have to get that right.
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_02: And so I think the business fundamentals are very are very similar.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_02: I do think one of the characteristics of the companies that are doing the best now right now is they just move with extreme speed and maybe that's always been the case, but I think it's it's even more intense right now.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: How do you think of instilling the need for speed in the companies you work with and even that Sequoia.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_01: So I thought of answering that as part of my answer and the reason I left it out all the boards I'm on move with extreme speed.
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_02: And that's because I paint a picture for the founders of a river a river with rocks and the founders and the CEO's job is to remove those rocks.
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_02: So when you give me next year's plan, I don't care that's 150% net new AR growth. I want to know why the plan is the plan and I want to challenge you why it's not 3x that and maybe the answer is funding.
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_02: Where we can get funding in this market maybe the answer is management experience. Well, that's often a good answer. Some people will say market. Well, no way that's market where a little company that is.
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_02: And so in my mind is forcing is forcing the understanding that these companies are capable of doing things which they don't believe they are capable of doing yet.
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_02: And to remove those rocks and I push and I push and I push and I said why can't we go faster and do it in a linear fashion because got the bit something isn't going to happen if you hired 250 sales people in q1 and then you're realizing q3 something's wrong in q3 something's wrong with the product then you stuck with the burn.
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_02: So I'm a believer and I hear no we got to train them all the time. Bologna give us us please a revenue ramp that's linear so we can make mid course corruptions up and down and let's not be stuck by these numbers.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_02: We have 10 fingers 100% growth that's all bullshit. How fast can we possibly grow that's always been the mantra and all the boards that had served on.
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_02: AI is not different. What does Creston need to do next so what is Creston need to do over the next five plus years in order to become a great company, a legendary company.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_01: So well, first of all, it has to continue to develop product. It has to continue to put one front one foot in front of the other. It has to always see whenever some people reach a pita principle of their role.
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_02: It has to be relatively aggressive in making sure it hires people that are capable of taking it from that point on and forward. Stay away from these quote very experienced people that start feeling a bit like suits and administrators point one. That's the most important thing.
[00:26:39] But the other thing that Crest has to do it is to up its game in marketing. There is a lot of companies I used to word the sizzle. There's a lot of company with a lot of sizzle and no stake.
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_02: We have a whole bunch of stake where a modern company we're best in class of one category. We're going to be best in class in the other category. We have beautiful growing run rate in both the agent assist and in the AI part of the product in the automated part of the product.
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_02: I just think we need to attach a marketing overlay. So we become a household name out of the market.
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_02: Wonderful. Well glad you're on the podcast then.
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_01: Maybe stepping back. Doug you've seen some market cycles. Are we in an AI bubble?
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_01: The word bubble implies you invest money in and you lose money because either due to lack of supply of companies or abundance of capital.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_02: I just certainly an abundance of capital. But I've noticed over the last two cycles. The internet cycle with net skip going public in 95. Two great companies being built in a late 90s in Google and Amazon.
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_02: A few others names like into me. Then a bit of a pause. Even the words I heard. The internet is a fraud. It's not going to do anything and then three years later the world went crazy.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_02: That latency was a lot less than mobile. I remember my first look at these apps and Jim gets an ad from a partner said,
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_02: I didn't make money from a $19 app. I had to build a multi billion dollar company never thinking of Airbnb never thinking of door dash.
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_02: A year or two later we saw it being in door dash. Again that from initial birth to real market shrunk from the internet.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_02: I think this is shrunk even further. I think AI is here. I think you have to invest. I think you're the friend on a cycle which doesn't mean you have to invest in everything.
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_02: But one of the mistakes that we made at Sequoia is whenever we see a bit of revenue momentum we have some geniuses around the partners meeting that say,
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_02: oh, it can stop. It can be substituted. Keep it very easy. You see a small company with regular momentum in a friend on the market.
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_02: I'm not talking about the SaaS market in 2021 where you're down to niche verticals at the front of the market.
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_02: You start seeing the model coming revenue momentum you lean in and you hold your nose on price.
[00:29:06] Love that. As you think about where value of crews in the market there's you know there's compute. There's other infrastructure. There's the foundation models.
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_01: There's the application layer. Where do you think value of crews up? It always a cruise up.
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_02: Just look at the gross margins as you move up markets. Look at the gross margins in the chip companies. Look at the gross margins of the system companies. Look at the gross margin.
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_02: Oh, this well, but that's an and video of which we were the first investor is a great company.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_02: Jensen was able to see the future many years ahead and he pulled one of the great probably the greatest coup in Silicon Valley.
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_02: What he did, it's just spectacular. But wait, for looking over time, I think value is going to crew to quote the application layer.
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_02: What that ever looks like, you know, it's going to crew up near the customer, near the money, near the business user.
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_02: I agree. How do you think the AI wave is different than in a mobile?
[00:30:06] I thought of everything else being tools to make us more productive.
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_02: Meaning we all became networked and we all became network and mobile.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_02: I view the I wave as the industrial revolution 2.0. I think this is much, much larger.
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_02: I remember thinking boy, we have just seen the biggest market caps five years ago. Why is it because it was connectivity that created this revenue growth.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_02: Never imagine that there was this thing. It was going to be much bigger than connectivity and the mobility.
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_02: It was a complete redoing of humanity of how humanity exists, works, lives, enjoys.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_02: And I think AI is both going to be a wonderful thing for us and maybe even a kiss of death for us over the next 10, 20 years.
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I totally agree with what Doug said. And I think one thing AI is very unique is that there's so many surprises.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_00: There are surprises of underlying capabilities that you never seen before in internet or mobile age.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_00: If you take, you know, if you take the world view in 2015 and take a time machine to give that to someone in 2007 when Steve Jobs first introduced iPhone,
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_00: I think someone can resonate with that. And then same for internet. I think people can kind of foresee what's coming.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: But for AI, I feel there's so many surprises as the underlying model gets better.
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_00: There are things that even the author is for transformer paper will not have imagined some of the capability that just came after the large language models and that can change the surprises.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_00: So I do think that a lot of the improvements is not linear. It's really from zero to one continued happening at the bottom layer.
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_00: So I think that's something that make it even more exciting.
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_00: You know, I'm going to remind you something in March of 2022, which now sounds like an eternity.
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_02: It was my last annual meeting where we meet with all the investors.
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_02: And it was a good buy kind of thing, you know, where I presented performance and everything. And I had a slide that talked about all the waves back from the chip wave to the seventh to the systems wave to the land slash one wave to int in a to mobile.
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_02: And the next box, a short three and a half years ago was a question mark.
[00:32:48] We did not know as a partnership and we are as advanced as anybody. We are we are the bleeding edge investor, right? And see we did not see the wave coming.
[00:32:58] And this wave has been a tsunami. And I don't think there's any end in sight.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_02: Thank you. Thank you for sharing those insights.
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_01: Do you want to talk about Crescent's technical staff stack or should we should we bug ping on that?
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_01: Well, in fact, I'm going to have to go in a few minutes because I'm in a process of recoding some of the.
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_02: Are you vibes coding the.
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, yes, yes, some life's coding everything.
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_02: Ping, tell us about the tech stack.
[00:33:23] So we have a pretty broad surface or product and I can maybe talk about the voice AI agent.
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_00: We we streaming into an audio by directional and we orchestrate multiple different models and there are speech detects model and then noise cancellation model to improve the audio.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_00: And then there are models that detect the terms and the speech activities and to handle interruptions and then of course there's a foundation model.
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_00: And to handle the conversation and you know, the other side is the TTS text generation model right and then in parallel, we also run multiple smaller models to do our real checking and to make sure that nothing is going crazy.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_00: And as well as those models will do companies specific kind of checks.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_00: For example, never give out tax advice or never give out financial promises, things like that.
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_00: Right. And then that's the wrong time of voice AI agent.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_00: And also there's design time there are components like running large scale simulation to really stress tests the AI agent to cover all the edge cases.
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_00: There's test case management components and similarly, if you think about our voice AI assistant.
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_00: So it's also streaming audio but again, so there's a lot of similarity between the infrastructure, but it's now by directional right it's one direction.
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_00: And in listening to the call and then understand what's actually happening to call with two humans right and an oxygenating 10 plus more models actually.
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_00: And and you know, in fact, we similar similar to vertex in auto ML, we have a platform that can allow customers to build their custom models and to detect interesting events in the conversation.
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_00: So and then marry that with with workflows and people use that to and and to detect fraud for even used to detect fraud, cause and fraud to train agents to how to handle objections.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_00: There are so many use cases that now with that tool we can operate, we can express and trigger workflows.
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_00: And underneath is teacher student distillation to distill into very small models that we can run in real time and to understand to human conversations.
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_00: What's the latency when I talk to one of your agents.
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_01: So it's around below 800 milliseconds.
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_00: Wow. So it feels like talking to a human.
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:35:47] Yes.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_01: So you're running all these models in the near real time then.
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_01: Are you running open source models or are you running 11 labs in equivalent.
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_01: So across the platform, there are 20 different models, some open source and fine fine, humans that are small models that for example, we only do chat or email for human agents and we auto complete their sentences and type ahead.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_00: Those are very, very small models.
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_00: And for TTS, we yes, we use a lot of lab.
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_00: There's a great partner.
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_00: We also use other vendors and we constantly compare the performance.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_00: Really cool.
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_00: And then the actual meat of the conversation though, the dialogue or the conversational flow.
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_01: How do you control that in a way that's not so rigid that it's like the IVR systems of yesterday.
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_01: But not so freeform that customers can go crazy and get their refunds on our line tickets and have the bots say crazy things and embarrass the customers.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_01: Like how do you control the flow and get the both of the best of both worlds.
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So it's really just how you train humans.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_00: You give them the specification about what's the goal and these are the tools and then have the, that's the beauty of large language models to handle those messy kind of workflows.
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_00: So there's a lot of discussion about what's workflow, what's a genetic workflow is anything you can write a dying code.
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_00: That's that by step, that's workflow and carwash carwash is actually workflow.
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_00: If you think about oboe by tea milk tea, you know, those are physical workflows, but they cannot do other things for human conversation is very messy.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_00: It's not linear. Right. So it's like, you know, so that's how the agentic workflow come in. That's where LMS really good at.
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_00: And and on top of those, so you want to determine nism, right.
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_00: And that's how we're introduced the testing, the simulation and then the car rails to make sure that whenever you have a change in any part of system, the behavior is still expected.
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_00: Do you tune your customers models to because because you also have this agent assist products that you're in the flow of all these customer conversations.
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_01: Do you tune the agent to that training data or is it completely net new forward deployed engineers on site mapping out conversations.
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So we have a tool that can map from, you know, what's actually in the human conversation to extract the blueprint of the conversation.
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_00: Right. So, you know, I think the beauty of that again is to discover a lot of unknown. So there are a lot of topics and there's a lot of things that reason people call in.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_00: You may not even know that may actually contain the call volume very large call volume. And then once you have that, you can now look deeper and you can use a lot to do all these analysis and extract water 57 different ways that people express the same intent.
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_00: And what are the different ways that the call flow will go right and then we can summarize and extract that right. So all these are building the products and then they in fact the tooling gets better for the point engineers will just keep you lot more efficient.
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_00: And then there are also other ways we use the human side of conversations. For example, we extract the model for the visitors. So that's how you build your simulation and the simulations a huge part of improving the agent.
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_00: And we believe that having access to exactly how your real customer humans come in and describe ways in the different ways. Sometimes it's very messy. You can extract the model and into better simulation on your a agent as well.
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_00: And then what methods do you use to make LLM really bespoke for customer environments like is it rag is it prompt engineering is it fine tuning is it all of the above reinforcement learning like what are the most optimistic on in terms of techniques.
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_01: Yes, so we use almost everything and to definitely prompting and then and rag and for for those simple agents, but we're still exploring, you know, by looking at the human behavior and then the outcomes, how do you use RL to improve this end to performance.
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: And but you know for a agent by itself, I think the foundation model itself is already pretty pretty good. You just need to get the best out of it. At least for a digital channel for chat. But for other use cases, there's a lot of opportunity to find you the models and to make them.
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_00: You know for task like summarization for task like auto completion sentences and that kind of stuff. I feel like there's a lot of room to extract from the fine tuning open source models.
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_00: What goes in the building as successful Fleshy demo versus production ready AI systems.
[00:40:17] So that's a really interesting question because I think one thing unique about AI is that there's a huge gap between the demo and production.
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_00: And on one end of spectrum, you have rocket launches. The rocket launches the demo is the production and the production is the demo. You cannot fake it. Right. But for AI, it's it's little different.
[00:40:37] SPEAKER_00: And you know, I can just give you example right so auto summary auto summary feels like commodity capability that you know anyone can use chat GBT to create auto summary.
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_00: But in order to deploy in some cost centers that today that 20,000 people across multiple continents cost centers and the challenge.
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_00: A huge list of challenges. First, how do you get the real time audio in the demo? You can you know, demo very easy on on to in the cloud.
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_00: But remember 50% of the conversation happened on premise. Right. And then and then sometime, you know, the how the access that will cause a lot of money as well. And then how do you go around that.
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_00: And then in the real call 20,000 agent calls, there are transfers. There are a lot of transfers. And then there are third parties, third callers that come in that healthcare specialist.
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_00: All that need to be transcribed and summarized. And sometimes the conversation goes so long. How do you handle like three hour four hour calls that go a BR the contact window. Right. And and then things like, you know, is there background noise.
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_00: And then things things like, you know, for different core reasons, there can be different templates. You really, really want to extract these type of information. You cannot miss that. How do you make sure you do that almost 100% of time.
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, how do you handle PIs and then you cannot have the person I find information, you know, unrest. And then by the way, how do you handle, you know, data residency.
[00:42:02] SPEAKER_00: If you are talking to multi continental multinational bank or our healthcare provider. So all these become additional requirements that make something that feel very commoditized like, you know, out of summary, become very, very much harder to do in actually contacts contact center.
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_00: And that's why you need a product mind, the chief executive officer for one of these companies.
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_02: Absolutely. And this is also why all the pain and all the values in the last mile is why the value is in the application layer.
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I tend to agree with that.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_00: Talks about the future. What happens if everything goes right? What does that mean for Cresta and what does that mean for the world?
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_01: I think the AI will just like any technology before it. Like electricity will disappear. It will disappear into workflows. And I think, you know, 20, 30 years later, no one will realize that they may actually talking to AI or is a human assistant.
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_00: By AI, there's one thing I'm really excited about is that today, if you think about the business, right. And they feel like multiple personality to the customer.
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_00: So in the sales face or the marketing phase, they really, really want to talk to you. They call you very, very aggressively.
[00:43:16] SPEAKER_00: And once you sign up and become a customer, you dealing with entirely different personality, right. And you're dealing with service departments and they use tend to use the terms like tier defense deflection and to just handle, you know, to refer to the exact person that they were reporting just a few days ago.
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_00: And then even if you have a long conversation on the customer support line and share a lot of feedback two weeks later, another department will come in. What's your feedback? How about you feel of this survey?
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_00: You know, to our business feel like these are really disconnected, right. And I do feel like AI agents can make this entire experience a continuous, long going conversation throughout the entire customer journey.
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_00: And our aim is a perfect tool to do that. And that will really bring the level of personalization, the level of customer experience that wasn't possible before.
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the point that really stuck with me that you said earlier was about kind of the scarcity versus the abundance mindset. And, you know, how much can businesses to customer communications really evolve and, you know, app experiences really evolve.
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_01: If you take the abundance mindset to bring you a lens into into this field. Thank you, paying. Thank you, Doug, for joining us today. I love this conversation.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_01: Thank you. Thank you for having us.
