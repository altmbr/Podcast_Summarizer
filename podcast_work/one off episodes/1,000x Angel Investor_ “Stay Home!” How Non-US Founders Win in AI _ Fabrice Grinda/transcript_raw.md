[00:00:00] I see a Chih-GPT to me as an existential threat to Google because OpenAI is very aggressive,
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: very smart, and they are very ambitious.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_00: I am sure that they don't want mid-Journey to win in images, and they don't want to run
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: away to win in video, and they don't want cursor and lovable to win in coding, etc.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_00: I think it's way more of a Google situation where they're going to try to win as many
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: of the verticals they can.
[00:00:23] Now, they have to choose what to focus on.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: Hi, Ferris.
[00:00:26] Welcome to the show.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_01: Thank you for having me.
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_00: It's great to have you.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_01: As I told you, I'm a big fan of your content and story as an investor.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: But I think I would love to start with a more personal note because you had a huge success
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_01: with OLX, a company that people outside the US, I'm sure have interacted with.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: I interacted with it.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_01: I said, as a user, as a consumer, they grow in up in Peru and in Mexico.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_01: And you had the exit, so everything was great, global recognition, or you see big, big
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: amount of money.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_01: The validation that you made it.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_01: But I've read that it was very anti-climatic for you.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_01: And you end up deciding to take a different path.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: So take us to that moment.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_01: What do you feel specifically that forced you to change your life in a radical way?
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_01: So it wasn't really the exit that was the issue, right?
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_00: Like the exit, we was in 2010, and they gave me the money to win the war.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_00: So then we win the war where the biggest competitor, we merged 51-49 for us.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: And also, we're a 10,000 employee company in 3D countries.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: And I wake up one day and I'm like, look, on paper, I'm top of the world.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_00: I'm a CEO of this huge company.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_00: Everything's amazing.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_00: In St. traffic, people love what we do.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_00: We're getting love letters from users.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: And because we have so much traffic, every test we do is statistically significant.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_00: All the VCs tell you, oh, do AB testing.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_00: When you have 20 users, AB testing doesn't mean anything.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_00: It can be like random decision by a user, like completely messes things up.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_00: And so, but when you have 20 million unique today, everything's statistically significant.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_00: The problem is, I just felt bored.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: I was like, you know, I'm a product CEO.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_00: I'd like the playing with the product and having a highly skilled team that was small,
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_00: moving very quickly.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: And all of a sudden, we're part of a large, publicly traded organization where we need
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: to create an annual budget, quarterly budget, and update the quarterly budget.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_00: And like the job was just not compelling.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: So on paper, it's sad and fantastic.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: By the day to day, it was very not, it was not interesting.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, you know, the point of actually being successful is to live the life you
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: want to lead, not to, not to be recognized.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: The recognition doesn't do anything for you.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_00: Do you think that's inevitable as a company grows and becomes successful?
[00:02:47] Maybe wouldn't is not inevitable if you keep being the master of your own destiny, meaning
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_00: if it remains in my company.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: The problem is in order to get the funds I needed to win, I had to do a deal with master's
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_00: process.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_00: They ended up being the majority owner, so it was no longer my company.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: And so they didn't want me playing with product and doing the things I wanted to do.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_00: So I think some people have been able to retain it for a long time.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: You know, Steve Jobs, that Apple was able to do that for a long time when he came back.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: It's probably true with Mark Zuckerberg and probably the larger extent with Jeff Bezos.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: But that was definitely not true anymore in my own company.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: And so I'm like, you know, Jobs is not interesting anymore.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: I'd rather do something else.
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: Also, as a kid, my dream was to be a public internet CEO.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_00: The thing is, being a public CEO changed a lot between the 1980s when I was dreaming about
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: it.
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_00: And the 2010s were all sudden you have like section 404.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_00: So I've been so excited.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: And it became very uncompaling to be public.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_00: Not a mention you give all your information to your competitors.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: So I'm like, you know, if I have to do it ever again, I would rather not go public.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: You've written about questioning societies default path.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_01: And we're in this particular moment where we are in this gold rush because of AI.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_01: And I'm sure founders are facing similar situations to what you're describing in the sense
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_01: of having to risk capital, but being a customer as partners that you might not necessarily
[00:04:13] don't want to bring, but you have to to win the war.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[00:04:17] So, hey, I know you see, I mean, having that introspection when you are in the grind,
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_01: right, growing, scaling can be a luxury or can be very hard to do.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_01: So I'm curious, how do you talk to founders about this experience and how can they audit
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_01: in a sense their life?
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_01: So they don't end up living in a version that they're not going to really enjoy.
[00:04:39] That's true in general.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: Your life is extraordinarily busy.
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter where there's your personal life, your business life, and it doesn't
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: even matter if you're in a startup or not.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: You have infinite things to do.
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_00: And it's very easy to just keep going down the path.
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_00: You have a job, you go to the job, you have a relationship, you say in the relationship,
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: you have an apartment you live in, you go to that apartment, obviously everything's easy.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: That's an easy default path.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: Plus there's default societal path, you know.
[00:05:04] I go to high school, I go to college, I get a job, I get married, I get 2.2 kids and
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_00: 1.3 dogs, whatever.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_00: I move to the suburbs, I get a white ticket fence and I want to shoot myself.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_00: You need a forcing function.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: So my recommendation is once a year, send yourself an email.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: You take a weekend, you take a night where you're basically assessing where you are and
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: your personal and professional life.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: How happy are you on a day-to-day basis?
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_00: How about the theory of it, the reality of it?
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: Not the best day, the average day.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: What is it you're doing?
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_00: What is it you like about what you're doing?
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: What is it you don't like about what you're doing?
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: And in completely free form fashion, brainstorm with yourself and the reason I like the email
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_00: is it forces you to structure your thoughts because they may be on your mind, but it's not
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_00: very well articulated.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: The email forces you to, okay, these are things I really like.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_00: These are the things I really dislike.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_00: These are the things maybe you could be improved and this is maybe what I can do about it.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_00: And then I also like to have a free form brainstorming myself.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_00: What else could I be doing?
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_00: What are all the other paths I could be going down that could be just as compelling or
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_00: more compelling?
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_00: And what would not the ideal day be like, but what would the average day be like?
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: And then I share the friends and family and ask them if it was you, what would you do?
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_00: Knowing me, what would you do?
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_00: We have conversations and often I just try these things.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: But usually if you have the sense of something is not right, it's usually a sense that's
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_00: ready too late.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: You should already have moved on, right?
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_00: Like if you're not happy in the day to day, hard effects.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's true with employees.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: If you feel someone's probably not great and you need to have a pause review or whatever,
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: it probably needs you to already fired them.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: If you have a relationship and it's like, you know, in your board or whatever, you probably
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: should have already moved on.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_00: And this is true of the company you're at if things are really not feeling right.
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: Because often if you're grinding hard, it can actually be fun, right?
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: And so that's not the wrong feeling.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: The wrong feeling is you're not getting product-market fit.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: You don't like your co-founder, you're working hard, but it feels like it's a grind versus
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_00: fun.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_00: You can work hard and have it be fun versus work hard and have it be like I'm eating
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: glass because I must or whatever.
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_00: And so taking a step back, and I often like to do it off-grid by the way.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: I'll go in the middle of the jungle with no connection, no wet sap, no meetings, etc.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_00: So I could actually be reflective of my thoughts.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_00: I just have to take my notebooks so I can write.
[00:07:30] I love that.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_01: And it's such an interesting way of looking at it about thinking of the average day and
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_01: not the best day or the word.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_01: It's super clarified.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_01: Speaking of this type of audits, I hear you outsource everything you can from scaling
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_01: to the photo albums.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_01: You have multiple EAs, not executive assistants, which is a thing, it's not that common.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: And we're now moving into this world where basically because of AI, you could literally
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_01: delegate everything or maybe not today, but we're getting closer to where we could
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_01: delegate everything, right?
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_01: Not just logistics or coordination, but judgment, creativity.
[00:08:07] Some curious, how are you thinking about what should you gladly hand over to AI?
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: And what are things that you should probably never delegate because they give you your
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: edge or they make you yourself, in a sense?
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: Don't delegate the things you'd like doing.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_00: I don't like cooking, so I have a chef.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_00: And I think like, go buying the groceries, all that takes it, but some people love cooking,
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: which is they should not delegate it.
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: I bore administrative tests, so I have the two virtual assistants in the Philippines that
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: organize everything from calls to paying bills to finding a local tennis partner I can
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: play with.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: That's on my level and booking it.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_00: When I create a photo album or a video, I see myself as a creative director.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: I have a vision of what I want to create and then I have other people execute now.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_00: Right now those are humans because it's actually way easier to work with humans or qualify
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: than with AI at some point.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: And that's that I'm a power user of chat, absolutely power user, but for many tasks, not in
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_00: your least confident.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_00: Now invite personal case, I like being the creative director and I see myself as having good
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_00: judgment.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: And so while I will have GPT give me opinions, perspectives, etc.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_00: At the end of the day, the judgment, the decision I keep to myself and I think that's what
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: I could be advantage as a BC where I'm picking which startups and entrepreneurs I'm backing
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_00: and frankly in life as to what is it I want to be doing.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: So outsource the things you don't like to do, keep doing the things you like to do regardless
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_00: of whether AI could be better added than you.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_00: I love the frame enough of a creative director.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_01: Now I like to go deeper into investing.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_01: I love this image of, and I'm sure you've seen it, of Craig list that spawn in hundreds
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_01: of vertical businesses like Airbnb, indeed a stop-hop.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_01: And I think there's many more.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_01: There's like tens or probably hundreds.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: And each one took a category and did it better.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_01: And you just mentioned in being a power user of chat GPT.
[00:10:08] Do you think a reasonable that chat GPT is in a sense the new Craig list for AI?
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_01: So I think that's the wrong analogy because Craigslist was obviously not motivated to win
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_00: any of the verticals.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: And so a thousand people went on and like built better vertical versions and say
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_00: thing happy to eBay by the way where people took better each category of eBay and
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_00: attacked it vertically.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: When you have a large player that is trying that is good and competing, they tried not to
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_00: be verticalized.
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_00: So Google won every vertical search, maybe accept kayak for travel.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: And Amazon won most e-commerce categories.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: Maybe not chewy, and there's still others that emerge.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: The horizontal and common player can actually win many of the verticals if they focus on them.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: And OpenAI is very aggressive, very smart, and they are very ambitious.
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_00: I am sure that they don't want mid-Journey to win in images and they don't want run-away to
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_00: win in video and they don't want cursor and loveable to win in coding, etc.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_00: So I don't think so it's not at all like a Craigslist situation.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: I think it's way more of a Google situation where they're going to try to win as many
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_00: of the verticals they can.
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_00: Now they have to choose what to focus on.
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_00: There's things AI is very good at.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_00: And so I think they're going to focus on the low-hanging for each of the coding.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_00: It makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: The 11-lapse type thing where you have people's voices, images, etc.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_00: It makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_00: The image generation, video generation makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: But do I think they're going to replace a type of funnel?
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_00: No, absolutely not.
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_00: But as I see it, should GBT2 me as an existential threat to Google?
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: Because I never go to Google anymore.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_00: It's going to GBT's.
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_00: I want this.
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_00: Again, one reply.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_00: This is where I went and done.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: Will there be verticals though?
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_00: Because there are many verticals that they want to focus on.
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_00: And that are not going to be economically viable.
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_00: Or maybe you need vertical specific data.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_00: And if you have that vertical data set,
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_00: you're going to get so much better answers than a general LLM.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: So there will be winning verticals for sure.
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_00: And which ones emerge versus which ones GBT ones?
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_00: It's not clear.
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_00: It's all the battle to be played for.
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_00: And so the early winners may not be winners forever.
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: And so the people that are putting these insane evaluations
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_00: on lovable and cursor, etc.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: And I take this with a grain of salt.
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_00: These are the types of categories where I could see
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_00: a chat GBT wanting to go after it.
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_00: Not a mention, by the way,
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: GitHub with Copilot and many others.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_00: But do you think it's still an interesting lens or framework
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_01: to look at opportunities through
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: in the sense of seeing what behaviors people are using
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_01: chat GBT for?
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_01: So thinking through what verticals of chat GBT could exist or should exist,
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: especially if you have differentiated data,
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_00: you can have a category where there's a viable business model.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_00: And it's probably not one they're going to be focusing on.
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_00: Yes, it's an interesting approach.
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_00: It's not what I think is the most interesting thing to do
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_00: with AI these days, by the way,
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_00: because I think that that's highly,
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_00: a million people are doing this.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_00: So each category you look at,
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_00: there's someone verticalizing chat GBT.
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_00: There's 20 of them.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: They've already a lot of money.
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_00: They all have great teams.
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_00: They all have zero business model,
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: zero proprietary data mode.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: And most of them are going to die.
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_00: And most of the investors in them are going to lose money.
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_00: I think the smarter way to invest in AI
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_00: is actually to use the AI
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_00: to make the normal businesses 10x more efficient and better.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_00: And so I think of marketplaces.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: I mean, investors and a company go to Vinted.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: Vinted is kind of a posh mark of Europe.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: There are a much better consumer to consumer,
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_00: clothing platform and fashion marketplace.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_00: And they are crushing it.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_00: And they've done amazing things with AI.
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_00: So for instance, if you're in France,
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_00: and you're looking at a listing,
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_00: it may very well be that the listing is from Germany or Poland.
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_00: They've auto-translated the listings.
[00:14:15] You're talking to the seller.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_00: But perhaps the seller is in Poland
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_00: and it's auto-translated conversations.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_00: And they've integrated payments.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_00: They've integrated shipping.
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_00: When you want to sell an item,
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: it used to be that you had to take photos and write a title
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: and write a description and select a category
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: and select a price.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_00: Now their AI is so good.
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_00: You take photo and it does everything for you.
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: Title, description, price, category, you just press sell.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: They have automated customer care.
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_00: And so the cost structure is low.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_00: So using AI to make the existing online
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_00: and offline businesses way more efficient,
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: I think is a much more safer play at least
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_00: in terms of what you invest in
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_00: and what you could do versus investing in the Al Alams,
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_00: where there's like 50 of them
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_00: and plus GPT ever expanding what they're trying to do.
[00:15:03] You mentioned that some of the early winners
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_01: might not be the actual winners.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_01: And obviously you've been through multiple of these
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_01: technology shifts, web, mobile.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_01: Is there a pattern to which particles
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_01: tend to break out first?
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_01: And I'm curious if you're seeing it play out
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_01: similarly in AI or very differently?
[00:15:22] Yeah, so first two comments.
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_00: The early winners are rarely the late winners,
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_00: like think of Alta Vista or Lyco
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_00: or whatever the early search engines
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_00: that were in word as well as Google
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: or frankly, Frenchter.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: And before I, and high five intact,
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_00: then my space, then Facebook,
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_00: right, you want to be the last player
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_00: to basically create the mode of win.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_00: And so first, we were at advantage,
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_00: can be overrated.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_00: And that's been true in like almost every one
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_00: of the categories of verticals.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_00: Now, the...
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: I love the phrase for one of the founder of Rump
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: that competition is outsourced, R&D.
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_00: When I look at what verticals break out,
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_00: it depends on the tech.
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: For Google, you know, it kind of made sense
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_00: to travel would be very different.
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_00: Or like for, if you think of eBay,
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_00: Stubbahub really was a different business
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: because you had to integrate with like the ticket
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_00: provider is due ticket authentication, etc.
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_00: And so it really didn't fit in as the same code base.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: You can not just have a subcategory.
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_00: Now, when I think of what verticals make sense
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_00: in the chat GPT world, you know, I already mentioned this.
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_00: Like images, videos, coding, software development.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: And in the imaging and video and sound,
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_00: I'd say that the likeness things,
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_00: like you love and lapse what they were doing,
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_00: in terms of having your likeness,
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: my likeness, voice, and avatars, etc.
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_00: So I think these things are the most logical,
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: but that's ruined by the tech.
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: Right? So the...
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_00: In the case of Craigslist, you know,
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: like very different verticals for real estate,
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: than cars and jobs, because the dynamics are different.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_00: So I don't think it can be completely generalized,
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: it's really driven by how good the tech is and what it's good at,
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_00: and what data you need,
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_00: and what are the user experiences that you need to solve for.
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_00: Do you think it still makes sense today to ask
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_01: about differentiation or modes to startups,
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: or what should investors really look for?
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_01: So first of all, I think there's never a mode at the beginning.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_00: When you launch your startup, you have nothing.
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_00: You have your team, basically.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: And it thinks like whatever patterns I don't
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_00: go with the paper they're written on.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_00: So I don't consider these to be modes.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: In fact, if you tell me you have a pattern,
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_00: I'd probably put that as a negative.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_00: It means you spend money and time in something this useless.
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_00: So probably more likely than not,
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_00: if you have a pattern, I'm not going to invest in you.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_00: No, your mode is your execution.
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_00: The more traffic you have, the more users you have,
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_00: the more data you have, the more brand,
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_00: the more revenue you have, the more...
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_00: That's your mode.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_00: And so especially in marketplace,
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_00: that don't work in fact businesses, right?
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_00: Like every more seller is bringing the word,
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_00: buyers, the buyers, the sellers, the sellers.
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_00: And then you create this beautiful flywheel
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_00: where it ends up being winner takes vote.
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_00: So at the day zero, there is no mode.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_00: The mode comes day year one,
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_00: year two, year three, as you're executing.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_00: I guess it's common that founders have...
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_01: You think the most successful founders have a hypothesis
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_01: or where will it come early on
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_01: or it really crystallizes a stamp pass by?
[00:18:27] It depends.
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_00: Some people have a plan and they stick to the plan
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: and they follow it through
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_00: and then they adjust accordingly.
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_00: I've probably Jeff Bezos at Amazon.
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_00: He was like, I'm going to start with books
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_00: because there's a long tail.
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to be in Seattle
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_00: because I want to be right next to Ingram,
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_00: the largest book publisher
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_00: where it can have access to all their inventory.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_00: And from there, I'm going to go to the other
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_00: high value categories.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_00: And the case with Google,
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_00: they had no idea what the business model was.
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_00: So I think I met there in Surge in whatever late 90s
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_00: and go to a just launch.
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, oh,
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_00: they had no business model.
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_00: And they were like, oh, you must be very happy
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: because now you have a business model.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_00: You can do these paid ads
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_00: and on a cost for click basis.
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_00: And they're like, no.
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: Or again, research is so good.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_00: No one would ever pay.
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_00: I click on any of the paid ads.
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_00: Instead of a business model,
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_00: they had a 200 page presentation
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: explaining to me they're going to sell search to businesses.
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_00: Needless to say, that never worked.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_00: Eventually, go to get acquired by overture
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: and Yahoo.
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_00: And they replicated it and actually improved it.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_00: And so they switched it up.
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_00: But did they know ahead of time
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_00: where their business model was going to be?
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely not.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: They saw what others did,
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_00: the outsource R&D.
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_00: And they copied it,
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_00: improved it.
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_00: And because they had won the rest,
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_00: the category crushed it.
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_00: I want to connect two thoughts.
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_01: One is the network effects on marketplaces.
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_01: And the other is this idea of chat GPT,
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_01: almost sucking up.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_01: Big chunk of our lives
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_01: were many people coming.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_01: Our users, I think that's 10%
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_01: of the global population is a weekly active user.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of people would think
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_01: that we're going towards this world where
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_01: there'll be an agent,
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_01: like an assistant,
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_01: that runs a lot of our personal life.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_01: And hence, that agent might interact
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_01: with many e-commerce sites or marketplaces.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_01: Sure.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_01: How do you think that affects
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_01: marketplaces' modes?
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_01: Much less than people think.
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_01: The same way that a few years ago,
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_00: everyone was like, oh, I'm worried
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: that whatever social,
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_00: commerce and Facebook is going to take the top funnel.
[00:20:29] This is not the way people,
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_00: people browse and shop, etc.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_00: So they're three buying patterns on the internet.
[00:20:37] One, you don't know what you're looking for.
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_00: And so shopping as entertainment.
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_00: People go to vintage,
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_00: they don't know they want to buy something.
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_00: They basically, they're browsing.
[00:20:46] And so...
[00:20:46] With those shopping basically.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_00: They're shopping.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_00: They're window shopping.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_00: And there is zero role for an LLLum to play there.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_00: Now, do I think if they put infinite resources to it,
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_00: could they kind of figure out how to create a feed similar to vintage?
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_00: Maybe.
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_00: But because most of the content comes
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_00: when winter takes all marketplaces,
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_00: most of the content we're becoming from vintage anyway.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_00: So there, I think, zero purpose.
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_00: You're not going to be disintermediated.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: People are going to keep shopping
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_00: and they'll buy when they want.
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_00: Number two, you know exactly what you're looking for.
[00:21:16] If you know exactly what you're looking for,
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: you typically go directly to Amazon.
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_00: You don't even go to Google anymore.
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_00: You go to Amazon or eBay.
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_00: You type in the, you put in the model, whatever.
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_00: LG, OLED, C3, 65 inch, good buy.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: You know, so could you go and tell GPD do it for you?
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_00: Yes, but like them,
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_00: that's not all that different
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_00: because the backend is still massively concentrated.
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_00: Where I'd like, eBay and Amazon
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_00: have 43% of USC commerce
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_00: and some verticals that's like 90%.
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_00: They would capture very little value.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_00: Definitely not more than whatever the paid ads are
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_00: on Google for that in Google shopping.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_00: So these two, and these two are the two largest categories
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_00: by far.
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_00: I don't see them the value being taken away
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_00: from the e-commerce sites.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_00: So the marketplace is especially since
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_00: I don't see GPD wanting to do fulfillment,
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_00: inventory management,
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_00: having inventory, etc.
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_00: Like that is not the result of that.
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_00: So if you go and look at their,
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_00: you know, tech roadmap for the next three years,
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_00: it's not even the thousands priority.
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, let's have shipping centuries
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_00: and fulfillment solutions and last mile logistics, etc.
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: Like, and so as a result,
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_00: the winner takes most marketplaces
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_00: that are going to be doing the fulfillment
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_00: will not be discontinued.
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_00: They will keep most of the value.
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_00: The third category that's more open for discussion
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_00: is considered purchases.
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_00: You don't really know what you're looking for.
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_00: You know, like I want to buy a new car,
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_00: but I don't know which.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_00: I want to buy, I want to get a new pair of skis,
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_00: but I don't know which.
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_00: Or I want to get an apartment,
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_00: but I'm not sure which building
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_00: when I can afford which neighborhood, etc.
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_00: There a conversation within LLM
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_00: makes a lot of sense now.
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_00: And that's why there are sites that are currently using humans
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_00: to do these things.
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_00: So curated.com, which is used humans for like sports equipment.
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_00: Now for travel, for travel,
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_00: and they are not selling, you know,
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_00: like curated, I think sold for 300 million,
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_00: they'd reach 200 million.
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_00: So it's not a very good exit.
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_00: And I think the fear is it's going to be
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_00: disintermediated by the LLM.
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_00: But even there, it's not obvious
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_00: that the LLM's win, right?
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_00: Like if you want a car,
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_00: an LLM run by Carvana,
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_00: might be better than Chad GPT.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_00: Now, GPB may be better because they knew you better.
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_00: So it's unclear.
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying there's a different answer.
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_00: But like, you know, like Amazon has Rufus.
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_00: You can ask questions on which product to buy from Rufus.
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_00: Maybe you're doing a Rufus, maybe you're doing GPT.
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_00: Same thing Instacart now has like,
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_00: oh, you know, this weekend I'm doing a barbecue.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_00: What should I cook?
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_00: Whatever, and like they have recommendations.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_00: So I think the trend that will be your search box
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_00: at the top of your e-commerce site or marketplace
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_00: is going to have to be twofold.
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: One is specific search.
[00:23:57] SPEAKER_00: If you, I could type, you know, LGO, LADC3,
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: or I can type, I'm looking for a TV.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_00: This is my budget room and a lot.
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_00: What should I buy?
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_00: And I think both your, it should not be two separate search
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_00: rack parts.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_00: So I think that will change.
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_00: That last part may go to GPT.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_00: And that will have to be able to route well.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: It's happened to me when you're looking for like the specific thing
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_01: and you get the other answer.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_01: It starts like a semantic search.
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_01: I was like, no, I just want this thing.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_00: We're still at the beginning of that.
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_00: So that part, maybe the LLM's capture.
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_00: And even then, how much of the value do they capture
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_00: if the fulfillment ends up being done by essentially
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_00: monopolistic or all the gopeless marketplaces?
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_00: I don't think as much as people think.
[00:24:40] This might be a stretch, but do you expect the tech-enabled
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_01: business models that were hugely funded during 2021
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_01: to maybe have a comeback in this world?
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_01: Because they might be a bit more defensible,
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_01: you can say, aye.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_00: There's a big trend right now of people buying offline
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_00: businesses and then using AI and adding an AI layer
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_00: and a tech layer to make them way more profitable,
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: efficient, et cetera.
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_00: And a lot of private equity rollups
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_00: are based on that.
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_00: And even venture companies, like a slow ventures,
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_00: their thesis is actually doing these types of things.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_00: So that for sure is a trend, right?
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_00: Like you're buying these mom and pop companies
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_00: that were everything's been done pen and paper.
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_00: And in the past, you were that assessor
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_00: and now you have an AI layer.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_00: And you're making them a lot more profitable and efficient.
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for sure, this is a mega trend
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_00: and where a day's zero of that.
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_00: Do you buy the faces that AI companies will be able to capture
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_01: in their labor budgets?
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure that people with labor costs
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_00: are good or good, Dan, because of AI historically,
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_00: if you and I'm an economist by formation,
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_00: productivity improvements have met higher wages.
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_00: And so the percentage of wages of percentage GDP
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_00: is basically remain reasonably flat
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_00: and actually increased as productive increase.
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_00: So I suspect that the answer is no.
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_00: I think what, I know, we'll,
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_00: a many jobs we destroyed, yes,
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_00: many more jobs will be created as well.
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_00: They'll be different.
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_00: So there'll be different winners and losers,
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_00: but on average, technology has always been
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_00: about cheaper, better, faster, it's deflationary.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_00: It will make your life better.
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_00: It will improve your quality of life.
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_00: And the same way that 200 years ago,
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: if I go to 1825, our life expectancy was 29.
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_00: 29, we worked 80 hours a week, six days a week
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_00: in order to barely make sense to be 96%
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_00: of the world's population was on less than a dollar a day.
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_00: And we have an extraordinary quality of life today
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_00: where we actually work less than 40 hours a week.
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_00: We have running water, we have electricity,
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_00: we have these magical devices where we have
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_00: global free video communications
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_00: and the sum total of humanities knowledge in your pocket.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_00: You can fly plain from one side of the other
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_00: and it's accessible to most.
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_00: I mean, this is all because of tech.
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_00: So technology is deflationary, it makes the world better
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_00: and everything is better, cheaper, faster.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_00: So this is more of that.
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_00: And it will express itself in many ways
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_00: from self-driving cars to, you know,
[00:26:56] SPEAKER_00: marginal cost of delivery going to zero,
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_00: to solar going is it becoming so cheap
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_00: that like electricity will be too cheap to meet air.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_00: Where at the eve, and by eve, I mean,
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_00: 23 years to be clear of a world of abundance.
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_00: And I'm very happy and privileged to be in position
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_00: to help bring about this world of abundance.
[00:27:14] I was asking this because many of the air startups
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_01: raising capital today and when you see their pitch decks
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_01: are based on the idea that, hey, if companies in the US
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_01: spend, I don't know what's the number,
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_01: 200 or 300 billion dollars in SaaS revenue year,
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_01: but they spend a couple trillion in salaries.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, then the opportunity is 10x spear, right?
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_01: So is the, I think that's the right way
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_01: of looking at the opportunity?
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_01: The, I don't think that's the right way
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_00: to be looking at the opportunity because what I'm looking
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_00: to behavior, I'm seeing, I'm not seeing people, except maybe
[00:27:51] in customer care positions,
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm definitely seeing opportunities
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_00: for replacing customer care.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_00: But right now, most of the companies in the portfolio
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_00: are hiring more people to add, to use AI more effectively
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_00: and use AI to be more productive.
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_00: They're not removing programming.
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_00: I don't know any of our portfolio companies say,
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_00: okay, we need 30% loss programmers.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_00: You know, they're all like, no, we need way more programmers
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_00: so we can launch for AI, build even more code,
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_00: go even faster.
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_00: And if anything, those salaries are higher and higher
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_00: and higher.
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_00: So I don't see it honestly.
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_00: And because AI is not free, you're only going to use it
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_00: for the most valuable applications and resources.
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_00: And so, yeah, it's recording comparative advantage, right?
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_00: Like, even if you type faster than your secretary,
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_00: you're still going to have an assistant
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_00: because your time is too valuable.
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_00: So you're going to do what you do and they're going
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_00: to do what they do.
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_00: And so, same thing, I think that the roles AI will play
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_00: and the roles humans will play will be different.
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, the roles will change, right?
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_00: Like, right now, if I have a doctor, for him,
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm a cog in the machine, he sees me for three minutes,
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_00: he's a diagnostic machine and he has zero bedside matters.
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_00: And he's not necessarily up to date on the latest pub bed
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_00: and research, et cetera.
[00:29:01] That role, I think, should be done by AI.
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_00: Like, maybe it's not good enough today.
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_00: But at some point, the AI will be like,
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_00: okay, I've looked at every single micron of your MRI,
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_00: I have the latest research.
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_00: This is what I would do if I were you.
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_00: And then the doctor will be the opposite.
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_00: We'll be the human empathetic bedside matter.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_00: We'll actually take the time to explain what's going on.
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_00: What are the options?
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_00: And we'll maybe follow up to make sure
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_00: that you're actually taking the drugs you're taking
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_00: because there's massive non-compliance.
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_00: Same thing with the role of teacher, right?
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_00: Like the way we teach our kids today
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_00: is the same way we were teaching our kids
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_00: 2,500 years under Socrates.
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_00: You have a teacher of variable quality,
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_00: spewing facts at kids of variable quality.
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_00: That makes no sense.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_00: The AI should be teaching the class on a personalized level
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_00: for each individual and then the teacher should be
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_00: the consultant like, oh, little François,
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_00: you're struggling with us.
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_00: This is the way I would approach it.
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_00: And so the roles will change dramatically,
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_00: but I don't think it'll be fundamental replacement
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_00: and the trillions of dollars of salaries will go away.
[00:30:00] But if you had to put numbers into how bigger
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_01: the opportunities is it double the software opportunity
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_01: or the software market is triple, is it 10x bigger?
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_01: How do you go about making that estimation?
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_01: I think of it very differently.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_00: I think of it more.
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_00: What percentage of GDP today is digitized
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_00: and optimized and efficient?
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_00: And it's actually very small, right?
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: So in the consumer world in your life,
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_00: maybe 25% of consumer interactions are digitized.
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_00: So when you include food delivery,
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_00: the Uber, it's Amazon, Instacart,
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_00: kind of everything you want is digitized
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_00: and the penetration is like 25%.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_00: Now, if I go to the B2B world,
[00:30:44] nothing, we're like sub 1% penetration.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_00: If you want to buy Patrick Emberkohl,
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_00: there's not a catalog, a catalog, a list of what's available.
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_00: You're going to go.
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_01: You have to call someone or get an Excel email,
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_00: it's sheet sent to you or you have to call 10 people.
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, it's not just a catalog.
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_00: You need connectivity to the factory
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_00: to understand manufacturing capacity and delays.
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_00: You need online ordering, you need online payments,
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_00: you need online tracking, you need financing.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_00: And this needs to happen in every industry
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_00: and every vertical and every geography.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_00: Then think of the way SMBs are run.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_00: This will pen and paper may be Excel.
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_00: And this needs to all be digitized.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_00: And that's not even talking about the government.
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_00: I mean, let's go to the DMV to go in,
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_00: renew your driver's license.
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_00: What size are we talking about
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_00: in terms of opportunity for digitization of the economy?
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_00: We're talking most of it.
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_00: Trillions and trillions and trillions.
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_00: But I don't think of it like the way you measure it.
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_00: It's much more, what is not digitized
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_00: that should be digitized in AI?
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_00: We'll do a great job at it.
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_00: Well, it's most of it.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: But by the way, how quickly will that happen?
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_00: Very slowly.
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_00: This is why we're in a AI bubble.
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_00: Every tech revolution, people think,
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_00: it's going to happen immediately.
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_00: And ultimately, it takes a lot longer
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_00: than people think.
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_00: But the impact is a lot greater than people think.
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_00: And so late 90s, you had web then, yet pets.com.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_00: You had a company called Cosworth
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_00: that was doing delivery.
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_00: It wanted like instant delivery.
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_00: But that's with no GPS on those smartphone.
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_00: All these guys went under.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_00: But today we have Instacart.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_00: We have DoorDash.
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_00: We have Chui.
[00:32:19] And so think of self-driving car.
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_00: When self-driving cars, you know,
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_00: first came on the road like, I don't know, 2012, 2013.
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_00: People were like, oh my God,
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_00: all the truck drivers are going to be out of business.
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, or are going to be at,
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_00: that's 4.3 million jobs.
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_00: The biggest job category that you ask is going to be a disaster.
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_00: And we're like 13 years later.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_00: And we're still the more truck drivers.
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_00: We're still the very, very, very, very beginning.
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_00: And self-driving car is going to happen.
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_00: But it can happen very gradually
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_00: because the costs are actually high,
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_00: the same way the costs today are high.
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_00: So will AI change the world?
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_00: As we know it, absolutely much more than we think so.
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_00: It will take a lot longer because people
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_00: are at cultural resistance and their costs associated
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_00: with doing it, actual financial cost of like running
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_00: the LLMs and doing API calls,
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_00: but also costs of like changing your processes
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_00: and changing the way the companies are running,
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_00: et cetera, it's going to take forever.
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_00: Like, as I said, before the DMV is automated,
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_00: they're using AI to issue your driver's license.
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_00: We'll probably have AGI.
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_00: We'll put me on ASI by that.
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_01: So does this mean as an investor,
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_01: you maybe spend more time thinking about the timing
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_01: and the actual size of the market?
[00:33:40] I want market to be big enough,
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: but like 50 billion is big enough, you know?
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_00: And they hear we're talking trillions.
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_00: I do think it's not a lot of time thinking about timing,
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_00: but because of this, this is why I'm not fighting
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_00: in the LLM world.
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm fighting in the applications of LLM.
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_00: So I think it's way more fun, lucrative also.
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_00: Like, what is the median, the mean seed or A
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_00: or B valuation in these AI companies?
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_00: The seed must be 30 or 40 or 50,
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_00: and the A's are like hundreds.
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_00: And I'm investing seeds with companies
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: are 150K a month in revenue at 12 pre.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_00: I'm investing in A's at 23 pre raising seven,
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_00: and they're doing a million and a half a month in revenues.
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm investing companies doing two, three, four,
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_00: five million a month at 50 pre raising 15
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_00: because no one is loving these categories.
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: I'd like to be contrarian.
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_00: I want to invest in a plide AI,
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_00: not the actual, the game of Kings.
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_00: First of all, I think GPT opening AI 1.
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_00: So, I mean, everyone else is dead,
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_00: they just don't know it yet.
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_00: So, the King Makers already made their big king.
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the king already is there.
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_00: The rest are like, fighting to be the king,
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_00: but they're all gonna die, you know,
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_00: me stall and whatever, you know,
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_00: like I think all of them are gonna die.
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_00: So, it's just gonna take years to play out
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_00: and tens of billions of dollars, but as a result,
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to play that game.
[00:35:01] Do you think this, I guess, a plide AI fundamentally
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_01: requires a different type of founder or not?
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_01: Like in this discussion between the more business background
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_01: compared to technical background founder?
[00:35:14] It usually takes a founder that understands the,
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_00: what they're applying it to, right?
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_00: Like so, if you're in the petrochemical space,
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_00: and you convince Dow Chemical to work with you,
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_00: probably helps that you've been in the category.
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_00: So, yes, our vertical B2B marketplace founders
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_00: have a tendency to be older,
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_00: have an tendency to have had a lot of experience
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_00: in the industry and the category,
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_00: and to be in a position to bring, to apply the AI,
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_00: but they still need very good technical accounts
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_00: to be able to do it, but you need the credibility
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_00: in the industry and also in what way you can use it
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_00: or apply it to be effective, right?
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_00: You often need a behavior change.
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_00: The good news is the behavior change
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: is kind of happening on its own,
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_00: because the owners of these SMBs
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_00: were now in their 60s, 70s, and their kids
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_00: don't want to take over.
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_00: So there's a generational shift
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_00: where they're selling them to other parties
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_00: for private equity, which is leading
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_00: to change in the application technology.
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_00: And the kind of the same thing is happening
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_00: in the large enterprise, the decision makers
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_00: that are starting to retire,
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_00: they were all into RFPs,
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_00: and now the millennials that are coming and taking over,
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_00: they're more into marketplaces.
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_00: So it is creating a generational shift
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_00: that makes it easier to apply AI.
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_01: That's super interesting.
[00:36:30] I'd love to now take a global lens to our conversation,
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_01: because I think what makes you unique as an investor
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: is, or is it besides your experience.
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_01: As a founder, is that you invest a lot outside the US as well
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_01: in Europe, Latin America, Asia.
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_01: And the funny thing is, I heard you describe in OLAX
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_01: as the idea of, hey, Craigslist dominated the US.
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_01: Now let's build Craigslist for the rest of the world.
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_01: Well, a better improved version.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_01: At that point, like, what if Craigslist
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_00: was actually run with a modern UX UI,
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_00: Ketering the Women, who are the primary
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: decision makers of all household purchases,
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_00: mobile firsts, and with no spam, scam,
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_00: fishing, prostitution.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_00: So yes, so.
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_00: But funny thing is, ten years later,
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_01: I'm still using Craigslist to rent an apartment
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_01: in San Francisco, right?
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_01: So that was the proof that at least they found something valuable.
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_01: The liquidity trumps everything else in marketplaces.
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_00: It's better, more important than user interface.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_00: It's more important than modizations, more more than anything else.
[00:37:37] So I'm curious if that Craigslist for everywhere else
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_01: is a good lens for founders and investors,
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_01: globally to look at, I guess, AI opportunities,
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_01: or is AI to the universe.
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_01: If you're talking about applying AI to verticals,
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_00: then of course, the verticals are very different.
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_00: Each country is the application of these
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_00: versus the very different.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_00: The regulatory lines case are different.
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_00: But if you're talking, you're like, at the all-alum level,
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_00: there's not going to be a mid-journey for Latin America.
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_00: It's going to be mid-journey.
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_00: Translating is so easy, right?
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_00: The same way Facebook is a global company,
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_00: that the reason in the case of Craigslist
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_00: is different winners per country.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_00: You need to create liquidity in a country, right?
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_00: Like you're not shipping an item from San Francisco to São Paulo.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_00: And because the transactions were local,
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_00: like the person renting in a part of Indian São Paulo
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_00: is someone who typically is moving to São Paulo,
[00:38:28] SPEAKER_00: is already in São Paulo, from somewhere else in Brazil.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_00: It's not someone from San Francisco.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: And so there is no Latin global in that work in facts.
[00:38:36] SPEAKER_00: But there are some businesses like Airbnb,
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_00: where actually people are traveling internationally,
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_00: they work global in that work in fact.
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_00: So it depends on the business,
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_00: but when it comes to things that are purely software,
[00:38:46] like ChatGPT, like mid-journey,
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_00: there is zero reason have localized regional versions of us.
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_00: The ChatGPT for India is going to be ChatGPT.
[00:38:57] I've been said that you were telling us about the VIN set
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_01: in Europe, where it seems like AI has helped them
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_01: to, in a sense, break the boundaries.
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_01: The board is out.
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_01: The local frictions, right?
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_01: With auto translation.
[00:39:12] It was one of the two legs.
[00:39:14] SPEAKER_00: So yes, they have auto translation of the conversation
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_00: of the listings, but then they also have it built internally
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_00: as shipping and payments company,
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: so they can actually ship for cheap
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_00: between Poland and France.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_00: And so if you don't have that, that's not enough.
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_00: And they can't do it, for instance.
[00:39:31] You could translate, but it's not going to work
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_00: you as to France, because the shipping is too expensive.
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_00: It makes it easy to have a pan-European company
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_00: for the first time.
[00:39:38] SPEAKER_00: And so now we're investors in a company like Ovoco
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_00: and Carparts at its pan-European or Vinted for Fashion,
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: but it doesn't make it easy to have a global company,
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_00: because shipping costs and tariffs and barriers
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_00: continue to exist.
[00:39:49] That's super interesting.
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_01: So it might make easy to have bigger regional players,
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_01: like Marcaro Lívaro, to say it, in a sense,
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_01: but don't necessarily make things easier for you.
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_01: There's ChatGPT's to go around the world.
[00:40:02] Well, ChatGPT will be around the world,
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_00: but it's going to make it easy for whatever USC commerce
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_00: player did then go and win in Brazil.
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_00: That's not so much.
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, even in Latin America,
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_00: I don't know what extent they were free trade agreements
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_00: and borderless, et cetera, but I think not that many.
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_00: So I think it helps really in Europe, where you have the European
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_00: union, it makes it easy.
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_00: But outside of Europe, I'm not sure it's that helpful.
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_00: That's super, super interesting.
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_01: AI, in a sense, promises the democratization
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_01: or explosion of software creation.
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_01: So because many of the, again, it's connected
[00:40:37] SPEAKER_01: to this conversation.
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_01: Many of the actual winners have been the big tech companies,
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_01: right?
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_01: Facebook going over on the world, Google as well.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_01: Maybe outside of China, where always in China
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_01: did have their own big, very big players.
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_01: So I'm curious if you think AI will help.
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think because they blocked that, right?
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure they would have had.
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_00: If they had not prevented Google all, et cetera,
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_00: from winning, I'm not sure they would have had their
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_00: incompetent winners.
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_00: That's a great, great caveat.
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_01: So I'm curious, do you think AI will level the playing field
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_01: for these emerging ecosystems outside the US,
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_01: or does it actually reinforce the US dominance?
[00:41:14] So it depends on what you're talking about.
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_00: If you're talking about, does it empower new local founders?
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_00: So the biggest trend, the biggest trend in the last 30 years
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_00: is becoming cheaper and easier to build tech companies
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_00: that I've ever before.
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_00: So now you could be a, I could be in Jakarta and not
[00:41:31] SPEAKER_00: know how to code and I can actually build an app and a tech
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_00: startup.
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_00: So there's going to be an extraordinarily democratization
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_00: of idea creation, startup creation, et cetera, absolutely.
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_00: And so ideas are going to come from many more geographies
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_00: and many more people, many more types of people.
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_00: You no longer need to be a Sanford computer science grad,
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_00: in the valley with like back in Sequoia
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_00: in order to build tech startup.
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_00: So global democratization of startup creation.
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_00: But do I think there's going to be a chat GPD for,
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_00: but because most of these people are going to be using the platforms
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_00: like chat GPD to build it, it's going to reinforce them
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_00: and these are typically based in the US.
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_00: So the answer is both the hyper dominant large US tech companies
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_00: are going to be hyper dominant large US tech companies.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_00: But there will be many more founders globally
[00:42:22] SPEAKER_00: that are going to be creating amazing companies.
[00:42:26] If you were talking to a founder in Jakarta or Brazil,
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_01: we have different advice for them in terms of how to build
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_01: or how to approach an AI opportunity
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_01: compared to what the advice you would give a founder
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_01: in New York or Silicon Valley.
[00:42:42] I would tell them to do a apply AI, not fundamental AI.
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_00: It's that simple, just because you're not
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_00: going to have enough money, you're not having a talent
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_00: to go and invite the LLMOR, which is the game of kings,
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_00: if you want.
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, pick a vertical problem and apply AI
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_00: to make it way more efficient.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_00: And no one from the US is going to bother.
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_00: It is going to go do that.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_00: So if you want to roll up all of the laundromats in Brazil
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_00: or São Paulo and add an AI layer,
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_00: completely change the user experience, improve the margin,
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_00: structure, and use AI to pick the best locations.
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_00: And I was fraught.
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_00: Whatever, yes, do that.
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_00: No one in the US will ever go after you for that.
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_00: But like, build a competitive mid-journey,
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_00: I think it's a terrible idea.
[00:43:28] You said that the big 30-year trend has
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_01: been that building a tech startup is becoming increasingly
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_01: cheaper and faster, more accessible for everyone,
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: not only for, as you said, a computer science
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_01: to another of Stanford.
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_01: And at the same time that this is happening,
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_01: you also see companies raising more capital than ever,
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_01: they are faster capital than ever.
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_01: So here's how do you think venture capital
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_01: as an asset class will evolve in the next 10 years?
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_01: Well, I think the size of the price is increased.
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_00: And so people are willing to throw more money
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_00: at the category where we used to have a few million people
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_00: online and now you have the entire world online.
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_00: So it needs vertical people willing to spend more money.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_00: Now, the asset class has changed pretty dramatically.
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_00: Unrelated to that.
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_00: I think it's more driven by a few big funds.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_00: I've started accumulating most of the capital.
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_00: So the top 10 funds, I think, accumulated
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_00: like 70% of the capital.
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_00: And that's a recent and thrive and inside
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_00: and general catalyst, et cetera.
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_00: And I'm not even sure I would call them venture capitalists
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_00: anymore, right?
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_00: Like, there are capital accumulators and asset managers.
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_00: I suspect that the returns they're going to have
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_00: are not going to be venture style, like 30% IR
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_00: and 3, 4, 5 X funds.
[00:44:48] SPEAKER_00: So I think they're going to be 1.5 X to 2 X funds and 10, 15% IR.
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_00: And many of these are going to go public.
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_00: And many of these are going to have evergreen structures.
[00:44:59] We're like a black rock.
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_00: But that's OK.
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_00: That's what they're going to do.
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_00: And I think the real venture capitalists
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_00: are going to be the small vertical smaller funds.
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_00: And I mean, like, sub 500 million, partly sub to 300 million,
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_00: that we're going to have their area of focus and specialization,
[00:45:20] SPEAKER_00: that we're going to have the type of returns
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_00: that people would have come and expect from venture capital.
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_00: So the VC landscape is changing radically.
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, a lot of VCs are dying.
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_00: I think like 2,000 VCs shut down in the last like few years
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_00: or in Zobby state, because they haven't
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_00: been able to raise a new fund.
[00:45:38] So do you?
[00:45:39] SPEAKER_01: But what I guess what I was trying to look to as well
[00:45:43] SPEAKER_01: is the fact that companies need less capital than ever.
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_01: And we're seeing big players, some companies raised a lot of money.
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_01: I think we're also seeing some companies
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_01: designed to have a mid-Journey's for a great example.
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_01: Gamma just hit like 50 million dollars in the RR.
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_01: And they haven't raised a lot of capital.
[00:46:00] So those companies you could also argue,
[00:46:03] hey, the amount of capital need is less.
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_01: The answer is it depends.
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_00: If you're building, if you're a chat GPT,
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_00: and you're competing on GPUs,
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_00: you are not an in-asset like business.
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_00: You're an in-asset heavy business.
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_00: And you need tens of billions or hundreds of billions.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_00: You don't, either you build it yourself
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_00: or you buy the capacity for Microsoft and Nvidia or others.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_00: But in either case, you're asset heavy.
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_00: And if you're competing with eight other people,
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_00: and you're not really differentiated,
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_00: maybe you need to spend money on marketing.
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_00: And so how much capital you need really varies
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_00: on literally on a per category basis.
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes it can be viral.
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes it can use, sometimes you use paid acquisition.
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it really depends.
[00:46:46] OK.
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_01: OK.
[00:46:48] You mentioned the two categories of venture firms,
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_01: the huge ones that are accumulating a ton of assets.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_01: And you mentioned these smaller ones
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_01: that might be more specialized.
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_01: You guys have a very particular model, which,
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_01: I mean, when you go to your website,
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_01: you see described as angel investing adventure scale,
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_01: which is a great, great one liner.
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_01: How do you think your model fits into the AI world?
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_01: Is it better position or not compared to the other players?
[00:47:15] Well, the other players are typically
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_00: playing the game of kings that I'm playing.
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm a contrarian.
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_00: I like to invest at these much more reasonable evaluations.
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_00: So I think by virtue of being diversified,
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_00: it's a lot safer to in terms of getting, like, historically,
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_00: we've had like three X-Fonds doing about 27% IR, realize IR.
[00:47:34] SPEAKER_00: And that's been over 27 years.
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_00: And the trend seems to continue because diversification
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_00: means you hit the power law companies.
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_00: Now, in our case, we avoid the very, very short tail
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_00: super power law companies, because there's too many zeroes there.
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_00: But by doing a plight AI in this world,
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_00: I think we're going to do, I think we're just fine.
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_00: And also, we're coming in amazing companies
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_00: at very reasonable prices.
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_00: And then they go and do amazingly well, like Vinted,
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_00: which has been taking advantage of this AI world.
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_00: Fabriz, you've put thousands of hours.
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_01: I've heard, or I read, into building Fabriz AI
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_01: to replicate yourself.
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_01: I'm curious, how you think about the future of the job
[00:48:13] SPEAKER_01: of an investor itself?
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_01: If in a world where AI or a founder can interact with you
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_01: for this child or this video interface,
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_01: I guess what becomes the new job of a human investor?
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_01: The, at the end of the day, it's what I said earlier.
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_00: What do I not outsource to AI?
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_00: Well, judgment.
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_00: And what I have here is a level of judgment.
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_00: So the reason I have a, and pitch,
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_00: so right now we have Fabriz AI, that's live,
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_00: which is a repository of all my knowledge.
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_00: It's actually very good.
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_00: You can ask questions on like Marketplace,
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_00: try and say, I whatever, and have full long conversations.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_00: What's not live yet should be live,
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_00: hopefully in a month or two, is pitchfabriz.
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_00: And the reason I have pitchfabriz is right now,
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_00: we're getting 300 deals per week inbound.
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_00: We take calls are like 40.
[00:49:02] At the investment committee, every Tuesday,
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_00: we review the 40 and we take second calls with sex.
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_00: So typically I'll take a second call with sex.
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_00: And then we invest in three.
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_00: So from 300 to 300 to three,
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_00: so I would 1% conversion rate, but I spoke to sex.
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_00: Maybe the 40 would have liked to talk to me
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_00: and definitely the 260 that didn't talk to anyone
[00:49:20] SPEAKER_00: would like to speak to someone.
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_00: And so putting it out there as a public service to founders
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_00: in terms of getting a, of honing their, their, their,
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_00: like, oh, you know, I don't see the product part of it,
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_00: you don't have to see quite there.
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: The story is not well, high rate through whatever.
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_00: If I can make the AI good enough for that,
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_00: I think is valuable.
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_00: Now, will I live February say I auto decide what to invest in?
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_00: Not, not anytime soon, I can tell you that.
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_00: I'm, by the way, I'm not even sure it will,
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_00: I'm hoping maybe of the 260 companies
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_00: we don't take calls with, a few will be highlighted
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_00: as interesting that we will then take a look at invest in.
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_00: But that's not even what I'm doing it.
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_00: I did all of those because it was an intellectual exercise.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_00: How hard is it to do this?
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_00: And as a result, when I'm being pitch
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: to all these co-pilot ideas, you know,
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_00: how hard is it to do?
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_00: How different it is it really?
[00:50:10] SPEAKER_00: And, and it makes me a better AI investor
[00:50:14] SPEAKER_00: and a better understanding,
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_00: a understander of what are the trends.
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_00: So like, and by the way, it's one of the main,
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_00: main things may be scared about all these AI companies
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_00: is like I started using all my own sacks
[00:50:25] SPEAKER_00: or different sacks like Langchain and Pinecomme
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_00: and on no SQL database.
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_00: And I was using a open source voice to text library
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_00: little by little over the course of the last two years.
[00:50:39] SPEAKER_00: I ripped everything out and I moved to open AI
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_00: as my back ends that I'm using whisper.
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_00: I mean, and all of these, which are, you know,
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_00: companies that got tens of millions
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_00: of the hundreds of millions of VC investment,
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_00: I completely deprecated because I thought
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_00: open AI was doing a better job, cheaper, better faster.
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_00: And it's scary why you see companies like all of AI
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_00: worth four billion and then debt.
[00:51:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:51:04] So one final question is,
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_01: speaking of that, I love the fact
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_01: that you are an economist by background.
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_01: So you have a very interesting macro view of things.
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_01: When it comes to AI, what are the biggest questions
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_01: for which you still don't have an answer, Jett?
[00:51:23] SPEAKER_00: Well, what hasn't been clear yet
[00:51:25] SPEAKER_00: is how much productivity growth is really leading to
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_00: or going to lead to and what type of time frame.
[00:51:32] If you take a step back, like the world
[00:51:35] SPEAKER_00: on general is actually doing pretty well,
[00:51:37] SPEAKER_00: but we have a level of layers of uncertainty, right?
[00:51:39] SPEAKER_00: Like we have clearly fiat currency crises that are coming
[00:51:43] SPEAKER_00: because we have too much government debt
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_00: in most countries, the government is doing too much
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_00: and they're still running deficits.
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_00: We have geopolitical instability
[00:51:51] SPEAKER_00: and a Cold War two brewing, et cetera.
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_00: One way to get out of this actually
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_00: is if we have like nice growth and not a lot,
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_00: like 1% more GDP per capita growth for a year,
[00:52:03] SPEAKER_00: compounded over like 50 years
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_00: and we can actually grow ourselves out of it.
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_00: It's kind of what we did.
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you need to tighten the belt a little bit
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_00: but not a lot.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_00: You can just change maybe the inflation adjustments
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_00: on like social security, how it's measured
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_00: and you know, between that a bit of a higher growth,
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_00: we can like grow ourselves out of that that we have,
[00:52:19] SPEAKER_00: which is what we did after World War Two.
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_00: So what's unclear right now is exactly
[00:52:25] SPEAKER_00: how much productivity we're going to get
[00:52:27] SPEAKER_00: and how quickly are we going to get it.
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_00: And my tuition is we're going to get it
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_00: but it's going to take a lot longer than people think
[00:52:34] SPEAKER_00: because these large companies and these governments,
[00:52:37] SPEAKER_00: and by the way, governments were like 30 to 60% of GDP
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_00: in most countries, they move very slowly.
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_00: It goes back to when do I think AI is like, you know,
[00:52:46] SPEAKER_00: doing my claims processing at the IRS
[00:52:48] SPEAKER_00: or like issuing my new drugs license of the DMV,
[00:52:52] SPEAKER_00: I don't see it happening in the next decade.
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm not even sure the next two decades.
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_00: And so it's going to be a while
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_00: before I think we see it.
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_00: And most of GDP right now is in like that slow moving,
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_00: regulated industries where I would like
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_00: to see more technology applied, like healthcare,
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_00: but it's taking longer than I would like it to.
[00:53:15] Fabriz, there's a great conversation.
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_01: Thank you so much for doing it.
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_01: Have a unique perspective on a lot of topics
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_01: not only start up some venture and just to wrap up.
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_01: I'm also an economist also interested in
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_01: having this conversation.
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_01: So I also like to think of I guess
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_01: these topics from that macro macro lens.
[00:53:34] SPEAKER_01: Okay, perfect. Well, thank you.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_00: And thank you for doing this.
