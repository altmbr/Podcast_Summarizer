[00:00:00] Hey, everyone.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_00: My name is Lyndon, the CEO of Dyna Robotics.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: So we're here to talk about robots.
[00:00:07] All right, hold on.
[00:00:10] So our mission at Dyna is to accelerate
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: in the era of human abundance by building
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_00: general purpose high performance robots.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: And we raised 120 million series A to help us get there.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: So AI has drastically changed our lives
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_00: over the last few years.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: But the impact of AI didn't really
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_00: make his way into the physical world today.
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_00: So Dyna is here to build a foundation model
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_00: for the physical world.
[00:00:40] We're building AI that can see, act, and interact
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_00: with people in our own environment today.
[00:00:50] And why now?
[00:00:52] Historically, robots have been programmed
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_00: with predetermined trajectories in order
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_00: to figure out exactly what it needs to do.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_00: So it's usually used in very repeated environments,
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_00: like hard manufacturing.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_00: But it really hasn't made its way into our everyday world
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_00: like the ones listed here.
[00:01:11] But in the last two years, the acceleration
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_00: of foundation models has really made it possible.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_00: So we're starting to see early signs of life
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: where combined with affordable hardware,
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: now we're able to potentially see robots working
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_00: in complex environments.
[00:01:27] But early signs of life is not enough.
[00:01:31] Robots today is not ready to be commercialized
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_00: because foundation models are not fast enough.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_00: They're not robust enough.
[00:01:39] And also, they cannot execute at the level of quality
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_00: that's comparable to humans.
[00:01:45] So I dyna, we're focused on shipping
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: physical world impact.
[00:01:50] So we're building foundation models
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_00: that can't be commercialized.
[00:01:54] So within six months, we shipped a dyna one,
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_00: which is the world's first embodied AI model
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_00: that could work in a full shift autonomy.
[00:02:04] In a 24 hour period, we were able to fold 850 napkins
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: with a 99.4% success rate at 60% human level speed.
[00:02:15] So some people ask me, so how does that compare to benchmark?
[00:02:19] Well, benchmark didn't really exist before this
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_00: because nobody thought it was possible.
[00:02:26] And we're not just shipping demos.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: We're already in commercial environments
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: where customers are actively using them.
[00:02:33] And not only is it just that, the robots setting up robots
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: only take about 30 minutes.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: It's the same robot, same model, new environments,
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_00: zero shot.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_00: That also doesn't exist anywhere.
[00:02:47] And on top of that, we're not stopping here.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_00: We're also continuing to scale the front here
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_00: of physical AGI and frontier research.
[00:02:56] So as you can see here, we're continuing
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: to scale into more complex tasks,
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_00: agentically reasoning, but more importantly, generalization.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: We believe that physical AGI is not far
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_00: and we're here to win.
[00:03:09] So the team is awesome.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: We built everything that we have done within a year,
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: with only about 25 engineers and researchers.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: And we have some of the best people
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: from some of the top firms here.
[00:03:23] And for myself, I sold a company for 350 mil prior to this.
[00:03:28] And we're hiring across the board.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: A lot of people, software, hardware, ML, Infra, ops,
[00:03:38] bizdad, you name it.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_00: And we're a team of very, very icy driven culture,
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: very, very flat, and we're focused on finding the best people.
[00:03:49] So if you're a 10X engineer and you don't care about work
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: life balance, you could come join our team.
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_00: We're pushing the frontier of AGI at our robots
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: know how to play golf.
[00:04:03] All right, thank you.
