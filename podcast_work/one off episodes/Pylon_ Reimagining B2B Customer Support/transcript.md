[00:00:00] We have this core value now, which is we are happy grinders.
[00:00:03] Marty Kausas: And I mean, you like to describe this as like the high competency low ego kind of like
[00:00:07] Marty Kausas: debate style culture.
[00:00:09] Marty Kausas: And we still live together. That's the crazy thing.
[00:00:11] Marty Kausas: You know, we used to live in the office and there's that whole story about that.
[00:00:13] Marty Kausas: And that like iconic photo of Robert, like on a mattress on the ground in the living room.
[00:00:17] Marty Kausas: But people think, oh, you're serious being out.
[00:00:19] Marty Kausas: You're doing so well.
[00:00:20] Marty Kausas: You probably have like nice living situation.
[00:00:22] Marty Kausas: And you know, we live in like a dinky apartment.
[00:00:25] Marty Kausas: We don't get any light.
[00:00:26] Marty Kausas: See, we don't have windows to give people sense.
[00:00:29] Marty Kausas: Like we are very, very scrappy.
[00:00:30] Marty Kausas: Part of the reason you like us, of course, is we are all in on the company.
[00:00:34] Marty Kausas: You shouldn't choose your co-founder based on like the idea you're working on, because you'll probably pivot.
[00:00:38] Marty Kausas: We just wanted to build a really big company, honestly, like just a good business,
[00:00:42] Marty Kausas: which is like very counter to I think a lot of founders who are like very obsessed with just like,
[00:00:46] Marty Kausas: Hey, I want to build like a really nice product or something for us.
[00:00:49] Marty Kausas: It's like the business is really.
[00:00:50] Marty Kausas: He also took a very product first approach there too, because I think a lot of the other people in our
[00:00:54] Advith Chelikani: got to just like throwing AI at the wall and seeing what was stick.
[00:00:57] Advith Chelikani: But we like went to the customers first, figured out what the problems were and just made sure that like,
[00:01:00] Advith Chelikani: I actually was they can search.
[00:01:05] Well, so so glad to have you all here, Marty, Edworth and Robert.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_04: We're going to talk a lot about founding and B2B support and Pylon today.
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_04: Maybe to kick it off.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_04: Can you walk us through?
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_04: How did the throw of you get together and spark the idea of starting Pylon?
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I just you want to go.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_03: Sure.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_03: So Robert and I went to college together.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_03: We both went to Caltech while we're at Caltech.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_03: We ran our school hackathon for a couple of years,
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_03: hack tech, which was basically like a company building experience minus building product.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_03: It's a lot of like organizing people like spending a lot of time working together.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_03: We figured out that we work well together.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_03: Then Robert did this internship program called KP Fellows, which you also did.
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_03: We're in the same year.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_03: I remember meeting you at an Uber and being like, Oh, hey, nice to be here.
[00:01:50] Advith Chelikani: This is what like 2016 years, I mean, six nine years ago.
[00:01:53] Advith Chelikani: Yeah.
[00:01:53] Advith Chelikani: Yeah.
[00:01:54] Advith Chelikani: Yeah.
[00:01:55] Wow.
[00:01:55] Time flies.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_03: So Robert did that program.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_03: He was at DoorDash in turning that summer.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_03: And then that's how I found out about that program.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_03: And I did it the next year.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_03: I was at Slack and Marty did it the same year.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_03: I did it.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_03: And Marty was at Airbnb.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_03: Marty and I met a bit that summer.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_03: It's just because we were part of the same program.
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_03: But really, we ended up living together after we graduated.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_03: And that's how Marty and I became close.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_03: Then I switched to living with Robert.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_03: I live with Marty for a couple of years after I graduated.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_03: And I live with Robert for a couple of years.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_03: And now all three of us live together.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_03: How long have it been living together?
[00:02:26] Well, now it's been since the start of the company.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_03: Three years.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:02:30] Yeah.
[00:02:30] And we still live together.
[00:02:32] Marty Kausas: That's the crazy thing.
[00:02:32] Marty Kausas: Like a lot of people think that we like, you know, we used to live in the office.
[00:02:36] Marty Kausas: And there's that whole story about that.
[00:02:37] Marty Kausas: And now like iconic photo of Robert, like on a mattress on the ground in the living room.
[00:02:41] Marty Kausas: But yeah, people think, Oh, you're serious.
[00:02:43] Marty Kausas: But now you must be you're doing so well.
[00:02:45] Marty Kausas: You probably have like nice living situation.
[00:02:48] Marty Kausas: And no, we live in like a dinky apartment.
[00:02:51] Marty Kausas: That's like one apartment or one light.
[00:02:54] Marty Kausas: Yeah, we don't have windows to give people sense.
[00:02:56] Marty Kausas: Like we are very, very scrappy.
[00:02:58] Marty Kausas: And I feel like this kind of part of the reason you like us, of course, is we are all in on the company.
[00:03:03] Marty Kausas: So that's really our only priority.
[00:03:05] Marty Kausas: Definitely.
[00:03:05] Marty Kausas: That was one of the main topic I wanted to talk about today is recently there was a
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_04: Wall Street Journal article.
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_04: I think titled with something like no, no, no sleep, no, no, no fun about AI era founding.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_04: I'm really curious.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_04: First, what do you agree and disagree as the article?
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_04: And how do you think that the working culture and the grinding nature of the founders impact the company culture?
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think like one thing they got wrong, like really wrong is, or maybe they, they took a different spin on it.
[00:03:41] Marty Kausas: Is that we are very motivated by fun and adventure.
[00:03:44] Marty Kausas: I feel like that actually when you talk about like the founding of Pylon and why we did it, it really like,
[00:03:49] Marty Kausas: they're easier ways to make money that don't require grinding 12 hours a day for, you know, 10 years straight.
[00:03:54] Marty Kausas: Passion, it feels like even if you're really passionate about solving a problem, it's not worth spending that much time solving that problem.
[00:04:00] Marty Kausas: It's just too much hard work and sacrifice.
[00:04:03] Marty Kausas: So it really feels like adventure and fun is the one of the best reasons to start a company.
[00:04:07] Marty Kausas: And so for us, that's definitely our core motivation.
[00:04:10] Marty Kausas: And so I think they got that wrong.
[00:04:12] Marty Kausas: And then also, you know, yeah, no booze.
[00:04:14] Marty Kausas: I think that's like generally correct.
[00:04:16] Marty Kausas: We don't drink that often, maybe just for like big celebrations.
[00:04:19] Marty Kausas: No sleep is true for me at least.
[00:04:21] Marty Kausas: Robert, I think all of us, you maybe get the best sleep out of this.
[00:04:25] Robert Eng: Yeah, I feel like it's hard to have longgemony if you don't have a sleep.
[00:04:29] Yeah, we do invest in our sleep though.
[00:04:31] Advith Chelikani: Our mattresses are expensive.
[00:04:33] Advith Chelikani: I guess I'm also a fan of furniture in that.
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_04: It's in key office.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_04: I don't know the bed frame.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:04:38] Marty Kausas: This is like such classically startup energy.
[00:04:42] Marty Kausas: It's like the, yeah, Robert has a mat.
[00:04:44] Marty Kausas: He used to have in the living room of our old office, a mattress that was on the floor
[00:04:48] Marty Kausas: within eight sleep on it.
[00:04:49] Marty Kausas: It's like a most start to like no bed frame, no nothing like one pillow.
[00:04:54] Marty Kausas: I mean, if you look in the picture too in the background under the basketball hoop,
[00:04:57] Advith Chelikani: you can see my closet as well and all my life's possessions.
[00:05:02] Marty Kausas: They're minimalistic.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_04: And then the other thing that the article didn't fully capture was that I think,
[00:05:09] Marty Kausas: you know, first off, we work way more than 9.6 actually.
[00:05:11] Marty Kausas: So it's like we've never used that term.
[00:05:14] Marty Kausas: We just work all the time.
[00:05:16] Marty Kausas: In fact, I think so, yeah, minimum six days a week.
[00:05:19] Marty Kausas: That's like the norm and then advocacy used to work seven days a week.
[00:05:23] Marty Kausas: I don't know how like the machine.
[00:05:26] Robert Eng: Robert, Robert, I feel like we need more time, right?
[00:05:28] Robert Eng: I feel like Saturday's at many of my Saturdays.
[00:05:30] Robert Eng: I don't have my Saturday.
[00:05:33] Robert Eng: Now I actually feel like you were the best in the shoot.
[00:05:36] Robert Eng: Is it at level of peer pressure?
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_04: They apply into each other is like if you're working at better,
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_04: be working too.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_04: And how does that also manifest within the company too?
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_04: Like if the three founders are always in office,
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_04: always working to the employees also feel the obligation that they should appear
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_04: and not leave early.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_04: I don't think like minutes, it's no, I don't think they feel that pressure.
[00:05:54] Marty Kausas: Maybe they feel it more now with the article that came out.
[00:05:58] Marty Kausas: Actually, I feel like people are questioning internally.
[00:06:00] Marty Kausas: We actually had to clarify and I like post it.
[00:06:02] Marty Kausas: Even candidates now.
[00:06:03] Marty Kausas: There's some people that are totally scared off.
[00:06:05] Marty Kausas: There's some people to it.
[00:06:06] Marty Kausas: We had an AE who came in yesterday who was like,
[00:06:08] Marty Kausas: I'm all in on it.
[00:06:09] Marty Kausas: Like get me into the 9.96.
[00:06:11] Marty Kausas: This is the moment in my life where I want to grind.
[00:06:14] Marty Kausas: And so people in the team have been saying,
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_03: like, oh, we know you guys.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_03: So we know what it's actually like.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_03: But people from the outside might have a certain perception
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_03: given what is in the article and what other people are saying.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_03: So I feel like there's the clarification that can be done.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_03: I at least had a bunch of interviews where people were not very pleased
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_03: that that being an article had to clarify.
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_03: No, that's not really what it's like.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_03: It's about getting stuff done and that does involve a lot of work.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_03: But it's really just about output and moving fast.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_03: I think that's a careful distinction that we,
[00:06:45] Advith Chelikani: or at least I've been telling people,
[00:06:46] Advith Chelikani: it's like as founders were in 9.96 and we're very happy to do 9.96
[00:06:50] Advith Chelikani: or more than that.
[00:06:51] Advith Chelikani: But for the employees, it's like, hey,
[00:06:52] Advith Chelikani: we understand that you have your own life and everything.
[00:06:55] Advith Chelikani: I do think that some people do work really long hours
[00:06:58] Advith Chelikani: and work really hard over the weekends.
[00:07:00] Advith Chelikani: Just because they love their craft and they just,
[00:07:02] Advith Chelikani: when they're bored after dinner,
[00:07:03] Advith Chelikani: they just start working or like over the weekend.
[00:07:05] Advith Chelikani: But it's not like a requirement.
[00:07:07] Advith Chelikani: And everybody kind of knows that.
[00:07:09] Advith Chelikani: I will say though, like now,
[00:07:11] Marty Kausas: especially as we're building our like a view on leadership team,
[00:07:14] Marty Kausas: we have like our head of sales is in on Sundays,
[00:07:17] Marty Kausas: like just the entire day and like grinding all the freaking time.
[00:07:20] Marty Kausas: And now that we're starting to recruit for a head of marketing,
[00:07:23] Marty Kausas: I almost feel like we, I don't know,
[00:07:25] Marty Kausas: I feel like now the bar has been set so high where I feel like we actually need.
[00:07:29] Marty Kausas: I feel like almost for the exact team,
[00:07:30] Marty Kausas: maybe there's like different rule sets that we should apply.
[00:07:32] Marty Kausas: At least on the go-to market.
[00:07:34] Robert Eng: This is very different.
[00:07:36] Robert Eng: The thing is we've actually even split the company into like two now.
[00:07:39] Marty Kausas: So we have go-to market on one side.
[00:07:42] Marty Kausas: And that or specifically sales and marketing on one side of the office.
[00:07:45] Marty Kausas: And then like engineering product design,
[00:07:47] Marty Kausas: you know, CS on the other.
[00:07:50] Marty Kausas: And actually the two cultures are completely different.
[00:07:52] Marty Kausas: Totally.
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_04: Which always happens with B2B enterprise businesses.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_04: But I think in this case, even more so,
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_04: there is the role and the responsibility split.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_04: But also I'm curious, given the nature of the working culture,
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_04: does that impact sort of either the age group or type of people that you attract?
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_04: Because I do remember that you mentioned an article where as founders,
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_04: you want to work very hard.
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_04: And you think employees should see that as positive.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_04: Because this is most meaningful work to you and your building this to success,
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_04: where they're not expected to do so.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_04: But they should be very motivated to see the founders start working super hard
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_04: and treat this as their life's work.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_04: But I'm just curious about how you think about how it impacts sort of the dynamic
[00:08:39] you're bringing into the...
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_04: I mean, it should trickle down at least a little bit.
[00:08:43] Marty Kausas: I feel like we should have the expectation that people will work like some percentage
[00:08:46] Marty Kausas: of what we work.
[00:08:47] Marty Kausas: So it's...
[00:08:48] Marty Kausas: And I think it is also motivating.
[00:08:50] Marty Kausas: The people who just like know and they're experienced and like,
[00:08:53] Marty Kausas: they're not going to care.
[00:08:54] Marty Kausas: They're just going to work the hours that they want and go home
[00:08:56] Marty Kausas: and then need to, etc.
[00:08:57] Marty Kausas: Because they just know they're going to do a good job and be efficient.
[00:09:00] Marty Kausas: I think we do enable then the younger set of team members to stay in late.
[00:09:06] Marty Kausas: And I think they get really excited about that.
[00:09:08] Marty Kausas: Like there are a couple of new...
[00:09:09] Marty Kausas: Yeah, I think it's about making it fun for the...
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_03: I think they will stay late if they're having a good time.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_03: And they're like seeing the company move forward.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_03: They're like, this is the same when we were new grads.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_03: I think a lot of my social life was around.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_03: The people are working.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_03: I didn't think about that I was working a lot.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_03: It was just a lot of fun.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_03: And it was like blended work plus fun.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_03: And so at least that feels great if we can give that to people.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_03: What are some of the intentional decisions you have made
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_04: that's impacting either the cultural aspect of how people are working together
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_04: and bringing the fun?
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_04: I remember when you're doing all handstands.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_04: There's a lot of shout out.
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_04: There are also the handraisers.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_04: There are also the different events you put on together.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_04: Are those couple of things you're trying to leverage
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_04: to bring the team closer with each other?
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_04: Or what are the other things you have done that find useful?
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, probably one of the biggest is just the in-person culture.
[00:10:09] Marty Kausas: I think it attracts a lot of people who explicitly are looking for that.
[00:10:13] Marty Kausas: And they're burnt out of being removed.
[00:10:15] Marty Kausas: Or they don't get to interact with their team members
[00:10:17] Marty Kausas: or get onboarded to learn from them.
[00:10:19] Marty Kausas: So I think in-person is probably one of the biggest things.
[00:10:23] Marty Kausas: I think I'm...
[00:10:24] Marty Kausas: Oh, go ahead.
[00:10:24] Marty Kausas: I would just say we all eat lunch together for the most part.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_03: I think that actually has helped us get away with way less process
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_03: or cross-functional things for a longer amount of time
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_03: because people just ended up talking to each other.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_03: And people find out what other teams are working on,
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_03: what other people on their team are working on as the team grows.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_03: So that feels like it's got a lot of lift.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_03: And yeah, I don't know if we plan for all of this to happen,
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_03: but that's been the side effect of that.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_03: And another one that I don't think we even realized how rare this was,
[00:10:51] Marty Kausas: but transparency on company metrics,
[00:10:54] Marty Kausas: which I think then spreads to the rest of the team.
[00:10:57] Marty Kausas: Everyone sees every deal that is one
[00:11:00] Marty Kausas: and the amount, every purestancies,
[00:11:02] Marty Kausas: what deals are lost in the reason,
[00:11:04] Marty Kausas: like churn as well.
[00:11:05] Marty Kausas: And then there's also a live company dashboard
[00:11:07] Marty Kausas: that everyone can see or revenue every single month
[00:11:09] Marty Kausas: like in that moment in time.
[00:11:11] Marty Kausas: So...
[00:11:12] Marty Kausas: And then at the end of the month,
[00:11:13] Marty Kausas: we send you, of course, our investor update.
[00:11:15] Marty Kausas: They also receive that same update with cash and bank,
[00:11:18] Marty Kausas: burn, all that fun stuff.
[00:11:19] Marty Kausas: And like, you know, what went well, what didn't go well.
[00:11:22] Marty Kausas: So the team is like very...
[00:11:24] Marty Kausas: Yeah, they're very aware of kind of what's going on in the company.
[00:11:26] Marty Kausas: Of course, it's easier when things are going well.
[00:11:28] Marty Kausas: I think when one day things are going more poorly,
[00:11:31] Marty Kausas: maybe you will have to like lock down some of the information.
[00:11:34] But at least right now,
[00:11:36] Marty Kausas: I think that's been really, really helpful.
[00:11:37] Marty Kausas: And then also,
[00:11:39] Marty Kausas: this is probably reflected just in the way Robert Abbuth and I engage is like,
[00:11:43] Marty Kausas: we have this core value now, which is we are happy granders.
[00:11:46] Marty Kausas: And the...
[00:11:47] Marty Kausas: I mean, you like to describe this as like the high competency low ego,
[00:11:51] Marty Kausas: kind of like debate style culture.
[00:11:54] Marty Kausas: And it's, you know, if you heard us, I mean, you've heard us, I guess,
[00:11:57] Marty Kausas: in conversation and in board meetings.
[00:11:59] Marty Kausas: Like, we just were very transparent and very direct.
[00:12:03] Marty Kausas: And it's just, we just debate ideas until we get tired.
[00:12:06] Marty Kausas: And there's no like ego in it.
[00:12:09] Marty Kausas: It's actually, we just are aligned on the core thing that we want to accomplish,
[00:12:11] Marty Kausas: which is build a really big generational business.
[00:12:14] Marty Kausas: And yeah, we're not...
[00:12:16] Marty Kausas: Yeah, we're low ego about the conversations we have.
[00:12:19] Marty Kausas: On the point of transparency,
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_04: Pylon, that you guys are probably the best example of beauty in public.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_04: A lot of things are being shared very publicly on LinkedIn,
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_04: on Twitter of either business metrics or you do a fundraising of Series A.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_04: That was a very popular tweet.
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_04: How has that impacted sort of how you're seeing
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_04: this benefit of beauty in public.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_04: And how do you get comfortable also doing so?
[00:12:46] Marty Kausas: Well, what's asked you the question,
[00:12:49] Marty Kausas: did you were you influenced by us before you invested in us?
[00:12:52] Marty Kausas: Do you remember, were you seeing our content?
[00:12:55] I definitely remember every time I opened LinkedIn, there was a Pylon post.
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_04: So the keeping top of mind part definitely worked very well.
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_04: And yeah, it's great to hear from a first party perspective of what went well,
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_04: what not, like the thinking behind each decision just rees very thoughtful.
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_04: And I certainly liked a lot about that.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think for us, so originally it was just for Pylon generation.
[00:13:23] Marty Kausas: And so we were posting like really shitty content originally.
[00:13:27] Marty Kausas: It was so bad.
[00:13:28] Marty Kausas: It was...
[00:13:29] Marty Kausas: Do you remember that one with the magnifying glass?
[00:13:31] Marty Kausas: Oh, I'm thinking of the Cheetah one.
[00:13:33] Marty Kausas: Oh, that was really funny.
[00:13:35] Marty Kausas: This thing, there was so bad.
[00:13:38] Marty Kausas: There were months.
[00:13:39] Marty Kausas: And what's funny is the history of that, it was so not planned in the way that some people might
[00:13:45] Marty Kausas: think of like, oh, we were very strategic about it.
[00:13:48] Marty Kausas: Actually, there was a YC founder from our batch who said, like, oh, I have a few thousand followers
[00:13:53] Marty Kausas: on LinkedIn, which we thought was huge at the time.
[00:13:55] Marty Kausas: Like, oh my god, this guy's massive.
[00:13:57] Marty Kausas: And here's like...
[00:13:58] Marty Kausas: And how many followers do you have now?
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_04: Like 45,000.
[00:14:03] Marty Kausas: So we definitely growing.
[00:14:04] Marty Kausas: Wow.
[00:14:05] Marty Kausas: Yeah, we're getting there.
[00:14:06] Marty Kausas: We're getting there.
[00:14:07] Marty Kausas: And...
[00:14:07] Marty Kausas: What's your goal?
[00:14:09] I mean, I just moved revenue.
[00:14:11] Marty Kausas: That's all I have to say.
[00:14:12] Marty Kausas: This is leads somehow.
[00:14:13] Marty Kausas: I told you.
[00:14:14] Marty Kausas: We need to translate.
[00:14:16] Marty Kausas: Is your goal post of like a person or a company,
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_04: I'd have way more followers than...
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_04: I think there's like one person in the customer success space who actually just retired,
[00:14:25] Marty Kausas: Nick Mehta, who started Gainsight.
[00:14:27] Marty Kausas: And he has like 100 K followers.
[00:14:29] Marty Kausas: And so...
[00:14:30] Marty Kausas: They're happily there.
[00:14:31] Marty Kausas: That's pretty crazy, actually.
[00:14:32] Marty Kausas: So like in terms of influence, that is like an insane, like,
[00:14:35] Marty Kausas: we're quite far given how long we've been doing this.
[00:14:38] Marty Kausas: So that is exciting.
[00:14:39] Marty Kausas: But I feel like there has been a little bit of a plateau.
[00:14:41] Marty Kausas: And like, maybe we've saturated a lot of the people that,
[00:14:45] Marty Kausas: you know, really like the type of content we produce.
[00:14:48] Marty Kausas: Yeah, we need to keep expanding.
[00:14:49] Marty Kausas: But when we started, it was just, hey, we want to produce pipeline.
[00:14:52] Marty Kausas: This like other YC founder told us that it's working for them.
[00:14:55] Marty Kausas: And so we just started posting like anything about at the time,
[00:14:58] Marty Kausas: like, how did you customer support on Slack?
[00:15:00] Marty Kausas: And it didn't work for months.
[00:15:02] Marty Kausas: And then there was one post that we made about how, you know,
[00:15:05] Marty Kausas: it took us 17 days to go from idea to paid MVP.
[00:15:08] Marty Kausas: And it was a photo of the three of us in our apartment at the time.
[00:15:13] Marty Kausas: And that post just like absolutely took off.
[00:15:15] Marty Kausas: I didn't even realize it if they can all have actually...
[00:15:17] Marty Kausas: I remember adding that you like three days later, it's like a weekend or maybe Monday,
[00:15:21] Marty Kausas: you're like, oh, I think the post is doing really well.
[00:15:23] Marty Kausas: And it like suddenly you check it's like, okay, hundreds of likes.
[00:15:25] Marty Kausas: It's like, wow, that's like more than the five that we usually get.
[00:15:28] Marty Kausas: And then it like they went up to like a thousand plus and 300K impressions.
[00:15:33] Marty Kausas: And I don't remember if we like immediately saw the demo spike or something.
[00:15:37] Marty Kausas: Like I don't remember having that thought.
[00:15:39] Marty Kausas: But we definitely started hearing from prospects coming in that like,
[00:15:42] Marty Kausas: oh, we see you guys on LinkedIn or even just like anecdotally at events that we would go to.
[00:15:47] Marty Kausas: It's like, oh, we like you guys seem to be doing well.
[00:15:49] Marty Kausas: So this like perception started building that.
[00:15:52] Marty Kausas: First off, people know who we are.
[00:15:53] Marty Kausas: And then also they, you know, think we're doing really well.
[00:15:55] Marty Kausas: And they're excited about the content.
[00:15:57] Marty Kausas: So that try to replicate that post many times and that post.
[00:16:01] Marty Kausas: What it really told us was people like stories and they like,
[00:16:03] Marty Kausas: you know, they're built in public type content.
[00:16:05] Marty Kausas: But I think really beforehand was not present on LinkedIn.
[00:16:09] Marty Kausas: I think it was present on X but never to this like more like professional network.
[00:16:15] Definitely.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_04: You have definitely figured out at this point algorithm to hack LinkedIn.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_04: So we should go to to Pylon.
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_04: Tell us how Pylon is not just another support ticketing system or a chatbot.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_04: Yeah. So we're the first customer support platform that's built for B2B companies.
[00:16:34] Marty Kausas: And so one way to think about this is if you just look at like consumer companies,
[00:16:38] Marty Kausas: they just have one customer facing team, which is just the support team.
[00:16:41] Marty Kausas: And they deal with very simple transactional tickets.
[00:16:44] Marty Kausas: In B2B, you have many customer facing teams that all should be working together,
[00:16:48] Marty Kausas: sharing customer data, sharing customer workflows.
[00:16:51] Marty Kausas: And so you end up buying like this combination of tools, not just like a customer support
[00:16:55] Marty Kausas: platform, but things for customer success, account management, professional services,
[00:16:58] Marty Kausas: solutions. And we've built one product that's encompassing all the needs of all those teams.
[00:17:02] Marty Kausas: And so that's what that B2B focus looks like. And of course,
[00:17:06] Marty Kausas: if we have all these workflows and data altogether and these different teams working within it,
[00:17:10] Marty Kausas: there's a lot of opportunity for AI to make things a lot faster.
[00:17:13] Marty Kausas: For sure. And tying back to the earlier question, like if you want to build something really fun,
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_04: like B2B support is probably not the first thing people reach out to.
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_04: You're like, this is so fun. And I'm feeling a B2B support system.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_04: How did you get to this idea? And what was the navigation and the pivots throughout the way?
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, there were many pivots. You guys want to name a few like the...
[00:17:33] Marty Kausas: We started at Tech, I think.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_03: We started by building this idea. Most easily accessible people to do a user discovery on was,
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_03: well, first we basically started the whole journey by first deciding we want to start a company
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_03: and then figuring out what to work on. So it was driven by...
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_03: Until your point, the fun is more like the journey rather than the specific thing we're building.
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_03: I think it's pretty easy to get excited and like intellectually curious about most types of things.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_03: And so yeah, we're I think more excited about the process of company building.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_03: The first thing we worked on was we went back to college and like those were the easiest
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_03: set of people to do user discovery on. And so we talked a bunch of the administrators and asked
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_03: them what problems they had. The career center lady had said...
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_03: terrible ideas about college. Like alumni being connected with college students. So we built some kind
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_03: of portal for alumni to get connected to students. We built it. We made every mistake possible.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_03: Like we were just like building before like selling. We were
[00:18:27] Advith Chelikani: working in these tarpits spaces that don't make any sense to build a company in. Yeah, it's
[00:18:31] Advith Chelikani: pretty brutal. Yeah. And then also important context like we at different points were working
[00:18:37] Marty Kausas: separately as well. And so you guys, did you guys also work on things separately beforehand
[00:18:41] Marty Kausas: or just together? Just together. Okay. So yeah. So you guys start together. This is like a year and a
[00:18:45] Marty Kausas: half before Pylon. Right. More. Yeah. I was like shortly after the pandemic. Yeah. I think I
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_03: messaged Robert. I was like I was having an existential crisis. I think I started on my 23rd
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_03: birthday. And I was like, I feel like I'm wasting my life. Do you want to work on something?
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And then separately, I had left Airbnb maybe like half a year before they started and
[00:19:06] Marty Kausas: was like pivoting through many ideas with two different sets of co-founders actually. And at some
[00:19:10] Marty Kausas: point, so I then, you know, these two sets, two co-founders didn't work out for many reasons.
[00:19:14] Marty Kausas: Also like the same classic mistakes of one was like, oh, like work with the business co-founder
[00:19:19] Marty Kausas: and then another was, hey, like I couldn't convince the person to leave their company. And they
[00:19:24] Marty Kausas: were kind of later stage in life and had a family and didn't want to take the risk. And then I like,
[00:19:29] Marty Kausas: you know, corded them strongly. And they rejected multiple times. Like I actually, so I like we had
[00:19:39] Marty Kausas: like a reason. Well, we can ask them right now. But there was a good reason. Yeah, I think it
[00:19:45] Robert Eng: makes sense. But basically, okay, like, you know, I'm messaging them. I'm like, hey, you guys
[00:19:49] Marty Kausas: are going to start up. So we're doing sort of stuff. We like talk. Robert and I didn't know each other
[00:19:53] Marty Kausas: that well at the time. So it was primarily like, at the being the glue. And so I had message you,
[00:19:58] Marty Kausas: you were like, I'm working with Robert on these things. And then like we kind of like, I remember
[00:20:02] Marty Kausas: like, have some like messenger video chat or something. And then I thought they were down to work
[00:20:08] Marty Kausas: with me. And then a week later, I'm like, so when are we getting started? And then they're like,
[00:20:13] Robert Eng: Oh, like, I don't know. And so that was rejection, like number one. And then we came up for a KPP
[00:20:21] Marty Kausas: fellow alumni or I came up. You guys were in, I was in LA during the pandemic. And then you guys
[00:20:25] Marty Kausas: were in SF working on your ideas. I came up, tried to convince you guys again. And literally,
[00:20:30] Marty Kausas: like, I remember, I think it was like a Friday, you guys had said like, no again. And you're like,
[00:20:35] Marty Kausas: we're actually going to go work with these other guys who like understand the logistics space.
[00:20:40] Marty Kausas: Because that's what they were working on. And then, yeah, you guys, yeah, you were like,
[00:20:44] Marty Kausas: Oh, yeah, we're going to do that. It doesn't make sense to work with you. So I gave up this
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_04: serious co-founder chasing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just co-founder dating. Yeah.
[00:20:53] Robert Eng: For the day. No, I mean, I got, yeah, rejected twice by Biden's magnificent
[00:20:58] Robert Eng: people. Very, very hard to chase. I pursued. I pursued. But then I gave up. And, and yeah,
[00:21:06] Robert Eng: you guys had decided to work with these other people. And then what had to say what happened
[00:21:10] Robert Eng: over that weekend when you basically, yeah, we were pretty excited about this logistics idea.
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_03: It was kind of related to what I was working on at SimSara spun out and like explored more into an
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_03: idea. It actually felt like the first idea that like passed the mom test process and was
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_03: something that couldn't turn into a big company. But we determined that we didn't have enough
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_03: founder market fit there because it would be a very sales heavy idea in like the freight brokerage
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_03: space. So then we were pair trying to pair up with these two guys who would like, I think started
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_03: unicorns in the logistics space. We had a sales background. But then we realized that we thought
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_03: they weren't going to do that much work, but they wanted 50% of the company. And so we just couldn't
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_03: reach into conclusion on the equity there. And then we also learned that you shouldn't choose
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_03: your co-founder based on like the idea you're working on because you'll probably pivot. And
[00:21:53] yeah, actually, we would have just been poor all around. But we came to that conclusion and then
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_03: we're like, okay, we shouldn't pair up with random people. Yeah. So then on Monday or like maybe
[00:22:03] Marty Kausas: like the night before they messaged me, they're like, hey, do you want to co-work from our apartment?
[00:22:08] And I co-found our work trial. Yeah. And I actually, I'd given up. I was like, yeah, I mean,
[00:22:12] Marty Kausas: they literally rejected me three days. They're just trying to hang out. That's it. And so yeah,
[00:22:17] Marty Kausas: like show up in the morning, like sit down. There's like this like mini like desk clump in their
[00:22:21] Marty Kausas: apartment. And yeah. And then like add this term to me. And he's like, so we talked about it.
[00:22:27] Marty Kausas: And I think we should worship him. I was like, what are you talking about? I was like stunned.
[00:22:33] Robert Eng: I literally have been like three months of me like trying to get you guys to say, yeah,
[00:22:38] Robert Eng: that was no idea or that. No, so the context that he left out is that the reason we just we thought
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_03: it wouldn't be good. I didn't work together. Is it felt like in the period where you like don't
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_03: actually have an idea that's validated more and more people piling on becomes a crude term of
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_03: like intellectual masturbation. We're just like telling each other the idea is good. I'm like,
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_03: it's like kind of going in a circle. And you're not, because you're not in execution mode. So you
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_03: can't like unload your resources on like trying to execute. You're just like kind of thinking and
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_03: doing user discovery. So it felt counterproductive to do that with too many people. So we're like, okay,
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_03: once we come up with an idea and we're committed. Maybe then it makes sense to like pair up. And
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_03: at this point, that's why I felt like this logistics idea was pretty validated and so we could
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_03: like start to move into execution mode. Yeah, that's the other fundamental idea. Honestly, like when
[00:23:23] Advith Chelikani: we were validating the idea at YC, like we listed all the ideas we had we have worked on and it was
[00:23:29] Advith Chelikani: the logistics idea was like clearly the best one. And they recommended we work on this idea.
[00:23:33] Advith Chelikani: And they told us the pile on one is like, okay, but obviously you went in with that idea. You came
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_04: out with the pile on idea. So that happened there. So this was actually very, very helpful that it
[00:23:44] Marty Kausas: worked out this way because we, we, so I had an idea that was some like fintech thing. And they had
[00:23:49] Marty Kausas: this idea that was logistics. And so, okay, we both have an idea. How do we decide which one to work on?
[00:23:54] Marty Kausas: So it actually forced us to be more critical about idea evaluation and comparing. So we literally
[00:23:59] Marty Kausas: wrote down we're like, okay, well, let's like explore both. And so I think we spent like a day or two
[00:24:03] Marty Kausas: looking at both ideas, like trying to mark, you know, map out the markets for each one. So we've
[00:24:08] Marty Kausas: literally have a Google sheet that we can find where it's like, okay, this fintech idea if it goes
[00:24:13] Marty Kausas: perfectly well, here's how much revenue we could generate if we like capture the whole market.
[00:24:16] Marty Kausas: Right. And so that one was I think like high tens of millions. I think it was like 40 million
[00:24:20] Marty Kausas: revenue. It was like, it was small, right? That's like max. We win the market. And the logistics
[00:24:25] Marty Kausas: idea was like hundreds of low hundreds of millions, I think, in revenue that for that initial product
[00:24:30] Marty Kausas: idea. And then like we had this idea that like working on B2B SaaS at the time was kind of like
[00:24:35] Marty Kausas: selling out. And it was like you choose. Like all the cool things are like dev tools or some
[00:24:41] Marty Kausas: vertical sourcing and then B2B SaaS was where people iterate to and they're like once they get burnt
[00:24:46] Marty Kausas: out on like trying other cooler ideas. And I don't know. We put so we had because we were an idea
[00:24:51] Marty Kausas: evaluation phase, we had idea one idea to and then we put rippling in like a third tab and we're
[00:24:57] Marty Kausas: like, okay, how big is rippling? And we just realized that the market for rippling was so big.
[00:25:03] Marty Kausas: Because you just take everyone who needs to be paid money for payroll is multiply that times
[00:25:07] Marty Kausas: a number and you're like, oh my god, like the order of magnitude here is probably it must have been
[00:25:11] Marty Kausas: like hundreds of billions or something. Like something crazy. I think it was like tens of billions.
[00:25:15] Marty Kausas: Tens of billions. So like two orders of magnitude higher. And so that for that exercise was
[00:25:20] Marty Kausas: actually incredibly helpful because then it was like, okay, we have to critically think about
[00:25:24] Marty Kausas: ideas and like battle test them against each other. And so it was actually one of our first like
[00:25:28] Marty Kausas: big decisions or learnings that like, okay, like this is how to think about the difference in these
[00:25:32] Marty Kausas: ideas. And then also like throughout the process of idea evaluation, we had decided that, you know,
[00:25:38] Marty Kausas: the goals of the cut. So understanding like the motivation for us, we were very aligned that the
[00:25:43] Marty Kausas: why it was kind of like fun and like, hey, we had all romanticized this idea of building a company
[00:25:47] Marty Kausas: and that was what kind of pushed us. The what we decided we just wanted to build a really big
[00:25:53] Marty Kausas: company, honestly, like just a good business, which is like very counter to I think a lot of
[00:25:58] Marty Kausas: founders who are like very obsessed with just like, hey, I want to build like a really nice product
[00:26:01] Marty Kausas: or something for us. It's like the business is really. And so, yeah, we looked we looked at,
[00:26:07] Marty Kausas: you know, this is over the course of like many months and throughout the history of the company.
[00:26:11] Marty Kausas: But like we would look at, for example, how many SaaS companies got to certain sizes and went public.
[00:26:19] Marty Kausas: And so, for example, we looked at, hey, 76, there are 76 public SaaS companies who are worth over a
[00:26:25] Marty Kausas: billion dollars at the time. And this is measured by like a cloud spend or their cloud software is more
[00:26:32] Marty Kausas: than 40% of the rent. So we found some less than that. So only 76, which is really small for one
[00:26:37] Marty Kausas: billion. Exactly. 10 billion is 26. That's like crazy. And then 100 billion was like four.
[00:26:44] Marty Kausas: And so it's like, okay, wow, that's not a lot of companies. And so if you observe, if you just try
[00:26:49] Marty Kausas: to like understand why did some companies get to 10 billion dollars market cap, we're able to then
[00:26:55] Marty Kausas: really like market was a really, really big differentiator where you just no matter what it's
[00:26:59] Marty Kausas: going to be a competitive landscape. And so you may as well choose like the mega markets to go after.
[00:27:04] Marty Kausas: And that's going to give you like the biggest success of building something big long-term.
[00:27:08] Marty Kausas: Because the worst thing that could happen is we execute perfectly and spend 10 years doing something.
[00:27:12] Marty Kausas: And we were capped from the start. And so we, you know, we were only evaluating basically horizontal
[00:27:18] Marty Kausas: categories at that point. And so, you know, things like sales, marketing, support, payroll, etc.
[00:27:27] Great. It clearly went from the top down math to find the biggest market and then find
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_04: the horizontal nature of the categories to go after that. They said, like support itself has
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_04: already quite a lot of players. There's a nest, there's intercom, there are a lot of AI native
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_04: conversational support bots and systems where Python is really focused on building this
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_04: multi-product cross-functional, more platform style with very, AI native functionalities and features.
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_04: Do you think you have, you had a clear vision on like, this is where you want to go in the beginning?
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_04: Well, what were the moments where you find clarity on there is a big opportunity here?
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_04: Like, this is how we should, you know, cut into sort of the space and have a very,
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_04: I guess, both attentive but also a growable base.
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_04: Right. It was not clear from the beginning.
[00:28:33] Marty Kausas: Well, what we knew is we wanted to be in a really big market so that we could eventually pivot
[00:28:38] Marty Kausas: and grow into something. So we understood that like often people wedge in with something and then
[00:28:41] Marty Kausas: kind of like expand later. And so customer support, like go-to-market systems was generally what
[00:28:47] Marty Kausas: we were wedging into. And so our first actual insight was, hey, within go-to-market, a lot of people
[00:28:54] Marty Kausas: are starting to talk to their customers, over-shared Slack channels, Microsoft Teams, Discord,
[00:28:58] Marty Kausas: WhatsApp, kind of like new conversational tools. And those were for the first time becoming popular,
[00:29:03] Marty Kausas: not just internally within a company, but between them as well. So, for example, one of our
[00:29:08] Marty Kausas: first customers, high touch, they had like 300 shared Slack channels with their customers.
[00:29:13] Marty Kausas: And that was, you know, that was totally different than supporting them over email or like a chat
[00:29:19] Marty Kausas: widget interface or ticket forms. And suddenly they have all these customers speaking there.
[00:29:23] Marty Kausas: They're sending marketing updates there. They're getting product feedback. They're getting support
[00:29:26] Marty Kausas: tickets, but none of it's being tracked. And yeah, you basically can't scale that way, even though
[00:29:32] Marty Kausas: the customers really want it, the vendor really likes it as well. So the insight was, hey,
[00:29:37] Marty Kausas: this is happening. And there's no solution to help people actually work in this way.
[00:29:42] Marty Kausas: So one of the like criteria for an idea for us was like, why now? Why is it compelling to start
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_03: this company right now? If you started two years in the past, something would not, if you think
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_03: about problem companies on like problem solution willingness to pay, either problem was not there
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_03: in the world. So technology for solutions not available two years ago or something. And if you
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_03: started two years in the future, somebody would have beaten you to it. So this like trend when we
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_03: surveyed a bunch of people, felt like a clear change in the way that people approach talking to
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_03: their customers. Plus, you know, shortly after the AI stuff, you feel like you can build a way
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_03: better solution when you have access to conversational data. So it felt like a very opportune way now.
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Now it feels like a default of like when the two parties start to establish commercial
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_04: engagement, the Slack channels are set up first. And then you figure out sort of where it goes
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_04: from there. And also my takeaway is the four deploy engineering phenomenon is actually a very
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_04: huge tailwind for tools like Pylon because you know, the FDE needs to converse with the customers
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_04: very closely. And sort of back and forth, it's very different from in the past. You email TK,
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_04: you get back, like it's very much co-working culture. And Slack and you still need the system to
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_04: manage that. And Pylon many times more often than not, it's the default tool for this.
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_04: I have a question related to this, which is a lot of times the support and very close
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_04: engagement with customers also hides a lot of the technical operational debt for the customers as
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_04: well because if it's a broken on boarding, if it's unclear documentation, usually you can solve it
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_04: by having more conversations. But long term it probably becomes more of a burden. How do you help
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_04: customers navigate that? And is that something, you know, you're very consciously building
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_04: building products to resolve? Or kind of. I mean, a lot of it is like using AI to structure the
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_03: conversational data going on. So a lot of our future set is like drawing insights from that. So
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_03: whether it's like identifying product feedback or common one of the features in the product is
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_03: idea of identifying gaps in your documentation or will cluster all the conversations that we're
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_03: watching, whether they come from like Slack or email or, you know, synchronous stuff from calls
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_03: and cluster them into like topics into topics. And then you can identify the fact that you're missing
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_03: documentation based on those topics or like something's a feature request and say gap in your
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_03: products. So we try to like, yeah, give you tools to like reframing that, yeah, tools to like
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_03: operationalize the way you're doing support to start. But now customer success more forward
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_03: deployed, all these like customer facing roles. How do you like operationalize them? Because also a
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_03: lot of our customers are trying to run lean but do stuff at a bigger and bigger scale. So I think
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_03: if it's into that story as well. Yeah. And one of the really important pieces of context for our
[00:32:22] Marty Kausas: customer base is because we focus on B to B, there's so much context and data about customers everywhere.
[00:32:29] Marty Kausas: And so especially when you think about like all the AI solutions people are building,
[00:32:34] Marty Kausas: if you want to have even like a shot of having like an agent do some piece of work, they need a lot
[00:32:39] Marty Kausas: of context across a lot of different systems. So, you know, our customers will have support teams,
[00:32:45] Marty Kausas: success teams, solutions teams, and all of them kind of have notes or like call recordings or
[00:32:50] Marty Kausas: projects that are kind of stored in these different systems. And because we were building the one
[00:32:55] Marty Kausas: platform that can own all that data and all of those workflows. And frankly, also the place where all
[00:32:59] Marty Kausas: those actual human agents live were able, that's setting us up really well to build a combination of
[00:33:06] Marty Kausas: assistance to make them faster. And then agents to like kind of span all the different functions.
[00:33:11] How do you see AI as a technology impact your roadmap? I believe when you start at Pylon,
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_04: Chaggpt moment hasn't happened yet. Yeah. It was also like my company incorporated on the day
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_03: Chaggpt launch. So, you know, it was seven seven. Oh, yes, yes, you're right. We have the same
[00:33:29] Marty Kausas: birthday at Chaggpt. Yes. We had the initial idea for Pylon, which is what the idea was,
[00:33:34] Marty Kausas: hey, there's a problem with Slack support. So, you know, that's November 21st, I want to say.
[00:33:41] Marty Kausas: One day later, Zandas gets acquired, which is also important context by private equity. So,
[00:33:47] Marty Kausas: one day after we had the initial idea, and then like six or seven days later, Chaggpt comes out.
[00:33:51] Marty Kausas: And so, the timing was incredible. We could not have nailed the timing better. So, we have built
[00:33:58] Marty Kausas: everything like knowing, we have built everything in an AI native way because we knew it existed
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_03: from basically the beginning. So, I think a lot of the, oh, like unlock of having conversational
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_03: data is only powerful because of a lot of that. Yeah, Chaggpt. You think we also took a very
[00:34:12] Advith Chelikani: product first approach there too, because I think a lot of the other people in our batch were just
[00:34:15] Advith Chelikani: throwing AI at the wall and seeing what was stick. But we went to the customers first,
[00:34:19] Advith Chelikani: figured out what the problems were, and just made sure that AI actually was the answer.
[00:34:22] Advith Chelikani: We were very skeptical of AI to begin with, but it ended up being the right answer for a lot of
[00:34:27] Advith Chelikani: the use cases, and that's kind of like a core part of the product, or everywhere in the products.
[00:34:30] Advith Chelikani: And these are not functionalities, like auto resolving like a ticket because the B2B nature
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_04: and the very unique context rich nature of these tickets, it's very much around auto tagging,
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_04: around like context summary, like a ticket summary, like going back to history finding the relevant
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_04: information. Yeah. And what's so cool is like, I mean, man, this was like amazing that we just landed
[00:34:54] Marty Kausas: here with the original problem. Like AdVith already mentioned this, but there's so much conversational
[00:34:59] Marty Kausas: data that previously was totally unstructurable, meaning you could not really build automated workflows
[00:35:05] Marty Kausas: off of this unstructured data. And so now it's like imagine, you know, there's the obvious use case
[00:35:10] Marty Kausas: of hey, like a support question comes in. First off, like many questions come in through support
[00:35:14] Marty Kausas: channels or other channels, and they might not even be support questions, right? So like step one
[00:35:18] Marty Kausas: would be identifying who should this actually get routed to. Is this a piece of product feedback
[00:35:22] Marty Kausas: that we should auto log to linear? Is it something that should be routed to the solutions team
[00:35:25] Marty Kausas: because they're mid migration? Is it something that should be routed to the security team because
[00:35:29] Marty Kausas: it's a question about like their sock too? And so like that's an easy example. Hey, you would come
[00:35:36] Marty Kausas: in the previous workflow would be, hey, we have a bunch of like keywords to like mark priority,
[00:35:40] Marty Kausas: like if they say urgent or like priority or whatever, then like market as high priority. Now we can
[00:35:45] Marty Kausas: use AI to like understand and prompt on top of the question that comes in and then route it to
[00:35:50] Marty Kausas: the right place. Or for example, a lot of our customers are using a product we have called
[00:35:55] Marty Kausas: account intelligence to build signals on top of the customer data. So across the call recordings you
[00:36:00] Marty Kausas: have across the support tickets that come into pile and across like stuff in your CRM, you can
[00:36:05] Marty Kausas: build these signals that tell you, hey, like this customer might be interested in
[00:36:10] Marty Kausas: purchasing like this additional skew that you guys have. Or hey, they're at risk of churn because
[00:36:14] Marty Kausas: they're starting to indicate these things that usually tell us that that are usually like early
[00:36:18] Marty Kausas: signals of a churn risk or hey, they need onboarding help. And so you can take this unstructured
[00:36:22] Marty Kausas: data, structure it into these like signals or like different fields and then you know build
[00:36:27] Marty Kausas: automated workflows off of it. Which is like, and then that doesn't even have to be customer
[00:36:31] Marty Kausas: facing. It could happen internally and just alert the team to help them prioritize accounts better
[00:36:36] Marty Kausas: and take actions faster. Definitely. These are the reasons why many
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_04: in native companies or the more than I guess SaaS companies are using piled-on as a default
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_04: solution from high touch any scale to apply intuition. Many many great logos. Now that you are at the
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_04: spot of at call early product market fit, how do you think about the next three to five years?
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_04: What's the ultimate vision of piled-on? Outside of like being a $100 billion company,
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_04: what are some of the big bets that you need to make today that will influence that outcome?
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_04: I'm curious. What do you guys say for yourself by the way? Like for context on who makes product
[00:37:11] Marty Kausas: decisions, it's these two. I just post on LinkedIn on this point. But Robert and I have this,
[00:37:18] Marty Kausas: yeah, what do you guys product-wise? What's coming? I guess the way I think of it is like we're taking
[00:37:23] Advith Chelikani: a very rippling like strategy. We're trying to get compound started and spin up like several
[00:37:27] Advith Chelikani: different verticals. You already see what the support vertical and the account intelligence
[00:37:30] Advith Chelikani: vertical trying to go after like the customer's success account management persona. It's kind of like
[00:37:34] Advith Chelikani: spinning up what those next verticals are going to be. I think it's a very risky but like high-risk
[00:37:39] Advith Chelikani: high-reward kind of strategy here and I think like we're, we have things in the works I guess.
[00:37:45] Advith Chelikani: And also one thing about like market. So I think a lot of people especially in the AI support
[00:37:50] Marty Kausas: space are going straight to enterprise, which makes sense if you're at it, if you're just doing
[00:37:54] Marty Kausas: like for example transactional ticketing on top of an existing support platform. Because that's
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_04: why I had a high-spawn on love conversations. Exactly. But actually we're like capturing the next
[00:38:02] Marty Kausas: generation of people that are starting now or like growing quickly. So you know the up to like 500
[00:38:07] Marty Kausas: employees generally customer persona. And so we're capturing those people and then teaching them
[00:38:12] Marty Kausas: the pile-on-wave operating. And so they might like onboard with hey like first they use our ticketing
[00:38:17] Marty Kausas: and then it's like hey now we need to understand like the health of our customers and like who to
[00:38:20] Marty Kausas: prioritize. Okay we have a solution for that. Okay we now have like multiple team members who
[00:38:24] Marty Kausas: need context on accounts. Okay we have a solution for that. And so we capture them early. They start
[00:38:29] Marty Kausas: to grow. They start to have these additional problems. And then we start to give them the solutions
[00:38:33] Marty Kausas: that they need that are like the new like AI-native way of operating. That's all in one platform
[00:38:38] Marty Kausas: versus having to go and buy five separate tools. So I think like right now a lot of people call us
[00:38:42] Marty Kausas: like or we call ourselves the Zada we made the sound it's not. We like the we called ourselves for
[00:38:48] Marty Kausas: a long time like the Zendesk killer and it was very focused on just the ticketing aspect. But now
[00:38:53] Marty Kausas: we were like increasingly have all these additional products where they'll be very much a like
[00:38:57] Marty Kausas: hey like pile-on is this like all-in-one tool it's going to have all of our customer operations needs
[00:39:03] Marty Kausas: versus like separately I'd have to like buy Zendesk and like Vydly and like you know all these other
[00:39:08] Marty Kausas: like CS or account management related tools. Gainsite right. A separate AI products like people buy
[00:39:14] Marty Kausas: like five or six tools like it's crazy. And we this is this is one of the things that AI actually
[00:39:19] Marty Kausas: enables is like we as a team just move way way faster than everyone else at this or not faster than
[00:39:24] Marty Kausas: everyone else. But now you can build a company like this that has this product surface area. And so
[00:39:29] Marty Kausas: yeah it's possible for the first time we're like executing super heavily on it with you know a
[00:39:33] Marty Kausas: cracked engineering team. And yeah it I think yeah you're really building an operating system for
[00:39:40] Marty Kausas: companies that are touching customer or all the customer facing teams. Yeah yeah that are having
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_04: conversations and touch points. Yeah and there's because we like control all of the customer data or
[00:39:50] Advith Chelikani: we're attached into where you talk to your customers both on the call recording site and the
[00:39:54] Advith Chelikani: acing support like support ticketing site. So like because we have access to all the data we can do
[00:39:59] Advith Chelikani: everything that flows down from there. And then like set up the verticals I think like in the long
[00:40:02] Advith Chelikani: long term it's kind of going to be around like the future is not just like individual people kind
[00:40:08] Advith Chelikani: of like doing the work that they're doing today. It's probably going to be people orchestrating AI
[00:40:13] Advith Chelikani: agents or something like that. And like how can we be best positioned to kind of like build that next
[00:40:17] Advith Chelikani: layer and like the future of all of these different rules. So way I explain to people is that we
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_03: are trying to smooth curve businesses from like legacy system of record to like some fully
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_03: agentic thing where that's not the state of both people's perception of the technology and the
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_03: technology today. So we're trying to be like the new age system of record system of engagement,
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_03: system of intelligence and then agents doing all your workflow. So for now it's like people
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_03: and agents coexisting within the product and because we got to build it that way from the start
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_03: we can like yeah help people transition to this fully agentic world as everything is ready for that.
[00:40:50] All the other like incumbents are probably going to run into the innovators dilemma where they're
[00:40:53] Advith Chelikani: going to be afraid of like throwing away their product to shift to this new way of doing things.
[00:40:58] Advith Chelikani: But just because we built it from the beginning that way like it'll be much easier for us to like
[00:41:02] Advith Chelikani: it over the dilemma. It's also crazy. I mean surface area wise. I mean you tell us how
[00:41:07] Marty Kausas: impressed were you when you saw what it is incredible large surface of product. Yeah so like I mean
[00:41:13] Marty Kausas: that is a fact. Thanks for rubber and yeah well yeah and it's funny like yeah I remember when we
[00:41:19] Marty Kausas: demoed to you the first time when we were raising our series A. Yeah you in the other part or
[00:41:25] Marty Kausas: the partner who was on the call. You guys were like this we ran out of time to show everything and
[00:41:30] Marty Kausas: that was like a series A. Right with we had probably what like 10 people at the time and like
[00:41:36] Marty Kausas: already the pro like we could not demo everything to you in like a 45 minute call.
[00:41:41] Marty Kausas: And now it's like I mean we're about to so I think we might actually be one of the fastest
[00:41:46] Marty Kausas: moving product teams of all time. Like I'm not kidding like that. It's certainly a monotop that I've
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_04: I've seen. Like I think it's a lot of new future launches which is why you know every day open
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_04: like Dan. It's actually crazy. Like when we think about other companies who have tried to
[00:42:04] Marty Kausas: execute like multi-product strategies. We so we love studying the history of all these companies
[00:42:09] Marty Kausas: that have come before us and like our favorite is Ripley. Ripley is like such a great company
[00:42:13] Marty Kausas: and even then like when I it took them like multiple years to launch like product number two or three
[00:42:19] Marty Kausas: we started building out the ticketing support like support platform at this point like I think
[00:42:25] Marty Kausas: a year and 10 months ago. And we have now built you know the equivalent of Zendes we're we're
[00:42:31] Marty Kausas: like close to building the equivalent of Gainsight. We built you know these AI agent products that
[00:42:35] Marty Kausas: are people's whole companies and like it's been a very short period of time. And so yeah we are
[00:42:41] Marty Kausas: moving I think I think we might be the fastest company ever execute this type of strategy.
[00:42:47] Marty Kausas: And yeah it's so far so far so far so yeah. Yeah.
[00:42:51] Marty Kausas: Last question you're certainly at a point of pushing the boundaries of what's possible
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_04: of also building like a new generation of an native system of record for companies to operate
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_04: on top of when you when there's no data no consensus and no time given your moving very fast to
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_04: make these decisions whose voice do you trust the most.
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_04: It's a customer. It's a customer. Yeah.
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_03: Is it your instincts?
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_04: It's a lot of gut as well but it's informed by like a lot of like being in the weeds still on
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_03: like all the customer calls like both from the sales side and the post sale side so feel like
[00:43:32] I mean the root of it is like a customer what people are saying in the market but I think we apply
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_03: our own layer of like interpretation. Yeah. I will say like Robert and Advert have incredible
[00:43:44] Marty Kausas: product intuition like incredible product and like I mean part of it is like the you know what
[00:43:49] Marty Kausas: if they're in tie. What if they're oh no no so I'll tell you exactly what happens so like we
[00:43:54] Marty Kausas: and by the way I used to be in these debates too and I just kept losing so I gave up but this is how
[00:44:00] Marty Kausas: we solve all problems in the company by debating super heavily and it's like the steel sharpened
[00:44:04] Marty Kausas: steel mentality where it's like okay we know the end goal is build this generational company that
[00:44:08] Marty Kausas: goes public in this period of time that gets a billion in revenue right so like that's what we want
[00:44:12] Marty Kausas: to accomplish and so always when we're debating ideas it's all with that like insight in mind
[00:44:17] Marty Kausas: and so yeah if both whether it's like a business or like strategy discussion we will just like
[00:44:22] Marty Kausas: debate ideas heavily so we'll bring up a thing all three of us will be in a room and then we'll
[00:44:26] Marty Kausas: just like are you for like hours and it's like in fact we use and we used to do it very publicly
[00:44:32] Marty Kausas: within the company so probably up until like 10 people we would just like yell at each other and
[00:44:36] Marty Kausas: it's not like in an angry way it's like in a like we just were so like having so much fun
[00:44:42] Marty Kausas: honestly it's like debating for sport and so you're you're basically just like getting excited
[00:44:47] Marty Kausas: about no like that doesn't make sense because this thing or like oh like we yeah this I yeah we
[00:44:53] Marty Kausas: should take this other strategy and said and it's almost like fun it's just incredibly fun our team
[00:44:59] Marty Kausas: thought we were like in crisis every day because they would hear like us thing in fact we we I
[00:45:04] Marty Kausas: remember we at some point we're like yeah we should probably stuff arguing in front of the rest of
[00:45:08] Marty Kausas: the company so do you still do that or you know now we do it in private people would freak out
[00:45:13] Marty Kausas: like especially the new people who are not used to it or hadn't seen it but we would like get so
[00:45:19] Marty Kausas: passionate about like the different ideas that we wanted to debate and what so what happens is
[00:45:24] Marty Kausas: okay we have a problem we are going to debate the idea extra like very heavily and then and it
[00:45:29] Marty Kausas: might be something so small it might be like there's some like really tiny things that we debate on
[00:45:34] Marty Kausas: but we'll debate it super heavily until we get too tired to make a decision and like if we can't
[00:45:39] Marty Kausas: make it it's if we can't make a decision it means we don't have enough information and if it's
[00:45:43] Marty Kausas: not critical or like priority enough we have to push it otherwise you know we debate until we kind
[00:45:49] Marty Kausas: of like all arrive at the same conclusion and if we don't arrive at this it's rare I think that we
[00:45:53] Marty Kausas: don't arrive at the same end conclusion because at that point we've like explored every outcome of like
[00:45:59] Marty Kausas: where each decision could take us and it yeah it's a very fun and exhausting process
[00:46:05] Marty Kausas: sounds very intense yeah and so it's super high intensity I think like I don't know if other
[00:46:09] Marty Kausas: teams do it to the same level that we do but it's yeah it's it's very fun it's I think like you have
[00:46:15] Marty Kausas: to love it this is very much like a like sport almost in itself so awesome cool where at time it's
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_04: so wonderful having the throw for you I feel like we need a part two for this conversation
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_04: thank you so much for taking the time thank you
