[00:00:00] itself, funding itself, sustaining it, grows as we grow. It's unbelievably capital-efficient.
[00:00:05] Brett Kelly: It's like, why don't we just drive earnings and drive reinvestment in a disciplined way to
[00:00:10] Brett Kelly: build that flywheel over time? And that's what's happening. So, the 51.49, a 10-year commitment,
[00:00:15] Brett Kelly: we've got 95 equity partners who've made that commitment. And 9% of the revenue being consistently
[00:00:19] Brett Kelly: reinvested in that structure, it is entirely unique in the entire world and it is extraordinarily
[00:00:26] Brett Kelly: powerful, I've had time. So, for those in the audience who don't yet know Brett, he's the founder and
[00:00:35] Clay (Host): CEO of Kelly Partners Group. He started the business back in 2006 and it's been quite a successful
[00:00:42] Clay (Host): company over the years and Brett seems to have a really interesting background that I wanted to
[00:00:47] Clay (Host): learn more about alongside the audience. And I'll note that from 2007 through 2023,
[00:00:53] Clay (Host): Kelly Partners has had a revenue growth rate of 31% per year and he also created significant
[00:01:00] Clay (Host): amounts of shareholder value over that time period. And we're going to be getting to Kelly Partners.
[00:01:05] Clay (Host): But I wanted to start by talking about Brett first. And I'll also mention just a full disclaimer
[00:01:11] Clay (Host): that I do not own shares in Kelly Partners Group, at least at the time of this recording.
[00:01:15] Clay (Host): And I just wanted to make that fully known to the audience before we dive in here and dive into
[00:01:20] Clay (Host): Brett's background and dive into KPG. Before we talk about Kelly Partners specifically,
[00:01:27] Clay (Host): when I discovered your work and dug into your background, I found that you have a very similar
[00:01:32] Clay (Host): passion and interest to me and many of the people here at TIP and many in our audience. And that's
[00:01:38] Clay (Host): studying what successful people have done and figuring out how you can take those lessons
[00:01:42] Clay (Host): and implement them into your own life. So, talk more about that journey and how that started
[00:01:48] Clay (Host): for you and how that led you to starting Kelly Partners.
[00:01:53] So Clay, it's a really great observation. I was with a mentor of mine yesterday,
[00:01:59] Brett Kelly: who now is $64 worth about $4 billion. And he just said the things that so many people have
[00:02:09] Brett Kelly: said to me over the years. And that is that from a $25 book, you can learn hundreds of years of
[00:02:15] Brett Kelly: wisdom and certainly decades of business experience. And that if you just humble enough to take
[00:02:22] Brett Kelly: the lessons of the greats and apply them without ego and without revision, then so often they will
[00:02:29] Brett Kelly: move you forward. Now, they may not be the answer in full to every question because things change
[00:02:35] Brett Kelly: and we need to stay front footed and dynamic. But they get you 80% down the track in almost all situations.
[00:02:45] Brett Kelly: And so as a very young person, I was lucky in a sense that I was the kid that came first in everything.
[00:02:54] Brett Kelly: I have seven brothers, middle of eight boys. So you grow up pretty self-reliant because otherwise
[00:03:00] Brett Kelly: you starve. And then my father had a business. He was recommended and accountant by his auditors.
[00:03:09] Brett Kelly: That account turned out to be a gambler who embezzled money at damage. The business, I saw the
[00:03:14] Brett Kelly: impact on my father of that. Instead of going and studying law, I decided to study accounting
[00:03:19] Brett Kelly: because it's the language of business. And I went into price waterhouses and undergrad when I
[00:03:26] Brett Kelly: really could have done anything. But I think God, I did that because I got to see the very young age,
[00:03:32] Brett Kelly: fantastic businesses up close and personal. I did four and a half years there. I went to an investment
[00:03:37] Brett Kelly: bank and I lost my job. I was told that I didn't fit in with other people, which was true.
[00:03:43] Brett Kelly: I had worked with a senior director and a senior manager and I never forget him commenting on a
[00:03:52] Brett Kelly: multi-billionaire client that he was just a green grocer. And that green grocer was one of Australia's
[00:03:58] Brett Kelly: most successful business people ever. And I remember that comment hitting me so clearly that
[00:04:04] Brett Kelly: I was there in this investment bank wanting to learn from the clients. And yet the self-centred
[00:04:10] Brett Kelly: arrogance of the person I was working with, not the senior directors, but the people I had to
[00:04:15] Brett Kelly: work in with was horrible. And I just didn't share their values. And so when I lost my job and that
[00:04:22] Brett Kelly: comment was made, I thought it was really true. I was lucky. I was given out placement services
[00:04:29] Brett Kelly: at a group called Morgan and Banks, a very successful human resources group. And there was a
[00:04:33] Brett Kelly: clinical psychologist. And she met with me and said, Brett, how do you feel about this? And I said,
[00:04:38] Brett Kelly: well, I don't, you know, I think it's true. I don't think I fit in with that type of person.
[00:04:44] Brett Kelly: And so now I'm not really sure what I want to do. But I do feel great relief that now I've done
[00:04:50] Brett Kelly: everything everyone told me to do. I've done the degrees and got the jobs and whatever. But my
[00:04:56] Brett Kelly: values aren't money, status and power. And so I don't feel like I know what I'm meant to do. I went
[00:05:04] Brett Kelly: home. My dad was my greatest supporter. He's dead now. But a wonderful guy. He'd come to Australia.
[00:05:10] Brett Kelly: You know, he'd been left school at 13 worked as a as a helper in a five star hotel where he said,
[00:05:17] Brett Kelly: you know, he was trained to set tables and iron and he said, you know, like, but what I was taught,
[00:05:22] Brett Kelly: Brett was that, you know, you need to be able to deal equally well with kings and porpers and
[00:05:27] Brett Kelly: everyone in between and treat them well. And so he then went into British Navy, ended up in
[00:05:32] Brett Kelly: Australia with, you know, five pound POM. And he, you know, built his business and he was just
[00:05:39] Brett Kelly: great with people. He was always an encouraging person. But he gave me two books. One was called
[00:05:43] Brett Kelly: How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie and the other one was called Think and Grow
[00:05:47] Brett Kelly: Rich. And, you know, in all of the academic study I'd done, there was not a single class on working
[00:05:53] Brett Kelly: with people. And this book turned it talked about how important it is to be very good with people.
[00:05:59] Brett Kelly: Now I'd capped in every sporting team and debating teams and all sorts of things.
[00:06:04] But the emphasis on working well with people and putting yourself in other people's shoes and
[00:06:09] Brett Kelly: genuinely focusing on how to make other people better off and knowing that the more people you
[00:06:13] Brett Kelly: helped achieve their goals made it much more likely that you would achieve yours was a huge
[00:06:19] Brett Kelly: paradigm shift from, you know, as a self-centred to another person centered dynamic, which I look
[00:06:27] Brett Kelly: genuinely by nature, I believe I had and that's why I didn't feel I fitted in in these other
[00:06:32] Brett Kelly: situations. But the other book, Think and Grow Rich was great because it talked about
[00:06:37] Brett Kelly: find people that have been successful and ask them what it was that made them successful.
[00:06:42] Now I had no idea at this point what I wanted to do. I was very disenchanted with what I'd seen
[00:06:47] Brett Kelly: commercially and I hadn't found what I came later to think of as a mission-based organization.
[00:06:54] Brett Kelly: Something bigger than the sort of ego's of the people involved. And so I loved the book and
[00:07:00] Brett Kelly: I was like, okay, I went back to this out placement service. I got this little book called
[00:07:04] Brett Kelly: The Who's Who of Australia? It was a little red book and I just wrote a list of 80 prominent
[00:07:09] Brett Kelly: Australians. I'd love to meet if I could meet anyone. And they were from the politicians to the
[00:07:13] Brett Kelly: religious leaders to academics to sporting heroes, billionaires, the whole lot. And I basically
[00:07:22] Brett Kelly: made this list of 80 people I'd love to meet. And I thought if I could meet them, I could ask them,
[00:07:26] Brett Kelly: well, what is it really like to be the prime minister? What does it really like to be a business
[00:07:31] Brett Kelly: titan? What is it really like to be the leader of a major religion? What is it really like to be
[00:07:35] Brett Kelly: in academia or the best sporting hero? I was a kid. I just didn't know what I wanted to do. So
[00:07:42] Brett Kelly: I wrote this letter. Dear Mr. Hawke, former Australian Prime Minister, my name is Brett Kelly. I'm
[00:07:47] Brett Kelly: 22. I'm unemployed, but I'm keen to learn. If you're prepared to spend one hour answering my 11
[00:07:53] Brett Kelly: standard questions, I would be very pleased to interview your face to face, collater book,
[00:07:58] Brett Kelly: and put that book to out to other young Australians who are keen to learn. And surprisingly,
[00:08:03] Brett Kelly: if you make 5,000 phone calls over three months and you learn how to make phone calls,
[00:08:10] Brett Kelly: I got 34 of those 80 prominent Australians to meet with me in a 12 week period. Turn that into
[00:08:15] Brett Kelly: 800,000 words in four leveraged files. I had initially gone to three major publishers. They said
[00:08:23] Brett Kelly: you won't get the people. I then went back to them and said, look, I've got the stuff. What do I do now?
[00:08:28] Brett Kelly: And they said, well, you're not Ray Martin or Philip Adams, which is say, Larry King or Howard Stern.
[00:08:36] Brett Kelly: So who's going to read your book? There are 800 new books released every week. And most of them
[00:08:43] Brett Kelly: lose money. So how's your book going to stand out? And I said, well, if you're 22, you're unemployed
[00:08:47] Brett Kelly: and you write a book instead of feeling sorry for yourself. Maybe there's an audience that are
[00:08:52] Brett Kelly: interested in that. And that became this book. And it's a beast. It's really something quite
[00:08:58] Brett Kelly: special that I realize now. I'm 49 at 22. It was just, you know, what you do when you're desperate
[00:09:06] Brett Kelly: to learn and don't know what to do with your life. And so that's what happened. I made the phone
[00:09:12] Brett Kelly: calls. I basically persistently put myself in a position to find these people to talk to me.
[00:09:20] Brett Kelly: I would track them down to art gallery openings or things that they were speaking to. I'd stand
[00:09:24] Brett Kelly: outside and try and get them to talk to me. And basically, Carral, everyone into the book,
[00:09:31] Brett Kelly: when I couldn't get a major publisher to take the book on, I found Mark Victor Hanson and Jack
[00:09:38] Brett Kelly: Canfield and there to American Lads who had written the chicken soup for the sole series and
[00:09:45] Brett Kelly: they'd sold 500 million books. And they had made a 24 cassette tape series on how to publish a best
[00:09:52] Brett Kelly: selling book with a workbook. And so I bought that from the US. It cost me $1,200 in 1997.
[00:09:59] Brett Kelly: Dollars were a huge amount of money. I'd bought at this time the Simon and Schuster Self-Hell
[00:10:05] Brett Kelly: tape catalog every tape that they'd published about 2,000 tapes. I bought a bookshelf and put
[00:10:10] Brett Kelly: them all in there. And while I was sitting in my garage with my phone line that I'd put in making
[00:10:14] Brett Kelly: these calls, I would just listen to these tapes. And I attribute that as really changing my mindset
[00:10:20] Brett Kelly: and broadening and deepening my understanding of sort of life and people. I later learned through
[00:10:26] Brett Kelly: the Gallup Strengths test that my number one strength is learning. And I didn't realize that
[00:10:34] Brett Kelly: that was really what gave me energy. And so that was that exercise. I was very lucky that I had read
[00:10:41] Brett Kelly: Philip Fisher's book. First book I read on the stock market of common stocks and common profits
[00:10:46] Brett Kelly: at Pricewaterhouse. I had joined an EVA group and I'd read this book
[00:10:53] Brett Kelly: Creating Sharehold of Value which is still in my death this morning but I offered Raffa Paul
[00:10:57] Brett Kelly: to book a few people of red but it's a wonderful book. And that had led me to Warren Buffett
[00:11:03] Brett Kelly: and Charlie Munger. And so I'd been reading all of their newsletters. Let's send them to you if you
[00:11:09] Brett Kelly: asked in these doggie-o binded editions. And you know I was working in this investment bank at the
[00:11:17] Brett Kelly: time. I lost my job. I'd read the Warren Buffett way which is wonderful book by Robert Hagstrom.
[00:11:22] Brett Kelly: And I realized that in Australia nobody knew who Warren Buffett was. I never forget being in this
[00:11:27] Brett Kelly: investment bank. And one of my colleagues saw the book in my bag and they said, why do you read
[00:11:32] Brett Kelly: books like that about people who you know are talking about how to make money when they're just
[00:11:38] Brett Kelly: trying to sell books to make money. And I said do you know who Warren Buffett is? And this person
[00:11:44] Brett Kelly: said to me, no, I don't know who Warren Buffett is. And that was another situation in this
[00:11:50] Brett Kelly: investment bank where I thought I'm in the wrong place. I give you don't know who Warren Buffett
[00:11:54] Brett Kelly: is and you're in investment banking. I'm just in the wrong place. I came to learn later clay
[00:12:00] Brett Kelly: that in professional services our industry a one thing you can't find is professional service.
[00:12:06] Brett Kelly: And in investment banking the one thing you can't find is a banker that invests because they're so
[00:12:12] Brett Kelly: transactional. And so that's what happened. So I'm young. I go back into chartered accounting. So
[00:12:19] Brett Kelly: you know I do the books. A few hundred professional speaking engagements where they paid me. I
[00:12:24] Brett Kelly: realized that was personal exertion. I went back into chartered accounting. Finish my CA program.
[00:12:30] Brett Kelly: Did my master's got my tax agent went through three firms hoping to become an equity partner.
[00:12:37] Brett Kelly: At first I thought that the partners in these firms were just duplicitous and hopeless.
[00:12:45] Brett Kelly: But I came to learn later that they were in fact the operators of small businesses. And as
[00:12:51] Brett Kelly: operators of small businesses trying to look after the business look after the clients and
[00:12:55] Brett Kelly: live they were too busy. And so as a young guy when he said hey boss how do I become a partner.
[00:13:01] Brett Kelly: They didn't have a system. They didn't have a letter. They didn't have time to run the business.
[00:13:07] Brett Kelly: And so three times in a row I'd been told what yeah we'll make your part if you do this. I did that.
[00:13:13] Brett Kelly: They then said oh sorry we got that wrong. We need to have waited a bit longer or something.
[00:13:19] Brett Kelly: And eventually a friend of mine in March 2006 got everyone said hey Brad I'm in this bad
[00:13:25] Brett Kelly: partnership. Can you help me get out. You have 75% I'll have 25. You run the business or
[00:13:33] Brett Kelly: run the clients. Now I'd worked with Scott for three years about four years before that.
[00:13:38] And I guess what I love your audience to understand is that often who you are is more obvious to
[00:13:46] Brett Kelly: other people as a young person than it is to you. And so my mate my very good mate saw in me that I
[00:13:54] Brett Kelly: really understood business that I had a huge passion for it that as a combination would be
[00:14:00] Brett Kelly: much better off than we would as individuals. And he encouraged me to help him set a firm up for
[00:14:06] Brett Kelly: him. You know I really understood that because I self published this book made it a number one
[00:14:11] Brett Kelly: bit seller. I sort of understood a lot of things accountants don't understand. So I raised the
[00:14:16] Brett Kelly: money to you know I got the people in the book. I put the team together that published the book.
[00:14:21] Brett Kelly: I raised the money to print the book. I sold the books. I did all the PR I did all of professional
[00:14:26] Brett Kelly: speaking and I had to learn how to sell a product. And then I went back into accounting where no one
[00:14:32] Brett Kelly: really knows any of that because they don't have that experience. And so that's sort of in March 2006
[00:14:39] Brett Kelly: I started Scotty Oldland and Co with Scott. And then three months later my boss had promised one
[00:14:44] Brett Kelly: thing and you know promised the world and delivered an atlas. And so two of my colleagues said couldn't
[00:14:50] Brett Kelly: you start a firm for us like you've started for Scott. And I was pretty annoyed at this point to
[00:14:58] Brett Kelly: be gentle. And I said to my wife you know this industry is hopeless. These people are just dishonest.
[00:15:05] Brett Kelly: I don't want a bar of it. And she's like yeah but Brett my wife Rebecca is an accountant and
[00:15:12] Brett Kelly: said but Brett you know we've got to know my adult child at this point. You're so good at it.
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_03: Why don't you just build a firm for them? And I'm like oh so I can sit on myself like the reluctant
[00:15:25] Brett Kelly: co-founder with Beck. We didn't have many options my boss had said well Brett if you don't like this
[00:15:30] Brett Kelly: offer you can always go across the street and you know see how you go but you'll need the cash flow.
[00:15:36] Brett Kelly: Now I'm not the sort of person you say that type of thing too. So I did I went across the street
[00:15:44] Brett Kelly: and I came up with this idea of fixed fees for clients where they paid you 50% up front so
[00:15:50] Brett Kelly: that fixed the cash flow. We invested $50,000 I had 200,000 of Billings and we built that our run rate
[00:15:58] Brett Kelly: revenues about 120 million. I've always considered myself an investor first. I've compounded my own
[00:16:05] Brett Kelly: capital at 60% a year for 18 years in a row. And I've done that because I've read everything that
[00:16:12] Brett Kelly: Warren Buffett ever wrote. I've read everything that Charlie Munger ever wrote. I followed that
[00:16:16] Brett Kelly: seam of wisdom from Ben Graham. I really feel it fished a Ben Graham with Charlie Munger to
[00:16:22] Brett Kelly: to Warren Buffett all the way through to anyone that I can meet that knows anything about anything.
[00:16:29] Brett Kelly: If you teach me anything it goes into my mind and into my notes and your contact details
[00:16:35] Brett Kelly: will go into my phone and I'll do everything I can to try and execute on the wisdom that people
[00:16:42] Brett Kelly: share with me. So it isn't an accident that the four books I've written from the first one.
[00:16:48] Brett Kelly: A series of books based on wisdom which is deep understanding because I came to learn as I got
[00:16:54] Brett Kelly: older that that's the thing that really gives me energy and that really you know drives me forward.
[00:17:00] Yeah thank you for that very inspiring story. One thing that stuck out to me there was
[00:17:05] Clay (Host): your skills are a lot more obvious to other people than they are to you. And I wonder if that's
[00:17:12] Clay (Host): what holds some people back that sort of impostor syndrome or that blindness to what it is we're
[00:17:20] Clay (Host): actually good at ourselves or what makes us stand out from the crowd. Yeah I think in recruiting
[00:17:26] Brett Kelly: in terms of some practical help for people listening I always ask people who come for an interview
[00:17:32] Brett Kelly: as an accountant. Do you do bookkeeping for anyone? And they go yeah I do my mom, my dad, the
[00:17:38] Brett Kelly: barber down the road etc during university or college. Often when I say to them I say you have
[00:17:46] Brett Kelly: 12 clients bookkeeping clients. Oh yeah yeah I do that must spare time. People are seeing in that
[00:17:52] Brett Kelly: person that they're a really good bookkeeper and they ask them. You know we had a team member who
[00:17:59] Brett Kelly: wrote a lot on stocks and he said Brett you know give me a pay rise. I said I'm not giving your pay
[00:18:04] Brett Kelly: rise because well then I'll leave. I hope you do and spend more time writing on stocks because
[00:18:11] Brett Kelly: your great passion is writing on stocks and investing. It's not accounting. And so seeing the
[00:18:18] Brett Kelly: thing that you naturally gravitate to when you know when you're not being paid in your spare time
[00:18:26] Brett Kelly: if you try to find me on a Saturday I don't work on Sundays but I do read on Sundays I don't
[00:18:32] Brett Kelly: consider that work. I will have a book in my head. I will be doing our business. I would rather
[00:18:39] Brett Kelly: talk to somebody about their accounting firm or their career or what they're doing in our business
[00:18:44] Brett Kelly: or how they can join our group then I would play golf or do anything else. And so once you know
[00:18:50] Brett Kelly: you're so better you know you're in a much better position and you can find that by asking
[00:18:55] Brett Kelly: out of people hey what do you see me as being good at you know if you've had to give me a million
[00:19:00] Brett Kelly: dollars to do something from what would that thing be or nothing yeah yeah you have to give me a
[00:19:04] Brett Kelly: million to do one thing what if you say and that you know that's I think a big part of the process
[00:19:10] Brett Kelly: of sort of growing up. During our previous call one-on-one privately you spoke very highly of one
[00:19:19] Clay (Host): person in particular and that was Bernard or no we beat the drum constantly on the show on
[00:19:25] Clay (Host): Munger Buffett and a lot of the other investing grades but Bernard is probably a much less
[00:19:34] Clay (Host): undiscovered relatives as some of these other multi-billionaires. He's actually one of the
[00:19:39] Clay (Host): wealthiest if not the wealthiest person in the world I believe his net worth is around 230 billion
[00:19:46] Clay (Host): at the time of recording and he's the CEO of LVMH which has a market cap north of 450 billion
[00:19:53] Clay (Host): just a massive massive company. I was curious if you could share the story of how you managed to
[00:20:00] Clay (Host): meet him and why you admire him so much. Yeah so Clay I have some heroes and often people will say
[00:20:10] Brett Kelly: they'll hear me speak about Buffett you know in reverential terms but not really here because they
[00:20:17] Brett Kelly: don't know these other people my great heroes Bernard are no one David Oglevey followed by Warren
[00:20:24] Brett Kelly: Buffett and Charlie Munger and Mark Leonard of Constellation Software and all for different reasons
[00:20:31] Brett Kelly: I while I consider myself an investor CEO the people that I most admire are no one Oglevey
[00:20:39] Brett Kelly: because they built and operated operating businesses but with an investor's mindset and with
[00:20:46] Brett Kelly: a big vision of what was possible and they prosecuted that vision relentlessly over multiple decades
[00:20:54] Brett Kelly: and I think they reshapes or reimagined and then reshape the industries within which they
[00:21:02] Brett Kelly: operate and so when David Oglevey built Oglevey nobody thought you could build a global advertising
[00:21:08] Brett Kelly: agency and when I know Bill Elvier-Match nobody thought that you could build a global luxury conglomerate
[00:21:17] Brett Kelly: now similarly as Warren Buffett built Berkshire with a unique structure and mindset and outlook
[00:21:23] Brett Kelly: and methodology nobody thought you could do that and every five years he gets bagged and he's
[00:21:27] Brett Kelly: done it relentlessly for 50 plus years so here with Charlie obviously cute heroes and similarly
[00:21:32] Brett Kelly: with Mark Leonard so you know Will Thorn Dykes great book The Outsiders talks about how different
[00:21:38] Brett Kelly: these outside of CEOs are idiosyncratic and similarly when Mark Leonard starts buying these
[00:21:44] Brett Kelly: little software companies everyone thinks he's crazy and most people do they think it crazy and
[00:21:49] Brett Kelly: you know until you're Elon Musk type of thing that they still think you're crazy but um
[00:21:54] but all these people like Musk for example I'm going to make electric cars that's crazy and off
[00:21:58] Brett Kelly: your guys I'm going to build rockets and you know it's crazy until it isn't but Bernadonna holds
[00:22:03] Brett Kelly: a special place in my heart I think the luxury businesses are the greatest businesses in the world
[00:22:08] Brett Kelly: meaning that they're likely to to last hundreds of years the demand for um you know the
[00:22:16] Brett Kelly: desirability of handmade high quality things that are special at the last generations I think
[00:22:21] Brett Kelly: speaks to something in people's DNA those things do not need to be expensive you know I'm surrounded by
[00:22:27] Brett Kelly: little things like a handmade you know um coffee cup from Italy that I just love and it would
[00:22:35] Brett Kelly: have cost nothing much but it's so special because it speaks to a time and a place and a memory
[00:22:41] Brett Kelly: and so I really wanted to meet Bernad I'd read so much about him I had read everything that
[00:22:47] Brett Kelly: it exists in English and I'd had things translated from the French to to be able to read I think
[00:22:53] Brett Kelly: you know most people really only know their own market if you're American you don't look outside
[00:22:58] Brett Kelly: America Australian I don't care I've always had this global perspective for some reason I think
[00:23:02] Brett Kelly: it's because my dad had traveled so much and it wasn't migrant from England and so I just always
[00:23:08] Brett Kelly: had a view that the world was bigger than the suburb I lived in but I find Bernadonna I know many
[00:23:13] Brett Kelly: years back now and I just um through my books you know for example I wrote to Warren Buffett in 2006
[00:23:21] Brett Kelly: I sent him Robert Hanks from Spok I said I'd you know I'd read it changed my life you wrote back to
[00:23:25] Brett Kelly: me and signed my book and sent it back in the reply page in below and so I always feel like if you
[00:23:32] Brett Kelly: can get near somebody you get to feel their energy and you get a sense that that people as well
[00:23:39] Brett Kelly: now that doesn't mean that they're just people like you and I because I don't think that's true
[00:23:46] Brett Kelly: but they are people and and they have built themselves from the inside out to become
[00:23:53] Brett Kelly: the full fullest version of themselves over a lifetime and I just have a tremendous respect for
[00:24:00] Brett Kelly: that not just in business through my first book just in life you know if you will make the effort
[00:24:06] Brett Kelly: to build yourself inside out into the best you can be for others for the benefit of other people
[00:24:13] Brett Kelly: um then I think that's the full um imagining of the human experience and and so to me that's
[00:24:22] Brett Kelly: really profound so I read everything I can and then I'm like I've really got to meet this guy how am I
[00:24:26] Brett Kelly: going to do that so I found the local um Christian Deore store and anyone that knows anything about
[00:24:34] Brett Kelly: Bernadonna knows that his favorite business is Christian Deore that's his great love of
[00:24:42] Brett Kelly: you know of all of his businesses and so having discovered that I read everything I could find
[00:24:48] Brett Kelly: on Christian Deore I have every original book that Christian Deore himself published and when I
[00:24:54] Brett Kelly: read I read with a pen and a ruler and I underline highlight color and mark up a book it's
[00:25:02] Brett Kelly: a studying effort not a reading effort and um so I do this so I find the general manager of Christian
[00:25:08] Brett Kelly: Deore and Sydney I go and meet him tell him I have to meet him um you can tell from my first book
[00:25:14] Brett Kelly: at 22 I've got a habit of finding people and um you know I meet him and just with I'm an enthusiast
[00:25:22] Brett Kelly: so with my enthusiasm I say hey this is the greatest business in the world like you know
[00:25:27] Brett Kelly: Christian starts this and then he does this and he does a new look and he does that and it's
[00:25:31] Brett Kelly: just this and it's that and it's amazing you know how do I get to meet mr. Rano
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_03: and he's like well Brad that's not that easy I said yeah I know life's hard but how can we make
[00:25:43] Brett Kelly: that happen and he goes well I've never met anyone that knows more about this business than you
[00:25:50] I said well that's a great compliment he goes how do you know all this and he starts asking me
[00:25:54] Brett Kelly: questions I said because I just think this is an incredible business I think the story is incredible
[00:25:59] Brett Kelly: you know and so I've studied it so he thought that was a music I don't actually took my books with me
[00:26:05] Brett Kelly: and um in my roller bag my Kelly Panty's roller bag I pulled out all these books and I was
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_03: oh and he said you know okay I think I can organize that so I went downstairs I took my wife back
[00:26:16] Brett Kelly: a week later I spent a lot of money on on some dresses um for her and I love beautiful
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_03: dresses for my wife and then this gentleman said look Brad I'm you know I'd love to send you to
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_03: Paris for the kutur show which is the only show that mr. Rano definitely attends each year
[00:26:37] Brett Kelly: and you know we'll put you on back up and the kids and and you can go to the show and one of the
[00:26:43] Brett Kelly: great life experiences I got to go to the show I was introduced to mr. Rano I got to meet him for
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_03: a minute and a half two minutes got enough to get near him and speak to him um might have been
[00:26:58] longer than that felt like an hour but what was so great was I got to sense you know he's very tall
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_03: very lean guy very impurious demeanor um you could feel a sort of intellect and strength of
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_03: character from 20 yards there's a great life experience and so you know you walk away my wife
[00:27:19] Brett Kelly: is like Brad you cannot ask him for a selfie I have very few regrets in life claim that that's
[00:27:24] Brett Kelly: one of them he's like don't you dare ask him for a selfie that was like okay so well by Hayes
[00:27:31] Brett Kelly: which I regret um but look as a great life experience I'm often asked you know if I've tried to
[00:27:37] Brett Kelly: meet Warren and I've said no because I feel like he's taught me so much that in the in the moments
[00:27:44] Brett Kelly: that he has left to live there's no way that I could possibly justify to myself that asking him
[00:27:50] Brett Kelly: to spend five minutes with me is the best investment of the time that he's got left um but in
[00:27:56] Brett Kelly: mr. Rano's case I have believes a lot longer and you know than extraordinarily special experience
[00:28:03] Brett Kelly: and so that's you know if I guess part of my nature is that when people ask us about the business
[00:28:10] Brett Kelly: I say well you know if you ask me about our marketing I think
[00:28:14] Brett Kelly: Apple's the best marketing organization in the world with them is and so I mark out marketing
[00:28:22] Brett Kelly: efforts versus theirs so we're currently about 1.5 out of 10 um and so I heard the other day on
[00:28:30] Brett Kelly: the founders podcast um an episode on David Ogleby again which I love with David Senor said you
[00:28:35] Brett Kelly: know divine discontent is the antidote just smugness and so I was born with that discontent which
[00:28:41] Brett Kelly: is helpful and then we try to communicate that you know if you're aimed for the stars and
[00:28:45] Brett Kelly: pool short probably land on the moon well I first really started learning about a lot about you
[00:28:53] Clay (Host): and your company when a member of our mastermind community did a presentation on the company because
[00:28:59] Clay (Host): he held it and it's fun and was kind enough to share with the overall group and I just loved
[00:29:05] Clay (Host): one of the comments he made in that presentation and I thought it was really interesting he he called
[00:29:11] Clay (Host): the dot connector I don't know if he he came up with that phrase or if he pulled it from somewhere
[00:29:16] Clay (Host): else but you know it ties into that that first question we brought today where you know you've
[00:29:22] Clay (Host): looked at a Berkshire Hathaway for example using a whole co-model and using decentralization and
[00:29:28] Clay (Host): focusing on capital allocation and you look at LVMH and centralizing certain aspects of the
[00:29:34] Clay (Host): business but leaving some of the roots to the individual businesses and then constellation
[00:29:40] Clay (Host): software these programmatic acquisitions and then get also Ty and Walmart and McDonald's but uh
[00:29:46] Clay (Host): so that is the game like like that's you know Charlie Munger has his phrase and I think it's a name
[00:29:53] Brett Kelly: or a title of one of the books that investing is the last liberal art and so the ability to take
[00:29:59] Brett Kelly: ideas from different places and understand how they fit together Michael Porter at Harvard says
[00:30:05] Brett Kelly: that the only way to create competitive advantage today is through the unique combination of
[00:30:11] Brett Kelly: ideas and activities so the ideas the activities that flow from those ideas and so the ability to think
[00:30:18] Brett Kelly: through you know Kelly Partners group holdings is a whole co if people look at the font it's the font
[00:30:24] Brett Kelly: in the logo of Berkshire but if they look at the type setting of it it's got KP with a plus in the
[00:30:30] Brett Kelly: middle and G H which is a nod to LVMH which is means it's a secondary brand not a primary brand
[00:30:37] Brett Kelly: because Kelly Partners accountants is the primary brand to the market but KP G H is a primary brand to
[00:30:43] Brett Kelly: investors and and for people us to sort of see that if they think about the way that we've
[00:30:49] Brett Kelly: thought about decentralization and capital allocation that's straight from Graham Buffett Munger the
[00:30:55] Brett Kelly: operating investment thesis is Alfred Rappapore by assets where you can earn a return above the
[00:31:03] Brett Kelly: weighted average cost of capital the way we think about the valuation of the group comes from
[00:31:07] Brett Kelly: Higgs from two stage dividend discount model the way that we think about programmatic acquisition
[00:31:13] Brett Kelly: comes from the research of McKinsey than the behavior of of Arno and of Mark Leonard Arno buys
[00:31:22] Brett Kelly: clapped out 100 year old brands and from the inside out reenergizes and reimagines the depth and
[00:31:31] Brett Kelly: breadth of of those organizations and then David Oglevey had this vision of of services organization
[00:31:37] Brett Kelly: and advertising agency as a services organization and what it tipped me off to him was Warren Buffett
[00:31:43] Brett Kelly: who'd invested in Young and Rubikam 30 years ago but he'd also invested in Achenart Block
[00:31:48] Brett Kelly: via counting group so if you take that that web of ideas you know I don't expect that any of your
[00:31:56] Brett Kelly: listeners are going to hear anything from me today that's particularly unique I've got the odd
[00:32:00] Brett Kelly: turn of phrase the odd saying that that is unique but you know what I've learned I've learned from
[00:32:07] Brett Kelly: other people I have a book behind me Michael Hill Jouler's tough on up he wrote a book that I read
[00:32:12] Brett Kelly: in 2009 we listed in 2017 it said make sure when you list you hold a controlling interest in the
[00:32:19] Brett Kelly: group so wherever I can learn from I heard the same thing from John Malone right I'm just trying
[00:32:27] Brett Kelly: to build out a lattice work of ideas and then relentlessly execute so in light of learning all
[00:32:37] Clay (Host): these learning from all these wonderful people talk to us about the Kelly Partners Group
[00:32:43] Clay (Host): business model for those that aren't familiar in the audience yeah so what I'd learn Clay is
[00:32:49] Brett Kelly: up when Bill Gates and Warren Buffett were asked together what is the thing that makes the most
[00:32:53] Brett Kelly: difference in business they answered in unison focus I'd read it a very old 1800s sermon
[00:33:01] Brett Kelly: took that was diamonds under your feet and what that sermon said is that so often people are
[00:33:06] Brett Kelly: looking you know it's a somewhere else to to make a difference but where they are standing is where
[00:33:11] Brett Kelly: they're meant to make a difference and so I'm in the the tax and accounting industry they are
[00:33:16] Brett Kelly: incredible businesses Buffett death and taxes life's great service you can look at 20 years and you
[00:33:21] Brett Kelly: know that you're going to be asked to pay more tax than you were last year because the political class
[00:33:27] Brett Kelly: don't want to go to work and they want your money so I felt that it met the Buffett criteria as a
[00:33:32] Brett Kelly: business that wasn't going to disappear it met a personal criteria that I felt that accounts
[00:33:38] Brett Kelly: given what had happened to my dad could make a huge difference if they wanted to where they were
[00:33:43] Brett Kelly: and then I looked at the businesses themselves I knew the McDonald's business very well and I said
[00:33:48] Brett Kelly: these businesses are great businesses but they're poorly operated my friends got it said Brett your
[00:33:53] Brett Kelly: great at business I'm greater being accountant couldn't you help me run the business and I'll do
[00:33:58] Brett Kelly: the accounting and so as you put all those ideas together I said right I why don't we build the
[00:34:04] Brett Kelly: world's best accounting firm for private business owners two to ten million I'll do you know I
[00:34:10] Brett Kelly: then go to the best people so I'm going to have the best people proposition going to be like
[00:34:15] Brett Kelly: Disney the people want to put on strange outfits and go and volunteer there work for free to help
[00:34:19] Brett Kelly: people find the toilets and so it's got to have a great people offer it's got to have great systems
[00:34:24] Brett Kelly: and processes so that all the things we promise to do as accounts we can actually do whereas I'd
[00:34:29] Brett Kelly: work in firms for that just wasn't true and so I thought of McDonald's in terms of systems and
[00:34:33] Brett Kelly: processes in terms of front-end with clients back in I thought of Walmart okay so Walmart had this
[00:34:39] Brett Kelly: strategy go everywhere no one wants to be perfect your operations and you then get large before anyone
[00:34:45] Brett Kelly: notices now I do have this saying that most people can't see anything because their heads up their
[00:34:50] Brett Kelly: own backside and so our industry certainly meets that criteria very self-important very in with looking
[00:34:56] Brett Kelly: not looking out at the world not looking at other industries not looking at other businesses
[00:35:01] Brett Kelly: certainly not looking at the client and so I then went to the client line so if you've got your
[00:35:06] Brett Kelly: people your processes right you've got the right to ask somebody to be a client and so I said great
[00:35:10] Brett Kelly: we need to build a system for the clients it can help get them certain about where they are
[00:35:15] Brett Kelly: and and a clear plan to where they want to be a ten-year plan you know what are you working for
[00:35:19] Brett Kelly: you working for your family and your goals how are we going to help you progress so build a client
[00:35:24] Brett Kelly: service system that is completely unique and different to anything else that exists in the world
[00:35:28] Brett Kelly: and then from a financial perspective I said well what would happen if we just ran the numbers as
[00:35:31] Brett Kelly: if Warren Buffett was running the show it's not how big your organization is which our industries
[00:35:37] Brett Kelly: very male which means it's very phallic which means it's very focused on site so it's like my
[00:35:42] Brett Kelly: firms bigger than yours well that's very interesting but does it actually make its people better off
[00:35:46] Brett Kelly: doesn't make its clients better off doesn't make a contribution to the community is it establishing
[00:35:50] Brett Kelly: a mission-based flywheel doesn't have a model that can refuel so that you can grow something that
[00:35:55] Brett Kelly: actually makes a difference over difference over time because if we're going to do something
[00:36:00] Brett Kelly: back to Jim Collins built to last I'd read a red 3000 books case I built to last I want to build
[00:36:05] Brett Kelly: 100 year organization not a 10 minute financial transaction how are we going to do that and so
[00:36:12] that's where we started I started with Scott and I did North Sydney then we had two we called them
[00:36:16] Brett Kelly: Kelly partners and I said I'm going to systemize and I'm going to write up I'm going to build a
[00:36:20] Brett Kelly: business system now if investors make one you know misunderstanding about our group our holding
[00:36:28] Brett Kelly: company owns a business system that can double the profits of an accounting firm reduce the
[00:36:33] Brett Kelly: working capital required to operate that business by two thirds and hand 25 to 40% of the time
[00:36:39] Brett Kelly: of the part is back to them if you can make that much operating difference to a business then it
[00:36:44] Brett Kelly: is likely that many people will want to get into business with you now I've been saying that for
[00:36:50] Brett Kelly: years I don't you know from time to time because I can speak English people say well breads of
[00:36:55] Brett Kelly: promoter I don't care if you buy my stock okay you will over time but as for me I made the decision
[00:37:05] Brett Kelly: that it couldn't be differentiated without being different now most people want to be differentiated
[00:37:11] Brett Kelly: but they don't want to be different in our industry I took the view that the reason that
[00:37:16] Brett Kelly: accounting firms are private is because they couldn't behave in public the way they behave in private
[00:37:22] Brett Kelly: and so if I took a 25 year view of the future we needed to do what Buffett has done which is be
[00:37:28] Brett Kelly: public and show our performance publicly and so in 2017 we listed the company on the Australian
[00:37:34] Brett Kelly: Stock Exchange as a 45 million market cap you know two and a half three million end-pad business
[00:37:40] Brett Kelly: and everyone said to me but you two small why you're listing at this point and I said well if you're
[00:37:46] Brett Kelly: a fund manager in your garage and you do 25% a year returns for three years or five years
[00:37:53] Brett Kelly: and you go to people and say hey I'm doing good returns people say well it's not audited you're
[00:37:58] Brett Kelly: doing it in your garage how do I know it's real and what I was finding was when I met senior
[00:38:03] Brett Kelly: practitioners 60 65 70 that owned great firms they said to me Brett even if what you say is true
[00:38:10] Brett Kelly: how do I know it's true you know you got these private accounts and I showed them the accounts
[00:38:14] Brett Kelly: and the bank accounts and they still wouldn't believe you so I said from a credibility point of
[00:38:19] Brett Kelly: view will be a public company and we'll deliver returns in public and we will show people not tell them
[00:38:25] Brett Kelly: now I'm competent at explaining our business but I believe that our results would you know on
[00:38:31] Brett Kelly: five year periods really communicate the quality of the business model and our ability to execute
[00:38:37] Brett Kelly: that model over time and that you know that is proving to be the case sort of one step at a time
[00:38:43] Brett Kelly: and so that's that's the business you know we find really excellent charted accounting groups
[00:38:49] Brett Kelly: and they've got basically three options so CPA firms charted firms they can sell internally
[00:38:56] Brett Kelly: but the young guys typically don't have the capital to buy out the older old practitioner
[00:39:02] Brett Kelly: they can sell increasingly in the US to private equity you're basically taking your people
[00:39:07] Brett Kelly: and selling them to people that only want to own those people so they can sell those people
[00:39:13] Brett Kelly: and that makes no sense to a founder that is port his life his heart and his soul into building a
[00:39:18] Brett Kelly: business when I meet these founders I say what do you want to do do you want to be able to look
[00:39:24] Brett Kelly: your people in the face do you want to look your clients in the face into a look your community in
[00:39:28] Brett Kelly: the face and say I've sold the business and I don't really care what happens or do you want a
[00:39:34] Brett Kelly: partner with us on a 5149 partner or a driver basis will manage the succession will improve your
[00:39:40] Brett Kelly: business and for the next 50 years your family can point at that business and say that was the
[00:39:45] Brett Kelly: business that my father built that is the business that I built and this is the difference that
[00:39:50] Brett Kelly: that business is still making in that local community now that's been very successful in Australia
[00:39:55] Brett Kelly: I moved to the US and based myself in Los Angeles with my family in January of 2023 so I've been
[00:40:02] Brett Kelly: there nearly a year and a half we bought two firms now in Los Angeles and I think that it is likely
[00:40:07] Brett Kelly: that our model will be well received in the US we're trying to build Australia's global accounting
[00:40:13] Brett Kelly: firm because Australia doesn't have a global accounting firm but basically got down here in Australia
[00:40:18] some of the the leftovers of the rest of the world where the 13th largest economy in the world
[00:40:24] Brett Kelly: when Australians want to grow globally there's an accounting group to help them and I think we can
[00:40:28] Brett Kelly: build a spine through LA to London which is where the big you know Australian expat communities
[00:40:33] Brett Kelly: at London LA New York build that spine and put some muscles on that over time so that's that's the
[00:40:39] Brett Kelly: play that's what we're on about and you know I think to a to an investor that has a has a look
[00:40:47] Brett Kelly: at what we're doing they can probably understand the business fundamentals makes sense
[00:40:53] what really stands out to me there is the 51 49 model so Kelly Partners
[00:41:01] purchases 51% of the business and the current owners continue to own 49% and I think back to
[00:41:09] Clay (Host): the dot connecting a constellation software they do these programmatic acquisitions and they
[00:41:15] Clay (Host): implement these earnouts to help align the incentives and Berkshire is you know a lot of times buying
[00:41:21] Clay (Host): a lot of all the company in these private transactions and tends to hold it forever so talk more
[00:41:27] Clay (Host): about how you landed on the 51 49 model yeah so Seville can follow the bouncing ball here
[00:41:34] Brett Kelly: play this is pretty funny so Warren Buffett in his owner's manual talks about the corporate form
[00:41:40] Brett Kelly: but a partnership mentality Kelly Partners is in the business of partnership a 50.01 or 51.49
[00:41:49] Brett Kelly: is a partnership meaning that every time we make a dollar we get 50 cents each every time we lose
[00:41:55] Brett Kelly: a dollar we lose 50 cents each every time we do something intelligent together we both benefit
[00:42:00] Brett Kelly: every time we do something stupid together we both experience the cost and so our business is the
[00:42:07] Brett Kelly: business of building and operating partnerships we think about our external shareholders in the same
[00:42:12] Brett Kelly: way and have been at pains to demonstrate that we are a business of partnerships not with standing
[00:42:19] Brett Kelly: out corporate form where I got the idea from was that it's a 51.49 10 year starting commitment from
[00:42:28] Brett Kelly: a partner and so when you run the numbers it in an accounting firm if we can double your profits
[00:42:35] Brett Kelly: then you will continue to have a hundred percent of the profits that you always had and if we can
[00:42:41] Brett Kelly: reduce your working capital by two thirds you'll actually have more cash flow each month than you've
[00:42:46] Brett Kelly: ever had and if we can give you a 35 person specialist management team to get under your firm and
[00:42:52] Brett Kelly: take away every nine parts of the business and leave you with just the people the clients and the
[00:42:57] Brett Kelly: community leadership will give you 25 to 40 percent of your time back now most people if you give
[00:43:03] Brett Kelly: them a deal where they get more time and more money and we increase the salability in terms of the
[00:43:10] Brett Kelly: succession profile of the equity of the business and we improve their own self respect in terms
[00:43:16] Brett Kelly: of the way the business operates because the business operates like a first class world class
[00:43:21] Brett Kelly: organization rather than a sort of stuck together hobby there is no downside to this
[00:43:29] Brett Kelly: structure for what we call our operating partners interestingly we need to have a control position
[00:43:36] Brett Kelly: from an ability to to consolidate earnings but the way the actual operations of the business
[00:43:42] Brett Kelly: works it takes a 75 percent boat to do much we can only carry a you know with our 50 50.1 or 51
[00:43:51] Brett Kelly: percent basic like we get to choose the bank the auditor and some real fundamentals run the IT
[00:43:57] Brett Kelly: etc and so it is in all senses a genuine partnership because we believe that people together can do
[00:44:04] Brett Kelly: more than individuals and that was straight from Carnegie lose your job got to work better with
[00:44:09] Brett Kelly: people why don't we just partner together and build something together where we both genuinely
[00:44:14] Brett Kelly: benefit and if I make you better off you'll make me better off and vice versa so it's really
[00:44:19] Brett Kelly: from that philosophy if you make people better off then you'll be better off and weak to find
[00:44:25] Brett Kelly: better off is healthy wealthy and wise the other thing that I'd learned with this sort of 10 year
[00:44:30] Brett Kelly: book to before I go to that the 51 40 nice important because most accounting firms there's five
[00:44:34] Brett Kelly: partners are 20 percentage and they spend their whole life politicking about who's going to do what
[00:44:40] Brett Kelly: if we have a 51 percent position that never happens because we simply say to the partners you
[00:44:44] Brett Kelly: need to make a decision make a decision now they know that if they don't make a decision we can make
[00:44:48] Brett Kelly: a decision but I'm pleased to say in nearly 18 years of running these partnerships I've never had
[00:44:54] Brett Kelly: to sort of use but I have never once had to use by 51 percent position in any single event
[00:45:01] ever because the partners in the situation where they know somebody can make a decision and
[00:45:06] Brett Kelly: leadership is making decisions our industry doesn't move forward because everything's put off the
[00:45:12] Brett Kelly: next month next quarter next year whereas in our partnerships people are making decisions and that's
[00:45:17] Brett Kelly: okay if you get it wrong it doesn't matter if you make a new decision to fix it but the worst
[00:45:21] Brett Kelly: decision is no decision and no decision is a decision so that changes the leadership profile of
[00:45:26] Brett Kelly: firm dramatically the second thing we worked out was in partnership some people were thinking I'm
[00:45:30] Brett Kelly: going to leave next month but nobody knew I'm going to leave next year what I learned from
[00:45:34] Brett Kelly: Buffett was that you need a really long term commitment between your partners because otherwise
[00:45:40] Brett Kelly: everyone's got a different time agenda and that destroys your investment proposition so we
[00:45:45] Brett Kelly: asked the partners to make a minimum 10 year commitment there's huge penalties if they leave before
[00:45:49] Brett Kelly: that time so there's massive disincentives but most importantly we know that we can make people
[00:45:55] Brett Kelly: very successful over 10 years but when we're certain we can't make them successful over 10 minutes
[00:46:00] Brett Kelly: that's 10,000 hours 10 years etc how I came up with 10 years is the average Australian marriage
[00:46:06] Brett Kelly: last seven years and the average Australian home mortgage last eight years however the research
[00:46:11] Brett Kelly: indicates that if you stay in your marriage for more than seven years on average of marriage
[00:46:15] Brett Kelly: or last 25 years I was confident that if people were in business with us for 10 years they would
[00:46:20] Brett Kelly: start to experience compounding when I do a compound calculation you don't get much compounding
[00:46:27] Brett Kelly: before year 10 but from year 11 to 20 you'll see significant compounding now that's true in the
[00:46:34] Brett Kelly: numbers and it's true in life and it's definitely true in business and so I knew that if I could get
[00:46:39] Brett Kelly: our partners to hang in there with us for 10 years they would start to see the compounding of
[00:46:44] Brett Kelly: relationships with each other that's the compounding of relationships with clients that's the
[00:46:48] Brett Kelly: compounding of the network effect of just doing good business together and they would definitely see
[00:46:55] Brett Kelly: a financial compounding that was just straight you know my great love of what I call spreadsheet art
[00:47:02] Brett Kelly: which is is the fiddling in spreadsheets until you can really communicate what the numbers mean
[00:47:08] Brett Kelly: so that the 5149 a 10-year commitment and then the third part play is a central management team
[00:47:14] Brett Kelly: the firms pay six and a half percent of their revenue for a central management fee and two and a
[00:47:19] Brett Kelly: half a team and two and a half percent for IP now the reason that we did that was that the form
[00:47:25] Brett Kelly: of most accounting firms is partnership and the problem with partnership is that they must
[00:47:30] Brett Kelly: distribute all of their income every year so there's no ability to retain profits that leads to
[00:47:36] Brett Kelly: firstly overdrawing so they leave the corporate form very weak and secondly just no long-term
[00:47:43] Brett Kelly: investment to build some muscle in the organization and so by having this 9% it means that our flywheel
[00:47:51] Brett Kelly: Jim Collins talks about the top of the flywheel's mission and the bottom's fuel we have this 9%
[00:47:57] Brett Kelly: reinvestment now for any of your listeners who are genuine investors if you are internally
[00:48:02] Brett Kelly: reinvesting 9% of your revenues as our group grows our ability to reinvest under these firms
[00:48:09] Brett Kelly: grows and it's growing at an exponential rate against firms that don't invest a cent because the
[00:48:15] Brett Kelly: partner's just overdraw and rip money out of these businesses and leave the actual form of the
[00:48:20] Brett Kelly: business very fragile so I just like you listen us to understand that if there's a 10 million revenue
[00:48:25] Brett Kelly: firm in their local area and there's a 10 million revenue firm in their local area if we invest
[00:48:31] Brett Kelly: into one of those firms we're putting a services stream of income now that is over 10 million
[00:48:37] Brett Kelly: a year under that firm which means that I'm sitting here with software engineers and graphic
[00:48:42] Brett Kelly: designers and digital marketing experts and full-time dedicated recruiting functional learning
[00:48:49] Brett Kelly: and development and HR and finance and IT etc a resource of 35 36 people under a local firm
[00:48:57] Brett Kelly: it's an unmatched advantage and so what it means is if we go head to head with that firm
[00:49:02] Brett Kelly: that market our firm is going to be massively advantaged it's self-funding itself for
[00:49:08] Brett Kelly: self-sustaining it grows as we grow it's unbelievably capital-efficient when I have an
[00:49:14] Brett Kelly: erase equity to do anything we're not none of this PE we've got to sell a bunch of the firm to raise
[00:49:18] Brett Kelly: the money to reinvest in the firm it's like why don't we just drive earnings and drive reinvestment
[00:49:24] Brett Kelly: in a disciplined way to build that flywheel over time and that's what's happening so look there's
[00:49:29] Brett Kelly: a bit to that but basically those three elements of a 51 49 a 10-year commitment we've got 95
[00:49:34] Brett Kelly: equity partners who've made that commitment and 9% of the revenue being consistently reinvested
[00:49:39] Brett Kelly: in that structure I think is it well it is entirely unique in the entire world and it is
[00:49:48] Brett Kelly: extraordinarily powerful I've told it now there's plenty of different types of accounting firms
[00:49:56] Clay (Host): how about you talk about what your ideal partnership looks like and what you're looking for
[00:50:02] Clay (Host): and a partner how do you get started with stock investing I've put together a course to teach you
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_02: everything I wish I knew when I first started investing in stocks let's start at the beginning
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_02: and ask what is a stock let's zoom on in into what it's actually like to buy a stock a few options
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_02: are Charles Schwab TD Ameritrade ally E-Trade fortunately you won't have to necessarily calculate
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_02: all of these taxes yourself I'll outline a few main ones to be aware of throughout your lifetime
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_02: investing journey as Warren Buffett says your best investment is yourself there's nothing that
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_02: compares to it by the end you'll be savvier about stock investing in personal finance than the
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_02: vast majority of people even if you're not a total beginner I'm confident you'll get a lot out
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_02: of the principles and strategies I outline which will build on throughout link to the course is
[00:50:55] SPEAKER_02: available in the description below see you there yes so the ideal partnership is led by people that
[00:51:02] Brett Kelly: share our values our values are very simple there's three cool things we're looking for
[00:51:07] Brett Kelly: number one that has to be a person for others a person that looks to make other people better
[00:51:12] Brett Kelly: off first before they think about their own self interest the second thing we're looking for is
[00:51:17] Brett Kelly: a person that keeps their promises that means that on on pain of death they would turn up because
[00:51:22] Brett Kelly: they said they would if they say they're going to do something that rather die they're not do that
[00:51:27] Brett Kelly: thing and the third thing is a person that's firmly convinced that a team can do more than an
[00:51:32] Brett Kelly: individual and so if we find those three things in the leadership of a firm then we know where I'll
[00:51:37] Brett Kelly: do a good thing we're trying to find found a led firms these are typically typically men and women
[00:51:44] Brett Kelly: who've spent 30 plus years building a firm with their blood sweat and tear pouring their soul into
[00:51:49] Brett Kelly: what we call their baby the baby they've spent more time with typically than their actual babies
[00:51:54] Brett Kelly: and that really reflects their commitment to their people clients and community and when we find
[00:51:59] Brett Kelly: those firms that typically two to ten million they they look after privately held closely held
[00:52:04] Brett Kelly: family businesses is they're you know 80% of their revenue and they're concerned about what happens
[00:52:10] Brett Kelly: next that they are doing who they are as their profession it's not a job it's not they're not
[00:52:16] Brett Kelly: there for the money they'll continue to do it forever if you give them a structure where they can
[00:52:20] Brett Kelly: but they're tired of being the person that's carrying this you know entirely by themselves or with
[00:52:25] Brett Kelly: their small group of partners and they're typically in a situation where their kids are now having
[00:52:30] Brett Kelly: grandkids and their wife is saying hi I want to spend more time with their grandkids and the grandkids
[00:52:34] Brett Kelly: are out of state and up the road and you know the wife's like well come on you know I need a little
[00:52:40] Brett Kelly: bit of your time often the the gentleman or or the woman is is now got older parents who are
[00:52:47] Brett Kelly: needing more time and care and attention and so they're like hey Brett I love what I do but I can't
[00:52:54] Brett Kelly: keep working like I'm 30 when I'm 65 or 70 I've got a great young partner group they're confident
[00:53:00] Brett Kelly: they can run the clients but in the team but they're not really confident they want to take on the
[00:53:05] Brett Kelly: whole firm the dollars don't really work anyway what can we do and we're finding a real resonance
[00:53:11] Brett Kelly: of our model anywhere we meet with people I met with a firm in Scotland recently I spoke to
[00:53:16] Brett Kelly: a firm in London we met with firm in Utah a number of firms in Texas we've been spoken of
[00:53:24] Brett Kelly: firms in Paris etc the model is based on structuring an organization so that the people can
[00:53:31] Brett Kelly: reach their full human and professional potential and so we believe it's likely to resonate in you know
[00:53:37] Brett Kelly: in in many places we're in good company there's a German group called ETL they have 1250 firms 1.5
[00:53:45] Brett Kelly: billion dollars or 1.5 billion euro of revenue that being building a 50 50 model like ours for 50
[00:53:51] Brett Kelly: years in Germany and are now growing through Europe and so we're not alone in our approach
[00:53:56] Brett Kelly: although our earnings are nearly three times there's I had mentioned that presentation
[00:54:04] Clay (Host): our mastermind community member had done and some questions came up from that that I thought
[00:54:09] Clay (Host): were quite interesting and a couple of which that I wanted to run by you let's start with the
[00:54:14] Clay (Host): transition to the US so Australia itself you know is a fairly large market in terms of
[00:54:21] Clay (Host): the number of potential partnerships you could reach there and some are asking okay why is
[00:54:29] Clay (Host): Brett making the move to the US why is he now in LA making I I keep wanting to say making
[00:54:37] Clay (Host): acquisitions but it's essentially going and entering these partnerships in California building
[00:54:42] Clay (Host): partnerships Clay yep that's right so talk about in your view why you made the move to
[00:54:51] Clay (Host): California and turned your attention to that market so in a founder led business and for your
[00:54:59] Brett Kelly: listeners who haven't read the founders mentality which is a fantastic booklet baing in company
[00:55:04] Brett Kelly: of published they will never understand someone like me I started to burn in a small room there were
[00:55:12] Brett Kelly: four people I had 200,000 of buildings and I had a crazy idea to build a group that you can
[00:55:19] Brett Kelly: more clearly see today but any listener or investor should understand that they can't see what I
[00:55:26] Brett Kelly: can see any level of humility would make it clear that somebody that has spent I'm 49 years old I
[00:55:35] Brett Kelly: been in the industry since I was 18 and it would be unlikely that anyone could meet anyone
[00:55:42] Brett Kelly: in the world that has spent more time thinking about what I'm thinking about in our industry
[00:55:48] Brett Kelly: than I have spent and so it is impossible for somebody to fully understand what I can see
[00:55:55] Brett Kelly: but what I can see is that where the number 21st largest group in Australia and on a run rate
[00:56:01] Brett Kelly: basis when number 17 and on a three year basis will be number 11 or 10 and number nine is more than
[00:56:09] Brett Kelly: two times that revenue in Australia and so if we get to 120 million we're about number 10 in
[00:56:15] Brett Kelly: Australia of revenue number nine is about 240 and number six is about 480 so I look at Australia
[00:56:24] Brett Kelly: and say we can continue to compound in Australia indefinitely but 20% for a long long time
[00:56:32] Brett Kelly: and I'm confident enough in our team and our model to indicate that I don't need to be here for
[00:56:38] Brett Kelly: that to happen the number one criticism that I've had over time is but look at Kelly partners and
[00:56:43] Brett Kelly: what happens if Kelly's not there well I started 10 years ago having 16 weeks holidays a year
[00:56:48] Brett Kelly: to get myself out of Australia so that my team could could learn and grow and then I realized that
[00:56:55] Brett Kelly: if I stay you know at the top of the businesses here every day I'm in Sydney at the moment
[00:57:03] Brett Kelly: then I wouldn't give my best people the opportunity to step up and and fully run their functions
[00:57:08] Brett Kelly: and so again a good friend of mine who's built an enormous global business said but just get
[00:57:13] Brett Kelly: out of Australia now my son I have a son is 18 a son is 16 a son is 12 a member of YPO I've
[00:57:19] Brett Kelly: been to Harvard many many times with YPO and as a young person Tom grew up seeing me go to the US
[00:57:26] Brett Kelly: to study all my business heroes are in the US and he had decided that he wanted to go to college in the US
[00:57:34] Brett Kelly: and so my wife said to me look Brad I'm not sending Tom to the US by himself
[00:57:39] Brett Kelly: Beck had published a best-selling book with Fran Drescher the Nanny in 2022 I'm called Innies for
[00:57:47] Brett Kelly: the Nanny that's my wife and when we were in the US as part of that the two book launches that she
[00:57:54] Brett Kelly: did in March in New York and in September in LA she noticed that a lot of people liked to talk to me
[00:58:01] Brett Kelly: and do things with me and she said Brad why aren't you doing anything in the US and I said well honey
[00:58:06] Brett Kelly: I've got this wife that'd be you I think some a little busy and if I was doing business in the US
[00:58:12] Brett Kelly: I'd be away from home more and she's like well why don't we just move to the US and you just do a
[00:58:18] Brett Kelly: few more of these things that people want you to do because I get the sense that if you don't you know
[00:58:23] Brett Kelly: in 10 years time it'll be a little bitter I said okay well if you're keen we need to find a house we
[00:58:29] Brett Kelly: need to find a school and we need to have some indication from the universe that that was what we
[00:58:33] Brett Kelly: should do Lawrence Cunningham for your listeners who don't realize is the deputy chairman of
[00:58:38] Brett Kelly: Constellation Software he's on our board Lawrence sent me an email during the lockdown he said
[00:58:43] Brett Kelly: Brett your business looks fantastic it was it was referred to me by a friend of mine and I just
[00:58:51] Brett Kelly: wonder are you just trying to build the Constellation Software of the accounting industry and I said
[00:58:54] Brett Kelly: yeah he was the first person in 20 years or 18 years that had made that observation who actually
[00:59:01] Brett Kelly: understood what I'm trying to do and so I said yeah that's exactly what I'm trying to do let's have
[00:59:06] Brett Kelly: a zoom and we got on zoom he became a board advisor or board observer for six months I mean
[00:59:11] Brett Kelly: I asked him to join our board I said the Lawrence look how crazy is it that we could do this in the US
[00:59:16] Brett Kelly: he said it's not crazy at all meet Mark Miller who was the first the leader of the first business
[00:59:21] Brett Kelly: at Mark Leonard had bought I met Mark you know aha I talked to Mark for over an hour about you know
[00:59:27] Brett Kelly: how he'd built I think he's got 4000 now he's got like 15 thousand people in 40 countries or
[00:59:34] Brett Kelly: something now it's part of the operating group that he runs for consolation we chatted about what
[00:59:38] Brett Kelly: was required so then I did a bunch of trips we had to get a visa we had to just see if it made sense
[00:59:44] Brett Kelly: and all the sort of stars aligned to indicate that it was what we should do there is nothing that
[00:59:49] Brett Kelly: that we're doing in the US that will preclude us growing in Australia at all we will continue to
[00:59:55] Brett Kelly: grow as we always have in Australia and prosecute the opportunity here the US market is 15 times
[01:00:02] Brett Kelly: a size of Australia the UK market is six times a size we've taken the addressable market and
[01:00:07] Brett Kelly: grown it by 30 times and we have a number of ideas that we're testing as to how to grow into those
[01:00:14] Brett Kelly: markets firstly we're trying to do in L.A. what we did in Sydney which is go close basically put a
[01:00:19] Brett Kelly: ring around L.A. and build a network of firms we've done too so far I think we've got another two
[01:00:25] Brett Kelly: coming if you bet against our ability to execute on that you'll definitely lose I have
[01:00:32] Brett Kelly: complete confidence that we can build a group in L.A. that looks very much like what we have in Sydney
[01:00:38] Brett Kelly: we've been approached by management teams from many markets saying you know how could I partner with
[01:00:43] Brett Kelly: Kelly partners to build your model in our market and it's likely that we will partner with management
[01:00:48] Brett Kelly: teams in other markets to build Kelly partners groups in a very capital efficient way in those markets
[01:00:56] Brett Kelly: and again you know like most things it'll look crazy until it isn't but if you're looking at
[01:01:04] Brett Kelly: somebody like me and I'm doing what you think I should be doing that I'm definitely doing the
[01:01:08] Brett Kelly: wrong thing because there is no way that you can know what I know about our industry level out of
[01:01:14] Brett Kelly: our business and so as an investor it takes a little bit of humility to say well you know I just
[01:01:20] Brett Kelly: look at Twitter and I listen to the Clowns commenting on what Musk is doing with Twitter and I say
[01:01:27] Brett Kelly: you know Michael Angelo went into the system chapel for four years he put up all of that scaffolding
[01:01:33] Brett Kelly: and he painted every day for years and years and years and because he was laying on his back often
[01:01:39] Brett Kelly: with a candle he would come out every day I imagine covered in paint and he'd walk through the
[01:01:45] Brett Kelly: town and the Clowns would go look at that idiot with that paint all over his face
[01:01:49] Brett Kelly: what does he think he's doing he's been in there for years what the hell's he doing
[01:01:54] Brett Kelly: when I started this business I was digging a foundation I was down 10 stories down digging the mud
[01:02:01] Brett Kelly: and it was filthy ugly horrible nasty difficult work now Doug the whole we put in the steel we
[01:02:08] Brett Kelly: poured the concrete and it's only the true missionaries or true believers that are prepared to
[01:02:12] Brett Kelly: join you in that task and it was horrible no one wanted to know me no one was interested in what
[01:02:19] Brett Kelly: we were doing it was like why is that crazy guy doing over there but as we built floor after floor
[01:02:26] Brett Kelly: after floor after floor you know when you get up high and it starts to look up like you've got a
[01:02:30] Brett Kelly: penthouse there's a lot of people that want to be your friends and we'll say hey can I come and
[01:02:35] Brett Kelly: come to the party in your penthouse now they don't even realize that that's not a penthouse because
[01:02:39] Brett Kelly: you're still building but there it is it becomes easier and easier to attract people to what you're
[01:02:44] Brett Kelly: doing similarly when Michael Antley with painting is roof and he had all that painting everyone
[01:02:49] Brett Kelly: thinks he's crazy but when he took down that scaffolding which must have taken weeks and eventually
[01:02:54] they bought people in and said what do you think of that people are like I could never have imagined
[01:03:00] Brett Kelly: that that's what you were doing and so you know I look at Twitter I'll mate by Twitter everyone's
[01:03:06] Brett Kelly: commenting on what he's doing and I said to everyone that would listen all my mates I said
[01:03:11] Brett Kelly: mate mask is a genius I have no idea what he's doing but he's probably not wasting his time and even
[01:03:16] Brett Kelly: if he is everyone will make mistakes what's it to you it's his own money is in there doing what he's
[01:03:21] Brett Kelly: doing and so it takes a level of you know I try to engage with the world with a level of curiosity
[01:03:28] Brett Kelly: a level of humility I don't know much so I can't really know what they're doing but I'm interested
[01:03:35] Brett Kelly: and so that's what we're doing you know we will continue to grow in Australia you know we bought a 1.5
[01:03:41] Brett Kelly: million revenue firm a 3 million revenue firm in LA we bought into those so that building
[01:03:46] Brett Kelly: partnerships there 65 roll 51 49 we bought in a younger 36 year old who bought 10% so we're
[01:03:54] Brett Kelly: proving that a young person's attracted to the model then we bought the other firm that's 3
[01:03:58] Brett Kelly: million was built by one guy from zero to to 3 million in six years who who decided that he could
[01:04:04] Brett Kelly: get to 15 million easier with Kelly partners and he could buy himself and so I'm just building
[01:04:09] Brett Kelly: the business case that you know is it likely that people are going to want to partner with us in
[01:04:13] Brett Kelly: the same way they have in Australia you know you know way that risk none of our capital that is
[01:04:18] Brett Kelly: incredibly capital-fishing where there's an exponential return to the very minimal if any risk
[01:04:26] Brett Kelly: that we're taking and so all I would say to people is you know we're not fools we work extremely
[01:04:32] Brett Kelly: hard we're quite cluey about what we do and we're uncertain that there's anyone in the world that
[01:04:36] Brett Kelly: knows more about what we're doing in the two to 10 million you know accounting firm market and so
[01:04:43] Brett Kelly: you know patients will prove to be very rewarding to them you know I do own 48% of the group
[01:04:50] Brett Kelly: I treat you know the way I've behaved as an owner I think is completely aligned with shareholders
[01:04:56] Brett Kelly: so you know I'm not running an experiment with other people's money the consequences of my
[01:05:01] Brett Kelly: actions I feel on a 50-50 basis essentially I was happy to see Lawrence Cunningham sit on the
[01:05:10] Clay (Host): board of Kelly partners group I believe the only two other boards I know of that he sits on or
[01:05:15] Clay (Host): constellation software and Marquell so you're definitely in good good company there so well
[01:05:21] Brett Kelly: other time he joined Clay the only other board he sat on was constellation and when I was at the
[01:05:26] Brett Kelly: Berkshire meeting last year Tom Gainer asked me said Brett you know we're going to appoint Lawrence
[01:05:32] Brett Kelly: to the Marquell board is that okay I said Tom you're there to be the smart guy here you're a bit slow
[01:05:37] Brett Kelly: but um look I think we're in good company and you know it would be worthwhile for people to wonder
[01:05:44] Brett Kelly: why would Lawrence sit on a board at the time he joined the market cap of the company was less
[01:05:49] Brett Kelly: than 200 million Australian dollars Marquell's market cap was 18 billion US dollars
[01:05:54] Brett Kelly: and constellations was 50 billion US dollars of you know at the time so you know ideas come before
[01:06:03] Brett Kelly: actions actions lead to habits and have it to your future and so for me getting getting around
[01:06:10] Brett Kelly: the people with the right ideas that can help us lift our standards and lift our sense of what's
[01:06:16] Brett Kelly: possible is why we hang out with people like Lawrence and many other incredible people you know we
[01:06:22] Brett Kelly: have a big vision of what's possible in your you know spice so constellation software if I'm
[01:06:29] Clay (Host): not mistaken they incentivize their management team based on return on invested capital and I
[01:06:36] Clay (Host): noticed in your annual report that it states part of your compensation is based on a percentage of
[01:06:41] Clay (Host): revenue and uh some of the investors I've talked with this has been a talking point or a concern for
[01:06:48] Clay (Host): some so maybe you could talk more about this incentive and if there's potentially any plans to
[01:06:54] Clay (Host): change that or implement a different structure in any way so clay after filling around you know we
[01:07:03] Brett Kelly: have an independent REM committee and when we listed the company I wanted to take one dollar as my
[01:07:08] Brett Kelly: salary but the investors said that that would misstate earnings and so if you were ever
[01:07:14] Brett Kelly: to leave as a CEO Brett we would need to have something in there to pay somebody and so they calculated
[01:07:21] Brett Kelly: my salary as 1% of $36 million which was our revenue at the time which is where $360,000 came from
[01:07:28] Brett Kelly: in 2017 for the next five years I didn't increase my remuneration by a single dollar and even a
[01:07:35] Brett Kelly: $360,000 Australian dollars I could have been earning three times that being a chartered accountant
[01:07:41] Brett Kelly: not running a business so I'm a chartered accountant with a master's degree that is probably one of
[01:07:47] Brett Kelly: the best business developers in the world in my space and so I could certainly get paid a million
[01:07:52] Brett Kelly: Australian dollars a year to walk into a chartered accounting firm and just be a chartered accountant
[01:07:56] Brett Kelly: I could do that about one day a week so no investor has ever had to um overpay for my contributions
[01:08:05] Brett Kelly: in the next five years I moved the market cap with my team from 45 million to say 200 and um
[01:08:17] and today the market cap is about 315 that's 51% of the group then the that we own as a whole
[01:08:24] Brett Kelly: co the other 49 that's owned by the operating partners is probably worth something so you could
[01:08:29] Brett Kelly: imagine that in that period of time we've created north of 600 million of value and the average
[01:08:39] Brett Kelly: remuneration I've earned in that period is about 250,000 a year a year across 18 years so at the end
[01:08:47] Brett Kelly: of five years I said to the board look you know that 1% I didn't want to increase my revenue until
[01:08:52] Brett Kelly: I'd shown some decent results for everybody um but now you should probably put me you know
[01:08:58] Brett Kelly: recalibrate me back at my 1% they didn't back pay me for the five years that they didn't pay me
[01:09:03] Brett Kelly: my 1% remember it was the board that came up with that that REM strategy I've demonstrated over 18 years
[01:09:11] Brett Kelly: that we can deliver 30 plus ROE returns and 30 plus ROIC returns there's been no indication that
[01:09:21] Brett Kelly: that's ever changed and so you're investing with somebody that for nearly 20 years has got a 30
[01:09:26] Brett Kelly: percent plus kegur 30 percent plus EBITDA margins 30 percent plus ROE now I'm in the business of
[01:09:34] Brett Kelly: attracting developing and retaining talent so what an investor has to say is what would it cost
[01:09:40] Brett Kelly: a higher breadth well it would cost a lot more than Kelly Partners group holdings currently pays me
[01:09:46] Brett Kelly: or has ever paid me if you remunerated me on a constellation basis or a transdom basis I'd probably
[01:09:56] Brett Kelly: own 95 percent of the group today the typical ROE required of these guys is not very much certainly
[01:10:03] Brett Kelly: not the ROE that that I've delivered over time with my team and so every year you'd be throwing
[01:10:09] Brett Kelly: options at me and I'd be owning a gigantic amount of the company all in all it's quite a fair
[01:10:17] Brett Kelly: way for the company it's a very good deal for the company and you know I've never put my interest
[01:10:23] Brett Kelly: ahead of the company and I think that's the point is that you know if people look at the company I
[01:10:28] Brett Kelly: moved to the US the company lent me $1.8 million so that I could move I needed to sell
[01:10:34] Brett Kelly: some property here so I could buy a property there they let me that money I paid back three quarters
[01:10:38] Brett Kelly: of that now I saw some shares recently to pay some of that money back I sold it you know 30 percent
[01:10:44] Brett Kelly: less than the shares trade today I've just never put my interest in front of the interest of the
[01:10:49] Brett Kelly: company and currently your company's listed on the Australian market is there a pusher a
[01:10:58] Clay (Host): desire to eventually get listed in the US and why or why not absolutely so I req capital or a great
[01:11:06] Brett Kelly: investor in Sweden I met them recently faced face which is great but a number of years ago they
[01:11:12] Brett Kelly: specialized in serial acquires and we met them and they said Brett we know that you won't sell us
[01:11:17] Brett Kelly: an institutionally sized position in Kelly partners because you're not prepared to lose control
[01:11:22] Brett Kelly: I said this is true they said why don't you just get a dual class structure I said you can't do
[01:11:26] Brett Kelly: that in Australia and they said why don't you just move exchanges and so for many years now
[01:11:33] Brett Kelly: since that conversation I was like well I wonder if Australia will ever let you do it no
[01:11:38] Brett Kelly: so I really face two choices I can either raise capital dilute myself lose control of the group
[01:11:44] Brett Kelly: or I can get a dual class structure somewhere ultimately I think the place to build a global business
[01:11:50] Brett Kelly: our aspiration is to build Australia's global accounting firm for driven private business owners
[01:11:55] Brett Kelly: the best place to do that is from you know a US listing in US capital markets and so
[01:12:01] Brett Kelly: when we can get an appropriate valuation on the group such that if we need to spend 12 to 15
[01:12:08] Brett Kelly: million dollars to do that we can raise that capital at an appropriate valuation that's not
[01:12:14] Brett Kelly: massively destructive to existing shareholders then we'll definitely do that we've done all of the
[01:12:21] Brett Kelly: legal work to understand how to do it it's not a difficult process so it's our aspiration to
[01:12:27] Brett Kelly: list in the US at an appropriate time get a dual class structure I'll do a sell down
[01:12:33] Brett Kelly: my own 48% of the group at the moment I'll sell down to about 32 and a half to 35 I publish that
[01:12:39] Brett Kelly: in our own as manual when we first listed it's been known by all all of our investors forever my
[01:12:44] Brett Kelly: aspiration is to be structured like Warren Buffett Buffett has about a billion dollars outside
[01:12:49] Brett Kelly: Berkshire you never put any of his money in a Berkshire he funds himself outside Berkshire largely
[01:12:54] Brett Kelly: and then and then it's got Berkshire which has given him a very independent way of operating
[01:13:00] Brett Kelly: that business which I think makes a huge amount of sense and so that's always been my goal is to
[01:13:04] Brett Kelly: get a dual class structure so I can continue to have control of the group do a sell down so I'm
[01:13:10] Brett Kelly: independent it funded and then sit there you know I'm 50 in August I have a 25 plus a 25 year
[01:13:17] Brett Kelly: plan to continue to grow the group it's a long compounding you know mindset and I think we've
[01:13:24] Brett Kelly: got a demonstrated track record of behavior that lines up with that mindset that people can
[01:13:30] Brett Kelly: get very comfortable with so at that point you know Australian shareholders or anyone that's
[01:13:36] Brett Kelly: a shareholder in the Australian stock would get listed US shares and and you know we we would love
[01:13:42] Brett Kelly: to be able to put out financial metrics next to CB's CB IZ is the only listed accounting group in
[01:13:49] Brett Kelly: America and now EBITDA margins nearly three times theirs our RO ICs more than two times theirs our
[01:13:56] Brett Kelly: ROE is nearly three times theirs and I think that our model is stronger than their model now being
[01:14:03] Brett Kelly: listed in Australia increase the number of the amount of the offload two hours by ten times
[01:14:09] Brett Kelly: pre-IPO post-IPO because it gave us real credibility and visibility in the market we already
[01:14:15] Brett Kelly: have that credibility and visibility in this market we believe if we were listed in the US that
[01:14:19] Brett Kelly: would give us credibility in the US market and visibility and it is likely to translate into the UK
[01:14:25] Brett Kelly: and other places because it's really the pre-eminent place to play so that's the theory behind it
[01:14:31] Brett Kelly: we think that if we can be you know the strongest alternative to private equity in the US market
[01:14:35] Brett Kelly: outside CB is that it's really focused on buying much larger firms than that proposition would be
[01:14:41] Brett Kelly: extraordinarily successful in that market now CB is is you know two and a half three billion market
[01:14:48] Brett Kelly: cap a billion of revenue more than 50% insurance I think too so you know if we need to be three times
[01:14:54] Brett Kelly: our size to to have a market kept in excess of theirs because of the margin difference and I think
[01:14:59] Brett Kelly: it's achievable I also wanted to ask you about your 2023 results it looks like the net income
[01:15:07] Clay (Host): and earnings per share came back a little bit and I believe that was the year you also moved to the
[01:15:13] Clay (Host): United States so for investors that are curious for why the potential slowdown I know you think on
[01:15:19] Clay (Host): five year time periods and you know you want to attract investors that think long-term and give
[01:15:24] Clay (Host): the company room to run yeah what what was going on in 2023 that led to that pullback because presumably
[01:15:32] Clay (Host): you would have had you know more partnerships that are you know growing the overall business
[01:15:38] Clay (Host): yeah so maybe you could speak to that yeah so for for anyone that looks you know I say to people
[01:15:46] Brett Kelly: you know the great Jim Rohn quote you know be a meaningful specific not a wandering generality
[01:15:53] Brett Kelly: you know be a deep person in a superficial world any review of the materials that we publish that are
[01:15:59] Brett Kelly: incredibly clear and massively comprehensive would make very clear to any investor that we made
[01:16:07] Brett Kelly: the strategic decision that we clearly communicated that we would invest beyond our 9% to build our
[01:16:13] US platform in that year it cost two and a half million Australian dollars as we shared it with
[01:16:20] Brett Kelly: expected it would and so that on a non-recurring basis it would take some money to build a platform
[01:16:27] Brett Kelly: for growth in the US market and so that's what we did if you take that number out of our numbers
[01:16:33] Brett Kelly: you'll see that our growth continues it is best for people to look at free cash flow and free cash
[01:16:39] Brett Kelly: flow per share we've shrunk the number of shares on issue since IPO we have 45 million shares exactly
[01:16:47] Brett Kelly: on issue and our free cash flow continues to grow very strongly every year and so you can look into
[01:16:54] Brett Kelly: the numbers and get yourself confused however I think can our CFO does a very good job of providing
[01:17:02] Brett Kelly: you know clear clear information we expect that we did 5.4 million and Pat last year we'll do 8.5
[01:17:08] Brett Kelly: million plus this year and you know the growth from revenue to earnings is obvious if you back out
[01:17:16] Brett Kelly: the additional investment that we've made which is sort of easy to to see now we've now got a 70
[01:17:22] Brett Kelly: attract record of the listed company of basically doing this additional investment beyond our 9%
[01:17:26] Brett Kelly: and then squeezing it back as we grow and then we'll ramp it up a bit we'll squeeze it back as we
[01:17:32] Brett Kelly: grow we have to invest a head of growth you know if we know that we're going to have a firm join us
[01:17:38] Brett Kelly: we have to have the hands there to catch that and integrate and do that very well we're not prepared
[01:17:45] Brett Kelly: to have a group join us and then do a poor job of integration we do a world class job of integration
[01:17:51] Brett Kelly: so that that firm will be part of our group forever and that that requires us investing you know
[01:17:57] Brett Kelly: ahead of the curve wonderful well I really appreciate you joining me Brad it's been fun getting
[01:18:05] Clay (Host): to know you a little bit better and learn a bit more about Kelly Partners as well for those that
[01:18:11] Clay (Host): would like to learn more about Kelly Partners or learn more about you I just want to give you a
[01:18:16] Clay (Host): chance to share any resources you'd like to point the audience to you know I love the saying clay
[01:18:23] Brett Kelly: seek and you will find that's a commandment but it's also a promise what it means is that I can't
[01:18:29] Brett Kelly: do your seeking in order for you to find you have to do your seeking so you have to read the owner's
[01:18:35] Brett Kelly: manual you need to go from 2017 print out everything we've ever published and sit there with a
[01:18:41] Brett Kelly: pendant of ruler in a quiet place and do the work but if you do the work what you'll discover
[01:18:47] Brett Kelly: is that my team and I have been doing the work and we'll continue the work to do the work with
[01:18:52] Brett Kelly: great passion to prosecute what we think is a reasonable business proposition an understandable
[01:18:59] Brett Kelly: business model that is duplicatable in many places now we're prepared to do this for a long time
[01:19:04] Brett Kelly: because we love it we are driven by a mission to make other people better off we believe we have
[01:19:10] Brett Kelly: values that are not just eternal but certainly workable in all places times and cultures and the
[01:19:18] Brett Kelly: vision that we have for the business is not crazy we're not trying to take a rock into the moon and
[01:19:22] Brett Kelly: then get that rocker to come back down and land we're trying to build a global accounting firm
[01:19:26] Brett Kelly: of which there are many but we're trying to build one with an Australian flavor with a self-starting
[01:19:32] Brett Kelly: challenge the status quo get up and go that Australians are very well known for you can wander
[01:19:38] Brett Kelly: around America and see the Westfield group and feel listeners that don't realise that's an Australian
[01:19:43] Brett Kelly: group built from Sydney the world's largest shopping center group it's all over America I'm
[01:19:49] Brett Kelly: following the playbook that the Lowie family established in 1985 and if you haven't read the book
[01:19:55] Brett Kelly: on Frank Lowie and you've never heard of him because you're American you haven't looked outside
[01:19:59] Brett Kelly: America get the book and read it and you'll be much better off for it he's one of the world's
[01:20:02] Brett Kelly: greatest ever entrepreneurs there are many Australians who are the leaders in industries all
[01:20:07] Brett Kelly: around the world and and we aim to to sort of join that group a really tremendous mentor of mine
[01:20:15] Brett Kelly: that I did catch up with yesterday said a great thing to me he said Brett it's so great you've
[01:20:19] Brett Kelly: moved to LA he said I was in Australia one of the wealthiest men in Australia and he said I for
[01:20:24] Brett Kelly: three years I pushed my group to grow globally but then I realised that you can't lead
[01:20:33] by pushing from behind you have to get out in front and so he picked up his wife his two kids
[01:20:39] Brett Kelly: moved to Singapore and conquered the Asian market moved to the Bahamas conquered the US market
[01:20:45] Brett Kelly: and is now in in Monaco and Europe I thought that was such a like a great observation in that
[01:20:52] Brett Kelly: you know business is show business it's not tell business for me to communicate clearly to our team
[01:20:58] Brett Kelly: that I believe it's possible for us to take our ethos and our model through the world and to the
[01:21:04] Brett Kelly: world and win in these markets researching Australian businesses have grown globally it was clear to
[01:21:10] Brett Kelly: me that if this CEO didn't leave by moving it couldn't and wouldn't happen and so that's you know
[01:21:17] Brett Kelly: that's what we're on about um ripet mertox a device if it not necessarily popular figure everywhere it
[01:21:23] Brett Kelly: goes but he did build the world's largest media empire he is Australian and he did did that by moving
[01:21:30] Brett Kelly: first from Adelaide to Melbourne and then from Melbourne to London and then from London to the US
[01:21:34] Brett Kelly: he's a useful case study in that respect and so we're just following you know try to walk in the
[01:21:41] Brett Kelly: steps of giant stand on the shoulder of giants learn from people who are much smarter and
[01:21:46] Brett Kelly: wise are and deeper and broader than I am and you know with a lot of effort bunch of elbow grease
[01:21:53] Brett Kelly: we think that it's possible that we can um you know do okay over time now I'm known to
[01:22:02] Brett Kelly: under promise and over deliver I've promised our shareholders that I think we can grow 5% organic
[01:22:09] Brett Kelly: and 5% acquisition essentially forever
[01:22:13] Brett Kelly: it is unlikely that the tax system is going to disappear and don't kid yourself that AI is
[01:22:20] Brett Kelly: going to put us out of business because tax law is not code it is made by words and then it is
[01:22:28] Brett Kelly: fought about in courts for decades and it is never settled and so it is unable in complex private
[01:22:35] Brett Kelly: groups that we look after to be eradicated with AI so very superficial observation although AI
[01:22:42] Brett Kelly: and all technology is always built our organizations Australian tax act is grown at 13% by a number of
[01:22:49] Brett Kelly: pages per annum for 50 years and the US tax act would be similar the proportion of lawyers in
[01:22:56] Brett Kelly: Congress the proportion of lawyers in Parliament's around the world is higher today than it ever has
[01:23:01] Brett Kelly: been and lawyers love to make laws and they never get rid of the ones that they made yesterday
[01:23:07] Brett Kelly: and so we think that we're on a big macro mega trend we're in a market that we expect to continue
[01:23:14] Brett Kelly: for as long as human life itself continues death in taxes and we think we are excellent at our
[01:23:21] Brett Kelly: tiny circle of components which is operating accounting firms for private business owners in the
[01:23:27] Brett Kelly: two to ten million dollar range I think we're as well read as anyone committed to being lifelong
[01:23:34] Brett Kelly: lawyers and we're radically committed to execution and so if we keep at it we're probably do okay
[01:23:44] Brett Kelly: and we're honest and transparent which is you know a lot more than you can hope for with
[01:23:51] Brett Kelly: many people have stumbled across over the years so I love to get good feedback but encourage
[01:23:56] Brett Kelly: people to do the work you're not going to find a hundred bagger because it came and sat in your lap
[01:24:02] Brett Kelly: you're going to have to do some work as a company we've tried to make that as easy as we can for you
[01:24:08] Brett Kelly: and I'd be more than happy at any time Clay to do a Q&A and and to get some questions what we
[01:24:14] Brett Kelly: typically do with investors we get them to email us we get a list of questions we answer them with
[01:24:20] Brett Kelly: all things we've already published and we hope to find one or two pearls of wisdom that we have
[01:24:25] Brett Kelly: never thought of and essentially our investors we've treated as partners and regard them as partners
[01:24:32] Brett Kelly: who continue to use their incredible brain power to improve our business
[01:24:38] Brett Kelly: and it's a very efficient model because we don't have to pay them anything for their excellent
[01:24:42] Brett Kelly: consulting so that's the mindset I really appreciate you spending the time with me today and I
[01:24:49] Brett Kelly: hope that helps people better understand what we're on about. Well great thanks so much Brad
[01:24:56] Clay (Host): I really look forward to watching the journey continue to unfold and watch out it all plays out
[01:25:03] Clay (Host): and it's going to be fun to you know you're 49 today and you mentioned the 25 year journey and
[01:25:11] it reminds me I just interviewed Andrew Brinton a few months ago and he just crossed his 25 year mark
[01:25:17] Clay (Host): in being an investment manager and he said the same thing I'm looking forward to the next 25 years
[01:25:22] Clay (Host): so it's wonderful to get to be able to speak with amazing people and follow their journey as well
[01:25:28] I appreciate it Claire really do I thank you there has been a lot of investors from all over the
[01:25:34] SPEAKER_00: world actually that have been interested in knowing more about tech now and investing and tech now
[01:25:39] SPEAKER_00: but we have very little free float there is very little stock that is trading every day which
[01:25:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm happy about because I think it means that we have shareholders that are interested in being part
[01:25:52] SPEAKER_00: of this slow term rodents and speculating and trading over our reports
