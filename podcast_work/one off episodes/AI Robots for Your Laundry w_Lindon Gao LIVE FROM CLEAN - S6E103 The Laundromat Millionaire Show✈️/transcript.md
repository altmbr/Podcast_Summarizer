[00:00:00] Hello, welcome to the Clean Show. This is David Carleman from Laundra Bat Millionaire and we are coming live from the Dyna Robotics booth.
[00:00:11] Host or Interviewer: If you are at the Clean Show, you need to come and check this out. We are at the 867.
[00:00:17] Host or Interviewer: I'm here with us. We have Lyndon Gaff and Dyna Robotics. And we have Craig Taylor, one of the first Dyna Robotics users.
[00:00:26] Host or Interviewer: So today we're going to be learning all about these folding robots. They look amazing. So you definitely want to catch this.
[00:00:33] David Carleman: Yeah, I got to tell you guys, I've been telling you for a couple of years now. This was coming, right? Now I didn't know Lyndon. I didn't know the Dyna team, but I told you robotics is coming. We all knew AI was coming.
[00:00:45] David Carleman: They've combined. They're here and we are excited to click off, kick off the Clean Show live from all of our channels across the platform of Laundra Bat Millionaire to show you what this is all about.
[00:00:56] David Carleman: And like I told Lyndon before we got online, the truth is a little selfishly. I'm curious because I got like a million questions for these guys.
[00:01:04] David Carleman: Craig is using the robot. If we're going to call it that the Dyna robot in his store right now. So we're going to ask Craig a few questions. We're going to let Lyndon tell us about his baby, right?
[00:01:15] David Carleman: And we're going to show you live what it's about. So if you're not at the Clean Show, you're going to get a sneak peek of what it looks like to be out the show and get to see one of the coolest exhibits in the entire show.
[00:01:26] Hello and welcome to another episode of the Laundra Bat Millionaire shows sponsored by HM Company at DreamTross.com.
[00:01:35] David Carleman: The future of laundry technology is here today guys. This is a tool to help us augment our staff's ability to do a new wash drive.
[00:01:44] Host or Interviewer: First, Lyndon, can you tell us a little bit about this company? First off, what in the world made you want to go into creating laundry robots?
[00:01:54] Well, this is a very, very good question. So a little bit of a mystery about myself. Start of first, my first company, Wild Sports, set it all on that way.
[00:02:04] David Carleman: Oh, no, no. What did he show off? I was figuring out business places. I was four, right?
[00:02:12] Lindon Gao: And my third company is Paul Tipper. We started building smart shopping cart. You know these physical shopping carts.
[00:02:20] Lindon Gao: We took cameras and set a few of them, compact it into a shopping cart such that you could just put anything you want into the cart.
[00:02:26] Lindon Gao: And it will automatically check you out and then you can rightfully need a grocery store. So the company is called Kipper.
[00:02:34] Lindon Gao: I built the company for about six years and we sold it to InstaCart in 2021 and sold it for a lot of money.
[00:02:42] Lindon Gao: But the most important thing is that the carts are now everywhere across New Jersey, Ohio, California.
[00:02:49] Lindon Gao: And it really gets anywhere that you can make them.
[00:02:52] Lindon Gao: And now, so I joined InstaCart for about three years. I was a big fan of engineering there. And guys, I started dining robotics when the way it really took off.
[00:03:02] Lindon Gao: It's a really, really interesting piece about AI is that first, it started as a language model. So a lot of you guys probably got some exposure to it during when opening our release chat.
[00:03:12] Lindon Gao: That was a very magical moment, right? And over time, the model evolved via multi model, where you're able to start using images and speech and everything else in there.
[00:03:24] Lindon Gao: And the models is what's off to you is if to show you videos and generate images, but one thing has to have a lot if it's physical AI.
[00:03:33] Lindon Gao: And which is how do we bring AI into the physical world such that it actually had value to humanity at large.
[00:03:40] Lindon Gao: So that was really one thought one really huge opportunity opportunity that I thought we should catch you see.
[00:03:46] Lindon Gao: So I came out here, started a book out of the company with two other people and we decide that we were going to change that we want to automate a lot of the manual things that people don't want to do in their daily life.
[00:03:59] Lindon Gao: So I went out there and I spoke to hundreds of different customers across various industries.
[00:04:05] Lindon Gao: So there are people in better with technology and manufacturing warehouse logistics, hospitality and so forth.
[00:04:12] Lindon Gao: But the one demographic that stood out the most was the overall overall laundry industry.
[00:04:18] Lindon Gao: And the laundry industry isn't just the laundry mat. It's not all owners. It's also the restaurant owner.
[00:04:24] Lindon Gao: So yeah, and it's talking to them. Their number one case point has always consistently been holding.
[00:04:30] Lindon Gao: I remember I was close to one of our earlier customers and they mentioned that holding is the biggest pain point.
[00:04:38] Lindon Gao: And if we are able to automate holding, we have a license.
[00:04:41] Lindon Gao: One, we're not looking for, you know, and right now what we're thinking about is that this is this could actually be very bright and awful for laundry industry.
[00:04:50] Lindon Gao: So we decided that one of our first applications to be soft body manipulation.
[00:04:54] Lindon Gao: It has manipulating clothing fabrics and the night. So that's that that's how it comes.
[00:04:59] Lindon Gao: So is that one of the harder challenges to do in a I robotics? I would think it would be.
[00:05:05] Lindon Gao: Yes, it's actually one of the very, very most difficult challenges because soft body manipulations, very different heart body.
[00:05:12] Lindon Gao: Where in a rigid object, you only have limited set of orientations and states that the object needed.
[00:05:19] Lindon Gao: So maybe if you have a cube, there is only six different ways in which you could flip it.
[00:05:23] Lindon Gao: But for a soft body like a cow, there's a deforms in so it could, you know, it could be stuck in any particular format.
[00:05:30] Lindon Gao: And the model needs to be smart enough to navigate itself out of that format such that it could become a foldable state.
[00:05:37] Lindon Gao: So that is one of the biggest, biggest challenges that we've been able to solve.
[00:05:41] Whether you already have a laundromat or looking to get into the laundry industry, everyone needs proper drainage.
[00:05:48] Host or Interviewer: We use HM company drain trots. Their drain trots were first created in 1991 and they have been the leading drain trot manufacturer ever since.
[00:05:59] Host or Interviewer: They're made in the USA and their drain trots are fully customizable to meet your needs.
[00:06:05] Host or Interviewer: That's why we've used them ever since entering the industry. They're easy to clean for our staff and plenty sturdy when we need to walk on them when servicing our washers.
[00:06:15] With the ability to span up to 25 feet, our trots rarely need to be connected together, creating an easy installation.
[00:06:23] Host or Interviewer: Want to slope your trot like we do? No problem. Just let the experts at HM company know.
[00:06:30] Host or Interviewer: For more information, go to their website at draintrots.com. That is drain trots.com.
[00:06:39] Host or Interviewer: HM company drain trots. They've been leading the industry since 1991. Check them out today.
[00:06:47] Wow. This idea tells a question, but how is A.O. Robotics different than another robot?
[00:06:55] Host or Interviewer: Like you said, because it can problem solve and get itself out of a situation. It's also like, do you train the robot?
[00:07:02] Host or Interviewer: Like we were to buy these robots. We have to train it.
[00:07:06] This is a really good question. How are the A.O. Robotics work? That's very different from traditional machines.
[00:07:15] Lindon Gao: It's not traditional machines are programmed on traditional rules. What that means is the entire machine is programmed on an if statement.
[00:07:24] Lindon Gao: So let's say in a typical machine is the food press button A that will do action B.
[00:07:30] Lindon Gao: If you press button C, it will do action B. But then if there's any outside of that parameters, it wouldn't be able to execute.
[00:07:37] Lindon Gao: But a power robot is very very different. It's able to take such situational environment contacts, audit contacts, and actually manipulate that based on the context of long.
[00:07:49] Lindon Gao: So how it works is the law similar to humans versus traditional machines. It's just a machine. It's like your coffee machine cannot dinner for you.
[00:07:58] Lindon Gao: So that's a really, really big difference. And the really like big breakthrough here is that we're potentially leveraging human loved one,
[00:08:05] Lindon Gao: and then you'll be able to learn gradually by itself. So over a period of just the last three months that model by itself,
[00:08:14] Lindon Gao: actually drastically. And they wanted to train the machines actually it starts with data. So data is like knowledge.
[00:08:20] Lindon Gao: Sure. Right. So humans for us, then you know, reading books, you know, talking to people, watching videos, and that's how we're like in the robot in a very similar way is we leverage data.
[00:08:32] Lindon Gao: So with an update data that's collected on the robot to teach the robot to actually learn.
[00:08:40] Lindon Gao: Wow. So you do train it you being dine up, you're trying it to give it some knowledge base. Yes.
[00:08:47] David Carleman: And then every time it folds, it learns more than a few of the time before. Yes, using a lot.
[00:08:54] David Carleman: And so if you guys are wondering, just a second, I know you can see these robots, five, they got three of them set up.
[00:08:59] David Carleman: We're going to go over to one of them in a few minutes, and we're going to show you what it looks like. And maybe you can tell us a little bit about the design.
[00:09:04] David Carleman: I do probably cats and all this stuff. Don't share anything you know what everybody know.
[00:09:09] David Carleman: But we're pretty excited about that. Before we move over there, Craig, you're a lot about.
[00:09:14] David Carleman: I think I'm quite a friend of ours. That is your work shop. You are doing something really amazing with monster laundry.
[00:09:20] David Carleman: And you're, did you say miles up the road? Is that correct? We're miles up the road from Dina.
[00:09:25] Craig Taylor: Okay. I just one thing you said, a licensed to print money. If you can take over that folding process.
[00:09:32] Craig Taylor: The biggest bottleneck we have in the laundry wash dry fold process is the actual folding.
[00:09:38] Craig Taylor: Because you throw in the washer 25 minutes later, it's done.
[00:09:41] Craig Taylor: Goes over to the dryer, maybe a half hour. You've done.
[00:09:44] Craig Taylor: And you've got this big pile of clothing. And it's painful.
[00:09:48] Craig Taylor: Our our staff at monster laundry spent a lot of time just folding.
[00:09:53] Craig Taylor: And what Dina robotics does for us is gives us the augmented ability to go through that process step.
[00:09:59] Craig Taylor: You just hand at the toes and out the other side comes these beautiful folded stacks that are attendance and take package up and they go out for our commercial clients.
[00:10:09] Craig Taylor: So I. It's an amazing step forward. How long have you had it in your store?
[00:10:14] Craig Taylor: About a month and a half. But yeah. And we're already covering six of our commercial clients really are being.
[00:10:20] Craig Taylor: You know, sold it. Okay. So if I'm sitting at home or I'm even at the show watching this live.
[00:10:25] David Carleman: One of the questions I have is can it leave old towels? Maybe I'll ask you that.
[00:10:29] David Carleman: Well, no, I can't find anything that I could be imagined. So there is.
[00:10:34] David Carleman: I'm going to I'm going to push push back. So for either any limitations to what I can do.
[00:10:39] David Carleman: As far as folding laundry as far as folding laundry. No, but I think the one thing I cannot do is turn it closed inside out.
[00:10:48] Lindon Gao: That's probably there. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's pretty important as we know.
[00:10:52] David Carleman: Well, it's able to. I mean,
[00:10:55] Host or Interviewer: see the laundry and determine what type it is and how to fold it or to you.
[00:11:00] Host or Interviewer: So you don't have to tell it. Oh, this is a kids shirt versus this is a pair of.
[00:11:05] Host or Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah. What the item is. So.
[00:11:08] Host or Interviewer: It's a sort of laundry too. Yes. I mean, there's sort of right there.
[00:11:12] Lindon Gao: Wow. This is okay. I'm going to pass the place.
[00:11:17] David Carleman: Now, I do want to say so. Craig, I know yours is even out in your facility.
[00:11:21] Host or Interviewer: Where your self serve customers see it. Absolutely.
[00:11:24] Host or Interviewer: Uh, behind you have like a barrier. Yeah.
[00:11:27] Host or Interviewer: Interact with it. But what kind of reaction have you got?
[00:11:30] Craig Taylor: We've gotten things from people kind of going, oh, no, to other.
[00:11:34] Craig Taylor: Most people, the reaction is. Wow. What's that?
[00:11:38] Craig Taylor: They immediately went out their phone. They're taking videos of it, sharing with their friends.
[00:11:43] Craig Taylor: It is groundbreaking. This is a technologically major future step for laundry.
[00:11:49] Craig Taylor: This is what we always knew was coming, but it's not coming anymore.
[00:11:53] Thanks to the doc. I'll see you.
[00:11:55] David Carleman: Here it is. Yeah. So one question I have before we go over to the robot.
[00:11:59] David Carleman: It does seem to fold pretty slow.
[00:12:02] David Carleman: If I compare that to my people, which granted they are amazing and they've been doing this three years, it's pretty slow.
[00:12:08] David Carleman: But it doesn't take breaks or you don't have to pay a waste.
[00:12:11] Host or Interviewer: For sure. But there's definitely some benefits.
[00:12:14] David Carleman: But one of my questions is, will it speed up and another in a side question that is,
[00:12:19] David Carleman: will it speed up as it gets better? Is that what is waiting on?
[00:12:23] David Carleman: Okay. Yes. So what more data does collect it? Right?
[00:12:26] Lindon Gao: It will speed up by itself. And that's a really, really magical thing.
[00:12:31] Lindon Gao: So like when we started, there's a napkin told me use days that we had.
[00:12:36] Lindon Gao: So when we started, we started our general group of AWA is, I don't know, maybe like a hundred day, which was really slow.
[00:12:44] Lindon Gao: And over a period of about three to four weeks, they got to about 600 and by the eight weeks, it's 150.
[00:12:53] Lindon Gao: And now fast forward to today, we're doing about two and a two thousand five hundred per day.
[00:13:01] So you were initially a hundred, yeah, a hundred days to speed by 25.
[00:13:05] Lindon Gao: Yes. So that's pretty good. So the AI by itself actually looks for ways to improve us all because the ultimate goal is to fold it with high quality at a high group.
[00:13:16] Lindon Gao: But so that is the goal. And that's this sole purpose.
[00:13:19] Lindon Gao: Imagine if you're a sole purpose all day is to get to a certain amount of food fun and quality.
[00:13:24] Lindon Gao: It's just going to drastically get better open out. Okay.
[00:13:27] Yeah, I think that's a good point on quality.
[00:13:30] Craig Taylor: It needs to be folded properly for the monster way. We have a monster way folding.
[00:13:35] Craig Taylor: And if it's not, it doesn't look good and look good in the packages. That's not good.
[00:13:40] Craig Taylor: That's a good boy. Correct. Can it package laundry?
[00:13:43] You know what that means, but yes, put it in the bag and see a lead.
[00:13:48] Lindon Gao: Yes, yes, that's slightly a little more difficult, but yeah, it's doable as well. Okay.
[00:13:54] Okay. So Craig, honest assessment, how do you feel about the quality of the folds?
[00:14:00] Host or Interviewer: They are adequate. I think they think that's a matter of time in more iterations, more trained.
[00:14:08] Craig Taylor: So it's going to get better and better over a month that we've watching this thing.
[00:14:12] Craig Taylor: It is absolutely true. Is your robot run 24 7 or no?
[00:14:17] Craig Taylor: You need the volume to do exactly. So you have to feed it.
[00:14:21] Craig Taylor: And then you have to pull the materials off. So there is that's a little bit of bottleneck.
[00:14:27] Craig Taylor: They can be solved in various ways.
[00:14:29] Craig Taylor: So you have to provide it with a basket on each side of the robot to pull out of.
[00:14:36] David Carleman: And it runs out. It just sits there and wait for you to feed more.
[00:14:40] Craig Taylor: Yeah. And so that may in a longer environment. That's obviously washer, dryer, and then the dryer load goes to the robot.
[00:14:47] Craig Taylor: Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. Well, guys, it wants to go see a robot.
[00:14:51] Would you like to make more money from your laundromat?
[00:14:54] Would you like those machines you're paying for to have more turns per day?
[00:15:00] Do you offer wash dry fold services or pick up and delivery laundry services?
[00:15:06] If not, would you like to?
[00:15:09] Whether you do or not, we have an amazing opportunity for you in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:15:15] Yeah, you've probably heard about it, guys, but it's our wash dry fold pickup and delivery workshop.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_06: And to answer your first question, yes, it is for drop off laundry, wash dry fold, and pickup and delivery.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_06: If you're doing any of those things, this workshop is going to help you tremendously.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_06: But the truth is, we were pretty so, so laundromat owners and so, so successful until we launch drop off laundry and pick up and delivery.
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_06: And being able to what I call optimize your laundromat to generate more profit and more revenue out of the existing facility, that's the key to taking your life from good to great financially speaking with laundromats.
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_06: And that's what made us laundromat millionaires.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_06: You don't have to just listen to us.
[00:15:55] Host or Interviewer: Listen to what some of our past attendees have to say about our wash dry fold pick up and delivery workshop in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:16:02] Host or Interviewer: It was the best workshop I've attended in over 25 years.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_00: And what you guys have put together is nothing short of phenomenal.
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: I think that you guys have put together both strategic and tactical systems that will make an individual who wants to own the laundromat profitable within months, not years.
[00:16:26] It was a workshop worth investment without a doubt, it was definitely worth the investment.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_01: So not only did we have two very packed days with Dave, Carla and their team, both in the classroom and during the facilities.
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_01: But we also came away with this extensive 100 page handbook.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_01: And then after the workshop was completed, I received a bunch of electronic performers and templates that we've been able to use since the workshop.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_01: Every day since the workshop I found myself preferring back to either those up to electronic tools or to ample per receive.
[00:17:07] Was it worth the investment? Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_03: I cannot say that enough.
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_03: This was such a blessing and I am so very grateful that Dave and Carla put this together and are sharing their knowledge and experience with others to have this to have this to grow their business and to become more successful.
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_03: Thank you guys.
[00:17:29] Host or Interviewer: So are you interested? Go to laundromatmillionaire.com to learn more and see where you can register.
[00:17:36] Host or Interviewer: All right, so London, tell us about your baby that doesn't have a name.
[00:17:41] David Carleman: What is that?
[00:17:42] David Carleman: Okay, we named ours Sophie.
[00:17:44] David Carleman: So, so she's really awesome.
[00:17:47] David Carleman: Yeah, Swiss folding robot.
[00:17:49] David Carleman: So, this is what she says right now.
[00:17:51] David Carleman: They just called Diana, which is cool.
[00:17:53] David Carleman: But tell us about this and if it makes a mistake, tell us about that too.
[00:17:57] Lindon Gao: Yeah, so basically, so this robot has a pair of arms with six degrees of freedom.
[00:18:04] Lindon Gao: So, from the bottom of the joy, all the way to the gripper has six different degrees of freedom where I operate however, like on the flat surface.
[00:18:13] Lindon Gao: So, the robot is retrofitted with about 53 to five different cameras depending on how you look at it.
[00:18:21] Lindon Gao: So, okay, here you have one scrapping and two two different robots on the wrist.
[00:18:29] Lindon Gao: And then there's one on top here at two right down here.
[00:18:33] Lindon Gao: And that's all that's all the robot needs.
[00:18:36] Lindon Gao: All the robot needs is really just those cameras and it's making up decisions from the five.
[00:18:40] Lindon Gao: Okay, so I might have missed that.
[00:18:42] David Carleman: Say that again, there's a camera on each end of the arm.
[00:18:44] Lindon Gao: Yes, there's a camera through there.
[00:18:46] And there's a camera down low.
[00:18:48] Yes, okay, wow.
[00:18:50] Lindon Gao: Wow, I'd expect that as well.
[00:18:52] Host or Interviewer: So, right now, I see like trying to figure out what the article of clothing is and then just get it smooth.
[00:18:58] Lindon Gao: Yes, so it's looking for ways to find a find the towel.
[00:19:02] Lindon Gao: So, and that's that's traditionally a very very different ball of individual box right?
[00:19:07] Lindon Gao: Because it's all it's nearly impossible to take a plumble towel.
[00:19:11] Lindon Gao: Yeah, yeah, I think we as humans kind of take for granted that that we do that so often and have since birth.
[00:19:22] David Carleman: You know, at home or whatever, how the dexterity I guess I would call that is that a fair yes, like I think we take for granted how easy that is to do.
[00:19:31] David Carleman: Because we are humans, but we're rather advanced.
[00:19:35] David Carleman: And so for a robot to do that is pretty impressive.
[00:19:37] David Carleman: Oh, is he trying to stack?
[00:19:39] David Carleman: I was just going to say is he going to stack them?
[00:19:41] David Carleman: Yes.
[00:19:42] Now, I'm pretty sure I know the answer to this, but what if I wanted Diana to fold that in half again?
[00:19:47] David Carleman: And I wanted it to be in more of a square than a rectangle.
[00:19:49] David Carleman: That's perfectly fine.
[00:19:51] David Carleman: Craig has six different towels and that's okay.
[00:19:54] David Carleman: Yeah, that's all part of the programming.
[00:19:57] David Carleman: So, me or Craig get a new client comes in.
[00:20:00] David Carleman: Let's let's me silly here and say they have a triangle shaped towel or whatever, right?
[00:20:04] David Carleman: And we got a we got a start from scratch with Diana.
[00:20:07] David Carleman: How how hard is that to do?
[00:20:10] David Carleman: And if it's Craig now, I know you guys are only a few miles away.
[00:20:13] David Carleman: Do you guys zip over there and do that?
[00:20:15] David Carleman: Or does Craig you train the real bother?
[00:20:18] David Carleman: How's that? How's that work?
[00:20:19] David Carleman: Once I get it, I'm a year in and it does a bunch of things, but I get this new client.
[00:20:24] David Carleman: Yeah, what does that look like?
[00:20:25] Lindon Gao: So right now at the moment, we actually have some of what's like the data.
[00:20:30] Lindon Gao: They'll basically tell you operating the robots and the robot will learn.
[00:20:34] Lindon Gao: Okay, and then from the data, then the robots will be directly adapt to it.
[00:20:38] Lindon Gao: So any types of fold any type of fabric, we could do as long as you guys give us the SLP.
[00:20:44] Lindon Gao: And then from here, that's only being the finished product, the finished product.
[00:20:48] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:20:50] Lindon Gao: In the future, we'll actually directly learn it within our labs.
[00:20:53] Lindon Gao: So that what we give it to you, it will directly be a boss.
[00:20:56] Lindon Gao: You'll probably have a you'll be exactly and you'll be able to pick what have a full you want.
[00:21:00] Lindon Gao: I've called how how an garment that you want to be folded.
[00:21:03] Lindon Gao: I've been always just learned by myself. Wow.
[00:21:05] Host or Interviewer: How long has this actually been like released to the market at this point?
[00:21:09] Host or Interviewer: So right now it's fairly on the slows, but no, but we're we're live in restaurants.
[00:21:18] Lindon Gao: We're live in Lodromeats.
[00:21:20] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:21:21] Lindon Gao: We're also live in fitness centers.
[00:21:23] Lindon Gao: So we are curl as as we're pushing the boundaries of folding where obvious are missions to get this to full faster and you environments and also different types of barfits.
[00:21:34] Lindon Gao: Get a lot better at that.
[00:21:35] Lindon Gao: Have you ever thought about having so our our process here is that you are folding you split fold works.
[00:21:42] Host or Interviewer: You know what those are.
[00:21:43] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:21:44] Host or Interviewer: What about having and do the slip over?
[00:21:46] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:21:47] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:21:48] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:21:49] Lindon Gao: It's we have we haven't because that's an easier way.
[00:21:52] Lindon Gao: That's a solution.
[00:21:53] Lindon Gao: That's a cop out way.
[00:21:57] Lindon Gao: You're not.
[00:21:59] Lindon Gao: We wanted to deal legitimately.
[00:22:01] Lindon Gao: But yes, we could do.
[00:22:02] Lindon Gao: We could have to use as so you can train.
[00:22:04] David Carleman: Died to use a flip fold board in the same way that we trained a new team member because when they come on for us.
[00:22:10] David Carleman: Yes.
[00:22:11] David Carleman: We train them on a flip fold board and then what we tell our team is once you get to a certain speed.
[00:22:16] David Carleman: Once you get to a certain quality with the folding board.
[00:22:19] David Carleman: Then you have the right permission to withdraw from the band in the folding board and what we call free fold.
[00:22:25] David Carleman: Oh, you have to prove yourself.
[00:22:27] David Carleman: No.
[00:22:28] David Carleman: The folding board of quality and speed.
[00:22:30] David Carleman: Okay.
[00:22:31] David Carleman: Before you have to earn the right to get rid of it.
[00:22:33] David Carleman: And it's because it's the consistent.
[00:22:35] David Carleman: I said every product.
[00:22:36] David Carleman: I just think it would make him consistent faster.
[00:22:39] Host or Interviewer: It does for our workers.
[00:22:41] Host or Interviewer: It does.
[00:22:42] Lindon Gao: For sure.
[00:22:43] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:22:44] Lindon Gao: Maybe I should.
[00:22:45] Lindon Gao: I should show that to you for before it gets first the right to people by itself.
[00:22:49] Lindon Gao: Exactly.
[00:22:50] David Carleman: So I'm sure we have a million more questions.
[00:22:52] David Carleman: But one of them I notice and you probably can't see from the camera.
[00:22:55] David Carleman: Is that it's on wheels.
[00:22:56] David Carleman: Now I don't see it moving other than the arms.
[00:22:59] David Carleman: Can it or will it or am I getting ahead of myself in a few months and a few months.
[00:23:04] David Carleman: I love it.
[00:23:05] Lindon Gao: You will be able to see it will be around.
[00:23:07] Lindon Gao: Nice.
[00:23:08] Lindon Gao: And that would that's when it will be able to pick up laundry from your dryers and
[00:23:12] Lindon Gao: correctly bring it to exit on.
[00:23:14] David Carleman: I was just getting ready to say that.
[00:23:15] David Carleman: I'll be able to load a washer.
[00:23:17] David Carleman: Yes.
[00:23:18] David Carleman: Like, will it be able to I'm just going to keep rule.
[00:23:20] David Carleman: I'll be able to.
[00:23:21] David Carleman: Okay.
[00:23:22] David Carleman: I'll be able to read a laundry ticket.
[00:23:23] David Carleman: And what I mean by that is.
[00:23:24] David Carleman: The way that we process thousands pounds every day.
[00:23:27] David Carleman: Is we have what we call.
[00:23:30] David Carleman: You know, we've already done something like, uh, ownership of the order, but we also have fully customizable.
[00:23:35] David Carleman: That means every order the way our customers want the way they would.
[00:23:40] David Carleman: Every order is unique and different.
[00:23:41] David Carleman: And of course, as it comes in whether it's drop off or pick up and delivery, it has a ticket.
[00:23:46] David Carleman: The prints out from our POS, right?
[00:23:48] David Carleman: Can I read the ticket?
[00:23:49] David Carleman: And no.
[00:23:50] David Carleman: I want the full two.
[00:23:52] Lindon Gao: So the thing about what we call this called
[00:23:55] Lindon Gao: foundation model robotics, where we actually
[00:23:57] Lindon Gao: in leverage very sophisticated AI models to do this,
[00:24:01] Lindon Gao: the only thing that could do anything
[00:24:03] Lindon Gao: that you imagine that you imagine.
[00:24:05] Lindon Gao: There's no limits to the imagination
[00:24:06] Lindon Gao: of what this can do.
[00:24:07] Lindon Gao: Exactly.
[00:24:08] Lindon Gao: So it's all the only limitation to this is hardware.
[00:24:12] Lindon Gao: Say that again, it's hardware, hardware.
[00:24:14] Lindon Gao: So hardware capabilities is what limits it.
[00:24:16] Lindon Gao: So like, for example, if you need something
[00:24:18] Lindon Gao: that requires fingers, like, for example,
[00:24:21] Lindon Gao: one very difficult thing that we can do,
[00:24:23] Lindon Gao: but we don't do very often as rolling, right?
[00:24:27] That's why we're busted.
[00:24:29] Lindon Gao: Yes, that gets we busted for some
[00:24:31] Lindon Gao: of our clients.
[00:24:32] Lindon Gao: That is quite difficult.
[00:24:35] Lindon Gao: It can do it, but it doesn't do it very well.
[00:24:37] Lindon Gao: Yeah, so that's the only limitation.
[00:24:39] Lindon Gao: But beyond that, it's just a pair of pants.
[00:24:40] Lindon Gao: So anything that can match up,
[00:24:42] Lindon Gao: pair of pants can do this robot can do as well.
[00:24:45] Lindon Gao: So that's the really exciting part.
[00:24:47] Lindon Gao: Can you just answer those?
[00:24:48] Lindon Gao: Oh my gosh.
[00:24:49] Lindon Gao: Can I do this?
[00:24:50] Lindon Gao: Can I do this?
[00:24:51] David Carleman: Maybe the tips.
[00:24:52] David Carleman: Maybe the tips would have to be different
[00:24:55] Host or Interviewer: where it has a barcode that basically gives them
[00:24:58] Host or Interviewer: all the information for that order.
[00:25:00] Host or Interviewer: Where they read it differently.
[00:25:02] Host or Interviewer: They're not reading like,
[00:25:02] Host or Interviewer: are people read like a printout of English?
[00:25:06] Host or Interviewer: It just has a barcode.
[00:25:07] Host or Interviewer: It knows it's order number 162.
[00:25:09] Host or Interviewer: And this is what I do.
[00:25:10] Host or Interviewer: That's right.
[00:25:11] David Carleman: OK, now I'm going to get nerdy or more nerdy.
[00:25:15] David Carleman: Do you think someday there's a possibility
[00:25:18] David Carleman: of integrating this into the software that we use?
[00:25:22] David Carleman: Like we use that software.
[00:25:24] David Carleman: There's like 10 different companies out there
[00:25:25] David Carleman: and use this herb side.
[00:25:27] David Carleman: That's right.
[00:25:28] David Carleman: And you probably know about these people already, right?
[00:25:30] David Carleman: In the industry, could you see a day, of course,
[00:25:33] David Carleman: with their cooperation where you can have an API integration
[00:25:36] David Carleman: with this where it can look and know order number 3258D
[00:25:39] David Carleman: is a cold wash, tide detergent, medium dry,
[00:25:46] David Carleman: you know, eat dry or whatever.
[00:25:47] Lindon Gao: Yes.
[00:25:48] Lindon Gao: So basically how the robot operates
[00:25:50] Lindon Gao: is I actually take language command.
[00:25:52] Lindon Gao: So it takes natural language commands.
[00:25:53] Lindon Gao: We actually did that top-top.
[00:25:54] Lindon Gao: I just set it up here.
[00:25:56] Lindon Gao: But you can actually tell it what to do.
[00:25:58] Lindon Gao: So that's the early and majorly.
[00:26:00] Lindon Gao: Yes, verbally.
[00:26:01] Lindon Gao: So that's something that will be showcasing very soon.
[00:26:04] Lindon Gao: Wow.
[00:26:05] Lindon Gao: That's day two of the clean show, right?
[00:26:06] Lindon Gao: That's the top.
[00:26:08] Lindon Gao: But by next year, you don't talk to your AI
[00:26:09] Lindon Gao: or tell you you could just talk to the robot.
[00:26:11] Lindon Gao: You could just tell it what to do.
[00:26:12] Lindon Gao: Yes.
[00:26:13] Lindon Gao: So by that sense, from your perspective,
[00:26:16] Lindon Gao: in the API format, yeah.
[00:26:18] Lindon Gao: So basically, it's just connecting to the APIs
[00:26:20] Lindon Gao: of these other software companies.
[00:26:22] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:26:22] Lindon Gao: And from these software companies,
[00:26:24] Lindon Gao: they'll just directly give us command
[00:26:25] Lindon Gao: of what it wants to robot.
[00:26:27] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:26:27] Lindon Gao: So that's, yes.
[00:26:29] Lindon Gao: So now that for five years,
[00:26:31] Lindon Gao: it's not that far off.
[00:26:32] Lindon Gao: It's cooperation, of course.
[00:26:34] Lindon Gao: And in a few months, we'll be showcasing how
[00:26:35] Lindon Gao: we'll help us to do the things in work.
[00:26:38] Lindon Gao: Very, very simple.
[00:26:39] Lindon Gao: So just for about the year,
[00:26:41] Host or Interviewer: it's next to the end of the towels.
[00:26:43] Host or Interviewer: All the towels are the same size.
[00:26:46] Host or Interviewer: But you've been up random objects
[00:26:49] Host or Interviewer: and what it'd be able to hold them.
[00:26:52] Yes.
[00:26:53] Lindon Gao: So in the case of random objects, for example,
[00:26:57] Lindon Gao: we have done it in, we have tried
[00:27:00] Lindon Gao: this between a mixture of napkins,
[00:27:02] Lindon Gao: mixture of shirts and all that stuff.
[00:27:04] Lindon Gao: So it would be able to learn to actually
[00:27:07] Lindon Gao: fold the various different napkins,
[00:27:09] Lindon Gao: as well as you guys give us that so keys.
[00:27:11] Lindon Gao: OK.
[00:27:12] Lindon Gao: So yes.
[00:27:13] Lindon Gao: OK.
[00:27:14] David Carleman: So Craig, I'm curious.
[00:27:15] David Carleman: Yes.
[00:27:15] David Carleman: You had this in your store for 15,
[00:27:18] David Carleman: sorry, six weeks, month and a half, roughly, about that time.
[00:27:22] David Carleman: Yes.
[00:27:22] David Carleman: You have a pretty good grasp on what it can do.
[00:27:25] David Carleman: One question, have you seen it improve in those six weeks?
[00:27:30] David Carleman: Absolutely.
[00:27:31] David Carleman: And what's an example or two?
[00:27:32] Craig Taylor: We have a video of it pulling a towel out,
[00:27:37] and then it folded it.
[00:27:39] Craig Taylor: But one of the corners was underneath.
[00:27:42] Craig Taylor: And it kept trying to grab.
[00:27:44] Craig Taylor: And it was like, I can't get that quarter.
[00:27:47] Craig Taylor: And then it went in and it grabbed the fold,
[00:27:50] Craig Taylor: and it slipped it over, and then got the tab of the edge,
[00:27:53] Craig Taylor: and lifted up, flipped it, folded it, and it was done.
[00:27:57] Craig Taylor: But I was like incredible.
[00:27:59] Craig Taylor: That it was.
[00:28:00] Craig Taylor: That's your every time I look over here,
[00:28:01] Host or Interviewer: you get the golf smooth.
[00:28:02] Host or Interviewer: I'm like, oh, my god.
[00:28:05] That's the mom and the teacher.
[00:28:06] David Carleman: I know.
[00:28:08] Host or Interviewer: Do what to praise, everybody.
[00:28:09] David Carleman: Does it recognize praise?
[00:28:12] Lindon Gao: Of course, my head doesn't.
[00:28:13] Lindon Gao: But I love having a reward model where
[00:28:14] Lindon Gao: if it's doing the right thing,
[00:28:15] Lindon Gao: where it gets all reward.
[00:28:17] Lindon Gao: Oh, really?
[00:28:18] Lindon Gao: What's a reward?
[00:28:19] Lindon Gao: Right back with your robot teacher.
[00:28:21] Lindon Gao: It's a great deal.
[00:28:24] Lindon Gao: So basically, the algorithm is incentivized
[00:28:27] Lindon Gao: to do the right things.
[00:28:28] Lindon Gao: But that the initiative, the right thing,
[00:28:30] Lindon Gao: is very undefined.
[00:28:32] Lindon Gao: This is where I get creepy, right?
[00:28:34] Lindon Gao: I'm going to take over the world and kill it all.
[00:28:37] David Carleman: And as long as you give it the right word,
[00:28:39] Lindon Gao: it's important to try to set it to do the right things.
[00:28:42] Lindon Gao: So at every single stage, if it's successfully flattened
[00:28:46] Lindon Gao: and the towel, I guess it's a reward.
[00:28:49] Lindon Gao: If it's successfully, that's the first bowl,
[00:28:51] Lindon Gao: it gets a reward.
[00:28:52] Lindon Gao: And that's so on and so forth.
[00:28:53] Lindon Gao: So it's so a computerized out of boy.
[00:28:55] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:28:57] Lindon Gao: Good job.
[00:28:57] Lindon Gao: Like Carlos said.
[00:28:58] Lindon Gao: So every single time it gets a reward,
[00:29:01] Lindon Gao: then I know it was, OK, now I can do this better next time.
[00:29:04] Lindon Gao: So it's kind of like a baby, right?
[00:29:06] Lindon Gao: Every time when it grabs something in it,
[00:29:08] Lindon Gao: this something new or something well,
[00:29:10] Lindon Gao: every time when you're a kid, put that stuff there.
[00:29:14] Lindon Gao: And it's learning that, oh, this is how I take the first step.
[00:29:16] Lindon Gao: This is how I take the second step.
[00:29:18] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:29:18] Lindon Gao: Over time, it just colleges and gets better and better.
[00:29:21] Lindon Gao: So it has a very similar mechanism to it.
[00:29:25] Lindon Gao: That's similar to humans.
[00:29:26] Lindon Gao: Wow.
[00:29:26] Lindon Gao: OK.
[00:29:27] Lindon Gao: Back to correct.
[00:29:28] David Carleman: Another follow-up question.
[00:29:29] David Carleman: Sure.
[00:29:30] You kind of need your store for six weeks.
[00:29:31] David Carleman: I'm sure you had a bunch of conversations
[00:29:33] David Carleman: before you put in your store.
[00:29:35] David Carleman: But you're actually one of the few people using it,
[00:29:36] David Carleman: IRL, right?
[00:29:38] David Carleman: In real life.
[00:29:38] David Carleman: That's correct.
[00:29:40] David Carleman: Where do you think it's going?
[00:29:41] David Carleman: What do you, I guess, and I don't know if you guys can speak to this,
[00:29:44] David Carleman: but have you already given them feedback?
[00:29:46] David Carleman: Like, we are.
[00:29:47] David Carleman: Can I do this?
[00:29:48] David Carleman: Can I do that?
[00:29:49] David Carleman: And how soon can I do this?
[00:29:51] David Carleman: Where do you think this thing's going to be able to be in a year or two?
[00:29:54] David Carleman: If you're allowed to like talk about private conversations.
[00:29:57] Craig Taylor: Well, I envision, and this is not by any means vision,
[00:30:00] Craig Taylor: but by envision that we get a residential commercial load of laundry,
[00:30:05] Craig Taylor: which includes baby socks, all the baby clothing,
[00:30:08] Craig Taylor: the rain with shirts and the garments of an adult, the towels,
[00:30:13] Craig Taylor: the linens that come in the sheets.
[00:30:16] Craig Taylor: And they just simply come out of the dryer.
[00:30:18] Craig Taylor: We put them in a laundry basket, roll it right on over to Dina.
[00:30:22] Craig Taylor: Yep.
[00:30:22] Craig Taylor: And Dina just simply goes through stacks them in the appropriate piles.
[00:30:26] Craig Taylor: So they create what I would consider kind of the tetris game of proper stacking.
[00:30:31] Craig Taylor: Yep.
[00:30:32] Craig Taylor: And then it goes into a nice little container,
[00:30:34] Craig Taylor: our tentative just simply then places in the bag.
[00:30:37] Craig Taylor: It's shipping out.
[00:30:38] Craig Taylor: That would be amazing.
[00:30:39] Craig Taylor: And I would expect that as we see laundry is changing the future,
[00:30:43] Craig Taylor: the new format of laundry will include a robotics folding section.
[00:30:47] Craig Taylor: Yeah, for the smaller laundry.
[00:30:49] Craig Taylor: And yes.
[00:30:50] So that's what I think Dina's vision might be a little bit different.
[00:30:54] Craig Taylor: That's from a laundry owner operator, perspective operator.
[00:30:57] Craig Taylor: That is what we need to fully solve our problems in the industry.
[00:31:02] David Carleman: Give you an example.
[00:31:03] David Carleman: Craig has been in our workshop.
[00:31:04] David Carleman: We do a workshop three times a year and since it's an addy,
[00:31:07] David Carleman: we teach laundry about owners how to watch, scale and optimize their pick up and delivery business.
[00:31:12] A good portion of that is efficiencies redundancies backups.
[00:31:16] David Carleman: Humans are great, but they're not great if they don't show up, right?
[00:31:19] David Carleman: All those types of things.
[00:31:21] David Carleman: One of the things we teach is folding and packaging, folding slash packaging.
[00:31:26] David Carleman: That's one process as far as work and serve.
[00:31:29] David Carleman: So the fact that it can fold towels pulled off the side is really cool.
[00:31:33] David Carleman: But long term, I think we as an industry as operators need this to do exactly what he described,
[00:31:39] David Carleman: including putting it in a package, grabbing a label off of our printer,
[00:31:43] David Carleman: putting it on the thing and it could take that bundle of laundry and put it on the appropriate shelf.
[00:31:48] And then that goes into the delivery, the delivery person comes and grabs it off the shelf.
[00:31:52] Craig Taylor: For the delivery robot.
[00:31:54] Host or Interviewer: Oh, yeah.
[00:31:55] Host or Interviewer: Oh, yeah.
[00:31:56] Host or Interviewer: Let's do a whole new problem.
[00:31:58] Host or Interviewer: Automatic car.
[00:31:59] Host or Interviewer: I mean.
[00:32:00] Host or Interviewer: Oh, yeah.
[00:32:01] Craig Taylor: Oh, yeah.
[00:32:03] What are your thoughts on how crazy we are?
[00:32:05] Lindon Gao: That's what we need.
[00:32:06] Lindon Gao: That's real life.
[00:32:07] Lindon Gao: You are not crazy at all.
[00:32:08] Lindon Gao: We actually spent hundreds of hours in laundry, so we know exactly the problem there.
[00:32:13] Lindon Gao: You already know.
[00:32:14] Lindon Gao: We're working on it.
[00:32:15] Lindon Gao: We're knocking them out one at a time.
[00:32:16] Lindon Gao: So the first thing now, what nature we knock out is fold, right?
[00:32:20] Lindon Gao: Folding high-short road lots.
[00:32:22] Lindon Gao: It's able to go very quickly.
[00:32:24] Lindon Gao: So through percent quality are the two metrics that we pull this on in the coffee.
[00:32:30] Lindon Gao: And beyond that, it's really just how can we do everything else around it?
[00:32:33] Lindon Gao: Which packaging the late flight.
[00:32:35] Lindon Gao: Yeah, maybe the delivery for you guys down the road as well.
[00:32:38] Lindon Gao: I'll probably be in the next year or two.
[00:32:40] Lindon Gao: We're here to hold on.
[00:32:42] David Carleman: Hold on.
[00:32:43] David Carleman: DJ, you're here to do.
[00:32:45] My new best friend.
[00:32:47] David Carleman: We're going to get along great.
[00:32:49] David Carleman: Yeah, usually I have all these crazy ideas and people are like, well, maybe someday,
[00:32:54] David Carleman: I'm like, I've done doing it for me.
[00:32:56] David Carleman: Year two.
[00:32:57] David Carleman: All right.
[00:32:58] Lindon Gao: I challenge accepted.
[00:32:59] Lindon Gao: I'm genuinely excited about how quickly AI is advanced.
[00:33:03] Lindon Gao: Yeah, this world.
[00:33:04] Lindon Gao: And all of this is really just a bunch of data.
[00:33:07] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:33:08] Lindon Gao: So as long as we get the right data, we're not going to be able to do it.
[00:33:10] Lindon Gao: And do I understand correctly that AI in general from where it is today and to tomorrow
[00:33:17] David Carleman: is a compounded exponential data collection growth, meaning it's speeding up the rate
[00:33:22] David Carleman: at which it collects data and can respond accordingly to every minute, hour, hour,
[00:33:29] Lindon Gao: that's right.
[00:33:30] Lindon Gao: Because here's the thing.
[00:33:31] Lindon Gao: The reason why robotics is not soft in the real world today is because there is no real
[00:33:37] Lindon Gao: world data.
[00:33:39] Right.
[00:33:40] Lindon Gao: We're able to share a language model because there's a huge purpose of all this text on the
[00:33:44] Lindon Gao: internet, the straight up letter from all these bugs and everything else.
[00:33:49] Lindon Gao: We could also generate videos and generate images because there's no shortages of these
[00:33:53] Lindon Gao: videos and images on YouTube and where else.
[00:33:56] Lindon Gao: But there is nothing in the physical world today.
[00:33:58] Lindon Gao: So one of the critical things is as we scale data, the robot is able to learn a lot faster,
[00:34:03] Lindon Gao: as it's able to do a lot more things beyond exploding.
[00:34:06] Lindon Gao: It could put your meals for you.
[00:34:07] Lindon Gao: It could wash your dishes for you.
[00:34:09] Lindon Gao: Yes, it's all source of feelings.
[00:34:11] Lindon Gao: Yes.
[00:34:12] Host or Interviewer: How's work became a breeze with this robotic whirling dirtish?
[00:34:15] Host or Interviewer: Let's go home, Rose.
[00:34:17] Never fear while Rosie is here.
[00:34:20] Host or Interviewer: It's Rosie to the rescue.
[00:34:23] David Carleman: Let's do all that.
[00:34:24] David Carleman: I think your robot needs to come to our workshop.
[00:34:27] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:34:28] David Carleman: I agree.
[00:34:29] Host or Interviewer: Is your laundromat ready to become the neighborhood's number one choice?
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_04: Laundra Boost has proven strategies to help your business flourish.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_04: I think we saw changes pretty quick before that four month range.
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_07: I'm in that four month range now and Borcian changes love to cry.
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_07: I mean, pick up and deliver clients, drop off clients, self service clients, businesses
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_07: up as a whole.
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_07: Literally, it was shocking to watch the numbers jump.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_05: What should we get?
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_05: I could go back and I could begin to track these things.
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_05: We try to have to just see what percentage growth we had, but it wasn't unusual to go up
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_05: 30 percent per month.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_05: At Laundra Boost, we specialize in fueling laundromat growth.
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_04: Through targeted Google ads and powerful social media campaigns, we make your locations stand
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_04: out and attract loyal customers.
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_04: Ready to level up your laundromat?
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_04: Visit LaundraBoostMarketing.com and book a call with us for a free consultation.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_04: One thing I think especially people who are here at the clean show are going to be wondering
[00:35:27] Host or Interviewer: because you can't see all the robot is how much space is needed for one of these just
[00:35:33] Host or Interviewer: just for folding.
[00:35:34] Host or Interviewer: You're not moving around yet.
[00:35:35] Host or Interviewer: How much space is needed for just a holding robot?
[00:35:37] Host or Interviewer: This is it.
[00:35:38] I know.
[00:35:39] Lindon Gao: So why would you estimate that?
[00:35:40] Host or Interviewer: That's what like for fee wide by about four foot by four foot.
[00:35:45] Host or Interviewer: Four by four I think.
[00:35:47] This robot will actually get even smaller.
[00:35:49] Lindon Gao: So the base we got a little smaller and it will be able to move around.
[00:35:53] Lindon Gao: So we'll get small footwork.
[00:35:55] Lindon Gao: We're going to smaller over time.
[00:35:57] Lindon Gao: The arm eventually will convert to our human arm.
[00:36:00] Lindon Gao: So our human arm has seven degrees of freedom.
[00:36:03] Lindon Gao: There's a six degrees of freedom.
[00:36:04] Lindon Gao: So once the arms converges towards the torso, then the ball and socket.
[00:36:09] Lindon Gao: Yes.
[00:36:10] Lindon Gao: Concept.
[00:36:11] Okay.
[00:36:12] Host or Interviewer: Yeah.
[00:36:13] Host or Interviewer: Because you could narrow it like narrow shoulders.
[00:36:14] Host or Interviewer: This has pretty wide shoulders.
[00:36:15] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:36:16] Host or Interviewer: So the narrow the shoulders.
[00:36:17] Lindon Gao: So it'll be a lot easier to manipulate this.
[00:36:21] Lindon Gao: Wonderful.
[00:36:22] Host or Interviewer: Awesome.
[00:36:23] Host or Interviewer: And then what about as far as power?
[00:36:24] Host or Interviewer: It looks like it's just plugging into a regular outlet.
[00:36:27] Host or Interviewer: Yeah.
[00:36:28] David Carleman: Just regular outlet.
[00:36:29] Host or Interviewer: And that's all I know.
[00:36:30] Host or Interviewer: It's not special.
[00:36:31] David Carleman: What that needed?
[00:36:32] David Carleman: No.
[00:36:33] David Carleman: That is awesome.
[00:36:34] David Carleman: And I noticed you park your tail of the camera.
[00:36:35] David Carleman: But down here it's plugged into a laptop.
[00:36:36] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:36:37] David Carleman: That's just for data purposes.
[00:36:38] Lindon Gao: That's just where the compute.
[00:36:39] Lindon Gao: So in the future we'll do some about this little laptop inside.
[00:36:41] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:36:42] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:36:43] Host or Interviewer: So they won't need to plug into a laptop.
[00:36:45] Host or Interviewer: That is, it'll be part.
[00:36:46] Host or Interviewer: Is that a lot of it?
[00:36:47] Host or Interviewer: It has an inferencing engine that's underneath the tape.
[00:36:51] Craig Taylor: But that'll consolidate on sure.
[00:36:53] Craig Taylor: Yes.
[00:36:54] Craig Taylor: Yeah.
[00:36:55] David Carleman: Okay.
[00:36:57] David Carleman: I am blown away.
[00:36:59] David Carleman: You're so proud of him.
[00:37:00] David Carleman: I know.
[00:37:01] Craig Taylor: I know.
[00:37:02] Craig Taylor: It's a special.
[00:37:03] David Carleman: So I want to go back to when this company started,
[00:37:06] David Carleman: you said 11 months ago.
[00:37:08] Is that a, is that a literal thing?
[00:37:10] David Carleman: Like the company was found and it didn't exist until one month ago.
[00:37:14] Host or Interviewer: That one when the first robot came out.
[00:37:16] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:17] David Carleman: That didn't exist.
[00:37:18] David Carleman: I did not.
[00:37:19] David Carleman: And I know you're like an expert in the field.
[00:37:21] David Carleman: So I'm not surprised.
[00:37:22] David Carleman: But you got from zero to this.
[00:37:25] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:26] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:27] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:28] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:29] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:30] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:31] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:32] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:33] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:34] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:35] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:36] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:37] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:38] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:39] Host or Interviewer: Yeah.
[00:37:40] Host or Interviewer: Yeah.
[00:37:41] Yeah.
[00:37:42] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:37:52] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:37:53] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:37:52] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:37:53] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:37:52] Lindon Gao: six, six, seven months. Wow.
[00:37:54] Lindon Gao: Yes. So did it look a whole lot different than what we're seeing now.
[00:37:57] Host or Interviewer: It looked a lot different. And it was a lot worse than this is there was a lot of
[00:38:03] Lindon Gao: wires hanging around and it did not hold it very well.
[00:38:06] Lindon Gao: I thought it was looking around on your website because that was very
[00:38:10] Host or Interviewer: very intrigued by all this and I thought the arms actually like clicked on to the table.
[00:38:15] Host or Interviewer: Did it start off that way? Yes. Okay.
[00:38:17] Host or Interviewer: So why did you move away from it? Because one thing the arms clicked on there would take up
[00:38:22] Host or Interviewer: less space. Why did you move away from that?
[00:38:25] Host or Interviewer: It's a lot easier to scale this way so that there's different tables that do
[00:38:29] Lindon Gao: perform that different width and so forth.
[00:38:31] Lindon Gao: That's just at the end of it we still need to compute everything else.
[00:38:35] Lindon Gao: It's much easier to just integrate into what unit so they'll be just deploying to new environments.
[00:38:39] Lindon Gao: And you can put it on me also.
[00:38:42] Host or Interviewer: It's ready for the next step of washing and drying.
[00:38:46] Host or Interviewer: I have packaging and I love it to your customers.
[00:38:49] Lindon Gao: Yes.
[00:38:50] Lindon Gao: I'm loading a truck.
[00:38:50] Lindon Gao: Exactly.
[00:38:51] Host or Interviewer: We'll get there.
[00:38:52] Lindon Gao: We'll get there.
[00:38:53] Lindon Gao: We'll hold the truck and maybe you could have mealed for you on your way.
[00:38:56] Lindon Gao: I love it.
[00:38:57] David Carleman: Wow.
[00:38:57] David Carleman: Any more questions?
[00:38:59] David Carleman: I don't think I have any more questions.
[00:39:01] David Carleman: Fred, what do you think about this?
[00:39:03] David Carleman: What's the final analysis of someone that's used it for six weeks in the field?
[00:39:07] David Carleman: I know you're only doing towels right?
[00:39:09] David Carleman: Right now.
[00:39:10] Craig Taylor: Well, what's really interesting, we processed laundry,
[00:39:13] Craig Taylor: Dave's way, Arles's way, that we learned at their workshop,
[00:39:16] Craig Taylor: I don't even since Nadi.
[00:39:18] Craig Taylor: And augmented that slightly by creating a board with each of our attendants,
[00:39:23] Craig Taylor: the longer they need to do each day.
[00:39:25] Craig Taylor: Because we're still somewhat small.
[00:39:26] Craig Taylor: Yep.
[00:39:27] Craig Taylor: Yeah.
[00:39:28] Craig Taylor: Sophie has her own slut.
[00:39:30] Yeah.
[00:39:30] Oh, okay.
[00:39:32] Craig Taylor: And that tells you that yes, she's an effective member of the team.
[00:39:36] Craig Taylor: She has her own slot of work she needs to do during the day.
[00:39:40] Craig Taylor: And I'd say she's now part of the process.
[00:39:43] Craig Taylor: She's within operations and we rely on her to get jobs done.
[00:39:47] Craig Taylor: I think I mentioned we have six commercial clients.
[00:39:50] Craig Taylor: Those are towels.
[00:39:51] Craig Taylor: We're looking forward to more residential in the future.
[00:39:54] Craig Taylor: So let's post it.
[00:39:56] David Carleman: Sophie, speed.
[00:39:57] David Carleman: You know, I'm a 30,000 hour to 30,000 hour that right now.
[00:40:01] David Carleman: That is what's holding.
[00:40:02] David Carleman: Keep your hold.
[00:40:03] David Carleman: I don't have metrics on that.
[00:40:05] Craig Taylor: But what I can tell you is some key information was that there was a fold they were doing.
[00:40:12] Craig Taylor: And it was taking Sophie something like 30 seconds.
[00:40:16] Craig Taylor: And then they let her up.
[00:40:18] And after a while, she got that down to 22 seconds.
[00:40:21] Craig Taylor: Wow.
[00:40:21] Craig Taylor: So that's for one fold and just in one shift.
[00:40:24] Craig Taylor: Yeah.
[00:40:24] Craig Taylor: Well, that was no, that was over time.
[00:40:26] Craig Taylor: But what they they observed is getting faster over time.
[00:40:30] Craig Taylor: And so I expect that all of the folds will probably start getting faster and faster
[00:40:34] Craig Taylor: to the point where it's the speed of the robotic arms and the manipulation of the towel will slow it down.
[00:40:40] David Carleman: Is part of the speed, the limitation, and I don't mean to pick on your baby, but it's not fast.
[00:40:45] David Carleman: We can all see that.
[00:40:46] David Carleman: Right.
[00:40:46] David Carleman: Is part of the limitations.
[00:40:48] David Carleman: Some of the design elements you're talking about with the ball and socket and
[00:40:53] David Carleman: those different things are you are you limited by what it can do and how fast it can do it
[00:40:58] David Carleman: because of design one or two or whatever this is.
[00:41:01] David Carleman: Yeah.
[00:41:02] David Carleman: So the general general thing about and speed are actually a combination of I will say probably three
[00:41:08] Lindon Gao: different variables.
[00:41:09] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:41:10] Lindon Gao: Number one is just how does it solve the problem?
[00:41:13] Lindon Gao: Right.
[00:41:13] Lindon Gao: The how it solves the problem is actually very important because because you guys might notice this
[00:41:18] Lindon Gao: from some of your best workers that has a son of throughput that little tricks.
[00:41:23] Lindon Gao: Yes.
[00:41:23] Lindon Gao: Figure out those little things make a big difference.
[00:41:26] Lindon Gao: Exactly.
[00:41:26] Lindon Gao: And those are the little things, little tricks that we're trying to learn as the robot
[00:41:30] Lindon Gao: involves over time.
[00:41:31] Lindon Gao: It's because they're learning that these little tricks lost slower than humans.
[00:41:35] Lindon Gao: As it ignores these little tricks over and over again, you'll be able to actually get a lot faster.
[00:41:40] Lindon Gao: Could it?
[00:41:41] David Carleman: I'm not apologize if I interrupted.
[00:41:43] David Carleman: If if we had a Marlene, which we all know Marlene's my G.
[00:41:45] David Carleman: Hell.
[00:41:46] David Carleman: She's the most amazing while everything in the world, but she's the most amazing laundry processor I've
[00:41:52] David Carleman: ever seen in my life.
[00:41:53] David Carleman: I've always said if she weren't so valuable, if I made a processor, I'm confident she could do
[00:41:57] David Carleman: a hundred pounds an hour, not folding the total order to order in.
[00:42:01] So if we put someone like Marlene next to Dina or Sophie and they just watch her do laundry,
[00:42:09] David Carleman: would that be a?
[00:42:09] David Carleman: And they learn?
[00:42:11] Host or Interviewer: With her way of learning or am I really increasing that?
[00:42:14] David Carleman: Of course, really you are.
[00:42:15] Lindon Gao: A little crazy now.
[00:42:17] David Carleman: I'm trying to see how far I could take a lead, but that was pretty far.
[00:42:20] David Carleman: He's like, yeah, that predicts the list day.
[00:42:22] David Carleman: No, it's going to right now.
[00:42:25] Lindon Gao: It goes to learn very well from humans.
[00:42:27] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:42:27] Lindon Gao: I can't take you, they can't learn from what we call egocentric video, which is we put a camera
[00:42:33] Lindon Gao: right right here and you can do the whole thing.
[00:42:37] Lindon Gao: Well, my computer has learned, but it doesn't learn very well.
[00:42:39] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:42:39] Lindon Gao: It's not very efficient learning.
[00:42:42] Lindon Gao: The most efficient way for robots to learn is to do it by doing something these tasks.
[00:42:48] Lindon Gao: So when I find something like these little tricks, for example, it's the robot actually needs to
[00:42:52] Lindon Gao: actually learn how to find corners, right?
[00:42:54] Lindon Gao: The speed to which it flies corners actually defies how quickly
[00:42:58] Lindon Gao: like a fold.
[00:42:59] Lindon Gao: So the robot is actually still learning how can I find corners very, very quickly?
[00:43:03] Lindon Gao: I'll make sure that it's on the same side.
[00:43:05] Lindon Gao: Very quickly, because sometimes it doesn't flip on the same side, right?
[00:43:10] Lindon Gao: So sometimes you grab a corner of your computer, but you grab the other corner over there and you flip,
[00:43:14] Lindon Gao: but then you can't fly and you have to grab corners on the same side.
[00:43:18] Lindon Gao: So those are the tricks that the robot has to learn over time, I said,
[00:43:23] Lindon Gao: there's more and more.
[00:43:24] Lindon Gao: See, that's the first one now, but the second component is how the robot
[00:43:30] Lindon Gao: how quickly robot gets out of what we call out of distribution state.
[00:43:33] Lindon Gao: What out of distribution state really just means is that when the towel is in a very
[00:43:39] Lindon Gao: teotic format, how quickly can the robot get it to fly?
[00:43:43] That's after that or more.
[00:43:45] Lindon Gao: That's half the value.
[00:43:46] Lindon Gao: And what happens is some things like that in a different out of that distribution scenario,
[00:43:52] Lindon Gao: as it picks up two to three towels at the same time,
[00:43:54] Lindon Gao: is it able to learn to separate from these scenarios and I was back and so forth, right?
[00:44:01] Lindon Gao: These out of distribution scenarios easily hit the root of the artist.
[00:44:05] Lindon Gao: For example, now I've been folding a scenario, in this case,
[00:44:08] Lindon Gao: the client wants to pull over a thousand apples on a daily basis.
[00:44:11] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:44:12] Lindon Gao: What we realized is that we're able to persistently fold the napkins
[00:44:15] Lindon Gao: hit under like 30 to 40 seconds, but then when it gets into out of distribution state,
[00:44:20] Lindon Gao: where we pick up 30 to 40 napkins all at the same time,
[00:44:24] Lindon Gao: putting it back, that particular problem takes us about two to three minutes to solve.
[00:44:29] So the faster it's able to navigate out of that scenario, because these happen all the time,
[00:44:34] Lindon Gao: and these are the precise scenarios where it breaks machines.
[00:44:37] Lindon Gao: Yeah, it breaks machines because machines cannot handle it.
[00:44:40] Lindon Gao: Yeah, it doesn't have the acknowledges for the robots.
[00:44:42] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:44:43] Lindon Gao: So the sooner it solves the problem, the faster it solves the problem,
[00:44:47] Lindon Gao: then the throughput rate will also go up.
[00:44:49] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:44:49] Lindon Gao: And then the last part is the hardware limitation, which is how quickly can the hardware.
[00:44:53] Lindon Gao: And these are a folks up just advancing the hardware for tech, for technology.
[00:44:58] Lindon Gao: Okay.
[00:44:59] Lindon Gao: And I thought about making the fingers.
[00:45:01] Host or Interviewer: So right now you kind of just have ventures.
[00:45:03] Host or Interviewer: We thought about making them more like fingers.
[00:45:06] Yes.
[00:45:06] So these, basically the finger technology right now, this time,
[00:45:11] Lindon Gao: I will say commercial already yet, because we have a lot of joins.
[00:45:15] Lindon Gao: We have like 20 degrees of freedom on your fingers.
[00:45:17] Lindon Gao: Yeah.
[00:45:18] Lindon Gao: It breaks very easily, right?
[00:45:20] Lindon Gao: Because so if I accidentally slab my finger on the table, it's going to hurt.
[00:45:23] Lindon Gao: It's going to hurt.
[00:45:24] Lindon Gao: Right.
[00:45:25] Lindon Gao: So right now, uh, parallel frippers are the most reliable format,
[00:45:29] Lindon Gao: and it boasts the job of law enforcement, right?
[00:45:31] Lindon Gao: Very well.
[00:45:32] Lindon Gao: As we roll out of that, as I mentioned, the hardware is going to get better.
[00:45:35] Lindon Gao: We are going to start converging towards a slightly more steep up.
[00:45:38] Lindon Gao: And you're not a hardware company, right?
[00:45:40] Lindon Gao: Would you know our hardware?
[00:45:42] Lindon Gao: We're, yes.
[00:45:44] Lindon Gao: We are not a finger building.
[00:45:47] Lindon Gao: That's pretty advanced.
[00:45:48] David Carleman: Yes.
[00:45:48] David Carleman: That's right.
[00:45:49] David Carleman: That's also very different.
[00:45:50] David Carleman: Is there a limit to the robot itself?
[00:45:55] And how long it can work?
[00:45:57] David Carleman: Does it overheat?
[00:45:59] David Carleman: Does it need breaks?
[00:46:01] David Carleman: Do certain components?
[00:46:03] David Carleman: Short out?
[00:46:04] David Carleman: I don't know.
[00:46:04] David Carleman: I'm just kind of going to be.
[00:46:06] David Carleman: And this thing runs for like three weeks.
[00:46:08] David Carleman: Great.
[00:46:08] David Carleman: If you kept it, if you kept giving it laundry baskets,
[00:46:12] David Carleman: so far, you're one of our other
[00:46:14] Lindon Gao: Marshall application scenarios where we're fully napkins,
[00:46:19] Lindon Gao: the robot is running about
[00:46:21] Lindon Gao: 16 to 18 hours a day.
[00:46:23] Lindon Gao: Wow.
[00:46:24] Lindon Gao: And close to two weeks with the last
[00:46:26] Lindon Gao: a couple of months.
[00:46:27] Lindon Gao: And that has it.
[00:46:28] Lindon Gao: We haven't right right to end.
[00:46:29] Lindon Gao: And that does affect it.
[00:46:30] Lindon Gao: It does affect so well.
[00:46:32] Lindon Gao: The robot is able to run for as long as you want it to.
[00:46:34] Lindon Gao: And it's able to, you know, we built this to last at least two years
[00:46:39] Lindon Gao: in production environment.
[00:46:40] Lindon Gao: And over time, it's hard to get spender.
[00:46:42] Lindon Gao: For these five years, I'll show up like two years, 24 hours a day.
[00:46:47] Lindon Gao: Yes.
[00:46:47] Lindon Gao: Like you've got so you calculated like working hours, working hours.
[00:46:52] Lindon Gao: So right now, the hardware build standard is 20,000 hours at an hour.
[00:46:58] Lindon Gao: So that's what worked good.
[00:46:59] Lindon Gao: So if you use that eight hours a day, it would be six years, right?
[00:47:02] David Carleman: Yes.
[00:47:03] David Carleman: How often are you using it right now?
[00:47:04] Craig Taylor: Right now it's in a training in production mode.
[00:47:08] Craig Taylor: So we have a Dina technician training.
[00:47:11] Craig Taylor: And then again, Misha's it on production.
[00:47:13] Craig Taylor: And it just starts going autonomously.
[00:47:16] Craig Taylor: And that's when everybody starts to start the video.
[00:47:18] Craig Taylor: Yeah.
[00:47:18] Craig Taylor: They're like, what's going on?
[00:47:19] Craig Taylor: Including your employees.
[00:47:20] Craig Taylor: Yeah.
[00:47:21] Craig Taylor: Oh, you're like, oh, I hope you're good.
[00:47:22] Craig Taylor: You're like, you're getting a little worried about their jobs.
[00:47:24] Craig Taylor: That's the first, actually, that's one of the first thing we had a staff meeting.
[00:47:28] Craig Taylor: And the first thing that came out of one of our our staffs,
[00:47:31] Craig Taylor: mouth is you're going to replace us.
[00:47:33] Craig Taylor: And I think that that's a little too, too drastic.
[00:47:37] Craig Taylor: This is a tool to help augment our staff's ability to wash dry.
[00:47:42] Craig Taylor: And just like we have washing machines and we have dryers,
[00:47:46] Craig Taylor: this is a folding machine.
[00:47:47] Craig Taylor: And it just helps us be more productive and more effective.
[00:47:51] Craig Taylor: Yeah.
[00:47:52] Craig Taylor: One other thing I you were mentioning something,
[00:47:54] Craig Taylor: a key piece of this around quality.
[00:47:56] Craig Taylor: We had the need to fold the towel with the seams in.
[00:47:59] Craig Taylor: And actually the same, this identifies the actual seam in folds at the crack weight.
[00:48:05] Craig Taylor: And that's right.
[00:48:05] Craig Taylor: That's right.
[00:48:07] Craig Taylor: I didn't think it would be able to do that.
[00:48:09] Craig Taylor: But we said, this is the way we wanted.
[00:48:11] Craig Taylor: And Michelle, our CEO and Monster Mondry,
[00:48:14] Craig Taylor: was like very exactly, it has to be this way because it's the monster fold.
[00:48:18] Craig Taylor: Yeah.
[00:48:18] Craig Taylor: And Dina was able to do that.
[00:48:19] Craig Taylor: It was very, I didn't even expect you'd be able to do that.
[00:48:22] Craig Taylor: Was that a difficult challenge?
[00:48:24] Craig Taylor: Or you're like, no big deal.
[00:48:26] Lindon Gao: Initially, we weren't highly sure.
[00:48:28] Lindon Gao: Otherwise, this was a small spot.
[00:48:29] Lindon Gao: So it'd be really, it's limited.
[00:48:31] Lindon Gao: It's actually limited by whether or not the cameras can see it.
[00:48:34] Lindon Gao: Right? So, so if the cameras are able to see it and detect it,
[00:48:39] Lindon Gao: and we've given it the right command,
[00:48:41] Lindon Gao: it should be able to do it.
[00:48:42] Lindon Gao: So we were initially sure.
[00:48:44] Lindon Gao: And as we actually got the robots to do it,
[00:48:48] Lindon Gao: they actually just learned.
[00:48:50] Lindon Gao: And that was a really impressive part,
[00:48:51] Lindon Gao: which is the same detection piece.
[00:48:54] Lindon Gao: The robot kind of just picked it up as we give it a very, very strict standard,
[00:48:57] Lindon Gao: it's like this needs to happen.
[00:48:59] Lindon Gao: Also, we'll be fine.
[00:49:00] Lindon Gao: We're just all that hard, that camera, a fire quality camera.
[00:49:05] Lindon Gao: That's actually the backstage as well.
[00:49:07] Lindon Gao: So, staying detection is also a very top-in.
[00:49:10] Lindon Gao: Okay, hold on.
[00:49:11] David Carleman: Can this thing treat stains?
[00:49:13] David Carleman: It cannot treat stains yet.
[00:49:15] David Carleman: Yes, yes, yes.
[00:49:16] Lindon Gao: Come on, it's all the same.
[00:49:17] Lindon Gao: Yes, yes, yes.
[00:49:21] Lindon Gao: But yes, it will also be able to detect stains.
[00:49:24] Lindon Gao: It's next wow.
[00:49:25] Lindon Gao: So how like if it sees a stain like shove it aside,
[00:49:28] Host or Interviewer: like do you need something with that?
[00:49:29] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:49:31] Now, if Lyndon, I was talking to one of your engineers,
[00:49:33] Craig Taylor: and she mentioned potentially the grippers, the fellow programmers,
[00:49:37] Craig Taylor: will eventually be able to sensey touch and get a feedback there.
[00:49:41] Craig Taylor: Wow.
[00:49:43] Craig Taylor: Is that coming or?
[00:49:44] Craig Taylor: Yes.
[00:49:44] Craig Taylor: Yes, that is coming.
[00:49:46] Craig Taylor: One or two years.
[00:49:47] Craig Taylor: Everything.
[00:49:48] David Carleman: One to two years.
[00:49:49] David Carleman: One to two yard.
[00:49:50] David Carleman: Oh, since that sensing is coming and I'm good.
[00:49:54] Lindon Gao: I'm good.
[00:49:54] Lindon Gao: No, that is coming in a couple of months.
[00:49:56] Lindon Gao: Oh, wow.
[00:49:57] Lindon Gao: That's a little sensing.
[00:49:58] Lindon Gao: Yes, that's right.
[00:49:59] Lindon Gao: This thing because you're absolutely in six words.
[00:50:01] Lindon Gao: Yeah, sensing is one thing that's like potentially improved through what?
[00:50:05] Lindon Gao: Because sometimes you see that it's a misgraphs.
[00:50:07] Lindon Gao: So I'm having a sensor.
[00:50:09] Lindon Gao: It makes a lot of ask you're a lot easier to detect that.
[00:50:11] Lindon Gao: This was a misgraphs.
[00:50:12] Lindon Gao: Uh-huh.
[00:50:13] Lindon Gao: And now I need to do it.
[00:50:14] Lindon Gao: And for example, in like use cases like a lot,
[00:50:18] Lindon Gao: like not being full of the applications,
[00:50:19] Lindon Gao: where it's in the stack where we need to actually pick one out at a time.
[00:50:24] Lindon Gao: Now we know, okay, I felt like we just picked up two.
[00:50:26] Lindon Gao: Seven point.
[00:50:27] Lindon Gao: So since it actually helps with our overall quality and third place.
[00:50:30] Lindon Gao: Well, I'm so excited to see this and I can't wait to see what you all are going to have.
[00:50:36] Host or Interviewer: And a month from now, a year from now,
[00:50:38] Host or Interviewer: I can't believe you did this in like six months.
[00:50:41] Host or Interviewer: This is amazing.
[00:50:42] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:50:43] Host or Interviewer: Um, for those of you out there,
[00:50:44] Host or Interviewer: if you are at the clean show,
[00:50:45] Host or Interviewer: you've got to stop by 867 and check out the Diner robots.
[00:50:50] Host or Interviewer: They are amazing.
[00:50:52] Host or Interviewer: Now we've been focusing on just this how-folding robot,
[00:50:54] Host or Interviewer: but there is also a sorting robot.
[00:50:57] Host or Interviewer: Yep.
[00:50:57] Host or Interviewer: And it's whatever here that's holding my shirts and stuff too.
[00:51:00] Host or Interviewer: So you're going to come and see it all.
[00:51:03] Host or Interviewer: But thank you so much, Linda.
[00:51:05] Host or Interviewer: Yes.
[00:51:05] Host or Interviewer: Before having a listen.
[00:51:06] Host or Interviewer: Thank you, my friend.
[00:51:07] David Carleman: Thank you so much for having me.
[00:51:08] David Carleman: Thank you so much.
[00:51:09] Host or Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your experience with us.
[00:51:12] Host or Interviewer: Absolutely.
[00:51:13] Host or Interviewer: The future of laundry technology is here today, guys.
[00:51:17] David Carleman: It isn't coming in two years.
[00:51:18] David Carleman: Now, perfection is coming in two years.
[00:51:20] David Carleman: Ha ha ha ha.
[00:51:21] David Carleman: Right.
[00:51:22] David Carleman: So come check them out, guys.
[00:51:23] David Carleman: Thanks for joining us on the Lawner Not Millionaire Live.
[00:51:26] David Carleman: And don't forget, we're going to have three or four
[00:51:27] David Carleman: of more of these at different booths.
[00:51:29] David Carleman: So if you're watching from home,
[00:51:31] David Carleman: hopefully you can give you a little taste
[00:51:32] David Carleman: of what the clean show looks like.
[00:51:34] David Carleman: And maybe it'll make you want to come in the future.
[00:51:36] David Carleman: If you are here, come and talk to all these vendors.
[00:51:39] David Carleman: Because man, exciting stuff happened in the industry.
[00:51:41] David Carleman: This is the end of this episode,
[00:51:43] Host or Interviewer: sponsored by HN Company at dreamtross.com.
[00:51:47] Host or Interviewer: We'll see you next time.
