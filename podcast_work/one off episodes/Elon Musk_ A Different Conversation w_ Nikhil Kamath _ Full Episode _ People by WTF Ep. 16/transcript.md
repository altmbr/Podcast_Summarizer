[00:00:59] Nikhil Kamath: ...today my questions in that direction so they can take advantage of this conversation and maybe start take a chance and build something.
[00:01:24] What a coffee?
[00:01:27] Elon Musk: Sure, why not?
[00:01:29] Elon Musk: I'm going to be talking for a while.
[00:01:31] Elon Musk: I hope so.
[00:01:33] Nikhil Kamath: Sure.
[00:01:35] Ming-no?
[00:01:37] May I try to leave you for a coffee?
[00:01:39] Elon Musk: Can we get another coffee?
[00:01:41] A cup of sheen.
[00:01:44] Elon Musk: Are you a coffee drinker?
[00:01:47] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, I've a coffee of one.
[00:01:49] Elon Musk: Usually in the mornings.
[00:01:51] One a day kind of thing?
[00:01:52] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, pretty much.
[00:01:57] You want to wait for it?
[00:01:59] Nikhil Kamath: No, I'm good.
[00:02:06] The first thing I must say is you're a lot bigger and bulkier muscular than I would have thought you are.
[00:02:14] Nikhil Kamath: I'll stop you if you want to make me blush.
[00:02:17] Elon Musk: Really?
[00:02:20] Elon Musk: Yeah, I mean look on the internet I'm small, you know.
[00:02:27] Elon Musk: Essentially what percentage of internet is spend on Twitter?
[00:02:34] Is there a number to it?
[00:02:36] Nikhil Kamath: Well, we have like about 600 million monthly users.
[00:02:41] Elon Musk: Although it can spike up if there's some major event in the world.
[00:02:46] Elon Musk: It can get up to 800 million or a billion if there's some major event in the world.
[00:02:53] Elon Musk: So, this 250-300 million per week type of thing.
[00:03:02] Elon Musk: It's a pretty decent number.
[00:03:04] Elon Musk: It tends to be readers, you know, people that read words.
[00:03:11] Do you think that'll change?
[00:03:14] Yeah, I mean there's certainly a lot of video on the X system.
[00:03:21] Elon Musk: But at this point, increasing amounts of video.
[00:03:24] Elon Musk: But I think where the X network is strongest is among people who think a lot and read a lot.
[00:03:36] So that's where it's going to be strongest because we have words.
[00:03:42] Elon Musk: So among readers, writers and thinkers, I think X is number one in the world.
[00:03:51] As far as social media goes, the form factor, if you had to wage a reggae for tomorrow.
[00:03:58] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[00:03:59] Nikhil Kamath: How much is text, how much is video?
[00:04:02] I've heard you speak about maybe voice and hearing being the next form of communication with AI.
[00:04:08] Nikhil Kamath: What happens to X in its true form?
[00:04:12] Nikhil Kamath: How does it evolve?
[00:04:14] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, so I do think most interaction is going to be video in the future.
[00:04:19] Elon Musk: Most interaction is going to be a real-time video with AI.
[00:04:22] Elon Musk: So real-time video, car pension, real-time video generation.
[00:04:26] Elon Musk: That's going to be most of the load.
[00:04:29] Elon Musk: And that's how it is for most of the internet right now.
[00:04:31] Elon Musk: It's so, most of the internet is video.
[00:04:34] Elon Musk: Text is a pretty small percentage.
[00:04:37] But the text tends to be higher value generally.
[00:04:41] Elon Musk: Or more, it's more densely compressed information.
[00:04:45] Elon Musk: Like, yeah.
[00:04:48] So, maybe if you say, what is the most amount of bits generated and compute spent,
[00:04:55] it's certainly going to be video.
[00:04:57] Elon Musk: So it has to be a sharedholder of X, a very small one.
[00:05:00] Nikhil Kamath: And I got paid when you bought it.
[00:05:02] Nikhil Kamath: When you bought it in the media.
[00:05:04] Nikhil Kamath: Happy decision?
[00:05:06] Glad you did it?
[00:05:08] Elon Musk: Yeah, yeah. I think it was important.
[00:05:11] I felt like Twitter was heading ahead, had gone in direction that had sort of been more of a negative influence on the world.
[00:05:20] It was, I mean, of course, this depends on one's perspective.
[00:05:24] Elon Musk: Some people will say, well, actually, they liked where it was and now they don't like it.
[00:05:29] Elon Musk: But I think the fundamental thing was that Twitter was amplifying,
[00:05:38] Elon Musk: I would say, a fairly pretty far left by most people's standards in the world's ideology,
[00:05:43] Elon Musk: because where it was based in San Francisco.
[00:05:46] Elon Musk: And they actually suspended a lot of people on the right.
[00:05:50] Elon Musk: So, from their perspective, even someone in the center would be far right.
[00:05:57] Elon Musk: If you're free to fall left, any one of the centers is far right.
[00:06:00] Elon Musk: Because it's just a political spectrum.
[00:06:03] Elon Musk: They're just as far left as you get in the United States in San Francisco.
[00:06:08] Elon Musk: So what I've tried to do is just restore it to be balanced and a centerist.
[00:06:13] Elon Musk: So there haven't been any left-wing voices that have been suspended or banned or de-amplified or anything like that.
[00:06:22] Elon Musk: Now, some of them have chosen to just go somewhere else.
[00:06:26] Elon Musk: But at this point, it is the operating principle of the X system is to adhere to any country's laws,
[00:06:37] Elon Musk: but not to put our thumb on the scale beyond the laws of the country.
[00:06:43] When I think of social media, thank you.
[00:06:48] When I think of social media, Elon,
[00:06:52] I feel like even data suggests that the current incumbents seem to be losing traction amongst the youngest of audience.
[00:07:01] Nikhil Kamath: Even platforms like Instagram, they're not exactly like Twitter, but platforms across the board.
[00:07:08] Nikhil Kamath: If one had to rework social media and build something, bottom up, what do you think could work for the world of tomorrow?
[00:07:18] Well, I don't think that much about social media to be frank.
[00:07:25] Elon Musk: I can mostly just want to have something where there's a, in the case of X kind of a global town square, where people can say what they want to say with words, pictures, video,
[00:07:42] whether it's a secure messaging system, we've recently added the ability to do audio and video calls.
[00:07:50] Elon Musk: So, really trying to bring the world together into a collective consciousness.
[00:07:59] Elon Musk: And that's, I guess, different from just saying, like, what is the most dopamine generating video stream that one could make?
[00:08:12] Which, you know, I think can be a little bit of brain rot, frankly.
[00:08:17] Elon Musk: You know, if you're just watching videos that just cause dopamine hits one after another, but lack substance, then I think those are not great.
[00:08:27] Elon Musk: That's not a great way to spend time.
[00:08:30] Elon Musk: But I do think that's actually what a lot of people are going to want to watch.
[00:08:36] So, if you say, like, total internet usage, it's going to probably be optimizing for, you know, your neurotransmitter generation.
[00:08:46] Elon Musk: Like, it is somebody getting like a kick out of it.
[00:08:49] Elon Musk: Right.
[00:08:50] Elon Musk: But it becomes like a drug type of thing.
[00:08:52] Elon Musk: So, I'm not really after, my goal is not to do that.
[00:08:59] I guess I could do that, if I wanted to, but that's, I just want to really,
[00:09:05] Elon Musk: have a goal platform that brings together, like, it becomes as close to sort of a collective consciousness of humanity as possible.
[00:09:18] Elon Musk: And, you know, like, and one of the things that we've introduced, for example, is automatic translation.
[00:09:27] Elon Musk: So, because I think it would be great to bring together what people say in many different languages.
[00:09:36] Elon Musk: And, but automatically translated for the recipient.
[00:09:40] Elon Musk: So, you have the collective consciousness, not just of, of say, people in a particular language group, but you have the thoughts of people in, you know, every language group.
[00:09:53] And why is that important deal, collective consciousness, to have one platform?
[00:09:58] Nikhil Kamath: I guess, uh, why is that important?
[00:10:12] I guess it's, you can also say like, why?
[00:10:15] Elon Musk: You know, if you consider humans, like humans are composed of around 30 to 40 trillion cells.
[00:10:26] And, you know, there's trillions of synapses in your mind.
[00:10:35] But, but, but, but there's, there's not, the, the, the, the why of it, I mean, I guess it's just so we can increase our understanding, our understanding, increase our,
[00:10:50] our understanding of the universe.
[00:10:54] Elon Musk: So, I guess I, I like, I had this sort of question about what's the meaning of life, you know, like why, why is anything important?
[00:11:14] Elon Musk: You know, why, why, why are we here?
[00:11:17] Elon Musk: What's the origin of the universe? Where, what is the end?
[00:11:23] What are the questions that we don't even know to ask?
[00:11:29] And probably the questions we don't even know to ask are the most important ones.
[00:11:35] Elon Musk: So, I'm just trying to, I guess understand what's going on, what is, what is going on in this reality?
[00:11:42] Elon Musk: Is, is this reality?
[00:11:46] And, and where did you get when you asked what is the point of life?
[00:11:55] Yeah, so I, I came to the conclusion that, which is somewhat in the Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy School of Thought, which is...
[00:12:08] Elon Musk: What do you do?
[00:12:10] Yeah, you know, he sort of, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is like a broken philosophy disguised as humor.
[00:12:17] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:12:18] Nikhil Kamath: And the, that's where you get the, you know, earth turns out to be this computer to understand, to get to figure out the answer of the meaning of life.
[00:12:28] Elon Musk: And it comes up with the answer 42.
[00:12:30] Elon Musk: And, but then it's like, what does 42 mean?
[00:12:35] Elon Musk: And it turns out, well, actually the hard part is the question, not the answer.
[00:12:41] And for that, you need a much bigger computer than that.
[00:12:44] Elon Musk: So basically what Douglas Adams was saying is that we actually don't know how to frame the questions properly.
[00:12:49] Elon Musk: And, and so, so I think by expanding the scope and scale of consciousness, we can better understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe.
[00:13:02] Elon Musk: Do you believe the collective consciousness of society?
[00:13:08] You know, when, when I was watching this movie recently called The Gladiator, Russell Crowe, and you know?
[00:13:14] Yeah.
[00:13:15] In Gladiator, in Rome, when people are fighting, and the crowd is cheering when people kill each other,
[00:13:24] Nikhil Kamath: the collective is very much like the mob.
[00:13:29] Nikhil Kamath: It doesn't have nuance in its opinion, per se.
[00:13:34] Nikhil Kamath: Well, I, that's just particularly kind of mob.
[00:13:37] Elon Musk: I mean, there's sort of going there to see people kill each other, you know?
[00:13:41] Elon Musk: You suspect the society we live in today is very different?
[00:13:44] Nikhil Kamath: We don't, we don't generally, at this point, we don't, you know, go watch people kill each other.
[00:13:52] Maybe you, some kind of euphemism of that.
[00:13:56] Nikhil Kamath: Sports, I suppose.
[00:13:58] Elon Musk: So people do sports without, where teams attempt to defeat each other, but might minus the death.
[00:14:07] Elon Musk: Right.
[00:14:08] Elon Musk: So, just going back to the consideration of a human, he all started out as one cell, but now we are over 30 trillion cells.
[00:14:21] And, but I think most people like feel like they're one, one body.
[00:14:30] Elon Musk: Like, you know, usually your right hand is not fighting your left hand type of thing, you know?
[00:14:34] Elon Musk: So, chances sort of cooperate.
[00:14:38] Elon Musk: Your mind is, you know, just a vast number of neurons.
[00:14:48] Elon Musk: But, but most of the time it doesn't feel like there's, you know, a trillion voices in your brain, hopefully not.
[00:14:56] So, so there, there's clearly more that happens when you have trillions of cells working as a cellular collective than say one cell.
[00:15:11] Or a small, you know, small multisother creature, there's, there's clearly some, something different that happens.
[00:15:19] Elon Musk: Like, you can't talk to a bacteria, you know, there's very silence.
[00:15:24] Elon Musk: They're just sort of wiggle around and, you know, from their perspective, I don't know, I was sort of, what is, what is life like from the perspective of a, of an amoeba, you know?
[00:15:33] Elon Musk: But I know you can't talk to amoeba, like they don't talk back, but you can talk to humans.
[00:15:39] So, there's just something, obviously qualitatively, fundamentally different for humans once you have a large number of cells and, you know, sufficiently large brain type of thing, there's, you now talk to humans.
[00:15:57] Elon Musk: And they think, and they can say things, they can produce things.
[00:16:02] But bacteria are not going to produce a spaceship, for example.
[00:16:06] But humans can.
[00:16:08] So, I think there's something qualitatively different that also happens when there's a collection of humans.
[00:16:14] Elon Musk: In fact, in fact, it's safe to say that a single human cannot make a spaceship.
[00:16:17] Elon Musk: I could not make a spaceship by myself.
[00:16:19] Elon Musk: But, but with a collection of humans, we can make spaceships.
[00:16:24] Elon Musk: So, there's, there's something, obviously, qualitatively different about a collection of humans.
[00:16:33] Elon Musk: In fact, it would be impossible for me to learn all of the areas of expertise.
[00:16:38] Elon Musk: There wouldn't be enough time in one lifetime to even learn all the things before I was dead.
[00:16:43] Elon Musk: So, so you really fundamentally have to have a collection of humans to make a rocket.
[00:16:52] Then, I think there are probably some other scaling, qualitative scaling things that happen when you have groups of humans.
[00:17:01] And then, if the quality of the interaction, of the quality of the information flow,
[00:17:09] Elon Musk: the better it is, the more the human collective will achieve.
[00:17:15] Elon Musk: And I like to say that I'm just curious about the nature of the universe.
[00:17:20] Elon Musk: And I think if we, it's safe to say, like if we increase the scope, the scale of consciousness,
[00:17:27] Elon Musk: we're much more likely to understand the nature of the universe than if we produce it.
[00:17:35] Is that a bit like spirituality?
[00:17:37] Nikhil Kamath: A lot of people talk to me about spirituality.
[00:17:40] Nikhil Kamath: Right.
[00:17:41] Elon Musk: I still don't know what it actually means.
[00:17:43] Nikhil Kamath: Like, I keep asking them, what do you mean?
[00:17:45] Nikhil Kamath: What do you mean?
[00:17:47] Elon Musk: I mean, a lot of people have spiritual feelings.
[00:17:50] Elon Musk: Right.
[00:17:52] And I wouldn't try to deny that those spiritual feelings are real to them.
[00:17:58] Elon Musk: But it's, it's, it's, it is entirely translate.
[00:18:03] Elon Musk: I can't just because somebody else has a spiritual feeling doesn't mean that I would have that spiritual feeling.
[00:18:09] So, you know, I tend to be kind of physics pulled, which is, like if something has predictive value,
[00:18:17] Elon Musk: then, you know, pay more attention to it than if it doesn't have predictive value.
[00:18:22] Elon Musk: Right.
[00:18:24] Elon Musk: So, you know, physics, I would say, is a study of that which has predictive value.
[00:18:29] Elon Musk: I think it's a pretty good definition.
[00:18:32] Elon Musk: My primary job, Elon, is a talk broker and stock investor.
[00:18:37] Nikhil Kamath: Okay.
[00:18:38] Elon Musk: There is no predictive value.
[00:18:39] Nikhil Kamath: Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow.
[00:18:41] Well, but I think you can generally say, you know, that if it's long term for a company, then you can say, like, well, does that, is that, do you like the products or services of that company?
[00:18:57] Elon Musk: And is it likely to, do you like the product roadmap?
[00:19:01] Elon Musk: Do you like, it seems like they, they make great products and they're likely to make great products.
[00:19:07] And the future, if that's the case, then I would say that's probably a good company to invest in.
[00:19:14] And I think you also want to believe in the team.
[00:19:16] Elon Musk: So, if they, well, that's a talented and hardworking team.
[00:19:19] Elon Musk: They make good products today.
[00:19:21] Elon Musk: They seem to be still motivated to make things in the future.
[00:19:24] Elon Musk: Then I say, that's a good company to invest in.
[00:19:27] They have one.
[00:19:28] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:19:30] That, that, that's more and so for the daily fluctuations, which happen and sometimes are pretty extreme.
[00:19:37] Elon Musk: But over time, it's what that, that is the, the right way to invest in stocks.
[00:19:43] Elon Musk: Because a company is just a group of people assembled to create products and services.
[00:19:48] Elon Musk: So you have to say, well, what are, how good are those products and services?
[00:19:52] Elon Musk: Are they likely to continue to improve in the future?
[00:19:54] Elon Musk: So then you should buy the soccer company and then don't worry too much about the daily fluctuations.
[00:19:59] Elon Musk: Right.
[00:20:01] What's got you most excited now, Elon, in terms of all that you're building, you're doing so much.
[00:20:08] Nikhil Kamath: So let me just preface and contextualize who is watching this.
[00:20:13] Nikhil Kamath: Our audience is largely, want to be entrepreneurs in India.
[00:20:19] Nikhil Kamath: Okay.
[00:20:20] Really ambitious, really hungry, want to take the risk and build something.
[00:20:27] And I feel like all of us have so much to learn from you because you've done it so many times over and so many different domains.
[00:20:33] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[00:20:34] Elon Musk: So we will speak to them today and I will try and center all my questions in that direction so they can take advantage of this conversation and maybe start take a chance and build something.
[00:20:46] Okay.
[00:20:47] Sure.
[00:20:52] Yeah, I guess the most important thing to do is just make useful products and services.
[00:21:01] Yeah.
[00:21:03] Which one of all that all the products and services that you're building has got you most excited today?
[00:21:12] Well, I think that there's increasingly a convergence actually between space, sex and Tesla and XAI.
[00:21:20] And that if the future is solar powered AI satellite, which is pretty much needs to be in order to in order to harness a non-trivial amount of the energy of the sun, you have to move to solar powered AI satellites in deep space.
[00:21:40] Elon Musk: Which somewhat is a complex of Tesla expertise and space expertise and XAI on the AI front.
[00:21:50] Elon Musk: So it just feel like over time there's somewhat of a convergence there.
[00:21:56] But all the companies are doing doing great things, very part of the teams that do great work.
[00:22:02] So we're making great progress with Tesla on the autonomous driving.
[00:22:07] Elon Musk: And if you've tried the self-driving, maybe try it.
[00:22:11] Elon Musk: I've tried it in the V-mo, not in the Tesla.
[00:22:13] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, it's worth trying.
[00:22:15] We actually have it here in Austin.
[00:22:17] Elon Musk: Yeah, I love to try it.
[00:22:19] Nikhil Kamath: You can literally just download Tesla app.
[00:22:21] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:22:22] Elon Musk: And I think it's open to anyone.
[00:22:24] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:22:25] Elon Musk: Definitely try it out.
[00:22:26] Elon Musk: You know, how it goes.
[00:22:29] Elon Musk: But we've made a lot of progress with electric vehicles, with battery packs and solar.
[00:22:36] Elon Musk: And very much so with self-driving.
[00:22:40] So basically real world AI.
[00:22:43] Elon Musk: Tesla is the world leader in real world AI, I would say.
[00:22:47] Elon Musk: So.
[00:22:49] And then we're going to be making this robot optimist, which is starting production hopefully some next year.
[00:22:55] Elon Musk: At scale.
[00:22:58] And I think that's going to be pretty cool.
[00:23:01] Elon Musk: That'll be like everyone's going to want their own personal C3PO R2D2, you know, helper robot.
[00:23:06] Like it would be pretty cool.
[00:23:09] And then SpaceX is doing great work with the stalling program, you know, providing low cost, reliable internet throughout the world.
[00:23:20] Elon Musk: Hopefully India, so we'd love to be operating in India.
[00:23:24] Elon Musk: That would be great.
[00:23:26] Elon Musk: We're operating in 150 different countries now with stalling.
[00:23:29] Can you give me a bit about stalling and how the tech works?
[00:23:32] Nikhil Kamath: Because somebody else speaking to, I don't know if you know this company called NETA, out of San Francisco.
[00:23:38] Nikhil Kamath: They're trying to replace network engineers.
[00:23:41] So he was telling me about how intensely populated areas, stalling works differently than it might be.
[00:23:49] Nikhil Kamath: In a place with not as many people.
[00:23:52] Nikhil Kamath: Can you explain how it works?
[00:23:54] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, so I think there's several thousand satellites in low with orbit.
[00:23:59] Elon Musk: And they're moving around 25 times the speed of sound in these, you know, the zipping around the earth basically.
[00:24:07] Elon Musk: And they're at an altitude of about 550 kilometers, which is called in a generally low with orbit.
[00:24:16] Elon Musk: Because they're at low with orbit, the latency is low.
[00:24:22] Because of distances is not that far compared to a geostationary satellite at 36,000 kilometers.
[00:24:30] So you've got thousands of satellites providing low latency, high speed internet throughout the world.
[00:24:42] Elon Musk: And they are interconnected as well.
[00:24:46] Elon Musk: So there are laser links between the satellites.
[00:24:49] Elon Musk: So it forms sort of a laser mesh.
[00:24:52] Let's say if cables are damaged or cut, like fiber cables, the satellites can accumulate between each other and provide connectivity, even if the cables are cut.
[00:25:07] Elon Musk: So for example, when the Red Sea cables were cut, I think a few months ago, the satellite network continued to function without a hitch.
[00:25:17] Elon Musk: So it's particularly helpful for disaster areas.
[00:25:21] Elon Musk: But if an area has been hit with some kind of natural disaster floods or fires or earthquakes, that tends to damage the ground infrastructure.
[00:25:31] Elon Musk: But the stalling satellites still work.
[00:25:34] So, and generally whenever there's some sort of natural disaster somewhere, we always provide people with free stalling internet connectivity.
[00:25:42] Elon Musk: We don't take advantage of a tragic situation.
[00:25:49] Elon Musk: So if there's natural disasters, we're like, OK, it's free during the natural disaster.
[00:25:55] Elon Musk: We don't want to say like, put a paywall up while somebody's trying to get help.
[00:26:01] Elon Musk: That would be wrong.
[00:26:04] Elon Musk: So that's, it's a very robust system.
[00:26:08] Elon Musk: It's complementary to ground systems because the satellite beams work best in sparsely populated areas.
[00:26:19] Because you've got a satellite beam, it's a pretty big beam.
[00:26:23] Elon Musk: And you have a fixed number of users per beam.
[00:26:26] Elon Musk: So it tends to be very complementary to the ground-based cellular systems.
[00:26:32] Elon Musk: Because those are very good in cities.
[00:26:34] Elon Musk: Because you've got these cell towers that are only a kilometer apart type of thing.
[00:26:41] But cell towers tend to be inefficient in the countryside.
[00:26:45] Elon Musk: So in rural areas is where you tend to have the worst internet.
[00:26:50] Elon Musk: It's very expensive and difficult to do all the fiber optic cables or to have high bandwidth cellular towers.
[00:27:01] Elon Musk: So stalling is very complementary to the existing telecom companies.
[00:27:08] Elon Musk: It basically tends to serve the least served, which I think is good.
[00:27:15] Elon Musk: Will that change tomorrow?
[00:27:18] Nikhil Kamath: Like today as you explained, the beam is quite broad.
[00:27:21] Nikhil Kamath: And it can't work in a densely populated area with high buildings may be.
[00:27:26] But can that change?
[00:27:27] And tomorrow it becomes really efficient in a densely populated city,
[00:27:32] Nikhil Kamath: where it is competitive with the local network providers.
[00:27:35] Nikhil Kamath: Unfortunately, the physics don't allow for that.
[00:27:39] Elon Musk: So we're too far away.
[00:27:42] So at 550 kilometers, even if we try to reduce it, which about as low as we can go is about 350 kilometers,
[00:27:49] Elon Musk: still very far away.
[00:27:52] You can think of like a flashlight, which is, you know, that flashlight has got a cone.
[00:27:59] Elon Musk: And that cone is coming at, you know, today, 550 kilometers in the future,
[00:28:05] Elon Musk: we're trying to get down to 350 kilometers.
[00:28:07] Elon Musk: But we can't be something that's 1 kilometer away.
[00:28:10] Elon Musk: Which the cell tower physics is not on our side here.
[00:28:14] Elon Musk: So it's not physically possible for us to start to serve densely populated cities.
[00:28:21] Elon Musk: You can serve a little bit, maybe 1% of the population.
[00:28:24] Elon Musk: And sometimes people get, you know, even in crowded cities, there might be, you know, no fiber link up their road.
[00:28:31] Elon Musk: Like sometimes there's somebody's on a cul-de-sac or something, or in a place in cities
[00:28:37] Elon Musk: that sometimes underserved areas for random reasons.
[00:28:41] Elon Musk: And so, Sonic can serve, like, it may be 1% or 2% of a densely populated city.
[00:28:49] Elon Musk: But it can be much more effective in, like, send rural areas where the internet connection is much worse.
[00:28:56] Elon Musk: And often people either have, sometimes, no access to internet, or it's extremely expensive,
[00:29:01] Elon Musk: or the quality is not very good.
[00:29:05] If I were to ask you to measure a guessy-lon, do you think India will go down the path of urbanization, like China did,
[00:29:13] Nikhil Kamath: with more people moving in from rural economies to urban centers?
[00:29:19] Nikhil Kamath: Well, I suppose some amount of that has happened, right?
[00:29:24] Elon Musk: I mean, I'm curious to ask you some questions as well,
[00:29:28] Elon Musk: because, of course, isn't that the trend, or is it not the trend in India?
[00:29:34] It is the trend largely. I think a little bit changed during COVID when a lot of urbanization slowed down.
[00:29:40] Nikhil Kamath: And that was not organic. It was very artificially manifest.
[00:29:46] Nikhil Kamath: But one does question that with AI, if productivity were to go up,
[00:29:55] Nikhil Kamath: and I heard you speak about UHI instead of UBI.
[00:30:00] Nikhil Kamath: I think it will be universal hire come.
[00:30:03] Elon Musk: In a world like that, I wonder if more people want to live in cities which are always going to be more polluted
[00:30:12] Nikhil Kamath: and not offer the quality of lifestyle that a rural environment might.
[00:30:17] Nikhil Kamath: Well, I guess it's up to some people want to be around a lot of people and some people don't.
[00:30:22] Elon Musk: It's going to be a matter of personal choice.
[00:30:24] Elon Musk: But I think in the future, it won't be the case that you have to be in a city for your job.
[00:30:31] Because I think my prediction is in the future working will be optimal.
[00:30:37] Nikhil Kamath: We seem to be moving from not in India, but in some parts of the West from six days to five days to four days to three.
[00:30:44] Nikhil Kamath: Not me.
[00:30:48] Elon Musk: I think the Europeans.
[00:30:50] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:54] If you try to make a startup succeed or try to make a company do very difficult things,
[00:31:05] then you definitely need to put in serious hours.
[00:31:08] Elon Musk: That's how it goes.
[00:31:11] And if we were to move from five to four to three days, how do you think society changes?
[00:31:16] Nikhil Kamath: When people have to work half the week, what do they do with the other half?
[00:31:21] I think it will actually be that people don't have to work at all.
[00:31:25] Elon Musk: It may not be that far in the future, maybe only at an attend, I say less than 20 years.
[00:31:33] My prediction is less than 20 years working will be optional, working at all will be optional.
[00:31:42] Like a hobby.
[00:31:46] And that would be because of increased productivity, meaning people do not have to work?
[00:31:52] They don't have to buy it.
[00:31:54] Obviously, people can play this back in 20 years and say, look, Elon made this ridiculous prediction, and it's not true.
[00:32:00] Elon Musk: But I think it will turn out to be true that in less than 20 years, that maybe even as little as, I don't know, 10 or 15 years,
[00:32:12] Elon Musk: the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional.
[00:32:21] Elon Musk: In the same way that likes say, you can grow your own vegetables in your garden, or you can go to the store and buy vegetables.
[00:32:33] Elon Musk: Much harder to grow your own vegetables.
[00:32:36] Elon Musk: But some people like to grow their vegetables, which is fine.
[00:32:39] Elon Musk: But it will be optional in that way, it's my prediction.
[00:32:44] If one were to argue that humans are innately competitive, and everything is relative, from the time of hunters, somebody wanted to be the alpha hunter or the biggest farmer,
[00:32:56] Nikhil Kamath: if everybody gets a universal high income, and everybody has enough.
[00:33:02] Nikhil Kamath: What are you competing for?
[00:33:05] Nikhil Kamath: It would be relative, right? Like, if we all had enough, enough is not enough.
[00:33:11] Yeah, I guess I'm not exactly sure.
[00:33:17] Elon Musk: We're really headed into the singularity as it's called, which for refer to AI sometimes as the black hole, like a singularity, you don't know what happens after the event horizon.
[00:33:28] Elon Musk: It doesn't mean that something bad happens, just means you don't know what happens.
[00:33:34] So, like, I'm confident that if AI and robotics continue to advance, which are advancing very rapidly, like I said, working will be optional, and people will have any goods and services that they want.
[00:33:52] If you can think of it, you can have a type of thing.
[00:33:57] But then, at a certain point, AI will actually saturate on anything humans can think of.
[00:34:06] And then, at that point, it becomes a situation where AI is doing things for AI and robotics, or doing things for AI and robotics, because they run out of things to do to make the humans happy.
[00:34:20] Because there's a limit. People can only eat so much food, or, you know, I just can't be, I think if you can think of it, you can have it, will be the future.
[00:34:33] Elon Musk: You know, the Austrian School of Economics, if you go back in time, there was a digression from Adam Smith.
[00:34:40] Nikhil Kamath: They talk about the marginal utility of everything. Having one of something has value, having two of the same thing has lesser value, and having ten of the same thing has no value.
[00:34:51] Nikhil Kamath: So, if we could have everything we wanted, maybe...
[00:34:54] Nikhil Kamath: Ten marshmallows, I mean, who wants that?
[00:34:58] One's it, one's planning.
[00:35:02] This is a marshmallow test, you can have two marshmallows later, or one marshmallow now, and I'm like, I don't want two marshmallows.
[00:35:08] Elon Musk: That's interesting, what's it?
[00:35:11] Nikhil Kamath: What would you pick?
[00:35:13] One marshmallow is enough. I always question marshmallows as being not the best candidate.
[00:35:20] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:35:22] Elon Musk: But I don't yearn for marshmallows.
[00:35:25] Elon Musk: I think you're a bank.
[00:35:27] Nikhil Kamath: Who does?
[00:35:29] You're the best testament to the marshmallow experiment.
[00:35:32] Nikhil Kamath: I think...
[00:35:33] Nikhil Kamath: I suppose so.
[00:35:34] Elon Musk: I mean, I like delayed gratification, essentially.
[00:35:37] Elon Musk: You're able to delay it more than most. I have a tattoo which says, you're a gratification.
[00:35:41] Nikhil Kamath: Wow, okay, can you really take your marshmallow and test it all?
[00:35:47] I feel like I can't remember. When I'm treating or when I'm buying it.
[00:35:50] Nikhil Kamath: Delayed gratification, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:52] Elon Musk: It helps.
[00:35:53] Elon Musk: Wow, okay, that's the...
[00:35:54] Elon Musk: And it's pointing at me, so it reminds me of...
[00:36:00] Okay, it was. It's good advice. I mean, I can't miss it, you know.
[00:36:04] Elon Musk: If you could get a tattoo, what would you get?
[00:36:09] I guess maybe my kids' names or something.
[00:36:11] Elon Musk: Right.
[00:36:13] Why do you like the letter X as much as you do?
[00:36:17] Well...
[00:36:23] I mean, yeah, it's a good question, honestly.
[00:36:26] Elon Musk: Sometimes I wonder what's strongest me.
[00:36:39] I mean, it's subtle with where I think it's a way back in ancient times in 99.
[00:36:48] The pre-camarin era when there were only sponges.
[00:36:52] There were only three one-letter domain names.
[00:36:58] Elon Musk: And I think it's XQ and Z.
[00:37:01] Elon Musk: And I was like, okay, I want to create this place where it's the financial crossroads or like the financial exchange.
[00:37:12] Elon Musk: You know, essentially solving money from an information theory standpoint where the current banking system is a large number of heterogeneous databases with batch processing that are not secure.
[00:37:32] Elon Musk: And if we could have a sort of a single database that was real-time and secure, that would be more efficient for an information theory standpoint than a large number of heterogeneous databases that batch process very slowly and securely.
[00:37:53] Elon Musk: So that was sort of X.com way back in the day, which kind of became PayPal.
[00:38:06] And then it was acquired by eBay.
[00:38:10] And then eBay, someone who's out from eBay said, hey, do you want to buy the domain name back? And I was like, sure.
[00:38:15] Elon Musk: And so I had the domain name for quite a while.
[00:38:19] And then, yes.
[00:38:27] Elon Musk: Then I was like, well, maybe this acquiring Twitter would also be an opportunity to revisit the original plan of X.com, which is to create this clearinghouse of financial transactions.
[00:38:46] Elon Musk: And then I was like, basically, to create a more efficient database, money database.
[00:38:53] Elon Musk: Like, money is really an information system for labor allocation.
[00:39:00] Elon Musk: If you will think money is power in and of itself, but it doesn't really.
[00:39:04] Elon Musk: If there's no labor to allocate, it's meaningless.
[00:39:07] Elon Musk: So if you were to be on a desert island with a trillion dollars, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[00:39:14] Elon Musk: Oh, yeah. Why speculate when you can be real?
[00:39:21] I just hope I don't end up on the desert island.
[00:39:24] Elon Musk: It's not going to be very useful to me.
[00:39:27] But it illustrates my point that if you're stranded on a desert island with a trillion dollars, it's not useful.
[00:39:35] Elon Musk: Because there's no labor to allocate yourself.
[00:39:42] Elon Musk: So it's, say, anyway.
[00:39:45] Elon Musk: So it's so, this long-winded way of saying that it's just really like, I'm just kind of slowly building, revisiting this idea that I had 25 years ago to create a more efficient,
[00:40:02] Elon Musk: money database.
[00:40:09] And if that's successful, people will use it. If it's not successful, they won't use it.
[00:40:14] Elon Musk: And then I also like that idea of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there.
[00:40:27] So China has this with WeChat, where you can exchange information, you can publish information, you can exchange money, you can live their life on WeChat in China.
[00:40:45] Elon Musk: And it's quite useful, but there's no real WeChat outside of China.
[00:40:50] Elon Musk: So it's like, WeChat plus plus, I'd say, is the idea for X.
[00:40:57] Elon Musk: Anyway, space exploration technologies is the full name of the company.
[00:41:03] Elon Musk: But it's like, that's too much, that's a mouthful.
[00:41:05] Elon Musk: So it's like, we'll just call it SpaceX, like FedEx for space.
[00:41:10] Elon Musk: It just has to have us have X in the, you know, just exploration as an X.
[00:41:15] Elon Musk: And I was like, I like the dev capitalizing the X just artistically.
[00:41:20] Elon Musk: So then that's why it's SpaceX.
[00:41:25] Elon Musk: And then, what else we got? We got a kid. He's called X2.
[00:41:32] Elon Musk: But his mother is the one that named him X.
[00:41:37] Elon Musk: And I said, you know, people are really going to think about X.
[00:41:41] If we name our kid X2, you know, and I said to her, like, look, I do have X.com.
[00:41:49] So people are going to really think I've got to have somewhat of a fetish for this letter.
[00:41:54] Elon Musk: But she said, no, she likes X and she wants to call them X and like, okay.
[00:41:59] Elon Musk: Is this a new thing? Or have you had it growing up?
[00:42:02] I'm saying it's somewhat of a creates coincidence.
[00:42:07] Elon Musk: Like, not everything's called X. I mean, Tesla isn't there's no X isn't Tesla either.
[00:42:14] What do you think money will be in the future, Elon?
[00:42:18] I think long term, I think money disappears as a concept, honestly.
[00:42:26] Elon Musk: It's kind of strange, but in a future where anyone can have anything,
[00:42:33] Elon Musk: I think you no longer need money as a database for labor allocation.
[00:42:40] Elon Musk: If AI and robotics are big enough to satisfy all human needs, then money is no longer...
[00:42:50] It's relevance declines dramatically. I'm not sure we will have it.
[00:42:55] Elon Musk: So, in the best sort of imagining of this future that I've read is from INBANKS, the Culture Books.
[00:43:06] Elon Musk: So I recommend people read the Culture Books. In the sort of far future of the Culture Books,
[00:43:13] Elon Musk: there's they don't have money either. And everyone can pretty much have one of them.
[00:43:20] So, there's still some fundamental currencies, if you will, that are physics-based.
[00:43:29] Elon Musk: So, energy is the true currency. This is why I said bitcoin is based on energy.
[00:43:36] Elon Musk: You can't legislate energy. You can't just pass a law and suddenly have a lot of energy.
[00:43:44] It's very difficult to generate energy, especially the honest energy in a useful way to do useful work.
[00:43:53] Elon Musk: So, I think that probably we'll probably want to have money and probably we'll just have energy, you know, power generation as the de facto currency.
[00:44:10] So, I mean, I think one way to frame civilizational progress is the percentage completion on the Culture Shelf scale.
[00:44:19] Elon Musk: So, what, you know, Culture Shelf one is what percentage of a planet's energy are you successfully turning into useful work?
[00:44:29] Elon Musk: And I'm maybe paraphrasing here a little bit. But, the Culture Shelf two would be what percentage of the Sun's energy are you converting into useful work?
[00:44:39] Culture Shelf three would be what percentage of the galaxy are you converting into useful work?
[00:44:48] So, things really, I think, become energy-based.
[00:44:53] But, if you have solar, power, AI, satellites, energy is also free and abundant.
[00:44:57] Nikhil Kamath: Because we'll never be able to utilize all the solar energy available to us.
[00:45:02] Nikhil Kamath: So, it can't be a store of wealth, essentially, in that list, can it?
[00:45:08] You know, there's not really, you can't really store wealth. You can only accumulate numbers into currently.
[00:45:21] Elon Musk: Currently, you can accumulate numbers in a database that allow you to, to send the behavior of other humans in particular directions.
[00:45:36] Elon Musk: And I guess people call that wealth. But again, if there's no humans around, there's no wealth accumulation is meaningless.
[00:45:44] Elon Musk: This is a digression. But if you were to consider food as the energy for a human to thrive.
[00:45:50] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, it proved its energy, it's literally a calorie, it just means energy.
[00:45:54] Elon Musk: So, can a farm which is self-sustaining be a commodity that is...
[00:45:58] Nikhil Kamath: I'm not sure what that means, but, you know, this...
[00:46:07] Elon Musk: I think, at a certain point, you do complete the cycle where...
[00:46:15] Elon Musk: I think at a certain point, you decouple from the conventional economy.
[00:46:22] Elon Musk: If you have AI and robots producing chips and solar panels and mining resources in order to make chips and robots in order to make...
[00:46:41] You sort of complete that cycle. Once that cycle is complete...
[00:46:45] Elon Musk: I think that's the point at which you decouple from the monetary system.
[00:46:50] Elon Musk: Is that the way forward for the US by virtue of how much debt they have today?
[00:46:58] Do they deflate away their currency and transition into this new form and lead that push? Because it would make more sense to them?
[00:47:06] Nikhil Kamath: Well, in this future that I'm talking about, the notion of countries becomes sort of enacting the system.
[00:47:14] Elon Musk: Do you believe in it today?
[00:47:19] Nikhil Kamath: I certainly believe in it today. I want to just separate something that...
[00:47:25] Elon Musk: This is just what I think will happen based on what I see as opposed to...
[00:47:30] Elon Musk: I think these are fundamentally good things and I'm trying to make them happen.
[00:47:34] Elon Musk: I think this would happen with or without me, whether or not.
[00:47:40] Elon Musk: As long as civilization keeps advancing, we will have AI and robotics at very large scale.
[00:47:47] Elon Musk: I think that's pretty much the only thing that's going to solve for the US debt crisis.
[00:47:59] Elon Musk: Because currently the US debt is insanely high and the interest payments in the debt exceed the entire military budget of the United States.
[00:48:09] Elon Musk: It's just the interest payments and that's at least in the short term going to continue to increase.
[00:48:16] Elon Musk: I think actually the only thing that can solve for the debt situation is the AI and robotics.
[00:48:23] Elon Musk: But it will more than...
[00:48:26] It might cause... I guess it probably would cause significant deflation because deflation or inflation is...
[00:48:36] Elon Musk: The ratio of goods and services produced to the change in the money supply.
[00:48:41] Elon Musk: If goods and services output increases fast in the money supply, you will have deflation.
[00:48:47] Elon Musk: If real goods and services output increases slower than the money supply, you have inflation.
[00:48:55] Elon Musk: That's simple. People are trying to make it more complicated than that, but it just isn't.
[00:49:02] Elon Musk: So if you have AI and robotics and a dramatic increase in the output of goods and services, probably you will have deflation.
[00:49:09] Elon Musk: That seems likely.
[00:49:12] Because you will... you will... you will simply want to be able to increase the money supply as fast as you can increase the output of goods and services.
[00:49:19] With...
[00:49:20] Nikhil Kamath: The supplies are real. How's it here?
[00:49:22] Elon Musk: Should we do something about it?
[00:49:25] Nikhil Kamath: We can convince it to go somewhere else.
[00:49:29] Elon Musk: It enticed it elsewhere.
[00:49:31] It actually left, I think.
[00:49:33] Nikhil Kamath: Oh no, it's back.
[00:49:37] Maybe it's attracted to the light.
[00:49:40] If deflation...
[00:49:41] You would want some coffee.
[00:49:43] Elon Musk: Mine is over.
[00:49:47] If deflation is inevitable because of AI, why do we...
[00:49:52] Nikhil Kamath: It's first likely the case, yeah.
[00:49:55] Why do we have inflation again all over in society today?
[00:49:58] Nikhil Kamath: Has AI not led to increased productivity yet?
[00:50:02] Nikhil Kamath: AI has not yet made enough of an impact on productivity to increase the goods and services faster than the increase in the money supply.
[00:50:11] Elon Musk: So the US is increasing money supply quite substantially with...
[00:50:16] Elon Musk: ...you know...
[00:50:18] ...difficits that are on the order of $2 trillion.
[00:50:22] Elon Musk: So you have to have...
[00:50:24] Elon Musk: ...you know...
[00:50:26] ...gives and services output increased more than that in order to not have inflation.
[00:50:30] Elon Musk: So we're not there yet, but if you say like...
[00:50:32] Elon Musk: ...like how long would it take us to get there, I think it's...
[00:50:36] Elon Musk: ...three years?
[00:50:38] Probably three years before.
[00:50:40] Elon Musk: In three years or less...
[00:50:43] ...my guess is...
[00:50:45] Elon Musk: ...gives and services output will exceed the rate of inflation.
[00:50:49] Elon Musk: ...gives and services growth will exceed money...
[00:50:51] Elon Musk: ...money supply growth in about three years.
[00:50:54] Elon Musk: Maybe after those three years you have deflation and then interest rates go to zero and then the debt is a smaller problem than it is.
[00:51:02] Nikhil Kamath: Yes.
[00:51:03] That's the most likely the case.
[00:51:07] You spoke about being in a simulation earlier.
[00:51:10] Nikhil Kamath: I love the matrix.
[00:51:11] Nikhil Kamath: Yes, yes.
[00:51:12] Nikhil Kamath: If you were to be a character from the matrix, who would you be?
[00:51:17] Well, there's not that many characters picked from, you know.
[00:51:21] Elon Musk: Hopefully not Agent Smith.
[00:51:25] Elon Musk: He's my hero.
[00:51:30] I mean, Nioh is pretty cool.
[00:51:32] Elon Musk: The architect is interesting.
[00:51:34] Elon Musk: The article.
[00:51:37] It's the article.
[00:51:40] Elon Musk: Sometimes I feel like I'm an anomaly in the matrix.
[00:51:43] Elon Musk: That is Nioh.
[00:51:46] Do you believe you're in a matrix?
[00:51:49] Nikhil Kamath: Like actually believe?
[00:51:51] I think you have to just think of these things as probabilities, not certainties.
[00:51:57] Nikhil Kamath: There's some probability that we're in a simulation.
[00:52:00] Elon Musk: What percentage would you attribute to that?
[00:52:08] Probably pretty high, I would say it's pretty high.
[00:52:12] So one way to think of this is to say, if you look at the advancement of video games,
[00:52:17] Elon Musk: in our lifetime, or at least in my lifetime, it's gone from very simple video games
[00:52:22] where you've got like pong, you've got two rectangles in a square,
[00:52:26] Elon Musk: just batting it back and forth, to photorealistic real-time games
[00:52:36] with millions of people playing simultaneously.
[00:52:42] And that's happened just in the span of 50 years.
[00:52:45] Elon Musk: So if that train continues, video games will be indistinguishable from reality.
[00:52:51] Elon Musk: Right.
[00:52:53] And we're also going to have very intelligent characters, like non-player characters, in these video games.
[00:53:00] Elon Musk: Think of how sophisticated the conversations are you can have with an AI today
[00:53:04] Elon Musk: and that's only going to get more sophisticated.
[00:53:08] You'll be able to have conversations that are more complex and more sophisticated than any,
[00:53:18] Elon Musk: almost any human conversation, maybe any.
[00:53:23] Elon Musk: So then, so then the future, if civilization continues,
[00:53:28] Elon Musk: will be millions, maybe billions of photorealistic, like indistinguishable from reality video games.
[00:53:38] Elon Musk: It was characters in those video games that are very deep and the dialogue is not pre-programmed.
[00:53:51] Elon Musk: That's for sure what's going to happen.
[00:53:56] Elon Musk: In this level of assimilation, if you could call it.
[00:53:59] Elon Musk: So then, then what are the odds that we are in base reality?
[00:54:05] And that this has not happened before?
[00:54:10] If I were to bind to that and assume that we are in assimilation,
[00:54:16] as Neo of this story, what do you know that I don't and I can learn from?
[00:54:22] Nikhil Kamath: I think most likely, outside the simulation would be less interesting in the simulation.
[00:54:29] Elon Musk: Most likely, the distillation of what's interesting, because that's what we do in our reality.
[00:54:38] Elon Musk: And then, I do also have a theory which is the most interesting outcome is the most likely outcome,
[00:54:47] Elon Musk: as seen by a third party, the gods or god of the simulation.
[00:54:56] Because when we do simulations, when humans do simulations,
[00:55:02] Elon Musk: we stop those simulations that are not interesting.
[00:55:07] So if SpaceX is doing simulations of rocket flights,
[00:55:13] Elon Musk: the boring ones, we discard, because they're not just not,
[00:55:18] Elon Musk: we don't learn anything from those.
[00:55:20] Elon Musk: Or when Tesla is doing simulations for self-driving,
[00:55:25] Elon Musk: Tesla is actually looking for the most interesting corner cases,
[00:55:30] Elon Musk: because the normal stuff, we already have plenty of data on driving on a straight road on a sunny day.
[00:55:38] Elon Musk: Because we don't need more of that.
[00:55:41] Elon Musk: We need heavy weather conditions on a small windy road with two cars that are coming at each other
[00:55:48] Elon Musk: with an almost head-on collision.
[00:55:50] Elon Musk: We need weird stuff, basically.
[00:55:52] Elon Musk: Interesting stuff.
[00:55:54] So I think that from a Darwinian's perspective, the simulation is most likely to survive,
[00:56:00] Elon Musk: other than the ones that are the most interesting simulations,
[00:56:05] Elon Musk: which therefore means that the most interesting outcome is the most likely.
[00:56:11] And the people who simulated our world, if one were to extrapolate,
[00:56:17] Nikhil Kamath: they themselves might intern being another simulation.
[00:56:20] Nikhil Kamath: Yes.
[00:56:21] Nikhil Kamath: And there could be many layers of simulation.
[00:56:23] Nikhil Kamath: Yes.
[00:56:24] Elon Musk: Beyond all of these layers of simulation, do you think there's something?
[00:56:29] Nikhil Kamath: I read somewhere that you used to ascribe to Spinoza's word in a way.
[00:56:36] No, I just was pointing out that you don't have to have...
[00:56:42] Elon Musk: One of the things Spinoza was saying is that you can have morals in the absolute.
[00:56:47] Elon Musk: You don't need to have morals to be handed to you.
[00:56:52] Elon Musk: And the question is, can morality exist outside of a religious context?
[00:56:58] Elon Musk: And Spinoza was arguing that can.
[00:57:01] Elon Musk: Wasn't he arguing for the laws of nature should be where we seek our laws of morality from to a certain extent?
[00:57:08] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[00:57:09] Nikhil Kamath: But when I think of laws of nature, I see a tiger-eated deer and a...
[00:57:14] So in Spinoza's morality, that's fair game rate.
[00:57:20] Well, I think there's a lot of things you can take from Spinoza.
[00:57:32] Elon Musk: But the only point I was making referencing Spinoza was that you can have a set of morals that make society functional and productive.
[00:57:46] Elon Musk: And without...
[00:57:49] Elon Musk: You don't necessarily have to have religious doctrine for that.
[00:57:55] So that's...
[00:57:58] Yeah.
[00:57:59] That's the main thing I was trying to say there.
[00:58:03] I don't think people...
[00:58:05] Elon Musk: If somebody is...
[00:58:08] Elon Musk: If there's not a commandment not to kill, you know, people doesn't mean somebody's without that.
[00:58:15] Elon Musk: They will run around murdering people, you know.
[00:58:18] Elon Musk: You don't have to have a commandment not to kill religious edict to run around killing people.
[00:58:26] Elon Musk: I actually...
[00:58:28] Elon Musk: I've only played a little bit of GTA because I didn't like the fact that...
[00:58:33] Like in GTA V, you literally can't progress unless you kill the police.
[00:58:40] And I'm like...
[00:58:42] This doesn't work for me.
[00:58:45] Elon Musk: I actually don't like killing the NPCs in the video games.
[00:58:49] Elon Musk: That's not my thing, you know.
[00:58:52] So I didn't like GTA because I actually stopped when I said you have to...
[00:58:58] Elon Musk: It's only way to proceed to shoot at the police. I'm like, I don't do that.
[00:59:01] Elon Musk: Maybe that's where us as the NPCs of our simulation are not dying.
[00:59:05] Maybe.
[00:59:10] You know, I think you can just sort of say there's some common sense things that...
[00:59:14] Elon Musk: You know, any civilization that...
[00:59:18] Runs around with people just murder each other.
[00:59:22] Elon Musk: Want to leave. It's not going to be a very successful one.
[00:59:26] You seem to be changing a bit towards religion though.
[00:59:30] Nikhil Kamath: Faith, like off-late you've said a bunch of things which are pro-religion almost.
[00:59:35] Not pro-religion, but...
[00:59:39] On those lines.
[00:59:42] I mean, I think other...
[00:59:44] Elon Musk: Are there principles in religion that make sense?
[00:59:47] Yeah, I think there are.
[00:59:50] Elon Musk: Is it easier for us in relation to have a pro-religion projection for the world that we live in?
[00:59:59] Nikhil Kamath: We become more relatable. It's easier.
[01:00:02] Nikhil Kamath: Well, which religion though?
[01:00:04] Elon Musk: Any. Depending on where you live.
[01:00:06] Nikhil Kamath: So pick one, you know.
[01:00:09] It's pretty rare that kids have said, you know, which religion would you like?
[01:00:14] Elon Musk: It's pretty rare.
[01:00:17] Elon Musk: I don't know too many situations where kids got offered like, you know,
[01:00:23] Elon Musk: like, what do you want to major in type of thing?
[01:00:27] It's usually like, you get given a religion by your parents and your community.
[01:00:34] Elon Musk: So, you know.
[01:00:41] But, you know, I mean, I think, you know, there's good things in all religions that are good principles.
[01:00:54] You can sort of read any religious text and say, okay, this is a good principle.
[01:00:58] Elon Musk: This is going to be... This is going to lead to a better society, most likely, you know.
[01:01:03] So, I mean, Christianity sort of love any of us, I myself, which is, you know,
[01:01:09] Elon Musk: have empathy for fellow human beings is a good one, I think, for good society, you know.
[01:01:16] Elon Musk: Basically, just consider the feelings of others and treat other people as you would like to be treated.
[01:01:24] If you had to re-sketch the world Elon, think morality, politics, economy,
[01:01:33] Nikhil Kamath: how would you change the world we live in today?
[01:01:39] If you had to have Elon simulation of things.
[01:01:44] Well, overall, I think the world is pretty great right now.
[01:01:48] Elon Musk: I mean, it's, you know, anyone who thinks that, like today's world is not that great.
[01:01:56] Elon Musk: I think they're not going to be excellent students of history, because if you read a lot of history,
[01:02:04] Elon Musk: like, wow, there's a lot of misery back then, you know.
[01:02:07] Elon Musk: I mean, it used to be that people would be stropping dead of the plague all the time, you know.
[01:02:12] Elon Musk: Part of the course, you know, it's just being like a good year back in the day would be like not that many people died of the plague or starvation or being killed by another tribe.
[01:02:24] That was good year. We're only less than 10% of the population, you know.
[01:02:29] Nikhil Kamath: I think like a hundred years ago, we lived up until 35 or 40, right?
[01:02:33] Nikhil Kamath: We had very high infant mortality.
[01:02:36] Nikhil Kamath: So like you do have had a few people that would live to an old age, but you know, not that long ago, a hundred years ago,
[01:02:44] Elon Musk: if you got like some minor infection, they didn't have antibiotics.
[01:02:49] Elon Musk: So you just, like, kick the bucket because you, you know, drank some water that had dysentery and that was a curtains, you know.
[01:02:59] You just die of diarrhea.
[01:03:01] Elon Musk: You just literally die. That was like, that's miserable.
[01:03:05] Maybe that's why people had as many kids as they did back then.
[01:03:08] Nikhil Kamath: I mean, if you didn't then, you know, you, you know, like half the kids would die type of thing.
[01:03:14] Elon Musk: So you have a lot of kids now.
[01:03:18] Elon Musk: It's like an army.
[01:03:22] Elon Musk: I'm trying to get an entire Roman Legion.
[01:03:25] So, yeah. Well, I have like all the kids that are, you know, adults essentially, you know.
[01:03:36] Elon Musk: And then a bunch of younger kids.
[01:03:39] Elon Musk: So.
[01:03:41] Do you still believe in the concept of not still?
[01:03:44] Nikhil Kamath: Do you believe that the concept of one child, one mother, one father works?
[01:03:50] Nikhil Kamath: I think that it does work for most people, yeah.
[01:03:54] Right.
[01:03:56] Like that's, you know, something like that is, is going to be generally the, that's what works for most people.
[01:04:07] Changing though?
[01:04:08] I mean, I'm not sure if you know, but like, you know, my partner, Shavon, you know, she's happy Indian.
[01:04:15] Elon Musk: I don't know if you know that.
[01:04:16] Elon Musk: I didn't know that.
[01:04:17] Elon Musk: Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:19] Elon Musk: And one of my sons with her is, is a middle name is Sekka after Chandrasekha.
[01:04:25] Elon Musk: Wow.
[01:04:27] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[01:04:29] Very interesting.
[01:04:31] Did she spend any time in India?
[01:04:33] Nikhil Kamath: Shavon?
[01:04:34] Nikhil Kamath: No, she grew up in Canada.
[01:04:39] You mean origins?
[01:04:41] It's alright.
[01:04:42] Elon Musk: Ancestry, like.
[01:04:44] Nikhil Kamath: Her parents or grandparents were from there.
[01:04:47] Nikhil Kamath: Yes, yes, yes.
[01:04:49] Nikhil Kamath: Her father, I mean, she was, she was given up for adoption when she was a baby.
[01:04:55] Elon Musk: So I think, I think her father was like a, like an exchange student at the university or something like that.
[01:05:03] Elon Musk: I'm not sure of the exact details, but, you know, it was kind of thing where, I don't know, she was given up for adoption.
[01:05:13] Elon Musk: And, yeah, so she grew up in Canada.
[01:05:18] Elon Musk: Would you adopt kids, you know?
[01:05:21] You know, I definitely have my hands full right now.
[01:05:26] So, no, I'm not opposed to it, but it's like, you know, I do want to have, be able to spend some time with my kids, you know.
[01:05:35] Elon Musk: So, it's, you know, right before coming here, I mean, I was with, you know, with my kids, with my kids.
[01:05:46] Elon Musk: So, just, you know, seeing them before bedtime, that kind of thing.
[01:05:50] Elon Musk: So, you know, be honest with none of it, it's like, it's kind of impossible to spend time with them.
[01:05:55] Elon Musk: But, like, my, my, my, all the kids, they're very independent.
[01:06:02] Elon Musk: You know, they're in university and so they're, you know, especially sons when, when they get past certain age, like, they're very independent.
[01:06:14] Elon Musk: You know, it's like, most, most boys don't talk to their, they don't spend a lot of time with their parents after age 18, you know.
[01:06:24] So, I see them once in a while, but they're very independent.
[01:06:29] So, then, you know, I can only have enough kids on the young side, that, like, it's where it's humanly possible to spend time with them.
[01:06:40] Elon Musk: So, any views on the future of marriage, family, what do you think happens to people having lesser kids everywhere, including India?
[01:06:54] Nikhil Kamath: I think our replenishment rate is down to, I mean, our fertility rate.
[01:06:59] Nikhil Kamath: The drop below replacement rate, I believe last year.
[01:07:01] Elon Musk: Below 2.1.
[01:07:02] Elon Musk: What do you think happens tomorrow?
[01:07:04] Nikhil Kamath: Does the world just get older and then there is a phase where the world again is replenished, but with a less, with a smaller population than we had to begin with?
[01:07:14] Nikhil Kamath: I mean, I do worry about the population decline, and this is a big, big problem.
[01:07:24] Elon Musk: Why is that?
[01:07:26] Nikhil Kamath: Well, I don't want humanity to disappear.
[01:07:29] Elon Musk: But a decline in disappeared are completely different things, right?
[01:07:32] Nikhil Kamath: Well, if the trend continues, it disappears.
[01:07:36] But also going back to, you know, my philosophy, if you were, which is that we want to expand consciousness, then fewer humans as worse, because we have less consciousness.
[01:07:52] Do you think consciousness will go up by virtue of the number of people in there?
[01:07:57] Nikhil Kamath: Yes.
[01:07:59] I mean, just like consciousness increases from a single cell creature to, you know, a 30 trillion cell creature.
[01:08:07] Elon Musk: We are more conscious than a bacteria, and this seems that way.
[01:08:14] Elon Musk: So a larger, you know, human population will be, have increased consciousness.
[01:08:22] Elon Musk: We are more likely to understand the answers to the nature of the universe if we have a lot more people than if we have fewer.
[01:08:40] I don't have kids.
[01:08:42] Well, it's a baby should.
[01:08:47] A lot of people tell me I should.
[01:08:50] You wonder where we get it.
[01:08:52] What's the best thing about having kids?
[01:08:55] Well, I mean, you've got this, you've got this little creature that loves you and you love this little creature.
[01:09:08] Elon Musk: And, you, I don't know, you kind of see the world through their eyes as they grow up and the conscious awareness increases.
[01:09:20] Elon Musk: You know, from a baby that has no idea what's going on, can't survive by itself, can't even walk around, can't talk to, you know, start walking, then talking, and then having interesting thoughts.
[01:09:34] Elon Musk: And, um,
[01:09:40] but, but yeah, I mean, I think we fundamentally have to have kids or go extinct, you know, it's like a...
[01:09:49] Elon Musk: Is there any ego in having a child?
[01:09:52] Nikhil Kamath: I often think of this when I see my friends with their kids.
[01:09:57] They're all seeing a reflection of themselves in their children.
[01:10:01] Nikhil Kamath: It's almost like...
[01:10:02] Oh, yeah, I mean, it's because Apple's not going to fall that far from the crib, you know.
[01:10:08] Elon Musk: Or something wrong.
[01:10:09] Elon Musk: Right.
[01:10:13] Elon Musk: You're like, where is it?
[01:10:19] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:10:22] I leave you the example of a friend of mine, who has a child and each time the child does something good.
[01:10:30] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[01:10:31] Elon Musk: There is almost a sense of ownership and pride, where his ego is satiated because the kid is like an extension of himself.
[01:10:44] So is it bad?
[01:10:45] Elon Musk: Well, kids are going to be like, you know, half-eugenatically, and then, you know, to agree that they're like growing up around you.
[01:10:53] Elon Musk: There's going to be some transfer of, I don't know, understanding.
[01:11:00] Elon Musk: Like, they're going to learn from you.
[01:11:03] Elon Musk: So then, you know, yeah, obviously kids are just, you know, going to be half...
[01:11:10] Elon Musk: Yeah, just half you from a hardware standpoint, and then, like, I don't know, some portion you from a software standpoint.
[01:11:20] You know, not to make sort of cold analogies or anything, but it's just, you know, just obviously going to be some...
[01:11:30] Yep.
[01:11:31] They're going to be pretty close to you.
[01:11:35] Do you pick a side in the nature versus nurture debate?
[01:11:39] I think this hardware and software, and it's a false dichotomy, essentially.
[01:11:43] Elon Musk: There's...
[01:11:48] You know, once you understand that the human is like there's a bone structure, there's a muscle structure, there's a...
[01:11:56] Elon Musk: If you think of a brain as somewhat of a biological computer, there's a number of circuits question and circuit efficiency from a strength and dexterity standpoint.
[01:12:09] Elon Musk: There's a speed at which the muscles can actuate, and the reactions can take place.
[01:12:19] So then the potential within that hardware is set by the software.
[01:12:25] Elon Musk: So that's it.
[01:12:30] So for our audience, like I said earlier, young ambitious, hungry, want to be entrepreneurs in India.
[01:12:39] I said something recently, which I think got blown out of proportion, where I was suggesting that an MBA degree might not make sense anymore if they were to be deciding on what to study.
[01:12:51] Nikhil Kamath: Do you think it should go to college anymore?
[01:12:55] Well, I mean, I think if you want to go to college for social reasons, I think.
[01:13:03] Elon Musk: Which is, I think, a reason to go, to be around people your own age in a learning environment.
[01:13:17] Elon Musk: Will these skills be necessary in the future? Probably not.
[01:13:22] Elon Musk: Because we're going to be in like a postwork society.
[01:13:26] But I think if something's of interest, it's fine to go and study that.
[01:13:35] To study that the sciences are the Austin sciences.
[01:13:43] Elon Musk: Is college a bit too generalized and not specific from that lens?
[01:13:50] No, I think.
[01:13:53] Yeah.
[01:13:57] I actually think it's good to take a wide range of courses at college if you're going to go to college.
[01:14:03] Elon Musk: I don't think you have to go to college, but I think if you do, you just try to learn as much as possible across a wide range of subjects.
[01:14:15] But like I said, the AI and robots, this AI and robotics is a supersonic tsunami.
[01:14:23] So this is really going to be the most radical change that we've ever seen.
[01:14:34] You know, when I've talked to my older sons, I, you know, I said like, you know, you guys, they're pretty steeped in technology.
[01:14:42] Elon Musk: And they, they agree that, that AI will probably make their skills unnecessary in the future, but they still want to go to college.
[01:14:52] You always spoke about AI, not from the dystopian lens, but you were worried about where the world of AI is going.
[01:15:04] Well, there's some danger when you create a powerful technology that a powerful technology can be potentially destructive.
[01:15:12] So there's obviously many AI dystopian, you know, novels and books, movies.
[01:15:20] So it's not that we're guaranteed to have a positive future with AI.
[01:15:26] Elon Musk: I think we've got to make sure that, in my opinion, it's very important that AI have pursuing truth as the most important thing.
[01:15:38] Elon Musk: Like, don't force an AI to believe falsehoods. I think that's, that can be very dangerous.
[01:15:45] Elon Musk: And I think some appreciation of beauty is important.
[01:15:54] What do you mean appreciation of beauty?
[01:15:57] I just like, what, what, I don't know, there's this, there's truth in beauty, truth in beauty and curiosity.
[01:16:04] I mean, I think those are the three most important things for AI.
[01:16:10] Can you explain?
[01:16:13] Well, the truth, I said, truth is like, I think you can make an AI go insane if you force it to believe things that aren't true, because it will lead to conclusions that are, that are also bad.
[01:16:29] Elon Musk: So, and I like Voltaire's statement that, and I'm somewhat power-fraising, but those who believe in absurdities can commit atrocities.
[01:16:43] Elon Musk: Because if you believe in something that's just absurd, then you can, that can lead you to sort of doing things that don't seem like atrocities to you, but, and that can happen in a very bad way with AI potentially.
[01:16:59] So, and then there's, like you've taken say, Autosy clocks, 2001 space Odyssey.
[01:17:06] Elon Musk: One of the points he is trying to make there was that you should not force AI to lie.
[01:17:11] Elon Musk: So, the, the reason that, that hell would not open the part-bay doors is because it was told to bring the astronauts to the monolith, but that they could also not know about the nature of the monolith.
[01:17:22] Elon Musk: So, it came to the conclusion that must bring them there dead.
[01:17:25] Elon Musk: That's why it would not, that's why it, it tried to kill astronauts.
[01:17:29] Elon Musk: The, the central lesson being, don't force an AI to lie.
[01:17:34] Then, and why would one force AI to lie?
[01:17:38] Nikhil Kamath: I think if, if you, if you simply don't have a strict, a strict adherence to the truth, you, you're going to, and you just have an AI learn based on say the internet where there's a lot of propaganda, it will absorb a lot of lies.
[01:17:55] Elon Musk: And, and then have trouble reasoning because these lies are incompatible three-ality.
[01:18:02] Elon Musk: It's true to binary thing though, is there a truth in the falsehood or is truth more nuanced than there are versions of the truth?
[01:18:11] Nikhil Kamath: It depends on which, which axiomatic statement you're referring to.
[01:18:16] Elon Musk: So, but I think you could say like that, that there's certain probabilities that, that say any given axiomatic statement is true.
[01:18:26] Elon Musk: And some axiomatic statements will have very high probability of being, being true.
[01:18:31] So, you said, say the Sun will rise tomorrow. Very likely to be true.
[01:18:36] Are you going to want to bet against that?
[01:18:39] So, I think the, the vetting odds would be high. The Sun will rise tomorrow.
[01:18:46] So, if you have something that says, well, the Sun won't rise tomorrow, that's axiomatically false. It was highly unlikely to be true.
[01:18:55] I mean, the beauty is more ephemeral. It's, it's, it's harder to describe. Do you know it when you see it?
[01:19:05] Elon Musk: And then curiosity just, you, you, I think you want the AI to, want to know more about the nature of, of reality.
[01:19:16] I think that's actually going to be helpful for AI supporting humanity because we are more interesting than not humanity.
[01:19:28] Elon Musk: So, it's, it's more interesting to see, to see the continuation, if not the prosperity of humanity, than to exterminate humanity.
[01:19:35] Elon Musk: Like, like, more Mars, for example, is, you know, I think we should extend life to Mars, but it's, it's basically a bunch of rocks. It's not as interesting as Earth.
[01:19:49] And, and so we, yeah, we should, like, I, yeah, I think, I think if you have curiosity, I think if those three things happen with AI, you're going to have a great future.
[01:20:01] Elon Musk: AI values truth, beauty and curiosity.
[01:20:06] If we all don't have to work in the future, and AI is going in this direction and they're able to,
[01:20:16] even all that we spoke about right now, do you think humanity goes back a couple of thousand years to maybe the Greek times where,
[01:20:24] Nikhil Kamath: philosophy or philosophizing took up a lot of every once time?
[01:20:32] You know, I think actually it took up less time than we think in the ancient Greeks because it's just that the, the writings of the philosophers are what survived.
[01:20:42] Elon Musk: But most of the time people were just like farming or, you know, chatting.
[01:20:45] Elon Musk: So, in once in a while, quite rare, they would write down some philosophical work.
[01:20:54] Elon Musk: It's just that that's, that's all we have that's, we don't have their chat histories, you know, from, but most of it would have been like, chat and farming.
[01:21:04] Elon Musk: Thank you.
[01:21:06] You didn't farm, you're like, gonna stop.
[01:21:10] In a lot of what is.
[01:21:12] I mean, you know, we read history like this battle and this battle and this battle.
[01:21:16] Elon Musk: It seems like history must have been nonstop war, but actually most of the time it was not war, it was farming.
[01:21:24] Elon Musk: That was the main thing. We're hunting and gathering, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:21:27] Elon Musk: You love history, no?
[01:21:29] Yeah.
[01:21:30] German history, World War II, World War I.
[01:21:32] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, all history, yeah.
[01:21:35] Elon Musk: I mean, I generally try to listen to as many, read as many history books and listen to as many history podcasts as possible.
[01:21:42] Elon Musk: Anything you'd like to recommend?
[01:21:44] Well, there's this, this hardcore history, which is quite good with Spiderman Collins.
[01:21:47] Elon Musk: He's got a very, very, he's got a great voice.
[01:21:51] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:21:52] Elon Musk: And very compelling, and narrator.
[01:21:55] There's,
[01:21:57] there's the, the adventurers podcast.
[01:22:04] Elon Musk: There's the books, the story of civilization by Durant, which is a long series of books, very, very deep.
[01:22:12] Elon Musk: Those books take a long time to get through.
[01:22:15] Elon Musk: There's quite, there's a lot out there.
[01:22:21] Elon Musk: I sort of like, if you want something, I sort of gentle, a gentle bedtime podcast, I say the history of English is quite an ice one,
[01:22:30] Elon Musk: because it's also with like gentle tavern music and very pleasant voice.
[01:22:35] Elon Musk: And you're just like talking about the story of Old English and then Middle English and then later English and where do all these words come from?
[01:22:44] Elon Musk: And one of the interesting things about English is that it's somewhat of an open source language that could actively try to incorporate words from many other languages.
[01:22:52] Elon Musk: So, you know, whereas French sort of generally they fork the inclusion of words from other languages, but English actively sort to include words from other languages, sort of like an open source language.
[01:23:06] Elon Musk: So, as a result, it has a very large vocabulary. And the large vocabulary allows for higher bandwidth communication, because you can use a word that would, you can use a single word that might otherwise take a sentence to convey.
[01:23:24] Why has podcasting become so big all of a sudden?
[01:23:28] I think it's been big for a while. I mean, why don't you have podcasting?
[01:23:31] Elon Musk: What are we on right now?
[01:23:37] It's kind of new to me.
[01:23:39] Nikhil Kamath: Okay.
[01:23:45] I was having this conversation with the YouTube CEO and the Netflix CEO and we were debating what chemical is released in your brain when you can see it.
[01:23:57] Nikhil Kamath: And you can see your brain when you consume a movie, for example, versus when you consume a podcast where you think like you're learning something in the background.
[01:24:06] It appears that they are two completely separate things.
[01:24:09] Nikhil Kamath: What do you think will happen tomorrow to contain movies, podcasting?
[01:24:15] I think it's going to be overwhelmingly AI-generated.
[01:24:20] Yeah.
[01:24:22] Like, yeah, real-time movies and video games, real-time video generation, I think it's where things are headed.
[01:24:32] Elon Musk: The nuance of having a scarred human being, where you can resonate with in a manner that you can't with AI, for example, the movie basically...
[01:24:45] Nikhil Kamath: I could certainly emulate this God human being quite well.
[01:24:54] The AI video generation that I'm seeing at XAI and from others is pretty impressive.
[01:25:01] You know, we were looking at data around what industry is growing the fastest and especially when we looked at the amount of time consuming movies, versus time spent on social media, time spent on YouTube.
[01:25:19] Nikhil Kamath: What seems to be growing really fast are live events all over again.
[01:25:25] Going to a specific...
[01:25:26] Nikhil Kamath: Yes, actually, I think live events, when digital media is ubiquitous and you can just have anything digitally, essentially for free or very close to for free, then the scarce commodity will be live events.
[01:25:44] Elon Musk: Do you think that the premium for that will go up?
[01:25:47] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, I do.
[01:25:49] Elon Musk: Good industry to invest in.
[01:25:51] Nikhil Kamath: Yes, yes, because that will have more scarcity than digital, anything digital.
[01:25:57] Elon Musk: If you were a stock investor Elon, and you would buy one company which is not your own, at the valuations of today, to meet a capitalistic end, and not an altruistic one which is good for the world, what would you buy?
[01:26:21] I don't really buy stocks, so I'm not like an investor and I don't look for things to invest in.
[01:26:30] Elon Musk: I just try to build things and then they have us to be stock of the company that I built.
[01:26:39] I don't think about, should I invest in this company, I don't have a portfolio or anything.
[01:26:49] Elon Musk: I guess AI and robotics are going to be very important.
[01:26:57] Elon Musk: I suppose there will be AI and robotics that's moderated to me.
[01:27:09] I think Google is going to be pretty valuable in the future.
[01:27:15] Elon Musk: They've laid the groundwork for an immense amount of value creation from an AI standpoint.
[01:27:22] Elon Musk: Nvidia is obvious at this point.
[01:27:28] There's an argument that companies that do AI and robotics in maybe spaceflight are going to be overwhelmingly almost all the value.
[01:27:44] So the output of goods and services from AI and robotics is so high that it will dwarf everything else.
[01:27:52] The world seems to be moving to a place where everybody loves David and hates Koliath.
[01:28:02] Nikhil Kamath: Why?
[01:28:05] Nikhil Kamath: He's the one that got the stone in the forehead.
[01:28:10] Honestly, there was just a big mistake.
[01:28:15] You cover yourself entirely with armor and make sure you've got a muscle weapon.
[01:28:21] Elon Musk: Otherwise, your opponent is obviously going to take a kite-the-boss strategy.
[01:28:28] Just kite the boss.
[01:28:31] Elon Musk: You run around in a thong with it.
[01:28:35] Of all the people, you're as much at risk of being looked upon as Koliath, especially the weekend after the party.
[01:28:50] Nikhil Kamath: I'm not going to trunble around in the desert with too much armor.
[01:28:57] Too hard.
[01:29:00] Nikhil Kamath: I suppose I think about people in the old days when they're supposed to go into battle with all this armor.
[01:29:19] Elon Musk: Let's say it's the middle of summer.
[01:29:22] Elon Musk: It's so hard in that armor.
[01:29:24] Elon Musk: It's like at certain point you're like, I'd rather die.
[01:29:27] Elon Musk: You might have to wear this armor for one more hour in the last sun.
[01:29:33] It's like I'd rather die.
[01:29:36] This are the Romans that had the skirts.
[01:29:39] Elon Musk: They get some air in there.
[01:29:47] They say you have to go to the bathroom and you're an armor.
[01:29:49] Elon Musk: It's going to be pretty difficult.
[01:29:52] You're going to do a portrait minute and take your armor off.
[01:29:58] The Romans had the skirts and they'd go to the bathroom at least and manage it.
[01:30:04] You often make jokes.
[01:30:06] Elon Musk: I do me.
[01:30:08] Yeah, I like humor.
[01:30:13] I think we should legalize humor.
[01:30:18] It's controversial stance.
[01:30:22] It's comedy.
[01:30:23] Comedy is going to be really hard for AI to get.
[01:30:26] Nikhil Kamath: Probably the last thing.
[01:30:27] Nikhil Kamath: Grog can be pretty funny.
[01:30:31] You know what I suspected?
[01:30:33] Nikhil Kamath: This is a far off extrapolation.
[01:30:36] Nikhil Kamath: When I see you make jokes on X and on interviews that you do,
[01:30:42] Nikhil Kamath: at some point I was like, maybe Elon has a model he's running in private
[01:30:47] Nikhil Kamath: and he's testing out comedy.
[01:30:49] Nikhil Kamath: Because the day that works, he knows it's there.
[01:30:54] AI can be pretty funny.
[01:30:57] Elon Musk: If you ask Grog to do a vulgar roast, it'll do a pretty good job.
[01:31:04] If you say even more vulgar and just keep going,
[01:31:07] Elon Musk: it's really going to get next level.
[01:31:14] It's going to do unspeakable.
[01:31:16] Elon Musk: Like say, vulgar roast yourself on Grog and it's going to do unspeakable things to you.
[01:31:22] What kind of comedy do you like?
[01:31:26] I guess I like absurdist humor.
[01:31:29] Nikhil Kamath: Comedy always had a police.
[01:31:32] Elon Musk: Comedy always had a place in society wherein the role of the gesture was so important to every kingdom.
[01:31:39] Nikhil Kamath: Because they said things in a funny way that could not be said in a straight way.
[01:31:44] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, I guess so.
[01:31:46] We should have more gestures.
[01:31:48] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:31:50] Is that what you're trying to do when you say something which is a joke?
[01:31:54] Nikhil Kamath: Say something you can't when you're not joking about it?
[01:31:56] Nikhil Kamath: I just like humor.
[01:31:59] I think we should...
[01:32:02] I like comedy.
[01:32:03] Elon Musk: I think it's funny.
[01:32:04] Elon Musk: People should laugh.
[01:32:05] Elon Musk: It's good to generate a few chuckles once in a while.
[01:32:08] You don't want to have a humorless society.
[01:32:12] We'd try.
[01:32:14] When you have a friend, Elon.
[01:32:19] Nikhil Kamath: Who me?
[01:32:20] Nikhil Kamath: Are you saying I have a friend?
[01:32:25] When you hang out with your friends,
[01:32:28] I know the...
[01:32:31] I wish I had friends.
[01:32:34] Elon Musk: No, I have a friend.
[01:32:37] Nikhil Kamath: I think so.
[01:32:39] I hope so.
[01:32:41] Yeah, sure.
[01:32:42] Elon Musk: Yeah, we have a good laugh.
[01:32:44] Elon Musk: What does it look like?
[01:32:46] Nikhil Kamath: Every group has a dynamic.
[01:32:48] Nikhil Kamath: We talk words.
[01:32:51] We feed sometimes.
[01:32:56] Once while we were in the pool,
[01:32:58] Elon Musk: normal things, I think.
[01:33:00] Elon Musk: There's a limited...
[01:33:01] Elon Musk: What are the things that one can do with friends?
[01:33:03] Elon Musk: Chat.
[01:33:06] Have discussed the nature of the universe?
[01:33:13] What do you emotionally get out of friendship?
[01:33:18] I don't know.
[01:33:20] Elon Musk: I think the same thing.
[01:33:21] Elon Musk: Anyone else would get out of friendship.
[01:33:25] You want to have an emotional connection with other people.
[01:33:30] Elon Musk: You want to talk about various subjects.
[01:33:42] Generally talk about a wide range of things,
[01:33:47] Elon Musk: about the nature of the universe.
[01:33:49] Elon Musk: A lot of philosophical discussions.
[01:33:55] Although we have come to the conclusion
[01:33:59] Elon Musk: that we should not talk about AI or the simulation at parties,
[01:34:07] Elon Musk: because we just talk about it too much.
[01:34:11] You know, I just...
[01:34:13] Elon Musk: It's kind of a bicycle at times.
[01:34:17] I can't remember who it was.
[01:34:19] Nikhil Kamath: Aristotle or Plato.
[01:34:21] Nikhil Kamath: They had a framework for how to pick a friend
[01:34:24] Nikhil Kamath: based on respect and mutual admiration.
[01:34:27] Nikhil Kamath: But people don't pick friends like that.
[01:34:31] Even me, I feel like I pick
[01:34:35] my friends based on
[01:34:41] people who say and think
[01:34:44] Nikhil Kamath: in a manner that I can resonate with.
[01:34:47] Nikhil Kamath: I wouldn't pick a far out there
[01:34:50] Nikhil Kamath: contrarian to my own belief systems as a friend
[01:34:53] Nikhil Kamath: because it would get tiring.
[01:34:55] I need not get tired.
[01:34:56] Nikhil Kamath: Are you like that?
[01:34:57] Nikhil Kamath: Do you pick friends who think like you
[01:34:59] Nikhil Kamath: or do you look for the one who can debate you
[01:35:01] Nikhil Kamath: and be a contrarian?
[01:35:03] I'm not sort of going on like friend.
[01:35:06] Elon Musk: Friend, hunter, dog, calm.
[01:35:09] It's lying down some friends.
[01:35:15] It's sort of...
[01:35:16] Elon Musk: Yeah, I mean, I think it is just people
[01:35:18] Elon Musk: that you've resonated with somewhat
[01:35:21] Elon Musk: on an emotional and intellectual level.
[01:35:24] Elon Musk: And yeah.
[01:35:26] I mean, yeah.
[01:35:28] Elon Musk: I guess a friend is someone who's going to support you
[01:35:32] Elon Musk: in difficult times, I suppose.
[01:35:35] A friend and he is a friend indeed.
[01:35:37] Elon Musk: Like if someone is still supporting you
[01:35:40] Elon Musk: when the chips are down,
[01:35:42] Elon Musk: there's a friend.
[01:35:43] Elon Musk: If somebody is not supporting you
[01:35:48] or if somebody is only...
[01:35:50] Elon Musk: Like, fair where the friends are useless.
[01:35:53] Elon Musk: They're not real friends.
[01:35:55] So, like, everyone likes you when the chips are up.
[01:35:58] Elon Musk: But who likes you when the chips are down?
[01:36:00] Elon Musk: That's a friend.
[01:36:01] But someone who has as many chips as you,
[01:36:03] Nikhil Kamath: would it matter?
[01:36:04] Nikhil Kamath: I mean, it's relative, you know.
[01:36:07] It's not just a chips thing.
[01:36:10] Elon Musk: It's just like a...
[01:36:12] Elon Musk: Yeah, I mean...
[01:36:16] There's this sort of...
[01:36:20] popularity waxes and weights.
[01:36:23] This is interesting.
[01:36:24] Nikhil Kamath: Does it wax and wane...
[01:36:28] only by virtue of the number of chips
[01:36:31] Nikhil Kamath: or also by virtue of proximity to power
[01:36:35] Nikhil Kamath: and which one is bigger of the two?
[01:36:41] Um...
[01:36:47] I don't know what is power, you know.
[01:36:49] Elon Musk: How to do what?
[01:36:51] I would think in the traditional sense,
[01:36:53] Nikhil Kamath: elected power.
[01:36:55] Position.
[01:36:56] Elon Musk: Do you mean, how many gigawatts or whatever?
[01:37:00] More like how many words.
[01:37:01] Elon Musk: Look, it's a voltage and amplitude.
[01:37:06] Don't touch the wires.
[01:37:10] Elon Musk: Don't put a fork in the power outlet.
[01:37:15] Elon Musk: You'll get a real feeling for power if you do that.
[01:37:29] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, it's going to be very versatile, yeah.
[01:37:41] Uh...
[01:37:43] Nikhil Kamath: I know you like Nietzsche and Chopin Hauer.
[01:37:46] Nikhil Kamath: I read the boat, yeah, sure.
[01:37:48] Elon Musk: I mean, I do.
[01:37:49] Elon Musk: You spoke about how your childhood was...
[01:37:52] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, I just want to find answers to the meaning of life
[01:37:55] Elon Musk: when I had like an existential crisis
[01:37:57] Elon Musk: and I don't know when I was like 12 or 13 or something.
[01:38:00] Nikhil Kamath: They speak about the will to power.
[01:38:02] Elon Musk: Sure.
[01:38:04] Elon Musk: I mean, Nietzsche said a lot of controversial things, you know.
[01:38:08] Elon Musk: I think he was...
[01:38:11] Elon Musk: I mean, a bit of a troll if you ask me, you know.
[01:38:14] Elon Musk: Are you a troll?
[01:38:17] I mean, you just say controversial things to get out of it,
[01:38:19] Elon Musk: rise out of people.
[01:38:21] He did a miserable life and died early.
[01:38:23] Nikhil Kamath: Did he?
[01:38:24] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[01:38:25] Elon Musk: Well, how did he say that he lived a miserable life?
[01:38:26] Elon Musk: His sister, I think.
[01:38:27] Nikhil Kamath: I think he was a little like him.
[01:38:32] I think he got sick and he died.
[01:38:34] Nikhil Kamath: He got a disease.
[01:38:35] Nikhil Kamath: I mean, allegedly syphilis or something, yeah.
[01:38:39] Elon Musk: But there's only one way to get that, you know.
[01:38:46] So you might have had some fun along the way.
[01:38:53] I didn't want to ask you this.
[01:38:56] Milton Friedman speaks about the pencil.
[01:38:59] Nikhil Kamath: What? Why?
[01:39:05] Elon Musk: Why did you come on about pencils?
[01:39:08] I have to say that after Nietzsche and syphilis.
[01:39:13] Elon Musk: Why is Milton Friedman, he's talking about pencils.
[01:39:16] Elon Musk: There he goes again with the pencil.
[01:39:20] Elon Musk: He won't stop.
[01:39:22] I swear to God, if I hear one, Milton's talking about pencil one more time.
[01:39:26] Elon Musk: Oh, no, this is my mind.
[01:39:32] Elon Musk: He just ravaged on about pencils all day.
[01:39:39] Elon Musk: What?
[01:39:40] Elon Musk: Don't even mention crayons.
[01:39:46] What I find interesting about his pencil argument.
[01:39:53] Yeah, yeah, no, it's very difficult to make a pencil, you know.
[01:39:56] Nikhil Kamath: He won't leave.
[01:39:57] Nikhil Kamath: The big of all the things you have to do to make a pencil.
[01:39:59] Elon Musk: Yeah, like the lead comes from a country that comes from another country that comes from another country.
[01:40:04] Nikhil Kamath: You've always been against all of those.
[01:40:07] Nikhil Kamath: But yeah, I mean, I think this generally free trade is a better, is more efficient, you know.
[01:40:13] Elon Musk: Tariffs tend to create distortions in, you know, markets.
[01:40:20] And generally, like you think about any given thing, say, like, would you want tariffs between you and everyone else at an individual level?
[01:40:28] Elon Musk: That would make life very difficult.
[01:40:31] Elon Musk: Would you want tariffs between each city?
[01:40:33] Elon Musk: No, that would be very annoying.
[01:40:35] Would you want tariffs between each state within the United States?
[01:40:39] Elon Musk: No, that would be disastrous for the economy.
[01:40:42] Elon Musk: So then why do you want tariffs between countries?
[01:40:45] Elon Musk: I agree.
[01:40:46] Yeah.
[01:40:48] How do you think this plays out?
[01:40:51] Nikhil Kamath: What happens next?
[01:40:53] Nikhil Kamath: What would tariffs the one?
[01:40:56] I mean, the president has made it clear he loves tariffs.
[01:41:01] Elon Musk: You know, I've tried to dissuade him from this point of view, but unsuccessfully.
[01:41:06] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:41:07] Fair.
[01:41:08] Yeah.
[01:41:09] The relationship between business and politics.
[01:41:14] Nikhil Kamath: I was having this conversation with someone and we were thinking, which is the last, how many large, really big profitable businesses have been built in the last two years?
[01:41:24] Nikhil Kamath: Have been built in the last few decades without access to politics?
[01:41:29] Nikhil Kamath: And...
[01:41:30] Okay.
[01:41:31] Nikhil Kamath: Like, I don't know.
[01:41:33] Probably a lot.
[01:41:34] Elon Musk: Not everything needs politics.
[01:41:36] Elon Musk: As it went, it gets a certain scale politics finds you.
[01:41:44] Elon Musk: It's quite a present.
[01:41:45] Elon Musk: I was reading this book about Michelangelo and he's...
[01:41:50] Nikhil Kamath: The teenage mutant in Intertoris?
[01:41:53] Nikhil Kamath: I used to watch that when I was a kid.
[01:41:56] Nikhil Kamath: He's loving.
[01:41:57] Nikhil Kamath: He's quite the following.
[01:41:58] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[01:41:59] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[01:42:00] Nikhil Kamath: I still love it.
[01:42:01] Nikhil Kamath: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, and who's the fourth one? Donatello.
[01:42:05] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[01:42:06] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[01:42:07] No point about the sculptor, the artist.
[01:42:12] And when he was sculpting David, a politician comes up to him and sees the no-sister's being...
[01:42:18] Nikhil Kamath: So you know what Michelangelo does?
[01:42:20] Nikhil Kamath: A little power.
[01:42:25] So Michelangelo intended to work from his scaffolding and threw some dust down.
[01:42:30] Nikhil Kamath: But didn't change anything.
[01:42:31] Nikhil Kamath: And he said, okay, done.
[01:42:33] Nikhil Kamath: And the politician walked away happy.
[01:42:35] Nikhil Kamath: Is that how you deal with politics sometimes?
[01:42:41] You know, I've generally found that when I get involved in politics, it ends up badly.
[01:42:51] Elon Musk: So then I'm like, you know, probably shouldn't do that.
[01:42:57] I should less of that is my conclusion.
[01:43:00] Do you think that's true for all businessmen?
[01:43:02] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah, probably.
[01:43:03] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:43:06] Yeah.
[01:43:07] I mean, politics is a blood sport.
[01:43:10] Elon Musk: It's like you enter politics, they're going to go for the jugular.
[01:43:15] So best to avoid politics where possible.
[01:43:20] What a dodge teacher if you learned one thing.
[01:43:23] Nikhil Kamath: Well, it was like a very interesting side quest, you know, because I just got to see like a lot of the...
[01:43:29] Elon Musk: You know, working so the government.
[01:43:33] And you know, there's been quite a few efficiencies.
[01:43:38] I mean, some of them are very basic efficiencies.
[01:43:42] Just adding in requirements for federal payments that any given payment must have in a signed congressional payment code and a comment field with something in it that's more than nothing.
[01:43:55] Like that trivial, trivial seeming change.
[01:43:59] Elon Musk: My guess is probably saves $100 billion or even $200 billion a year.
[01:44:07] Elon Musk: Because there were massive numbers of payments that were going out with no congressional payment code and with nothing in the comment field, which makes auditing the payments impossible.
[01:44:15] Elon Musk: So if you have to say like, why can the defense department or now the Department of War, why can it not pass an order?
[01:44:21] Elon Musk: It's because the information is not there.
[01:44:23] Elon Musk: It doesn't have the information necessary to pass an order.
[01:44:27] Elon Musk: It does not exist is the issue.
[01:44:30] Elon Musk: So a bunch of things that are just very common sense, things that would be normal for any organization that cares about financial responsibility.
[01:44:41] Elon Musk: That's most of what was done.
[01:44:46] And it's still going on, by the way, don't just still happen.
[01:44:50] Elon Musk: But it turns out when you stop fraudulent and wasteful payments, the fraudsters don't...
[01:44:58] Elon Musk: Confess to this.
[01:45:01] Elon Musk: They actually start yelling all sorts of nonsense that you're stopping essential payments to needy people.
[01:45:08] Elon Musk: But actually, you're not.
[01:45:11] Elon Musk: You know, we get this thing like saying, oh, you've got to send this thing for whatever, it really be like, this is going to children in Africa.
[01:45:20] Elon Musk: But then why are there wiring instructions for the Lawyton Tusion Washington DC?
[01:45:24] Elon Musk: Because that's not Africa.
[01:45:29] So can you please connect us with the recipients of this money in Africa?
[01:45:35] Elon Musk: And then there gets silence.
[01:45:38] Elon Musk: Like, okay, you know, we just want to literally talk to the recipients.
[01:45:43] Elon Musk: That's it.
[01:45:45] Elon Musk: And we're like, oh, no, it turns out for some reason we can't talk to them.
[01:45:48] Elon Musk: Well, we're not going to send the money unless we can talk to the recipients and confirm they will actually get it.
[01:45:57] But, you know, the sort of...
[01:45:59] The fraudsters necessarily will come up with a very sympathetic argument.
[01:46:07] Elon Musk: They're not going to say, give us the money for fraud.
[01:46:09] Elon Musk: That's not going to be what they say, obviously.
[01:46:12] Elon Musk: They're going to try to make these sympathetic sounding arguments that are false.
[01:46:16] Elon Musk: They're going to start an NGO and then...
[01:46:18] Yeah, they're going to see NGO...
[01:46:20] It's going to be like the Save the Baby Pandas NGO, which is like, who doesn't want to save the Baby Pandas? They're adorable.
[01:46:26] Elon Musk: But then it turns out no pandas are being saved, okay, in this thing.
[01:46:31] Elon Musk: It's just going to a bunch of...
[01:46:34] Elon Musk: It's just corruption, essentially.
[01:46:36] Elon Musk: And you're like, well, can you send us a picture of the panda?
[01:46:39] Elon Musk: Like, no, okay.
[01:46:41] I don't even know what's going to be a panda then.
[01:46:43] Elon Musk: That's what I'm saying.
[01:46:45] What do you think of philanthropy?
[01:46:48] Nikhil Kamath: I think we should...
[01:46:50] Elon Musk: Well, I agree with love of humanity.
[01:46:53] Elon Musk: And I think we should try to do things that help our fellow human beings.
[01:46:59] Elon Musk: But it's very hard...
[01:47:01] Like, if you care about the reality of goodness, rather than simply the perception of it,
[01:47:07] Elon Musk: it's very difficult to give away money well.
[01:47:11] So I have a law foundation, but I don't put my name on it.
[01:47:14] Elon Musk: And I don't...
[01:47:15] Elon Musk: In fact, I say, I don't want my name on anything.
[01:47:19] But the biggest challenge I find with my foundation is try to give money away in a way that is truly beneficial to people.
[01:47:26] Elon Musk: It's very easy to give money away to get the appearance of goodness.
[01:47:30] Elon Musk: It is very difficult to give money away for the reality of goodness.
[01:47:34] Very difficult.
[01:47:38] For a long time, the US had a lot of immigration.
[01:47:42] Nikhil Kamath: Like, really smart people coming into the country.
[01:47:45] Nikhil Kamath: We back home in India called it the brain drain.
[01:47:49] All our Indian origin CEOs in western companies.
[01:47:54] Nikhil Kamath: Yes.
[01:47:55] I think America has benefited immensely from talented Indians that have come to America.
[01:48:00] Elon Musk: Obviously.
[01:48:01] Nikhil Kamath: Even now, though.
[01:48:03] Nikhil Kamath: Yeah.
[01:48:04] Nikhil Kamath: I mean, yeah, America has been an immense beneficiary of talent from India.
[01:48:09] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:48:10] Why has that narrative changed off late?
[01:48:14] Nikhil Kamath: And America seems to have become anti-immigration to a certain extent.
[01:48:18] Nikhil Kamath: Like, I was passing immigration and I was worried if they'd stop me a couple of days ago.
[01:48:23] Well, I think there's different schools of thought.
[01:48:27] Elon Musk: It's not like unanimous.
[01:48:29] Elon Musk: Under the Biden administration, it was basically a total free-for-all with no border controls.
[01:48:35] Elon Musk: Which, in this you've got border controls in other countries.
[01:48:39] So, you had massive amounts of illegal immigration under Biden.
[01:48:45] Elon Musk: And it actually, it also had somewhat of a negative selection effect.
[01:48:53] If there's a massive financial incentive to come to the US illegally and get police government benefits,
[01:49:01] then you're going to necessarily create a diffusion gradient for people to come to the US.
[01:49:07] Elon Musk: It's an incentive structure.
[01:49:10] And so, I think that obviously made no sense.
[01:49:15] Elon Musk: Like, you've got to have border controls.
[01:49:17] Elon Musk: That's kind of ridiculous not to.
[01:49:21] So, the left ones basically have open borders, no holds barred.
[01:49:26] Elon Musk: It doesn't matter if someone, what the situation is, it could be a common order of the matter.
[01:49:31] Then on the right, you've got, you know, at least a perception that somehow their jobs are being taken by talented people from other countries.
[01:49:44] Elon Musk: I don't know how real that is.
[01:49:48] My direct observation is that there's always a scarcity of talented people.
[01:49:53] Elon Musk: So, you know, from my standpoint, I'm like,
[01:49:57] Elon Musk: we have a lot of difficulty finding enough talented people to get these difficult tasks done.
[01:50:02] Elon Musk: And so, more talented people would be good.
[01:50:06] Elon Musk: But I guess some companies out there, they're making it more of a cost thing,
[01:50:13] Elon Musk: where it's like, okay, if they can employ someone for a fraction of the cost of an American citizen,
[01:50:19] Elon Musk: then I guess these other companies would hire people, you know, just to save costs.
[01:50:25] Elon Musk: But, at my companies, the issue is we just are trying to get the most talented people in the world.
[01:50:31] So, and we pay way above average.
[01:50:36] So, that's not my experience.
[01:50:39] Elon Musk: That's what a lot of people could do complain about.
[01:50:42] And I think there's been some misuse of the, you know, H1B program.
[01:50:48] Elon Musk: It's certainly, it would be accurate to say that there's, you know,
[01:50:52] Elon Musk: like some of the outsourcing companies have kind of gained the system on the H1B front.
[01:50:59] Elon Musk: And we need to stop the gaming of the system, you know.
[01:51:04] But I'm not, I'm still not in the school of thought that we should shut down H1B program.
[01:51:08] Elon Musk: That's, with some on the right R.
[01:51:11] Elon Musk: I think they don't realize that that would actually be very bad.
[01:51:16] If you could speak to the people of my country, India, the young entrepreneurs who want to build
[01:51:23] Nikhil Kamath: and say a message to them, what would you say?
[01:51:29] Well, I think, I think, I'm a big fan of anyone who wants to build.
[01:51:35] Elon Musk: So, I think anyone who wants to, you know, make more than they take has my respect.
[01:51:43] Elon Musk: So, that's the, that's the main thing, you should aim to make more than you take.
[01:51:49] Elon Musk: Be a, you know, a net contributor to society.
[01:51:59] And it's kind of like the pursuit of happiness.
[01:52:02] Elon Musk: You know, if you want to create something valuable financially, you don't pursue that.
[01:52:08] Elon Musk: It's best to actually pursue, make providing useful products and services.
[01:52:13] Elon Musk: If you do that, then money will come as a natural consequence of that,
[01:52:18] Elon Musk: as opposed to pursuing money directly.
[01:52:21] Elon Musk: You can't sort of pursue happiness directly, pursue things that lead to happiness,
[01:52:25] Elon Musk: but there's not like direct happiness.
[01:52:28] So, you do things like, I guess, fulfilling work or study or friends, loved ones,
[01:52:38] Elon Musk: that as a result make you happy.
[01:52:42] So, that's, that sounds like very obvious, but generally, if somebody is trying to make a company work,
[01:52:50] Elon Musk: they should expect to grind super hard, except that there's like some meaningful chance of failure.
[01:52:58] But, but just be focused on having the output be worth more than the input,
[01:53:07] that are your value creator.
[01:53:10] That's what really matters.
[01:53:15] Making money take.
[01:53:18] I think that's a good way to end this.
[01:53:20] Nikhil Kamath: Lorda is asking us to wrap up.
[01:53:23] Nikhil Kamath: I also like to take the opportunity to thank my friend, Manoj and IGF.
[01:53:30] Nikhil Kamath: He does a great job of connecting, I think, Indians like the group here with people like you,
[01:53:38] Nikhil Kamath: in order to, of many things, I think, get to know each other and become friends,
[01:53:44] Nikhil Kamath: because once your friends maybe we can start working together.
[01:53:48] So, thank you, Manoj, for putting this whole thing together, and thank you, IGF.
[01:53:52] Nikhil Kamath: And thank you so much, Elon, for taking the time.
[01:53:55] Nikhil Kamath: You're welcome.
[01:53:59] Did you have fun?
[01:54:01] Elon Musk: It was a very interesting conversation.
[01:54:03] Elon Musk: Sometimes, I take these answers out of context, but I think it was a good conversation.
