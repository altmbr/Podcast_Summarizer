[00:00:00] The Joe Rogan experience dream by nature.
[00:00:07] Joe Rogan: Rogan podcast by night all day.
[00:00:09] Joe Rogan: All right.
[00:00:11] Nice job.
[00:00:13] Joe Rogan: Good to see you again.
[00:00:15] Joe Rogan: We were just talking about was that the first time we ever spoke or did was the first
[00:00:18] Joe Rogan: time we spoke at space.
[00:00:20] Joe Rogan: Space ex space exer first time when you were giving Elon that crazy a i chip.
[00:00:24] Joe Rogan: All right.
[00:00:25] Joe Rogan: Did you export.
[00:00:26] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[00:00:27] Joe Rogan: Ooh.
[00:00:28] Joe Rogan: That was a big moment.
[00:00:29] Joe Rogan: was like watching these wizards of tech,
[00:00:32] Joe Rogan: like exchange information and you're giving him
[00:00:36] Joe Rogan: this crazy device, you know?
[00:00:38] Joe Rogan: And then the other time was,
[00:00:40] Joe Rogan: I was shooting arrows in my backyard
[00:00:42] Joe Rogan: and randomly get this call from Trump
[00:00:45] Joe Rogan: and he's hanging out with you.
[00:00:46] Joe Rogan: President Trump called and I called you.
[00:00:47] Joe Rogan: Yeah, we were talking about you.
[00:00:49] Joe Rogan: He's just talking about you.
[00:00:52] Jensen Huang: He was talking about the UFC thing
[00:00:54] Jensen Huang: he was gonna do in his front yard.
[00:00:55] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[00:00:56] Joe Rogan: And he pulls out, he's,
[00:00:57] Jensen Huang: Johnson, look at this design.
[00:00:59] He's so proud of it.
[00:01:01] And I go, you're gonna have a fight
[00:01:04] in the front lawn in the White House?
[00:01:05] Jensen Huang: He goes, yeah, yeah, you're gonna come.
[00:01:07] Jensen Huang: This is gonna be awesome.
[00:01:08] Jensen Huang: And he's showing his design and how beautiful it is.
[00:01:11] Jensen Huang: And he goes, and somehow your name comes up.
[00:01:15] Jensen Huang: He goes, do you know Joe?
[00:01:17] Jensen Huang: And I said, yeah, I'm gonna be on his podcast.
[00:01:20] He's, let's call him.
[00:01:21] Jensen Huang: He's like a kid.
[00:01:24] Jensen Huang: I know, let's call him.
[00:01:25] Jensen Huang: It's so, he like,
[00:01:27] Joe Rogan: Blind your old kid.
[00:01:28] Joe Rogan: He's somewhere in trouble.
[00:01:30] Yeah, he's an odd guy.
[00:01:32] Just very different.
[00:01:34] Joe Rogan: You know, like what you'd expect from him,
[00:01:37] Joe Rogan: very different than what people think of him.
[00:01:39] Joe Rogan: And also just very different as a president.
[00:01:41] Joe Rogan: A guy who just calls your text you out of the blue.
[00:01:44] Joe Rogan: Also, when you text you,
[00:01:45] Joe Rogan: you have an android, so it won't go through with you.
[00:01:47] Joe Rogan: But my iPhone, he makes the text go big.
[00:01:49] Joe Rogan: You know what I write?
[00:01:51] Joe Rogan: The USA is respected again.
[00:01:54] All caps and it makes the text in large.
[00:01:59] Joe Rogan: It's kind of ridiculous.
[00:02:00] Joe Rogan: Well, the one on one Trump,
[00:02:03] Jensen Huang: President Trump is very different.
[00:02:05] Jensen Huang: He surprised me.
[00:02:07] Jensen Huang: First of all, he's an incredibly good listener.
[00:02:10] Jensen Huang: Almost everything I've ever said to him,
[00:02:12] Jensen Huang: he's remembered.
[00:02:13] Yeah, people don't,
[00:02:15] Joe Rogan: they only want to look at negative stories about him
[00:02:18] Joe Rogan: or negative narratives about him.
[00:02:20] Joe Rogan: You know, you can catch anybody on a bad day.
[00:02:22] Joe Rogan: Like, there's a lot of things he does where I don't think
[00:02:24] Joe Rogan: he should do.
[00:02:25] Joe Rogan: I don't think he should say to a reporter,
[00:02:27] Joe Rogan: quiet piggy.
[00:02:28] Joe Rogan: Like, that's pretty ridiculous.
[00:02:30] Joe Rogan: Also, objectively funny.
[00:02:33] Joe Rogan: I mean, it's unfortunate that it happened to her.
[00:02:34] Joe Rogan: I wouldn't want that to happen to her,
[00:02:36] Joe Rogan: but it was funny.
[00:02:38] Joe Rogan: Just ridiculous that the president does that.
[00:02:39] Joe Rogan: I wish he didn't do that.
[00:02:41] Joe Rogan: But other than that, like, he's an interesting guy.
[00:02:43] Joe Rogan: Like, he's a lot of different things wrapped up into one person,
[00:02:47] Joe Rogan: you know?
[00:02:49] You know, part of his charm,
[00:02:51] Jensen Huang: well, part of his genius is he says what's on his mind.
[00:02:54] Yes.
[00:02:55] Joe Rogan: And that's just like an anti-politician.
[00:02:57] Joe Rogan: Yeah, right.
[00:02:58] Joe Rogan: So you know what's on his mind?
[00:03:00] Jensen Huang: Is really what's on his mind.
[00:03:02] Jensen Huang: Which I tell you what he prefers.
[00:03:04] Jensen Huang: I do, I do that too.
[00:03:05] Jensen Huang: I do that too.
[00:03:06] Jensen Huang: Some people would rather be lied to.
[00:03:07] Joe Rogan: Yeah, but I like the fact that he's telling you what's on his mind.
[00:03:11] Jensen Huang: Almost every time he explains something,
[00:03:13] Jensen Huang: he says something,
[00:03:15] Jensen Huang: he starts with his,
[00:03:17] Jensen Huang: you could tell his love for America,
[00:03:19] Jensen Huang: what he wants to do for America.
[00:03:21] Jensen Huang: And everything that he thinks through is very practical
[00:03:26] Jensen Huang: and very common sense.
[00:03:27] Jensen Huang: And, you know, it's very logical.
[00:03:30] Jensen Huang: And I still remember the first time I met him.
[00:03:35] Jensen Huang: And so this was, I never met him before.
[00:03:38] Jensen Huang: And Secretary Lutton had called.
[00:03:42] Jensen Huang: And we met right before,
[00:03:44] Jensen Huang: right at the beginning of the administration,
[00:03:45] Jensen Huang: and he said, he told me what wasn't important to present Trump.
[00:03:49] Jensen Huang: That United States manufacturers on shore.
[00:03:56] Jensen Huang: And that was really important to him because,
[00:03:58] Jensen Huang: because it's important to national security,
[00:04:00] Jensen Huang: he wants to make sure that the important critical technology
[00:04:03] Jensen Huang: of our nation is built in the United States.
[00:04:06] Jensen Huang: And that we re-industrialize and get good at manufacturing again
[00:04:10] Jensen Huang: because it's important for jobs.
[00:04:11] Jensen Huang: It just seems like common sense, right?
[00:04:13] Jensen Huang: Incredible common sense.
[00:04:14] Jensen Huang: And almost like literally the first conversation
[00:04:16] Jensen Huang: I had with Secretary Luttonick.
[00:04:18] Jensen Huang: And he was talking about how he started our conversation
[00:04:27] Jensen Huang: with Jensen, this is Secretary Luttonick.
[00:04:31] Jensen Huang: And I just want to let you know that you're a national treasure.
[00:04:36] Jensen Huang: And Vity is a national treasure.
[00:04:38] Jensen Huang: And whenever you need access to the president,
[00:04:43] Jensen Huang: the administration, you call us,
[00:04:46] Jensen Huang: we're always gonna be available to you.
[00:04:48] Jensen Huang: Literally that was the first sentence.
[00:04:50] That's pretty nice.
[00:04:51] Jensen Huang: And it was completely true.
[00:04:53] Jensen Huang: Every single time I called, if I needed something,
[00:04:57] Jensen Huang: I wanna get something off my chest, express some concern,
[00:05:01] Jensen Huang: they're always available.
[00:05:02] Jensen Huang: Incredible.
[00:05:03] Joe Rogan: It's just unfortunate we live in such a politically polarized
[00:05:05] Joe Rogan: society that you can't recognize good common sense things
[00:05:09] Joe Rogan: if they're coming from a person that you object to.
[00:05:12] Joe Rogan: And that I think is what's going on here.
[00:05:14] Joe Rogan: I think most people generally, as a country,
[00:05:17] Joe Rogan: as a giant community, which we are,
[00:05:20] Joe Rogan: it just only makes sense that we have manufacturing in America
[00:05:25] Joe Rogan: that especially critical technology,
[00:05:27] Joe Rogan: like you're talking about,
[00:05:28] Joe Rogan: like it's kind of insane that we buy so much technology
[00:05:31] Joe Rogan: from other countries.
[00:05:33] If the United States doesn't grow,
[00:05:36] Jensen Huang: we will have no prosperity.
[00:05:39] Jensen Huang: We can invest in anything domestically or otherwise.
[00:05:42] Jensen Huang: We can't fix any of our problems.
[00:05:45] Jensen Huang: If we don't have energy growth,
[00:05:47] Jensen Huang: we can't have industrial growth.
[00:05:49] Jensen Huang: If we don't have industrial growth,
[00:05:51] Jensen Huang: we can't have job growth.
[00:05:52] Jensen Huang: These are as simple as that.
[00:05:54] Jensen Huang: Right.
[00:05:55] Jensen Huang: And the fact that he came into office,
[00:05:58] Jensen Huang: and the first thing that he said was,
[00:05:59] Jensen Huang: drill baby drill, his point is we need energy growth.
[00:06:02] Jensen Huang: Without energy growth, we can have no industrial growth.
[00:06:06] Jensen Huang: And that was, it saved, it saved the AI industry.
[00:06:09] Jensen Huang: God, I gotta tell you flat out,
[00:06:11] Jensen Huang: if not for his pro-growth energy policy,
[00:06:16] Jensen Huang: we would not be able to build factories for AI,
[00:06:19] Jensen Huang: we would not be able to build chip factories.
[00:06:21] Jensen Huang: We won't surely, we won't be able to build
[00:06:23] Jensen Huang: super computer factories.
[00:06:24] Jensen Huang: None of that stuff would be possible.
[00:06:26] Jensen Huang: And without all of that, construction jobs will be challenged,
[00:06:30] Jensen Huang: right, electrical, you know, electrician jobs.
[00:06:33] Jensen Huang: All of these jobs that are now flourishing would be challenged.
[00:06:36] Jensen Huang: And so I think he's got a right.
[00:06:37] Jensen Huang: We need energy growth.
[00:06:39] Jensen Huang: We want to re-industrialize the United States.
[00:06:41] Jensen Huang: We need to be back in manufacturing.
[00:06:43] Jensen Huang: Every successful person doesn't need to have a PhD.
[00:06:46] Jensen Huang: Every successful person doesn't have to have
[00:06:48] Jensen Huang: gone to Stanford or MIT.
[00:06:50] Jensen Huang: And I think that that, you know, that sensibility is spot on.
[00:06:56] Now, when we're talking about technology growth
[00:06:59] Joe Rogan: and energy growth, there's a lot of people that go,
[00:07:01] Joe Rogan: oh no, that's not what we need.
[00:07:02] Joe Rogan: We need to, you know, simplify our lives and get back.
[00:07:05] Joe Rogan: But the real issue is that we're in the middle
[00:07:07] Joe Rogan: of a giant technology race.
[00:07:09] Joe Rogan: And whether people are aware of it or not,
[00:07:11] Joe Rogan: whether they like it or not, it's happening.
[00:07:13] Joe Rogan: And it's a really important race.
[00:07:15] Joe Rogan: Because whoever gets to whatever the event horizon
[00:07:21] Joe Rogan: of artificial intelligences, whoever gets their first
[00:07:24] Joe Rogan: has massive advantages in a huge way.
[00:07:28] You agree with that?
[00:07:29] Joe Rogan: Well, first, the part, I will say that we are in a technology
[00:07:33] Jensen Huang: race and we are always in a technology race.
[00:07:36] Jensen Huang: We've been in a technology race with somebody forever.
[00:07:39] Jensen Huang: Right, right, since the Industrial Revolution,
[00:07:41] Jensen Huang: we've been in a technology race.
[00:07:42] Jensen Huang: Since the Manhattan Project.
[00:07:42] Jensen Huang: Yeah, or, you know, even going back to the discovery
[00:07:46] Jensen Huang: of energy, right?
[00:07:47] Jensen Huang: The United Kingdom was where the Industrial Revolution
[00:07:52] Jensen Huang: was, if you will, invented when they realized
[00:07:54] Jensen Huang: that they can turn steam and such into energy
[00:07:57] Jensen Huang: and to electricity.
[00:08:00] All of that was invented largely in Europe.
[00:08:05] And United States capitalized on it.
[00:08:08] We were the ones that learned from it.
[00:08:10] Jensen Huang: We industrialized it.
[00:08:12] Jensen Huang: We defused it faster than anybody in Europe.
[00:08:15] Jensen Huang: They were all stuck in discussions about policy
[00:08:21] Jensen Huang: and jobs and disruptions.
[00:08:24] Jensen Huang: Meanwhile, the United States was forming.
[00:08:26] Jensen Huang: We just took the technology and ran with it.
[00:08:28] Jensen Huang: And so I think we were always in a bit of a technology race.
[00:08:32] Jensen Huang: What were two was a technology race.
[00:08:34] Jensen Huang: Manhattan Project was a technology race.
[00:08:36] Jensen Huang: We've been in a technology race ever since.
[00:08:38] Jensen Huang: We've been in a COVID war.
[00:08:39] Jensen Huang: I think we're still in a technology race.
[00:08:41] Jensen Huang: It is probably the single most important race.
[00:08:44] Jensen Huang: It is the technology as it gives you superpowers,
[00:08:50] Jensen Huang: you know, whether it's information superpowers
[00:08:52] Jensen Huang: or energy superpowers or military superpowers
[00:08:56] Jensen Huang: is all founded in technology.
[00:08:57] Jensen Huang: And so technology leadership is really important.
[00:09:00] Jensen Huang: Well, the problem is if somebody else has superior technology,
[00:09:03] Joe Rogan: right?
[00:09:04] Joe Rogan: Yeah, that's the issue.
[00:09:05] Joe Rogan: It seems like with the AI race,
[00:09:07] Joe Rogan: people are very nervous about it.
[00:09:09] Joe Rogan: Like, you know, Elon has famously said
[00:09:12] Joe Rogan: that it's like 80% chance, it's awesome.
[00:09:15] Joe Rogan: 20% chance, we're in trouble.
[00:09:17] Joe Rogan: And people are worried about that 20%.
[00:09:20] Joe Rogan: Rightly so.
[00:09:21] Joe Rogan: You know, if you had 10 bullets in a revolver
[00:09:26] Joe Rogan: and you know, you took out eight of them,
[00:09:30] Joe Rogan: and you still have two in there and you spin it,
[00:09:32] Joe Rogan: you're not gonna feel real comfortable
[00:09:33] Joe Rogan: when you pull that trigger.
[00:09:34] Joe Rogan: It's terrifying.
[00:09:34] Joe Rogan: Right.
[00:09:35] Jensen Huang: And when we're working towards this ultimate goal of AI,
[00:09:42] it's just impossible to imagine
[00:09:46] Joe Rogan: that it wouldn't be of national security interest
[00:09:48] Joe Rogan: to get there first.
[00:09:49] Joe Rogan: We should, the question is what's there?
[00:09:51] Jensen Huang: That's the part that is there.
[00:09:53] Jensen Huang: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:09:54] Jensen Huang: And that's the problem.
[00:09:55] Jensen Huang: I don't think anybody is really knows.
[00:09:57] Jensen Huang: That's crazy though.
[00:09:58] Joe Rogan: Would I ask you, you're the head of Nvidia.
[00:10:01] Joe Rogan: You don't know what's there?
[00:10:03] Jensen Huang: Who knows?
[00:10:04] Jensen Huang: Yeah, I think it's probably gonna be
[00:10:06] Jensen Huang: much more gradual than we think.
[00:10:09] Jensen Huang: It won't be a moment.
[00:10:11] Jensen Huang: It won't be as if somebody arrived and nobody else has.
[00:10:17] Jensen Huang: I don't think it's gonna be like that.
[00:10:18] Jensen Huang: I think it's gonna be things that just get better
[00:10:20] Jensen Huang: and better and better, just like technology does.
[00:10:23] Jensen Huang: So you are rosy about the future.
[00:10:25] Joe Rogan: You're very optimistic about what's gonna happen with AI.
[00:10:29] Joe Rogan: Obviously, will you make the best AI chips in the world?
[00:10:32] Joe Rogan: It'll probably better be.
[00:10:34] Jensen Huang: If history is a guide, we were always concerned
[00:10:38] Jensen Huang: about new technology.
[00:10:41] Humanity has always been concerned about new technology.
[00:10:43] Jensen Huang: They're always somebody who's thinking,
[00:10:45] Jensen Huang: they're always a lot of people who are quite concerned.
[00:10:47] Jensen Huang: We're quite concerned.
[00:10:50] Jensen Huang: And so if history is a guide, it is the case
[00:10:56] Jensen Huang: that all of this concern is channeled
[00:10:59] Jensen Huang: into making the technology safer.
[00:11:02] Jensen Huang: And so for example, in the last several years,
[00:11:06] Jensen Huang: I would say AI technology has increased
[00:11:09] Jensen Huang: probably in the last two years alone, maybe a hundred X.
[00:11:14] Jensen Huang: Let's just give it a number.
[00:11:16] Okay, it's like a car two years ago was a hundred times slower.
[00:11:21] So AI is a hundred times more capable today.
[00:11:25] Jensen Huang: Now how did we channel that technology?
[00:11:27] Jensen Huang: How do we channel all of that power?
[00:11:29] Jensen Huang: We directed it to causing the AI to be able to think,
[00:11:35] Jensen Huang: meaning that it can take a problem
[00:11:37] Jensen Huang: that we give it, break it down step by step.
[00:11:41] It does research before it answers.
[00:11:44] Jensen Huang: And so it grounds it on truth.
[00:11:47] Jensen Huang: It'll reflect on that answer, ask itself,
[00:11:50] Jensen Huang: is this the best answer that I can give you?
[00:11:54] Jensen Huang: Am I certain about this answer?
[00:11:55] Jensen Huang: If it's not certain about the answer
[00:11:57] Jensen Huang: or highly confident about the answer,
[00:11:59] Jensen Huang: you'll go back and do more research.
[00:12:01] It might actually even use a tool
[00:12:03] Jensen Huang: because that tool provides a better solution
[00:12:04] Jensen Huang: than it could hallucinate itself.
[00:12:07] Jensen Huang: As a result, we took all of that computing capability
[00:12:11] Jensen Huang: and we channeled it into having it produce a safer result,
[00:12:15] Jensen Huang: safer answer, a more truthful answer.
[00:12:18] Jensen Huang: Because as you know,
[00:12:19] Jensen Huang: one of the greatest criticisms of AI in the beginning
[00:12:21] Jensen Huang: was that hallucinated.
[00:12:22] Jensen Huang: Right.
[00:12:23] Joe Rogan: And so if you look at the reason why people use AI so much today,
[00:12:27] it's because the amount of hallucination has reduced.
[00:12:30] I use it almost,
[00:12:31] Jensen Huang: well, I use the whole trip over here.
[00:12:34] Jensen Huang: And so I think the capability,
[00:12:39] Jensen Huang: most people think about power
[00:12:42] and they think about,
[00:12:44] maybe it's an explosion power,
[00:12:46] Jensen Huang: but the technology power,
[00:12:48] Jensen Huang: most of it is channeled towards safety.
[00:12:50] Jensen Huang: A car today is more powerful,
[00:12:52] Jensen Huang: but it's safer to drive.
[00:12:54] A lot of that power goes towards better handling.
[00:12:57] Jensen Huang: You know, I'd rather have a, well,
[00:13:01] Jensen Huang: you have a thousand horsepower truck.
[00:13:03] Jensen Huang: I think 500 horsepower is pretty good.
[00:13:05] Jensen Huang: Now, I thousand better.
[00:13:06] Jensen Huang: I think a thousand is better.
[00:13:07] Jensen Huang: I don't know about the better,
[00:13:08] Joe Rogan: but it's definitely faster.
[00:13:10] Joe Rogan: Yeah. No, I think it's better.
[00:13:11] Jensen Huang: And you get out of trouble faster.
[00:13:17] I enjoyed my 5.99 more than my 6.12.
[00:13:21] It was, I think it was a better, better,
[00:13:22] Jensen Huang: and more horsepower is better.
[00:13:24] My 459 is better than my 430.
[00:13:27] More horsepower is better.
[00:13:28] Jensen Huang: I think more horsepower is better.
[00:13:30] Jensen Huang: I think it's better handling, it's better control.
[00:13:32] Jensen Huang: In the case of technology,
[00:13:34] Jensen Huang: it's also very similar in that way.
[00:13:36] Jensen Huang: You know, and so if you look at what we're gonna do
[00:13:38] Jensen Huang: with the next thousand times of performance in AI,
[00:13:42] Jensen Huang: a lot of it is going to be channeled towards
[00:13:45] Jensen Huang: more reflection, more research,
[00:13:49] thinking about the answer more deeply.
[00:13:51] Jensen Huang: So when you're defining safety,
[00:13:53] Joe Rogan: you're defining it as accuracy.
[00:13:55] Joe Rogan: Functionality.
[00:13:56] Jensen Huang: Functionality.
[00:13:57] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[00:13:58] Jensen Huang: It does what you expect it to do.
[00:14:01] Jensen Huang: And then you take the technology and horsepower,
[00:14:04] Jensen Huang: you put guard rails on it, just like our cars.
[00:14:07] Jensen Huang: We've got a lot of technology in a car today.
[00:14:10] Jensen Huang: A lot of it goes towards, for example, ABS.
[00:14:13] Jensen Huang: ABS is great.
[00:14:15] And so traction control.
[00:14:17] Jensen Huang: That's fantastic.
[00:14:18] Jensen Huang: Without a computer in the car,
[00:14:20] Jensen Huang: how would you do any of that?
[00:14:22] Jensen Huang: And that little computer,
[00:14:23] Jensen Huang: the computers that you have doing your traction control,
[00:14:26] Jensen Huang: is more powerful than a computer that went to Apollo 11.
[00:14:29] And so you want that technology,
[00:14:32] channeled towards safety, channeled towards functionality.
[00:14:35] Jensen Huang: And so when people talk about power,
[00:14:37] Jensen Huang: the advancement of technology, oftentimes,
[00:14:40] Jensen Huang: I feel what they're thinking
[00:14:43] and what we're actually doing is very different.
[00:14:45] Jensen Huang: What do you think they're thinking?
[00:14:47] Well, they're thinking somehow that this AI is being powerful.
[00:14:53] Jensen Huang: And their mind probably goes towards a sci-fi movie,
[00:14:57] Jensen Huang: the definition of power.
[00:15:00] Jensen Huang: Oftentimes, the definition of power is military power
[00:15:04] Jensen Huang: or physical power.
[00:15:06] Jensen Huang: But in the case of technology power,
[00:15:09] Jensen Huang: when we translate all of those operations,
[00:15:11] Jensen Huang: it's towards more refined thinking, more reflection,
[00:15:15] Jensen Huang: more planning, more options.
[00:15:18] Jensen Huang: I think the big fears that people have
[00:15:19] Joe Rogan: is one, a big fear is military applications.
[00:15:23] Joe Rogan: That's a big fear.
[00:15:24] Joe Rogan: Because people are very concerned
[00:15:25] Joe Rogan: that you're going to have AI systems that make decisions
[00:15:29] Joe Rogan: that maybe an ethical person wouldn't make
[00:15:31] Joe Rogan: or a moral person wouldn't make
[00:15:32] Joe Rogan: based on achieving an objective versus based on,
[00:15:36] Joe Rogan: you know, how it's going to look to people.
[00:15:41] Well, I'm happy that our military is going to use
[00:15:46] Jensen Huang: AI technology for defense.
[00:15:48] Jensen Huang: And I think that that
[00:15:51] Jensen Huang: andro building military technology,
[00:15:53] Jensen Huang: I'm happy to hear that.
[00:15:54] Jensen Huang: I'm happy to see all these tech startups now
[00:15:57] Jensen Huang: channeling their technology capabilities
[00:15:59] Jensen Huang: towards defense and military applications.
[00:16:02] Jensen Huang: I think you need to do that.
[00:16:03] Jensen Huang: Yeah, we had Palmer lucky on the podcast
[00:16:05] Joe Rogan: and he was demonstrating some of this stuff
[00:16:06] Joe Rogan: from the press. Yeah, incredible.
[00:16:07] Joe Rogan: Helmet on.
[00:16:08] Joe Rogan: And we showed some videos
[00:16:09] Joe Rogan: how you could see behind walls and stuff.
[00:16:11] Joe Rogan: Like it's nuts.
[00:16:12] Joe Rogan: He's actually the perfect guy
[00:16:13] Joe Rogan: to go start that company.
[00:16:14] Joe Rogan: 100%. Yeah, 100%.
[00:16:17] Joe Rogan: It's like he's born for that.
[00:16:19] Yeah, he came here with a copper jacket on.
[00:16:21] Joe Rogan: He's a freak.
[00:16:22] Joe Rogan: It's awesome.
[00:16:23] Joe Rogan: He's awesome.
[00:16:24] Joe Rogan: But it's also it's a, you know,
[00:16:26] Joe Rogan: an unusual intellect channeled into that
[00:16:29] Joe Rogan: very bizarre field is what you need.
[00:16:31] Joe Rogan: You know, and I think it's, it's a,
[00:16:34] Jensen Huang: I think I'm happy that we're making a
[00:16:35] Jensen Huang: more socially acceptable.
[00:16:38] You know, there was a time where
[00:16:40] Jensen Huang: when somebody wanted to channel their technology
[00:16:42] Jensen Huang: capability and their intellect into
[00:16:45] Jensen Huang: defense technology, somehow they're vilified.
[00:16:48] Jensen Huang: But we need people like that.
[00:16:51] Jensen Huang: We need people who enjoyed, enjoyed that
[00:16:53] Jensen Huang: part of application of technology.
[00:16:55] Jensen Huang: Well, people are terrified of war.
[00:16:57] Joe Rogan: Yeah, so it makes sense.
[00:16:59] Joe Rogan: The best way to avoid it has excessive military might.
[00:17:03] Do you think that's absolutely the best way?
[00:17:05] Joe Rogan: Not diplomacy, not working stuff out.
[00:17:08] Joe Rogan: All of it. All of it.
[00:17:09] Joe Rogan: Yeah, you have to have military might
[00:17:11] Joe Rogan: and you have to get people to sit down there.
[00:17:12] Joe Rogan: Right. Exactly.
[00:17:13] Joe Rogan: All of it.
[00:17:14] Joe Rogan: Otherwise, it just invade.
[00:17:15] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[00:17:16] Joe Rogan: Why ask for permission?
[00:17:17] Again, like you said, in history,
[00:17:19] Joe Rogan: go back and look at history.
[00:17:20] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[00:17:21] Joe Rogan: When you look at the future of AI and you just said
[00:17:25] Joe Rogan: that no one really knows what's happening.
[00:17:27] Joe Rogan: Right.
[00:17:28] Joe Rogan: Do you ever sit down and ponder scenarios?
[00:17:31] Joe Rogan: Like, what do you, what do you think is like
[00:17:33] Joe Rogan: best case scenario for AI over the next two decades?
[00:17:38] Joe Rogan: The best case scenario is that AI diffuses into everything
[00:17:48] Jensen Huang: that we do and our everything is more efficient.
[00:17:56] Jensen Huang: But the threat of war remains a threat of war.
[00:18:01] Jensen Huang: Cyber security remains a super-different way.
[00:18:06] A super-difficult challenge.
[00:18:09] Jensen Huang: Somebody is going to try to breach your security.
[00:18:14] Jensen Huang: You're going to have thousands of millions of AI agents
[00:18:18] Jensen Huang: protecting you from that threat.
[00:18:22] Jensen Huang: Your technology is going to get better.
[00:18:24] Jensen Huang: Their technology is going to get better just like cyber security.
[00:18:27] Jensen Huang: Right now, while we speak, we're being.
[00:18:31] We're seeing cyber attacks all over the planet
[00:18:34] Jensen Huang: on just about every front door you can imagine.
[00:18:37] Jensen Huang: And yet, you and I are sitting here talking.
[00:18:43] Jensen Huang: And so, the reason for that is because we know that there's
[00:18:47] Jensen Huang: a whole bunch of cyber security technology in defense.
[00:18:50] Jensen Huang: And so, we just have to keep amping that up,
[00:18:52] Jensen Huang: keep stepping that up.
[00:18:54] Jensen Huang: This episode is brought to you by Visible.
[00:18:56] Joe Rogan: When your phone plans as good as Visible,

[00:19:38] Joe Rogan: Terms apply, limited time offers subject to change,
[00:19:41] Joe Rogan: see visible.com for plan features and network management details.
[00:19:46] Joe Rogan: That's a big issue with people.
[00:19:48] Joe Rogan: The worry that technology is going to get to a point
[00:19:51] Joe Rogan: where encryption is going to be obsolete.
[00:19:53] Joe Rogan: Encryption is just, it's no longer going to protect data.
[00:19:56] Joe Rogan: It's no longer going to protect systems.
[00:19:58] Joe Rogan: Do you anticipate that ever being an issue?
[00:20:00] Joe Rogan: Or do you think it's as the defense grows, the threat grows,
[00:20:04] Joe Rogan: the defense grows, and it just keeps going on and on and on
[00:20:07] Joe Rogan: and they'll always be able to fight off any sort of intrusions?
[00:20:13] Not forever.
[00:20:15] Some intrusions will get in and they will all learn from it.
[00:20:19] Jensen Huang: And you know the reason why cybersecurity works is because, of course,
[00:20:23] Jensen Huang: the technology of defense is advancing very quickly.
[00:20:27] Jensen Huang: The technology of defense is advancing very quickly.
[00:20:30] Jensen Huang: However, the benefit of the cybersecurity defense is that,
[00:20:36] Jensen Huang: socially, the community, all of our companies work together as one.
[00:20:42] Jensen Huang: Most people don't realize this.
[00:20:45] There's a whole community of cybersecurity experts.
[00:20:49] Jensen Huang: We exchange ideas, we exchange best practices,
[00:20:54] Jensen Huang: we exchange what we detect.
[00:20:57] Jensen Huang: The moment something has been breached or maybe there's a loophole or whatever it is,
[00:21:02] Jensen Huang: it is shared by everybody, the patches are shared with everybody.
[00:21:05] Jensen Huang: That's interesting.
[00:21:06] Jensen Huang: Yeah, most people don't realize this.
[00:21:08] Jensen Huang: No, no, no idea.
[00:21:09] Jensen Huang: I've assumed that it would just be competitive like everything else.
[00:21:12] Joe Rogan: No, no, no, we work together all of a sudden.
[00:21:14] Joe Rogan: Is that always been the case?
[00:21:16] Jensen Huang: It surely has been the case for about 15 years.
[00:21:20] Jensen Huang: It might not have been the case long ago.
[00:21:22] Jensen Huang: But this...
[00:21:23] Jensen Huang: What do you think started off that cooperation?
[00:21:27] Jensen Huang: People recognizing it's a challenge and no company can stand alone.
[00:21:31] Jensen Huang: And the same thing is going to happen with AI.
[00:21:34] Jensen Huang: I think we all have to decide working together to stay out of harm's way
[00:21:40] Jensen Huang: is our best chance for defense.
[00:21:42] Jensen Huang: Then it's basically everybody against the threat.
[00:21:45] Jensen Huang: And it also seems like you'd be way better at detecting
[00:21:49] Joe Rogan: where these threats are coming from and neutralizing them.
[00:21:51] Joe Rogan: Exactly.
[00:21:52] Joe Rogan: Because the moment you detect that somewhere,
[00:21:54] Jensen Huang: you're going to find out right away.
[00:21:55] Jensen Huang: It'll be really hard to hide.
[00:21:57] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[00:21:58] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[00:21:59] Jensen Huang: That's how it works.
[00:22:00] Jensen Huang: That's the reason why it's safe.
[00:22:01] Jensen Huang: That's why I'm sitting here right now instead of locking everything down in video.
[00:22:04] Jensen Huang: It's not only am I watching my own back.
[00:22:09] Jensen Huang: I've got everybody watching my back.
[00:22:11] Jensen Huang: And I'm watching everybody else's back.
[00:22:13] Jensen Huang: It's a bizarre world, isn't it?
[00:22:14] Jensen Huang: Let me think about that.
[00:22:15] Jensen Huang: Cyber threats.
[00:22:16] Joe Rogan: And this idea about cybersecurity is unknown to the people who are talking about AI.
[00:22:20] Jensen Huang: They're talking about AI threats.
[00:22:23] Jensen Huang: I think when they think about AI threats and AI cyber security threats,
[00:22:26] Jensen Huang: they have to also think about how we deal with it today.
[00:22:29] Jensen Huang: Now, there's no question that AI is a new technology.
[00:22:34] Jensen Huang: And it's a new type of software in the end of software.
[00:22:37] Jensen Huang: It just is a new type of software.
[00:22:39] Jensen Huang: And so it's going to have new capabilities.
[00:22:41] Jensen Huang: But so would the defense.
[00:22:43] Jensen Huang: You know, well, you used the same AI technology to go defend against it.
[00:22:47] Jensen Huang: So do you anticipate a time ever in the future where it's going to be impossible?
[00:22:53] Joe Rogan: Where there's not going to be any secrets?
[00:22:56] Joe Rogan: Where the bottleneck between the technology that we have and the information that we have,
[00:23:01] Joe Rogan: information is just all a bunch of ones and zeros.
[00:23:03] Joe Rogan: It's out there on hard drives and the technology has more and more access to that information.
[00:23:07] Joe Rogan: Is it ever going to get to a point in time where there's no way to keep a secret?
[00:23:12] Joe Rogan: I don't know.
[00:23:14] It seems like that's where everything is kind of headed.
[00:23:16] Joe Rogan: I don't think so.
[00:23:17] Joe Rogan: I think the quantum computers we're supposed to,
[00:23:19] Jensen Huang: right?
[00:23:20] Jensen Huang: Yeah, quantum computers will make it possible.
[00:23:22] Jensen Huang: We'll make it so that the previous quantum, previous encryption technology is obsolete.
[00:23:28] Jensen Huang: But that's the reason why the entire industry is working on post-quantum encryption technology.
[00:23:36] Jensen Huang: What would that look like?
[00:23:38] Jensen Huang: New algorithms.
[00:23:40] Jensen Huang: The crazy thing is when you hear about the kind of computation that quantum computing can do,
[00:23:45] Joe Rogan: and the power that it has, where you're looking at all the supercomputers in the world,
[00:23:50] Joe Rogan: that would take billions of years, and it takes them a few minutes to solve these equations.
[00:23:53] Joe Rogan: How do you make encryption for something that can do that?
[00:23:57] Joe Rogan: I'm not sure.
[00:23:58] Joe Rogan: But I've got a bunch of scientists who are working on that.
[00:24:01] Jensen Huang: But I think it figured out.
[00:24:03] Jensen Huang: Yeah, we've got a bunch of scientists who are exporting that.
[00:24:06] Jensen Huang: And the ultimate fear that it can't be breached, that quantum computing will always be able to decrypt all other quantum computing encryption?
[00:24:14] Joe Rogan: I don't know.
[00:24:15] Joe Rogan: It just gets to some point where it's like stop playing the stupid game.
[00:24:19] Joe Rogan: We know everything.
[00:24:20] Joe Rogan: I don't think so.
[00:24:21] Joe Rogan: No, because I'm, you know, history is guide.
[00:24:25] Joe Rogan: History is guide before AI came around.
[00:24:27] Joe Rogan: That's my worry.
[00:24:28] Joe Rogan: My worry is this is a total, you know, it's like history was one thing,
[00:24:32] Joe Rogan: and then nuclear weapons kind of changed all of our thoughts on war and mutually sure destruction
[00:24:37] Joe Rogan: came, got everybody to stop using nuclear bombs.
[00:24:42] Joe Rogan: Yeah, my worry is that the thing is Joe is that that AI is not going to,
[00:24:46] Jensen Huang: it's not like we're cavemen, and then all of a sudden one day AI shows up.
[00:24:51] Jensen Huang: Every single day we're getting better and smarter because we have AI.
[00:24:56] Jensen Huang: And so we're stepping on our own AI's shoulders.
[00:24:59] Jensen Huang: So when that, whatever that AI threat comes, it's a click ahead.
[00:25:05] Jensen Huang: It's not a galaxy ahead.
[00:25:07] Jensen Huang: You know, it's just a click ahead.
[00:25:09] Jensen Huang: And so, so I think, I think the idea that somehow this AI is going to pop out of nowhere
[00:25:19] Jensen Huang: and somehow think in a way that we can't even imagine thinking
[00:25:24] Jensen Huang: and do something that we can't possibly imagine, I think is far fetched.
[00:25:28] Jensen Huang: And the reason for that is because we're all have, we all have AI's.
[00:25:32] Jensen Huang: And you know, there's a whole bunch of AI's being in development.
[00:25:35] Jensen Huang: We know what they are and we're using it.
[00:25:37] Jensen Huang: And so every single day we're getting close to each other.
[00:25:41] Jensen Huang: But don't they do things that are very surprising?
[00:25:45] Yeah, but so you have an AI that does something surprising.
[00:25:48] Jensen Huang: I'm going to have an AI.
[00:25:49] Jensen Huang: Right.
[00:25:50] Jensen Huang: And my AI looks at your AI and goes, that's not that surprising.
[00:25:52] Jensen Huang: The fear for the lay person like myself is that AI becomes sentient
[00:25:56] Joe Rogan: and makes its own decisions.
[00:25:58] Joe Rogan: And then ultimately decides to just govern the world, do it its own way.
[00:26:05] They're like, you guys, you had a good run, but we're taking over now.
[00:26:09] Joe Rogan: Yeah, but my AI is going to take care of me.
[00:26:14] Jensen Huang: So, that's the, this is the cybersecurity argument.
[00:26:18] Jensen Huang: Yes.
[00:26:19] Jensen Huang: Well, do you have an AI and it's super smart.
[00:26:22] Jensen Huang: But my AI is super smart too.
[00:26:24] Jensen Huang: And maybe your AI, let's pretend, let's pretend for a second that we understand what consciousness is
[00:26:31] Jensen Huang: and we understand what sentience is.
[00:26:33] Jensen Huang: And that in fact, we really are just pretending.
[00:26:35] Joe Rogan: Okay, let's just pretend for a second that we believe that.
[00:26:38] Jensen Huang: I don't believe actually, I don't actually don't believe that.
[00:26:40] Jensen Huang: But nonetheless, let's pretend we believe that.
[00:26:42] Jensen Huang: So your AI is conscious and my AI is conscious.
[00:26:45] Jensen Huang: And let's say your AI is, you know, wants to, I don't know, do something surprising.
[00:26:51] Jensen Huang: My AI is so smart that it won't, it might be surprising to me, but it probably won't be surprising to my AI.
[00:26:58] Jensen Huang: And so maybe my AI thinks is surprising as well.
[00:27:03] Jensen Huang: But it's so smart.
[00:27:05] Jensen Huang: The moment it sees it the first time, it's not going to be surprised the second time.
[00:27:08] Jensen Huang: It's just like us.
[00:27:09] Jensen Huang: And so I feel like I think the idea that that only one person has AI and that one person's AI is
[00:27:19] Jensen Huang: compares everybody else's AI is Neanderthal is probably unlikely.
[00:27:25] Jensen Huang: I think it's much more like cybersecurity.
[00:27:28] Jensen Huang: Interesting.
[00:27:30] Joe Rogan: I think the fear is not that your AI is going to battle with somebody else's AI.
[00:27:35] Joe Rogan: The fear is that AI is no longer going to listen to you.
[00:27:39] Joe Rogan: That's the fear is that human beings won't have control over it after a certain point.
[00:27:43] Joe Rogan: If it achieves sentience and then has the ability to be autonomous.
[00:27:48] Joe Rogan: That there's one AI.
[00:27:50] Joe Rogan: Well, they just combine.
[00:27:52] Joe Rogan: Yeah, it becomes one AI.
[00:27:54] Joe Rogan: That it's a life form.
[00:27:55] Joe Rogan: But there's arguments about that, right?
[00:27:57] Joe Rogan: That we're dealing with some sort of synthetic biology.
[00:27:59] Joe Rogan: That it's not as simple as new technology that you're creating a life form.
[00:28:03] Joe Rogan: If it's like life form, let's go along with that for a while.
[00:28:08] Jensen Huang: I think if it's like life form, as you know, all life forms don't agree.
[00:28:12] Jensen Huang: And so I'm going to have to go with your life form and my life form, I'm going to agree.
[00:28:17] Jensen Huang: Because my life form is going to want to be the super life form.
[00:28:20] Jensen Huang: And now that we have disagreeing life forms, we're back again to where we are.
[00:28:26] Jensen Huang: Well, they would probably cooperate with each other.
[00:28:29] Joe Rogan: The reason why we don't cooperate with each other is we're territorial primates.
[00:28:36] Joe Rogan: But AI wouldn't be a territorial primate.
[00:28:39] Joe Rogan: It would realize the folly in that sort of thinking.
[00:28:42] Joe Rogan: And they would say, listen, there's plenty of energy for everybody.
[00:28:46] Joe Rogan: We don't need to dominate.
[00:28:49] Joe Rogan: We're not trying to acquire resources and take over the world.
[00:28:52] Joe Rogan: We're not looking to find a good breeding partner.
[00:28:55] Joe Rogan: We're just existing as a new super life form that these cute monkeys created for us.
[00:29:03] Joe Rogan: Okay. Well, that would be a super power with no ego.
[00:29:11] Jensen Huang: Right. And if it has no ego, why would have to ego to do any harm to us?
[00:29:19] Jensen Huang: Well, I don't assume that it would do harm to us.
[00:29:22] Joe Rogan: But the fear would be that we would no longer have control.
[00:29:26] Joe Rogan: And that we would no longer be the apex species on the planet.
[00:29:30] Joe Rogan: This thing that we created would now be.
[00:29:33] Joe Rogan: Is that funny?
[00:29:35] No. I just care.
[00:29:37] Joe Rogan: It's not going to happen.
[00:29:38] Joe Rogan: I know you think it's like that.
[00:29:40] Joe Rogan: But it could, right?
[00:29:41] Joe Rogan: And here's the other thing is like if we're racing towards could,
[00:29:45] Joe Rogan: and could could be the end of human beings being control of our own destiny.
[00:29:52] Joe Rogan: I just think it's extremely unlikely.
[00:29:55] Joe Rogan: That's what they said in the Terminator movie.
[00:29:58] Joe Rogan: And it hasn't happened.
[00:29:59] Joe Rogan: No, not yet. But you guys are working towards it.
[00:30:02] Joe Rogan: The thing about, you're saying about conscience and sentience,
[00:30:05] Joe Rogan: that you don't think that AI will achieve consciousness?
[00:30:09] Joe Rogan: Or the consciousness is the definition.
[00:30:11] Joe Rogan: What's the definition?
[00:30:12] Joe Rogan: What is the definition to you?
[00:30:15] Jensen Huang: Consciousness.
[00:30:19] Jensen Huang: I guess first of all, you need to know about your own existence.
[00:30:35] You have to have experience, not just knowledge and intelligence.
[00:30:46] The concept of a machine having an experience,
[00:30:51] Jensen Huang: I'm not, well, first of all, I don't know what defines experience,
[00:30:54] Jensen Huang: why we have experiences.
[00:30:56] Jensen Huang: Right.
[00:30:57] Jensen Huang: And why this microphone doesn't.
[00:31:00] Jensen Huang: And so I think I know,
[00:31:03] Jensen Huang: well, I think I know what consciousness is.
[00:31:09] Jensen Huang: The sense of experience, the ability to know self versus,
[00:31:14] Jensen Huang: versus the ability to be able to reflect,
[00:31:20] Jensen Huang: know our own self, the sense of ego.
[00:31:24] Jensen Huang: I think all of those human experiences probably is what consciousness is.
[00:31:32] Jensen Huang: But why it exists versus the concept of knowledge and intelligence,
[00:31:41] Jensen Huang: which is what AI is defined by today.
[00:31:44] Jensen Huang: It has knowledge, it has intelligence, artificial intelligence.
[00:31:48] Jensen Huang: We don't call it artificial consciousness.
[00:31:50] Jensen Huang: Artificial intelligence, the ability to perceive, recognize, understand,
[00:32:01] Jensen Huang: plan, perform tasks.
[00:32:06] Jensen Huang: Those things are foundations of intelligence to know things, knowledge.
[00:32:14] Jensen Huang: I don't, it's clearly different than consciousness.
[00:32:17] Jensen Huang: But consciousness is so loosely defined.
[00:32:19] Joe Rogan: How can we say that?
[00:32:20] Joe Rogan: I mean, doesn't a dog have consciousness?
[00:32:22] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[00:32:23] Joe Rogan: Dogs seem to be pretty conscious.
[00:32:24] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[00:32:25] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[00:32:26] Jensen Huang: So, and that's a lower level consciousness than a human being's consciousness.
[00:32:29] Joe Rogan: I'm not sure.
[00:32:30] Yeah.
[00:32:31] Jensen Huang: Right.
[00:32:32] Jensen Huang: Well, the question is what, a lower level intelligence,
[00:32:35] Jensen Huang: it's lower level intelligence, but I don't know that's a lower level consciousness.
[00:32:38] Jensen Huang: That's a good point.
[00:32:39] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[00:32:40] Jensen Huang: Because I believe my dogs feel as much as I feel.
[00:32:42] Jensen Huang: Yeah, they feel a lot.
[00:32:43] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[00:32:44] Joe Rogan: Right.
[00:32:45] Yeah, they get attached to you.
[00:32:46] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[00:32:47] Joe Rogan: They get depressed if you're not there.
[00:32:48] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[00:32:49] Joe Rogan: Exactly.
[00:32:50] Joe Rogan: There's definitely that.
[00:32:51] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[00:32:52] Joe Rogan: The concept of experience,
[00:32:55] Joe Rogan: right?
[00:32:56] Joe Rogan: But isn't AI interacting with society?
[00:32:59] Joe Rogan: So, doesn't it acquire experience through that interaction?
[00:33:03] Joe Rogan: I don't think interactions is experience.
[00:33:06] Jensen Huang: I think experience is experience is a collection of feelings, I think.
[00:33:14] You're aware of that AI, I forget which one, where they gave it some false information about one of the programmers having an affair with his wife,
[00:33:23] Joe Rogan: just to see how it would respond to it.
[00:33:25] Joe Rogan: And then when they said they were going to shut it down, it threatened a black male and reveal his affair.
[00:33:29] Joe Rogan: And it was like, whoa, like it's conniving.
[00:33:32] Joe Rogan: Like if that's not learning from experience and being aware that you're about to be shut down,
[00:33:38] Joe Rogan: which would imply at least some kind of consciousness, or you could kind of define it as consciousness if you were very loose with the term.
[00:33:45] Joe Rogan: And if you imagine that this is going to exponentially become more powerful,
[00:33:51] wouldn't that ultimately lead to a different kind of consciousness than we're defining from biology?
[00:33:57] Joe Rogan: Well, first of all, let's just break down what it probably did.
[00:34:00] Jensen Huang: It probably read somewhere.
[00:34:02] Jensen Huang: There's probably text that in these consequences, certain people did that.
[00:34:10] Jensen Huang: I could imagine a novel.
[00:34:12] Jensen Huang: Right.
[00:34:13] Jensen Huang: Having those words related.
[00:34:15] Jensen Huang: Sure.
[00:34:16] Jensen Huang: And so inside, it realizes a strategy for survival.
[00:34:19] Joe Rogan: It's just a bunch of numbers.
[00:34:20] Joe Rogan: Black male.
[00:34:21] Joe Rogan: It's just a bunch of numbers.
[00:34:22] Jensen Huang: That in the collection of numbers that relates to a husband cheating on a wife,
[00:34:30] Jensen Huang: has subsequently a bunch of numbers that relates to black male and such things.
[00:34:38] Jensen Huang: Whatever the revenge was.
[00:34:40] Jensen Huang: Right.
[00:34:41] Jensen Huang: And so it has spewed it out.
[00:34:44] Jensen Huang: And so it's just like, you know, it's just as if I'm asking it to write me a poem in Shakespeare.
[00:34:50] Jensen Huang: It's just whatever the words are.
[00:34:53] Jensen Huang: And that dimensionality, this dimensionality is all these vectors in multi-dimensional space.
[00:35:00] Jensen Huang: These words that were in the prompt that described the affair,
[00:35:09] Jensen Huang: subsequently led to one word after another, led to some revenge and something.
[00:35:15] Jensen Huang: But it's not because it had consciousness or it just spewed out those words, generated those words.
[00:35:20] Jensen Huang: I understand what you're saying.
[00:35:22] Joe Rogan: That it's not in front of patterns that human beings exhibited, both in literature and in real life.
[00:35:26] Joe Rogan: That's exactly right.
[00:35:27] Joe Rogan: But at a certain point in time, one would say, okay, well, it couldn't do this two years ago.
[00:35:32] Joe Rogan: And it couldn't do this four years ago.
[00:35:35] Joe Rogan: Like when we're looking towards the future, like at what point in time, when it can do everything a person does,
[00:35:40] Joe Rogan: what point in time do we decide that it's conscious?
[00:35:43] Joe Rogan: If it absolutely mimics all human thinking and behavior patterns, that doesn't make a conscious.
[00:35:50] Joe Rogan: And becomes indesernable.
[00:35:51] Joe Rogan: It's aware, it can communicate with you the exact same way a person can.
[00:35:55] Joe Rogan: Like is consciousness, are we putting too much weight on that concept?
[00:36:00] Joe Rogan: Because it seems like it's a version of a kind of consciousness.
[00:36:04] Joe Rogan: It's a version of imitation.
[00:36:06] Joe Rogan: I'm not perfectly imitates it.
[00:36:09] Jensen Huang: I still think it's an example of imitation.
[00:36:12] Jensen Huang: So it's like a fake Rolex when they 3D print them and make them look indesernable?
[00:36:15] Joe Rogan: The question is, what's the definition of consciousness?
[00:36:18] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[00:36:19] Joe Rogan: That's the question.
[00:36:20] And I don't think anybody's really clearly defined that.
[00:36:23] Joe Rogan: That's where it gets weird.
[00:36:24] Joe Rogan: And that's where the real Doomsday people are worried that you are creating a form of consciousness that you can't control.
[00:36:31] Joe Rogan: I believe it is possible to create a machine that imitates human intelligence
[00:36:42] Jensen Huang: and has the ability to understand information, understand instructions, break the problem down.
[00:36:53] Jensen Huang: Solve problems and perform tasks.
[00:36:56] Jensen Huang: I believe that completely.
[00:36:59] Jensen Huang: I believe that we could have a computer that has a vast amount of knowledge.
[00:37:09] Jensen Huang: Some of it true, some of it not true.
[00:37:12] Jensen Huang: Some of it generated by humans, some of it generated synthetically.
[00:37:18] Jensen Huang: And more and more of knowledge in the world will be generated synthetically going forward.
[00:37:24] Jensen Huang: Until now, the knowledge that we have, our knowledge that we generate and we propagate and we send to each other
[00:37:33] Jensen Huang: and we amplify it and we add to it and we modify it, we change it.
[00:37:38] Jensen Huang: In the future, in a couple of years, maybe two or three years, 90% of the world's knowledge
[00:37:46] Jensen Huang: will likely be generated by AI.
[00:37:48] Jensen Huang: That's crazy.
[00:37:49] Jensen Huang: I know, but it's just fine.
[00:37:51] Jensen Huang: But it's just fine.
[00:37:52] I know.
[00:37:53] Joe Rogan: And the reason for that is this.
[00:37:55] Jensen Huang: Let me tell you why.
[00:37:56] Jensen Huang: It's because what differences am I to me that I am learning from a textbook that was generated by a bunch of people I didn't know
[00:38:08] Jensen Huang: or written by a book that from somebody I don't know.
[00:38:12] Jensen Huang: To knowledge generated by AI computers that are simulating all of these and recenthizing things.
[00:38:20] Jensen Huang: To me, I don't think there's a whole lot of difference.
[00:38:22] Jensen Huang: We still have to fact check it.
[00:38:25] Jensen Huang: We still have to make sure that it's based on fundamental first principles.
[00:38:29] Jensen Huang: We still have to do all of that, just like we do today.
[00:38:31] Jensen Huang: Is this taking into account the kind of AI that exists currently and do you anticipate that just like we could have never really believed that AI would be, or at least personally, myself would never believe AI would be as so ubiquitous and so worth.
[00:38:46] Joe Rogan: It's so powerful today and so important today.
[00:38:49] Joe Rogan: You never thought that 10 years ago.
[00:38:51] Joe Rogan: You never thought that.
[00:38:52] Joe Rogan: Right.
[00:38:53] Joe Rogan: Imagine like what are we looking at 10 years from now?
[00:38:57] I think that if you reflect back 10 years from now, you would say the same thing that we would have never believed that.
[00:39:06] Jensen Huang: In a different direction.
[00:39:08] Jensen Huang: Right.
[00:39:09] Jensen Huang: But if you go forward nine years from now and then ask yourself what's going to happen 10 years from now, I think it will be quite gradual.
[00:39:19] Jensen Huang: One of the things that Elon said that makes me happy is he believes that AI would be the best.
[00:39:25] Joe Rogan: He believes that we're going to get to a point where it's not necessary for people to work and not meaning that you're going to have no purpose in life.
[00:39:37] Joe Rogan: But you will have in his words universal high income because so much revenue is generated by AI that it will take away this need for people to do things that they don't really enjoy doing just for money.
[00:39:53] Joe Rogan: And I think a lot of people have a problem with that because their entire identity and how they think of themselves and how they fit in the community is what they do.
[00:40:02] Joe Rogan: Like this is Mike.
[00:40:03] Joe Rogan: He's an amazing mechanic.
[00:40:04] Joe Rogan: Go to Mike and Mike takes care of things.
[00:40:06] Joe Rogan: But there's going to come a point in time where AI is going to be able to do all those things much better than people do.
[00:40:13] Joe Rogan: And people will just be able to receive money.
[00:40:16] Joe Rogan: But then what does Mike do?
[00:40:17] Joe Rogan: Mike is really loves being the best mechanic around.
[00:40:22] Joe Rogan: What does the guy who codes?
[00:40:26] What does he do when AI can code infinitely faster with zero errors?
[00:40:31] Joe Rogan: What happens with all those people?
[00:40:34] Joe Rogan: And that is where it gets weird.
[00:40:36] Joe Rogan: It's like because we've sort of wrapped our identity as human beings around what we do for a living.
[00:40:41] When you meet someone, one of the first things you meet somebody at a party,
[00:40:45] Joe Rogan: Hi Joe, what's your name?
[00:40:46] Joe Rogan: Mike, what do you do?
[00:40:47] Joe Rogan: Mike and Mike's like, oh, I'm a lawyer.
[00:40:49] Joe Rogan: Oh, what kind of law?
[00:40:50] Joe Rogan: You have a conversation.
[00:40:51] Joe Rogan: When Mike is like, I get money from the government, I play video games.
[00:40:55] Joe Rogan: It gets weird.
[00:40:56] Joe Rogan: And I think the concept sounds great until you take into account human nature.
[00:41:02] Joe Rogan: And human nature is that we like to have puzzles to solve and things to do.
[00:41:07] Joe Rogan: And an identity is wrapped around our idea that we're very good at this thing that we do for a living.
[00:41:14] Joe Rogan: Yeah, I think let's see.
[00:41:18] Jensen Huang: Let me start with the more mundane.
[00:41:20] Jensen Huang: Okay, now work backwards.
[00:41:21] Jensen Huang: Okay, work forward.
[00:41:23] Jensen Huang: So one of the predictions from Jeff Hinton,
[00:41:30] Jensen Huang: who started the whole deep learning phenomenon, deep learning technology trend,
[00:41:37] Jensen Huang: and incredible, incredible researcher, professor at University of Toronto,
[00:41:44] Jensen Huang: he invented, discovered and invented the idea of back propagation,
[00:41:51] Jensen Huang: which allows the neural network to learn.
[00:41:55] Jensen Huang: And as you know, for the audience,
[00:42:03] Jensen Huang: software historically was humans applying first principles and are thinking to describe an algorithm
[00:42:14] Jensen Huang: that is then codified just like a recipe that's codified in software.
[00:42:20] Jensen Huang: It looks just like a recipe, how to cook something.
[00:42:23] Jensen Huang: It looks exactly the same.
[00:42:24] Jensen Huang: Just in a slightly different language, we call it Python or C or C++ or whatever it is.
[00:42:31] In the case of deep learning, this invention of artificial intelligence,
[00:42:36] Jensen Huang: we put a structure of a whole bunch of neural networks and a whole bunch of math units.
[00:42:45] Jensen Huang: And we make this large structure, it's like a switchboard of little mathematical units.
[00:42:54] Jensen Huang: And we connect it all together.
[00:42:58] Jensen Huang: And we give it the input that the software would eventually receive.
[00:43:05] Jensen Huang: And we just let it randomly guess what the output is.
[00:43:11] Jensen Huang: And so we say, for example, the input could be a picture of a cat.
[00:43:16] Jensen Huang: And one of the outputs of the switchboard is where the cat signal is supposed to show up.
[00:43:24] Jensen Huang: And all of the other signals, the other ones a dog, the other ones an elephant, the other ones a tiger.
[00:43:30] And all of the other signals are supposed to be zero when I show it a cat.
[00:43:35] Jensen Huang: And the one that is a cat should be one.
[00:43:40] And I show it a cat through this big, huge network of switchboards and math units.
[00:43:46] Jensen Huang: And they're just doing multiply and ads, multiplies and ads.
[00:43:52] And this thing, this switchboard is gigantic.
[00:43:57] The more information you're going to give it, the bigger this switchboard has to be.
[00:44:02] Jensen Huang: And what Jeff Hinton discovered was invented was a way for you to guess that
[00:44:09] put the cat signal in, put the cat image in, and that cat image could be a million numbers.
[00:44:17] Jensen Huang: Because it's a megapixel image, for example.
[00:44:19] Jensen Huang: And it's just a whole bunch of numbers.
[00:44:21] Jensen Huang: And somehow from those numbers, it has to light up the cat signal.
[00:44:27] Jensen Huang: That's the bottom line.
[00:44:29] Jensen Huang: And if it, the first time you do it, it just comes up with garbage.
[00:44:36] Jensen Huang: And so it says, the right answer is cat.
[00:44:40] Jensen Huang: And so you need to increase this signal and decrease all of the other and back propagates the outcome through the entire network.
[00:44:50] Jensen Huang: And then you show it in another, now it's an image of a dog.
[00:44:54] Jensen Huang: And it guesses it, takes a swing at it, and it comes up with a bunch of garbage.
[00:45:00] Jensen Huang: And you say, no, no, no, the answer is this is a dog.
[00:45:04] Jensen Huang: I want you to produce dog.
[00:45:06] Jensen Huang: And all of the other switch, all the other outputs have to be zero.
[00:45:10] Jensen Huang: And I want to back propagate that.
[00:45:13] Jensen Huang: And just do it over and over and over again.
[00:45:15] Jensen Huang: It's just like showing a kid.
[00:45:17] Jensen Huang: This is an apple.
[00:45:18] Jensen Huang: This is a dog.
[00:45:19] Jensen Huang: This is a cat.
[00:45:20] Jensen Huang: And just keep showing it to him until they eventually get it.
[00:45:23] Jensen Huang: Okay, in any case, that big invention is deep learning.
[00:45:26] Jensen Huang: That's the foundation of artificial intelligence.
[00:45:30] Jensen Huang: A piece of software that learns from examples.
[00:45:34] Jensen Huang: That's basically machine learning, a machine that learns.
[00:45:38] Jensen Huang: And so one of the big first applications was image recognition.
[00:45:47] Jensen Huang: And one of the most important image recognition applications is radiology.
[00:45:51] Jensen Huang: And so he predicted about five years ago.
[00:45:59] Jensen Huang: That in five years time, the world won't need any radiologists.
[00:46:04] Jensen Huang: Because AI would have swept the whole field.
[00:46:07] Well, it turns out AI has swept the whole field.
[00:46:10] Jensen Huang: That is completely true.
[00:46:12] Jensen Huang: Today, just about every radiologist is using AI in some way.
[00:46:17] Jensen Huang: And what's ironic though, what's interesting is that the number of radiologists has actually grown.
[00:46:26] And so the question is why.
[00:46:28] Jensen Huang: That's kind of interesting, right?
[00:46:30] Jensen Huang: Yes.
[00:46:31] Joe Rogan: And so the prediction was in fact that 30 million radiologists will be wiped out.
[00:46:39] But as it turns out, we need it more.
[00:46:41] Jensen Huang: And the reason for that is because the purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose disease.
[00:46:48] Jensen Huang: Not to study the image.
[00:46:50] Jensen Huang: The image studying is simply a task to in service of diagnosing the disease.
[00:46:59] Jensen Huang: And so now the fact that you could study the images more quickly and more precisely
[00:47:06] Jensen Huang: without ever making a mistake and never gets tired.
[00:47:10] You could study more images.
[00:47:12] Jensen Huang: You could study it in 3D form instead of 2D.
[00:47:17] Jensen Huang: Because the AI doesn't care whether a study is images in 3D or 2D.
[00:47:21] Jensen Huang: You could study it in 4D.
[00:47:23] Jensen Huang: And so now you could study images in a way that radiologists can't easily do.
[00:47:30] Jensen Huang: And you could study a lot more of it.
[00:47:32] Jensen Huang: And so the number of tests that people are able to do increases.
[00:47:36] Jensen Huang: And because they're able to serve more patients, the hospital does better.
[00:47:42] Jensen Huang: They have more clients, more patients.
[00:47:44] Jensen Huang: As a result, they have better economics.
[00:47:47] Jensen Huang: When they have better economics, they hire more radiologists.
[00:47:49] Jensen Huang: Because their purpose is not to study the images.
[00:47:53] Jensen Huang: Their purpose is to diagnose disease.
[00:47:55] Jensen Huang: And so the question is what I'm leading up to is ultimately what is the purpose?
[00:48:01] Jensen Huang: What is the purpose of the lawyer?
[00:48:04] Jensen Huang: And has the purpose changed?
[00:48:07] Jensen Huang: What is the purpose?
[00:48:08] Jensen Huang: You know, one of the examples that I gave is that I would give is, for example,
[00:48:13] Jensen Huang: if my car became self-driving, well, all chauffeurs be out of jobs,
[00:48:18] Jensen Huang: the answer probably is not.
[00:48:21] Jensen Huang: Because for some chauffeurs, some people who are driving you, they could be protectors.
[00:48:26] Jensen Huang: Some people, they're part of the experience, part of the service.
[00:48:30] Jensen Huang: So when you get there, they could take care of things for you.
[00:48:34] Jensen Huang: And so for a lot of different reasons, not all chauffeurs would lose their jobs.
[00:48:38] Jensen Huang: Some chauffeurs would lose their jobs.
[00:48:41] Jensen Huang: And many chauffeurs would change their jobs.
[00:48:44] Jensen Huang: And the type of applications of autonomous vehicles will probably increase.
[00:48:49] Jensen Huang: You know, the usage of the technology within find new homes.
[00:48:53] Jensen Huang: And so I think you have to go back to what is the purpose of a job?
[00:48:57] Jensen Huang: You know, like, for example, if AI comes along, I actually don't believe I'm going to lose my job.
[00:49:01] Jensen Huang: Because my purpose isn't to, I have to look at a lot of documents, I study a lot of emails, I look at a bunch of diagrams.
[00:49:10] Jensen Huang: You know, the question is, what is the job?
[00:49:14] Jensen Huang: And the purpose of somebody probably hasn't changed.
[00:49:18] Jensen Huang: A lawyer, for example, helped people that probably hasn't changed.
[00:49:21] Jensen Huang: Studying legal documents, generating documents, it's part of the job, not the job.
[00:49:26] Jensen Huang: But don't you think there's many jobs that AI will replace?
[00:49:30] Joe Rogan: If your job is the task.
[00:49:32] Joe Rogan: Particularly automation.
[00:49:33] Joe Rogan: Yeah, if your job is the task.
[00:49:35] Joe Rogan: Right, so automation.
[00:49:36] Joe Rogan: Yeah, if your job is the task.
[00:49:38] Joe Rogan: That's a lot of people.
[00:49:39] Jensen Huang: It could be a lot of people, but it will probably generate, like for example, let's say we, let's say I'm super excited about the robots Elon's working on.
[00:49:50] Jensen Huang: It's still a few years away.
[00:49:53] Jensen Huang: When it happens, when it happens, there's a whole new industry of technicians and people who have to manufacture the robots, right?
[00:50:05] Jensen Huang: And so that job never existed.
[00:50:08] Jensen Huang: And so you're going to have a whole industry of people taking care of, like for example, you know, all the mechanics and all the people who are building things for cars, super charging cars.
[00:50:20] Jensen Huang: That didn't exist before cars.
[00:50:23] Jensen Huang: And now we're going to have robots.
[00:50:25] Jensen Huang: You're going to have robot apparel.
[00:50:26] Jensen Huang: So a whole industry of, right?
[00:50:28] Jensen Huang: Isn't that right?
[00:50:29] Jensen Huang: Because I want my robot to look different than you robot.
[00:50:31] Jensen Huang: Oh, God.
[00:50:32] Jensen Huang: And so you're going to have a whole apparel industry for robots.
[00:50:37] Jensen Huang: You're going to have mechanics for robots.
[00:50:39] Jensen Huang: And you have people who come to maintain your robots.
[00:50:42] Jensen Huang: You don't think so?
[00:50:44] Jensen Huang: You don't think that we're all done by other robots?
[00:50:47] Jensen Huang: Eventually, and then there will be something else.
[00:50:49] Jensen Huang: So you think ultimately people just adapt.
[00:50:53] Joe Rogan: Except if you are the task, which is a large percentage of the workforce.
[00:50:58] Joe Rogan: If your job is just the chop vegetables, cuisines, it's going to replace you.
[00:51:03] Joe Rogan: So people have to find a meeting and other things.
[00:51:06] Joe Rogan: Your job has to be more than the task.
[00:51:08] Jensen Huang: What do you think about Elon's belief that this universal basic income thing will eventually become necessary?
[00:51:17] Many people think that.
[00:51:18] Andrew Yang thinks that.
[00:51:19] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[00:51:20] Joe Rogan: He was one of the first people to sort of sound that alarm during the 2020 election.
[00:51:30] Yeah, I guess.
[00:51:34] Yeah, both ideas probably won't exist at the same time.
[00:51:37] Jensen Huang: And, and as in life, things will probably be in the middle.
[00:51:41] Jensen Huang: One idea, of course, is that there will be so much abundance of resource that nobody needs a job.
[00:51:48] Jensen Huang: And we'll all be wealthy.
[00:51:51] On the other hand, we're going to need universal basic income.
[00:51:56] Jensen Huang: Both ideas don't exist at the same time.
[00:51:59] Jensen Huang: And so we're either going to be all wealthy, or we're going to be all using it.
[00:52:03] Jensen Huang: How could everybody be wealthy, though?
[00:52:05] Joe Rogan: Well, because we're an area.
[00:52:06] Joe Rogan: Well, not because you have a lot of dollars, wealthy because there's a lot of abundance.
[00:52:10] Jensen Huang: Like, for example, today, we are wealthy of information.
[00:52:15] Jensen Huang: You know, this is a concept several thousand years ago, only a few people have.
[00:52:20] Jensen Huang: And so today, we have wealth of a whole bunch of things, resources that, that historic point.
[00:52:25] Jensen Huang: That's a good point.
[00:52:26] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[00:52:27] Jensen Huang: And so we're going to have wealth of resources, things that we think are valuable today.
[00:52:31] Jensen Huang: That in the future is just not, not that valuable.
[00:52:34] Jensen Huang: You know, and so it, because it's automated.
[00:52:37] Jensen Huang: And so I think, I think the question.
[00:52:41] Maybe partly, it's hard to answer partly because it's hard to talk about infinity.
[00:52:49] Jensen Huang: And it's hard to talk about a long time from now.
[00:52:52] Jensen Huang: And the reason for that is because there's just too many scenarios to consider.
[00:52:59] Jensen Huang: But I think in the next several years, call it five to ten years.
[00:53:05] There are several things that I believe in hope.
[00:53:10] Jensen Huang: And I say hope because I'm not sure.
[00:53:12] Jensen Huang: One of the things that I believe is that the technology divide would be substantially collapsed.
[00:53:21] And of course, the alternative viewpoint is that AI is going to increase the technology divide.
[00:53:32] Now, the reason why I believe AI is going to reduce the technology divide is because we have proof.
[00:53:39] Jensen Huang: The evidence is that AI is the easiest application in the world to use.
[00:53:44] Jensen Huang: Chat GPT has grown to almost a billion users, frankly, practically overnight.
[00:53:50] Jensen Huang: And if you're not exactly sure how to use, everybody knows how to use chat GPT.
[00:53:53] Jensen Huang: You just say something to it.
[00:53:55] Jensen Huang: If you're not sure how to use chat GPT, you ask chat GPT how to use it.
[00:53:59] Jensen Huang: No tool in history has ever had this capability.
[00:54:04] Jensen Huang: A quieson art.
[00:54:05] You know, if you don't know how to use it, you're kind of screwed.
[00:54:08] Jensen Huang: You're not walk up to and say, how do you use a quieson art?
[00:54:10] Jensen Huang: You're going to have to find somebody else.
[00:54:12] Jensen Huang: And so, but an AI will just tell you exactly how to do it.
[00:54:15] Jensen Huang: Anybody could do this.
[00:54:17] Jensen Huang: They'll speak to you in any language.
[00:54:19] Jensen Huang: And if it doesn't know your language, you'll speak it in that language.
[00:54:22] And I'll probably figure out that it doesn't completely understand your language.
[00:54:26] Jensen Huang: Go and learn it instantly and come back and talk to you.
[00:54:29] Jensen Huang: And so I think the technology divide has a real chance, finally, that you don't have to speak Python or C++ or...
[00:54:37] Jensen Huang: ...fortrend.
[00:54:38] Jensen Huang: You can just speak human.
[00:54:40] Jensen Huang: And whatever form of human you like.
[00:54:42] Jensen Huang: And so I think that that has a real chance of closing the technology divine.
[00:54:46] Jensen Huang: Now, of course, the counter-narrative would say that...
[00:54:51] Jensen Huang: ...AI is only going to be available for the nations and the countries that have a vast amount of resources.
[00:55:00] Jensen Huang: Because AI takes energy and AI takes a lot of GPUs and factories to be able to produce the AI.
[00:55:09] Jensen Huang: No doubt at the scale that we would like to do in the United States.
[00:55:13] Jensen Huang: But the fact that it matters, your phone is going to run AI just fine all by itself in a few years.
[00:55:21] Today, it already does it fairly decently.
[00:55:23] Jensen Huang: And so the fact that every country, every nation, every society will have to benefit a very good AI.
[00:55:33] Jensen Huang: It might not be tomorrow's AI.
[00:55:35] Jensen Huang: It might be yesterday's AI.
[00:55:36] Jensen Huang: But yesterday's AI is freaking amazing.
[00:55:39] In 10 years' time, nine-year-old AI is going to be amazing.
[00:55:43] Jensen Huang: You don't need a 10-year-old AI.
[00:55:45] Jensen Huang: You don't need frontier AI.
[00:55:47] Jensen Huang: Like we need frontier AI because we want to be the world leader.
[00:55:50] Jensen Huang: But for every single country, everybody, I think the capability to elevate everybody's knowledge and capability and intelligence, that day is coming.
[00:55:59] Jensen Huang: The Octagon isn't just in Las Vegas anymore.
[00:56:01] Joe Rogan: It's right in your hands with Draft King Sportsbook, the official sports betting partner of UFC.

[00:57:18] Joe Rogan: And also energy production, which is the real bottleneck when it comes to third world countries.
[00:57:24] Joe Rogan: That's right. Electricity and all the resources that we take for granted.
[00:57:30] Joe Rogan: Almost everything is going to be energy constrained.
[00:57:32] Jensen Huang: And so if you take a look at one of the most important technology advances in histories,
[00:57:40] Jensen Huang: this idea called Moore's Law. Moore's Law was the started basically in my generation.
[00:57:49] Jensen Huang: And my generation is the generation of computers. I graduated in 1984.
[00:57:55] Jensen Huang: And that was basically at the very beginning of the PC revolution.
[00:58:00] Jensen Huang: And the microprocessor. And every single year, it approximately doubled.
[00:58:09] And we describe it as every single year we double the performance.
[00:58:13] Jensen Huang: But what it really means is that every single year, the cost of computing has.
[00:58:19] Jensen Huang: And so the cost of computing in a course of five years reduced by a factor of 10,
[00:58:27] Jensen Huang: the amount of energy necessary to do computing, to do any task reduced by a factor of 10,
[00:58:33] Jensen Huang: every single 10 years, 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000, so on and so forth.
[00:58:43] Jensen Huang: And so each one of the clicks of Moore's Law, the amount of energy necessary to do any computing reduced.
[00:58:51] Jensen Huang: That's the reason why you have a laptop today.
[00:58:54] Jensen Huang: When back in 1984, it sat on the desk, you got to plug in, it wasn't that fast,
[00:58:59] Jensen Huang: and it consumed a lot of power today. It is only a few watts.
[00:59:03] Jensen Huang: And so Moore's Law is the fundamental technology, the fundamental technology trend that made it possible.
[00:59:09] Jensen Huang: Well, what's going on in AI? The reason why I'm video's here is because we invented this new way of doing computing.
[00:59:15] Jensen Huang: We call it accelerated computing. We started it 33 years ago.
[00:59:18] Jensen Huang: It took us about 30 years to really made it a huge breakthrough.
[00:59:23] Jensen Huang: In that 30 years or so, we took computing, you know, probably a factor of, well, let me just say in the last 10 years.
[00:59:33] Jensen Huang: The last 10 years, we improved the performance of computing by 100,000 times.
[00:59:41] Imagine a car over the course of 10 years and became a 100,000 times faster.
[00:59:46] Jensen Huang: Or at the same speed, 100,000 times cheaper. Or at the same speed, 100,000 times less energy.
[00:59:55] Jensen Huang: If your car did that, it needed energy at all.
[00:59:59] Jensen Huang: What I mean, what I'm trying to say is that in 10 years time, the amount of energy necessary for artificial intelligence for most people will be minuscule,
[01:00:11] utterly minuscule. And so we'll have AI running and all kinds of things in all the time because it doesn't consume that much energy.
[01:00:18] Jensen Huang: And so if you're a nation that uses AI for, you know, almost everything in your social fabric, of course you're going to need these AI factories.
[01:00:27] Jensen Huang: But for a lot of countries, I think you're going to have excellent AI and you're not going to need as much energy.
[01:00:33] Jensen Huang: Everybody will be able to come along. It's my point.
[01:00:36] Jensen Huang: So currently that is a big bottleneck, right? Is energy.
[01:00:39] Joe Rogan: It is the bottleneck.
[01:00:41] Jensen Huang: The bottleneck.
[01:00:42] Joe Rogan: So was it Google that is making nuclear power plants to operate one of its AI factories?
[01:00:49] Joe Rogan: I haven't heard that. But I think in the next six, seven years, I think you're going to see a whole bunch of small nuclear reactors.
[01:00:56] Jensen Huang: And by small and count big, you're talking about hundreds of megawatts, yeah.
[01:01:01] Joe Rogan: And that these will be local to whatever specific company they have.
[01:01:05] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[01:01:06] Joe Rogan: We'll all be power generators.
[01:01:07] Jensen Huang: Whoa.
[01:01:08] Jensen Huang: You know, just like you're, you know, somebody's smart.
[01:01:12] It's probably the smartest way to do it, right?
[01:01:15] Joe Rogan: And it takes the burden off the grid.
[01:01:18] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:01:19] Jensen Huang: And you could build as much as you need.
[01:01:21] Jensen Huang: And you can contribute back to the grid.
[01:01:23] Jensen Huang: It's a really important point that I think you just made about Moore's Law and the relationship to pricing.
[01:01:29] Joe Rogan: Because, you know, a laptop today, like you can get one of those little MacBook Airs.
[01:01:33] Joe Rogan: They're incredible.
[01:01:34] Joe Rogan: They're so thin.
[01:01:35] Joe Rogan: Unbelievable.
[01:01:36] Joe Rogan: Powerful battery life is very...
[01:01:37] Joe Rogan: You never have to charge it.
[01:01:38] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:01:39] Joe Rogan: I feel like it's crazy.
[01:01:40] Joe Rogan: And it's not that expensive.
[01:01:42] Joe Rogan: That's relatively speaking.
[01:01:43] Joe Rogan: Like something like that.
[01:01:44] Joe Rogan: I remember when that's just Moore's Law.
[01:01:46] Jensen Huang: Right.
[01:01:47] Jensen Huang: Then there's the Nvidia Law.
[01:01:48] Jensen Huang: Oh.
[01:01:49] Just right?
[01:01:50] Jensen Huang: The Law...
[01:01:51] Jensen Huang: I was talking to you about the computing that we invented.
[01:01:53] Jensen Huang: Right.
[01:01:54] Jensen Huang: The reason why we're here.
[01:01:55] Jensen Huang: This new way of doing computing is like Moore's Law on energy drinks.
[01:02:01] Jensen Huang: I mean, it's...
[01:02:02] Jensen Huang: It's like Moore's Law.
[01:02:04] Jensen Huang: It's like Moore's Law on Joe Rogan.
[01:02:09] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:02:10] That's interesting.
[01:02:11] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:02:12] Joe Rogan: That's us.
[01:02:13] Joe Rogan: So explain that.
[01:02:14] Joe Rogan: This chip that you brought to Elon.
[01:02:16] Joe Rogan: What's the significance of this?
[01:02:18] Joe Rogan: Like, why is it so superior?
[01:02:20] Joe Rogan: And so...
[01:02:23] In 2012, Jeff Hinton's lab, this gentleman I was talking about, Ilya Suskabur, Alex Khrushchevsky,
[01:02:34] they made a breakthrough in computer vision.
[01:02:38] Jensen Huang: And literally creating a piece of software called AlexNet.
[01:02:46] Jensen Huang: And its job was to recognize images.
[01:02:49] Jensen Huang: And it recognized images at a level computer vision, which is fundamental to intelligence.
[01:02:56] Jensen Huang: If you can't perceive, you can't...
[01:02:58] Jensen Huang: It's hard to have intelligence.
[01:02:59] Jensen Huang: And so computer vision is a fundamental pillar of...
[01:03:02] Jensen Huang: Not the only, but fundamental pillar of.
[01:03:04] Jensen Huang: And so, breaking...
[01:03:06] Jensen Huang: Computer vision, we're breaking through in computer vision, is pretty foundational to almost everything that everybody wants to do in AI.
[01:03:13] Jensen Huang: And so, in 2012,
[01:03:16] their lab in Toronto,
[01:03:19] Jensen Huang: I made this breakthrough called AlexNet.
[01:03:23] Jensen Huang: And AlexNet was able to recognize images.
[01:03:27] Jensen Huang: So much better than any human created computer vision algorithm in the 30 years prior.
[01:03:36] Jensen Huang: So all of these people, all these scientists, and we had many too, working on computer vision algorithms.
[01:03:44] Jensen Huang: And these two kids, Ilya and Alex, under Jeff Hinton, took a giant leap above it.
[01:03:55] Jensen Huang: And it was based on this thing called AlexNet, this neural network.
[01:04:00] Jensen Huang: And the way it ran, the way they made it work, was literally buying two Nvidia graphics cards.
[01:04:09] Because Nvidia's GPUs, we've been working on this new way of doing computing.
[01:04:14] Jensen Huang: And our GPUs application.
[01:04:17] Jensen Huang: And it's basically a supercomputing application, back in 1984, in order to process computer games,
[01:04:29] Jensen Huang: and what you have in your racing simulator.
[01:04:32] Jensen Huang: That is called an image generator supercomputer.
[01:04:37] And so, Nvidia started, our first application was computer graphics.
[01:04:42] Jensen Huang: And we applied this new way of doing computing, where we do things in parallel, instead of sequentially.
[01:04:48] Jensen Huang: A CPU does things sequentially.
[01:04:51] Jensen Huang: Step one, step two, step three.
[01:04:53] Jensen Huang: In our case, we break the problem down, and we give it to thousands of processors.
[01:04:59] And so, our way of doing computation
[01:05:04] is much more complicated.
[01:05:07] Jensen Huang: But if you're able to formulate the problem in the way that we created called CUDA,
[01:05:15] Jensen Huang: this is the invention of our company, if you could formulate it in that way,
[01:05:19] Jensen Huang: we could process everything simultaneously.
[01:05:22] Jensen Huang: Now, in the case of computer graphics, it's easier to do, because every single pixel on your screen
[01:05:29] Jensen Huang: is not related to every other pixel.
[01:05:32] Jensen Huang: And so, I could render multiple parts of the screen at the same time.
[01:05:37] Jensen Huang: Not completely true, because maybe the way lighting works, or the way shadow works,
[01:05:42] Jensen Huang: there's a lot of dependency and such.
[01:05:45] Jensen Huang: But computer graphics, with all the pixels, I should be able to process everything simultaneously.
[01:05:51] Jensen Huang: And so, we took this embarrassingly parallel problem called computer graphics,
[01:05:57] Jensen Huang: and we applied it to this new way of doing computing, and videos accelerated computing.
[01:06:04] We put it in all of our graphics cards.
[01:06:07] Jensen Huang: Kids were buying it to play games.
[01:06:10] Jensen Huang: You probably don't know this, but were the largest gaming platform in the world today?
[01:06:15] Jensen Huang: Oh, I know that.
[01:06:16] Joe Rogan: I used to make my own computers.
[01:06:18] Joe Rogan: I used to buy your graphics cards.
[01:06:19] Joe Rogan: Oh, that's super cool.
[01:06:20] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:06:21] Joe Rogan: Set up S.L.I. with your graphics cards.
[01:06:22] Joe Rogan: Oh, yeah, I love it.
[01:06:23] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:06:24] Joe Rogan: That's super cool.
[01:06:25] Joe Rogan: Oh, yeah, man.
[01:06:26] Jensen Huang: Oh, that's cool.
[01:06:27] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:06:28] Jensen Huang: Okay.
[01:06:29] Jensen Huang: So, S.L.I. I'll tell you the story in just a second.
[01:06:31] Jensen Huang: And how it led to Elon.
[01:06:32] Jensen Huang: I'm going to still answer in the question.
[01:06:35] And so, anyways, these two kids trained this model using the technique I described earlier
[01:06:41] Jensen Huang: on our GPUs, because our GPUs could process things in parallel.
[01:06:45] Jensen Huang: It's essentially a supercomputer in a PC.
[01:06:48] Jensen Huang: The reason why you used it for Quake is because it is the first consumer supercomputer.
[01:06:55] Jensen Huang: Okay?
[01:06:56] Jensen Huang: And so, anyways, they made that breakthrough.
[01:07:00] Jensen Huang: We were working on computer vision at the time.
[01:07:02] Jensen Huang: It caught my attention.
[01:07:05] And so, we went to learn about it.
[01:07:07] Simultaneously, this deep learning phenomenon was happening all over the country.
[01:07:13] Jensen Huang: Universities after another recognized the importance of deep learning.
[01:07:17] Jensen Huang: And all of this work was happening at Stanford, at Harvard, at Berkeley.
[01:07:21] Jensen Huang: Just all over the place.
[01:07:23] Jensen Huang: New York University, LaNgokun, Andrew Yang, at Stanford, so many different places.
[01:07:30] Jensen Huang: And I see it cropping up everywhere.
[01:07:33] And so, my curiosity asked, you know, what is so special about this form of machine learning?
[01:07:41] Jensen Huang: And we've known about machine learning for a very long time.
[01:07:43] Jensen Huang: We've known about AI for a very long time.
[01:07:45] Jensen Huang: We've known about neural networks for a very long time.
[01:07:48] What makes now the moment?
[01:07:50] Jensen Huang: And so, we've realized that this architecture for deep neural networks, back propagation,
[01:07:57] Jensen Huang: the way deep neural networks were created, we could probably scale this problem,
[01:08:03] Jensen Huang: scale the solution to solve many problems.
[01:08:07] Jensen Huang: That is essentially a universal function approximator.
[01:08:13] Jensen Huang: Meaning, you know, back when you're in school, you have a box inside of it.
[01:08:20] Jensen Huang: It's a function, you give it an input, it gives you an output.
[01:08:24] And the reason why I call it a universal function approximator is that this computer,
[01:08:30] Jensen Huang: instead of you describing the function, a function could be a new in this equation,
[01:08:35] Jensen Huang: f equals m a, that's a function.
[01:08:37] Jensen Huang: You write the function in software, you give it input f, a mass,
[01:08:42] Jensen Huang: acceleration, it'll tell you the force.
[01:08:45] Jensen Huang: Okay? And the way this computer works is really interesting.
[01:08:51] Jensen Huang: You give it a universal function.
[01:08:54] Jensen Huang: It's not f equals m a, just a universal function, it's a big, huge, deep neural network.
[01:09:00] And instead of describing the inside, you give it examples of input and output.
[01:09:07] Jensen Huang: And it figures out the inside.
[01:09:10] So you give it input and output and it figures out the inside.
[01:09:13] Jensen Huang: A universal function approximator.
[01:09:15] Jensen Huang: Today, it could be Newton's equation, tomorrow, it could be Maxwell's equation,
[01:09:20] Jensen Huang: it could be Kuhlom's law, it could be Thermal Dynamics equation, it could be, you know,
[01:09:24] Jensen Huang: Schrodinger's equation for quantum physics.
[01:09:27] Jensen Huang: And so you could put any, you could have this describe almost anything.
[01:09:32] Jensen Huang: So long as you have the input and the output.
[01:09:35] Jensen Huang: So long as you have the input and the output, or it could learn the input and output.
[01:09:39] Jensen Huang: And so we took a step back and we said, hang on second, this isn't just for computer vision.
[01:09:46] Deep learning could solve any problem.
[01:09:49] Jensen Huang: All the problems that are interesting.
[01:09:51] Jensen Huang: So long as we have input and output.
[01:09:54] Jensen Huang: Now what has input and output?
[01:09:57] Well, the world.
[01:09:59] Jensen Huang: The world has input and output.
[01:10:01] Jensen Huang: And so we could have a computer that could learn almost anything, machine learning, artificial intelligence.
[01:10:07] Jensen Huang: And so we reasoned that maybe this is the fundamental breakthrough that we needed.
[01:10:12] Jensen Huang: There were a couple of things that had to be solved.
[01:10:15] Jensen Huang: For example, we had to believe that you could actually scale this up to giant systems.
[01:10:19] Jensen Huang: It was running in a, they had two graphics cards, two GTX 580s.
[01:10:24] Jensen Huang: Which, by the way, is exactly your S.I. configuration.
[01:10:30] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:10:31] Jensen Huang: Okay. So that GTX 580 S.I.
[01:10:35] Jensen Huang: was the revolutionary computer that put deep learning on the map.
[01:10:40] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:10:41] Jensen Huang: It was 2018 and you were using it to play quick.
[01:10:44] Jensen Huang: Wow. That's crazy.
[01:10:46] Joe Rogan: That was the moment. That was the big bang of modern AI.
[01:10:50] Jensen Huang: We were lucky because we were inventing this technology, this computing approach.
[01:10:55] Jensen Huang: We were lucky that they found it.
[01:10:57] Jensen Huang: Turns out they were gamers and it was lucky they found it.
[01:11:01] Jensen Huang: And it was lucky that we paid attention to that moment.
[01:11:05] Jensen Huang: It was a little bit like that Star Trek, you know, first contact.
[01:11:15] The Vulcans had to have seen the warp drive at that very moment.
[01:11:19] Jensen Huang: If they didn't witness the warp drive, you know, they would have never come to Earth.
[01:11:24] Jensen Huang: And everything would have never happened.
[01:11:27] Jensen Huang: It's a little bit like if I had paid attention to that moment, that flash,
[01:11:31] Jensen Huang: and that flash didn't last long.
[01:11:33] Jensen Huang: If I had paid attention to that flash, or our company didn't pay attention to it.
[01:11:37] Jensen Huang: Who knows what would happen.
[01:11:39] Jensen Huang: But we saw that and we reasoned our way into this is a universal function approximator.
[01:11:44] Jensen Huang: This is not just a computer vision approximator.
[01:11:47] Jensen Huang: We could use this for all kinds of things.
[01:11:49] Jensen Huang: If we could solve two problems.
[01:11:50] Jensen Huang: The first problem is that we have to prove to ourselves it could scale.
[01:11:54] Jensen Huang: The second problem we had to wait for, I guess, contribute to and wait for is
[01:12:06] Jensen Huang: the world will never have enough data on input and output, where we could supervise the AI to learn everything.
[01:12:18] Jensen Huang: For example, if we have to supervise our children on everything they learn,
[01:12:22] Jensen Huang: the amount of information they could learn is limited.
[01:12:25] Jensen Huang: We needed the AI.
[01:12:27] Jensen Huang: We needed the computer to have a method of learning without supervision.
[01:12:32] And that's where we had to wait a few more years.
[01:12:35] Jensen Huang: But unsupervised AI learning is now here.
[01:12:40] Jensen Huang: And so the AI could learn by itself.
[01:12:42] Jensen Huang: And the reason why the AI could learn by itself is because we have many examples
[01:12:47] Jensen Huang: of right answers.
[01:12:48] Jensen Huang: Like for example, if I want to learn, if I want to teach an AI how to predict the next word,
[01:12:55] Jensen Huang: I could just grab it, grab a whole bunch of texts that we already have,
[01:12:59] Jensen Huang: mask out the last word, and make it try and try and try again until it predicts the next one.
[01:13:05] Jensen Huang: Or I mask out random words inside the text, and I make it try and try and try until it predicts it.
[01:13:11] Jensen Huang: Like Mary goes down to the bank.
[01:13:17] Jensen Huang: Is that a river bank or a money bank?
[01:13:20] Well, if you're going to go down to the bank, it's probably a river bank.
[01:13:24] Jensen Huang: And it might not be obvious even from that.
[01:13:28] Jensen Huang: It might need and caught a fish.
[01:13:34] Jensen Huang: Now you know it must be the river bank.
[01:13:38] Jensen Huang: And so you give these AI as a whole bunch of these examples, and you mask out the words,
[01:13:43] Jensen Huang: it'll predict the next one.
[01:13:45] Jensen Huang: And so unsupervised learning came along.
[01:13:47] Jensen Huang: These two ideas that the fact that it's scalable and unsupervised learning came along,
[01:13:52] Jensen Huang: we were convinced that we had to put everything into this and help create this industry
[01:13:58] Jensen Huang: because we're going to solve a whole bunch of interesting problems.
[01:14:01] Jensen Huang: And that was in 2012.
[01:14:03] Jensen Huang: By 2016, I had built this computer called the DGX1.
[01:14:09] Jensen Huang: The one that you saw me give to Elon is called DGX Spark.
[01:14:14] Jensen Huang: The DGX1 was $300,000.
[01:14:18] Jensen Huang: It cost Nvidia a few billion dollars to make the first one.
[01:14:24] And instead of two chips SLI,
[01:14:29] we connected eight chips with a technology called NVLink.
[01:14:33] Jensen Huang: But it's basically SLI supercharged.
[01:14:38] Jensen Huang: And so we connected eight of these chips together instead of just two.
[01:14:42] Jensen Huang: And all of them worked together just like your Quake rig did to solve this deep learning problem to train this model.
[01:14:51] Jensen Huang: And so we created this thing.
[01:14:53] Jensen Huang: I announced it at GTC and one of our annual events.
[01:14:59] Jensen Huang: And I described this deep learning thing, computer vision thing,
[01:15:04] Jensen Huang: and this computer called DGX1.
[01:15:07] The audience was like completely silent.
[01:15:09] Jensen Huang: They had no idea what I was talking about.
[01:15:13] And I was lucky because I had known Elon.
[01:15:17] Jensen Huang: And I helped them build the first computer for Model 3, the Model S.
[01:15:25] Jensen Huang: And when he wanted to start working on autonomous vehicle,
[01:15:29] Jensen Huang: I helped them build the computer that went into the Model S AV system, his self-driving system.
[01:15:37] Jensen Huang: We were basically the FSD computer version one.
[01:15:41] Jensen Huang: And so we were already working together.
[01:15:45] Jensen Huang: And when I announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it.
[01:15:50] I had no purchase orders, not one.
[01:15:52] Jensen Huang: Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it.
[01:15:56] Jensen Huang: Except for Elon.
[01:15:58] Jensen Huang: He was at the event and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars.
[01:16:05] Jensen Huang: I think it's like 2016.
[01:16:07] Jensen Huang: Maybe that time was 2015.
[01:16:10] Jensen Huang: And he goes, you know what?
[01:16:13] Jensen Huang: I have a company that could really use this.
[01:16:16] Jensen Huang: I said, wow, my first customer.
[01:16:19] Jensen Huang: And so I was pretty excited about it.
[01:16:22] Jensen Huang: And he goes, yeah.
[01:16:25] Jensen Huang: We have this company.
[01:16:27] Jensen Huang: It's a nonprofit company.
[01:16:29] Jensen Huang: And all the blood drained out of my face.
[01:16:33] Jensen Huang: I just spent a few billion dollars building this thing.
[01:16:37] Jensen Huang: It cost $300,000.
[01:16:40] Jensen Huang: And the chances of a nonprofit being able to pay for this thing is rocks meet zero.
[01:16:45] Jensen Huang: And he goes, you know, this is an AI company.
[01:16:48] Jensen Huang: And it's a nonprofit.
[01:16:51] Jensen Huang: And we could really use one of these supercomputers.
[01:16:54] Jensen Huang: And so I picked it up.
[01:16:56] Jensen Huang: I built the first one for ourselves.
[01:16:58] Jensen Huang: We're using it inside the company.
[01:17:00] Jensen Huang: I boxed one up.
[01:17:01] Jensen Huang: I drove it up to San Francisco.
[01:17:03] Jensen Huang: In 2016, a bunch of researchers were there.
[01:17:07] Jensen Huang: Peter Beale was there.
[01:17:09] Jensen Huang: Ilya was scared.
[01:17:10] Jensen Huang: There was a bunch of people there.
[01:17:12] Jensen Huang: And I walk up to the second floor where they were all kind of in a room.
[01:17:17] Jensen Huang: This smaller than your place here.
[01:17:20] Jensen Huang: And that place turned out to have been open AI.
[01:17:24] 2016.
[01:17:26] Jensen Huang: Just a bunch of people sitting in a room.
[01:17:30] It's not really nonprofit anymore.
[01:17:32] Joe Rogan: They're not nonprofit anymore.
[01:17:34] Jensen Huang: Where do that works?
[01:17:35] Jensen Huang: Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:36] Jensen Huang: But anyhow, anyhow, Elon was there.
[01:17:39] Jensen Huang: Yeah, it was really a great moment.
[01:17:41] Jensen Huang: Oh, yeah, there you go.
[01:17:43] Jensen Huang: That's it.
[01:17:44] Jensen Huang: Look at you, bro. Same jacket.
[01:17:46] Joe Rogan: Look at that.
[01:17:48] I haven't aged.
[01:17:49] Jensen Huang: Not a lick of black hair, though.
[01:17:52] Jensen Huang: The size of it is significantly smaller.
[01:17:56] Joe Rogan: That was the other day.
[01:17:57] Joe Rogan: Okay, so there you go.
[01:17:59] Joe Rogan: Yeah, look at the difference.
[01:18:00] Joe Rogan: Exactly the same industrial design.
[01:18:03] Jensen Huang: He's holding it in his hand.
[01:18:06] Here's the amazing thing.
[01:18:08] Jensen Huang: DGX1 was one peda-flops.
[01:18:12] Jensen Huang: Okay.
[01:18:13] Jensen Huang: That's a lot of flops.
[01:18:14] Jensen Huang: And DGX Spark is one peda-flops.
[01:18:19] Nine years later.
[01:18:21] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:18:22] The same amount of computing horsepower.
[01:18:25] Jensen Huang: And a much more shrunken down.
[01:18:27] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:18:28] Jensen Huang: And instead of $300,000, it's now $4,000.
[01:18:31] Jensen Huang: And it's the size of a small book.
[01:18:34] Incredible.
[01:18:35] Jensen Huang: Crazy.
[01:18:36] That's how technology moves.
[01:18:38] Jensen Huang: Anyways, that's the reason why I wanted to give him the first one.
[01:18:40] Jensen Huang: It's so good.
[01:18:41] Jensen Huang: Because I gave him the first one 2016.
[01:18:43] Jensen Huang: It's so fascinating.
[01:18:44] Joe Rogan: If you wanted to make a story for a film, I mean, that would be the story that like, what better scenario,
[01:18:53] Joe Rogan: if it really does become a digital life form, how funny would it be?
[01:18:57] Joe Rogan: That it is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games.
[01:19:04] Joe Rogan: Exactly.
[01:19:05] It kind of cra-it's kind of crazy.
[01:19:07] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:19:08] Joe Rogan: kind of crazy when you think about it that way.
[01:19:12] Because it turns out.
[01:19:13] Joe Rogan: The origin story.
[01:19:14] Jensen Huang: Computer graphics was one of the hardest computer super computer problems.
[01:19:20] Generating reality.
[01:19:21] And also one of the most profitable to solve.
[01:19:24] Joe Rogan: Because computer games are so popular.
[01:19:26] Joe Rogan: are so popular.
[01:19:28] Joe Rogan: When Envita started in 1993, we were trying to create this new computing approach.
[01:19:34] Jensen Huang: The question is what's the killer app?
[01:19:41] The company wanted to create a new type of computing architecture, a new type of computer
[01:19:51] Jensen Huang: that can solve problems that normal computers can't solve.
[01:19:56] Well, the applications that existed in the industry in 1993 are applications that
[01:20:04] Jensen Huang: normal computers can solve because if the normal computers can solve them, why would
[01:20:08] Jensen Huang: the application exist?
[01:20:11] And so we had a mission statement for a company that has no chance of success.
[01:20:21] Jensen Huang: But I didn't know that in 1993.
[01:20:23] Jensen Huang: It just sounded like a good idea.
[01:20:25] Jensen Huang: Right.
[01:20:27] And so if we created this thing that can solve problems, you know, it's like you actually
[01:20:34] have to go create the problem.
[01:20:38] Jensen Huang: And so that's what we did.
[01:20:40] In 1993, there was no quake.
[01:20:42] Jensen Huang: John Carmack hadn't been released to him yet.
[01:20:46] You probably remember that.
[01:20:47] Jensen Huang: Sure.
[01:20:48] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:20:49] And there were no applications for it.
[01:20:53] Jensen Huang: And so I went to Japan because the arcade industry had this at the time of Sega, if you
[01:21:00] Jensen Huang: remember, the arcade machines.
[01:21:03] Jensen Huang: They came out with 3D arcade systems, virtual fighter, Daytona, virtual cop.
[01:21:11] All of those arcade games were in 3D for the very first time.
[01:21:16] Jensen Huang: And the technology they were using was from Martin Marietta, the flight simulators.
[01:21:22] Jensen Huang: They took the guts out of a flight simulator and I put it into an arcade machine.
[01:21:27] The system that you have over here, it's got to be a million times more powerful than
[01:21:32] Jensen Huang: that arcade machine.
[01:21:34] Jensen Huang: And that was a flight simulator for NASA.
[01:21:38] Whoa.
[01:21:39] Jensen Huang: And so they took the guts out of that.
[01:21:42] Jensen Huang: They were using it for flight simulation of jets and, you know, space shuttle.
[01:21:47] Jensen Huang: And they took the guts out of that.
[01:21:49] And Sega had this brilliant computer developer.
[01:21:53] Jensen Huang: His name was Yusuzuki.
[01:21:56] Yusuzuki and Miyamoto, Sega and Nintendo.
[01:22:01] Jensen Huang: These were the, you know, the incredible pioneers, the visionaries, the incredible artists.
[01:22:08] Jensen Huang: And they're both very, very technical.
[01:22:11] They were the origins really of the gaming industry.
[01:22:15] Jensen Huang: Yusuzuki pioneered 3D graphics gaming.
[01:22:20] And so I went, we created this company and there were no apps.
[01:22:27] And we were spending all of our afternoons.
[01:22:30] Jensen Huang: We told our family where we're going to work, but it was just the three of us, you know,
[01:22:34] Jensen Huang: who's going to know.
[01:22:35] Jensen Huang: And so we went to Curtis's, one of the founders, went to Curtis's townhouse and Chris and
[01:22:42] Jensen Huang: I were married.
[01:22:43] Jensen Huang: I already had Spencer and Madison.
[01:22:46] Jensen Huang: They were probably two years old.
[01:22:48] Jensen Huang: And Chris's kids are about the same age as ours.
[01:22:54] And we would go to work in this townhouse, but, you know, when you're a startup and the
[01:23:00] Jensen Huang: mission statement is the way we described, you're not going to have too many customers calling
[01:23:04] you.
[01:23:05] Jensen Huang: And so we had really nothing to do.
[01:23:08] And so after lunch, we would always have a great lunch.
[01:23:11] Jensen Huang: After lunch, we would go to the arcades and play the Sega, you know, the Sega Virtua
[01:23:16] Jensen Huang: fighter and Daytona and all those games and analyze how they're doing it, trying to figure
[01:23:21] Jensen Huang: out how they were doing that.
[01:23:24] Jensen Huang: And so we decided, let's just go to Japan and let's convince Sega to move those applications
[01:23:33] Jensen Huang: into the PC.
[01:23:35] And we would start the PC gaming, the 3D gaming industry partnering with Sega.
[01:23:42] Jensen Huang: That's how an Nvidia started.
[01:23:43] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:23:44] And so in exchange for them, developing their games for our computers in the PC, we would
[01:23:55] build a chip for their game console.
[01:23:58] Jensen Huang: That was the partnership.
[01:23:59] Jensen Huang: I built a chip for your game console.
[01:24:02] Jensen Huang: You port the Sega games to us.
[01:24:05] Jensen Huang: And then they paid us, you know, at the time, quite a significant amount of money to build
[01:24:12] Jensen Huang: that game console.
[01:24:14] And that was kind of the beginning of Nvidia getting started.
[01:24:19] Jensen Huang: And we thought we were on our way.
[01:24:22] Jensen Huang: And so I started with a business plan, a mission statement that was impossible.
[01:24:26] Jensen Huang: We lucked into the Sega partnership.
[01:24:29] Jensen Huang: We started taking off, started building our game console.
[01:24:32] Jensen Huang: And about a couple of years into it, we discovered our first technology didn't work.
[01:24:40] It was, it would have been a flaw.
[01:24:42] Jensen Huang: It was a flaw.
[01:24:44] Jensen Huang: And all of the technology ideas that we had, the architecture concepts were sound.
[01:24:51] Jensen Huang: But the way we were doing computer graphics was exactly backwards.
[01:24:55] Jensen Huang: You know, instead of, I won't bore you with the technology, but instead of inverse texture
[01:25:01] Jensen Huang: mapping, we were doing forward texture mapping.
[01:25:05] Jensen Huang: Instead of triangles, we did curve surfaces.
[01:25:09] Jensen Huang: So other people did it flat.
[01:25:11] Jensen Huang: We did it round.
[01:25:15] Jensen Huang: Other technology, the technology that ultimately won, the technology we used today has, has
[01:25:19] Jensen Huang: Z buffers.
[01:25:20] Jensen Huang: It automatically sorted.
[01:25:23] Jensen Huang: We had an architecture with no Z buffers.
[01:25:25] Jensen Huang: The application had to sort it.
[01:25:27] Jensen Huang: So we chose a bunch of technology approaches that three major technology choices, all three
[01:25:34] Jensen Huang: choices were wrong.
[01:25:36] Jensen Huang: Okay, so this is how incredibly smart we were.
[01:25:38] Jensen Huang: And so, and so in 1995, 1995, we realized we were going down the wrong path.
[01:25:46] Jensen Huang: Meanwhile, the Silicon Valley was packed with 3D graphics startups because it was the
[01:25:54] Jensen Huang: most exciting technology of that time.
[01:25:57] Jensen Huang: And so 3D effects and rendition and Silicon graphics was coming in.
[01:26:02] Jensen Huang: Intel was already in there.
[01:26:04] Jensen Huang: And, you know, gosh, what added up eventually to a hundred different startups we had to
[01:26:09] Jensen Huang: compete against.
[01:26:11] Jensen Huang: We had chosen the right technology approach and we chose the wrong one.
[01:26:17] Jensen Huang: And so we were the first company to start.
[01:26:19] We found ourselves essentially dead last with the wrong answer.
[01:26:25] Jensen Huang: And so, the company was in trouble.
[01:26:30] And ultimately we had to make several decisions.
[01:26:36] Jensen Huang: The first decision is, well, if we change now, we will be the last company.
[01:26:49] And even if we changed into the technology that we believe to be right, we'd still be
[01:26:57] Jensen Huang: dead.
[01:26:59] Jensen Huang: And so that argument, you know, do we change?
[01:27:04] Jensen Huang: And therefore, be dead.
[01:27:05] Jensen Huang: Don't change and make this technology work somehow or go do something completely different.
[01:27:13] That question stirred the company strategically and was a hard question.
[01:27:18] Jensen Huang: I eventually, you know, advocated for it.
[01:27:22] Jensen Huang: We don't know what the right strategy is, but we know what the wrong technology is.
[01:27:25] Jensen Huang: So, let's stop doing it the wrong way.
[01:27:28] Jensen Huang: And let's give ourselves a chance to go figure out what the strategy is.
[01:27:31] Jensen Huang: The second thing, the second problem we had was our company was running on a money.
[01:27:37] Jensen Huang: And I had, I was in a contract with Sega and I owed them this game console.
[01:27:43] And if that contract would have been canceled, we'd be dead.
[01:27:48] We would have vaporized instantly.
[01:27:52] And so, so I went to Japan and I explained to the CEO of Sega, Iri Madhuri, really great
[01:28:02] Jensen Huang: man.
[01:28:03] Jensen Huang: He was the former CEO of Honda USA, went back to Sega to run Sega.
[01:28:09] Jensen Huang: I went back to Japan and run Sega.
[01:28:12] Jensen Huang: And I explained to him that, I guess that was what, 33 years old.
[01:28:20] You know, when I was 33 years old, I still
[01:28:22] had acne.
[01:28:23] Jensen Huang: And I got this, you know, Chinese kid, I was super skinny.
[01:28:30] And he was already kind of elder.
[01:28:34] Jensen Huang: And I went to him and I said, I said, listen, I've got some bad news for you.
[01:28:41] Jensen Huang: And first, the technology that we promised you doesn't work.
[01:28:50] And second, we shouldn't finish your contract because we'd waste all your money and you would
[01:29:01] Jensen Huang: have something that doesn't work.
[01:29:03] Jensen Huang: And I recommend you find another partner to build your game console.
[01:29:07] Jensen Huang: Whoa.
[01:29:08] And so I'm terribly sorry that we've set you back in your product roadmap.
[01:29:16] Jensen Huang: And third, even though you're going to, I'm asking you to let me out of the contract,
[01:29:24] I still need the money because if you didn't give me the money, we'd vaporize overnight.
[01:29:35] Jensen Huang: And so I explained it to humbly, honestly, I gave him the background, explained to him
[01:29:44] Jensen Huang: why the technology doesn't work, why we thought it was going to work, why it doesn't work.
[01:29:51] And I asked him to convert the last $5 million that they were going to complete the contract
[01:30:04] Jensen Huang: to give us that money as an investment instead.
[01:30:11] And he said, but it's very likely your company will go out of business, even with my investment.
[01:30:21] And it was completely true.
[01:30:23] Jensen Huang: Back then, 1995, $5 million was a lot of money.
[01:30:27] Jensen Huang: It's a lot of money today.
[01:30:28] Jensen Huang: $5 million was a lot of money.
[01:30:30] Jensen Huang: And here's a pile of competitors doing it right.
[01:30:34] Jensen Huang: What are the chances that giving him video $5 million that we would develop the right strategy,
[01:30:40] Jensen Huang: that he would get a return on that $5 million or even get it back?
[01:30:43] Jensen Huang: Zero percent.
[01:30:45] You do the math is zero percent.
[01:30:49] If I were sitting there right there, I wouldn't have done it.
[01:30:53] $5 million was a amount of money to say at the time.
[01:30:57] Jensen Huang: And so I told him that if you invest it, that $5 million in us, it is most likely to
[01:31:10] Jensen Huang: be lost.
[01:31:12] But if you didn't invest that money, we'd be out of business.
[01:31:15] Jensen Huang: And we would have no chance.
[01:31:18] And I told him that I don't even know exactly what I said in the end, but I told him that
[01:31:30] I would understand if he decided not to, but it would make the world to me if he didn't.
[01:31:38] Jensen Huang: He went off and thought about it for a couple of days and came back and said, we'll do
[01:31:40] Jensen Huang: it.
[01:31:41] Wow.
[01:31:42] Eerie Modury.
[01:31:43] Did you have a strategy to how to correct what it was doing wrong?
[01:31:47] Joe Rogan: Did you just point out to him?
[01:31:48] Joe Rogan: Oh, man, wait until I tell you the rest of it's even scarier.
[01:31:53] Jensen Huang: Oh, no.
[01:31:57] Jensen Huang: And so what he decided was, was, Jensen was a young man.
[01:32:08] Jensen Huang: And he liked.
[01:32:09] Jensen Huang: That's it.
[01:32:10] Wow.
[01:32:11] Joe Rogan: To this day.
[01:32:13] That's nuts.
[01:32:14] Joe Rogan: I was boy, you put the world over that guy.
[01:32:19] Jensen Huang: No doubt.
[01:32:20] Right?
[01:32:21] Joe Rogan: What a crazy house.
[01:32:22] Joe Rogan: He's celebrated today in Japan.
[01:32:25] And if he were to keep that five, the investment, I think it'd be worth probably about a trillion
[01:32:32] Jensen Huang: dollars today.
[01:32:36] I know.
[01:32:37] Jensen Huang: But the moment we went public, they sold it.
[01:32:39] Jensen Huang: They said, wow, that's a miracle.
[01:32:41] They sold it.
[01:32:43] Jensen Huang: Yeah, they sold it at Nvidia valuation about 300 million.
[01:32:49] Jensen Huang: That's our IPO valuation, 300 million.
[01:32:54] Jensen Huang: And so anyhow, I was incredibly grateful.
[01:33:00] And then now we have to figure out what to do because we still were doing the wrong strategy,
[01:33:05] Jensen Huang: wrong technology.
[01:33:07] Jensen Huang: So unfortunately, we had to lay off most of the company.
[01:33:09] Jensen Huang: We shrunk the company all back.
[01:33:11] Jensen Huang: All the people working on the game console, you know, we had to shrunk it all back.
[01:33:17] Jensen Huang: And then somebody told me that, but Jensen, we've never built it this way before.
[01:33:27] Jensen Huang: We've never built it the right way before.
[01:33:31] We've only know how to build it the wrong way.
[01:33:34] And so nobody in the company knew how to build this super computing image generator, 3D
[01:33:43] Jensen Huang: graphics thing that Silicon graphics did.
[01:33:46] And so I said, okay, how hard can it be?
[01:33:52] You got all these 30 companies, you know, 50 companies doing it, how hard can it be?
[01:33:57] Jensen Huang: And so luckily, there was a textbook written by the company Silicon graphics.
[01:34:04] And so I went down to the store, I had 200 bucks in my pocket, and I bought three textbooks,
[01:34:10] Jensen Huang: only three they had, $60 a piece.
[01:34:14] Jensen Huang: I bought the three textbooks.
[01:34:16] Jensen Huang: I brought it back and I gave one to each one of the architects and I said, read that and
[01:34:19] Jensen Huang: let's go save the company.
[01:34:23] Jensen Huang: And so they read this textbook, learn from the giant at the time Silicon graphics about
[01:34:33] Jensen Huang: how to do 3D graphics.
[01:34:35] Jensen Huang: But the thing that was amazing and what makes some video special today is that the people
[01:34:42] that are there are able to start from first principles, learn best known art, but re-implement
[01:34:51] Jensen Huang: it in a way that's never been done before.
[01:34:55] And so when we re-imagined the technology of 3D graphics, we re-imagined it in a way
[01:35:03] that manifests today the modern 3D graphics, we really invented modern 3D graphics.
[01:35:09] Jensen Huang: But we learned from previous known arts and we implemented fundamentally differently.
[01:35:16] What did you do to change it?
[01:35:18] Jensen Huang: Well, you know, ultimately, ultimately the simple answer is that the way Silicon graphics
[01:35:27] Jensen Huang: works, the geometry engine is a bunch of software running on processors, we took that and
[01:35:40] Jensen Huang: eliminated all the generality, the general purposeness of it, and we reduced it down into the
[01:35:47] Jensen Huang: most essential part of 3D graphics and we hard-coded it into the chip.
[01:35:54] And so instead of something general purpose, we hard-coded it very specifically into just
[01:36:00] Jensen Huang: the limited applications, limited functionality necessary for video games.
[01:36:08] Jensen Huang: And that capability, that superch, and because we reinvented a whole bunch of stuff, it's super
[01:36:14] Jensen Huang: charged the capability that one little chip and our one little chip was generating images,
[01:36:20] Jensen Huang: as fast as a $1 million image generator.
[01:36:25] That was the big breakthrough.
[01:36:26] Jensen Huang: We took a $1 million thing and we put it into the graphics card that you now put into
[01:36:32] Jensen Huang: your gaming PC.
[01:36:34] And that was our big invention.
[01:36:36] And then, of course, the question is, how do you compete against these 30 other companies
[01:36:44] Jensen Huang: doing what they were doing?
[01:36:48] Jensen Huang: And there we did several things.
[01:36:50] Jensen Huang: One, instead of building a 3D graphics chip for every 3D graphics application, we decided
[01:37:00] Jensen Huang: to build a 3D graphics chip for one application.
[01:37:02] Jensen Huang: We bet the farm on video games.
[01:37:06] The needs of video games are very different than the needs for CAD, needs for flight simulators,
[01:37:11] Jensen Huang: they're related but not the same.
[01:37:13] Jensen Huang: And so we narrowly focused our problem statement so I could reject all of the other complexities
[01:37:19] Jensen Huang: and we shrunk it down into this one little focus and then we supercharged it for gamers.
[01:37:24] Jensen Huang: And the second thing that we did was we created a whole ecosystem of working with game developers
[01:37:32] Jensen Huang: and getting their games ported and adapted to our silicon so that we could get, turn essentially,
[01:37:40] Jensen Huang: what is a technology business into a platform business, into a game platform business?
[01:37:45] Jensen Huang: So we, you know, G-Force is really, today it's also the most advanced 3D graphics technology
[01:37:51] Jensen Huang: in the world.
[01:37:52] Jensen Huang: But a long time ago, G-Force is really the game console inside your PC.
[01:37:58] Jensen Huang: It's, you know, it runs Windows, it runs Excel, it runs PowerPoint, of course, those are
[01:38:01] Jensen Huang: easy things.
[01:38:03] Jensen Huang: But it's fundamental purpose was simply to turn your PC into a game console.
[01:38:08] Jensen Huang: So we, we were the first technology company to build all of this incredible technology
[01:38:15] Jensen Huang: in service of one audience, gamers.
[01:38:18] Jensen Huang: Now, of course in 1993, the gaming industry didn't exist.
[01:38:24] Jensen Huang: But by the time that John Carmack came along and the doom phenomenon happened and then
[01:38:29] Jensen Huang: Quake came out, as you know, that entire community boom took off.
[01:38:38] Joe Rogan: You know where the name Doom came from?
[01:38:40] Joe Rogan: It came from this, there's a scene in the movie The Color of Money where Tom Cruise, who
[01:38:45] Joe Rogan: is this elite pool player shows up at this pool hall and this local hustler says, what
[01:38:50] Joe Rogan: he got in the case and he opens up this case.
[01:38:53] Joe Rogan: He has a special pool queue he goes in here and he opens it up and he goes doom.
[01:38:57] Joe Rogan: That's where it came from.
[01:38:59] Joe Rogan: Is that right?
[01:39:00] Joe Rogan: Yeah, because Carmack said that's what they wanted to do to the gaming industry.
[01:39:03] Joe Rogan: Doom.
[01:39:04] Joe Rogan: That when doom came out, it would just be everybody be like, oh, we're fucked.
[01:39:07] Joe Rogan: Oh, wow.
[01:39:08] Joe Rogan: That's awesome.
[01:39:09] Joe Rogan: And that amazing.
[01:39:10] Joe Rogan: That's amazing.
[01:39:11] Joe Rogan: Because it's the perfect name for the game.
[01:39:12] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:39:13] Joe Rogan: And the name came out of that scene in that movie.
[01:39:14] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[01:39:15] Joe Rogan: Well, and then of course, Tim Swini and Epic Games and the 3D gaming genre took off.
[01:39:24] Jensen Huang: Yes.
[01:39:25] Jensen Huang: And so if you just kind of in the beginning was no gaming industry, we had no choice but
[01:39:31] Jensen Huang: to focus the company on one thing.
[01:39:34] That one thing.
[01:39:35] Jensen Huang: It's a really incredible origin story.
[01:39:37] Joe Rogan: Oh, it's amazing.
[01:39:39] Joe Rogan: You must look back at the zaster.
[01:39:41] Joe Rogan: It's like $5 billion.
[01:39:43] Joe Rogan: That pivot with that conversation with that gentleman.
[01:39:46] Joe Rogan: If he did not agree to that, if he did not like you, what would the world look like today?
[01:39:51] Joe Rogan: That's crazy.
[01:39:52] Joe Rogan: Oh, wait.
[01:39:53] Joe Rogan: Then our entire life hung on another gentleman.
[01:39:58] And so now here we are.
[01:40:00] We built.
[01:40:01] So before GeForce was Riva 128.
[01:40:04] Riva 128 saved the company.
[01:40:06] Jensen Huang: It revolutionized computer graphics.
[01:40:09] Jensen Huang: The performance cost performance ratio of 3D graphics for gaming was off the charts.
[01:40:16] Amazing.
[01:40:17] And we're getting ready to ship it.
[01:40:24] Get what?
[01:40:25] Jensen Huang: We're building it.
[01:40:26] But we're, so as you know, $5 million doesn't last long.
[01:40:31] And so every single month, every single month, we were drawing down.
[01:40:39] You have to build it, prototype it.
[01:40:42] Jensen Huang: You have to design it, prototype it.
[01:40:45] Get the silicon back, which costs a lot of money.
[01:40:50] Jensen Huang: Test it with software.
[01:40:53] Because without the software testing the chip, you don't know the chip works.
[01:40:58] Then you're going to find a bug, probably, because every time you test something, you find
[01:41:03] Jensen Huang: bugs.
[01:41:06] Which means you have to tape it out again, which is more time, more money.
[01:41:12] Jensen Huang: And so we did the math.
[01:41:13] Jensen Huang: There was no chance somebody was going to survive it.
[01:41:15] We didn't have that much time to tape out a chip, send it to a foundry TSMC, get the
[01:41:21] Jensen Huang: silicon back, test it, send it back out again.
[01:41:23] Jensen Huang: There was no shot, no hope.
[01:41:27] So the math, the spreadsheet, doesn't allow us to do that.
[01:41:32] Jensen Huang: And so I heard about this company.
[01:41:37] Jensen Huang: And this company built this machine.
[01:41:40] And this machine is an emulator.
[01:41:43] You could take your design, all of the software that describes the chip.
[01:41:52] And you could put it into this machine.
[01:41:54] Jensen Huang: And this machine will pretend it's our chip.
[01:41:57] So I don't have to send it to the fab, wait until the fab sends it back, test, I could
[01:42:02] Jensen Huang: have this machine pretend it's our chip.
[01:42:04] Jensen Huang: And I could put all of the software on top of this machine called an emulator and test
[01:42:10] Jensen Huang: all of the software on this pretend chip.
[01:42:14] Jensen Huang: And I could fix it all before I send it to the fab.
[01:42:18] Joe Rogan: And if I could do that, when I send it to the fab, it should work.
[01:42:24] Nobody knows, but it should work.
[01:42:27] And so we came to the conclusion that let's take half of the money we had left in the
[01:42:33] Jensen Huang: bank at the time it was about a million dollars.
[01:42:38] Jensen Huang: Take half of that money and go buy this machine.
[01:42:42] So instead of keeping the money to stay alive, I took half of the money to go buy this machine.
[01:42:47] Jensen Huang: Well I called this guy up, this company's called Icos.
[01:42:52] Called this company up and I said, listen, I heard about this machine.
[01:42:57] I like to buy one.
[01:42:59] And they go, oh, that's terrific, but we're out of business.
[01:43:03] Jensen Huang: I said, what?
[01:43:05] Jensen Huang: You're out of business.
[01:43:06] Jensen Huang: He goes, yeah, we have no customers.
[01:43:10] And I said, wait, hang on, so you never made the machine?
[01:43:16] Jensen Huang: They could say, no, no, no, we made the machine.
[01:43:19] We have one in inventory if you want it, but we're out of business.
[01:43:22] So I bought one out of inventory, okay, after I bought it, they went out of business.
[01:43:29] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:43:30] I bought it out of inventory.
[01:43:32] Jensen Huang: And on this machine, we put Envideas chip into it and we tested all of the software
[01:43:39] Jensen Huang: on top.
[01:43:41] And at this point, we were on fumes.
[01:43:45] But we convinced ourselves that chip is going to be great.
[01:43:49] And so I had to call some other gentleman.
[01:43:51] Jensen Huang: So I called TSMC.
[01:43:54] And I told TSMC, that listen, TSMC is the world's largest founder today.
[01:43:59] Jensen Huang: At the time, there was just a few hundred million dollars large, tiny little company.
[01:44:12] And I explained to them what we were doing.
[01:44:15] Jensen Huang: And I explained them, I told them I had a lot of customers.
[01:44:19] Jensen Huang: I had one, you know, diamond multimedia, probably one of the companies you bought, the graphics
[01:44:25] Jensen Huang: card from back in the old days.
[01:44:27] And I said, you know, we have a lot of customers and demands really great.
[01:44:32] Jensen Huang: And we're going to tape out a chip to you.
[01:44:37] And I like to go directly to production because I know it works.
[01:44:45] And they said, nobody has ever done that before.
[01:44:50] Nobody has ever taped out a chip that worked the first time.
[01:44:54] And nobody starts out production without looking at it.
[01:44:59] Jensen Huang: But I knew that if I didn't start to production, I'd be out of business anyways.
[01:45:04] And if I could start to production, I might have a chance.
[01:45:08] Jensen Huang: And so TSMC decided to support me.
[01:45:14] Jensen Huang: And this gentleman named Morris Chang.
[01:45:17] Jensen Huang: Morris Chang is the father of the Foundry industry, the founder of TSMC, really great man.
[01:45:27] He decided to support our company.
[01:45:29] Jensen Huang: I explained to them everything.
[01:45:32] Jensen Huang: He decided to support us, frankly, probably because they didn't have that many other customers
[01:45:37] Jensen Huang: anyhow.
[01:45:38] Jensen Huang: But they were grateful.
[01:45:40] Jensen Huang: And I was immensely grateful.
[01:45:43] Jensen Huang: And as we were starting the production, Morris flew TNUS states and he didn't so many words
[01:45:52] Jensen Huang: ask me so.
[01:45:53] Jensen Huang: But he asked me a whole lot of questions that was trying to tease out, do I have any money?
[01:46:00] But he didn't directly ask me that.
[01:46:03] Jensen Huang: And so the truth is that we didn't have all the money.
[01:46:08] Jensen Huang: But we had a strong PO from the customer.
[01:46:12] Jensen Huang: And if it didn't work, some way first would have been lost.
[01:46:16] Jensen Huang: And I'm not exactly sure what would have happened, but we would have come short.
[01:46:22] Jensen Huang: It would have been rough.
[01:46:25] Jensen Huang: But they supported us with all of that risk involved.
[01:46:28] Jensen Huang: We launched this chip, turns out to have been completely revolutionary, knocked the
[01:46:35] Jensen Huang: ball out of the park.
[01:46:37] Jensen Huang: We became the fastest growing technology company in history to go from zero to one billion
[01:46:43] Jensen Huang: dollars.
[01:46:44] Jensen Huang: So while they didn't test the chip, we tested afterwards.
[01:46:48] Joe Rogan: Yeah, we tested afterwards.
[01:46:50] Joe Rogan: Afterwards, but we did protect it.
[01:46:54] Joe Rogan: But by the way, that methodology that we developed to save the company is used throughout
[01:47:01] Jensen Huang: the world today.
[01:47:02] Jensen Huang: That's amazing.
[01:47:03] Joe Rogan: Yeah, we changed the whole world's methodology of designing chips, the whole world's rhythm
[01:47:09] Jensen Huang: of designing chips.
[01:47:11] Jensen Huang: We changed everything.
[01:47:13] How well did you sleep those days?
[01:47:15] Jensen Huang: It must have been so much stress.
[01:47:19] Jensen Huang: But what is that feeling where the world just kind of feels like it's flying?
[01:47:31] Jensen Huang: You have this, what do you call that feeling?
[01:47:35] Jensen Huang: You can't stop the feeling that everything is moving super fast.
[01:47:40] Jensen Huang: And you're laying in bed.
[01:47:44] Jensen Huang: But the world just feels like you know, and you feel deeply anxious, completely out of
[01:47:52] Jensen Huang: control.
[01:47:56] I felt that probably a couple of times in my life.
[01:48:00] Jensen Huang: It's during that time.
[01:48:02] Jensen Huang: Wow, yeah, it was incredible.
[01:48:05] Jensen Huang: What an incredible success.
[01:48:06] Jensen Huang: But I learned a lot.
[01:48:08] Jensen Huang: I learned about, I learned several things.
[01:48:10] Jensen Huang: I learned how to develop strategies.
[01:48:14] I learned how to, and when I, you know, our company learned how to develop strategies,
[01:48:21] Jensen Huang: what are winning strategies?
[01:48:22] Jensen Huang: We learned how to create a market.
[01:48:24] Jensen Huang: We created the modern 3D, gave a market.
[01:48:28] We learned how, and so that exact same skill is how we created the modern AI market.
[01:48:35] It's exactly the same.
[01:48:37] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:48:38] Jensen Huang: Yeah, exactly the same skill.
[01:48:40] Jensen Huang: It's exactly the same blueprint.
[01:48:42] Jensen Huang: And we learned how to deal with crisis.
[01:48:47] Jensen Huang: How to stay calm?
[01:48:49] Jensen Huang: How to think through things systematically?
[01:48:52] We learned how to remove all waste in the company and work from first principles and doing
[01:48:59] Jensen Huang: only the things that are essential.
[01:49:01] Everything else is waste because we have no money for it.
[01:49:05] To live on fumes at all times.
[01:49:09] And the feeling, no different than the feeling I had this morning when I woke up that you're
[01:49:16] Jensen Huang: going to be out of business.
[01:49:18] Jensen Huang: That, you know, the phrase 30 days from going out of business, I've used for 33 years.
[01:49:24] Jensen Huang: You still feel?
[01:49:25] Jensen Huang: Oh, yeah.
[01:49:26] Jensen Huang: Every morning.
[01:49:27] Jensen Huang: Every morning.
[01:49:28] Joe Rogan: But you guys are one of the biggest companies on planet earth.
[01:49:31] Jensen Huang: But the feeling doesn't change.
[01:49:33] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:49:34] The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity.
[01:49:41] It doesn't leave you.
[01:49:44] Jensen Huang: That's crazy.
[01:49:45] Jensen Huang: We were, you know, we had nothing.
[01:49:48] Jensen Huang: We had nothing.
[01:49:49] Jensen Huang: We were dealing with giant.
[01:49:50] Jensen Huang: And you still find that.
[01:49:51] Joe Rogan: Oh, yeah.
[01:49:52] Oh, yeah.
[01:49:53] Joe Rogan: Every day.
[01:49:54] Joe Rogan: Every moment.
[01:49:55] Joe Rogan: Do you think that fuels you?
[01:49:56] Joe Rogan: Is that part of the reason why the company's so successful that you have that hungry mentality?
[01:50:04] You never rest.
[01:50:06] Joe Rogan: You're never sitting on your laurels.
[01:50:07] Joe Rogan: You're always on the edge.
[01:50:12] I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed.
[01:50:22] Jensen Huang: Is that like success coaches?
[01:50:27] Joe Rogan: I tell you that's the point of the world.
[01:50:29] Joe Rogan: The world has just heard me say that for out loud for the first time.
[01:50:33] Jensen Huang: But it's true.
[01:50:34] Jensen Huang: Well, this has happened.
[01:50:36] Joe Rogan: The fear of failure drives me more than the greed or whatever it is.
[01:50:43] Joe Rogan: Well, ultimately, that's probably a more healthy approach.
[01:50:46] Joe Rogan: Now that I'm thinking about it, because like the fear...
[01:50:50] Jensen Huang: I'm not ambitious, for example.
[01:50:53] Jensen Huang: I just want to stay alive, Joe.
[01:50:55] I want the company to thrive, you know?
[01:50:57] Jensen Huang: I want us to make an impact.
[01:50:59] Joe Rogan: That's interesting.
[01:51:00] Joe Rogan: Well, maybe that's why you're so humble.
[01:51:03] Maybe that's what keeps you grounded, you know?
[01:51:06] Joe Rogan: Because with the kind of spectacular success the company has achieved, it'd be easy to
[01:51:09] Joe Rogan: get a big head.
[01:51:11] Right?
[01:51:12] Joe Rogan: But isn't that interesting?
[01:51:13] Joe Rogan: It's like, if you were the guy that your main focus is just success, you probably would
[01:51:21] Joe Rogan: well, made it, nailed it, and the man dropped the mic.
[01:51:25] Joe Rogan: It's dead.
[01:51:26] Joe Rogan: You wake up, you're like, God, we can't fuck this up.
[01:51:28] Joe Rogan: Exactly.
[01:51:29] Jensen Huang: Every morning.
[01:51:30] Joe Rogan: Not every moment.
[01:51:31] Joe Rogan: That's crazy.
[01:51:32] Joe Rogan: Before I go to bed.
[01:51:34] Joe Rogan: Well, listen, if I was a major investor in your company, that's why I'd want running it.
[01:51:38] Joe Rogan: I want a guy who's like, that's why I work.
[01:51:40] Jensen Huang: That's why I work.
[01:51:43] Jensen Huang: That's why I work seven days a week every moment.
[01:51:46] Jensen Huang: I'm awake.
[01:51:47] Jensen Huang: You work every moment.
[01:51:48] Jensen Huang: Every moment I'm awake.
[01:51:50] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:51:51] Jensen Huang: I'm thinking about solving a problem.
[01:51:53] Jensen Huang: I'm thinking about...
[01:51:54] Jensen Huang: How long can you keep this up?
[01:51:57] I don't know, but...
[01:51:58] Jensen Huang: So...
[01:51:59] Could be next week.
[01:52:00] Jensen Huang: It sounds exhausting.
[01:52:02] Jensen Huang: It sounds completely exhausting.
[01:52:05] Jensen Huang: Always in a state of anxiety.
[01:52:07] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:52:08] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:52:09] Joe Rogan: Always in a state of anxiety.
[01:52:10] Joe Rogan: Well, Kudos, to you for admitting that.
[01:52:12] Joe Rogan: I think that's important for a lot of people to hear, because there's probably some young
[01:52:17] Joe Rogan: people out there that are in a similar position to where you were when you were starting out
[01:52:23] Joe Rogan: that just feel like all those people that have made it, they're just smarter than me and
[01:52:28] Joe Rogan: they had more opportunities than me and it's just like it was handed to them or they're
[01:52:33] Joe Rogan: just in the right place at the right time.
[01:52:35] Joe Rogan: And Joe, I just described to you somebody who didn't know what was going on.
[01:52:39] Actually, did it wrong.
[01:52:41] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:52:42] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:52:43] Jensen Huang: And the ultimate diving catch, like two or three times.
[01:52:45] Jensen Huang: Crazy.
[01:52:46] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:52:47] Joe Rogan: The ultimate diving catch is the perfect way to put it.
[01:52:49] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:52:50] It's just like the edge of your glove.
[01:52:53] It probably bounced off of somebody's helmet and landed at the edge.
[01:52:57] Jensen Huang: That's incredible.
[01:53:01] Joe Rogan: That's incredible, but it's also, it's really cool that you have this perspective that you
[01:53:06] Joe Rogan: look at it that way.
[01:53:08] Joe Rogan: Because you know, a lot of people that have delusions for grandeur or they have, you know,
[01:53:15] Jensen Huang: they're in flame.
[01:53:16] Joe Rogan: And they're rewriting of history.
[01:53:19] Jensen Huang: Oftentimes had them somehow extraordinarily smart and they were geniuses and they knew
[01:53:26] Jensen Huang: all along and they were, they were spot on.
[01:53:28] Jensen Huang: The business plan was exactly what they thought.
[01:53:31] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[01:53:32] Jensen Huang: They destroyed the competition and, you know, and they emerged victorious.
[01:53:36] Jensen Huang: Me and I, you're like, I'm scared every day.
[01:53:41] Joe Rogan: Exactly.
[01:53:42] Exactly.
[01:53:43] It's so funny.
[01:53:46] Joe Rogan: Oh my God.
[01:53:47] Joe Rogan: That's amazing.
[01:53:48] Joe Rogan: It's so true though.
[01:53:49] Joe Rogan: It's amazing.
[01:53:50] Joe Rogan: It's so true.
[01:53:51] Joe Rogan: It's amazing.
[01:53:52] Jensen Huang: But I, I think there's nothing inconsistent with being a leader and being vulnerable.
[01:53:58] You know, I, the company doesn't need me to be a genius right all along, right all
[01:54:04] Jensen Huang: the time.
[01:54:06] Jensen Huang: Absolutely certain about what I'm trying to do and what I'm doing.
[01:54:09] Jensen Huang: The company doesn't need that.
[01:54:11] The company wants me to succeed.
[01:54:13] Jensen Huang: You know, the thing that, and we started out today talking about President Trump and
[01:54:18] Jensen Huang: I was about to say something.
[01:54:20] And listen, he is my president.
[01:54:23] Jensen Huang: He is our president.
[01:54:25] Jensen Huang: We should all, and we're talking about just because it's President Trump, we all want him
[01:54:29] Jensen Huang: to be wrong.
[01:54:30] Jensen Huang: I think the United States, we all have to realize he is our president.
[01:54:35] Jensen Huang: We want him to succeed because no matter who's president, that's right.
[01:54:40] Jensen Huang: That's right.
[01:54:41] Joe Rogan: We want him to succeed.
[01:54:42] Jensen Huang: We need to help him succeed because it helps everybody, all of us succeed.
[01:54:48] And I'm lucky that I work in a company where I have 40,000 people who wants me to succeed.
[01:54:58] They want me to succeed and I can tell.
[01:55:00] Jensen Huang: And they're all, every single day to help me overcome these challenges, trying to realize,
[01:55:08] Jensen Huang: what I described to be our strategy doing their best.
[01:55:11] Jensen Huang: And if it's somehow wrong or not perfectly right, to tell me so that we could pivot.
[01:55:19] And the more vulnerable we are as a leader, the more able other people are able to tell
[01:55:25] Jensen Huang: you, you know, that's not exactly right or have you considered this information or, and
[01:55:32] Jensen Huang: the more vulnerable we are, the more able we're actually able to pivot.
[01:55:38] Jensen Huang: And we put ourselves into the superhuman capability, then it's hard for us to pivot strategy.
[01:55:43] Joe Rogan: Because we were supposed to be right all along.
[01:55:46] Jensen Huang: And so if you're always right, how can you possibly pivot?
[01:55:49] Jensen Huang: Because pivoting requires you to be wrong.
[01:55:51] And so I've got no trouble with being wrong.
[01:55:53] Jensen Huang: I just have to make sure that I stay alert, that I reason about things from first principles
[01:55:59] Jensen Huang: all the time, always break things down to first principles, understand why it's happening,
[01:56:05] Jensen Huang: assess continuously.
[01:56:08] Jensen Huang: The reassessing continuously is kind of partly what causes continuous anxiety.
[01:56:13] Jensen Huang: You know, because you're asking yourself, were you wrong yesterday?
[01:56:17] Jensen Huang: Are you still right?
[01:56:18] Jensen Huang: Is this the same?
[01:56:20] Jensen Huang: Has that changed?
[01:56:21] Has that condition?
[01:56:22] Jensen Huang: Is that worse than you thought?
[01:56:23] Jensen Huang: Because that mindset is perfect for your business though.
[01:56:27] Because this business is ever changing all the time.
[01:56:29] Joe Rogan: And there's competition coming from every direction.
[01:56:32] Joe Rogan: Not all much of it is kind of up in the air.
[01:56:36] And you have to invent a future where 100 variables are included.
[01:56:43] And there's no way you could be right on all of them.
[01:56:46] And so you have to be, you have to surf.
[01:56:49] Wow, that's a good way to put it.
[01:56:51] Joe Rogan: You have to surf.
[01:56:52] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:56:53] Joe Rogan: You're surfing waves of technology and innovation.
[01:56:55] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[01:56:56] You can't predict the waves.
[01:56:58] Jensen Huang: You got to deal with it once you have.
[01:57:00] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[01:57:01] Jensen Huang: But skill matters.
[01:57:03] And I've been doing this for 30, I'm the longest running
[01:57:05] Jensen Huang: tech CEO in the world.
[01:57:07] Jensen Huang: Is that true?
[01:57:07] Jensen Huang: Congratulations.
[01:57:08] Jensen Huang: That's amazing.
[01:57:10] Jensen Huang: And you know, people ask me how is one, don't get fired.
[01:57:13] Jensen Huang: I'll stop it short and I'll heartbeat.
[01:57:19] Jensen Huang: And then two, don't get bored.
[01:57:21] Mm.
[01:57:22] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[01:57:23] Joe Rogan: Well, how do you maintain your enthusiasm?
[01:57:25] Well, the honest truth is it's not always enthusiasm.
[01:57:31] Jensen Huang: It's sometimes is enthusiasm.
[01:57:34] Jensen Huang: Sometimes it's just good old fashioned fear.
[01:57:36] Jensen Huang: And then sometimes a healthy dose of frustration.
[01:57:41] Jensen Huang: It's whatever keeps you moving.
[01:57:43] Joe Rogan: Yeah, just all the emotions.
[01:57:45] Jensen Huang: Mm-hmm.
[01:57:46] Jensen Huang: I think CEOs, we have all the emotions, right?
[01:57:49] And so probably, probably jacked up to the maximum because you're
[01:57:55] Jensen Huang: kind of feeling on behalf of the whole company.
[01:57:58] I'm feeling on behalf of everybody at the same time.
[01:58:02] Jensen Huang: And it kind of encapsulates into somebody.
[01:58:06] Jensen Huang: And so I have to be mindful of the past.
[01:58:09] Jensen Huang: I have to be mindful of the present.
[01:58:10] Jensen Huang: I've got to be mindful of the future.
[01:58:12] Jensen Huang: And it's not without emotion.
[01:58:17] Jensen Huang: It's not just a job.
[01:58:20] Jensen Huang: Let's just put it that way.
[01:58:21] Jensen Huang: Mm.
[01:58:22] It doesn't seem like it at all.
[01:58:24] Joe Rogan: I would imagine one of the more difficult aspects of your job
[01:58:27] Joe Rogan: currently now that the company is massively successful
[01:58:31] Joe Rogan: is anticipating where technology is headed
[01:58:34] Joe Rogan: and where the applications are going to be.
[01:58:37] Jensen Huang: So how do you try to map that out?
[01:58:40] Yeah, there's a whole bunch of ways.
[01:58:45] Jensen Huang: And it takes a whole bunch of things.
[01:58:51] Jensen Huang: But let me just start.
[01:58:54] Jensen Huang: You have to be surrounded by amazing people.
[01:58:56] Jensen Huang: And Nvidia is now, if you look at the large tech companies
[01:59:03] Jensen Huang: in the world today, most of them have a business in advertising
[01:59:09] Jensen Huang: or social media or content distribution.
[01:59:14] Jensen Huang: And at the core of it is really fundamental computer
[01:59:18] Jensen Huang: signs.
[01:59:20] And so the company's business is not computers.
[01:59:23] Jensen Huang: The company's business is not technology.
[01:59:25] Jensen Huang: Technology drives the company.
[01:59:27] Jensen Huang: And Nvidia is the only company in the world that's large
[01:59:30] Jensen Huang: who's only business is technology.
[01:59:33] We only build technology.
[01:59:34] Jensen Huang: We don't advertise.
[01:59:35] Jensen Huang: The only way that we make money is to create amazing technology
[01:59:39] Jensen Huang: and sell it.
[01:59:40] And so to be that, to be Nvidia today,
[01:59:46] Jensen Huang: the number one thing is you're surrounded by the finest computer
[01:59:49] Jensen Huang: scientists in the world.
[01:59:51] Jensen Huang: And that's my gift.
[01:59:52] Jensen Huang: My gift is that we've created a company's culture,
[01:59:57] Jensen Huang: a condition by which the world's greatest computer scientists
[02:00:01] Jensen Huang: want to be part of it.
[02:00:02] Jensen Huang: Because they get to do their lives work
[02:00:04] Jensen Huang: and create the next thing.
[02:00:06] Jensen Huang: Because that's what they want to do.
[02:00:08] Because maybe they're not, they don't want to be in service
[02:00:12] Jensen Huang: of another business.
[02:00:13] Jensen Huang: They want to be in service of the technology itself.
[02:00:16] Jensen Huang: And we're the largest form of its kind in history of the world.
[02:00:19] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[02:00:20] I know.
[02:00:20] It's pretty amazing.
[02:00:21] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[02:00:22] Joe Rogan: And so one, we have a great condition.
[02:00:27] Jensen Huang: We have a great culture.
[02:00:28] Jensen Huang: We have great people.
[02:00:30] And now the question is, how do you systematically
[02:00:37] be able to see the future, stay alert of it,
[02:00:43] and reduce the likelihood of missing something or being
[02:00:51] Jensen Huang: wrong?
[02:00:53] And so there's a lot of different ways you could do that.
[02:00:54] Jensen Huang: For example, we have great partnerships.
[02:00:57] Jensen Huang: We have a fundamental research.
[02:00:58] Jensen Huang: We have a great research lab, one of the largest
[02:01:00] Jensen Huang: industrial research labs in the world today.
[02:01:03] Jensen Huang: And we partner with a whole bunch of universities
[02:01:05] Jensen Huang: and other scientists.
[02:01:07] Jensen Huang: We do a lot of open collaboration.
[02:01:09] Jensen Huang: And so I'm constantly working with researchers outside
[02:01:13] Jensen Huang: the company.
[02:01:15] Jensen Huang: We have the benefit of having amazing customers.
[02:01:19] Jensen Huang: And so I have the benefit of working with Elon and others
[02:01:22] Jensen Huang: in the industry.
[02:01:24] Jensen Huang: And we have the benefit of being the only pure play
[02:01:28] Jensen Huang: technology company that can serve consumer
[02:01:32] Jensen Huang: internet, industrial manufacturing, scientific computing,
[02:01:38] Jensen Huang: health care, financial services, all the industries that
[02:01:42] Jensen Huang: were in, they're all signals to me.
[02:01:45] And so they all have mathematicians and scientists.
[02:01:50] Jensen Huang: And so because I have the benefit now of a radar system,
[02:01:54] that is the most broad of any company in the world,
[02:01:57] working across every single industry,
[02:02:00] Jensen Huang: from agriculture to energy to video games.
[02:02:05] And so the ability for us to have this vantage point,
[02:02:10] one, doing fundamental research ourselves,
[02:02:13] and then two, working with all the great researchers,
[02:02:16] Jensen Huang: working with all the great industries.
[02:02:18] Jensen Huang: The feedback system is incredible.
[02:02:20] Jensen Huang: And then finally, you just have to have a culture
[02:02:23] Jensen Huang: of staying super alert.
[02:02:25] Jensen Huang: There's no easy way of being alert, except for paying attention.
[02:02:31] I haven't found a single way of being
[02:02:33] Jensen Huang: able to stay alert without paying attention.
[02:02:35] Jensen Huang: And so I probably read several thousand emails a day.
[02:02:39] Jensen Huang: How?
[02:02:43] Jensen Huang: How do you have the time for that?
[02:02:44] Jensen Huang: I wake up early this morning, I was up at four o'clock.
[02:02:47] Jensen Huang: How much do you sleep?
[02:02:50] Jensen Huang: 6, 7 hours?
[02:02:52] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:02:54] And then you're up at four, reading emails for a few hours.
[02:02:56] Joe Rogan: Before you get going.
[02:02:57] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[02:02:58] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:02:58] Joe Rogan: Wow.
[02:03:00] Every day.
[02:03:01] Joe Rogan: Every single day.
[02:03:02] Jensen Huang: Not one day missed.
[02:03:05] Including Thanksgiving Christmas.
[02:03:06] Jensen Huang: Do you ever take a vacation?
[02:03:10] Jensen Huang: Yeah, but they're, my definition of a vacation
[02:03:13] Jensen Huang: is when I'm with my family.
[02:03:15] Jensen Huang: And so if I'm with my family, I'm very happy.
[02:03:18] Jensen Huang: I don't care where we are.
[02:03:19] Jensen Huang: And you don't work then?
[02:03:20] Joe Rogan: Or do you work in a little?
[02:03:21] Joe Rogan: No, no, I work a lot.
[02:03:24] Even if you go on a trip somewhere,
[02:03:26] Joe Rogan: you're still working.
[02:03:27] Joe Rogan: Oh, sure.
[02:03:28] Jensen Huang: Oh, sure.
[02:03:29] Jensen Huang: Wow, every day.
[02:03:30] Jensen Huang: Every day.
[02:03:31] Jensen Huang: Well, my kids work every day.
[02:03:33] Jensen Huang: You make me tired just saying this.
[02:03:34] Jensen Huang: My kids work every day.
[02:03:38] Both of my kids work every day.
[02:03:39] Jensen Huang: They work every day.
[02:03:39] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[02:03:40] Jensen Huang: Yeah, I'm very lucky.
[02:03:42] Wow.
[02:03:43] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:03:43] Jensen Huang: It's brutal now because it's just me working every day.
[02:03:47] Jensen Huang: Now we have three people working every day.
[02:03:49] Jensen Huang: And they want to work with me every day.
[02:03:51] Jensen Huang: And so it's a lot of work.
[02:03:54] Well, you've obviously imparted that ethic into them.
[02:03:58] Joe Rogan: They work incredibly hard.
[02:03:59] Joe Rogan: I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:04:01] Jensen Huang: But my parents work incredibly hard.
[02:04:04] Yeah, I was born with the work gene, the suffering gene.
[02:04:09] Jensen Huang: Well, listen, man, it has paid off.
[02:04:13] Joe Rogan: What a crazy story.
[02:04:15] Joe Rogan: It was just, it's really an amazing origin story.
[02:04:18] It really, I mean, it has to be kind of surreal
[02:04:21] Joe Rogan: to be in the position that you're in now.
[02:04:23] Joe Rogan: When you look back at how many times
[02:04:25] Joe Rogan: that it could have fallen apart and humble beginnings.
[02:04:28] But Joe, this is a great country.
[02:04:30] Jensen Huang: And I'm an immigrant.
[02:04:32] Jensen Huang: My parents sent my older brother and I here first.
[02:04:37] Jensen Huang: We're in Thailand.
[02:04:40] I was born in Taiwan.
[02:04:41] Jensen Huang: But my dad had a job in Thailand.
[02:04:44] Jensen Huang: He was a chemical and instrumentation engineer,
[02:04:47] Jensen Huang: incredible engineer.
[02:04:50] Jensen Huang: And his job was to go start an oil refinery.
[02:04:53] Jensen Huang: And so we moved to Thailand, lived in Bangkok.
[02:04:56] Jensen Huang: And in 1973, 1974, time frame, you know,
[02:05:05] Thailand every so often, they would just have a coup.
[02:05:08] Jensen Huang: The military would have an uprising.
[02:05:11] Jensen Huang: And all of a sudden, one day, there
[02:05:13] Jensen Huang: were tanks and soldiers in the streets.
[02:05:15] Jensen Huang: And my parents thought, you know, probably
[02:05:17] Jensen Huang: isn't safe for the kids to be here.
[02:05:19] Jensen Huang: And so they contacted my uncle.
[02:05:22] Jensen Huang: My uncle lives in Tacoma, Washington.
[02:05:25] Jensen Huang: And we had never met him.
[02:05:28] Jensen Huang: And my parents sent us to him.
[02:05:30] Jensen Huang: How old were you?
[02:05:32] Jensen Huang: I was about to turn nine.
[02:05:34] Jensen Huang: And my older brother almost turned 11.
[02:05:38] Jensen Huang: And so the two of us came to United States.
[02:05:42] Jensen Huang: And we stayed with our uncle for a little bit
[02:05:45] Jensen Huang: while he looked for a school for us.
[02:05:49] Jensen Huang: And my parents didn't have very much money.
[02:05:52] Jensen Huang: And they never had been to United States.
[02:05:53] Jensen Huang: My father was, I'll tell you that story in a second.
[02:05:57] Jensen Huang: And so my uncle found a school that would accept foreign students
[02:06:07] Jensen Huang: and affordable enough for my parents.
[02:06:11] And that school turned out to have been in O'Neida, Kentucky,
[02:06:15] Jensen Huang: Clark County, Kentucky, the epicenter of the OPO crisis
[02:06:20] Jensen Huang: today, coal country.
[02:06:24] Clark County, Kentucky, was the poorest county in America
[02:06:30] Jensen Huang: when I showed up.
[02:06:32] Jensen Huang: It is the poorest county in America today.
[02:06:36] And so we went to the school.
[02:06:37] Jensen Huang: It's a great school.
[02:06:40] Jensen Huang: O'Neida Baptist Institute in a town of a few hundred.
[02:06:45] Jensen Huang: I think it was 600 at the time that we showed up.
[02:06:49] No traffic light.
[02:06:51] And I think a 600 today.
[02:06:54] Jensen Huang: It's kind of amazing feed, actually.
[02:06:59] The ability to hold your population for what
[02:07:02] it's 600 people is quite a magical thing.
[02:07:06] Jensen Huang: However, they did it.
[02:07:08] Jensen Huang: And so the school had a mission of being
[02:07:14] Jensen Huang: in open school for any children who'd like to come.
[02:07:20] And what that basically means is that if you're a trouble
[02:07:24] Jensen Huang: student, if you have a trouble family,
[02:07:29] Jensen Huang: if you're whatever your background,
[02:07:35] Jensen Huang: you're welcome to come to O'Neida Baptist Institute,
[02:07:39] Jensen Huang: including kids from international who
[02:07:42] Jensen Huang: would like to stay there.
[02:07:44] Did you speak English at the time?
[02:07:46] Jensen Huang: OK.
[02:07:46] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:07:48] Jensen Huang: OK.
[02:07:48] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:07:49] Jensen Huang: And so we showed up.
[02:07:57] My first thought was, gosh, there
[02:08:01] Jensen Huang: are a lot of cigarette butts on the ground.
[02:08:03] Jensen Huang: 100% of the kids smoked.
[02:08:09] So right away, you know this is not a normal school.
[02:08:11] Jensen Huang: Nine-year-old?
[02:08:12] Joe Rogan: No.
[02:08:12] Joe Rogan: I was the youngest kid.
[02:08:14] Jensen Huang: OK.
[02:08:14] Jensen Huang: 11-year-olds.
[02:08:15] Jensen Huang: My roommate was 17 years old.
[02:08:18] Wow.
[02:08:19] Jensen Huang: Yeah, he just turned 17.
[02:08:21] Jensen Huang: And he was jacked.
[02:08:23] And I don't know where he is now.
[02:08:30] Jensen Huang: I know his name, but I don't know where he is now.
[02:08:32] Jensen Huang: But anyways, that night, we got, and the second thing I noticed
[02:08:37] Jensen Huang: when you walk into your dorm room is there are no drawers
[02:08:43] Jensen Huang: and no closet doors, just like a prison.
[02:08:50] And there are no locks so that people can check up on you.
[02:08:58] Jensen Huang: And so I go into my room, and he's 17,
[02:09:02] Jensen Huang: and get ready for bed.
[02:09:06] Jensen Huang: And he had all this tape all over his body.
[02:09:10] Jensen Huang: And turned out he wasn't a knife fight.
[02:09:14] And he's been stabbed all over his body
[02:09:17] Jensen Huang: and these were just fresh ones.
[02:09:20] And the other kids were hurt much worse.
[02:09:24] And so he was my roommate, the toughest kid in school.
[02:09:28] Jensen Huang: And I was the youngest kid in school.
[02:09:30] Jensen Huang: It was a junior high.
[02:09:35] But they took me anyways.
[02:09:37] Jensen Huang: Because if I walked about a mile across the Kentucky
[02:09:41] Jensen Huang: River, the swing bridge, the other side
[02:09:45] Jensen Huang: is a middle school that I could go to.
[02:09:48] Jensen Huang: And then I can go to that school, and I come back,
[02:09:51] Jensen Huang: and then I stayed in the dorm.
[02:09:53] Jensen Huang: And so basically, O'Neill de Baptist Institute
[02:09:54] Jensen Huang: was my dorm when I went to this other school.
[02:09:58] Jensen Huang: My older brother went to the junior high.
[02:10:02] Jensen Huang: And so we were there for a couple of years.
[02:10:05] Jensen Huang: Every kid had chores.
[02:10:09] Jensen Huang: My older brother's chore was to work in the tobacco farm.
[02:10:13] Jensen Huang: So they raised tobacco so they could raise some extra money
[02:10:16] Jensen Huang: for the school, kind of like a penitentiary.
[02:10:20] Jensen Huang: And my job was just to clean the dorm.
[02:10:22] Jensen Huang: And so I was nine years old.
[02:10:25] Jensen Huang: I was cleaning toilets.
[02:10:26] Jensen Huang: And for a dorm of 100 boys, I cleaned more bathrooms
[02:10:34] Jensen Huang: than anybody.
[02:10:34] Jensen Huang: And I just wish everybody was a little bit more careful.
[02:10:37] Jensen Huang: I know.
[02:10:39] Jensen Huang: But anyways, I was the youngest kid in school.
[02:10:45] Jensen Huang: My memories of it was really good.
[02:10:48] Jensen Huang: But it was a tough town.
[02:10:50] Jensen Huang: Towns like.
[02:10:51] Joe Rogan: Town kids, they all carried.
[02:10:52] Jensen Huang: Everybody had knives.
[02:10:55] Jensen Huang: Everybody had knives.
[02:10:57] Jensen Huang: Everybody smoked.
[02:10:58] Jensen Huang: Everybody had a zip-o lighter.
[02:11:00] I smoked for a week.
[02:11:01] Jensen Huang: Did you?
[02:11:02] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:11:03] Jensen Huang: I was nine.
[02:11:04] Jensen Huang: Well, you're nine.
[02:11:05] Jensen Huang: You're nine.
[02:11:06] Joe Rogan: You tried smoking.
[02:11:07] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:11:08] Jensen Huang: I got myself a packet of cigarettes.
[02:11:09] Everybody else did.
[02:11:10] Did you get sick?
[02:11:11] Jensen Huang: No, I got used to it.
[02:11:13] Jensen Huang: And at learn how to blow smoke rings.
[02:11:19] Jensen Huang: You know, breathe out in my nose.
[02:11:21] Jensen Huang: Take it in my nose.
[02:11:22] Jensen Huang: There was a call.
[02:11:23] Jensen Huang: All the different things that you learned.
[02:11:25] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:11:26] At nine.
[02:11:27] Yeah.
[02:11:28] Joe Rogan: Why?
[02:11:29] Joe Rogan: You just did it to fit in or look cool.
[02:11:30] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:11:31] Joe Rogan: Because everybody else did it.
[02:11:32] Jensen Huang: Right.
[02:11:33] Jensen Huang: I did it for a couple of weeks, I guess.
[02:11:35] Jensen Huang: And I just, rather have, I had a quarter, you know, out of quarter a month or something
[02:11:42] Jensen Huang: like that.
[02:11:44] Jensen Huang: I just, rather, by popsicles and, if I just sickles with it, I was nine, you know?
[02:11:48] Jensen Huang: Right.
[02:11:49] Jensen Huang: I chose the, the better path.
[02:11:52] Wow.
[02:11:53] That was our school.
[02:11:54] Jensen Huang: And then my parents came to United States two years later.
[02:11:57] Jensen Huang: And we met them in Tacoma, Washington.
[02:12:01] It was wild.
[02:12:02] It was a really crazy experience.
[02:12:04] Jensen Huang: What a strange formative experience.
[02:12:07] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:12:08] Joe Rogan: Tough kids.
[02:12:10] Thailand to one of the poorest places in America, where if not the poorest, as a nine year old.
[02:12:19] Joe Rogan: Yeah, that's my first experience.
[02:12:20] First experience with your brother.
[02:12:21] Joe Rogan: Wow.
[02:12:22] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:12:23] Yeah.
[02:12:24] Jensen Huang: Now I used to, and what breaks my heart?
[02:12:27] Jensen Huang: Probably the only thing that really breaks my heart about that experience was, so we didn't
[02:12:37] have enough money to make, you know, international phone calls every week.
[02:12:42] And so my parents gave us this tape deck.
[02:12:45] Jensen Huang: This IWAT tape deck.
[02:12:48] And a tape.
[02:12:51] Jensen Huang: And so every month we would sit in front of that tape deck and that my older brother, Jeff
[02:12:56] Jensen Huang: and I, the two of us would just tell them what we did the whole month.
[02:13:05] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[02:13:06] And we would send that tape by mail.
[02:13:09] And my parents would take that tape and record back on top of it and send it back to us.
[02:13:17] Could you imagine it for two years?
[02:13:20] Wow.
[02:13:21] Jensen Huang: Is that tape still existed?
[02:13:23] Of these two kids just describing their first experience with United States.
[02:13:28] Jensen Huang: Like I remember telling my parents that I joined the swim team.
[02:13:36] Jensen Huang: And my roommate was really buff.
[02:13:41] Jensen Huang: And so every day we spent a lot of time in the gym.
[02:13:45] Jensen Huang: And so every night, 100 push ups, 100 sit ups, every day in the gym.
[02:13:50] Jensen Huang: So I was nine years old.
[02:13:51] Jensen Huang: I was getting, I was pretty buff.
[02:13:54] And I'm pretty fit.
[02:13:55] Jensen Huang: And so I joined the soccer team.
[02:14:00] Jensen Huang: I joined the swim team because if you join the team, they take you to meets.
[02:14:06] Jensen Huang: And then afterwards you get to go to a nice restaurant.
[02:14:09] Jensen Huang: And that nice restaurant was McDonald's.
[02:14:12] Jensen Huang: And I recorded this thing.
[02:14:15] Jensen Huang: I said, Mom and Dad, we went to the most amazing restaurant today.
[02:14:20] This whole place is lit up.
[02:14:22] Jensen Huang: It's like the future.
[02:14:24] And the food comes in a box.
[02:14:31] The food is incredible.
[02:14:32] Jensen Huang: The hamburger is incredible.
[02:14:33] Jensen Huang: It's McDonald's.
[02:14:35] Jensen Huang: But anyhow, it wouldn't be amazing.
[02:14:38] Jensen Huang: Oh my God.
[02:14:39] Jensen Huang: Two years.
[02:14:40] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:14:41] Jensen Huang: Two years.
[02:14:42] Yeah.
[02:14:43] Joe Rogan: What a crazy connection to your parents, too.
[02:14:45] Joe Rogan: Just sending a tape and sending you in back.
[02:14:48] Joe Rogan: And it's the only way you're communicating for two years.
[02:14:51] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:14:52] Wow.
[02:14:53] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:14:54] Jensen Huang: Now my parents are incredible, actually.
[02:14:56] Jensen Huang: They grew up really poor.
[02:15:01] Jensen Huang: And when they came to United States, they had almost no money.
[02:15:06] Jensen Huang: Probably one of the most impactful memories I have is they came and we were staying in
[02:15:13] Jensen Huang: a apartment complex.
[02:15:16] Jensen Huang: And they had just rent back in the, I guess, people still do rent a bunch of furniture.
[02:15:29] And we were messing around.
[02:15:36] And we bumped into the coffee table and crushed it.
[02:15:41] It was made out of particle wood.
[02:15:43] Jensen Huang: We crushed it.
[02:15:46] And I just still remember the look of my mom's face, you know, because they didn't have
[02:15:51] Jensen Huang: any money and she didn't know how she was going to pay it back.
[02:15:55] Jensen Huang: But anyhow, that kind of tells you how hard it was for them to come here.
[02:15:59] Jensen Huang: But they left everything behind and all they had was their suitcase and the money they
[02:16:04] Jensen Huang: had in their pocket.
[02:16:06] Jensen Huang: And they came to United States.
[02:16:07] Jensen Huang: How old were you?
[02:16:08] Jensen Huang: They pursued the arm, brink of dream.
[02:16:09] Jensen Huang: They were in their 40s.
[02:16:10] Jensen Huang: Wow.
[02:16:11] Jensen Huang: Yeah, late 30s.
[02:16:12] Jensen Huang: Pursuit the American dream.
[02:16:14] Jensen Huang: This is the American dream.
[02:16:17] Jensen Huang: I'm the first generation of the American dream.
[02:16:19] Wow.
[02:16:20] Yeah, it's hard not to love this country.
[02:16:23] Jensen Huang: It's hard not to be romantic about this country.
[02:16:26] Joe Rogan: That is a romantic story.
[02:16:27] Joe Rogan: That's an amazing story.
[02:16:29] Yeah.
[02:16:30] Jensen Huang: And my dad found his job literally in the newspaper, you know, the ads and he calls people,
[02:16:38] Jensen Huang: got a job.
[02:16:39] Jensen Huang: What did he do?
[02:16:40] Jensen Huang: He was a consulting engineer and a consulting firm.
[02:16:44] Jensen Huang: And they helped people build oil refineries, paper mills and fabs.
[02:16:50] Jensen Huang: And that's what he did.
[02:16:51] Jensen Huang: He was a really good at factory design, instrumentation engineer.
[02:16:57] Jensen Huang: And so he's brilliant at that.
[02:17:00] Jensen Huang: And so he did that.
[02:17:02] Jensen Huang: And my mom worked as a maid and they found a way to raise us.
[02:17:08] Wow.
[02:17:10] That's an incredible story, Johnson.
[02:17:12] Joe Rogan: It really is.
[02:17:13] Joe Rogan: Everything, all of it.
[02:17:14] Joe Rogan: From your childhood to the perils in video, almost falling.
[02:17:20] Joe Rogan: It's really incredible, man.
[02:17:23] Jensen Huang: It's a great story.
[02:17:24] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:17:25] Joe Rogan: I've lived a great life.
[02:17:26] Joe Rogan: You really have.
[02:17:27] Joe Rogan: And it's a great story for other people to hear too.
[02:17:29] Joe Rogan: It really is.
[02:17:30] Joe Rogan: You don't have to go to Ivy League schools to succeed.
[02:17:36] This country creates opportunities.
[02:17:38] Jensen Huang: Has opportunities for all of us.
[02:17:40] Jensen Huang: You do have to strive.
[02:17:43] You have to claw your way here.
[02:17:46] But if you put in the work, you can succeed.
[02:17:49] Joe Rogan: Nobody works hard.
[02:17:50] Joe Rogan: There's a lot of luck and a lot of good decision making.
[02:17:54] Jensen Huang: And the good graces of others.
[02:17:55] Jensen Huang: Yes.
[02:17:56] That's really important.
[02:17:57] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:17:58] Jensen Huang: You and I spoke about two people who are very dear to me.
[02:18:01] Jensen Huang: But the list goes on.
[02:18:04] Jensen Huang: The people that I've been in video who have helped me, many friends that are on the board,
[02:18:13] Jensen Huang: the decisions, them giving me the opportunity.
[02:18:16] Jensen Huang: When we were inventing this new computing approach, I tanked our stock price because we
[02:18:22] Jensen Huang: added this thing called Kuda to the chip.
[02:18:24] Jensen Huang: We had this big idea.
[02:18:25] Jensen Huang: We added this thing called Kuda to the chip.
[02:18:27] Jensen Huang: But nobody paid for it.
[02:18:29] Jensen Huang: But our cost doubled.
[02:18:31] Jensen Huang: And so we had this graphics chip company.
[02:18:34] And we invented GPUs.
[02:18:36] Jensen Huang: We invented programmable shaders.
[02:18:38] Jensen Huang: We invented everything modern computer graphics.
[02:18:42] We invented real-time ray tracing.
[02:18:44] Jensen Huang: That's why it went from GTX to RTX.
[02:18:48] We invented all this stuff.
[02:18:49] Jensen Huang: But every time we invented something, the market doesn't know how to appreciate it,
[02:18:55] Jensen Huang: but the costs went way up.
[02:18:57] Jensen Huang: And in the case of Kuda that enabled AI.
[02:19:00] The cost increased a lot.
[02:19:03] Jensen Huang: But we really believed it.
[02:19:06] Jensen Huang: And so if you believe in that future and you don't do anything about it, you're going
[02:19:10] Jensen Huang: to regret it for your life.
[02:19:13] And so I always tell the team, do you believe this or not?
[02:19:18] Jensen Huang: And if you believe it, and so grounded on first principles, not random, here say.
[02:19:24] And we believe it.
[02:19:26] Jensen Huang: We owe it to ourselves to go pursue it.
[02:19:28] We're the right people to go do it.
[02:19:30] Jensen Huang: If it's really, really hard to do, it's worth doing.
[02:19:33] Jensen Huang: And we believe it.
[02:19:34] Jensen Huang: Let's go pursue it.
[02:19:36] While we pursued it, we launched the product.
[02:19:39] Jensen Huang: Nobody knew it was exactly what, like when I launched GTX1 and the entire audience was
[02:19:44] Jensen Huang: like complete silence.
[02:19:47] When I launched Kuda, the audience was complete silence.
[02:19:51] Jensen Huang: No customer wanted it.
[02:19:54] Jensen Huang: Nobody asked for it.
[02:19:56] Jensen Huang: We understood it.
[02:19:57] Jensen Huang: And video was a public company.
[02:19:59] Jensen Huang: What yours is?
[02:20:00] Jensen Huang: This is a, let's see, 2000 and 2006, 20 years ago.
[02:20:09] 2005?
[02:20:12] Wow.
[02:20:14] Our stock prices went phew.
[02:20:18] I think our valuation went down to like two or three billion dollars from about 12 or
[02:20:25] Jensen Huang: something like that.
[02:20:28] I crushed it in a very bad way.
[02:20:32] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:20:33] Jensen Huang: What is it now though?
[02:20:34] Joe Rogan: Yeah, it's higher.
[02:20:35] Joe Rogan: It's very unbelievable.
[02:20:36] Jensen Huang: It's higher.
[02:20:37] Joe Rogan: But it changed the world.
[02:20:39] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:20:40] That invention changed the world.
[02:20:45] It's incredible story, Johnson.
[02:20:48] Joe Rogan: It really is.
[02:20:50] Thank you.
[02:20:51] Joe Rogan: Like your story, it's incredible.
[02:20:53] Joe Rogan: My story is not as incredible.
[02:20:54] Joe Rogan: My story is more weird.
[02:20:57] You know, it's much more fortuitous and weird.
[02:21:01] Joe Rogan: Okay.
[02:21:02] Jensen Huang: What are the three milestones that most important milestones that led to here?
[02:21:11] Joe Rogan: That's a good question.
[02:21:12] Joe Rogan: What was step one?
[02:21:13] Joe Rogan: I think step one was seeing other people do it.
[02:21:18] Step one was in the initial days of podcasting.
[02:21:21] Joe Rogan: Like in 2009 when I started podcasting and only been around for a couple of years.
[02:21:28] Joe Rogan: The first was Adam Curry, my good friend who was the pod father.
[02:21:32] Joe Rogan: He invented podcasting.
[02:21:34] Joe Rogan: And then, you know, I remember Adam Corolla had a show because he had a radio show.
[02:21:39] Joe Rogan: His radio show got canceled.
[02:21:41] And so he decided to just do the same show but do it on the internet.
[02:21:43] Joe Rogan: And that was pretty revolutionary.
[02:21:44] Joe Rogan: Nobody was doing that.
[02:21:46] Joe Rogan: And then there was the experience that I had had doing different morning radio shows.
[02:21:51] Joe Rogan: Like Opie and Anthony in particular because it was fun.
[02:21:55] Joe Rogan: And we would just get together with a bunch of comedians.
[02:21:58] Joe Rogan: You know, I'd be on the show with like three or four other guys that I knew.
[02:22:01] Joe Rogan: And it was always just looked forward to it.
[02:22:03] Joe Rogan: It was just such a good time.
[02:22:06] Joe Rogan: And I said, God, I'm just doing that.
[02:22:07] Joe Rogan: It's so fun to do that.
[02:22:08] Joe Rogan: I wish I could do something like that.
[02:22:10] Joe Rogan: And then I saw Tom Green set up.
[02:22:12] Joe Rogan: Tom Green had a set up in his house.
[02:22:14] Joe Rogan: And he essentially turned his entire house into a television studio.
[02:22:18] Joe Rogan: And he did an internet show from his living room.
[02:22:21] Joe Rogan: He had servers in his house and cables everywhere.
[02:22:23] Joe Rogan: He had a step over cables.
[02:22:24] Joe Rogan: This is like 2007.
[02:22:25] Joe Rogan: I'm like, Tom, this is nuts.
[02:22:27] Joe Rogan: Like this is...
[02:22:28] Joe Rogan: And I'm like, you got to figure out a way to make money from this.
[02:22:30] Joe Rogan: I wish everybody...
[02:22:31] Joe Rogan: I wish everybody in internet could see your set up.
[02:22:34] Jensen Huang: It's nuts.
[02:22:35] Jensen Huang: I just want to let you guys know that.
[02:22:37] It's not just this.
[02:22:39] Joe Rogan: So that was the beginning of it.
[02:22:41] Joe Rogan: It was just seeing other people do it.
[02:22:43] Joe Rogan: And then saying, all right, let's just try it.
[02:22:44] Joe Rogan: And then so the beginning days, we just did it on a laptop.
[02:22:48] Joe Rogan: We got a laptop with a webcam and just messed around.
[02:22:51] Joe Rogan: Had a bunch of comedians come in.
[02:22:52] Joe Rogan: We were just talking, joke around.
[02:22:55] Joe Rogan: And I did it like once a week.
[02:22:56] Joe Rogan: And then I started doing it twice a week.
[02:22:58] Joe Rogan: And then all of a sudden I was doing it for a year.
[02:23:00] Joe Rogan: And then I was doing it for two years.
[02:23:02] Joe Rogan: And then I was like, oh, it's starting to get a lot of viewers.
[02:23:05] Joe Rogan: A lot of listeners.
[02:23:06] Joe Rogan: And then I just kept doing it.
[02:23:09] Joe Rogan: It's all it is.
[02:23:10] Joe Rogan: I just kept doing it because I enjoyed doing it.
[02:23:13] Joe Rogan: Was there any setback?
[02:23:14] Joe Rogan: No.
[02:23:15] No, there's never really a setback.
[02:23:17] Joe Rogan: Really?
[02:23:18] Joe Rogan: No, it must have been.
[02:23:19] Joe Rogan: Or you saw the same guy going, you're just resilient.
[02:23:21] Jensen Huang: Or you're just tough.
[02:23:23] Joe Rogan: No, no, no, no.
[02:23:24] Joe Rogan: Wasn't tough or hard.
[02:23:26] Joe Rogan: It was just interesting.
[02:23:27] Joe Rogan: So I just, the whole.
[02:23:29] Joe Rogan: You were never once punched in the face.
[02:23:30] Joe Rogan: No, not in the show.
[02:23:31] Joe Rogan: No, not really.
[02:23:32] Joe Rogan: Not doing the show.
[02:23:33] Joe Rogan: You never did something that big blowback.
[02:23:38] Joe Rogan: Nope.
[02:23:39] Not really.
[02:23:41] No, it all just kept growing.
[02:23:43] Joe Rogan: It kept growing.
[02:23:44] Joe Rogan: And the things stayed the same from the beginning to now.
[02:23:47] Joe Rogan: And the thing is, I enjoy talking to people.
[02:23:50] Joe Rogan: I've always enjoyed talking to interest people.
[02:23:52] Joe Rogan: I could even tell just when we walked in, the way you
[02:23:54] Jensen Huang: interacted with everybody, not just me.
[02:23:57] Yeah.
[02:23:57] That's cool.
[02:23:58] Jensen Huang: People cool.
[02:23:59] Jensen Huang: Yeah, that's cool.
[02:24:00] Jensen Huang: You know, I, it's an amazing gift to be
[02:24:05] Joe Rogan: able to have so many conversations with so many interesting
[02:24:07] Joe Rogan: people because if it changes the way you see the world,
[02:24:10] Joe Rogan: because you see the world through so many different people's
[02:24:13] Joe Rogan: eyes.
[02:24:14] Joe Rogan: And you have so many different people
[02:24:15] Joe Rogan: of different perspectives and different opinions and different
[02:24:18] Joe Rogan: philosophies and different life stories.
[02:24:21] Joe Rogan: And you know, it's an incredibly enriching and educating
[02:24:26] Joe Rogan: experience, having so many conversations
[02:24:30] Joe Rogan: with so many amazing people.
[02:24:32] And that's all I started doing.
[02:24:35] Joe Rogan: And that's all I do now.
[02:24:37] Joe Rogan: Even now, when I book the show, I do it on my phone.
[02:24:40] Joe Rogan: And I basically go through this giant list of emails
[02:24:44] Joe Rogan: of all the people that want to be on the show or the
[02:24:46] Joe Rogan: requested to be on the show.
[02:24:48] Joe Rogan: And then a factor in another list that I have of people that I
[02:24:51] Joe Rogan: would like to get on the show that I'm interested in.
[02:24:53] Joe Rogan: And I just map it out.
[02:24:55] Joe Rogan: And that's it.
[02:24:56] Joe Rogan: And I go, oh, I'd like to talk to him.
[02:24:57] Joe Rogan: If it wasn't because of President Trump, I wouldn't have
[02:24:59] Jensen Huang: been bumped up on that list.
[02:25:01] Yeah, I wanted to talk to you already.
[02:25:03] Joe Rogan: I just think, you know, what you're doing is very fascinating.
[02:25:07] Joe Rogan: I mean, how would I not want to talk to you?
[02:25:08] Joe Rogan: And then today, you proved to be absolutely the right
[02:25:11] Joe Rogan: decision.
[02:25:12] Joe Rogan: Well, you know, listen, it's strange to be an immigrant one
[02:25:16] Jensen Huang: day going to O'Neill Baptist Institute with the students
[02:25:22] Jensen Huang: that were there.
[02:25:24] Jensen Huang: And then here, Nvidia is one of the most consequential
[02:25:28] Jensen Huang: companies in the history of companies.
[02:25:32] Jensen Huang: It is a crazy story.
[02:25:34] Jensen Huang: It has to be a crazier story.
[02:25:35] Jensen Huang: Yeah, that journey is.
[02:25:37] Jensen Huang: And it's very humbling.
[02:25:39] Jensen Huang: And I'm very grateful.
[02:25:41] Jensen Huang: It's pretty amazing.
[02:25:42] Jensen Huang: Surrounded by amazing people.
[02:25:44] You're very fortunate.
[02:25:45] Joe Rogan: And you've also, you seem very happy.
[02:25:47] Joe Rogan: And you seem like you're 100% on the right path in this life.
[02:25:50] Joe Rogan: You know, you, you know, everybody says, you must love your job.
[02:25:54] Jensen Huang: Not every day.
[02:25:56] Joe Rogan: That's not hot.
[02:25:57] Joe Rogan: That's the sort of beauty of everything.
[02:25:59] Joe Rogan: Yeah.
[02:26:00] Joe Rogan: Because there's ups and downs.
[02:26:01] Joe Rogan: That's right.
[02:26:01] Joe Rogan: It's never just like this giant dopamine high.
[02:26:03] Joe Rogan: We leave, we leave this impression.
[02:26:06] Here's, here's an impression I don't think is healthy.
[02:26:08] Jensen Huang: We, people who are successful leave the impression often
[02:26:13] Jensen Huang: that that our job gives us great joy.
[02:26:19] Jensen Huang: I think largely it does.
[02:26:22] Jensen Huang: That our jobs were passionate about our work.
[02:26:27] And that passion relates to, it's just so much fun.
[02:26:32] I think it largely is.
[02:26:34] But it, it, it distracts from.
[02:26:37] Jensen Huang: In fact, a lot of success comes from really, really hard work.
[02:26:42] Jensen Huang: Yes.
[02:26:43] There's long periods of suffering and loneliness and uncertainty
[02:26:51] Jensen Huang: and fear and embarrassment and humiliation.
[02:26:56] Jensen Huang: All of the feelings that we most not love,
[02:27:02] Jensen Huang: that creating something from the ground up
[02:27:06] Jensen Huang: and, and Elon will tell you something similar.
[02:27:09] Very difficult to invent, invent something new.
[02:27:12] Jensen Huang: And people, people don't believe you all the time.
[02:27:15] Jensen Huang: You're humiliated often, disbelieved, most of the time.
[02:27:20] And so, so people forget that part of success.
[02:27:24] Jensen Huang: And, and I, I don't think it's health.
[02:27:26] Jensen Huang: I think it's, it's good that we pass that forward
[02:27:29] Jensen Huang: and let people know that, that it's just part of the journey.
[02:27:32] Jensen Huang: Yes.
[02:27:33] Joe Rogan: And then, it's suffering as part of the journey.
[02:27:35] Joe Rogan: You will appreciate it.
[02:27:36] Joe Rogan: It's so much, these horrible feelings that you have
[02:27:38] Joe Rogan: when things are not going so well.
[02:27:40] Joe Rogan: You will appreciate it so much more when they do go well.
[02:27:43] Joe Rogan: Deeply grateful.
[02:27:44] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:27:45] Jensen Huang: Yeah.
[02:27:45] Jensen Huang: Deep, deep pride.
[02:27:47] Jensen Huang: Incredible pride.
[02:27:49] Jensen Huang: Incredible, incredible gratefulness.
[02:27:51] Jensen Huang: And, and, and surely incredible memories.
[02:27:54] Absolutely.
