[00:00:00] What really happened in 1929 and why does it still matter?
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_01: Nearly a century after the most devastating crash
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_01: in American history,
[00:00:08] Dealbook founder, New York Times reporter in CNBC,
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_01: host Andrew Ross-Sorkin,
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_01: has unearthed the human story behind it,
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_01: the ambition, the greed,
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_01: the blind faith that the boom would never end.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_01: In his new book, 1929,
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_01: Sorkin shows how that era's delusion still echoes today
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_01: in our markets, our tech obsessions,
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_01: even our politics.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_01: We're gonna be talking about what history can teach us
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_01: about capitalism risk and our endless belief
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_01: that this time it will be different.
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_01: Andrew, I'm so happy to see you.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_01: Thank you for having me.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_00: I'm so excited to do this with you.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_00: I first of all, you know, when I saw this book,
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_01: I heard about this book and then I actually
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_01: put the book on my scale.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: I thought, how the hell did you find time to write this?
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: You are the busiest human being on the planet.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: You do squat box on CNBC every morning.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_01: You write fantastic articles for the New York Times.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_01: You do Dealbook, a newsletter.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_01: You do the Dealbook live event.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: What the hell?
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_00: It took me eight years.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_00: That's the answer.
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_00: I don't play golf.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_00: I don't do other things.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_00: I do have three children.
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: I know you do.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_00: Who are so happy that this book is over by the way.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_00: But I would do this on airplanes on weekends at nights.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_00: I would be sneaking little time in at any moment
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: I possibly could.
[00:01:31] So what was it about 1929, Andrew?
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: I mean, you have a choice to write
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_01: about so many different interesting moments in history
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: and what's happening today, too, because the world
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: is just exploding.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_01: So how did you decide, gosh, I really
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_01: want to write about this one specific year.
[00:01:50] So I'm always chasing interesting,
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: which oftentimes means chasing failure.
[00:01:56] And no, because I oftentimes think
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_00: that's where the most drama is.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_00: It's where the most interesting characters are.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_00: It's where we can try to understand things that we do well
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: and things where we may need to do better.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_00: And I had written this book Too Big to Fail in 2008
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: about the financial crisis then.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: And people used to ask me about 1929 and say,
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: how does 2008 compare to 1929?
[00:02:21] And I always be like, I don't know.
[00:02:24] I think like most Americans, we knew something very terrible
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_00: happened in 1929.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: We all sort of have a vague notion that the great depression
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: happened then, the stock market fell.
[00:02:35] But I didn't know who the people were, what they were saying
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: to each other, what their motivations were, what their
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: incentives were, who's sleeping with who, what's going on
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_00: here.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: I really wanted to know these things.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: And so I went on vacation, actually, with my wife,
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_00: like a real nerd.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_00: And I brought all these books with me about different
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_00: characters, 1929, and they were all written in the 1930s,
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: 40s, when most famous books were written in the 50s,
[00:03:00] mostly like economists, sort of talking about them in
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_00: sort of economic terms and structures and charts and
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: all of these things.
[00:03:07] And I sort of walked away saying, there's got to be more
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: chivis.
[00:03:12] More human drama, right?
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: More human drama.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: Look, the books that I always loved were things like,
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: you know, den of thieves or barbarians at the gate.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_00: These were sort of these great dramas about business where
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_00: you felt like you're watching a movie.
[00:03:26] And I thought, I wonder if I could do that.
[00:03:30] And I happened to be at Harvard University giving us speech.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_00: And I got there early, which you know me well enough to
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_00: know I am never anywhere early.
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_00: And I get to the library.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_00: So I have this extra time.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: I walk into the library there, a Baker library.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: And I say to the archivist, I'll
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: kind of look at these boxes you have from the late 20s,
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: early 30s.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_00: And there was a guy named Thomas Lamont, who was running
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_00: JP Morgan then.
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_00: And his family had donated all of his papers, his letters, his
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_00: diaries and all the things.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: And I open up this box and there are these transcripts in
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_00: the box of his conversations.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: His secretary would keep these transcripts of him
[00:04:10] conversing with Roosevelt and Hoover.
[00:04:14] And it would literally be, you know, it was a transcript.
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_00: So he would say what he said and what the president said.
[00:04:21] And I thought, wow, I hadn't read this in any of the books.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_00: And they're talking about all the things that are actually
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: happening.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, not to bring this to today, these
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_00: conversations are like the conversations that all these
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: CEOs are now having with Trump.
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: And we're going to talk about the parallel.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_01: And I'm thinking to myself, oh my goodness, OK, could I
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: take that kind of material and do this writ large?
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: Now the truth is the archivist said to me that she'd
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: read to Big Fell and she said, you're not going to do this
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_00: book.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: This can't, it doesn't exist because the material is not there.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: It's there for this guy.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: But the other people, it's not that you're going to struggle.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_00: And you took that as a challenge.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: I took that as I didn't want to believe her.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: Now she published.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: She was partially right.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_00: And it wasn't that she was right.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_00: It was that I think most historians sort of find two or
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_00: three or four archives and then they excavate the archive.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: And they really just go deeply archive.
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_00: The challenge in this case was there really wasn't like one or
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: two or three places you could go.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_00: It was you had to be like needle in a haystack situation
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_00: with 15, 20, 30 different places.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: And you don't almost have to guess.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_00: You don't almost have to say, OK, well, my character doesn't.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_00: I don't have an archive for this character.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: But he might have called somebody or talked someone
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: after, well, who are the 12 people he might have talked to.
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: OK, I'm now going to go to their archives and then pray to God
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: that I'm going to find some letter there.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: And sometimes you would.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: And sometimes you wouldn't.
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_00: Tracking all this stuff down sounds like it was more than a
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_01: full-time job.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_01: And I know that you enlisted these grad students during COVID.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_01: So talk about, honestly, just thinking about how overwhelming
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_01: this task was, how you were able to track all this stuff down.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_01: Well, so one of the things I did, and this was sort of a
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_00: maybe the mother of invention during COVID, I had been going to
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_00: log these libraries.
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_00: I had had a researcher who I'd worked with early on and was
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_00: planning to spend the time in the stacks.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_00: And I ultimately did, by the way, spend extraordinary amount of
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_00: time, if you too much time in the stacks.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_00: But during COVID, you weren't allowed in.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: So I would call, we would call the librarians and say, is there
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_00: any student who's allowed in the library?
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes they had a dissertation or a thesis that was
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_00: due.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_00: And so they were allowed, those like very select students
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: were allowed in.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: And so I would then pay the students.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: How did you find them, by the way?
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_01: The librarian would usually say, well, I'll give you some
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: emails of some people.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: It's like a co-operation.
[00:06:49] Yeah.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_01: And then you'd pay them, and then you'd say, I want you to take
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: a picture, I want you to find box 152, or whatever it is.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: And I need you to take a picture of every page in 152.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: We'll set up these sort of elaborate drop box folders.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: And then you'd read it.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: It was a very tedious process.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: But it was actually quite helpful, I have to say.
[00:07:10] I mean, how many grad students did you work with?
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_01: And I hope you acknowledge them in the book, did you?
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_00: A bunch of them I do.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: A handful.
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_00: Only a handful.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: And then the truth is that after the pandemic was over,
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_00: I oftentimes found myself back at a lot of the same libraries.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: Because one of the things I really did learn was you almost
[00:07:30] felt like you needed to see everything,
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_00: because you were worried that something was missed.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_00: Maybe there was a box that you didn't know to look in.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_00: Certain boxes are in.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_00: I didn't know about all this history stuff.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: Some boxes are indexed, so people know what's in them.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: Some boxes have no, there's nobody knows what's in them.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: And sometimes people as a result don't even look.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_00: And that's where the great sort of needle
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: on a haystack situation comes into play.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: Because sometimes you'll land on something go, ah,
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: that's amazing.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: Now I understand the eight-year process.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_01: So you amass all this original research and true.
[00:08:03] And you read it, you learn about all these specific characters.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: And you write this tome about the year.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_01: And I'm curious, as you read and sifted through all these stories,
[00:08:20] what was the theme?
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_01: Like what surfaced that made you think
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_01: this would make such a compelling story?
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_01: And what was that story?
[00:08:32] I think the animating idea for me was,
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: ah, the people themselves, sort of the human condition
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: and what was happening in the 1920s was just so fascinating to me
[00:08:45] in that this was like a boom, like nothing we've ever seen.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: And maybe it's a boom like today we're having with AI or something.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_00: But it was like a generational shift in the whole country.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_00: So prior to 1919, nobody ever took credit.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: Nobody borrowed money.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_00: It was considered a moral sin in America to borrow money.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_00: Like you would just wouldn't do that.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: General Motors started doing that actually
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_00: to help them sell more cars.
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_00: And then Sears Robuck clucked what was happening and said,
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_00: OK, we should do that for appliances.
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_00: And then a guy named Charlie Mitchell, who
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: ran a bank called National City, which later on become a city group,
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_00: which you know now, said, OK, well, we can do this too.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_00: And we're going to lend people money so that they can buy stocks.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_00: And there was this explosion.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: And all these people became celebrities, business people, CEOs, all of this.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_00: This was the celebrity.
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_00: All the things that are happening now, you know, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Jamie Diamond,
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: that like really started in the 1920s.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_00: And it was all because of credit.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_01: And it was all because of credit, because all of a sudden everybody could gamble.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_00: And brokerage houses start emerging on the corners of streets
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_00: like the way they're Starbucks today.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: I mean, they're just everywhere.
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_00: And you could go in and you could literally give them a dollar.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_00: If you put down a dollar, they would give you.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_00: They would lend you $10.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: So as the market's going up, and by the way, when I say the market's going up,
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_00: it's not like going up 10% a year.
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: In 1928 to the year before 1929, the market went up 48%.
[00:10:12] By September of 1929, the market was up 90%.
[00:10:18] So this was like free money.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: And people, you know, they feel wealthy.
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_00: They're running around.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: They're doing all of these crazy things.
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_00: And it was just so fascinating to see.
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to say greed, but I think that the human condition is to want more.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_00: Everybody wants more.
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_00: And people knew that this was getting out of hand.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't that nobody was saying, you know, this isn't crazy.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: There were Cassandra's in the room.
[00:10:43] But nobody really wanted to stop it.
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_00: The party was going.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: The drinks were flowing.
[00:10:50] You know what I mean?
[00:10:50] The wealth was growing.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: There's a great line.
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_00: It actually happened right before the financial crisis in 2008.
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_00: I got in Chuck Prince, who was actually the CEO of Citigroup, he said, you know, when
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_00: the music's playing, you have to dance.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_00: And these folks in the 1920s, they were dancing.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_00: And I thought that was so interesting to see all of those component parts.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_00: And then to see the mistakes that they were making along the way.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_00: And the story also goes, in many ways, actually beyond 1929.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: I mean, 1929 is sort of the pivotal domino.
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_00: The story really goes to the end of 1933, the summer of 1933.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: And I think that will also maybe change your impression of 1929.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_00: People think like there was some kind of great crash.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: The great depression happens.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_00: That's not really what happens.
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: It's like there's a series of crashes, actually.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_00: And then a series of terrible decisions that get made in Washington, oftentimes in conjunction
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_00: with the CEOs and bankers who are trying to influence the president, tell them crazy
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_00: things that really lead to what ultimately turns into the great depression.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_01: Before we talk about this moment, actually two moments in 1929, and then what happened
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_01: in those bad decisions, I'm fascinated by the roaring 20s, you know.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_01: And was this kind of, you know, environment or atmosphere where everybody was like going
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_01: crazy and living large?
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_01: Was that impacting everyone or only a certain segment of society?
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_01: It's a great question.
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_00: So the inequality was real in 1929.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: Very similar to now.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_00: But I do think all of this was sort of under the guise of democratizing finance.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: So you did have the quote, quote, ordinary American going into these effectively gambling
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_00: salons, otherwise known as brokerages, to try to participate in this dream.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_00: There was this almost lottery-like idea.
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: It was also, by the way, a real shift in what I even described as the American dream.
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: You know, prior to this period, people really did talk about the sort of Horatio Alger
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: story being the American dream.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_00: The sort of get-rich quick fantasy of capitalism or whatever, however you want to describe it.
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: That was a phenomenon of the 1920s.
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_00: So people really, and there was also a technological shift too happening.
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, here we are on a podcast with video, the hottest stock in the 1920s was
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_00: ticker symbol radio.
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_00: I knew you were going to say that.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_01: You say RCA.
[00:13:30] And that was like the Nvidia of its time or something.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_00: And everybody was going crazy because they thought this is going to change the world.
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_00: Just the way we thought the internet was to change the world.
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_00: Just the way we think AI is going to change the world.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_01: It's amazing how many similarities.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: And I do want to talk about that in a moment.
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_01: But first I want to hear about some of the characters that you really learn about and
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_01: that you profile and whose diaries you read, et cetera, and letters.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_01: So I think a lot of people think, oh, Hoover rose about maybe Carter Glass when they think
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_01: of this whole episode in American history.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_01: But let's talk about some of the others that are less known, but will be now because of
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_01: your book Thomas Lamont, managing partner at J.P. Morgan.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_01: Just tell us quickly about him.
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_00: So J.P. Morgan was considered like the most important bank in the country still was now
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_00: is now was then he really was the guy running the bank.
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_00: So the guy named Jack Morgan, the son of J.P. Morgan, J.P. Morgan, died at this point,
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: was ostensibly the CEO.
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_00: But Thomas Lamont was really the man who ran the bank.
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_00: And he was the ultimate sort of client guy.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_00: He believed that if you could just get a bunch of people in a room like the right people,
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_00: you could control the world.
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_00: And he would have dinner with Hitler and with Mussolini and with Roosevelt and with Hoover.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_00: This guy was just he was everywhere and everything.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_00: He was befriending all the journalists.
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_00: So he was.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_00: Schmoozer and chief.
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_01: Schmoozer and chief.
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_00: He was whispering in everybody's ears.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_00: This was that.
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_00: This was that guy.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: And the truth is he tried to control this thing, but it sort of got away from him.
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_00: So he did believe that somehow he could keep all this from bubbling over.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: And then October of 1929 comes around.
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_00: He gets the people in the room and doesn't work.
[00:15:17] I want to know what happened on that day.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_01: But first let me go through a couple more characters.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_01: Charles Sunshine, Charlie Mitchell, CEO of National City Bank.
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_01: You mentioned him earlier.
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_01: Charlie is my favorite character in the book.
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_00: And Charlie really did.
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: I feel like you know him, right?
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_01: I feel like I know Charlie.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_00: Charlie ran, as I said, the bank that becomes city group.
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_00: He was the Jamie Diamond of his time.
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_00: And he was as famous as Jamie Diamond Runch, JP Morgan today,
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_00: but he's probably the most famous banker in America in the world.
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_00: He invented the idea.
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_00: He was the one who said, OK, we should lend money to folks to buy stock.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: He was called Sunshine, Charlie, because he would tell anybody who would listen to him
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: that everything was always going to be better.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_00: He always had a smile on his face at all times.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_00: That was sort of his job and his way.
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_00: And he gets, I don't want to give away what happens.
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_00: But he does something.
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_00: He does a little side deal at one point with his wife, who gets involved in this whole
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_00: thing.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_00: And let's just say that the police show up at his house at one point, and he gets handcuffed.
[00:16:24] We won't say what happens after that.
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't so sun shiny at that point.
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_01: At that point.
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_00: That happened in 1933.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_00: So it took a while for things to catch up to him.
[00:16:34] The other one is Jesse Livermore, poor Jesse Livermore, right?
[00:16:38] Poor Jesse Livermore.
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_00: So one of the other things that I mean, look, I know this probably sounds like a book
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_00: about the economy.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_00: It's kind of like a crazy drama.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: So Jesse Livermore is an emotionally tortured short seller.
[00:16:53] SPEAKER_00: There's somebody who bets against stock.
[00:16:55] And he was famous in the 20s for betting against stock and winning.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: He almost is basically out of business by 1928 and 29.
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_00: Because the stock market keeps going up and up and up, he's losing his shirt.
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: Because you can't bet stocks are going down during this period.
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_00: And he magically comes back and makes a crazy trade in the fall of 1929, walks away with
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_00: $100 plus million, which by the way, within a year or two, he had summarily lost again.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_00: He was sort of addicted.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_01: Addicted?
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_00: You might describe as like degenerate gambler of sorts.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: And I will give away the ending.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_00: He ultimately in 1941 walks into what was then the cloakroom at the Sherry Neverland
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_00: up on Fifth Avenue near the Apple Store.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_00: The Apple Store wasn't there back then.
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: And he shoots himself in the head and kills himself.
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_00: So there's actually a number of suicides that take place during this whole period.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_00: A bunch of people who jump out of windows.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: So I think that people who don't know that much about the crash, I think that's what they
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_01: always think of.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_01: People jumping out of windows, people losing their wealth in a matter of minutes, right?
[00:18:12] So my grandfather, Sydney Sorkin, who's no longer alive with so many, he was 91 years
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_00: old, he was down there in October of 1929.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_00: His brother was a messenger boy.
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_00: And he was, I think he was 11.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: He went with his older brother down there.
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_00: And he used to tell us a story about how he saw somebody jump out of a window in October
[00:18:30] of 1929.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_00: Wow.
[00:18:32] And he never in his whole 91 years bought a share of stock in the stock market.
[00:18:38] Interesting.
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_00: It was a generationally scarring event for him.
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_00: I think he bought bonds.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_00: Maybe he had some mutual funds, I don't know.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_00: But stock, like individuals say, he always thought the stock market was like this place for
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_00: gamblers because of this sort of formable experience he had.
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_00: But I think a lot of Americans had that.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: Interesting lead.
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_00: My dad too, by the way, you know, when I was starting to make some money and TV news,
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_01: my dad was always like munibons.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_01: He really, he really wanted something super safe and secure.
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_01: And thinking about that, my dad was born in 1920.
[00:19:14] So I think probably like your grandfather, he had the same scarring experience, even if
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_01: it was from afar, right?
[00:19:22] Now weirdly, I should note, just to be factual as journalists.
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: One of the more interesting things that I did learn is that actually from a data perspective
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_00: that were actually not more suicides in 1929 than there were the year before.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_00: Oh, why not?
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_01: So there's sort of this impression that, you know, that everybody's jumping out of the
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_00: window.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_01: No, but I guess because it was so dramatic that it has been overblown in retrospect, right?
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_01: That is interesting.
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_00: I think also in the moment, to the extent there were suicides, they were more dramatic.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_00: There were people shooting themselves in the head.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_00: They were jumping out of windows.
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_00: It was a little, and they were recovered in the newspapers constantly because oftentimes,
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: if you read the article about somebody committing suicide, it was also about how they had lost
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_00: their fortune or lost their money or had to mortgage their home.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_00: And maybe it was in a sort of truncated period of time, Andrew, you know?
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_01: So maybe there weren't more, but maybe it was in a limited time span.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_01: Get on that, will you?
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_01: I will.
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_01: The book opens with Charles Sunshine Charlie Mitchell, the CEO of National City Bank
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_01: Returning to his office at 55 Wall Street on October 28, 1929, hours after the market
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_01: had closed with a 13% drop.
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_01: What happens next?
[00:20:41] Well, Charlie finds out that while he was out of the office all day, he had joined the board
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_00: of the New York Fed.
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: While he was out of these emergency meetings that his trader had bought a whole ton of stock
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_00: in the bank itself, and they didn't have the money to buy the stock.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, you don't have companies buy their own stock.
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_00: So back then, companies did the same thing.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_00: The problem was that during these, especially these sort of crazy periods in October of
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: 29, the stock market, like if you looked at the board of the stock prices on the exchange
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_00: back then, they were oftentimes like two or three or four or five hours behind what was
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_00: actually happening in reality.
[00:21:29] And so people were buying stocks, not understanding what the prices were.
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_00: And so they effectively bought $30 plus million worth of their stock, and they couldn't afford
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_00: it, which put him in this position trying to figure out what am I going to do to try to
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_00: save the bank without anybody knowing that they had done this.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_00: This was, he all of a sudden has a sort of existential crisis.
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_00: And well, I don't know if I want to give a little bit of that.
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_00: Well, just give a little, just give a little bit.
[00:21:57] So, and people will still buy the book.
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_00: One of the things that he does is effectively he goes and decides he's going to put this
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_00: whole thing on his back.
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_00: He goes to JP Morgan to try to get them to get them alone.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_00: And for him to buy the stock off of the bank, because he didn't want anyone to know that
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_00: the bank would have otherwise been in trouble.
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_00: And that decision, which that sort of secret decision, turns into a sort of bigger problem
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_00: for him later, because he then tries to do some sort of taxiananigans with his wife,
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: let's just say, that leads to his arrest.
[00:22:37] So you, I know, say that I think when we imagine this crash, right, we think of a crash.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_01: You think one day, this is not really what it's like multiple days.
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_00: And you say it wasn't a moment.
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_01: It was relentless unraveling.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_01: Talk about that.
[00:22:54] Well, so the very strange thing is that despite the market going down, you know, 40, 50 percent
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_00: between September or end of September and November, by the end of the year, and this is
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_00: the part that most people probably would never even imagine, by the end of the year, the
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_00: stock market was only down 17 percent.
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_00: And so there was this sort of relief thing happening, except that all of these people
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_00: had lost their money in the process.
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_00: And I think the one thing to think that about with this stock market, which is just so different
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_00: than it is today, when the stock market goes down today, people say, oh, well, I bought
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_00: the stock at $50 and now the stock is $30, so I lost $20 to share.
[00:23:33] Not good.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_00: But what was happening is most people had borrowed all the money to buy the stock.
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_00: So it wasn't just that you lost the $20.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_00: It was that you owed the bank oftentimes like $100 because they, and so people are going
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_00: it to hawk.
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you know, there's a great little scene that I sort of landed on, but with Groucho
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_00: Marx, who by the, at that point was not actually famous or really that famous yet.
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_00: And he was out in Long Island.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_00: He was pretty conservative, according to his son, with his money, but he was spending
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_00: like all day long at this brokerage house in Long Island just following the tape.
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_00: Like constantly, that's what he did.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_00: It was like smoking a cigar, right?
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_01: Smoking cigars and following the tape.
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_00: And he, he actually was a very smart guy.
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_00: He was questioning his broker about whether he should buy RCA, why is RCA not giving out
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_00: dividends?
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_00: Well, they weren't giving out dividends because they don't have any cash.
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_00: But the brokers were like, this time is different.
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_00: If you don't do this, you're going to lose out.
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_00: Trust me.
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_00: I do it too.
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_00: We're all doing this.
[00:24:40] Well, he gets a call in October of 1929.
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_00: It says you got to get down here and you're going to have to pay off alone.
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_00: He ends up having to mortgage his own home to deal with it all.
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_00: And I think that that was sort of just a little microcosm of a story of what was happening
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_00: everywhere.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_00: Talk a little bit more about sort of the relentless unraveling, if you will, Andrew.
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_01: So you have, I mean, just give us a little timestamp of all these events.
[00:25:07] Well, I don't know how far we want to go.
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_00: I mean, most of the real action happens in October in terms of the market crash.
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_00: However, as I said, this is a series of dominoes.
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_00: So the country is sort of losing its shirt in late 1929.
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_00: Market starts actually coming back a little bit, but the economy is not really coming back.
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_00: And so there's a big question is, what is President Hoover going to do?
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_00: What's the government going to do?
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_00: Talk about bad decisions.
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_00: So President Hoover's Treasury Secretary then was a guy named Andrew Mellon, who you may
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_00: have heard of.
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_00: Andrew Mellon was a true capitalist.
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_00: His view was, if you trade and you lose, you lose.
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_00: You're not helping you.
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_00: We're not bailing you out.
[00:25:46] Screw you.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_00: Hoover had this sort of view that somehow the economy and the stock market were like separated,
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_00: that they weren't really connected to each other.
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_00: And this was almost like a psychological problem.
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_00: And that if you could just get the country over the sort of psychological problem that somehow
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_00: you'd be in a better place.
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_00: But he also wanted to raise taxes at that time, probably not the best decision.
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_00: He then decides to implement tariffs, again, what's happening in America today?
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_00: Tariffs.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_00: So he implements a 1930 something called the Smooth Halley Tariffs.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_00: A year later, global trade is down 60% back then.
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, same thing is now, a thousand economists had wrote an open letter to Hoover,
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_00: begging him not to do this.
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_00: But he had run on this because he wanted to get the farmers in the middle of the country
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_00: to vote for him and he wanted to make good on his promise.
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_00: So there were a series of these things, but of course by 1933, even before that, you
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_00: started to have what's called Hooverville's, were emerging.
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_00: These were like tentative camps, even including in DC.
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_00: Also in Central Park, there were tentative camps in Central Park literally blocks away from
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: Charles Mitchell's house.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_00: Charles Mitchell lived, you know New York very well, up on Fifth Avenue and 75th Street,
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_00: the French consulate.
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_00: That was his house.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: That's where he lived.
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_00: They lived in these like kings.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_00: They lived in these mansions.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_00: There were castles.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_00: And so Hooverville's were emerging.
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_00: And so you had this sort of, those were sort of the series of dominoes of things that really
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_00: I think put the country in a very, very tough place.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_00: It's amazing when you think about the culture of the 20s, obviously.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_01: And this I'm sure struck you time and time again as you're writing this book, Andrew.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_01: And what we're seeing today in terms of the economic climate sort of income inequality,
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_01: a laissez-faire regulatory policy mood, investors and innovators becoming celebrities.
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_01: And as I mentioned, widening inequality.
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_01: I mean, were you like holy shit?
[00:27:58] Yeah.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_01: I mean, we are right for something like this to happen.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_01: Or how did you square the similarities between these two people?
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_01: I should just say straight up, when I started the project, I didn't think that I was writing
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_00: about today.
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_00: Like that was not really the goal.
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, there's nowhere in the book, as you know, where I say, hey, like this
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_00: is like this.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_00: But as I'm writing the book, I would say this was in the last couple of years.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_00: I'd be like, oh, okay, the tariff thing is happening.
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_00: The tariff thing is happening.
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_00: This idea of democratizing finance is happening.
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_00: It's happening.
[00:28:30] We're going to take some of the guardrails and rules away.
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_00: And you realize, by the way, in the 1920s, there were no rules.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_00: So I mean, literally no rules.
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_00: There was no SEC inside of trading.
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_00: All these stocks are being manipulated, like crazy back then.
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_00: And here we are right now trying to take these rules away, trying to take transparency away.
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_00: The tech titans are meeting at the White House.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_01: All of this, so many of the sort of same component parts of this.
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_00: And also, I would argue even now with, I don't know if you call it a bubble, but sort of,
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_00: here we are in this sort of like AI revolution.
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_00: It feels a little bit like the radio revolution.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_00: People are betting massive quantities of money using leverage, using debt,
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_00: and it's happening all over again.
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_00: And there's also this idea of the lottery ticket.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_00: So right now, Trump just implemented a new law that effectively is going to allow
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_00: the venture capital guys and the private equity guys and the private credit guys
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_00: to literally sell product to the ordinary investor.
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_00: For the first time, this stuff is going to end up in people's retirement accounts.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_00: For the first time, like your 401K account is now going to have access to these things,
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_00: which we never allowed before because we thought it was too risky, but now we're saying
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_00: it's not too risky.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_00: And why is that happening?
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_01: I don't quite understand that.
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_01: Is that also have to do with the government and intel and sort of, or is that a different thing?
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_01: I think it's a different thing.
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_00: I think it's the idea, and this was a very 1920s-ish idea, that the elites were making all of this
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_00: money.
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_00: And that the ordinary, the little guy had no access.
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_00: So it is true that folks who've had access to buy shares of Uber or Facebook before
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_00: they ever went public, they're the ones who made a fortune.
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_00: And we created laws, by the way, after 1933, where we said, unless you have a million
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: dollars, you cannot invest in these kind of private investments because we thought we
[00:30:28] SPEAKER_00: were too risky.
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_00: So there's a lot of people who didn't have enough money to be able to risk all of it.
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_00: That was the concept.
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_00: But in a way, there's a view today that somehow we have not just protected them from losing
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_00: money, we've protected them from making money.
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_00: And at the same time, we're sort of protecting the man.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_00: So there's this sort of subculture that's an elite that's made up of to make all this
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_00: money and others haven't had access.
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_00: And so what I think this president is trying to do is say, we want everybody to have the
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_00: lottery ticket. The thing that I'm, I, that worries me is when everybody has a lottery
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_00: ticket, most people have a lottery ticket lose. That is the great conundrum of the lottery.
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_00: And the people who lose, who lose are often the people who can't afford to lose.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_01: Yes, that's exactly right. When you look at the big picture, what do you think is responsible
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_01: for all these kind of big cultural and economic shifts that we're witnessing right now?
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_01: If you had to put the pieces together, were, are they all the things that I mentioned
[00:31:33] SPEAKER_01: in terms of the environment we're living in? Or, I mean, what forces are colliding right
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_01: now?
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_01: So, I think there's a couple of things happening. Start with the underlying issue of the human
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_00: condition, which is we all want more. That's not capitalism, that's just human nature.
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_01: And you also have a group of people, the financiers who have a lot of money, who've been
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_00: lobbying in Washington to allow for a lot of this to happen. So, you know, crypto, which
[00:32:11] is again another seemingly speculative kind of thing to do. Those guys basically helped
[00:32:19] bankroll President Trump's election. And so, that money's, they effectively paid for
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_00: that access. And there are people, I do believe that the people who are behind all this
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_00: genuinely do believe that this is good for America. Like, they do believe that letting
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_00: the ordinary American invest in these opportunities, they call them opportunities. And they think
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_00: they're a good thing. And by the way, they may turn out to be a good thing in the long
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_00: run, if you can keep all the guardrails around them. I think one of the great lessons of
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_00: 1929 was you need guardrails. People left to their own devices will always want more. And
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_00: we are not the greatest self-regulators of ourselves. But there are no guardrails. And that's
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_01: the conundrum. I think right now increasingly, the guardrails are coming off. The administration
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_00: recently announced a plan where corporations, public companies who used to have to report
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_00: their earnings every quarter, four times a year, the president came out and said, you
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_00: don't need to do that anymore. We won't need to only do that twice a year. So, again,
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_00: less transparency. And the SEC looks like they're probably going to back that plan. So, I
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_00: think there's just a whole bunch of these types of things that are happening in this moment
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_00: that are concerning. Let's go back to 1929 and the aftermath following those few years.
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_01: There was regulation. Yes. Talk about what happened. And do you view some of the measures
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_01: as perhaps an over correction? That's a great question. So, one of the big things that
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_00: happened and one of the main characters in this book is a guy named Carter Glass, who
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_00: – Glass-Steagall, hello. – People know from Glass-Steagall. Carter Glass, though, was
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_00: really like the Elizabeth Warren of his time, maybe AOC, but more like Elizabeth Warren.
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: And for many years in the 1920s, he used to rail about this thing called Mitchellism in
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_00: Charlie Mitchell. He thought people at Charlie Mitchell were going to ruin America because
[00:34:18] Charlie Mitchell was loaning people all his money. He was going to lead to all this speculation
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_00: and upend the economy. And so, there were a lot of laws that were put in place by people
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: like Carter Glass, though, again, without giving away too much. How Glass-Steagall was actually
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_00: put together, even for me, and I think he was from scholars who read the book. It's
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_00: like a shock. It's like completely at odds with what you'd think really happened sort
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_00: of a wild story. And so, you had that happen. You had the creation of the SEC in 1934.
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_00: By the way, Roosevelt, of course, comes into power in 1933. He goes after some of the
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_00: banks, shuts down a lot of the banks. So, there was a whole bunch of things. Is it an
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_00: over correction? Probably, to some degree, but was it too much? I mean, the good news
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_00: is we've had other financial crises, 2008 being one of them, dot-com bust being another.
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_00: But we haven't gone totally off the cliff for a decade or more at a time. And the one
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_00: thing I will say that was a bit of a weird lesson for me, we all think speculations like
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_00: a dirty word, right? You don't want too much speculation. But we all need a little bit
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_00: of speculation because speculation is like the twin of innovation. If you look and think
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_00: about Elon Musk and Tesla, somebody at some point had to speculate on Elon Musk early
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_00: on when it seemed like an insane thing to do. It was a complete speculation. And you need
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_00: that in the economy for there to be innovation. Otherwise, we'll never get any. But the
[00:35:53] SPEAKER_00: question is, so where's the line? And when does it become too much? And when does it become
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_00: too much of a group thing? I do think, by the way, we might be having a little bit of that.
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_00: Well, I was going to ask you, of course, when you said that, I'm thinking, okay, the AI bubble,
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_01: right? And what's happening now? How do you think that's playing out? And how does it relate
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_01: to some of the other group thing? Disaster, honestly. So I think the AI bubble is a bubble
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_00: and it will pop. But I think of it more like the dot-com bubble, which is to say, the internet
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_00: came of age in the late 90s and there was a pop. But the internet is still here and is
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_00: more powerful and a bigger force than ever. So I think something like that will probably
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_00: happen with AI, meaning there's definitely over investment and probably investment in
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_00: the wrong areas. And so there will be some kind of come-upence. I don't think that means
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_00: that AI is not a thing. I think AI is probably a generational shift for everybody.
[00:36:56] But there will be a correction. There will be a correction.
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_01: The question that we don't know this time around is if you believe that every financial
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_00: crisis is a function of too much leverage in the system, too much borrowing money, right?
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: In 1929, there's too many people borrowing for stocks. In 2008, there's too many people
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: borrowing for subprime loans and the like. It could be that there's too much borrowing
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_00: going on around these AI data centers. People don't appreciate, yes, Google and Facebook,
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_00: they're all spending hundreds of billions of dollars. But to build these data centers,
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_00: there's energy companies that are taking on extraordinary amount of debt, construction
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_00: companies, real estate companies. And that debt, we can't see anymore. That's actually
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_00: another big thing. It used to be that you'd get a loan from a bank. And so the system
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_00: could see the debt in the system, the leverage in the system. Today, it's all moved into what
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_00: they call the shadows into this private credit business. And so we don't really know what's
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_00: going on. And that's a little scary. And I'll give you one more little, not to scare
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_00: everybody. But you know, you're starting to see what they call round trip deals. These
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_00: like circular deals where so in video and open AI did this very unusual deal a couple
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_00: weeks ago where open AI is buying chips like crazy from the video. But open AI can't afford
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_00: to buy all the chips that it's committing to buy. It doesn't make it doesn't make money.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_00: It's losing money right now. Right. So what's happened in video, invest money into open
[00:38:28] SPEAKER_00: AI. So they have now committed to give them a hundred billion dollars, which then they're
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: going to take the hundred billion dollars and buy the Nvidia chips. So it's a completely
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_00: circular transactions like magic. And then just I think two weeks ago now, a similar
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_00: deal. Open AI is going to buy chips from AMD can't afford to buy the chips in AMD. Says
[00:38:54] to itself, well, if we announce that we're going to buy chips from AMD, AMD stock is likely
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_00: to go up. So we're going to get a stake in AMD. And when the shares magically go up, we'll
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_00: now have money from those and then we'll go buy the chips. What's wrong with that? Well,
[00:39:11] it just reflects that there's not a sort of underlying stability in that market. You know,
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_00: when you get into what's called vendor financing, when the vendor basically has to finance you,
[00:39:24] it can come back to bite you. Now, yes, if open AI turns out to be a massive success and super
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_00: profitable, maybe no harm, no harm, no foul. But if it doesn't, you know, the whole sort of
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_00: ecosystem can break. And I don't right now, we're in this very weird moment in the stock market,
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: where, you know, every time that a company announces they're going to invest, it's been more money.
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_00: The stock goes up, doesn't go down. It used to be, you know, if you fire people, stock will go up
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_00: because they're going to spend less money. They're going to invest less stock goes up. This is like
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_00: the opposite. You say people aren't investing in the right thing with AI. So I'll bite. What
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_01: should I be investing in when it comes to AI? So it's not that you shouldn't be investing in AI.
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_00: I think the way people are investing in AI right now is just to buy the big, you know, shares in
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_00: the big tech companies in video. And there are a lot of other smaller companies that are going to be
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_01: important to the whole AI environment. Maybe. And that's another question. There's so many small
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_00: startups that have been coming up around this whole ecosystem. Do they last? Do they not last?
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if we know the answer. The other piece of this that we haven't gotten to and
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_00: then maybe go back to 1933 and think about this. So we had unemployment in the country in 1933,
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_00: about 25 percent. It's kind of insane. 25 percent, a quarter of people were unemployed.
[00:40:48] If AI is successful, so all of these AI companies, for them to be successful,
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_00: they have to create more productivity. Companies are only going to pay for these services if they
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_00: create more productivity for their company. Productivity is a euphemism dare I say for taking out cost.
[00:41:06] Other cost. What is the other cost? It's human cost. It's people. So if this is truly a success,
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_00: you know, if they shoot the moon and this is really successful, at the same time that the companies
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_00: may seemingly be successful, there's going to be a lot of people who lose their job who won't be
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_00: able to afford to use the services that these companies are going to provide. Do you think anyone
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_01: is thinking about that? I think that there's a lot of people wearing the line der's saying,
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_00: let's hope for the best. I think there's a lot of hope. I don't think there's a lot of actually
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_00: like model-out spreadsheets that say, if you do this and this and this, it will do this. I think there's
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_00: a lot of hope and prayer taking place right now. But if you talk to a lot of the leaders in
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_00: Silicon Valley today, they say we are more scared of being behind. Exactly. And so therefore we're
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_01: just going to, you know, we're putting all our chips down. It's Gina, Gina, Gina, right?
[00:42:07] That's the president would say. That's what that's what they're, I feel like they are saying we cannot
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_01: lose our competitiveness and unintended or obvious consequences be damned. Honestly.
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_01: I think there's a truth to that. You look at some of these companies that are spending basically
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_00: half to maybe, in some cases, more than all of their revenues. Literally, they're taking all the
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_00: money and investing in AI. And maybe they'll be right. And by the way, as I said, I am sure that AI
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_00: will be a powerful force, huge, powerful force on the other side of this. I just think along the way,
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_00: there will be a hiccup. And the question is, how big is the hiccup? It's all kind of like globalization.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_01: Like nobody really thought about the long-term impact of a flatter world as Tom Friedman would say.
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_01: And this is kind of that on steroids, right? It could turn out to be. Yeah.
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_01: Isn't that when the government is supposed to come in and say, whoa, everybody, let's kind of
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_01: talk about the impact of this technology. And let's kind of plan for it.
[00:43:17] Yes, that's what the government is supposed to do. Having said that we have both a broken government
[00:43:22] SPEAKER_00: and we're in a rush. It's a combination of two things. It's that the government clearly,
[00:43:27] at least in this moment, I don't think you're going to be at both sides talking on these issues.
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_00: And the other piece is, and they're not wrong in this respect. If life is relative,
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_00: you do need to care what the competitor is doing. And that is China. And if China is going full steam ahead,
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_00: and they're throwing all their chips down, maybe at least the argument goes, we have to, otherwise,
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_00: we lose. And what do you think? And that there's like a permanence to the loss. Right. That's the issue.
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_00: Where do you fall? I think you could do a lot of what we're doing
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_00: marginally slower without ultimately losing the game. I think we are still ahead of the game
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_00: relative to China. And I think what you could say, what does that mean in practice?
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_00: I think from a regulatory standpoint, instead of sort of opening up all these new avenues for
[00:44:23] SPEAKER_00: everybody to just throw money at the problem, I think you probably do that part in a slower and
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_00: more methodical way than we're doing it. And I don't think I would slow an open AI or a Microsoft
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_00: or a Google down that much. And that would give a chance for some of these other considerations to be?
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_01: Well, the bigger considerations about employment. Right. Well, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, if you really get into what's going to happen with employment, I don't know what
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_00: you're supposed to do. Or what's going to happen to our way of life? And should there be universal
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_01: basic income? And how? How will I need to be having those conversations? People are probably not.
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you've been having some of those conversations. Others have had those conversations, but
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_00: it's not like a active conversation. And part because we don't know. So that's the other piece of
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_00: this. We don't really know. And is it going to be a transitional period where we're going to have
[00:45:17] SPEAKER_00: to select transition from one thing to another. And that's going to be painful. But on the other
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_00: side of the transition, we all figure it out and everybody learns how to use AI. And it makes it.
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_00: There will be a robot apocalypse, right? Or there will be a robot apocalypse. And people will
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_00: be listening to this podcast and we will be holograms. Exactly. Like that night happened.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_00: We should put this conversation in a time capsule. I mean, the craziest thing, I don't know if you've
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_00: played with like notebook, LAM or any of these models. I actually just learned how to do that.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_01: So you know, you can create a podcast. I have a son who now takes material from the internet that he
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_00: has to learn puts it into these models, puts his headphones on and goes for a walk and listens to
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_00: a effectively AI generated podcast to teach him about, you know, some of the, some of the classes
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_00: that he's trying to learn. But there's part of me that thinks that's super exciting. I was going to say
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_00: I could say it's like a very cool thing. But it often, or I don't know if it's often,
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_00: ultimately probably means we won't have as many teachers. And what are those people? I mean,
[00:46:27] I don't know. I don't know what we're, I don't know where this all heads. I just think we should be
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_01: thinking about it some more and hypothesizing about it some more. So there were a better position.
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_01: At least thought about the debate when it actually hits us. Yes. Yes. I'm with you. Do you know,
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_00: I mean, if you had to name a person who's really talking about this, is there anybody?
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_01: Do you know Tristan Harris? Oh, yeah. I know him. I love him. I mean, I think he's thought about
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_00: this deeply in relation to social media and the impact social media on society and democracy.
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_00: I think he's increasingly spending time thinking about the impact of AI on society and humanity as well.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_00: I interviewed him a couple of times, I think in 2018 when I was doing an hour for Natchio on tech
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_01: addiction. And I think he and I need to have another conversation now. He's a head of the fact.
[00:47:15] SPEAKER_01: He's been a head of the game on all this. No, he has. And he has been screaming for the
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_01: mountain tops. The problem is there are not many voices like his out there.
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_01: That's the thing about Cassandra's. There's always a Cassandra in the room. By the way, in the late
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_00: 20s, there were lots of Cassandra's people screaming from the rooftops and nobody wanted to listen
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_00: to them. And it's a very interesting thing just about humanity. You know, when things are going
[00:47:38] SPEAKER_00: gangbusters, nobody wants the party to end. They're like, la la la la la la. Exactly.
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_00: Always. But that's, you know, by the way, think about financial crisis in 2008. I remember people
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_00: 2003 and four people say, oh, I think there's a real estate bubble going on. Remember,
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_00: you know, I'm not going to buy a house this year. I'm going to wait. It's going to fall next year.
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_00: So I won't, I'm just going to wait. In the next year, you'd read a big article about,
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_00: but cover article about how there's a real estate bubble. He said, no, I'll wait another year.
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_00: But you wait and then it keeps going up in the real estate. And then you say, just, okay,
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_00: the train is leaving the station. I better get on it. I can get on the train. I'm never going to be
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_01: able to get on this train. Of course, you, everyone jumps on the train right before it's about to,
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_00: you know, curl off the track. Before we talk about today, because I want to ask you some things
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_01: about President Trump, I do want to go back for a moment to talk about FDR and his role in
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_01: this because, you know, I, I admire, I stand FDR in modern day parlance. And I thought it was
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_01: really interesting what you wrote about him. You said that even though handling the economy
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_01: wasn't actually Roosevelt's strength, it was not his thing. Somehow Americans grew to trust him
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_01: anyway. And as a whole world fell apart, the United States fed off his abundant confidence.
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_01: People were desperate to believe in something because, and then you add they certainly didn't
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_01: believe in money anymore. That's true. So, so just tell me what I don't know about FDR.
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_01: Well, so FDR, I don't want to say FDR was Trumpian, but FDR was kind of Trumpian. I mean, I think that people
[00:49:16] there were people who just were believers. They really believed. I don't think that anybody would have
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_00: told you that somehow FDR was some kind of, you know, financial genius or guru who understood
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_00: how to deal with the economy. I think he saw a mess. It was a mess. I think he got a little bit
[00:49:32] SPEAKER_00: lucky in terms of the timing of when he came in. And the fact, frankly, that Hoover didn't make
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_00: certain decisions he probably should have or could have in the year two before Roosevelt arrived.
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_00: And the country was sort of so psychologically damaged that they just wanted. They like,
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_00: they almost willed certain things to happen. And then of course the new deal comes around.
[00:49:58] But that was not, that was not like an economic plan really initially. It was, there was all so
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: many other sort of social aspects to what he was trying to do, but it all happened to work. And so
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_00: and then of course World Two comes along and that helps economically too. So there's a whole bunch
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_00: of things that I think we give Roosevelt a lot of credit. I don't know. I'm not saying he doesn't
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_00: serve it. It happened on his watch, but I'm not sure it happened because he was, you know,
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_00: the Messiah would come to economic activity. Speaking of Messiah's or lack thereof. Let's talk about
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_01: Donald Trump and his economic plans. Just 37% of US adults approve of his handling of the economy
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_01: according to a recent AP and our NORC Center for Public Affairs poll. What do you make of that
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_01: number given that so many people looked to him as a businessman and all knowing businessman
[00:51:00] SPEAKER_01: to set the economy straight? So this to me is a complicated question. And more complicated,
[00:51:08] SPEAKER_00: maybe than you think I don't know. The economy seems to be doing shockingly well,
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_00: at least on the surface. Now I would argue one of the reasons for that is this AI bubble. I think
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_00: if you would actually take the AI investment piece out of it and look at the rest of the economy,
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_00: you'd say actually kind of lousy or not so great. And then you throw on the tariff piece that he's
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_00: put in place and you say to yourself, okay, that is creating more of a slowdown than we give a
[00:51:41] credit for. Because AI is powering so much of it, I think it's masking a lot of the other things
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_00: that are happening. Are you talking about the stock market or the overall economy? So when I say
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_00: AI bubble, people think, oh, AI bubble is like the Nvidia stock. That's not what's happening here.
[00:52:00] SPEAKER_00: The AI bubble is impacting the entire economy. So what's happening is companies are spending hundreds
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_00: of billions of dollars. Those hundreds of billions of dollars are being used to build a data center
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_00: or data centers all over. What does that mean? Someone has to buy a new real estate. They have to go
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_00: construct the data center. They have to create new forms of energy. So the energy companies,
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_00: the electricians, the construction guys. I mean, this is huge amounts and obviously the chip makers,
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_00: all of the, there's so many pieces of the economy where people are getting jobs now. And what about companies,
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_00: too, that have to hire people to help understand how AI is going to impact their business? Is that
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: contributing it? Do it as well. I think less on folk. I mean, I think there's a little bit of
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_00: that happening. I think the truth is more people will lose their job in the short term from AI
[00:52:52] SPEAKER_00: than the new people that are actually coming on. To transform the stuff. And the truth is a lot of
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_00: this is a sugar high. So I would say, are we in like a gold rush or a sugar rush? Because you're
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_00: going to build a data center, which could each data center is going to take hundreds of people to
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_00: build. But once the data center is built, it could take five or 10 people to manage the data center.
[00:53:15] SPEAKER_00: It's not like it requires thousands of people. So even if this is a bubble, though, Andrew,
[00:53:20] SPEAKER_01: why do just 37% of people approve of this handling of the economy? I think costs are going up.
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_00: It feels like things are still more expensive. I think that's true to some extent. Though, by the way,
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_00: to his credit, there's certain things that are cheaper than they used to be and other things
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_00: that are more expensive than they used to be. I think people are just anxious and worried about
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_00: where we really are. And I think that in the areas where he said that he was going to make big changes.
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_00: This is in the industrial, sort of, rust-spelt of America. I don't think you've actually seen
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_00: the real change. But we also haven't talked about like immigration's a big issue. If you don't have
[00:54:01] immigrants, that's a problem. There's a lot of sort of economic forces at play here between tariffs
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_00: and immigration and everything else that I think we have to be thinking about. Having said that,
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_00: one of the biggest shifts in this whole conversation, and this president has made it such,
[00:54:22] is they're now tying tariffs to national security. And that's a very interesting concept.
[00:54:30] By the way, that's the concept we were not talking about in 1929.
[00:54:32] SPEAKER_00: Interesting or scary? I don't know. I'm not sure. I'll tell you what I mean when I say I'm not sure.
[00:54:43] If we didn't have tariffs on cars in America, there's a company called BYD in China that can make
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_00: the cars better and cheaper than any car that's made here. We would have no car automobile industry
[00:54:57] SPEAKER_00: at all. You wouldn't make it a car here. It just wouldn't happen. Is that okay? Is that acceptable?
[00:55:05] That there would be no automobile industry. If there was ever a problem where you couldn't get access
[00:55:09] SPEAKER_00: to cars in China, would that be a problem? I think we did learn during the pandemic that you do need
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_00: some form of resilience around drugs, around masks, around potentially cars and parts and all sorts
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_00: of things. I think there's this very interesting question that we all have to resolve, which is yes,
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_00: we can get the cheaper product from other places and we can become a complete services economy,
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_00: sort of like what the UK did, or we can decide that we actually need to be making these products here.
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_00: If we're going to make these products here, then we've got to figure out how we're going to do that.
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_00: And how we're going to compete. And how we compete. I think we're not going to compete, by the way.
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_00: That's the other thing. So all these tariffs are going to mean we're not going to compete. It is
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_00: likely the 10 years from now, I was talking to the CEO of a big auto company, 10 years from now,
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_00: we will pay more for lousier cars in America than most people will be able to get in other places.
[00:56:02] SPEAKER_00: You'll go on vacation to Europe or to Asia or somewhere like that and you will sit in the back
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_00: of a car and think wow, this is pretty great. We don't have things like this or we have things like
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_00: this but they cost so much that nobody has them. And do you think Americans can tolerate paying more
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_01: for crummy products? That's the fundamental question. Or less good products. I think Americans don't,
[00:56:26] here's the thing. We don't really like to pay more for things that say made in America. Most people
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_00: don't. Most people don't seem to care. Just see the little sticker in the back. It says,
[00:56:37] SPEAKER_00: man, China made in America, nobody seems to really just give me the shirt I want and make the best
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_01: product. And I don't want to pay too much. And I think we as a country sort of have to come to
[00:56:50] grips with what that means. And we could talk about like wire cars so much more expensive and
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_01: lower quality in this country versus China. Right. And well, because we pay people to make them.
[00:57:00] SPEAKER_01: Because we pay people to make them. That's a huge part of it. We pay people to make them. And so
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_00: we have to decide do we want to pay people to make them? I mean, these are all of the sort of fun
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_00: even people making them in the era of AI. We may not because the robots may ultimately make them.
[00:57:15] My head is exploding. Yeah. It's tough stuff. How would you characterize Trump's economic philosophy?
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_01: I wanted to ask Condi Bryce, Andrew and I were at a conference recently and Condi Bryce
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_01: was there. I wanted to have her characterize Trump's foreign policy philosophy. Unfortunately,
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_01: I didn't get to ask her the question. So let me ask you how would you describe his economic
[00:57:39] SPEAKER_01: philosophy? It seems all over the place. So I think there's actually one through line to everything
[00:57:46] SPEAKER_00: the man does, which is he wants leverage over everyone. Everyone. Over people, over country.
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_00: Where can he find the leverage? Where is the leverage point that he will have over somebody else?
[00:58:02] SPEAKER_00: That is the entirety of the strategy. So when you think about, you know, he went after the
[00:58:11] SPEAKER_00: universities, for example, and said, I'm going to take that your money away for science and other
[00:58:16] SPEAKER_00: things. That was a lever. He looked and said, I don't like the DEI policies at universities.
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_00: Do I have any leverage with these people? Well, I do actually, if I take their science money away.
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_00: Right? Now they're federal funding. Oh, they're federal funding away.
[00:58:31] SPEAKER_01: Do I have leverage over China? Do I have leverage over Europe? Do I have, you know, I don't like
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_00: what the way Europe's treating American companies? Well, maybe I'd like to. What do I have that they need?
[00:58:43] SPEAKER_01: What do I have that they need? And can I put the screws to them? And if I put the screws to them,
[00:58:48] SPEAKER_00: well, they then do what I want. I think that's the entire that is the strategy. I'm curious. As
[00:58:54] SPEAKER_00: someone who knows the economy like the back of his hand, what are the pitfalls of running a country
[00:59:00] SPEAKER_01: that way? Well, it depends. This is a very interesting question. It depends how mercenary you think
[00:59:06] SPEAKER_00: the world really is. So I think for the last 50 years, we've actually thought that we could be a
[00:59:11] SPEAKER_00: role model for the world and that we wanted people to like us. And we did lots of things to make
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_00: people like us. We let our most of our economy be open. We tried to share our prosperity with others.
[00:59:27] SPEAKER_00: We oftentimes were donating money to other countries and bailing them out and doing all sorts of
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_00: things. And the question is, did that help us or not? He believes it did not help us. He believes
[00:59:40] SPEAKER_00: we had no leverage over these people. He believes in that they took advantage of us. I was going to
[00:59:44] SPEAKER_00: say that we got screwed. That we got screwed. I think it's hard to say we got screwed because I think
[00:59:49] SPEAKER_00: the truth is we are still this great shining, you know, Hill sitting on a hill. Thank you. Well,
[00:59:56] SPEAKER_00: we could also be a hill. And I think we probably did get screwed in certain things, but I think
[01:00:03] SPEAKER_00: on the whole, we've done pretty well doing it this way. And then this desire to have leverage on
[01:00:09] SPEAKER_01: everyone. I mean, let's face it, it can also be very alienating to countries when we need them.
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_01: Right? Well, that's going to be the big question. When we actually need them, what's going to happen?
[01:00:22] SPEAKER_00: And I don't think we know the answer. That's that's look, there's so many things where this president is
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_00: just, you know, shifting and changing the way we've done things, taking stakes in companies.
[01:00:32] SPEAKER_00: Well, I wanted to ask you about that. Can you talk about the government taking a 10% interest
[01:00:38] SPEAKER_01: and intel because it is so unprecedented and explain it to me, somebody who doesn't really understand
[01:00:45] SPEAKER_01: the economy that well, how this is so needless to say unconventional. Okay, so historically,
[01:00:54] we claimed we had a free market and the free market was such that, you know, companies could
[01:00:59] SPEAKER_00: succeed, they could fail, and the government was not an investor or playing a real role in this.
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_00: Maybe they were playing, but we did bail out companies. Well, you said, so we have bailed out
[01:01:09] SPEAKER_01: companies, but typically there was a serious crisis. It was a crisis. And the reason for bailing
[01:01:14] SPEAKER_00: them out 2008 was we believe that if we didn't bail them out, it was going to have a wider effect
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_00: on the economy. So here we are. Intel is struggling. We've decided as a country, or at least this
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_00: president has decided that chips and making chips in America is a super important thing to do.
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_00: For national security reasons, most of our chips are not made in America. We need to start making
[01:01:37] SPEAKER_00: chips in America. The Biden administration had given money to Intel as a grant said, here's the
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_00: money. We're not going to, we're not asking for anything in return. We just, what we're getting
[01:01:48] SPEAKER_00: in return is we're going to have national security and we'll have more resilience because chips
[01:01:53] SPEAKER_00: will be made here, but we're not asking for anything else. We're just handing you the money.
[01:01:58] Intel, to be honest, became a mess. It was not, it was probably a bad investment in Intel to start
[01:02:06] SPEAKER_00: with and became an even bigger problem. Intel needed more money, not more money, but needed the
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_00: sort of the next trance of the money that they were going to get. And this president said, you know what,
[01:02:18] this whole thing is so screw ball. We want more. If I'm going to give you all this money, instead of
[01:02:23] SPEAKER_00: granting you the money, just so you could have it, I want it for me. What's in it for me? I want a
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_00: piece of the action. And I want the taxpayer to have a piece of the action. So if Intel is going to
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_00: do better over time, I want them to be able to have shares in the company. And if they do worse,
[01:02:38] SPEAKER_00: by the way, we'll also lose our shares too. That was that, that's the conceit of what happens.
[01:02:44] SPEAKER_00: The problem with doing something like this in my mind is it changes the dynamic once the
[01:02:51] SPEAKER_00: government becomes an investor in companies plural. So let's say Intel in the future wants to merge
[01:02:59] SPEAKER_00: with another company. And normally, whatever that merger is, a regulator might say, you know what,
[01:03:06] SPEAKER_00: this seems like really bad for customers. We don't want two of these big guys getting together
[01:03:10] SPEAKER_00: like this. Well, how does that dynamic and that conversation change when you say yourself,
[01:03:17] we actually own 10% of this company. And if we do this, we will do a lot of taxpayer, we'll do a
[01:03:23] SPEAKER_00: customer's mega screwed, but the taxpayers that the US government that owns this will do better.
[01:03:29] SPEAKER_00: So all of a sudden, we're seeing it with these mergers of media companies and play out in a
[01:03:34] SPEAKER_01: different way. Right. It just changes the whole dynamic with which, however,
[01:03:37] SPEAKER_00: you can get to play it out and it becomes political. So do you see this happening more and more?
[01:03:43] SPEAKER_01: Is this kind of a one-off situation? No, you're having it happen right now with rare earths,
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_00: these rare earth companies, which again, we may need rare earths in this country to have great success.
[01:03:54] Should those be independent businesses? Should the government effectively subsidize them? If they do
[01:04:00] SPEAKER_00: subsidize them, should they get money? I have one for you. And actually, because I think about this,
[01:04:05] SPEAKER_00: and I actually do think it's a very interesting one. So one of the things that the Trump administration
[01:04:09] SPEAKER_00: wants to do is right now, the US government gives grants to universities all the time. And scientists
[01:04:16] SPEAKER_00: use that grant money, and they go off and do, and they make amazing discoveries and inventions.
[01:04:22] And the profits of those inventions and the patents for those inventions typically go to the
[01:04:31] SPEAKER_00: scientist and the university that's behind them. Now, the money that was used to pay the scientist
[01:04:38] SPEAKER_00: and the university came from you, Katie Kirk, and me, and everybody in this room, and was listening
[01:04:44] SPEAKER_00: and watching, because we're the taxpayers. Historically, we have never gotten anything. We have
[01:04:50] SPEAKER_00: no stake in it. What we've gotten is the invention. We've decided that the invention unto itself
[01:04:56] is the benefit for our society. Right. Should we, like an investor would, get a stake in the patent?
[01:05:06] SPEAKER_00: Because that's what the president is, that's the next place this is all going. They're going to
[01:05:10] SPEAKER_00: go to the universities and say, look, you want this grant money? Great. If you have a great success
[01:05:16] SPEAKER_00: creating CRISPR or the next great drug, the US taxpayers should get a little bit of that money.
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_00: And you would look at it in all of the context and say, okay, this government, I mean, we
[01:05:27] SPEAKER_00: as a government or as a country are overspending and not taking enough revenue. You have to figure out
[01:05:32] SPEAKER_00: new ways to get revenue. That would be one way to do it. Is that good? Is that bad? Science community
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_00: would tell you it's horrible. I don't know. Why would the science community be so against that?
[01:05:43] SPEAKER_01: Because they would say that they deserve the fruits of their labor and that these are not
[01:05:50] SPEAKER_00: inventions of the taxpayer and that the American public is getting a great benefit. Because it's
[01:05:56] life-saving work. Because it's life-saving work. What do you think?
[01:06:01] I have totally mixed views. I don't know. I don't know if we said we want 10% of the action,
[01:06:11] whether that would change the dynamic with which the universities would do this work, whether the
[01:06:16] SPEAKER_00: professors, the scientists would not do this work or do it differently. I go to a different country.
[01:06:21] SPEAKER_01: I don't know. That's the question. Right now they're not getting the funding, so it's kind of a
[01:06:24] SPEAKER_01: moot point. But it's an interesting, but I'm just saying, philosophically, it's a very interesting
[01:06:29] SPEAKER_00: concept. Irrespective of whether you think President Trump is a good president or a bad president,
[01:06:34] SPEAKER_00: these are some of the ideas that he's throwing around, some of which I think at least merit a
[01:06:40] SPEAKER_00: conversation about saying, okay, maybe this is good, maybe this is bad. What about his sort of view
[01:06:46] SPEAKER_01: of the federal reserve? I mean, it's very different. It's been a core guard rail for decades,
[01:06:53] SPEAKER_01: and now he's pressuring, as you know, I mean, probably talk about this every morning, Andrew,
[01:06:58] SPEAKER_01: Jerome Pyle, trying to ask Governor Lisa Cook, you know, talk about the threats to the feds
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_01: and dependents. This is a different way of looking at the federal reserve. Should it be an arm
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_01: of the executive branch? So this I have a much stronger view about. I think politics has to stay
[01:07:18] SPEAKER_00: very, very far away from the federal reserve. And by the way, to bring it back, oddly in 1929,
[01:07:25] one of the reasons that the federal reserve didn't do what it probably should have done in 1929,
[01:07:29] SPEAKER_00: which was raise interest rates in a material way, was because they were worried about the politics
[01:07:34] SPEAKER_00: of it. They were worried about the optics of it. The federal reserve was a new entity,
[01:07:38] SPEAKER_00: started in 1913, and these guys thought, you know what, if we do something that damages the
[01:07:43] SPEAKER_00: economy, meaning we try to clamp down on all of this, we're going to hold up in front of Congress,
[01:07:47] SPEAKER_00: we may lose our jobs, but not just that, the federal reserve may disappear. Like this is not,
[01:07:51] SPEAKER_00: now it's been around for a while so people think it's supposed to be here. That was not the case
[01:07:55] SPEAKER_00: back then. You do not want political pressure on the folks operating the federal reserve. You
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_00: want them to be making a decision based on the math, frankly. And the second, you think politics
[01:08:10] SPEAKER_00: gets involved. At some point, I would imagine that investors around the world who invest and buy
[01:08:18] SPEAKER_00: treasuries in America would say to themselves, you know what, right now I pay
[01:08:25] X percent for the bond, and you only have to give me this kind of premium because I trust you.
[01:08:32] But if you're going to politicize all this and I don't know what you're doing, I'm going to
[01:08:36] SPEAKER_00: charge you more. And if they charge you more, it's going to cost all of us.
[01:08:40] SPEAKER_00: So the impact would be, the impact would be that it would cost, that our debt, the US debt would
[01:08:49] SPEAKER_00: ultimately cost more. And that would be a problem because we don't have enough money to pay our debt
[01:08:54] SPEAKER_00: as it is. Donald Trump has, I think, kind of reimagined the presidency to say the least. And I'm
[01:09:02] SPEAKER_01: just curious with everyone you talk to every day about very complicated topics. And I know your
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_01: focus is on the economy and finances. But when you look at what has gone on, Andrew, just I'm asking
[01:09:16] SPEAKER_01: for a friend, asking a friend from the time he went into office to now and plans. And you hear
[01:09:24] SPEAKER_01: things like plenary authority and things like that, uttered by Stephen Miller and this, you know,
[01:09:30] SPEAKER_01: unprecedented power of the executive branch. As somebody who's covered so many administrations
[01:09:38] SPEAKER_01: on a scale of one to 10. Yeah. How concerned are you for the country? Seven. Seven. And because,
[01:09:47] SPEAKER_00: let me tell you why, I think you might be 10. I don't know. Maybe I'm a little higher than seven.
[01:09:54] SPEAKER_01: I don't think I don't know if I'm 10 now, but maybe, but I'm going to tell you the thing that I can't,
[01:09:59] SPEAKER_00: that I grapple with. Okay. So there are things that this president does that I think are completely
[01:10:04] SPEAKER_00: unusual and problematic and I worry about democracy and I see the indictment of Comey, for example.
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_00: And I think, and that is to me, at least from the outside, feels like a weaponization of the system
[01:10:20] SPEAKER_00: in a very bad way. Okay. And then I see this deal that was just made between Israel and Hamas,
[01:10:32] SPEAKER_00: which seems almost unthinkable. By the way, during the Biden administration, unthinkable.
[01:10:39] And potentially, if lasting could have, you know, a huge impact on peace in the Middle East.
[01:10:45] SPEAKER_00: If that is true, it's, and trying to balance and waive these things against each other
[01:10:52] are hard, are harder for me than you think. And so I'm not ready to wave my hand and say,
[01:10:58] SPEAKER_00: it's all awful and I'm definitely not ready to say it's all fabulous. You're ready to say,
[01:11:04] you have mixed feelings. I'm at a step.
[01:11:08] SPEAKER_00: Well, the book is called 1929, inside the greatest crash in Wall Street history and how it shattered
[01:11:17] SPEAKER_01: a nation. It is going to make a great dramatic series for someone, somewhere because the characters
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_01: are so fascinating. And I think part of it, I mean, a big part of it, Andrew, is because you
[01:11:30] SPEAKER_01: write it like a thriller. And it is so dramatic and the characters are so interesting that they
[01:11:36] SPEAKER_01: jump off the page. And I hope everyone buys it. And from your lips, thank you, Kate.
[01:11:44] SPEAKER_01: And I love talking to you. Thank you so much for coming in. I appreciate it. This is so much fun.
