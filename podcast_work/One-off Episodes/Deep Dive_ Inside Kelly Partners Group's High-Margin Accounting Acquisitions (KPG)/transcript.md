[00:00:00] Welcome back to The Deep Dive.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_01: You know, we're all looking for ways to get smart, fast, right, especially with business models that aren't immediately obvious.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_01: Absolutely. And today we've got a really interesting one.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: A company taking a pretty traditional sector and, well, putting a unique spin on it.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_00: Exactly. So today we're diving deep into Kelly Partners Group or KPG.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_01: They're an Australian company and they acquire accounting firms in a, let's say, distinct way.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_01: We've got a couple of different perspectives here. Two podcast interviews.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_00: One focusing more on the value side. The other on growth. Plus their latest financials from December 2024.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: Right. So our mission today is to really unpack KPG. What makes them tick? Is there real growth potential here?
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_01: Like some investors think? Yeah. What's fascinating is this blend of like old school acquisition.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_00: But with this specific operational playbook, it's a great case study and compounding, really.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_00: And this is for you listening in. If you're curious about different business models, maybe roll up strategies
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: and, you know, buying lots of small companies or just how a smaller player aims for big growth, stick around.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_01: Let's get into it. What is Kelly Partners Group at its heart?
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: So fundamentally they call themselves a serial acquireer. They buy accounting and tax firms.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_01: Started in Australia, but now they're moving into the US, the UK, Canada.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: And the founder, Brett Kelly, he's got an interesting story.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's a chartered accountant himself started KPG back in 2006.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: Apparently he even self published a book interviewing top Aussie business leaders for wisdom.
[00:01:33] And the story goes he didn't get made partner at his old firm, which kind of lit a fire under him.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: He thought I can do this much better, which leads to their core model, this partner owner driver thing.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Does make you ask why would successful firm owners sell a 51% majority stick?
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: Why not just sell the whole thing or, you know, keep it?
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: That's the key question, isn't it?
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_01: Selling control, but sticking around. What's the catch or the incentive rather?
[00:01:59] Well, the sources suggest it's pretty compelling.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_00: First, KPG essentially promises them you'll make more money with us than without us.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_00: Okay. That's a strong pitch.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_01: It is. And they also help with succession planning.
[00:02:10] So older partners can maybe reduce their hours, phase out gradually, but still be involved,
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: and importantly, still earning.
[00:02:18] So it solves that exit problem for partners to exactly.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_00: And because of this alignment, KPG can buy these firms at pretty attractive prices.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: We're talking maybe four to five times EBITDA.
[00:02:30] They're aiming for a 20% return hurdle on these deals.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: So cheap acquisition is part of the story, but you mentioned operational improvements.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_01: That sounds like where the real magic happens, taking these firms and making them
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: way more profitable.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_01: That's the secret sauce, as they say.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: They take firms with maybe mid-single digit margins and boost them up towards like 30%,
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_00: sometimes even higher.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_00: 30% in accounting. How on earth do they manage that?
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_01: Through their centralized business system.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: Get this.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_00: 9% of the revenue from every firm they buy goes back to the holding company, KPGH.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_01: And KPGH provides shared services.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: Essential tech team, HR, marketing, sales support.
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_00: They give it like a central brain optimizing all the limbs.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: So KPGH acts like an operating system they plug these firms into.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: Can you give an example?
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_01: Sure. Things like automating billing.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: You'd be surprised how many small firms are maybe not great at collecting receivables quickly.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: KPGH fixes that, improves the cash cycle.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: Right. Basic blocking and tackling, but systemized.
[00:03:29] Exactly. And they use data from all their acquisitions over 80 now to advise firms on things
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: like pricing. One was the last time you enjoyed switching to accountants.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: Huh. Never. It's a nightmare. The risk, the hassle.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_01: Precisely. Client retention is incredibly high.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: It's sticky. There's huge brain damage involved in switching,
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: especially with complex stuff like carried interest or sensitive tax info.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: KPGH knows this and leverages it.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_00: That client inertia is a massive asset.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_01: So it's not just buying cheap.
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_01: It's buying sticky businesses and then turbo-targing their operations using the central system.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_01: It reminds me of a skilled chef taking good ingredients and just elevating them.
[00:04:07] That's a good analogy. They're not just collecting firms.
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_00: They're actively improving them.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_00: Okay. So they have this system for improving firms.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_01: How do they find them? You mentioned they focus on smaller ones.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Typically in the $1 million to $10 million revenue range.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: And that's important. By targeting this smaller, highly fragmented end of the market,
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: they avoid budding heads directly with, say, big private equity funds or even listed competitors
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: like Cbiz, which tends to go for larger mid-market firms.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_01: Smart. Less competition, potentially better prices and the pipeline.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_01: How do they keep finding deals?
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_01: This is pretty cool. They use what they call a decentralized scout network.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: Meaning? Meaning the partners they've already acquired who are now owners in the larger KPG group.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: Remember, they become the scouts. They're on the ground in their local markets,
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: identifying and recommending the next potential firms for KPG to talk to.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: Ah, so the network feeds itself. Very organic.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_01: Very. And it's worth noting they have Lawrence Cunningham on their board.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_00: He's also on the board of constellation software.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: Oh, wow. The legendary Canadian software roll up.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_01: The very same. So that tells you something about this strategic playbook and ambition here.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: They're clearly thinking along similar lines and they are selective.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_00: Sources say they've looked at something like 1400 to 1700 firms over the years.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_00: And acquired how many?
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: Around 120. So a very disciplined approach. Not just buying anything, the moves.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_00: That's a tight filter. Okay, what about going internationally?
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_01: You said US, UK, Canada is that just opportunistic or is there a strategy?
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_01: Definitely strategic.
[00:05:40] Not willing, nilly, as one source put it. Take the US, for example.
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: They didn't just plan to flag anywhere. They started in specific cities.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: Burbank, Woodland Hills and LA, St. Petersburg and Florida,
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_00: Corrine, North Carolina.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: What's the connection?
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_01: High densities of Australian expats.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_00: Ah, so they leverage that existing cultural connection and network.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_01: Exactly. Helps maintain their company culture apparently and gives them a warmer entry point.
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_00: Their recent deal show this geographic spread.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_00: San Angelo, Texas, St. Pete, Florida again, Swansea in the UK,
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: and another one back in Sydney, Australia.
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_00: Those four alone added nearly $5 million in revenue in the last half year report.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_00: Clever way to de-risk international expansion.
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_01: And there was talk of them maybe listing in the US eventually.
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_01: What would that achieve?
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's been floated.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: Potential benefits. More visibility, obviously.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: Easier to use their stock to pay for US acquisitions,
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_00: maybe give US partners equity and access to US debt markets for funding deals.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_00: But it could also push the valuation up even higher rate.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_01: Potentially, yes.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_00: It's a trade off.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: Speaking of valuation, let's get into the financials and that valuation elephant.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: The latest numbers first from the half year ending,
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: Dessing 31, 2024.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_01: How did they look?
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_01: Pretty solid, actually.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: Revenue was up almost 23% to just under $65 million AUD.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: Profit attributable to the KPG holding company owners
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: that rose about 28% to $2.5 million AUD.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: There's another metric they use underlined impata attributable to owners
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: that was up 12% to nearly $5 million AUD.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_00: And Pada.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_01: Net profit after tax before amortization.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_01: That's the one.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: And importantly, owners earnings, basically the cash flow available to the group.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_00: That was up over 26% to about $14 million AUD.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: So strong growth across the board.
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_01: How much of that was buying firms versus organic growth?
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_01: Good question.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_00: Organic growth was about 4.0%.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: The rest 18.8% came from acquisitions made during the period.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_00: As of December, they had 35 offices and 104 equity partners.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_00: Okay, strong numbers.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_01: But let's talk valuation.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_01: You mentioned it's not cheap.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's putting it mildly.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: Market cap around $530 million AUD.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: Call it $350 million US dollars.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_00: And the multiples.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: Well, if you just look at a database, you might see an EBITDA multiple around 17X.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: But remember, KPG only owns 51% of the underlying firms' earnings streams.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: So the effective multiple they're paying on the cash flows they actually get is much higher.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: More like 3435 by EBITDA.
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_00: Wow.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_01: That's steep and price to earnings.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: One source mentioned a PE of 170X.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_00: Now that might be based on statutory earnings, which can be lumpy.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: But whichever way you slice it, it's high.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_00: So how do you justify that?
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: Is it just a case of you pay up for quality and growth?
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_01: That's essentially the argument from the sources.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_00: It's expensive relative to peers like SEBAs, maybe.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_00: But on an absolute basis, if you believe in the long-term compounding potential in this huge
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: fragmented market and you believe in their model, maybe that premium is warranted.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: It's a bet on execution and a long runway.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: And they stopped paying dividends recently, but they are buying back shares.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: Correct.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: Dividend stopped in Feb, 2024.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: They did buy back about 100,000 shares in that half year period,
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_00: average price $7.79 AUD.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: So signaling confidence and maybe preferring buybacks to dividends for now,
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: reinvesting and growth.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_00: What about debt?
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_01: Are they leveraged up to the help to do all these deals?
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_01: They're gearing ratio net debt to underlying EBITDA did take up a bit to 1.49X,
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: but it's still well within their bank covenants.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_00: And the structure is usually that the debt taken on for an acquisition
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_00: is paid down by that acquired firm's own profits over, say, four or five years.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so manageable.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_01: And you might see negative tangible assets on the balance sheet.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, negative 74.55 cents per security.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_00: That's pretty typical for rolloffs like this.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: They buy businesses, goodwill and intangibles pile up on the balance sheet.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't mean much on its own.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: Cash flow is the thing to watch.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_00: Right. Focus on the cash generation.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's shift to risks and the longer term outlook.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_01: What could derail this CampyGee story?
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_01: Well, one obvious risk is losing focus.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_00: They're building this great engine for acquiring and improving accounting firms.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_00: What if they get tempted to stray too far, move into wealth management,
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: insurance, investment advice, things that aren't their core competency?
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: Are you doing that?
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_01: They are testing some ancillary services, but mostly in Australia for now.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: The source that suggests they're being thoughtful,
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_00: not just jumping in everywhere, but it's definitely something to watch.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: Stick to your knitting, right?
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_01: What about external threats?
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_01: This raises an important question.
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_01: AI, artificial intelligence, and maybe, just maybe,
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_01: government simplifying tax codes someday, could that kill the accounting business model?
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_01: It's the perennial question, isn't it?
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_00: The counterarguments we found are pretty consistent.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_00: First, technology usually augments jobs like accounting.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't eliminate them.
[00:10:26] Think typists are becoming word processor operators,
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_00: or lawyers using legal tech.
[00:10:32] Accountants might just get more productive.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: Which could actually help KPG's margins in the near term.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_01: Could be a tailwind for the next three or five years, yes.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_00: Second, tax simplification.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: Well, let's just say the lobbying power of the financial industry
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_00: makes major simplification seem unlikely.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: Complexity tends to breed more complexity.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_00: Fair point.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: And third, back to that client's dickiness.
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_00: The risk and hassle of switching accountants are just so high,
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_00: fear of audit, screwing up finances.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_00: It creates a powerful moat, regardless of tech changes.
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so the core business seems reasonably resilient.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_01: What about leadership?
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_01: Brett Kelly, the founder.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes founders can be promotional.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_01: Any concerns there?
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: It's something that comes up.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_00: He's very visible, active on social media,
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_00: has his own company podcast.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_00: But the source is also a point to his transparency.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: He publishes this detailed owner's manual,
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: discloses his own stake around 48%.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_00: Even talks about his personal share sales.
[00:11:26] So putting it out there.
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: And what's perhaps more compelling is the consistency over time.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: His message hasn't really changed.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_00: And his actions, like physically moving his family to the US
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_00: to oversee that extension,
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_00: that signals serious long-term commitment.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_00: He owns nearly half the company.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: His incentives are aligned.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: That skin in the game is significant.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_01: Huge.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_01: Plus, he's apparently already appointed a successor internally
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_00: and is training people up.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_00: Seems like he's trying to build something that outlasts him,
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_00: a generational company, not just flip it.
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_00: Interesting.
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_00: And I heard something about him studying McDonald's.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_01: How does that fit in?
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, apparently he's looked closely at McDonald's model,
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_00: especially regarding geographic density,
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_00: clustering branches,
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: and even owning the underlying real estate we're possible.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_00: So thinking about physical assets and network effects.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_00: Fascinating comparison.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's crystallize the main risk.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_01: If we look out five years,
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_01: and KPG has stumbled,
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_01: what's the most likely reason based on our sources?
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_01: The biggest threat seems to be
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_00: that loss of focus we talked about.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_00: Either chasing bigger deals too soon,
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: moving up market,
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_00: where competition is tougher and integration harder,
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: or diversifying into too many non-core services
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_00: before they've really nailed their current expansion plans.
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_00: So deviating from the discipline playbook that got them here.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_01: You'd want to watch their acquisition announcements,
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_00: their press releases.
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_00: Are they sticking to small accounting firms
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: in their target geographies?
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_00: Or are they suddenly buying, I don't know,
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_00: a big consulting firm or something completely different?
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_00: That would be a warning sign.
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: Got it.
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_00: So let's wrap this up.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: What does this deep dive into Kelly Partners' group mean
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_01: for you, the listener?
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_01: Well, I think KPG really shows how even in a sector
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: that might seem a bit state or traditional,
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_00: like accounting.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_00: Dare I say boring?
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_01: Huh.
[00:13:10] Maybe.
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_00: But even there, a really smart strategy
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_00: focused on operational excellence
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_00: and getting the incentives right with partners
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_00: can unlock some pretty surprising growth.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_00: Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_00: What other boring businesses out there
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_00: are just waiting for a similar approach?
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_01: Waiting for someone to find that secret sauce.
