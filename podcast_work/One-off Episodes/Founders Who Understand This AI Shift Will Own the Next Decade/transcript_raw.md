[00:00:00] Startups can actually outrun these big companies in a way that was just never economically feasible before.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_01: You could actually go and compete in almost any category on the dimension of people are missing this whole thing.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_01: I really think that there will be hundreds of companies that are all 1 billion market cap,
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_01: 5 billion market cap, 10 billion market cap and beyond, that basically are just
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_01: there's near-infinite opportunity for new startups to emerge on the basis of
[00:00:29] Hello and welcome to a 16z speedrun office hours where we connect founders with some of the
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: brightest minds in tech. Our guest today is Aaron Levy, the co-founder and CEO of Box,
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_00: which if you don't already know, is a content and collaboration platform that powers over 120,000
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_00: organizations around the world. Aaron, welcome, thanks for joining us. Thanks for having me.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_00: It's interesting that you're actually still a young guy only a few years older than me and
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_00: it's probably similar to Andrew. What you've been running Box is 2005, which is almost exactly half
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: your life. If you could compare the world with us now to the world that was back then,
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_00: what do you think about the startup experience has changed? My biggest takeaway actually is I
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_00: feel really old. I appreciate that you're using your age as the anchor for what young is, but
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_01: I think unfortunately I tend to feel very old now. I am so impressed and excited by so many of
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: these young founders right now. What's interesting is that in 2005, so we dropped out of college
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: our middle of our junior year and in 2005, it was fairly rare to drop out and be 20 doing a startup.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_01: There were a few dozen of us in the Silicon Valley at that time. I think prompted probably
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_01: mostly by Facebook had made dropping out like a thing, but it was still a relatively rare event.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_01: And what is so fascinating now is the amount of now 20 year olds that are dropping out. It is
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: just like now a standard playbook for these kids. I think it's super exciting how
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_01: just how many young people are getting started and jumping right into building startups.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_01: I do tend to feel pretty old, but the playbook seems incredibly different. The way that startups
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_01: are being run right now is the most different than any other period of technological change that I've
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_01: ever seen. If you looked at how we ran Box in 2005 and you compared us to a startup 10 years prior,
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_01: so let's say you took the 1995 company and the 2005 version of a startup. It actually wasn't that
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_01: different. At least in 2005, it was a little bit right before the Cloud Wave. We still went to
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_01: data centers. We racked servers. We coded morning and night. We were a startup. But if you
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: kind of looked at how we ran the company in 2005 compared to 95, it would almost look exactly the
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_01: same. The way that every 95 startup got started looked exactly like how we got started and ran the
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_01: business. If I compare the 2025 startup to us in 2005 or let's say the 2015 startup, so if you
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_01: just use 10-year increments, it is the most different that I've ever seen in the history of my
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_01: adult life and doing technology now for 27 years, let's say. It's simply because of this AI
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_01: first orientation where you can be a 3, 5, 10 person team and have the output of a 50 or 100 or
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_01: 200 person team. That just changes everything about how you run these businesses. I'm wildly
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_01: impressed by these startups. I also think some of them are just totally crazy and unhinged.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_01: But it's fun to watch and fun to learn from, but it is the most different that I've ever seen
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_01: how to build a company today. On that point, it's kind of interesting. In the case of
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_02: reviewing your co-founder, you guys dropped out. If you had the ability to force multiply with
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_02: AI agents, for example, I'm curious what you're seeing. I think you wrote about this recently,
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_02: how some of these startups are in particular, I think, doing things in the background, or they're
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_02: using AI agents in interesting ways. What's been the most craziest thing you've ever seen so far?
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_02: Well, if you just take the basic premise and then draw it out. When we started Box,
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_01: our rate of progress as a startup was 100% correlated to how many hours we could be on a keyboard
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_01: and type things. That was the only point of leverage we had was how fast we could type text
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_01: into a keyboard. We could be typing code, we could be typing marketing assets, we could be
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_01: typing blog posts, we were managing servers, but the four of us, we all kind of dropped out,
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_01: we lived and worked in this renovated garage, live work kind of thing. That was the only
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_01: speed at which we could execute was how fast we could work on computers. The startups that I'm talking
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_01: to now, this is not exclusively the case, but let's say it's increasingly the case,
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_01: it seems like there's now a new sense where the startup founders and the early employees,
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_01: and I think this basically sort of scales to every industry over time, they're more managers of work,
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_01: and the work is being done by agents, and so they're no longer rate limited by how quickly
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_01: they can type and how quickly they can write code and how quickly they can come up with marketing
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_01: assets. They are deploying agents to go and do a lot of that work, and I was talking to a startup
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_01: founder recently that claims at least, and I basically believe it, he's just reviewing thousands
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_01: of lines of code a day that the agent did, and the ability to be an editor or reviewer is like 10x
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_01: the leverage of the person who actually has to create the thing. If you kind of have that as
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_01: your mental model where this person now is the editor or orchestrator reviewer of code,
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: and they can go on and deploy multiple agents, so they're no longer rate limited by, again,
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_01: one terminal, one user interface that they can interact in, you can only type in one IDE at a time
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_01: as an individual programmer, but I can review, I can have lots of agents from now running in the
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: background, I can go review their work, when they're all done, that's just a totally new form of
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_01: leverage. Now the bottleneck is just reviewing code, orchestrating it, integrating it, kicking off
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_01: agents, the bottleneck is not just how much code have you written. I'm mostly seeing it on the
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_01: engineering side, so the big benefit is it's giving startups a new form of leverage that never
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_01: existed in the startup world. Usually you have this deficiency as a startup, which is you have two or
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_01: three people and you're attacking some big incumbent that is 100 times more people, and you can
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_01: basically move faster than that incumbent, but that incumbent can always deploy more resources.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_01: Well, we are increasingly neutralizing that delta because of agents. We're not fully there because
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: agents make mistakes, there's not a panacea, a lot of people describe it like a slot machine,
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_01: you have to keep trying over and over again and seeing what the agent comes back with, but you can
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_01: kind of squint and sort of see what this could turn into, which is imagine a world where the agent
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_01: could do a few thousand lines of code that was really high quality and adhere to your code-based
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_01: standards, and it really worked and you reviewed the code and you only changed a few things,
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_01: well that would mean that you do have now 10x the engineering capacity as a startup, which mean
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_01: you could actually go and compete in almost any category on the dimension of scale and speed,
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: which would change everything about competitive dynamics. And then as an interesting just asterix,
[00:08:11] the big companies find it very, very hard to actually go and equivalently do that because
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: they have a lot of workflows, a lot of processes that are so wired in how they already operate,
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_01: that they won't be able to make the change fast enough. So you have a window where startups can
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_01: actually outrun these big companies in a way that was just never economically feasible before,
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_01: and it's effectively all due to AI agents. So again, starting in code, but I think the most
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_01: kind of wired-in companies are figuring out how to do this in marketing, they're going to figure out
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: how to do in legal work, they're going to figure out how to do in outbound sales, so that will be
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_01: a pretty interesting application of the startup formation. I guess the number one wonder about Aaron
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_02: is that we've always talked about before that sometimes everyone wants to work at the work at the
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_02: speed of strategy, and they want to be able to work at the speed of creativity and thought. Nobody
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_02: wants to spend all their time writing, marketing, and copy, unless you're Silicon Valley's favorite
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_02: internet comedian Aaron Levy. I do think that there is this question though that if you are now
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_02: going to be more strategic though, the decisions you make actually matter quite a bit. You might
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_02: really mess up, and then luckily it doesn't cost that much, but you're still going to mess up,
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_02: and in fact really the speed of creativity and the chessboard actually matters more.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think one thing that is interesting is the tendency appears to be that the way you're
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_01: building software now, at least in these startups, is you get really, really clear prompts or specs.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_01: You get very, very clear ways of working with agents to understand your codebase, to build sub-agents
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_01: at the right parts of your codebase, and there's an increasing view of this sort of spectrum and
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_01: development, which is you write very, very depth specifications about what they're doing.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: The idea of the product engineer, right? The product person actually, the pointy-haired
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_02: Dilbert product manager now truly actually has the power to do their own stuff.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you wait long enough and they become very, very powerful, but yeah, so it turns out if
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_01: you're really good at writing a spec and you're really good at knowing and having cleared about
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_01: what you want to build, that's actually extreme leverage now. So there's a huge premium on knowing,
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_01: on actually being very good at strategy, being very good at what is the market opportunity for
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_01: what you're building, and not just, previously there used to be probably a premium on just like,
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_01: how quickly can I hack something together? Well, now actually because the hacking something
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_01: together is fairly commoditized, the premium is, have you thought through what you're actually
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_01: trying to build, is a real market opportunity for it, is a good idea, does it look good, does it
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: have taste? Like, those are now the new forms of value creation. And so I do think that the companies
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_01: that are really religious about getting that right will be the ones that get ahead in the future.
[00:11:03] I guess the question behind this is, okay, so let's assume that if you're a startup, you effectively
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_02: have all these tools at your disposal, you could obviously adopt one of the bigger folks, right?
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_02: And then the issue is that you've argued around this idea of like sort of AI context rot,
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_02: which basically like the way to solve that is to actually have these sort of like point solutions
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_02: potentially, or like great sort of well designated agents as opposed to having the single sort of
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_02: ultimate, the ultimate fighter, you actually have like a team of adventures to go and help you in
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_02: the world of AI. I guess like if you're that startup, right? And you're trying to figure out like
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_02: what's the agent architecture that you kind of ship with first, what's the fast way to get off
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_02: the rails. It's one of these things where you know, it's at what point do you just give up everything?
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_02: And at what point do you start filling out, you know, do you just start with like a basic toolkit,
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_02: for example? Well, the point I was making in that context is not so much about the number of tools
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_01: you use as much as as the need for specialization and some in some virtual or or very tangible way.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: And so like for instance, Cloud Code has created a way to have that virtual specialization by just
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: letting you go and create sub agents that own a particular part of your code base or a particular
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_01: part of your workflow. And that's sort of how you resolve the context rot issue within within the
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_01: Cloud Code kind of paradigm. So so it's not so much that you want a tool for everything. It's
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_01: that it's that we have a very real issue, which is this, you know, like super powerful super agent
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_01: doesn't exist, doesn't work. And so you do have to have some degree of specialization. And that
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_01: specialization can come, you know, in a variety of packages. I think there's like there's a YouTube
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_01: video on every every way to solve this. And you ask, you know, three startups or five startups,
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_01: you're going to get three or five different answers. And it's totally fine because this is sort of
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_01: this is the stage where everybody's kind of figuring out the best practices. And it's all emerging
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: right now. But I don't have a I don't I can't give any kind of general principle on that because
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_01: it's just different by team by company by by what tool you choose. But it would seem that at the
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_02: very least your perspective is there is definitely not like this is not just going to be able to go
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_02: and benefit in comments. There's this unique opportunity. If you could be one of those specialized
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_02: tools as a startup. Yes. That's you're in a really, really good spot. Like you can basically remake
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_02: the whole area of the stack. Like the. Now if I flip it, if I flip it a little bit because I was
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_01: mostly answering the question through the lens of generically speaking the fact that AI startups can
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_01: move 10 times faster than an incumbent. That's fantastic. Now if you think about it, no, okay,
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_01: what does that mean in terms of what you should build? How should you compete in this market? You
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_01: what like I think there's infinite, you know, that's obviously, you know, little hyperbolic,
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_01: but there's near infinite opportunity for new startups to emerge on the basis of we are going to
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_01: see a complete shift in the in the software landscape because so many so many industries and parts of
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_01: business that previously didn't have software now will have software in the form of AI agents for
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_01: the first time ever. And if I look at like most domains of knowledge work will have a some kind of
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_01: agent that is associated with that type of knowledge work. In convents will take some categories,
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_01: but there'll be startup opportunities in every single category for basically building agents that
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_01: do knowledge work. And the first ones that that have reached some degree of critical mass or
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_01: coding agents. And there's been, you know, very clear startup opportunities in the form of
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_01: repolate cursor, Windsor, lovable cognition like like holy crap, if we had said 10 years ago that
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_01: there'd be 20, 30, 40 billion dollars of market cap in the coding space. And we would have been like,
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_01: well, kind of get up is the only thing that's ever really even exited in the coding space. How could
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_01: there be 30, 40, 50 billion dollars within just a three year period that wouldn't sound plausible?
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_01: And so, and yet that that's not only happening, but it's actually just scratching the service.
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_01: I am perfectly comfortable underwriting a couple hundred billion dollars of market cap in the AI
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_01: coding space that don't go to incumbents purely because there's just so much service area, so much
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_01: tam that needs to exist. Okay, now do that for every single field. Do that for for life sciences,
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_01: do that for health care, do that for legal work, do that for consulting. There is going to be
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_01: new AI agent companies in every single one of those spaces and not only will they outrun the
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_01: traditional software incumbent companies, they'll actually, they're going to outrun the
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_01: traditional services companies in those spaces as well. And, and it's just a completely new
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_01: environment for startups to emerge. You said something at the beginning, the beginning of this
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_00: conversation that I thought was interesting, which was when you talk to founders, you feel like
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: you're you're doing the learning about 70% of the time. I was curious if there's anything that
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_00: comes to mind, like what are you learning from kind of the new generation of founders when you
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_00: do speak with them? Yeah, I think it's mostly, I mostly just have to rethink the leverage that you
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: get from from agents in every in every conversation. So, so if I if I took an example conversation,
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: I would have had with a founder a year ago and you say, hey, how are you using AI? And again,
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_01: the standard at that point would have been get up co-pilot, maybe if you use it on cursor,
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_01: they would say, yeah, I'm getting 10 or 20% productivity gains. It's really helping me with,
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_01: you know, type ahead auto complete functionality. It's it's like replaced me needing to Google,
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_01: you know, when I have a when I have a search, when I have a coding question. Now, if you ask the
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_01: most advanced startup founders, you know, how are they using AI, it's back to this point. It's it's not a
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_01: it's not a it's not a 20 30% you know, form of leverage. It's a possibly a three to five to 10x
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_01: form of leverage because of this ability to have background agents. But the problem is, again,
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_01: in your existing teams and your existing organizations, your existing way of doing engineering is not
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_01: wired up for kicking off lots of background agents to go and execute on your code base. Your
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_01: code base isn't designed in that way. You don't have the documentation in the code base in a lot of
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_01: times to support agents to go and operate on the code base. You don't probably have the tool stack
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_01: to be able to do that. You haven't done the engineering methodology change to enable, you know,
[00:17:31] dozens or hundreds of people to go do all this at once. It actually is something that that benefits
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_01: a small team where where they're not going to have all these conflicts happening at all time
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_01: across all these agents. And so and so this is something that naturally is advantaged for the
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_01: smaller to start up to be able to move quickly on. And so when I'm talking to startups, I'm mostly
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_01: just learning, how are you doing that? Like and then trying to figure out like, what's my way of
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_01: bridging our company to do that as quickly as possible? So we can we can take, you know, a lot of
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_01: the benefit of these learnings and port them into how we run box. That makes so much sense.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_02: All right, so let's let's you know, circling back to the first of our very first question.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_02: I'm curious how you're thinking about if any like important things you think folks
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_02: and you know, obviously we've talked about leverage agents, the ability to basically be
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_02: you're a two person start. So actually choosing your founder really matters a lot more.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_02: Yes. Effectively that's equal to like 2000 people.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: But I mean like thinking through that that that paradigm now like if you were, you know,
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_02: picture Aaron from dropping out now, right? What would you, what would you tell Aaron now?
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. We've already talked a lot about it, but what are the sort of like more basic
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_02: building block things? Maybe I think anything changed there. I think a lot of the core principles
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_01: of company building are relatively, you know, timeless and they transcend any particular technology
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_01: wave. Yeah. Yeah. To your exact point, you know, team probably matters more than ever before because
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_01: of the leverage on your on your co founders or co founding team. So so that I think that's a great
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_01: insight. So that was yours. So so like I just would underscore that point. What what a market,
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_02: for example, like some folks have said, you know, try to find the most highly specialized really
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_02: boring market on the planet to find regulatory capture, maybe. Or you like forget about that.
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_02: That's like a word for you. No, no, no, so, so okay. So so there's well there's some things that
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: are downstream from you have the idea, but if you want to go all the way up to you don't have the
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_01: idea yet, then I'll maybe we'll start there. I think I really think that there will be hundreds
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_01: of companies that are all 1 billion market cap, 5 billion market 10 billion market cap and beyond
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_01: that basically are just they're taking a job function in the economy and they're building an agent
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_01: for that job function. And they're selling that agent to corporations, to services firms,
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_01: to system integrators to everybody. And and I think you could literally do maybe in
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_01: Dresden has one of these, you could literally do a a matrix that is every industry and every line
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_01: of every job function in you know, per industry. And it would be like it would be literally
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_01: 5,000 cells. And it would be like there's sales reps in life sciences. There's lawyers in
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_01: financial services and some of the markets, you know, probably will be tam constrained,
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_01: but some will be much bigger. Some need to be kind of like, okay, we have to get the whole horizontal,
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_01: some will have to be what to get the whole vertical. But I think you could very easily go through
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_01: the entire economy and underrate AI agents for any one of those slots in the economy. And
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_01: you know, if I had to literally start from scratch, I'd probably be looking at that matrix and saying,
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_01: okay, is this is there an industry I know extremely well? And that I can go and and kind of
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_01: really reverse engineer like, what does the work look like in that industry and build an agent for
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_01: that? Jared Friedman had this great tweet. He said, why commentator? And he basically said, like,
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_01: go do the job of what you want the agent to go and automate and be like the like the expert in
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_01: how to do that job. And then you're going to be very potent at being able to go and create an
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_01: agent to do that job, right? And so, you know, probably like the best case scenario is you've
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_01: already done that job in the past and you just go and build an agent for the work you already know
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_01: how to do. Second best scenario, have a co-founder that has done that. Third best scenario, go literally
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_01: find a way to like do that, you know, shadow somebody, do it all day long. And then and then the
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_01: opportunity is can you can you make an agent that is like the the life sciences FDA regulatory
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_01: review agent? Can you go do the I am the, you know, legal review case agent? Right. And there's
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_01: going to be again, there's going to be a lot of flame outs, you know, in this space that are
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_01: again, like they just didn't nail the scale. It wasn't the right market fit. You know, the
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_01: tam wasn't big enough. There'll be lots of that. But then there's going to be a lot of surprises
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_01: where it'll turn out that there's more categories than we think. Where right now the supply
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_01: demand equilibrium in the economy is actually not sort of as sort of kind of perfect as we would
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_01: have imagined. Where if somebody could have introduced labor at a tent of the cost that it previously,
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_01: you know, was was priced at that there would be actually, you know, 50 x of the demand for that
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_01: particular form of labor. That's right. And so like you all of a sudden be like, okay, I'm a legal
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_01: review agent. And it turns out that like traditionally legal review cost, you know, $2,000 per hour or
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_01: a thousand dollars per hour for high end work. Now the agent can do that for five or $10 an hour.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_01: And it just turns out that like we didn't actually have as many lawyers as the world needed.
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_01: It was just that they were so expensive. So nobody could actually afford them. And then boom,
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_01: there's an explosion of this new category of everybody's filing patents now. Everybody is going to
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_02: be an investor of some sort. Yeah. Like I can name I can name I can name a bunch of use cases even
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_01: internally. I'm not going to, you know, give too many startup ideas out there. But but I can
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_01: I can name a bunch of ideas internally where if if the cost of the particular function was a
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_01: tenth of the price, we would we would spend we would we would have many more kind of full-time
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_01: people equivalent of that function. It's just it's too inefficient right now. And so it is always
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_01: at the bottom of our our stack ranking budget planning list. So we never get to it. But if it was
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_01: an AI agent that could be compressed at a tenth of the price, then we actually would be spending
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_01: on the agent and amazing. There's no ceiling. There's no ceiling to the ROI potentially right.
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_02: There's no ceiling to the ROI and there's no minimum floor price to get started. And that's the
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_01: like people are missing this whole thing like like to hire a person costs 100 200 300 $3,000 or whatever
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: depending on the function to bring in an agent might cost a thousand dollars. And so you will start
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_01: using them in use cases that you never hired the person for. And that will then all of a sudden
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_01: it'll it'll kind of reduce the bottlenecks in your business in ways that you didn't anticipate
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_01: which then will cause you to actually go and fund those areas even more. So I think there's a lot
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_01: of opportunity that will kind of look like that. But again for an industry for a job function
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: and I think there's endless opportunity you know in in that general space.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah I look forward to after this there's a glut there's also there's this giant surplus of young
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_02: 20 somethings who end up as like admins and FDA regulated back offices. Yeah and I know
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_02: the people come from like oh Aaron sent me okay I'm just they're just here they're really excited
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_02: to go and work here. I really love our industry. I mean I mean what we probably need is like we need
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_01: this like pairing mechanism between maybe you guys started it's like you're you're a strong you're
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_01: like very clearly essential casting CTO you know founder you dropped out of MIT and then you pair
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_01: them with somebody who just like you pluck them out of Pfizer and you're like you know how to do
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_01: regulatory review processes right right we're just going to match and then there's just it's just
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_01: a matchmaking service between the person that knows how to build agents and the experts in the
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_01: workflow and we just go create a hundred of these. Well so I'm curious to hear about this right like
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_02: because box started out as a in the consumer world then you guys went to enterprise and in the past
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_02: even Mark Mark himself over you know at Reese Horowitz once said he's like you know really great
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_02: founders actually start out in consumer just because it's so hard to do consumer you have to build
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_02: products it's very difficult to do but in this wave obviously with AI agents it's way more focused
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_02: on enterprise and we're sort of making a tack where we kind of push toward toward toward toward
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_02: toward basically enterprise how do you think about consumer do you still think that like that's
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_02: a proving ground or is it one of those things where it's like hey that's you know that's just a
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_02: complete different world that we know and knows how that's going to change as a world today.
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_02: I think I think there's plenty of consumer opportunities I don't think I would sort of pre-plan
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_01: the pivot so like I was not planned Aaron it kind of breaks the definition of a pivot.
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah that's right. So okay in six months now we are going to pivot the company but we're going
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_01: to first start in a different state. So I would say that it's probably still very good advice
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_01: if people do need to pivot but I think there's going to be plenty of consumer opportunities
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_01: and I'm partial to the enterprise because it's a space that I spend a lot of time in I think that
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_01: I think you know by TAM I would largely bet on AI being a breakthrough for the enterprise market
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_01: by just sheer size of the TAM simply because you know AI is like fundamentally a form of productivity
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_01: and productivity generally shows up in a meaningful way in the enterprise in the consumer space
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: it's sort of like not a thing that we think about as much so I just think like most of the use
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_01: cases tend to lean enterprise you know and it's interesting Dario from Anthropic had a
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_01: had a point on a recent podcast that I just I think is the most salient way to think about it which
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_01: is you know if they improve if inthropic improves the AI model from basically being like a
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_01: an undergrad in chemistry to a grad student in chemistry the consumer won't notice
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_01: at you know in claw.ai like there's no there's no question you're going to ask about chemistry
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_01: in your personal life that that sort of is going to require that PhD level I mean you know
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_01: barring you have some deep healthcare in a related issue yeah yeah but the the the PhD jump is
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_01: going to have massive gains for Pfizer and and the life sciences industry and so just if you
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_01: think about where we are in the kind of progress of AI like I think like most most of my I'm going
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_01: to just pick on her just because it's it's you know kind of makes the point like my mom's AI
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_01: use cases are like they're like fully solved like we're done like she doesn't she wouldn't be fine
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_01: she would be fine if GPD5 was just like the like the last thing that AI ever produced
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_01: because it's already solving every problem because she's not no more chemistry questions
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_02: she's she's done with her chemistry questions she's not trying to create a new life sciences drug
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_01: even even in my personal life like for parenting let's say I think AI could stop right now
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_01: and it would already have been a huge a huge not positive for me and and like like we'll make
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_01: songs for the kids we draw things we get stories made like I don't need stories to be any better
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_01: for my six-year-old like we have reached we have reached the full saturation of capability that
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_01: is needed in most of my personal life but again you go to a law firm and you're and you're like hey
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_01: I ran this contract through an AI model and it's like well there's like 70 mistakes so by definition
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_01: and back to the original point by definition most AI progress is going to now amortize
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_01: in into enterprise use cases so from here on out it's an enterprise you know kind of industry
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_01: you know with with again plenty of opportunity for starting consumer companies to be clear
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_01: but it's not because we needed the PhD thing it's because we needed new packaging
[00:29:07] in a consumer app that that sort of brought this experience together in a better or a new way
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_01: I mean this is the tear it is the sort of test that I was checking we have Terry Tau the Australian
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_02: mathematician right like says something then then I'm just like oh things are going really well he's
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_02: going to get us warp engines very soon so so I guess I curious how you think about the we talk
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_02: about this a little bit which is that like you should have product insights but in addition to
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_02: product insights you sort of need distribution insights yes and it doesn't seem like this is like
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_02: a big debate where some people say AI is providing some clear product insights but it hasn't
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_02: changed the world of distribution anyway but we obviously see some natural adoption of AI tools
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_02: but curious how you think that might evolve is it because like you know we're just waiting for
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_02: things to platform and then we'll have distribution insights in that regard or do you think that
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_02: actually it's a whole new ballgame we're thinking about it like radio and television right now
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_02: I am going to take the I'm going to sound really lame and possibly you know possibly very
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_01: wrong in five years from now I don't think distribution changes that much oh interesting okay I think
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_01: that the you know there'll be new channels like you'll you'll you'll be like I'd like to show up in
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_01: the open AI app store you know Asian store like like there'll be new ways that you think about
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_01: getting distributed but but I don't think this is a fundamental and like you know transformation
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_01: or disruption of the distribution model of tech if you're consumer you better figure out how to go
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_01: viral if you're enterprise you better figure out how to do a you know build a go-to-market machine
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: if you're if you're fortunate and you're kind of like and you're like enter pricey but your
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_01: audience is is somewhat technically savvy or or able to do self-serve then you'll do PLG plus
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_01: a go-to-market engine but I don't I don't think we're going to see a new invention of go-to-market
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_01: because of AI I don't think AI is a go-to-market related disruption model maybe there's an important
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_01: corollary actually and maybe and this one you're appreciated by AI startups if you build that they
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_01: will not come so so if you think that because you built this amazing agent that now you've solved
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_01: your problem like that is like totally you're gonna fail like like you you are gonna be drowned
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_01: out by 10,000 other startups and priorities that companies deal with all day long so if you do
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_01: not think about distribution then then you it just won't work and yeah yeah and I think we might
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_01: have a little bit of an over orientation toward the hey I made this really viral video and
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_01: everybody saw it and I got all the likes and that's not distribution that's like a cool one-time
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_01: marketing stunt like distribution is is just the grinding of like like you know the way I kind of
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_01: think about it and I think AI affords this quite quite effectively you have to own an audience
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_01: there has to be a universe of people that are just so passionate about the thing that that
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_01: you're building you need to figure out how to just continue to keep access to that relationship
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_01: so you better own your community via LinkedIn and X and Reddit and wherever those people are
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_01: and and you need to find a way to like just bear hug them as an as an industry or as a cohort
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_01: and and and then that's going to be marketing that's going to be salespeople that's going to be PR
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_01: all the things and and the companies that discount that you're just waiting to be rolled over by
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_01: somebody who has better distribution and just says okay I'm going to get this in the hands of all
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_01: the all the customers I look forward to if every founder basically requiring every employee to have
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_02: worked in that industry as a blah blah blah person and then being like oh I worked in that
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_02: industry for five three four months just like when people say like you know you have to have
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_02: worked in customer service to know how to deal with customers exactly all right Aaron thanks so
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_00: much for doing this that's a great one to end on so we really appreciate you for joining us.
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_00: Thanks guys.
