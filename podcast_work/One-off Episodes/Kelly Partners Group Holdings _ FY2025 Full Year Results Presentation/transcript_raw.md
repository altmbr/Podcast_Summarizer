[00:00:00] Kelly Partners Group.
[00:00:04] Welcome everybody to the FY 25 results presentation for Kelly Partners Group
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_01: Holdings Limited. My name is Brett Kelly, the founder and CEO, and I'm joined by our
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_01: chief financial officer Kenneth Co. Our plan for me is to share the presentation
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_01: which we published this morning and take questions through the chat function of the Q&A.
[00:00:30] I expect we can get through this quite quickly. As our business is very consistent for those
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: that you have followed the business for some time, I think most of what you can see here
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_01: you'll be very familiar with. There are now 660 team members, 102 equity partners across 38
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_01: businesses in five countries and revenue this year grew 25% to 134 million. Our revenue run rates
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: approximately 150 million. We did a first time equity capital raise since IPO of 4 million
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_01: dollars to essentially new partners from firms that had joined the group since 2017's IPO.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_01: And then we have grown free cash flow by 8%. You'll see the reduction in return on invested capital
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: organic growth is up 50% to 4.5% and a return on invested capital plus organic growth
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: remains strong at 27.5%. On slide three, which is shared as we like to do some of the learning
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: that informs our thinking, founders mentality has always been on our book list as a tremendous book
[00:01:50] and it shares the information that is on this diagram that growing companies face
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_01: a choice as a scale to follow the default path or commit to the journey north.
[00:02:04] And the default path you'll see really leads you down a path of struggling bureaucracy and
[00:02:12] the behavior of incumbents or we maintain our insurgent mission and try to scale that mission
[00:02:21] northward. That's not easy but it's worth the challenge and we're in a serious pursuit of that
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: challenge as we speak. Two other books that really inform that is a rack we built by our friends at
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_01: Rackspace and the motive by Patrick Lentiani. What's interesting is that those books
[00:02:58] in particular have for a long time informed that things that will help us maintain this insurgent
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_01: mission. The motive talks about making sure that the people that move through the business
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_01: into leadership positions are there for the right reasons that they have the right motives and in
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_01: our terms that's to make other people better off, to be people for others who keep their promises
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_01: and work as part of a team our three core values. And the rack we built tells the story
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_01: about what goes wrong when a business grows but doesn't maintain that insurgent mentality
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_01: around a talent that it brings in and in particular lateral hires from large companies that
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_01: can push you towards being an incumbent. So onsite five is our familiar Kelly Partners in one page
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_01: for those who haven't seen one of these presentations before the history of pre-IPI and at IPO,
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_01: people would say hey Brett can you give it to us you know short and sharp in one page and so we do
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_01: revenue growth there margins so strongly but our margins parent and pate return on equity net
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_01: that to the two underlying EBITDA remains very conservative at 1.42 times cash flows strongly up 23.3%
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: to good number to watch and cash conversion at 99.8% remains very very efficient.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_01: Down the bottom left-hand corner our buildings per full-time employee still are very high
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_01: and so we can see that the key measures indicate that we are scaling rather than simply growing
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_01: and what I mean by that is that we are scaling our long standing excellent financial metrics
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_01: of the back of our long standing values. On page six it's important to understand that we have
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_01: a business system that knows how to double we believe that because the business has now doubled
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_01: six times in 19 years on average every 3.2 years it's a sustained long standing performance that
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_01: indicates that KPG has a business system that knows how to double itself and whether we have
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: excellent people or doubly excellent people no matter who has been in our team over a very long
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_01: period of time the business is outperformed individuals as the team has deleted the business
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_01: system that creates deep alignment and allows people to be the best versions of themselves at work
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_01: and deliver these industry leading results. On page seven we've seen lots of nice little pictures
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_01: around revenue growth EBITDA, successful programmatic acquisition strategy, higher returns on equity,
[00:06:00] higher returns on invested capital and cash and strong cash conversion and what those numbers
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_01: are I believe a testament to our team and their efforts they are not the business of the business
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_01: they are in outcome. On page eight you'll see again we outlined early on that we had a start-up
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_01: and a foundation phase at IPO we said we'd build a foundation that we believe we could build
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: and then we announced that we believe we could accelerate and in that period from IPO to 2020 we
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_01: grew from 30 million 25 pre-ARCB I think it was 30 in the first year and 55 years later, four years later
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_01: to now 135 and 150 run rate and so it is important to understand that since June 2020 we will
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_01: aground the revenue from say 50 million to 150 million that is revenue that's controlled
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: by the group in tripling that revenue we've done that in a particularly capital efficient
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_01: manner on a per share basis across every metric whether that is EBITDA per share whether that's
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_01: our our strong net profit per share really whichever way we look at it we haven't
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: until the recent part of offer issued a single share and we still have less shares on issue
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_01: than we had an IPO so we've reduced a total number of shares on issues since IPO while taking the
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_01: revenues from 30 to a run rate of 150 million which is obviously in seven years or this is our
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: eight year completed we've taken revenues up by five times now the good news is that when I started
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_01: the business with my wife Rebecca we were told well you can only grow so big so fast so this so
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: that we would never focus and still add on the numbers we believe that if we got the right people
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_01: into the business and built the right system that those that combination with the right
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: clarity around our mission values and vision that that internal momentum would grow the business
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_01: create a flywheel frankly of mission values and vision captured by the right business model
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_01: we believe that the business would have its own internal drive to deliver better outcomes
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: for our people and clients and that that result ultimately whatever the numbers would be and
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_01: that's proving to be the case now our business I would stress is still small in the global context
[00:08:52] global peers are innumerably larger and so we see you know our intention has been to build a
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_01: hundred year business we see 80 years of growth we don't see eight minutes of growth and we see no
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_01: reason to materially change the model that we've developed that really deeply aligns the
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_01: interests between our partners our people our clients at community and obviously our shareholders
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_01: on page nine you'll see KPGs earning power it's always been my view that the whole code is
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_01: pulling together businesses that share the same mission values and vision to improve those
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: businesses and help them deliver better outcomes for our people clients and communities and in doing
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_01: that there's an inherent level of earning power that will sometimes be reflected in in our statutory
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_01: numbers but not often there's all sorts of good stuff that accounting standards require that we
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: dispose in a way that we might not otherwise choose to disclose in order to best represent the
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_01: earning power and the long-term recurring nature of that earning power of the business
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_01: we remain very confident in the model and it's ability to to continue to do really great things
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_01: in the accounting industry for a long time to come on page 10 you'll see some great stuff where
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: profitability remains very strong industry leading profitability and you'll notice that the US
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_01: and Ireland are running it essentially average profitability for their market the challenge will
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_01: be for us to deliver the results there and turn in their profitability around in the way that we
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_01: do in the Australian market over time our development of the business is such that the US businesses
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_01: now as large as Australian business was at IPO took 11 years to get to that position in Australia
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_01: to take in two and a half years to do that in the US that has meant that we've used a little more
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: capital to do that than we did in Australia and we spent less time moving profitability because of
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_01: their confidence in ultimately being able to do that over time and the importance of getting
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_01: to scale to justify frankly existing in this market on page 11 capital allocation will leave you
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_01: new to review but I'm very pleased with how clear that slide is thanks Ken and obviously the
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_01: number sort of the representative there and I hope there is any for shareholders to them to appreciate
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_01: on page 12 we've tried to make clear that the compounded annual gain in book value since inception
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_01: is 35.4% per annum we think that that's a pretty good effort over time and we're confident that we
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: can continue to deliver those types of returns for a long time if we stay within our tiny circle
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_01: of components age 13 and emphasis on very tiny several components we have used a very small
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_01: amount of equity capital to build the business and I'm pleased with the discipline that's been
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_01: demonstrated over a long period of time on page 14 you see EPS and free cash load per share
[00:12:40] continues to grow as the business grows again it's a video from every month I continue to make
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_01: that happen I'll page 15 you see share by back outline now see the section beginning on 16
[00:13:00] really just shares about the business take this as largely and read and move to a very quickly
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_01: 35 operating businesses on page 17 across these geographies we're particularly pleased with how
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_01: the international growth of the businesses going the robustness of our position in the Australian
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_01: being able to have both of those wings sort of flapping at the same time is a testament
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_01: again to our teams and systems on page 18 and we see the team members office locations,
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_01: client groups etc I'm pointing out there that you know largely this is a recurring
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_01: income business on page 19 we continue to strengthen our position in the Australian market where we
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_01: see we exclude the big four as competitors they're not our competitors we take out index or
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_01: financial planning group might be one other than that we may have that view of and we just look at
[00:14:01] who are actual accounting groups that we're looking we're looking at as competitors and we're
[00:14:08] well positioned versus versus these people absolute sizes is not as important as excellence at
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_01: this point and it's always been our case that if we stay excellent we'll cry and on page 20
[00:14:22] the programmatic nature of our partnership approach I think is quite clear for all to see there
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_01: again we're not looking to just do partnerships for their own sake unless they're the right people
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_01: with a rough values and reasons for joining Kelly Puntles but not particularly interested on page 21
[00:14:47] capital allocation well we'll leave this view to review but on 22 we'll see our
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_01: continued to come performance on this measure on page 23 we have put a new slide in that
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_01: you know I quite like and I hope you like to it shows or we've raised equity pre IPO of 11.6
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_01: we raised equity post IPO of 6.7 million including the rest of 4.2 million
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_01: for total of 18.3 we've done additional investments of 11.3 which is the excess amount
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_01: above the 9% we collect from the partnerships that we've reininvested in the business
[00:15:29] we have a current run rate here but our 52.5 million and after KPG share of that run rate here
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_01: with us about 26 million so for 29.6 million we believe that we'll pull together about 26.8
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_01: million of e but which is great and the second part of this slide we sort of show as I'll talk
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_01: about later in this presentation we're considering our capital structure and the way we think about
[00:15:57] that capital structure is the forever dollar equity we may raise either externally or internally
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: if we add two dollars of debt then these you know we expect to continue to be able to drive a very
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_01: strong return on invested capital and you can see the sort of shares that she's predated in the
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_01: and the buyback I think if we added back the money that we've made on the shares that we
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: bought back Kenny then that total equity plus additional investments you might reduce the
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: profit on buybacks and that number might be even lower and significantly lower so the business has
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_01: been particularly disciplined and and and careful you know with its with its use of capital on page 24
[00:16:42] this is the additional investment slide so I've had the additional investment slide in the past
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_01: I just wanted to have the equity investment slide as well that we've added in there and you'll
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_01: notice that we've significantly invested above the 9% this year but I would I would point to the fact
[00:17:01] that you know in the last five years we've invested about eight million dollars above our 9%
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_01: and we triple the revenue so we don't feel too bad about that on page 25 financial highlights I'm
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: going to hand over to Kenneth Coe our chief financial officer to share some of the highlights
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_01: of the financial highlight thank you Kenny thanks Brett great to speak to everyone again and present
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_00: the financial highlights for the group for the year ended 3rd June 2025 uh oh slide 26 this is
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_00: the financial highlights for the group I won't go through this in detail because as with prior
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_00: years we have slides essentially covering all of these information that's presented here but we
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_00: think that this presents a good summary of the finances of the business for the year on the
[00:18:03] next slide income statement revenue of 134.6 million up 26.5 million or 24.5 percent on the
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_00: prior year driven by both by organic revenue growth of 4.5 percent and contributions from the
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: acquisitions we completed in the prior year and this year just noting that in terms of the organic
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: revenue excluding the impacts of subscale businesses where we have merged those subscale
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: businesses into our larger and more established businesses our organic revenue growth rate was
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_00: 6.2 percent in terms of the acquisitions we completed and the acquired growth of 20 percent this
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_00: mainly comes from the Florida business that we partnered with in August last year and the
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_00: cynicidly firm that we tucked into the business in December last year in terms of the
[00:18:58] operating margin EBITDA margins of the business 38.1 million for the year up 19.2 percent on the
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_00: prior year the margin is as represented earlier 30.8 percent for Australian businesses 28.3 percent
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_00: for the group which we think is strong in terms of the underlying NPADI etch rebuilds share
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_00: hold is increased by 13 percent to 9.1 million compared to 8 million last year as always note that
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_00: the significant increase in amortization expense again due to the acquisitions that we've
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_00: completed resulting in higher customer relationship internal assets recognized
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: that's the income statement on the next slide in terms of the balance sheet our lockup is at 58 days
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_00: again lockup being the the totals of whip days at 7.7 days and dead days at 50.3 days which is
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_00: comparable to what we have in terms of lockup days in the prior years in terms of net debt to
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_00: underlying EBITDA ratio of 1.42 times net debt to underlying EBITDA compared to 1.28 in the
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_00: prior year and and that increases attributed to the acquisitions will complete this year
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_00: we completed six acquisitions this year and as mentioned before mainly into the Florida
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_00: business the Sydney business tuck in as well as the island business that we completed in March this
[00:20:33] our group return equity remains very strong at 38.8 percent per return on equity of 31.9 percent
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_00: our total assets are 199 million increased 24.9 percent again driven mainly because of the
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_00: increase in internal assets from the acquisitions and net debt increased 29.4 percent from the prior year
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_00: on the next slide on debt and liquidity our net debt here on the right compares the net debt position
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_00: as a 3rd of June 2025 to 3rd of June 2024 our net debt is 58.5 million as at 3rd of June 2025
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: compared to 45.2 million last year the increase is 13.3 million as per this note here on the slide
[00:21:28] and is again due to those acquisitions we completed noting that we completed 20 million
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_00: of acquisitions during the year and the net debt increased 13.3 million
[00:21:41] in terms of the gross debt excluding working capital debt it's at 57.6 million
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_00: and it increased 14 million the increases essentially the same as the net debt increase
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_00: so there's no increase in the working capital debt essentially on the left here looking at the
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_00: the dissection of the debt and the cash and headroom that continues to be sufficient headroom at 23.7
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_00: million and we continue to review our capital structure to support our continued growth
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_00: on the next slide in terms of cash flow our cash from operations of 24.9 million increased by 23.3 million
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_00: it's very in line with our revenue growth of 24.5 million our free cash flow to firm after
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_00: schedule debt reductions increased 7.2 percent now that differential between the increase of the
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: 23.3 percent and the 7.2 percent is primarily due to the increase in the schedule debt reductions
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_00: we are paying our debts off in an excellent manner over five years so if you look on the right
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_00: there on that table last year our schedule debt reduction is 8 million and that has increased to
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_00: 11.6 million a 3.6 million increase in the schedule debt reduction in terms of the distributions I
[00:23:02] SPEAKER_00: just want to highlight the distribution to non-controlling interests there is a significant increase
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_00: there there is a round of 2.5 million return of capital that we made prior to tucking in the city
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_00: CBD business and also distributions in general increase to the acquisitions we completed in last
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_00: year and this year in terms of the cash conversion on the left 99.8 percent compared to 96.9 percent
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_00: and very consistent with what we have achieved previously in terms of conversion ratios and
[00:23:39] and the drawn debt primarily used to fund acquisitions and the new fund and buying loans
[00:23:45] on slide 31 parent and MCI waterfall as always we get asked a lot why our 51 to 49 percent equity
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_00: interest doesn't tie to the profit of the pivotal and we have produced this waterfall to explain it
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_00: I just want to go through quickly on the right this waterfall chart this year we have included
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_00: just a priority waterfall so we can have a bit of a comparison you can see that the tax interest
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_00: and depreciation in terms of percentage of the parent net profit before tax is very comparable
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_00: 29.9 percent this year compared to 32.9 percent last year in terms of additional investments
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_00: it's 3.7 million and to support our growth as Brett presented the additional investment slide
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_00: previously we having 2.5 x our business since FY 2023 and I just refer everyone back to that
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_00: slide 24 for that additional investment commentary on the strategic review cost there of 1.2 million
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_00: primary relates to the PCOB audit costs that we undertook this year for the prior two years for
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_00: FY 2023 and FY 2024 for the acquisition costs the six acquisitions we completed this year including
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_00: new regions being in Ireland and also the QDOS network which is a UK so there were some costs there
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_00: in terms of documentation documenting the legal agreements in those jurisdictions and I believe
[00:25:21] that's it Brett. Thank you Penny. That is terrific I appreciate all of Ken's hard work again this year
[00:25:32] he's visited the US and Ireland in other jurisdictions probably a dozen times and has made a huge
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: difference to all of those interactions and is is a valued and appreciated member of our team
[00:25:46] as can alluded to there one of the great achievements and large costs of this year was getting
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_01: agreements up to scratch to operate in the UK and also in England where QDOS is based and also in
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_01: Ireland there was also heavy cost trying to take the PCOB audit looking back two years
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_01: to make us compliant for the United States in terms of their stands. Now I think with that we
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_01: can probably move to slide 33 now 33 just outlines in you know there are some restrictions around what
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_01: we can say but to the degree that we can share it's always our instinct to be very transparent
[00:26:42] we can share that we have undertaken the PCOB audits for the last two years at a great time and
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_01: financial cost of the group which spent a huge amount also on levels in the US over the last two
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_01: and a half years we've done the partners internal capital raise we're doing a strategic review of
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_01: the capital structure at the moment and you know to the right is a sort of slide we shared
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_01: further up but I just want what all of our shareholders to understand that we just won't raise
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_01: equity at any time where we believe the gap between intrinsic value and the equity that we can
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_01: raise the valuation of that equity are as close as possible to each other we did the partners raise
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_01: because we believe that the difference between the intrinsic value and the price which we raised
[00:27:38] was such that the deep alignment that we were creating made up for what we consider was a genuine
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_01: and unacceptable gap as we consider what we do next we're always in a rush to move the business
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_01: forward to really reach its potential and sort of get it to where we think it needs to get to to be
[00:28:03] that scale in search of that we showed you on the early picture from founders mentality
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_01: but we won't move in haste and we won't do things that dilute your interest in mind and every other
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_01: shareholder such that we set ourselves up to have to you know work for the next five years to create
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_01: no real value because we raised equity at the wrong price so we do believe that in terms of getting
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_01: the business to maximize the value of this business model that it owns we should be operating
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_01: at much stronger scale across a number of these markets that would require stronger teams
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_01: investment in teams and infrastructure on the east coast west coast of the US and into the UK
[00:28:54] because I believe that our model is sufficiently unique and proven to just define that investment
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_01: to try and push to to the scale that that we think is possible we look to see this the US
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_01: listed accounting group the only US listed accounting group and they've taken their market
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_01: capital last 10 years from 350 million to you know also 3.5 billion so 10x their market cap
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_01: and by way by much larger businesses it makes pretty clear what the opportunity is
[00:29:28] we think we can follow a similar trajectory but we won't create value per share if we don't
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_01: and can't raise the equity capital at the right price we have to get that piece right and we are deep
[00:29:40] in the development of and we are confident that we will close a large bond raise if we can agree
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_01: the right structure with our existing bank west pack who've been you know from inception our most
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_01: value partner and a wonderful partner we're trying to put in place next generation debt capital
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_01: to allow us to accelerate the opportunity to deploy our law so there's a lot of really good things
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_01: happening we want you to understand that we understand the numbers we consistently run side by
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_01: side raise capital don't raise capital grow at this rate grow at that rate doesn't make any
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_01: difference it doesn't if we don't get if we don't if we don't get that place right and with that
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_01: comment we might go to the chat where I believe we've got some Q&A and so for anyone who wants to
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_01: wants to drop in a question please feel free to and I'll move through them as quickly as I can
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_01: from Arnold how would you characterize the business approach of KPG is it intuitive and adaptive or
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: is it more fixed and mechanical I think I need Arnold you know one of the great books ever written
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_01: Jim Collins book Good to Great was preceded by a book that he collaborated on called Bill T'laas
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_01: and one of the greatest chapters that I read of any book ever is the power essentially the power
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_01: of N N D the answer to most questions isn't either or it's N so we believe that our fixed
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_01: mission values and vision with our fixed approach to focusing on accounting firms two to ten
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_01: million that look after private business owners so that fixed strategy and our fixed 51-40
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_01: known structure make a lot of sense and so to that degree that fits fixed and mechanical but
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_01: where to go who you go with and the timing of all of those things is really a matter of feel
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_01: it is a matter of in of intuition and and being adaptive and of mindset you know when you read
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_01: Steve Schwarzman's book chapter one think big when you read 3G Capital's book chapter one think bigger
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_01: you know it's it's obvious that work on our mindset and our intuition to break out of sort of
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_01: past limiting beliefs particularly as a bootstrap business they're going to be really important
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_01: and in the founders mentality book you know it does talk about I think I think Collins books
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_01: of well and his good great book sort of maintain the core and stimulate for progress is kind of
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: a good way to think about it so I hope that answers a question I'd hate to think that we'd be fixed
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_01: and mechanical and would lose our our intuition and and that we wouldn't be adaptive we still retain
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_01: our courage and energy for for experimentation and a lot of that is around our sense of the
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_01: market sense of what our people need sense of what the clients need now there's also a question
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_01: emailed in the acquisition of Sydney CBD in Bows 100% acquisition and tucking within subsidiaries
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_01: how do you make sure a smooth transition of as one of the strengths of KPUG part as remain
[00:33:08] can we expect more 100% so we we're not interested typically in doing 100%
[00:33:14] acquisition because we'd like to do partnerships and but we will do 100% where it is a tuck into
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_01: existing businesses as Sydney CBD business is a large and very strong business from the perspective
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_01: of the strength of its partners as is the North Sydney business which is involved as well and our
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_01: our businesses the largest business in its region and with this business joining it will be
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_01: you know more than twice as large as any competitor and frankly I think we're building there
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_01: as in many regions as sort of unduplicatable positions so we want to continue that some
[00:33:52] you know that history of smooth transitions but can you a smooth transition is a quality for
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_01: your partner within you know in the words of one of my great heroes who I shat named in fear of being
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_01: told that I've named it you can't do a good deal with a bad person so you know we continue to try
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_01: and do deals with good people the gentleman that other partners in that firm we've been talking to
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_01: since 2020 it's taken six years or five years to get that that that business into our group and
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: we're very very proud of the partners and the people that make out that business another question
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: bread if you would invert what could prevent KPG from becoming a two billion plus company it's a
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_01: great question what can stop a business like ours progressing as it has in the past is if we do
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_01: something transformative so something large and undisciplined that would not be intelligent
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_01: based on the data from McKinsey and you know our observable history across across markets but also
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_01: if we just got outside our circle of competence if we started going off and doing things that we
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_01: don't understand that would be our biggest risk question from Tristan historically domestic funding
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_01: has been non-recourse to the parent acting as an important risk mitigation for the parent company
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_01: interests international funding appears to be recourse to the parents of possible structure
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_01: future and the else that is lower risk it's a great question Tristan the the piece we're working
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_01: on at the moment is a bond that would sit somewhere above the parent wall it's a matter of discussion
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_01: at the moment might have its own financing entity where we aspire to ultimately is to have a
[00:35:36] listed holco probably you know I won't say much more that probably it came as based holco
[00:35:45] and an Australian holco with Australian interests and a global holco with the US and other
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_01: interests maybe US holco UK holco and ultimately for the funding for each market to be attached to
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_01: the holcoes of each of those markets and then down into the subs so it's taking a lot of work to
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_01: try and get that you know the idea of financing it's loving it's down to a degree but it's better to
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_01: do something slumbered well than fast and and any need of repair soon after so it's a very
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_01: the very very good question and we're very very conscious of risk as always
[00:36:26] yeah we think you're a lot about that whatever it's been made to expand the urban
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_01: agriculture to scale deal volume without increasing size of the deals so we are not scaling the
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: M&A deal team at this point to any great degree we have hundreds of millions of dollars of
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_01: incoming leads and yes we should scale that team and we will subject to putting a capital in place
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_01: to do that we need to do the next piece before we do that functions remain centralized to the
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_01: core management team what do not we publish a progress pyramid there's nine parts that are
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_01: centralized and three that are the three that are the focus of the local operating partners are
[00:37:15] their people their clients in the leadership of the brain and to ask the question given the
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_01: additional investment expenditures needed recently would it be feasible to slightly increase
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_01: the central services fee so if we make a commitment to never increase that fee
[00:37:32] we have if anything I aspire to love or not increase it it makes us the amount we deliver for
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_01: that fee again within some duplicatable so we're not uncomfortable with with the return that we
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_01: get in on the capital that we're attaining and we've been encouraged by shareholders to do more
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_01: that against the approach yeah I think I think we're on the right track there I'm not anxious for
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_01: short-term dividends and neither around around major shareholders and communicated that very
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_01: clearly to me they want us to grow and scale in business you know on existing platforming metrics
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_01: Marvin's asked the question Kelpant was as highlight as part of our own dried model was a key with
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_01: US expansion specifically focused on Texas through the growth partnership platform can provide
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_01: in color and how that's progressing furthermore given the recent listing on the OTCQX market
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_01: any color on time-low free US listing so Marvin our partner owner driver models now being
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_01: deployed five times in this market our Texas
[00:38:46] partnership or growth partnership platform has stalled and in that the partner that took that
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_01: on has failed to to be able to grow that that market that's okay we retain we remain keenly
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_01: interested in that with the joining of our recent California business together with the North Carolina
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_01: and Florida businesses we have nearly 9% of all the dollars franchised restaurants as clients
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_01: through their owner operators in the US that gives us virtually a national presence Texas and
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_01: everywhere else and so our focus is really growing that platform business it would have been
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_01: tremendous if that partner had been able to take that forward and it's an example of where we're
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: prepared to experiment but it hasn't here to decide all in growing what we see is the opportunity
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_01: here the OCTQX is great because it allows our employees and and partners to go on their
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_01: Charles Schwabber Council there whatever online platform they're on it simply by the stock that's
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_01: been very good for building relationships in this market and making the company more visible
[00:39:56] listing on a market other than the ASX it might be better for me to put it in those terms
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_01: we continue to investigate to ensure it and come up with the right thing for the company
[00:40:08] Quentin's question what are your thoughts on the development of AI, KBG and your
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_01: accounting industry and keep I calling and tell from me leaving pursuing other professions so two
[00:40:19] pack question we see AI as a real opportunity it's helping us in so many ways like all the technology
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_01: we've ever used I do think it's it's it's even more powerful than other things we've seen before
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_01: and we've recently appointed one of our seniors executives who's been running IT for nearly 10 years
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_01: to lead our approach to AI to give you an example we've mapped the use cases of
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_01: key pieces of AI software across every position in the organisation and are now deploying and
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_01: training our team members in those and call applications will be very very aggressive in the
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_01: adoption of AI we think it makes you like a ten-armed human you know sort of ten arms as a
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_01: plus to somebody big too and and so that mitigates that this the second part of your question you know
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_01: how do you hold on to high quality talent you know I think it's the same as it's always being you
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_01: need to be you know attractive proposition across health wealth and wisdom so bastions are
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_01: spread and what have been the larger challenges associated with the international partnerships
[00:41:31] SPEAKER_01: which have been unexpected successors so the larger challenges are really the cost of getting
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_01: moving in this market personal very heavy on me and the family and just a massive massive undertaking
[00:41:47] however the unexpected successors are that we've you know we build a business now from scratch
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_01: the size of the business that we listed in Australia after 11 years and so there's much more
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_01: commonality in people's values than people might suspect and and our way of working with people
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_01: is welcoming this market and others which is you know tremendous so I um I have to two and a half
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_01: years here I'm blown away by the market opportunity to acceptiveness to KPGs model end and approach
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_01: and could not frankly be more excited about you know what lies ahead well not um you know getting
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_01: in to excited but but for people that none me I'm I have energy and I I'm very very excited about what
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_01: we're doing more excited than ever um to be fair is actually getting a lot easier than it ever has been
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_01: to do what we're doing and there's a lot more interesting more interesting the sector it's more
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_01: accepted what what we're doing and um we get few less brickpats on we do um 10 years ago for
[00:42:55] SPEAKER_01: the approach now our view of what the opportunity is to rob it um hi guys congrats on the result
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_01: can you make any comment about the departure of Lawrence Cunningham from the board if there's any
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_01: skill gap now look it was an amazing privilege to have Lawrence on the board for three years he
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_01: contributed then he's contributing now his introduced us to great people which have helped us level up
[00:43:16] SPEAKER_01: how just understand you what's possible for instance Lawrence introduced us to the senior team at
[00:43:22] SPEAKER_01: Constellation software and allowed Canada to attend in conference in Toronto last October which
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_01: was unbelievable in terms of a life experience um I participated in an interview with um
[00:43:38] with Mark Leonard and it was well received and that's given us a lot of confidence that
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_01: while the right track you know when someone like Mark looks at the business and thinks it's okay
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: that's that's that a personal level very helpful um so you know it was a huge privilege to have
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_01: Lawrence we didn't you know we had no rights we expected his involvement and you know he
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_01: remains in enormous demand he's on the consolation board and now the Mark Kell in Shreds Group board
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_01: he's taken a very senior appointment in academia in Delaware on a called a governance um
[00:44:13] SPEAKER_01: academic role so um you know he simply said to me Brad I you know I can't keep doing everything
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_01: and I can't do the thing that pays me at least so I respect that he's been a huge
[00:44:29] friend of the business and and is continuing to support what we do is our skills gap not at this
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_01: point that was more of a benefit and anything else um to Michael if you're at a raise a hundred
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_01: million there are enough target acquisitions to absorb that much over time their sure is
[00:44:46] Michael um I think BlackRock recently paid two billion US dollars for a firm the markets are
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_01: enormous and I'd be more confident than ever that we could deploy very significant capital at the
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_01: right rate of return to justify the exercise and that we've got the model and experience to
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: to be able to build the team and handle that um to Tristan to extend you can talk about what's
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_01: a state of potential listing the US or Canada can't really talk about it Tristan but we have done
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_01: the PC A, OB audits and invested a lot of time and money in that and that probably tells you something
[00:45:18] to Jack unless I have a question more but thank you got into KPG in the early days of COVID
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_01: after selling some of my shares recently it managed to put together a sizable deposit for my first
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_01: time Jack I'm very very pleased to hear that you know one of the greatest joys of my life is
[00:45:35] trying to you know as I say do business that you know as an Olympian or do the Olympics
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_01: just properly with real commitment to trying to do a good job and make a difference to all of our
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_01: people that work in the business all about partners of the communities that we're in and
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_01: certainly our shareholders so it gives me huge joy um to see that it's one of the many and one
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_01: of the most special benefits of what we do you know I was not a Berkshire meeting in May and
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_01: there was a phenomenal moment where Buffett shared it you know he didn't have institutional
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_01: shareholders and he didn't want them he wanted people to make a difference to and that's what
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_01: kept him going for 60 years it is those sorts of comments Jack that give me it give me a huge
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_01: amount of drive and energy to continue to deliver and you know thankfully I've had many many many
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_01: of those messages and the good news is I hope you've bought a moderate size time so that you can
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_01: stay invested in KBG and other good good businesses where I think you'll be the world wanted over time
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_01: there's still a lot left in in what we're doing um Tristan's that's a question are other firms
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_01: with a strong rates of quick service restaurants holding priority for acquisitions know
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_01: we're very focused on on the McDonald's piece we have about 20% of the franchise all market in
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_01: Australia nearly 10% here we have genuine insight and expertise um and and there's enough
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_01: you know 120 countries with that system um to um to stay very focused we we bought into the Qdos
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_01: network it has 60 firms in 48 countries and it doesn't take it greatly to imagine that
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_01: we might get many of those firms to join us the first one has has joined us on a future of
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_01: 49 basis in the island and that we will get out to them at McDonald's business in each of those
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_01: markets as well um to rob it if the scenario stacks for 100 million capital raises out like the
[00:47:38] SPEAKER_01: scenario continues to in the future but you think this is a one at the type raising or could you see
[00:47:43] SPEAKER_01: yourself raising capital from time to time look I think it's important as Henry Singleton said
[00:47:48] SPEAKER_01: to stay very flexible we put that last last pack so I don't think it serves anyone to say um never
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_01: about anything but you know I I have been an other batch fan of Mark Linett's approach and
[00:48:03] Mark is on the public record saying that his second larger cap raised he probably over raised
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_01: so I believe they raised about 85 million us dollars all time we've raised approximately maybe 15
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_01: maybe less so say 19 million Aussie dollars so maybe 13 million us dollars so we believe there's a gap
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_01: of somewhere between 85 million us and 13 million us um that that we might look to feel some of that
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_01: at some point if we can do it in the right way and then if you could add two to one or even three to
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_01: one debt you would have enormous firepower to grow the business and so when when I'm asked you know
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_01: how do you get from where you are not to sort of see this scale sort of ten times your size and
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: it's no secret that our aspiration has been to be a hundred bagger but you might have you know
[00:49:01] SPEAKER_01: but those who've studied closely might have worked that out um we you know we can conceivably
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_01: you know close close that gap quite easily the numbers are very straightforward if you raise 70
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_01: US to a hundred Aussie call it a hundred Aussie put 200 debt against that's three over to buy six hundred
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_01: of of partnerships at 30% they do two hundred e but uh phone it's a hundred e but uh for the
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_01: you know a hundred um equity that's raised net of say 30% tax you've got 70 empath in times of
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_01: by 50 is three no billion if you don't like that multiple you choose another one and it's certainly
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_01: you know two billion plus so the numbers are very straightforward I don't think having done
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_01: you know more than 50 50 55 partnerships 90 plus part was in in these types of arrangements I think
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_01: whereas experience is anyone in the world in our particular tiny little circular competence
[00:50:05] and that there is the opportunity in the market you know even at 600 million of revenues
[00:50:12] you'd need to find 60 firms with 10 million 120 with five million and we've already found say 50
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_01: so you know when you invest or would have to say that we couldn't in the next 20 years find two
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_01: times the number of firms we've found in the last 20 years and you know I I don't want to
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_01: jinx anything or or be overconfident but I do think it's possible we're more advantage today
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_01: in terms of brand track record expertise access to capital and talent and people quality systems and
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_01: and proven results to to you know sort of I think that through and see if that might be positive
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_01: possible Marvin's asked a question beyond the UK I mean you geographic reach out on the horizon
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_01: what criteria. Marvin we're quite eager to stay very focused in English speaking territories we did
[00:51:04] SPEAKER_01: spend some time in Canada and frankly it was so close to being at home in Australia that it would
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_01: be very likely that we're the right part and we would be into Canada if it made sense but you know
[00:51:18] we're not in the business of collecting geographies we're in the business of delivering returns
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_01: you know per share and so happy to do that wherever it makes sense we've got to find the right people
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_01: I you know like for sure you know time is limited death is certain I want to spend my time with people
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_01: that want to spend the time with us that really share our mission and care about what we're doing
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_01: and I'm personally happy to do that anywhere with that that turns off
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_01: Manasi's asked a question so will we likely see you raise a mix of talent equity and transfers
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_01: over the next all months it's possible man see it's really you know the the office on the
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: debt side are very very strong and the alternate capital markets are much more flexible than they ever
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_01: have been frankly we've been really impressed with and surprised by what what we've been shown
[00:52:16] and so you know we we continue to work very hard to work through the best capital structure there's
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_01: no rush there's no you know it's a big risk to the business to do the wrong deal then too and
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_01: and you just sort of do any all any any all deal so we you know we will just to get it
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_01: um you know we're frankly quite um gratified and always have been that firms continue to turn up
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_01: with firm and CBD barrel if you'd ask me six weeks ago would they be joining Kelly Park so
[00:52:48] SPEAKER_01: be like you know as always I don't know so um but I'm pleased and after you know more than five
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_01: years of effort um they joined similarly the McDonald's focus firm that has joined join us here
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_01: in California actually called the principal of that firm one week after letting in the US in
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_01: January 2023 and I didn't get a text message back until the 22nd of December that year
[00:53:18] and I just relentlessly continued to contact that firm until we got a little bit of engagement
[00:53:24] SPEAKER_01: and we had discussions then we met the firm in Florida Barcelona 2024 in paper
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_01: April and once that firm joined us California firm got back in touch keen on the idea that we
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_01: would have east coast west coast and genuine national coverage so you know this is a relationship
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_01: business I'd emphasize that we have been sending emails to a can of firms in Australia for more
[00:53:51] SPEAKER_01: than 17 years the good people in that market know we exist and I'm confident that the people
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_01: really care about their firms that people and their clients will join in our group however
[00:54:04] SPEAKER_01: if they're just looking for sort of a short-term check and you know a way to say goodbye
[00:54:10] SPEAKER_01: because we've cleaned it and um they know I'd be out there calling them and that's okay as well there's
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_01: plenty plenty of opportunity our last comment would be that by being here in LA we've really opened
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_01: up geographic arbitrage for the group on where we can part with a firm and so that is meaning that
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_01: we don't need to rush into any particular deal or pay over the odds except times it doesn't make sense
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_01: because there is more than we could keep up with today and really no matter how big we may in
[00:54:36] SPEAKER_01: 2019 I suspect that they've been more than that we could catch on. Robert the question about
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_01: common about increasing related party loans some paid back on further loans made very expensive
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_01: to be here in the US borrowing money to fund it and we'll sort it out over time you'll know that
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_01: my rent remains deeply uncompetitive with with the market. Connor speaking of the East Coast
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_01: West Coast any interest in other Australian states beyond the East Coast. Connor yes if it's a
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_01: sizeable high quality business it shares our mission values and vision but a diversion if that's
[00:55:17] SPEAKER_01: not the case you know but we've spoken of big firms in Adelaide at West Australia over the last five
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_01: years and for whatever reason we haven't had them join the group so again we're not close minded
[00:55:30] SPEAKER_01: about where that opportunity is frankly we'd love to have a group group or groups join us in any of
[00:55:36] SPEAKER_01: those places. I'll cash how do you trade off growing slower organically we get in cash flows
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_01: most is trying to grow fast pressure and pretty which possibly comes with more is absolutely so
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_01: hence you'll notice that you know I catch for 20 years we've carefully managed that that balance
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_01: and we'll continue to be very very careful about how we do that. I am now 50 years old quite
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_01: experienced having done this for nearly 20 years and and feel that there's an opportunity today
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_01: to use my energy and skills on behalf of the group to get us to a size that I think makes us
[00:56:23] super competitive on a global basis but again if it's not done in a way that's capable of
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_01: fishing that delivers returns to shareholders then frankly the weather's very nice in
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_01: California and you know I can always take the dog for a walk around the block we just not
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_01: in any in any in any hurry all of my business heroes have been been very careful about capital efficiency
[00:56:52] SPEAKER_01: I love the book the outsiders I consider all of those CEOs this here as it mine and
[00:56:58] SPEAKER_01: and I've learned from them that you should be very circumspect but back up the truck when the
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_01: opportunity presents itself Daniel sent us when obtaining a new customer to the group we do say
[00:57:10] SPEAKER_01: marketing spenders core calls or more word of mouth once customers do is carry out their recurring
[00:57:17] SPEAKER_01: to the second part Daniel if a client joins our group they are occurring for a long time
[00:57:23] SPEAKER_01: and word of mouth is a typical driver so if we clean up the business well and they really
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_01: deliver you know free up partners and the team to be able to deliver a higher level of service
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_01: to the clients that builds word of mouth which is free marketing and so running an excellent
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_01: firm the word tends to get around yes we do a lot of marketing in terms of brand position to
[00:57:47] SPEAKER_01: build credibility which really helps our phones but really nothing can can beat a hand a hand
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_01: combative great service delivery that that builds a reputation
[00:57:59] SPEAKER_01: just um final questions we've taken up a full hour I note um I'm happy to leave it there
[00:58:19] SPEAKER_01: going once going twice uh oh Robert Miller to grow a retire as mentioned in the shareholders
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_01: I don't could just still see yourself doing this in some capacity for as long as it careers
[00:58:30] SPEAKER_01: or could you see yourself retiring it's a great question Robert I stuck it in their
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_01: old purpose because I've got a sense of human you know if you're not going to do things in a
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_01: on a world class you know in a world class way then you should retire um so from my perspective
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_01: seeing um my great hero word but reflect on his 60 years of service and when he chose to retire
[00:58:53] I think you've got to always make sure you're doing things for the right reasons
[00:58:57] you know from a personal perspective I have to get the group to to a point and our family to a point
[00:59:03] SPEAKER_01: that I can lead the business in the way that Buffett leads um Berkshire um and so really that's
[00:59:10] SPEAKER_01: that's my focus and um always had a clear vision of what's involved in doing that
[00:59:15] SPEAKER_01: and very excited about getting there um I think that you know the law was serving most
[00:59:22] SPEAKER_01: effective CEOs have um have been very careful about how they manage themselves such that they
[00:59:30] SPEAKER_01: can manage the business so people like Larry Ellison and Warren Buffett I think have been pretty
[00:59:37] pretty intelligent because they know the duration of of what they do is where the value is
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_01: and Santa Molten is the same but they're all the same so um I'm you know trying to make sure that
[00:59:49] SPEAKER_01: I look after my physical and mental health that we run the business in a way that is sustainable
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_01: for a long time because it's really in the duration of that the values ultimately created
[01:00:01] Kirin Robb and Kirin's question there was a considerate consideration of time to take KPG
[01:00:05] SPEAKER_01: private is there any more weight to this Kirin it's a great question you know in order for us to do
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_01: our fiduciary judy as directors we always have to consider what makes the most sense for shareholders
[01:00:19] SPEAKER_01: so why we technically can't ever say that we would never take the group private it has been my
[01:00:25] SPEAKER_01: longstanding position and and stated um preference belief that being public has helped our group
[01:00:33] SPEAKER_01: enormously um I would love nothing better than to well see this business as a public company for
[01:00:40] SPEAKER_01: 800 years because the right structure for a group with our current business and aspirations
[01:00:47] SPEAKER_01: um and I think frankly it makes us an insert and against these other larger businesses that really
[01:00:53] SPEAKER_01: I think you've got a struggle to to get a structure that's fit for the the next century so um
[01:01:01] so I hope that makes sense but yeah that's that that's our preference
[01:01:04] SPEAKER_01: great
[01:01:08] SPEAKER_01: well I can see no more open questions it's six o'clock it's been one hour
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_01: um six o'clock here in Los Angeles Kenny Kenny is in Hong Kong I should have also mentioned
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_01: um I want to thank everybody for their time certainly for any time you've got further questions
[01:01:25] SPEAKER_01: please reach out um we um we uh remain at your service and came to um to continue to the
[01:01:37] SPEAKER_01: livison great um great outcomes on a long term basis um for the business you know when we started
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_01: the business I had this ambitious uh goal to get to a 50 million of revenue we built all the systems
[01:01:52] SPEAKER_01: to handle 50 million of revenue and then when we could see that that target was within range
[01:01:59] you know I turned around for the team that said hey we need to run this business as if it's already
[01:02:04] SPEAKER_01: a hundred million all of business and then very quickly after that said let's make that a
[01:02:08] SPEAKER_01: hundred and fifty million all of business it's clear to us today what our goals are I think if you
[01:02:15] SPEAKER_01: read clearly our owners manual and what we've published over time that'll that'll um be pretty clear
[01:02:21] SPEAKER_01: where we're trying to get to and I hope that you can see that we're building a foundation
[01:02:26] SPEAKER_01: and just getting started on that on that path to build Australia's global accounting firm for
[01:02:31] SPEAKER_01: private business owners that want to go somewhere there is a clear and differentiated market
[01:02:36] SPEAKER_01: opportunity and we think we've got the model on the team um to deliver that uh for our quality
[01:02:42] SPEAKER_01: shareholders I want to thank everyone for the privilege of serving in our business we are having
[01:02:50] SPEAKER_01: a lot of fun and making a real difference which is the fun and as I love to say have a great day
