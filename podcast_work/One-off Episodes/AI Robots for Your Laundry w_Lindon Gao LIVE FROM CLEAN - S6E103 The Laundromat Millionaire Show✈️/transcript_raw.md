[00:00:00] Hello, welcome to the Clean Show. This is David Carleman from Laundra Bat Millionaire and we are coming live from the Dyna Robotics booth.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_08: If you are at the Clean Show, you need to come and check this out. We are at the 867.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_08: I'm here with us. We have Lyndon Gaff and Dyna Robotics. And we have Craig Taylor, one of the first Dyna Robotics users.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_08: So today we're going to be learning all about these folding robots. They look amazing. So you definitely want to catch this.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_10: Yeah, I got to tell you guys, I've been telling you for a couple of years now. This was coming, right? Now I didn't know Lyndon. I didn't know the Dyna team, but I told you robotics is coming. We all knew AI was coming.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_10: They've combined. They're here and we are excited to click off, kick off the Clean Show live from all of our channels across the platform of Laundra Bat Millionaire to show you what this is all about.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_10: And like I told Lyndon before we got online, the truth is a little selfishly. I'm curious because I got like a million questions for these guys.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_10: Craig is using the robot. If we're going to call it that the Dyna robot in his store right now. So we're going to ask Craig a few questions. We're going to let Lyndon tell us about his baby, right?
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_10: And we're going to show you live what it's about. So if you're not at the Clean Show, you're going to get a sneak peek of what it looks like to be out the show and get to see one of the coolest exhibits in the entire show.
[00:01:26] Hello and welcome to another episode of the Laundra Bat Millionaire shows sponsored by HM Company at DreamTross.com.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_10: The future of laundry technology is here today guys. This is a tool to help us augment our staff's ability to do a new wash drive.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_08: First, Lyndon, can you tell us a little bit about this company? First off, what in the world made you want to go into creating laundry robots?
[00:01:54] Well, this is a very, very good question. So a little bit of a mystery about myself. Start of first, my first company, Wild Sports, set it all on that way.
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_10: Oh, no, no. What did he show off? I was figuring out business places. I was four, right?
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_02: And my third company is Paul Tipper. We started building smart shopping cart. You know these physical shopping carts.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_02: We took cameras and set a few of them, compact it into a shopping cart such that you could just put anything you want into the cart.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_02: And it will automatically check you out and then you can rightfully need a grocery store. So the company is called Kipper.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_02: I built the company for about six years and we sold it to InstaCart in 2021 and sold it for a lot of money.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_02: But the most important thing is that the carts are now everywhere across New Jersey, Ohio, California.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_02: And it really gets anywhere that you can make them.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_02: And now, so I joined InstaCart for about three years. I was a big fan of engineering there. And guys, I started dining robotics when the way it really took off.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_02: It's a really, really interesting piece about AI is that first, it started as a language model. So a lot of you guys probably got some exposure to it during when opening our release chat.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_02: That was a very magical moment, right? And over time, the model evolved via multi model, where you're able to start using images and speech and everything else in there.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_02: And the models is what's off to you is if to show you videos and generate images, but one thing has to have a lot if it's physical AI.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_02: And which is how do we bring AI into the physical world such that it actually had value to humanity at large.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_02: So that was really one thought one really huge opportunity opportunity that I thought we should catch you see.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_02: So I came out here, started a book out of the company with two other people and we decide that we were going to change that we want to automate a lot of the manual things that people don't want to do in their daily life.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: So I went out there and I spoke to hundreds of different customers across various industries.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_02: So there are people in better with technology and manufacturing warehouse logistics, hospitality and so forth.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_02: But the one demographic that stood out the most was the overall overall laundry industry.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_02: And the laundry industry isn't just the laundry mat. It's not all owners. It's also the restaurant owner.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_02: So yeah, and it's talking to them. Their number one case point has always consistently been holding.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_02: I remember I was close to one of our earlier customers and they mentioned that holding is the biggest pain point.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: And if we are able to automate holding, we have a license.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_02: One, we're not looking for, you know, and right now what we're thinking about is that this is this could actually be very bright and awful for laundry industry.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_02: So we decided that one of our first applications to be soft body manipulation.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_02: It has manipulating clothing fabrics and the night. So that's that that's how it comes.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: So is that one of the harder challenges to do in a I robotics? I would think it would be.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_02: Yes, it's actually one of the very, very most difficult challenges because soft body manipulations, very different heart body.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_02: Where in a rigid object, you only have limited set of orientations and states that the object needed.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_02: So maybe if you have a cube, there is only six different ways in which you could flip it.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: But for a soft body like a cow, there's a deforms in so it could, you know, it could be stuck in any particular format.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_02: And the model needs to be smart enough to navigate itself out of that format such that it could become a foldable state.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_02: So that is one of the biggest, biggest challenges that we've been able to solve.
[00:05:41] Whether you already have a laundromat or looking to get into the laundry industry, everyone needs proper drainage.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_08: We use HM company drain trots. Their drain trots were first created in 1991 and they have been the leading drain trot manufacturer ever since.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_08: They're made in the USA and their drain trots are fully customizable to meet your needs.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_08: That's why we've used them ever since entering the industry. They're easy to clean for our staff and plenty sturdy when we need to walk on them when servicing our washers.
[00:06:15] With the ability to span up to 25 feet, our trots rarely need to be connected together, creating an easy installation.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_08: Want to slope your trot like we do? No problem. Just let the experts at HM company know.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_08: For more information, go to their website at draintrots.com. That is drain trots.com.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_08: HM company drain trots. They've been leading the industry since 1991. Check them out today.
[00:06:47] Wow. This idea tells a question, but how is A.O. Robotics different than another robot?
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_08: Like you said, because it can problem solve and get itself out of a situation. It's also like, do you train the robot?
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_08: Like we were to buy these robots. We have to train it.
[00:07:06] This is a really good question. How are the A.O. Robotics work? That's very different from traditional machines.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_02: It's not traditional machines are programmed on traditional rules. What that means is the entire machine is programmed on an if statement.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_02: So let's say in a typical machine is the food press button A that will do action B.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_02: If you press button C, it will do action B. But then if there's any outside of that parameters, it wouldn't be able to execute.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_02: But a power robot is very very different. It's able to take such situational environment contacts, audit contacts, and actually manipulate that based on the context of long.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_02: So how it works is the law similar to humans versus traditional machines. It's just a machine. It's like your coffee machine cannot dinner for you.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_02: So that's a really, really big difference. And the really like big breakthrough here is that we're potentially leveraging human loved one,
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_02: and then you'll be able to learn gradually by itself. So over a period of just the last three months that model by itself,
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_02: actually drastically. And they wanted to train the machines actually it starts with data. So data is like knowledge.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_02: Sure. Right. So humans for us, then you know, reading books, you know, talking to people, watching videos, and that's how we're like in the robot in a very similar way is we leverage data.
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_02: So with an update data that's collected on the robot to teach the robot to actually learn.
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_02: Wow. So you do train it you being dine up, you're trying it to give it some knowledge base. Yes.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_10: And then every time it folds, it learns more than a few of the time before. Yes, using a lot.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_10: And so if you guys are wondering, just a second, I know you can see these robots, five, they got three of them set up.
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_10: We're going to go over to one of them in a few minutes, and we're going to show you what it looks like. And maybe you can tell us a little bit about the design.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_10: I do probably cats and all this stuff. Don't share anything you know what everybody know.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_10: But we're pretty excited about that. Before we move over there, Craig, you're a lot about.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_10: I think I'm quite a friend of ours. That is your work shop. You are doing something really amazing with monster laundry.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_10: And you're, did you say miles up the road? Is that correct? We're miles up the road from Dina.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_09: Okay. I just one thing you said, a licensed to print money. If you can take over that folding process.
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_09: The biggest bottleneck we have in the laundry wash dry fold process is the actual folding.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_09: Because you throw in the washer 25 minutes later, it's done.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_09: Goes over to the dryer, maybe a half hour. You've done.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_09: And you've got this big pile of clothing. And it's painful.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_09: Our our staff at monster laundry spent a lot of time just folding.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_09: And what Dina robotics does for us is gives us the augmented ability to go through that process step.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_09: You just hand at the toes and out the other side comes these beautiful folded stacks that are attendance and take package up and they go out for our commercial clients.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_09: So I. It's an amazing step forward. How long have you had it in your store?
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_09: About a month and a half. But yeah. And we're already covering six of our commercial clients really are being.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_09: You know, sold it. Okay. So if I'm sitting at home or I'm even at the show watching this live.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_10: One of the questions I have is can it leave old towels? Maybe I'll ask you that.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_10: Well, no, I can't find anything that I could be imagined. So there is.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_10: I'm going to I'm going to push push back. So for either any limitations to what I can do.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_10: As far as folding laundry as far as folding laundry. No, but I think the one thing I cannot do is turn it closed inside out.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_02: That's probably there. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's pretty important as we know.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_10: Well, it's able to. I mean,
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_08: see the laundry and determine what type it is and how to fold it or to you.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_08: So you don't have to tell it. Oh, this is a kids shirt versus this is a pair of.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_08: Yeah. Yeah. What the item is. So.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_08: It's a sort of laundry too. Yes. I mean, there's sort of right there.
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_02: Wow. This is okay. I'm going to pass the place.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_10: Now, I do want to say so. Craig, I know yours is even out in your facility.
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_08: Where your self serve customers see it. Absolutely.
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_08: Uh, behind you have like a barrier. Yeah.
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_08: Interact with it. But what kind of reaction have you got?
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_09: We've gotten things from people kind of going, oh, no, to other.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_09: Most people, the reaction is. Wow. What's that?
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_09: They immediately went out their phone. They're taking videos of it, sharing with their friends.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_09: It is groundbreaking. This is a technologically major future step for laundry.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_09: This is what we always knew was coming, but it's not coming anymore.
[00:11:53] Thanks to the doc. I'll see you.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_10: Here it is. Yeah. So one question I have before we go over to the robot.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_10: It does seem to fold pretty slow.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_10: If I compare that to my people, which granted they are amazing and they've been doing this three years, it's pretty slow.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_10: But it doesn't take breaks or you don't have to pay a waste.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_08: For sure. But there's definitely some benefits.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_10: But one of my questions is, will it speed up and another in a side question that is,
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_10: will it speed up as it gets better? Is that what is waiting on?
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_10: Okay. Yes. So what more data does collect it? Right?
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_02: It will speed up by itself. And that's a really, really magical thing.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_02: So like when we started, there's a napkin told me use days that we had.
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_02: So when we started, we started our general group of AWA is, I don't know, maybe like a hundred day, which was really slow.
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_02: And over a period of about three to four weeks, they got to about 600 and by the eight weeks, it's 150.
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_02: And now fast forward to today, we're doing about two and a two thousand five hundred per day.
[00:13:01] So you were initially a hundred, yeah, a hundred days to speed by 25.
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_02: Yes. So that's pretty good. So the AI by itself actually looks for ways to improve us all because the ultimate goal is to fold it with high quality at a high group.
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_02: But so that is the goal. And that's this sole purpose.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_02: Imagine if you're a sole purpose all day is to get to a certain amount of food fun and quality.
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_02: It's just going to drastically get better open out. Okay.
[00:13:27] Yeah, I think that's a good point on quality.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_09: It needs to be folded properly for the monster way. We have a monster way folding.
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_09: And if it's not, it doesn't look good and look good in the packages. That's not good.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_09: That's a good boy. Correct. Can it package laundry?
[00:13:43] You know what that means, but yes, put it in the bag and see a lead.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, that's slightly a little more difficult, but yeah, it's doable as well. Okay.
[00:13:54] Okay. So Craig, honest assessment, how do you feel about the quality of the folds?
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_08: They are adequate. I think they think that's a matter of time in more iterations, more trained.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_09: So it's going to get better and better over a month that we've watching this thing.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_09: It is absolutely true. Is your robot run 24 7 or no?
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_09: You need the volume to do exactly. So you have to feed it.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_09: And then you have to pull the materials off. So there is that's a little bit of bottleneck.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_09: They can be solved in various ways.
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_09: So you have to provide it with a basket on each side of the robot to pull out of.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_10: And it runs out. It just sits there and wait for you to feed more.
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_09: Yeah. And so that may in a longer environment. That's obviously washer, dryer, and then the dryer load goes to the robot.
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_09: Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. Well, guys, it wants to go see a robot.
[00:14:51] Would you like to make more money from your laundromat?
[00:14:54] Would you like those machines you're paying for to have more turns per day?
[00:15:00] Do you offer wash dry fold services or pick up and delivery laundry services?
[00:15:06] If not, would you like to?
[00:15:09] Whether you do or not, we have an amazing opportunity for you in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:15:15] Yeah, you've probably heard about it, guys, but it's our wash dry fold pickup and delivery workshop.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_06: And to answer your first question, yes, it is for drop off laundry, wash dry fold, and pickup and delivery.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_06: If you're doing any of those things, this workshop is going to help you tremendously.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_06: But the truth is, we were pretty so, so laundromat owners and so, so successful until we launch drop off laundry and pick up and delivery.
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_06: And being able to what I call optimize your laundromat to generate more profit and more revenue out of the existing facility, that's the key to taking your life from good to great financially speaking with laundromats.
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_06: And that's what made us laundromat millionaires.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_06: You don't have to just listen to us.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_08: Listen to what some of our past attendees have to say about our wash dry fold pick up and delivery workshop in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_08: It was the best workshop I've attended in over 25 years.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_00: And what you guys have put together is nothing short of phenomenal.
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: I think that you guys have put together both strategic and tactical systems that will make an individual who wants to own the laundromat profitable within months, not years.
[00:16:26] It was a workshop worth investment without a doubt, it was definitely worth the investment.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_01: So not only did we have two very packed days with Dave, Carla and their team, both in the classroom and during the facilities.
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_01: But we also came away with this extensive 100 page handbook.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_01: And then after the workshop was completed, I received a bunch of electronic performers and templates that we've been able to use since the workshop.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_01: Every day since the workshop I found myself preferring back to either those up to electronic tools or to ample per receive.
[00:17:07] Was it worth the investment? Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_03: I cannot say that enough.
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_03: This was such a blessing and I am so very grateful that Dave and Carla put this together and are sharing their knowledge and experience with others to have this to have this to grow their business and to become more successful.
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_03: Thank you guys.
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_08: So are you interested? Go to laundromatmillionaire.com to learn more and see where you can register.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_08: All right, so London, tell us about your baby that doesn't have a name.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_10: What is that?
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_10: Okay, we named ours Sophie.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_10: So, so she's really awesome.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_10: Yeah, Swiss folding robot.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_10: So, this is what she says right now.
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_10: They just called Diana, which is cool.
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_10: But tell us about this and if it makes a mistake, tell us about that too.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so basically, so this robot has a pair of arms with six degrees of freedom.
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_02: So, from the bottom of the joy, all the way to the gripper has six different degrees of freedom where I operate however, like on the flat surface.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_02: So, the robot is retrofitted with about 53 to five different cameras depending on how you look at it.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_02: So, okay, here you have one scrapping and two two different robots on the wrist.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: And then there's one on top here at two right down here.
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_02: And that's all that's all the robot needs.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_02: All the robot needs is really just those cameras and it's making up decisions from the five.
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I might have missed that.
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_10: Say that again, there's a camera on each end of the arm.
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_02: Yes, there's a camera through there.
[00:18:46] And there's a camera down low.
[00:18:48] Yes, okay, wow.
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_02: Wow, I'd expect that as well.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_08: So, right now, I see like trying to figure out what the article of clothing is and then just get it smooth.
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_02: Yes, so it's looking for ways to find a find the towel.
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_02: So, and that's that's traditionally a very very different ball of individual box right?
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_02: Because it's all it's nearly impossible to take a plumble towel.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, I think we as humans kind of take for granted that that we do that so often and have since birth.
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_10: You know, at home or whatever, how the dexterity I guess I would call that is that a fair yes, like I think we take for granted how easy that is to do.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_10: Because we are humans, but we're rather advanced.
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_10: And so for a robot to do that is pretty impressive.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_10: Oh, is he trying to stack?
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_10: I was just going to say is he going to stack them?
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_10: Yes.
[00:19:42] Now, I'm pretty sure I know the answer to this, but what if I wanted Diana to fold that in half again?
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_10: And I wanted it to be in more of a square than a rectangle.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_10: That's perfectly fine.
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_10: Craig has six different towels and that's okay.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_10: Yeah, that's all part of the programming.
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_10: So, me or Craig get a new client comes in.
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_10: Let's let's me silly here and say they have a triangle shaped towel or whatever, right?
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_10: And we got a we got a start from scratch with Diana.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_10: How how hard is that to do?
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_10: And if it's Craig now, I know you guys are only a few miles away.
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_10: Do you guys zip over there and do that?
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_10: Or does Craig you train the real bother?
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_10: How's that? How's that work?
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_10: Once I get it, I'm a year in and it does a bunch of things, but I get this new client.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_10: Yeah, what does that look like?
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_02: So right now at the moment, we actually have some of what's like the data.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_02: They'll basically tell you operating the robots and the robot will learn.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_02: Okay, and then from the data, then the robots will be directly adapt to it.
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_02: So any types of fold any type of fabric, we could do as long as you guys give us the SLP.
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_02: And then from here, that's only being the finished product, the finished product.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_02: In the future, we'll actually directly learn it within our labs.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_02: So that what we give it to you, it will directly be a boss.
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_02: You'll probably have a you'll be exactly and you'll be able to pick what have a full you want.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_02: I've called how how an garment that you want to be folded.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_02: I've been always just learned by myself. Wow.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_08: How long has this actually been like released to the market at this point?
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_08: So right now it's fairly on the slows, but no, but we're we're live in restaurants.
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_02: We're live in Lodromeats.
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_02: We're also live in fitness centers.
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_02: So we are curl as as we're pushing the boundaries of folding where obvious are missions to get this to full faster and you environments and also different types of barfits.
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_02: Get a lot better at that.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_02: Have you ever thought about having so our our process here is that you are folding you split fold works.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_08: You know what those are.
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_08: What about having and do the slip over?
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_02: It's we have we haven't because that's an easier way.
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_02: That's a solution.
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_02: That's a cop out way.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_02: You're not.
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_02: We wanted to deal legitimately.
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_02: But yes, we could do.
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_02: We could have to use as so you can train.
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_10: Died to use a flip fold board in the same way that we trained a new team member because when they come on for us.
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_10: Yes.
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_10: We train them on a flip fold board and then what we tell our team is once you get to a certain speed.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_10: Once you get to a certain quality with the folding board.
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_10: Then you have the right permission to withdraw from the band in the folding board and what we call free fold.
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_10: Oh, you have to prove yourself.
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_10: No.
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_10: The folding board of quality and speed.
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_10: Okay.
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_10: Before you have to earn the right to get rid of it.
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_10: And it's because it's the consistent.
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_10: I said every product.
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_10: I just think it would make him consistent faster.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_08: It does for our workers.
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_08: It does.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_02: For sure.
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_02: Maybe I should.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_02: I should show that to you for before it gets first the right to people by itself.
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_10: So I'm sure we have a million more questions.
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_10: But one of them I notice and you probably can't see from the camera.
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_10: Is that it's on wheels.
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_10: Now I don't see it moving other than the arms.
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_10: Can it or will it or am I getting ahead of myself in a few months and a few months.
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_10: I love it.
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_02: You will be able to see it will be around.
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_02: Nice.
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_02: And that would that's when it will be able to pick up laundry from your dryers and
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_02: correctly bring it to exit on.
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_10: I was just getting ready to say that.
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_10: I'll be able to load a washer.
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_10: Yes.
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_10: Like, will it be able to I'm just going to keep rule.
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_10: I'll be able to.
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_10: Okay.
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_10: I'll be able to read a laundry ticket.
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_10: And what I mean by that is.
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_10: The way that we process thousands pounds every day.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_10: Is we have what we call.
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_10: You know, we've already done something like, uh, ownership of the order, but we also have fully customizable.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_10: That means every order the way our customers want the way they would.
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_10: Every order is unique and different.
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_10: And of course, as it comes in whether it's drop off or pick up and delivery, it has a ticket.
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_10: The prints out from our POS, right?
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_10: Can I read the ticket?
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_10: And no.
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_10: I want the full two.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_02: So the thing about what we call this called
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_02: foundation model robotics, where we actually
[00:23:57] SPEAKER_02: in leverage very sophisticated AI models to do this,
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_02: the only thing that could do anything
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_02: that you imagine that you imagine.
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_02: There's no limits to the imagination
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_02: of what this can do.
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_02: So it's all the only limitation to this is hardware.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_02: Say that again, it's hardware, hardware.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_02: So hardware capabilities is what limits it.
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_02: So like, for example, if you need something
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_02: that requires fingers, like, for example,
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_02: one very difficult thing that we can do,
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_02: but we don't do very often as rolling, right?
[00:24:27] That's why we're busted.
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_02: Yes, that gets we busted for some
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_02: of our clients.
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_02: That is quite difficult.
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_02: It can do it, but it doesn't do it very well.
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so that's the only limitation.
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_02: But beyond that, it's just a pair of pants.
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_02: So anything that can match up,
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_02: pair of pants can do this robot can do as well.
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_02: So that's the really exciting part.
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_02: Can you just answer those?
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh.
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_02: Can I do this?
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_02: Can I do this?
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_10: Maybe the tips.
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_10: Maybe the tips would have to be different
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_08: where it has a barcode that basically gives them
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_08: all the information for that order.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_08: Where they read it differently.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_08: They're not reading like,
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_08: are people read like a printout of English?
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_08: It just has a barcode.
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_08: It knows it's order number 162.
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_08: And this is what I do.
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_08: That's right.
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_10: OK, now I'm going to get nerdy or more nerdy.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_10: Do you think someday there's a possibility
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_10: of integrating this into the software that we use?
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_10: Like we use that software.
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_10: There's like 10 different companies out there
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_10: and use this herb side.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_10: That's right.
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_10: And you probably know about these people already, right?
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_10: In the industry, could you see a day, of course,
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_10: with their cooperation where you can have an API integration
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_10: with this where it can look and know order number 3258D
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_10: is a cold wash, tide detergent, medium dry,
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_10: you know, eat dry or whatever.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_02: So basically how the robot operates
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_02: is I actually take language command.
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_02: So it takes natural language commands.
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_02: We actually did that top-top.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_02: I just set it up here.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_02: But you can actually tell it what to do.
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_02: So that's the early and majorly.
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_02: Yes, verbally.
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_02: So that's something that will be showcasing very soon.
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_02: That's day two of the clean show, right?
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_02: That's the top.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_02: But by next year, you don't talk to your AI
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_02: or tell you you could just talk to the robot.
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_02: You could just tell it what to do.
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_02: So by that sense, from your perspective,
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_02: in the API format, yeah.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_02: So basically, it's just connecting to the APIs
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_02: of these other software companies.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_02: And from these software companies,
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_02: they'll just directly give us command
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_02: of what it wants to robot.
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_02: So that's, yes.
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_02: So now that for five years,
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_02: it's not that far off.
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_02: It's cooperation, of course.
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_02: And in a few months, we'll be showcasing how
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_02: we'll help us to do the things in work.
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_02: Very, very simple.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_02: So just for about the year,
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_08: it's next to the end of the towels.
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_08: All the towels are the same size.
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_08: But you've been up random objects
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_08: and what it'd be able to hold them.
[00:26:52] Yes.
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_02: So in the case of random objects, for example,
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_02: we have done it in, we have tried
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_02: this between a mixture of napkins,
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_02: mixture of shirts and all that stuff.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_02: So it would be able to learn to actually
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_02: fold the various different napkins,
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_02: as well as you guys give us that so keys.
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_02: OK.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_02: So yes.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_02: OK.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_10: So Craig, I'm curious.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_10: Yes.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_10: You had this in your store for 15,
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_10: sorry, six weeks, month and a half, roughly, about that time.
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_10: Yes.
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_10: You have a pretty good grasp on what it can do.
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_10: One question, have you seen it improve in those six weeks?
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_10: Absolutely.
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_10: And what's an example or two?
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_09: We have a video of it pulling a towel out,
[00:27:37] and then it folded it.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_09: But one of the corners was underneath.
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_09: And it kept trying to grab.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_09: And it was like, I can't get that quarter.
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_09: And then it went in and it grabbed the fold,
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_09: and it slipped it over, and then got the tab of the edge,
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_09: and lifted up, flipped it, folded it, and it was done.
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_09: But I was like incredible.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_09: That it was.
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_09: That's your every time I look over here,
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_08: you get the golf smooth.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_08: I'm like, oh, my god.
[00:28:05] That's the mom and the teacher.
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_10: I know.
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_08: Do what to praise, everybody.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_10: Does it recognize praise?
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_02: Of course, my head doesn't.
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_02: But I love having a reward model where
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_02: if it's doing the right thing,
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_02: where it gets all reward.
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_02: Oh, really?
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_02: What's a reward?
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_02: Right back with your robot teacher.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_02: It's a great deal.
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_02: So basically, the algorithm is incentivized
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_02: to do the right things.
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_02: But that the initiative, the right thing,
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_02: is very undefined.
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_02: This is where I get creepy, right?
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to take over the world and kill it all.
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_10: And as long as you give it the right word,
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_02: it's important to try to set it to do the right things.
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_02: So at every single stage, if it's successfully flattened
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_02: and the towel, I guess it's a reward.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_02: If it's successfully, that's the first bowl,
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_02: it gets a reward.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_02: And that's so on and so forth.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_02: So it's so a computerized out of boy.
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_02: Good job.
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_02: Like Carlos said.
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_02: So every single time it gets a reward,
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_02: then I know it was, OK, now I can do this better next time.
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_02: So it's kind of like a baby, right?
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_02: Every time when it grabs something in it,
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_02: this something new or something well,
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_02: every time when you're a kid, put that stuff there.
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_02: And it's learning that, oh, this is how I take the first step.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_02: This is how I take the second step.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_02: Over time, it just colleges and gets better and better.
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_02: So it has a very similar mechanism to it.
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_02: That's similar to humans.
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_02: OK.
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_02: Back to correct.
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_10: Another follow-up question.
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_10: Sure.
[00:29:30] You kind of need your store for six weeks.
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_10: I'm sure you had a bunch of conversations
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_10: before you put in your store.
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_10: But you're actually one of the few people using it,
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_10: IRL, right?
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_10: In real life.
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_10: That's correct.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_10: Where do you think it's going?
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_10: What do you, I guess, and I don't know if you guys can speak to this,
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_10: but have you already given them feedback?
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_10: Like, we are.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_10: Can I do this?
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_10: Can I do that?
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_10: And how soon can I do this?
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_10: Where do you think this thing's going to be able to be in a year or two?
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_10: If you're allowed to like talk about private conversations.
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_09: Well, I envision, and this is not by any means vision,
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_09: but by envision that we get a residential commercial load of laundry,
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_09: which includes baby socks, all the baby clothing,
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_09: the rain with shirts and the garments of an adult, the towels,
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_09: the linens that come in the sheets.
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_09: And they just simply come out of the dryer.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_09: We put them in a laundry basket, roll it right on over to Dina.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_09: Yep.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_09: And Dina just simply goes through stacks them in the appropriate piles.
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_09: So they create what I would consider kind of the tetris game of proper stacking.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_09: Yep.
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_09: And then it goes into a nice little container,
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_09: our tentative just simply then places in the bag.
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_09: It's shipping out.
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_09: That would be amazing.
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_09: And I would expect that as we see laundry is changing the future,
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_09: the new format of laundry will include a robotics folding section.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_09: Yeah, for the smaller laundry.
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_09: And yes.
[00:30:50] So that's what I think Dina's vision might be a little bit different.
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_09: That's from a laundry owner operator, perspective operator.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_09: That is what we need to fully solve our problems in the industry.
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_10: Give you an example.
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_10: Craig has been in our workshop.
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_10: We do a workshop three times a year and since it's an addy,
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_10: we teach laundry about owners how to watch, scale and optimize their pick up and delivery business.
[00:31:12] A good portion of that is efficiencies redundancies backups.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_10: Humans are great, but they're not great if they don't show up, right?
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_10: All those types of things.
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_10: One of the things we teach is folding and packaging, folding slash packaging.
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_10: That's one process as far as work and serve.
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_10: So the fact that it can fold towels pulled off the side is really cool.
[00:31:33] SPEAKER_10: But long term, I think we as an industry as operators need this to do exactly what he described,
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_10: including putting it in a package, grabbing a label off of our printer,
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_10: putting it on the thing and it could take that bundle of laundry and put it on the appropriate shelf.
[00:31:48] And then that goes into the delivery, the delivery person comes and grabs it off the shelf.
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_09: For the delivery robot.
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_08: Oh, yeah.
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_08: Oh, yeah.
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_08: Let's do a whole new problem.
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_08: Automatic car.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_08: I mean.
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_08: Oh, yeah.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_09: Oh, yeah.
[00:32:03] What are your thoughts on how crazy we are?
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_02: That's what we need.
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_02: That's real life.
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_02: You are not crazy at all.
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_02: We actually spent hundreds of hours in laundry, so we know exactly the problem there.
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_02: You already know.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_02: We're working on it.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_02: We're knocking them out one at a time.
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_02: So the first thing now, what nature we knock out is fold, right?
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_02: Folding high-short road lots.
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_02: It's able to go very quickly.
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_02: So through percent quality are the two metrics that we pull this on in the coffee.
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_02: And beyond that, it's really just how can we do everything else around it?
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_02: Which packaging the late flight.
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, maybe the delivery for you guys down the road as well.
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_02: I'll probably be in the next year or two.
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_02: We're here to hold on.
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_10: Hold on.
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_10: DJ, you're here to do.
[00:32:45] My new best friend.
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_10: We're going to get along great.
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_10: Yeah, usually I have all these crazy ideas and people are like, well, maybe someday,
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_10: I'm like, I've done doing it for me.
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_10: Year two.
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_10: All right.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_02: I challenge accepted.
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_02: I'm genuinely excited about how quickly AI is advanced.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this world.
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_02: And all of this is really just a bunch of data.
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_02: So as long as we get the right data, we're not going to be able to do it.
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_02: And do I understand correctly that AI in general from where it is today and to tomorrow
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_10: is a compounded exponential data collection growth, meaning it's speeding up the rate
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_10: at which it collects data and can respond accordingly to every minute, hour, hour,
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_02: that's right.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_02: Because here's the thing.
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_02: The reason why robotics is not soft in the real world today is because there is no real
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_02: world data.
[00:33:39] Right.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_02: We're able to share a language model because there's a huge purpose of all this text on the
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_02: internet, the straight up letter from all these bugs and everything else.
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_02: We could also generate videos and generate images because there's no shortages of these
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_02: videos and images on YouTube and where else.
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_02: But there is nothing in the physical world today.
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_02: So one of the critical things is as we scale data, the robot is able to learn a lot faster,
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_02: as it's able to do a lot more things beyond exploding.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_02: It could put your meals for you.
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_02: It could wash your dishes for you.
[00:34:09] SPEAKER_02: Yes, it's all source of feelings.
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_08: How's work became a breeze with this robotic whirling dirtish?
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_08: Let's go home, Rose.
[00:34:17] Never fear while Rosie is here.
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_08: It's Rosie to the rescue.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_10: Let's do all that.
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_10: I think your robot needs to come to our workshop.
[00:34:27] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_10: I agree.
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_08: Is your laundromat ready to become the neighborhood's number one choice?
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_04: Laundra Boost has proven strategies to help your business flourish.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_04: I think we saw changes pretty quick before that four month range.
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_07: I'm in that four month range now and Borcian changes love to cry.
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_07: I mean, pick up and deliver clients, drop off clients, self service clients, businesses
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_07: up as a whole.
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_07: Literally, it was shocking to watch the numbers jump.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_05: What should we get?
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_05: I could go back and I could begin to track these things.
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_05: We try to have to just see what percentage growth we had, but it wasn't unusual to go up
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_05: 30 percent per month.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_05: At Laundra Boost, we specialize in fueling laundromat growth.
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_04: Through targeted Google ads and powerful social media campaigns, we make your locations stand
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_04: out and attract loyal customers.
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_04: Ready to level up your laundromat?
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_04: Visit LaundraBoostMarketing.com and book a call with us for a free consultation.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_04: One thing I think especially people who are here at the clean show are going to be wondering
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_08: because you can't see all the robot is how much space is needed for one of these just
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_08: just for folding.
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_08: You're not moving around yet.
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_08: How much space is needed for just a holding robot?
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_08: This is it.
[00:35:38] I know.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_02: So why would you estimate that?
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_08: That's what like for fee wide by about four foot by four foot.
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_08: Four by four I think.
[00:35:47] This robot will actually get even smaller.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_02: So the base we got a little smaller and it will be able to move around.
[00:35:53] SPEAKER_02: So we'll get small footwork.
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_02: We're going to smaller over time.
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_02: The arm eventually will convert to our human arm.
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_02: So our human arm has seven degrees of freedom.
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_02: There's a six degrees of freedom.
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_02: So once the arms converges towards the torso, then the ball and socket.
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_02: Concept.
[00:36:11] Okay.
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_08: Yeah.
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_08: Because you could narrow it like narrow shoulders.
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_08: This has pretty wide shoulders.
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_08: So the narrow the shoulders.
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_02: So it'll be a lot easier to manipulate this.
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_02: Wonderful.
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_08: Awesome.
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_08: And then what about as far as power?
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_08: It looks like it's just plugging into a regular outlet.
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_08: Yeah.
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_10: Just regular outlet.
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_08: And that's all I know.
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_08: It's not special.
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_10: What that needed?
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_10: No.
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_10: That is awesome.
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_10: And I noticed you park your tail of the camera.
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_10: But down here it's plugged into a laptop.
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_10: That's just for data purposes.
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_02: That's just where the compute.
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_02: So in the future we'll do some about this little laptop inside.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_08: So they won't need to plug into a laptop.
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_08: That is, it'll be part.
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_08: Is that a lot of it?
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_08: It has an inferencing engine that's underneath the tape.
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_09: But that'll consolidate on sure.
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_09: Yes.
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_09: Yeah.
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_10: Okay.
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_10: I am blown away.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_10: You're so proud of him.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_10: I know.
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_09: I know.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_09: It's a special.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_10: So I want to go back to when this company started,
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_10: you said 11 months ago.
[00:37:08] Is that a, is that a literal thing?
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_10: Like the company was found and it didn't exist until one month ago.
[00:37:14] SPEAKER_08: That one when the first robot came out.
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_10: That didn't exist.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_10: I did not.
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_10: And I know you're like an expert in the field.
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_10: So I'm not surprised.
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_10: But you got from zero to this.
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_08: Yeah.
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_08: Yeah.
[00:37:41] Yeah.
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_02: six, six, seven months. Wow.
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_02: Yes. So did it look a whole lot different than what we're seeing now.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_08: It looked a lot different. And it was a lot worse than this is there was a lot of
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_02: wires hanging around and it did not hold it very well.
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_02: I thought it was looking around on your website because that was very
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_08: very intrigued by all this and I thought the arms actually like clicked on to the table.
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_08: Did it start off that way? Yes. Okay.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_08: So why did you move away from it? Because one thing the arms clicked on there would take up
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_08: less space. Why did you move away from that?
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_08: It's a lot easier to scale this way so that there's different tables that do
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_02: perform that different width and so forth.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_02: That's just at the end of it we still need to compute everything else.
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_02: It's much easier to just integrate into what unit so they'll be just deploying to new environments.
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_02: And you can put it on me also.
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_08: It's ready for the next step of washing and drying.
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_08: I have packaging and I love it to your customers.
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_02: I'm loading a truck.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_08: We'll get there.
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_02: We'll get there.
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_02: We'll hold the truck and maybe you could have mealed for you on your way.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_02: I love it.
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_10: Wow.
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_10: Any more questions?
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_10: I don't think I have any more questions.
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_10: Fred, what do you think about this?
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_10: What's the final analysis of someone that's used it for six weeks in the field?
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_10: I know you're only doing towels right?
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_10: Right now.
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_09: Well, what's really interesting, we processed laundry,
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_09: Dave's way, Arles's way, that we learned at their workshop,
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_09: I don't even since Nadi.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_09: And augmented that slightly by creating a board with each of our attendants,
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_09: the longer they need to do each day.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_09: Because we're still somewhat small.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_09: Yep.
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_09: Yeah.
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_09: Sophie has her own slut.
[00:39:30] Yeah.
[00:39:30] Oh, okay.
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_09: And that tells you that yes, she's an effective member of the team.
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_09: She has her own slot of work she needs to do during the day.
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_09: And I'd say she's now part of the process.
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_09: She's within operations and we rely on her to get jobs done.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_09: I think I mentioned we have six commercial clients.
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_09: Those are towels.
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_09: We're looking forward to more residential in the future.
[00:39:54] SPEAKER_09: So let's post it.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_10: Sophie, speed.
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_10: You know, I'm a 30,000 hour to 30,000 hour that right now.
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_10: That is what's holding.
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_10: Keep your hold.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_10: I don't have metrics on that.
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_09: But what I can tell you is some key information was that there was a fold they were doing.
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_09: And it was taking Sophie something like 30 seconds.
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_09: And then they let her up.
[00:40:18] And after a while, she got that down to 22 seconds.
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_09: Wow.
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_09: So that's for one fold and just in one shift.
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_09: Yeah.
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_09: Well, that was no, that was over time.
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_09: But what they they observed is getting faster over time.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_09: And so I expect that all of the folds will probably start getting faster and faster
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_09: to the point where it's the speed of the robotic arms and the manipulation of the towel will slow it down.
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_10: Is part of the speed, the limitation, and I don't mean to pick on your baby, but it's not fast.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_10: We can all see that.
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_10: Right.
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_10: Is part of the limitations.
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_10: Some of the design elements you're talking about with the ball and socket and
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_10: those different things are you are you limited by what it can do and how fast it can do it
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_10: because of design one or two or whatever this is.
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_10: Yeah.
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_10: So the general general thing about and speed are actually a combination of I will say probably three
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_02: different variables.
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_02: Number one is just how does it solve the problem?
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_02: The how it solves the problem is actually very important because because you guys might notice this
[00:41:18] SPEAKER_02: from some of your best workers that has a son of throughput that little tricks.
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_02: Figure out those little things make a big difference.
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_02: And those are the little things, little tricks that we're trying to learn as the robot
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_02: involves over time.
[00:41:31] SPEAKER_02: It's because they're learning that these little tricks lost slower than humans.
[00:41:35] SPEAKER_02: As it ignores these little tricks over and over again, you'll be able to actually get a lot faster.
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_02: Could it?
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_10: I'm not apologize if I interrupted.
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_10: If if we had a Marlene, which we all know Marlene's my G.
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_10: Hell.
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_10: She's the most amazing while everything in the world, but she's the most amazing laundry processor I've
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_10: ever seen in my life.
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_10: I've always said if she weren't so valuable, if I made a processor, I'm confident she could do
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_10: a hundred pounds an hour, not folding the total order to order in.
[00:42:01] So if we put someone like Marlene next to Dina or Sophie and they just watch her do laundry,
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_10: would that be a?
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_10: And they learn?
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_08: With her way of learning or am I really increasing that?
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_10: Of course, really you are.
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_02: A little crazy now.
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_10: I'm trying to see how far I could take a lead, but that was pretty far.
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_10: He's like, yeah, that predicts the list day.
[00:42:22] SPEAKER_10: No, it's going to right now.
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_02: It goes to learn very well from humans.
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_02: I can't take you, they can't learn from what we call egocentric video, which is we put a camera
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_02: right right here and you can do the whole thing.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_02: Well, my computer has learned, but it doesn't learn very well.
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_02: It's not very efficient learning.
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_02: The most efficient way for robots to learn is to do it by doing something these tasks.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_02: So when I find something like these little tricks, for example, it's the robot actually needs to
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_02: actually learn how to find corners, right?
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_02: The speed to which it flies corners actually defies how quickly
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_02: like a fold.
[00:42:59] SPEAKER_02: So the robot is actually still learning how can I find corners very, very quickly?
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_02: I'll make sure that it's on the same side.
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_02: Very quickly, because sometimes it doesn't flip on the same side, right?
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_02: So sometimes you grab a corner of your computer, but you grab the other corner over there and you flip,
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_02: but then you can't fly and you have to grab corners on the same side.
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_02: So those are the tricks that the robot has to learn over time, I said,
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_02: there's more and more.
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_02: See, that's the first one now, but the second component is how the robot
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_02: how quickly robot gets out of what we call out of distribution state.
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_02: What out of distribution state really just means is that when the towel is in a very
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_02: teotic format, how quickly can the robot get it to fly?
[00:43:43] That's after that or more.
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_02: That's half the value.
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_02: And what happens is some things like that in a different out of that distribution scenario,
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_02: as it picks up two to three towels at the same time,
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_02: is it able to learn to separate from these scenarios and I was back and so forth, right?
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_02: These out of distribution scenarios easily hit the root of the artist.
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_02: For example, now I've been folding a scenario, in this case,
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_02: the client wants to pull over a thousand apples on a daily basis.
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_02: What we realized is that we're able to persistently fold the napkins
[00:44:15] SPEAKER_02: hit under like 30 to 40 seconds, but then when it gets into out of distribution state,
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_02: where we pick up 30 to 40 napkins all at the same time,
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_02: putting it back, that particular problem takes us about two to three minutes to solve.
[00:44:29] So the faster it's able to navigate out of that scenario, because these happen all the time,
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_02: and these are the precise scenarios where it breaks machines.
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it breaks machines because machines cannot handle it.
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it doesn't have the acknowledges for the robots.
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_02: So the sooner it solves the problem, the faster it solves the problem,
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_02: then the throughput rate will also go up.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_02: And then the last part is the hardware limitation, which is how quickly can the hardware.
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_02: And these are a folks up just advancing the hardware for tech, for technology.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_02: And I thought about making the fingers.
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_08: So right now you kind of just have ventures.
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_08: We thought about making them more like fingers.
[00:45:06] Yes.
[00:45:06] So these, basically the finger technology right now, this time,
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_02: I will say commercial already yet, because we have a lot of joins.
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_02: We have like 20 degrees of freedom on your fingers.
[00:45:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_02: It breaks very easily, right?
[00:45:20] SPEAKER_02: Because so if I accidentally slab my finger on the table, it's going to hurt.
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_02: It's going to hurt.
[00:45:24] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_02: So right now, uh, parallel frippers are the most reliable format,
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_02: and it boasts the job of law enforcement, right?
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_02: Very well.
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_02: As we roll out of that, as I mentioned, the hardware is going to get better.
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_02: We are going to start converging towards a slightly more steep up.
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_02: And you're not a hardware company, right?
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_02: Would you know our hardware?
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_02: We're, yes.
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_02: We are not a finger building.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_02: That's pretty advanced.
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_10: Yes.
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_10: That's right.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_10: That's also very different.
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_10: Is there a limit to the robot itself?
[00:45:55] And how long it can work?
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_10: Does it overheat?
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_10: Does it need breaks?
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_10: Do certain components?
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_10: Short out?
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_10: I don't know.
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_10: I'm just kind of going to be.
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_10: And this thing runs for like three weeks.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_10: Great.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_10: If you kept it, if you kept giving it laundry baskets,
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_10: so far, you're one of our other
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_02: Marshall application scenarios where we're fully napkins,
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_02: the robot is running about
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_02: 16 to 18 hours a day.
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_02: And close to two weeks with the last
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_02: a couple of months.
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_02: And that has it.
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_02: We haven't right right to end.
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_02: And that does affect it.
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_02: It does affect so well.
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_02: The robot is able to run for as long as you want it to.
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_02: And it's able to, you know, we built this to last at least two years
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_02: in production environment.
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_02: And over time, it's hard to get spender.
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_02: For these five years, I'll show up like two years, 24 hours a day.
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_02: Like you've got so you calculated like working hours, working hours.
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_02: So right now, the hardware build standard is 20,000 hours at an hour.
[00:46:58] SPEAKER_02: So that's what worked good.
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_02: So if you use that eight hours a day, it would be six years, right?
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_10: Yes.
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_10: How often are you using it right now?
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_09: Right now it's in a training in production mode.
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_09: So we have a Dina technician training.
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_09: And then again, Misha's it on production.
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_09: And it just starts going autonomously.
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_09: And that's when everybody starts to start the video.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_09: Yeah.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_09: They're like, what's going on?
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_09: Including your employees.
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_09: Yeah.
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_09: Oh, you're like, oh, I hope you're good.
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_09: You're like, you're getting a little worried about their jobs.
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_09: That's the first, actually, that's one of the first thing we had a staff meeting.
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_09: And the first thing that came out of one of our our staffs,
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_09: mouth is you're going to replace us.
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_09: And I think that that's a little too, too drastic.
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_09: This is a tool to help augment our staff's ability to wash dry.
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_09: And just like we have washing machines and we have dryers,
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_09: this is a folding machine.
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_09: And it just helps us be more productive and more effective.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_09: Yeah.
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_09: One other thing I you were mentioning something,
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_09: a key piece of this around quality.
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_09: We had the need to fold the towel with the seams in.
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_09: And actually the same, this identifies the actual seam in folds at the crack weight.
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_09: And that's right.
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_09: That's right.
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_09: I didn't think it would be able to do that.
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_09: But we said, this is the way we wanted.
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_09: And Michelle, our CEO and Monster Mondry,
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_09: was like very exactly, it has to be this way because it's the monster fold.
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_09: Yeah.
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_09: And Dina was able to do that.
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_09: It was very, I didn't even expect you'd be able to do that.
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_09: Was that a difficult challenge?
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_09: Or you're like, no big deal.
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_02: Initially, we weren't highly sure.
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_02: Otherwise, this was a small spot.
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_02: So it'd be really, it's limited.
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_02: It's actually limited by whether or not the cameras can see it.
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_02: Right? So, so if the cameras are able to see it and detect it,
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_02: and we've given it the right command,
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_02: it should be able to do it.
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_02: So we were initially sure.
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_02: And as we actually got the robots to do it,
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_02: they actually just learned.
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_02: And that was a really impressive part,
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_02: which is the same detection piece.
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_02: The robot kind of just picked it up as we give it a very, very strict standard,
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_02: it's like this needs to happen.
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_02: Also, we'll be fine.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_02: We're just all that hard, that camera, a fire quality camera.
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_02: That's actually the backstage as well.
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_02: So, staying detection is also a very top-in.
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_02: Okay, hold on.
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_10: Can this thing treat stains?
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_10: It cannot treat stains yet.
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_10: Yes, yes, yes.
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_02: Come on, it's all the same.
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, yes.
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_02: But yes, it will also be able to detect stains.
[00:49:24] SPEAKER_02: It's next wow.
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_02: So how like if it sees a stain like shove it aside,
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_08: like do you need something with that?
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:49:31] Now, if Lyndon, I was talking to one of your engineers,
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_09: and she mentioned potentially the grippers, the fellow programmers,
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_09: will eventually be able to sensey touch and get a feedback there.
[00:49:41] SPEAKER_09: Wow.
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_09: Is that coming or?
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_09: Yes.
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_09: Yes, that is coming.
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_09: One or two years.
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_09: Everything.
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_10: One to two years.
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_10: One to two yard.
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_10: Oh, since that sensing is coming and I'm good.
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_02: I'm good.
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_02: No, that is coming in a couple of months.
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_02: Oh, wow.
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_02: That's a little sensing.
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_02: Yes, that's right.
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_02: This thing because you're absolutely in six words.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sensing is one thing that's like potentially improved through what?
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_02: Because sometimes you see that it's a misgraphs.
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_02: So I'm having a sensor.
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_02: It makes a lot of ask you're a lot easier to detect that.
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_02: This was a misgraphs.
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_02: Uh-huh.
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_02: And now I need to do it.
[00:50:14] SPEAKER_02: And for example, in like use cases like a lot,
[00:50:18] SPEAKER_02: like not being full of the applications,
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_02: where it's in the stack where we need to actually pick one out at a time.
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_02: Now we know, okay, I felt like we just picked up two.
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_02: Seven point.
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_02: So since it actually helps with our overall quality and third place.
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm so excited to see this and I can't wait to see what you all are going to have.
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_08: And a month from now, a year from now,
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_08: I can't believe you did this in like six months.
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_08: This is amazing.
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_08: Um, for those of you out there,
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_08: if you are at the clean show,
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_08: you've got to stop by 867 and check out the Diner robots.
[00:50:50] SPEAKER_08: They are amazing.
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_08: Now we've been focusing on just this how-folding robot,
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_08: but there is also a sorting robot.
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_08: Yep.
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_08: And it's whatever here that's holding my shirts and stuff too.
[00:51:00] SPEAKER_08: So you're going to come and see it all.
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_08: But thank you so much, Linda.
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_08: Yes.
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_08: Before having a listen.
[00:51:06] SPEAKER_08: Thank you, my friend.
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_10: Thank you so much for having me.
[00:51:08] SPEAKER_10: Thank you so much.
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_08: Thank you for sharing your experience with us.
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_08: Absolutely.
[00:51:13] SPEAKER_08: The future of laundry technology is here today, guys.
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_10: It isn't coming in two years.
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_10: Now, perfection is coming in two years.
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_10: Ha ha ha ha.
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_10: Right.
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_10: So come check them out, guys.
[00:51:23] SPEAKER_10: Thanks for joining us on the Lawner Not Millionaire Live.
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_10: And don't forget, we're going to have three or four
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_10: of more of these at different booths.
[00:51:29] SPEAKER_10: So if you're watching from home,
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_10: hopefully you can give you a little taste
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_10: of what the clean show looks like.
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_10: And maybe it'll make you want to come in the future.
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_10: If you are here, come and talk to all these vendors.
[00:51:39] SPEAKER_10: Because man, exciting stuff happened in the industry.
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_10: This is the end of this episode,
[00:51:43] SPEAKER_08: sponsored by HN Company at dreamtross.com.
[00:51:47] SPEAKER_08: We'll see you next time.
