# Podcast Summary: Fabrice Grinda on AI, Investing, and the Future of Technology

## 1. Key Themes

### The Craig's List Parallel Doesn't Apply to AI - OpenAI Will Aggressively Defend Verticals

Unlike Craig's List, which was content to let vertical specialists take different categories, OpenAI is positioned more like Google - they will fight to win across multiple verticals. Fabrice argues that ChatGPT is an existential threat to Google and will aggressively defend territory across images, video, and coding.

**Substantiation:** "I see ChatGPT to me as an existential threat to Google because OpenAI is very aggressive, very smart, and they are very ambitious. I am sure that they don't want mid-Journey to win in images, and they don't want to run away to win in video, and they don't want cursor and lovable to win in coding, etc. I think it's way more of a Google situation where they're going to try to win as many of the verticals they can." [[00:00:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=0s) - Fabrice Grinda

### The Real AI Opportunity is Applied AI, Not Building LLMs

The smarter investment strategy is using AI to make existing businesses 10x more efficient rather than building AI infrastructure or competing directly with OpenAI. Traditional businesses that integrate AI layers will capture more sustainable value than wrapper companies with no proprietary data.

**Substantiation:** "I think the smarter way to invest in AI is actually to use the AI to make the normal businesses 10x more efficient and better... Using AI to make the existing online and offline businesses way more efficient, I think is a much more safer play at least in terms of what you invest in and what you could do versus investing in the Al Alams, where there's like 50 of them and plus GPT ever expanding what they're trying to do." [[00:14:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=14m33s) - Fabrice Grinda

He provides a concrete example: "I mean, investors and a company go to Vinted. Vinted is kind of a posh mark of Europe... When you want to sell an item, it used to be that you had to take photos and write a title and write a description and select a category and select a price. Now their AI is so good. You take photo and it does everything for you. Title, description, price, category, you just press sell." [[00:14:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=13m56s) - Fabrice Grinda

### AI Will Transform the World More Than Expected, But Much Slower Than Expected

Technology revolutions always follow this pattern - people overestimate short-term impact and underestimate long-term transformation. The actual productivity gains and adoption will take decades, not years, especially in regulated industries and government.

**Substantiation:** "Every tech revolution, people think, it's going to happen immediately. And ultimately, it takes a lot longer than people think. But the impact is a lot greater than people think... When self-driving cars, you know, first came on the road like, I don't know, 2012, 2013. People were like, oh my God, all the truck drivers are going to be out of business... And we're like 13 years later. And we're still the more truck drivers. We're still the very, very, very, very beginning." [[00:32:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=31m50s) - Fabrice Grinda

On government adoption: "When do I think AI is like, you know, doing my claims processing at the IRS or like issuing my new drugs license of the DMV, I don't see it happening in the next decade. Yeah, I'm not even sure the next two decades." [[00:52:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=52m38s) - Fabrice Grinda

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### First-Mover Advantage is Overrated - Be the Last Winner, Not the First

Contrary to conventional startup wisdom that emphasizes first-mover advantage, Fabrice argues that being late can be better. The early winners rarely become the ultimate winners, and competition serves as outsourced R&D.

**Substantiation:** "The early winners are rarely the late winners, like think of Alta Vista or Lyco or whatever the early search engines that were in word as well as Google or frankly, Frenchter. And before I, and high five intact, then my space, then Facebook, right, you want to be the last player to basically create the mode of win." [[00:15:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=15m15s) - Fabrice Grinda

### Most AI Infrastructure Companies Will Die - Including Well-Funded Ones

While billions are being invested in AI infrastructure and tooling companies, Fabrice predicts most will fail because OpenAI will deprecate them by offering better, cheaper, faster solutions directly.

**Substantiation:** "I started using all my own sacks or different sacks like Langchain and Pinecomme and on no SQL database... little by little over the course of the last two years. I ripped everything out and I moved to open AI as my back ends that I'm using whisper... companies that got tens of millions of the hundreds of millions of VC investment, I completely deprecated because I thought open AI was doing a better job, cheaper, better faster." [[00:50:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=50m26s) - Fabrice Grinda

On LLM competitors: "First of all, I think GPT opening AI 1. So, I mean, everyone else is dead, they just don't know it yet... me stall and whatever, you know, like I think all of them are gonna die. So, it's just gonna take years to play out and tens of billions of dollars." [[00:34:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=34m35s) - Fabrice Grinda

### AI Won't Replace Jobs - It Will Change Them and Increase Productivity

Counter to fears of mass unemployment, Fabrice argues that historical patterns show productivity improvements lead to higher wages and different jobs, not fewer jobs overall. The percentage of wages as GDP remains relatively flat despite technological advancement.

**Substantiation:** "I'm an economist by formation, productivity improvements have met higher wages. And so the percentage of wages of percentage GDP is basically remain reasonably flat and actually increased as productive increase. So I suspect that the answer is no. I think what, I know, we'll, a many jobs we destroyed, yes, many more jobs will be created as well. They'll be different." [[00:25:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=25m35s) - Fabrice Grinda

He notes current behavior: "Right now, most of the companies in the portfolio are hiring more people to add, to use AI more effectively and use AI to be more productive. They're not removing programming. I don't know any of our portfolio companies say, okay, we need 30% loss programmers." [[00:27:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=27m48s) - Fabrice Grinda

### Patents are Actually a Negative Signal

Completely counter to typical startup thinking, Fabrice views patents as a negative indicator because they represent wasted time and resources on something that doesn't create real competitive advantage at the early stage.

**Substantiation:** "I think there's never a mode at the beginning. When you launch your startup, you have nothing. You have your team, basically. And it thinks like whatever patterns I don't go with the paper they're written on. So I don't consider these to be modes. In fact, if you tell me you have a pattern, I'd probably put that as a negative. It means you spend money and time in something this useless. So probably more likely than not, if you have a pattern, I'm not going to invest in you." [[00:17:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=17m15s) - Fabrice Grinda

### Agents Won't Disintermediate Marketplaces as Much as People Think

Despite widespread belief that AI agents will cut out marketplaces by finding best deals across platforms, Fabrice argues most e-commerce patterns (browsing, specific search, fulfillment) still favor concentrated marketplaces.

**Substantiation:** On window shopping: "There is zero role for an LLLum to play there. Now, do I think if they put infinite resources to it, could they kind of figure out how to create a feed similar to vintage? Maybe. But because most of the content comes when winter takes all marketplaces, most of the content we're becoming from vintage anyway." [[00:20:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=20m36s) - Fabrice Grinda

On fulfillment: "I don't see GPD wanting to do fulfillment, inventory management, having inventory, etc. Like that is not the result of that. So if you go and look at their, you know, tech roadmap for the next three years, it's not even the thousands priority. Like, you know, let's have shipping centuries and fulfillment solutions and last mile logistics." [[00:22:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=22m6s) - Fabrice Grinda

## 3. Companies Identified

### **Vinted**
**Description:** Consumer-to-consumer clothing and fashion marketplace in Europe (comparable to Poshmark)

**Why Mentioned:** Exemplary use of AI to enhance marketplace efficiency and break down European market barriers through auto-translation and streamlined listing creation.

**Quotes:** "Vinted is kind of a posh mark of Europe. There are a much better consumer to consumer, clothing platform and fashion marketplace. And they are crushing it. And they've done amazing things with AI. So for instance, if you're in France, and you're looking at a listing, it may very well be that the listing is from Germany or Poland. They've auto-translated the listings. You're talking to the seller. But perhaps the seller is in Poland and it's auto-translated conversations... When you want to sell an item, it used to be that you had to take photos and write a title and write a description and select a category and select a price. Now their AI is so good. You take photo and it does everything for you. Title, description, price, category, you just press sell. They have automated customer care. And so the cost structure is low." [[00:13:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=13m45s) - Fabrice Grinda

### **Instacart**
**Description:** Grocery delivery marketplace

**Why Mentioned:** Example of how major marketplaces are implementing conversational AI for considered purchases.

**Quotes:** "Same thing Instacart now has like, oh, you know, this weekend I'm doing a barbecue. What should I cook? Whatever, and like they have recommendations." [[00:23:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=23m30s) - Fabrice Grinda

### **Amazon**
**Description:** E-commerce giant

**Why Mentioned:** Example of marketplace implementing AI assistant (Rufus) and maintaining dominance despite AI agent predictions.

**Quotes:** "Amazon has Rufus. You can ask questions on which product to buy from Rufus. Maybe you're doing a Rufus, maybe you're doing GPT." [[00:23:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=23m18s) - Fabrice Grinda

"eBay and Amazon have 43% of USC commerce and some verticals that's like 90%." [[00:21:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=21m27s) - Fabrice Grinda

### **Curated.com**
**Description:** Sports equipment marketplace using human curation

**Why Mentioned:** Example of considered purchase category vulnerable to AI disruption, with disappointing exit ($300M on $200M revenue).

**Quotes:** "So curated.com, which is used humans for like sports equipment. Now for travel, for travel, and they are not selling, you know, like curated, I think sold for 300 million, they'd reach 200 million. So it's not a very good exit. And I think the fear is it's going to be disintermediated by the LLM." [[00:23:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=22m51s) - Fabrice Grinda

### **Gamma**
**Description:** Presentation/document creation AI tool

**Why Mentioned:** Example of capital-efficient AI company achieving scale ($50M ARR) without massive funding.

**Quotes:** "Gamma just hit like 50 million dollars in the RR. And they haven't raised a lot of capital." [[00:45:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=45m45s) - Fabrice Grinda

### **Ovoco**
**Description:** Pan-European car parts marketplace

**Why Mentioned:** Example of AI enabling pan-European marketplace through translation and integration.

**Quotes:** "We're investors in a company like Ovoco and Carparts at its pan-European or Vinted for Fashion." [[00:39:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=39m30s) - Fabrice Grinda

## 4. People Identified

### **Jeff Bezos**
**Description:** Founder of Amazon

**Why Mentioned:** Example of founder with clear strategic plan from the beginning who maintained product focus while scaling.

**Quotes:** "Some people have a plan and they stick to the plan and they follow it through and then they adjust accordingly. I've probably Jeff Bezos at Amazon. He was like, I'm going to start with books because there's a long tail. I'm going to be in Seattle because I want to be right next to Ingram, the largest book publisher where it can have access to all their inventory. And from there, I'm going to go to the other high value categories." [[00:18:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=18m18s) - Fabrice Grinda

"It's probably true with Mark Zuckerberg and probably the larger extent with Jeff Bezos." [[00:03:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=3m7s) - Fabrice Grinda (on maintaining product CEO focus at scale)

### **Steve Jobs**
**Description:** Co-founder and former CEO of Apple

**Why Mentioned:** Example of CEO who maintained product focus and control at massive scale.

**Quotes:** "Some people have been able to retain it for a long time. You know, Steve Jobs, that Apple was able to do that for a long time when he came back." [[00:03:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=3m1s) - Fabrice Grinda

### **Mark Zuckerberg**
**Description:** Founder and CEO of Meta/Facebook

**Quotes:** "It's probably true with Mark Zuckerberg and probably the larger extent with Jeff Bezos." [[00:03:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=3m7s) - Fabrice Grinda

## 5. Operating Insights

### Execute First, Build Moats Later - There Are No Moats at Day Zero

Contrary to investor obsession with defensibility at pitch stage, true competitive advantages only emerge through execution. At launch, your only asset is your team. Network effects, brand, data, and scale all come from successful execution, not planning.

**Substantiation:** "I think there's never a mode at the beginning. When you launch your startup, you have nothing. You have your team, basically... No, your mode is your execution. The more traffic you have, the more users you have, the more data you have, the more brand, the more revenue you have, the more... That's your mode. And so especially in marketplace, that don't work in fact businesses, right? Like every more seller is bringing the word, buyers, the buyers, the sellers, the sellers. And then you create this beautiful flywheel where it ends up being winner takes vote. So at the day zero, there is no mode. The mode comes day year one, year two, year three, as you're executing." [[00:17:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=17m37s) - Fabrice Grinda

### Implement Annual Life Audits with Structured Email Reflection

Create a forcing function for introspection by sending yourself an annual email evaluating your average day (not best day) across personal and professional life. The email format forces structured thinking and sharing with friends/family provides external perspective.

**Substantiation:** "My recommendation is once a year, send yourself an email. You take a weekend, you take a night where you're basically assessing where you are and your personal and professional life. How happy are you on a day-to-day basis? How about the theory of it, the reality of it? Not the best day, the average day... The email forces you to, okay, these are things I really like. These are the things I really dislike. These are the things maybe you could be improved and this is maybe what I can do about it." [[00:05:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=5m6s) - Fabrice Grinda

### Design for the Average Day Experience, Not Peak Moments

When evaluating career and life decisions, focus on what the typical day looks like rather than the highlights or the worst moments. If the grinding average day doesn't feel right, that's a signal you're already past the point where you should have made a change.

**Substantiation:** "Usually if you have the sense of something is not right, it's usually a sense that's ready too late. You should already have moved on, right? Like if you're not happy in the day to day, hard effects... The wrong feeling is you're not getting product-market fit. You don't like your co-founder, you're working hard, but it feels like it's a grind versus fun. You can work hard and have it be fun versus work hard and have it be like I'm eating glass because I must or whatever." [[00:06:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=6m20s) - Fabrice Grinda

### Make Search Boxes Dual-Purpose for Specific and Conversational Queries

E-commerce sites need to redesign search to handle both specific product searches (LG OLED C3 65 inch) and conversational discovery (I need a TV for this budget and room). This shouldn't be two separate interfaces but one intelligent routing system.

**Substantiation:** "I think the trend that will be your search box at the top of your e-commerce site or marketplace is going to have to be twofold. One is specific search. If you, I could type, you know, LGO, LADC3, or I can type, I'm looking for a TV. This is my budget room and a lot. What should I buy? And I think both your, it should not be two separate search rack parts." [[00:24:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=23m53s) - Fabrice Grinda

### Focus AI Investments on Reasonable Valuations in Applied Categories

While everyone chases foundation model and wrapper companies at inflated valuations, the better risk-adjusted returns come from AI-enhanced traditional businesses at normal valuations with actual revenue.

**Substantiation:** "I'm investing seeds with companies are 150K a month in revenue at 12 pre. I'm investing in A's at 23 pre raising seven, and they're doing a million and a half a month in revenues. I'm investing companies doing two, three, four, five million a month at 50 pre raising 15 because no one is loving these categories. I'd like to be contrarian." [[00:34:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=34m2s) - Fabrice Grinda

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The Generational Wealth Transfer is Creating a Unique Window for B2B Marketplace Adoption

While much attention focuses on AI capabilities, Fabrice briefly mentions an overlooked accelerant: SMB owners in their 60s-70s whose children don't want the businesses are selling to private equity and other parties, creating a generational shift that naturally enables technology adoption. This demographic wave may matter more than the technology itself for B2B marketplace success timing.

**Substantiation:** "The good news is the behavior change is kind of happening on its own, because the owners of these SMBs were now in their 60s, 70s, and their kids don't want to take over. So there's a generational shift where they're selling them to other parties for private equity, which is leading to change in the application technology. And the kind of the same thing is happening in the large enterprise, the decision makers that are starting to retire, they were all into RFPs, and now the millennials that are coming and taking over, they're more into marketplaces." [[00:36:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=35m52s) - Fabrice Grinda

### AI is Making Pan-European Companies Viable for the First Time - A Massive but Quiet Opportunity

Buried in the discussion about translation capabilities is a profound insight: AI is eliminating the linguistic barriers that prevented European marketplace consolidation. This creates a unique arbitrage opportunity for the next 5-10 years where capital-efficient companies can build continent-scale businesses in categories that were previously fragmented by language. Combined with integrated shipping and payments, this is creating "European champions" that weren't possible before.

**Substantiation:** "They have auto translation of the conversation of the listings, but then they also have it built internally as shipping and payments company, so they can actually ship for cheap between Poland and France... It makes it easy to have a pan-European company for the first time. And so now we're investors in a company like Ovoco and Carparts at its pan-European or Vinted for Fashion." [[00:39:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=39m4s) - Fabrice Grinda

"If you don't have that, that's not enough. And they can't do it, for instance. You could translate, but it's not going to work you as to France, because the shipping is too expensive." [[00:39:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGzSt9Dvyc4&t=39m15s) - Fabrice Grinda
