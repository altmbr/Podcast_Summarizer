[00:00:00] Real innovation happens at the age of what people think is possible.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_01: From losing his job in banking to building one of Australia's fastest-growing accounting groups,
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_01: Brad Kelly turns setback into design.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_01: A mistake is really just feedback.
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_01: The question is what do you do with it?
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_01: He started with $50,000 and built Kelly Partners, now a 400 million firm serving thousands of clients
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_01: through a unique partner ownership model.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_01: A business is better if it's configured, operated and thinks about the long term.
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_00: We talk about the levers that took it from zero to scale, the systems that made it durable
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: and what success really means beyond money.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm not a conqueror, I'm a mission-based person.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_01: Here's Brad Kelly, the outsider who built an empire in accounting.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_01: What's the secret sauce?
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_01: The question is...
[00:00:51] Guys, let me tell you a 30-second story and I promise you won't regret it.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_01: So when I started to take investing seriously,
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: I really didn't have anyone to discuss my ideas with.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: I knew no one in the investing space and therefore my process felt kind of lonely and very slow as well.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_01: So I went on and found a community of serious micro-cap investors,
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: people that actually liked me in the work.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_01: And I let you in on a little secret.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_01: It's called microcapclub.com.
[00:01:16] Members have profiled more than 1,300 companies and over 300 of those have gone on to become multi-baggers.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: That's the power of this group.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_01: Tell us something that you'll get exposed to ideas as well before institutions ever notice them.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: And if you want to find great businesses and surround yourself with some of the best investors in the world,
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: head to microcapclub.com and consider applying to join or becoming a subscriber.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: That's microcapclub.com.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_01: Nothing in this conversation is financial advice.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: I'm a whole position in some of the companies we discuss or have other interests.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: I always aim to stay objective but please take everything with a grain of salt and do your own research.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_01: What do I need to know about your earliest days to understand who you are today?
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_01: David, great to be with you.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: I think born with five brothers, two half brothers, so eight boys,
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: I think coming from a big family is very influential.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: My parents owned a business or my father was a partner in a business, an import business.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: I think growing up with a business-owning father meant that I knew that you had to work very hard
[00:02:25] and that you had to enjoy what you were doing and you would enjoy it by working very hard.
[00:02:34] I think that my father had an accountant that
[00:02:39] stole money off him and I think there's no doubt that influence me strongly.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: I had a mum who encouraged me in education to read and to grow and educate.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: Both my parents instilled in me that you could do good things if you set your mind to it and
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: that you should try and help other people.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: I think that's beautiful.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: If someone just listens to you, no one would tell, okay, this guy just built a 400 million
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_01: enterprise value company. Why don't you guide us to how did you go from
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_01: essentially nothing or very little to building such a huge enterprise?
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: Yes, that's a great question on the enterprise value. David earlier just mentioning,
[00:03:40] I think today the market cap is about $480 million Australian dollars.
[00:03:46] We've probably got about $100 million debt over the group.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_00: That market cap is the holding companies 51% interest in 35 businesses.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: And so there's 49% of that business that isn't listed,
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: that must be worth something, you think.
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: So, Manglefield put a discount to public markets valuation,
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: even if it's totally worth a third of what the listed piece is worth,
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_00: then it's a chunk of your amount of value created out of a $50,000 cash investment
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: in 200,000 of my personal buildings, personal accounting buildings.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: How do you create that much value?
[00:04:36] Exactly.
[00:04:36] Well, there's certain steps, but the first piece is the core, you know,
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: mastery of your own profession, getting qualified at something and knowing how to do something
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: very well. For me, it was being an accountant, became a chartered accountant, did a master's degree in tax.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: And then I had practiced between the ages of 18 and 30,
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: before I started the firm in 2006 with my wife Rebecca.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: And so that core mastery of your profession is really important, because
[00:05:13] true confidence comes from deep competence.
[00:05:17] And so once you know your competent at something,
[00:05:20] you tend to be more confident that no matter what happens, you'll be okay.
[00:05:25] Then, you know, we built this little pyramid behind me, it's called the Progress Pyramid,
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: and that's where I've sort of thought out what are the parts of a business.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: And on the other side of that pyramid is Maslow's hierarchy of needs. So
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: the Maslow piece is really, you know, so the second piece is mastery of profession,
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: the second piece is sort of mastery of self, you know, you need to have gone through those
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: stages of Maslow's hierarchy to, you know, meet your basic needs and, you know, start to feel
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_00: appreciated and get beyond yourself. And I always see if you go up this side of the pyramid,
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: then you then you've sort of earned the right self-actualization, but really getting past yourself
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_00: to come onto this side of the pyramid. Got a little one here actually.
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_00: Nice. So, yeah, so I always think that life is really built up the
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_00: Maslow's piece. And then if you can get up past yourself, you can then come down
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: under, under here and start to build up, you know, from these core ideas of mission values and
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_00: vision. So, you know, what is your mission? Why do you exist? You know, why do you exist?
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: From my set of, you know, my perspective, you know, why God put you on earth and what are you
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: meant to be doing with your gifts and talents? So, that's the mission piece. The values piece is
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: one of the core values that are important to you. So, for me, person, brothers, keep your promises
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: and work as part of a team. And then the vision piece, you know, if this all goes well,
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: what difference could you make? What would, what would success, if you like, or what I call achieving
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: goals look like? That's the big piece. So, master profession, master yourself, and then if you're
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_00: going to go into a business, go into it because you feel like you're called to do that,
[00:07:22] to use your talents for the benefit of other people. And hopefully, that vehicle, that business
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: can help you focus for a long time on that mission, values and vision. If you do that piece,
[00:07:35] you've got this internal energy that no matter the difficulties that occur in building a business,
[00:07:42] or anything, you know, a family or your life or anything, you're, you tend to be able to stick to it
[00:07:51] longer and with more enthusiasm than other people because you've got deeper roots as to why you're
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: there. So, you know, that's, to me, that's the game. That's so interesting because you seem to be
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_01: extremely intentional about every single system and everything you've built within Cali Partners.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_01: And I've been kind of studying you in different shapes and forms for a couple of years now. And
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: it always like struck me the fact that you are so intentional because sometimes you just study
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_01: like other business people and it seems like they stumbled upon success. And it feels like
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_01: the way you did it was super intentional and it started from studying other people. So maybe,
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: can you teach us what levers really make the difference? And like, yeah, just it's, it's very fascinating.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: So maybe you can just start from, from the levers that really moved. David, I think. Yeah,
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_01: to your observation, I think a lot of people, so I don't like the word success. I like the,
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_00: the concept of achieving your goals. So to me, a successful person is somebody who's achieved their
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_00: own goals, not the perceptions of what success is to other people. So that's the first thing.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: So I left school at 18. I went into chartered accounting at Price Waterhouse as an undergrad.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_00: And after four and a half years, I joined an investment bank. I lost my job because I didn't
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_00: fit in with other people. I didn't know what I wanted to do. My dad gave me two books.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: How do we, friends and influence people and think and grow rich? Think and grow rich,
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_00: set fine people that have achieved their goals. And that, you know, that in their words,
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: it's been successful and asked and what they did. So I wrote to 80 prominent Australians. I interviewed
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: 34 of them and I asked them, you know, what had made the difference for them. And I put that into
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: a book and turn that into a best-selling book that I promoted to other young people that were trying
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_00: to work out what's life all about. But what I learned through that was two, you know,
[00:10:02] many things. But the first big one was that you don't want to aim your life at success.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_00: Success is really being able to achieve your goal. So what is your mission and living your mission?
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_00: When I lost my job, I felt a huge relief because I'd really been doing whatever everyone else
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_00: told me to do. Come first in this, get this work for this firm, get this job. And that's success.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: But I found that very empty because it wasn't what I was meant to do. I was sitting in an investment
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: bank, had the job everyone else wanted. But it wasn't, it didn't resonate with me. So the first thing is
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_00: trying to work out your own mission, values and vision and then having the courage to work out how
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: to achieve your goals within that context. Now, there's a whole separate piece on how to achieve
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: your goals. But certainly the first piece of that is that intentionality to understand yourself
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: and what you're here for. And the biggest lesson I learned through my book was that all of your
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: goals will always be achieved with and through other people. And so in trying to write my first book,
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_00: I didn't know how to write it. I didn't know anything, you know, how to design it,
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: edit it, sub-edit it, proofread it, type-set it, distribute it, do the promotion. I didn't know any of
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_00: it. But I'd learned that if you ask people that knew how to do it, they, you know, I found a
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_00: designer who found an editor who put a whole team together. I had 300 years of experience across
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_00: these 10 people helping me. And that is the thing that made the difference. So in my view,
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_00: the thing that makes it much more likely that you will achieve your goals is hanging around people
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_00: that, you know, share your values, have expertise, encourage you to achieve your goals and are prepared
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: to help you. So there's for me the two big things, knowing how to achieve your goals and the first step
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: of that is knowing that, you know, everything you want to achieve is achieved with and through people.
[00:12:10] So basically what I'm hearing is that you studied directly or learned directly from other people
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_01: to build the base for your success or like the foundation for your success. And so again,
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: David, I don't call it my six. I call it, sorry about that. Yeah. So for me, for me, you know, it was
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_00: a way to discover my own mission and to live my mission, which yes, I do believe is the ultimate
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_00: success in life. But for me, I think that word is often associated with fast cars and other things.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: And fast cars are great. But for me, the meaning of life comes from living your mission.
[00:12:55] So what I was lucky to do is having met so many of these people I could form a view as to who had
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: really lived their mission and felt good about the way they'd lived as they were much older when I met
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_00: them and who had sort of played in a way that is they got older, they weren't necessarily, they were
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_00: happy that they had had some success. But that often lost a lot of themselves and their friends and
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_00: family in the pursuit of titles and what I call external totems, TOT, EMS, external signs of
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_00: so-called success. So I was like, you know, to your earlier comment, it is about
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: it deep intentionality about who do you want to be when you're 80? I think I've heard Jeff
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: Bezos use that, Michael Hill, the Jouler in New Zealand had a 30-year plan and he always talked about,
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: you know, everything you do, do it within the context of a 30-year plan. I use 25-year plans, but
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_00: they're just a bit more round numbered for me. I think I've read his book when I was 25, so I thought
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_00: 25 and 25 was better. But yeah, that's kind of been the journey.
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_00: Well, that's that's so amazing planning 25 years ahead. And so what exactly are you planning 25
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_01: years ahead? Well, when I was 25, I was clear having written my first book that, you know,
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_00: you could be married, you could be single, you could be at priest. I decided I wanted to be married,
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_00: I wanted to have kids. I wanted to be in business, but a business where every time we did well,
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_00: other people did well. And I wasn't quite sure what that was, but I was in accounting again at that
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_00: point. And I read a sermon that talked about diamonds under your feet. So often where you are,
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: the story and the sermon is that there's a gentleman, he owns a farm, a guy goes to buy the farm,
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_00: and the gentleman who's going to buy the farm says, oh, on your mantle piece, there's a rock,
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_00: where did you get the rock? You said, oh, the stream, I'll show it to you. And he showed the man
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_00: the stream and he bought the farm. And that farm became the biggest open cut diamond mine in America.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_00: And the whole idea of the story was the man who was selling the farm was going to look, you know,
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_00: in greener pastures, but instead where he was was already a green, you know, was really where the
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: diamonds were. And so so often people are looking over there or looking over there instead of looking
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_00: inside themselves and where they're standing to say, well, what is the massive difference I could
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: make where I am? So I'm in an accounting firm. I make the observation, the accounting industry's
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_00: huge that accountants can really make a difference to their clients, but so often they don't.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_00: And that the businesses aren't very well run. So I'm thinking, well, maybe I could improve what's
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: going on in this business that I'm in. So I started to do that for my boss. My boss wasn't as
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_00: enthusiastic as me. Didn't didn't have the mission. Didn't didn't have the energy, the enthusiasm.
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_00: And that was disappointing. But I let me to think, well, maybe I can just practice on this business
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_00: how to fix these businesses. So I was getting tapes and books and reading them and saying, well, how
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: would you, you know, always work as if you own the business that you're working in because one day
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_00: you may well and then you own yourself and all your good habits or bad habits. So that's what I
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: started to do, improve his business. I left that business, went to another accounting firm, did
[00:16:53] SPEAKER_00: the same there. Left that one went to another accounting firm, did the same there. And what I learned
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: was that they're tremendous businesses, but mostly badly run. So why don't I try to improve,
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_00: improve them by ultimately starting a firm for my friend in March 2006. And then in June 2006,
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_00: my boss gave me an offer different to what he promised. And I said, well, life's too short to
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_00: work with people at life. And I asked my wife and she said, Brett, we should start a firm.
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_00: And so we did. I think that's very interesting and resonant thought with me because
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: having a partner that supports you, I think that's everything. So how do you pick the right partner?
[00:17:54] Yeah, so you need to either have a partner that is fully supportive or no partner at all,
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_00: because you can't build a business with somebody in your house, you know, your intimate partner
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_00: that's against the idea. So it was definitely Rebecca's idea as much or more than mine.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_00: She was like, you know, Beckett worked for me and she was like, you're great at this, you should
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_00: just be starting a firm. And we had a nine month old child and I was like, well, hang on, it's a
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_00: big undertaking. And I will say, David, it put me under enormous pressure. But I had her
[00:18:33] supports. I felt that I could do that. And then I, and then I, I would say that choosing the right
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_00: partner. So here are some observations. There's, I think it's the gentleman that built 3G capital
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_00: that coined the phrase poor, smart and driven PSDs. And both my wife and I were from
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_00: moderate backgrounds. Certainly weren't wealthy backgrounds. We were both university educated
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_00: and smart. And we were both very driven. I knew that back, you know, who was 23, I was, I think,
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_00: 29 at the time, was prepared to live on $100 a week. We shared one car. We moved, you know, we
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_00: ultimately sold my apartment, put the money into the business and, and bought as much smaller,
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_00: less salubrious, what rented in a terrible area and then built a little place in an even worse area.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_00: I would drive 45 minutes to work every day. We were living in one of the worst areas in Sydney.
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_00: But we did that. And I said to her, you know, if we're prepared to live very moderately now,
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: you know, in 10 years time, I think will be much better off. And, you know, within five years,
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_00: we're definitely much better off than we would have been if we'd stayed in a firm. But in that five
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: years, I worked six days a week. I've never worked Sundays. I didn't take a single holiday,
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: not a public holiday or any other holiday. And I worked typically, you know, I'd get up at three,
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_00: I'd be at the office at 3.45 am and I would work tall. Six, get home by seven, have dinner,
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_00: and then work for me until 11. And because we had a young child and then a second young child
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_00: two years later, back had a hands full with young children. So I don't think she noticed my absence
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_00: as much as she might have if we didn't have young children. And although she does reflect now,
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_00: David, that it was extremely difficult on her. And I wouldn't have been as aware of that then as
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_00: I, as I am now. But, you know, at that point, I was just worried about going broke. So, you know,
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_00: we've got in the book that will thorn, I could wrote called the outsiders. One of the observations
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_00: of those eight people is that eight CEOs is that they all have what are called pre-modern values.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_00: And so today, finding, you know, as a man, finding a woman or as a woman, finding a man that has
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_00: old-fashioned values in the sense that, you know, if you get married, you're committed to being married,
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_00: if you start a project, you're committed to finishing the project and you know it's going to be
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_00: very hard and you understand sacrifices necessary to make progress. Finding somebody who's prepared
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_00: to make any sacrifice is very difficult today because sacrifice is pretty much out of fashion.
[00:21:38] But, I think it exists. So, you've got to find somebody who pretty, you know, pre-modern values,
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_00: pretty old-fashioned values that's committed to, you know, for their kids and their kids, kids to be
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_00: better off. That's not easy. And frankly, it's a reason that most people can't build anything,
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_00: is that it is a two-person job or you've got to have no partner at all and most people have
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_00: partners who are sort of fair-weather friends. They're there if it's easy, but they're not too
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_00: interested in being there when it's hard and it's often very, very much more difficult than you can
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_00: describe. I love the book Shoot-Og by Phil Knight because it describes so clearly how difficult it
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: is to start a business to do it properly. And I think most books on business tend to just highlight
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_00: the good things that don't tend to highlight the, you know, the difficult things.
[00:22:37] Yeah, I think that's perfect. And another thing one notes when I'm listening to you is that you
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_01: are a bookworm or you read loads of books and study history's greatest entrepreneurs, right?
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_01: And so, who are some of the people you've studied the closest? And I know you got to know or
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_01: meet some of your mentors like William Thorndyke. So yeah, just curious, you know, more about that.
[00:23:03] So I think that there's this idea I have, David, that as you make progress, if you'll sort of step
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_00: out in faith and keep doing what you're meant to be doing, the books and the ideas and the videos
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_00: and the podcasts and the people tend to turn up on your path as you need them. So I read a book
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_00: by Philip Fisher called of common stocks and uncommon profits. And I love that book then and I love it now.
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_00: And that led me to Warren Buffett. And so I think from about the age of 16, I read everything
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_00: that there is to, you know, that I could get my hands on of Warren and Charlie. And so the idea of our KPGH,
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_00: our Kelly Partners group holdings holding company came from the Berkshire structure and that idea.
[00:23:53] From Warren speaking to Charlie in my mind saying, Charlie, you're a lawyer, you can't make money
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_00: on early rates, you need to be an investor. I got this idea that well, the only thing I could
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_00: invest in was accounting firms because that's what I understood. Plus they were underpriced. And
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_00: within my circular competence and nobody knew necessarily more about smaller firms under 10 million
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_00: than I think. So I thought, okay, that makes sense. And then David Oglevy branded for the idea of
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_00: branded professional global services firm. Bernard Arnoh, Louis Vuitton, Louis Hennessy, the idea of
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_00: buying an old-of business and modernising it and proving it while retaining its heritage. And then
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_00: people like Rupert Murdoch and Mark Leonard who are both serial acquires. So Marx talked about a
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_00: lot but I don't know how many newspapers Rupert Murdoch's bought and media properties but he's bought a
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_00: lot of them and it's an Australian. And so his story as a young guy sort of 80s, 90s was
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_00: as an Australian going out into the world building a global business. I thought it was very inspiring.
[00:25:09] So certainly all of those people and then as I've gone along,
[00:25:15] has been countless people like Will Thondex book the outsiders at the time that I first read it
[00:25:21] it resonated with me because I lost my job in an investment bank because I didn't fit him with other
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_00: people because I'm a bit of an outsider by mindset and mentality. So that sort of reassured me that
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_00: you know I wasn't crazy. It was definitely different but the difference can be a good thing.
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_00: You know a lot of people like the idea of differentiation but they don't like the idea of
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_00: difference next sort of the same thing. And so as you sort of as I went along I'd read you know I
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_00: bought the Simon and Shuster self help cassette tape catalog in 1997 2000 tapes and subsequently
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_00: listened to all of them. Every one of those speakers in inspiring people had a different view that
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_00: inspired me. People like Jim Rohn who said you know don't ask for life to be easier
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_00: get better. I always like that. Those types of just observations, six Ziggles and other
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_00: big American speakers said if you help enough people get their goals you'll get your goals.
[00:26:32] So you know and like I look on my bookshelf there's every single one of those books I've learned
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_00: something from whether it's the Bain and Co Founders mentality book which I think's great again
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_00: because as a founder they've got I think nine traits of a founder and I sort of ticked them all
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_00: away. Yeah that sort of explains me to me a little bit better. King of Capital snow wall they
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_00: great books, Les Schwab's books you know I love them. I just you know I look out at there I love books
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_00: on pretty much anything. You can learn from other industries and other endeavors fiction etc.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: to help you in your life which helps you in your business and that's a point I would make is a lot
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_00: of people that try to learn how to get better at business but getting better as a person and better
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_00: in life helps your business probably more than anything. I think Warren Buffett talks a lot
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_00: about investing in yourself because when you chat up to meet people your cumulative efforts
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_00: to reform and improve yourself is what people interact with.
[00:27:42] You mentioned there you felt like an outsider. Do you still feel like an outsider?
[00:27:49] No question. I think you know and you want to cultivate that sense in yourself in that
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_00: if ten people tell you something you know if a problem if an opportunity problem or
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_00: anything arises and you find yourself agreeing with everyone then most people are not
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_00: Solomon and definitely not God they're not all knowing in all ways so you want to be careful that
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_00: you're not always just agreeing for the sake of it or agreeing so nobody challenges you
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_00: and importantly that you don't challenge yourself. I heard something by Larry Ellis and the
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_00: other day and he said you know if you have a good idea you'll sort of know it's a good idea because
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_00: people will tell you you're crazy and you should forget about it and it could be true that you
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_00: are crazy and you should forget about it but real innovation happens at the edge of what people
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_00: think is possible and so often you've got to push yourself to do the things that you know
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_00: a right and can really work even if and especially if other people in your industry don't do those
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_00: things. There was certainly the case with us you know when I started accounting firms were
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_00: was sort of there'd been three failed listed accounting groups in Australia and the idea that we
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_00: were even contemplating a public listing of this type of business was we were very much scorned and
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_00: you know mocked so it's not you know it's not um I don't want to give up my outside of mentality
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_00: I always want to challenge a status quo and think think things through and try and find the next level
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_00: in societal solution. Do you think that after conquering accounting worldwide there are other
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_01: industries that are similar let's say law or something like that that you could use your outside
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_01: their mindset to kind of uh yeah conquer. I think there's a lot of places to invest and make an impact
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_00: but I don't I'm not a conqueror I'm a mission based person so I don't have any particular
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_00: desire to do anything but continue to grow a global you know Australia's global accounting firm.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_00: I think the runway we haven't even scratched the surface of what's possible. Our runway revenue is
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_00: $150 million you know deloied in the US last year turned over I think $27 billion as a huge
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_00: amount of runway you know we're 20 years old I think the oldest big four accounting firm is 185
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: years old so we can stick at what we're doing for another hundred years without question.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_00: And frankly I'm very interested in taxes and tax policy and the
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_00: panicious impact that taxes have on people's freedom to build their own financial independence
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_00: so that that's what drew me to what I'm doing and what I'm excited about. I think our models
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_00: are applicable in other places and certainly we could involve ourselves you know in
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_00: in deploying our model into other other places but I don't think the you know I think Sam
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_00: Moulton could have done more than just supermarkets but I don't think you would have
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_00: very if he had you know Buffett and Munger are asked I think in the Netflix documentary inside
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_00: Bill's mind there's a I think it's in that where there's a video and they are sitting on a
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_00: lounge together and somebody says to them you know hey you two what do you attribute with your success
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_00: in you know in in business and in unison they answer focus so I think focus is is very much
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_00: underrated yeah that's that's a beautiful answer and and so what sort of systems have you built
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_01: that really makes Kelly Partners unique and the kind of the engine work seamlessly obviously
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_01: every business is kind of messing their own way so I'm not saying like you're completely seamless but
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_01: just give us some examples of the systems you've built and what makes them unique so there's a
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_01: lot of uniqueness in our business firstly there's a holding company that's a permanent capital
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_00: vehicle which is very unusual accounting firms are typically partnerships that distribute all of
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_00: their profits I don't retain a new profit and so they don't have a hundred year structure and so
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_00: they can't have a hundred year mindset I think that's very very important secondly we have a 51
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_00: 49 structure in our operating businesses that means that leadership is dealt with him that in most
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_00: accounting firms there's four partners with 25 percentage and rather than making decisions rapidly
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_00: in the interests of the business they're typically constantly politicking to try and control a boat
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_00: we've removed that by virtue of our structure which which helps and and just adds massive focus
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_00: on decision making and a massive amount of nimbleness and speed the third thing we'll set
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_00: we put a central management team together the firms pay six and a half percent of revenue for
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_00: the central services team and two and a half percent for IP so nine percent of revenue that gives us
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_00: as the firm grows that money centrally grows so that we can invest under these firms to remove
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_00: activities from them that don't add value I think that's extraordinarily unique it's you know
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_00: within the flywheel him Collins talks about mission and fuel so you have to have a mission to move
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_00: the flywheel but you have to have fuel to power it and so we have this internally generated funding
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_00: to drive that flywheel which I think is not understood not appreciated and virtually impossible to
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_00: replicate and then deep within the business there's a thousand pages of unique documentation for
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_00: manuals and systems of processes right across the board from how we you know how we first
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_00: think about the business so this progress pyramid idea those bottom slices after here
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_00: this is all foundations so mission values vision strategy and structure that's the bit that most
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_00: businesses don't have we win on the black one mission values and vision and if you don't have this
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_00: you just don't have a very powerful foundation above that people process clients financial
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_00: IT risk marketing growth and succession they're all operational parts of the business that we've
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_00: addressed in unique ways and we put that together in a critical activity network which means
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_00: that the the network of activities a unique and different that gives us the best likelihood of
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_00: achieving good results with each business over a long period of time most importantly the partners
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_00: all sign ten-year partnership agreements we've got 105 plus partners so we've got more than a
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_00: thousand years of commitment from partners signed up and how you're going to beat that level of
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_00: commitment you know let's say David you've got an army I've got an army you've got a hundred
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_00: bloats I've got a hundred bloats my guys have agreed to fight the fight for a hundred you know
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_00: for ten years each so for a thousand years and your folks have decided to sign a ten-minute
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_00: contract meaning their mercenaries they can leave whenever they want who's going to win that five
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_00: you know so the inherent structure of the business is so strong and so unique that we think that
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_00: it's not definitely not perfect as you said every business is challenging every day we've got
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_00: you know messes to clean up here there and wherever because we're constantly buying businesses
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_00: and cleaning up messes as well and we're going to make mistakes we do make mistakes we've made all
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_00: sorts of mistakes you know I learned very early on through my book that a mistake really just
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_00: feedback the question is what do you do with it so we keep looking for feedback aggressively
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_00: we're going to keep making mistakes getting feedback and then the real question is how do we respond
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_00: how do we react to you know to to make it better so you know there's some of the highlights much of
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_00: the secret source we don't talk about publicly there's no real benefit to us to to share any of that
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_00: I was very lucky last October Mark Leonard interviewed me in front of 300 of his M&A execs and
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_00: he said to me I said Brad that was great you know just don't talk publicly about what you do
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_00: anymore just in bites you know competition and mimicry and why do you need to teach your competitors
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_00: anything yeah I think Mark learned that from experience so it makes sense that he told you that
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_01: and I mean like he's the he's the goat of VMS so congratulations for for getting
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_01: invited to to speak there one thing I wanted to ask you is how do you decide which systems to
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_01: destroy well I think if you look at Jim Collins frameworking good to grade you know
[00:36:48] six steps so disciplined people disciplined thinking discipline action right in the middle step three
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_00: is um
[00:36:59] base of brutal facts so I would argue that we're not destroying systems we're just acknowledging
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_00: the systems don't work and they're already destroyed themselves so it's really more akin as
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: you know to finding a dead body and you know calling the ambulance to pick it up and clean it up and
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_00: take it away so many businesses are full of systems that don't work haven't worked never going to work
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_00: but nobody's faced the brutal facts and done anything about it so we are clear-eyed in that respect
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_00: and happy to um to tidy things up and you also mentioned like there are always things to fix within
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_01: the businesses that you acquire and do you have a team who goes there and fixes things or who's
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_01: like in charge to fix things yeah so we have 42 people in our services team working under the
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_00: businesses and so depending on what the thing is I'll give an example I bring one of my good young
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_00: up skies yesterday and I said oh I'm sad I said we've got these you know we've got some of
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_00: the lessons as to what doesn't work so let's write under each part of the progress period what
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_00: doesn't work and then write next to it what does work and let's be a bit more directed and intentional
[00:38:22] about insisting on some of these things would do work so Mother Teresa said don't fight evil do good
[00:38:30] and so a lot of people go into into try and change a business and they'll say hey stop doing this
[00:38:36] SPEAKER_00: when often it's better just to tell people to start doing this if you give the people a choice
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_00: between what doesn't work and what works I'll typically choose what works because it makes their
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_00: life easier so you know that's that's kind of our mindset we've done 90 of these all or part
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_00: deals and built 35 partnerships and it's been you know I've been running for 20 years so we've got
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_00: some sense of what works the other thing I wanted to ask you is how do you make people commit for
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_01: 10 years and how do you make them want to commit because I bet you're not forcing them right so
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: yeah what's the secret sauce
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_01: well the question is what is a logic of committing for less than 10 years you know there's no evidence
[00:39:31] SPEAKER_00: that that committing for less than 10 years makes sense and so I think I think often
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_00: you know people will come to me and I also would you want to be an equity partner and I'll say yes
[00:39:54] and I'll say well would you like to make a long term commitment and they say yes so then it's
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_00: just a question of agreeing what that long term commitment is now David are you married?
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_00: No I'm 19 so if you get married your wife probably will want a long term commitment and that's
[00:40:16] because rather than her just being arbitrary and crazy and saying well I want a long term commitment
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_00: and certainly on the day you get married that'll be defined as forever death to us part the
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_00: reason she'll ask for that is because if you're going to have children those children last forever
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_00: so she's trying to add a structure to the to the business of raising children
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_00: knowing that raising children takes forever so she needs a structure as do you that will be
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_00: there forever to raise those children so it's not that she being unreasonable in demanding this
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_00: forever commitment because you know at least on the day she gets married she understands that those
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_00: children need a structure where they can thrive forever and they know that within a committed
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_00: family situation that that's the best situation for them now when Charlie Munger died Warren Buffett
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_00: wrote the best piece of business writing I've ever read it was a one-page tribute to Charlie
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_00: where he described him as the architect of Berkshire Hathaway and said that without Charlie Berkshire
[00:41:23] wouldn't have been Berkshire and so what's interesting is he said you know he says that without this
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_00: structure that the companion wouldn't have wouldn't have been able to happen it would have been a
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_00: little cigar-bite operation and so what I would say to you is all we did was say to people well
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_00: if you're going to look after these clients keep their accountants for 30 plus years so they want
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_00: partners that they know we're going to be there for 30 years so I ironically the best you know
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_00: agreement would be a 30-year agreement but in the absence of being able to get 30 McDonald's have a 20-year
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_00: license agreement KFC have a 10-year license agreement so I went for 10 now the other rationale is that
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_00: if we have a part of 10 years we're confident we can make them better off over 10 years we're not
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_00: confident we can make them better off over two years that makes that makes sense yeah but I'm still
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_01: not convinced like at least the people I made most of them are like short-term oriented and so
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_01: like how do you find and track these people that think long-term because you already have to have
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_01: a certain mindset to kind of understand the value in that proposition well it's no different to
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_00: getting married we I simply say to people do you want to get married or do you want to date so some
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_00: people want to be perpetual data is Leonardo DiCaprio you know different women every two years
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_00: other people want to get married then now there there are two types of people most people want to
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_00: get married for the long term so you should be quite confident that in fact most people aren't short-term
[00:43:13] most people are long-term most organizations have become short-term but most people in and of
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_00: themselves are long-term so in making a asking somebody to make a long-term commitment to you remember
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_00: you have to make a long-term commitment to them so most organizations today don't want to
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_00: configure themselves to make long-term commitments and so the world's become more short-term now I
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_00: would argue that a business is better if it's configured operated and thinks about the long-term
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_00: I think there's a lot of evidence that that's the case and so that's like all we think we've done
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_00: is what's rational as you know Warren and Charlie would encourage us to do we just think it's
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_00: irrational but we're short-term yeah I mean I wish everyone think like you I think they do David I
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_00: think most people do think long-term it's just a question of will I think long-term with you
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_00: you know do they think that you can be a good long-term partner yeah but like for example when I
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_01: when I was speaking about investing like most of my friends want to spot the next big thing or the
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_01: next big move that we'll double in like one month or something so how's that long term in your mind
[00:44:41] well I think that the reality is that sex sells and most people want to do the sexy thing but if you
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_00: think about the de-psychological drivers of people most people want to be part of a community
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_00: and they would value their community over short-term amusement and so
[00:45:14] even if that person says to you well I'd like to find this stock that doubles I think you could
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_00: probably win the argument if you said to them look if you put $10,000 into Berkshire today and
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_00: it compounds at 10% for the next 30 years you'll definitely be in this position if you find the one
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_00: that doubles you know that's good too maybe you want to put 80% of your money into Berkshire and 20%
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_00: you know if you're tied into running around looking for these little double doubles and if you do
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_00: that what you typically find is somebody says oh no no I just want to find my double doubles but
[00:45:53] SPEAKER_00: you know give them five years and I'll be sick of that typically and I'll be more interested in a
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_00: sustainable way to compound their capital as in I think it's a say with young men you know 19 maybe
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_00: a one a day to different girl every six months but I think at some point you might find one decent
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_00: enough to think was you know why am I why am I flipping my stock every six months when this girl
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_00: is a great girl like what am I doing so so to me life and business are very similar long term
[00:46:23] investing just makes more sense because it allows you to live your life because you know ironically
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_00: your life isn't meant to be spent just chasing the next girl or the next little stock idea that can
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_00: potentially double in the next three seconds hopefully making the money is going to deliver you
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_00: some freedom to do to do other things that are even better for the world on what you're doing at the
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_00: moment yeah I love how you mix like business and life because at the end of the day they are the
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_01: same thing right like just what you said and yeah I find that just fascinating yeah I believe that
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_00: I think you can learn from I think Warren Buffett has been so revered because most of his business
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_00: lessons a life lessons yeah yeah that's true for sure I think I learned more about like
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_01: leaving my life from Warren than I learned like about investing maybe I think that's true like I think
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_00: that's why he said review you know yeah yeah that's why I have him right here so he's always looking
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm saying what I have him just I should make it up or even the sky yeah yeah okay so circling
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_01: back to the systems just to wrap up that topic what which two or three systems would you
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_01: strip down that fully kind of enabled or enable your scale because you're not just being successful
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_01: at a micro level at these businesses but you're also like doing something that's extremely scalable
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_01: right so yeah maybe you could expand on that so a permanent capital structure is very important
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_00: so clarity around mission values vision capture that in a clear strategy so private business
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_00: owning clients in the opcos and private business owning accounting firms you know up to 10 million
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_00: in the you know for acquisition of a partnership so that focus I think is important and then how to
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_00: make those partnerships how to attract and retain and develop or attract development retain good
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_00: people really good people I think of the the big pieces how to lead with some inspiration and
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_00: enthusiasm is critically important it's free and often certainly now industry not not done with any
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_00: with any gusto I think it's really important that you lead with with energy and and enthusiasm and
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_00: encouragement for people find inspire people to be the best they can be that doesn't cost anything so
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_00: kind of a free kick so may they're the dead big things that might be different
[00:49:27] I think that's actually interesting because uh Berkshire is calling does like the ultimate
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_01: educational organization right and I think kpg is very similar to that because you have your
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_01: own podcast you try to kind of share the wisdom and attend of the day you're also kind of
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_01: teaching your own people to think or have the right systems and tools to to succeed or like
[00:49:56] get closer to the mission as you like to to call it so how do you build an environment
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_01: that is good for learning and and spreading these principles well you become you know you your own life
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_00: is either a good example or a warning and your people are going to do what you do more than what
[00:50:25] SPEAKER_00: you say and so if you want other people to be learners be a learner if you want other people to be
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_00: energetic be energetic if you want other people to be enthusiastic you need to be enthusiastic there's
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_00: no way of getting around the leadership you know the requirements to lead from the front and and
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_00: deliver at a personal level yourself that's that's the bottom line yeah I think that's perfect
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_01: the buck stocks here right like if you don't if you don't lead it you can't ask anyone to do what
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_00: you're not prepared to do yourself and you certainly can't ask them to be something you're not
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_00: prepared to be yourself so your kids end up like you and your employees end up like you so you have
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_00: to focus on you know if you want to change the world you have to change yourself yeah I think that's
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_01: so powerful and sometimes we're we're extremely focused on like okay let's change our external
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_01: environment when everything we have to do is change our own perspective and mindset and
[00:51:33] SPEAKER_01: yeah change your mindset change your own ideas change your own routine get yourself more organized
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_00: have more energy more enthusiasm everything that you do and become I always say life's an inside
[00:51:47] SPEAKER_00: out job so what you work on inside you will ultimately come out of you so work on your inside
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_00: your inside game and it will turn up as the outside game it's like sport you know
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_00: what you do on game days a function of what you did in training so life is the same and you know
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_00: and business is life when you turn up and I'm looking at you as Mr. Businessperson they're looking
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_00: at you as a person and they can feel how you are they can feel your resonance and so you've got
[00:52:19] SPEAKER_00: to do the work on on yourself so you can turn up in the right way yeah I think that's that's
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_01: very funny and true at the same time that's the painful reality everyone spends a lot of time
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_00: reading books or reading part listening podcast hoping that there's some easier way but everyone
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_00: that I've ever met that's being good at you know achieving their own goals and making a difference
[00:52:46] SPEAKER_00: that it starts with them what did you learn from people that approach achieving goals and missions
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_01: the wrong way so I think we have these three values people for others
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_00: keep your promises and play as part of a team the opposite of that is a person for themselves
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_00: it doesn't keep their promises it's an individual so I just have a very clear I want to be like this
[00:53:18] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to be like that I think that Jim Collins is again written a book called How the
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_00: Mighty Fall I think the lessons are pretty clear you know staying aggressively humble meaning not
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_00: meaning sort of pious or pie in the sky niceness but just you know for me it's easy I'm like well
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_00: CaliPartners is pretty good and Apple's amazing so let's you know CaliPartners pretty good
[00:53:48] SPEAKER_00: but share how the way is amazing at CaliPartners pretty good McDonald's Wild Warts incredible so
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_00: always trying to look up I have this saying that life is always better when you're looking up because
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_00: firstly you're more likely to get a better perspective and secondly you're not going to be looking
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_00: down on other people so you know if you're always looking up to people and organizations and got
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_00: himself to inspire you then you won't get ahead of yourself and think that you know you are
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_00: the alpha and the amiga the answer to all of the questions
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_00: yeah I think that's a very interesting way to frame it because usually people
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_01: when I asked them about humility and I think I did ask you about humility in the past if you scroll
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_01: back on the messages and usually people are just like think more about others or but I think
[00:54:53] SPEAKER_01: that's a very practical kind of framework to to think about humility like if you're constantly
[00:54:59] SPEAKER_01: looking up and looking at what others are doing better than you and what you can improve you don't
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_01: have the time to to get like I'm a compliment yeah I'm a compliment I think that you can't get
[00:55:15] SPEAKER_00: down on yourself or life if you're looking up you know if you're working down you feel down
[00:55:22] SPEAKER_00: but if you're looking up you'll always feel better than if you're looking down
[00:55:28] secondly as you say if you're looking up and you always acknowledge this always somebody with a
[00:55:33] SPEAKER_00: bigger boat there's always somebody who's better than you who's faster than you is doing
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_00: better business the better this the better that then you can you know you've got us you've got to
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_00: have heroes but if it talks about show me heroes and I'll tell you who you are you just have to have
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_00: a perspective bigger than yourself and so then you don't have to say well you know I'd become
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_00: really humble David because that's obviously bullshit but what you can do is maintain a sense of
[00:56:02] SPEAKER_00: perspective you know if I've if I've ever had real drama with a person or seeing people have
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_00: real drama it's where you've got a person who doesn't really see where they fit you know and
[00:56:16] SPEAKER_00: and they're really good they're up to here but they think they're Michael Jordan right and they're
[00:56:21] SPEAKER_00: not and that and then that gap makes them insecure and it makes them crazy whereas if they were just
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_00: honest with themselves and said you know I'm I'm really good I'm here but Michael Jordan's here
[00:56:36] you know that young guy while some years ago who called out Jordan and said I yeah I could take
[00:56:41] SPEAKER_00: Jordan in a one-on-one and John said I yeah any time I'll see how that goes other than he
[00:56:46] SPEAKER_00: that's what I'm talking about so you need to keep some perspective and the best way to do that is by
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_00: looking up you know if whether anyone accepts God is real or not everyone can accept that the idea
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_00: that there that there is this idea of an omnipotent perfect being that isn't you is a really good
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_00: psychological construction right where you can say okay there's that there's this amazing
[00:57:14] person who's not you or me I think that's helpful I think it's tremendously helpful psychologically
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_00: if if for not if for no other reason you said I was thinking about someone that has like bigger
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_01: boat or like I know you you mean that metaphorically not in the actual sense but how do you also
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_01: like make sure that you're not like running on a treadmill of okay let's let's achieve more let's
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_01: achieve more just for the sake of it then because you're looking at other people.
[00:57:48] Timeline I think the hedonic treadmill is real and I think that everyone is subject to it to a degree
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_00: I have this concept of sort of you know one car one house one watch one wife I'm failing with
[00:58:09] SPEAKER_00: Medicare's issues but you know trying to keep us close to that rule of one where you don't you
[00:58:19] SPEAKER_00: know you just don't do so much unfocused stuff the Benedictine said that at first you possess
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_00: your possessions and then they possess you I think is a great saying so you know you don't you
[00:58:37] SPEAKER_00: don't want to be doing things for the sake of it that gets back to renewing the mission idea of
[00:58:43] SPEAKER_00: why you're doing it and trying to keep that for front of your mind that's difficult for everyone
[00:58:48] SPEAKER_00: you're busy you're your your subject of pressures so there's no perfect way to do that but awareness is
[00:58:56] SPEAKER_00: almost the beginning of wisdom right and knowing that you're trying to get wise is more likely to
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_00: help you get wise and forgetting that it isn't easy
[00:59:08] I think that's that's very interesting so going back to business I wanted to ask you a few more
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_01: questions on that how do you filter what to buy and what to walk away from yeah so what to buy and
[00:59:26] SPEAKER_00: walk away from is firstly filtered on values you know wherever we have trouble or have ever had
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_00: trouble it's where there's a values disillignment so they're not they don't share our three core values
[00:59:39] SPEAKER_00: and they don't share a 20-year view long term so if there's any clash of values or time frame you're
[00:59:45] SPEAKER_00: going to have problems okay then obviously you should be able to you should be able to believe you
[00:59:50] SPEAKER_00: know agree on vision you should be able to agree on on the on the on the um
[00:59:59] um um
[01:00:04] um
[01:00:07] you should be able to agree on the strategy and the structure so really
[01:00:13] SPEAKER_00: your place of friction will be around values and time frame if you can get that right and you
[01:00:20] SPEAKER_00: can virtually the values bit harder but the rest you can contract you should be okay
[01:00:26] SPEAKER_00: but that doesn't mean we've got it right all the time you know we we have situations from time
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_00: to time where we really do have a values clash and a time frame clash and that makes it hard to
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_00: to help everyone be happy um because David if I'm like well look I know you've got a bit of a
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_00: problem today but don't worry we've got 10 years we'll work it out I'm relaxed if you need to
[01:00:47] SPEAKER_00: work it out today you're less relaxed so you know the assumption around time frame is critical
[01:00:53] SPEAKER_00: and what do you do when you get confronted with mistakes okay I've done a mistake and now
[01:00:59] SPEAKER_01: what do I do about it when buying a company I mean just to acknowledge it upfront
[01:01:05] SPEAKER_00: it's done as possible and then try and work through how to fix it do you ever sell
[01:01:11] I'm traditionally know that doesn't mean that we wouldn't you know with the size of the group
[01:01:18] SPEAKER_00: today be more prepared to sell something where there was an intractable issue than keep it and
[01:01:22] SPEAKER_00: live with it you know the pain of the bad behaviour or the values mismatch or whatever else is going on
[01:01:29] SPEAKER_00: but you know today we've been blessed we haven't had that situation but you know I worry I'm
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_00: up and I'm sold as well if if I think I've heard him quoted that the only reason he would sell
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_00: was sort of if there was a values issue yeah right the value issue yeah that's that's an interesting
[01:01:49] SPEAKER_01: uh fluid words and how do you integrate companies without breaking them because I think that's
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_01: one of their your key strengths yeah I think there's you know firms are like bamboo you can you
[01:02:02] SPEAKER_00: can bend them and stretch them but you can also crack them so you've got to be careful
[01:02:08] SPEAKER_00: it's not easy to assess capacity to change sometimes there's external situations of mean the firm
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_00: has to change very quickly and everyone knows that and that frankly makes it easier
[01:02:18] SPEAKER_00: um if you run into a leadership that doesn't want to change even though they're contracted to change
[01:02:23] SPEAKER_00: that makes it harder we've had that a few times that's okay um you've got to build people's
[01:02:30] SPEAKER_00: confidence that you know what you're talking about you've got to keep your word and you have to have
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_00: a huge energy and then people typically get on board because they can get enthused
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_00: enthused about the difference it makes for them we're not making the change for us we're making
[01:02:45] SPEAKER_00: the change to make up people better off and it applies to communities better off
[01:02:50] yeah I think that's that's again like the flywheel right uh that's that's so embedded in your
[01:02:56] SPEAKER_01: organization um you you just take like these concepts really seriously and that reminds me of
[01:03:04] SPEAKER_01: the first page of poor Charlie's Almanag that I have here that take a simple idea and take it
[01:03:09] SPEAKER_01: seriously yeah and so yeah I think you're the ultimate uh yeah I don't know a flyer of that that idea
[01:03:19] SPEAKER_01: so um yeah it's um you know a friend of mine when I started I said to him all what's the difference
[01:03:29] SPEAKER_00: between any you know he'd been a very very senior guy I said what's the difference between a
[01:03:35] SPEAKER_00: million dollar deal and a billion dollar deal he said if you do enough million dollar deals properly
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_00: you get to do billion dollar deals so we've always taken a million dollar deal as if it's a billion
[01:03:44] SPEAKER_00: dollar deal we take it very you know we have this saying David where we say you know we don't take
[01:03:51] SPEAKER_00: ourselves seriously but we take the work very seriously um so you know we we have taken out our one
[01:03:59] SPEAKER_00: big idea um very seriously don't people tell me I think myself too seriously and so I
[01:04:10] SPEAKER_01: thinking deeply about what you just said which is how can I take my work and because I do care a
[01:04:18] SPEAKER_01: lot about what I do or like uh my studies or my relationships uh without taking my self seriously
[01:04:26] yeah I think you can consciously work on your sense of humor um just like you can work on anything
[01:04:33] SPEAKER_00: else you know my I I'm very seriously oriented as a person uh so for me everything's the Olympics
[01:04:42] SPEAKER_00: not to compete against anyone else but to compete against myself to really drive myself to do
[01:04:47] SPEAKER_00: things properly in my mind to do them the very best I can in a world class way but that can get
[01:04:53] SPEAKER_00: in the way of just having fun but I'm fun loving by nature so reminding yourself and creating time
[01:05:00] SPEAKER_00: where you know it's not all business I don't work Sundays so you know Saturday nights Sundays
[01:05:06] SPEAKER_00: I'm I'm free to be fun and funny and and I'm always looking for a joke you you know all the times
[01:05:12] SPEAKER_00: during business hours or whatever to try and keep things light you know life's hard enough without
[01:05:18] SPEAKER_00: laughing so laughter really makes teams better it makes the business better it makes everyone happier
[01:05:24] SPEAKER_00: so I think you know so a lot of a lot of what you'll hear me speak about I try to say it in a
[01:05:31] SPEAKER_00: lighthearted way I try to find you know ways of explaining things that are funny and fun sometimes
[01:05:37] SPEAKER_00: a little rude as it turns out people find it offensive um but I'd rather be funny and a bit of
[01:05:43] SPEAKER_00: offensive than then then sort of antiseptic and clinical um you know a funny turn of phrase
[01:05:54] SPEAKER_00: um will help people you know remember and it's a good way to wait a while just conscious of the
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_00: time but you know David I always share this story and and on this note you know I say to people say
[01:06:05] SPEAKER_00: things in ways that people remember you know your life is either a spa bath or a chocolate cake
[01:06:11] SPEAKER_00: Bill Clinton sort of had the chocolate cake idea you chop your life up into certain pieces you know
[01:06:16] SPEAKER_00: you're a president good president at work and you know you know and have a girlfriend on the side
[01:06:22] SPEAKER_00: and then you got a wife and you got kids you chop it all up and and you're hope that those
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_00: pieces of chocolate cake never touch each other um because otherwise that's a problem or your
[01:06:32] SPEAKER_00: life's a spa bath you know it's your spa bath you get to invite who gets to sit in there with you
[01:06:36] SPEAKER_00: and have great time and and um enjoy the warm water and the views um but you know that great movie
[01:06:43] SPEAKER_00: catty shack always get a laugh you know if anyone catty shack's just barba the good people will jump out
[01:06:49] SPEAKER_00: and the people that will stain this barba after the people that are used to sitting and shit and enjoy it
[01:06:53] SPEAKER_00: and then you're basically surrounded by shit people who are you know shit it's so that's the way
[01:07:00] SPEAKER_00: to try to explain things to get a bit of a laugh for people to go oh that's a bit rude and it's like
[01:07:04] SPEAKER_00: well it's funny but it's kind of serious you know if if you treat people badly they jump out
[01:07:09] SPEAKER_00: you'll have to empty this barbath clean it out get back in you'll say to the good people hey do
[01:07:14] SPEAKER_00: you want to get back in I go no I'm not doing that it happened once it could happen twice and you
[01:07:18] SPEAKER_00: didn't take it seriously so your life is is the only life you have you should be intentional about
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_00: you know who you bring into your circle and the basis upon which you know you you're you're sort of
[01:07:29] SPEAKER_00: allowed them to stay there and they owe you their best contribution and behavior and sense of
[01:07:34] SPEAKER_00: humor and you owe them theirs doesn't mean you can't be forgiving but you want to be conscious and
[01:07:39] SPEAKER_00: and intentional about who you're spending your time with and and you know I always say that if you
[01:07:44] SPEAKER_00: get the person right you get the professional right so you've got to concentrate on yourself and
[01:07:49] SPEAKER_00: in your own development character knowing that that's the thing that's going to make the most
[01:07:54] SPEAKER_00: difference I want to ask you a very deep question and yeah just curious to know how you answer that
[01:08:06] SPEAKER_01: but are you happy I don't aim for happiness so I think you know I it's a great question so
[01:08:17] am I happy well from time to time I think during the day I'm very ecstatic about life but
[01:08:24] SPEAKER_00: I think your life is meant to be invested for the benefit of others and to the degree that you're
[01:08:33] SPEAKER_00: serving others I think there's a deep sense of meaning in that and I think that's what leads to
[01:08:38] SPEAKER_00: what people describe as happiness I think there's a deep sense of fulfillment in living your mission
[01:08:44] SPEAKER_00: with a commitment and integrity and and I would I certainly tell you that that might also be what
[01:08:52] SPEAKER_00: you know the feeling that people get but might be what they call happiness I'm more of a rationalist
[01:08:59] SPEAKER_00: that if I can see that I put myself where I'm meant to be that I'm doing the things that I'm
[01:09:03] SPEAKER_00: meant to do and I'm doing them with high energy and integrity really trying to make others better off
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_00: then there's this sort of flywheel of personal satisfaction that generates meaning and I think
[01:09:15] SPEAKER_00: that's probably what people call happiness I'm going for holiness rather than happiness but not in
[01:09:21] SPEAKER_00: a religious sense call it wholeness can I you know live in accordance with my own values and
[01:09:30] SPEAKER_00: with the mission that I feel that I'm meant to live out each day I think that that approach is
[01:09:37] SPEAKER_00: much more likely to lead to to what other people describe as happiness at best happiness is a feeling
[01:09:46] SPEAKER_00: and life to me isn't about your own feelings life is difficult it's a challenge at its best if
[01:09:52] SPEAKER_00: you're doing what you're meant to be doing life is difficult it's challenging you know you've got to
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_00: put in real effort but to me you know a great workout makes me feel great a lot of people like
[01:10:03] SPEAKER_00: isn't that really hard and it's like yeah it's hard when you're doing it but you know the
[01:10:08] SPEAKER_00: satisfaction is very meaningful to me so that's you know that's what I'm all about I really like
[01:10:17] that because usually everyone assumes everyone's optimizing for the same thing which is happiness
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_01: and the fake assumption the outside is talks about pre-modern values and no pre-modernists were
