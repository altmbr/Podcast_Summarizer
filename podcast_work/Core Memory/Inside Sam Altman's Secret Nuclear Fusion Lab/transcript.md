[00:00:00] Ashley, what are we doing?
[00:00:03] Whenever Washington going to Helion, which is a fusion startup, I don't think they really let many people in to see what they're doing.
[00:00:15] I guess we almost died.
[00:00:19] Ashley Vance: Yes, we almost died.
[00:00:23] Ashley Vance is right. Helion hasn't let any filthy journalists like me see its most prize machines before.
[00:00:31] Ashley Vance: But here we are, poking around and taking pictures of exotic-looking things.
[00:00:37] The story on Helion is this. It has raised a ton of money to make nuclear fusion real.
[00:00:44] It's pronounced nuclear.
[00:00:47] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): We're talking clean, plentiful energy. We're also talking tons of skepticism, not just around fusion,
[00:00:54] Ashley Vance: but around Helion itself. The company is weird, secretive, and beyond ambitious,
[00:01:01] which is exactly what we like.
[00:01:05] Welcome to Helion. Yeah, thanks. This place is freaking crazy. Thank you very much.
[00:01:11] Ashley Vance: That's Helion CEO and co-founder David Kirtley. And some people think he's quite mad.
[00:01:17] Ashley Vance: Some people call fusion the holy grail. I hate that. Because the holy grail is a thing that no one ever finds.
[00:01:24] He started Helion way back in 2013. And it's now part of a new way of fusion startups that want to prove that the technology,
[00:01:33] Ashley Vance: after many, many decades of hope and hype, can work.
[00:01:38] The last time I was at a fusion place, it was in Russia.
[00:01:46] I think it's like going back to the 50s and 60s them doing research on this inside.
[00:01:55] There were only like five guys working in there. I think it was far from the glory days of what was
[00:02:00] Unknown Guest: happening in that building. That's funny. You're going to see actually some interesting similarities.
[00:02:05] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): Helion has been backed by more than $1 billion from Sam Altman and others. And it's seen
[00:02:11] Ashley Vance: as sort of the bad boy of the field.
[00:02:21] Over here are some of our earlier machines where we showed a really small scale that you could
[00:02:26] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): do fusion. And we call this one Grande. This one set world records for fusion temperatures.
[00:02:31] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): That set the stage for Venti. We used to name them after Starbucks.
[00:02:36] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): Yeah. Much higher compression fields. Now it was designed to really squeeze on the fusion plasma.
[00:02:42] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): And so then we moved to Trenta. You can actually look down the bor of Trenta, or if we did our job,
[00:02:47] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): two plasmas meet at about 10 million degrees.
[00:02:52] Most of the startups here are trying to use fusion to produce heat, which is then used to produce
[00:02:58] Ashley Vance: steam that spins a turbine to make energy. Helion by contrast doesn't want to produce steam at all.
[00:03:04] Ashley Vance: It's trying to capture energy straight from the fusion reaction. Helion uses extreme heat to help
[00:03:11] Ashley Vance: atoms fuse together, then surrounds the resulting charged particles with magnetic fields.
[00:03:17] Ashley Vance: When those particles push back against the magnetic fields, Helion turns that push directly into
[00:03:24] Ashley Vance: electricity, or at least that's what it wants to do. Over the years, Helion has been doing one
[00:03:30] Ashley Vance: experiment after another to prove first that it can achieve fusion, and then that it can control
[00:03:37] Ashley Vance: these magnetic fields and harness their energy. Along the way, it's been building ever bigger fusion
[00:03:44] Ashley Vance: systems. You take those atoms and you want to overcome their atomic forces. Then for me, the
[00:03:49] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): really interesting thing happens. They're forming heavier elements that are now really hot. They're
[00:03:53] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): going from hydrogens to helium's, pushing back on that magnetic field. It's expanding and taking
[00:03:59] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): all that energy we can directly recover it at high efficiency. The electrical current flows in
[00:04:03] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): through here, goes through one of these electromagnets and then back out. And as you go down the machine,
[00:04:08] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): you increase in the pressure that you're compressing the number of cables increases too as you go.
[00:04:14] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): Oh, and here's a little treat for you people with cable fetishes.
[00:04:28] Helion's latest and greatest machine is called Polaris, and it's being made inside of a building
[00:04:34] Ashley Vance: called Ersa, and we'll get to both of them in a minute. But first, let's do some fusion 101.
[00:04:44] Energy per fusion. The most great challenge for the man to be never faced.
[00:04:50] Unknown Guest: To perform fusion, you want to take a couple of atoms, like say, hydrogen and bash them together.
[00:04:56] Ashley Vance: If you do this, you get helium. And a bunch of energy as a result. The trick is that you need extreme
[00:05:03] Ashley Vance: heat to get the hydrogen atoms to fuse. We're talking 100 million degrees Celsius,
[00:05:09] Ashley Vance: and you need a way to capture the resulting energy. All of this is very, very hard.
[00:05:15] Ashley Vance: Fusion has been the holy grail of energy for a long time. Sorry, David.
[00:05:26] It's clean, it's super safe, and the reactors can be much smaller than the
[00:05:31] Ashley Vance: fission reactors that we use today. The major problem so far has been that fusion reactors consume
[00:05:38] Ashley Vance: more energy than they produce. The new wave of startups are betting that they have finally figured
[00:05:44] Ashley Vance: this major problem out. This show that we can do 100 million degrees showed that we understood
[00:05:50] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): the physics of how to heat these fusion plasmas, these fuels to thermonuclear conditions.
[00:05:55] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): Plasma pushes back, and we can get electricity out of that, and that paved the way for players.
[00:06:00] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): Helion has already proven that it can do fusion. With Trenta, it's also proven that it can
[00:06:05] Ashley Vance: recover electricity from its fusion reaction. The next step is showing that it can make more
[00:06:12] Ashley Vance: electricity than it consumes, which brings us back to Polaris. So what you're doing here is what we
[00:06:19] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): call lock out tag out, and so inside this box is a key that controls the power supplies that run
[00:06:26] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): all of this. Okay, and so that key that is now locked, and we put the key in the box.
[00:06:31] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): Do they have to do this? Everyone here has to do it. Now, completed a lock out tag out,
[00:06:36] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): these systems cannot be energized while we're in here. So you're in Ursa, this is actually the
[00:06:40] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): power supplies that run Polaris. This capacitor bank in units is over 60 mega jewels of electrical
[00:06:47] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): energy. This is the largest magnetic pulse power bank on the planet right now. The Helion
[00:06:52] Ashley Vance: skeptics out there doubt that any of this will work. They complain that the company doesn't publish
[00:06:57] Ashley Vance: any of its research, that its techniques remain science fiction, and that there's just no way
[00:07:03] Ashley Vance: this thing makes extra electricity. There's one story, it was kind of giving you guys grief,
[00:07:08] Unknown Guest: giving you some shit for the machinists, the builders, versus like the PhD types, and they were
[00:07:15] Unknown Guest: sort of saying you're low on PhD types. Having scientists that understand fusion physics,
[00:07:21] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): but the best scientists in the world is really, really important, same with the high-voltage
[00:07:25] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): electrical engineers that designed this. But at the end of the day, what we found is to be able to
[00:07:29] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): do science quickly, to be able to learn fast, iterate, to learn about the natural waters fast as
[00:07:36] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): you can. It all comes down to the building. And to try and prove the doubters wrong, David let
[00:07:40] Ashley Vance: me into Polaris. He just wouldn't let you in. They have to stop here? Yes, all right. Thank you.
[00:07:49] Unknown Guest: Bye guys. What I saw was genuinely breathtaking. I could not bear the thought of you missing out on
[00:07:57] Ashley Vance: something so out of this world. And so we found a comic book artist to illustrate what I saw.
[00:08:04] And they have to stop here? Yes. All right. Thank you. Bye guys.
[00:08:10] K-Man, are you doing audio on this? Okay, good. Holy cow. We are orders of magnitude smaller than
[00:08:18] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): everybody else in fusion. And it's still enormous. Super sized. Yep. Yep. And so we'll go up and I'll
[00:08:24] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): show you from above. Oh my god. So we'll come up here. Holy shit. You saw the cables. And the
[00:08:32] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): cables go through the wall and then the cables go and plug into the machine. Holy shit. That was a lot of
[00:08:36] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): cable. Come on. We do buy them by the team loves to joke the mega meter, but a thousand kilometers at a
[00:08:46] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): time. This is Polaris. This is how I want a fusion machine to look at my dreams. This is it. This is
[00:08:57] Unknown Guest: like exactly the way it should be. And then when we fire this it glows that bright fuchsia
[00:09:02] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): pink color. No. Yeah. As we super heat the hydrogen and the helium, it emits this really bright
[00:09:09] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): pink glow. Is there a fuel injector? We pop it in. Just like honestly the fuel injection on a
[00:09:14] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): rocket engine. Very similar. We then ionize it here and then accelerating down to the middle
[00:09:20] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): through all of these individual cables. The energy in one thousandth second goes in and comes
[00:09:24] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): right back. Recharges those capacitors. And when you do that now it's sitting on that capacitor
[00:09:29] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): ready to go again. And so you just fire it again. Bang. It goes back in. Bang. It goes back in.
[00:09:35] This is insane. It's too fast for a normal camera to catch the plasma accelerating a million
[00:09:42] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): miles an hour down the ends but the high speed cameras can. And it's just that gradual process of
[00:09:48] Unknown Guest: just doing more and more tests. And every day you add a system you upgrade you go to higher power
[00:09:55] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): honestly some days you break things. That's crazy. Thank you guys for letting me see this.
[00:10:01] Ashley Vance: It's awesome. When will the world get to see that? I don't have an answer for that. I don't
[00:10:09] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): have an answer for that. Okay. Okay. Why I got to so fuck you guys. I am not totally sure why
[00:10:19] Ashley Vance: helium won't show this to the public. They haven't talked about intellectual property concerns
[00:10:25] Ashley Vance: and I guess China is always watching. All I can tell you is that it looked very real to me.
[00:10:32] Ashley Vance: Let's not do the same techniques with steam turbines of the past where you're trying to generate fusion
[00:10:38] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): energy to make heat to boil water to run a steam turbine but in fact to directly recover
[00:10:43] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): electricity. So we focus on an approach to fusion, this pulse magnetic approach where we can
[00:10:47] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): recover electricity from the whole fusion system and from the fusion reaction. In some of the
[00:10:53] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): electromagnetic coils they're really efficient. 94% efficiency in some parts of the machine. And so
[00:10:58] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): that's radically different than other fusion approaches where they might do fusion but recover no
[00:11:03] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): electricity. And so we have to make up all those losses. And so what Polaris is designed to do is
[00:11:07] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): do fusion make energy from that fusion and recover that electricity back out onto the capacitor.
[00:11:14] Polaris was once meant to be pumping out electricity in 2024 which means that helium is running
[00:11:20] Ashley Vance: a bit behind schedule. David also won't say yet if the machine makes more energy than it consumes.
[00:11:26] Ashley Vance: None of this though has stopped helium from starting work on its next machine.
[00:11:31] This is called Orion and it's under construction in nearby Malaga, Washington.
[00:11:36] Ashley Vance: Helian says Orion will be up and running in 2028 and Microsoft has signed on to be the first customer.
[00:11:45] I mean if this works what do the next like 20, 30, 50 years look like?
[00:11:50] Ashley Vance: Our goal is to build manufacturing gigafactories that are producing fusion generators. So rolling
[00:11:57] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): off the line every day is another generator so we can go deploy it. We can meet the needs
[00:12:02] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): of power systems of AI centers. We can then go and build and replace fossil fuels and actually
[00:12:08] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): really target climate change. There's whole continents that don't have firm power.
[00:12:14] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): As long as you have base load always on clean power that's what fusion can be.
[00:12:18] Unknown Host (Possibly Helion Team Member): Do I remain a fusion skeptic? Yes, you sort of have to be until one of these startups actually
[00:12:25] Ashley Vance: delivers the goods. Do I think David is a madman? Well also yes but in a good way.
[00:12:32] Ashley Vance: He has a theory. He's building very real things to test it and he comes off as a man possessed.
[00:12:39] Ashley Vance: These seem like the basic qualities required to perhaps finally make fusion real.
[00:12:46] The scientists in the village are trying to find the point of impact where the machine produces so much energy
[00:12:52] Unknown Guest: as it consumes. Oh and one more thing make your finances go nuclear in a good way with Brex.
