[00:00:00] **Sarah Guo:** Today, I'm joined by Zach Lloyd, the co-founder and CEO of Warp, a terminal product and AI
[00:00:12] tool for developers that allows you to do different sorts of coding applications.
[00:00:16] Prior to Warp, Zach was at Google and he also started another company called Selfmade.
[00:00:22] We talk about AI DevTooling, but we also end up talking about human consciousness and
[00:00:26] how can you tell if an AI is actually sentient.
[00:00:29] Zach, welcome to No Pires.
[00:00:30] **Zach Lloyd:** I'm excited to be here.
[00:00:31] Thanks for having me.
[00:00:32] **Sarah Guo:** So you have a master's degree in the philosophy of science, and if you're going to take
[00:00:35] a very different lens and abstract out of the coding world, then all the things that
[00:00:39] we tend to think about every day, how do you think about this societally in terms of
[00:00:43] a big wave of AI that's hitting us right now?
[00:00:45] And where do you think some of these really big societal impacts will be?
[00:00:49] **Zach Lloyd:** The way I think about the advances or it's kind of like we are distilling intelligence,
[00:00:55] and so there are, I think people who consider what's happening, they're like, are we
[00:01:02] recreating people in some way, are we recreating consciousness?
[00:01:06] But it's not that.
[00:01:07] It's actually what's fascinating to me is how much intelligence you can get out of just
[00:01:12] like next token prediction, and what does that say about the way that our minds work?
[00:01:20] Something I'm always thinking about is like, is this how our brains are working?
[00:01:23] Are we doing next token prediction?
[00:01:26] And I don't think so.
[00:01:27] Like I think that there's going to be some further AI unlock.
[00:01:32] There's actually a book about this that I think is really interesting called Blind
[00:01:35] Site.
[00:01:36] The sci-fi book where they separate consciousness from intelligence, and basically humanity
[00:01:40] meets a space-faring civilization, or civilization is overseating it, a space-faring
[00:01:46] intelligent being that's not conscious.
[00:01:50] And what are the implications of that, and how do you think about that, and how do you
[00:01:52] communicate with that?
[00:01:53] **Sarah Guo:** Are you basically saying that that's kind of your view of AI right now?
[00:01:55] **Zach Lloyd:** I think that's what it is at the moment.
[00:01:57] It's like we've distilled intelligence, or something that like from like an instrumentalist
[00:02:04] or like functional perspective is able to do things that we recognize as intelligence,
[00:02:08] but it's totally mechanistic.
[00:02:09] I don't think anyone who's looking at this thinks that there's any aspect of consciousness
[00:02:14] to it.
[00:02:15] I think that's like a very confusing thing for people.
[00:02:20] Yeah.
[00:02:21] **Sarah Guo:** There's a classical test for this, what was known as the Turing test, right?
[00:02:24] **Zach Lloyd:** Totally.
[00:02:25] **Sarah Guo:** And so the idea there is, if you can't tell the difference between interacting with a computer
[00:02:29] in a person, then that computer effectively has met the intelligence bar of a person.
[00:02:34] But in our interactions with this type of AI, we're having very, in some cases, it feels
[00:02:37] like very deep conversations, we're asking about relationships, we're asking about
[00:02:41] all sorts of aspects of our lives, and it's giving very cogent answers, right?
[00:02:44] **Zach Lloyd:** Totally.
[00:02:45] **Sarah Guo:** Make a lot of sense.
[00:02:46] Yeah.
[00:02:47] The question of, again, consciousness and intelligence, is that how you interpret it?
[00:02:53] **Zach Lloyd:** That is how I interpret it.
[00:02:55] And the Turing test is passed.
[00:02:57] It's what's crazy to me is like, we just passed it and no one seemed to care.
[00:03:00] **Sarah Guo:** So what do you think is a nice test or what is the right test?
[00:03:03] Like how do we actually test for consciousness?
[00:03:04] **Zach Lloyd:** For consciousness?
[00:03:05] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:03:06] **Zach Lloyd:** God.
[00:03:07] I don't have a good, I mean, that's a super deep philosophical question that I don't
[00:03:12] have a really good answer for.
[00:03:13] **Sarah Guo:** I mean, it should be mechanistic, right?
[00:03:15] The Turing test was very mechanistic.
[00:03:17] Yeah.
[00:03:18] And I mean, there was other tests we had before, but we would consider super intelligence,
[00:03:21] right?
[00:03:22] And it beat us at chess, then it will be super smart.
[00:03:23] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:03:24] **Sarah Guo:** It beat us at go.
[00:03:25] It can beat us at different things.
[00:03:26] **Zach Lloyd:** Video games, exactly.
[00:03:27] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:03:28] You know, like, we keep coming up with new tests at these things past, and then we keep
[00:03:30] saying, well, it's not conscious.
[00:03:32] **Zach Lloyd:** What would you want to see from something, which is like running a computer program to make
[00:03:38] you believe that it had consciousness?
[00:03:39] Are you looking for certain behavioral characteristics or is the problem that if you really understand
[00:03:45] the mechanism by which it's working, that you will never credit it as being conscious,
[00:03:49] which is crazy.
[00:03:50] Because humans, I mean, at least my belief is that it's also there's a mechanistic thing
[00:03:53] that's happening.
[00:03:54] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah, you're running some form of math in your brain, and it may also just be like matrix
[00:03:58] math and some sort of like series of compounded functions, which is basically all you're doing
[00:04:01] in a neural net, right?
[00:04:02] **Zach Lloyd:** Right.
[00:04:03] **Sarah Guo:** You're just recursively compounding functions.
[00:04:04] **Zach Lloyd:** Totally.
[00:04:05] **Sarah Guo:** So, you know, it's an interesting question, because if you look at memory as an example,
[00:04:09] yeah, is memory a predicate for consciousness?
[00:04:12] Not really, right?
[00:04:13] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah, people who've lost the adult and lose it without exactly, and these models basically
[00:04:18] are brought up, they are fetus stream of tokens, they output a stream of tokens, and they're
[00:04:22] shut down.
[00:04:23] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:04:24] **Zach Lloyd:** And so that's an interesting question of, is there some sort of other modules that are missing
[00:04:30] here that would allow us to think of it as a conscious thing, because it does reasoning.
[00:04:34] It definitely does reasoning.
[00:04:35] It does interpretation of language, it does synthesis of language and ideas and knowledge.
[00:04:39] I mean, I have a close friend who's doing a PhD in philosophy, and he now says that
[00:04:46] conversing with GPT-5 is better than conversing with his professor.
[00:04:51] **Sarah Guo:** Better than conversing with his professor.
[00:04:52] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:04:53] **Sarah Guo:** That's what he says to me.
[00:04:54] **Zach Lloyd:** He's like GPT-5 gets it, he's like writing his dissertation and he's like, and that's
[00:05:00] crazy.
[00:05:01] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:05:02] **Zach Lloyd:** But we don't credit it for consciousness, and I actually think rightfully so, because
[00:05:08] like.
[00:05:09] **Sarah Guo:** I think people would start doing more credit for consciousness if there was more of a feedback
[00:05:15] loop, where if there was more of a sensory experience that was tied to it, as opposed to
[00:05:19] just like.
[00:05:20] **Zach Lloyd:** What do you mean by sensory experience?
[00:05:23] **Sarah Guo:** Probably we're going to, I would imagine the first things we're going to credit is being
[00:05:26] more conscious or a little bit more robot-like, honestly, where you have some sort of like
[00:05:30] live input from the world that you're reacting to, but again it's going to have the same
[00:05:36] problem where it's like, as long as we know what it's doing, we're very unlikely to
[00:05:41] attribute true consciousness to it, which isn't fair, but like, I actually don't know
[00:05:45] how we will know when there is a conscious thing.
[00:05:48] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah, because that's raised interesting ethical questions.
[00:05:51] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:05:52] **Zach Lloyd:** Because the moment an AI is actually conscious, if you're doing certain things to manipulate
[00:05:57] it, to hurt it in certain way, you know, you're starting to get into these odd ethical
[00:06:02] strates.
[00:06:03] **Sarah Guo:** Totally.
[00:06:04] **Zach Lloyd:** What's it, I do think though that some people, this distinction isn't a thing that they
[00:06:10] recognize.
[00:06:11] And like, the way that you read stories, and we actually had this happen with warp, where
[00:06:15] there was a person who thought that, you know, warp say, I was like, you know, sentient
[00:06:21] or conscious in some way, had like a very strong reaction to it, which makes sense.
[00:06:25] It's like, if you don't know the like, mechanistic underpinnings, and already people think of
[00:06:31] it as like being kind of racist.
[00:06:32] **Sarah Guo:** I'm not happening to Google very early, I happen to Google three or four years ago, if
[00:06:35] you're ever there.
[00:06:36] **Zach Lloyd:** I do remember the story.
[00:06:37] I think they were using Miner, one of these really early chat GPD like internal things.
[00:06:41] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:06:42] **Zach Lloyd:** Before Google launched anything and chat GPD came out, there was internal versions right
[00:06:45] at Google and other places.
[00:06:47] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:06:48] **Zach Lloyd:** And, you know, this person thought that the AI was conscious.
[00:06:52] **Sarah Guo:** Understandably.
[00:06:53] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:06:54] It's a very interesting question.
[00:06:55] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:06:56] You've worked at Google, you've run companies before, you've started companies before,
[00:06:59] you're now working on warp, can you describe what warp does and how it's different
[00:07:02] from other tools or companies in the world?
[00:07:05] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:07:06] So warp is what we call an agentic development environment.
[00:07:08] It's grown out of the terminal.
[00:07:10] The basic concept of the app at this point is it's a platform for telling your computer
[00:07:14] what to do.
[00:07:15] You can sort of tell it in terminal commands, which is warp's original product, or you
[00:07:19] can tell it in English, and if you tell it in English, it launches an agent, and the
[00:07:24] agents can do all manner of development tasks, whether it's coding or setting up a project
[00:07:30] or debugging while you're service crashing.
[00:07:31] And so it's a very horizontal general purpose, and I think unique interface for developing
[00:07:37] with agents.
[00:07:38] **Sarah Guo:** And so a lot of the other coding tools out there are either just kind of a web interface,
[00:07:43] or they do it like a cognition, or there's things like cursor and others where they're
[00:07:47] like an IDE is a starting point.
[00:07:49] **Zach Lloyd:** Yep.
[00:07:50] **Sarah Guo:** Obviously, anthropic and cloud Heather and approach, what do you think is the benefit of doing
[00:07:52] the terminal and starting there is sort of the long point for a lot of these products?
[00:07:57] **Zach Lloyd:** The competitors are typically like VS Code clones, they all have a sort of IDE centric
[00:08:01] approach.
[00:08:02] Or if you're taking a terminal centric approach like cloud code, the most common thing is
[00:08:06] it's just like a pure text-based terminal app.
[00:08:08] The advantage of being at warp's layer is like you get the command line interface, but
[00:08:13] we're the outer app.
[00:08:14] And so we can do things with the developer experience in the UX.
[00:08:18] Like we can have editing features where we think it's appropriate.
[00:08:21] We can build like a code review interface.
[00:08:23] And so we have complete control, but still the terminal first approach.
[00:08:27] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:08:28] And you folks have been growing really well.
[00:08:29] So you're close to a million MAUs, you're doing something like a million in new revenue
[00:08:34] every seven to 10 days.
[00:08:35] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:08:36] **Sarah Guo:** It's like a standing growth.
[00:08:37] **Zach Lloyd:** It's cool.
[00:08:38] **Sarah Guo:** Are there specific features or use cases or things that are really driving this adoption?
[00:08:42] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:08:43] I think the biggest thing was moving into the coding market to be honest, like for a long
[00:08:47] time in warp's history, we were kind of known as the AI terminal, which is cool.
[00:08:51] And like we support a terminal use case is really well.
[00:08:54] Like how do I do this thing with Docker or Git?
[00:08:57] But the action is in coding.
[00:08:59] And like most development activity one way or the other is touching a code base.
[00:09:03] And so we really started to inflect when we launched a great coding agent, which was
[00:09:09] like three, four months ago, honestly, so that's been the biggest change.
[00:09:12] **Sarah Guo:** And how do you think about the different parts of the coding market?
[00:09:14] There's vibe coding.
[00:09:15] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:09:16] **Sarah Guo:** There's professional code.
[00:09:17] Like there's all just one thing.
[00:09:18] Is there these separable things?
[00:09:19] **Zach Lloyd:** I think it's pretty separable.
[00:09:21] So for warp our target is pro developers building like software that's economically meaningful.
[00:09:28] So we really want to like focus on actually people who are using agents to build kind of
[00:09:34] hard apps, apps that might like go into your Mac doc or be pinned as a Chrome tab.
[00:09:41] As opposed to vibe coded apps where I think it's more of a long tailplay.
[00:09:46] And so I do think by the way, it's awesome that anyone can code at this point.
[00:09:51] But I think if you look at where most of the value is in the software market, it's not
[00:09:56] in those long tail apps.
[00:09:57] It's in like a relatively small number of apps that are super heavily used.
[00:10:01] And that's my background like I worked on one of those apps Google Sheets and just like
[00:10:06] I have a lot of passion in terms of helping people build real apps.
[00:10:09] It's much harder, by the way, like I think it's relatively straightforward at this point
[00:10:14] for a good agent to like, you know, with relatively few prompts build like a web app.
[00:10:21] It's much harder to apply these agents successfully to pro code bases.
[00:10:25] So that's where we're focused.
[00:10:27] **Sarah Guo:** So I guess one really interesting macro question for me is where is all this heading?
[00:10:30] **Zach Lloyd:** Yep.
[00:10:31] **Sarah Guo:** And if you look at it, ChatGTBT launched in November of 25.
[00:10:34] Excuse me, November of 22.
[00:10:36] So three years ago or so.
[00:10:38] **Zach Lloyd:** Yep.
[00:10:39] **Sarah Guo:** At the time there was predictions that AI would take over the world and we'd be running
[00:10:42] down the light cone within five years, like everything will change.
[00:10:46] And you know, human activity would be subsumed by AI.
[00:10:49] And you know, there's you old saying in technology that less happens than you think in three
[00:10:53] years and more happens than you think in five years.
[00:10:55] **Zach Lloyd:** Yep.
[00:10:56] **Sarah Guo:** And as you think forward and forward in terms of all these different tools and all these
[00:10:58] different use cases and bad coding versus professional coding and that the role of a software
[00:11:02] developer, where do you think we are in two, three years?
[00:11:05] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:11:06] So the way that I'm thinking of it is there's sort of three phases here.
[00:11:10] For most of my career, we were in like the world of develop by hand, it's how I talk
[00:11:15] about it.
[00:11:16] So my workflow then was like I would open up a code editor, I would find files, I want
[00:11:20] to change, I would type some code, I'd have some assistive features and then I would go
[00:11:24] back to the terminal and I would type commands to build that code.
[00:11:28] And I think we're switching away from that to something like develop by prompt, where
[00:11:32] I start most of the coding tasks that I do right now by prompting an agent and that agent
[00:11:37] does some work.
[00:11:38] And I think there's a third phase which is like automated development.
[00:11:41] Honestly, I think that's like kind of the bigger market here and why people are so excited
[00:11:46] about this space is you can actually use these agents to automate some parts of the software
[00:11:51] development process.
[00:11:53] And so that's like, cognition does that, we're moving into the space, Chris rest background
[00:11:57] agents.
[00:11:59] The rate at which this stuff will happen is like not super clear to me actually, like the
[00:12:07] most recent iterations of the models, in my opinion, were not as big of a step change
[00:12:13] as like, for instance, when I saw it for came out, that was a really big step change
[00:12:18] in coding capability.
[00:12:19] I think there's going to be a mix of interactive and automated pieces of development for a while.
[00:12:25] I would guess like, I don't know, it's so hard to know, like I think within a couple
[00:12:29] of years you'll have everyone working by prompt and you'll have some slice of development
[00:12:33] tasks that are just like in the background, like a server error comes in or a new ticket,
[00:12:39] a user report comes in, something is automatically done, but I don't think it's going to be everything.
[00:12:44] I'd be very surprised.
[00:12:45] **Sarah Guo:** So you don't think there's a point at which all of quitting activity just becomes agents
[00:12:50] doing it.
[00:12:51] And then there's like a human who's kind of giving high level directions, like a product
[00:12:54] manager kind of thing or an engineer manager and maybe, I mean, honestly, maybe, like I
[00:13:00] think that I think it would be silly for us not to like build the infrastructure to enable
[00:13:04] that.
[00:13:05] I just don't, I don't know the timeframe, but I do think we're going towards something
[00:13:08] like that.
[00:13:09] What I, what I really don't think though is like engineering expertise is going to become
[00:13:15] devalued.
[00:13:16] **Sarah Guo:** Sure.
[00:13:17] **Zach Lloyd:** So I think it's actually in the short term at least, it's more important to know what you're
[00:13:20] doing as an engineer than it ever has been.
[00:13:23] **Sarah Guo:** And why do you say that?
[00:13:24] Is it because you need to correct errors that the agents are making?
[00:13:27] Is it because it thinks maybe architect it in a way that isn't scalable?
[00:13:31] Is it something totally?
[00:13:32] **Zach Lloyd:** So it's like, it's like the agents you can think of them kind of as junior engineers.
[00:13:35] So if you didn't have someone who is senior watching them, you end up in a situation where
[00:13:40] these agents will make code that creates bugs, it creates security issues, it causes your
[00:13:46] code base to become really un maintainable.
[00:13:48] And so there's actually like a premium right now on these senior engineer skills where
[00:13:53] you can architect, where you can review code.
[00:13:56] You can make sure the system doesn't degrade.
[00:13:58] And so again, I would be, if I were like early in my CS career, I would be racing towards
[00:14:03] building that expertise where you don't want to be, I think, is like someone who is just
[00:14:08] like perpetually in the junior engineer state because I do think that's at risk.
[00:14:11] **Sarah Guo:** And then how do you think about different security tools?
[00:14:13] Does that, so for example, there's tools like socket or snick or others who are basically
[00:14:19] looking at, you know, whether code has or opensource packets or other things have vulnerabilities
[00:14:23] in them.
[00:14:24] So looking at different aspects of security holes for code in general, do you think that
[00:14:30] just becomes part of these coding tools or do you think there will always be this sort
[00:14:34] of standalone companies?
[00:14:35] I'm just sort of curious how that overall, it's, it's an awesome question.
[00:14:38] **Zach Lloyd:** So I think tools like that become more important.
[00:14:40] I think anything that does like either automatic security analysis or automatic verification,
[00:14:46] I think actually like languages like rust, things that have stronger guarantees around
[00:14:51] safety by default, where you don't need to rely on like a human reviewer become more
[00:14:57] valuable.
[00:14:58] Whether those things like get integrated or bundled into the coding agents, actually don't
[00:15:04] have a strong take on.
[00:15:05] I'm curious if you have a take, but no, I think that the actual fundamental problem becomes
[00:15:09] more important.
[00:15:10] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:15:11] What do you think is bundled?
[00:15:12] What do you think it's bundled?
[00:15:14] Like what sorts of tools do you think?
[00:15:16] Because there's this whole world of deaf tools.
[00:15:19] And there's a security aspect of it, but there's lots of others.
[00:15:22] There's design related things.
[00:15:24] There's, you know, there's a huge spectrum.
[00:15:26] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:15:27] **Sarah Guo:** What do you think just gets, just becomes part of coding tooling?
[00:15:30] **Zach Lloyd:** I think there's going to be a class of tools where you sort of start from the front end.
[00:15:34] This would be things like loveable or bolt-to-replet or maybe even figma make if you're coming
[00:15:38] from the design side.
[00:15:39] And you'll have like an all in one platform for build an app or even like honestly like
[00:15:45] build a business, like put payments in it.
[00:15:48] It's kind of like the evolution of like either a Shopify store front or like WordPress
[00:15:52] or Squarespace or something like that.
[00:15:54] So I think that's all going to be bundled.
[00:15:56] More on like the core pro developer side, I can't tell if it's going to be a world of
[00:16:01] like MCPs and integrations and like all these tools sort of interplay.
[00:16:08] That's one approach or it's going to be more like there's enough alpha and like you put
[00:16:13] all of these things together.
[00:16:15] I think warp is a little bit more like this.
[00:16:17] Like we're trying to build a single pane of glass, for instance, for doing like local
[00:16:21] agents and remote agents and if you get it way better developer experience through
[00:16:26] the bundling, I think that that approach could win.
[00:16:28] But I don't know, like MCP I think is a pretty valuable approach as well, but it's not
[00:16:32] perfect because you end up like with this sort of second-hand data coming into all
[00:16:37] these tools.
[00:16:38] **Sarah Guo:** It's really interesting because if you look at different industries early in the industry,
[00:16:41] things tend to be fragmented often, not always.
[00:16:43] And then later in the evolution of an industry, things get bundled.
[00:16:46] And then when there's a technology disruption, things debondle again and you have point apps
[00:16:50] and then they start bundling.
[00:16:51] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:16:52] **Sarah Guo:** And that's just kind of like the cycle of technology in some sense.
[00:16:54] **Zach Lloyd:** Some things that are vertical right now, like I actually, I think will, like for instance
[00:16:59] like agentic code review, take that.
[00:17:03] To me that should be part of a like holistic agentic development platform, not so much
[00:17:10] a standalone thing.
[00:17:11] So I think some of these verticalized apps, there's just going to be, if you've gone through
[00:17:16] the trouble of building like a really, really excellent coding agent, which warp is invested
[00:17:19] a ton in this, that coding agent should be reviewing code.
[00:17:22] It would be weird to plug in some other thing that needs to relearn all the context, the
[00:17:27] rules, the coding conventions.
[00:17:28] So I think there are definitely some things that will be bundled.
[00:17:31] **Sarah Guo:** That's right.
[00:17:32] Shriana, my team has put together this matrix of companies versus features in the coding
[00:17:36] market.
[00:17:37] And there's a lot of these sort of like single feature companies and it almost feels like
[00:17:40] all these things to consolidate into a small number of players over time, just as they iterate
[00:17:44] into the product.
[00:17:45] **Zach Lloyd:** I think so.
[00:17:46] And I think the core technology is like the harness.
[00:17:50] So the thing that sits around the model and like I know the model companies are also investing
[00:17:54] heavily in this.
[00:17:55] And then it's like the context.
[00:17:57] And so if you have the rich context in your system, you're going to find a lot of vertical
[00:18:02] applications where like I think security checking is an interesting one.
[00:18:06] Code review is definitely one.
[00:18:08] Anything CI related.
[00:18:10] You're probably not going to want to use a bunch of different systems.
[00:18:12] **Sarah Guo:** How do you think about it in the context?
[00:18:14] If I look at other historical technology shifts, the operating system or the platform all
[00:18:19] of them assumes the biggest apps into itself.
[00:18:21] So for example, Microsoft OS, eventually they just bundled windows on top of it.
[00:18:27] Those were the four main apps are being used the most on Windows.
[00:18:30] And some way gaming was the other big apps.
[00:18:31] So that's why they start Xbox and Microsoft.
[00:18:33] If you look at Google and vertical search, they eventually integrated all the vertical
[00:18:37] searches into Google directly.
[00:18:38] **Zach Lloyd:** Totally.
[00:18:40] **Sarah Guo:** In the context of AI, one could argue that if the foundation model companies follow the
[00:18:44] same approach, they should bundle or at least attempt to bundle some of the biggest use
[00:18:48] cases.
[00:18:49] The clearest big use case today is code.
[00:18:51] **Zach Lloyd:** Totally.
[00:18:52] **Sarah Guo:** And we already know the cloud or anthropic as long as cloud code, open AI, you know, almost
[00:18:57] bought windsurf.
[00:18:58] It always had early coding stuff.
[00:19:00] Microsoft, which we know are building some of their own models.
[00:19:03] Obviously I've got hub in Copilot and all that.
[00:19:05] And so do you think eventually those become some of the fiercest players in this market?
[00:19:11] Or how do you kind of view forward looking shifts in the market and where some of this
[00:19:16] functionality goes?
[00:19:17] **Zach Lloyd:** I mean, I do.
[00:19:18] And I think they're clearly trying to do that playbook right now where they are seeing
[00:19:22] like, okay, if you consider them platforms and they're looking at one of the most valuable
[00:19:27] applications that are being built on top of the tokens, they are moving aggressively into
[00:19:31] coding with cloud code and codex, which definitely is like, as a startup is a little bit scary
[00:19:36] for sure.
[00:19:37] **Sarah Guo:** Sure.
[00:19:38] **Zach Lloyd:** The question is like, do they have like that distribution advantage that, say, Microsoft
[00:19:44] had where everyone, if everyone's using Windows or everyone's coming to Google for the
[00:19:47] front door, I think it's pretty easy already to add on the first party app in place of the
[00:19:54] ecosystem.
[00:19:55] I don't, like, I don't know that that exact same dynamic holds for coding right now.
[00:20:01] They're like, the front door is kind of like, honestly, it's still like a native app that
[00:20:07] someone downloads on their computer.
[00:20:09] So that'd be the terminal or the IDE and kind of at the moment, yes, I think controlling
[00:20:14] that is actually like a really interesting front door.
[00:20:17] The other front door, which I feel like honestly, they're not executing that great is
[00:20:22] GitHub where all the source code lives.
[00:20:25] That would be like the locus of doing all this stuff that I think makes the most sense.
[00:20:30] But right now, it's weird dynamic where we're like, we have people who are like running
[00:20:34] cloud code within warp and warp is sort of the outer app in that situation.
[00:20:40] So I don't know.
[00:20:41] The other thing that I hope happens from our perspective is that there's a lot of competition
[00:20:45] at the model layer and that the sort of like intelligent tokens become a bit more of
[00:20:51] a commodity.
[00:20:53] Right now, the models have a bunch of sort of like pricing power because like there is
[00:20:58] a real delta between using the frontier model and using like the open source model.
[00:21:03] But if at some point the models are good enough for coding is sort of, I think if it is like
[00:21:07] solved, it's like good enough you don't need to be using the frontier model.
[00:21:10] Then it's like, yeah, maybe they have an advantage just from brand and scale and but I think
[00:21:15] the advantage is not as entrenched as something where it's like literally the front door like
[00:21:20] Facebook or Google or Windows provides those other ones.
[00:21:25] **Sarah Guo:** That's a really good insight in terms of the way that you launch an activity or application
[00:21:30] then drives what you use.
[00:21:32] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:21:33] **Sarah Guo:** The hard part is often switching people off that and that's one of the reasons I think people
[00:21:36] think open AI has a strong competitive position in the consumer world is because it's a default
[00:21:42] behavior for a lot of people right now.
[00:21:44] It's just start chat to PT and use it for something, which is different from like the model
[00:21:48] layer where there's more switching.
[00:21:50] **Zach Lloyd:** Like I think a consumer chat GPT has a huge advantage like once that that behavior is default
[00:21:57] even if like cloud is maybe better.
[00:21:59] I don't know if it is or not.
[00:22:00] Like everyone knows chat GPT.
[00:22:02] I don't know if you saw opening IDF day yesterday but they're clearly doing this platform
[00:22:06] play within chat GPT now where it's like you have apps within chat GPT.
[00:22:10] I'm sure they'll use that data to sort of subsume or take over whatever the best first
[00:22:15] party integrations are.
[00:22:17] So they're definitely doing that on consumer for developer.
[00:22:20] I don't know that that same dynamic is there.
[00:22:22] **Sarah Guo:** What made you decide to focus on terminals?
[00:22:24] So you know, we started talking years ago and you first started doing warp.
[00:22:29] And even then I think you had really interesting ideas about how to rethink the terminal and
[00:22:32] how to use that as a launching point for all sorts of things.
[00:22:34] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:22:35] **Sarah Guo:** Could you explain that thinking and how it's evolved over time?
[00:22:37] **Zach Lloyd:** Yeah.
[00:22:38] So the basic insider thing that got me excited about warp to begin with is like you have
[00:22:43] this tool that is pretty much a daily use tool for every developer.
[00:22:47] It's that in the code editor and the terminal itself is something that you don't really
[00:22:52] hadn't changed much in the last 40 years.
[00:22:54] It's a tool also where it's like if you get good at it, you can really get a lot done.
[00:22:59] If you use it, it like works across all these different parts of software development,
[00:23:04] not just code writing.
[00:23:05] On the flip side, from my perspective, not a good product, just like hard to learn, hard
[00:23:11] to use, hard to remember commands, super intimidating and just like kind of like a gatekeeping
[00:23:17] vibe around it as well in my opinion.
[00:23:19] And so the original concept with warp was like let's build a better product there and see
[00:23:25] if people will like using it.
[00:23:27] The business concept has evolved the time like the original business concept was like building
[00:23:32] a collaboration platform, which is like we've just changed our model to be an agent platform
[00:23:38] because it's like way more demand for that than a collaboration platform around the terminal.
[00:23:43] But the sort of core insight that this is an important tool, it's crazy.
[00:23:48] It's actually kind of invalidated through all these agent things that are very terminal
[00:23:51] first.
[00:23:52] **Sarah Guo:** You know, one thing that you mentioned that was interesting is that at some point the
[00:23:56] model layer may come out of ties in terms of its coding abilities.
[00:24:00] How far on that SMTOTE do you think we are?
[00:24:02] How close to that do you think we are?
[00:24:04] **Zach Lloyd:** I don't know.
[00:24:06] I think that the increasingly the limit that we see is context.
[00:24:12] And like the reasoning capabilities of the models are pretty impressive.
[00:24:17] The problem is like understanding an entire code base or understanding sources outside
[00:24:23] of the code or literally just understanding user intent are challenging problems.
[00:24:27] I still think there's probably much more to do on the model side, but I don't know
[00:24:31] it is a short answer.
[00:24:33] **Sarah Guo:** And do you think that from a model capability perspective, we've hit a point where to your
[00:24:38] point, it feels like certain aspects of the models are slowing down in terms of the benefits
[00:24:42] or outcomes of further investment of certain types at least?
[00:24:45] **Zach Lloyd:** I think so.
[00:24:46] Like if you take like Sonnet 4 to 4.5 and we're big partners with Anthropicae of great
[00:24:51] models, like that was like a few percentage point increase on sweet bench for us.
[00:24:59] And we invested, you know, we've invested a decent amount to be one of the top agents
[00:25:02] on sweet bench and when we went from 3, 7 to 4, it was a much more significant boost.
[00:25:12] So I again, that's like not, I don't know what that means about the total underlying
[00:25:17] trends.
[00:25:18] I think something with GPT-5 was somewhat similar, like certainly an upgrade and GPT-5,
[00:25:24] I think is actually pretty much on par has different like feel to it and higher latency.
[00:25:29] But it didn't feel to me like as much of a step change as some of the upgrades before.
[00:25:34] **Sarah Guo:** Yeah.
[00:25:35] It sounds.
[00:25:36] What other areas of the AI depth world are you excited about?
[00:25:39] **Zach Lloyd:** I am so I'm really excited about not just like the interactive piece of agents, the way
[00:25:45] most people are working today, but what can you do if you can program against these agents?
[00:25:50] And so for instance, it's like if you have a version of warp that's like headless for
[00:25:57] instance, you can put it in CI and you can sort of do crazy things where it's like, okay,
[00:26:01] every time someone updates the code, make sure the documentation stays up to date.
[00:26:05] It's like that's very annoying for a developer.
[00:26:08] And so allowing developers to automate parts of their job that they don't like doing,
[00:26:15] I think is like a big capability.
[00:26:17] And then from a business perspective, just like automation is a better place to be than
[00:26:22] productivity enhancement, like one of the challenges with our business, I think with
[00:26:26] a lot of the coding businesses is just like proving the ROI, like, and there have been
[00:26:31] these studies that show like, you know, you deploy this stuff on real code bases.
[00:26:35] It's kind of unclear if it's actually having an impact, whereas if you get something that's
[00:26:38] more outcome oriented or more just like an automation, I think it's easier to prove
[00:26:42] the ROI.
[00:26:44] And then you're also not limited by time spent behind keyboard for doing this type of stuff.
[00:26:48] So from a business perspective, I'm very excited about like what's unlocked if developers
[00:26:53] can program these agents.
