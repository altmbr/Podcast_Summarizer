[00:00:00] Hi listeners, welcome back to No Pires. Today I'm here with street art,
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_00: Ramoswami, the CEO of Snowflake, the former founder of Niva and the SVP of Google ads.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_00: We will talk about his first 18 months of being CEO, the incredible execution over that
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_00: time and shifting a company at scale to being AI first. We're the enterprise ROI is and
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_00: what happens to the cloud service providers and the ads model in the age of AI. Welcome street art.
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_00: Sarah, I'm really excited to be back. Well, it's a pleasure to talk to you as an old friend and
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_00: colleague. The last time we spoke, you were on the entrepreneurial journey. That's true. Doing
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_00: search still, you're now 18 months into being CEO of Snowflake. It has been a very eventful 18
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_00: months. Tell us a little bit just about the journey from taking the mantle from Frank to the
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: first few months to where you guys are today. I think the market is reacted in many ways.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_00: Most recently incredibly well to the execution, but it's been a journey. That's right.
[00:01:10] Snowflake has always been an amazing product. The original product that Benoit and Thierry
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_01: conceived the 10 plus years ago was many years ahead of its time. It took the world by storm.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_01: Obviously they had the story of IPO, the biggest software IPO off that at that time.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: I think what happened was the company was a little slow to reacting to changes from things like
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: machine learning and AI. That was a little bit of honestly the reason why Frank while
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_01: internally pushed for the change because he felt presently that we were headed into a time.
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_01: That was just a lot more tumultuous from a product perspective and he wanted someone that was
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_01: product first to be in charge of the company. The last 18 months have really been about embracing
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_01: that wave of change. If you look back to what's happened in the last two years, it's crazy. How
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: much change has happened with respect to AI, how it's become commonplace every day in all of our
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: lives and then the speed at which things are still getting driven through. I think the really amazing
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_01: thing about Snowflake is the company embraced this change, transformed itself and then showed that
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_01: not only can we do it from a product perspective which one could have expected, but we also
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_01: done significant things to retool our marketing or go to market overall. I think that transformation
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: has been pretty amazing to watch. But times can be difficult. Last year, there were a lot of
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: doubters, but there were a lot of us who believed both in the value that Snowflake was already
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_01: creating. The reason I took this job was because I talked a whole lot of customers before I became
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: CEO. They all loved Snowflake and that was a big motivation for me to take this job. I think we
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_01: have successfully written through that and are now at the cutting edge of data and AI for enterprises.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: It's been an amazing journey to our gone through. Walk me through just some of the orientation,
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: prioritization you did in the first six months and then a little bit more about the long-term vision.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. The first six months were a lot of tactical changes, which primarily around accountability.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_01: Like every company that goes through essentially a rocket-shaped phase of growth, growing at 100
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_01: plus percent year on year, Snowflake had basically specialized at every layer possible.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_01: And there was a very long distance between the engineer that did a feature and the customer that
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_01: made use of the feature. And there were like seven to ten layers of teams that were involved.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_01: That works fine. You have perfect product market fit and you're trying to optimize for every function.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: You're just the winning cloud data warehouse. Just like. Yeah. Just that. Try to truck through that.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_00: But on the other hand, if you're working in the world of AI where we can barely tell what's going
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_01: to come out next month, forget next year, this is the wrong structure to have. So we did a lot
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_01: of organizing by different areas, making sure that there were accountable people, for example,
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_01: in product engineering. That was among the first changes, organized into different product areas,
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_01: like AI or the core warehousing analytics product. But then we also wanted a straight line
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_01: over to our go-to-market team. So we created these specialized teams that work closely with
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_01: product and engineering and marketing to take these new products to market. And that was a lot
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_01: of the early phase of Snowflake with an emphasis towards fast iteration. This is something that I
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_01: believe been all my life, which is speed limits, ability to iterate, always trumps carefully laid out
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_01: strategies. Yes, you shouldn't do dumb things. But on the other hand, realizing any kind of gain
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_01: requires a lot of iteration. So we made a number of changes on that side, both with respect to how
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_01: quickly we created products, but also how quickly we iterated with customers. And I would also say,
[00:05:14] we took a little bit of time to find sort of our sweet spot in this AI space. As you know,
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_01: that itself has evolved a lot. We are not a CSP. We are not a foundation lab. So what are we?
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_01: And there was that discovery of ourselves as the AI data cloud, as opposed to the data cloud.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's that kind of clear product insight into what value we add that is setting up
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_01: the stage for the earlier parts of the year or even what we are about to talk about today.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_01: You know, now you're announcing Snowflake intelligence. Tell us, tell us about that and how it fits
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: into the broader vision. I mean, first of all, when it came to AI, as I said, we had to look hard at
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_01: ourselves early last year. We actually went down the path of creating foundation models.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_01: We created a credible MOE model. This was early last year, but we also quickly realized that
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_01: our ability to compete with the likes of open AI or anthropic was going to be really hard. We
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_01: simply did not have the capital to be able to invest meaningfully in things in things like that.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: So we pivoted away from that into much more of a, how does AI massively accelerate what can be done
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_01: with data that is in Snowflake? And or time that can become a reason to bring more data into
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_01: Snowflake, which is the phase that we are in now. But a lot of our AI product strategy was
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_01: actually quite humble. It didn't say we were going to rethink everything. It said enormous number
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: of customers, something like half of the qualifying fortune 2000 companies on the planet
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_01: or Snowflake customers. They had their most valuable data on Snowflake. What does AI mean for that?
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: And so we systematically invested in the components, whether it was search or whether it was text to
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_01: SQL, in ways that added on value to the things that people were already doing with Snowflake.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_01: And SI is an agentic platform, but it's actually an opinionated agentic platform. A lot of
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_01: agentic platforms, for example, from the CSPs will basically say, oh, you can bring in data from anywhere.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_01: Can imagine any kind of workflow that you want to do and the one agent will rule them all,
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_01: which is nice interior, but in practice, and you have an infinity of things that you can do.
[00:07:35] It's also hard to figure out what you should actually do. Snowflake intelligence is very focused
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_01: on how do you create value from data, whether it's structured or unstructured, a whole lot faster.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: The kind of use cases that God is really excited, honestly, internal ones where things like
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_01: if we were to take all of the different dashboards that we used in sales and put it into one single
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: interface, what could that be? We had done two, three versions off this, but eventually that
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_01: culminated in this internal product, we call it Raven, but it's basically the sales data assistant.
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_01: Then we started working with early customers, whether it is a Cisco or a fanatics or the USA
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: BobSled team to figure out what does this all mean for them. The team, again, is get away from
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: the inflexibility of things like dashboards. A dashboard is a 2D view of a complex surface.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: It just has no easy answers to the many questions that any reasonable person your eye is going to have
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_01: off of that. We wanted to create something that freed people off the 2D style of thinking was much
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_01: more flexible in what it gave people access to, but also new its place. This is not a general purpose
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_01: agentic platform to do it all. This is an agentic platform that lets people realize value from data
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_01: faster and is a great foundation for people to get value from data like really quick in a meaningful
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_01: way. I think having the sort of an opinionated framework for AI has been super helpful for us.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: How does a user consume snowflake intelligence? Is it like, I ask a question, I get question answer,
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: it builds dashboards for me on, like how should I imagine that experience?
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so we should show them all snowflake intelligence to you, but yes, it's an interactive
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_01: interface. You can ask questions that are a set of canned questions to make sure that you don't
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_01: have block when it comes to being able to ask questions. You can ask it to say, hey, what data
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_01: sets do you have access to? What kind of questions can you answer? It'll do a perfectly reasonable
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_01: job of that. And our aspiration was for this product to be used by every single employee in the
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_01: company. So it's not for people who can write SQL or it's not for people that can write SQL.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: We wanted it to be enough of a daily use product for every single person. There is not a single
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_01: customer meeting that I'm going to have without quickly checking up on what's the latest with
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_01: this customer. And so, Raven that I talked about our sales data assistant absolutely has things
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_01: like what's our relationship with the customer, what kind of contract have they signed, what is their
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_01: consumption looking like, but also things like what are the most recent conversations that we have had
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_01: with them? What came out of these? Are there any outstanding tickling issues? And so it is a lot
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_01: of that. And like many good products, it, there's breadth, there's value driven to many, many people
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_01: within the company. On the other hand, we don't pretend it's a BI dashboard. There are more things
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: that you can do with a tableau or a sigma than you can do with a SI, but that's not the goal.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_01: Because this product also lets you do a bunch of things that you could not easily do in a dashboard
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_01: and is really meant for any business user. And we place a lot of trust and we place a lot of
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_01: emphasis in all our AI products on trust, meaning we, I tell people, we need to think of AI the same
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: way we think about software engineering, which is there's a right and there's a wrong. It cannot
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_00: be this mode of like yellow AI. You can get some good answers, some terrible answers. It's your
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_01: problem. And so we very much emphasize you need an evil for every single new thing that you're
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_01: going to launch. If you want to change the underlying model, you need to be able to quickly verify
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_01: that you didn't blow up on the things that you are already doing. And so we want it to be the
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_01: trustworthy product for every employee, which is actually a new thing for us, by the way, because
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_01: no flake for pretty much all of its history has always been used by the data team to slap a dashboard
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_01: which then gets exposed to end users. There's a very different motion. This is why we are working on
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_01: things like identity provider integration so that you don't have to set up snowflake accounts for
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: each of the many users you're going to have in your company. We are also by the fact that there is
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_01: subscription for tea. And so snowflake intelligence is very much a consumption product. People pay for
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_01: what they consume and we are experimenting with a bunch of things there in terms of how do we drive
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_01: broad and deep adoption without having people worry about runaway costs and things like that.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: The way you describe Raven or the sales assistant agent use case, it sounds like an application
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_00: or like a lot of applications that I get pitched. Like how do you draw the line between like data
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: and agent system and app today? Back to my point about execution. I tend to be like completely
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: emotionalist about where the strongest current is. On the other hand, it's absurd if we think we
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_01: are SAP or Salesforce. We are not. There are somebody managing a hundred billion dollar supply chain
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_01: ecosystem with a complicated software provider is in saying, hey, I'm going to use a sand I don't
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_01: need that. That's really not the goal. But on the other hand, I think the line between what an
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_01: agent system like this is going to be and what like pure software is going to be will be
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_01: absolutely is going to be bloody. And I can imagine a lot of easy use cases like my sales team has
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_01: to go update Salesforce quite often, you know, because we force them to update when the winner
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: there's use case transition and stuff like that. Can that be done with APIs? Absolutely.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_01: Should you be able to file a vacation on top of workday using our HR agent? I would say that's
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_01: sort of a reasonable thing. And so we very much take this approach of be opportunistic. But again,
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_01: operate from a position of value and strength and not just on naked ambition, because I think that
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: doesn't work out. But if on the other hand, you focus on how do you like what does value creation mean?
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_01: What do these users really want? I think that tends to be much more durable.
[00:13:30] So you're describing a bunch of changes for the organization that you executed on very rapidly,
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: right? Both in always feels entirely too slow. I have always experienced you to be quite impatient.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_00: But you know, for scale seems pretty fast. How do you what what is one tactical thing you
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_00: were doing are doing from a leadership perspective in terms of like move faster or communicate
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_00: new direction internally and get people on board? Because you know, this is a this is a broader
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_00: and different vision for snowflakes than before. Change is harder. You have to acknowledge that.
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_01: And driving behavioral changes from lots of people is incredibly difficult. We were measured
[00:14:13] about how we rolled out changes. For example, among the first changes where leadership and
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_01: alignment changes and clearer accountability that happened within a few quarters because you're
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_01: not dealing with as many people. Yes, you organized the teams under them. But I would say that change
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_01: also what we then call the water room or the part model of product and engineering and
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_01: our go-to-market functions will all work together. That was again an early change. And it was done
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_01: with small groups of people without necessarily disrupting lots of people. I would say other things.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_01: For example, rolling out coding agents to our engineers. That was a project. Not everybody wants to do
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_01: it. Some people are skeptical. Some people are not. I'm a big fan of combining bottoms up with
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_01: top-stown approaches. The example with coding agents is that Benwa, our wonderful founder who fell
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_01: in love with coding agents, did more to drive coding agent adoption with engineers.
[00:15:18] And any number of words from me. You sort of have to find the right people, find the champions.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_01: My take is that every large organization has these forward thinking curious, I'm going to work
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_01: over the weekends to figure out how to do something kind of people. You need to find them,
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_01: you need to encourage them, you need to elevate them and use that to drive change. Top-down change
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_01: can be helpful, but it really needs to come from a bottoms-up perspective. We've rolled out
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_01: coding agents to all of our solution engineers. And they are excited because that just
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_01: dramatically lower the amount of time it takes to create a demo. Usually our demos used to be
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: canned and they were not always customizable to a particular customer. But we can now be like,
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: okay, we know the kind of data we think Ila and Sara are going to have as part of their
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_01: podcast. Let's create a demo with synthetic data sets just for that. I think that's the kind
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_01: of ability that we have gotten. Change is hard. When you and I first met and got to work together,
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_00: you and investor, then you were an entrepreneur. Did either one of those rules change the way you
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_00: are a leader at scale or to see you? I think these things are accreted. They add on ways,
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_01: add on to things in ways that you don't always appreciate or then or ever. It is what it is. I always
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_01: complain to my family about the ten years that I spend doing research and getting a PhD.
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_01: I was like, that was a waste of time. But not really. For example, doing a PhD teaches you to focus on
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_01: ideas. It teaches you to focus on how do you convey them crisply. You often spend enormous
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_01: amounts of time writing for line abstracts. But it actually turns out that's incredibly powerful
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_01: to be able to convey ideas in an easy way. Neva is among the hardest and most heartbreaking
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_01: experiences of my life. It is what it is. Sometimes you are too early. But on the other hand,
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_01: I probably learned more about hustling, took success, far less for granted, learned more about
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_01: social or marketing or any of these other things. But you take for granted a few at Google. At Google,
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_01: whatever you did, my first launch at Google, which was entirely my work for three months,
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_01: one person was covered by the New York Times. I just have immediate scale with that.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: Your idea is your products. Doing a startup real makes you realize that that's actually
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_01: special. I bring quite a lot of that when it comes to what does it take to hustle? What does it
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_01: take to win? Honestly, I think both the Google and the Neva experiences make me,
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_01: somebody that's just a lot more grateful for my job. We talked earlier about how you have to deal
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_01: with a bunch of stuff that you don't really want to deal with when it comes to doing something
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_01: big. I'm a lot more gracious about it. Because it's just such a privilege to be at a place like
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_01: Snowflake to be having the kind of impact that we have. I remember what you told me after summit,
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_01: you said something along the lines of thank you for inviting me to your broad concert. There was
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_01: a line that was more than two blocks long of people waiting to get into Javits Center in New York
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_01: for this little conference that we were doing. A lot more grateful for things like that. There's
[00:18:48] nothing hard to do about it. You, I think, are perhaps the world's expert on game theory and
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: strategy with the tech elephants because you have led the elephant, fought the elephant, and now
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_00: you know, built on top of the elephant. This is the analogy broke down at some point. But in terms of
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_00: the experience of building Snowflake on the cloud service providers, and both for you today,
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_00: and then the analogy for anybody building on foundation models as you are as well. How do you think
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: about that? What's a framework for creating durable value there? I think product market fit
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_01: continues to be magical. Is there reason that Snowflake exists? Think about it. The three hyperscalers
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: would love to just own the data space like they own any other space. But yet, there's Snowflake,
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_01: there's Databricks. And so that that's sort of redeeming value is quite unique. And we should all
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_01: have a lot of humility about what it takes to create that lightning in a bottle. Having said that,
[00:20:02] I think the model companies, especially OpenAI, is super interesting because they are in that phase
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_01: of their growth where they literally like they don't think they cannot do anything.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_01: Yes. Yeah. I joke to people that these are like empires that have not met their oceans just yet.
[00:20:23] And so I think you do have to pay attention to what is likely to be in their immediate path.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_01: So for example, I think coding agents are particularly interesting from this perspective,
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_01: because it is very clear that both Anthropic and OpenAI are going to be laser set on having the
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_01: best one, best one that there is. So I think thinking about what is the likely trajectory of these
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_01: companies. And do they really have a right to it? Or is it something that is different enough
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_01: that you don't really have to worry about? Google, for example, stopped our information. God knows,
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_01: I spent enough time trying to get into physical things like shopping or airline purchases or
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_01: hotels. We didn't really succeed because we didn't have core competence really in some fundamental
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_01: way beyond the world of information. I think it's going to be fascinating to discover what that kind
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_01: of a boundary is for an OpenAI or an Anthropic. But I think there are lots of areas that can be
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_01: reasonably guessed at with respect to where they are going to go. I think that's the one that
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_01: stuff. And early patterns of if you are, for example, a set of prompts on top of one of these
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_01: models, that's a problematic space to be in. You kind of need to add value. I also think a lot about
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_01: what differentiates us from these model companies. This is an area that they're likely to be interested
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_01: in. How do we make sure that we have distance with respect to what we add? And a lot of the urgency
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_01: and change in the products we create in collaboration with these folks aid all take us towards the data
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_01: platform as a durable category. But this is also a time where literally no software company can
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_01: feel secure about their position in the sun. And I actually think that that perhaps is just as
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_01: important as anything else that I just said. To have that orientation of like we need to continue
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: to earn it. If there is anything that you that all of us have learned say from the CSPs,
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_01: it is that they have infinite budgets. They have infinite patience. And unless you innovate and
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_01: stay ahead, not just be ahead, but stay ahead, you will be in tell. I think that's another really
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_01: useful lesson to remember as a company likes North Lake navigates the current role.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_01: And this resonates usually with me both on the dimension of like I'm thinking about
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_00: you know one of the founder CEOs of one of my favorite companies that's now a public company
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_00: that I thought was unassailable. And you know AI I hate to be the person to be like well this changes
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_00: everything, but they feel threatened for the first time in many years. I think that's a pretty
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_00: common experience right now as a software CEO. I think especially when the technical environment
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_00: is so fluid, defensibility is built not strategized. That's correct. It's built every single day.
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_01: You have to keep moving. One of the questions I would have on the data cloud is like you even if
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_00: you don't have the CSPs budget, you do have the ability to make multi-year plans. And you
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_00: you know joined Snowflake because you saw like a vision for it to be much more than the data cloud
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_00: as a technologist. Like when you look out three to five years like how do you expect
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_00: people to think of Snowflake both you know in the ecosystem and then customers to use it most.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_00: Our core strength comes in that data platform layer. You know I sometimes internally talk about
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_01: being there for our customers from inception to insight. From when is data when data is first
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_01: conceived to when somebody gets an insight that feeds back into that system. In fact the pitch
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_01: that I make to CEOs or CDOs that I meet for the first time is really that the great companies
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_01: of this century a company like a Google are a meta where more data first companies
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_01: than like purely product first companies than pretty much any others compared to before.
[00:24:27] You build cars and then you can edit an instrumentation to make sure that it didn't crash or what
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_01: the maintenance records for that was. Even products think about it. If you built something like Adobe
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_01: Photoshop in the 19s you did a bunch of research you built the product and then you send CDs
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_01: over to various people and then you waited for some feedback to come back is all data was always
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_01: like a slow afterthought. But search as for example was magical because the behavior what people did
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_01: interacting with these ads went back into influencing what happened to that system pretty much
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_01: like in a few minutes. And my data teams were as large as the product teams. And what I tell our
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_01: customers is that we want to be that companion for all different kinds of data. We want them to
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_01: have the expertise that the Google and the metas of the world have. And so we see AI as a massive
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: accelerant for things like that because all of a sudden CEOs now realize wait this is not just
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_01: about data modernization. This is not just about me being able to run more queries or perhaps
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_01: caught up a machine learning algorithm. This could influence how my business operations work.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: This could influence what efficiency means for me as a category. So I think that's the tailwind
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_01: that we have from AI because the value of data just got vastly elevated. That's our aspiration.
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_01: And with respect to the CSPs my take is that a company like Snowflake which comes data first
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_01: as opposed to a set of services first with an emphasis on simplicity and integration.
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_01: You can create as large a database as you like on Snowflake and it'll be completely shareable
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_01: within the company. It'll be completely shareable to your partners. And when we talk about AI in Snowflake
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_01: it's not as an afterthought. It will work with all of the governance that you have put before.
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_01: And that kind of an integrated approach we think will have durability because over time the idea
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_01: of buying like raw compute and storage and writing code in order to solve a problem
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_01: just it never gets easier. And so we had a higher level of abstraction.
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_01: Pre AI this was my main thesis for why I wanted to be part of Snowflake. I said a data platform
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: that especially spans CSPs has the right. You have to learn it has the right to be as large as a
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_01: CSP itself. And so that was roughly you know why I joined the company our medium-term vision
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: for what we want to be. And as I said AI I think is a massive excellent on how do you get value
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_01: from data faster or how do you get better at acting on data quicker.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_01: When you think about the overall data landscape today there's the data that's traditionally been
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_00: in Snowflake and then like you know the investments you've made in new partnerships you're
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: announcing. Can you explain like why SAP and some of the other partners you're working with now?
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah this is a good question. I think for a while Snowflake had a Snowflake centric
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_01: view of the world. Plenty of people brought in data from SAP are from workday are from Salesforce
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_01: but what is increasingly happening is that all of these companies realize that this is
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_01: incredibly valuable data. It's not quite their data it's customer data but they understand that
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_01: it is valuable and they also understand that this line between software and services and software
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_01: and data is also blurry in a pretty meaningful way. And the one quality that I learned from Google
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_01: working in areas like payments which is all about partnerships was that partnership mentality.
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_01: Was how do you pick a set of folks and figure out how you can create value together.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_01: Among the earliest places where this went to work was in our relationship with Microsoft
[00:28:24] which was okay but not that great because they had a 1p relationship with Databricks
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_01: and they're always kind of conflicted about is fabric the answer or Snowflake the answer.
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_01: Of course you know this Satya is the master of how to create winning partnerships
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_01: and so we took a lesson from kind of how to get out of them and how to adjust them as you need to.
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_01: So we've been working on a partnership with them for you know the past couple of years.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_01: This is both product integration with things like fabric but also how do the companies work
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_01: together. I think they're in a much better place now compared to say 18 odd months ago
[00:29:02] that yes there is an understanding but we will compete with some customers and that's fine
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_01: and we will collaborate on a whole set of other customers with let's say Azure plus Snowflake is
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_01: a strict positive. It's just the same again the same attitude that we have with AWS and we are
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_01: working on a similar sort of arrangement with GCP. I think the software providers are different
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_01: as I said they understand that the world is changing so with folks like SAP we are actually
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_01: thinking much harder about what is that 1 plus 1 equals 3 with SAP I think it's going to be
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_01: absolutely bidirectional data share but can we also collaborate in the area of analytics and AI
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_01: and agents and make it easier for people to create these on top of SAP data. I think that can
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_01: also become a leverage point for us to expand out to more companies because SAP has incredible
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_01: presence throughout the globe and so I think it represents a maturing of how we think about
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_01: partnerships. We absolutely want to do this with a few other key folks. This is another kind of
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_01: thing that you can do with every company but I think that partnership mentality create value
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_01: together is something that will stand us in good stead and hopefully also be profitable for us
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_01: with respect to generating more business. I want to close out with two of the most common questions I
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: get that I think you are more prepared to answer. The first is just you know with every enterprise
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_00: customer I talk to one of the first two questions is going to be where are the highest ROI use cases
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_00: for AI for my business. You run a large business you serve large businesses like what is your
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_00: stack rank here? How do you think people should address it? Every company now has a set of
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_01: technologies even if they're not software companies they need to deal with technology. I would
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: say that coding agents are probably the easiest ROI. I just in terms of making new projects faster,
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_01: making demystifying technology so that more people can get at it. As I said earlier we are large
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_01: users of coding agents and we're working on coding agents that are going to be part of Snowflake
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_01: because we want to make it easier for people to be able to use Snowflake itself. What's good for
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_01: other people is also good for Snowflake. I think absolutely areas like customer support which
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_01: fits the pattern of here is a repository of human knowledge. Here is an easy backup in case the AI
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_01: cannot do something plus its ability for AI models to effortlessly tap into voice into typed
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_01: questions and generate answers. That's an area where there is clearly a whole set of ROI.
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_01: Faster, easier, more seamless access to data, especially when it's combined with I don't have to pay
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_01: for $50 per user per month license is another easy ROI item and that's part of
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_01: kind of our motivation for Snowflake intelligence of democratizing data access. These are among the
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_01: areas where it's just more or less guaranteed ROI. But the other way to think about this is I think
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_01: obsessing about a lot of ROI too quickly is also a bad idea for many companies because you don't
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_01: want your first step to be 100 feet. You want to do a lot of little things that sort of prove value.
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_01: There's nothing you know people can get plenty of value from using you know the chat GPDs even the
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_01: free ones and tools like that for many day to day things that we do. I think the more companies
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_01: demystify what it is to use AI. I think the more chance they have of figuring out how to get value
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_01: because you take the risk. I place a lot of emphasis on how many shots do you take on goal? How
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: many projects can you run very very quickly so that you get a feel for what's the landscape of change?
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_01: The sales data assistant had three versions that came before it. They all built this one.
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_01: Well actually they all stuck. They all added more and more things on top. You did the first one was
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_01: just on enablement. The second one was a little bit more about customer information. We also had an app
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_01: called customer you know it was called yeah customer 360. It was a stream load app. So Python app
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_01: that you could get that kind of information from all of these then culminated into the sales
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_01: assistant which is all of these things combined. To me it's the journey of iteration that's often
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_01: just as important as you know I have that big one thing that I managed to launch. I prefer not to
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_01: take big bets whether it is in getting engineering projects done or these kinds of projects. I think
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_01: iterating and creating value every step of the way is the key and there's the same advice that I
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_01: give to our customers. I go like you should not spend a lot of money on AI with snowflake. You should
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_01: do it a thousand bucks at a time and when you have significant value that you feel good about
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_01: then you can wrap it up. This is one reason I'm like very bullish on applied companies that
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_00: know what their immediate usefulness is because the landscape of what you could do with AI if you
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_00: have customer trust and you understand the workflows is very large. And I think there's just you know
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_00: land for the taking for people who have the velocity and the and sort of also the paranoia to keep
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_00: expanding into that. But it is also an argument for like why that layer should exist because you're
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_00: just reducing the time to value versus somebody building it themselves with a generic framework or
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_00: just straight APIs and engineering work as well. And what a lot of our customers have found out for
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_01: example is that creating something like Cortex Analysts which in some simple days text to sequel
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_01: is actually a much harder problem than they actually think. There's more trust in snowflake
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_01: because we did many many analyst projects before we ever got into something like snowflake
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_01: intelligence which is a step level increase both in capability but also complexity. And the other
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_00: question that I get asked a great deal is what do you think happens to ads on the internet if we
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_00: have you know chat interfaces that are much more directed instead of offering you 10 blue links.
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_00: I have to ask you. This is a great question. I think advertising is just an incredibly powerful medium
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_01: and it's an incredibly powerful business. And there are good ways of doing advertising. I'm actually
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_01: you know seven years from Google. I'm actually more proud of the work that we did in the search ads
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_01: team now than I was when I left Google. I think there are good ways of doing it and you know
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_01: it when you see it. It's a little bit off. You know, it's it's very clear. It will reinvent itself
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_01: in the chat world. Let's just hope it doesn't become more insidious in terms of discoverability and
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_01: being able to tell what's an ad or not. It would sure be creepy for you to have a psychiatrist that has
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_01: like a certain affinity for prescribing one medication versus other. Those are the kinds of
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_01: unfortunate things that we will discover. But the ad model is here to stay. It will just come
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_01: in different forms. And I think as long as it's done well, it's a reasonable model. And as a
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_01: consumer, you also have to be smart about what's in these things for you. And I think ever more than
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_01: before, there's an increased premium on preserving our agencies. I think that is what we all have to
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_01: do as individuals. I am really encouraged how strongly like citations and sourcing and models
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_00: has taken off in different experiences. I certainly think that the set of things that are being
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_00: presented to consumers has narrowed a great deal. But the fact that people want to go look at
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_00: primary sources and understand where information has come from, even given all of this reasoning
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_00: is a useful indicator. It's a very positive thing. I think
[00:37:14] and the nice thing about some of this is that it is not a whole lot of work for you to say,
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_01: take a deep research article written by Gemini, pasted into chat GPT and asked it to verify all of
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_01: the, you know, all of the links that are there. I think we do have more tools. You know,
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_01: this we have talked about how we did citations at Niva, how proud we were then that we launched it in
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_01: early 2023. I think that's an idea whose relevance is still as strong as ever. And I think, you know,
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_01: products like chat GPT deep research are truly amazing in terms of the value that they can create
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_01: for anyone and think about it. Like you and I can get an expert paper literally on any topic. We
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_01: just have to have the brain power to be able to digest it. I think that's pretty that's pretty
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_01: amazing. And it's really fun to see some of these core technologies embrace things like that as
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_01: opposed to just writing like Pierce's article, they could or leave it. I want to ask you one last
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_00: architectural question because you have worked for such a long time on information retrieval and
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_00: search. You also understand LLM's you work with a lot of structured unstructured data today. So
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_00: you're just a very well rounded point of view. I think there is a contingent of folks that believe
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_00: that like traditional informational retrieval techniques and indexing is less and less relevant as
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_00: more data is available through the model, even in enterprise use cases or non-consumer use cases.
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_00: How do you think about that? It is tempting to trivialize things like search as just information
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_01: retrieval. The insight that powered Google was patient. It was a way of harnessing the power of
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_01: the entire internet to figure out what was popular and what was not. But PageRank ran out of juice
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_01: like in six years, like 2004-5. And while Google never really liked to talk about it,
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_01: the kind of things that became more and more relevant was the click behavior
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_01: on top of the search results that Google presented. It was that feedback loop that eventually
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_01: gave it so much value. And so when it comes to AI systems including SI, remember I talked about
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_01: your values. And that's a fundamental construct that you need to be able to launch some meaningful
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_01: product. But it'll also turn out that that's the construct that you need for that product to get
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_01: better and better over time. Perhaps we will figure out a way to encode that as well into the
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_01: context that's presented into the model. But to me right now it's similar to like should LLMs be
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_01: able to do math? Okay, I can argue, yes, they should be able to do math. They're so powerful.
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_01: But as any reasonable person will tell you a smarter person is going to say no, they should not do
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_01: math. Instead I should write the two lines of Python, which I know how to direct and run the Python
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_01: in order to solve the math problem. I think of trust in a very similar way. There are well-known
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_01: solutions for figuring out what is the most trustworthy when it comes to a question that you want to
[00:40:36] answer. Why would you not use that? And think of that as another tool that whatever AI system,
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_01: agentic system that you're building is going to use rather than be kind of like in this maximalist
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_01: mode of the AI can solve everything. I think all practical people will use the best tools available
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_01: to them at a given point in time. At least at this point in time, there's enough value from these
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_01: outside tools, including search, that I don't see the point of trying to dismiss it right now.
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's a very principled point of view of like a maximal intelligence will use reliable tools
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_00: where they're available. One of the first time wherever it is available. There's like you cannot be
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_01: so smart that you don't use the computer. Exactly. Or there's no bravery in just like hard work
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_01: without we think if something can be done easily, you get a focus here on energy on other things.
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_01: I think that'll very much be the case. And the prevalence of things like search APIs is actually
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_01: a testament to the fact that all of these models benefit from things like that because they provide
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_01: that external information that is not easily internalizable just into the AI model just yet.
