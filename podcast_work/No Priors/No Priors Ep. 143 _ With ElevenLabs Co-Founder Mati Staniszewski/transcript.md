[00:00:00] Hi listeners, welcome back to No Pires. Today I'm here with Maddie Synthesis, the co-founder
[00:00:10] Sarah Guo: and CEO of 11 Labs, which was founded to change the way we interact with each other
[00:00:15] Sarah Guo: and with computers with voice. Over three short years they've skyrocketed to more than
[00:00:20] Sarah Guo: 300 million in run rate. Maddie and I talk about the future of voice, education, customer
[00:00:26] Sarah Guo: experience and the other applications of this voice, as well as how to build a multi-segment
[00:00:32] Sarah Guo: from self-serve to enterprise and combined research and product company. Welcome, Maddie.
[00:00:36] Sarah Guo: Sara, thanks for having me. And thank you for doing this at 7 in the morning.
[00:00:40] Sarah Guo: Our pleasure. Thank you for doing that at 7 in the morning. It's great to, we got to finally
[00:00:45] Mati Staniszewski: do this together. I think a lot of our listeners will have used or played with 11 at some point,
[00:00:49] Sarah Guo: but for everybody else can you just reintroduce the company? Definitely. At 11 Labs we are
[00:00:54] Mati Staniszewski: solving how humans and technology interact, how you can create seamlessly with that technology.
[00:01:01] Mati Staniszewski: What it means in practice is we build foundational audio models, so models in a space to help
[00:01:06] Mati Staniszewski: you create speech that sounds human, understand speech in a much better way, or orchestrate
[00:01:12] Mati Staniszewski: all those components to make it interactive and then build products on top of that foundational
[00:01:16] Mati Staniszewski: models. Any of our creative product, which is a platform for helping you with narrations,
[00:01:21] Mati Staniszewski: for audio books, voiceovers, for ads or movies, or dabs of those movies to other languages,
[00:01:26] Mati Staniszewski: and our agents, a platform product, which is effectively and offering to help you elevate
[00:01:31] Mati Staniszewski: customer experience, build an agent for personal AI, education, new ways of immersive media.
[00:01:38] Mati Staniszewski: But all is kind of under underlight of that mission of solving how we can interact with
[00:01:42] Mati Staniszewski: technology on our terms in a better way. You started the company in 2022. That's right.
[00:01:48] Sarah Guo: You've had amazing rocket ship growth since then. I'm sure it's felt up and down different
[00:01:52] Sarah Guo: ways. I want to ask you about that. Can you give a sense of what the scale of the company is today?
[00:01:57] Sarah Guo: So we've grown to 350 people globally. We started from Europe. We started as a remote company
[00:02:03] Mati Staniszewski: and I still first remote first, but I have hubs around the world with London being the biggest
[00:02:07] Mati Staniszewski: New York, the second biggest Warsaw, it's San Francisco, and now Tokyo and in one in Brazil.
[00:02:13] Mati Staniszewski: We are at 300 million in ARR, which is roughly 50-50 between self-serve. So a lot of subscription
[00:02:22] Mati Staniszewski: and creators using our creative platform and then approaching 50% on the enterprise side using
[00:02:28] Mati Staniszewski: our agents platform at work. And that's on the saleslet, classic saleslet side. And we serve
[00:02:35] Mati Staniszewski: more than 5 million monthly active on that on that on that creative side of the work. And then
[00:02:40] Mati Staniszewski: on the enterprise side, we have a few thousand customers from Fortune 500s to some of the fastest AI
[00:02:45] Mati Staniszewski: growing startups. I think this is such a, you're an amazing founder, but I also think it's such an
[00:02:49] Sarah Guo: interesting company because it is very unintuitive to, I think, many people and investors in particular.
[00:02:56] Sarah Guo: I don't know if you've faced this at the beginning, but I'm in both here in 2022. There's a class of
[00:03:02] Sarah Guo: companies that allow creation in some way. When we look at your first business beyond the research
[00:03:07] Sarah Guo: itself, and I would put 11 and mid-Journey and Suno and Haitian in this category. And I think there's
[00:03:15] Sarah Guo: like this overall sense of like, who really wants to do this? What was your initial read of like,
[00:03:22] Sarah Guo: how many people want to make voices or what made you believe that was going to be much broader than
[00:03:28] like if I look at dubbing, for example, it's not a huge market.
[00:03:32] Sarah Guo: I think first piece was, which is, as you mentioned, there is like a very, it's very tricky to do
[00:03:36] Mati Staniszewski: both the product and the research. I'm in a lucky position that my co-founder and I know,
[00:03:42] Mati Staniszewski: for 15 years, I think he's the smartest person I know, and has been able to create a little of that
[00:03:47] Mati Staniszewski: research work to be able to create that foundation to then elevate that experience. But both of us are
[00:03:53] Mati Staniszewski: from Poland originally, and the original belief came from Poland. It's a very peculiar thing, but
[00:03:57] Mati Staniszewski: if you watch a movie in Polish language, a foreign movie in Polish language, all the voices,
[00:04:02] Mati Staniszewski: whether it's a male voice or a female voice are narrated with one single character. So you have
[00:04:06] Mati Staniszewski: like a flood delivery for everything in a movie. That's a terrible experience. It's a terrible experience.
[00:04:11] Sarah Guo: And it still, if you grow up, the as soon as you learn English, you like, switch out and you don't
[00:04:17] Mati Staniszewski: want to watch content in this way. And it's crazy that it still happens until today, in this way,
[00:04:22] Mati Staniszewski: for a majority of content. Combining that in I work to volunteer, in my co-founder work at Google,
[00:04:28] Mati Staniszewski: we knew that that will change in the future, and that all the information will be available
[00:04:33] Mati Staniszewski: globally. And then as we started digging further, we realized in every language, in a high quality
[00:04:39] Sarah Guo: way. Exactly. And the big thing was like, instead of having it just translated,
[00:04:46] Mati Staniszewski: could you have the original voice, original emotions, original intonation carried across?
[00:04:52] Mati Staniszewski: So like, imagine having this podcast, but say people could switch it over to Spanish, and they
[00:04:57] Mati Staniszewski: still hear, sorry, they still hear, and the same voice, the same delivery, which is exactly what
[00:05:03] Mati Staniszewski: we did with Lex back when he interviewed in our interview, and you could immerse yourself in that
[00:05:07] Mati Staniszewski: story a lot better. So that was the original insight. And we then started digging further,
[00:05:15] Mati Staniszewski: which is that so much of the technology we interact with will change, whether this is how you create.
[00:05:22] Mati Staniszewski: It's still actively tricky to bring voice alive. You would need to go through the expensive
[00:05:29] Mati Staniszewski: process of hiring a voice talent, having a studio space, having expensive tooling to then actually
[00:05:34] Mati Staniszewski: adjusted. The tooling is intuitive to be able to do this. So like all that creation process
[00:05:39] Mati Staniszewski: will and should change to make it easier for new people with keenness to bring that alive.
[00:05:44] Mati Staniszewski: Then a lot of the technology wasn't possible for you to be able to recreate a specific voice or
[00:05:50] Mati Staniszewski: be able to create that in that high quality way. And then of course, as we dive into further
[00:05:55] Mati Staniszewski: and shifted away from the static piece, the whole interactive piece is still crazy in the
[00:06:00] Mati Staniszewski: way, the functions where most of us seeing this technological evolution over the last of our last
[00:06:06] Mati Staniszewski: decades, but you still will spend most of your time on the keyboard. You will look at the screen,
[00:06:10] Mati Staniszewski: and that interface feels broken. It should be where you can communicate with the devices through
[00:06:17] Mati Staniszewski: speech. For the most natural interface there is one that can start when the humanity humanity
[00:06:23] Mati Staniszewski: started. And we realized we want to solve that. And I think now it's fast forward from 2022.
[00:06:29] Mati Staniszewski: I feel like many people will carry that belief too. That voice is the interface of the future.
[00:06:33] Mati Staniszewski: As you think about the devices around us, whether it's smartphones,
[00:06:37] Mati Staniszewski: when it's computers, whether it's robots, speech will be one of the key ones. But I think 2022,
[00:06:41] Mati Staniszewski: it wasn't. And as you think about the market for the creative side or for that interactive side,
[00:06:47] Mati Staniszewski: it was very clear. It will be a huge, huge, huge one.
[00:06:52] Mati Staniszewski: So even when you think about just the research part of your business, and then you have
[00:06:58] Sarah Guo: products for at least two different markets, and then you have this larger mission,
[00:07:01] Sarah Guo: a lot has changed in the last five or 10 years. But it used to be a very strongly held
[00:07:06] Sarah Guo: traditional belief of one must do one thing well in a startup, and there's no other path.
[00:07:11] Sarah Guo: You're treating this interaction company, platform company. How did you think about sequencing
[00:07:16] Sarah Guo: like the research and the product effort? Does that make sense? They're thinking about new markets.
[00:07:21] Sarah Guo: And maybe wrapped up in that question too, is just like, well, where are we in quality on
[00:07:26] Sarah Guo: unvoiced as well? Because if I would sort of claim, like if the models are not good enough for
[00:07:33] Sarah Guo: certain use cases, it all makes sense to product. And I think that's right. It's almost exactly
[00:07:39] Mati Staniszewski: like when we started originally what we did was try to actually use existing models that were
[00:07:44] Mati Staniszewski: in the market and optimize them for our first use case was actually starting with
[00:07:49] Mati Staniszewski: combination of narration and dubbing, and then on that creative side. And we realized pretty quickly
[00:07:55] Mati Staniszewski: that the models that existed just produce such a robotic and not good speech that people didn't
[00:08:01] Mati Staniszewski: want to listen to it. And that's where my co-founder's genius came in, where he was able to assemble
[00:08:05] Mati Staniszewski: the team and do a lot of the research himself to actually create a new version of creating that work.
[00:08:11] Mati Staniszewski: But like to your question, I think that the way we are can organize internally and how we think
[00:08:16] Mati Staniszewski: about sequencing a lot of that was looking at the first problem and then creating effectively a
[00:08:21] Mati Staniszewski: lab around that problem, which is like a combination of mighty researchers, engineers, operators
[00:08:27] Mati Staniszewski: to go after that problem. And the first problem was the problem of voice. So how can we recreate
[00:08:32] Mati Staniszewski: the voice? And like you say, it needs to have that research expertise to be able to do that well.
[00:08:38] Mati Staniszewski: So we started with effectively a voice lab, which was that mission of can we narrate the work in
[00:08:44] Mati Staniszewski: in batter way? There was a combination of roughly five people that were doing that work. And then
[00:08:50] Mati Staniszewski: sequence the research first and then build a simple layer on top of that work to allow people to
[00:08:55] Mati Staniszewski: use that work and then kind of expand it from there with a holistic suite for creating a full
[00:09:00] Mati Staniszewski: audio book and then creating a full movie narration, a movie dab. And then we move to the next problem,
[00:09:06] Mati Staniszewski: which was realization that, okay, we have solved the voice, great for making content sound human,
[00:09:12] Mati Staniszewski: the first problem for that to be useful for us to interact with the technology, to solve how you
[00:09:17] Mati Staniszewski: bring the knowledge on demand into that. So effectively started then the second team, which was
[00:09:22] Mati Staniszewski: a second lab, an agent lab effectively, which was a team that would combine researchers,
[00:09:28] Mati Staniszewski: engineers and operators once more, which would try to fix, okay, we have text to speech.
[00:09:33] Mati Staniszewski: How do they now combine this with LLAMs and speech to text and orchestrate all those components
[00:09:38] Mati Staniszewski: together while integrating that with other systems to make it easier? And then similarly, you know,
[00:09:44] Mati Staniszewski: you kind of expand from looking just a device layer into how those systems work together. And here too,
[00:09:50] Mati Staniszewski: you need a research expertise to do that in a low latency way, efficient way, accurate way. But at
[00:09:57] Mati Staniszewski: the same time, there's that product layer that starts forming that it's not only the orchestration
[00:10:01] Mati Staniszewski: that matters. It's also the integration of how you link up to the legacy systems, how you build
[00:10:06] Mati Staniszewski: functions around it, or how you deploy that in production and test, monitor, evaluate over time.
[00:10:11] Mati Staniszewski: Do you feel like you were creating new use cases when you built the tools to people know that they
[00:10:16] Sarah Guo: wanted to do this already? Because one argument like that I remember hearing was like, ah, like,
[00:10:23] you know, enterprises don't know what to do with voice. How many people really want to do it and
[00:10:26] Sarah Guo: then you're serving essentially like perhaps the like creator publisher side of your business? Yeah.
[00:10:31] Mati Staniszewski: It's definitely a combination of like initiatives that we believe will happen in the world. And
[00:10:35] Mati Staniszewski: they're like, response to a lot of that. Like as I think back, we, you know, of course, voice,
[00:10:40] Mati Staniszewski: the internal voice lab or agents lab, then kind of that kick started so many of the other labs
[00:10:46] Mati Staniszewski: in response to the problems. We started a music lab because people wanted to create music with
[00:10:51] Mati Staniszewski: 11 labs. So it's a fully licensed model where people wanted to use and create speech, but they
[00:10:56] Mati Staniszewski: wanted to add music in a simple way. We wanted to deliver that. And then of course, that kind of
[00:11:01] Mati Staniszewski: came together through how do we combine music, audio, sounds. We are now integrating partner models
[00:11:07] Mati Staniszewski: from image and video into that suite is how could you combine all of that in one? And all of that
[00:11:13] Mati Staniszewski: was in response to the market saying, hey, we would love this. And then you will have completely
[00:11:17] Mati Staniszewski: different use cases, even in that space, let's say dabbing dabbing is a use case that we didn't
[00:11:22] Mati Staniszewski: feel there was like a big push for that. But we knew that in the ideal world in the future,
[00:11:28] Mati Staniszewski: you will be able to have that content delivered naturally around the languages still caring that.
[00:11:34] Mati Staniszewski: And I still think actually this market will be immense because it's not going to be only the
[00:11:38] Mati Staniszewski: static delivery in movies. But if you travel around the world and want to create a real time,
[00:11:43] Mati Staniszewski: like the full bubble fish idea from HGHG.Guy.org. This will happen. It will be like the biggest
[00:11:49] Mati Staniszewski: like the whole breaking down language barriers that are the barriers to communication,
[00:11:54] Mati Staniszewski: to creation, all of that will break. And that will be like the foundational real time dabbing
[00:11:58] Mati Staniszewski: concept. So super excited about that part. And similarly on the on the agent side, you are like
[00:12:06] Mati Staniszewski: some obvious things that of course, customers that we work with or partners will want to want to
[00:12:10] Mati Staniszewski: integrate, which is we want integrations with x, y, z systems. But there are like other parts
[00:12:15] Mati Staniszewski: that might not be as easy to predict of as you interact with technology. Of course,
[00:12:19] Mati Staniszewski: want to understand what's happening. But you also want to understand how the things are being
[00:12:24] Mati Staniszewski: said and bring that into the fold, which would be something we try to prioritize on our side.
[00:12:28] Mati Staniszewski: So then the people when they actually interact with technology, they realize, oh, expressive thing
[00:12:32] Mati Staniszewski: is actually so so much more enjoyable and beneficial and helpful. So I want to ask you a question
[00:12:36] about this, which relates to quality. I work with a series of companies where we're
[00:12:43] Sarah Guo: selling a product to the buyers. There's generally not machine learning scientists.
[00:12:48] Sarah Guo: Right. Right. And even the scientific community does not have the like full suite of evals
[00:12:53] Sarah Guo: in benchmarks to understand every domain. Well, there's a well-known problem. But I imagine for
[00:12:58] Sarah Guo: a lot of your customers, it's not like they like know how to choose good voice. So how do you
[00:13:03] Sarah Guo: how do you deal with that problem? Like is it like a hey, I make a clone and like that sounds like me
[00:13:08] Sarah Guo: and I believe in I'm going to try all of these different options or or you know, actually,
[00:13:13] Sarah Guo: are you teaching people to do evil? It's a great question because I think there are like two big
[00:13:18] Mati Staniszewski: problems. One is like how do you benchmark the general space in audio where I could say it's like
[00:13:24] Mati Staniszewski: so dependent on the specific voice. Let alone like if you are training into interactive,
[00:13:28] Mati Staniszewski: then it's like even more tricky. And then the second piece, which is as you are working with specific
[00:13:33] Mati Staniszewski: use case, how is selective voice? So I'll take the second front first, which is we have like a voice
[00:13:38] Mati Staniszewski: somewhere here effectively. We've asked we work with with enterprises. We we deploy that person
[00:13:44] Mati Staniszewski: to work with them and help them navigate that person is like a voice coach has an incredible
[00:13:49] Mati Staniszewski: voice themselves. And now we have like a team under that person that like will partner to help
[00:13:55] Mati Staniszewski: you find what's the right branding. Yeah. And now you have like the celebrity marketplace.
[00:13:59] Sarah Guo: And now I have a celebrity marketplace to like help you even get the iconic talent in there,
[00:14:04] Mati Staniszewski: like Sir Michael Cain. That piece was important because of course the voice will depend on the
[00:14:09] Mati Staniszewski: use case that you are trying to build, the language, all of that will will have an impact of what's
[00:14:13] Mati Staniszewski: the right voice for your customer base. So we have effectively a voice person helping those
[00:14:20] Mati Staniszewski: companies. And some companies will be very open-hearted on one day one. So they will sometimes
[00:14:24] Mati Staniszewski: selected themselves. Sometimes give us a brief of a we want a voice that sounds professional,
[00:14:29] Mati Staniszewski: neutral is coming. We recently had a company one of the one of the biggest European companies
[00:14:34] Mati Staniszewski: that wanted that gave us a brief, which is very original, that they wanted us robotic voice as
[00:14:41] Mati Staniszewski: possible. Okay. It was on a content Twitter. Yeah. But for example, you're like we can't do that
[00:14:46] Mati Staniszewski: anymore. Almost. But we are like trying to go backwards of like how do we do that? But I think we
[00:14:52] Mati Staniszewski: got a good result. But recently we had a company in Japan where Japan and Korea where they wanted to
[00:15:01] Mati Staniszewski: serve different voices depending on the customer that's calling in. They have a older populationing
[00:15:06] Mati Staniszewski: and a very younger population. The younger one they wanted like one of the famous voices in the
[00:15:09] Mati Staniszewski: market. That's very excitable and happy. And for the older one they wanted like a calm, slow speaking
[00:15:14] Mati Staniszewski: one. We have a lot of that. So that's on the voice piece and I do think it's going to be a big
[00:15:20] Mati Staniszewski: personalized choice. And then it can even be dynamic. That's true. Yes. Exactly. Exactly. And then maybe
[00:15:26] Mati Staniszewski: in the future it's like going to be like fully depending on your interaction. You will have a voice
[00:15:31] Mati Staniszewski: created. It's as we understand the preferences of what people want. So like let's hear in the evening
[00:15:37] Mati Staniszewski: and you are tired and you want to slightly different or maybe not. Maybe that's like the best
[00:15:41] Mati Staniszewski: a focus time that you have like a voice that's giving that energy and probably it's a different
[00:15:46] Mati Staniszewski: when you wake up and gives you the morning news of what's happening or what's the weather. So like
[00:15:50] Mati Staniszewski: all of those could be different. Yesterday we had a dinner with some of our partners and one of them
[00:15:58] Mati Staniszewski: the first thing they said is like, hey, I have a new request for you. I want a New York voice with
[00:16:02] Mati Staniszewski: a long Island voice accent, which I never knew as a thing. And it's supposedly a thing. So
[00:16:08] Mati Staniszewski: so we have that. And then on the first piece, I think it's unsolved problem still where I think
[00:16:12] Mati Staniszewski: you have a good benchmark. So of course in our lambs, I think in image space, they are pretty good
[00:16:18] Mati Staniszewski: in voice space. You you have of course the speech quality, but then so much of whether you like or
[00:16:23] Mati Staniszewski: not the speech depends on the voice that just if you compare a model A to model B and you serve
[00:16:30] Mati Staniszewski: them different voices, even if the quality is very different, the voice itself can just make that
[00:16:35] Mati Staniszewski: so different. We've seen this. I don't know if you're not artificial analysis benchmarks. I think
[00:16:40] Mati Staniszewski: they're pretty good. Just switching the voice makes that excited. That's so interesting. Yeah. And
[00:16:45] Sarah Guo: I wonder if as you said, this is the most dominant interaction mode we've had for millennia of all
[00:16:52] Sarah Guo: of human history. Right. And so my bias is observing, but I think so. We're just very sensitive to it.
[00:16:57] Sarah Guo: And I think people are going to be very sensitive to their their own personalization as well.
[00:17:03] Sarah Guo: 100% I think this is a third piece, which maybe it's not directly to your to your to your node,
[00:17:08] Mati Staniszewski: but we've also realized that you have so you're the benchmarks, you have like how do I find the right
[00:17:13] Mati Staniszewski: voice for my audience, but even the understanding of how you describe audio data is still lagging in
[00:17:19] Mati Staniszewski: the industry. Like when we initially started, we of course went into the traditional players for
[00:17:24] Mati Staniszewski: them to help us label not only what was said, so like transcription, but also how it was said.
[00:17:29] Mati Staniszewski: Like what are in emotions use accent? And most people just well aren't able to do that work
[00:17:33] Mati Staniszewski: effectively because you kind of need to hear and have like a little bit of a skill set of like how
[00:17:39] Mati Staniszewski: would I describe this specific delivery? We need to create data ourselves. So I think that is
[00:17:44] Mati Staniszewski: that piece as well of like how do you effectively interpret the data of audio in a in a more qualitative
[00:17:51] Mati Staniszewski: basis? That's that's that's yeah, trigger. Can you talk about what's happening on the agent platform
[00:17:58] Sarah Guo: sign like what is challenging for you know businesses or even creators that are trying to build agents
[00:18:04] Sarah Guo: and what the what maybe what the surprising or high traction use cases are. I think everybody's
[00:18:08] Sarah Guo: kind of aware of the idea of like agent based customer support, but I imagine you're doing
[00:18:12] Sarah Guo: many things beyond that. Yeah, so that exactly customer support is probably the one that's like
[00:18:17] Mati Staniszewski: kicking off the quickest and that's that the one that's like we see overtaken so many use cases,
[00:18:22] Mati Staniszewski: what is where I work with Cisco or Twilio or Telles digital all of all of them are kind of
[00:18:28] Mati Staniszewski: elevating that to high extent. I think the second exciting piece within that domain which is
[00:18:33] Mati Staniszewski: happening is the shift from effectively a reactive customer support. I have a problem. I'm
[00:18:38] Mati Staniszewski: reaching out the customer support into more of like a proactive part of the experience customer
[00:18:44] Mati Staniszewski: support. So to make it explicit, we work with the biggest e-commerce shop in India, Misho,
[00:18:52] Mati Staniszewski: where they started working on the customer support side where I want to refund. I want to see
[00:18:57] Mati Staniszewski: the tracking of the package to actually having an agent be a front part of the experience. So if
[00:19:03] Mati Staniszewski: you go to the website, you can you have the widget you can engage it for voice and you can ask
[00:19:08] Mati Staniszewski: it, hey, can you help me navigate to item X item Y or can you explain what's the right thing for
[00:19:15] Mati Staniszewski: me to give up for a gift for this period of time. And then it will actually help you based on your
[00:19:20] Mati Staniszewski: questions based on what is on the offer. Show you those items, navigate to the right parts of the
[00:19:25] Mati Staniszewski: piece, maybe go all the way through the checkout. And I think this will be a phenomenal thing of
[00:19:28] Mati Staniszewski: like elevating the full experience where that's more of an assistant across the whole thing. We
[00:19:33] Mati Staniszewski: can't kick to our work with Square that enables all the businesses to do that work exactly the same
[00:19:37] Mati Staniszewski: pattern. Started with voice ordering. How can now this be part of the full discovery experience too
[00:19:43] Mati Staniszewski: where you get items shown to you. You can have a lot more explanation which I think will be a
[00:19:47] Mati Staniszewski: phenomenal piece where where is that effectively from the beginning to the end. That's one category.
[00:19:52] Mati Staniszewski: The second one is the wider shift from static to immersive media where there's just so much
[00:19:59] Mati Staniszewski: incredible stories in IP that today exist in effectively one way of delivery. And now you'll be
[00:20:05] Mati Staniszewski: able to interact with that content in a completely new way. We are I think one of the incredible
[00:20:11] Mati Staniszewski: use cases was working with Epic Games. We worked with them on bringing the voice of Darth Vader
[00:20:16] Mati Staniszewski: and Darth Vader into Fortnite where millions of players could interact with Darth Vader's life
[00:20:22] Mati Staniszewski: in the game where you had like a full experience of Darth Vader in a new way. And I think this will
[00:20:29] Mati Staniszewski: be a theme across what is talking to a book, talking to the character that you like to the whole
[00:20:36] Mati Staniszewski: the whole space shifting. And then I think the one that's that I'm most excited about for the world
[00:20:42] Mati Staniszewski: for the shift is going to be education where you will just be able to have like effectively a
[00:20:48] Mati Staniszewski: personal tutor on your headphone and you could like actually study something in an amazing way.
[00:20:55] Mati Staniszewski: I'll give you like two quick examples. One is we recently worked with chess.com and I'm a huge
[00:21:01] Mati Staniszewski: fan of chess. I'm a huge fan. Okay great. So you can learn chess but you can have Ikaro Nakamura
[00:21:07] Mati Staniszewski: or Magnus Carlsen be your your teacher of how you deliver that which is amazing or even
[00:21:13] Mati Staniszewski: bought the sisters or it's like all the plethora of different players that engage with that which
[00:21:18] Mati Staniszewski: I think is great. And then maybe a last one which is a master class who we work with to
[00:21:23] Mati Staniszewski: shift from you can of course have the home then we go through step by step. But you can also have
[00:21:29] Mati Staniszewski: like an interactive experience. And the best example of that was working with Chris Boss,
[00:21:34] Sarah Guo: the FBI negotiator, one of the top negotiators. Where's the master class lesson?
[00:21:38] Mati Staniszewski: But then you can actually call him and have a practice negotiation which is crazy. Yeah,
[00:21:42] Mati Staniszewski: gotta get that hostage out. We'll definitely try it. Yeah. Can I add one more? I think the one last
[00:21:48] Mati Staniszewski: one which combines all of them together which I which I realized just recently is which was crazy.
[00:21:54] Mati Staniszewski: So recently I went to to Ukraine where we are working with ministry of transformation where
[00:22:00] Mati Staniszewski: they are effectively creating a first agent in government. And the crazy thing is they have all
[00:22:05] Mati Staniszewski: of those. Agent in government. Okay. So they want to like re-change of how they run all the ministries.
[00:22:12] Mati Staniszewski: Okay. And it sounds like a big ambitious goal and not the. No, I think the baseline is like here.
[00:22:18] Sarah Guo: So actually I'm by that ideally. Yeah. And the crazy thing is I think they are like so ahead
[00:22:24] Mati Staniszewski: and actually doing that. And I think they are like two concrete things there. One day they kind
[00:22:30] Mati Staniszewski: of combine all those use cases. So they we are looking into how they can have effectively
[00:22:35] Mati Staniszewski: customer support of government whether it's asking about benefits or employment about
[00:22:39] Mati Staniszewski: process of how you leave the country. All of that be run through effectively a digital app.
[00:22:45] Mati Staniszewski: Then two how you can have proactive way of informing citizens of things that might be happening.
[00:22:49] Mati Staniszewski: But then having a education system that also run through like this personal tutoring experience.
[00:22:55] Mati Staniszewski: And all of that is happening. So that was incredible to see. And the second amazing thing was that
[00:22:59] Mati Staniszewski: the way they've done it. So they have the digital transformation piece. But they have engineering
[00:23:04] Mati Staniszewski: leaders in each of the ministries that lead those efforts and then bring them back to that one central
[00:23:09] Mati Staniszewski: piece. So that is like an incredible to see and and also proud to be able to be working with
[00:23:14] Mati Staniszewski: with them on that shift. But despite everything that's happening, they're like so amazing.
[00:23:19] Mati Staniszewski: That's really encouraging. Can I say business model question here? Because looking at the strategic
[00:23:24] Sarah Guo: landscape. Actually, I have many questions here. One of the observations I'd have is if I look at
[00:23:30] Sarah Guo: one of these like rich voice and action agent experiences. It's a lot of let's say fortune 500
[00:23:38] Sarah Guo: global 2000 leaders who listen to the pod. They I think a lot of them are going to buy the idea
[00:23:44] Sarah Guo: of like I want this amazing automatic like real time available 24 seven every language experience
[00:23:53] Sarah Guo: for my customer. That's consistent and high quality. The ways I might get there include working with
[00:24:01] Sarah Guo: a Palantir or a large consulting firm working with 11 or a like platform technology company or
[00:24:11] Sarah Guo: or like an opening eye or something. Right. Let's talk about that or working with a sort of more
[00:24:18] Sarah Guo: use case oriented company like Sierra. Right. How do you think about how people are making that
[00:24:22] Sarah Guo: decision or how they should make that decision? The so so my past is also in Palantir. So I started
[00:24:28] Mati Staniszewski: exactly. And from from that side and we do blend a lot of the forward employed engineering inside
[00:24:32] Mati Staniszewski: of the company too. I say think about the kind of our offering and and the customers making that
[00:24:37] Mati Staniszewski: choice. If you're looking just like says like one pointed solution and only that one then likely we
[00:24:44] Mati Staniszewski: aren't the best choice. If you are looking to deploy that across a plethora of different experiences.
[00:24:49] Mati Staniszewski: So I'll be a customer support but then you also want internal training and you might want to elevate
[00:24:54] Mati Staniszewski: your sales part and actually increase the top line with new experiences of how you engage customers
[00:24:58] Mati Staniszewski: beyond that kind of reactive piece. Then it's a great platform to build and then we effectively a
[00:25:04] Mati Staniszewski: sweet and gator of customers combined at platform work with with our engineering resources to help
[00:25:10] Mati Staniszewski: this company's deploy on that or which we also see increasingly in unfortunate for hundreds due
[00:25:16] Mati Staniszewski: to a few thousands where they will want to build parts of the things themselves because they already
[00:25:21] Mati Staniszewski: have a lot of the investments in that platform while then engage us on some of the new ones and
[00:25:27] Mati Staniszewski: combine those. And and and I think that our model and the way it's different to a lot of the
[00:25:31] Mati Staniszewski: use case specific ones is that our platform is relatively open where you can use pieces of that
[00:25:37] Mati Staniszewski: platform and not all of them for for those different use cases. Panty of course will or some of
[00:25:43] Mati Staniszewski: the consulting companies will have a lot more resources to go into wider digital transformation journey
[00:25:48] Mati Staniszewski: in our cases like very specific conversational agents. Like if you are looking for new interface
[00:25:54] Mati Staniszewski: with customers that's the best way and and companies like Sierra phenomenal of course on on how they
[00:26:00] Mati Staniszewski: are thinking about the specific pointed use case and then maybe the other pieces like a sweet thing
[00:26:07] about our work depending on how you are what you are optimizing for so we have a lot of international
[00:26:14] Mati Staniszewski: partners if you have like a wider geographic user base great that's what we optimize for our voices
[00:26:20] Mati Staniszewski: our languages our support for integrations internationally are just so much broader. There's
[00:26:25] Mati Staniszewski: just picking the piece that you will look into depending on and your exact scope this will be
[00:26:30] Mati Staniszewski: this will be a big factor but I would summarize that if you are looking for a solution across
[00:26:34] Mati Staniszewski: the set of different use cases that you want our engineering help and deployed at then we are the
[00:26:41] Mati Staniszewski: right solution and probably the best solution. I want to talk a little bit about maybe like
[00:26:46] Sarah Guo: opening I and the foundation L and foundation model companies one of the reasons a lot and I
[00:26:50] Sarah Guo: call this podcast no priors is because we're like okay people are making a lot of assumptions all
[00:26:55] Sarah Guo: the time about how the market is going to work and loan behold like many of those assumptions end
[00:27:00] Sarah Guo: up being nonsense actually and you can't you have to very much decide your own narrative at this
[00:27:05] Sarah Guo: point in time. I think correct me if I'm wrong like in 2022 and 23 you probably heard a lot of
[00:27:11] Sarah Guo: people say like Google can do this and open AI can do this and like why do you get to persist
[00:27:16] Sarah Guo: working on voice anyway as a general capability but what's the answer. That also adds as I can
[00:27:22] Mati Staniszewski: a lot another element to to to that the couple of the other previous questions where what is agents
[00:27:27] Mati Staniszewski: work what is the creative work. Deploy the value in those in those work you need a very strong
[00:27:33] Mati Staniszewski: product layer you need the integrations you need to help people deploy the work which is the
[00:27:36] Mati Staniszewski: most common piece but our superpower and our focus for a long time was building the foundational
[00:27:43] Mati Staniszewski: models to actually make that experience seamless and as I think about the companies in the market they
[00:27:48] Mati Staniszewski: will optimize for a lot of other things and that that will be like the differentiator in our case
[00:27:55] Mati Staniszewski: where we will make their whole experience especially with voice seamless human controllable in a
[00:28:03] Mati Staniszewski: in a much better way. So fundamentally you would argue that like the labs are just aren't going to
[00:28:08] Sarah Guo: focus on this and have it. Exactly so I think most of those companies and as I think about the
[00:28:13] Mati Staniszewski: long term it's going to be incredible research an incredible product that meets customers where
[00:28:20] Mati Staniszewski: they are and work backwards from there. I don't think the the labs will focus on building that
[00:28:24] Mati Staniszewski: product layer that's so important but I think the part of the question that you're asking is like how
[00:28:30] Mati Staniszewski: or and why they haven't done even the research part to the quality that we've been able to
[00:28:37] Mati Staniszewski: us here I'm also biased but we are happily beating them when benchmarks with text to speech or speech
[00:28:42] Mati Staniszewski: to text or the orchestration mechanisms and here credit to all micro founder and the team that they've
[00:28:47] Mati Staniszewski: been able to do it is it's just a mighty researcher is just continuing their work but I think the
[00:28:52] Mati Staniszewski: main part that I think is different in audio space is that you don't need the scale as much as you
[00:28:58] Mati Staniszewski: need the architectural breakthroughs the model breakfast to really to really make a dent and
[00:29:05] Mati Staniszewski: and we've been able to do that a couple of times and I think the number of people doesn't matter but
[00:29:10] Mati Staniszewski: the people that you do does we think there's maybe 50 to 100 researchers in audio space that could
[00:29:16] Mati Staniszewski: do it we think we have probably 10 of them in the company that that are some of the best ones and I
[00:29:23] Mati Staniszewski: think this obsession of just those people working across and then actually giving the full focus on
[00:29:30] Mati Staniszewski: the company on making them actually work on that and bringing their work to production seeing
[00:29:36] Mati Staniszewski: how the users interact back was so important that's I think how we how we been able to create
[00:29:43] Mati Staniszewski: models better than some of the top companies out there but you know the truth is it's like
[00:29:49] Mati Staniszewski: too large extent is why they weren't able to do it is also like an interesting we don't know it's
[00:29:53] Mati Staniszewski: okay it's it's it's they are like they have such an incredible talent there too how do you think
[00:29:58] of the same time about like open source models anyone you're asking the company I think we'll say
[00:30:03] Mati Staniszewski: that the same and that's like a narrative we think about it's in the long term models will
[00:30:08] Mati Staniszewski: commoditize or the differences between will be negligible for some of these cases they will still
[00:30:12] Mati Staniszewski: matter for most like the long like the most use cases they want and and and they'll be broadly
[00:30:18] Sarah Guo: available and they will be available exactly and we don't know where that is where it's two years
[00:30:23] Mati Staniszewski: three years four years but it's it's going to happen at some stage then of course you will have a
[00:30:27] Mati Staniszewski: fine tuning layer that will matter a lot on on top of those models but like the base models I think
[00:30:32] Mati Staniszewski: will get pretty good and that's why for us the product piece is so important from the company
[00:30:37] Mati Staniszewski: perspective but also from the value perspective because if you have a model that's great but to
[00:30:42] Mati Staniszewski: actually connect your business logic and knowledge to to be able to have the right interface for
[00:30:48] Mati Staniszewski: creating a an ad for your work or a completely new material that's that's a very different exercise
[00:30:54] Mati Staniszewski: that open source models are getting if I split into two like more of that async content narration
[00:31:00] Mati Staniszewski: a thing narration is pretty much open source is great commercial models are great differences are
[00:31:07] Mati Staniszewski: getting smaller on the on the out of the box quality what most of the models haven't figured out
[00:31:13] Mati Staniszewski: and I think we we where is how to make them controllable so that's the kind of the narration piece
[00:31:19] Mati Staniszewski: I think the whole interaction piece of how you orchestrate the components together whether that's
[00:31:23] Mati Staniszewski: cascaded speech to text the length to speech approach or whether in the future it's a fused
[00:31:27] Mati Staniszewski: approach where you train them together I think this is is good for customers support customer
[00:31:32] Mati Staniszewski: experience but it's still a way away from like conversation like we have like passing that
[00:31:37] Mati Staniszewski: during test so I think this is still like a at least a year like a within a year and then you
[00:31:44] Mati Staniszewski: will have like real-time dabbing kind of variation of like real-time translation conversation and I
[00:31:50] Mati Staniszewski: think that's maybe like more two years within two years away you know a very uncomfortable belief
[00:31:56] Sarah Guo: that I I feel comfortable having this belief but I think it's uncommon in the market right now is
[00:32:01] Sarah Guo: that actually most advantages in technology like they could they could last you a year or they
[00:32:07] Sarah Guo: could last you ten but they're not like infinitely defensible and if you think about that from a
[00:32:12] Sarah Guo: model quality perspective or a product perspective they allow you to like serve the customer better
[00:32:19] Sarah Guo: and build momentum and build scale for some period of time and actually that's really powerful
[00:32:24] Sarah Guo: over time right but it's not like a clean forever answer and so I think that makes I don't know
[00:32:30] business people and investors uncomfortable and I mean it's it's it's it's it's very true
[00:32:37] Mati Staniszewski: the way I mean the way you think about it research is head start this gives us we can give
[00:32:42] Mati Staniszewski: advantage to the customer earlier and it's six 12 months of advantage that is also a way for us
[00:32:48] Mati Staniszewski: to build a right product layer for you to get best of that research frequently we do that in
[00:32:53] Mati Staniszewski: parallel so the moment the research is out there you have the product because we know our initiatives
[00:32:57] Mati Staniszewski: we know what the product is that's right so you have research product and pile that extends that
[00:33:02] Mati Staniszewski: but they're kind of the thing that will really give that long-term value is the ecosystem that you
[00:33:07] Mati Staniszewski: create around whether that's the brand and distribution whether that's the collection of voices you
[00:33:11] Mati Staniszewski: can have the collection of integrations you can build the workflows that you can build and like
[00:33:16] Mati Staniszewski: I think that's that's the way we can sequence that in our mind that research product ecosystem
[00:33:20] Mati Staniszewski: that we built and and research all it is is a is a head start and being able to like accelerate
[00:33:27] Mati Staniszewski: the future with closer I think that's a really powerful insight especially if you know the research
[00:33:33] Sarah Guo: and the research team and the company team believe that as well internally it's it's it's I think
[00:33:38] Mati Staniszewski: the piece that we I was like interesting for us is and I think this is like the the big questions
[00:33:43] Mati Staniszewski: for all companies that the research and product is do you wait for a research or do you do like a
[00:33:49] Mati Staniszewski: product change or even not only research product companies like do you wait for someone else to do
[00:33:53] Mati Staniszewski: the research because the timeline for that isn't clear is it three months six months 12 months you
[00:33:57] Mati Staniszewski: don't know exactly where it will do which is their hard choice of like do I invest into product layer
[00:34:02] Mati Staniszewski: or do I just wait more for the research so like in our case we internally let's all the product teams
[00:34:08] Mati Staniszewski: the research initiatives so we can paralyze that work but we don't hold them that if if a
[00:34:13] Mati Staniszewski: product team thinks we should deliver value to the customer by doing something different they can
[00:34:17] Mati Staniszewski: and rough rule of time is like three months if we think it's going to be longer than three months we
[00:34:21] Mati Staniszewski: probably build it if it's less than that we probably want can you talk about some of the research
[00:34:26] Sarah Guo: that you're doing now and then how you think about like the cadence of delivery and what's worth
[00:34:30] Sarah Guo: working on we have now a number of different initiatives across the audio space and they're they're
[00:34:35] Mati Staniszewski: kind of too big buckets and and and roughly they will relate to that creative and agent side on the
[00:34:40] Mati Staniszewski: creative side what this means with the text to speech models that are controllable we then at
[00:34:46] Mati Staniszewski: the speech to text model that transcribes in a high accurate way but across a low
[00:34:50] Mati Staniszewski: resource languages as well so covering all 100 languages then created a music model a fully
[00:34:56] Mati Staniszewski: licensed music model and as you think about the future it's how those models will also interact
[00:35:00] Mati Staniszewski: with some of the visual space so that's a lot of effort in how you can get the best of audio and
[00:35:06] Mati Staniszewski: then potentially combine that with existing video that you have to really have the best delivery
[00:35:12] Mati Staniszewski: and then on the agent side it's of course how you optimize the real-time speech to text,
[00:35:18] Mati Staniszewski: real-time text to speech we just released our speech to text model scribe 2 which is
[00:35:23] Mati Staniszewski: under 150 milliseconds 93.5% accuracy across the top 30 languages on on flowers and it's only
[00:35:29] Mati Staniszewski: top 30 here because we serve so many others but most of the people don't so so it's so it's
[00:35:35] Mati Staniszewski: beating beating the all the models on benchmarks but as you think about the future it's also the
[00:35:40] Mati Staniszewski: orchestration piece of how you bring speech to text element text to speech we are releasing
[00:35:45] Mati Staniszewski: we'll be releasing over the next couple of months a new orchestration mechanism that will lower
[00:35:50] Mati Staniszewski: the end-to-end part we think in a great way but second thing which is what is so hard is it's not
[00:35:57] Mati Staniszewski: going to only allow you to combine those pieces but add also the emotional context of the conversation
[00:36:03] Mati Staniszewski: so you can actually respond with the model and we think a more expressive and a better way
[00:36:08] Mati Staniszewski: and then the future and something we're investing is paralyzing a speech to speech more
[00:36:13] Mati Staniszewski: fused approach as well and of course depending on the use case if you are like enterprise
[00:36:17] Mati Staniszewski: reliable use case the cascaded approach is the approach for the next year to has more structure
[00:36:21] Mati Staniszewski: yeah more structure you have more visibility into each of the steps it's reliable you can
[00:36:26] Mati Staniszewski: I call tools if you're putting more expressive and can hallucinate speech to speech might be
[00:36:31] Mati Staniszewski: the choice and maybe over time you'll see them the kind of go one over over another depending
[00:36:36] Mati Staniszewski: on the industry but that's like a huge investment on our side which is where I have the foundation
[00:36:41] Mati Staniszewski: of all the platform and and the main part that we are continually investing in is is kind of
[00:36:46] Mati Staniszewski: platform of different models that combine the best of audio with some of the best of their other
[00:36:51] Mati Staniszewski: modalities together I want to take our last few minutes and ask you a few questions about just
[00:36:56] Sarah Guo: the future that I think you'll have a really good point of view on giving you think about
[00:37:00] Sarah Guo: voice and audio all the time what do you think of AI companions I think they will
[00:37:05] Mati Staniszewski: be a big thing in existing a big way not something I'm personally excited about or something that
[00:37:11] Mati Staniszewski: we spend much time on but I think the whole line of what's a assistant companion character that
[00:37:20] Mati Staniszewski: you enjoy as part of experience what kind of blurry and blend the large extent is
[00:37:26] Mati Staniszewski: going to be very common but you're not like enthusiastic personally about it I'm more excited
[00:37:31] Mati Staniszewski: about like more of the Jarvis version of that or like like more of like I have a super assistant
[00:37:38] Mati Staniszewski: super pilot that kind of versus the social version that's like I think it's just would be
[00:37:43] Mati Staniszewski: like such an incredible unlock and it's also like it's in a and it's something blending in
[00:37:48] Mati Staniszewski: that personal I have context I love to start the day and like someone that understands me and
[00:37:53] Mati Staniszewski: like start and tell me what's like relevant to me and open the blinds and then I like tell me
[00:37:57] Mati Staniszewski: about the weather and sunshine it's our it'll be in play music straight away it's gonna happen
[00:38:01] Mati Staniszewski: it's gonna happen that time excited for I think the companion use case as well will will mention
[00:38:06] Mati Staniszewski: solving loneliness and in that part I think that's one way maybe there are like different ways of
[00:38:12] Mati Staniszewski: engaging people back I do I do think there will be like an interesting future even if you think
[00:38:16] Mati Staniszewski: about the education where you will have superpower with learning from AI tutors but I think on the
[00:38:21] Mati Staniszewski: flip side of that and I think this will like that's my personal take you will have
[00:38:26] Mati Staniszewski: education a good percent of time spent with AI tutors but then explicit percent of time spent
[00:38:33] Mati Staniszewski: without any technology human to human so you can you can kind of learn that part too yeah I think
[00:38:39] Sarah Guo: is the correct model um both in terms of like emotional guidance and coaching and um you know
[00:38:47] guardrails right as well as like peer-ture yeah exactly what do you think about um
[00:38:53] dictation or what happens in terms of how we like control uh technology that isn't necessarily
[00:38:59] Sarah Guo: personified as well or does it just all become personified I think not all personified I think
[00:39:04] Mati Staniszewski: like some you know communicative and often and and home probably will like stay pretty static and
[00:39:10] Mati Staniszewski: or code I might just yeah exactly like you didn't probably need that much of like additional
[00:39:15] Mati Staniszewski: emotional input but uh but I think it's yeah it's going to be huge parts where like in a way what
[00:39:21] Mati Staniszewski: if pop will happen is you will have ability to like stay more immersed in the real life with the
[00:39:26] Mati Staniszewski: devices going into back into the pocket back into some version of a attached element and assuming
[00:39:32] Mati Staniszewski: that's that's in the in the right setting and and and that kind of acts on your behalf and then
[00:39:38] Mati Staniszewski: in many ways like let's say dictation it's as Carpati says decade of agents let's let's let's call
[00:39:43] Mati Staniszewski: the decade then you'll have a decade of robots if you are interacting with robots of course
[00:39:48] Mati Staniszewski: voice will be the input and the output as one of the key interfaces so you will need a dictation as
[00:39:54] Mati Staniszewski: a as a huge part but similarly I think the robot's going to be personified yeah yeah yeah 100%
[00:39:59] Mati Staniszewski: 100% yeah no like yeah yeah I think the I think most of the use cases will be personified
[00:40:05] Sarah Guo: okay last one what's like one thing that you've seen already exist today or if you project out a
[00:40:10] Sarah Guo: few years we'll change about how we interact with content maybe it's like personalized voice content
[00:40:17] Sarah Guo: or just something people are going to do with with AI voice that they don't do today or that
[00:40:22] Sarah Guo: not everybody knows about I think this still the biggest one that hasn't yet kicked into that
