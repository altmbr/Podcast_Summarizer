[00:00:00] Thanks for doing this.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_02: Of course.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, thanks for coming in.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can just start with, like, for anyone who hasn't heard of Harvey, what is the
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_00: company can you talk about the scale and who you serve today?
[00:00:16] At Harvey, we're building AI for law firms and large in-house teams.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_01: We're almost at a thousand customers, 500 employees, started about just over three and a half
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_01: years ago and so been scaling quickly since then.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_01: You guys were some of our Boji seed investors, so that could be here.
[00:00:36] Maybe from a most basic perspective on the product, why is it not just co-pilot or touch
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_00: the BT or cloud?
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_01: I think that's how the product started.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: When we first raised from OpenAI, we got access to GPD4 and I think GPD3 to GPD4
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: was such a big model jump that the intuition at the time was just give the model to lawyers
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: and have them play with it.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_01: I think that industry was so text heavy that you got so much value from just interacting
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_01: with the models.
[00:01:10] Then I think as soon as you gave it to lawyers, you also ran into all of the sharp edges
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_01: of the models.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_01: They hallucinate.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_01: They're not connected to a bunch of our context.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: I would say the first two years of the company were how do we build essentially the IDE
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_01: for lawyers around these models that connect it to all of the contexts you need to be productive
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: as an individual lawyer?
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: But I would say in the past year and going forward, the big problem we're solving is not,
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_01: how do you make individual lawyers more productive?
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: It's how do you make a team of lawyers working on a client matter more productive?
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: And more importantly, how do you make an entire law firm working on thousands of these
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: client matters more productive and more profitable?
[00:01:51] So I think when you get to that scale, a lot of the problems you're solving are not just
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_01: model intelligence problems.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_01: They are these orchestration governance and all of the enterprise product problems that
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: you run into at scale.
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_02: You've also been broadening from just law firms into enterprises and to big companies using
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_02: you in concert with both our in-house legal teams and external counsel.
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_02: Keep talking more about that and how that's been evolving as well.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: So we started selling to the largest law firms and something that started happening about
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_01: a year and a half ago was these law firms started showing Harvey to their clients and their
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_01: clients both wanted to collaborate more effectively with their law firms and they also wanted to
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_01: use this directly in their in-house department.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_01: So we recently announced we signed Walmart.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_01: We're working with AT&T.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_01: A bunch of these Fortune 500 large private equity firms, Global 2000, kind of the largest
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_01: consumers of legal services.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: And what we're starting to build is a platform for the in-house teams to do the work that
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_01: they do internally.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_01: So things like contracting and this long tail of all of the legal operations you need to do
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_01: that you typically don't send out to law firms.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_01: But also the collaborative tissue of I'm working on a large transaction, a litigation,
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_01: I need outside expertise.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_01: I want to securely share this data with my law firm.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_01: And there's a lot of technical problems there around security, data privacy that we want
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: to solve so these law firms and their clients can collaborate effectively.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_01: I think for, you know, we have a largely technical audience, but also most people don't know
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: exactly what legal workflow looks like.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_00: I think before we really started working together, I imagined it was just like, well, what do
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: you mean?
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_00: I like email my lawyer and he thinks about it and reads a document and then sends something
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_00: back.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_00: And there's like redlining involved somewhere.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: Maybe there's negotiation.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_01: Can you paint a picture of just what workflow means to you guys?
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of people, when they think about legal, they think of consumer legal.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_01: And so I have a lease and I need to get input on that.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_01: That's completely different than what these massive law firms are doing.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: And so I think a really good example of what these firms are doing that, I mean, you guys
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_01: will be familiar with.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of people in the startup space will be familiar with is what law firms
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_01: do for venture capital firms or private equity firms.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_01: And so VCs, PE firms, they do two main things.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_01: You raise money and you invest it.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_01: And so the main legal and podcast, which is actually important, but there's less legal
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_01: work there.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_01: And the important things you need to do there are fund formation.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_01: So how do I structure the entity that is going to hold all that money?
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_01: And it sounds easy, but if you're a large private equity firm, you have a sovereign
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_01: well fund that comes in and they say, we need to structure it in this way because of
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_01: tax implications.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_01: Then you have a pension fund that has these other requirements.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_01: And so it ends up being this incredibly complex process of how do you draft the limited
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_01: partnership agreement, which can be 100 pages every investor that's investing.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_01: You can have 100 and they all have side letters that modify that.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_01: And you need to understand if I modify it this way, it's going to have these implications.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of it is the project management that also goes around coordinating all of these
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_01: products if you're raising $1 billion fund.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_01: And then once you've created that fund, there's all the investments you do out of that fund.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: And so for example, when we did any of our series, you need to get a data room.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: We share a bunch of data.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_01: You look at that.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: You need to understand the contracts we have to make sure that the revenue we say we
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_01: have is actually structured in a way we've claimed.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_01: And are there litigation?
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_01: All these things.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: And so it's this massively complex process of understanding, and I think one analogy,
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_01: you can think of like understanding a code base, but the code base is all of these contracts
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_01: and all this legal work.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_01: And I think the reason legal is so difficult is the workflows aren't structured.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_01: So the same way with programming, it's really hard until these models to build tools for
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_01: programmers.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_01: You basically just had an ID and then programmers did stuff in all the different languages,
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_01: but you didn't have like, oh, here's a tool for Python, here's a tool for C++.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_01: Legal is kind of the same way.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_01: And so I think a lot of why you're seeing traction in programming and legal is I think
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_01: there's a lot of analogies of these workflows.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_01: They're so tech-heavy.
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_01: And the workflows until you have these models, you couldn't structure them in the way I think
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: you can now.
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_01: So one of the directions that people are going on the coding side is to build things that
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_02: are being called like agentic.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_02: And it's very early on in terms of what agentic means.
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_02: But basically being able to deconstruct a logic tree in terms of what are the set of actions
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_02: that you need to take in a certain situation.
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_02: And then having the AI agent go back and sort of check each one of those items, do it,
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_02: go on to the next item, double check it against the prior one.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_02: Do you do that from a legal perspective or is that something that's a little bit more
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_02: in the future relative to where code is today?
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're starting to do this now.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: And actually, like when I was at DeepMind, a lot of the RL research I did was that.
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_01: And so when we first got access to GP4, we had the very strong intuition of, okay, you're
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: going to be able to string a bunch of these model calls or eventually do things like reasoning
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_01: models where the full agent is differentiable.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_01: And even the first day we got access to GPD4, Winston went in his room for 14 hours and
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_01: just redid a bunch of his associate tasks.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_01: And when I looked at the work he was doing, it was essentially like this hacky agentic
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_01: where he said, okay, I would need to go look up this case loss, summarize it, take that
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_01: summary, use it to draft.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: And so seeing him do that gave us the intuition very early on of that's the direction this
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_01: is going.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_01: And you can kind of think of associates as agents.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_01: They get this task from a partner that's, hey, I have this high level case strategy.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_01: I want to see if I can find a bunch of case law that supports it.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_01: Can you go research that?
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: Look it up, cite it, write me a memo.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_01: And so a lot of the systems we're starting to build look a lot like that.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: And I think one interesting direction that the coding labs, the research labs are going
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: is building these RL environments where you deploy these agents and they can interact
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_01: with a code base and see if they can pass unit tests.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_01: And in legal that RL environment is a client matter.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: So you have all of the context of a fund formation, an acquisition, a litigation, and the
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_01: models are starting to learn.
[00:08:17] Let me go in the document management system and see if I can find this, go in the data
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_01: room or do case law research, get feedback from a partner.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_01: And so I think that research direction is super, super interesting.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_01: It's really interesting to make this a set of knowledge because I remember when I led
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_02: your guys as series B, which I think was maybe two years ago now, so a while ago,
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_02: I called a lot of your big customers and talked to the head of the law firm or talked
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_02: to the head of some of these institutions.
[00:08:43] And one of the things that I thought was really striking is number one, they were adopting
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_02: legal software, which before was really hard to sell into them.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_02: And because of what you were doing, being so striking and important, they were adopting
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_02: you really fast.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_02: The second is they weren't threatened by it.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_02: And I thought, oh, they'd be threatened because it may augment or eventually replace
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_02: certain aspects of law, etc., or help sort of change that dramatically.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_02: And one of the insights they kept bringing up that I thought was really interesting as
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_02: they said, as we think ahead as this sort of AI tooling and agentic workflow spread through
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_02: Harvey and companies like you, how do you think about the future of a law firm?
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_02: Because instead of hiring 100 associates of which you assume 10 will be partners eventually,
[00:09:22] maybe you only need 50, maybe only 20.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_02: And so are you even hiring enough people to know who'd be a great partner?
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_02: Because you're going to shrink this head of people that are needed to do certain tasks
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_02: over time.
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_02: Right now that isn't true.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_02: It's augmentation.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_02: It's expanding business.
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_02: But that could happen in the long run.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_02: How do you think about the future of law or what law firms will look like or the evolution
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_02: of all that?
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_02: There's a great question.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_01: I think it's changed a lot in the past couple years.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_01: I think something we are starting to talk with law firms a lot is how do we think of training
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_01: the future generation of partners where to your point, these law firms have these leverage
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_01: ratios where you have a lot of associates, but much less partners.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: And there is value to that because not everyone is going to become a partner.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_01: And part of going through that process is how you find, oh, this is the person that
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_01: I would trust to do this very complex acquisition because they've gone through that experience.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_01: And so I think the part I'm optimistic about is if I think about over 10 years ago when
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_01: I learned to program, it was super painful, right?
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_01: Like you had to go on Stack Overflow.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_01: It was hard to learn multiple languages because you're like, okay, I'm just going to
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_01: like learn Python.
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to learn TensorFlow.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: Or so it was just like hard to even learn that.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_01: It was hard to ask questions.
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_01: When I was at Google, you don't want to ask a bunch of questions because people would
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_01: be like, oh, you don't know that.
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_01: And I think it stuck all the time.
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_01: And now with the models, it's like programming is so fun to learn because you can just be
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_01: like, here's how to write this in Python, translate it, why is it written this way?
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_01: And you can learn this so much more quickly.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: And we see lawyers doing that with Harvey where they'll say generate this merger agreement,
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_01: why did we structure it that way?
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_01: And so we're ready starting to see some of that.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_01: But I think the really big opportunity for law firms is how do they take all of the internal
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_01: partner feedback and data that they've created and use that to start training?
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: I think that's one big piece.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_01: I think another conversation we're having is to your point, how do you just generally
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_01: start restructuring firms?
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_01: I think this is one where we have some intuitions, but a lot of it is going to depend on the
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_01: firm, the region, the size, their specialty, the types of clients they serve.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: I think one of the things that's very challenging with law firms is they are really a collection
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: of all these practice areas.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: And so the firms that specialize in litigation with different than the firms that specialize
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_01: in large transactions versus like mid-size transactions.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_01: And usually the big firms do a collection of these.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_01: And so a lot of what we're spending time is practice area by practice area.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_01: Can we go and sit with, here's the fund formation group and their private equity clients and
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_01: start thinking about what that would look like in terms of the workflows, the staffing,
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_01: the pricing.
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_01: And I think it is a really interesting problem where a lot of the value and the product
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: and the platform is not just the product itself, but how do we help enable these firms to
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_01: transform.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: And so when you think about it from that perspective, like our goal is how do we make these law firms
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_01: more profitable?
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_01: And it's not just a product problem.
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_01: It's thinking about their holistic business and where do we fit in in kind of that bigger
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: picture?
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's really interesting because when you look at the set of functions that a partner
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_02: fills, and I'm thinking in particular of consulting firms unless about law firms simply
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_02: because I'm a little bit more familiar with consultancies, some of it's the pattern recognition,
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_02: the high level thinking, the strategy.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_02: And then part of it is like the sales.
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_02: And really being able to make that client connection.
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_02: And so it's interesting to your point, think about more broadly, how can I augment all parts
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_02: of their business versus just the legal workflows?
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and to your point, I don't think that part changes where it's like when we think
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_01: of the like we're now larger consumers of legal services.
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_01: And when we think of the best partners we've worked with, I don't think the models are
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_01: doing what they do anytime soon.
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_01: And I think what's interesting is I think the role of law firm partners actually doesn't
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_01: change that much.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_01: In the same way, I don't think the role of very senior engineers changes with this because
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_01: you're largely delegating work.
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_01: And what you're getting paid to do is here's the high level strategy.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: Here's the right abstractions.
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_01: Go write the code or write the do the legal research to help me do it.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_01: And I will interface with the client.
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_01: And so I think that my guess is that doesn't change too much.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_01: But some of the like lower level functions do change because it was technology.
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_01: One of the things that you said that I thought was interesting, like in another conversation
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_00: that we were having was that there's an analogy that you could make between like a great
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_00: senior partner, like a Gordon Moody type.
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_00: And it's like a distinguished engineer working on systems at Google, right?
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_00: I think for a more technical audience or just general business audience that doesn't
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: really know what Gordon Moody does.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: They might assume what a law is that it just like isn't like 50% of that like his network
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_00: or his reputation.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_00: But you know what you were pointing out is like there's expertise in the ability to predict
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_00: like a sequence of arguments that is going to like get you to the answer you want or manage
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_00: risk.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_00: How does that translate to an RL environment or a task for you?
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there's a good question.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_01: So for maybe for background context for the audience, Gordon Moody was a partner at
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_01: walktale, which is one of the top transactional firms in the world that joined us really
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_01: on and is now an advisor.
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_01: And kind of the analogy I was giving is why is a senior distinguished distributed systems
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_01: engineer at Google so valuable?
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of it is the experience they have architecting these systems that none of this
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_01: is public.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_01: This won't go into the models for a long time.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_01: And so if you're building search at Google, these people can just point out, hey, if you
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_01: build a system this way at the scale, it's going to collapse for some reason that is
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_01: super not intuitive.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_01: And one of the examples that Gordon talked about early on was he was a part of when Michael
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_01: Dell took Dell private and then restructured it and took it public again.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_01: And this was like a multi year super complex financial and legal restructuring of an incredibly
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_01: large business.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_01: And what he when you talk with him is incredibly good at.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_01: It's the same feeling as when you talk with a very senior engineer where he can just he
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_01: has the whole picture of this legal entity in his head at the time they had to do the largest
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_01: debt offering of all time that to create that to invent a new financial instrument.
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_01: And so it's just understanding if I need to raise this much money to do this part of
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_01: the transaction.
[00:15:42] This is how I would structure it.
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_01: And so a lot of the value he brings is not just the relationship, but it's just that technical
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_01: understanding of how you architect these things the same way that how you architect like
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_01: very large software projects.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_01: And I think when that translates to an RL environment, part of what is missing from the
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: public models is the process of looking at one of these entities and figuring out given
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_01: all of the context of I want to do this merger.
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_01: This is the right way to structure it.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_01: Just that process and a lot of the reason in trace.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_00: Just like it would be in code.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_01: And if you looked at that data set for one of those transactions, it would be client comes
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_01: to Gordon says, I want to do this large merger acquisition.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_01: And then there would be meetings and emails talking about, okay, this is the background of
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_01: the two companies.
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_01: This is roughly how we would structure them.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_01: These are all the things we need to look into.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of the data would be Gordon giving these tasks to associates to say, okay, look
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_01: into these risk factors of similar transactions we've done.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_01: They would do research and say, okay, maybe we could structure it this way.
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_01: And then he would point out this really subtle thing that, hey, actually in this case, if
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_01: you structure it this way, this thing's going to happen.
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_00: But none of that shows up.
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_01: Like all you get from these public mergers is like an SEC filing.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_01: And so you do see the final result.
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_01: But most of the value or what you need, I think to eventually improve these models is
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_01: the decision making process, the same way you need these reasoning traces to train these
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_01: models to do kind of any of these reasoning tasks.
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_01: One of the, as you mentioned, like the labs are all very focused on RL scaling in like
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_00: coding in math domains.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_00: I think those are like highly verifiable, right?
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_00: Not perfectly so.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_00: But like how do you think about the appropriateness of like law for RL given it's not as easily
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_00: verifiable?
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_01: This is one of the biggest problems.
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_01: And I remember we had conversations early on when we were trying to figure out what is
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_01: the right evaluation structure.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_01: So I think the hardest thing about legal is most of these tasks are very long form text
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_01: generation.
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_01: And so there are definitely subsets of legal work that are super verifiable of going
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_01: in this data room and just find all the change of control provisions that you can kind
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_01: of build these traditional data sets.
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_01: But for something like generate this merger agreement, it's really hard to just give
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_01: some binary like this is good or this is bad.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_01: And I think this has been like a big research problem like with all the labs we work with
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_01: and also internally, there is just this open question of how do you build that reward
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_01: function?
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_01: And if you think of what that reward function is at the law firms, it's the partners,
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: right?
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_01: Okay, there is no way to verify this besides the senior partner who's done a bunch of
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_01: these said, yeah, this looks pretty good.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_01: And so internally, these law firms have a bunch of data of here's all the edits that went
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_01: into this and the feedback.
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_01: And so we are starting to think about how do you use that to train these reward functions?
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_01: But I would say that is one of the really big problems.
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_01: But I think one of the interesting things is I think you actually have the same problem
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_01: in programming where I think in the short term programming is verifiable where you can
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_01: look at unit tests.
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_01: But once you get into real software engineering, like the unit, there is no unit test.
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_01: It's like I deployed it.
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_01: It's like I deployed this and a million users used it for six months and it didn't crash.
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_01: And so you get and it's like mergers are the same where it's like you can make sure
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_01: the filing is correct.
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_01: But at the end of the day, it's like three years later, the companies are still merged
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_01: and they didn't take on litigation.
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_01: They didn't expect or something like that.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_01: And it's like that is eventually the really valuable human experience, right?
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_01: That's what you pay really good software engineers or really good lawyers where they have
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_01: that decade-long track record of they can build these systems and they haven't fallen
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_01: apart.
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of these stuff, the same way you can't unit test, it's like hard to verify.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_01: So it is, I think, this really interesting open research problem.
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_01: One thing that you guys are doing on sort of the other end from pushing the bounds of
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: what Harvey products and the models can do is like just get them deployed and you recently
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_00: started this for deployed engineering force.
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: This is confusing to me because I'm like, well, you're not necessarily like an application
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: building company, which is how people have traditionally thought of FDA.
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_00: Like why are you doing this?
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_00: I would say the model that we're operating under is not a full palantir.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_01: Let's go into the code base and kind of build custom software.
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_01: I would say this is closer to like Sierra's agent engineering program, but what we're starting
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_01: to run into a lot is I think early on we did a really good job of building a horizontal
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_01: platform.
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_01: We did not that much customization for customers in the sense of building specific things
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_01: for specific customers.
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_01: I think the thing that was nice about legal was we could build things like workflow builder
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_01: and things into the product that would let customers customize the product.
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_01: Then for very large customers like PWC, we did some customization.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_01: But now we're getting to the point where when we're starting to talk with law firms about,
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_01: hey, we want to take a bunch of this data and help you build a model or build agents.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_01: There is some amount of we need to go into your environment and figure out how to connect
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_01: all the data.
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_01: We're starting to connect to a lot of their like business systems, so they're billing systems,
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_01: governance systems.
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_01: Then especially when we start working with the Wal-Mart, the very large banks, the Fortune
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_01: 500, they're much less standardized than these law firms.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_01: There is just this massive amount of work where we go to a large bank and they say we don't
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_01: have any document management system for our legal department.
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_01: Can you just build us one?
[00:21:40] There is a massive amount of demand of we just want smart technical people to sit here
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_01: and help us think about our business and our operations and how we should start mapping
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_01: that into Genai systems.
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_01: For us, it's a really good way to figure out the roadmap where, for example, Glouall
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_01: is one of the fastest growing private equity firms that we recently started working with.
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_01: We meet with them all the time and there's all these things that we feel like we could
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_01: map into Genai.
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_01: We don't quite know what it's going to look like, but let's just sit together and figure
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_01: it out.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_01: I would say that's a lot of the genesis of the program of how do we just get more people
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_01: that can work with all these customers and start paving the way of some of these new
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_01: road maps in different verticals?
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_01: I think what you're describing too is a very standard enterprise playbook.
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_02: I think in Silicon Valley, people almost forgot because of the SaaS era that if you're
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_02: Oracle, if you're Dell, if you're IBM, if you're any of these larger organizations, this
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_02: is how you sell software.
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_02: You have a platform, you have a bunch of customization around it.
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_02: People have the spoke data sets.
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_02: They may not always have the ability internally or enough people to implement certain connectors
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_02: or systems.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_02: This is the standard way to do it.
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_02: As you do it over and over again, you start repeatedly turning that into part of the
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_02: platform.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_02: I think a lot of these started with doing something that resemble FD and then you get big enough
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_01: that you get this implementation ecosystem.
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_01: There's all these third parties that will come in and implement.
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_01: It'll be like the certified vendor.
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_02: I think the interesting thing we're actually starting to see is law firms are starting
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_01: to do this for their in-house clients.
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_01: They're starting to go and take Harvey and go to their clients and say, hey, buy Harvey
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_01: and we'll help you build all the workflows and implement it because we have the scale
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_01: and the expertise to build this.
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_01: We're typically these in-house teams.
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_01: The smaller ones don't have the budget or the in-house to build this.
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_01: I think there is a lot of that.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_01: That could be a good revenue driver for the law firms that you work with in terms of
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_02: a new business that they can offer.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_02: It's something we're starting to think about it that way.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_02: I was really struck by, I don't know if it was day zero, you can crack me, but it was
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_00: within the first year where the very first version of Harvey was really an individual
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: lawyer productivity tool.
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_00: I'm an associate or a senior personal law firm.
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: I want to get a piece of work done.
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_00: You just make it less painful.
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_00: But the transition quickly to how do we transform the business, make the business more profitable,
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_00: organize teams, being the ecosystem, I think happened pretty quickly.
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_00: Anything that is a business transformation just requires a lot of engagement.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_00: Given how much you guys have invested in customer success and how that's driven adoption,
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_00: I feel like a big piece of it is just how quickly AI has happened.
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_01: I would not necessarily have predicted that all the customers you're working with would
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_00: be like, yes, in year one and two of this company selling, we're adopting.
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_00: But part of it is you guys are helping them.
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_01: I think this was, when I look back, it was still surprising how quickly some of these
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_01: law firms adopted this.
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_01: Our first customer we actually met through you introduced to an ex partner who was doing
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_01: business school here and he introduced to David Wakeling at A&O.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_01: I was in our first year and they went from a small pilot to firm wide and investing in
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_01: this.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_01: I think you're seeing this in a couple of articles with cursor open evidence where this technology
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_01: is so transformative for these industries that are so techs heavy and knowledge based.
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_01: They just haven't had tools like this that I think early on we did find these customers
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: that were like, oh, this is worth really betting on.
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_01: But yeah, I think the pace has still been pretty surprising.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_01: I asked the internet through ex, what questions we should ask you.
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_00: A popular one was like, why aren't you guys building a law firm?
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_00: Are you going to build a law firm and compete with all your customers?
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_01: We get this question.
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: I think when we first started Harvey and we were doing research, we actually talked to
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_01: 30 people from Atrium.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_01: I think also interestingly Sam and Jason who was the GC of OpenA at the time and was the
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_01: GC at Y Combinator when they did the Atrium investment.
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_01: What struck us was the people who worked there said it was a really good idea and they
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_01: were super excited about the prospects and then there were some challenges around the
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_01: legal and the execution.
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_01: But when we dug more into it, the big challenge that they ran into was you're essentially
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_01: just building two different companies, right?
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_01: You're building a law firm and you're building a tech company.
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_01: It's already really hard to build product engineering, do AI, scale sales.
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_01: I think the big issue you run into if you try to do both of these is I think you can only
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_01: do one thing well and doing a law firm well is very different than building a software company
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_01: well.
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_01: I think that's one point.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_01: The bigger point is for us, it feels like the best outcome is if we can figure out how
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: do we make every law firm?
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_01: How do we help every law firm become an AI first law firm?
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_01: Not how do we build one ourselves?
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_01: I think the real problem we're trying to solve is can we make every law firm more profitable?
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_01: Part of that is how they work with their clients and can you make their clients get better
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_01: faster, cheaper legal services?
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_01: I think solving that equation at scale is a much bigger opportunity than if you build a
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_01: single law firm because you get conflicted out, you can't scale this.
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_01: I think this is probably something we don't do, but we've gone this question.
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_01: I think it's not the focus for the company.
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_00: analogous to other markets in software, law feels like an area where I've been very
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_00: surprised personally about how large the scope of the problem is eventually if you're really
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_00: ambitious about what you can do.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_00: I didn't realize you were telling me if you do a really large eminion, let's say,
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_00: like two global companies, Microsoft Activision or something.
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_00: There's a hundred outside council firms here.
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_00: Because in New Zealand, where both companies have customers, you have a tax implication.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_00: The dude who understands that lives in New Zealand.
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's crazy.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_01: I think like other markets, the SMB version of this looks really different from the high
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_00: end enterprise version of this.
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_00: I do think it's hard to imagine coalescing all of that expertise in a law firm in a software
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_00: company at the same time versus I'm like, well, Harvey now has like what, 40 customers
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_00: in New Zealand or...
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_01: If you think about those transactions, it's also not just law firms.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_01: There's investment banks and you maybe have PWC or a tax advisor.
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_01: There could be an HR consultancy that helps you think about how you're merging headcount.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_01: For us, the bigger opportunity seems how do we build the platform that lets professional
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_01: service providers and their clients collaborate?
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of the problems you need to solve there are...
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_01: The biggest is the secure collaboration across many of these entities, the secure data sharing.
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_01: How do you build into play AI systems across these very complex projects?
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_01: And I think to your point, the scope of this, like legal is a trillion professional services
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_01: is something like three to five trillion.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_01: There's just this massive amount of room to grow.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_01: And we think our expertise is going to be in building the product, the technical systems,
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_01: the AI systems that enable that.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_01: And we want to give that infrastructure to all of the different law firms rather than
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_01: compete with them because I just don't think you can.
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_01: I think one thing that's really striking about this sort of waiver era of AI is that there's
[00:29:31] deeply technical people building giant companies in really different industries.
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_02: And you come from a research background.
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_02: You worked at one of the major labs in terms of foundation models and other areas, RL
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_02: environments, reinforcement learning.
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_02: What has been your biggest surprise in terms of transitioning into being a founder and
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_02: running a company and building something from the ground up like that?
[00:29:52] They may be not surprised, but the biggest mental model shift is, I think the 10 years
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_01: before Harvey, I was doing a mix of mainly AI research and then trying to start companies,
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_01: but always largely as an IC.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_01: And I think the shift from this started working and scaling, just how much I had to change
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_01: my mental model of the type of company we're building, how you do this at scale, how you operate.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_01: I think that was the biggest surprise or like thing that I've had to change.
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_01: But it's been a crazy experience kind of going from Winston and I in an Airbnb to 500
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_01: people in like three and a half years.
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_01: And I think also how you build these products at scale and kind of the complexity of this
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: industry, like that has been like a really hard but interesting experience.
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_02: That's been amazing to see what you all have accomplished.
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_02: It's such a short period of time.
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_02: I was thinking back to like when we pitched to both of you guys like three and a half years
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_01: ago and we're like, hey, AI, I put it for legal.
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_01: You guys really sounds good.
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: But I mean, we had some of these ideas, but I think they've really like, I think a really
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_01: important aspect of that too is you all started this company before GPT-4 came out and
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_02: before a lot of the shifts in the models happened.
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_02: And so I remember are you showing side by side GPT-3.5 versus four and what you were doing
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_02: worked on for but not on 3.5.
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_02: And you were part of that very early wave that had conviction this was so important as
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_02: a trend.
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_02: Was that because of your experience in the labs?
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_02: Was it something else?
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_02: I drove you because not many people were actually starting AI companies when you all got started.
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_02: And it was kind of just to your point AI plus legal like no one was doing that.
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:33] SPEAKER_01: It's something where now everyone's like, oh, this is such an obvious idea but at the time.
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:45] Yeah.
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_01: You saw GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3.
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_01: If you were working in AI for the past 10 years, kind of one of the big problems where how do
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_01: you pull all this together because you built systems where, okay, this is really good at vision.
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_01: This is really good at like specific things but no one really had the like general solution.
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_01: And you saw things like Lambda.
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_01: And I think with that trend, like what I'd seen is anytime you kind of make that initial,
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: okay, this is how you do it.
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_01: You can usually just scale and the stuff keeps working.
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_01: And so with 3.5, you were like, this is getting really interesting but it's not quite
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_01: there.
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_01: And so the bet was, okay, open AI maybe one of the people to crack it.
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_01: Like I know a lot of the people there.
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_01: That was part.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_01: And then I think the other big part was just Winston was a lawyer and I think we had
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_01: become super close.
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_01: Never thought we'd started company together but just the way I heard him talk about the
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_01: legal industry.
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_01: Like he, even though he was a first year associate, just had this intuition of not just the
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: work he was doing but the structure of the firm.
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_01: Like I would hear him talk about the firm and be like, here's what all the different
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_01: partners are doing.
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_01: Here's like why our firm strategy is this way.
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_01: He had, he was in the process of convincing some partners to leave to start a law firm
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_01: with him, which is insane for like.
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_01: And so it was just like, okay, this will be really fun.
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_01: He showed me a bunch of his legal tech.
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_01: It was like, this seems like the perfect application.
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_01: And then when we saw GBD4, it was just like, oh, the time is now.
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_01: This is the perfect application.
[00:33:28] I think it is like really noteworthy where I was actually like, you know, even six months
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_00: into working with you guys, being like, well, our capable is really going to advance
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_00: that quickly and both you and Winston were like, absolutely.
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: We should have the ambition to take on the full complexity of like any type of legal
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_00: work that's possible because the models will keep getting better.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_00: And so like, that seems like a, like a super obvious mainstream point of view today.
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_00: But in, I don't know, the middle of 2022, I think it was like a, it was a strong unique
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_00: intuition to have.
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:34:07] Yeah.
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_01: I think that was something we did really well where we just had this belief where I think
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_01: the same that you see with the programming products where if you had built something
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_01: where it's like, all this does is like check that your Python code doesn't have bugs,
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_01: which you could have done better with 3.5.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_01: Like you wouldn't have built something like cursor.
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_01: And the intuition was just these models can help you do any programming task and any programming
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: language.
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_01: And I think we felt that same way in legal.
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_01: And I had a bit of intuition.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_01: I did like a bit of investment banking private equity.
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_01: And it was the same workflows where you could just do any of them with these models.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_01: And so I think keeping the product open ended enough that it gave us the room that now we
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_01: can build into all these things and like professional other professional services.
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_01: I think that was super important.
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_01: So it's a really interesting analogy because for code, it took an extra two years, I think,
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_02: for the main coding companies to really emerge is the ones that are likely to win.
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_02: I think 3.5 years ago, and you had a product almost immediately and you were up and running
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_02: really fast.
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_02: And then I think cursor didn't really launch its ID until 24 months ago.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_02: So I'm like, that's on.
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_02: And then cognition was slightly in that era and then obviously cloud code.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_02: Six months later.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_00: So everything kind of came kind of in a time delayed way for code, even though GitHub
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_02: Copilot was one of the first products and everybody knew that I was really important.
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_02: And now I think that's really interesting because there were so many coding companies that
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_02: got started under the premise.
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_02: But somehow as these ones that start a little bit later, they're really the ones who took
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_02: off.
[00:35:38] SPEAKER_02: And so I was wonder why is that?
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_02: You know, what caused them?
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_00: Well, my guess is part of my intuition here was just you guys were like, let's say like
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_00: very AGI's less Chinese word now, but very capability-pilled from the beginning.
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:35:53] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:35:54] So both you, Winston and you as a shred of an investment banker turned AI researcher,
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_00: were both like, it's going to be able to do so much.
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_00: I think people were, I think people were a little less ambitious like three years ago,
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_00: at least some people are going to go and build on models and you know, actually feel like
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_00: people are very ambitious.
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_02: I just think that maybe you folks immediately focused on product.
[00:36:16] And that was part of the difference.
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_01: I think it was finding the right form factor.
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_01: I think in legal, it was maybe a bit more obvious where the initial form factor was essentially
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_01: like like the initial feature we built that none of the products had at the time was
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_01: upload a document and do something with it, right?
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_01: And that is a lot of legal tasks.
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_01: And it was that and then do really accurate citations.
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_01: And when you showed people that, they were like, oh, this is crazy because that's so much
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_01: of my job.
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_01: I think with coding, the initial models were also not quite as good that you needed maybe
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_01: a bit more capabilities of the base models.
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_01: And then you needed, I think figuring out the right way to like integrate this into
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_01: the, into the idea.
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_01: I remember where it's like the first version of the product that I built.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_01: It was mainly like I used GP-D4 because like most of my background was like distributed
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_01: systems and AI research.
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_01: And I was, I still don't know React.
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_01: I was just like, yeah, JavaScript, kind of like putting this together.
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_01: But I was like, hey, GP-D4, like help me make this.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_01: And like, you could kind of already see it at the time with programming.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: And that was part of what gave me the like intuition that I could analogize to like
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_01: what Winston was doing.
[00:37:24] But you mentioned that you folks have gone from basically the two founders to 500 people
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_02: over the last three and a half years or so.
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_02: You're obviously growing really quickly.
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_02: The business is working.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_02: You know, you have tons of customer demand.
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_02: What are you hiring for?
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_02: What are you looking for in terms of the next set of employees or what types of roles
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_02: are you're hiring for right now?
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_01: On the on the technical side, so we mentioned FTEs.
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_01: I think looking in general like across rules of just strong engineers.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_01: And then I would say maybe specific call outs.
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_01: We just hired a site lead for New York, so starting to scale up that office.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_01: More folks on kind of front end and scaling product in general.
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_01: And then more AI folks as well.
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_01: So yeah, anyone strong engineer, like please apply.
[00:38:08] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_00: Last question for you.
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_01: How many pull ups can you do?
[00:38:12] We did find out.
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know if that was the max, but these guys can both do 15 pull ups guys.
[00:38:18] We'll wink in the middle.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:38:23] Okay.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_02: Guys, we get it.
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_02: You mean in what set?
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_00: In one set.
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_00: In one set.
[00:38:28] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_02: We're going to do the 24 hour challenge.
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_02: Oh, what's that?
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_02: How many can you do today?
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_02: Now.
[00:38:34] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_00: It's a lot.
[00:38:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to upload to your tick talk.
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_00: I'll screen it on the no-triors tick talk.
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_00: Does Elon have tick talk?
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_02: I don't have a tick talk.
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_02: Do you know what tick talk is very good for?
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_02: Erwan videos.
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's good.
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_02: That's really good.
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_00: Like, speaking of Erwan or like people like, like, there's one where it's um, the Miami
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_02: girl visits Erwan.
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_02: Oh, my God.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_00: She's like, Eris, Juan.
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_02: Are you Juan?
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_02: So it's very good.
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_02: I highly recommend.
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_02: I know.
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_02: I know.
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_02: Thanks for that.
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_02: That in Twitter, I feel like around my time goes.
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_02: Just tick talk Erwan videos.
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:39:10] You can pick.
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_00: We'll pick one of these two.
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_00: I asked some other people involved in the company.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_00: You're good.
[00:39:14] SPEAKER_00: What question should I ask?
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_00: Game.
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_00: Oh, boy.
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_00: I think one of them was like, why do you still sleep on an air mattress?
[00:39:21] Okay.
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_01: So I don't sleep on an air mattress.
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_01: I have a good mattress.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_01: I don't have a bed frame.
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_01: He's where that's coming from.
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: And so what happened is when we moved from LA to SF, my bed frame broke.
[00:39:36] And then the first year and a half of the startup things were so crazy.
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_01: I was like, this is what a startup founder should do.
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_01: And at some point, I was like, I need to get a bed frame.
[00:39:45] And I ordered one.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_01: And it came.
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_01: And I got a call from the apartment and they were like, hey, you didn't sign out.
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_01: You didn't fill out the insurance, like the rent, the mover's insurance.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_01: So we can't let them bring this up.
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, okay, I called them.
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_01: I was like, hey, do you guys have renters insurance?
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_01: They're like, where are you?
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_01: PS.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_01: We don't, they're just like, we don't do that.
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_01: And then I was just like, I don't have time to deal with it.
[00:40:08] SPEAKER_01: And I have a dollar.
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_01: I just like that.
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_01: It's like we have other bombs to solve.
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_00: We don't do anything except the company right now.
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_00: And pull ups.
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:40:20] Other question was, you know, there's a bunch of foresight in starting Harvey when you guys
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_00: did, when you look forward, do you have a prediction that you think others don't necessarily
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_00: agree with you right now?
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_00: That's not mainstream.
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_00: So one comment I'll definitely make on the foresight is I think a lot of like we've
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_01: done comments of like, oh, overnight success.
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_01: And oh, you saw this coming.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_01: And I would say, actually just spent the decade before Harvey trying to start a company
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_01: like Harvey.
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_01: So I think it was just, I was super early.
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_01: And then eventually it was like, oh, now is the right time.
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_01: And then you were kind of in the right position.
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_01: My guess is, I think people now are catching up to how capability-pilled, as you called it,
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_01: like Winston and I were, I think people in Silicon Valley, I think people have a good sense
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_01: of where these models are going.
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_01: But I think generally people don't appreciate how much better they're going to continue
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_01: getting.
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's really, it's really, it's really weird.
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_01: And I build things and I'm like, oh, my God, code gen works.
[00:41:18] SPEAKER_00: It just really works now.
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_01: It's crazy.
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_01: And to me, it's like, I think the interesting thing will be the transition from like these
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_01: models are really smart individually.
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_01: But if you think about like a lot of what we've done in the past 20 years with SaaS, it's
[00:41:31] SPEAKER_01: how do we use software to make these massive organizations?
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_01: And I think that will be the continued trend where a lot of what we're starting to think
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_01: about is like law firms have like 10x in size compared to before computers and the internet.
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's going to happen again, but in like maybe a different way than the
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_01: past 20 years.
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_01: But I think that to me, like a lot of people still talk about co-pilots and individual productivity.
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of the things we're starting to think about is like organizational productivity
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_01: and like how do you build these systems at scale where both for our internal engineering
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_01: team?
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_01: Like I think a really interesting question for the, for the cursors, the codex is like
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_01: making someone program 20% faster doesn't make you build a product 20% faster.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_01: And so starting to think about like what is the broader infrastructure you need so these
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_01: companies can develop software and product faster and then kind of same analogy to legal.
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_01: I think that's kind of one of the things we're thinking about that I maybe don't hear
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_01: people talk about as much.
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_02: Kind of collaborative AI in some sense.
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_02: Sort of like the Figma transition of your individual contributor designer versus working
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_02: collaboratively with the design team.
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_02: And what you're talking about is doing that for law, doing that for code, doing that for
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_02: different verticals and having AI as a lay around top of that.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_02: So it's super interesting.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:42:50] SPEAKER_01: And I think to that point, it's like how do how are humans and AI is going to work super
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_01: effectively?
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_01: Because even at these large companies, you have huge teams of different specialized people
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_01: that have different functions.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_01: And I think when I hear a lot of people talk about these models, they kind of talk about
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_01: as like, oh, AI will just get smart and do all of this.
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_01: And I don't think that's the way this evolves the same way.

[00:43:27] SPEAKER_02: Brinco that yeah, help get up and running where a lot of the AI implementation issues are
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_02: around.
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_02: And then people management workflow optimization.
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_02: It's my thoughts about can you build the AI and much more?
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_02: How do you actually choose the organization to be able to adopt it properly?
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_02: So yeah, we're starting to work with a lot of private equity firms that I think it's
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_01: interesting like starting to see how they're thinking about that.
