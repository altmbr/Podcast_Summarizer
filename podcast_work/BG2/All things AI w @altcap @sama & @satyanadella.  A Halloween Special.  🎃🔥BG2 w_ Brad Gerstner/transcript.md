[00:00:00] I think this has really been an amazing partnership through every phase.
[00:00:03] Sam Altman: We had no idea where I was going to go when we started, as Satya said.
[00:00:08] Sam Altman: But I don't think this is one of the great tech partnerships ever.
[00:00:13] Sam Altman: And certainly without Microsoft and particularly
[00:00:16] Sam Altman: Sauts' early conviction, we would not have been able to do that.
[00:00:31] What a week, what a week.
[00:00:33] Brad Gerstner: Great to see you both.
[00:00:35] Brad Gerstner: Sam, how's the baby?
[00:00:37] Baby is great.
[00:00:39] That's the best thing I've ever.
[00:00:40] Sam Altman: Every cliche is true and it is the best thing ever.
[00:00:43] Hey Satya, with all your time.
[00:00:45] Sam Altman: And the smile on Sam's face when he talks about, it's just his baby.
[00:00:49] Satya Nadella: It's just so different.
[00:00:51] I got it and compute.
[00:00:53] Satya Nadella: I guess when he talks about computing his baby.
[00:00:58] Brad Gerstner: Well, Satya, have you given any dad tips with all this time you guys have spent together?
[00:01:02] Satya Nadella: I said just enjoy it.
[00:01:03] Satya Nadella: I mean, it's so awesome that you know, we had our babies or what our children are so young.
[00:01:09] Satya Nadella: And I wish I could redo it.
[00:01:11] Satya Nadella: So in some sense, it's just the most precious time.
[00:01:14] Satya Nadella: And as they grow, it's just so wonderful.
[00:01:16] Satya Nadella: I'm so glad to see him is.
[00:01:18] Satya Nadella: I'm happy I'm doing it older, but I do think sometimes man, I wish I had the energy of when I was like 25.
[00:01:23] Sam Altman: That parts harder.
[00:01:25] No, not about it.
[00:01:26] Brad Gerstner: What's the average age at Open AI Sam?
[00:01:28] Brad Gerstner: Any idea?
[00:01:29] Brad Gerstner: It's young.
[00:01:30] It's not crazy young.
[00:01:31] Brad Gerstner: Not like not like most Silicon Valley startups.
[00:01:34] Sam Altman: I don't know, maybe low 30s average.
[00:01:36] Brad Gerstner: Are babies trending positively or negatively?
[00:01:39] Brad Gerstner: Babies trending positively.
[00:01:40] Brad Gerstner: Oh, that's good.
[00:01:41] Brad Gerstner: That's good.
[00:01:42] Brad Gerstner: Yeah.
[00:01:43] Brad Gerstner: Well, you guys such a big week.
[00:01:44] Brad Gerstner: You know, I was thinking about I started at Nvidia's GTC, you know, just hit five trillion dollars.
[00:01:50] Brad Gerstner: Google, Meta, Microsoft, Sacha, do you had your any just today?
[00:01:53] Brad Gerstner: You know, and we heard consistently not enough compute, not enough compute, not enough compute.
[00:01:58] Brad Gerstner: We got rate cuts on Wednesday, the GDP is tracking near 4%.
[00:02:02] Brad Gerstner: And then I was just saying to Sam, you know, the presidents cut these massive deals in Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, sounds like with China.
[00:02:10] Brad Gerstner: You know, deals that really incredibly provide the financial firepower to reindustrialize America.
[00:02:15] Brad Gerstner: 80 billion for new nuclear vision, all the things that you guys need to build more compute.
[00:02:21] Brad Gerstner: But certainly wasn't, what wasn't lost in all of this was you guys had a big announcement on Tuesday that clarified your partnership.
[00:02:28] Brad Gerstner: Congrats on that.
[00:02:29] And I thought we'd just start there.
[00:02:31] Brad Gerstner: I really want to just break down the deal in really simple plain language to make sure I understand it and others.
[00:02:37] Brad Gerstner: But, you know, we'll just start with your investment, Sacha.
[00:02:41] Brad Gerstner: You know, Microsoft started investing in 2019 is investing the ballpark at $1314 billion into open AI.
[00:02:49] Brad Gerstner: And for that, you get 27% of the business ownership in the business on a fully diluted basis.
[00:02:55] Brad Gerstner: I think it was about a third and you took some dilution over the course of last year with all the investment.
[00:03:00] Brad Gerstner: So does that sound about right terms of ownership?
[00:03:04] Yeah, it does.
[00:03:05] Satya Nadella: But I would say before even our stake in it, Brad, I think what's pretty unique about open AI is the fact that as part of open AI's process of restructuring one of the largest non-profit data.
[00:03:18] Satya Nadella: And the biggest non-profit gets created.
[00:03:20] Satya Nadella: I mean, let's not forget that in some sense, I say at Microsoft, we are very proud of the fact that we were associated with the two of the largest non-profit, the Gates Foundation and now the Open AI Foundation.
[00:03:31] Satya Nadella: So that's, I think, the big news.
[00:03:33] Satya Nadella: We obviously were thrilled.
[00:03:36] Satya Nadella: It's not what we thought.
[00:03:37] Satya Nadella: And as I said to somebody, it's not like when we first invested our billion dollars, that this is going to be the 100-bagger that I'm going to be talking about to VCs about.
[00:03:46] Satya Nadella: There we are, but we are very thrilled to be an investor and an early backer.
[00:03:52] Satya Nadella: And it's great.
[00:03:53] Satya Nadella: And it's really a testament to what Sam and team have done quite frankly.
[00:03:56] Satya Nadella: I mean, they obviously had the vision early about what this technology could do and they ran with it and just executed in a masterful way.
[00:04:05] I think this is really an amazing partnership through everything.
[00:04:09] Sam Altman: We had kind of no idea where I was looking to go when we started, as Satya said, but I don't think I think this is one of the great tech partnerships ever and without, certainly without Microsoft, in particularly, SOTUS, early conviction.
[00:04:23] Sam Altman: We would not have been able to do this.
[00:04:25] Sam Altman: I don't think there were a lot of other people that would have been willing to take that kind of a bet given what the world looked like at the time.
[00:04:32] Sam Altman: We didn't know exactly how the tech was going to go.
[00:04:35] Sam Altman: Well, not exactly.
[00:04:36] Sam Altman: We didn't know at all how the tech was going to go.
[00:04:37] Sam Altman: We just had a lot of conviction in this one idea of pushing on deep learning and trusting that if we could do that, we'd figure out ways to make wonderful products and create a lot of value.
[00:04:46] Sam Altman: And also, as Satya said, create what we believe will be the largest nonprofit ever.
[00:04:51] Sam Altman: And I think it's going to do amazingly great things.
[00:04:54] Sam Altman: It was, I really like this structure because it lets the nonprofit grow in value while the PBC is able to get the capital that it needs to keep scaling.
[00:05:04] Sam Altman: I don't think the nonprofit would be able to be this valuable if we didn't come up with the structure, if we didn't have partners around the table that we're excited for it to work this way.
[00:05:11] Sam Altman: But, you know, I think it's been six, more than six years since we first started this partnership.
[00:05:17] Sam Altman: And the pretty crazy amount of achievement for six years.
[00:05:20] Sam Altman: And I think much, much more to come.
[00:05:22] Sam Altman: I hope that Satya makes a trillion dollars on the investment, not a hundred billion.
[00:05:25] Sam Altman: You know, what it is.
[00:05:26] Well, as part of the restructuring, you guys talked about it.
[00:05:29] Brad Gerstner: You have this nonprofit on top and a public benefit court below.
[00:05:32] Brad Gerstner: It's pretty insane.
[00:05:33] Brad Gerstner: The nonprofit is already capitalized with $130 billion, $130 billion of open AI stock.
[00:05:41] Brad Gerstner: It's one of the largest in the world out of the gates.
[00:05:44] Brad Gerstner: It could end up being much, much larger.
[00:05:46] Brad Gerstner: The California Attorney General said they're not going to object to it.
[00:05:49] Brad Gerstner: You already have a hundred, there's 130 billion dedicated to making sure that AGI benefits all of humanity.
[00:05:55] Brad Gerstner: You announced that you're going to direct the first 25 billion to health and AI security and resilience, Sam.
[00:06:02] Brad Gerstner: First, let me just say, you know, as somebody who participates in the ecosystem, kudos to you both.
[00:06:07] Brad Gerstner: It's incredible.
[00:06:08] Brad Gerstner: This contribution to the future of AI.
[00:06:10] Brad Gerstner: But Sam, talk to us a bit about the importance of the choice around health and resilience.
[00:06:17] Brad Gerstner: And then help us understand how do we make sure that you get maximal benefit without it getting weighted down as we've seen with so many nonprofits with its own political biases?
[00:06:28] Brad Gerstner: Yeah.
[00:06:29] First of all, the best way to create a bunch of value for the world is hopefully what we're we've already been doing, which is to make these amazing tools and just let people use them.
[00:06:39] Sam Altman: And I think capitalism is great. I think companies are great.
[00:06:42] Sam Altman: I think people are doing amazing work getting advanced AI into the hands of a lot of people and companies that are doing incredible things.
[00:06:48] Sam Altman: There are some areas where the, I think, market forces don't quite work for what's in the best interest of people and you do need to do things in a different way.
[00:06:59] Sam Altman: There are also some new things with this technology that just haven't existed before, like the potential to use AI to do science at a rapid clip, like really truly automated discovery.
[00:07:09] Sam Altman: And when we thought about the areas we wanted to first focus on, clearly if we can cure a lot of disease and make the data and information for that broadly available, that would have a wonderful thing to do for the world.
[00:07:21] Sam Altman: And then on this point of AI resilience, I do think some things may get a little strange and they won't all be addressed by companies doing their thing.
[00:07:30] Sam Altman: So as the world has to navigate through this transition, if we can fund some work to help with that, and that could be cyber defense, that could be AI safety research, that could be economic studies, all of these things, helping society through this transition smoothly.
[00:07:44] Sam Altman: We're very confident about how great it can be on the other side, but I'm sure there will be some choppyness along the way.
[00:07:50] Sam Altman: Let's keep us through the deal. So models and exclusivity, Sam, open AI can distribute its models, it's leading models on Azure, but I don't think you can distribute them on any other leading the big clouds for seven years until 2032.
[00:08:06] Brad Gerstner: But that would end earlier if AGI is verified, we can come back to that, but you can distribute your open source models, Sora agents, codecs, wearables, everything else on other platforms.
[00:08:17] Brad Gerstner: So Sam, I assume this means no chat GPT or GPT 6 on Amazon or Google.
[00:08:23] Brad Gerstner: So we have a cat, first of all, we want to do lots of things together to help create value for Microsoft, we want them to do lots of things to create value for us, and there are many, many things that will happen in that category.
[00:08:34] Sam Altman: We are keeping what Satya termed once, and I think it's a great phrase of stateless APIs on Azure exclusively through 2030, and everything else we're going to distribute elsewhere, and that's obviously in Microsoft's interest too.
[00:08:46] Sam Altman: So we'll put lots of products, lots of places, and then this thing we'll do on Azure and people can get it there or be awesome.
[00:08:52] Sam Altman: I think that's great.
[00:08:53] Brad Gerstner: And then the rev share, there's still a rev share that gets paid by open AI to Microsoft on all your revenues that also runs until 2032, more until AGI is verified.
[00:09:02] Brad Gerstner: So let's just assume for the sake of argument, I know this is pedestrian, but it's important that the rev share is 15%.
[00:09:08] Brad Gerstner: So that would mean if you had 20 billion in revenue that you're paying 3 billion to Microsoft, and that counts as revenue to Azure, such as that, does that sound about right?
[00:09:18] Brad Gerstner: Yeah, we have a rev share, and I think as you characterized it, we're either going to AGI or till the end of the thumb, and I actually don't know exactly where we counted quite honestly, whether it goes into Azure or something else.
[00:09:29] Satya Nadella: That's a good question. It's a good question for Amy.
[00:09:32] Satya Nadella: Given that both exclusivity and the rev share end early in the case, AGI is verified, it seems to make AGI a pretty big deal.
[00:09:41] Brad Gerstner: And as I understand it, you know, if, if open AI claimed AGI, it sounds like it goes to an expert panel, and you guys basically selected jury, who's got to make a relatively quick decision, whether or not AGI has been reached, such as you said on yesterday's earning call that nobody's even close to getting AGI, and you don't expect it to happen anytime soon.
[00:09:59] Brad Gerstner: You talked about this spiky and jagged intelligence Sam, I've heard you perhaps sound a little bit more bullish on, you know, when we might get to AGI.
[00:10:08] Brad Gerstner: So I guess the question is to you both, do you worry that over the next two or three years, we're going to end up having to call in the jury to effectively make a call on whether or not we've hit AGI.
[00:10:19] Brad Gerstner: I realize you've got to try to make some drama between us here.
[00:10:24] You know, I think putting a process in place for this is a good thing to do.
[00:10:29] Sam Altman: I expect that the technology will take several surprising twists and turns, and we will continue to be good partners to each other and figure out what's.
[00:10:39] Well said I think and that's one of the reasons why I think this process we put in place is a good one and at the end of the day i'm a big believer in the fact that intelligence capability wise is going to continue to improve and our real goal, where frankly is that, which is how do you put that in the hands of people and organizations so that they can get the maximum benefits and that was the original mission of open AI that attracted me to open AI and Sam and team and that's kind of what we plan to continue on.
[00:11:08] Brad to say the obvious if we had super intelligence tomorrow we would still want microsoft's help getting this product out into people's hands and we want them like yeah.
[00:11:16] Sam Altman: Of course of course yeah no again i'm asking the questions i know that around people's minds and that makes a ton of sense to me obviously side microsoft is one of the largest distribution platforms in the world you guys have been great partners for a long time, but i think it dispels some of the myths that are out there but let's shift gears a little bit you know obviously open a eyes one of the fastest growing companies in history.
[00:11:37] Brad Gerstner: Such as you said on the pod a year ago this pod that every news phase shift created a new Google and the Google of this phase shift is already known and it's open AI and none of this would have been possible had you guys not made these huge bets with all that said you know open a eyes revenues are still reported 13 billion dollars in 2025 and Sam on your livestream this week you talked about this massive commitment to compute right one point for you.
[00:12:06] Brad Gerstner: Right one point for trillion over the next four or five years with you know big commitments 500 million to Nvidia 300 million to AMD and Oracle 250 billion to Azure so i think the single biggest question i've heard all week and and hanging over the market.
[00:12:23] Brad Gerstner: Is how you know how can the company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments you know and and you've heard the criticism Sam we're doing well more revenue that.
[00:12:35] Sam Altman: Second of all Brad if you want to sell your shares i'll find you a buyer.
[00:12:41] I just enough like you know people are.
[00:12:44] Sam Altman: I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy open AI shares I don't I don't think you.
[00:12:48] Sam Altman: Including myself.
[00:12:51] Brad Gerstner: Talk with a lot of like breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares so I think we we could sell you know your shares or anybody else is to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter whatever about this very quickly.
[00:13:04] Sam Altman: We do plan for revenue to grow steeply revenue is growing steeply we are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow and that not only will try to be keep growing but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds that our consumer device business will be.
[00:13:21] Sam Altman: A significant important thing that AI that can audit made science will create huge value so.
[00:13:28] Sam Altman: You know there are not many times that I want to be a public company but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open a eyes about to go out of business and you know whatever I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that.
[00:13:44] But you know I we carefully plan we understand where the technology where the capability is going to.
[00:13:52] Sam Altman: Grow go and how the products we can build around that in the revenue we can generate we might screw it up like this is the bet that we're.
[00:13:59] Sam Altman: Making we're taking a risk along with that a certain risk is if we don't have the compute we will not be able to generate the revenue or make the models at these at this kind of scale.
[00:14:08] Sam Altman: Exactly and let me just say one thing Brad as both a partner and an investor there is not be the single business plan that I've seen from open AI that they're put in and not beaten it.
[00:14:23] Satya Nadella: So in some sense this is the one place where you know in terms of their growth and just even the business it's been unbelievable execution quite frankly I mean obviously open AI everyone talks about all the success in the usage and what have you.
[00:14:37] Satya Nadella: But even I would say all up the business execution is being just pretty unbelievable I heard Greg Brockman say on CNBC a couple of weeks ago right if we could 10X our compute we might not have 10X more revenue but we'd certainly have a lot more revenue.
[00:14:53] Brad Gerstner: Simply because of lack of compute power things like yeah it's just it's really wild when I just look at how much we are held back and in many ways we have you know we've scaled our compute probably 10X over the past year.
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_02: But if we had 10X more compute I don't know if we'd have 10X more revenue but I don't think of you that far.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_02: And we heard this from you as well last night Sasha that you were compute constrained and growth would have been higher even if you add more compute.
[00:15:20] Brad Gerstner: So help us contextualize Sam maybe like how compute constrained do you feel today and do you when you look at the build out over the course of the next two to three years do you think you'll ever get to the point where you're not compute constrained.
[00:15:33] Brad Gerstner: We talk about this question of is there ever enough compute a lot I think the answer is the only the best way to think about this is like a.
[00:15:44] Sam Altman: Energy or something you can talk about demand for energy at a certain price point but you can't talk about demand for energy without talking about.
[00:15:53] Sam Altman: At different you know different demand at different price levels if the price of compute per like unit of intelligence or whatever you want to think about it fell by a factor of 100 tomorrow you would see usage go up by much more than 100 and there'd be a lot of things that people would love to do with that compute that just make no economic sense at the current cost but there would be new kind of demand so I think the the.
[00:16:19] Now on the other hand is the models get even smarter and you can use these models to cure cancer discover novel physics or drive a bunch of human robots to construct a space station or whatever crazy thing you want.
[00:16:30] Sam Altman: Then maybe there's huge willingness to pay a much higher rate cost per unit of intelligence for a much higher level of intelligence that we don't know yet but I would bet there will be so I think when you talk about capacity it's it's like a.
[00:16:45] Sam Altman: You know cost per unit and you know capability per unit and you have to kind of without those curves it's sort of made up now it's it's not a super well specified problem yeah I mean I think the one thing that you know Sam you've talked about which I think is the right way is to think about is that if intelligence is whatever log of compute then you try and really make sure you keep getting efficient and so that means the tokens per dollar per watt and the economic value that the society gets out of it is what we should max it.
[00:17:14] Satya Nadella: And so that's where if you sort of where the jeven's paradox point is that which is you keep reducing it commoditizing in some sense intelligence so that it becomes the real driver of GDP growth all around.
[00:17:30] Satya Nadella: Unfortunately it's something closer to log of intelligence was log of compute but we may figure out better scaling laws and we may figure out.
[00:17:38] Sam Altman: We heard from both Microsoft and Google yesterday both said their cloud businesses would have been growing faster if they have more GPUs you know I asked Jensen on this pod if there was any chance over the course of the next five years we would have.
[00:17:50] Brad Gerstner: A compute glut and he said it's virtually nonexistent chance in the next two to three years and I assume you guys would both agree with Jensen that while we can't see out five six seven years.
[00:18:02] Brad Gerstner: Certainly over the course of the next two to three years for the for the reasons we just discussed that it's almost a nonexistent chance that you have excess compute well I mean I think the cycles of demand and supply in this particular case you can't really predict right I mean even the point is what's the secular trend.
[00:18:23] Satya Nadella: The secular trend is what Sam said which is at the end of the day because quite frankly the biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut but it's a power and it's sort of the ability to get the bills done fast enough close to power.
[00:18:36] Satya Nadella: So if you can't do that you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can't plug in in fact that is my problem today right it's not a supply issue of chips it's actually.
[00:18:48] Satya Nadella: The fact that I don't have warm shelves to plug into and so how some supply chain constraints emerge tough to predict because the demand is just going you know is tough to predict right I mean I wouldn't it's not like Sam and I would want to be sitting here saying oh my god we're less short on computers because we just were not that good at being able to project out what the demand would really look like so I think that that's and by the way the worldwide side red wanted it's one thing to sort of talk about one segment in one country.
[00:19:17] Satya Nadella: But it's about you know really getting it out to everywhere in the world and so there will be constraints and how we work through them is going to be the most important thing it won't be a linear path for sure.
[00:19:27] Satya Nadella: They there will come a glut for sure and whether that's like in two to three years or five to six so I can't tell you but like it's going to happen at some point probably several points along the way like this is there is something deep about human psychology here and bubbles and also as Satya said like there's it's such a complex.
[00:19:46] Sam Altman: It's such a complex supply chain weird stuff gets built the technological landscape shifts in big ways so you know if a very cheap form of energy comes online soon at mass scale and a lot of people are going to be extremely burned with existing contracts they've signed it if if we can continue this unbelievable reduction in cost per unit of intelligence let's say it's been averaging like 40 X for a given level per year you know that's like a very scary exponent.
[00:20:16] From an infrastructure build out standpoint now again we're taking the bet that there'll be a lot more demand is that gets cheaper but I have some fear that it's just like man we keep going with these breakthroughs and everybody can run like a personal agenda laptop and we just did an insane thing here some people are going to get really burned like has happened in every other tech infrastructure cycle at some points along the way.
[00:20:40] Sam Altman: I think that's really well said and you have to hold those two simultaneous truths we had that happen in 2000 2001 and yet the internet became much bigger and produce much greater outcomes for society than anybody estimated in that period of time.
[00:20:54] Brad Gerstner: Yeah but the one thing that Sam said is not talked about enough which is the come for example the optimizations that open a eyes done on the inference stack for a given GPU I mean it's kind of like it's you know we talk about the Moore's law improvement on one end
[00:21:09] Satya Nadella: Soffit improvements are much more exponential than that.
[00:21:14] Someday we will make incredible consumer device that can run a GPT 5 or GPT 6 Cape build model completely locally at a low power draw and this is like so hard to wrap my head around that will be incredible and you know that's the type of thing I think that scares some of the people who are building obviously these large centralized
[00:21:35] Brad Gerstner: stacks and such you've talked a lot about the distribution both to the edge as well as having inference capability distributed around the world.
[00:21:43] Brad Gerstner: Yeah I mean the way at least I've thought about it is more about really building a fungible fleet I mean when I look at sort of in the cloud infrastructure business one of the key things you have to do is have two things one is an efficient like in this context and a very efficient token factory and then high utilization that's that's it.
[00:22:02] Satya Nadella: There are two simple things that you need to achieve and in order to have a high utilization you have to have multiple workloads that can be scheduled even on the training I mean if you look at the AI pipelines there's pre training there's mid training there's post training there's RL you want to be able to do all of those things so thinking about fungibility of the fleet is everything for a cloud provider.
[00:22:21] Satya Nadella: Okay so Sam you referenced you know and Reuters was reporting yesterday that opening I may be planning to go public late 26 or 20.
[00:22:30] Brad Gerstner: No no we don't we don't have anything that specific I'm a realist I assume it will happen someday but that was I don't know why people write these are like great to do this or anything like that I just assume it's where things will eventually go.
[00:22:45] Sam Altman: It does seem to me if you guys were you know are doing an excess of $100 billion of revenue in 28 or 29 that you at least would be in what I'm about 27.
[00:22:57] Yeah 27 even better you are in position to do an IPO and the rumored trillion dollars again just to contextualize for listeners if you guys want public at 10 times 100 billion in revenue right which would be I think a lower multiple than
[00:23:14] Brad Gerstner: Facebook went public at a lower multiple than a lot of other big consumer companies went public at that would put you to a trillion dollars if you floated 10 to 20% of the company that raises 100 to 200 billion dollars which seems like that would be a good path to fund a lot of the growth and a lot of the stuff that we just talked about so you're you're not opposed to it you're not but you guys are making.
[00:23:40] Brad Gerstner: I'm on the company with revenue growth which is what I would like us to do but well I've also said I think that this is such an important company and you know there are so many people including my kids who like to trade their little accounts and they use chat GPT and I think having retail investors have an opportunity to buy one of the most important and largest.
[00:24:03] Brad Gerstner: Honestly that that is probably the single most appealing thing about it to me that would be really nice.
[00:24:10] Sam Altman: One of the things I've talked to you both about shifting gears again is part of the big beautiful bill you know senator crews had included federal preemption so that we wouldn't have this state patchwork 50 different laws that Myers the industry down and kind of needless compliance and regulation.
[00:24:30] Brad Gerstner: Unfortunately got killed at the last second by senator blackburn because frankly I think AI is pretty poorly understood in Washington and there's a lot of doom or is I think that is game traction in Washington so now we have state laws like the Colorado AI act that goes into full effect in February I believe that creates this whole new class of litigants anybody who claims any unfair impact from an algorithmic discrimination and a chatbot so somebody could claim harm for countless reasons Sam how worried.
[00:24:59] Brad Gerstner: Are you that you know having this state patchwork of AI you know poses real challenges to you know our ability to continue to accelerate and compete around the world.
[00:25:11] Brad Gerstner: I don't know how we're supposed to comply with that California it's sorry Colorado law I would love them to tell us and you know we'd like to be able to do it but that's just from what I read of that that's like I literally don't know what we're supposed to do I'm very worried about a 50 state patchwork I think it's a big mistake I think it's.
[00:25:28] Sam Altman: There's a reason we don't usually do that for these sorts of things I think it'd be bad yeah I mean I think the fundamental problem of you know this patchwork approaches quite frankly I mean between open AI and Microsoft will figure out a way to navigate this right I mean we can figure this out the problem is anyone starting a startup and trying to kind of this is sort of it just goes to the exact opposite or I think what the intent here is which obviously safety is very important.
[00:25:57] Satya Nadella: I'm making sure that the fundamental you know concerns people have a address but there's a way to do that at the federal level so I think you you if we don't do this again you know you will do it and then that'll cause its own issue so I think if US leads it's better as you know as one regulatory framework for sure.
[00:26:17] Satya Nadella: And to be clear it's not that one is advocating for no regulation it's simply saying let's have you know agreed upon regulation at the federal level as opposed to 50 competing state laws which certainly fire bombs the AI startup industry and I think it makes it makes it super challenging even for companies like yours who can afford to defend all these cases yeah I would just say quite frankly my hope is that this time around even across EU and the United States that that would be the dream right quite frankly for the world.
[00:26:47] Satya Nadella: So I think that's a great idea for any European startup. I don't think that's going to happen. What is that that would be great I don't I wouldn't hold your breath for that one that would be great.
[00:26:56] Satya Nadella: No but I really think that if you think about it right if you sort of if anyone in Europe is thinking about there you know what how can they participate in this AI economy with their companies this should be the main concern there as well so therefore that's I hope there is some enlightened approach to it but I agree with you that you know today I wouldn't better.
[00:27:16] Satya Nadella: I do think that with SACS as the AI's are you at least have a president that I think might fight for that in terms of coordination of of AI policy using trade as a lever to make sure that you know we don't end up with overly restricted European policy but we shall see I think first things first federal preemption the United States is pretty critical you know we've been down in the weeds a little bit here Sam so I want to tell us go about a little bit you know I've heard people on your team talk about
[00:27:45] Brad Gerstner: all the great things coming up and and as you start thinking about much more unlimited compute chat GPT six and beyond robotics physical devices scientific research as you as you look forward to 2026 what do you think surprises us the most what what what what are you most excited about in terms of what's on the drawing board.
[00:28:09] Brad Gerstner: You are mean you just hit on a lot of the key points there I think codex has been in a very cool thing to watch this year and as these go from multi hour tasks to multi day tasks which I expect to happen next year what people be able to do to create software unprecedented rate and really in fundamentally new ways I'm very excited for that I think we'll see that in other industries to I have like a bias towards coding I understand that one better but I think we'll see that really start to transform what people are capable of.
[00:28:39] Sam Altman: I hope for very small scientific discoveries in 2026 but if we can get those very small ones we'll get bigger ones in future years that's a really crazy thing to say is that like AI is going to make a novel scientific discovery in 2026 even a very small this is like this is a wildly important thing to be talking about so I'm excited for that certainly robotics and computer and new kind of computers in future years that'll be that'll be very important but yeah my personal bias.
[00:29:09] Sam Altman: I think this is if we can really get AI to do science here that is I mean that is super intelligence in some sense like if this is expanding the total sum of human knowledge that is a crazy big deal.
[00:29:20] Sam Altman: Yeah I mean I think one of the things to use your codex example I think the combination of the model capability I mean if you think about the magical moment that happened with chat GPT was the UI that met intelligence that just took off right there's just you know unbelievable right form factor.
[00:29:38] Satya Nadella: And some of it was also the instruction following piece of model capability was ready for chat.
[00:29:44] Satya Nadella: I think that that's what the codex and the you know these coding agents are about to help us which is what's that you know coding agent goes off for a long period of time comes back and then I'm then dropped into what I should steer like one of the metaphors I think we're all sort of working towards this I do this macro delegation and micro steering.
[00:30:07] Satya Nadella: What is that UI meets this new intelligence capability and you can see the beginnings of that with codex right the way at least I use it inside a GitHub Copilot is like you know it's now it's just a it's just a different way than the chat interface and I think that I think it would be a new way for the human computer interface quite frankly it's probably bigger than that that might be the departure.
[00:30:32] Satya Nadella: That's one reason I'm very excited that we're doing new form factors of computing devices because computers were not built for that kind of workflow very well certainly a UI like chat GPT is wrong for it but this idea that you can have a device that is sort of.
[00:30:46] Always with you but able to go off and do things and get micro steer from you when it needs and have like really good contextual awareness of your whole life and flow and I think that would be cool.
[00:30:55] Sam Altman: And what neither of you have talked about is the consumer use case I think a lot about you know again we go on to this device and we have to hunt and pack through a hundred different applications and fill out little web forms things that really haven't changed in 20 years but to just have you know a personal assistant that we take for granted perhaps that we actually have a personal assistant.
[00:31:14] Brad Gerstner: To give a personal assistant for virtually free to billions of people around the world to improve their lives whether it's you know ordering diapers for their kid or whether it's you know booking their hotel or or or making changes in their calendar I think sometimes it's the pedestrian that's it's the most impactful and as we move from answers to memory and actions and then the ability to interface with that through an earbud or some other device that doesn't require me to constantly be staying staring at this rectangular piece of glass.
[00:31:44] Brad Gerstner: I think it's pretty extraordinary I think that that's what Sam was teasing yeah yeah right I got to drop off unfortunately Sam it was great to see you thanks for joining us congrats again on this big step forward and we'll talk to you.
[00:31:57] Brad Gerstner: Thanks for letting me crash see a sound take care it's yeah.
[00:32:00] Brad Gerstner: Sam well knows we're certainly a buyer not a seller but but but sometimes you know I think it's important because the world you know we're pretty small we spend all day long thinking about this stuff.
[00:32:13] Brad Gerstner: Right and so conviction it comes from the 10,000 hours we've spent thinking about it but the reality is we have to bring along the rest of the world in the rest of the world doesn't spend 10,000 hours thinking about this and frankly they look at some things that appear overly ambitious right and get worried about whether or not we can pull those things off.
[00:32:36] Brad Gerstner: So you took this idea to the board in 2019 to invest a billion dollars into open AI was it a no-brainer in the board room you know did you have to expend any political capital to get it done.
[00:32:48] Brad Gerstner: Dish for me a little bit like what that moment was was like because I think it was such a pivotal moment not just for Microsoft not just for the country but I really do think for the world.
[00:32:58] Brad Gerstner: Yeah I mean it's it's interesting when you look back the journey when I look at it it's been you know we were involved even in 2016 when initially open AI started in fact Azure was even the first sponsor I think and then they were doing a lot more reinforcement learning at that time I remember the daughter to competition I think happened on Azure and then they moved on to other things and you know I was interested in our out but quite frankly you know it speaks a little bit to your 10,000 hours or the world.
[00:33:27] Satya Nadella: So it's been a couple of hours or the prepared mind Microsoft since 1995 was obsessed I mean builds obsession for the company was natural language natural language I mean after all we had a coding company that's right information work company.
[00:33:41] Satya Nadella: So it's when Sam in 2019 started talking about text and natural language and transformers and scaling laws that's when I say wow like this is an interesting I mean he you know this was a team that was going in the direction or the direction of travel was now clear.
[00:33:56] Satya Nadella: It had a lot more overlap with our interest so in that sense it was a no brainer obviously go to the board and say here I have an idea of taking a billion dollars and giving it to this crazy structure which we don't even kind of understand what is it it's a nonprofit blah blah blah and and saying go for it.
[00:34:16] Satya Nadella: There was a debate bill was kind of rightfully so skeptical because and then he became like once he saw the GPT for demo like that was like the thing that bills talked about publicly where when he saw it he said it's the best demo he saw after you know what Charles Simony showed him at Xerox Park and but you know quite honestly not a fuss could so the moment for me was that you know let's go give it a shot.
[00:34:42] Satya Nadella: Then seeing the early codex inside of co pilot inside of get up co pilot and seeing just the code completions and seeing it work that's when I would say we I felt like I can go from one to 10 because that was the big call quite frankly one was controversial but the one to 10 was what really made this entire era possible and then obviously the great execution by the team and the product.
[00:35:11] Satya Nadella: The team and the productization on their part our part I mean if I think about it right the collective monetization reach of get up co pilot chat GPT Microsoft 365 co pilot and co pilot you add those four things that is it right that's the biggest sort of AI set of products out there on the planet and that's you know what obviously is let us sustain all of this.
[00:35:34] Satya Nadella: And I think not many people know that your CTO Kevin Scott you know an ex-Google or lives down here in Silicon Valley and to contextualize it right Microsoft had missed out on search.
[00:35:45] Brad Gerstner: Had missed out on mobile you become CEO almost had missed out on the cloud.
[00:35:50] Brad Gerstner: Right you described it caught the last train out of town to capture the cloud and I think you were pretty determined to have eyes and ears down here so you didn't miss the next big thing so I assume that Kevin played a good road.
[00:36:04] Brad Gerstner: I think that's all for you as well absolutely deep seek and open AI.
[00:36:09] Satya Nadella: Yeah I mean if it's in fact I would say Kevin's conviction and Kevin was also skeptical like that was the thing I always watch for people who are skeptical who change their opinion because to me that's a signal so I'm always looking for someone who's a non-believer and something and then suddenly changes and then they get excited about it.
[00:36:31] Satya Nadella: And I think that's all the time for that because I'm then curious why and so Kevin started with it all of us were kind of skeptical right no I mean in some sense it defies the you know we're all having gone to school and said God you know there must be an algorithm to crack this was just let's scaling laws and throw compute but quite frankly.
[00:36:51] Satya Nadella: Kevin's conviction that this is what going after is one of the big things that drove this well we talk about you know that it had investment that it's now worth 130 billion I suppose could be worth a trillion someday as Sam says but it really in many ways understates the value of the partnership right so you have the value in the rev share billions per year going going to Microsoft.
[00:37:16] Brad Gerstner: The profit you make off the 250 billion dollar of the Azure compute commitment from open AI and of course you get huge sales from the exclusive distribution of the API so talk to us how you think about the value across those domains especially how this exclusivity is brought a lot of customers who may have been on AWS to Azure.
[00:37:39] Brad Gerstner: Yeah no absolutely I mean so to us if I look at it you know aside from all the the equity parts the real strategic thing that comes together and that remains going forward is that stateless API exclusive video on Azure that helps quite frankly both open AI and us and our customers because when somebody in the enterprise is trying to build an application they want an API that stateless.
[00:38:07] Satya Nadella: They want to mix it up with compute and storage put a database underneath it to capture state and build a full workload and that's where you know Azure coming together with this API and so what we're doing with even Azure foundry right because in some sense you let's say you want to build an AI application but the key thing is how do you make sure that the evals of what you're doing with AI are great so that's where you need even a full app server.
[00:38:37] Satya Nadella: And so that's what we've done and so therefore I feel that that is the way we will go to market in our infrastructure business.
[00:38:45] Satya Nadella: The other side of the value capture for us is going to be incorporating all this IP not only we have the exclusivity of the model in Azure but we have access to the IP I mean having a royalty free let's even forgetting all the the know how and the knowledge side of it but having royalty free access all the way till seven more years gives us a lot of flexibility.
[00:39:06] Satya Nadella: Business model wise it's kind of like having a frontier model for free in some sense if you're an MSFT shareholder that's kind of where you should start from is to think about we have a frontier model that we can then deploy whether it's in GitHub whether it's in m365 whether it's in our consumer co pilot.
[00:39:24] Satya Nadella: Then add to it our own data post strain it so that means we can have it embedded in the weights there and so therefore we're excited about the value creation on both the Azure and the infrastructure side as well as in our high value domains whether it is in health whether it's in knowledge work whether it's encoding or security.
[00:39:45] Satya Nadella: You've been consolidating the losses from open AI you know I think you you just reported earning yesterday I think you consolidated four billion of losses in the quarter do you think that investors are I mean they may be a trip attributing negative value right because of the losses you know as they apply their multiple of earnings such a whereas I hear this and I think about all of those benefits we just described not to mention the look through equity value that you own in a company that could be worth a trillion onto itself you know do you
[00:40:15] Brad Gerstner: think that the market is is is kind of misunderstanding the value of open AI as a component of Microsoft.
[00:40:22] Brad Gerstner: Yeah that's good one so I think the approach that Amy is going to take is full transparency because at some level I'm not counting experts so therefore the best thing to do is to give all the transparency I think this time around as well I think that's why the non gap gap so that at least people can see the EPS numbers because the common sense way I look at it
[00:40:44] Satya Nadella: is simple if you've invested let's call it 13 and a half billion dollars you can of course lose 13 and a half billion right but you can lose more than 13 and a half billion dollars at least the last time I check that's what you have at risk you can also say in the 135 billion dollars that is you know today our equity stake you know is sort of illiquid what have you I've been on
[00:41:06] Satya Nadella: on plan to sell it so therefore it's got risk associated with it but the real story I think you are pulling is all the other things that are happening what's happening with Azure growth right would Azure be growing if we had not sort of had the opening
[00:41:20] Satya Nadella: of partnership to your point the number of customers who came from other clothes clouds for the first time right this is the thing that really we benefited from what's happening with Microsoft 365 in fact one of the things about Microsoft 365 was what was the next big thing after E5 guess what we found it in
[00:41:38] Satya Nadella: and we're going to have a pilot it's bigger than any suite like you know we talk about penetration and usage and the pace it's bigger than anything we have done in our information work which we mean added for decades and so so we feel very very good about the opportunity to create value for our shareholders
[00:41:58] Satya Nadella: and so we're going to have the same time be fully transparent so that people can look through the water the losses I mean who knows what the accounting rules are but we will do whatever is needed and people will then be able to see what's happening.
[00:42:09] Satya Nadella: But a year ago such a there are a bunch of headlines that Microsoft was pulling back on AI infrastructure right fair unfair there they were out there you know and and perhaps you guys were a little more conservative a little more skeptical of what was going on Amy said on the call last night though that you've been short power and infrastructure from the
[00:42:27] Brad Gerstner: many quarters and she thought that you would catch up but you haven't caught up because demand keeps increasing so I guess the question is were you too conservative you know knowing what you know now and and what's the road map from here.
[00:42:41] Brad Gerstner: Yeah it's a great question because see the the thing that we realized and I'm glad we did is that the concept of building a fleet that truly was fungible fungible for all the parts of the life cycle of AI fungible
[00:42:56] Satya Nadella: across geographies and fungible across generations right so because one of the key things is when you have let's take even what Jensen and team are doing right I mean they're at a pace in fact one of the things I like is the speed of light right we now have GB 300 is bringing you know that we're bringing up.
[00:43:15] Satya Nadella: You don't want to have ordered a bunch of GB 200s that are getting plugged in only to find the GB 200s are in full production so you kind of have to make sure you're continuously modernizing you're spreading the fleet all over you are really truly fungible by workload and you're adding to that the software optimizations we talked about so to me that is the decision we made and we said look sometimes you may have to say no to some of the demanding.
[00:43:44] Satya Nadella: Some of the demand including some of the open AI demand right because sometimes you know Sam may say give a bill me a dedicated you know big you know whatever multi gigawatt data center in one location for training makes sense from an open AI perspective doesn't make sense from a long term infrastructure build out for Azure and that's where I thought they did the right thing to give them flexibility to go procure that from others while maintaining again a significant book of business from open AI but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:44:12] Satya Nadella: A significant book of business from open AI but more importantly giving ourselves the flexibility with other customers our own one piece remember like one of the things that we don't want to do is be short on is you know we talk about Azure in fact some of times our investors are overly fixated on the Azure number but remember for me the high margin business for me is co pilot it is security co pilot it's get up co pilot it's the healthcare co pilot so we want to make sure we have a balanced way to approach the return to the market.
[00:44:42] Satya Nadella: So we have a balanced that the investors have and so that's kind of one of the other misunderstood perhaps in our investor base in particular which I find pretty strange and funny because I think they they want to hold Microsoft because of the portfolio we have but man are they fixated on the growth number or one little thing called Azure on that point as your grew 39% in the quarter on a staggering 93 billion dollar run rate and you know I think that compares to GCP that grew at 32% and 80% of the
[00:45:12] Brad Gerstner: WS closer to 20% but could Azure because you did give compute to 1 p and because you did give compute to research it sounds like Azure could have grown 41 42% had you had more compute to absolutely absolutely there's no question there's no question so that's why I think the internal thing is to balance out what we think again is in the long term interest of our shareholders and I know to serve our customers well and also not to kind of you know one of the
[00:45:42] Satya Nadella: other things was you know people talk about concentration risk right we obviously want a lot of open AI but we also want other customers and so we're shaping the demand here you know we are in a supply you know you know we're not demand constraint we're supply constraint so we're shaping the demand such that it matches the supply in the optimal way with the long term view to that point such a you you talked about 400 billion it's incredible number of remaining performance obligations last night
[00:46:12] Brad Gerstner: you said that you know that's your book business today it'll surely go up tomorrow as sales continue to come in and you said you're going to you know you need to build out capacity just to serve that backlog is very high you know how diversified is that backlog to your to your point and how confident are you that that 400 billion does turn into revenue over the course of the next couple years.
[00:46:36] Brad Gerstner: Yeah that 400 billion has a very short duration as Amy explained it's the two-year duration on average so that's definitely our intent that's one of the reasons why we're spending the capital out clear with high certainty that we just need to clear right backlog and to your point it's pretty diversified both on the one p and the three p our own demand is quite likely pretty high for our one first party and even amongst third party one of the things we are now are seeing is the the
[00:47:06] Satya Nadella: rise of all the other companies building real workloads that are scaling and so given that I think we feel very good I mean obviously it's our that's one of the best things about RPOs you can be plan for quite frankly and so therefore we feel very very good about building and then this doesn't include obviously the additional demand that we're already going to start seeing including the 250 you know which will have a longer duration and we'll build accordingly.
[00:47:32] Satya Nadella: Right so there are a lot of new entrants right in this race to build out compute Oracle core we've cruised so etc and normally we think that will compete away margins but you've somehow managed to build all this out while maintaining healthy operating margins at Azure so I guess the question is for Microsoft how do you compete in this world that is where people are leveraging up taking lower margins while balancing that profit and
[00:48:02] Brad Gerstner: and risk and do you see any of those competitors doing deals that cause you to scratch your head and say oh we're just setting ourselves up for another boom and bust cycle.
[00:48:11] Brad Gerstner: I mean at some level the good news for us has been competing even as a hyper scalar every day you know there's a lot of competition right between us and Amazon and Google on all of these right I mean it's not one of those interesting things which is
[00:48:25] Satya Nadella: everything is a commodity right compute storage I remember everybody saying wow how can they live a margin except at scale nothing is a commodity and so therefore yes so we have to have a cost structure our supply chain efficiency our software efficiencies all have to kind of continue to compound in order to make sure that there's margins but scale and to your point one of the things that I really love about the open AI partnership is it's gotten us to scale right
[00:48:55] Satya Nadella: this is a scale game when you have the biggest workload there is running on your cloud that means not only are we going to learn faster on what it means to operate with scale that means your
[00:49:07] Satya Nadella: cost structure is going to come down faster than anything else and guess what that will make us price competitive and so I feel pretty confident about our ability to you know have margins and and that this is where the portfolio helps I've always said
[00:49:21] Satya Nadella: you know I'm being forced into giving the Azure numbers right because at some level I never thought of allocating compete I mean my capital allocation is for the cloud from whether it is Xbox cloud gaming or Microsoft 365 or for Azure it's one capital outplay and then everything is a meter as far as I'm concerned from an ever
[00:49:43] Satya Nadella: deep perspective it's a question of hey the blended average of that should match the operating margins we need as a company because after all the otherwise why we're not a
[00:49:54] Satya Nadella: conglomerate where one company with one platform logic it's not running five six different businesses wherein these five six different businesses only to
[00:50:03] Satya Nadella: compound the returns on the cloud and AI investment yeah I love that line nothing is a commodity at scale you know there's been a lot of ink
[00:50:13] Brad Gerstner: and time spent even on this podcast with my partner bill girly talking about circular revenues including Microsoft stasher credits right open AI that were booked as revenue do you see anything going on like the AMD deal you know where they traded 10% of their equity and you know for a deal or the Nvidia deal again I don't want to be overly fixated on concern but I do want to dress head on what is being talked about every day on CNBC and Bloomberg and there are a lot of these
[00:50:43] Brad Gerstner: overlapping deals that are going on out there to you do you when you think about that in the context of Microsoft does any of that worry you again as to the sustainability or durability of the AI revenues that we see in the world yeah I mean first of all our investment of let's say that 13 and a half which was all the training investment that was not booked as revenue that is the that is the reason why we have the equity at percentage that's the reason why we have the 20
[00:51:12] Satya Nadella: 27% or 135 billion so that was not something some that somehow that made it into Azure revenue in fact if anything the Azure revenue was purely the consumption revenue of chat GPT and anything else and the API is there put out that they monetized and be monetized to your aspect of others you know to some degree it's always been there in terms of when the financing right so it's not like a new concept that when someone's building something and they have a customer
[00:51:42] Satya Nadella: who is also building something but they need financing you know for whether it is in you know it's sort of some they're taking some exotic forms which obviously need to be scrutinized by the investment community but that said you know when the financing is not a new concept interestingly enough we have not had to do any of that right I mean we may have you know really either invested in open AI and essentially got an equity stake in it for return for compute or
[00:52:12] Satya Nadella: essentially sold them great pricing of compute in order to be able to sort of bootstrap them but you know others choose to do so differently and and I think circularity ultimately will be tested by demand because all this will work as long as there is demand for the final output of it and up to now that has been the case certainly certainly why want to shift you know as you said over half your business to software applications you know I want to think about software
[00:52:42] Brad Gerstner: and agents you know last year on this pod you made a bit of a stirr by saying that much of the application software you know was this thin layer that sat on top of a crud database the notion that business applications exist that's probably where they're all collapse right in the agent era because if you think about it right they are essentially crud databases with a bunch of business logic
[00:53:11] Satya Nadella: the business logic is all going to these agents public software companies are now trading at about 5.2 times forward revenue so that's below their 10 year average of seven times despite the markets being at all time highs and there's lots of concern that SaaS subscriptions and margins maybe put it risk by AI so how today is AI affecting the growth rates of your software products of you know those core products and some of the things that you know
[00:53:40] Brad Gerstner: are products and specifically as you think about database fabric security office 360 and then second question I guess is what are you doing to make sure that software is not disrupted but is instead super powered by AI.
[00:53:55] Brad Gerstner: Yeah I think that's right so the last time we talked about this my point really there was the architecture of SaaS applications is changing because this agent here is replacing the old business logic tier and so because if you think about it the way we build SaaS applications in the past was you had the data the logic tier and the UI all tightly coupled and AI quite frankly doesn't respect that coupling because it requires you to be able to decouple and yet the context engineer
[00:54:25] Satya Nadella: is going to be very important I mean take you know something like office 365 one of the things I love about our Microsoft 365 offering is it's low RPU high usage right I mean if you think about it right outlook or teams or SharePoint you pick word or Excel like people are using it all the time creating lots and lots of data which is going into the graph and our RPU is low so that's sort of what gives me real confidence that this AI tier
[00:54:54] Satya Nadella: I can meet it by exposing all my data in fact one of the fascinating things that's happened Brad with both GitHub and Microsoft 365 is thanks to AI we are seeing all time highs in terms of data that's going into the graph or the repo I mean think about it the more code that gets generated whether it is codex or clad or wherever where is it going GitHub
[00:55:20] Satya Nadella: more power points that get created Excel models that could create it all these artifacts were and chat conversations chat conversations are new docs they're all going into the graph and and all that is needed again for grounding so that's what you know you turn it into a forward index into an embedding and basically that's semantics is what you really go ground any agent request
[00:55:46] Satya Nadella: and so I think the next generation of SaaS applications will have to sort of if you are high RPU low usage then you have a little bit of a problem but if you are we are the exact opposite we are low RPU high usage and I think that anyone who can structure that and then use this AI as in fact an accelerant because I mean right if you look at the M365 copilot price I mean it's higher than any other thing that we sell and yet it's getting deployed faster and with more usage
[00:56:15] Satya Nadella: and so I feel very good or coding right who would have thought in fact think GitHub right what GitHub did in first or no 15 years of its existence or 10 years of its existence it was basically done in the last year just because coding is no longer a tool it's more a substitute for wages and so it's a very different type of business model
[00:56:38] Satya Nadella: kind of thinking about the stack and where value gets distributed so until very recently right clouds largely ran pre compiled software you didn't need a lot of GPUs and most the value accrued to the software layer to the database to the applications like CRM and Excel
[00:56:54] Brad Gerstner: but it does seem in the future that these interfaces will only be valuable right if they're if they're intelligent right if they're pre compiled they're kind of dumb the software's got to be able to think and to act and to advise
[00:57:07] Brad Gerstner: and that requires you know the production of these tokens you know dealing with the ever changing context and so in that world it does seem like much more the value will accrue to the AI factory if you will to you know Jensen producing
[00:57:22] Brad Gerstner: you know helping to produce these tokens at the lowest cost and to the models and maybe that the agents or the software will accrue a little bit less of the value in the future than they've accrued in the past
[00:57:35] Brad Gerstner: well still man for me why that's wrong yeah so I think there are two things that are necessary to try and to drive the value of AI one is what you describe first which is the token factory
[00:57:47] Satya Nadella: and even if you unpack the token factory it's the hardware silicon system but then it is about running it most efficiently with the system software with all the fungibility max utilization that's where the hyperscalers role is right what is a hyperscaler is hyperscaler like everybody says if you sort of said hey I want to run a hyperscaler yeah you could say oh it's simple I'll buy a bunch of servers and wire them up and run it it's not that right I mean if it's that simple then there would have been more
[00:58:16] Satya Nadella: than three hyperscalers by now so the hyperscaler is the know how of running that max utel and the token factories and it's not the end by the way it's going to be heterogeneous obviously Jensen's super competitive Lisa is going to come you know Hawks going to produce things from Broadcom we will all do our own so there's going to be a combination so you want to run ultimately a heterogeneous fleet that is maximized for token throughput and efficiency and so on so that's kind of one thing
[00:58:45] Satya Nadella: the next thing is what I call the agent factory remember that Assass application in the modern world is driving a business outcome it knows how to most efficiently use the tokens to create some business value in fact get up co pilot is a great example of it right which is you know if you think about it the auto mode of get up co pilot is the smartest thing we've done right so it chooses based on the problem which modern tools are going to be done
[00:59:13] Satya Nadella: based on the prompt, which model to use for a code completion
[00:59:17] Satya Nadella: or a task handoff, right?
[00:59:20] Satya Nadella: That's what you, and you do that, not just by, you know,
[00:59:23] Satya Nadella: choosing in some round-drop in fashion,
[00:59:24] Satya Nadella: you're doing because of the feedback cycle you have,
[00:59:27] Satya Nadella: you have the e-vals, the data loops and so on.
[00:59:30] Satya Nadella: So the new SaaS applications, as you rightfully said,
[00:59:33] Satya Nadella: are intelligent applications that are optimized
[00:59:36] Satya Nadella: for a set of e-vals and a set of outcomes
[00:59:39] Satya Nadella: that then know how to use the token factories output,
[00:59:42] Satya Nadella: most efficiently, sometimes latency matters,
[00:59:46] Satya Nadella: sometimes performance matters,
[00:59:48] Satya Nadella: and knowing how to do that trade in a smart way
[00:59:52] Satya Nadella: is where the SaaS application value is.
[00:59:54] Satya Nadella: But overall, it is going to be true
[00:59:57] Satya Nadella: that there is a real marginal cost
[00:59:59] Satya Nadella: to software this time around.
[01:00:00] Satya Nadella: It was there in the cloud era too,
[01:00:02] Satya Nadella: and we were doing, you know, CD-ROMs,
[01:00:04] Satya Nadella: there wasn't much of a marginal cost,
[01:00:07] Satya Nadella: you know, with the cloud there was,
[01:00:09] Satya Nadella: and this time around, it's a lot more.
[01:00:10] Satya Nadella: And so therefore, the business models have to adjust,
[01:00:13] Satya Nadella: and you have to do these optimizations
[01:00:15] Satya Nadella: for the agent factory and the token factory separately.
[01:00:18] Satya Nadella: You have a big search business
[01:00:19] Brad Gerstner: that most people don't know about, you know,
[01:00:21] Brad Gerstner: but it turns out that that's probably
[01:00:24] Brad Gerstner: one of the most profitable businesses
[01:00:25] Brad Gerstner: in the history of the world
[01:00:26] Brad Gerstner: because people are running lots of searches,
[01:00:29] Brad Gerstner: billions of searches,
[01:00:30] Brad Gerstner: and the cost of completing a search,
[01:00:33] Brad Gerstner: if your Microsoft is many fractions of a penny, right?
[01:00:36] Brad Gerstner: It doesn't cost very much to complete a search,
[01:00:39] Brad Gerstner: but the comparable query or prompt stack today
[01:00:42] Brad Gerstner: when you use a chatbot looks different, right?
[01:00:46] Brad Gerstner: So I guess the question is,
[01:00:49] Brad Gerstner: assume similar levels of revenue
[01:00:51] Brad Gerstner: in the future for those two businesses, right?
[01:00:54] Brad Gerstner: Do you ever get to a point
[01:00:55] Brad Gerstner: where kind of that chat interaction
[01:00:57] Brad Gerstner: has unit economics that are as profitable as search?
[01:01:01] Brad Gerstner: I think that's a great point
[01:01:02] Satya Nadella: because see, search was pretty magical
[01:01:07] Satya Nadella: in terms of its ad unit
[01:01:09] Satya Nadella: and its cost economics
[01:01:11] Satya Nadella: because there was the index
[01:01:13] Satya Nadella: which was a fixed cost
[01:01:14] Satya Nadella: that you could then amortize
[01:01:16] Satya Nadella: in a much more efficient way.
[01:01:19] Satya Nadella: Whereas this one, you know, each chat to your point,
[01:01:22] Satya Nadella: you have to burn a lot more GPU cycles
[01:01:25] Satya Nadella: both with the intent and the retrieval.
[01:01:27] Satya Nadella: So the economics are different.
[01:01:28] Satya Nadella: So I think you knew,
[01:01:29] Satya Nadella: that's why I think a lot of the early sort of economics
[01:01:32] Satya Nadella: of chat have been the freemium model and subscription
[01:01:35] Satya Nadella: on the even on the consumer side.
[01:01:37] Satya Nadella: So we are yet to discover
[01:01:39] Satya Nadella: whether it's agentic commerce
[01:01:40] Satya Nadella: or whatever is the ad unit,
[01:01:42] Satya Nadella: how it's going to be litigated.
[01:01:44] Satya Nadella: But at the same time,
[01:01:46] Satya Nadella: the fact that at this point, you know,
[01:01:48] Satya Nadella: I kind of know,
[01:01:49] Satya Nadella: in fact I use search for very, very specific navigational queries.
[01:01:54] Satya Nadella: I used to say I use it a lot for commerce,
[01:01:57] Satya Nadella: but that's also shifting to my, you know,
[01:01:59] Satya Nadella: Copilot, look, I look at the Copilot mode
[01:02:02] Satya Nadella: in edge and being or Copilot.
[01:02:06] Satya Nadella: Now they're blending in.
[01:02:07] Satya Nadella: So I think that yes,
[01:02:08] Satya Nadella: I think that is going to be a real litigation.
[01:02:11] Satya Nadella: Just like that we talked about the SaaS disruption,
[01:02:13] Satya Nadella: we're in the beginning of the cheese
[01:02:15] Satya Nadella: being a little moved in consumer economics of that category.
[01:02:19] Satya Nadella: Right.
[01:02:20] Brad Gerstner: I mean, and given that it's the multi trillion dollar,
[01:02:23] Brad Gerstner: this is the thing that's driven
[01:02:24] Brad Gerstner: all the economics of the internet, right?
[01:02:27] Brad Gerstner: When you move the economics of search
[01:02:29] Brad Gerstner: for both you and Google
[01:02:31] Brad Gerstner: and it converges on something that looks more like a personal agent,
[01:02:34] Brad Gerstner: a personal assistant chat,
[01:02:36] Brad Gerstner: you know, that could end up being much, much bigger
[01:02:40] Brad Gerstner: in terms of the total value delivered to humanity,
[01:02:42] Brad Gerstner: but the unit economics,
[01:02:43] Brad Gerstner: you're not just amortizing this one time fixed index.
[01:02:46] Brad Gerstner: That's right.
[01:02:47] Brad Gerstner: And so that's right.
[01:02:48] Brad Gerstner: That's right.
[01:02:49] Brad Gerstner: They consume up.
[01:02:50] Brad Gerstner: Yeah, the consumer category,
[01:02:52] Satya Nadella: because you are putting a thread on something
[01:02:53] Satya Nadella: that I think a lot about, right?
[01:02:54] Satya Nadella: Which is what during these disruptions,
[01:02:57] Satya Nadella: you kind of have to have a real sense of
[01:03:00] Satya Nadella: where is, what is the category economics?
[01:03:04] Satya Nadella: Is it winner take all?
[01:03:07] Satya Nadella: And both matter, right?
[01:03:09] Satya Nadella: The problem in consumer space always is
[01:03:13] Satya Nadella: that there's finite amount of time.
[01:03:16] And so if I'm not doing one thing,
[01:03:20] Satya Nadella: I'm doing something else.
[01:03:21] Satya Nadella: And if your monetization is predicated
[01:03:23] Satya Nadella: on some human interaction in particular,
[01:03:26] Satya Nadella: if there was truly a gentick stuff,
[01:03:28] Satya Nadella: even on consumer, that could be different.
[01:03:30] Satya Nadella: Whereas in the enterprise,
[01:03:31] Satya Nadella: one is it's not winner take all.
[01:03:33] Satya Nadella: And two, it is going to be a lot more friendly
[01:03:36] Satya Nadella: from a gentick interaction.
[01:03:38] Satya Nadella: So it's not like, for example,
[01:03:39] Satya Nadella: the first seat versus consumption,
[01:03:41] Satya Nadella: the reality is agents are the new seats.
[01:03:44] Satya Nadella: And so you can think of it as
[01:03:47] Satya Nadella: the enterprise monetization is much clearer.
[01:03:50] Satya Nadella: The consumer monetization, I think, is a little more murky.
[01:03:53] Brad Gerstner: You know, we've seen a spade of layoffs recently
[01:03:55] Brad Gerstner: with Amazon announcing a big layoffs this week.
[01:03:58] Brad Gerstner: You know, the Mag 7 is at little job growth
[01:04:01] Brad Gerstner: over the last three years,
[01:04:02] Brad Gerstner: despite really robust top lines.
[01:04:04] Brad Gerstner: You know, you didn't grow your head count really
[01:04:06] Brad Gerstner: from 24 to 25.
[01:04:08] Brad Gerstner: It's around 225,000.
[01:04:10] Brad Gerstner: You know, many attribute this to normal getting fit.
[01:04:13] Brad Gerstner: You know, just getting more efficient coming out of COVID.
[01:04:15] Brad Gerstner: And I think there's a lot of truth to that.
[01:04:17] Brad Gerstner: But do you think part of this is due to AI?
[01:04:20] Brad Gerstner: Do you think that AI is going to be a net job creator?
[01:04:23] Brad Gerstner: And do you see this being a long-term positive
[01:04:26] Brad Gerstner: for Microsoft productivity?
[01:04:28] Brad Gerstner: Like it feels to me like the pie grows,
[01:04:31] Brad Gerstner: but you can do all these things much more efficiently,
[01:04:34] Brad Gerstner: which either means your margins expand,
[01:04:38] Brad Gerstner: or it means you reinvest those margin dollars
[01:04:40] Brad Gerstner: and you grow faster for longer.
[01:04:42] Brad Gerstner: I caught the golden age of margin expansion.
[01:04:45] I'm a firm believer that the productivity curve
[01:04:50] Satya Nadella: does and will bend or in the sense that
[01:04:54] Satya Nadella: we will start seeing some of what is the work
[01:04:58] Satya Nadella: and the work flowing particular change, right?
[01:05:02] Satya Nadella: There's going to be more agency for you at a task level
[01:05:07] Satya Nadella: to get to job complete because of the power of these tools
[01:05:12] Satya Nadella: in your hand.
[01:05:13] Satya Nadella: And that I think is going to be the case.
[01:05:14] Satya Nadella: So that's why I think we are even internally,
[01:05:17] Satya Nadella: for example, when you talked about even our allocation
[01:05:20] Satya Nadella: of tokens, we want to make sure
[01:05:22] Satya Nadella: that everybody at Microsoft's standard issue, right?
[01:05:25] Satya Nadella: All of them have Microsoft 365 to the tilt
[01:05:28] Satya Nadella: in the most unlimited way and have GitHub co-pilot
[01:05:32] Satya Nadella: so that they can really be more productive.
[01:05:35] Satya Nadella: But here is the other interesting thing
[01:05:36] Satya Nadella: that we're learning is there's a new way to even learn,
[01:05:41] Satya Nadella: which is how to work with agents, right?
[01:05:44] Satya Nadella: So that's kind of like when the first,
[01:05:46] Satya Nadella: when Word, Excel, PowerPoint, all showed up in office,
[01:05:49] Satya Nadella: kind of, we learned how to rethink,
[01:05:52] Satya Nadella: so let's say how we did a forecast, right?
[01:05:54] Satya Nadella: I mean, think about it, right?
[01:05:55] Satya Nadella: In the 80s, the forecast were inter-office memos
[01:05:58] Satya Nadella: and faxes and what have you.
[01:06:00] Satya Nadella: And then suddenly somebody said,
[01:06:01] Satya Nadella: oh, here's an Excel spreadsheet.
[01:06:03] Satya Nadella: Let's put in an email, send it around people
[01:06:05] Satya Nadella: and to numbers and there was a forecast.
[01:06:07] Satya Nadella: Similarly, right now, any planning, any execution starts
[01:06:11] Satya Nadella: with AI, you research with AI, you think with AI,
[01:06:14] Satya Nadella: you share with your colleagues and what have you.
[01:06:17] Satya Nadella: So there's a new artifact being created
[01:06:19] Satya Nadella: and a new workflow being created.
[01:06:21] Satya Nadella: And that is the rate of the pace of change
[01:06:25] Satya Nadella: of the business process that matches the capability of AI.
[01:06:31] Satya Nadella: That's where the productivity efficiencies come.
[01:06:34] Satya Nadella: And so organizations that can master that
[01:06:37] Satya Nadella: are gonna be the biggest beneficiaries,
[01:06:38] Satya Nadella: whether it's in our industry
[01:06:40] Satya Nadella: or quite frankly in the real world.
[01:06:42] And so is Microsoft benefiting from that?
[01:06:45] Brad Gerstner: So let's think about a couple of years from now,
[01:06:48] five years from now, at the current growth rate
[01:06:51] Brad Gerstner: will be sooner, but let's call five years from now.
[01:06:53] Brad Gerstner: Your top line is twice as big as what it is today,
[01:06:56] Brad Gerstner: Sacha, how many more employees will you have?
[01:06:58] Brad Gerstner: If you grow revenue by...
[01:07:00] Brad Gerstner: Like one of the best things right now
[01:07:02] Satya Nadella: is these examples that I'm hit with every day
[01:07:05] Satya Nadella: from the employees of Microsoft.
[01:07:06] Satya Nadella: There is this person who leads our network operations, right?
[01:07:09] Satya Nadella: I mean, if you think about the amount of fiber
[01:07:12] Satya Nadella: we have had to put for this two gigawatt data center,
[01:07:17] Satya Nadella: we just built out in fair water, right?
[01:07:20] Satya Nadella: And the amount of fiber there, the AI, right?
[01:07:22] Satya Nadella: And it's just crazy, right?
[01:07:24] Satya Nadella: So and it turns out this is a real world asset.
[01:07:28] Satya Nadella: There are I think 400 different fiber operators
[01:07:30] Satya Nadella: we are dealing with worldwide.
[01:07:32] Satya Nadella: Every time something happens,
[01:07:33] Satya Nadella: we are literally going and dealing with all these DevOps pipelines.
[01:07:36] Satya Nadella: The person who leads it, she basically said to me,
[01:07:39] Satya Nadella: you know what, there's no way I'll ever get the head count
[01:07:42] Satya Nadella: to go do all this.
[01:07:43] Satya Nadella: Not forget, even if I even approved the budget,
[01:07:45] Satya Nadella: I can't hire all these.
[01:07:46] Satya Nadella: So she did the next best thing.
[01:07:48] Satya Nadella: She just built herself a whole bunch of agents
[01:07:51] Satya Nadella: to automate the DevOps pipeline
[01:07:53] Satya Nadella: of how to deal with the maintenance.
[01:07:55] Satya Nadella: That is an example of your teapot,
[01:07:58] Satya Nadella: a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity.
[01:08:03] Satya Nadella: So if you are question, I will say we will grow a head count.
[01:08:06] Satya Nadella: But the way I look at it is that head count we grow
[01:08:09] Satya Nadella: will grow with a lot more leverage
[01:08:11] Satya Nadella: than the head count we had pre-AI.
[01:08:14] Satya Nadella: And that's the adjustment,
[01:08:16] Satya Nadella: I think structurally or seen first, right?
[01:08:18] Satya Nadella: Which is one, you called it getting fit.
[01:08:20] Satya Nadella: I think of it as more getting to a place
[01:08:24] Satya Nadella: where everybody is really not learning how to rethink
[01:08:28] Satya Nadella: how they work.
[01:08:29] Satya Nadella: And it's the how, not even the what.
[01:08:32] Satya Nadella: Even if the what remains the constant,
[01:08:34] Satya Nadella: how you go about it has to be re-learned.
[01:08:37] Satya Nadella: And it's the unlearning and learning process
[01:08:40] Satya Nadella: that I think will take the next year or so.
[01:08:42] Satya Nadella: Then the head count growth will come with max leverage.
[01:08:47] Yeah, no, it's a, I think we're on the verge
[01:08:49] Brad Gerstner: of incredible economic productivity growth.
[01:08:52] Brad Gerstner: It does feel like when I talk to you or Michael Dell
[01:08:55] Brad Gerstner: that most companies aren't even really in the first inning,
[01:08:58] Brad Gerstner: maybe the first batter in the first inning
[01:09:01] Brad Gerstner: in reworking those workflows
[01:09:03] Brad Gerstner: to get maximum leverage from these agents.
[01:09:05] Brad Gerstner: But it sure feels like over the course of the next two
[01:09:07] Brad Gerstner: to three years, that's where a lot of gains
[01:09:09] Brad Gerstner: are going to start coming from.
[01:09:10] Brad Gerstner: And again, I, you know, I certainly am an optimist.
[01:09:13] Brad Gerstner: I think we're going to have net job gains from all of this.
[01:09:17] Brad Gerstner: But I think for those companies,
[01:09:18] Brad Gerstner: they'll just be able to grow their bottom line,
[01:09:20] Brad Gerstner: their number of employees slower than their top line.
[01:09:23] Brad Gerstner: That is the productivity gain to the company.
[01:09:26] Brad Gerstner: Aggregate all that up.
[01:09:27] Brad Gerstner: That's the productivity gain to the economy.
[01:09:29] Brad Gerstner: And then we'll just take that consumer surplus
[01:09:31] Brad Gerstner: and invest it in creating a lot of things
[01:09:33] Brad Gerstner: that didn't exist before.
[01:09:35] Brad Gerstner: 100%.
[01:09:36] Brad Gerstner: 100%.
[01:09:37] Satya Nadella: Even in software development, right?
[01:09:38] Satya Nadella: One of the things I look at it is no one would say,
[01:09:41] Satya Nadella: we're going to have a challenge in having, you know,
[01:09:44] Satya Nadella: more software engineers contribute to our sort of society
[01:09:48] Satya Nadella: because the reality is you look at the IT backlog
[01:09:50] Satya Nadella: in any organization.
[01:09:52] Satya Nadella: And so the question is, all these software agents
[01:09:55] Satya Nadella: are hopefully going to help us go and take a whack
[01:09:59] Satya Nadella: at all of the IT backlog we have.
[01:10:02] Satya Nadella: And think of that dream of evergreen software
[01:10:05] Satya Nadella: that's going to be true.
[01:10:06] Satya Nadella: And then think about the demand for software.
[01:10:08] Satya Nadella: So I think that to your point,
[01:10:09] Satya Nadella: it's the levels of abstraction
[01:10:11] Satya Nadella: in which knowledge work happens will change.
[01:10:13] Satya Nadella: We will adjust to that, the work and the workflow.
[01:10:17] Satya Nadella: That will then adjust itself,
[01:10:18] Satya Nadella: even in terms of the demand for the products of this industry.
[01:10:22] I'm going to end on this,
[01:10:24] Brad Gerstner: which is really around the reindustrialization of America.
[01:10:26] Brad Gerstner: Now I've said, if you add up the $4 trillion of CAPEX
[01:10:30] Brad Gerstner: that you and so many of the big large US tech companies
[01:10:35] Brad Gerstner: are investing over the course of the next four or five years,
[01:10:37] Brad Gerstner: it's about 10 times the size of the Manhattan Project
[01:10:40] Brad Gerstner: on an inflation adjusted or GDP-adjusted basis.
[01:10:43] Brad Gerstner: So it's a massive undertaking for America.
[01:10:46] Brad Gerstner: The president has made it a real priority
[01:10:48] Brad Gerstner: of his administration to recut the trade deals.
[01:10:52] Brad Gerstner: And it looks like we now have trillions of dollars.
[01:10:54] Brad Gerstner: South Koreans committed $350 billion of investments
[01:10:58] Brad Gerstner: just today into the United States.
[01:11:01] Brad Gerstner: And when you think about what you see going on
[01:11:05] Brad Gerstner: in power in the United States,
[01:11:07] Brad Gerstner: both production, the grid, et cetera,
[01:11:09] Brad Gerstner: what you see going on in terms of this reindustrialization,
[01:11:13] Brad Gerstner: how do you think this is all going?
[01:11:16] Brad Gerstner: And maybe just reflect on where we're landing the plane here,
[01:11:21] Brad Gerstner: your level of optimism for the few years ahead.
[01:11:24] Brad Gerstner: Yeah, I know I feel very optimistic
[01:11:27] Satya Nadella: because in some sense, you know,
[01:11:28] Satya Nadella: Brad Smith was telling me about sort of the economy
[01:11:31] Satya Nadella: around our Wisconsin data center.
[01:11:34] It's fascinating.
[01:11:35] Satya Nadella: Most people think of a data center that is sort of like,
[01:11:37] Satya Nadella: yeah, it's going to be one big warehouse
[01:11:40] Satya Nadella: and there is fully automated.
[01:11:42] Satya Nadella: A lot of it is true,
[01:11:44] Satya Nadella: but first of all, what went into the construction
[01:11:47] Satya Nadella: of that data center and the local supply chain
[01:11:51] Satya Nadella: of the data center?
[01:11:52] Satya Nadella: That is, in some sense,
[01:11:54] Satya Nadella: the reindustrialization of the United States as well.
[01:11:57] Satya Nadella: Even before you get to what is happening in Arizona
[01:12:00] Satya Nadella: with the TSMC plans or what was happening with micron
[01:12:04] Satya Nadella: and their investments in memory or Intel and their fabs
[01:12:07] Satya Nadella: and what have you, right?
[01:12:08] Satya Nadella: There's a lot of stuff that we will want to start building.
[01:12:13] Satya Nadella: Doesn't mean we won't have trade deals
[01:12:15] Satya Nadella: that make sense for the United States with other countries,
[01:12:18] Satya Nadella: but to your point, the reindustrialization for the new economy
[01:12:21] Satya Nadella: and making sure that all the skills
[01:12:24] Satya Nadella: and all that capacity from power on down,
[01:12:28] Satya Nadella: I think is sort of very important, right, for us.
[01:12:31] Satya Nadella: And the other thing that I also said, Brad, it's important,
[01:12:34] Satya Nadella: and this is something that I've had a chance to talk to President Trump
[01:12:38] Satya Nadella: as well as Secretary Lutnik and others,
[01:12:41] Satya Nadella: is it's important to recognize
[01:12:42] Satya Nadella: that we as hyperscalers of the United States
[01:12:45] Satya Nadella: are also investing around the world.
[01:12:47] Satya Nadella: So in other words, the United States
[01:12:50] Satya Nadella: is the biggest investor of compute factories
[01:12:54] Satya Nadella: or token factories around the world,
[01:12:57] Satya Nadella: but not only are we attracting foreign capital
[01:13:00] Satya Nadella: to invest in our country so that we can reindustrialize,
[01:13:03] Satya Nadella: we are helping, whether it's in Europe or in Asia
[01:13:06] Satya Nadella: or elsewhere in Latin America and in Africa,
[01:13:09] Satya Nadella: with our capital investments bringing the best American tech
[01:13:14] Satya Nadella: to the world that they can then innovate on and trust.
[01:13:17] Satya Nadella: And so both of those, I think,
[01:13:19] Satya Nadella: are really both well for the United States long term.
[01:13:23] I'm grateful for your leadership.
[01:13:24] Brad Gerstner: Sam is really helping lead the charge at OpenAI for America.
[01:13:29] Brad Gerstner: I think this is a moment where I look ahead,
[01:13:32] Brad Gerstner: you can see 4% GDP growth on the horizon.
[01:13:34] Brad Gerstner: We'll have our challenges, we'll have our ups and downs.
[01:13:36] Brad Gerstner: These tend to be stairs up rather than a line
[01:13:40] Brad Gerstner: straight up into the right.
[01:13:41] Brad Gerstner: But I for one, see a level of coordination going on
[01:13:44] Brad Gerstner: between Washington and Silicon Valley
[01:13:46] Brad Gerstner: between big tech and the reindustrialization of America
[01:13:50] Brad Gerstner: that gives me cause for incredible hope.
[01:13:51] Brad Gerstner: Watching what happened this week in Asia
[01:13:54] Brad Gerstner: led by the president and his team
[01:13:56] Brad Gerstner: and then watching what's happening here is super exciting.
[01:14:00] Brad Gerstner: So thanks for making the time.
[01:14:01] Brad Gerstner: We're big fans.
[01:14:03] Brad Gerstner: Thanks, thanks, Sasha.
[01:14:05] Thanks so much, Brad.
[01:14:06] Satya Nadella: Thank you.
