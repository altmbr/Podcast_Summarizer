[00:00:28] Brad Gerstner: So like, Flanagan,

[00:01:11] Brad Gerstner: i saw that six and oh
[00:01:13] and i have a lot of duck fans in my uh... in my friend group so i'm gonna
[00:01:18] Bill Gurley: i'm gonna refrain from celebrating with you
[00:01:20] Bill Gurley: i have to say i used to celebrate in huzure basketball but rarely huzure football
[00:01:25] Brad Gerstner: but curt signatis done an unbelievable job turning up program around my
[00:01:29] Brad Gerstner: ninety-year-old mother was watching that game and sending me play by play
[00:01:33] Brad Gerstner: so congrats to congrats to the huzures
[00:01:35] Brad Gerstner: well as long as we're calling out
[00:01:37] Bill Gurley: coach football teams and then we move on
[00:01:40] UCLA starts the season o and four
[00:01:43] Bill Gurley: then updates upsets penned stated home with almost no fans there and wins big
[00:01:48] Bill Gurley: again this week and apparently there was a coaching change after the o and four
[00:01:52] Bill Gurley: so this could be the biggest turnaround history of
[00:01:55] Bill Gurley: uh...
[00:01:56] Bill Gurley: go for it
[00:01:57] Bill Gurley: pretty incredible
[00:01:59] Brad Gerstner: so there's so much happening in the world today we're gonna unpack a few of
[00:02:02] Brad Gerstner: those things
[00:02:03] Brad Gerstner: we're gonna follow up on some of the issues bill that i raised in the jensen pod
[00:02:07] Brad Gerstner: you know the latest a i announcements all this bubble talk circularity of
[00:02:12] Brad Gerstner: revenues
[00:02:13] Brad Gerstner: quality of revenues a i regulation
[00:02:16] Brad Gerstner: but we're also going to do something today cover something we don't often talk
[00:02:19] Brad Gerstner: about on the pod and that's like life and career
[00:02:22] Brad Gerstner: bill you have a huge book coming out
[00:02:24] Brad Gerstner: running down a dream how to thrive in a career you actually love i'm so
[00:02:28] Brad Gerstner: excited for this book
[00:02:30] Brad Gerstner: so we're also going to talk a little bit about that today
[00:02:33] and in the context of that
[00:02:35] Brad Gerstner: you know we're coming up on the two-year anniversary this pod i can't believe it
[00:02:39] Brad Gerstner: time is flown by but are you know when you and i talked about about doing this
[00:02:45] Brad Gerstner: we said our mission really we want to talk about markets investing capitalism
[00:02:49] Brad Gerstner: and companies
[00:02:50] Brad Gerstner: but really through the i in the investment analyst you and i more than anything
[00:02:54] Brad Gerstner: else i think our analysts we try to
[00:02:57] Brad Gerstner: find the biggest problems opportunities challenges in the world study them
[00:03:02] Brad Gerstner: deeply
[00:03:03] Brad Gerstner: you know we compare notes nonstop
[00:03:05] Brad Gerstner: occasionally as an analyst that lead you to a big investment idea
[00:03:09] Brad Gerstner: sometimes it leads you to a podcast maybe writing an article teaching a class
[00:03:13] Brad Gerstner: few writing this book
[00:03:15] Brad Gerstner: and sometimes even a major policy initiative like the invest america act that
[00:03:20] Brad Gerstner: actually became law i think you would agree with me the response over the last
[00:03:24] Brad Gerstner: two years has been amazing more than either you or i expected
[00:03:28] Brad Gerstner: but you know that also creates some pressure of its own to show up
[00:03:32] to deliver those unique insights and this takes a bunch of time
[00:03:35] so given that i don't want to bury the lead here
[00:03:38] Brad Gerstner: you have some huge upcoming projects you want to work on
[00:03:42] Brad Gerstner: and you're going to step back from the co-hosting the pod
[00:03:45] Brad Gerstner: i'll still talk you in on occasion maybe to be in a guest
[00:03:49] Brad Gerstner: but you're freeing up time to work on your big passions like this book
[00:03:53] Brad Gerstner: and going deeper into these topics that people have heard you talk about here
[00:03:57] Brad Gerstner: us china relations
[00:03:59] Brad Gerstner: talking about regulatory capture the dysfunctional state of us health care
[00:04:04] Brad Gerstner: and for those interested the pods mission remains the same
[00:04:07] Brad Gerstner: i'm going to keep the same name
[00:04:09] Brad Gerstner: we're going to keep chopping it up with analyst i respect sometimes with bill
[00:04:13] Brad Gerstner: and covering topics that matter you know like last week's pod with jensen
[00:04:17] Brad Gerstner: and whang or upcoming pods i have with sam altman or satya
[00:04:22] this is a moment of i think really unique consequence we both recognize that
[00:04:26] Brad Gerstner: we're grateful to have the opportunity to open source these conversations that are
[00:04:31] Brad Gerstner: truly shaping the future
[00:04:33] and i know i speak for you we do it for the love of the game like this keeps us
[00:04:36] Brad Gerstner: sharp it keeps us on edge
[00:04:39] you know and it's a privilege really to get on here and chop it up and share
[00:04:42] Brad Gerstner: something back with the tech ecosystem
[00:04:44] Brad Gerstner: that gives us you know it's given us so much so
[00:04:47] Brad Gerstner: bill you know you have anything you want to say
[00:04:50] Brad Gerstner: sure yeah first of all just thanks to you Brad like this has been great going
[00:04:55] Bill Gurley: back and forth i had two primary initiatives coming into it one
[00:04:59] as you mentioned was to stay sharp and the other one was to share and give back
[00:05:03] Bill Gurley: and
[00:05:03] Bill Gurley: i've been writing my thoughts on on the tech industry since i was a cell
[00:05:08] Bill Gurley: site analyst so
[00:05:10] Bill Gurley: coming up on thirty years and always enjoyed thinking out loud i think it
[00:05:15] Bill Gurley: makes us better as analysts and helps us to understand
[00:05:18] Bill Gurley: but i also like to share with people and
[00:05:21] Bill Gurley: there's no question in my mind that this got bigger than i ever anticipated
[00:05:25] Bill Gurley: it would have been chased down in international cities and recently i was
[00:05:30] Bill Gurley: i started talking with someone they had no idea what i looked like but the
[00:05:34] Bill Gurley: minute they heard my voice they're like oh you're the guy for the podcast so
[00:05:37] Bill Gurley: it has been popular and i know there are going to be people that are upset
[00:05:44] Bill Gurley: with me and that i can only say you know i'm sorry and i apologize that i'm not
[00:05:50] Bill Gurley: going to be doing it anymore i came across this quote that was really
[00:05:53] Bill Gurley: inspiring to me it said life begins where your comfort zone ends and there
[00:05:59] Bill Gurley: were a number of people that helped push me to write the book it's taken up
[00:06:03] Bill Gurley: quite a bit of time in the last eight years it's been a very long project
[00:06:07] Bill Gurley: we'll talk about it more later but i'm feeling a calling to go work on or at least attempt to work
[00:06:12] Bill Gurley: on some of these bigger issues so i want to create a platform for that i want to create room for it
[00:06:17] Bill Gurley: and and move a bit away from the space that i do know quite well and love quite a bit but
[00:06:23] Bill Gurley: pushing myself you know outside of my own comfort zone and hopefully you know having an impact
[00:06:28] Bill Gurley: on things that really matter you and i talked about this throughout the entire time i was working
[00:06:33] Brad Gerstner: on invest america i certainly encourage you and push you to to do this i think you have an
[00:06:38] Brad Gerstner: enormous amount to contribute and listen when i you know you and i chop it up together every day i
[00:06:43] Brad Gerstner: know where you stand on a lot of these issues i'll bring those opinions to bear for our audience
[00:06:47] Brad Gerstner: and you know i certainly know that you'll have the burning need to come on as a guest on occasion and
[00:06:53] Brad Gerstner: and share some of those views but but in the spirit of analysis let's let's just dive in
[00:06:59] Brad Gerstner: this ai money bubble bill on this jensen pod let's start by talking about that you know we've had
[00:07:05] Brad Gerstner: a just a flurry of announcements including another announcement this morning between open a i
[00:07:10] Brad Gerstner: and broadcom where open a i is going to be building their own inference accelerator
[00:07:15] Brad Gerstner: amounting to well over a trillion dollars of incremental capex that's above and beyond what we
[00:07:20] Brad Gerstner: already knew was going to get built out i know that you have concerns about the level of capex
[00:07:26] Brad Gerstner: the absolute level and i know that you also have meaningful concerns about how it's being financed
[00:07:33] Brad Gerstner: why don't you walk us through your major concerns i think anybody that's been a student of financial
[00:07:39] Bill Gurley: history has you know studied different types of activities that that historically let's just say
[00:07:47] Bill Gurley: historically of created red flags and the reason that you know any ai you talk to would know what
[00:07:55] Bill Gurley: you mean if you said circular revenues is because someone has used it in the past in a way that
[00:08:01] Bill Gurley: that wasn't good and you know i had an exercise which i tweeted we can put in the show and those
[00:08:06] Bill Gurley: people can find but i just described you know there's not one thing there's like six different
[00:08:12] Bill Gurley: transactions that have happened now that i would say are non-normal and i just described those
[00:08:18] Bill Gurley: things to chat you be t and ask it for its analysis both as an accountant and as a financial investor
[00:08:24] Bill Gurley: and the ai itself you know would would find its way toward company names like in ron and world
[00:08:31] Bill Gurley: common those kind of things merely by describing the type of transaction and so i think that's suggest
[00:08:37] Bill Gurley: if we believe in intelligent ai that that's just what historically has been come the best practice
[00:08:44] Bill Gurley: in a way to think about these things and i've told you before i think you you have highlighted that
[00:08:50] Bill Gurley: some of the multiples are actually not that high and i think this is part of the reason because
[00:08:55] Bill Gurley: there are red flags that people are looking at if you peel that back a little bit more you know one
[00:09:00] Brad Gerstner: of the things that you and i've talked about the very nature you know of round tripping or circular
[00:09:06] Brad Gerstner: revenues you know i think there's this continuum on one end of the trend on one end of the continuum
[00:09:11] Brad Gerstner: is a true sham transaction there's no underlying demand for the product i send you a billion
[00:09:16] Brad Gerstner: dollars you send me the billion dollars back right that's clearly a sham transaction because
[00:09:22] Brad Gerstner: there's no underlying demand on the other end i have massive demand for my product you have plenty
[00:09:26] Brad Gerstner: of places you can go get capital and we just happen to have an investment relationship in addition
[00:09:32] Brad Gerstner: to that and i'm buying your product and those things happen all over the place in our economy
[00:09:38] Brad Gerstner: and you know maybe something to pay attention to but it's certainly not even close to being illegal
[00:09:42] Brad Gerstner: and it frankly doesn't even cause me a lot of concerns about the quality of revenue and then we
[00:09:47] Brad Gerstner: have things in the middle right these things in the middle where you can ask a question like would
[00:09:52] Brad Gerstner: this much of revenue or product had been purchased but for this investment right and i think that
[00:09:58] Brad Gerstner: at a minimum calls the revenue the quality of those revenues into questions so when you look at that
[00:10:04] Brad Gerstner: do you discriminate between the types of transactions that have been announced i mean you raised
[00:10:08] Brad Gerstner: this question first 18 months ago about the credits transactions that were occurring with the
[00:10:13] Brad Gerstner: hyper scaler so maybe just unpack a few of the different types of transactions yeah and look i
[00:10:19] Bill Gurley: think it started at the very beginning and and i think that's one of the things that's causing this
[00:10:25] Bill Gurley: is it's become part of the competitive landscape and the competitive dynamic so i think there are
[00:10:31] Bill Gurley: many boards and many cfo's who have been put in a position where they say well if we don't do it
[00:10:37] Bill Gurley: everyone else is doing it you might fall behind but it but it started with the original from my
[00:10:43] Bill Gurley: perspective with the original Microsoft open a ideal where credits go in as a in kind investment
[00:10:50] Bill Gurley: and then those credits are used back against you know Azure and and Microsoft Cloud services and
[00:10:57] Bill Gurley: in that case you know and i said it back then i'll say it again now that's a revenue that's a
[00:11:02] Bill Gurley: cashless transaction like there's no cash but it becomes an income statement uh revenue item
[00:11:10] Bill Gurley: for Microsoft and i don't think that's ideal from an economic standpoint and that practice is now
[00:11:18] Bill Gurley: i think happened at amazon and happened at google i think they've made investments and other
[00:11:24] Bill Gurley: ai startups with the same kind of thing and at the very least it drives usage of their product versus
[00:11:31] Bill Gurley: someone else um and in the worst case you know it creates revenue that might not have existed
[00:11:37] Bill Gurley: had had it not been for that deal or at least not on those terms um but anyway it started there
[00:11:43] Bill Gurley: it's become quite competitive now there's an interesting podcast on plain simple which i don't
[00:11:49] Bill Gurley: plain English which is uh uh uh uh in the bill simmonds family with paul kodroski and he
[00:11:57] Bill Gurley: he makes the argument that part of the reason these transactions are taking place i think this is
[00:12:02] Bill Gurley: a credible argument he makes is because some of these players have already put so much capex so much
[00:12:10] Bill Gurley: debt on themselves that they don't want to take the next step and so in that case you know you have
[00:12:16] Bill Gurley: reached some level where the company's saying oops you know i feel uncomfortable going further in
[00:12:22] Bill Gurley: this the transaction that comes my mind when i think of that is there was one where microsoft
[00:12:28] Bill Gurley: i mean meta agreed to pay for the failure of debt on a facility where they don't own the debt
[00:12:36] you know and to me that's classic off balance sheet financing if they own the risk of it
[00:12:40] Bill Gurley: just because they don't own the paper you know it i don't see the difference really but this is like
[00:12:46] Bill Gurley: i said this is happening in a in a lot of different places you know one of the things that you
[00:12:51] Brad Gerstner: you know again i've talked about a little bit on all in and other places if i look at the nvidia
[00:12:56] Brad Gerstner: deal as an example bill video has the opportunity to invest though not the obligation to invest open
[00:13:02] Brad Gerstner: a i has the opportunity to use their chips though not the obligation to use their chips as evidence by
[00:13:07] Brad Gerstner: the fact they just announced their own chip this morning and they just cut off a huge deal with AMD
[00:13:12] Brad Gerstner: you know in the case of nvidia you're not talking about a highly levered business is a company
[00:13:16] Brad Gerstner: that's going to generate 450 billion dollars of free cash and is taking a small fraction of that over
[00:13:23] Brad Gerstner: the next three years and investing in companies that it it thinks are good returning investments i
[00:13:28] Brad Gerstner: mean google and google capital have been doing this for you know for years et cetera so again i
[00:13:33] Brad Gerstner: think in those cases you can say for certain that maybe you know more of their product is being
[00:13:39] Brad Gerstner: consumed than would have otherwise been consumed right you know we saw this announcement last week
[00:13:45] Brad Gerstner: where they're investing in this xai with respect to their new round most of these companies that
[00:13:50] Brad Gerstner: they're investing in i think have the economic wherewithal to raise the capital in other places
[00:13:56] Brad Gerstner: Elon could certainly raise it in other places open a i was well over subscribed so they could have
[00:14:02] Brad Gerstner: raised it in other places but here's what i think people should be on the lookout for okay so
[00:14:07] Brad Gerstner: where would i have more concern okay now imagine there's a chip there there's only one customer
[00:14:16] Brad Gerstner: for so there's not a lot of demand for the chip and that that chip manufacturer gives a customer
[00:14:22] Brad Gerstner: ten billion dollars and that customer turns around and buys that chip right so there's no other
[00:14:28] Brad Gerstner: potential customers and the the buyer would not have had the ability to buy it but for that capital
[00:14:35] Brad Gerstner: that to me raises big red flags and i do think in this overall ecosystem the reason i'm happy
[00:14:42] Brad Gerstner: you're bringing it up i think one of the things we need to do to keep the wall of worry there to
[00:14:47] Brad Gerstner: keep the excesses from emerging is to call them out i'm not concerned as a shareholder in
[00:14:52] Brad Gerstner: Nvidia with what i'm seeing in video due today i like how they're deploying their cash on their
[00:14:57] Brad Gerstner: balance sheet but i do think that as you go further and further out the risk curve right further
[00:15:03] Brad Gerstner: and further to the startup neo clouds or further and further to start up chips you know etc
[00:15:09] Brad Gerstner: where people to your point are a little bit more desperate for capital don't have the balance sheets
[00:15:14] Brad Gerstner: don't have the market leadership position i would not be surprised at all in this moment to see
[00:15:19] Brad Gerstner: more of those yellow flags emerge there's a couple things you know that i would say in response one
[00:15:25] Bill Gurley: there's a reason we know about a lot of these things and that's because some auditor somewhere
[00:15:30] Bill Gurley: made them disclose them like they felt that it was abnormal enough to require disclosure second
[00:15:37] Bill Gurley: i heard i listened to you and and the all-in team talk about this issue i do think investment
[00:15:44] Bill Gurley: is riskier or more risk seeking than customer loans which it was compared to and Cisco got in trouble
[00:15:50] Bill Gurley: just with the customer loans because they were giving loans to startups who really didn't have the
[00:15:55] Bill Gurley: wherewithal to pay them back but when that's really the issue for me though when you switch from
[00:15:59] Bill Gurley: a loan to an equity you no longer have to pay it back so in some ways it's it's easier on the
[00:16:06] Bill Gurley: purchaser than if you had a loan themselves but but here's my here's my bottom line the i think what
[00:16:12] Bill Gurley: this does this this overall situation is first of all i think it's driven by competition at this
[00:16:18] Bill Gurley: point and like the first the first step into the gray zone was way back at the beginning and so
[00:16:24] Bill Gurley: now i think we're we're fairly pregnant with it so i think it's a competitive dynamic i think it
[00:16:29] Bill Gurley: increases the chance that we go over the top that that we end up over provisioning and i kind of
[00:16:35] Bill Gurley: felt like that was unavoidable anyway but now i think it's higher and but i think it maybe pushes out
[00:16:40] Bill Gurley: when we find out that happens because you you've just created more virtual leverage on the whole
[00:16:47] Bill Gurley: system and you might be hiding some of the signs that would tell you things are slowing down i'll give
[00:16:53] Bill Gurley: you a great example one of the more peculiar of all the deals is and this was disclosed in a core
[00:16:59] Bill Gurley: weave filing was Nvidia has promised to buy any of core weaves service availability that they
[00:17:06] Bill Gurley: can't sell to anyone else that is very unusual that's not the same as making an investment that could
[00:17:12] Bill Gurley: easily help core weave with their debtors and getting more debt financing but it also means as a
[00:17:19] Bill Gurley: investor we don't know what's going on with real demand for core weave because we probably won't
[00:17:26] Bill Gurley: be told if they start moving into the world where they're offloading 10 video or not and if you
[00:17:33] Bill Gurley: to said to me what would you look for to see if we've you know kind of reached a point where things
[00:17:38] Bill Gurley: are slowing a little bit you could say well let's look at one of the pure plays uh and so now
[00:17:43] Bill Gurley: that's muddy you can see how it it could be but i i would expect that every analyst on every core we've
[00:17:49] Brad Gerstner: called for the next you know eight quarters maybe thanks to you you just raising the flag is going
[00:17:55] Brad Gerstner: to be asking the question right do you see any slowing are you having to send any of your of your
[00:18:02] Brad Gerstner: demand to Nvidia you know as a result of this i mean one of the things i like about this as well
[00:18:07] Brad Gerstner: right these are public companies both core weave and Nvidia it is a disclosed transactions not
[00:18:12] Brad Gerstner: like this stuff's occurring in the dark and i people can ask the questions of this you know this
[00:18:18] Brad Gerstner: with regard to demand and i will tell you there is the the amount of money that is being spent
[00:18:25] Brad Gerstner: to track every single part of this supply chain from Taiwan to the united states i mean look at
[00:18:32] Brad Gerstner: Dylan Patel's business at semi-analysis the thing is exploded the amount of money people are
[00:18:38] Brad Gerstner: spending just to stay on top of this and the second they see something that smacks of any you
[00:18:43] Brad Gerstner: know leakage and demand boom docks fall and and warnings go up so i think it's a good point
[00:18:50] Brad Gerstner: but i think yet let me transition because i do want to talk about this question of demand so
[00:18:54] Brad Gerstner: on the one hand there's this question about quality of revenues on the other question is
[00:18:58] Brad Gerstner: are we over building so let's show this chart again this is basically the three trillion dollars of
[00:19:04] Brad Gerstner: build out expected over the next five years this is the capex chart that we've shown here before to
[00:19:11] Brad Gerstner: put that in perspective bill that's about 60 gigs right because we we now are normalizing
[00:19:17] Brad Gerstner: everything's to gigawatts of data center so that's about 60 gigs it's not all incremental a lot of
[00:19:22] Brad Gerstner: that is is is replacement or upgrade keep that in mind the second is this chart of Nvidia revenues
[00:19:29] Brad Gerstner: this is the Nvidia cell side forecast okay forecast this year is for about 200 billion in revenues
[00:19:36] Brad Gerstner: growing to about 350 billion in revenues over the next five years so this year that means that
[00:19:43] Brad Gerstner: they're selling about four to five gigs worth of compute and again most of that's incremental
[00:19:49] Brad Gerstner: but it's not all incremental and that would grow to nine gigs of compute nine in 2029 2030 so that's
[00:19:56] Brad Gerstner: 350 or 400 billion that's the Nvidia consensus revenue forecast right and i asked jensen on the
[00:20:05] Brad Gerstner: pod about this and i said what is the chance that we get into a glut over the course of you know the
[00:20:12] Brad Gerstner: next four or five years and we'll play the you know the piece but he basically said there's zero
[00:20:18] Brad Gerstner: chance over the next two to three years because all the build out will go to the biggest hyper
[00:20:22] Brad Gerstner: scalars with the biggest balance sheets in the world and they're building it to to run their core
[00:20:27] Brad Gerstner: businesses we haven't even got into the full amount with respect to these new generative AI
[00:20:33] Brad Gerstner: workloads what is the percentage probability that you think we'll have a glut we'll run into a glut
[00:20:39] Brad Gerstner: in the next three or four or five years until we fully convert all general purpose computing
[00:20:52] to exalready computing an AI until we do that yes i think the chances are extremely low okay
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_01: here's a question i have for you did you hear anything in the last couple of weeks
[00:21:03] Brad Gerstner: that caused you to believe that we're on the verge of some bubble bursting or we're greatly over
[00:21:08] Brad Gerstner: building or or anything else or is it just the flags are up and now it's a wait and see
[00:21:13] Brad Gerstner: yes so it's funny they had our marks on cmbc this morning i'm a huge however marks fan and ask
[00:21:20] Bill Gurley: him this question and he he said look multiples are too low to for this to be you can't be on
[00:21:27] Bill Gurley: bubble watch if the multiples aren't high enough and you've been making this point for a long time
[00:21:31] Bill Gurley: and i would say like you'd have to be a fool not to notice that these numbers you're talking about
[00:21:38] Bill Gurley: are so remarkably unprecedented from anything we've ever seen before they are massive you know i
[00:21:46] Bill Gurley: i've talked about you know to see the mag seven go from being massive cash producers to where
[00:21:53] Bill Gurley: there's many of them are taking the majority of their free cash flow and cap acts it's it's
[00:21:58] Bill Gurley: it's totally new and clearly everyone believes that this wave is maybe bigger than the previous waves
[00:22:06] Bill Gurley: we've seen that have led to so much value creation so all that's happening i like to believe that
[00:22:12] Bill Gurley: it's okay to recognize that the market's great and still think that these transactions shouldn't
[00:22:19] Bill Gurley: happen this way and i'm i'm able to keep both those things in my head at the same time i i think i
[00:22:26] Brad Gerstner: think it's a super fair point by the way you just mentioned it so we'll include this chart
[00:22:30] Brad Gerstner: this is mag five cap x as a percentage of their operating free cash flow bill and if you look at it
[00:22:37] Brad Gerstner: in twenty twenty five so that's this year they'll spend about sixty six percent of their operating cash
[00:22:45] Brad Gerstner: flow on cap x yeah right and if you look at the the the consensus forecast for their cap x relative
[00:22:52] Brad Gerstner: to their operating cash flow this is the peak so around sixty six percent has it going down to
[00:22:59] Brad Gerstner: about forty five or fifty percent now embedded in there is they're going to keep growing their
[00:23:03] Brad Gerstner: operating free cash flow at fifteen to twenty percent a year right so there's still room for them
[00:23:08] Brad Gerstner: to to grow with that coming down but i think that is another thing to keep your eye on how much are
[00:23:14] Brad Gerstner: they spending and by the way just give you an order of magnitude bill in twenty twenty three their
[00:23:19] Brad Gerstner: total cap x was a hundred and fifty six billion and this year it's three hundred and seventy nine
[00:23:26] Brad Gerstner: billion right so radical step up in in your point a good one and just remember a couple years ago
[00:23:33] Brad Gerstner: in twenty twenty two one met a stepped up their cap x spending on reality labs the stock got obliterated
[00:23:42] Brad Gerstner: because people said what the hell are you doing this is all about free cash flow for share per share
[00:23:46] Brad Gerstner: including myself i was saying you know tell you let's get fit here let's drive more free cash flow
[00:23:52] Brad Gerstner: out of the business you know so much so that the cfo sent me a hat that says free cash flow right so
[00:23:58] Brad Gerstner: they got real about free cash flow but there's a difference between investing that free cash flow
[00:24:03] Brad Gerstner: in data centers in a i then there was in reality labs as an investor let me just tell you my own
[00:24:09] Brad Gerstner: perspective the reason metastox doing great notwithstanding going back to high levels of cap x pen
[00:24:15] Brad Gerstner: is because now the investors understand it and believe in it we're seeing the benefits right in
[00:24:21] Brad Gerstner: the earnings of the business they're growing the earnings of the business they don't have to hire
[00:24:25] Brad Gerstner: a lot of new employees and so it's it's fundamentally different than the cap x that was going into
[00:24:30] Brad Gerstner: reality labs where investors were saying hold on a second we're going to spend a hundred plus
[00:24:35] Brad Gerstner: billion dollars over the next five years we don't even know what we're building right we don't
[00:24:39] know what it will be worth at the end of the day so i think for now at least there's enough belief in
[00:24:45] Brad Gerstner: the the byproduct of generative a i because people are using chat GPT they're seeing the utility
[00:24:51] Brad Gerstner: in the enterprise that they're going you know that they're willing to tolerate these companies
[00:24:56] Brad Gerstner: giving over half of their free cash flow into these buildouts i do think another dynamic is the
[00:25:02] Bill Gurley: race condition created by the competitive dynamic and it appears from where i sit and you don't
[00:25:08] Bill Gurley: need to comment because you're an investor and and maybe have more information than i do you probably
[00:25:13] Bill Gurley: have more information than i do but it appears to me that open AI through all these partnerships and
[00:25:19] Bill Gurley: announcements is trying to create escape velocity you know and that could be against the model
[00:25:25] Bill Gurley: providers it could be against a hosting provider depending on how you think the market plays out
[00:25:31] Bill Gurley: it could could be on the consumer side it could be on the API side but it'll it creates an
[00:25:36] Bill Gurley: interesting stress test for anyone else in the ecosystem to say are you going to lay chase
[00:25:42] Bill Gurley: because of all the numbers you laid out there they're they're gargantuan and it'll be interesting
[00:25:48] Bill Gurley: that's my opinion it just feels like they're they're daring people to to follow them and and
[00:25:53] Bill Gurley: I suspect a bunch don't it may work well it's you've seen this before i know we've talked about
[00:25:59] Brad Gerstner: many times on here this was and lift um ultimately i think a couple of things to remember these
[00:26:05] Brad Gerstner: these announcements are frameworks it allows people to begin working but they're not etched in stone
[00:26:11] Brad Gerstner: these are not contractual obligations you know everybody's got to deliver their parts if the
[00:26:16] Brad Gerstner: demand comes in lower than these people are not going you know uh leeson's work one have to be
[00:26:21] Bill Gurley: contractual for it to be RPO yeah you know you may know well for sure i shouldn't say that they're all
[00:26:28] Brad Gerstner: right frameworks but i i know for example like in the case of AMD they're going to have to deliver
[00:26:32] Brad Gerstner: a workable chip or you're not going to build six gigs work right uh in the case of this broad
[00:26:37] Brad Gerstner: announcement obviously they have to build a workable chip so i think your speculation and again
[00:26:44] Brad Gerstner: it makes sense to me if you said what are the advantages of getting out there and locking up all
[00:26:49] Brad Gerstner: of these deals right i can't imagine it doesn't help a lot with recruiting all the best researchers in
[00:26:56] Brad Gerstner: the world want to work at the place that has the most compute and so you want to lock up the compute i
[00:27:01] Brad Gerstner: i have to imagine it helps with the supply chain because you know now you're you're locking up that
[00:27:06] Brad Gerstner: supply i think your speculation is a pretty big one a pretty good one but at the end of the day
[00:27:12] Brad Gerstner: if you add up all these deals i tried to do this and we may be we may be off by a bit and i'd
[00:27:18] Brad Gerstner: encourage people have a better estimate to let me know but if you add them all up it looks like to
[00:27:22] Brad Gerstner: me open a i would be on the hook for like a hundred and fifty billion of cap ex in 2030 okay
[00:27:29] Brad Gerstner: and so like the question is bill what how much revenue do they need in 2030 to justify a hundred
[00:27:34] Brad Gerstner: you know a hundred and fifty billion in cap ex well i think you would need at least a hundred and
[00:27:38] Brad Gerstner: fifty billion of revenue right and you know like at a minimum we just talked about met in these
[00:27:44] Brad Gerstner: companies spending sixty six percent on cap ex but if they add a hundred and fifty billion of revenue
[00:27:49] Brad Gerstner: then the question is is it plausible they could have a hundred and fifty billion dollars of revenue
[00:27:54] Brad Gerstner: in 2030 and i would argue as an investor that it's it's more than more than plausible that they could
[00:27:59] Brad Gerstner: have a hundred and fifty billion in revenue but i think it makes it very very difficult for anybody
[00:28:04] Brad Gerstner: else other than the hyperscalers obviously Google's going to be there obviously meta is going to be
[00:28:10] Brad Gerstner: there obviously amazon you know can be there but it makes it very very difficult for anybody else in
[00:28:16] Brad Gerstner: the ecosystem right who believes this is a game of of scale compute compete so i think your point's
[00:28:22] Brad Gerstner: a good one maybe maybe shift a little bit you know the area of passion for both you and i which is
[00:28:29] Brad Gerstner: this a i regulation we've talked on the pod many times about the concerning patchwork of these
[00:28:36] Brad Gerstner: emerging state regulations under the guise of doing good and maybe they're even well intention
[00:28:42] Brad Gerstner: cause a hell of a lot more confusion at best and at worst they set back our leading frontier labs
[00:28:49] Brad Gerstner: you know and and really hamper us in the race to to stay in the in the lead in global AI well it's
[00:28:55] Brad Gerstner: gone from more theoretical to now more pro more problematic i tweeted over the weekend in particular
[00:29:01] Brad Gerstner: about this Colorado AI act which is now passed into law signed into law it defines something called
[00:29:07] Brad Gerstner: algorithmic discrimination by outlining these 12 protected classes of course age color religion but
[00:29:14] Brad Gerstner: also limited proficiency in English language reproductive health and basically said if the
[00:29:21] Brad Gerstner: algal provides info right if the chatbot provides information that's used to discriminate then there's
[00:29:28] Brad Gerstner: liability back at the frontier model level right and just this morning Gavin Newsom signed
[00:29:35] Brad Gerstner: sp243 which mandates safety protocols for a i chatbot companions and gives any consumer a private
[00:29:43] Brad Gerstner: right of action to sue these companies for any emotional harm that comes out of a chatbot i mean i
[00:29:50] Brad Gerstner: shit you know you can't make this stuff up you said recently that china is so competitive with the
[00:29:56] Brad Gerstner: United States because it's run by engineers and america's run by lawyers and that's the greatest
[00:30:02] Brad Gerstner: risk we have talk to us about the need for federal preemption and you know again just let's
[00:30:08] Brad Gerstner: dive back into your concern about these two laws that were just passed as an aside i just consumed
[00:30:15] Bill Gurley: Jonathan ii's book uh anxious generation where he talks about what he believes is some social harms
[00:30:22] Bill Gurley: caused by some of the apps on the internet ecosystem and i do think a lot of the passion for
[00:30:30] Bill Gurley: writing some of these states laws comes from that place like there are local congressmen that
[00:30:35] Bill Gurley: did feel like they should have been out in front of social media more and so they want to get a
[00:30:40] Bill Gurley: jump on this and and i think some of that comes from there you run this massive risk of trying
[00:30:46] Bill Gurley: to regulate a brand new technology at a state by state level and you know you could ask yourself
[00:30:54] Bill Gurley: you know and and by the way i i've said this a lot about policy the intent of the policy is different
[00:31:01] Bill Gurley: from what happens once the policy is implemented and so people can come in with great intentions
[00:31:07] Bill Gurley: and this goes back to my speech at all in on regulatory capture and you can end up with the exact
[00:31:13] Bill Gurley: opposite outcome of what you intended because you just don't know enough about the way you write
[00:31:18] Bill Gurley: the regulation right now a lot of people believe we're in this global competition to to see you know
[00:31:26] Bill Gurley: whose tech stack for a i is used on a global basis and if we implement 50s different state rules
[00:31:36] Bill Gurley: that these companies have to jump through and companies that are that are competitors that are
[00:31:41] Bill Gurley: competing in the broader world don't have any of them there is zero chance that's not going to
[00:31:46] Bill Gurley: create mud and slow down the us players there's just zero chance and i'm certain the people that are
[00:31:52] Bill Gurley: writing these laws don't understand that there might be some global you know consequence of what
[00:31:59] Bill Gurley: they're doing but but it's bad i mean i can remember when obama was excited about removing some
[00:32:06] Bill Gurley: of the state by state requirements on like hairstyles and whatnot because it makes it such that they
[00:32:13] Bill Gurley: can't move between states and it's kind of ridiculous that they would have different laws and
[00:32:18] Bill Gurley: different licenses this is like if that's a problem this is really a problem and so i you know
[00:32:25] Bill Gurley: from a global competitor standpoint i would certainly hope that that they're able to federalize
[00:32:32] Bill Gurley: this and preempt it i don't know if it's there's too much you know water under the bridge or not
[00:32:37] Bill Gurley: i don't know enough about what it takes in congress to make that happen but i think this is bad for
[00:32:43] i think it's bad for the u.s and i think it's bad for innovation broadly it's going to make it
[00:32:48] Bill Gurley: harder for startups to do things just because they're going to have to worry about all this stuff
[00:32:54] Bill Gurley: it's it's way worse for little tech right because smaller companies don't have failings as of lawyers
[00:32:59] Brad Gerstner: they can you know go out and comply you know i think the other thing is listen we already have the
[00:33:04] Brad Gerstner: civil rights act we have the fair housing act we have the american with disabilities act of course
[00:33:08] Brad Gerstner: we don't want discrimination but this just seems like brought over reach it's no i like i don't
[00:33:13] Brad Gerstner: even know how you comply or enforce and so it just ends up bogging down the entire system in uncertainty
[00:33:20] Brad Gerstner: and litigation and again it's important to say this isn't even about whether or not a i should be
[00:33:25] Brad Gerstner: regulated it's just a question who should regulate it and what we're saying is that you know there
[00:33:32] Brad Gerstner: is ample opportunity for this administration and congress to get together and write legislation to
[00:33:38] Brad Gerstner: the extent it needs to be written right to provide a national these are inherently interstate
[00:33:44] Brad Gerstner: technologies there's no way to keep it in a single state and so write a piece of national
[00:33:49] Brad Gerstner: legislation that allows us to continue moving forward very quickly but all the sudden at the
[00:33:54] Brad Gerstner: same time addresses any of these concerns i frankly think we need us we need a moratorium
[00:34:00] Brad Gerstner: on all state laws post-pone all state laws until the federal government has time to act
[00:34:05] Brad Gerstner: and if states are going to pass these laws bill then i wonder whether or not open a i or some other
[00:34:11] Brad Gerstner: company should consider blocking the citizens of those states until it's resolved at the national
[00:34:17] Brad Gerstner: level somebody needs to get the attention of these states that they can't do this on a state by state
[00:34:23] Brad Gerstner: level it's bad for the companies it's bad for the country but hopefully we'll get action out of
[00:34:27] Brad Gerstner: congress soon i think there's good momentum we almost had it passed as part of the i think the
[00:34:32] Brad Gerstner: big beautiful bill yeah and so i think there's a lot of movement afoot in order to do it i wanted to
[00:34:38] Brad Gerstner: highlight it because i think it's it's one of the high priority issues facing the new congress
[00:34:43] Brad Gerstner: all this a i all the time stuff bill and you you paint me and you said hey i want to talk about
[00:34:48] Brad Gerstner: stablecoin right yeah we have this parallel development in the world so i think if we have three major
[00:34:53] Brad Gerstner: trends in the world a i is clearly the largest super cycle going on the reindustrialization of
[00:35:00] Brad Gerstner: america is massive all these critical supply chains and i would say the third one is kind of the
[00:35:05] Brad Gerstner: digitization and tokenization of finance and it's going on as a result of the administration
[00:35:11] Brad Gerstner: basically turning 180 degrees from where the Biden administration was total support of crypto
[00:35:17] Brad Gerstner: and the bipartisan genius act so here are a couple facts and figures you know to throw your way
[00:35:22] Brad Gerstner: and then i'll let you take it over total stablecoin supply is now over three hundred billion dollars
[00:35:28] Brad Gerstner: up from basically zero in 2021 and this is dollar for dollar back stablecoin correct adhering to
[00:35:35] Bill Gurley: the new policy yep and total settled is now over eighteen trillion monthly stablecoin senders is
[00:35:43] Brad Gerstner: now close to thirty million and circle and tether are issuing fifteen billion of stable per month
[00:35:50] Brad Gerstner: and becoming the largest buyers of us treasuries so that's how much they're increasing the pool of
[00:35:56] Bill Gurley: capital they hold to to back up the stable stablecoin yes right and i will show this visa dashboard
[00:36:04] Brad Gerstner: you know it's really cool for tracking all of this activity of course stripe after the purchase
[00:36:09] Brad Gerstner: of bridge has gone all in on stable they just unveiled this new stablecoin issuance tools and
[00:36:14] Brad Gerstner: expanded into a i commerce with open a i that could have some stable implications so what are
[00:36:19] Brad Gerstner: your spidey senses telling you about the consequences of what i think is a dramatic change in where
[00:36:25] Brad Gerstner: we're headed well one thing i i think that that many people who listen to the podcast might say
[00:36:31] Bill Gurley: oh look a girly jumping on the crypto train because i have not been a bull and so to to them you
[00:36:37] Bill Gurley: know kudos think you know forgetting it right i had no idea you would have this dramatic a shift
[00:36:44] Bill Gurley: in policy it's probably one of the biggest shifts we've ever seen in uh in financial policy
[00:36:50] Bill Gurley: and and quite frankly i've always felt like and this i think it's still to play out that the
[00:36:56] Bill Gurley: financial incumbents in the u.s. are really good at regulatory capture and preventing themselves
[00:37:01] Bill Gurley: from getting disrupted which is part of why i've been surprised something that really raised my eye
[00:37:06] Bill Gurley: that made me pay attention to this which seems far away there was a a a move by the trump
[00:37:13] Bill Gurley: administration to criticize brazil for the success of picks and i've talked about picks in the past
[00:37:20] Bill Gurley: picks is a digital clears immediately um interbanking product offered by the brazilian government
[00:37:28] Bill Gurley: that didn't exist five years ago and is wildly successful yeah it was mirrored after the same
[00:37:34] Bill Gurley: programs that was built in the uk 17 years ago called usk faster payments who we've talked about
[00:37:40] Bill Gurley: and these programs exist in china and india as well and because of the regulatory capture none of
[00:37:46] Bill Gurley: this has ever happened in the u.s. your a.c.h. takes three days to settle your wire costs $25
[00:37:53] Bill Gurley: for domestic $50 for international and you have to fill out pages and pages of crackling sometimes
[00:37:59] Bill Gurley: get a verbal and and and and it's you know we are so behind i am going to go out on a lemon say
[00:38:06] Bill Gurley: i hope someone whoever agitated this to happen in the trump administration is someone who
[00:38:13] Bill Gurley: is kind of caught in a regulatory capture position getting lobbied by somebody i i think if the
[00:38:19] Bill Gurley: trump administration studied this they shouldn't be critical of picks they should be envious of it
[00:38:24] Bill Gurley: we should have done this a long time ago with fed now but we may be on the verge of stable coin
[00:38:30] Bill Gurley: just being able to do this anyway and the rails have tons of transaction on them as you've talked
[00:38:36] Bill Gurley: about we have this interesting situation where coin base and circle have done this deal where
[00:38:43] Bill Gurley: coin base will allow you to earn 4% on your stable coin balance which you know to get that kind
[00:38:49] Bill Gurley: of return at another bank even a neo bank you have to have your direct deposit go there here
[00:38:56] Bill Gurley: whether it's ten bucks or a million bucks you know you put it in stable coin with coin base and
[00:39:02] Bill Gurley: you start earning 4% daily and on top of that and this gets back to the picks thing you can
[00:39:08] Bill Gurley: transact immediately out of that count so you don't have to like move it from your savings to
[00:39:13] Bill Gurley: your checking to get it to do a c a like you can send stable coin immediately in microseconds
[00:39:20] Bill Gurley: and it'll cost you a few pennies it is the rails are there they're ready and it's working
[00:39:27] Bill Gurley: and i think the ui's a little difficult but there's no reason why that won't get better and faster
[00:39:32] Bill Gurley: and so i look up you know and i i just i wonder what the team at meta like they might just be
[00:39:39] Bill Gurley: kicking themselves like with all the money they spend on that coin everything they wanted to do on
[00:39:44] Bill Gurley: what's that like they should be running back at it like i don't know so maybe they should you
[00:39:50] Brad Gerstner: know remember the guy who did the what the lever network david marcus has started the lightning
[00:39:55] Brad Gerstner: network now it's a startup maybe maybe meta should go by you know should go by lightning and bring
[00:40:01] Brad Gerstner: david back in house because you know all the things they talked about all the things they talked
[00:40:07] Brad Gerstner: about are now what's happening bill and let me tell you want i think you're on to something big
[00:40:12] Brad Gerstner: here but one of the challenges we still have i think first anybody who looks at our current system
[00:40:18] Brad Gerstner: right knows that it's dreadfully behind the rest of the world right and we know it's the result
[00:40:22] Brad Gerstner: of regulatory capture by not only hard issuers but the banks and everybody else who who likes
[00:40:28] Brad Gerstner: the who benefit from the status quo but if you look at vc mastercard today i think that they're
[00:40:33] Brad Gerstner: doing something like 50,000 transactions per second and i checked with our good buddy vinylingum
[00:40:39] Brad Gerstner: and he said you know on on both salon and eith today they're still under 4,000 transactions per
[00:40:45] Brad Gerstner: second so they're trying to come up with these solutions to actually make the rails have the
[00:40:50] Brad Gerstner: functional throughput and efficient settlement required to really become a consumer product but i
[00:40:55] Brad Gerstner: think you nailed the other one that you know patrick callison had a tweet on this that i replied to
[00:41:00] Brad Gerstner: which is you know when genius act was passed there was massive lobbying by the banks to prevent
[00:41:07] Brad Gerstner: the crypto companies from paying interest on stablecoins so the settlement was that they could pay
[00:41:14] Brad Gerstner: rewards not interest okay and but what the way in which it's manifested itself because coin
[00:41:22] Brad Gerstner: is not the issuer circle is the issuer and they did this deal so coin base is promoting it as though
[00:41:28] Brad Gerstner: it was interest so from a consumer perspective a reward and interest if it's 4% is indistinguishable
[00:41:35] Brad Gerstner: no doubt right so i put my money and obviously brine's been out on right and armstrong of coin base has
[00:41:40] Bill Gurley: been out on x like arguing his cited arguments so he's clearly he's either getting opposition or
[00:41:48] Bill Gurley: expecting opposition on the regulatory front and when i see you know whether you know whether it's
[00:41:54] Bill Gurley: v sur nazdecker any of these people kind of run at the tokenization i always worry like because if
[00:42:00] Bill Gurley: you look at the history of like the debit card versus the credit card it was supposed to be disruptive
[00:42:05] Bill Gurley: it was supposed to be an alternative that would change things but they just they just run at it
[00:42:11] Bill Gurley: and strangle it and mix it up a little bit and then it's not as disruptive as it was that's their go-to
[00:42:17] Bill Gurley: but you know when i read this thing on picks again like i'm going to read this out loud as part of
[00:42:23] Bill Gurley: its aggressive economic and political campaign against brazil is investigating picks accusing the
[00:42:29] Bill Gurley: payment system of unfairly undercutting us financial and technology companies like visa and apple
[00:42:37] i mean that's the most absurd thing i've ever heard undercutting visa like did they realize they
[00:42:43] Bill Gurley: have visa mask are like the top two operating incomes in the history of american business like
[00:42:49] Bill Gurley: like there's there's no one that needs less protection than these guys if anything there should
[00:42:54] Bill Gurley: be an investigation that the dinner at the white house and a cabal i don't know i just like it's uh
[00:43:00] Bill Gurley: it's so bizarre to me i'm so thrilled to see this kind of disruption i think that it's super
[00:43:07] Bill Gurley: interesting what's possible i suspect all the big guys should be paying attention to this apple
[00:43:13] Bill Gurley: google amazon anybody that might have payment under rails i'll go on a limb bill you're going to see
[00:43:19] Bill Gurley: the you're going to see the hyper scalars you're going to see amazon and metta and these guys back
[00:43:23] Brad Gerstner: involved in the stable business at the end of the day we know money as a network effects business
[00:43:28] Brad Gerstner: and the challenge of circle and some of these stables from a consumer perspective is
[00:43:33] Brad Gerstner: universe uh visa and mastercard are universal so you got to get to all the merchants well who has all
[00:43:39] Brad Gerstner: the merchants amazon and metta right and so i think they're in a great position to partner with
[00:43:45] Brad Gerstner: or do some of these things themselves clearly they have the instinct to do it that's why they did
[00:43:49] Brad Gerstner: leber in the first place back it's also amazing for innovation and and one of the reasons why i
[00:43:53] Bill Gurley: think those bigger companies should run at this is if you look at the history of the picks like
[00:44:00] Bill Gurley: alternatives i mentioned in the uk and china and india the startups that do financial innovation
[00:44:07] Bill Gurley: scale up way more aggressively and successfully on those rails that are cheaper and faster and
[00:44:14] Bill Gurley: if if anything the having more rigid high friction high transaction cost rails makes it harder
[00:44:22] Bill Gurley: for it startup to think about you know using one of those technologies and so the success of we
[00:44:27] Bill Gurley: chat pay and i'll pay which as i described from my china chip are universal they're only way people
[00:44:33] Bill Gurley: pay in china happen because of that government incident pay product not not in spite of it and
[00:44:41] Bill Gurley: the same thing i talked to the CEO of new bank he said picks was huge for his business so it's
[00:44:46] Bill Gurley: probably bad for a laggard bank before a bank that embraces it it just becomes a better feature and
[00:44:52] Bill Gurley: i think the same thing about coinbase and what they're doing here so i'm applauding the innovation
[00:44:58] Bill Gurley: i'm i'm i'm jumping on board the crypto train and i hope i hope the incumbents aren't able to
[00:45:04] Bill Gurley: strangle this thing in washington here here here here as we move towards the end and and talk about
[00:45:10] Bill Gurley: my book and what i'm going to do next i do want to share with you that that both my book and
[00:45:16] Bill Gurley: and the the next project are outside of what i've i've spent my career doing and as i mentioned you
[00:45:22] Bill Gurley: know that that's kind of moving outside my comfort zone but it's also you know trying to have an
[00:45:27] Bill Gurley: impact and give back in areas that i don't know as well but but with a hope towards having an impact
[00:45:34] Bill Gurley: i've said this to you before but i've been just inspired frankly to go do this based on your
[00:45:41] Bill Gurley: success with invest america when you first told me about it you know i had doubts that you could
[00:45:46] Bill Gurley: get it done real doubts and i've watched other people in your shoes try and do these types of
[00:45:53] Bill Gurley: things over decades and beyond successful so you made it look easy i know it's just getting started
[00:45:59] Bill Gurley: but i wanted you to know how much that inspired what i'm going to go do and and could you give us
[00:46:05] Bill Gurley: an update on where things are uh that means a lot Bill maybe to talk about it first is just a
[00:46:10] Brad Gerstner: reminder you know we i think you and i agree we kind of have this battle for the soul of america
[00:46:14] Brad Gerstner: when it comes to capitalism right now right and that's fundamentally because too many people feel
[00:46:20] Brad Gerstner: left out and left behind 60% of people will never own assets that compound mandami's winning the
[00:46:26] Brad Gerstner: meorial race in New York City and you know they're doing it by being an anti capitalist but if you
[00:46:33] Brad Gerstner: look at these two charts i've shown them many times before it just shows you that free market capitalism
[00:46:38] Brad Gerstner: is the most productive force in the history of the world right this first chart just shows that gdp
[00:46:44] Brad Gerstner: on a global basis went parabolic at the exact same time that capitalism was really introduced and
[00:46:50] Brad Gerstner: started taking off and you know remind reminder like gdp is important because it's that surplus for
[00:46:56] Brad Gerstner: humanity with the fixed amount of labor and capital that then leads to better schools and better
[00:47:01] Brad Gerstner: hospitals and and and and drugs that save lives and all the things that make our lives better
[00:47:07] Brad Gerstner: and you can look at this chart that shows the results fewer mothers die in childbirth the average
[00:47:15] Brad Gerstner: you know of life is extended the quality of life is higher literacy rates are higher bill gates
[00:47:20] Brad Gerstner: extolls upon this and is on his annual letters so it's not just an investment account this is really
[00:47:27] Brad Gerstner: a much much bigger battle over where we want the country to go and i was very concerned as you know
[00:47:33] Brad Gerstner: a few years ago that we were headed down this path right and the path is that you can't have so
[00:47:39] Brad Gerstner: many people left out and left behind so i think the answer to socialism which has not worked for
[00:47:44] Brad Gerstner: europe right europe's in a disaster relative to where they were 30 years ago on on on a global
[00:47:51] Brad Gerstner: competitive basis and china as you well noted have pulled themselves out of poverty by leveraging
[00:47:57] Brad Gerstner: capitalism right so the answer to this drift into socialism is more capitalism and the
[00:48:03] invest america accounts now known as the trump accounts right are more capitalism they make every
[00:48:09] Brad Gerstner: child a capitalist from birth a private owner gives them a thousand bucks in a 401k like account
[00:48:15] Brad Gerstner: that they own and control their family has on their phone and so i think that's a game changer
[00:48:21] Brad Gerstner: you know but you're right we just got it passed so what where are we now the treasury secretary
[00:48:25] Brad Gerstner: scott besson has to implement this and by the way this is one of the largest consumer launches in
[00:48:31] Brad Gerstner: the history of government so at the start today there are 65 million kids in the country qualified
[00:48:37] Brad Gerstner: for an invest america account every kid under the age of 18 and every kid under the age of two will
[00:48:43] Brad Gerstner: automatically get a thousand bucks in their account right so you'll probably hear a launch starting in
[00:48:49] Brad Gerstner: maybe early December well they'll launch the website people can sign up for this remember the
[00:48:54] Brad Gerstner: accounts have to be funded and established by our 250th birthday july 4th 2026 that's only nine
[00:49:01] Brad Gerstner: months from now and i can tell you i've been blown away by the secretary secretary besson the
[00:49:07] Brad Gerstner: assistant secretary luke pet it and the team at treasury working with the white house they're
[00:49:11] Brad Gerstner: attacking this the way i would attack i would expect a silicon valley startup to attack the problem
[00:49:17] Brad Gerstner: that got a great great group of technologists joe gebeah helping to design the front end of this of
[00:49:22] Brad Gerstner: course from arabia b so you know we're we're on the verge now of some major announcements the
[00:49:29] Brad Gerstner: the start where people can start signing up their kids you know and then the goal is once we launch
[00:49:34] Brad Gerstner: this all these kids will have these accounts they'll be able to roll them over into their favorite
[00:49:40] Brad Gerstner: you know uh bank whether it's schwa or fidelity or jp morgan or what have you and starting on july 4th
[00:49:46] Brad Gerstner: the next year bill is close to automatic account creation as possible so you have a child the child's
[00:49:51] Brad Gerstner: born they get a social security number and they get an account seated with a thousand bucks from a
[00:49:56] Brad Gerstner: kids perspective it's going to look like i own a little bit of microsoft and i own a little bit of
[00:50:01] Brad Gerstner: united health care and in vidia and whatever we're going to be able to teach us in fact you know your
[00:50:06] Brad Gerstner: buddy tim who's teaching financial literacy you know we now have 30 states require financial
[00:50:11] Brad Gerstner: literacy requirements we're going to have this embedded in the schools every kids going to have
[00:50:15] Brad Gerstner: this on their phones so at any rate it's going incredibly well i give i give them a very high
[00:50:19] Brad Gerstner: score but we got to get it done so let's talk about your book i've been a huge fan of of
[00:50:26] Brad Gerstner: of the of the speech you made on this but i love the title running down a dream what's the thrust
[00:50:32] Brad Gerstner: of the book i remember you know kind of that lecture but what really compelled you to write it
[00:50:38] so i was years ago and this this is probably going back 10 years i was reading a lot of biographies
[00:50:44] Bill Gurley: and i noticed certain patterns among people with extraordinary careers and as vc's we see a lot
[00:50:51] Bill Gurley: of patterns in businesses and pattern recognition and i just saw patterns with people and in the back
[00:50:57] Bill Gurley: of my mind i always wanted to do this presentation i i kind of kept notes on it like i would a
[00:51:03] Bill Gurley: unwritten above the crowd blog post and i had an opportunity i got invited i had an opportunity to
[00:51:08] Bill Gurley: give the presentation to the mba class at the university of texas and so i you know i worked on it
[00:51:14] Bill Gurley: and put it together made it nice and gave that presentation they ended up putting that on youtube
[00:51:20] Bill Gurley: and many people have come to me and said that it's changed their lives encourage them to do
[00:51:25] Bill Gurley: different things certain people in the in the in the media industry noticed david sinra who's got
[00:51:31] Bill Gurley: the new podcast where he interviewed daniel acke and michael he's a big fan of the presentation talks
[00:51:37] Bill Gurley: about a lot in on his podcast james clear who wrote the tomah cabits maybe one of the best self help
[00:51:44] Bill Gurley: personal development writers out there he retweeted it and put a transcript on his own website
[00:51:50] Bill Gurley: and then a few people who were influenced with my life started prodding me he you should turn that
[00:51:55] Bill Gurley: into a blog and so eventually i got convinced we talked to publishers they were interested and so
[00:52:02] Bill Gurley: i started working on this now it took a long time and the the thing i would say about it is that
[00:52:09] Bill Gurley: i hope that that time equates to quality like i was out there really wanting to make it great and so
[00:52:16] Bill Gurley: the book has an interesting kind of novel architecture we combine what i call profiles so stories
[00:52:22] Bill Gurley: of success with principles tools of success so they alternate so you get a story maybe about someone
[00:52:28] Bill Gurley: you didn't know and how they started at the very bottom and became successful and then the types of
[00:52:33] Bill Gurley: things they did and i do i do think that the principles these tools that that are in the book are things
[00:52:40] Bill Gurley: people can use and i really want it to be great it's done i still need to record the audio version
[00:52:46] Bill Gurley: all the podcast fans of ours tell me i have to do it it hasn't been my voice so i'm going to do it
[00:52:52] Bill Gurley: i hope people love it i hope it changes their lives for the better and what i really want to encourage
[00:52:58] Bill Gurley: is people to take a chance and and do what they really love i think it's such an important topic
[00:53:03] Brad Gerstner: you know one of the things parents are asking me so much these days is you know what what should
[00:53:09] Brad Gerstner: my kids do particularly get there's a lot of anxiety in the world right today about future careers
[00:53:15] Brad Gerstner: and so maybe just talk a little bit about why this is so important now because i think the timing
[00:53:19] Brad Gerstner: is really profound here so in in the introduction chapter we unpack a lot of this and i don't think
[00:53:26] Bill Gurley: anyone will be surprised when i read some of this but but gallop pole does a career engagement study
[00:53:32] Bill Gurley: they've been doing it for a long time i think in the 2023 one only 23 percent of people said they
[00:53:38] Bill Gurley: were thriving are engaged at work and 59 percent were unsatisfied and that's just a big universal
[00:53:44] Bill Gurley: survey everyone seems aware that we've kind of moved to this gauntlet that we've put our kids in
[00:53:50] Bill Gurley: as they approach college and go through college in the cuddling of the american mind
[00:53:54] Bill Gurley: heightened lukiana called a resume arms race and we really taught them to be grinders but
[00:54:01] Bill Gurley: angel of duckworth highlights that if you have persistence but not passion you eventually recognize
[00:54:08] Bill Gurley: your inner grind and and and and when you come out of that you're in a really tough spot and so
[00:54:13] Bill Gurley: we've got people we've got these kids on this runway we were telling them like they have to pick
[00:54:18] Bill Gurley: a a major even in their application so they're 17 what do you want to do with your life what do you
[00:54:23] Bill Gurley: want to do and and and they they really don't know and one thing we stumbled upon doing research
[00:54:29] Bill Gurley: on the book i was working with a researcher we did this survey and asked people if you could start
[00:54:33] Bill Gurley: your career over again would you do things differently and in that survey 70 percent of people said
[00:54:39] Bill Gurley: yes and we did it again with Wharton just to make sure we had you know a true academic survey going
[00:54:45] Bill Gurley: on and they did a lot more people and that number was still six and ten six and ten said if they
[00:54:51] Bill Gurley: could start a career over they do it again and there's a there's a great book i read a lot of
[00:54:56] Bill Gurley: books in writing my book but there's a great book called the power of regret by Daniel Pink he's
[00:55:01] Bill Gurley: he's a well-known author but he he has this thing he calls boldness regrets and he said one of the
[00:55:08] Bill Gurley: most robust findings in the academic research and on my own is that over time we were much more likely
[00:55:14] Bill Gurley: to regret the chances we didn't take than the chances we did he says again the surface domain
[00:55:20] Bill Gurley: whether the risk involved our education or work or love lies doesn't matter much what haunts us
[00:55:25] Bill Gurley: is the inaction itself and so i think that i think that ties really nicely with this idea that if
[00:55:32] Bill Gurley: people could start over they do something they do something different there's a great video that
[00:55:37] Bill Gurley: that Pink references that we can put in the show notes where Bezos is asked about the decision
[00:55:42] Bill Gurley: to leave D. Shaw and and start amazon and he said he used a regret minimization framework he said
[00:55:50] Bill Gurley: it was only a nerd could do that but he said that he imagined himself being 80 and would he care
[00:55:57] Bill Gurley: that he left D. Shaw maybe for when a bonus you know or would he or would he care more that he
[00:56:03] Bill Gurley: didn't take this chance this kind of instinctive chance that he felt like he had to take and he
[00:56:08] Bill Gurley: immediately after thinking about it in that way wanted to go do it and so hey bill i have
[00:56:15] Brad Gerstner: Bezos's regret minimization framework taped to my computer monitor there you go right it's
[00:56:22] Bill Gurley: you know that it's literally taped to my monitor yeah powerful yeah so so that's that's that's
[00:56:30] Bill Gurley: what this is about that's what this book is about that's who it's for and i want more people
[00:56:35] Bill Gurley: to take a flyer and go do what they love you know we have a phrase i use in the book life as a
[00:56:40] Bill Gurley: user to lose it proposition totally one shot deal man well how do you plan to promote it
[00:56:48] Bill Gurley: it comes out in February late February and so i'm just getting started in that process if people
[00:56:53] Bill Gurley: have ideas they want to share with me please reach out and let me know book love i'll host a book
[00:56:59] Bill Gurley: launch event bill okay okay we we've got we've got a lot of fun stuff planned but but but i need to
[00:57:06] Bill Gurley: record the audio book i know that's going to take a lot of time i'm excited there's a handful
[00:57:12] Bill Gurley: of people that have read it maybe maybe 50 in the publisher and whatnot and nearly every one of
[00:57:17] Bill Gurley: them tells me that they immediately thought of three or four people they want to give it to and so
[00:57:22] Bill Gurley: i hope there's kind of a viral component to it because people have that reaction but you know if
[00:57:27] Bill Gurley: you're feeling stuck in your career i you should read it if you're a teenager young adult who
[00:57:32] Bill Gurley: feels overwhelmed by people telling you who where do you want to make during where do you want to go
[00:57:37] Bill Gurley: what are you going to do it like i think this book won't put more pressure on them i think it will
[00:57:42] Bill Gurley: actually relax them and give them a framework that feels like a lot more personal to themselves
[00:57:48] Bill Gurley: and like they're a lot more in control if you're a parent that wants to help a child on that journey
[00:57:53] Bill Gurley: i think parents sometimes overly push kids into the lawyer doctor banker framework i'm not sure
[00:58:00] Bill Gurley: that's healthy especially in this ai world where those jobs may be under risk as well and then maybe
[00:58:05] Bill Gurley: if you're you know an administrator or someone in the type of role that guide people and career
[00:58:10] Bill Gurley: decisions hopefully you'll like it as well but we'll put the pre-order link in the show notes i
[00:58:16] Bill Gurley: will put it on my x-feed please go out and pre-order the book i think it'll help it be reach more
[00:58:22] Bill Gurley: people and and be successful well i think it's uh it's going to be hugely impactful and it's
[00:58:29] Brad Gerstner: the type of stuff of consequence i'm i'm just you know i'm thrilled that you're doing it i'm thrilled
[00:58:33] Brad Gerstner: that you're taking the time to do it i know that's not the only thing that you're you're thinking
[00:58:38] Brad Gerstner: about you have these other you know big topics that you're thinking about as well bill we've talked
[00:58:43] Brad Gerstner: about them here and i'm sure we will continue to regulatory capture us health care nuclear etc what
[00:58:50] Brad Gerstner: do you think it about uh with respect to those things so i'm gonna write a book on every one of them
[00:58:56] Brad Gerstner: no that's well i could but it's not it's not my goal my my goal is to just go spend more times on
[00:59:02] Bill Gurley: these really big problems and see if i can be helpful in any way i've spent a career kind of
[00:59:07] Bill Gurley: breaking down and analyzing different situations i mean two two of my favorite podcasts we've done
[00:59:14] Bill Gurley: and i hear i hear about this from the community as well um the one we did at Diablo Canyon and then
[00:59:21] Bill Gurley: the one about around my china trip and those types of of work are very rewarding for me but
[00:59:28] Bill Gurley: they also were learning expeditions you know i went out and put in more hours for those episodes
[00:59:34] Bill Gurley: than other right and the the nuclear one in particular you know one of the things people ask me
[00:59:39] Bill Gurley: why would i want to go do this you know we were a small part of a movement to kind of change the
[00:59:46] Bill Gurley: mindset on nuclear energy and there were there were people that put a lot more effort into us i'm
[00:59:50] Bill Gurley: not trying to take credit for it but you know the fact that steep pinker was out there e-lon
[00:59:56] Bill Gurley: you know our stuff like it eventually happened like overnight seemingly overnight we went from a very
[01:00:03] Bill Gurley: negative mindset towards nuclear energy to recognizing that it's very clean energy and something that
[01:00:09] Bill Gurley: it can really help save the planet and so that type of meme flip if i could go achieve more of those
[01:00:15] Bill Gurley: in these other areas i would consider to win so that's what's motivating me i'm really looking
[01:00:20] Bill Gurley: forward to it and i'm kind of fired up and nervous at the same time but but that's what that's
[01:00:25] Bill Gurley: what i'm thinking about there'll be more to come on that in terms of what the actual platform
[01:00:29] Bill Gurley: looks like i'm still working on it but for now i'm gonna i'm gonna sprint into february to make
[01:00:34] Bill Gurley: sure the book does well i couldn't be more stoked for you there's been a total blast you and i've
[01:00:38] Brad Gerstner: been chopping it up for you know for a couple decades but doing this last two years together pounding
[01:00:44] Brad Gerstner: out these has been a lot of fun for me i'm sure we'll continue to chop it up every day and you know
[01:00:49] Brad Gerstner: i'm sure that you'll find some topic that you can't live without explore on the back
[01:00:54] Brad Gerstner: talking about it yeah we'll get you back on but i'm gonna give you the last word bill it's
[01:01:00] Brad Gerstner: awesome awesome to hear about all of this and i'm super excited for the book well i would i
[01:01:04] Bill Gurley: would just you know in the way i started bread thanks to you it's been fun working together on this
[01:01:09] Bill Gurley: and and uh and doing it every week it does force you to stay fresh you have to read everything
[01:01:15] Bill Gurley: you possibly can which i'm sure it's super helpful to use an investor and then thanks to thanks to
[01:01:20] Bill Gurley: all our listeners like i i i'm sure some of them are feeling gonna feel like i'm letting them
[01:01:26] Bill Gurley: down and i i feel the weight of that um but hopefully they'll recognize that i'm gonna go try and
[01:01:32] Bill Gurley: put put my uh work effort to good to good causes
[01:01:45] as a reminder to everybody just our opinions not investment advice
