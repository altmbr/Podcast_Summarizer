[00:00:00] ChatGPT has got 800-900 million week to active users.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_01: And if you're the kind of person who is using this for hours every day,
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_01: ask yourself why five times more people look at it,
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_01: get it, know what it is, have an account, know how to use it,
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_01: and can't think of anything to do with it this week or next week.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_01: The term AI is a little bit like the term technology.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_01: Once something's been around for a while, it's not AI anymore.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_01: Is machine learning still AI?
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_01: I don't know. In actual general usage, AI seems to mean new stuff.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_01: An AGI seems.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_01: New, scary stuff.
[00:00:30] AGI seems to be a little bit like this.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_01: I thought it's already here, and it's just more software.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: Or it's five years away, and will always be five years away.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_01: We don't know the physical limits of this technology,
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: and so we don't know how much better it can get.
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_01: You've got Sam Waltman saying, we've got PhD level researchers right now.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_01: And Demis Asibis says, no, we don't.
[00:00:47] Shut up. Very new, very, very big, very, very exciting,
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_01: world changing things tend to lead to bubbles.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, if we're not in a bubble now, we will be.
[00:00:58] Ben and I, welcome back to the Aston Z podcast.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_00: Good to be back.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_01: We're here to discuss your latest presentation, AI Eats the World.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_00: So, for those who haven't read it yet,
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_00: maybe we can go share the high level thesis,
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_00: and maybe contextualize it in light of recent AI presentations.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm curious how you're thinking has evolved.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's funny. One of the slides in the debt reference is a conversation
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_01: where I had with a big company, CMO, who said,
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_01: we've all had lots of AI presentations now.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: The Google one.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: We've had the Google one and the Microsoft one.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_01: We've had the Bane one and the BCG one.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: We've had the one from Accenture and the one from my ad agency.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_01: So now what?
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: Well, it's sort of 90-odd slide.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_01: So, there's a bunch of different things I'm trying to get at.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: One of them is, I think, just to say, well,
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_01: if this is a platform shift or more than a platform shift,
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_01: how do platform shifts tend to work?
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_01: What are the things that we tend to see in it?
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_01: How many of those patents can we see being repeated now?
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_01: And, of course, some of the patents that come out of that are things like bubbles.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_01: But, lots of stuff changes inside the tech industry.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_01: There are winners and losers and people who were dominant
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_01: and tend up becoming irrelevant.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_01: There are new billion trillion dollar companies created.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: Then there's also what does this mean outside the tech industry?
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_01: Because if we think back over the last waves of platform shifts,
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_01: so, some industries where this changed everything and created and un-created industries,
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_01: and there are others where this was just kind of a useful tool.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_01: So, if you're in the newspaper business, that had a very different impact.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_01: The last 30 years looked very different to if you're in the cement business,
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_01: where the internet was just kind of useful,
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_01: but didn't really change the nature of your industry very much.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: And so, what I tried to do is give people a sense of, well,
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: what is it that's going on in tech?
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_01: How much money are we spending?
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: What are we trying to do?
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_01: What are the unanswered questions?
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: What might or might not happen within the tech industry?
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: But then outside technology, how does this tend to play out?
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: What seems to be happening at the moment?
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_01: How is this manifesting into tools and deployment and new use cases and new behaviors?
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: And then, as we kind of step back from all of this,
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: how many times have we get?
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_01: Again, how many times have we gone to all of this before?
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_01: It's funny, I went on a podcast this summer and I sort of opened a line,
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_01: I said something like, well, I'm a centrist, I think this is as big a deal as the internet
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: or smartphones, but only as big a deal as the net or smartphones.
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_01: And there's like 200 YouTube comments are just under these saying,
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: this morning he doesn't understand how big this is.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_01: And I think, well, it was kind of a big deal.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_01: And I sort of finished the debt by looking at other features,
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: because I live in an apartment building in Manhattan,
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_01: and we have an attended elevator, which means there's no buttons as an accelerator and a break,
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_01: and the door one gets in and drives you to your floor, this streetcar.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_01: And in the 50s, I just deployed automatic elevators,
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_01: and then you get in and you press a button.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_01: And they marketed it by saying, it's got electronic politeness.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_01: Yours.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_01: Which means the infrared beam.
[00:04:07] And today when you get into an elevator, you don't say,
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_01: I'm using an electronic elevator.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_01: It's automatic.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_01: It's just a lift.
[00:04:17] Which is what happened with databases and with the web and with smartphones.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_01: And I kind of think now, I've done a couple of polls on this in LinkedIn and spread.
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_01: So is machine learning still AI?
[00:04:29] Is AI is kind of, in AI is of the word, the term AI is a little bit like the term technology
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_01: or automation.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_01: It's only kind of applies when something's new.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_01: Once something's been around in you for a while, it's not AI anymore.
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_01: So database is certainly not AI.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_01: Is machine learning still AI?
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_01: I mean, and there's obviously there's an academic definition where people say this guy's an idiot.
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_01: No, of course, I'm going to explain the definition of AI.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_01: But then in actual general usage, AI seems to mean new stuff.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: And AGI seems new, scary stuff.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's funny.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_01: I was thinking about this.
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_01: There's an all theologians joke that the problem for Jews is that you wait and wait and wait
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_01: for the Messiah and he never comes.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_01: And the problem for Christians is, it came and nothing happened.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_01: The world didn't change.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_01: Like there is still sin.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_01: All practical purposes, nothing happened.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_01: And AGI seems to be a little bit like this.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_01: Like I do, it's already here.
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_01: And so you've got Sam Orton saying, we've got PhD level researchers right now.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_01: And Demis and Cybis says, what?
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_01: No, we don't.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_01: Shut up.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_01: And so either it's already here and it's just more software
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: or it's five years away and will always be five years away.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:41] Yeah.
[00:05:41] It's a jamming.
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: Let's compare back to previous platform chess because some people
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_00: look at some of the internet and say, hey, there were net new trillion dollar companies,
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: Facebook and Google that were created from it and just sort of all sorts of new emerging winners.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_00: Whereas they look at something like mobile and say, hey,
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: there were big companies like Uber and Snap and Instagram and what's that.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_00: But these were billion dollar outcomes or tens of billion dollar outcomes.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: But really the big winners were in fact, Facebook and Google.
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_00: And so in some sense, mobile perhaps was sustaining.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: You feel for the quibble with the definition of sustaining the disruptive.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_00: But sustaining in a sense that maybe more of the value went to incumbents or companies that existed
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: prior to the shift.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: I'm curious how you think about AI in light of that in terms of is it enabling?
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_00: Is more of the gains coming from going to come to net new companies like OpenAI and
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: Anthropic and others that follow or more of the gains going to capture it by Microsoft
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: and Google and Facebook and Meta and companies that existed prior?
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: So I think it's followed several answers to this.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_01: One of them is you have to be careful about framing and structures and things because you end
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: up arguing about the framing and the definition rather than arguing about what's going to happen.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_01: And they're all useful but they will get holes in them.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_01: Mobile did was it shifted us.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: There's a bunch of things that it changed fundamentally.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_01: It shifted us from the web to apps, for example.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_01: And it gave everybody on the world a phone.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_01: It gave everybody on the world a pocket computer.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_01: So even today there's less than a billion consumer PCs on earth than there's something
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_01: between five and six billion smartphones.
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_01: It made possible things that would not have been possible without it, whether that's TikTok
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_01: or arguably I think things like online dating.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_01: You can map those against dollar value.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_01: You can also map those against kind of structural change in consumer behavior and access to
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_01: information and things.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: And I think you could certainly argue that Meta would be a much smaller company if it wasn't
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_01: for mobile, for example.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: You can argue the puts and calls on their stuff a lot.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_01: There's certainly not all platforms you have to the same.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_01: And you can do the standard teleology of say, well, there were mainframes and NPCs and then the
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: web and smartphones.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_01: You kind of want to put sass in there somewhere and you kind of want to put open source in there
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_01: and maybe you want to put databases.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: So these are kind of useful framings but they're not predictive.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: They don't tell you what's going to happen.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_01: They just kind of give you one way of understanding what's seen some of the patterns that we have here.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_01: And of course the big debate around genitive AI is just another platform shift or is it something
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_01: more than that?
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_01: And of course the problem is we don't know and we don't have anywhere of knowing other than waiting
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_01: to see.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_01: So this may be as big as PCs or the web or sass or open source or something or maybe as big as
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_01: computing and then you've got the very over excited people living in group houses and Berkeley.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_01: You say, you know, this is as big as fire or something.
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_01: Well, well, well, well, great.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: But does this bring you companies?
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_01: I mean, you go back to the mobile.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_01: You know, there was a time when people thought that blogs were going to be a different to the web.
[00:08:59] Which seems weird now.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: Like Google needed like a separate blog search.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_01: This was seriously this was a thing.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_01: There was a time when it was really not clear.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_01: And I think you kind of generalize his point.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_01: I mean, you go back to the internet in the mid 90s.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_01: You know, we kind of knew this was going to be a big thing.
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_01: We didn't really know it was going to be the web.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_01: So before that, we didn't know it was going to be the internet.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: We knew there were going to be networks.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_01: We weren't didn't know it wasn't clear it was going to be the internet.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_01: Then it wasn't clear it was going to be the web.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_01: Then it wasn't really clear how the web is going to work.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_01: And you know, when when that's kept launched like Mark Zuckerberg was in junior high or you know,
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_01: elementary school or something and you know,
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_01: Larry and Sergio were students and like Amazon with a bookstore.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: So you can know it but not know it.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_01: And you could make the same point about smartphones.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_01: Like it was we knew everyone was going to have an internet-connected thing in their pocket.
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_01: But it was not clear it was basically going to be a PC from this has been PC company from the 80s.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_01: And a search engine company.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_01: It was not clear it wasn't going to be Nokia or Microsoft.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_01: So I think you have to be super careful in like,
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: making making kind of deterministic predictions about this.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_01: What you can do is say, well,
[00:10:07] when this stuff happens, everything changes.
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_01: And that's happened 5 or 10 times before.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_01: I'm curious how you got conviction in this idea or we got some prediction that hey,
[00:10:17] AI is going to be as big as the internet, which of course is pretty big.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: But I'm not yet I bet it is I'm not yet at the conviction that it's going to be any bigger.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_00: I'm curious what sort of inspires that sort of, you know, sort of statement.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: And then also what might change your mind either way,
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_00: you know, that it might not be as big of the internet because of course that internet was obviously very big.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_00: But also that, hey, perhaps it might be bigger.
[00:10:40] Well, so I think, you know, I don't want to, I made a diagram of kind of S curves kind of going up,
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_01: sliding someone said to me, well, what's the access on this diagram?
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to get into, you know, it's 5% bigger than internet.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_01: So is it 20% bigger?
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_01: I think the question is more like, is it another of these industry cycles,
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_01: always eating much more fundamental change in what technology can be?
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_01: Is it more like computing or electricity as a sort of structural change,
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_01: rather than here's a whole bunch more stuff we can do as computers?
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_01: I think that's sort of the question.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_01: And there's a funny sort of disconnect, I think, in looking at debates about this within tech,
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_01: because you know, I watch this, this is one of the open AI livestreams a couple of weeks ago.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_01: And they spend the first 20 minutes talking about how they're going to have like human level,
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_01: PhD level AI research, it's like next year.
[00:11:28] And then the second half of the stream is, and here's our API stack that's going to enable
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_01: hundreds and thousands of new software developers just like Windows, and in fact,
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: literally quite build gates.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_01: And you say, well, those can't kind of both be true.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_01: Either I've got a thing which is a PhD level AI researcher,
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: which by implication is like a PhD level CPA.
[00:11:47] Yeah.
[00:11:47] Or I've got a new piece of software that does much access for me,
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_01: and well, which is it?
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_01: Either this thing is going to be like human level, and some, and that's a very, very challenging
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_01: problematic complicated statement.
[00:12:00] Or this is going to let us make more software that can do more things that software couldn't be.
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_01: And I think there's a real like schizophrenia in conversations around this,
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_01: because like scaling lots, and it's going to scale it all the way.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: And meanwhile, I'm going to, here, look how good it is at writing code.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_01: And again, like, well, is it writing code, or do we not need software anymore?
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_01: Because in principle, if the model keeps scaling,
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_01: nobody's going to write code anymore.
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_01: You'll just say to the model, hey, can you do this thing for me?
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_01: Is it a little bit of a hedge or like a sequencing thing?
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_01: Well, it's a, some of it's a sequencing thing.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_01: But in principle, if you think the stuff is going to keep scaling,
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_01: why are you investing in a software company?
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_01: Like, because we'll just have this like, God in a box that can do everything.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_01: And I think this is the kind of the funny kind of challenge.
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_01: And this is, I think, the fundamental way that this is different from previous platform chips.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_01: Is it with the internet or with mobile or being deemed with mobile?
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_01: Mainframe is like, you didn't know what was going to happen in the next couple of years.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: You didn't know that Amazon would become, and you didn't know how net skate was going to work out.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_01: And you didn't know what next year's iPhone was going to be,
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_01: and 10 years ago when we cared about that,
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_01: you kind of knew the physical limits.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_01: Like, you knew in 1995, you knew that telcos were not going to give everybody gig a bit fiber next year.
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_01: And you knew that the iPhone wasn't going to like have a year's battery life,
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_01: an unroll and have a projector and fly or whatever.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_01: But we don't know the physical limits of this technology,
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_01: because we don't really have a good theoretical understanding of white work so well.
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_01: Nor indeed, we have a good theoretical understanding of what human intelligence is.
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_01: And so we don't know how much better it can get.
[00:13:32] So you can do, you can do a chart and you could say, well, you know,
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_01: this is a roadmap for MadeNs.
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_01: And this is a roadmap for DSL.
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_01: And this is how fast DSL will be.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_01: And then you can make some guesses about how quickly telcos will deploy DSL.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: And then you can say, well, clearly, we're not going to be able to replace broadcast TV.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_01: We're streaming in 1998.
[00:13:51] But we don't have an equivalent way of modeling this stuff
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_01: to know what is the fundamental capability of it going to look like in three years.
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_01: Which gets you to these kind of slightly vibe space forecasting,
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_01: where we know, so, you know, Jeff Inton says, well, I feel like, and Demis Asabez says,
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_01: well, I feel like, but no, no.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_01: And then Karpathi goes into our cashers podcast and says, I feel like, you know, it's a decade out.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know when I saw this, this meme of, of what's his name, Ilya Suskeva,
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_01: but like he says, like, the answer will reveal itself.
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_01: And somebody like,
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_01: meme, I'm going to say, Photoshop, but of course he wouldn't have been Photoshop turned him into a
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_01: Buddhist monk wearing like an orange, like an orange outfit, the future will reveal itself.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_01: But this is a problem. We don't know. We don't have a way of modeling this.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And so let's connect this to sort of the, you know, the upfront investment that some of
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_00: these companies are making. If he goes, we don't know, you know, is there a risk of overinvestment
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_00: leading to some, you know, potential, you know, bubble-like mechanics? Or how do you think about that
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_00: question? Well, deterministically, very, very, very big, very, very exciting worlds changing
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_01: things tend to lead to bubbles. And you don't think anybody would dispute that you can see some
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_01: bubbly behavior now. And, you know, you can argue about what kind of bubble, but again, like that
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_01: doesn't have very much predictive power. And, you know, one of the features of bubbles is that
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_01: when everything's going, everything goes up all at once. And everyone looks like a genius,
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_01: and everyone leverages and cross leverages and does circular revenue. And that's great until it's not.
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_01: And then you get a kind of a ratchet effect as it goes back down again. So, yeah, if we're not in
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_01: a bubble now, we will be. I remember Mark Sanderson saying, you know, 1997 was not a bubble,
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_01: 98 was not a bubble, 99 was a bubble. Are we in 97 now or 98 or 99? And, you know, if we could
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_01: predict that, you know, we'd live in a parallel universe. I think, you know, to the, I suppose,
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_01: maybe kind of two more specific, more tangible answers to this. The first of them is we don't
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_01: really know what the compute requirements of this stuff are going to be. And forecasting that
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_01: except like more and forecasting that feels a lot like trying to forecast like bandwidth use
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: in the late 90s. Now, imagine if you were trying to do the algebra on that, you'd say, well,
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_01: this many users, you know, how much bandwidth is a webpage use? How will that change? How will that
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: change as bandwidth gets faster? What happens with video? What kind of video? What bandwidth? What
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_01: bitrate of video? How long do people watch a video? How much video? And then you'd like, you,
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_01: you could build the spreadsheet and it would tell you what bitrate would, what global bandwidth's
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_01: consumption would be in 10 years. And then you could try and use that to back calculate how many
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_01: routers it's just going to sell. And you could get a number, but it wouldn't be the number, you know,
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_01: there'd be a hundredfold range of possible outcomes from that. And you could, you know, you could
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_01: make the same point about algebra of consumption now. So, you know, right now we have a bunch
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_01: of rational actors saying, well, this stuff is transformative and a huge threat. And we can't
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_01: keep up with demand for it now. And as far as we know, the demand is going to keep going up.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, we've had a variety of quotes from all of the hyperscaders basically saying the
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_01: downside of not investing is bigger than the downside of every investing. That,
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_01: or that kind of thing always works well until it doesn't. Yeah. And I saw slightly strange
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_01: quote from Mark Zuckerberg saying, well, if it turns out that we've over invested, we can just
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_01: re-use that, resell the capacity. And I thought, let me just like stop their mark.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_01: Because if it turns out you can't use your capacity, everybody else is going to have loads of
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_01: respect about you as well. Yeah. All these people now who are desperate for more capacity,
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_01: if it turns out we can get the same results for hundreds of the compute, that will be true for
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: everyone else too, not just you. Yeah. So, yeah, you know, any investment cycle like this, you tend
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_01: to get over investment. But then after that, there's very limited predictions you can make about
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_01: what's going to happen. I think the more useful kind of way to look at this is to think, well,
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_01: you've got these kind of transformative capabilities that are already increasing the value of your
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_01: existing products, if you're Google, or Meta, or Amazon. And you're going to be able to use them to
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_01: build a bunch more stuff. And why would you want to let somebody else do that rather than you doing
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: it as long as you're able to keep funding and selling what you're building.
[00:18:40] Yeah. And it will turn out that, you know, we have an evolution of models in the next year that
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_01: means you can get the same result for hundreds of the compute that you're using today.
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_01: Bearing in mind that it's already going down, like depending on your numbers, 20, 30, 40 times a year.
[00:18:58] But then the usage is going up. So, you're in this very, as I said, it's like trying to predict
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_01: bandwidth consumption in the late 90s, early 2000s. You can throw all the parameters out, but it
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_01: doesn't get you something useful. You just kind of need to step back and say, yeah, but this is
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_01: internet thing any good. Yeah, because I'm curious if the bottlenecks are, if you see them as more
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: on the supply side or the demand side, you know, more technical constraints or is just, is they any good?
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: Are there enough use cases to justify the type of stuff? What are you seeing and what are you
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_00: predicting? So, maybe two answers to this question. The first of them is I think we've had the sort of
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_01: a bifurcation of what all the questions are. So, there are now very, very detailed conversations
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_01: about chips and then very, very detailed conversations about data centers and about funding for data
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_01: centers and then about what is a new enterprise SaaS company built on AI? What margins will it have?
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_01: And how much money does it need to raise? And so, there are venture capital conversations. And
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_01: so there are many different conversations within which like I don't know anything about chips,
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_01: you know, I can spell ultraviolet, but like I don't know what like an ultraviolet appress is.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_01: It's like it's more, it's more violet side and eight.
[00:20:12] And so, you've got this, you know, it's like the Milton Friedman line, no, no, no, it's had to build a
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_01: pencil. You've got the right, you know, we've got this, you know, it's turned into a moment.
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_01: I think a second answer might be I think there's two kinds of AI deployment, to generate
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_01: a AI deployment. One of them is there are places where it's very easy and obvious right now to
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_01: see what you would do with this, which is basically software development, marketing, point solutions
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_01: for many very boring, very specific enterprise use cases. And also, basically people like us,
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_01: which are people who have kind of very open, very free form, very flexible jobs with many different
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_01: things and people who are always looking for ways to optimize that. And so, you get people
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_01: in Silicon Valley who are like, you know, I spend all my diet time at tech, TBT, I don't use Google
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_01: anymore, you know, I've replaced my CRM with this. And you kind of, and then you obviously people who
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_01: write, if you're writing codes, this works really well, if you're in marketing, you know, all these
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_01: stories are big companies where, you know, they're making 300 assets where they would have made 30.
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_01: And then Accenture and Bane and McKinsey and in-faces and so on, sitting and solving very specific
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_01: problems inside big companies, then there's a whole bunch of other people who look at it and they're like,
[00:21:31] it's okay. And you go and look at the usage data and you see, okay,
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_01: CRM GPT has got 800, 900 million weekly out of users, 5% of people are paying. And then you go and
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_01: look at all the survey data and you know, it's very fragmented and inconsistent, but it all sort of
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_01: points to like something like 10 or 15% of people into the developed world are using this every day.
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_01: Another 20 or 30% of people are using it every week. And if you're the kind of person who is
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_01: using this for hours every day, ask yourself why five times more people look at it, get it,
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_01: know what it is, have an account, know how to use it and can't think of anything to do with it
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_01: this week or next week. Why is that? Is it because it early and it's not like a young people
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_01: thing either incidentally? And so is that just because it's early, is it because of the error rates,
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_01: is it because you have to map it against what you do every day. And one of the analogy I was used to
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_01: use, which isn't in the current presentation, I've used in previous presentations, is imagine you're
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_01: an accountant and you see software spreadsheets for the first time. This thing can do a month of work
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_01: in 10 minutes, almost literally. You want to change, you want to recalculate that DCF,
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_01: that 10 year DCF with a different discount rate, I've done it before you finished asking me to,
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_01: and that would have been like a day or two days or three days of work to recalculate all those
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_01: numbers. Great. Now imagine you're a lawyer and you see it. And you think, well, that's great.
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_01: My accountant should see it. Maybe I'll use it next week when I'm making a table of my billable hours,
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_01: but that's not what I do all day. And I exhale is doesn't use do things that a lawyer can do every day.
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_01: And I think those, this is other class, a person that's like, I'm not sure what to do with this.
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_01: And some of that is habit, some of that is like realizing no, instead of doing it that way,
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_01: I could do it this way. But that's also what products are. Like every entrepreneur who comes into
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_01: a 16 Z when I was there from 2014 to 2019 and I'm sure now, like you could look at any company that
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_01: comes in and say that's basically a database. That's basically a CRM. That's basically Oracle or
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_01: Google Docs, except that they realize there's this problem or this workflow inside this industry and
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_01: worked out how to use a database or CRM or basically constants from 5, 10, 20 years ago and solve
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_01: that problem for people in that industry and go in and sell it to them and work out how they can get it to use it.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: And so this is why you look at data on this that depending on how you count to the typical big company
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_01: today has 400 to 500 SaaS apps in the US, 400 to 500 SaaS applications. And they're all basically doing
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_01: something you could do in Oracle or Excel or email. And that's the other side, I'm on a login,
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm afraid, but like this is the other side of what is what do you do with these things? Do you just
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_01: go to the bot and ask it to do a thing for you? Or does an enterprise salesperson come to your boss
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_01: and sell you a thing that means now you press a button and it analyzes this process that you need it,
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_01: that you never realized you were even doing. And I feel like that's why there are AI software
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_01: companies. Really? Isn't that what they're doing? They're unbundling chat Gbt just as the enterprise
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_01: software company, 10 years ago, is unbundling Oracle or Google or Excel. Do you have the view that
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_00: Excel did for accountants, AI is now doing for coders and developers, but hasn't quite figured out
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_00: that daily critical workflow for other job positions. And so it's unclear for people who aren't
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_00: developers, why should you be using this for many hours a day? I think there's a lot of people who
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_01: don't have tasks that work very well with this. And then there's a lot of people who need it to
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_01: be wrapped in a product and a workflow and tooling and UX and someone to come and say, hey,
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_01: have you realized you could do it with this? I had this conversation in summer with with with
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: with with with with Balaji who's another former a 16z person. And he was making this point about
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_01: validation that can you because these things still get stuff wrong and people in the valley often
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_01: kind of hand away for this away. But you know, there are questions that have specific answers where
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_01: needs to be the right answer one of a limited set of right answers. Can you validate that mechanistically?
[00:26:18] If not, is it efficient to validate it with people? So you know, by the marketing use case,
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_01: it's a lot more efficient to get a machine to make you 200 pictures and then have a person look
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_01: at them and pick 10 that are good than to have people make 10 good images or 100 even more if
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_01: you're going to make 500 images and pick 100 that are good. That's a lot more efficient than having
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_01: a person make 100 images. But on the other hand, if you're doing something like data entry and
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_01: there's something about this about about open open open Alay on launch deep research,
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: open Alay launch deep research, the whole market in case is it goes off and collects data about
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_01: the mobile market. I used to be mobile analyst. The numbers are all wrong. The used case of look how
[00:26:56] SPEAKER_01: useful this is, their numbers are wrong. And in some cases are wrong because they've
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_01: I'm literally trying to describe the number incorrectly
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_01: from the source.
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_01: In other cases, it's wrong because they've used a source
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_01: that they shouldn't have used.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_01: But like if I'd announced an intern to do it for me,
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_01: that an intern would probably have picked that.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_01: And to the point about verification,
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_01: if you're going to do data entry,
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_01: if I'm going to ask a machine to copy 200 numbers
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_01: out of 200 PDFs, and then I'm going to have to check
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_01: all 200 of those numbers, I'm going to do this to myself.
[00:27:28] So you've got a whole swirling matrix of,
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_01: how do you map this against existing problems?
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_01: But the other side of it is,
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_01: how do you map this against new things
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_01: that you couldn't have done before?
[00:27:44] And this comes back to my point about my form shifts,
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_01: because I see people looking at chat,
[00:27:49] SPEAKER_01: TVT or looking at Genitive AI,
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_01: and saying, well, this is useless,
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_01: because it makes mistakes.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's kind of like looking at an Apple II
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_01: in the late 70s and saying, could you use these to run banks
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_01: to which you answer with no?
[00:28:02] But that's kind of the wrong question.
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_01: Like could you build video editing,
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_01: professional video editing inside Netscape?
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_01: No.
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_01: But that's the wrong question.
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_01: And later, yeah, 20 years later you can,
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_01: but that, meanwhile, it does a whole bunch of other stuff
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_01: in the same with mobile.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_01: Like can you use mobile to replace
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_01: your five screen professional programming with?
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_01: No, therefore it can't replace PCs.
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_01: Well, guess what?
[00:28:26] Five billion people have got a smartphone
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_01: and seven or eight hundred million people
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_01: have got a consumer PC.
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_01: So it kind of did, but did a different thing.
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_01: And the point of this is like the new thing,
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_01: this is the disruption from you mentioned earlier,
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_01: the new thing is generally not very good or terrible
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_01: at the stuff that was important to the old thing,
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_01: but it does something else.
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:28:43] And a lot of the question is, okay,
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_01: it may not be very good at doing,
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_01: there's a class of old tasks that Genitive AI is good at.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_01: There's also a lot many more old tasks
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_01: that Genitive AI is maybe not very good at.
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_01: But then there's a whole bunch of other things
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_01: that you would never have done before.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_01: The Genitive AI is really, really good at.
[00:29:05] And then how do you find a, or think of those?
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_01: And how much of that is the user thinking of it
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_01: faced with a general purpose chatbot?
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_01: How much of that is the entrepreneur saying,
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_01: hey, I've just realized that this is saying
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_01: that I can do that you couldn't do before.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_01: And here you are, I've given you a product
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_01: with a button that will do it for you.
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_01: And why there are software companies?
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_01: And on mobile, some of the new use cases,
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_00: we're getting in strangers cars.
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_00: We mentioned Lapton Uber or sort of dating people
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_00: you might via an app or sort of lending your spare bedroom
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_00: out, et cetera.
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_00: And those were net new companies that were built
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_00: around those behaviors.
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_00: And I think, Freya, I just saw the questions of,
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_00: what are those net new behaviors?
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_00: We're starting to see some in terms of people engaging
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_00: and talking with chatpots instead of humans
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_00: or in addition.
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_00: And then there's a question of, are these done by the model
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_00: providers that currently exist or are these done by
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_00: new companies both on enterprise and consumer?
[00:30:09] Well, this is always a question.
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_01: It's how far the status in you think go.
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_01: And I was talking about this with another former 4MASXGNZ
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_01: person who pointed out that like in the mid 90s,
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_01: people kind of argued that, well, the operating system
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_01: does all of it.
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_01: And the Windows apps are basically just kind of thin
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_01: win 32 wrappers.
[00:30:28] And you know, Office is basically just a thin win 32 wrapper
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_01: like all the important stuff is being done by the OS,
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_01: whether it's the document management and printing
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_01: and storage and display, which all stuff that used to be done
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_01: by apps like in Dondos, the apps had to be printing,
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_01: the apps had to manage to display.
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_01: We moved to Windows, 90% of the stuff that the app used to do
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_01: is now being done by Windows.
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_01: And so Office is just like a thin win 32 wrapper.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: And all the hard stuff has been doing
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_01: being done by the OS.
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_01: And it turned out that, well, that was, again,
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_01: it's like frameworks are useful,
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_01: but that's maybe not a useful way to think about what's going on.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: And the same thing now, like how much does this need
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_01: single dedicated understanding of how that market,
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_01: it works or what that market is and what you would do with that?
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I remember when we were at A16Z,
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_01: there was an investment in a company called Everlaw,
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_01: which is Cloud, legal discovery in the cloud.
[00:31:18] And so machine learning happens,
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_01: and so now they can do translation.
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_01: And they worried that lawyers are going to say,
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_01: well, we don't need you guys anymore.
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_01: We're just going to go and get a translate app
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_01: and a sentiment analysis app from AWS.
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_01: No, that's not how law firms work.
[00:31:32] Law firms want to buy a thing that
[00:31:33] SPEAKER_01: solves this, want to buy legal discovery software management.
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_01: They don't want to go out and write their own,
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_01: buy a do API calls.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: I mean, very, very big law firms might,
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_01: but typical law firm isn't going to do that.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_01: People buy solutions, they do it by technologies.
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_01: And the same thing here, like how far up the stack
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_01: do these models go, how much can you turn things into a widget?
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_01: How much can you turn things into an LLM request?
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_01: And how much node does it turn out that you need
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_01: that dedicated UI?
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_01: The fun thing is you can see this around Google,
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_01: because Google had this whole idea that everything would just
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_01: be a Google query, and Google would work out what the query was.
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_01: And guess what?
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_01: Now you want me to use Google Flites is not a Google query.
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_01: There you have a certain point.
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: And one of the interesting things about this,
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_01: and I think it's interesting to think about what a GUI is doing,
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_01: that some of what a GUI is doing, and the obvious thing
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: that a GUI is doing, is that it enables
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_01: Office to have 500 applications, 500 features,
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_01: and you can find them all.
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_01: Well, at least you don't have to memorize keyboard commands.
[00:32:36] You can now have effectively infinite features,
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_01: and you can just keep adding menus and dialog boxes,
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_01: and eventually you run out of screen space for dialog boxes.
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_01: But you can have hundreds of features
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_01: without people needing to memorize keyboard commands.
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_01: But the other side of it is you're in that dialog box,
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_01: or you're in that screen, in that workflow, in Workday,
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_01: or Salesforce, or whatever the enterprise software is,
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: whatever any software, or the airline website,
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_01: or Airbnb, or whatever it is.
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_01: And there are 600 buttons on the screen.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_01: There's seven buttons on the screen,
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_01: because a bunch of people at that company
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_01: have sat down and thought, what is it
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_01: that the users should be asked here?
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_01: What questions should we give them?
[00:33:13] What choices should there be at this point in the flow?
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_01: And that reflects a lot of institutional knowledge,
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_01: and a lot of learning, and a lot of testing,
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_01: and a lot of really careful thought
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_01: about how this should work.
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_01: And then you give somebody a raw prompt,
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_01: and you just say, OK, you just tell the thing
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_01: how to do the thing.
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_01: And you're right, but you've kind of got to shut your eyes,
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_01: screw your eyes up, and think from first principles,
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_01: how does this all of this work?
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_01: It's kind of like I always use talk about machine learning
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_01: as giving you infinite interns.
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_01: So imagine you've got a task, and you've got an intern,
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_01: and the intern doesn't know what venture capital is.
[00:33:53] How important are they going to be?
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_01: And like, they, and they don't know
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_01: the companies published quarterly reports,
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_01: and that we've got a Bloomberg account
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_01: that lets us look up multiples,
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_01: and then you should probably use pitch book for this data,
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_01: and rather than using Google.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_01: This is my point about deep research.
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_01: Like, no, you should use this source and not that source.
[00:34:19] Do you want to have to work that out from scratch,
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_01: or do you want a bunch of people who know a lot about this stuff
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_01: to have spent five years working out?
[00:34:27] SPEAKER_01: What the choices should be on the screen for you to click on it?
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_01: I'm as old you, though, in today's saying,
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_01: the computer should never ask you a question
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_01: that you should have to work out, that it should know by itself.
[00:34:36] You go to a blank, raw chatbot screen,
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_01: it's asking you literally everything.
[00:34:42] It's not just asking you one question,
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_01: it's asking you absolutely everything
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_01: about what is it is that you want,
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_01: and how you're going to work out what you had to do it.
[00:34:50] The, and so, you know, you're mentioning chat,
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_00: you know, you read about chat GBT
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_00: isn't sort of a product as much as a chatbot,
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_00: as this guy's as a product.
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_00: I'm curious, you know, when we sort of look back
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_00: at this sort of the platform shift,
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_00: do you think that there will be another sort of iPhone,
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_00: sort of ask product or Excel, ask product,
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_00: that kind of defines the feature,
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_00: the sort of platform shift in a way that chat GBT won't
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_00: or is it sort of that the world has to catch up
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_00: to how to use chat GBT or something like chatbot.
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_00: So basically, basically, it's going to be true
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_01: because there was a lot of like it took time
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_01: to realize how you would use Google Maps,
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_01: and then what you could do with Google
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_01: and how you could use Instagram,
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_01: and all of these products have evolved
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_01: a huge amount over time.
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_01: So some of it is like you grow towards realizing
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: what you could do with this,
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: like you realize that's just a Google query now,
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_01: you realize that you could just do it like that,
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_01: and you realize I spent, you know, hours doing this,
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_01: and I just realized, oh, I could actually just make
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_01: a pivot table.
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_01: The other side of it is, then,
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_01: but you're still then expecting people to work it out
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_01: themselves from first principles,
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_01: and, you know, it's kind of useful to have somebody
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_01: really 100,000, 100,000, 10,000 really clever people
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_01: sitting and trying to work out what those things are,
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_01: and then showing it to you as a product.
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_01: I think another side of this is like,
[00:36:12] you know, there were always these precursors.
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_01: So like there were lots of other things before Instagram.
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_00: You know, YouTube didn't start as YouTube,
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_01: it started as video dating, I think.
[00:36:25] SPEAKER_01: There were lots of attempts to do online dating
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_01: that all kind of worked until Tinder
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_01: kind of pulled the whole thing inside out.
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_01: And so there were always lots of things,
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_01: what's the phrase, local maximum?
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_01: In fact, this is where we were particularly with the iPhone.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_01: Before, because I was working in mobile
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_01: for the previous decade,
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_01: it didn't feel like we were waiting for a thing.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_01: It felt like it was kind of working, like every year,
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_01: the network's got faster, and the phone's got better,
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_01: and you got a little bit better over here,
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_01: and we had apps, and we had app stores,
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_01: and we had 3G, and we had cameras,
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_01: and stuff seemed to be, you know, every year,
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_01: it was a bit better, and then the iPhone arrives,
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_01: and it just, you know, bloated the chart,
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_01: kind of, you know, you've got this line doing this,
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_01: and then there's a line that does that.
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_01: Although remember, also the iPhone took me
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_01: like two years before it, but, you know,
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_01: the price was wrong, and the feature set was wrong,
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_01: and the distribution model didn't quite work.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: And so, yeah, you can think your, you know,
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_01: you can think everything is going well,
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_01: and then something comes along and you realize,
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_01: you know, oh, no, no, no, that's,
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_01: which is the same for Google, you know.
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_01: Like, search was a thing before Google,
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_01: it just wasn't really good.
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_01: So, there was lots of social stuff before Facebook,
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_01: and, you know, that was the thing that catalyzed it.
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, I just think, you're terministically,
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_01: this whole thing is so early,
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_01: that it feels like, of course, so are going to be,
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_01: you know, dozens, hundreds of new things,
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_01: otherwise, HGC and Z, you're just kind of shut down,
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_01: and give the money back to the LPs, because,
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_01: right, the fan models will just do the whole thing,
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_01: and I don't think you're gonna do that,
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_01: really, so I hope not.
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, if we have any regrets for the last few years,
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_00: it's not going bigger.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_00: I think we didn't fully appreciate how much specialization
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_00: there would be across, sort of, you know,
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_00: whether it's voice or image generation,
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_00: or take any sort of sub-sector that they would be,
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_00: you know, net new companies created, that would be better,
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_00: than the model providers, that they would be even,
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_00: multiple model providers, that are that,
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_00: in every category, you know, one thing we've always,
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_00: in the web to era, we'll always bet on the category winner, right?
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_00: And the category winner would take most of the market,
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_00: but these markets are so big,
[00:38:28] SPEAKER_00: and there's so much expertise and specialization,
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: that one there can be winners in every category,
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_00: it's not just sort of the model providers taking everything,
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_00: but that even in every category,
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_00: including the model providers,
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_00: there can be multiple winners in increasing,
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_00: you know, specialization,
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_00: and the markets are just big enough to contain multiple winners.
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_00: I think that's right, and I think, you know,
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_01: the categories themselves aren't clear,
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_01: and you know, many, you know,
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_01: things you think this is a category,
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_01: and it turns out, no, it was actually that whole other thing,
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_01: and the categories kind of get unbundled and bundled,
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_01: and recombined in different ways.
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I remember I was a student in 1995,
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_01: and though, I think I had like four or five different web browsers
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_01: on my PC, web web service on my PC,
[00:39:14] because I mean, Tim Berners-Lee's original web browser,
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_01: had a web editor in it,
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_01: because he thought this was kind of like a network drive,
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_01: and it was a sharing system,
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_01: and didn't really, not really a publishing system.
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_01: So you would have your web pages on your PC,
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_01: and you'd leave your PC turned on,
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_01: and that would be how your colleagues would look
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: at your Word documents, or your web pages.
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_01: And so again, like we just don't know how,
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_01: and I just kind of keep coming back to this point.
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_01: I feel like most of the questions we're asking at the moment,
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_01: are probably the wrong question.
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_01: I'm picking up on a strand within what you just said, though,
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_01: the interesting, one of the things I'm sort of thinking about,
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_01: a lot is looking at looking at OpenAI,
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_01: because I'm sort of fascinated by destinations,
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_01: and we've got this interesting disconnect now,
[00:39:54] SPEAKER_01: which is that, you know, if you look at the benchmark scores,
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_01: so you've got these general purpose benchmarks,
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_01: where the models are basically all the same.
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_01: And if you're spending hours a day,
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_01: and then you've got this opinion about,
[00:40:04] SPEAKER_01: oh, I like Clubs, turn a voice more than,
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_01: I like GBT, and I like GBD5.1 more than GBD4.9,
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_01: or whatever the hell it's called,
[00:40:11] if you're using this one as a way,
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_01: you really don't notice the stuff.
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_01: And the benchmark scores are all roughly the same,
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_01: and but the usage isn't.
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_01: It's basically the only,
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_01: the cloud has basically no consumer usage,
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_01: even though on the benchmark score it's the same.
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_01: And then it's chat GBT,
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_01: and then halfway down the chart,
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_01: it's meta and Google.
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_01: And the funny thing is, you know,
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_01: that you read all the AI newsletters,
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_01: then that meta's lost out of the game, they're dead.
[00:40:37] SPEAKER_01: Mark Zuckerberg is spending a billion dollars of research
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_01: to get back in the game,
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_01: but from the consumer side, well, it's distribution.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_01: And the interesting thing here is that you've got,
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_01: what I'm kind of circling around is,
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_01: if the model for a casual consumer user,
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_01: certainly is a commodity,
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_01: and there's no network effects,
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_01: or when it takes all effects yet,
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_01: they may, those may emerge,
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_01: but we don't have them yet.
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_01: And things like memory aren't network effects,
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_01: estic units, but they can be copied.
[00:41:10] How is it that you compete?
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_01: Do you just compete on being the recognized brand
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_01: and adding more features and services
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_01: and capabilities and people just don't switch away?
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_01: Which is kind of what happened with Chrome, for example.
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_01: There's not a network effect for Chrome,
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_01: and it's not actually any better,
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_01: but maybe it's a bit better than Safari,
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_01: but you know, you use Chrome because you use Chrome.
[00:41:32] Or is it that you get left behind on distribution
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_01: or network effects that emerge somewhere else?
[00:41:45] And meanwhile, you don't have your own infrastructure.
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_01: So I suppose what I'm getting at is,
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_01: like you've got these 800 or 900 million weakly active users,
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_01: but that feels very fragile,
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_01: because all you've really got is the power of the default
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_01: and the brand.
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_01: You don't have a network effect,
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_01: you don't really have feature lock-in,
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_01: you don't have a broader ecosystem,
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_01: you also don't have your own infrastructure,
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_01: you don't control your cost base,
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_01: you don't have a cost advantage.
[00:42:11] You get to build every month from satire.
[00:42:15] So you kind of got to scramble as fast as you can
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_01: in base of those directions
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_01: to on the one side build product
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_01: and build stuff that on top of the model,
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_01: which is our earlier conversation, is it just the model?
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_01: Now you've got to build stuff on top of the model
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_01: in every direction.
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_01: It's a browser, it's a social video app,
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_01: it's an app platform, it's this, it's that,
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_01: it's like you know the meme of the guy with the map
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_01: with all the strings on it.
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_01: It's all of these things,
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_01: we're going to build all of them yesterday,
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_01: and then it'll empower us, it's infrastructure.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_01: We've got a deal with OpenAI,
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: we're sorry, deal with Nvidia,
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_01: with Broadcom, with AMD, with Nvidia, with Oracle,
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_01: and with PetroDollars,
[00:42:59] SPEAKER_01: because you're kind of scrambling to get
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_01: from this amazing technical breakthrough
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_01: and these 800, 900 million wows
[00:43:09] SPEAKER_01: to something that has like really sticky,
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_01: defensible, sustainable business value
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_01: and product value.
[00:43:16] Yeah.
[00:43:17] And so as you're evaluating the competitive landscape
[00:43:22] SPEAKER_00: among the hyperscalers,
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_00: what are the questions that you're asking,
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_00: that you think are going to be most important
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_00: in determining who's going to gain durable competitive
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_00: advantages or how this competitive
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_00: is going to, a competition is going to play out.
[00:43:38] Well, this kind of comes back to your point about
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_01: sustaining advantage, and we talked about Google.
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_01: Like if we think about the shift to,
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_01: particularly shift to mobile,
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: for a matter of this turned out to be transformative,
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_01: like in many of the products way more useful.
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_01: For Google, turned out mobile search is just search.
[00:43:58] And maps change probably, and YouTube changed a bit,
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_01: but basically for Google search,
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_01: Google search is search, and the website is just mean
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_01: means more people doing more search, more of the time.
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_01: And the default view now would seem to be,
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_01: well, Gemini is as good as anybody else.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_01: Next week, like the new model,
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_01: I haven't looked at the benchmarks for GPT 5.1,
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_01: which is out today.
[00:44:21] SPEAKER_01: Is it better than Gemini, probably?
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_01: Will it still be better next month's note?
[00:44:27] So that's a given.
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_01: Like you've got a frontier model, fine.
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_01: What does that cost?
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_01: It costs you pick a number, $250 billion a year,
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_01: $100 billion a year.
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_01: What's the, what's the earlier conversation about CapEx?
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so Google can pay that,
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_01: and because they've got the money,
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_01: they've got the cash rate for everything else.
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_01: And so you do that, and you're existing products,
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_01: get you optimize search, you optimize your ad business,
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_01: you build new experiences.
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_01: Maybe you invent the iPhone of AI,
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_01: maybe there is no iPhone of AI,
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_01: maybe someone else does it,
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_01: and you do an Android and just copy it.
[00:45:00] So fine, it's a new mobile.
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_01: We'll just carry on search as such.
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_01: AI is AI, we'll do the new thing,
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_01: we'll make it a feature, we'll just carry on doing it.
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_01: The matter that feels like there are bigger questions
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_01: on what this means to search,
[00:45:14] SPEAKER_01: or what it means for content,
[00:45:17] SPEAKER_01: and social and experience and recommendation,
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_01: which makes it all that more imperative,
[00:45:20] SPEAKER_01: that they have their own models, just as it is for Google.
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_01: For Amazon, okay, well, on the one side,
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_01: it's commodity-infra and we'll sell it as commodity-infra.
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_01: And on the other side, maybe,
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_01: maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_01: maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_01: if you're not a hyperscaler,
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_01: if you're a web publisher, a marketer,
[00:45:39] SPEAKER_01: a brand, an advertiser, a media company,
[00:45:44] you could make a list of questions,
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_01: but like, you don't even know what the questions are right now.
[00:45:49] What is this, what happens if I ask a chatbot,
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_01: a thing instead of asking Google,
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_01: even if it's Google, from Google's point of view,
[00:45:56] SPEAKER_01: what else Google's yeah, but it's fine.
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_01: But as a marketer, what does that mean?
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_01: What happens?
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_01: If I ask for a recipe and the algorithm
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_01: just gives me the answer,
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_01: what does that mean if my business is having recipes?
[00:46:08] Do you have a kind of split between,
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_01: and this is also an Amazon question,
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_01: how does the purchasing decision happen?
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_01: How does the decision to buy a thing
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_01: that I didn't know existed before happen?
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_01: What happens if I wave my phone at my living room
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_01: and say, what should I buy?
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_01: Where does that take me?
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_01: In ways that it wouldn't have taken me in the past.
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_01: So there's a lot of questions further downstream,
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_01: and that goes upstream to meta
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_01: and to stomachs that for Google.
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_01: It's a much bigger question in the long term for Amazon.
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_01: Do LLMs mean that Amazon can finally do really good
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_01: at scale recommendation and discovery
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_01: and a suggestion in ways that it couldn't really do in the past?
[00:46:46] SPEAKER_01: Because of this kind of pure commodity retelling model
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_01: that it has.
[00:46:50] Apple sort of off on one side,
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_01: interestingly, they produced this incredibly compelling vision
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_01: of what series should be two years ago.
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_01: Just turned out that they couldn't make it.
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_01: Interestingly, nobody else could have made it either.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_01: You go back and watch the series demo that they gave
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_01: and you think, okay,
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_01: so we've got multimodal instantaneous
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_01: on device tool using agentic,
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_01: multi-platformy commerce in real time
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_01: with no prompt injection problems and zero error rates.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_01: Well, that sounds good.
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_01: Is anyone got that working?
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_01: No, open up.
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_01: I can go Google and open up.
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_01: I don't have that working.
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_01: I don't think Google or open up.
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_01: I could deliver the series demo that Apple gave to you this year.
[00:47:31] I mean, they could probably do the demo,
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_01: but they couldn't consistently reliably make it work.
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_01: I mean, that demo, that product isn't in Android today.
[00:47:39] And Apple, I mean, Apple Timmy has the most
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_01: kind of intellectually interesting question,
[00:47:43] SPEAKER_01: which is,
[00:47:47] so I saw Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig,
[00:47:48] SPEAKER_01: we can make this point, which is like,
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_01: we don't have our own chatbot fine.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_01: We also don't have YouTube or Uber.
[00:47:55] What explain why that is different,
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_01: which is a harder question to answer than it sounds like.
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_01: And of course, the answer is,
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_01: if this actually fundamentally change
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_01: in each is computing, then it's a problem.
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_01: If it's just a service that you use like Google,
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_01: then that's not a problem,
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_01: which is kind of the point about, you know, where do we go.
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_01: But the interesting kind of example here would be
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_01: to think about what happened to Microsoft in the 2000s,
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_01: which is the entire dev event environment gets away
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_01: from them and no one builds Windows apps
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_01: after like 2001 or something.
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_01: But you need to use the internet,
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_01: to use the internet, you need a PC.
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_01: And what PC are you gonna buy?
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_01: Well, like Apple's not really a player at that time
[00:48:32] SPEAKER_01: and of just getting back into the game Linux
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_01: is obviously not an option for any normal person.
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_01: I'm seeing by Windows PC.
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_01: So basically Microsoft loses a platform or
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_01: and sells an order of magnitude more PCs,
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_01: like well, I'll tell you the book,
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_01: and more to the other,
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_01: an order of magnitude more Windows PCs
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_01: as a result of this thing that Microsoft lost.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_01: And then it takes until mobile,
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_01: that like then they lose the device
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_01: as well as a development environment.
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_01: So there's this kind of question
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: is if all the new stuff is built on AI
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_01: and I'm accessing in app that I download from the out store,
[00:49:01] to what extent is this a problem for Apple?
[00:49:06] And what would have to,
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_01: you would need a much more fundamental shift
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_01: in what it was that was happening
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_01: for that to be a problem for Apple.
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_01: And even if you take like the,
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_01: you know, not the like the full like the rapture arrives
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_01: and we'll just kind of go and leave sleeping pods
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_01: like the guys in up, not up.
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_01: What is it?
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_01: The one with the robot that's capturing the trash,
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_01: which one is that?
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_01: Wally.
[00:49:27] Wally.
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_01: You know the guys in the pods and that maybe,
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_01: wherever you will be,
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_01: people maybe will be like that,
[00:49:32] SPEAKER_01: which is fine.
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_01: But like there's a sort of a mid case,
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_01: which is like the whole nature of software changes
[00:49:36] SPEAKER_01: and there are no apps anymore
[00:49:36] SPEAKER_01: and you just go and ask the LLM thing, fine.
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_01: What is the device on which you ask the LLM thing?
[00:49:41] SPEAKER_01: Well, it's probably going to have a nice big color screen
[00:49:44] and it's probably going to have like a one day battery life.
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_01: It's probably going to be a microphone,
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_01: probably a good camera.
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_01: Just that.
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:49:53] SPEAKER_01: It kind of sounds like an iPhone.
[00:49:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:49:57] Am I going to buy the one that's a tense of the price
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_01: and just use the LLM on it?
[00:50:04] No.
[00:50:05] Because I'll still want the good camera
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_01: and this good screen and the good battery life.
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_01: So it's not, there's a bunch of kind of interesting
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_01: strategic questions when you start poking away.
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_01: Well, what does this mean for Amazon?
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_01: There are completely different questions to what does it mean
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_01: for Google or what does it mean for Apple,
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_01: what does it mean to Facebook or what does it mean to Salesforce,
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_01: what does it mean to Uber?
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_01: And then right back to what we were saying at the beginning
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_01: of this conversation, what does this mean for Uber?
[00:50:32] Well, there are operations get X percent more efficient
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_01: and now the full detection works.
[00:50:39] And maybe there were autonomous cars, different conversation.
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_01: But presumed autonomous cars as a whole other conversation,
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_01: otherwise as Uber, what does this change?
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_01: Well, not a huge amount.
[00:50:50] I want to resume out a little bit, this help framing the,
[00:50:54] so you've been doing these presentations for a while now,
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_00: you've even bumped them up to two times
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_00: because there's so much is changing.
[00:51:00] SPEAKER_00: And one of the things you do in each presentation
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_00: is your famous for asking really quick questions
[00:51:04] SPEAKER_00: and chronicling what are the important questions
[00:51:06] SPEAKER_00: to be asking.
[00:51:08] SPEAKER_00: I'm curious as you reflect maybe post,
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_00: which has GPD in 2022 or GPT-3 rather.
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_00: The questions you were asking then and you reflect on to now,
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_00: to what extent do we have some direction
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_00: on some of those questions or to what extent
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_00: are they the same questions or new and different questions
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_00: or what is sort of your, if I woke up on an Acoma
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_00: after reading your original presentation,
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_00: let's say the one after GPT-3 launch came out
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_00: and then seeing this one now,
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_00: what were the sort of most surprising things
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_00: or things that we learned that updated these questions?
[00:51:47] SPEAKER_00: So I think we have a lot of new questions this year.
[00:51:54] So I feel like you could make a list of,
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_01: as it might be half a dozen questions in spring of 23,
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: like open source, China, Nvidia,
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_01: the scaling continue, what happens to images,
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_01: how long does open AI's lead remain?
[00:52:13] SPEAKER_01: And those questions didn't really change in 23 and 24.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_01: And most of those questions are kind of still there,
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_01: Nvidia question hasn't really changed,
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_01: the answer on China, the answer on,
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_01: how many models will there be?
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_01: The answer is, okay, there's going to be,
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_01: anybody who can spend a couple of billion dollars
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_01: can have a front-end model.
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_01: And I was pretty obvious, you know, in 23.
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_01: It took a while for everyone to understand that.
[00:52:37] SPEAKER_01: And big models and small models,
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_01: will we have small models running on devices?
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_01: I don't know because the small models,
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: the capabilities keep them moving too fast
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_01: for the small models to get,
[00:52:45] SPEAKER_01: just shrink the small model onto the device.
[00:52:46] SPEAKER_01: But those questions kind of didn't change for two, two and a half years.
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_01: I think we now have, I think,
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_01: a bunch of more product strategy questions.
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_01: As you see, real consumer adoption and open AI and Google,
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_01: building stuff in different directions,
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_01: Amazon going in different directions,
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_01: Apple trying and obviously failing in them,
[00:53:05] SPEAKER_01: then trying again to do stuff.
[00:53:07] SPEAKER_01: There's some sense of like,
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_01: there is something more going on in the industry
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_01: than just, well, let's just build another model
[00:53:13] SPEAKER_01: and spend more money.
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_01: There's more questions and more decisions now.
[00:53:18] SPEAKER_01: There's also more questions outside of tech
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_01: in certainly unlike the retail media side of,
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_01: how do you start thinking about what you would do with this?
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_01: And again, you know, classic framing in my deck is,
[00:53:34] SPEAKER_01: like step one, is you make it a feature
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_01: when you absorb it and you do the obvious stuff.
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_01: Step two is you do new stuff.
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_01: Step three is maybe someone will come and pull a whole industry
[00:53:41] SPEAKER_01: inside out and completely redefine the question.
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_01: And so you could kind of do like an imagine if here of like,
[00:53:48] SPEAKER_01: step one is, you know,
[00:53:51] SPEAKER_01: you're a manager at a Walmart in the Bay Area or DC or whatever it is.
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_01: Step one is find me that metric.
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_01: Step two is building a dashboard.
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_01: Step three is it's Black Friday,
[00:54:04] SPEAKER_01: and I'm managing a Walmart outside of DC.
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_01: What should I be worried about?
[00:54:11] Like, and that might be the wrong one,
[00:54:13] SPEAKER_01: but it's like, you know, step one for Amazon
[00:54:16] SPEAKER_01: is you bought light bulbs, so here's,
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_01: so you bought bubble wraps, so here's some packing tape.
[00:54:21] But what Amazon should actually be doing is saying,
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_01: hmm, besides this person's moving home,
[00:54:25] SPEAKER_01: we'll show them a home insurance ad,
[00:54:28] SPEAKER_01: which is something that Amazon's correlation system
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_01: wouldn't get because they wouldn't have that
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_01: in their purchasing data.
[00:54:33] And we're still very much at the like,
[00:54:37] we're still starting it with,
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_01: we're still on the step one of that,
[00:54:40] SPEAKER_01: but thinking much more, what would the step two, step three be?
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_01: What would new revenue be for this other than just like simple
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_01: dumb automation?
[00:54:49] What would new things that we would build with this be?
[00:54:52] SPEAKER_01: Where would this actually like might,
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_01: I might actually kind of redefine or change what the market might look like?
[00:54:59] SPEAKER_01: And that's obviously a big question for anyone in content business.
[00:55:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:55:04] SPEAKER_01: What does it mean if I can just go and ask an LLM this question?
[00:55:09] What kinds of content were predicated on Google
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_01: rooting that question to you?
[00:55:14] SPEAKER_01: And what kind of questions,
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_01: what kind of content isn't really that question?
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_01: Like, do I want a Bologna's recipe,
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_01: or do I want to hear Stanley Tucci talking about cooking in Italy?
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_01: Like, do I just want the answer?
[00:55:30] SPEAKER_01: Do I want that school or do I want to work out which product I should buy,
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_01: which is Amazon is greater getting you the school terrible at telling you what school you want?
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_01: Do I just want the slide deck or do I want to spend a week talking to a bunch of partners
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_01: from Bain about how I could think about doing this?
[00:55:49] SPEAKER_01: Do I just want money or do I want to work with a 16 Z's,
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_01: you know, operating groups?
[00:55:57] SPEAKER_01: Like, what is it that I'm doing here?
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_01: And I think the LLM is starting,
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_01: thing is starting to crystallize that question in lots of different ways.
[00:56:07] SPEAKER_01: Like, what am I actually trying to do here?
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_01: Do I just want to think that a computer can now answer for me?
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_01: Or do I want something else that isn't?
[00:56:15] SPEAKER_01: Because the LLM can do a bunch of stuff that computers couldn't do before.
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_00: Is that thing that the computer couldn't do before my business?
[00:56:24] Or am I actually doing something else?
[00:56:26] SPEAKER_01: We're about to figure out what is the, in a much more granular way,
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_00: what is the true job to be done for many and many of these?
[00:56:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:56:35] SPEAKER_01: I mean, going back to the internet, there was, you know, the sort of observation about newspapers
[00:56:38] SPEAKER_01: is that newspapers looked in the internet and they talked about, you know,
[00:56:41] SPEAKER_01: expertise and curation and journalism and everything else.
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_01: And didn't really say, well, we're a light manufacturing company and a local distribution and trucking company.
[00:56:49] SPEAKER_01: And that was a bit that was the problem.
[00:56:52] And until the internet arrived, like, that wasn't a conversation you thought about,
[00:56:56] SPEAKER_01: and then the internet suddenly makes that clear and suddenly creates an unbundling that didn't exist before.
[00:57:02] SPEAKER_01: And so there will be those kinds of like, you didn't realize you were that before.
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_01: Until an LLM comes along and points to someone comes along with an LLM and says,
[00:57:12] SPEAKER_01: oh, I can use this to do this thing that you didn't really realize with the basis of your
[00:57:16] SPEAKER_01: defensibility or the basis of your profitability.
[00:57:19] SPEAKER_01: I mean, just like the, you know, the joke about, you know, US health insurance,
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_01: like the basis of US health insurance profitability is making it really, really boring and difficult and time consuming.
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_01: That's where the profits come from.
[00:57:30] SPEAKER_01: Maybe it isn't, I don't know, I don't know, that's true.
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_01: But for the sake of argument, say that's your defensibility.
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_01: Well, an LLM removes boring time consuming mind numbing tasks.
[00:57:40] So what industries are protected by having that and they didn't realize that.
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_01: And these, you know, it's like, you could have asked these questions about the internet in the mid 90s or about mobile,
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_01: a decade later.
[00:57:53] And generally, you'd have a half of the question you'd asked would have been the wrong questions in hindsight.
[00:57:57] SPEAKER_01: I remember as a baby analyzed in 2000, everyone kept saying, what's the killer use case for 3G?
[00:58:04] What's a good use case for 3G?
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_01: And it turned out that having the internet in your pocket, everywhere was the use case for 3G.
[00:58:09] SPEAKER_01: But that wasn't the question the people were asking.
[00:58:11] SPEAKER_01: And I'm sure that will be the thing now is there's so much that we will, that will happen and get built
[00:58:20] SPEAKER_01: where you go and you realize, oh, that's how you would do this.
[00:58:25] SPEAKER_01: You can turn it into that.
[00:58:29] And I'm sure you've had this experience seeing entrepreneurs, you know, you get every now and then they come in,
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_01: they catch the thing and you're like, oh, okay, you can turn it into that.
[00:58:40] SPEAKER_01: It didn't, I didn't know, realize it was that.
[00:58:43] No, 100%.
[00:58:44] SPEAKER_01: My last question I'll get you out of here is if we're talking two or three years from now,
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_00: you're doing a presentation and you say, oh, this is actually bigger than the internet.
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_00: Or maybe this is like computing.
[00:58:57] SPEAKER_00: What would need to be true?
[00:58:59] SPEAKER_00: What would need to happen?
[00:59:00] SPEAKER_00: What would evolve our thinking?
[00:59:03] I mean, I kind of, you know, sort of come back to my point about, you know,
[00:59:09] SPEAKER_01: Jews and Christians and Messiah came, nothing happened.
[00:59:12] SPEAKER_01: We forget, I mean, there's maybe two ways, very brief ways to think about this.
[00:59:20] SPEAKER_01: One of them is I think we forget how enormous the iPhone was and how enormous the internet was.
[00:59:25] SPEAKER_01: And you can still find people in tech who claim that smartphones aren't a big deal.
[00:59:31] And this was the basis of people complaining about me like this idiot.
[00:59:34] SPEAKER_01: He thinks like, genitive AI is bigger.
[00:59:36] SPEAKER_01: So silly phones things like, come on.
[00:59:40] SPEAKER_01: I think another answer would be like, I don't want to get into the argument about, you know,
[00:59:47] SPEAKER_01: what is the grace rating capability and benchmarks and, you know, you see lots of five hour long podcasts
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_01: are people talking about this stuff.
[00:59:55] SPEAKER_01: But the stuff we have now is not a replacement for an actual person outside of some very narrow
[01:00:06] SPEAKER_01: and very tightly constrained guard rails, which is what, you know, Demis's point that night,
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_01: it's absurd to say that we have PhD level capabilities now.
[01:00:18] What we would have to be seeing something that would really shift our perception of the capability of this stuff
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_01: so that it's actually a person, as opposed to it can kind of do these people like things
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_01: really well sometimes, but not other times.
[01:00:39] SPEAKER_01: And it's a very tough conceptual thing to think about because, you know, I'm conscious I'm not giving you a
[01:00:48] SPEAKER_01: falsifiable answer, but I'm not sure what a falsifiable answer would be to that.
[01:00:53] SPEAKER_01: When would you know whether this was a GI?
[01:00:55] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's the Larry Tesla line AI is whatever doesn't work yet.
[01:00:58] SPEAKER_01: As people see, as people say, it works, people say, well, that's just not AI.
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_01: That's just software.
[01:01:03] It's a, you know, it's a, it's a, and it becomes like a kind of a slightly drunk philosophy
[01:01:11] SPEAKER_01: Bradstudent kind of conversation as much as it is a technology conversation.
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_01: Like, what would it have you ever considered Eric that maybe we're not either.
[01:01:20] SPEAKER_01: As a thought.
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_01: All I can say to aren't give a tangible answer to this question is, what we have right now,
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_01: isn't that will it grow to that?
[01:01:36] SPEAKER_01: We don't know.
[01:01:37] SPEAKER_01: You may believe it will.
[01:01:38] SPEAKER_01: I can't tell you that you're wrong.
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_01: We'll just have to find out.
[01:01:42] SPEAKER_01: I think it's a good place to wrap the, the presentation is AI.
[01:01:45] SPEAKER_00: It's the world.
[01:01:46] SPEAKER_00: We'll link to it.
[01:01:47] SPEAKER_00: It's fantastic.
[01:01:48] SPEAKER_00: Ben, I think so much for coming to the podcast to discuss it.
[01:01:51] Good job.
[01:01:51] Thanks a lot.
