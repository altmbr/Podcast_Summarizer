[00:00:00] The thing that is fundamentally different about this product cycle is that the software itself can actually do the work.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_01: And therefore, the market opportunity for software today is no longer just IT spend, it's largely the labor.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_01: It's not like all the jobs will go away. I actually think that's not going to happen at all. There are a lot of things where...
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: If I could hire somebody for a dollar to do this task, I would 100% do that.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: I've never been able to hire somebody for a dollar. Now I can hire software for a dollar.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_00: While it is important to understand model capabilities and what's happening in the frontier,
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_01: you still need to figure out how to apply that technology.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_01: I think modes matter just as much as they did before.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_00: The one change is that in this supply-demand equation, there's conceptually more supply of software on the cup.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_00: Because the barrier to creating this stuff has gone down dramatically.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_00: I think AI is an incredible tool for differentiation.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: The idea that a voice agent can speak in 50 languages fully-compliantly 24-7 highly differentiated,
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: you know, certainly versus the human.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_01: The AIness of that capability in my opinion is not a source of defensibility.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_01: It is just so consensus. Like cloud was not consensus.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_00: Mobile was not consensus.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_00: And that's why the incumbent's kind of screwed up.
[00:01:12] We've spent a lot of time talking about modes and how modes have evolved.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_02: And are there still even modes in this new era?
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_02: And so one, you reflect and share some of the conversations we've had here.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_02: Some of your perspectives on this broader, broader mode question.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_02: Maybe David will start with you.
[00:01:28] Maybe just to jump right into it with a hot take.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_01: I think mode still matter.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of the modes still matter.
[00:01:35] Still matter exactly.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_01: And I think they're largely the same.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: I often think about this between sort of differentiation and defensibility.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: I think AI is an incredible tool for differentiation.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_01: The idea that a voice agent can speak in 50 languages fully-compliantly 24-7
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_01: highly differentiated, you know, certainly versus the human.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_01: But the source, the AI-ness of that capability in my opinion is not a source of defensibility.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: It's largely differentiation.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_01: The defensibility of a software product resides in my opinion
[00:02:07] from owning the end-end workflow, from the context in which that it's applied.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_01: Becoming the system of record, having a network effect, deeply embedding yourself within
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_01: your customer.
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_01: And I think these were the heuristics that we're always,
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_01: things that we would always look for when evaluating software companies.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: I think the thing that is fundamentally different about this product cycle is that
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_01: the software itself can actually do the work, right?
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: And therefore, the market opportunity for software today is no longer just IT spend.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_01: It's largely labor.
[00:02:36] The challenge often has been that everybody can build something at small scale.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_00: And a lot of the, I wouldn't call them network effects, but some of the defensibility
[00:02:49] modes only become a parent at large, large scale.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_00: So like a lot of people talk about like, okay, I mean, it take an example from like the long
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: long time ago, pre-AI era, if I am building an anti-fraud company.
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_00: And I've seen lots of people, right?
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: Am I going to do a better job than a net new anti-fraud company that's seen a few people?
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: And the reason why this would be called a data network effect, although there's another
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_00: podcast that Martin and I did a long time ago, debating whether or not data network effects are real.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: But it's something that really, it's almost like gravity, gravity actually, like one
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: atom actually has the exerts gravity on you. But you only really see it at like very, very large
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: scale, like the earth, you notice the gravity, the sun, you notice the gravity Jupiter, you notice
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_00: the gravity, you don't notice it for like that glass. And it's the same thing for a lot of these
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: data network effects, where at very, very small scale, when you have 20 companies that are all
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_00: saying, I'm going to stop fraud. Like, all right, they're all building the same things, they all
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: have the same algorithms. But when you've seen four billion people and you know like these people
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: are bad, now you can sell each incremental customer, each customer of your anti-fraud technology to
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: use this example, because you've seen more customers and you can get actually better results.
[00:04:02] But the challenge is that a lot of these, these modes only really are evident at mega, mega,
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_00: mega scale. And the same argument would apply. It's like, oh, like I've seen four customers,
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: David, seen three. I've seen four. He's seen three. Pick my software. But it's like, you've
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_00: seen four customers. That means there are eight billion customers you haven't seen. There are eight
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_00: billion customers he hasn't seen. Like, what's the difference? Whereas at mega scale, it's like, all right,
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_00: I've seen four billion customers. He's seen one billion customers. Well, it's actually kind of easy
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: to see that the results of my product will be better. But that's at scale. And a lot of the question
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: is like on the zero to one phase, it's hard to make the argument that like I have better, like if
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: it's fraud, I had better fraud underwriting. If it's, you know, AI do the work like I've done more
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: phone calls to a particular type of customer. And therefore I do a better job. It's hard to make
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: that argument at sub scale. So, and this is often the challenge is that it's kind of self-evident
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: that if you become the biggest company in the world, then you have a mode. But how do you get to
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: the scale where you actually could show that you can't get to that scale if you have nine million
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_00: ankle bitters. And you are yourself an ankle letter of just we are trying to get to scale. And nobody
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_00: can because it's so easy to actually produce software. And that's kind of the, that's the double
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_00: edge sort of AI is that it's very, very easy to produce software. Everybody can go do something
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_00: that is a very obvious idea because it's obvious everybody's going to go build it. But can you get to
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: the type of scale where you actually could show a mode? And that that has gotten, you know, arguably
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: harder because you have a larger end count of potential cost or sorry potential competitors.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: But if you get to mega scale, then you could show the mode. And that's kind of the zero to one
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: versus one to end. Maybe talk about what's different about defensibility for even the bigger players
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_02: today in the AI era than it was. And let's say the web two air are the companies today more
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_02: defensible less defensible or how do we think about the sort of the strength? I don't know. I think
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_00: the less defensible part, I mean, this is, this is why a lot of enterprise software has gotten
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: beaten up in the public markets. It's kind of two reasons. Number one is that if you're doing
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_00: per-seat pricing, like how do you come up with a pricing model that people feel is fair? And a lot
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_00: of it is just psychology. And for whatever reason for the last 20 years, it's like per-seat per month
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_00: with like, you know, you've heard my joke, the the tall grandeventy model of like software charging.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: It's like somehow that felt fair. And whether that is fair or not, like I don't know, but like people
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_00: are like, oh yeah, it's like $85 a seat per month. Yeah, okay. That sounds reasonable. Whereas if
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_00: you if you proposed that pricing 40 years ago, you would have been laughed out of town. So this just
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_00: became the norm. And the reason why, as I was saying, public software companies have been beaten up
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: a little bit is like, uh oh, maybe you won't sell as many seats. Like is Adobe gonna sell as many
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: seats if now you don't have to hire as many graphics designers or a zendesk going to sell as many
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: seats if the software does answer as all the queries. Like the answer is no. It doesn't mean that
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: the companies are toast. They might actually quit tumbling their revenue because now they charge
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: per outcomes as opposed to charging per seats. But that's kind of part one. Part two is wait a minute.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_00: Now everybody can vibe code up a zendesk competitive. So maybe companies will just start they'll stop
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_00: buying software. This one, I don't think we've seen it all. But I think there is that like these
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_00: two-sided, these two risks. But to answer your question, does defensibility change? Well, if you now
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: are able to code your own software, like why am I paying like your margin is my opportunity? Well,
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: look at the margin of software companies. Like Salesforce has like an 80% gross margin. Like they
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: should have a 1% gross margin. Or you know, nobody should use Salesforce anywhere. That that would be
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_00: the pro case of modes really starting to disintegrate. But I don't think we've seen that happen at all.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_00: Because it turns out people on the one hand, two things are actually happening. One is that this
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: is kind of like Clay, Christian, Synthere. It's like the incumbents overshoot the market. So the
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: amount of features in Salesforce or zendesk or NetSuite, it way exceeds the feature set that you need
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_00: and that any individual customer needs because it's meant to encompass. It's like all of these weird
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: edge cases and you kind of see this if you use Microsoft Word. When was the last time you wrote a book?
[00:08:18] When? Never, right? I'm a render book. It has all of these things. They probably have 50 software
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: engineers. Yeah. But if you do write a book, guess what? Microsoft Word has all these features
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: just for book authors to like make a table of contents or something. It's like, I don't use that.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: So they keep bundling more stuff in there. So they overshoot the market. And theoretically,
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: it's going to make it easier for somebody. But you know, so that, but but I kind of go back to
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: what I where I started with this topic. Like it turns out that this concept of I'm just going to
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_00: vibe code Microsoft Word. It's like there are all these there are these edge cases that you just
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_00: don't know about. So it's actually, you know, why don't you grow your own food or well-druroin
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: aluminum or build your own house? It's just it's kind of easier to use this concept of comparative
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_00: advantage. And just say I'm going to buy something off the shelf. So anyway, so I think Moats matter
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: just as much as they did before. The the one change is that in the supply demand equation,
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_00: there's conceptually more supply of software on the cup. Because the the barrier to creating
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_00: this stuff has gone down dramatically. I think the flip side to that too is that while there will be
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_01: more software. And again, the kind of marginal cost of producing software is into declining
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_01: asymptotically toward zero. The way that these companies are getting more deeply entrenched
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_01: within their customers has has differed because again, the software is doing the work and therefore
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: in many cases is actually replacing labor. And so if you've transitioned a team out that has now
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_01: become, you know, your software, like you're now much more dependent on that product to run your
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_01: business. You know, and again, you know, is it more difficult to replace that software with another
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_01: piece of software to rehire that team? I think it's an open question. But again, the software is
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: is doing more of the work and therefore I think getting more deeply embedded within their
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_01: customers. One part of it is just like the Goldilocks zone of pricing. So, and I wrote some
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_00: tweet or whatever it's called X thread about this long time ago, I call it the janitorial services
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_00: problem because if I went to you, you're the CEO of a giant company where you write your books
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_00: in the future. So you have a 300,000 person company. I find you as like Eric, I can get your toilets
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: 9% cleaner and save you 1% on your toiletry spend or your your janitorial services spend.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_00: Not only do you not care, you don't even care enough, you don't you won't even like exercise
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: the mental energy to find the person in the company who does care. Right? And that means that your
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_00: janitorial services spend will never change. And the problem is it's hard to get in. The good news
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_00: is it's hard to get out. Whereas for something it's like 90% of my profits go to like you the general
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: to I'm now 90% of your profits as the CEO of GE. They're going to me. Your number one priority is
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_00: like getting the hell off of me. Right? And like doing RFPs left and right. So part of it is also
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: just like how relevant this is. And there are some companies that operate in this Goldilocks
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_00: zone of irrelevance like these janitorial services where even if you have 9 million competitors,
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_00: like they're just not going to go anywhere, which is why like a lot of the strategy that we talk
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_00: about internally is Greenfield. Right? It's like those companies are they're they're stuck for good.
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_00: Is there a high rate of new company creation that will not use the crappy old janitorial services
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_00: company, but will actually resident like your pitch of like I will get your toilets cleaner. And I
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_00: will charge you less money that really resonates. But that's that's not going to resonate to the people
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_00: that are using the old fashioned stuff. What are examples of of of company your space in the Goldilocks
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_02: zone and what was an example of a company's space in the Greenfield zones? Well, like payroll companies.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_00: Right? Like ADP and paychecks. I mean, these are companies that are collectively worth hundreds of
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_00: billions of dollars. Very, very profitable. And how does like you could do your own payroll? Actually,
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_00: it's kind of a good metaphor for software in general. Like why is it that you have to like why can't
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: I just pay you? Your mind employee? Why can't I just like cut you a check? Well, because I have to
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_00: withhold taxes. Well, how much tax do I have to withhold? Well, it depends. Right? And there is
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_00: this like super complicated lookup table. It's like well, you live in this county, but you spend
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_00: and this many days in New York and this then the other thing. Oh, and you you you you you oh,
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_00: like child support and the IRS is garnishing your wages like all of these things that are very
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_00: complicated. So it turns out it's just cheaper to go to ADP and ADP just charge you like I don't
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: like 50 bucks a month per person that you might be paying 100. It's a it's a it's a poultry sum
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_00: compared to the overall amount of payroll. So nobody really switches their payroll companies.
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_00: Like that would be an example of one on the other side. I had a lot of companies coming out of
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: 2022 where the market really went through a downturn and they're like, wait a minute, I'm spending
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_00: for I had a thousand employees. I downsize to 200 employees. I had a thousand licenses for
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: Salesforce. Right? What's a thousand times a hundred dollars a month times 12? That's 1.2 million
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_00: dollars a year. Wow. Like that's a lot of money because I only have 200 employees and only
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: have six months of cash. Like I got to save that and they didn't do that for their payroll spent.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_00: So you see it like a lot of companies do want to rationalize their overall software cost,
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_00: especially for these things where they recognize an aggregate like most people aren't actually
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_00: using the seats. So I'd say like you know Salesforce type stuff, you know some of the creative tools
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: like if you like a Adobe is very expensive and you might just do like a wall-to-wall license
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_00: saying why not. But then you look at if you're like how do I save five million dollars, nobody's
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: using this while it's five million dollars. Whereas for things where inextricably the delivery
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: and the payment are linked, right, which is very, very different than per se pricing for software.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: Like payroll like obviously I'm not going to pay for payroll services unless you're employed
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_00: whereas I might like we have 600 people that work at our firm. I think we have 600 licenses from
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_00: Microsoft Office 365. Like we probably I bet there are a lot of people here who have not opened
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_00: Microsoft Excel in a year. So why are we paying for that? And that would be the idea of kind of
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_00: rationalizing software spend. So it kind of depends but I think per se pricing where it's like it's
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: just easier to pay for the entire thing wall-to-wall, you know you're in your entire organization.
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_00: Those are often the first to go versus things that are again inextricably linked to the actual usage.
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So you mentioned earlier that we've seen, you know basically you mentioned there was this
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_02: concern that maybe instead of Zendesk, you know, companies will, you know, they'll be a vibe-coded
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_02: version of it but we've seen none of that so far. Your mental model is we'll see it in examples
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_02: where the cost is significantly high or in which there's sort of greenfield in opportunities
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_02: what is your mental model for the types of software that will replace? Yeah. I mean, I think the greenfield
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: one is always true but when you look at greenfield opportunities, you need two things to be true.
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_00: You need the entrepreneur to be very, very patient and say I'm not going to try to sell to everybody
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: who's if I'm starting a net new payroll company, I'm not going to try to sell to GE because I
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_00: recognize that they are, they're hostages to ADP and that's never going to change. So one is
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_00: that patience of entrepreneur and the other one is you just need a high enough rate of new company
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_00: creation to really make it work which is why I like to pick on one space of electronic health records
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: or electronic medical records, how many new hospital systems are created every day, I mean it rounds
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_00: to zero. So if I'm trying to go build a new EHR system to go compete with Epic or Surner,
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_00: I can do that. There are a lot of edge cases there but it's like and I might have patience as an
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_00: entrepreneur but wait a minute, like I need to sell five million dollar deals to big hospital
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: systems, every single hospital on earth is currently using an EHR system going to be really,
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: really hard to make that work. So I think I think both of those need to be true like the right
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_00: tech of entrepreneur who's willing to be patient because it's often a very lonely game of it's like
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_00: I built this great product, wait a minute, I don't have any customers yet and you want to see
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: high traction because you're seeing in the rest of the market like some companies are just going
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_00: like this and my company's not and I'm in Silicon Valley and I need to recruit the best people,
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: it's like they want to work at the company that has the graph like this but you need this
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_00: greenfield requires patience. So we're talking about how moats still matter and in many ways they
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_02: they look pretty similar. Let's steal man the other side for a second, where are we even having
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_02: this conversation where some people say hey, you know brand is the is is is is is is shipping velocity
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_02: or because this area is different, what are the what's the steel man of the argument?
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_02: Look I think this market is no easier than ever right and so I think finding ways to sort of
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_01: you know stand out from the crowd probably matters more today than it has you know in the past
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_01: I would argue. I think the other thing is that the underlying technology is changing so quickly and so
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_01: you know as a founder you want to be living on the frontier and understanding kind of what model
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_01: capabilities look like because it can dramatically change the the efficacy or the the you know
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_01: the capability of underlying product and so I think you know one of the things that's changed I
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: think it's been really interesting in this sort of you know curve wave of especially vertical
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: applications that we've seen is is the type of founder. You know I think founders today are often
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_01: younger and more technical than we've seen in in prior generations you know and and so they're
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_01: less often native to the particular industry but they're fluent in the tool set right and I think
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_01: that's really important because you know to the same point you you got to you got to stay on the
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_01: frontier and understand what's coming at the same time you know I wrote this piece that I call
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_01: context is king you know while it is important to understand you know model capabilities and what's
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_01: happening in the frontier you still need to figure out how to apply that technology and so while
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_01: the founders themselves are maybe less native to the particular industry they're still hiring for
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_01: context you know very early in a company's life cycle a good example of this that I said on the
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_01: board of is a company called the Eve you know the two founders of Eve for the earliest employees
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_01: at rubric which is you know now public infrastructure company you know they built a legal AI
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_01: company in the plaintiff law space neither of them had any particular background and employment law
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_01: or or personal injury but they deeply understood you know how to apply you know document extraction
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_01: technology and and sort of you know voice and elements more broadly to this very particular work
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_01: you know workflow and they've hired a plaintiff attorney's actually on staff so anytime a new model
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_01: is released you know they're understanding you know from people in industry the impact that it's
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_01: having on drafting on you know their build you do you know to reason through a case you know it
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_01: were a matter um and so again it's sort of this tension of like you know building the brand
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_01: of having momentum you know understanding what's happening in the frontier and yet you know
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_01: fearing out ways to apply that technology in the context you know of your specific the customer
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_01: because again I I deeply believe that that is where a lot of the sources of defensibility reside you
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_01: know I'm I'd love to find other examples of businesses is where the technology like reinforces
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_01: their business model it doesn't compete with it meaning yeah in lots of areas of legal if you make
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_01: your employee 50 times more efficient you're eroding your billable hour in their business they
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_01: operate a contingency basis meaning you know they only get paid if they make if they win so there's
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: no sort of limit to the amount of AI that they want to adopt and if you can become five X-Mar
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_01: Fish and you can take on five X-Mar clients um anyway these are sort of characteristics that I
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: think you know I love to find more of and hopefully that can be kind of a bad signal too maybe the
[00:19:42] other steel man is if you believe that brand matters which it almost total logically does because
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_00: what do I buy I buy the thing that I've heard of right so there's an advantage there and if you
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_00: believe that for a lot of companies and products somehow having scale is effective right so not a
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: network effect but a scale effect so if I'm honey nut Cheerios and I know that people are going to buy
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: lots of my Cheerios I can I can build a big factory and not you know hand crank out each Cheerio
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to have these compounding advantages just in terms of economies of scale right like
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_00: Amazon is that does that really have a network effect no it's like it's kind of nice that everything
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_00: that I buy will show up the next day or in two days and how can they do that at low cost because so
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_00: many people are buying things so there are some things that have scale and those things also benefit
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_00: from brand so if you can move the fastest right so if you can agglomerate capital and labor so it's
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_00: like I raise the most money it's a very very generic idea but somehow like most other things on
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_00: planet earth if it's the biggest and like really really big kind of gravitational scale then it's
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: just going to work better so can I get there the most quickly but there are 20 companies that are
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_00: doing the exact same thing and at that point I wouldn't say that momentum is a moat per se but
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_00: momentum has the highest chance of getting you to gravitational scale where you do have a moat
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_00: and if you don't do that by contrast you're just going to get eaten alive because you can't hand
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: crank out the Cheerios you have to get to the scale where you're able to build a factory and with
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_00: the you have the biggest factory you can crank out the most things at the lowest cost so what is the
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_00: trajectory what is the slope of you versus all of your competition and if you have not a good slope
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: you're just not going to win that game. Yeah one of the questions for defense ability and
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_02: web two companies was hey would Google you know would those will they some some day build us or
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_02: air facebook or near incumbent in in the a irates it will open a i or will some other you know major
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_02: company how should company how should we think about that framework in the a ira.
[00:21:51] You know it I mean it's funny I feel like 18 months ago this you know GPG Rapper was on
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_01: everybody's lips and I think it was it was largely used as a pejorative you know it's like and I
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_01: think you know to some degree I think there are some spaces where like the model capability and
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_01: the application capability are if they're very overlapping I think you're in a in a risky spot you
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_01: know but the reality is that there's so many I think one of the remarkable things that's happened is
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_01: there's so many markets that were never particularly interesting to sell software into they're now
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_01: radically interesting spaces to build companies in again in large part because you know the market is
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_01: now labor not just I T spend plaintiff lobbying an example you know you know Alex has we have a
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_01: company called salient in applying voice agents to auto loan servicing five six years ago we'd
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_01: back to software company selling to you know non bank auto lenders probably not the companies do
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_01: incredibly well again in large part because you know the capability of being able to you know
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_01: speak in 50 languages you know fully complyingly you know with with customers in 50 states working 24
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_01: seven you know it's just so differentiated you know versus the individual and they're finding that
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_01: their ability to collect is meaningfully higher you know than than that labor that the that the kind
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_01: of cost benefit tradeoff is so dramatic the company is getting a lot of you know revenue from those
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_01: customers who may not have had you know millions of dollars of of IT budget historically are now very
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_01: willing to pay for a product like that you know given the impact on the business and in the way that
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_01: we used to talk about this a long time ago is and this this almost had a pejorative slant to it but
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_00: it's like are you building a feature a product or a company and what's the difference between the three
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_00: well a feature is like there's an existing product and you tweak that product to make it marginally
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_00: better a product is you know not that it's like some hopefully system of record or something that
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_00: keeps track of something and then a company is probably the most offensive of those three where
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_00: you have a product and you know maybe you own a platform like the platforms tend to be the most
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_00: valuable companies but you know a feature is like I built a chrome plug-in and that doesn't mean
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: and like there by the way there were a lot of chrome plugins like honey was a chrome plug-in that
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_00: got bought by Ford for for four billion dollars like I wish I had done that right that's that's a good
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_00: feature but that was a feature you know a product would be like well I built my own browser and
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_00: a company is like all right well like my own browser company actually makes money like you don't
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_00: actually have a company even if you have 10 products if you don't have a sustainable path to have
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_00: that company be around in 10 or 20 years and I think kind of another way of thinking about what
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_00: David just said is that now the features like you know the feature was the most pejorative and
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_00: seemingly small of all of those three almost obviously some of the features can be incredibly
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_00: profitable because it's like wait a minute like this it feels like a feature because it could get
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_00: added to Salesforce right or could get added to one of these other things but the amount of money
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_00: that I can charge for my feature is like orders of magnitude more because it's like hey I'm going to
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_00: be the front office receptionist for your you know orthodontic clinic like that's my job like that's
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_00: my so that's that's that's the feature and it sits on top of whatever software you currently use
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_00: but the feature I can now charge $20,000 a year for because it is doing the job of laborer but uh-oh
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_00: will the existing product that my feature is riding on top of will they go build those those
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_00: pieces of functionality and or will another company show up that just says hey we're going to sell
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_00: the green field with the new product that kind of has this feature set embedded and you know feature
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_00: product company it still is out there but um I've just never seen a world where the features if you
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_00: will can can get to revenue scale as quickly and by the way you you kind of often have to start with
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_00: the feature because a customer isn't like think of it from the customer's perspective the customer
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_00: being the business buyer of software it's like I know I want to be locked into a piece of shit
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_00: software company for 20 years that's what I'm looking for as a buyer no it's like oh I have a
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_00: problem to solve my problem is I can't hire a front office receptionist for my orthodontic clinic
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_00: or I can't call people in Mandarin or Cantonese to go like repay their auto loans like what do I do
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_00: oh something shows up and it offers that functionality boom I'm a buyer and then that functionality
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_00: has to that that feature has to backfill product backfill company as quickly as possible so that's
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: still true today as it was 10 or 20 or 30 years ago um but the difference again is that the feature
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_00: the revenue for the feature is just so high and the demand for it is so high because again in many
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_00: cases you're just responding to help want of that it's effectively yeah and so I think the effect
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_01: of that is that there's been sort of like a Cambrian explosion of interesting markets to go after
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_01: you know I think it's unrealistic to believe that like opening has going to go build you know the
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_01: the you know front office assistant for the you know the dental clinic like as their core
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: you know kind of business they're going to do that across every single market I think the other
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: dynamic is that for many of these companies part of the product values actually orchestrating the
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_01: work across lots of different model companies and so I think having one you know uh you know
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_01: foundation model business you know going kind of up the stack I think limits the actual impact of
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: the actual of the application but you know potentially as well well I think the you know if you kind
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_00: of think about this versus other platform companies um so Facebook was the preeminent platform
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_00: company of web 2.0 so call it from whenever they open up Facebook platform which I think it was like
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_00: 2007 um people built their businesses on top of Facebook Facebook would never do those particular
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_00: things like so Facebook is never going to show up and say hey you know what we should build a farming
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: game like they were like no we're going to have a platform that allows companies like Zenga to build
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_00: these farming games but what the platform normally does if they don't actually go compete with the
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_00: the underlying products is they say I'm going to tax it but I'm going to tax it in ways that are
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_00: kind of at my fancy so this week it's 10% taxes that's my promise oh wait I changed my mind now it's
[00:27:49] SPEAKER_00: going to be 40% taxes so that's why it's always dangerous to build on somebody else's platform
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_00: so I think the two things to look at are number one is will the platform owner compete with what
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_00: I'm doing um and that's also another Goldilocks own question right because why is it I published
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_00: this graph of Visit Cali versus Lotus 1 2 3 versus Excel so Visit Cali convention in 1979 had 100
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_00: percent of the market because they were the only player in town Lotus built a better version of that
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_00: Lotus got to like I think 70% market share by 1985 which was when Microsoft released Excel for a Mac
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_00: and then by 2000 Microsoft had 96% market share and why is it because they owned windows like the
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_00: platform owner normally went so but that's because it was just such a like why do I buy a computer
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_00: in 1997 because I want to use a spreadsheet like it was just so intrinsically linked like that was
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_00: one of the main use cases for computers and business use right it's like using spreadsheets so that
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_00: was like a violator of Goldilocks own whereas other things where it's like all you have to worry about
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_00: from the platform owner is that they're going to tax you but they might tax you in very very bizarre
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_00: ways but part of what David was saying in terms of like there are multiple model companies which is
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_00: great like the problem with windows was that it was like 95% of the market like 95% of your customers
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_00: used windows so if I'm going to go build a competing spreadsheet I'm just toast because the platform
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_00: owner is just going to drown me now there are five model companies or you know more like when you
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_00: include all the Chinese models and whatnot open source like I don't have to worry about that but
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_00: I do have to worry about them saying wow this is so relevant like why is it that open AI got a
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_00: public company CEO to quit her job and just to become the CEO of applications at open AI maybe because
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_00: they have a huge application opportunity but this is the nice thing is that a lot of these things
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_00: are so obscure but they're still big but I don't think open AI is going to go do them because
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_00: it's like are they going to do like dental care management like they could but if they've done that
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_00: then I would be sure to open AI because it's like they've run out of good stuff to do that's something
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_00: that they should do in 2029 and then this is I think I told you this the story before this is I
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_00: I this changed my outlook on life when I pitched this guy Dan Rose at Facebook who was running
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_00: business development there I'm like this is a huge opportunity you should use us for payments
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_00: we're going to do this we can make so much money for Facebook and he was so patient and nice and
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_00: I love this guy I'm on a board with him to this day it was like Alex that's such a great idea I was
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_00: all right I got the deal yes he said it's a great idea but we're not going to do it because you're
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_00: pitching me a goal like we have gold bricks all around us like and he was right I mean like Facebook
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_00: in 2010 I mean how much my Facebook has grown their revenue they have more profit every quarter today
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_00: than they had revenue per year in 2010 it's just such an incredible company and he's like you're
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_00: pitching me a gold brick that's like a hundred feet away and it's real like I love that gold
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_00: brick but we have like hundreds of gold bricks where I just have to like stoop down at my feet and
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_00: pick them up so I'm just not going to do that one right there and that's how these big companies
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_00: think but the nice thing is that these are gold brick I think these gold bricks are bigger than
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_00: they've ever been because you have software that can do the job of labor yeah which is on that note
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_02: if you were running open AI and you were thinking about which gold bricks are how do you even
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_02: would meant a lot of them to think about sort of what are the things that you should be doing first
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_02: first the things that hey maybe let other people do it how would you be thinking about that question
[00:31:16] I mean I think a lot of it is where well it's two things number one is we want to be the back end
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_00: for everybody like the platform I think it's two things number one is can we be the platform for
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_00: pretty much everybody who's building anything so we're not going to go into these obscure spaces like
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_00: you know orthodontic care at least not until you know 2045 so let's make sure that every single developer
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_00: is using us and this is part of why Microsoft crushed Apple in the 1980s because Apple made it
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_00: really hard to develop software and what's actually kind of interesting is that both Apple and
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_00: Microsoft had like Microsoft started off as a compiler company like they're very very first products
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_00: they were not Microsoft Office it was not DOS they built a basic interpreter for the programming
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_00: language basic and they had a big business their biggest competitor was Borland which only made
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_00: compilers and like the early rallying cry if you talk to any early Microsoft employee was beat
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_00: Philippe Philippe Khan was the CEO of Borland so Microsoft was focused on that made a lot of money
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_00: on that and Apple was like we should make money on that too and they had a product it was called MPW
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_00: Macintosh programmer's workshop I remember I used to use it in the 1980s and it was like $2,000 I
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_00: think in 1980s money to buy this you know IDE or you know programming thing and it's like how do
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_00: you afford that so like but it was like we have to make money on that Microsoft's making money on
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_00: this and then lo and behold there were like 10,000 times more you know DOS and Windows software
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_00: products than there were back in touch software products and of course Apple corrected that mistake
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_00: when the iPhone came out when they did now like Xcode which is the way that you build products for
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_00: Mac products or Macintosh and iPhone iOS it's free so like they kind of corrected that mistake
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_00: but I'd say two things to answer your question number one is can we be the biggest consumer brand
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_00: in the world so chat GPT is 800 million weekly active users like get that to 5 billion right like
[00:33:10] is even if Gem Gem night three came out today it might be five times better but are people that are
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_00: using chat GPT just as consumers are they going to switch like maybe but it's unlikely just because
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_00: they kind of make that their default and then be the backend for everybody who's building anything
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_00: and that way it's like kind of all the gold bricks kind of come to you.
[00:33:32] I think the other thing that we should anticipate already beginning to see from some of these
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_01: big model companies are like what are the big horizontal applications that they can likely sell
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_01: to every you know large enterprise and I think you saw today with you know Google's
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_01: anti-gravity launch like the IDE is going to be one of those things I think like that you know if
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_01: there's like product market fit for for LMS like you know coding is definitely you know one of the
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_01: top categories so I think that you know thinking about what are the big horizontal kind of
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_01: applications in the enterprise I think there's also to some degree and you know we'll I think
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_01: this has been earlier to sort of play out it's sort of the Palantir opportunity right I think
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_01: we're still very early in sort of the proliferation this technology into large enterprise
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_01: at the same time you know unlike prior product cycles you know you know like the cloud
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_01: if I'm the CEO of a large public company and I'm asking myself do I need to be in the cloud
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_01: it was sort of an esoteric idea you know today I can plug up you know prompt into any one of these
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: models and intuitively understand the impact that it could have on my business right the the efficiency
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_01: gains in my customer support organization my engineering organization in all of my backoffers
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_01: functions at the same time many of them don't know where to start and so I think you will see sort of
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_01: consultative sort of forward deployed Palantir asks sort of sale into very large enterprise from
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_01: some of these you know big model companies again I think we're early in that but you've you've
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_01: heard inklings of this with you know with Anthropic talking about wanting to build into financial
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_01: services and other markets so you know I agree I think the biggest opportunities are the one that
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_01: Alex is describing but I think you will see them selectively you know try to build kind of
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_01: applications that cut cut across every one of those and then they'll probably choose you know a few
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_01: sort of like lighthouse customers to build you know largely bespoke kind of custom integrations into
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_01: these you know bigger enterprises but where the ACBs you know just really make sense in in in web 2 there
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_02: was a lot of winner take most you were talking about one of the benefits in the eyes that there's
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_02: multiple winners to what extent is is consolidation inevitable or how do you think sort of this this
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_02: split plays out well I think if you have 20 companies that are all doing the same thing
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_00: what has historically happened is that it's a bad market if there are 20 companies doing it but then
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_00: I don't know the bottom 15 just go bankrupt and then maybe there's some consolidation where number
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_00: one buys number two number two buys number three and assuming that we have a functional FTC and
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_00: what not it's like all of this is approved because it's not like you're taking this is like orthodontic
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_00: clinic answering software or something so and then what was a bad market becomes a good market
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_00: and this kind of goes back to like why momentum is important because if you have 20 companies that are
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_00: all at the exact same scale then it's actually great for the customer which is like the the prices go
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_00: to zero where they converge on the price of electricity whereas if you this is not saying you want
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_00: to go build a monopoly in orthodontic answering software or something but rather you can charge more
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_00: if you get to a certain scale because whatever the quality of the product that you're delivering in
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_00: the end of the day is just higher and you have to get to the critical scale to get there and
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_00: sometimes you just need these markets to to work themselves out I mean like when I was running my
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_00: company trial pay we had 20 competitors and it was tough because it's like you know everybody would
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_00: be pricing their product at a loss you know this this loss leader only works if you end up leading
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_00: with like you have to make money at the end and nobody really had a plan for that because the venture
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_00: capital dollars were really subsidizing everything and that does not get a good market what does become
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_00: a good market at the end and sometimes this is what you know Vista the private equity firm would do
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_00: is like we're going to buy one is our anchor we're going to go low ball and put the other five out
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_00: of their misery and now we end up with like actually a pretty good product at the end or pretty
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_00: good business at the end pretty good company at the end so I think that will probably play out
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_00: the same way here because you just can't have a market where you have everybody lost leading
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_00: and nobody's big enough to get any kind of scale effects is there going to be a world where the
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_00: the 19th player survives I mean Jack Welch would always say you have to be number one or number two
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_00: and there's no value to being number three through a hundred I don't think that's changed right
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_02: even in the model provider example and I'm most curious of prices go down yeah I don't I don't see
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_00: how like they're actually I mean people know X AI andthropic open AI Gemini like they they know or
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_00: Quinn they know the big ones but there are actually there's a long tail of things that people
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_00: haven't heard of where it's like they've raised lots of money it's just like not it's it works fine
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_00: but how can you like the model company is the most cutthroat because like unless you're
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_00: state if you're state of the art minus minus minus and you're trying to earn a living it's just like
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_00: that that's just not going to work so that game is super cutthroat I think I think the one area where
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_01: that may have diverge and martin talks about this a lot is like you know when markets are growing so
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_01: quickly you you end up having specialization and so I think in other kind of modalities you know
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_01: in some of the creative tools or you know people have specialized to like serve you know the up-market
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_01: you know like I'm I'm producing you know movies okay I want to create sort of like social
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_01: you know quality content like these are different you know markets that that the models can kind
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_01: of specialize in time will tell you know how sort of you know defensible those become over time but
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_01: maybe that's the optimistic take that like you know early on everything looks you know
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_01: overlapping and competitive but we're still so you know the market is growing that everything can
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_01: kind of expand and people can kind of specialize over time earlier when you we're talking about
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_01: the future of our product it didn't Steve jobs once tell drew housed in that drop box was was
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_02: just a feature yeah that that's why it's always been this pejorative thing but that's that's
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_00: kind of the point that I was getting to is that nobody wants to like oh I need this company no it's
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_00: like I need this feature every now and then you see a product that is not a feature because it's
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_00: just like so far out of left field like nobody was anticipating chat GPT dominating their daily
[00:39:38] SPEAKER_00: workflow in 2022 in October but then once it came out it was this like holy crap I this is
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_00: incredible and that's not a feature you could argue it's a feature on top of your iPhone but no
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_00: the iPhone is the delivery mechanism that's a that's a product and they've obviously turned that into
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_00: a company whereas other things it kind of is like you know why is their antivirus software that
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_00: almost doesn't make any sense like shouldn't the operating system stop you from getting viruses like
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_00: why do you need a third party tool to do synchronization between devices but it turns out like the
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_00: reason why Dropbox has survived and thrived since Steve Jobs made that comment is like it's really
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_00: hard to do well and there's a lot of other things like once you've built that feature you can backfill
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_00: with all sorts of other product which is what Dropbox is done a pretty good job of but it is hard
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_00: because this is the the danger of building on somebody else's platform is that you know I'm going
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_00: to build this thing that they should have had right if they had the foresight and if it doesn't
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_00: operate in the Goldilocks zone right it's like wow this is so this will like triple Apple
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_00: profits let's just say that Dropbox would have tripled Apple's profits would they have dropped every
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_00: what would they have focused on building that versus the iPad or something whatever like Steve's
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_00: last Gizmo was like sure but if it's kind of in this like Goldilocks zone of irrelevant like
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_00: genitorial services it's like yeah they should do that but you know platform owners get lazy
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_00: this is why like you know half the things on my iPhone don't really work if they're built by Apple
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_00: try you like any any parent that's listening to this if they've tried screen time it's just like an
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_00: embarrassment upon humanity and because they don't have to go sell as a it's like they don't have to
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_00: compete on feature they compete on the fact they don't even compete they just like they're the
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_00: platform they roll it out it's going to be bad and that does create an opportunity for somebody
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_00: to come up with a feature and actually out compete the the platform but like you have to be
[00:41:35] SPEAKER_00: careful because it's like obviously the platform owner is going to go compete with you that's why
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_00: often when I find very compelling about entrepreneurs when they know this like they've studied
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_00: how is it that from every single platform shift from like you know we were talking about AC versus DC
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_00: current like there have always been these battles for like who's going to be the underlying you know
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_00: layer um the best entrepreneurs have studied this and they have a plan they're like I know I have
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_00: a feature like drew new this is like I know that like there's this stupid comment on hackers it's like
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_00: oh this is just like our sync with this that and the other thing it's like yeah of course
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_00: drew those that but he built this into a $10 billion company because like he had a plan
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_00: and the best entrepreneur is they often like okay I know it's not this naive a tale it's like oh I'm
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_00: going to build this there's no way that they're going to build it because they're too dumb and stupid
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_00: it's like no they're not like these companies if they get their act together they will
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_00: marshal a lot of resources to go compete with you it might take them five years but they will
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_00: 100% do it you have to backfill your feature with a product and you have to have a
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_00: moat for that product as opposed to like oh yeah like the big company will never figure this out it's
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_00: like that's not true I think what's also unique I wrote this piece a while ago called the messian
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_01: box problem and it was sort of a wedge strategy that we've been observing across lots of different
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_01: industries and it's just this idea that you hook into a bunch of your different unstructured
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_01: data sources could be email could be fax could be phone you know tenor as an example has trained
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_01: a model to be able to extract all the relevant patient information from those data sources to plug
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_01: it downstream into some system record in their case in EHR but this exists in a CRM and ERP
[00:43:09] what have you and I think that that wedge for that feature is interesting in large part because it
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_01: lives up funnel from software right you're replacing the human level judgment of the individual like
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_01: often that admit you know the secretary sort of like collecting the physical facts and then
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_01: plugging it into the HR and so now a bunch of AI companies can kind of you know wedge in and then
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_01: eat away at all the downstream workflows that might have been their point solution software
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_01: companies and so you know tenor is no longer just doing you know the messian box they're now doing
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: scheduling and prior you know prior off and eligibility and benefits and they've used that wedge to
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_01: try to become you know kind of the end end platform eventually maybe they become the system of record
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_01: but again because you can kind of replace the human labor now with software I think it's
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_01: creating opportunities for these you know features to actually become products and you know in
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_01: their case I think become you know whole companies well I think I think this is the thing that in
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_00: my mind is very dramatically different than every other platform shift is that the it is just so
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_00: consensus like cloud was not consensus mobile was not consensus and that's why the incumbents kind
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_00: of screwed up where it's like and then sometimes it was just like completely I'll use the the
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_00: Silicon Valley term orthogonal to their to their business model because it's like I sell five
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_00: million dollar a year products and wait a minute I'm going to charge a hundred thousand dollars a
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_00: month like that's just hard like how do I pay my sales people how do I make my quarterly numbers
[00:44:35] SPEAKER_00: so that's why like you know work day beat people soft or that's why you know sales for us beat
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_00: seabull so all of these things played out but behind it was this concept of it's like that new thing
[00:44:48] SPEAKER_00: that iPhone is stupid like there's no version of the the famous Steve bomber clip of like him saying
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_00: this nobody's going to buy an eight hundred dollar phone with no keyboard there's no version of that
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_00: for AI it's like how do you find a big CEO or even a small CEO is like nobody will use that tool
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_00: that makes you a hundred times more productive it's of course and this is why it's it's kind of a
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_00: bananza for most of the incumbents as well because anybody who has a system of record will add a
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_00: button or a feature to use our parlance that will make them more money so like they're just kind
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_00: of gold bricks everywhere and the challenge though is that there isn't this this kind of white space
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_00: to occupy in the same way that there was for cloud or for mobile or for a lot of the web 2.0 things
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_00: where it's like you just like the incumbent screwed up they weren't paying attention they scoff at
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_00: this new technology like nobody's scoffing at this new technology like everybody's just trying to
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_00: embrace it but you know the opportunity often exists where a lot of the areas that just seem too
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_00: small they don't have an incumbent at all like those actually might turn out to be like you know
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_00: trillions of dollars of value and that's kind of what makes it much more exciting than like
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_00: last gen where it's like oh I'm just going to copy everything that was on prem and make it
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_00: you know recurring billing cloud and I'm going to do that at a time when like the big guys say
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_00: that's stupid and I don't get it. So some argue that you know mobile was was ultimately sustaining
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_02: in that although there were you know net new companies in use cases that were you know 100 billion
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_02: dollars like Uber and Airbnb etc that you know the incumbents you know some of them became
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_02: trillion dollar companies you know I've got it by mobile when we look at the you know business
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_02: impact of the AI era what's your mental model for thinking about sort of the incumbent to start up
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_02: or kind of net new company in terms of value you know value capture. I think a lot of it is the same
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_00: like unless you really screw up the the pricing model or like you know you're all per seat pricing
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_00: it's very very hard to just get the market to adopt something that is just violently different
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_00: and you're operating in the public eye and your technology team is bad there are a lot of
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_00: ads that need to happen I have a hard time believing that incumbents will really suffer.
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_00: I mean there probably are some things like you know take like one example of and this kind of
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_00: goes back to distribution versus technology like all of these business process outsourcing companies
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_00: these BPO's they're the largest employers on the planet so like Tata, Whipro, Infosys. So if I'm
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_00: JP Morgan and I say I need a call center and this call center needs to have access to like
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_00: customer records and it needs to be safe and everybody needs to be trained like and I need to have
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_00: like a hundred thousand people that can answer the phone you know who can do that for you Infosys
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_00: right or Tata. Tata has already done the integration with JP Morgan in this case they might just add
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_00: AI and now they don't need a hundred thousand people and they maintain that JP Morgan contract and
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_00: they operate in the the area of the Goldilocks zone where it's like they're gonna make like a hundred
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_00: times more money that that's one case that's the bull case for Tata. The bear case is like JP Morgan's
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_00: like wait a minute like we should partner with the startup to do this or we should do this ourselves
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_00: and now like Tata loses that relationship altogether and it could go either direction like
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_00: and I think a lot of these things are really up for grabs but I think the default is that the
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_00: incumbents probably will do well but you can pick a lot of these cases I mean this is why you see
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_00: the public market kind of don't know what to do where there is a case that is very very bad for a
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_00: lot of software companies but there is an alternative case which is like if you operate in the right
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_00: Goldilocks zone and you're you know you have the right momentum to actually build these things
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_00: and embrace these new technologies like you'll maintain all of your customer relationships
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_00: and you're just going to have a more profitable business and it's not that you're going to do this
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_00: like the the most compelling thing I think about AI that almost everybody gets wrong is like oh
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_00: it's going to destroy all the jobs like our beloved representative from Silicon Valley is like
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_00: trying to like eliminate AI that's just so crazy that our elected representative wants to turn
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_00: us back to farmers of of tangerines and whatnot in Silicon Valley but which which again I think is
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_00: crazy but it's not like all the jobs will go away I actually think that's not going to happen
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_00: at all what's going to happen is there are a lot of things where it's like if I could hire somebody
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_00: for a dollar to do this task I would 100% do that I cannot hire somebody for a dollar I've never
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_00: been able to hire somebody for a dollar now I can hire software for a dollar so a lot of these tasks
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_00: like you know look at how many people took taxis post uber right and it's like did you hear people say
[00:49:24] SPEAKER_00: I've like you probably took a new bird to get here today right would you have taken a taxi 20 years
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_00: ago like no way right because it's like where would you find the taxi how would you arrange the
[00:49:32] SPEAKER_00: taxi just like way too complicated whereas once you make it very very abundant and less expensive
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_00: like everybody's going to use this and I think that's the that's what wrote kind of and in his
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_00: ill car missing which is it's not like oh I'm going to go and say I'm going to like eliminate
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_00: all the jobs like think of it in that jp Morgan example that I just mentioned it's like wouldn't
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_00: it be cool if every single customer of jp Morgan chase could have their own personal friend that
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_00: they could talk to every single day there they would help them with every single element of their
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_00: financial life for it's like I'm stuck downloading the app I can't figure out how to get it set up
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: oh talk to somebody in real time that will help you about that why don't they do that it's just like
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_00: the cost is known tie and then the value is probably low and as soon as you can bring the cost down
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_00: to zero now you're going to start hiring AI in all of these different areas that you just would never
[00:50:21] SPEAKER_00: bother hiring a human for because it's just like you can't train the human you can't find the human
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_00: in the human's due expensive I think it's a good place to wrap guys thanks for coming to the podcast
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_02: it most still matter yeah
