[00:00:00] We don't want to become same as previous generation of the editing suites.
[00:00:05] Piotr Kozlowski: So instead, let's solve it on the research level where it will now based on the voice,
[00:00:08] Piotr Kozlowski: exactly how it should speak with the speed.
[00:00:10] Piotr Kozlowski: To be able to cut it to all those different use cases, you need such a big array of different voices,
[00:00:14] Piotr Kozlowski: different languages, different accents, different styles.
[00:00:18] Piotr Kozlowski: So you launch the voice marketplace where you go to create your voice and then share it.
[00:00:24] Piotr Kozlowski: And when the voice base shared, you earn money in the return.
[00:00:27] Piotr Kozlowski: There we have almost 10,000 voices. We paid $10 million back to the people in the community.
[00:00:32] Piotr Kozlowski: There are some crazy stories from the voices just speaking through exactly the technology,
[00:00:37] Piotr Kozlowski: showing the examples and kind of avoiding this initial knee jerk reaction that AI is bad has been driven.
[00:00:47] I'm excited to welcome our first speaker, Maddie Kofanar and CEO of In-N-H-H-Haz.
[00:00:58] Alright, so good to have you here, Maddie.
[00:01:06] Maddie Kofanar: Thanks so much for having me here. Great to see everyone and good morning.
[00:01:10] Piotr Kozlowski: And that...
[00:01:11] Piotr Kozlowski: That was the walk-on music generated by 11 labs, was it?
[00:01:17] Maddie Kofanar: It was. We expand continuously across the audio space.
[00:01:21] Piotr Kozlowski: We started with voices, then created orchestration of how to build voice agents.
[00:01:26] Piotr Kozlowski: And now also created a fully licensed music model.
[00:01:29] Piotr Kozlowski: So can produce amazing music to go alongside with it.
[00:01:32] Piotr Kozlowski: Awesome. We'll talk about all about that.
[00:01:35] I had the opportunity and also the luck to get to know from the very early days when 11 labs got started
[00:01:42] Maddie Kofanar: and get to partner of the last three years to just see your execution everywhere from product launches to shipping.
[00:01:50] Maddie Kofanar: New lines and models, like you just mentioned, everything from text to speech models,
[00:01:55] Maddie Kofanar: speech to text, and then we started doing music, sound effects, and now the AI agent platform.
[00:02:02] Maddie Kofanar: I'm very curious first, I'm still in all of the shipping speed after all this three years.
[00:02:09] Maddie Kofanar: But I want to ask how do you actually maintain both the speed and quality when you have such expensive product roadmap?
[00:02:18] So first of all, we partnered almost three years ago.
[00:02:21] Piotr Kozlowski: And so it's great to hear all the kind notes.
[00:02:26] Piotr Kozlowski: But also, they didn't realize when we partnered, the infrastructure team was free people.
[00:02:30] Piotr Kozlowski: And of course, now I'm 11 labs founder. We love number 11.
[00:02:33] Piotr Kozlowski: And the company, Infra team is 11 people.
[00:02:36] Piotr Kozlowski: So we've seen the growth of the other side as well.
[00:02:39] Piotr Kozlowski: And I hear that the companies here raised $66 billion in the total fundraising.
[00:02:45] Piotr Kozlowski: So the number 11 is everywhere here.
[00:02:48] But the, I think the start off, I think first piece, I have a, I think the smartest person I got to know as my co-founder,
[00:02:56] Piotr Kozlowski: who has been the research brain for creating a lot of the models and then being able to assemble what we think are the most incredible researchers in the voice space,
[00:03:04] Piotr Kozlowski: to really create the first text to speech model that could understand the context in a better way and turn that into the emotion,
[00:03:11] Piotr Kozlowski: and into the nation, then find a way to capture the characteristics of the voice.
[00:03:16] Piotr Kozlowski: So you have the voice sound with the right style, with the right age, with the right gender dialect, everything in one.
[00:03:25] And then the researchers across, of course, now expanded that to speech detects music and other work.
[00:03:30] Piotr Kozlowski: So that's our foundation. And then the way we structure it to be able to ship quickly, especially with so many things happening in the space,
[00:03:36] Piotr Kozlowski: is a lot of small teams. So today we have roughly 20 product teams, each of five to ten people's size,
[00:03:42] Piotr Kozlowski: which we full independence can go ahead and ship products.
[00:03:47] Piotr Kozlowski: Of course, that carries some of the, sometimes issues of the blanket of work, or sometimes people going at different speeds,
[00:03:57] Piotr Kozlowski: but at the positive end, the ownership of each of the teams is extremely high.
[00:04:02] Piotr Kozlowski: So people know that this is down to them to really deliver and ship. And it allows us to move extremely quickly.
[00:04:08] Piotr Kozlowski: And we back at our work into creative space, so creative platform where we have with narrations, voice overs, dabs for creatives and creatives in the immediate entertainment space.
[00:04:19] Piotr Kozlowski: And then on the agents side where we help people recreate voice agent experience, conversational agent experience, across customer experience, all the way through to immersive media.
[00:04:31] Maddie Kofanar: 11 Labs has a lab's name in the labs in the name. There are similar to many of the other big labs, which means you're doing your first party R&D and model development,
[00:04:40] Maddie Kofanar: but also building all these 20 products. How do you think about balancing both, like keep progressing on the model research,
[00:04:48] Maddie Kofanar: but at the same time not delaying sort of the product launches?
[00:04:51] It's very tricky. I'm sure many of you have the same thing. Like, do you build the product while when you don't know,
[00:04:59] Piotr Kozlowski: if the research innovation will displace the product you just built? We had this in the early days too.
[00:05:04] Piotr Kozlowski: So one of the simple examples was we had a model at work and one of the most common requests was, could we do a different speed for voices?
[00:05:13] Piotr Kozlowski: So could you have additional slider to modify the speed of how audio gets generated and how quickly it speaks?
[00:05:19] Piotr Kozlowski: And we are very against this idea of like, no, we don't want to do any sliders, any toggles.
[00:05:24] Piotr Kozlowski: We don't want to become same as previous generation of the editing suite.
[00:05:29] Piotr Kozlowski: So instead, let's solve it on the research level where it will know based on the voice exactly how it should speak with the speed.
[00:05:34] Piotr Kozlowski: And we resisted this for, I think, good amount of nine months, and we couldn't solve it on the research side.
[00:05:40] Piotr Kozlowski: And then the product was super simple solve that got all the users across.
[00:05:45] Piotr Kozlowski: And now the approach we take and looking at this is, if we think the research work will take more than three months,
[00:05:51] Piotr Kozlowski: the product is, can do anything they want to start adding other models, adding some of the extensions.
[00:06:00] Piotr Kozlowski: Of course, sometimes the timeline is tricky to predict, but roughly the guidance we have from our internal research team,
[00:06:05] Piotr Kozlowski: what are the initiatives we hope to ship this quarter, what are long term initiatives, and then for anything long term,
[00:06:11] Piotr Kozlowski: you can use any other work to close that gap and make it better.
[00:06:18] I guess first, you kind of have to figure out if the research commitment is going to meet the timeline first,
[00:06:25] Maddie Kofanar: and then go on to align with the product teams, that make a lot of sense.
[00:06:32] Maddie Kofanar: As everyone is moving to San Francisco and building in person in locked in, like in the same space,
[00:06:39] Maddie Kofanar: 11 has always been building globally and having people more distributed.
[00:06:44] Maddie Kofanar: But you not have centers, I guess, in different locations from London, Warsaw, San Francisco, to New York, and other places.
[00:06:52] Maddie Kofanar: How do you think about building this global expansion and finding talent globally versus, I guess, the trade-offs of building in the same place?
[00:07:04] Piotr Kozlowski: We started, so me and my co-founder are Polish, we started between Warsaw and London at the time, and I think 11 labs wouldn't have existed if we were in starting from Europe.
[00:07:14] Piotr Kozlowski: It's a very peculiar thing, but in Poland, if you watch a movie in Polish language, like a foreign movie in Polish language,
[00:07:20] Piotr Kozlowski: all devices, whether that's a male voice or female voice, get narrated with one single character.
[00:07:26] Piotr Kozlowski: No emotions, no intonation, as you can imagine, it's pretty terrible, and it's still happening today for most of the content out there.
[00:07:34] Piotr Kozlowski: I've had a similar experience growing up in China that we have a lot of western movies stopped in Chinese, monotone.
[00:07:41] Piotr Kozlowski: So bad, so bad. In Poland, of course, post-communist country, it's a cheaper way to do it.
[00:07:46] Piotr Kozlowski: You don't have to hire as many people, you have one monoton audio book reading of a movie, and that was kind of where the company started,
[00:07:55] Piotr Kozlowski: initially, in Europe, and we realized that if we wanted the best people to solve what was a research problem at the time, we need to hire wherever they are.
[00:08:06] Piotr Kozlowski: And we couldn't lock ourselves to just San Francisco or look at the west coast.
[00:08:13] Piotr Kozlowski: We knew that we need to find them across Europe, across Asia, and bring them into the company, so we started fully remote and started looking at those people.
[00:08:22] Piotr Kozlowski: And then on engineering, we also were very against this traditional hiring method of looking at LinkedIn, looking at traditional background, and trying to figure out could we go and figure out a different method to hire people.
[00:08:36] Piotr Kozlowski: That led to some very interesting hire, so we hired a person that had an incredible open source, text to speech model, and was working at the call center at the same time as a recipient of the calls to make mine.
[00:08:49] Piotr Kozlowski: And he's now the team, one of the most brilliant researchers we have doing all the data processing, but the same pattern kind of followed, and of course the early team was very distributed.
[00:09:00] Piotr Kozlowski: And then as we started scaling, so beyond 30 people, we realized that the new people joining, there's benefit of them having a space to be next to others, to get deeper into the culture, understand how, what are all the products that are happening in the company.
[00:09:17] Piotr Kozlowski: And then we started the hops where you can go into London and Warsaw and San Francisco, where you can work with others in person.
[00:09:23] Piotr Kozlowski: And that's how we try to like marry those two. If you are early in your career, you can, we try to hire you in the hops so you can immerse yourself in the company.
[00:09:31] Piotr Kozlowski: If you are used to remote work completely fine, but then if you want, you can always come and join us in the hub.
[00:09:37] Piotr Kozlowski: That worked really well. Currently we continue hiring very traditional backgrounds in some of the place of the company, and then fusing that to very traditional backgrounds, which can teach the others.
[00:09:48] Piotr Kozlowski: And in sales, for example, we've done some of those experiments too, where that combination worked really well.
[00:09:55] Maddie Kofanar: The lesson is you can really find talent everywhere. It's just how hard and how you look for them.
[00:10:02] Piotr Kozlowski: In Europe, people like, this was an interesting one. In the US, people are very keen and excited to work.
[00:10:09] Piotr Kozlowski: And if you go for an social event, you want to talk about work. And in Europe, I didn't have this feeling where most people don't want to do that.
[00:10:17] Piotr Kozlowski: It's like the cultural piece is different. But then you do have the pockets of people that actually strive too. They just don't have the companies where they could do that.
[00:10:24] Piotr Kozlowski: So I feel like our team from Europe is the most motivated and passionate set of people that we are lucky to have.
[00:10:34] Maddie Kofanar: I can attest to that given that some of them are a hardcore, very good work ethic for sure.
[00:10:40] Maddie Kofanar: And you have also maintained a pretty flat work structure, and have people on quite literally a lot of responsibilities.
[00:10:49] Maddie Kofanar: Can you talk about the rationale behind that? And I guess there was also no title policy?
[00:10:53] Maddie Kofanar: Yes, so we removed titles a year ago. And then, and it's going well, it still works.
[00:11:00] Piotr Kozlowski: And I do think we, you know, we said we did it. But I thought a lot of AI companies kind of do it too already with a member of technical staff being like the usual piece you have for engineering.
[00:11:10] Piotr Kozlowski: And then in a lot of the go to market, you are just go to market, not the p of sales or other roles.
[00:11:15] Piotr Kozlowski: I think it's actually a pretty common pattern. But in our case, we had a small team approach where you have extremely small amount of people usually the five to 10.
[00:11:25] Piotr Kozlowski: And we wanted to make it very clear that every team, we create those teams. You have six months to prove it.
[00:11:33] Piotr Kozlowski: If it's proven that team will stay and continue working, but it really is that the moment you join, you can have any impact on the company.
[00:11:40] Piotr Kozlowski: So you can have any role in that team. The 10 year will not define your position in the hierarchy.
[00:11:45] Piotr Kozlowski: If you are smart and quick and passionate, you can elevate yourself very quickly, which this really helped.
[00:11:52] Piotr Kozlowski: And also, it's a common layer to the external world where everybody looking at 11 labs knows that we are, the go to market team, misgo to market team.
[00:12:01] Piotr Kozlowski: There's no positioning to the same extent. What this allows us to do is I think when we speak with a lot of our partners, with a lot of car customers,
[00:12:09] Piotr Kozlowski: they also know that they are getting the best people and always. And we can also send people to different conferences, different events, regardless of that positioning.
[00:12:21] Piotr Kozlowski: I think the tricky thing in the flat structure is not only positives. In the way we currently have it's a set of leads effectively for the subdivisions.
[00:12:31] Piotr Kozlowski: So the research, creative work, agents work, go to markets, self-serve and sales sled. And of course, ups.
[00:12:38] Piotr Kozlowski: Only that's the layer of leads. And then under that, there's pretty flat small team approach across the world.
[00:12:46] Piotr Kozlowski: But then you really want the leads to be able to carry the complexity around the team.
[00:12:51] Piotr Kozlowski: So suggest things between one team to another if they see that there's something valuable between them happening.
[00:12:56] Piotr Kozlowski: So if I'm picking those people that can context switch between is super important and then lettering the team fully focused on that.
[00:13:04] Piotr Kozlowski: And then having, which is, which was interesting learning, where if you put a person into all the slack channels and give them transparency, they actually get frequently distracted because then they read all the messages.
[00:13:16] Piotr Kozlowski: And then you can still choose not to read them, but they still do. So you kind of need to cut the access to a lot of those pieces to force the attention.
[00:13:25] Piotr Kozlowski: And that kind of works. All those small things works work really well.
[00:13:28] Maddie Kofanar: Maybe we can borrow some of that lesson too.
[00:13:32] Maddie Kofanar: Let's try to gear a little bit. You're on the front line seeing a lot of the creative work, whether it's from art, music, or advertising that are starting to adopt AI tools.
[00:13:43] Maddie Kofanar: And in the beginning, that was not the case. There was a lot of resistance. And now we're just seeing the adaptation and the welcoming of using more of the generative AI tools, including, you know, AI audio.
[00:13:55] And you have done some really smart things from the marketplace payouts to like working with these creative industries since day one, actually.
[00:14:03] Maddie Kofanar: I remember how much you stressed like we have to find a way to work with them and sort of observing sort of market shift over time.
[00:14:11] Maddie Kofanar: So the question is, how do you actually adapt to these changes and find the ways to work with the industry in the infancy in the beginning? And how do you navigate some of the challenges in that?
[00:14:26] Piotr Kozlowski: So I think the first piece is actually spending time with the industry and trying to understand what are the priorities there incentives.
[00:14:36] Piotr Kozlowski: Of course, it's sometimes tricky. Sometimes you end up being star-struck. We had an honor and pleasure to work with Jarrett on some of his incredible work.
[00:14:45] Piotr Kozlowski: And learn from him on like what is important and like which parts of the production process you can actually use AI.
[00:14:52] Piotr Kozlowski: And so you want to keep, where is it actually helpful? And so I think that's the super important thesis across all the partnerships in the space.
[00:15:02] Piotr Kozlowski: In our case, we try to figure out how to do that on the on the voice space, which is of course, with that technology, A, how will the voice acting space look like in the future?
[00:15:13] Piotr Kozlowski: And then, too, of course, to be able to cut through to all those different use cases, you need such a big array of different voices, different languages, different accents, different styles.
[00:15:23] Piotr Kozlowski: So you launch the voice marketplace where you could create your voice and then share it. And when the voice base is shared, you earn money in the return.
[00:15:33] Piotr Kozlowski: And here we have almost 10,000 voices. We paid $10 million back to the people in the community. There are some crazy stories from the voices. One of our first voices will say a deep Spanish voice.
[00:15:45] Piotr Kozlowski: And the magic of the technology is that the same voice now is available on all different languages in the same way. So it's 30 different languages at the time, 70.
[00:15:53] Piotr Kozlowski: But 30 languages at the time. And we had the Spanish voice join us. And it wasn't picking up on the Spain, nobody really liked it as much.
[00:16:00] Piotr Kozlowski: And we picked up in an English speaking country, that same voice. We really love that deepness. And now it's our top free voice for all the use cases.
[00:16:08] Piotr Kozlowski: So hidden messages, you can all register to our voice marketplace and maybe earn some money too.
[00:16:15] So that's the second important thing. It's like figuring out how we can be part, how we can bring the industry together to disrupt together rather than just disrupt.
[00:16:24] Piotr Kozlowski: And with labels, I think I'm still learning how to interact. So we worked with labels that Merlin and Cobalt are four of majors to bring their music into the music models.
[00:16:36] Piotr Kozlowski: We can do it in a licensed way so you can generate that and give commercial rights so you're fully protected.
[00:16:42] Piotr Kozlowski: And that was a hard process. It took us 18 months to figure out the agreement that works. And in the end, I think the main thing was adding sort of forcing functions or forcing timings to find effectively a trigger of like, okay, this is when we do it.
[00:17:01] Piotr Kozlowski: And we either do it together or we do it separately. And those forcing functions really help out the urgency. Then we need to move that forcing function few times, but it still worked to a large extent to go after that.
[00:17:15] Piotr Kozlowski: So, you know, finding the compromise wasn't easy. But then in our case, working with the labels there was kind of protecting what they are caring about.
[00:17:30] Piotr Kozlowski: And they of course also care about how they continue doing well by their members, by their artists that they work with.
[00:17:38] Piotr Kozlowski: And we have a lot of time working with their members, speaking about how we think about technology, what's going to happen in the next couple of years. And that really helped.
[00:17:46] Piotr Kozlowski: So just speaking through exactly the technology, showing the examples and kind of avoiding this initial knee jerk reaction that AI is bad has been growing.
[00:17:56] And maybe time back to the earlier question as you are navigating like this landscape.
[00:18:01] Maddie Kofanar: How do you think about like bringing the right talent that can.
[00:18:06] Had and lead some of these functions and these are mostly unknown territories of how to navigate it like where have you been seeing success in bringing the right people.
[00:18:16] Maddie Kofanar: So here for the spaces that are kind of completely new to us. So this and like legalism, another example, we would always kind of bring at least one or two people that were in that space that kind of have interacted with the same parties full time in the past.
[00:18:31] Piotr Kozlowski: But then would actually adjust that with a lot of consulting people that would help us in a specific conversations.
[00:18:41] Piotr Kozlowski: So in this case in music, we had music lawyers that worked very closely with us that consult across few of them.
[00:18:48] Piotr Kozlowski: And the good thing is that they know all the players and they effectively were this bridging up between between both of us.
[00:18:56] Piotr Kozlowski: So we could speak the same language. And and then that was that was that was we have all.
[00:19:01] Maddie Kofanar: Yeah, and you have had a very specific taste for people that are risk tolerant enough and also understand the commercial business opportunities to you know help guide the right.
[00:19:19] Chain of actions in each of those domains have found that very fascinating.
[00:19:23] Piotr Kozlowski: I mean legal I'm I don't know how many of you are trying to find a first legal council or have a number of those for us.
[00:19:30] Piotr Kozlowski: This was the I think one of the trickest roles to hire for because you are hiring into the space you don't know you know very little about.
[00:19:40] Piotr Kozlowski: And then and then we had a like the first couple of legal people that that were clearly not fed so we separated us.
[00:19:49] Piotr Kozlowski: And then we had a third person and that person came from like a number of Fortune 500 companies.
[00:19:55] Piotr Kozlowski: And they never worked in startup space never worked in venture. And what resulted is like everything every conversation was pointing out the risks that we see.
[00:20:03] Piotr Kozlowski: So like anything we wanted to do was like the number of risks that this could carry.
[00:20:08] Piotr Kozlowski: And it was really tricky to work because we it's like you kind of get risks but you've got the risk advice of like okay and this is where we should draw the line.
[00:20:16] Piotr Kozlowski: Everything was back to decision and now we hired a person working previously in the number of companies as a council and don't poach them.
[00:20:25] Piotr Kozlowski: And they understand the risk equation a lot better where they are not only like a counterpart to figuring out what the risks are but also like okay this is what other companies do this is what we should
[00:20:40] Piotr Kozlowski: do and then there are like a true fault partner and the tremendous change.
[00:20:45] For sure. You know what laps started as more of a crater brand everywhere from the individual creators to the creators that are building businesses.
[00:20:56] Maddie Kofanar: But now you have been having a lot of success moving into enterprise not just started from the AIA agent platform but you know even with the the text with speech speech and text models.
[00:21:07] Maddie Kofanar: How have you been navigating that transition because that's one of the very common place where you know a lot of really great consumer creator brands fall down but you have had so far.
[00:21:19] Maddie Kofanar: A pretty smooth transition.
[00:21:21] Piotr Kozlowski: So when we when we launched we had a lot of early inbound when when we started the kind of the classic PLG a lot of inbound from enterprise and I remember speaking with a 60 z team when they joined us where our initial take was of course we want to be engineering company.
[00:21:36] Piotr Kozlowski: We don't want sales people we would like to reinvent that and have like engineers do the sales.
[00:21:42] Piotr Kozlowski: We we did hire one traditional sales person and one non traditional sales person like an engineer we told him like do sales now and that really as you can imagine didn't work out in this specific case.
[00:21:53] Piotr Kozlowski: But we learned our lesson and we now do invest in in a combination of that it's 80% sales 20% engineering so still a little bit of that.
[00:22:03] Piotr Kozlowski: That is was like super important level of understanding who are the customers what they care about and working deeply with them to to bring it back.
[00:22:13] Piotr Kozlowski: And then that kind of working with them was kind of opening of what we need to actually do on the product and research side.
[00:22:20] Piotr Kozlowski: And then the people who are in the public are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who
[00:22:50] Piotr Kozlowski: are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are

[00:23:50] Piotr Kozlowski: And a big part.
[00:23:52] Piotr Kozlowski: And underlying all of that, and we spoke a little bit with Matt
[00:23:55] Piotr Kozlowski: before coming here, the foundation needs to be there,
[00:23:58] Piotr Kozlowski: which is the security, the compliance, serving the customers
[00:24:03] Piotr Kozlowski: across that will rely on that infrastructure.
[00:24:05] Piotr Kozlowski: That's something that we want to shine through at 11 laps,
[00:24:07] Piotr Kozlowski: where if you are using the software,
[00:24:09] Piotr Kozlowski: it's going to always be reliable and always.
[00:24:12] Piotr Kozlowski: The 4.9s or 5.9s, hopefully, one day
[00:24:15] Piotr Kozlowski: will be there, which is tricky in AI space.
[00:24:18] Piotr Kozlowski: That's the goal, of course, the difference between,
[00:24:23] Piotr Kozlowski: one of these difference between PLG and sales
[00:24:25] Piotr Kozlowski: is the cycle to work through and identify
[00:24:29] Piotr Kozlowski: the right customers is much longer.
[00:24:30] Piotr Kozlowski: And I think that's where EGerness from our internal team
[00:24:36] Piotr Kozlowski: was interesting to observe, where you had a lot of people
[00:24:40] Piotr Kozlowski: that didn't work in an enterprise setting.
[00:24:42] Piotr Kozlowski: And then you had other side of the company that did.
[00:24:45] Piotr Kozlowski: And the side that did it was very skeptic about going enterprise
[00:24:49] Piotr Kozlowski: and waiting the six months or 12 months to results.
[00:24:52] Piotr Kozlowski: And in the early days, we needed to shield them
[00:24:54] Piotr Kozlowski: from that information.
[00:24:55] Piotr Kozlowski: And trust us will do this, and it will work.
[00:24:58] Piotr Kozlowski: But they were very skeptic.
[00:24:59] Piotr Kozlowski: And then, of course, after 12 months, it worked out.
[00:25:02] Piotr Kozlowski: But that was probably the hardest culturally of how you still
[00:25:06] Piotr Kozlowski: keep everyone jumping on the same train.
[00:25:11] That's exactly right.
[00:25:12] Maddie Kofanar: A lot of companies actually, at least I observed sort of slow down
[00:25:17] Maddie Kofanar: after starting adopting more of the enterprise, sort of product
[00:25:21] Maddie Kofanar: launching and building for the customers request that started
[00:25:26] Maddie Kofanar: to thank you so much to delay the product launches.
[00:25:31] Maddie Kofanar: Is that something you're seeing?
[00:25:32] Maddie Kofanar: Or is there still a good balance of, we
[00:25:34] Maddie Kofanar: still want to be able to put out demos and POCs and early teasers
[00:25:39] Maddie Kofanar: quickly, but at the same time, we'll get
[00:25:41] Maddie Kofanar: to deliver a real buzz and reliable product.
[00:25:45] So there are two parts.
[00:25:46] Piotr Kozlowski: The first part is, so we have a difference on the team
[00:25:49] Piotr Kozlowski: structure, and then we have a difference
[00:25:50] Piotr Kozlowski: on the external product structure.
[00:25:53] On the external product structure, we want to ship very quickly.
[00:25:58] Piotr Kozlowski: But of course, if you're shipping to enterprise,
[00:25:59] Piotr Kozlowski: you want to make sure that it's stable and reliable.
[00:26:02] Piotr Kozlowski: So we delineate very clearly what's alpha, what's not alpha.
[00:26:06] Piotr Kozlowski: And then we go through that transition through that period.
[00:26:09] Piotr Kozlowski: And then as we work with the customers,
[00:26:11] Piotr Kozlowski: and then our partners, they can decide
[00:26:13] Piotr Kozlowski: whether they want the access to alpha in the first place.
[00:26:15] Piotr Kozlowski: And when they do, that's clearly shown that this is an alpha
[00:26:18] Piotr Kozlowski: product that might not be stable.
[00:26:20] Piotr Kozlowski: And so they get a choice.
[00:26:21] Piotr Kozlowski: And I think that choice has been the most important level,
[00:26:24] Piotr Kozlowski: like do you want it or not.
[00:26:27] Piotr Kozlowski: And some are incredible on doing that innovation
[00:26:32] Piotr Kozlowski: and showing some of the work or experimenting with that work.
[00:26:36] Piotr Kozlowski: So I just tell you, John here is creating some of the incredible
[00:26:41] Piotr Kozlowski: new podcast experiences.
[00:26:42] Piotr Kozlowski: And that came from my testing, early models of turning
[00:26:46] Piotr Kozlowski: a text into a more notebook-lm style of a podcast
[00:26:51] Piotr Kozlowski: with incredible voices that you can select for German speaking
[00:26:55] Piotr Kozlowski: voices, English speaking voices, that sound good.
[00:26:59] Piotr Kozlowski: And then there's a second, which is team
[00:27:00] Piotr Kozlowski: structure piece.
[00:27:01] Piotr Kozlowski: And that's something that we didn't do until later
[00:27:03] Piotr Kozlowski: when we had more than 100 of us is that we delineate inside
[00:27:08] Piotr Kozlowski: a company product that the pre-product market fit
[00:27:10] Piotr Kozlowski: and post-product market fit.
[00:27:13] Piotr Kozlowski: On the post-product market fit, you're
[00:27:15] Piotr Kozlowski: working for the long term.
[00:27:17] Piotr Kozlowski: You test and evaluate a lot before.
[00:27:21] Piotr Kozlowski: You only deploy when that's true you ready.
[00:27:24] Piotr Kozlowski: The pre-product market fit, your mission
[00:27:26] Piotr Kozlowski: is to ship until you think we've hit the product market fit.
[00:27:29] Piotr Kozlowski: And usually we give the six-month period of proving it out.
[00:27:32] Piotr Kozlowski: If not, we kill the product and we've killed product in the past
[00:27:35] Piotr Kozlowski: this way.
[00:27:36] Piotr Kozlowski: But that's the main important piece of, OK, until we know
[00:27:39] Piotr Kozlowski: there's a big potential user base, we will continue to rating.
[00:27:44] I have been able to observe some of those, I guess,
[00:27:47] Maddie Kofanar: hard decisions in a moment, but it's the right decision
[00:27:50] Maddie Kofanar: later on to let go of some of the products.
[00:27:53] Maddie Kofanar: This is all my favorite questions.
[00:27:55] Maddie Kofanar: My partner Martin Kusato always say,
[00:27:57] Maddie Kofanar: companies go through three phases.
[00:27:59] Maddie Kofanar: There is the product phase, there's sales phase,
[00:28:01] Maddie Kofanar: and there's a scaling phase.
[00:28:03] Maddie Kofanar: And give you a bit of a few of those phases,
[00:28:06] Maddie Kofanar: what has been the hardest transition for you as a CEO?
[00:28:10] There is a lot of many ones.
[00:28:12] Piotr Kozlowski: Of course, I have my co-founder next to me
[00:28:14] Piotr Kozlowski: across each of those, which is the, I know him for 15 years.
[00:28:17] Piotr Kozlowski: He's my best friend since high school.
[00:28:19] Piotr Kozlowski: So I have the most lack to have that combination, of course,
[00:28:23] Piotr Kozlowski: your Jennifer and all the partners to help us through those transitions,
[00:28:26] Piotr Kozlowski: which has been incredible.
[00:28:28] Piotr Kozlowski: But I think the recent realization was when we are now
[00:28:35] Piotr Kozlowski: 350 people company.
[00:28:36] Piotr Kozlowski: And of course, that means our go-to-market team
[00:28:39] Piotr Kozlowski: and the incentive structure around that
[00:28:41] Piotr Kozlowski: has evolved pretty strongly.
[00:28:42] Piotr Kozlowski: And what wasn't clear to me, and now in hindsight,
[00:28:45] Piotr Kozlowski: it's obvious is that in early days,
[00:28:49] Piotr Kozlowski: everybody would just operate on a passion basis.
[00:28:52] Piotr Kozlowski: They would just operate what they think is best for their company.
[00:28:54] Piotr Kozlowski: As our go-to-market team enlarged, we realized
[00:28:57] Piotr Kozlowski: that the incentive structure really matters
[00:29:00] Piotr Kozlowski: if you are building that machine.
[00:29:02] Piotr Kozlowski: And that transition where you shift from a lot of the people
[00:29:09] Piotr Kozlowski: that are helping create that machine,
[00:29:11] Piotr Kozlowski: or part of that machine, those incentive structures
[00:29:13] Piotr Kozlowski: will eventually drive the behaviors, which
[00:29:16] Piotr Kozlowski: might be slightly different to what you had in mind
[00:29:18] Piotr Kozlowski: if you don't make it extremely clear.
[00:29:20] Piotr Kozlowski: And in some ways, the quota, the commissions,
[00:29:24] Piotr Kozlowski: are effectively a lagging indicator of strategy.
[00:29:28] Piotr Kozlowski: And then strategy is leading of what will happen in the future.
[00:29:35] Piotr Kozlowski: So you need to find a way to resolve those two together
[00:29:37] Piotr Kozlowski: where you want to make sure the quota and commissions
[00:29:40] Piotr Kozlowski: and the strategy that you want to drive are closer together.
[00:29:43] Piotr Kozlowski: And the disparity is as close as possible.
[00:29:47] Piotr Kozlowski: So here, for me, the biggest realization
[00:29:49] Piotr Kozlowski: was that we are becoming a bigger company
[00:29:52] Piotr Kozlowski: because there are clear behaviors that happen
[00:29:53] Piotr Kozlowski: based on the commissions.
[00:29:55] Piotr Kozlowski: And then, too, to actually resolve those,
[00:29:57] Piotr Kozlowski: we need to be very upfront in terms of making
[00:30:02] Piotr Kozlowski: it explicit that sometimes even if commissions are just this,
[00:30:06] Piotr Kozlowski: and you think it's a wrong thing, come back to us.
[00:30:08] Piotr Kozlowski: Let's speak about it in the just course.
[00:30:10] Piotr Kozlowski: So now we are explicit with all our sales teams
[00:30:12] Piotr Kozlowski: that if they are seeing a deal that let's say
[00:30:14] Piotr Kozlowski: might be competitive in nature, and our pricing table
[00:30:17] Piotr Kozlowski: would suggest that they can go very low and earn higher
[00:30:19] Piotr Kozlowski: commission, but they think it's wrong.
[00:30:21] Piotr Kozlowski: It's better to come to us.
[00:30:23] Piotr Kozlowski: We are happy to still grant commission, but kill the deal.
[00:30:27] Piotr Kozlowski: And Godverse, we had this case recently.
[00:30:30] Piotr Kozlowski: We're one of our foundational level competitors
[00:30:34] Piotr Kozlowski: came to us wanting to license our models for demos.
[00:30:37] Piotr Kozlowski: And of course, the incentive would suggest
[00:30:39] Piotr Kozlowski: that you should sell to them, but luckily, we didn't.
[00:30:43] Yeah.
[00:30:44] You granted commission though.
[00:30:47] Maddie Kofanar: In early days, we can definitely.
[00:30:48] Maddie Kofanar: And I just said that now it's in the policy.
[00:30:50] Piotr Kozlowski: I cannot sell to the foundational model companies.
[00:30:53] So it's clear to all that.
[00:30:55] Maddie Kofanar: Very clear.
[00:30:55] Maddie Kofanar: Very clearly.
[00:30:57] Maddie Kofanar: That was incredible, Maddie.
[00:30:58] Maddie Kofanar: Thank you so much for sharing all the lessons and learnings
[00:31:01] Maddie Kofanar: with us.
[00:31:01] Maddie Kofanar: Let's give it a round of applause to Maddie.
[00:31:03] Maddie Kofanar: Thank you.
[00:31:04] Maddie Kofanar: Thank you.
[00:31:05] APPLAUSE
