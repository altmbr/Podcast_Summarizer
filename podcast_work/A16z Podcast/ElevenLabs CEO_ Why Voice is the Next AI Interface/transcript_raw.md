[00:00:00] We don't want to become same as previous generation of the editing suites.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_00: So instead, let's solve it on the research level where it will now based on the voice,
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_00: exactly how it should speak with the speed.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_00: To be able to cut it to all those different use cases, you need such a big array of different voices,
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: different languages, different accents, different styles.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_00: So you launch the voice marketplace where you go to create your voice and then share it.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_00: And when the voice base shared, you earn money in the return.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: There we have almost 10,000 voices. We paid $10 million back to the people in the community.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_00: There are some crazy stories from the voices just speaking through exactly the technology,
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: showing the examples and kind of avoiding this initial knee jerk reaction that AI is bad has been driven.
[00:00:47] I'm excited to welcome our first speaker, Maddie Kofanar and CEO of In-N-H-H-Haz.
[00:00:58] Alright, so good to have you here, Maddie.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_01: Thanks so much for having me here. Great to see everyone and good morning.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: And that...
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_00: That was the walk-on music generated by 11 labs, was it?
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_01: It was. We expand continuously across the audio space.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: We started with voices, then created orchestration of how to build voice agents.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_00: And now also created a fully licensed music model.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_00: So can produce amazing music to go alongside with it.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_00: Awesome. We'll talk about all about that.
[00:01:35] I had the opportunity and also the luck to get to know from the very early days when 11 labs got started
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_01: and get to partner of the last three years to just see your execution everywhere from product launches to shipping.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_01: New lines and models, like you just mentioned, everything from text to speech models,
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_01: speech to text, and then we started doing music, sound effects, and now the AI agent platform.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_01: I'm very curious first, I'm still in all of the shipping speed after all this three years.
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: But I want to ask how do you actually maintain both the speed and quality when you have such expensive product roadmap?
[00:02:18] So first of all, we partnered almost three years ago.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: And so it's great to hear all the kind notes.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: But also, they didn't realize when we partnered, the infrastructure team was free people.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: And of course, now I'm 11 labs founder. We love number 11.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: And the company, Infra team is 11 people.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: So we've seen the growth of the other side as well.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: And I hear that the companies here raised $66 billion in the total fundraising.
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_00: So the number 11 is everywhere here.
[00:02:48] But the, I think the start off, I think first piece, I have a, I think the smartest person I got to know as my co-founder,
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: who has been the research brain for creating a lot of the models and then being able to assemble what we think are the most incredible researchers in the voice space,
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: to really create the first text to speech model that could understand the context in a better way and turn that into the emotion,
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: and into the nation, then find a way to capture the characteristics of the voice.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: So you have the voice sound with the right style, with the right age, with the right gender dialect, everything in one.
[00:03:25] And then the researchers across, of course, now expanded that to speech detects music and other work.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_00: So that's our foundation. And then the way we structure it to be able to ship quickly, especially with so many things happening in the space,
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: is a lot of small teams. So today we have roughly 20 product teams, each of five to ten people's size,
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: which we full independence can go ahead and ship products.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: Of course, that carries some of the, sometimes issues of the blanket of work, or sometimes people going at different speeds,
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: but at the positive end, the ownership of each of the teams is extremely high.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: So people know that this is down to them to really deliver and ship. And it allows us to move extremely quickly.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_00: And we back at our work into creative space, so creative platform where we have with narrations, voice overs, dabs for creatives and creatives in the immediate entertainment space.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: And then on the agents side where we help people recreate voice agent experience, conversational agent experience, across customer experience, all the way through to immersive media.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_01: 11 Labs has a lab's name in the labs in the name. There are similar to many of the other big labs, which means you're doing your first party R&D and model development,
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_01: but also building all these 20 products. How do you think about balancing both, like keep progressing on the model research,
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_01: but at the same time not delaying sort of the product launches?
[00:04:51] It's very tricky. I'm sure many of you have the same thing. Like, do you build the product while when you don't know,
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: if the research innovation will displace the product you just built? We had this in the early days too.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: So one of the simple examples was we had a model at work and one of the most common requests was, could we do a different speed for voices?
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_00: So could you have additional slider to modify the speed of how audio gets generated and how quickly it speaks?
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_00: And we are very against this idea of like, no, we don't want to do any sliders, any toggles.
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: We don't want to become same as previous generation of the editing suite.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_00: So instead, let's solve it on the research level where it will know based on the voice exactly how it should speak with the speed.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: And we resisted this for, I think, good amount of nine months, and we couldn't solve it on the research side.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: And then the product was super simple solve that got all the users across.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_00: And now the approach we take and looking at this is, if we think the research work will take more than three months,
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_00: the product is, can do anything they want to start adding other models, adding some of the extensions.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_00: Of course, sometimes the timeline is tricky to predict, but roughly the guidance we have from our internal research team,
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_00: what are the initiatives we hope to ship this quarter, what are long term initiatives, and then for anything long term,
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_00: you can use any other work to close that gap and make it better.
[00:06:18] I guess first, you kind of have to figure out if the research commitment is going to meet the timeline first,
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_01: and then go on to align with the product teams, that make a lot of sense.
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_01: As everyone is moving to San Francisco and building in person in locked in, like in the same space,
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_01: 11 has always been building globally and having people more distributed.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_01: But you not have centers, I guess, in different locations from London, Warsaw, San Francisco, to New York, and other places.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_01: How do you think about building this global expansion and finding talent globally versus, I guess, the trade-offs of building in the same place?
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: We started, so me and my co-founder are Polish, we started between Warsaw and London at the time, and I think 11 labs wouldn't have existed if we were in starting from Europe.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: It's a very peculiar thing, but in Poland, if you watch a movie in Polish language, like a foreign movie in Polish language,
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: all devices, whether that's a male voice or female voice, get narrated with one single character.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: No emotions, no intonation, as you can imagine, it's pretty terrible, and it's still happening today for most of the content out there.
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: I've had a similar experience growing up in China that we have a lot of western movies stopped in Chinese, monotone.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: So bad, so bad. In Poland, of course, post-communist country, it's a cheaper way to do it.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: You don't have to hire as many people, you have one monoton audio book reading of a movie, and that was kind of where the company started,
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: initially, in Europe, and we realized that if we wanted the best people to solve what was a research problem at the time, we need to hire wherever they are.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: And we couldn't lock ourselves to just San Francisco or look at the west coast.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_00: We knew that we need to find them across Europe, across Asia, and bring them into the company, so we started fully remote and started looking at those people.
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_00: And then on engineering, we also were very against this traditional hiring method of looking at LinkedIn, looking at traditional background, and trying to figure out could we go and figure out a different method to hire people.
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: That led to some very interesting hire, so we hired a person that had an incredible open source, text to speech model, and was working at the call center at the same time as a recipient of the calls to make mine.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: And he's now the team, one of the most brilliant researchers we have doing all the data processing, but the same pattern kind of followed, and of course the early team was very distributed.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: And then as we started scaling, so beyond 30 people, we realized that the new people joining, there's benefit of them having a space to be next to others, to get deeper into the culture, understand how, what are all the products that are happening in the company.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_00: And then we started the hops where you can go into London and Warsaw and San Francisco, where you can work with others in person.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: And that's how we try to like marry those two. If you are early in your career, you can, we try to hire you in the hops so you can immerse yourself in the company.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_00: If you are used to remote work completely fine, but then if you want, you can always come and join us in the hub.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_00: That worked really well. Currently we continue hiring very traditional backgrounds in some of the place of the company, and then fusing that to very traditional backgrounds, which can teach the others.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_00: And in sales, for example, we've done some of those experiments too, where that combination worked really well.
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_01: The lesson is you can really find talent everywhere. It's just how hard and how you look for them.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: In Europe, people like, this was an interesting one. In the US, people are very keen and excited to work.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_00: And if you go for an social event, you want to talk about work. And in Europe, I didn't have this feeling where most people don't want to do that.
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_00: It's like the cultural piece is different. But then you do have the pockets of people that actually strive too. They just don't have the companies where they could do that.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_00: So I feel like our team from Europe is the most motivated and passionate set of people that we are lucky to have.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_01: I can attest to that given that some of them are a hardcore, very good work ethic for sure.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_01: And you have also maintained a pretty flat work structure, and have people on quite literally a lot of responsibilities.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_01: Can you talk about the rationale behind that? And I guess there was also no title policy?
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_01: Yes, so we removed titles a year ago. And then, and it's going well, it still works.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: And I do think we, you know, we said we did it. But I thought a lot of AI companies kind of do it too already with a member of technical staff being like the usual piece you have for engineering.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_00: And then in a lot of the go to market, you are just go to market, not the p of sales or other roles.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_00: I think it's actually a pretty common pattern. But in our case, we had a small team approach where you have extremely small amount of people usually the five to 10.
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_00: And we wanted to make it very clear that every team, we create those teams. You have six months to prove it.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_00: If it's proven that team will stay and continue working, but it really is that the moment you join, you can have any impact on the company.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_00: So you can have any role in that team. The 10 year will not define your position in the hierarchy.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: If you are smart and quick and passionate, you can elevate yourself very quickly, which this really helped.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_00: And also, it's a common layer to the external world where everybody looking at 11 labs knows that we are, the go to market team, misgo to market team.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_00: There's no positioning to the same extent. What this allows us to do is I think when we speak with a lot of our partners, with a lot of car customers,
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_00: they also know that they are getting the best people and always. And we can also send people to different conferences, different events, regardless of that positioning.
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_00: I think the tricky thing in the flat structure is not only positives. In the way we currently have it's a set of leads effectively for the subdivisions.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_00: So the research, creative work, agents work, go to markets, self-serve and sales sled. And of course, ups.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: Only that's the layer of leads. And then under that, there's pretty flat small team approach across the world.
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_00: But then you really want the leads to be able to carry the complexity around the team.
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: So suggest things between one team to another if they see that there's something valuable between them happening.
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_00: So if I'm picking those people that can context switch between is super important and then lettering the team fully focused on that.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: And then having, which is, which was interesting learning, where if you put a person into all the slack channels and give them transparency, they actually get frequently distracted because then they read all the messages.
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_00: And then you can still choose not to read them, but they still do. So you kind of need to cut the access to a lot of those pieces to force the attention.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_00: And that kind of works. All those small things works work really well.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_01: Maybe we can borrow some of that lesson too.
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_01: Let's try to gear a little bit. You're on the front line seeing a lot of the creative work, whether it's from art, music, or advertising that are starting to adopt AI tools.
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_01: And in the beginning, that was not the case. There was a lot of resistance. And now we're just seeing the adaptation and the welcoming of using more of the generative AI tools, including, you know, AI audio.
[00:13:55] And you have done some really smart things from the marketplace payouts to like working with these creative industries since day one, actually.
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_01: I remember how much you stressed like we have to find a way to work with them and sort of observing sort of market shift over time.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_01: So the question is, how do you actually adapt to these changes and find the ways to work with the industry in the infancy in the beginning? And how do you navigate some of the challenges in that?
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_00: So I think the first piece is actually spending time with the industry and trying to understand what are the priorities there incentives.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_00: Of course, it's sometimes tricky. Sometimes you end up being star-struck. We had an honor and pleasure to work with Jarrett on some of his incredible work.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_00: And learn from him on like what is important and like which parts of the production process you can actually use AI.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_00: And so you want to keep, where is it actually helpful? And so I think that's the super important thesis across all the partnerships in the space.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_00: In our case, we try to figure out how to do that on the on the voice space, which is of course, with that technology, A, how will the voice acting space look like in the future?
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_00: And then, too, of course, to be able to cut through to all those different use cases, you need such a big array of different voices, different languages, different accents, different styles.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: So you launch the voice marketplace where you could create your voice and then share it. And when the voice base is shared, you earn money in the return.
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: And here we have almost 10,000 voices. We paid $10 million back to the people in the community. There are some crazy stories from the voices. One of our first voices will say a deep Spanish voice.
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_00: And the magic of the technology is that the same voice now is available on all different languages in the same way. So it's 30 different languages at the time, 70.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: But 30 languages at the time. And we had the Spanish voice join us. And it wasn't picking up on the Spain, nobody really liked it as much.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_00: And we picked up in an English speaking country, that same voice. We really love that deepness. And now it's our top free voice for all the use cases.
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_00: So hidden messages, you can all register to our voice marketplace and maybe earn some money too.
[00:16:15] So that's the second important thing. It's like figuring out how we can be part, how we can bring the industry together to disrupt together rather than just disrupt.
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_00: And with labels, I think I'm still learning how to interact. So we worked with labels that Merlin and Cobalt are four of majors to bring their music into the music models.
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_00: We can do it in a licensed way so you can generate that and give commercial rights so you're fully protected.
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_00: And that was a hard process. It took us 18 months to figure out the agreement that works. And in the end, I think the main thing was adding sort of forcing functions or forcing timings to find effectively a trigger of like, okay, this is when we do it.
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: And we either do it together or we do it separately. And those forcing functions really help out the urgency. Then we need to move that forcing function few times, but it still worked to a large extent to go after that.
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, finding the compromise wasn't easy. But then in our case, working with the labels there was kind of protecting what they are caring about.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: And they of course also care about how they continue doing well by their members, by their artists that they work with.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_00: And we have a lot of time working with their members, speaking about how we think about technology, what's going to happen in the next couple of years. And that really helped.
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: So just speaking through exactly the technology, showing the examples and kind of avoiding this initial knee jerk reaction that AI is bad has been growing.
[00:17:56] And maybe time back to the earlier question as you are navigating like this landscape.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_01: How do you think about like bringing the right talent that can.
[00:18:06] Had and lead some of these functions and these are mostly unknown territories of how to navigate it like where have you been seeing success in bringing the right people.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_01: So here for the spaces that are kind of completely new to us. So this and like legalism, another example, we would always kind of bring at least one or two people that were in that space that kind of have interacted with the same parties full time in the past.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_00: But then would actually adjust that with a lot of consulting people that would help us in a specific conversations.
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_00: So in this case in music, we had music lawyers that worked very closely with us that consult across few of them.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_00: And the good thing is that they know all the players and they effectively were this bridging up between between both of us.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: So we could speak the same language. And and then that was that was that was we have all.
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and you have had a very specific taste for people that are risk tolerant enough and also understand the commercial business opportunities to you know help guide the right.
[00:19:19] Chain of actions in each of those domains have found that very fascinating.
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: I mean legal I'm I don't know how many of you are trying to find a first legal council or have a number of those for us.
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_00: This was the I think one of the trickest roles to hire for because you are hiring into the space you don't know you know very little about.
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: And then and then we had a like the first couple of legal people that that were clearly not fed so we separated us.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_00: And then we had a third person and that person came from like a number of Fortune 500 companies.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_00: And they never worked in startup space never worked in venture. And what resulted is like everything every conversation was pointing out the risks that we see.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_00: So like anything we wanted to do was like the number of risks that this could carry.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_00: And it was really tricky to work because we it's like you kind of get risks but you've got the risk advice of like okay and this is where we should draw the line.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_00: Everything was back to decision and now we hired a person working previously in the number of companies as a council and don't poach them.
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_00: And they understand the risk equation a lot better where they are not only like a counterpart to figuring out what the risks are but also like okay this is what other companies do this is what we should
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_00: do and then there are like a true fault partner and the tremendous change.
[00:20:45] For sure. You know what laps started as more of a crater brand everywhere from the individual creators to the creators that are building businesses.
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_01: But now you have been having a lot of success moving into enterprise not just started from the AIA agent platform but you know even with the the text with speech speech and text models.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_01: How have you been navigating that transition because that's one of the very common place where you know a lot of really great consumer creator brands fall down but you have had so far.
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_01: A pretty smooth transition.
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_00: So when we when we launched we had a lot of early inbound when when we started the kind of the classic PLG a lot of inbound from enterprise and I remember speaking with a 60 z team when they joined us where our initial take was of course we want to be engineering company.
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_00: We don't want sales people we would like to reinvent that and have like engineers do the sales.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_00: We we did hire one traditional sales person and one non traditional sales person like an engineer we told him like do sales now and that really as you can imagine didn't work out in this specific case.
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_00: But we learned our lesson and we now do invest in in a combination of that it's 80% sales 20% engineering so still a little bit of that.
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_00: That is was like super important level of understanding who are the customers what they care about and working deeply with them to to bring it back.
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_00: And then that kind of working with them was kind of opening of what we need to actually do on the product and research side.
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_00: And then the people who are in the public are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_00: are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_00: this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_00: And a big part.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: And underlying all of that, and we spoke a little bit with Matt
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: before coming here, the foundation needs to be there,
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_00: which is the security, the compliance, serving the customers
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_00: across that will rely on that infrastructure.
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_00: That's something that we want to shine through at 11 laps,
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_00: where if you are using the software,
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_00: it's going to always be reliable and always.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_00: The 4.9s or 5.9s, hopefully, one day
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_00: will be there, which is tricky in AI space.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_00: That's the goal, of course, the difference between,
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_00: one of these difference between PLG and sales
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_00: is the cycle to work through and identify
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_00: the right customers is much longer.
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's where EGerness from our internal team
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_00: was interesting to observe, where you had a lot of people
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_00: that didn't work in an enterprise setting.
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_00: And then you had other side of the company that did.
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_00: And the side that did it was very skeptic about going enterprise
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_00: and waiting the six months or 12 months to results.
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_00: And in the early days, we needed to shield them
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_00: from that information.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_00: And trust us will do this, and it will work.
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_00: But they were very skeptic.
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_00: And then, of course, after 12 months, it worked out.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_00: But that was probably the hardest culturally of how you still
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: keep everyone jumping on the same train.
[00:25:11] That's exactly right.
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_01: A lot of companies actually, at least I observed sort of slow down
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_01: after starting adopting more of the enterprise, sort of product
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: launching and building for the customers request that started
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_01: to thank you so much to delay the product launches.
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_01: Is that something you're seeing?
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_01: Or is there still a good balance of, we
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_01: still want to be able to put out demos and POCs and early teasers
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: quickly, but at the same time, we'll get
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: to deliver a real buzz and reliable product.
[00:25:45] So there are two parts.
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_00: The first part is, so we have a difference on the team
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_00: structure, and then we have a difference
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_00: on the external product structure.
[00:25:53] On the external product structure, we want to ship very quickly.
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_00: But of course, if you're shipping to enterprise,
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_00: you want to make sure that it's stable and reliable.
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_00: So we delineate very clearly what's alpha, what's not alpha.
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_00: And then we go through that transition through that period.
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_00: And then as we work with the customers,
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_00: and then our partners, they can decide
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: whether they want the access to alpha in the first place.
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_00: And when they do, that's clearly shown that this is an alpha
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_00: product that might not be stable.
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_00: And so they get a choice.
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_00: And I think that choice has been the most important level,
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_00: like do you want it or not.
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_00: And some are incredible on doing that innovation
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_00: and showing some of the work or experimenting with that work.
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_00: So I just tell you, John here is creating some of the incredible
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_00: new podcast experiences.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_00: And that came from my testing, early models of turning
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_00: a text into a more notebook-lm style of a podcast
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_00: with incredible voices that you can select for German speaking
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_00: voices, English speaking voices, that sound good.
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_00: And then there's a second, which is team
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_00: structure piece.
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: And that's something that we didn't do until later
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_00: when we had more than 100 of us is that we delineate inside
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_00: a company product that the pre-product market fit
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: and post-product market fit.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_00: On the post-product market fit, you're
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_00: working for the long term.
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_00: You test and evaluate a lot before.
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: You only deploy when that's true you ready.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_00: The pre-product market fit, your mission
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_00: is to ship until you think we've hit the product market fit.
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_00: And usually we give the six-month period of proving it out.
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_00: If not, we kill the product and we've killed product in the past
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_00: this way.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_00: But that's the main important piece of, OK, until we know
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_00: there's a big potential user base, we will continue to rating.
[00:27:44] I have been able to observe some of those, I guess,
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_01: hard decisions in a moment, but it's the right decision
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_01: later on to let go of some of the products.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_01: This is all my favorite questions.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_01: My partner Martin Kusato always say,
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_01: companies go through three phases.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_01: There is the product phase, there's sales phase,
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_01: and there's a scaling phase.
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_01: And give you a bit of a few of those phases,
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_01: what has been the hardest transition for you as a CEO?
[00:28:10] There is a lot of many ones.
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_00: Of course, I have my co-founder next to me
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_00: across each of those, which is the, I know him for 15 years.
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_00: He's my best friend since high school.
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_00: So I have the most lack to have that combination, of course,
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_00: your Jennifer and all the partners to help us through those transitions,
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_00: which has been incredible.
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_00: But I think the recent realization was when we are now
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_00: 350 people company.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_00: And of course, that means our go-to-market team
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_00: and the incentive structure around that
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_00: has evolved pretty strongly.
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_00: And what wasn't clear to me, and now in hindsight,
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_00: it's obvious is that in early days,
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_00: everybody would just operate on a passion basis.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: They would just operate what they think is best for their company.
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_00: As our go-to-market team enlarged, we realized
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_00: that the incentive structure really matters
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_00: if you are building that machine.
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_00: And that transition where you shift from a lot of the people
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_00: that are helping create that machine,
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_00: or part of that machine, those incentive structures
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_00: will eventually drive the behaviors, which
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_00: might be slightly different to what you had in mind
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_00: if you don't make it extremely clear.
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_00: And in some ways, the quota, the commissions,
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_00: are effectively a lagging indicator of strategy.
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_00: And then strategy is leading of what will happen in the future.
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_00: So you need to find a way to resolve those two together
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_00: where you want to make sure the quota and commissions
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_00: and the strategy that you want to drive are closer together.
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_00: And the disparity is as close as possible.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_00: So here, for me, the biggest realization
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_00: was that we are becoming a bigger company
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_00: because there are clear behaviors that happen
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_00: based on the commissions.
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_00: And then, too, to actually resolve those,
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_00: we need to be very upfront in terms of making
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_00: it explicit that sometimes even if commissions are just this,
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_00: and you think it's a wrong thing, come back to us.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_00: Let's speak about it in the just course.
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_00: So now we are explicit with all our sales teams
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_00: that if they are seeing a deal that let's say
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_00: might be competitive in nature, and our pricing table
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_00: would suggest that they can go very low and earn higher
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_00: commission, but they think it's wrong.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_00: It's better to come to us.
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_00: We are happy to still grant commission, but kill the deal.
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_00: And Godverse, we had this case recently.
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_00: We're one of our foundational level competitors
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_00: came to us wanting to license our models for demos.
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_00: And of course, the incentive would suggest
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_00: that you should sell to them, but luckily, we didn't.
[00:30:43] Yeah.
[00:30:44] You granted commission though.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_01: In early days, we can definitely.
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_01: And I just said that now it's in the policy.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_00: I cannot sell to the foundational model companies.
[00:30:53] So it's clear to all that.
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: Very clear.
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: Very clearly.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_01: That was incredible, Maddie.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: Thank you so much for sharing all the lessons and learnings
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_01: with us.
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_01: Let's give it a round of applause to Maddie.
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
[00:31:05] APPLAUSE
