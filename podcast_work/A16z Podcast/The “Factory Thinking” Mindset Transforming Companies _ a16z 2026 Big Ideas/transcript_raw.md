[00:00:00] My big idea for 2026 is the renaissance of the American factory. I think next year we'll see
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_00: companies approach challenges from energy to mining to construction to manufacturing with the factory
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: first mindset. The modular deployment of AI and autonomy alongside skilled labor will make complex
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_00: bespoke processes operate like an assembly line. America's first grade century was built
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: on industrial strength. But it's no secret that we've lost a lot of that muscle. Some of that has
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: been from off-shoring, from the financialization of everything in the 80s leading to the large-scale
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_00: off-shoring of industrial manufacturing in the 90s and 2000s. Some of it dates back to regulations.
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_00: So rules and agencies and processes that were put in place usually for very good and specific
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_00: reasons at the time have built up over time into a crust that makes it you know very hard to do
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_00: new things into build new things in America. But here we are and we have to figure out how to
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_00: re instill a culture of building in this country. I'm not just talking about a factory in literal
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_00: sense like you have a warehouse with an assembly line where you have some mix of humans and machines
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_00: and at the end of the factory line there's a widget that pops out. I'm really thinking about the
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_00: principles of an assembly line full stop and how are those principles getting applied to industries
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_00: that aren't you know traditionally industries you think of when you think of a factory. So
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_00: housing, the construction of data centers, the construction of mines, the construction of large-scale
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: energy infrastructure and energy projects. We're seeing founders try to reduce these problems
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_00: into kind of a decomposable set of modular parts such that you can apply the principles of an
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_00: assembly line to society scale problems. And AI is a really amazing way to do that because you
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: can understand and map out different complexities in a regulation in a very formulaic and
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_00: agentic way without having to completely redesign your entire processes from scratch every single time.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_00: How do we take technology and bring the factory out into the world. You know we're building data
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: centers at an unprecedented rate today and we're you know creating standard IP and standard
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: and putting them up in record time. It's a great opportunity for us to test where autonomy,
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: AI, robotics, other technologies that are coming to maturity right now can be deployed on these
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: sort of large scale physical assets because these building projects are moving so fast. As the
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_00: data center market develops these technologies spin out and become useful across a broad cross
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: section of industrial projects whether that's the construction of new freeways and airports and
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_00: landing strips or the construction of mines and mining and refining facilities which are so
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_00: desperately needed. How do we take some of the learnings about how quickly we're able to move in
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_00: data centers and apply them to building new factories, new fabs, new facilities to manufacture
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_00: goods whether it's for the defense sector for the consumer sector or the commercial sector in
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_00: the United States. How do we build things at scale, how do we create industrial capacity and use
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_00: our ability to scale as an advantage. If you're a founder or a builder and you were excited about
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: reinventing what it means to build a factory in the United States cut back to us.
