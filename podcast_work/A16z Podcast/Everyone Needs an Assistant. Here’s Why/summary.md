# Podcast Summary: Jonathan Swanson on Delegation, Time Management, and Building Athena

## 1. Key Themes

### The Democratization of Executive Assistance Through Technology

The barrier to accessing world-class executive support has collapsed dramatically. Jonathan Swanson observed: "A couple decades ago, you had to be Marc Andreessen or Vinod Khosla to have half-distance assistants. And that cost you half a million dollars. Now with a company like Athena for $3,000 a month, you can have your own assistant." [[00:02:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=2m31s) This represents a fundamental shift in who can access leverage, with AI pushing costs even lower. The progression now follows a clear ladder: ChatGPT for $20/month, human assistants via services like Athena for $3,000/month, in-person assistants at six figures, and eventually full support teams. This democratization enables more people to break free from administrative tasks and focus on high-leverage work.

### Time as the Ultimate Non-Renewable Asset

Swanson articulates a powerful philosophy: "Brian Johnson wants to break the chains of biology. I want to break the chains of time. We can always raise another round or do another trade, but you can't raise another decade." [[00:22:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=22m21s) He argues that time is "the most valuable asset in the world. It's not gold or Bitcoin or Nvidia clusters, it's time." [[00:22:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=22m27s) This perspective fundamentally reframes how founders should think about resource allocation. The implication is that founders who don't invest in delegation and leverage are misallocating their most precious resource, treating their time as less valuable than it actually is.

### The Power Law of Goal Setting and Ruthless Prioritization

Swanson believes in extreme focus: "There's typically one thing every month or quarter that if you accomplish is worth more than everything else combined and figuring out what that one thing is is what you should do." [[00:21:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=21m11s) He warns that having too many goals can actually be a form of procrastination from the most important work. The power law applies not just to venture returns and business outcomes, but to personal productivity and life goals. Identifying and going all-in on that one critical thing is what separates exceptional execution from busy mediocrity.

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### The "Faster to Do It Myself" Paradox is Actually True—But You Must Push Through

Most delegation advice dismisses the "I can do it faster myself" mindset as an excuse. Swanson takes a contrarian stance: "The cardinal sin of delegation is that it will be faster or better to do it myself. And the reason it's a blocker is because it's true. It will actually be faster, better if you do it yourself at the first time. And it takes more effort to delegate, to teach someone how to do it. But the only way you get leverage is by going through that work." [[00:08:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=7m57s) This honest acknowledgment that delegation is initially *more* work, not less, reframes it as an investment requiring upfront costs for long-term returns. Most founders fail at delegation because they're not prepared for this activation energy.

### Interviews Become Less Reliable as Seniority Increases

Conventional wisdom says to rely heavily on interviews when hiring executives. Swanson argues the opposite: "The more senior they go, the better they hire interviewing, almost by definition. And so when you get to C-suite, they all are really good at interviewing. And so you actually have to discard the interview more the more senior they go." [[00:28:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=28m12s) Instead, he recommends asking candidates directly for their 360 reviews from previous companies and doing extensive reference checks. The higher the position, the less signal the interview provides and the more you should weight other factors.

### Leverage Drives Ambition, Not the Other Way Around

Most people assume successful people can afford support teams because they're already ambitious and wealthy. Swanson observed the reverse: "People assume that people of great power, wealth or resources can afford this team. And then that is why they have this ambition. But we've actually seen the opposite is the case as people get more leverage with assistant, their ambition increases." [[00:41:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=40m50s) Getting administrative tasks off your plate doesn't just free up time—it fundamentally expands what you believe is possible. The leverage creates space for bigger thinking, which then compounds into greater ambition.

### Most Founders Should Ignore Their Weaknesses Entirely

First-time founders often focus on improving weaknesses. Swanson advocates the opposite approach for second-time founders: "What are my weaknesses and how do I get better at them? But then a second time founder is like, forget about my weaknesses. I'm just not gonna try. I'm just gonna be really good at my strengths. And I'm gonna hire other people to do all the things I'm not good at. And that is way more effective." [[00:47:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=47m9s) This represents a fundamental shift from self-improvement to team-building as the primary scaling mechanism.

## 3. Companies Identified

### **Athena**
**Description:** Executive assistance service providing human assistants augmented by AI technology, employing ~4,000 people, primarily in the Philippines.

**Why Mentioned:** Swanson's current company, which he founded to scale access to executive assistance. The company screens 50,000 applicants monthly and hires approximately 1 in 300. Athena represents his vision of merging human and AI assistance into a unified product.

**Quote:** "Athena, we have 50,000 assistants apply per month. And we put them through a huge battery of tests. And we hire like one in 300." [[00:56:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=55m50s)

### **Thumbtack**
**Description:** Local services marketplace that scaled to significant size after nearly being eliminated from Google's search results early in its history.

**Why Mentioned:** Swanson's previous company where he served as co-founder for approximately a decade. The company survived multiple near-death experiences including being completely removed from Google search results, demonstrating the importance of persistence.

**Quote:** "I went to Google, you type in thumbtack and nothing shows up. And we basically received the death penalty from Google...And our revenue went to zero." [[00:32:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=32m34s)

### **OpenAI**
**Description:** AI research and deployment company.

**Why Mentioned:** Cited as an example of successful incubation, where Sam Altman started it as a side project before going all-in when he recognized its massive potential.

**Quote:** Referenced in discussion of incubation vs. full commitment at [[00:48:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=48m29s)

## 4. People Identified

### **Marney** (Last name not provided)
**Description:** Jonathan Swanson's executive assistant for over a decade, based in the Philippines.

**Why Mentioned:** Exemplifies the power of long-term compounding in assistant relationships. Started by helping with basic tasks, eventually helped him make friends, plan his wedding, and now helps with his children. Demonstrates how a decade-long partnership creates irreplaceable value.

**Quote:** "I've been working with Marney for a decade, like a little sister now and she knows everything about me...Marney had invited people, set up the chef and the bartender, and we walk in and we make new friends. And I met Catherine, my wife through that, and then Marney's helping plan our wedding, and now Marney helps us with our kids." [00:05:36, 00:06:05]

### **Logan Green** (Lyft CEO)
**Description:** Co-founder and former CEO of Lyft.

**Why Mentioned:** Demonstrated extreme focus during competitive periods by responding to meeting requests with simply "war mode," showing the importance of ruthless prioritization during critical company phases.

**Quote:** "I remember emailing Logan a question, probably to come to one of our dinners. And he just responded war mode. And I love that. And I'm like, well, most people should actually be in war mode like 90% of the time." [[00:51:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=51m2s)

### **Clayton Christensen** (Author)
**Description:** Harvard Business School professor and author.

**Why Mentioned:** Wrote "How Will You Measure Your Life," which inspired Swanson and his now-wife Catherine to create quarterly "life board of directors" meetings, applying business rigor to personal relationships.

**Quote:** "We read this book called How You Measure Life by Clayton Christensen and he basically told the story of how Harvard Business School professor, kids come back and reunions and their Fortune 500 CEOs are super rich and their lives aren't shambles." [[00:18:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=18m39s)

### **Sir Michael Moritz** (Sequoia Capital)
**Description:** Legendary venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital.

**Why Mentioned:** Made the controversial but accurate observation that "there's only one founder," which initially seemed rude but proved true over time as organizations scale.

**Quote:** "I heard Sir Michael at Sequoia say something that was like, there's only one founder. And he said it at a founder event. And I was like, I was rude. There's lots of co-founders here. And now a decade later, I'm like, of course, there is only one co-founder that goes to distance because ultimately, as you scale the org, it only makes sense to have one person on top." [[00:34:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=34m0s)

### **Jensen Huang** (NVIDIA CEO)
**Description:** CEO of NVIDIA.

**Why Mentioned:** Exemplifies the principle that organizational structure should match personal style, reportedly having 46 direct reports—an unconventional structure that works for him.

**Quote:** "Jensen Huang has like 46 direct reports or something, which is absolutely insane, but it works for him." [[00:46:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=46m31s)

## 5. Operating Insights

### Delegate by Algorithm, Not by Task

The evolution from novice to expert delegator involves a fundamental shift in approach. Swanson explains: "The kind of entry level delegation is you delegate by task. You say, help me plan this dinner party. If you just say that, you're not gonna get what you want. The more advanced way to delegate is called delegate by algorithm, where you actually export your own internal preferences as you delegate." [[00:06:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=6m13s) For example, when delegating dinner party planning, specify: six to eight people, similar fundraising stages, similar number of employees. This creates a repeatable system that improves over time with feedback, rather than requiring constant re-instruction.

### Voice Delegation is 2-3x Faster Than Typing

Most founders delegate via text, which is the slowest method. Swanson advocates: "Better to use all 10 fingers at a computer, but that's actually pretty slow as well. The best way to really delegate is using your voice. And so voice, you can talk two to three times faster, you can do it on the go, you can do it on a date, and between lunch, you know, in the Uber, at thumbtack during hyperscale times, I would walk between meetings and between a meeting, I would be voice noting to assistant." [[00:09:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=8m55s) The key insight: work from one meeting can be completely delegated before the next meeting starts, preventing accumulation.

### The 360 Review Hack for Executive Hiring

Rather than relying solely on curated references, Swanson takes a direct approach: "I just ask people for their 360 reviews. Like at their last company, 10 people wrote reviews of them that are honest about their strengths and weaknesses, and I just asked to see it. And I say, hey, I'll share mine, you show me yours." [[00:28:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=28m45s) This bypasses the filtering of traditional references and provides ground truth about how someone actually performs and is perceived by colleagues.

### Financial Leverage Starts with Cost Savings

For founders concerned about EA ROI, Swanson recommends: "The first thing I'd recommend if you're getting an assistant is to have them help you save money. If you have a big budget, not a big deal, but the first project can be, hey, help pay for your salary by looking through all my subscriptions, finding things to save me money, find me refunds." [[00:12:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=12m35s) This psychological trick helps justify the investment while the assistant proves their value.

### Weekly Calendar Audits Prevent Time Drift

Swanson endorses Keith Rabois's practice: "At the end of every week do a calendar audit of the last week. Like what are the meetings you had that you wish you wouldn't have? And then looking at the next." [[00:23:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=23m20s) The key is that AI or assistants can automate this process: "At the end of each week, it just tells you. Here's what you prioritized. Those are actually your goals. If not, then next week we should adjust those things." [[00:23:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=23m37s)

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The Screen-Watching AI That Predelegates Tasks

Buried in the conversation is a remarkable product Athena has built internally but not yet released: "We build something that watches your screen as you work and it screenshots the screen. And when it identifies things that you should be delegated to your assistant, it automatically adds it to your assistant's task list." [[00:10:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=10m0s) The person using this system now has "the majority of his delegations are now machine generated. He's not talking. He's just working and the machine is magically pulling tasks and putting on his assistant's plate." [[00:10:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=10m30s) This represents a fundamentally different paradigm—delegation happening automatically through observation rather than explicit instruction, essentially reading your mind through your actions.

### The Stanford Business School Rejection Email as Fuel

Swanson preserved an email from a Stanford GSB dean warning him that turning down admission was "the biggest mistake in your life." Rather than responding, he saved it: "I have it as an email in my, this save that I'm just going to respond to whenever some tech goes public and be like, I made the right decision." [[00:37:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4l_XrrRNc&t=36m53s) This speaks to a deeper insight about using external skepticism and rejection as long-term motivation. The best founders don't just prove doubters wrong—they carefully curate and preserve those doubts as fuel for decades-long journeys.
