[00:00:00] Brian Johnson wants to break the chains of biology.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_01: I want to break the chains of time.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_01: We can always raise another round or do another trade,
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_01: but you can't raise another decade.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_01: You're running a massive company.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_00: You also do investing.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: You're also happy marriage with four kids.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: I know the way that you do it all is delegation.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: What is the secret that you've figured out?
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_00: Cardinal Sin of delegation is that it will be faster
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_01: or better to do it myself.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_01: And the reason it's a blocker is because it's true.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_01: But the only way you get leverage is by going through that work.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_01: A couple decades ago,
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_01: you had to be market-rich swimmer for the North Coast
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_01: to have half-distance assistants.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: And that cost you half a million dollars.
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_01: Now with a company like Athena for $3,000 a month,
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_01: you can have your own assistant.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_01: What have you learned in your extensive founder career?
[00:00:46] Jonathan, welcome to the podcast.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for having me.
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_00: So Jonathan, you're running a massive company.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_00: What?
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_00: 4,000 employees?
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_00: 4,000?
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_00: 4,000 employees.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: You also do investing.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_00: You're also, you know, happy marriage with four kids.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_00: How do you do it all?
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_00: I know the way that you do it all is delegation.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_00: You have a chief of staff, a bunch of EAs.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_00: Why don't you talk about what is the secret
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: that you've figured out that other people can learn from?
[00:01:13] Yeah, so my origin story here is out of school,
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_01: I worked the White House,
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_01: and I sat in the West Wing next to the president's
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: executive assistants.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_01: And as you might imagine, the EAs in the West Wing
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: were really freaking good.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: And it set my bar super high for what
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: this EA client partnership could look like.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: And when I moved to San Francisco to start a thumbtack,
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_01: I said, OK, I'm not president.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: But what if I had an EA and support team
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_01: that was as good as the president's?
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: Like, what could I accomplish?
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_01: And so at thumbtack, as we were scaling the business,
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: I hired my first assistant in the Philippines,
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_01: started helping me with basic stuff, inbox, calendar,
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_01: and then we just got creative.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_01: And we did more and more complex interesting things
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_01: which we can talk about.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_01: And what I found was the more leverage I got,
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: the more ambition I got, and it just compounded.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_01: And you know, you started with one assistant.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_01: I've got a half dozen.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_01: And every assistant gives me more leverage
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_01: to take on more things.
[00:02:13] It's fascinating, because some people say, hey,
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_00: Bill Gates is so much richer than me,
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_00: but he has the same phone that I have.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: Or I remember, maybe it was you, maybe someone else,
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: who was like, way Obama should have, you know,
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_00: or the president should have way better information than me.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: And yet they're like reading political, too.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: Like they're reading the same.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: This is like another example of it, which is,
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_00: you know, democratization where a White House
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: have amazing assistants, but thanks to Athena, you know,
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_00: and technology, at some point everyone will have a certain,
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: you know, a couple decades ago,
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: you had to be Mark and Dresden or Veno de Cosva
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_01: to have a half dozen assistants,
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: and that cost you half a million dollars.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_01: Now with coming like Athena for $3,000 a month,
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_01: you can have your own assistant.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: And then with AI, yeah, it's gonna become ubiquitous.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_01: People are, there's gonna be billions of people
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: learning to delegate to a machine assistant.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_01: And as your budget increases, you might add a human
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_01: or achieve a staff on top,
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_01: but it's just kind of a ladder of leverage.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_01: How should we think about what are the things that humans can do
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: versus what are the things that AI can do?
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: I remember my friends started Clara, you know,
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: a decade ago, just trying to be AI assistants
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: of effective absences well before a lot of the innovation.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: But what is the right way of thinking about
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: for the human AI, you know, really?
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it means the moving target, obviously,
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_01: is gonna get increasingly more capable.
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_01: And our view is it's like self-driving cars,
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_01: where it's not self-driving overnight.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: It's, you drive the test lead first,
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_01: and then there's assisted steering and braking
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_01: and then other time it becomes more autonomous
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_01: and the same thing is gonna happen with assistants.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_01: Now my view here for founders is,
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_01: if you don't have an assistant, you are the assistant,
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_01: and you don't wanna be the assistant.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_01: And so no matter your budget,
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: you should first start by learning to delegate.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_01: And if you only got 20 bucks a month,
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: you start by delegating to chat GPT.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_01: And prompt engineering is really just delegating.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: And if you become world class at leveraging chat GPT
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_01: to brainstorm your goals, figure out how you can take
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: the next step in the business.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_01: Once you have the budget for a human assistant
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_01: or a chief of staff, then you're prepared to go
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: that next level.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: So you start 20 bucks a month.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: If you have budget, then you hire someone direct
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_01: with a service like Athena.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: If you have enough money, you hire someone in person.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_01: That's six figures.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_01: You know, and if you're a legendary budget,
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_01: then you've got a suite of assistants
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_01: and chief of staff following you around.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_00: So I've had an Atea EA for many years now,
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: and she's absolutely amazing.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: And I use her for scheduling and typical assistant activities,
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_00: but you have many assistants,
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_00: you know, our friend Sam Corco has a bunch of assistants as well.
[00:04:48] Close the gap between,
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_00: what are the people who do it well?
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, what else do people get leveraged on
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: or delegate that?
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: Maybe it's not obvious.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: So first you start by taking the pain off of your life.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, I never wait on hold.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_01: I never put my credit card in the internet.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_01: I would never fill DMV forms, never do passport or no.
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_01: The world is full of all these annoyances.
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_01: And so first you take off these things that drain you,
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_01: that don't give you leverage.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: Then once you've done that,
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_01: then the next thing is you raise your sights.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_01: And you're like, what's a new business I could start?
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: How can I scale my business faster?
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: How can I spend more time with my family?
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_01: What are the things I actually cared to do a lot more of?
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_01: And so I start with basic stuff, inbox calendar,
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_01: stuff that everyone does,
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: but then I just start experimenting.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know, during the scale up days of thumbtack,
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: when we were in a house, working all the time,
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_01: I told Marney and my assistant,
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_01: I don't really have any friends outside of work.
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_01: It's like the only people I know are in this building,
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_01: I need to make some friends.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_01: And so I told her this plan a founder dinner at my house
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_01: every other week,
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_01: and we did lots of this together back in the day.
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_01: And that's how I made all my best friends.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_01: And I just walked home from work,
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_01: and Marney had invited people,
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_01: set up the chef and the bartender,
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_01: and we walk in and we make new friends.
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_01: And I met Catherine, my wife through that,
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_01: and then Marney's helping plan our wedding,
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_01: and now Marney helps us with our kids.
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know, it starts small,
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_01: and then you just kind of compound these things.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_01: And in that example,
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_00: like, say more about how did she know who to reach out to,
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: or what kind of yet.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so the kind of entry level delegation
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_01: is you delegate by task.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_01: You say, help me plan this dinner party.
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_01: If you just say that, you're not gonna get what you want.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_01: The more advanced way to delegate is called
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_01: delegate by algorithm,
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_01: where you actually export your own internal preferences
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_01: as you delegate.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_01: So I would say,
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_01: hey, when I plan dinner parties,
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_01: I like to have six to eight people.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_01: I like people to raise similar amounts of capital
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_01: or be at similar stages or similar number of employees,
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: and literally write an algorithm
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_01: for how you find the right people.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_01: And then you give feedback on whether they're worked or not.
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_01: And once the algorithm's fully exported from your head,
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_01: then it's just rinse and repeat.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know,
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: engineers tend to be better at creating these kind of like,
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_01: SOPs or standard practices,
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_01: but it's something that you can learn to do.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_01: And so, share more about how you,
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_00: for people with multiple systems,
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: or how do you differentiate,
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: like how do you, you know,
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_00: sort of delegate across the team?
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, start with one.
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_01: And then like any team you specialize.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_01: And so, I just had one that did everything as a generalist.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_01: And now, if that doesn't,
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_01: which I don't know, sounds crazy,
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: but each one's specialized into everything.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_01: One is on work, one is on home,
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_01: one is on kids, family, travel, finances.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:07:37] And that specialization is helpful
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_01: because the finance person is just thinking about
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_01: balance sheet, you know,
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_01: sending wires, all that sort of stuff.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: And then I've achieved staff who sits on top,
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_01: who distributes work across all of them.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_01: What are other principles, like, you know,
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_00: I love this delegate,
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: I'll go algorithm, not by task.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: What are other principles or frameworks
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: that are really important or not obvious
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: to, you know, get the most out of an assistant?
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the, the,
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_01: the cardinal sin of delegation
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_01: is that it will be faster,
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_01: better to do it myself.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: And the reason it's a blocker is because it's true.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_01: It will actually be faster,
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_01: better if you do it yourself at the first time.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_01: And it takes more effort to delegate,
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: to teach someone how to do it.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: It might not be as fast or as good as you'd like it,
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_01: but the only way you get leverage
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_01: is by going through that work.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_01: So you have to overcome that activation energy.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_01: The second mistake people make is they don't compound
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_01: for the long term and they hire someone
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_01: and then switch an assistant every six,
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_01: 12 months, but it's the compounding
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_01: that creates incredible leverage.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_01: I've been working with Marty for a decade,
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_01: like a little sister now
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: and she knows everything about me.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_01: So this is kind of like common principles.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_01: In terms of the way to delegate,
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_01: I think the, this is just tactical, the methods,
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_01: you know, the most common way people delegates
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_01: with your thumbs and your phone,
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_01: that's the worst way, very slow.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_01: Better to use all 10 fingers at a computer,
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: but that's actually pretty slow as well.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_01: The best way to really delegate is using your voice.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_01: And so voice, you can talk two to three times faster,
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_01: you can do it on the go, you can do it on a date,
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_01: and between lunch, you know, in the Uber,
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_01: at thumbtack during hyperscale times,
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_01: I would walk between meetings and between a meeting,
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_01: I would be voice noting to assistant.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: Here's the takeaways, pre-draft these five emails,
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_01: follow up with this person,
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: and all my work from that meeting was actually delegated
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_01: by the time I started the next meeting
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_01: versus everything kind of accumulating
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_01: and then you get to the end of the day
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_01: and you're like, I have other things to do.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_01: And so learning to delegate by voice,
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: if you look at all the super delegators of Athena,
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_01: they are all just delegated by voice all day long.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_00: Yes, fascinating.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_00: Well, at some point it's gonna be,
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: you know, not only have to say it, I just think it.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:09:52] Oh, yeah.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_01: This is part of our vision, Athena longer term,
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_01: is you shouldn't have to actually vocalize it.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_01: And we've built an internal demo of this.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_01: It's not live for customers,
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_01: but the way it works is we build something
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_01: that watches your screen as you work
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_01: and it screenshots the screen.
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_01: And when it identifies things that you should be
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_01: delegated to your assistant,
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_01: it automatically adds it to your assistant's task list.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_01: Your assistant then says,
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_01: oh, Eric would want my help with this
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_01: or maybe he'll do this one his own
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_01: and that creates the reinforcement learning
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: effectively to tune the model,
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: to pull things off of your screen.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: You don't have to vocalize.
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_01: And so the person who built this internally
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_01: has been using it.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_01: The majority of his delegations are now machine generated.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_01: He's not talking.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_01: He's just working and the machine is magically pulling tasks
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_01: and putting on his assistant's plate.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_01: He'll take a while to bring that to market and fruition,
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_01: but that's the future.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_01: This should also be,
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: this should also be a version where it's like,
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_00: you know, you see in Slack,
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_00: that's, you know, it's someone's birthday
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: or someone has a baby or something
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_00: and it suggests, hey, do you wanna get this person,
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_00: this specific gift or something?
[00:11:04] Yeah, I think this is a place where we're thinking a lot
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_01: about the human machine merger
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: and how we get the best of both.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_01: And that's really the vision of Athena.
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_01: It was like the best human assistant,
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_01: the best AI wrapped into one combined product that's seamless
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_01: and humans obviously have human touch and good UX.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_01: But what machines can do is remember everything
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_01: and be super proactive.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: So you can look through every email, every calendar
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_01: and remind you to do things
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: that you would not have thought to do.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: One thing you've always been fascinated about
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: is sort of international labor,
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_00: some call, you know, labor arbitrage.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: What is the right way of thinking about
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: what people and say the Philippines can do
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_00: or can't do versus, you know,
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_00: assistance in the US?
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_00: Like how do people,
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_00: it's obviously there's a huge cost savings.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_00: What are stuff that you keep in that cost savings
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_00: or stuff that you don't keep?
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_00: Or like what's the right way of thinking?
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, America's strength is entrepreneurship,
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_01: capital, innovation, technology,
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: and the more you can leverage someone to do back office tasks,
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_01: the more you can spend on technology, product, et cetera.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, I think the thing Athena focuses on
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_01: is executive assistance,
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_01: someone who can do all of this admin.
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_01: But people are using global talent for all sorts of things
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: for legal, medical, and all the above.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So, let's get a little bit,
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_00: on the finance thing, I'm curious
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_00: because I don't leverage mine there.
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_00: What are the ways that people could get leverage
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: from this is not a fact?
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_00: Because are you still interfacing with the accountants
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_00: or are they, yeah, what is the right way of thinking about?
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So, I mean, the first thing I'd recommend
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_01: if you're getting an assistant is to have them
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_01: help you save money.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_01: If you have a big budget, not a big deal,
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_01: but the first project can be,
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_01: hey, help pay for your salary
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_01: by looking through all my subscriptions,
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: finding things to save me money, find me refunds.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_01: So, that's just kind of like a cost-saving bucket.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_01: Then there's admin paying bills,
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_01: and then there's coordination,
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_01: which is what you're talking about, basically being a PM.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_01: So, coordinating the tax attorney asks for something
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_01: from the accountant, and there's a bunch of docs,
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_01: and there's just moving paperwork between systems,
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_01: add enough scale and complexity
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_01: that becomes effectively a full-time job.
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_01: And obviously, you need someone you truly trust
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_01: to go deep with, and we kind of recommend
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_01: that you build this trust ever time,
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_01: and you give email and counter access at first,
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_01: and bank account later.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_01: But as you earn that trust,
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_01: then the more access you give,
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_01: effectively, the more leverage you get.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_00: Yes, we're interesting.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_00: And in terms of seeing more about what it's been like
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_00: to scale this company where you have,
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: and you know, you dealt with this thumbtack too,
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: a little bit in terms of just work forces
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: in different areas,
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_00: and how you think about culture between them,
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_00: and yeah, kind of what are the challenges
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_00: or what's really important to get right?
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, we look for cultures
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_01: that have strong affinity to American culture.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_01: You know, Philippines has long history with America.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_01: They like no American pop culture in sports,
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_01: but then I do.
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_01: And then they have a very strong work ethic,
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_01: and it's a caretaking culture.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_01: So there's lots of nurses,
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_01: and one of the reasons we picked it for assistance
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_01: is being an executive assistant
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_01: is really taking care of someone.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_01: It's like their full time job
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_01: is to make your life better,
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_01: is to take things off your plate
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_01: to help you be successful.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_01: And I think one of the barriers for some people
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_01: to get an assistant is it feels indulgent.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_01: So should I really have someone
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_01: who's just taking care of me?
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_01: But the way I flip that around is you not delegating
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_01: and you're not giving leverage is holding you back,
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_01: but it's actually preventing you from creating a job
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_01: for someone who's excited to help you.
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_01: And for the people in our team,
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_01: they could have worked with the CEO.
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_01: They could see behind this exciting startup
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_01: that is a totally different life than they live.
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_01: And for them, that is a cool, exciting life-changing thing.
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:15:18] When a thing that I think people should be using
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: as this is more for is not only delegation,
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: but also accountability of like,
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_00: hey, you want to be exercising this amount
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_00: or you want to be spending your time doing XYZ
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_00: or you want to make sure you go to your appointments
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: or something.
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_00: Do we have some clients who actually exercise live
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_01: with their assistance for this reason?
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_01: They both have a fitness goal.
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_01: And so they pull videos at a set time
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_01: and they work out together.
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_01: And that's the place where human accountability
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_01: is a little more powerful than machine accountability.
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_01: Chatchy PT actually has a feature now
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_01: where it will automatically pin you on thing.
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_01: So if you can't afford a assistant,
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_01: you just tell Chatchy PT, here's my top five goals,
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_01: ask me how I'm doing every day,
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_01: log my results and give me feedback.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: You can get that for 20 bucks a month.
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: I've done similar versions of this with human assistance.
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_01: I think we may have done this in the past
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: where I'm like, hey, I want to work out, meditate,
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: be clean, send me a ping on WhatsApp every day
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_01: and I'll just reply, yes, no, yes, no,
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_01: whether I did it.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: And then at the end of each week, send me a scorecard
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_01: and compare me to Eric or Catherine
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_01: and we can have a little competition with it
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: and helping you hit your goals
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_01: is exactly what they should be doing.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_00: And then the other thing I think is an interesting opportunity
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_00: to get more leverage because these people are also,
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: not just Operation Savage,
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: pretty intuitive, they go into caring fields.
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_00: And so there's also opportunities for coaching too
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_00: or they're the people that have most contacts on you
[00:16:53] SPEAKER_00: and they can give feedback on how you're engaging
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_00: or they can tell you, hey, you're tired today.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that was my first observation
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_01: when I was in the West Wing,
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_01: the assistants who said next to the president were insane.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: They were so good.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: They went on to become elected to Congress
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_01: and amazing people.
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_01: But at the end of the day,
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_01: the president and his advisors
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: would have been meeting with senators and all these people
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_01: and they would finish the meeting, they would lean back
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_01: and they would have the assistant come over
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_01: and they'd just be like, what's going on?
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_01: And it was more than just accomplishing things.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_01: This was their closest confidant
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_01: who saw behind the scenes on everything.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_01: They knew the good and the bad.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_01: They know they'd gotten kicked in the nuts
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_01: a couple of times that day from different things
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_01: and they're there for them.
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_01: I think that human element is gonna remain important
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_01: for a long time no matter how good A.I. gets
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_01: and it's something you should lean into.
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_01: We have clients who tell us that, yeah,
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_01: like going through a divorce or a depression
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_01: and like my assistant's like there for me
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_01: in a way that others aren't
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_01: and like I can't tell my company
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_01: or my team about some of these things
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_01: but this is the person that's like on the inside with you.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, totally.
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_01: Really, literally one of the things
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_00: you've had really interesting insights on over the years
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_00: is how to spend time.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: Think about time management,
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_00: not only in terms of ways to get more of it,
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_00: via delegating but also how to prioritize
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_00: and I've learned this from you,
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_00: but you think about goals on a sort of annual quarterly,
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_00: like on different increments.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: Maybe we could start with LBD
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_00: and how you think about goal setting in general
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_00: and then we can get a bit deeper.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_01: My wife, Katherine and I,
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_01: who we met as friends,
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_01: wanna develop this friendship
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_01: over one of these entrepreneurship dinners,
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_01: we read this book called How You Measure Life
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_01: by Clayton Creshenson
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_01: and she basically told the story of how
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_01: Harvard Business School professor,
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_01: kids come back and reunions
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_01: and their Fortune 500 CEO is super rich
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_01: and their life's aren't shambles,
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_01: their divorce have all these problems,
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_01: the kids don't talk to them, going to jail
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_01: and he's like the rigor they apply to their businesses,
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_01: the quarterly reviews, the metrics
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_01: were completely absent from their life
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_01: and his point was how do you wanna measure your life
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_01: and Katherine, I read this book
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_01: and we were just friends at the time
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_01: but we're both like,
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_01: I wanna be on your life board directors,
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_01: that's the freaking do that.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_01: And so we just started tradition a decade ago.
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_01: Every quarter we get together,
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_01: we fill out a survey in our relationship,
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_01: strengths and weaknesses,
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_01: kind of squat analysis, geeky stuff
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_01: and then we talk about like what can we improve,
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_01: what can we do better and like anything,
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_01: if you the more you invest, the better it gets.
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_01: Totally.
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_01: And yeah, I think that's the key point
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_00: because some people are turned off
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_00: by sort of like quantification,
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_00: like they want their relationship to be placed
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_00: like you know, relax, turn off or something
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_00: and I think it's less that you have to like,
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_00: you know, quantify every element of it
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_00: and more just that you wanna,
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_00: you don't wanna let the lack of quantification mean
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: that you're not prioritizing it.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_00: And so this just excurses to make sure
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_00: that you're actually just like keeping accountable
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: to how you wanna be.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_01: It's a be purposeful good the thing you want
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_01: if you're a geek like us and you measure it
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_01: and you track everything.
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_01: And if you just wanna go have like a day and drink wine
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_01: and talk about your relationship that works too,
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_01: I think it's just the people prioritize fitness
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_01: or their work, but they never think about
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_01: how do I prioritize my relationship?
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_01: Like what's the fitness or the workout
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_01: or the yoga equivalent for my relationship?
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_01: Having been in many goals setting sessions with you,
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_00: one of the things I think that you intuitively understand
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_00: or have learned and are often instilling in others
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_00: is this idea of prioritization.
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_00: Like when people say goals, they say a lot of goals
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_00: and they don't sort of think about,
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_00: hey, what is the one that makes everything else much easier?
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: And you know, what is the one thing that if we did
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_00: would be a great year, a great quarter, whatever it is.
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_00: Who sets too many goals?
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_00: I mean a little bit.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_01: But yeah.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think my views is there's a power law
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_01: and everything and power law and business,
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_01: power law and venture, power law in your life.
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_01: And there's typically one thing every month or quarter
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_01: that if you accomplish is worth more than everything
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_01: else combined and figuring out what that one thing is
[00:21:28] is what you should do.
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_01: Figure that thing out and then go all in
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_01: on that and not to say that having other goals isn't worthwhile
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_01: but if you haven't identified the one thing
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_01: and gotten all in to make that happen
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_01: then I think it's not optimized.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_01: I think it's also easier to kind of procrastinate
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_01: on the most important thing in your life
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_01: by having a long list.
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_01: And you do a bunch of different things
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_01: but there's that one thing.
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_01: It's find your partner, it's start the business,
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_01: it's fix my health that really is more foundational
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_01: than everything else.
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_01: So to that end, I'm curious if you'd share more frameworks
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_00: or principles you live by in terms of time.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_00: Like for example, I believe you try to stack meetings
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_00: in a day or in as few days as possible or something
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_00: what are certain frameworks that are important for you
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: in terms of time, energy, you know.
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_00: I mean, high level is that Brian Johnson wants
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_01: to break the chains of biology or longevity.
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_01: I want to break the chains of time.
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_01: And you know, the question I asked myself
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_01: is like what's the most valuable asset in the world?
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_01: It's not gold or Bitcoin or nevidia clusters, it's time.
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_01: We can always raise another round or do another trade
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_01: but you can't raise another decade.
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_01: And so if time is the primary asset
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_01: and it's more foundational than everything else,
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_01: we should focus on owning that and controlling it.
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_01: And so for different, this means different things
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_01: for different people.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_01: If you're in hardcore scale mode,
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_01: that may mean half hour meetings for 14 hours a day
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_01: where you are just grinding out interviews
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_01: and doing things that only you can do as a founder.
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_01: Or it may mean clearing your schedule
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_01: and having time to dream about the future of the product
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_01: or big deals.
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_01: And I think you just have to know what stage
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_01: of the business you're in and then design your calendar
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_01: purposefully around that.
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_01: And if you look back on the last month
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_01: and the calendar does not reflect your highest goals,
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_01: then you're not doing all right.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I remember Keith Reboi shared with me this idea
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_00: of like at the end of every week
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_00: do a calendar audit of the last week.
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_00: Like what are the meetings you had
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_00: that you wish you wouldn't have?
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_00: And then I'm just looking at the next.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_00: I mean, this is a place,
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_01: a theme assistance can do this proactively for you
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_01: but this is a place that AI is obviously going to automate
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_01: and it will be very powerful.
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_01: Or it's at the end of it each week, it just tells you.
[00:23:47] SPEAKER_01: Here's what you prioritize.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: Those are actually your goals.
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_01: If not, then next week we should adjust those things.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_01: Here's for your interpretation of meetings.
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: Some people are like,
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_00: you know, I want to have as few meetings as possible.
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: Me is not the most efficient.
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_00: I'd rather do everything async.
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_00: What is your kind of sort of thinking
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_00: between async and synchronous?
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_00: I mean, Navelle has a good line that's like,
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_01: the phone calls better than a meeting.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_01: A voice loss is better than a call.
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_01: A text is better than a voice now.
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_01: I think in general that's true.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_01: And there's this,
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_01: it's almost like a generational thing where
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_01: I feel like you're in this a little bit of like,
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_01: there's a reluctance to call people on the phone
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_01: and it's just we do everything text and email
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_01: but calling people is super effective.
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_01: It's really hyped in with.
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_01: You configure, shit out in five minutes
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_01: and so I personally try to minimize meetings
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_01: and then do more picking up the phone
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_01: and talking to someone for five minutes.
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_01: When I'm in more chairman mode,
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_01: then I prioritize as few meetings as possible
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_01: and voice notes and I,
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_01: what I request is voice notes out and text message back
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_01: because we're listening to voice notes is slow.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_01: It's a solute as market reason.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is interesting.
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_00: One of my favorite self-help books is the seven
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_00: effective habits, how effective people.
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_00: And one of their principles at Maxim's
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_00: is this idea of like, efficiency with when it comes to
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_00: achieving tasks or accomplishing tasks
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_00: but effectiveness when it comes to people.
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_00: And so the efficient path might not be the effective path
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_00: because you might, you sort of save some time
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_00: on the front end but you might,
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_00: you know, a crew is sort of a debt on the back end.
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_00: And yeah, it might be efficient to just send a text
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_00: or something but, you know, keeping the dynamic,
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_00: yeah, phone calls are obviously underrated and.
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's true remote cultures too.
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_01: Like remote cultures build up debt of just the lack of bandwidth.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_01: And so if you are in a remote culture,
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_01: you should get together every couple of months
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: for a few days in person.
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_00: How do you think about how,
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_00: when founders are asking for advice,
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_00: like how should I spend time?
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_00: Like what's most important?
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_00: Like what frameworks are helpful for founders
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_00: about thinking about, obviously there's a million things
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_00: they could be doing.
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_00: There's not enough time in the day for, you know,
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_00: even a fraction of them.
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_00: What are the most important ways to get right
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: whether it's your time at thumbtimes?
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_01: Like it's build your product,
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_01: who's the customer, who's race capital,
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_01: builder team.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_01: And when founders asked me like how to leverage an assistant,
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_01: what should I be doing?
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_01: My way I turn around is like,
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_01: what's your top two goals for the month?
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_01: If it's recruiting, you have to be closing candidates
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_01: but you don't need to be sourcing all of the emails.
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_01: You could pull up a voice note and say,
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_01: here's a template I want you to reach out to.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_01: Here's, then you go through my contacts.
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_01: Here's 20 people send an outreach email
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_01: asking them for suggestions for this role.
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_01: You know, if your goal is to race capital,
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_01: your assistant could help project manage the process
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_01: of all of that.
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know, step one is you set your goals
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_01: and then you break them down into sub tasks
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_01: and your assistant won't be able to run the fundraise
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_01: but can run components of it.
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_01: And your job is just to decompose things
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_01: into the smallest part that you can hand off.
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_01: Maybe you should have some sort of like forward deployed,
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_00: you know, sort of thing of it.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: It's not just the assistant,
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_00: but it's also someone that helps you
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_00: like really get the most leverage out of it
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_00: and watches, you know, your activity.
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_00: One of our learnings from this business,
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_01: when we first started it,
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_01: we were like, we're just gonna hire the best assistants,
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_01: match them with clients and boom, amazing.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_01: But we matched the first five assistants
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_01: and every single client said the same thing.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_01: How do I delegate counter?
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_01: How do I delegate inbox?
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_01: And so it became clear we need to invest more
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_01: in actually teaching the clients.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_01: How to delegate because that is as much of a constraint
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_01: as the assistants and we've got a few thousand
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_01: assistants and clients.
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_01: And if you look at the best performing assistants
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_01: at Athena, they work for the best delegators.
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_01: It's not a coincidence.
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_01: The reason they're the best is because someone has figured out
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_01: how to export their ideas, decompose, project,
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_01: create SOPs in a way that helps the assistant fly
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_01: and the more mediocre delegators
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_01: struggle with that and need more training.
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_00: One thing that you've been phenomenal at
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_00: is whether it's some type of career thing,
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_00: is hiring executives.
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_00: What do you think that you do differently
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_00: or what are the principles or frameworks
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_00: that really guide your sort of exact hiring process?
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_00: I mean, one thing that is obvious
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_01: as you hire executives is the more senior they go,
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_01: the better they hire interviewing,
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_01: and almost by definition, and so when you get to see sweet,
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_01: they all are really good at interviewing.
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_01: And so you actually have to discard the interview
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_01: more the more senior they go.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_01: And so I use references much more the higher you go.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_01: And then the other thing that I think is interesting
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_01: that people should do more of is I just ask people
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_01: for their 360 reviews.
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_01: Like at their last company,
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_01: 10 people wrote reviews of them that are honest
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_01: about their strengths and weaknesses,
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_01: and I just asked to see it.
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_01: And I say, hey, I'll share mine, you show me yours.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_01: I actually think this would be a cool kind of reference
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_01: to start up where you could ping the L.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_01: I'm about someone versus pinging their references.
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_01: So I try to get to more ground truth on the person
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_01: versus the UX of interview is just gonna be pretty good
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_01: when you get to the senior level.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_01: What's most important when you're doing reference checks,
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_00: what's the way to get the most signal out of them?
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_00: I mean, what I often tell people is,
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_01: hey, I'm probably gonna hire this person
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_01: and now tell me all the things you don't like about them
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_01: or things that they could be better at.
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_01: Cause if people are so biased to just tell you
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_01: all the good things, you have to get them to see it
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_01: as a safe place to share strengths and weaknesses.
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_01: And yeah, just do enough references
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_01: until they start to sound the same.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_01: And once they start to sound the same,
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_01: then you've got a signal.
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, one question I like to ask is,
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_00: what skill sets would be really important
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_00: to complement this person with?
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_00: It was another way of just saying,
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_00: what are they bad?
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_00: Like, what's really important?
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_00: Or one of my questions is,
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_00: if this didn't work out in six months or a year,
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_00: why would that be?
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_01: And I mean, the best way to source talent
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_01: is hired and executive recently.
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_01: Just ask the people that you respect the most,
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_01: they have the highest standards, who's the best person.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_01: So like, here's the three people who have the highest
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_01: standards in this role.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_01: I ask them for the two or three best people
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_01: and I go try to hire one of them.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_01: And that is the like speed rapid way to hire and executive.
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_01: You know, using an exec recruiter, you spend three months,
[00:30:28] SPEAKER_01: you get all this cold leads,
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_01: but going through a network of high bar people
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_01: is super efficient.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_00: There's some maximum that almost like half of executives,
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_00: you know, don't work out within like, you know,
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_00: 12 to 20 point months.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_00: Check it out.
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_00: Why is that?
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_00: I think it's this, it's difficult to judge.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_01: The interview process is not representative
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_01: of the work they're doing.
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: And that's ultimately what's broken about interviewing
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_01: is interviewing should be someone doing the work
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: they're gonna do.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_01: And it was like, weably back in the day
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: we would actually have execs come work for two weeks
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_01: to trial before they ever hired.
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_01: That's difficult to pull off
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_01: because people have other jobs.
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_01: But I do think something like that makes a lot of sense.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_01: Your interview process is just kind of irrelevant
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_01: compared to what the work they're doing in lots of places.
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_00: And Keith has this maximum that that's like,
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_00: you're not gonna get 100% hiring in the same way.
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_00: You're not gonna get 100% investing.
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_00: And if, you know, like you also want to avoid the,
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm not the trap of not taking enough risk
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_00: or moving just low.
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And as long as you cut your losses quickly,
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_01: it's okay.
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_01: If you like don't cut losses, then you come pound a hole.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: And that's where it's painful.
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_01: The other thing I'd say is more useful
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_01: for basically all interview process is project-based work.
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_01: So just like, you know, hiring a C suite for one part,
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_01: one part of the team, I just tell them
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_01: what the pain points in the org are and what I wanna fix.
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, come up with a plan.
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_01: How would you fix us?
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_01: If you, we hire you, you're gonna do it.
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_01: And that sort of practical work is more useful.
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. That's very interesting.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_00: What, going back to other sort of founder principles,
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_00: what is your stance on transparency with the company?
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_00: Like what's information that's helpful,
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_00: maybe go back to thumbtack days,
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_00: what's helpful for the company to,
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_00: to employs to know, like what are principles,
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_00: like the guide, you know, how much you share?
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, default transparency is obviously the best,
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_01: but there's obviously some lines.
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_01: There's a, and out, at thumbtack, there was a moment,
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_01: you may remember this decade ago,
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_01: where I woke up and I had a message from someone
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_01: on our team in the Philippines and said,
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_01: thumbtack does not exist on the internet.
[00:32:43] I was like, what?
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_01: And I went to Google, you type in thumbtack and nothing shows up.
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_01: And we basically received the death penalty from Google.
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_01: There was a misunderstanding,
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_01: they thought we'd done something wrong,
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_01: but they like, eliminate us from the internet.
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_01: And so our traffic went to zero.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: And our revenue went to zero.
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_01: And I remember waking up and like, I go to the office
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_01: and there's a class of 25 new thumbtackers
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_01: who is their first day.
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_01: And so it's the do the onboarding with them.
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_01: There's a journalist like walking around outside,
[00:33:11] SPEAKER_01: trying to get a quote.
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, that's one of those times
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_01: where you can't share everything.
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_01: And so you want to ultimately be transparent,
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_01: but if I just walked into a new class and say,
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_01: business might be dead, it's not going to work.
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_01: And so you have to kind of get a handle the situation,
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_01: you know, the people who need to know it, know it.
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_01: And then once there's a plan and a solution in place,
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_01: then the whole company is told.
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_00: At thumbtack, you were a non-CEO co-founder
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: and you lasted, you know, a decade or almost a decade.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_00: And you're still on the board, of course.
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_00: I feel like it's pretty rare when I think about
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_00: co-founding teams that, it feels like the non-CEO,
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_00: especially if not at a CTO,
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_00: usually that doesn't last, you know, over five years or something.
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_00: I'm curious what's really important to get right
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_00: in co-founder relationships or how you think about
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_00: advising companies that you invest in.
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I heard Sir Michael at Sequoia say something
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_01: that was like, there's only one founder.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_01: And he said it at a founder event.
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, I was rude.
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_01: There's lots of co-founders here.
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_01: And now a decade later, I'm like, of course,
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_01: there is only one co-founder that goes to distance
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: because ultimately, as you scale the org,
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_01: it only makes sense to have one person on top.
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_01: So I think that's just the reality.
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, it's good to know that going
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_01: on to start a business.
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_01: In terms of who to pick, my advice is you pick someone
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_01: you want to get married to.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_01: And you're going to have all the same relationship issues
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_01: you have with a partner, you know, no makeup sex,
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_01: but it's still like, yeah, there's highs lows.
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_01: And you want someone that ultimately,
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_01: you really, deeply trust because there's going to be stress
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_01: and challenges.
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_01: But as long as you trust the foundation,
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_01: then you got a good thing to build on.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_01: I'd say, you know, one of the biggest,
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_01: or if I called him steak at Thumbtack,
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_01: because I love my founders, but it's something
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't recommend others do, is we had four co-founders.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_01: And one was technical.
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_01: We left after like two years.
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_01: And then the other three were non-technical.
[00:35:20] SPEAKER_01: This is like the most idiotic way to start a technology
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_01: business, but we had no idea we were doing.
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, we worked out.
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_01: And how did you define and conquer
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_01: between those three non-technical?
[00:35:31] We just kind of jumped on things as like,
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_01: whoever was good at something, we do it.
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_01: But it was not like clear executive.
[00:35:38] Yeah. And I think that's, you know,
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: it's not recommended, because there's like,
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_01: it's obvious how that could create tension.
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_01: We worked through it, but that's why it's non-standard.
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_01: Not best practice.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_00: But I'm going back to the original story,
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_00: because I remember there's this,
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: you got into GSB and you were going to graduate school,
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_00: but you had your buddies from college
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_00: and you were thinking of starting this business,
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_00: which wasn't even like a personal pain point.
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_00: You just thought it'd be a good business.
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_00: And you emailed the, you know,
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_00: you let the GSB people know you weren't going to accept it.
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_00: And they sent you back this very moralizing email
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_00: about how you're making the biggest mistake in your life.
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_00: It said, you know, it turned out pretty good.
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_00: But how do you, pretty good decision?
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_00: How did you, at the time, think about
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_00: get enough conviction to take the leap and do it?
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I was scary.
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_01: I got into, you know, this good school.
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_01: Seemed like that was a safe bet.
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_01: I knew I wanted to start a business.
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, if I went to business school,
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: I knew that I'd have all this debt.
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_01: I probably might need to get a nice paying job afterwards.
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_01: And if I was going to go for it,
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_01: I should probably just go for it.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_01: But yeah, when the dean sent me that email,
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_01: it's like, this is biggest mistake in your life.
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_01: I just said something like,
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_01: you can start up, we'll come and go,
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_01: but you can only come to Stanford once or something.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_01: This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_01: I never responded.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_01: And I have it as an email in my,
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_01: this save that I'm just going to respond to
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_01: whenever some tech goes public and be like,
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_01: I made the right decision.
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_01: And I have nothing against this guy.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_01: He's just doing his job,
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_01: but it's good to have a little,
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: just on your shoulder.
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, totally.
[00:37:21] Okay, so there's EAs and then there's chief of staffs.
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_00: How should we think about sort of the difference there?
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_00: And what's really important to get right in chiefs?
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_00: I have his role at everyone in addition to EA wishes they had.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_00: But seems hard to find the right person.
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there's no formal definition.
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_01: I think it's something that an EAs typically more
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_01: administrative and taking things off your plate.
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_01: And chief of staff is more offensive.
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_01: And that's the type of person who can
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_01: follow you into meetings.
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_01: You could deploy to, hey, like,
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_01: actually take this meeting for me or,
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_01: hey, this problem came up today.
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_01: Go figure out how to solve it.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_01: And so a chief of staff typically has the capabilities
[00:38:00] SPEAKER_01: to become a founder themselves.
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_01: And the only reason they take the job as chief of staff
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_01: is so they can see what it's like to be a founder
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_01: so they can go off to do it.
[00:38:08] SPEAKER_01: So you kind of get people who do more tours of duty
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_01: and you get super high capability.
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_01: But you don't get the same longevity as a assistant.
[00:38:18] What have you looked for in chiefs that?
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_00: Or what sort of the right, you know,
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_00: there's sort of the tension between, you know,
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_00: getting someone younger who's, you know,
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_00: definitely initially going to do it for a couple of years.
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_00: And is more ambitious versus someone who's been more seasoned.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: But maybe not as high slow percent.
[00:38:34] SPEAKER_00: What, how do you think about it?
[00:38:36] SPEAKER_01: The way I break it down is assistant,
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_01: you find someone you want to go a decade with.
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_01: The intimacy and the compound, you know,
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_01: that relationship is super important.
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_01: And so you go deep.
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_01: And that means you probably don't find a founder
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_01: because they're not going to be excited to do this.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_01: It's someone who's much more of a caretaker
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_01: and is excited to be number two.
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_01: And then a chief of staff, I do pure slope
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_01: where you know the person is going to move on in a couple years.
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_01: But they have, yeah, they could start a business.
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_01: But instead you get them by your side to help solve problems.
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_01: And there are people like Lon's Dale,
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_00: maybe like a lot or something who have, you know,
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_00: chief of staff for like a year or two
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_00: and then they start a company and then they invest in them.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_00: They build kind of this reputation for doing.
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_00: And then they have sort of these like, you know,
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_00: alumni, almost a chief of staff,
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_00: just kind of, you know, Peter Teales
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: or just kind of further.
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Bezos has someone follow some around.
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_01: It goes to every meeting and yeah, it's cool.
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_01: Let's talk about some, some people who get an enormous amount done.
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_00: And I'm curious what are the lessons that we can draw for them.
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_00: Whether it's someone like Lon's Dale,
[00:39:38] SPEAKER_00: whether it's someone like Elon,
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_00: whether it's someone like Sam Altman,
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: who are folks that you've particularly learned something from,
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_00: even just watching from afar of like,
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_00: how do they build their world?
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_00: How do they operate?
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_00: I'll just say one for someone like Lon's Dale Teales
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_00: done this really well.
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_00: They sort of compound these certain talent networks
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_00: to, you know, where it's like Stanford Review
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_00: or just Stanford in general.
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_00: They're often hiring people from there
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_00: and then involved in sort of these talent pipelines.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_00: They've sort of, you know, created, you know,
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_00: they're deep in the hackathon scene.
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_00: But they just kind of build this proprietary compounding
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_00: sort of talent base that they're constantly, you know, sort of.
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the talent access is part of it.
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_01: I think the other thing is there are some people
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_01: who have just limitless ambition.
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_01: And you're very much this way of like,
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_01: well, what if I could do 10 times more things?
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_01: And I think lots of people just think that's impossible.
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_01: But it's not, it is possible.
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_01: And with delegation and empowerment,
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_01: you can just keep compounding bigger and bigger scale.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_01: The other thing that's interesting that we've seen
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_01: from working with these like power delegators is
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_01: people assume that people of great power, wealth
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_01: or resources can afford this team.
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_01: And then that is why they have this ambition.
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_01: But we've actually seen the opposite is the case
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_01: as people get more leverage with assistant,
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_01: their ambition increases.
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_01: And it's difficult to have big ambition.
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_01: If you're just weighed down by DMV forms and passports,
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_01: but once that's off your plate,
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_01: then you raise your sights and you can be more ambitious.
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, then you go from assistant to achieve a staff
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_01: and you just keep leveling up to, you know,
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_01: until your monstail or the president.
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_01: I think another thing I admire about some of these people
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_00: is they, you know, they hold remarkably few grudges.
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, apparently, you know, Peter Tio,
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_00: like kicked Elon out of PayPal or something.
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_00: Or, you know, like a lot of these people
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_00: have had beefs, you know, decades ago.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_00: And yet he ended up funding his next company.
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_00: And so people have very short memories
[00:41:42] SPEAKER_00: if someone, you know, mistreats them or something.
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_00: Or they make a mistake or something.
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_00: They're quick to reconcile and just do business again over, yeah.
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, look what a president of Vance said
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_01: about President Trump before the department.
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_01: Is this, yeah.
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_01: I think there is a...
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_00: Trump is actually quite forgiving.
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_00: A lot of people say a lot about things about him.
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_00: And he'll continue to work with them
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_00: as long as they change their mind.
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think there's just a desire to win at all costs.
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_01: And, yeah, grudges are not helpful.
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Trump and Elon, right.
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_00: You're getting into it and, you know, reconciling.
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_00: It's a, you know, DVD where it's gassed
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_00: by the five times it comes out.
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_00: And then there are some people who seem to have pretty,
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_00: like, you know, Bill Gates has like, you know,
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_00: pretty big team, pretty big operation.
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_00: But then it seemed like Bayzos and Elon
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_00: maybe have like, pretty lean team.
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm curious how you think about sort of...
[00:42:32] I mean, Elon's the one that makes no sense.
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_01: It's, he claims and not having assistant
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_01: and to be like scheduling staff.
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_01: There's a story of Bill Gates being like,
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_01: trying to schedule a meeting with Elon.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_01: He's like, connect me with your assistant
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_01: and he lines like, no, I am my assistant.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_01: It's, I hardly believe it, but Elon's just insane.
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: So maybe he is that way.
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_01: I think most normal humans, if you want to get leverage,
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_01: you have to, darling.
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_01: I mean, one of the cool personal teams I saw
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_01: is this guy who's a billionaire.
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_01: He runs this hedge fund and he has a team of 40.
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_01: He has eight personal executive assistants,
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_01: all of the executive assistants graduate from Princeton,
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_01: insanely high bar.
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_01: And I was asking this woman who managed the EA team,
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_01: like, how do you decide what to prioritize your team on?
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_01: And she's like, if my team can spend one day
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_01: saving my principal one minute, it's well worth our time.
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, that is so next level.
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_01: And definitely like, that's something I would love
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_01: to aspire to, but it's just, you know,
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_01: the, the, the billionaire budget.
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_00: Also just in terms of prioritizing, like,
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_00: you know, we're hiring, you know, assistants here
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_00: and someone's saying, oh, you know,
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_00: do you want them to be in all meetings with you?
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, well, if they're in meetings with me,
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_00: then they're not working.
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_00: Like, I want them to be like, you know,
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_00: finding ways to give me leverage and team things off my plate.
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_00: I mean, this is one of our visions.
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_01: A, a, a theme is that you kind of digital assistants
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_01: that listen to you and work with you and are connected
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_01: to your zoom and your inbox and your calendar
[00:44:03] SPEAKER_01: and can be mining all of that digital exhaust
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_01: for things your assistant should work on.
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_01: And so, I mean, your assistant can't possibly sit
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_01: in every meeting if they're going to do anything,
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_01: but if the digital, the machine assistants are surveying
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_01: and pulling things out, that's a pretty cool combination.
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think it's interesting to look at how people build out
[00:44:21] SPEAKER_00: their, you know, like, for example, you know,
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_00: Mark and Ben funnel everything through Acing and Z
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_00: and are all in an Acing Z and of course have, you know,
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_00: other intellectual or philanthropic interests,
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_00: but mostly it's like, installed it.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_00: Whereas someone like Peter Tio has this,
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_00: he sort of fragments it a bit more, you know, like,
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_00: you know, founders von, but then others, several other,
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_00: you know, myth world, several other funds,
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_00: other company, all sorts of like initiatives
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_00: that are, you know, somewhat collaborative,
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_00: but independent.
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_00: And he says on top, but also it seems like he lets them,
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_00: you know, he's not like CEO of them.
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_00: And he's got this sort of talent, you know, network
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_00: that he's worked with for a long time,
[00:45:08] SPEAKER_00: that kind of like, you know, goes in almost boomerangs
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_00: across the universe.
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_00: Lon'sdale feels like he's more, he's got the ABC universe
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_00: but then his other initiative, he's like,
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_00: quick to institutionalize something,
[00:45:24] SPEAKER_00: whether it's like a think tank or like, you know,
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_00: it's no coincidence that, you know, Peter Tio would do
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_00: the sort of Tio fellowship and Lon'sdale
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_00: create a university or something.
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_00: Tio is almost like early to stuff.
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_00: He creates a format for something, a template,
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_00: you know, he does the hard work of sort of, you know,
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_00: field building into like, you know,
[00:45:43] SPEAKER_00: doing something that's in a controversial space
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_00: where it's longevity or charter cities
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_00: or, you know, higher education.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_00: And then, you know, people like Lon'sdale,
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_00: institutionalize it to some degree.
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_00: And then, yeah, Elon, you know, it's been described
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_00: also has this like SWAT team, you know,
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_00: of people that help him from company to company
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_00: and he's just able to recruit, you know,
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_00: world-class people to lead these efforts.
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think it comes, it's like,
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_01: what's the right org structure?
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_01: There's actually no right org structure.
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_01: It's, what's the right org structure for you as a founder?
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, Mark Andrej said
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_01: in Ben Horowitz, our company builders.
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_01: And so they're building their leverage like a company,
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_01: the A6 and Z as a company.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: Not that Peter Tio is not an entrepreneur,
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_01: but he's more of a philosopher today.
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_01: And so his system is more like a philosopher.
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_01: So all these kind of wild and crazy ideas.
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_01: And so I think, you know,
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_01: Jensen Huang has like 46 direct reports or something,
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_01: which is absolutely insane, but it works for him.
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_01: And so I think you just have to know
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_01: what your style is and then you build it for you.
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_00: Totally.
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_00: And someone like Sam Alman is like a deal maker
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_00: and a fundraiser and a talent identifier.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_00: And so he's able to, like I remember he was at YC
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_00: and he was talking to one of my friends
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_00: about sort of this universal basic income company.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_00: My friend didn't end up doing it.
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, oh, that's interesting.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_00: Why is he even doing that?
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_00: He's like focused on YC.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_00: And he's like, he has a knack for good ideas.
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_00: He has a knack for, and this person was like 22.
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_00: He has a knack for, you know, high slope talent.
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_00: And he has a superpower around raising money.
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I think new founders
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_01: or at least me as a new founder was like,
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_01: okay, what are my weaknesses and how do I get better at them?
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_01: But then a second time founder is like,
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_01: forget about my weaknesses.
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_01: I'm just not gonna try.
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_01: I'm just gonna be really good at my strengths.
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_01: And I'm gonna hire other people to do all the things
[00:47:34] SPEAKER_01: I'm not good at.
[00:47:34] SPEAKER_01: And that is way more effective.
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, totally.
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_00: The, there used to be this sort of skepticism of like,
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_00: hey, you can't really, and this is actually,
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_00: you can't really incubate companies, like,
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_00: the CEO has to be the founder and they have to drive it to,
[00:47:48] SPEAKER_00: where do you stand on, on kind of that debate?
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_01: I think the biggest companies aren't incubated
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_01: because the biggest companies have a founder
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_01: who is Monomeniaco from the beginning
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_01: and compounds it for 50 years.
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_01: And that's not incubation.
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_01: Incubation is kind of, let me try a bunch of thing.
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_01: It's not this Monomeniaco power law commitment.
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_01: So if you're just trying to build a trillion dollar business,
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_01: I think that's not the way to do it.
[00:48:13] SPEAKER_01: Well, look, if you like, you know,
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_01: we have a mutual friend who likes to remain anonymous,
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_01: who incubates lots of companies
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_01: and he launches four companies a year
[00:48:21] and he loves doing it
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_01: and he's gonna make a ton of money doing it.
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_01: And that's just his style.
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_01: He's not gonna probably have trillion dollar businesses,
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_01: but he's gonna have 50, you know,
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_01: 100 million dollar businesses,
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_01: which is still incredible.
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think one bookcase is more of it's like,
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_00: breeding, like, you know,
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_00: Sam Alman in some sense, he incubated OpenAI
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_00: and that it wasn't the main thing he was working on.
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_00: But then once he identified that it could be,
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_00: you know, this massive opportunity
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_00: then went all in all with it.
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it means more like a venture portfolio.
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, there's probably a bunch of stuff
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_01: Peter Teal has done that we don't even remember
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_01: because he's studying and things like that
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: because they just disappear into the ether
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_01: and then things that work compound.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_01: And so, I mean, here are the resources to launch
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_01: 10 new things and then just double down on the one thing
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_01: that's big every year.
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_01: That's a cool approach.
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_00: I get to go, Mark and Jason wrote this blog post
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_00: on productivity and they're asking him,
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_00: you think about meetings, schedule, whatever.
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_00: And he said, you know what,
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_00: I try not to schedule things in advance
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_00: because I don't know how I'll feel next week.
[00:49:24] SPEAKER_00: And I want to kind of want to do things like inflow.
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_00: And so when, you know, people are trying to get my time,
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_00: what I typically say is like call me right now
[00:49:32] SPEAKER_00: or feel free to check in next week
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_00: and we'll see how I feel.
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_00: And it kind of is like better aligned
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_00: with sort of the flow state.
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_00: And I mean, that's the ultimate flex.
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_00: As like if you can pull that off,
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_01: that is definitely the ultimate way to live.
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_01: As you just work on whatever you want.
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_01: The world opens up to you, you call.
[00:49:53] SPEAKER_01: Obviously, it's hard for most immortals to pull off.
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_01: But yeah, if you can get to that level,
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_01: that is the dream.
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_00: So then I was for certain, you know,
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_00: meetings that we were people with cold,
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: reaching out or whatever, I was kind of trying.
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_00: It's like, I always anticipate that in a few more days,
[00:50:10] SPEAKER_00: I'll be like, busier than I am or something.
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_00: Or I'll have, whereas like right now,
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_00: yeah, I got time to do a call.
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_00: But so I tried that a little bit
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_00: and then I mark did a follow up interview
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_00: with someone asked him about that.
[00:50:21] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_00: And he's like, oh, you know, that didn't work.
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_00: Like I tried that didn't work.
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_00: Now I'm just scheduled.
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_00: Just back to back all day.
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, oh god damn it.
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_00: You've been doing that.
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_00: And it's, but he's, you know,
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_00: he's also mastered multitasking.
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I think people just, the thing I think you can learn
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_01: from Mark and other people is just challenge the defaults
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_01: occasionally.
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_01: And if you're in back to back means all the time,
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_01: try this other system and see, see if it works.
[00:50:50] SPEAKER_01: I think most people just go with the flow.
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_01: I think other things, most people aren't vicious enough
[00:50:55] SPEAKER_01: at saying no.
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_01: And just being super hardcore is like,
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_01: is that conference you're going to matter?
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_01: Is that random get to know you chat, mean, anything?
[00:51:04] SPEAKER_01: I think you just say no to most things.
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_01: You know, I've back in the Uber versus Lyft,
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_01: really scaling war days.
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_01: I remember emailing Logan a question,
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_01: probably to come to one of our dinners.
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_01: And he just responded war mode.
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_01: And I love that.
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, well, most people should actually
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_01: be in war mode like 90% of the time.
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_01: And that same, yeah, hardcoreness is just like,
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_01: the right would operate.
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_01: What have you learned in your extensive founder career
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_00: about managing your own psychology, dealing with stress,
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_00: dealing with the cognitive dissonance of having to present
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_00: externally, like things are amazing even when you're
[00:51:49] SPEAKER_00: concerned about Google taking out your business?
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_00: What advice might you have for others
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_00: in terms of cultivating this?
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_00: I think it's like a cold plunge or something.
[00:52:00] SPEAKER_01: It's just shock therapy.
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_01: And eventually, it's just like you're
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_01: bathing in an existential fear all the time.
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_01: And you're like, whatever.
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_01: Let's bring it on totally.
[00:52:11] I don't think there's much other than knowing
[00:52:13] SPEAKER_01: that it's going to happen.
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_01: There's going to be tons of ups and downs.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_01: And one of the clear lessons from Thumbtack, which
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_01: is now scaled and done so well, was that there
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_01: was lots of near misses where we almost died times where
[00:52:25] SPEAKER_01: we thought it wasn't going to work.
[00:52:27] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, you just got to stay in the game.
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_01: And if you can stay in the game, you can eventually win.
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_01: And I think Thumbtack was very good at staying
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_01: the game so that we can eventually win.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_00: It's funny.
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_00: There's degrees of panic in the beginning.
[00:52:42] SPEAKER_00: You're getting your feet wet.
[00:52:42] SPEAKER_00: It's like, oh my god, someone said something
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_00: mean about me on the internet.
[00:52:45] SPEAKER_00: And then it's like, oh my god, someone
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_00: wants to leave my company.
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_00: And then it's like, oh my god, we might die.
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_00: It's like six months of payroll.
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_00: Then it's like, oh my shit, we're going to get sued.
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_00: Well, it's like the first time you get sued or you're
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_01: worried about getting sued.
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_01: And then eventually you have a board meeting.
[00:53:05] SPEAKER_01: And there's just a list of lawsuits.
[00:53:07] SPEAKER_01: And it's just you review them quarterly.
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_01: And it's just like, that's actually what success is.
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_01: It's like, you're going to have that stuff constantly.
[00:53:13] SPEAKER_01: And it becomes, yeah, it just borrowed a business.
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_01: And you just keep building up more capacity
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_00: to handle these things.
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_00: And they just go.
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and it's where I think co-founders are the best.
[00:53:26] SPEAKER_01: This is like, it's the people you can be totally
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_01: up and with and be like, well, that's
[00:53:29] SPEAKER_01: situations after.
[00:53:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_01: And someone you can trust and totally be on the ups and downs
[00:53:35] SPEAKER_01: with.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_01: Let's go to Athena.
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_00: Let's go where we started, which is sort of the intersection
[00:53:38] SPEAKER_00: between humans and AI.
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_00: How have you thought about building
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_00: Athena given sort of developments in AI?
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_00: What does that mean for you?
[00:53:47] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:53:48] SPEAKER_01: Athena started fully bootstrapped.
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_01: Human only scaled to 1,000 people, not like capital.
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_01: Then we had this AI moment a few years ago.
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_01: And it was clear we could make a big AI play.
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_01: And this could become a generational business,
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_01: or we could get railroaded by AI.
[00:54:06] SPEAKER_01: And so only one option there is go big.
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_01: And our vision here is this is you take the best of the human
[00:54:13] SPEAKER_01: and best of the machine, wrap it into one unified product.
[00:54:16] SPEAKER_01: And what the machine does will increase over time, just
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_01: like a self-driving car.
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_01: And so the humans, the UX, it's
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_01: on top.
[00:54:24] SPEAKER_01: It will become more the human assistant will focus more
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_01: on project management and high level work,
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_01: and really be that caretaker, the empathy, that partner.
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_01: And the machine will increasingly
[00:54:35] SPEAKER_01: do the more row mechanical administrative stuff.
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_01: And just as when you get into a Tesla, Elon made them
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_01: with wheels.
[00:54:45] SPEAKER_01: Or with steering wheels, so you could drive them
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_01: because they don't drive themselves when you started.
[00:54:49] SPEAKER_01: But every time you get in the car,
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_01: you're actually teaching the machine how to drive.
[00:54:53] SPEAKER_01: And these models don't generalize well.
[00:54:56] SPEAKER_01: You have to bring edge cases under distribution.
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_01: And so every time you drive, the model gets more powerful.
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_01: And the same is true in executive assistant,
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_01: our humans are driving.
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_01: They're doing the tasks.
[00:55:08] SPEAKER_01: But we're building machine models that
[00:55:10] SPEAKER_01: are being improved by the way they act.
[00:55:13] SPEAKER_01: And so the more your assistant does task for you,
[00:55:17] SPEAKER_01: the more models will improve.
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_01: And I'll allow the human to upgrade what they work on
[00:55:21] SPEAKER_01: tomorrow, high leverage stuff.
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_00: That's exciting.
[00:55:25] SPEAKER_00: So what else can you share about plugs for the company
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_00: or things to watch out for, or for people who
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_00: want to get assistance?
[00:55:33] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_01: I just say, if you don't have an assistant,
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_01: you are the assistant.
[00:55:36] SPEAKER_01: Step one, if you're starting a business,
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_01: you should hire a assistant.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: And if you've got 20 bucks a month, you should chat GPT.
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_01: If you've got 10 bucks an hour, go on to Upwork
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_01: and hire someone yourself.
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_01: If you hire someone yourself, I would say my main recommendation
[00:55:51] SPEAKER_01: is you need to interview a lot of people.
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_01: Athena, we have 50,000 assistants apply per month.
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_01: And we put them through a huge battery of tests.
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_01: And we hire like one in 300.
[00:56:02] SPEAKER_01: So if you're going to hire on yourself,
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_01: make sure you interview not 10, but probably like 50 people.
[00:56:07] SPEAKER_01: If you have the resources for $3,000 a month,
[00:56:10] SPEAKER_01: then you should work with a company like Athena, who
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_01: can recruit, train, manage, and teach you how to delegate.
[00:56:16] SPEAKER_01: And then when you have the resources for an in-person
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_01: assistant, 150 K a year, you should do that as well.
[00:56:23] SPEAKER_01: And then ultimately, when you get later stage,
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_01: you have a chief of staff, in-person assistant,
[00:56:27] SPEAKER_01: and a fleet of Athena assistants in the cloud.
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's a great overview.
[00:56:32] SPEAKER_01: Well, let's wrap on that.
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_01: Awesome.
[00:56:34] SPEAKER_00: Awesome.
[00:56:35] I'm going to podcast.
[00:56:35] I'm going to do a lot of work.
[00:56:37] I'm going to do a lot of work.
[00:56:39] I'm going to do a lot of work.
[00:56:41] I'm going to do a lot of work.
[00:56:43] I'm going to do a lot of work.

[00:56:55] I'm going to do a lot of work.
[00:56:57] I'm going to do a lot of work.
[00:56:59] I'm going to do a lot of work.
[00:57:01] I'm going to do a lot of work.
