[00:00:00] Right now, AI is just a nap on your phone.
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_04: It should not be that way.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_04: Sometimes you need to sort of go big or go home.
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_04: Not having the balls to do that, especially in this current environment.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_04: You can suffer the consequences.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_04: There's a huge mind trap that exists among builders in the space
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_04: where they somehow think that voice is the main interface.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_04: That's because they are somehow thinking about the movie
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_04: horror all the time, but not in the right way.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_04: So you were true pioneer in the space,
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_02: but before everyone else was doing it,
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_02: maybe just talk about your reflections of how that category has,
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_02: as you helped create it and then how it's evolved.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_02: It definitely evolved.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_03: I have noticed.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_03: It's really crazy.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_03: We had a very strong belief that it would happen,
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_04: but we still were so surprised when it actually happened again.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_04: This was just, it just still felt like complete magic.
[00:00:54] To Jenna, excited to get into everything you're doing with Wabi,
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_02: but first let's contextualize this a little bit.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_02: When you look back at sort of the arc of your career
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: perhaps the last decade,
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_02: how do you contextualize what is the through line,
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_02: you know, through replica, Wabi, etc.
[00:01:08] Oh, that's a, that's a hard question.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_04: But I guess the,
[00:01:13] maybe the main theme is we're always early.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_04: Sometimes a little bit too early.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_04: Sometimes hopefully this time around, you know,
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_04: or the right, the right kind of early,
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_04: the right type of early,
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_04: but generally, yeah, I've started working on AI in 2012.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_04: So over a decade ago,
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_04: and was always fascinated by kind of the idea
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_04: that you'll be able to talk to,
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_04: to a machine, to have a good conversation,
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_04: meaningful conversation with a machine,
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_04: but more importantly, with the fact that,
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_04: that could influence your life in a really good way.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_04: And before that was really,
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_04: the focus was on DJI Companions,
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_04: say, friends that could really be there for you
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_04: and help you live a better life,
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_04: help you feel better.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_04: And now I guess it's just the same idea,
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_04: but applied to personal software.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_04: Like can we build many apps or software
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_04: that will really help us throughout the day
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_04: in a very personal way,
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_04: and will be focused on you,
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_04: on helping you live a better life?
[00:02:12] To trace the journey of how you got excited
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_02: about this new category,
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_02: and what you hope it becomes.
[00:02:19] I guess while running replica,
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_04: we always had these conversations with our users,
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_04: about what other products they use and how they use AI.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_04: And it always struck me as strange,
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_04: that they weren't using products like Tragic Tee
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_04: or Gemini Cloud,
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_04: but really they were mostly using it
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_04: for very simple use cases,
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_04: like they were using Tragic Tee to just,
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_04: for search or to help them write something,
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_04: help with homework or something else.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_04: And no one was really mentioning
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_04: any of these exciting capabilities
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_04: that we just kept seeing the models get.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_04: And so we felt like there might be an interface problem.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_04: When people look at a command line or a chatbot,
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_04: they really just see search, writing tool,
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_04: maybe I can talk to this,
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_04: but if you think about that's the affordance of a command line,
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_04: like not really these are the main use cases.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_04: I think even recently Tragic Tee,
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_04: OpenAI published one of those research,
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_04: one of those studies showing that these are,
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_04: in fact, the main use cases for Tragic Tee,
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_04: I think a third of all all of the use was around writing,
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_04: a writing help.
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_04: And so that gave us an idea
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_04: that there should be some next interface.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_04: There should be something else on top of this.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_04: There should be something more interactive, visual,
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_04: simple for everyone being included,
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_04: to actually discover these amazing use cases
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_04: that all these models already have.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_04: And so we started thinking,
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_04: we got obsessed with this metaphor
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_04: that the current chatbots are really the Microsoft DOS era
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_04: for AI interfaces,
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_04: and that there will be some sort of a Windows macOS moment.
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_04: And I think the confusing part for most people is that
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_04: there is so much traction with the chatbots anyway,
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_04: almost a billion people using these AI tools already,
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_04: but they only use them for these kind of simpler use cases.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_04: And in order to unlock something else,
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_04: you need a more exciting interface.
[00:04:17] Paint more picture of what the world will look like
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_02: when this Windows or macOS moment happened.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_02: What will that look like?
[00:04:23] Well, I do think right now we exist in the paradigm
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_04: of when I was growing up, we had TV,
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_04: and here you had maybe a few dozen TV channels,
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_04: back in Russia we only had six TV channels.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_04: And so then of course, now TV still exists,
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_04: but when now we watch YouTube and Reels and TikTok,
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_04: a lot of UGC stuff.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_04: And so I think the same will happen with software.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_04: Right now we're kind of stuck in this world
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_04: where these few apps developed by professional developers,
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_04: and then eventually of course we're gonna move on
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_04: to this new world where apps are built by all of us
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_04: for all of us, and maybe sometimes by AI for us.
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_04: So if you think about it, the operating system of the future,
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_04: you open it up and you see your regular popular apps
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_04: you use all the time, maybe it's X, maybe it's Instagram,
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_04: whatever it is.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_04: And then you see maybe some cool apps that you discovered,
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_04: your best friends using, or maybe you built for yourself,
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_04: or you tweaked one of the apps you found for yourself.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_04: And then you'll see AI suggesting some apps for you.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_04: Maybe you're going to New York next week,
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_04: and there's your into art, so it made an art show finder app
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_04: for you, which is gonna help you find art shows
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_04: around the Airbnb you're staying at.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_04: So it's a lot more flexible, malleable,
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_04: and very deeply personalized.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_04: Think of it as an operating system built on the platform
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_04: of you and not on some random fixed context.
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_04: Can you talk about that, like how we've always had this idea
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_01: that software has to be durable,
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_01: because it's really expensive to make,
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_01: and it seems really serious.
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_01: Like what types of ephemeral software
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_01: like the New York Art Gallery app do you imagine existing?
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_01: Well, so right now we're already seeing tons of,
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_04: some of our first users building very specific apps
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_04: that would never exist on the app store.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_04: They're just too small, the two personalized, too niche.
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_04: They don't have 20,000 features.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_04: Like someone built a motivational quote app
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_04: that's only pulling from one particular show
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_04: that I didn't even know anything about.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_04: But he's really obsessed with that show,
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_04: and so he just wants that at 5.30 AM when he wakes up.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_04: It's really, I feel like people are building
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_04: very particular things to fit their needs.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_04: Like right around, for example,
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_04: I was putting my kids to bed the other day,
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_04: and my daughter wants to play these puzzle games
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_04: when I tell her something,
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_04: she's trying to guess what it is.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_04: And so we built a game very quickly where it gets a puzzle,
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_04: and then she sees four pictures, she can click on one,
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_04: but she also wanted them to be about Princess Elsa
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_04: and Princess Jasmine, and so we had to incorporate that.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_04: And so now she was so happy,
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_04: because now she's doing these puzzles,
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_04: learning something new,
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_04: and then we changed it to a talent,
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_04: because she goes to an Italian preschool,
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_04: and so this is another way to practice.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_04: And she's so excited to spend the whole,
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_04: we couldn't put this thing away.
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_04: And it took me two minutes to build it,
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_04: and then a few seconds to tweak it,
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_04: versus going on the app,
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_04: start to even know if an app like that exists,
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_04: and going through 15-minute onboarding,
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_04: paying again, then it's not really what she wanted.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_04: There's no personalization there.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_04: So I think these are the use cases where something like that
[00:07:41] should happen.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_04: And I do think in the future,
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_04: I should just be able to say,
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_04: hey, I'm putting my kids to bed,
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_04: or it should know that context,
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_04: and just maybe suggest a few apps
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_04: that are already pre-built for me,
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_04: that I could use right now.
[00:07:55] It's funny, I just got a new iPhone,
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: and on the new phone,
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: I got to delete a bunch of my old apps,
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_00: because I like to start fresh.
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_00: And there were probably over a dozen apps
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: that I downloaded,
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_00: and in some cases paid for,
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_00: that I just totally didn't need anymore,
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_00: because I'd built better versions of it on lobby,
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_00: everything from migraine tracking
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: to tracking restaurant recommendations,
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_00: to a really hyper-personalized notes app,
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: to special things around image transformation
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_00: in a particular style.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: And I can imagine that will be true for a lot of people,
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_00: which is instead of having to find this long-tail app
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_00: that's running all these crazy ads,
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_00: pop-ups all the time,
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: and it's hard to use,
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: and it's not personalized to you,
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: you can just make exactly what you want on the fly,
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: and tweak it,
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: which is another really cool part of the product, I think.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_00: This is what, and I'm so glad to hear these.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_04: But for me, that was the product market fit
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_04: with Wabi for me was around that,
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_04: where I found there were a few things
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_04: I really needed one in an app for,
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_04: to track my weightlifting,
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_04: very beginner-flatlifting workouts.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_04: I just figured out you got to go up and wait.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_04: This is the one.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_04: I didn't know.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_04: I wouldn't know.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_03: A woman.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so I got this.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_04: I was tracking it in app, Apple Notes,
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_04: and I try to find some apps on the app store,
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_04: and there's just so much in these apps that I didn't need.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_04: And so I just wanted to really simple,
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_04: I'm also trying to follow one particular book.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_04: I wanted the workouts to be based on the books.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, I built a simple app to track these workouts,
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_04: and then now, anytime I go to the gym,
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_04: I built it on the way to the gym,
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_04: but now, anytime I go to the gym,
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_04: I find something else I want to add to it.
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_04: First, it was just a tracker.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_04: Now, it's generating new workouts
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_04: based on all of my inputs, where I am mad.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_04: The book I'm trying to follow,
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_04: whatever the letter, technique of progressive overload.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_04: And so I put it all in the prompt,
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_04: and every time I go to the gym,
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_04: I add a little bit to that.
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_04: I want a little more of this and a little bit of that.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_04: So now, I'm not just using the app.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_04: I'm constantly in the process of tweaking it,
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_04: and republish it to Wabi mini app store.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_04: Hopefully someone will find it useful.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_04: How many people do you think,
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_01: or generally, as you think here audience,
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_01: do you think it will be 90-10 sort of consumption creation,
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_01: or do you think that most people,
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_01: I think one of the things we saw with Sora, for example,
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_01: is that many people, the majority of people are creating,
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_01: do you think that Wabi will be like that?
[00:10:19] I hope that more people will at least tweak,
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_04: but I'd say, like, fully original creators
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_04: probably still under a 10%.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_04: And what we're working on right now,
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_04: this week we're releasing, we're pushing sort of big update,
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_04: the social graph.
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_04: So you'll be able to see who's downloading what many apps,
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_04: how they're using them.
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_04: You're going to be able to see comments or like mini apps.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_04: And so in this case, for example,
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_04: if I created that workout app,
[00:10:46] someone in comments can ask me to tweak it,
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_04: they can also remix it and change it,
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_04: obviously, change the app however they want,
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_04: but maybe they just want this particular app
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_04: to be slightly different.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_04: So they can put in comments,
[00:10:57] and maybe as a creator of course,
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_04: I'm going to be reading all the comments,
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_04: changing the app to also, for these people to be able to use it.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_04: So I think this is cool because it creates all of a sudden,
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_04: it's not just about building apps for yourself,
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_04: it's really about discovering apps
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_04: and finding what your friends are using,
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_04: using these apps together, and so on and so on,
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_04: and even asking creators to change them
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_04: in some particular way.
[00:11:22] Amazing.
[00:11:23] Zooming out a bit,
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_02: segue, a niche and justine,
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_02: how do the categories or the topics that we've been discussing
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_02: as relates to personal software relate to themes
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_02: that we've been exploring on the investing side
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_02: as it in terms of what got us excited here?
[00:11:37] Yeah, I mean, look, I think that the YouTube metaphor
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_01: is the right one that Eugenia outlined,
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: which is that we would have said in 2007
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_01: that 100 cable channels is enough or six in your case.
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_01: And now obviously there's this entire ecosystem
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_01: from everything from unboxing videos
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: to all of the very YouTube native content that exists.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_01: And I think people have more content
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_01: and are more fulfilled by it.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_01: And then there's also the active creation.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_01: Some people create for a business,
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: but many create and post just because it's fulfilling
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_01: to themselves.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_01: And software has just been so restrictive
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: because there's only 20 million developers in the world.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: So in a sense, all of the software that we consume
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_01: is downstream of the preferences of those 20 million people.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_01: And it seems intuitive that if more people could make software
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_01: they would and that there would be a mass market consumer
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: product here.
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_01: I think unlike many of the other products
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_01: and you should comment on this that we've seen,
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_01: it feels like this is not text to app.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_01: It's not a developer or developer adjacent tool.
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_01: It's truly a mass market consumer product
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_01: for non-technical people.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_04: I agree with you.
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_04: And we really made this kind of choice early on
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_04: that we're never going to show any code or anything
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_04: or say anything in the app that's even remotely technical.
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_04: No API keys, no bring this, whatever,
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_04: connect this integration or anything like that.
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_04: We do have integrations.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_04: You can add your apps and services,
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_04: but you can just say, use my Apple How to use this, use that,
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_04: or use my email.
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_04: And we call them power apps.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_04: So that's sort of more probably the most technical
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_04: you're going to get here.
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_04: But we wanted to make it super simple for anyone
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_04: to make apps and to make this process very delightful.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_04: And almost to feel like you're just creating something
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_04: really quick, you're not even building many apps.
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_04: What we're adding right now is more,
[00:13:28] I think the company of the product
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_04: we're looking at most as Canva and the ease
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_04: with which they are letting people
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_04: create beautiful presentations.
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_04: The similar kind of similar thing needs to happen here.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_04: Right now we're talking about vibe coding a lot,
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_04: but I feel like we should be more about vibe kind of taste
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_04: around or vibe designing these apps.
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_04: So we're going to give a lot more of that just visual controls.
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_04: More in the vein of like chooses style,
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_04: choose some colors.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_04: And you can go a little bit deeper,
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_04: but it really is just one button and things look great
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_04: versus, yeah, you need to go deep and just really try
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_04: to understand what to do and get technical with your mini app.
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_04: And I do think that unlocks a certain level of creativity
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_04: where all you need to think about is like, what's the use case?
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_04: One other interesting thing that one of our investors,
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_04: Solea mentioned was that apps,
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_04: many apps could become kind of community starters.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_04: So if today the app store is very much not social
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_04: and it probably won't ever be social
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_04: because of Apple's mandate for privacy
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_04: and how important that is for them, which is great.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_04: But at the same time, you probably do want to know
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_04: who else is into, I don't know, toddler activities
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_04: in Petro Hill.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_04: I want to know what other moms are going
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_04: to an Italian preschool.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_04: I want to have their kids go to that preschool.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_04: And maybe my design is really to bird watching in London
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_04: in his particular neighborhood.
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_04: So creating that app and finding some other people who could
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_04: be a little bit of a community building around the topic.
[00:15:09] Yeah, I think there's a bunch of really interesting choices
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_00: you guys made in designing the product
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_00: that it feels like really built on the explosion
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: and vibe coding or building with AI, whatever you want
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_00: to call it in a super interesting way.
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_00: One of which is for many consumers,
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_00: the existing tools are a lot more accessible
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_00: than coding something from scratch.
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: But it's still pretty easy to break them
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_00: or get to something where you don't know what to do.
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_00: Whereas I think Wabi, you've purposely put guardrails around
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_00: the experience to make it hard to super mess up,
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_00: which is actually extremely helpful for consumers.
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_00: And then it also feels like we needed to move beyond this paradigm
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_00: of great UVIB code of website and it exists out there.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: But is that the best interface for you
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_00: to be using a product you want to use daily
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: and storing personal information on
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_00: and having your own records and all of these sorts of things?
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_00: Probably not.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_00: And for a lot of people, their phone
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_00: is where they spend most of their time online.
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_00: It's their primary interface and where they want to use things.
[00:16:13] And so obviously, I know there's challenges
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_00: designing for mobile and that sort of thing.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_00: But it felt like a really smart choice
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_00: for you guys to start there just to get so much more deeply
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_00: ingrained in someone's daily life or daily workflow.
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_00: Only pretty much built mobile apps.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_04: I really like that.
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_04: Do you have mobile apps?
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_04: And a lot of things you're not going to be doing
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_04: on really just putting it in a website or whatever
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_04: some length.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_04: Exactly.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_04: And I do believe a lot in the concept of an organizational layer
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_04: like to degree the app source, the organizational layer
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_04: for the mobile and the browser, the organizational layer
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_04: for internet.
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_04: And so something like that should exist
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_04: for fight coding, I guess, or for this new era of software for AI.
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_04: Let's call it AI software.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_04: And I don't believe that people will be,
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_04: I do believe that we're all going to be building
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_04: some sort of software and using software
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_04: that everyone builds, some UGC software.
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_04: But I definitely don't believe in links
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_04: that people will share with each other
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_04: and with me relying on some random person somewhere
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_04: who's not a professional developer to support the database
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_04: for the app where I might store some sensitive data
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_04: or at least data that I don't want to disappear.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_04: And if it's not very sensitive,
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_04: and we've already seen this with some apps,
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_04: vipcoded apps reaching the top of the app store,
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_04: I think the one around women dating
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_04: that all the super sensitive information got leaked.
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_04: And that wasn't because they are bad actors,
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_04: it's just they're not professional developers.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_04: So there needs to exist some platform
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_04: where everything will live.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_04: And to the degree, we're not watching videos somewhere,
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_04: UGC videos somewhere.
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_04: We're watching them on Instagram, on TikTok, on YouTube.
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_04: It's not like people are passing around links.
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_04: And so the current situation, I do things very similar
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_04: to the very beginning of the internet
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_04: where people were creating personal pages with geo cities
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_04: and some other tools like that,
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_04: which I don't remember very, very well,
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_04: because it was very little.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_04: But yeah, before LinkedIn,
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_04: people were sending these links to each other.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_04: And of course, now there's LinkedIn.
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_04: There are certain guardrails.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_04: You can't really do everything the way you could do
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_04: in geo cities.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_04: But at the same time, you have to get the social graph,
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_04: you get the platform, you get all sorts of cool things there.
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_04: Guess the same as Shopify for e-commerce.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you can build your own online store,
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_04: but no one's really doing it anymore.
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_04: Everyone's just using Shopify.
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_04: And then they also get all the platform benefits.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_04: And I feel like the same will happen with Wabi.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_04: Yes, you cannot download an app from Wabi
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_04: and put on the app store.
[00:18:51] But you can use it inside Wabi
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_04: and you can get the social graph and all the integrations
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_04: and potentially the shared context between all the apps
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_04: and the memory behind, you know, for that user and so on and so on.
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_02: Our mutual friend,
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_02: he didn't said that Wabi is not just a collection of apps.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_02: It's a framework for memory, context and expression.
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_02: Every time you create or share,
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_02: you're teaching it who you are.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_02: Is that how you see it?
[00:19:18] I believe in it 100%.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_04: I think with every, I believe,
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_04: I still remember, of course,
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_04: and you guys obviously remember too,
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_04: but I do remember how the first iOS apps
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_04: were just people trying to squeeze those websites into an app format
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_04: or just kind of toy apps like iBeer
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_04: or those my favorite one.
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_04: I am rich.
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_04: That was $999.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_04: $99 cents and it didn't do anything.
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_04: And then of course people figured out,
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_04: well, you know, there's something special
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_04: about this being a mobile app and maybe GPS and connectivity
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_04: and things like Uber and Tinder came out
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_04: of the whole new categories of apps.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_04: And so they figured out what's so special about mobile.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_04: And I feel like for AI,
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_04: the super special thing is personalization,
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_04: but really deep personalization.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_04: So for me, kind of vibe coding an app,
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_04: but that still is sort of like the same old software
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_04: that's not really taken any of your context into consideration,
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_04: where the date of that app is not exposed to AI
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_04: that keeps learning, it's kind of just old school.
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_04: I do believe a lot in Andres,
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_04: I deal with software 3.0,
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_04: some next level of software that's super deeply personalized.
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_04: So if you think in the context of a Wabi mini app,
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_04: how can you personalize it?
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_04: First of all, you can personalize the features,
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_04: the looks, you know, where it was,
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_04: kind of the app in a certain way.
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_04: But then on top of that, you can also change the problem.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_04: So for example, for my workout app,
[00:20:45] I added to the prompt a couple of things.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_04: First of all, the book that I'm reading,
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_04: that that method that I want to work out using that method,
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_04: also the fact that I go to as a fitness
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_04: and it has a certain,
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_04: I added a photo of that gem.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_04: So kind of the model is not generating workouts
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_04: in a completely different size of the gem.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_04: It's a super exciting house to be next to each other.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_04: So this is the deep, deep, deep level of personalization
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_04: that is following.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_04: And of course, on the Wabi platform layer level,
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_04: the mini app also knows that I'm a certain age
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_04: that I live in San Francisco, that I have kids,
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_04: these are my fitness goals and so on and so on.
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_04: And then eventually when I build another mini app,
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_04: maybe around nutrition,
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_04: those apps should be able to talk and pass along that context.
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_04: And today of course, all of that exists
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_04: in just the wall gardens,
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_04: you're fully locked in in one app,
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_04: which to me, it feels absolutely crazy.
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_04: And I can't connect.
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_04: If I connected my email or my calendar,
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_04: it can be connected to both of these apps.
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_04: I have to go through the process
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_04: with every developer all the time.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_04: They have to build it.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_04: I have to connect it.
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_04: That seems crazy too.
[00:21:52] Do you imagine people building true social apps
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_01: where the in-app experience involves a community?
[00:22:00] I'd love that.
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_04: And we're building multiplayer right now
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_04: so we speak, we spend the whole day
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_04: to try to figure out what's really complex
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_04: is because all apps can have very different type
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_04: of multiplayer and that needs to be explained
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_04: to users as well in a very intuitive way.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_04: But yeah, totally believe in first of all,
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_04: using apps together at least with your friends, your family,
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_04: but also potentially building these more kind of community apps
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_04: where everyone can join.
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_04: Maybe I can make my app multiplayer
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_04: and open for everyone to join.
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_04: The good example of that is made some image-gen app
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_04: around dogs where you can turn any of your dogs
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_04: into like a royal, some usability.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_04: It's like a royal portrait of different era.
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_04: And so that would be cool for all the dog owners
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_04: to just join that app and to be able to post
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_04: to the universal feed.
[00:22:51] And so that's something we've been talking about today
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_04: because this would be really cool
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_04: as if you're just making these photos
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_04: and then sharing some word,
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_04: you're just adding them to the ongoing feed of dog photos.
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_04: Sorry.
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_04: I mean, no, no, I've been doing this for a while.
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah, I'm definitely going to use that
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_00: on my own dog.
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_00: Sure, I think.
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_00: I feel like there are so many examples, too,
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_00: of image and video prompt sharing
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_00: that happens in very unoptimized ways today.
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_00: Like I've been following a lot,
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_00: as you know, very well, like teen girls
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_00: and college-aid girls are often early adopters of stuff.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_00: And they have been making all of these like nano banana
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_00: and quen image-edit prompts of like them
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_00: like lying on a couch in the ghost face killers behind them
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_00: for like Halloween.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_00: And they'll like post the image on TikTok
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_00: or wheels or wherever and it will blow up.
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_00: And then they'll be like commenting like this long form
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_00: prompt, like in the comments on TikTok,
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_00: which makes no sense as a way to do it.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_00: And then everyone's asking like,
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_00: where do I go to do this?
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_00: Like I have the Google app.
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_00: Why isn't let me do this?
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_00: And you have to explain like, no, you need the Gemini app.
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: And it just feels like there's already this consumer demand
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_00: and consumer behavior around like prompt sharing
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_00: in particular for creative stuff that could be done.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_00: I've already made a bunch of lobby mini apps for this
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_00: and it could be done so much better.
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_00: And I think that the creative community
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_00: would really thrive with this.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_04: Oh, that was the most.
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_04: And I guess this is why we started the company.
[00:24:17] How is it possible that we have this God-like technology
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_04: yet we pass around these text prompts, which is almost
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_04: like Microsoft does commands, but worse.
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_04: Because at least the commands were sort of like,
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_04: you could learn them.
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_04: There were a few, whatever, like they were short,
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_04: they weren't that long.
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_04: And now these crazy unstructured paragraphs of text,
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_04: sometimes you also need a reference image or something else.
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_04: To me, that's a little bit crazy.
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_04: And I think that is one of the biggest problems
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_04: of discovery with AI.
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_04: It's hard to find these prompts.
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_04: Even if you saw the output of, you know,
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_04: you saw this cool photo with the ghost, whatever.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_04: But then how do I recreate that?
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_04: I need to find the prompt.
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_04: I need to know what app.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_04: I need to know what model to choose.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_04: Oftentimes it's not even very intuitive.
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_04: And at that point, I've just lost all my motivation to do that.
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_04: Instead of that, if you could just quickly, you know,
[00:25:09] click on the link and comments on TikTok and open a mini app,
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_04: where everything's already set up for you just at a photo.
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_04: And you can see examples.
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_04: You can choose different styles and this and that.
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_04: And then you can see in comments
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_04: what other people are doing.
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_04: I think this is the way to go.
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_04: And I think what's most interesting is it
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_04: sort of combines the vibe coding apps, one of the biggest,
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_04: kind of, trans of the last year at least,
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_04: and also just using AI.
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_04: Before that, it was all, you know,
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_04: it's either the, are you in the text to prompt to app market
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_04: or are you in some other market?
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_04: And this kind of puts together like this is really
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_04: the one place to use amazing prompts
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_04: or in a kind of blends this difference.
[00:25:53] How much units, interesting you mentioned
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: just seeing that it's a mass market consumer behavior
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_01: or maybe like a future one to be sharing prompts this way.
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_01: How much do you think for the average person
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_01: whose only AI experience has been with ChatGPT
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_01: that this is going to be a surprising new behavior
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_01: that they have to sort of adjust to
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_01: or something that feels very intuitive and obvious
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_01: and like, wow, I've been waiting for this.
[00:26:14] I hope it will be easy because in the end of the day,
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_04: it's just a mini app.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_04: It's just the app graphic user interface.
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_04: So it's something that we're all used to.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_04: You don't need to learn how to use these new tools.
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_04: I'd argue it's harder to use a command line
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_04: because you need to know, well, do I copy paste the text here?
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_04: Do I add an image right here with this prompt
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_04: or do I add it later?
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_04: It becomes a little bit more, it's too loose.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_04: There are no guidelines,
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_04: but everyone knows how to use apps.
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_04: And to degree, a lot of these kind of thin wrappers
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_04: blew up at some point.
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_04: Like Prisma was one of them or Lensa
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_04: where it was just like, you know, change your photo
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_04: into some avatar, some hat shot apps.
[00:26:57] I do.
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_04: High school yearbook.
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_04: High school yearbook.
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_04: That's clutch.
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_04: But a lot of, you know, they're awesome.
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_04: But again, like, there's a reason why apps, like that,
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_04: gain traction and not, you know,
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_04: people just passing along this prompt.
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_04: Because again, it's too high.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_04: Whenever there's, the motivation is not too high.
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_04: This amount of friction just kills all of my mojo.
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_04: I wake up in the morning, I'm on Twitter or Reddit
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_04: and find all these cool problems.
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_04: I'm like, I gotta try it.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_04: And then I'm like, a copy paste.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_04: I don't really work on whatever I forgot about it.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_04: So that I think is something that,
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_04: at least we're super excited about.
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_04: And it's not about just image and prompts,
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_04: but also some cool text prompts.
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_04: Like people come up with all sorts of cool stuff.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_04: There's, there are millions of people in the sun,
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_04: subreddits like Chagypti prompt genius.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_04: I love those.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_04: Sometimes you can find some crazy stuff in it.
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_04: But you would never even know that this could be a cool way
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_04: to use Chagypti unless you found it there.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_04: Like for example, someone made a fantastic prompt
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_04: to analyze your blood work.
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_04: I don't even, at this point, remember what was
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_04: and how I'm gonna find it.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_04: Right.
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_04: Versa could just download a mini app from Wabi
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_04: and kind of keep it in my health folder.
[00:28:12] On the investment team, we've said that there's,
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_02: you know, the world has 1% of the software that it needs
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_02: and that the rest is gonna be built in the next five years.
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_02: So let's give an example or say more about what that looks like
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_02: if we're, you know, 100 X in the amount of, you know,
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_02: meaningful or impactful software.
[00:28:28] Well, I don't know.
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_04: I guess I'm always going back to how magical YouTube felt
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_04: in the very beginning and all of these platforms
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_04: where it was all really about just creativity and very raw,
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_04: sometimes weird things like putting a home tape,
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_04: whatever home video on online for TikTok.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_04: I still remember all my, you know, whatever,
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_04: friends, younger kids, lip-syncing to different music
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_04: and how weird it was and felt like a toy
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_04: and then all of a sudden became really, really huge.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_04: And I think the same will happen with,
[00:29:08] or at least we hope that similar,
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_04: a similar trend will happen to Wabi
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_04: where in the beginning maybe a lot of that will look like toys
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_04: or something very simple, very kind of funny almost
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_04: and innocent and then eventually can grow
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_04: into a much larger platform.
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_04: But I guess if you think about it, like today,
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_04: we just treat apps as software.
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_04: But what if apps we could treat them as content?
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_04: If I'm a health influencer, fitness influencer on TikTok,
[00:29:35] maybe I should put out, here's my five mini apps
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_04: on Wabi I build that are kind of showcasing
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_04: my fitness protocol, get them and maybe there's a way
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_04: to monetize it in some way, maybe it's a way for that
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_04: fitness creator to create more content that's now useful.
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_04: Right now people sell courses and stuff instead of that.
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_04: I think many apps could be much better
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_04: and then people can be talking about that
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_04: in the community in the comment section.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_04: Again, this is a start of some community
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_04: people are working out together
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_04: people are doing something together.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_04: I do think we'll see just a completely different type
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_04: of software, not just apps, not just stale fix apps,
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_04: but more content community, community starters,
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_04: conversation starters and just fun little toys.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_01: Do you imagine it like a creator class,
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_01: a kind of professional class on Wabi?
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_01: Oh, 100, yes, of course.
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_04: I do believe that ideally this should happen.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_04: If we really think about as YouTube,
[00:30:34] that's sort of the last frontier.
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_04: At this point, creators can make their own professional content.
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_04: They can make videos, they can make shows, they can write,
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_04: but the still cannot create software.
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_04: It's still really not happening,
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_04: but anyone, especially small niche creators
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_04: should be able to afford to create for free
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_04: any software for their fans.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_04: And that's what I'm really, really looking forward to.
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_04: I've been struck by the idea that Mr. Beast,
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_02: the biggest creator in the world,
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_02: has such a close connection with his fans.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_02: They do anything for him.
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_02: The thing that he makes is chocolate.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_02: Like that's the thing that he chooses to do.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_02: That seems like the best modernization
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_02: and it just feels like this is yet another sort of,
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_02: type of offering that creators can provide
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_02: to have a closer relationship with their fans.
[00:31:22] Exactly, and if you think about it,
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_04: just even this style, I would love certain designers,
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_04: I want their apps that they build.
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_04: Because I'm sure they're gonna build very beautiful apps,
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_04: and I wanna look at them,
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_04: and even if it's the same functionality,
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_04: the same whatever, pomodal or timer,
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_04: but I want their take on it.
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_04: And so on.
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_04: I think there's so many different groups and niches that,
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_04: and it shouldn't all just be about monetizing.
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_04: It's really just about different styles,
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_04: different outlook on life on the world.
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_04: And that is to me, is very interesting.
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_04: I'm a huge user of Reddit,
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_04: and I find it very exciting,
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_04: because people just join around certain interests,
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_04: and that doesn't happen on other platforms really that much.
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_04: So that's something that I'm excited about here as well.
[00:32:13] Yeah, I think from the creator perspective,
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_00: one of the weird things about,
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_00: and we're all content creators in various ways,
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_00: and put out content,
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_00: and one of the weird things about that, I think, is you often,
[00:32:24] you don't really know,
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_00: you see how many impressions you pick at,
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_00: but you don't know if those are bots,
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_00: you don't know how many people are actually using the prompt
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_00: you posted, or watching the full video, or whatever.
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_00: And I think that is gonna be,
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_00: even beyond monetization, that part of lobby,
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_00: where you can see what someone else has done,
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_00: or created, or accomplished, or whatever,
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_00: with the prompt you wrote, or the app you made,
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_00: or the thing that you developed,
[00:32:46] will be incredibly cool,
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_00: not only for existing creators,
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_00: for who would really obviously want to do this,
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_00: but also for people who are not creators today,
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_00: but who have really interesting ideas,
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_00: and just like no way to build their own mobile app,
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_00: get it approved in the app store,
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_00: or ship it, like distribute it, that whole type of thing.
[00:33:04] Yeah, like what other new class of creators could be?
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_04: That's why in our style,
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_04: like in some of our communications,
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_04: we're also trying to,
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_04: I guess we're a little bit nostalgic about that early,
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_04: those early days of the internet,
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_04: and just being weird and staying weird right now,
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_04: a lot of the video platforms are very polished,
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_04: and very commercial.
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_04: You don't even see your friends anymore,
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_04: you don't see that much weird content,
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_04: you just see very curated, polished stuff.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_04: But with many apps with software,
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_04: I guess we're just entering this new era
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_04: of just tons of really weird and fascinating.
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_04: New many apps that wouldn't even could never exist,
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_04: because they wouldn't be enough of a business
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_04: on the app store.
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_04: Right, right.
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_01: Well, speaking of the early days,
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_01: should we talk a bit about replica
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_01: and your history in the community?
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, maybe,
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_02: so you were a true pioneer in the space,
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_02: but before everyone else was doing it,
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_02: you mentioned 2012,
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_02: maybe just talk about your reflections
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_02: of how that category has,
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_02: as you helped create it, and then how it's evolved.
[00:34:10] It definitely evolved.
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_03: It's crazy.
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_03: It's really crazy.
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_03: It's wild, because we were thinking about it recently,
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_04: just talking to one of the early employees of replica
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_04: that we had a very strong belief that it would happen,
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_04: but we still were so surprised
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_04: when it actually happened again.
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_04: This was just,
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_04: it just still felt like complete magic.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_04: For me, I got into it because my friend worked
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_04: at Google DeepMind in 2012,
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_04: and so he came to me to tell me about Word2Vec
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_04: and kind of the first technology to translate words
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_04: into vectors and to be able to actually do something
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_04: with words before that language was just
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_04: this whole separate,
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_04: almost like thing that computers could not interact with,
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_04: but now all of a sudden they could.
[00:34:58] And to me, I grew up reading Wiggenstein,
[00:35:00] so for me, it was like,
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_04: well, the limits of the language
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_04: are the limits of my world,
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_04: so I felt like, oh, well, that's insane.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_04: Computers learn language
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_04: then they learn about the world.
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_04: That will be, they'll be truly smart.
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_04: That is the future for artificial intelligence.
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_04: And so that's also,
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_04: ImageNet just came out,
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_04: so we saw all these new models around image recognition
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_04: and we felt like, well,
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_04: we got to start a company focused on language models,
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_04: focused on dialogue generation,
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_04: but of course there were no papers rounded at all,
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_04: and no, no algorithms or anything built models,
[00:35:38] SPEAKER_04: really back then there was nothing.
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_04: So we're just focusing on building some technology
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_04: to build chatbots using whatever they're trying
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_04: to build some language models around that.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_04: And then of course,
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_04: 2015 the first paper came out of Google by Quoklet
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_04: that actually showed off the first
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_04: deep learning model applied to dialogue generation.
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_04: And they didn't publish any models back then,
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_04: so it was all about just kind of reading the paper
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_04: and seeing some of the obviously cherry-picked results
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_04: and trying to replicate that.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_04: And when we saw that in August 2015,
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_04: we just basically put all of our,
[00:36:13] but everything we had at the company
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_04: on building those models was said, okay, well, this is it.
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_04: This is right on the corner.
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_04: We need to really focus on building these language models,
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_04: getting the first generative AI product out chatbot out there,
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_04: which we did with replica,
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_04: but it wasn't around the corner.
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_04: It was like seven years away.
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_04: And then we just had to survive for long enough
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_04: to actually get to the first transformer models.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_04: And then of course, I think the next magical moment
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_04: was the MENA paper also out of Google
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_04: with the first transformer model.
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_04: And then I remember in 2020,
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_04: we got invited by OpenAI to go see GPT-3 before API,
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_04: to partner up with them to be one of the first partners
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_04: for GPT-3 API to launch.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_04: So we came to the office and MENA,
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_04: who back then was actually leading partnerships.
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_04: And Sam showed us GPT-3, and I remember that was just,
[00:37:13] I was floored, it was insane.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_04: Just before that, if you think about it,
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_04: we had to train every model,
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_04: we had to create the specific data set.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_04: If you wanted to train a dialogue model,
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_04: you have to have tons of chat data,
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_04: and you would train the model,
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_04: and the model could only do dialogue.
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_04: But with GPT-3, it was the first kind of zero shot,
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_04: few shot model where you could do anything.
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_04: It didn't just have to respond in the dialogue format,
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_04: you can tell it well right at tweet like Sam Altman
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_04: or right at tweet this or translate, and it would do that.
[00:37:43] And so that would felt absolutely magical.
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_04: And we were the first, one of the first partners
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_04: of OpenAI, GPT-3 API, it was still crazy,
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_04: because we still have a Slack channel
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_04: where Greg Brockman is training a model for us,
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_04: which now feels just such a...
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_04: Amazing.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_04: We're a universal...
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_01: You still have the model?
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_01: Of the model.
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_04: It was, I think it was a fine tune diving chief for replica,
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_04: but we were the biggest customer in terms of API calls,
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_04: because we were the only chatbot available in the market
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_04: that actually used GERNDAVI.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_04: And now it's weird to think about it,
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_04: but back then, all the big companies were scared
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_04: to put out GERNDAVI products,
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_04: because Microsoft tie happened.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_04: And it turned into some Nazi chatbot and literary,
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_04: and hour and hour.
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_04: And so everyone else was too scared to put them out there.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_04: So we were sort of the only ones for so, so long
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_04: until OpenAI had put out their chat GPT
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_04: and kind of changed history without, of course.
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_04: But it was crazy, because before that,
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_04: we literally owned all the keywords like AI, chatbot,
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_04: artificial intelligence on every single platform.
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_04: And then we also owned hundreds of dot AI domains,
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_04: which I just let expire, because I felt like,
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_04: oh, everyone wants them.
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_04: They're not only not any of the devent domain platforms.
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_04: And then recently, I went to see what dot AI domains
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_04: are still available that are just regular words.
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_04: And the only words that are available are like,
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_04: bomb it dot AI and I rack dot AI.
[00:39:14] SPEAKER_04: I was telling my god it's upsetting.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_04: Name in Wabi, because of that was pretty hard.
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:39:22] So that's kind of the evolution from my perspective.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_04: You told us a story at dinner about the time
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_01: that you'd spent in the OpenAI office.
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_01: Maybe talk a little bit about that when you guys were
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_01: working out of there, what it was like,
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_01: what the energy was like, what were the expectations
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_01: of the team?
[00:39:38] SPEAKER_04: I think that, yeah, so when OpenAI started,
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_04: it was kind of out of YC research.
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_04: So they were doing a few, I guess you remember,
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_04: they were doing a few different research groups,
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_04: one on UBI, one on AI, some other ones.
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_04: And so because we were YC company and they let us come,
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_04: they were very generous with their time
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_04: and they would let us come to back then,
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_04: Greg's apartment where they were headquartered, I would say.
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_04: And they would let us come with a couple
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_04: of other companies that were doing AI at YC
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_04: to ask questions, learn from them, and just talk,
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_04: maybe exchange experience on what we're building.
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_04: So we would come to that apartment
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_04: and ask all the questions, usually it was Ilya and Andran,
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_04: some other people, and that was absolutely incredible.
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_04: We were, of course, absolutely Starstruck
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_04: and super happy to be there, just so grateful
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_04: for the opportunity.
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_04: And then they moved to their office
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_04: and we would go there as well.
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_04: And very quickly, they stopped working on language models.
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_04: And we were very upset because we really wanted
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_04: to continue going there.
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_04: But they didn't want to talk about any language models
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_04: because no one was really working on them.
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_04: And that may have made us feel very strange
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_04: because we were so sad on continuing
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_04: and believing in language models,
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_04: but they completely moved away to shift it
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_04: to playing video games and all of these kind of agents
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_04: kind of rebuilding the worlds and agents
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_04: in those worlds reinforcement learning for that
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_04: and all these other interesting things.
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_04: And I guess the only person for,
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_04: in the beginning it was kind of allic-front
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_04: for continued to work on language models.
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_04: So we had an opportunity to ask him some questions.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_04: But yeah, of course, that was,
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_04: it's just wild to think that
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_04: because when we were going to open out,
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_04: of course they were superstars even back then,
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_04: but still it felt like such a small kind of research group
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_04: that is trying to do something interesting.
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_04: Of course, now to see it become one
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_04: of the biggest companies in the world is absolutely wild.
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_04: Well, it's interesting because Andre said
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_01: on the recent pod that the entire video games direction
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_01: was an incorrect direction,
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_01: was incorrect research direction,
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_01: and they probably should have stuck with language.
[00:41:55] So you guys were right.
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_01: It's a, well, B-Rite is not all what's that mean.
[00:42:01] You gotta B-Rite, but also execute, I think, to degree.
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_04: We were really invested with replica
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_04: in building language models,
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_04: but at some point we just required a lot more capital to do that.
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_04: And after working on that for so long,
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_04: at that point, we just got really into just revenue,
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_04: maximization at some point because we little bit got,
[00:42:22] SPEAKER_04: maybe scared, we're like, well,
[00:42:26] we didn't have the balls to say, okay,
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_04: we'll need 20 million and we'll build that model.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_04: Even though that was our discussion internally
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_04: right after a mean paper and so on,
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_04: we just need to get a lot more money.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_04: If you think about it with replica,
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_04: we only raised $11 million and I guess it's still all in the bank
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_04: and we went for many, many years and built a big business.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_04: But of course, this is in hindsight a very interesting lesson
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_04: that sometimes being very nimble and very kind of scrappy
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_04: and very profit oriented is great,
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_04: but you can miss out on almost like a generational chance.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_04: And I'm not saying, even if we bet on it,
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_04: maybe we would have not built it,
[00:43:09] I would never compare myself to the geniuses
[00:43:12] that actually did it.
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_04: We're probably we're not the right people anyway.
[00:43:16] SPEAKER_04: But still, the lessons I think still stands.
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_04: Sometimes you need to sort of go big or go home
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_04: and not having the balls to do that,
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_04: especially in this current environment,
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_04: I think you can suffer the consequences.
[00:43:31] One of the things we say on the consumer team is,
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_00: consumer behavior, especially in your behavior,
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_00: it cannot be predicted, it can only be observed.
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_00: I think you are actually one of the few people
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_00: that is not true for because you seem to be able to predict
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_00: consumer behavior.
[00:43:45] Like you've been so early to a number of these things
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_00: and I think just every time we talk to you,
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_00: you seem to have an eye on not only like what's going on today,
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_00: but like what the next thing should be.
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_00: Is that like how did you develop that sense, I guess?
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure a lot of people would be curious to know.
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if I have that sense.
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_04: I only have like a couple ideas,
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_04: but I really believe in them.
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_04: Deeply and then I go really deep down the rabbit hole.
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_04: I start thinking about it.
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_04: But I do think that I do have a background in journalism
[00:44:15] SPEAKER_04: and pretty much the whole.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_04: I grew up dreaming of being a journalist.
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_04: My first job was 12 years old, working a newspaper.
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_04: I was an investigative journalist, reporter for a while.
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_04: And the one thing I loved about
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_04: is being able to go and talk to people
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_04: and to really, really try to get to know them
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_04: and live their lives.
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_04: And so for that, you sort of have to have a lot of empathy
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_04: and just try to real and curiosity about people.
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_04: And I think today what I'm seeing with AI,
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_04: especially, it's being built by a very specific type
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_04: of personality.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_04: It's oftentimes these savants,
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_04: this like brilliant geniuses, physicists, mathematicians.
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_04: And they're insane in building algorithms and math
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_04: and kind of scientific breakthroughs.
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_04: But they usually lack on the human empathy side.
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_04: That's just kind of how it is.
[00:45:08] SPEAKER_04: Meanwhile, I'm the opposite.
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_04: I'm a dumb dumb.
[00:45:11] It comes to a science.
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_04: Coming from a family of physicists,
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_04: they were always like, oh my god,
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_04: why can't you be smart and also go study physics?
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_04: But I couldn't.
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_04: But at the same time, I'm just really interested
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_04: in human condition of what people are doing.
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_04: And just seeing my mom trying to understand
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_04: how to copy-based a prompt from Reddit,
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_04: it was such a foreign idea for her to her.
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_04: And I realized like my mom is very savvy with computers.
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_04: She's always on her phone.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_04: She's always on her laptop.
[00:45:39] SPEAKER_04: But somehow she can't correct that.
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_04: This is just not user friendly enough.
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_04: And kind of understanding those concepts.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_04: And I think was really what let us see,
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_04: kind of come up with the idea for Wabi.
[00:45:53] SPEAKER_04: And the same goes for replica, just traveling around
[00:45:57] and talking to people and seeing how much
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_04: loneliness there is and how much people just want to be able
[00:46:02] SPEAKER_04: to tell someone what they're going through
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_04: and how few people are able to listen.
[00:46:08] SPEAKER_04: And I think that realization that maybe an AI
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_04: is not, can't talk well today, but it could listen.
[00:46:14] That that could be a groundbreaking thing
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_04: for millions in the world.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_04: So I think this is kind of what just allows me
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_04: to have a slightly different angle at the same problem.
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_04: If you want to speculate on the future of like hardware,
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_02: like what is sort of that hardware?
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_00: Or just like, like, you know, five, 10 years,
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_02: what is going to be the interaction,
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_02: like how are we going to be interacting with these applications?
[00:46:41] I do have a few ideas around hardware.
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_04: And I'm not a hardware person at all,
[00:46:46] SPEAKER_04: but I'm a hardware user like all of us.
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_04: So I get to have opinions I think.
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_04: I think where there's a huge mind trap
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_04: that exists among builders in the space,
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_04: where they somehow think that voice
[00:46:58] SPEAKER_04: is the main interface.
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_04: It's like the best ultimate interface.
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_04: And I think that's because they are somehow
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_04: thinking about the movie horror all the time,
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_04: but not in the right way, and kind of missing
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_04: the whole point of the movie horror,
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_04: that yes, voice was amazing in that movie
[00:47:15] SPEAKER_04: because it was Samantha Johansson constantly
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_04: having breathing his ear.
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_04: That totally worked.
[00:47:20] SPEAKER_04: You didn't even need to say anyone.
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry.
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry.
[00:47:24] In my case, that's why that worked.
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_04: But if you really think about voice interface,
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_04: that they're just so imperfect,
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_04: you can use that device if you're laying in bed
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_04: with someone who's sleeping.
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_04: You can use it in a crowded space.
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_04: You can use it at the office.
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_04: You can use it even walking around.
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_04: It's a little bit weird.
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_04: And so all of a sudden, you're bedding everything.
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_04: There's a lot of people trying to build voice-only devices.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_04: In my case, completely wrong.
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_04: It can be a fantastic, extra way to interact with the computer.
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_04: But every single Alexa right now, or like 75% of them
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_04: are being shipped with a screen.
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_04: Because even if I'm setting a timer when I'm cooking,
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_04: the proverbial voice use case, even that's
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_04: sorry, I need to see the timer.
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_04: I'm not going to be asking, hey, how long
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_04: is this left every second?
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_04: This is just strange.
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_04: And so I think this is kind of the biggest mistake
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_04: in my view is trying to ship these screenless devices.
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_04: I love screens.
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_04: I think there's no way with voice-to-soul for discovery,
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_04: for productivity.
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_04: I would hate if the worst thing with voice and the iPhone
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_04: is reading out, push notifications, text messages that
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_04: are coming.
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_04: I'm like, why?
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_04: Please shut up.
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_04: It's horrible.
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_04: It's very hard to listen to turn it off.
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_04: I hate it when it's terrible.
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_04: If this was just being, you want productivity,
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_04: but you don't want it to be read out loud in your ear
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_04: because this is just this very slow way
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_04: of getting information in your brain.
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_04: So anyway, so I think this is kind of the biggest mistake
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_04: I would not ever make a screenless device.
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_04: In fact, I would make it very much screen first device.
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_04: But I do believe that the AI device is not
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_04: about a voice-driven thing.
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_04: It's more about building this AI first operating system.
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_04: Having all the models run locally as well,
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_04: I think that there's a lot in that building truly
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_04: an AI first smartphone.
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_04: And not today, kind of more CPU-driven, whatever hardware.
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_04: But the hardware future where there are models that
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_04: can run locally with the operating system
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_04: is super different from what it is today,
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_04: with no fixed apps, with being able to change
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_04: and create software on the go for you,
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_04: with the level of personization that goes a lot deeper
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_04: than what it is today.
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think that there is definitely space
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_04: for a device like that.
[00:49:55] SPEAKER_04: Right now, AI is just an app on your phone.
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_04: It should not be that way.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_04: I guess.
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_04: And it's a great note to add.
[00:50:03] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_02: You're doing it thanks so much for coming to the podcast.
