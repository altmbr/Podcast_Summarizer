[00:00:28] SPEAKER_03: They gave us.
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_03: It's beautiful.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_03: They VIP us out.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_03: And this is the place you want to play cards.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_03: They've got a beautiful brand new poker room.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_03: They got a high stakes room.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_03: We'll be playing here later.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_03: We'll be playing C, Greek and and.
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_04: Yes.

[00:00:44] SPEAKER_04: And we're here for F1.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_04: We're going to be releasing.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_04: I brought a card dealer with me.
[00:00:48] Wait, you brought a card dealer with him.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_03: You know Matthew?
[00:00:52] Oh, you're a card dealer from your home game.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Matthew.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_03: Is he dead money?
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_03: What's the story here?
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_03: Sadly.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_03: No, OK.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_03: Sadly.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_03: I haven't been in the home game for a little bit.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_03: And it looks like people got out of line.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_03: But anyway, thank you so much to our friends at Venetian.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_03: They're doing a ton of poker content here,
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_03: so you can look at that on their YouTube.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_03: All right, everybody.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_03: You've wanted us to talk about the Epstein files.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_03: And we're going to talk about it today
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_03: in a stunning turn of events.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_03: The house and senate voted nearly unanimously
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_03: to release the Epstein files.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_03: The vote was 427 to 1, Schmoth, for the Epstein files.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_03: Who upstairs?
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_03: Who?
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_03: No, the person who abstained, well played,
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_03: was Republican Clay Higgins from Louisiana.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_03: Thanks for asking.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_03: He said it reveals and injures thousands of innocent people,
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_03: witnesses, people who provided alibis family members.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_03: He makes a great point.
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_03: But AG Pambondi, of course, has addressed that already
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_03: that they're not going to release any open investigations.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_03: And they're going to remove names
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_03: if it would harm anybody.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_03: The senate passed it by unanimous consent,
[00:01:52] which requires a sign-off from every senator and Trump
[00:01:55] in a reversal.
[00:01:56] Signed the bill last night saying, give them everything.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_03: We did see some emails come out from the Epstein files
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_03: last week.
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_03: Friend of the pod, Larry Summers, was a main character in them.
[00:02:08] And he was communicating with Epstein up until 2019,
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_03: asking him for advice on dating.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_03: He's since stepped down from opening eye
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_03: and several other public facing roles.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_03: And was just, I think, put on leave from Harvard.
[00:02:24] I mean, what do you guys think's going to be the fallout
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_03: from this, I guess, is what from the release of the files?
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_03: Is that the question?
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_03: I mean, I guess we'll put our tinfoil hats on.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_03: Let's break this down.
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_06: So I think the first question is, what
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_06: is the relation between the Epstein files and Donald Trump?
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_06: And I think the answer is it's flimsy.
[00:02:43] And the reason is because this is the most
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_06: investigated, most litigated, human being on Earth.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_06: And I think that if you had something that was incredibly
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_06: salacious and accusatory of Trump,
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_06: it would have been released during the Biden administration,
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_06: because it would have made a lot of sense politically
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_06: to try to damage his candidacy.
[00:03:01] So the fact that we haven't seen much of anything
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_06: other than some photos means that there's
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_06: nothing there related to Trump.
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_06: So then the question is, why didn't the Biden administration
[00:03:11] release more of the files when they had them for four years?
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_06: And it's probably because there are
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_06: a non-trivial number of democratic operatives that
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_06: are touched by these things.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_03: They did have, I think the reason they didn't release
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_03: some was because there was an open Gila in Maxwell case
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_03: as well, and she was appealing it so they couldn't release.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_03: There's probably two of them.
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_06: But you know how this works.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_06: There's innumerable number of ways to leak stuff.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_06: My point is now what you're starting to see in these documents
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_06: is that it seems to be tainting the democratic establishment
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_06: elite more than the Republicans.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_06: It explains why there was so few leaks in the last four years.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_06: The point is, Jeffrey Epstein was a total creep.
[00:03:53] That island should be covered in cement and drowned.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_06: The house should be burnt to the ground
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_06: and replaced with something nice.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_06: And you have to make sure that these,
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_06: you're the one that said this, the thousand women.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_06: That's what I saw report.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_04: They keep saying a thousand women.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_04: Someone said a thousand women.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_04: You have to be in there.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_04: Apparently in there there's claims that it's,
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_04: oh, it was one of the victims who said there's a thousand of us.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_04: OK, I mean, you have to be incredibly careful and thoughtful
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_06: to protect their rights and just to respect
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_06: what they've gone through.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_06: But I think now we need to just release these files
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_06: in an orderly manner and put this episode behind us,
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_06: learn what we need to learn from it, get better, be better,
[00:04:29] treat these people with respect and move on.
[00:04:31] Yeah.
[00:04:31] But do you think the release of the files
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_04: is meant to help the victims?
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_04: Or do you think it's meant to identify
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_04: fodder to go after political enemies?
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_04: Neither of those two things.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_06: The releasing of the files at this point
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_06: is one of these things that is about a compact
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_06: between those that have power and those that
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_06: ask for something.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_06: This is an issue that is animated millions of Americans.
[00:04:57] So when they constantly keep asking for these things
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_06: to be put out there, I think it's a good signal
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_06: for the government to listen to folks and release them.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_06: Again, in a respectful way.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_06: Similarly, there are other things that I think fall into this.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_06: We've heard about the JFK files, right?
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_06: The killing of Mark Luther King, the Amelia Earhart files.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_06: And so...
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_06: All the UFO files.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_06: All the UFO files.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_06: I think what it does is it shows a pattern
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_06: of being responsive to the voting public.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_06: And I think that that's a good thing.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_06: So Higgins, who, by the way, was a sheriff,
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_04: he was an Army staff sergeant and he's been in Congress
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_04: for I think nine years.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_04: In addition to talking about the victims,
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_04: he said, you know, this abandoned 250 years
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_04: of criminal justice procedure in America.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_04: And releasing broad reveal of criminal investigative files
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_04: released to a rabid media will absolutely result
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_04: in innocent people being hurt.
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_04: Do you think this is like a singular situation
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_04: with Epstein because it's so extraordinary?
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_04: And there's so many people tied up in it?
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_04: Or does this set of precedent where anytime people
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_04: and the media start to say, hey, we want to know what's going on
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_04: in the middle of an active investigation
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_04: or form investigation that these files kind of get released
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_04: and this becomes a new standard
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_04: where we're just going to start to open up investigative files
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_04: like this.
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_04: You think it's like a singular thing?
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_04: Because this is his whole point.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_04: This feels like a singular thing.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_03: Like, and also it'll bake for a lot of these issues
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_03: have to bake for a decade or two
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_03: before people want them to come out.
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_03: This has been going on for now for how many decades?
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_03: It's just like a 20-year story.
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_03: I feel like a 20-year story.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_04: I feel like a 20-year story.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_04: A investigative piece that's missing
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_04: is how did he get away, Scott Free, in Florida?
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_04: I actually, when there was, he was criminally charged,
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_04: he was convicted and plead out,
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_04: and he was basically let go.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_04: I can actually tell the story that I feel,
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_04: you know about this.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_04: I know a little bit about it because I met Epstein
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_03: half-dozen times at the TED conference.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_03: What you did?
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_03: So interesting.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_03: I've talked about it on my Twitter and Sassal P
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_03: because I'm in it.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_03: Because you are in his book.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_03: I am amongst the thousands of people in his black book.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_03: I met him at the TED conference, my book,
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_03: A.J., Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_03: David and I.
[00:07:01] Congratulations, you guys were in New York.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_03: And he was, I just avoided that room.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_03: Well, there was a billionaire's dinner at the TED conference.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_03: I didn't actually go to the TED conference.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_03: My book agent would host the billionaire's dinner.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_03: And if you type in billionaire's dinner,
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_03: I'd go to the TED conference.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_04: You'd go to the TED conference.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_04: It was like, I was never invited to the billionaire's dinner.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_03: This is in the 1990s.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_03: Like, this is how old this is.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_03: He was there giving donations to scientists,
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_03: Marvin Minsky, MIT, Joe Edo, all this up.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_03: And when he went away and he got busted in Miami,
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_03: the way it was framed in the TED community
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_03: was that he was set up.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_03: And this was just like an underage girl.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_03: They had checked her ID.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_03: And it was like some sort of a set up
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_03: and that he had been given a work from home sentence.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_03: He could go to work every day.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_03: And then he had to report to jail.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_03: And that it was all just like a misunderstanding
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_03: is how they framed it.
[00:07:58] I think, looking back on it, I think he's a spy.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_03: I think he worked for intelligence agencies.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_03: Now, I am not the conspiracy there is of this podcast.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_03: Work for or shared intel with because both of the...
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_03: Okay, sure.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_03: It could be any in that set.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_03: We all know people in the intelligence community
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_04: and there's easy ways to pass intel without it being...
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_04: Sure.
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_04: Working for...
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_03: Then I think the question becomes, was he an asset?
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_03: Was he sharing information to what extent?
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_03: And the reason I think this is because
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_03: why would he have an interest in the top scientists
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_03: in the top universities to get close to them?
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_03: And then who did he want to pass that information on to?
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_03: Who would want top intelligence from scientists?
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_03: Russia, Israel, the CIA, and then the compromise thing
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_03: does seem also likely because he had cameras everywhere
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_03: and they've talked about this.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_03: So he had cameras...
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_03: And you're saying he recorded famous people
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_04: and then used that to get things.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_03: I think there is a non-zero chance
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_03: that part of the story is true.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_03: The part of the story that's unanswered.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_03: But I don't know that it's like a 90% chance that happened
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_03: and I think that when we go back and we look at this,
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_03: there's a bunch of people who have embarrassing interactions
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_03: with this person who spread money everywhere.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_03: Everybody wanted his money.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_03: That's where they were lining up.
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_03: All the scientists, Joey, Edo, Reid Hoff,
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_03: and all of these folks were trying to get his money,
[00:09:21] which is peculiar.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_03: And he was also giving tax advice
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_03: to the Microsoft people, to Peter Tiel.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_03: So he was always trying to integrate himself
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_03: into powerful people with money and scientists.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_03: Why was it to make money or was it for some other purpose?
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_03: I think it was not to make money.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_03: I think there was some other purpose here.
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_03: Now I am not a conspiracy theorist,
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_03: but because this thing has gone on so long
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_03: and it has not been released, I think there's...
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_03: There's a bunch of mechanisms
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_03: that are keeping it at bay.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_03: That's what...
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_03: That's to me like the Occam's razor version of this.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_03: I think there's gonna be very embarrassing
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_03: or compromising things for intelligence agencies,
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_03: which is I think the same thing behind...
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_03: If I could have one thing...
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_03: JFK's assassination.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_03: If I could have one question answered for me,
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_04: out of the Epstein file,
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_04: if I could just have the question answered,
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_04: I'd wanna know where did all his money come from?
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_04: Because it is not very clear how a guy
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_04: who was managing money for a billionaire...
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_04: Wexler.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_04: Wexler.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_04: We all know, like if you're money manager,
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_04: maybe you're making half a percent a year.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_04: No, that was documented.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_04: How he got money.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_04: He was on the lack, who's the founder of Apollo,
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_06: in one year paid Epstein $168 million for tax advice.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_06: That came out in the lawsuit
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_06: that ultimately led to Leon Black resigning from Apollo.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_06: Right.
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_06: And...
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_06: Was it tax advice?
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_06: That's what he said it was.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_06: Now look, I'm not trying to hire all anybody,
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_06: but I've had all the tax advisors come and give me their advice.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_06: It didn't cost you $160 million.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_06: It cost you $1,200 an hour.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_06: No, it's cost me millions.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_06: It didn't cost me 30 million.
[00:10:53] But it's never...
[00:10:55] I am hard pressed to understand...
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_06: What advice could have been given to me
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_06: that where I would have paid $168 million...
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_06: Shama, that's breaking news.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_06: Here's your accountants.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_03: They just said the bill.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_03: It's $172 million.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_06: No, no, no, no.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_06: It's crazy.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_03: Right, you're right.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_06: And look, if you go to the best of state lawyers
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_06: in the United States,
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_06: it will cost you $5 to $10 million.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_06: What do you think he was getting paid for?
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_06: I mean, was he getting a portion of the savings
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_03: for doing tax loopholes?
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_03: Maybe he was charging on some sort of a commission,
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_03: but he had...
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_03: He was a money manager for many of these,
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_03: like Microsoft executives, et cetera.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_03: And when Peter Teele said,
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_03: why did you meet with me?
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_03: He said, tax advice, which makes total...
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_03: That's a total Peter Teele, like legitimate...
[00:11:38] That totally tracks.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_03: Peter Teele was known for his Roth, right?
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_03: And he's known for like studying these kind of things.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_03: It makes total sense to me.
[00:11:45] I think that we're gonna have a bunch of Larry Summers
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_03: like embarrassing things.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_03: There could be embarrassing things there
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_03: for Democrats, Republicans, everybody in between.
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_03: The scientists obviously who went to the island
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_03: and all that stuff is gonna be all embarrassing.
[00:11:58] And I think we're gonna get to the end of the day.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_03: We're gonna find out that some intelligence agency
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_03: was somehow involved in this.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_03: And that's why it's being covered up.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_03: And that's why it's...
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_03: That's my prediction.
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_03: That's my prediction.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_04: Nostra Canis has spoken.
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_04: Which intelligence agency will you pick?
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_06: Yeah. Oh, good, sir.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_06: Look into your crystal ball.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_06: I mean, CIA...
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_03: I mean, it would be one of the big three,
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_03: the CIA, which he was talking to...
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_03: I think in this latest volley of emails,
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_03: he was talking to people from Israel, from the CIA,
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_03: and he was talking to Russians.
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_03: He was talking to all three in the emails that had been leaked.
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_03: So you can just...
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_03: He was talking to Russian intelligence.
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_03: He was talking to Russians.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_03: Oh my God.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_03: Really?
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_03: No, Russians, I think, is just generally...
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_03: He was very involved with Russians.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_06: Could you imagine how much anxiety we would have
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_06: if that was our job?
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_06: Could you imagine?
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_06: I can't even imagine.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_06: I just wanna go to my office, build some stuff,
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_06: make a few investments in the whole...
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_06: Roll corner.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_05: Play with my kids, test people.
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_05: You know?
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_05: It just seems like what?
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_05: What?
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_05: Oh my God.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_05: I mean, I just...
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_03: So Ethan, when they make the movie, are you gonna play yourself?
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_04: Or...
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_03: I mean, if you look online, if you go to theedge.org site
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_03: and you look at those billionaire dinners,
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_03: you'll see me in a couple of pictures with Larry Sergei,
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_03: Zach, Ev Williams, when we were all 29, 30 years old.
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_03: Can I nominate Jesse Eisenberg to play you?
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_06: I know his hair is totally in your history.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_03: I think it's more like Leo Loughlin' now.
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_03: Or people might say Ethan Hawke.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_03: I get a lot of those, but I don't even know.
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_03: Who would play a Gilein?
[00:13:29] Great.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_04: I mean, which young Gilein is Reed Hoffman?
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_03: Who would pay for Reed Hoffman, huh?
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I just don't see a world in which Reed was involved
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_03: in shenanigans, I'll be totally honest.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_03: I think he was just trying to raise money.
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_03: I think it's like unfair that everybody is like...
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_03: Who met him is being dragged into like,
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_03: Oh, they were somehow a pedophile.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_03: Like, that's just crazy.
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_03: I think they were all trying to get his money.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because this guy was a consummate networker,
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_04: obviously doing a bunch of stuff.
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_03: He funded all of those dinners.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_03: He was funding all of these dinners.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_03: He was hosting dinners in New York.
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_03: In New York, he was known for having these dinner parties
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_03: with all kinds of famous people.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_03: You can look online.
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_03: He was constantly... That was his business, pretty much.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_03: His business was to meet with people.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_03: Yeah. To throw dinners.
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_03: To throw dinners, Tcha'mon.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_03: That seems colorically toxic.
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_06: You know what I mean? Like dinner parties?
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_06: Like, you overeated a dinner party.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_06: You guys are having like three of those a week?
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_06: I don't know.
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_03: Jason, I don't know anybody who's having three dinner parties
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_04: a week.
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_04: It's a lot.
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_04: All right.
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_04: Jason, I went to carbon last night.
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_04: Well, we'll talk about it when Keaton gets here.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_04: That got a little heated.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_04: I mean, speaking of...
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_04: We'll talk about it when we talk about our hangouts here.
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_03: Somebody got out of line.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_03: All right, thanks again to our friends at the Venetian.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_03: I had dinner last night with Paulo Arduino.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_06: CEO, founder of Tether.
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_06: Can't wait to meet him.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_06: Amazing, amazing guy.
[00:14:53] That is an incredible business.
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_06: But it got 150 billion in treasure, isn't it?
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_06: It is, it is an incredible...
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_06: And here's why that business is incredible.
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_06: This is what I love.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_06: We're talking about Tether, the stable coin.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_03: Tether, the stable coin.
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_06: Yes.
[00:15:05] There are 500 million people
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_06: using US dollar back stable coins from Tether all around the world.
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_06: All over Africa, all over Central America, all over Asia.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_06: Number one.
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_06: Number two.
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_06: His user base is growing by 30 million users a quarter.
[00:15:24] It's the financial inclusion that then ties back to US dollar
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_06: hegemony is unbelievable.
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_06: So if you think about it...
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_06: So wait, I bought a stable.
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_04: Explain it to me like I'm an idiot
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_04: who's never bought a stable coin.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_04: So he's like every week, which is why.
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he's like every other week.
[00:15:40] So let's look at these businesses as roughly the same.
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_06: There's circle, there's Tether,
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_06: there's world liberty financial.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_06: They all have a stable coin.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_06: What is it?
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_06: Okay, so let's just say that Jason is a cash worker in India.
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_06: Let's just use that example.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_06: Sure.
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_06: He gets paid 100 rupees.
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_06: And he's like, you know, the rupee is constantly getting devalued.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_06: I have constantly losing purchasing power.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_06: I want to swap that into a US dollar.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_06: So he would create a crypto wallet.
[00:16:11] And what Tether will say is great.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_06: Give me your 100 rupees.
[00:16:17] They immediately swap it to a US dollar.
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_06: So now there's a US dollar and there's a token for that dollar.
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_06: I give Jason the token for that dollar.
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_06: Now I have this dollar.
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_06: What do I do with it?
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_06: When I accumulate enough of these dollars, 50 billion, 100 billion, I can take that and
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_06: I would invest it in treasuries so that it's completely safe.
[00:16:38] US treasuries.
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_03: US treasuries.
[00:16:41] Now if Jason decides to send it to you and then you redeem, I can sell a little bit one
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_06: dollar of those treasuries that I own and undo the chain.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_06: And does Tether earn all the interest on the treasury?
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_04: So I'm getting to this.
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_06: So now, Tether and Circle and World Liberty, they earn interest on that.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_06: And so now when the number gets big enough, this number gets ginormous.
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_06: Then what they do in Tether's case is they then reinvest this capital into all kinds
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_06: of distributed assets.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_06: Bitcoin, gold, real estate, but what they also do is they now invest in things like financial
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_06: inclusion in Africa.
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_06: So he walked me through kind of a bunch of things that he's doing yesterday.
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_06: It is an incredible business.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_06: And so as a holder of the stable coin in my wallet, I'm not earning any of that treasury
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_04: yield.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_04: I just have a flat dollar denominator or dollar protected.
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_04: You have a peg to the dollar.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_04: You have a dollar peg stable coin.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_06: And that is sufficient risk management and risk mitigation for half a billion people.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_06: Right.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_06: They're not trying to get a 4% or 3% interest yield.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_04: So now they care more about not being in.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_04: You're bringing up the big point, which is in the United States, what is the big fight
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_06: now?
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_06: The big fight in the United States, in this thing called the Clarity Bill, that is meandering
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_06: through the House and the Senate, is what should happen in the market structure?
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_06: So meaning if you, David Friedberg, is the one that gave me the dollar and I am, for
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_06: example, say coin base and I issue you a stable coin, do I share that revenue with you?
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_06: Do you earn all of it?
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_06: Obviously the banks, like the JP Morgan's of the world, the city banks, they don't want
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_06: that, right?
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_06: Because that's their net interest margin.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_06: That's what happens today.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_06: Right.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_06: You deposit money in the bank.
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_06: And Sach said this on the program.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_06: The city bank goes off the bus.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_06: So in the stable coin legislation, they weren't able to give the stable coin providers the
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_03: ability to pay interest to consumers.
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_03: They did that concession, but that will change over time.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_03: But the banks were able to fight for that concession.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_03: The banks were able to fight for it.
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_06: But then you have the emergent crypto companies who say, hey, this is like, let's find a way
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_06: where we can do a sharing mechanism.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_06: How they hack around it is they do kind of sharing, but this via this collusion way called
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_06: rewards.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_06: Yes.
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_06: You earn rewards and you earn reward points, but it's not really what it should be.
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_06: It should be that if you earn net interest margin, you should be able to share that.
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_06: And by the way, you should be able to have different rules and different markets because,
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_06: again, if you're in Kenya, the last thing you're probably thinking is, do I get the 4%
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_06: what you're more worried about is the Kenyan currency, whatever it's called, is about
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_06: to depreciate another 60%.
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_06: Right.
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_06: Let me just hedge that.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_06: Right.
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_06: And that's more than enough value.
[00:19:18] Right.
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_06: Anyways, I thought Paulo was incredibly impressive.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_06: Well, I will say this.
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_06: Business is really impressive.
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_06: I have been super critical of Tether publicly and they had a lot of challenges as a business.
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_03: They were banned in many markets.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_03: They didn't do any audits.
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_03: People didn't know what was in there.
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_03: They've done an incredible job cleaning all that up.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_03: Now they are starting to do going from a test stations to audits and they desperately want
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_03: to be legal in America in that legislation.
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_03: They have three years to do it and they have to then unwind being banned in New York,
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_03: and then they have to be banned in Canada, all these places like all of them.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_03: I have an offer for you.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_03: Let me finish my thought for a second.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_03: I just want to give credit to David Sachs.
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_03: What we saw under Biden and what we saw with the anti-crypto approach that they took and
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_03: Trump in his first presidency was anti-crypto as well.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_03: That decade of anti-crypto led to a lot of people doing offshore stuff like Tether, a lot
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_03: of shenanigans, and actually Sachs who can't make it this weekend, he has now created
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_03: a framework which is helping people do it the right way and taking out all of these
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_03: questions.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_03: Tether is example one.
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_03: They were involved in human, the Tethers have been the default for all kinds of...
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_03: Do you know that for sure?
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_03: This has been in our commercial hearings.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_03: They have double-managed.
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_03: They have double-managed.
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_03: Let's not make the accusation if we don't know.
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_06: What I saw yesterday was a very, very, very credible and thoughtful entrepreneur and a
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_06: great business.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_06: The only thing, sorry, that I'll say is I would like to invite you to come with me to
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_06: the Tether Conference at the end of January.
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_06: We are going to...
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_06: We've never turned down an invitation.
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_04: Here we go.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_04: Here's what we're going to do.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_04: We're going to fly together to El Salvador.
[00:21:03] We're going to do a tour of the prisons.
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_06: We're going to do an interview with Bukheli and then we're going to do an interview with
[00:21:11] SPEAKER_06: Paulo and then we'll fly home.
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_03: Can you come with me?
[00:21:15] If I can ask him any questions I want and you have to go check out the prison.
[00:21:20] No, I've been told...
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_06: I've been told you can not go to Erkott the first trip.
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_03: You go to Erkott the second trip.
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_06: I don't want to go anywhere near that prison but if I can ask him any question and he'll
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_03: be fine with it.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_03: He's great, dude.
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_03: I'm happy to go.
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_03: In any other world he would have been in Silicon Valley doing the same thing.
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_06: Anyway.
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_06: The other challenge they're going to have is when interest rates go down, these businesses
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_03: are going to have to figure that out as well.
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_03: But $183 billion in circulating USDT, that's a ticker symbol right now.
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_03: $135 billion of that's in treasuries and then another like 10 billion in Bitcoin and gold.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_03: And land.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_03: Well, and that means they're throwing off whatever 5%.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_03: They were making $78 billion a year just on the holdings.
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_03: I'm not going to tell you what the details are but I've never seen a business.
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_03: No, they said it's a $500.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_03: The word on the straight is a $500 billion market cap which would be roughly 50 times
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_03: there.
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_03: When the rights to sales ratio.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_03: Let me say a different.
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_03: They're making $10 billion.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_06: What's more, what do you think their profit margins are?
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_06: Forget the growth quantum.
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_06: Oh, you only need 100 people to run the business.
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_06: So, if the interest is the revenue, it's probably 60, 70% margin business.
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_04: Upwards of more than 95%.
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_06: It makes total sense because you, I mean, how many people do you want to thought last
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_05: night at the dinner?
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_05: Here we are.
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_05: We try to get to third four.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_05: I mean, he said it's so many of our businesses.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_05: Okay, he started and he's like, yeah, yeah, it's incredible.
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_05: It's incredible.
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_04: The good for him.
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_05: Congratulations.
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_05: Congratulations.
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_04: The good news about that is there's a there's a financial theory though that high margin
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_04: businesses like that invite competition more.
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_04: That's literally where it's going.
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_04: This is where competition gets ground down.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_04: Stripe bought the like a stablecoin provider.
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_03: It's pretty well known.
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_03: Stripe visa.
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_03: Everybody's going to have their own stablecoin.
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_03: So, Tether will not have the market all to themselves and obviously, Jermila and Circle
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_03: is a very vital.
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_03: Fortunately, margin like that's only got one direction to go.
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_04: Correct.
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_04: And if the, let's talk about it.
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and if the margin, if the interest rates go down, which is, we'll talk about that
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_03: as well, that's going to be headwinds for that whole space.
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_03: All right.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_03: We've been talking a bit about the, about Brad Gersinger personally deciding to blow
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_03: up the AI bubble and then destroying the stock market.
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_03: I'm joking.
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_03: Shout out to Brad Gersinger.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_03: My gosh, this short Bitcoin thing has been a bananza.
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_03: Oh, crazy.
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_03: And then, wow.
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_03: Is it below 90?
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_03: It is, right?
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_06: I know it hit 88 or something, but I mean, watch out below.
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_03: Let's see the price.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's talk about Nvidia.
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_03: So Nvidia had a blow out quarter.
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_03: Reving you up 62% year over year.
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_03: 22% quarter over quarter net income 31.9 billion.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_03: That's up 65%.
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_03: Year over year.
[00:24:05] Expect 65 billion this quarter.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_03: Jensen, friend of the pod, has said that they can't keep their product on the shelves.
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_03: It's sold out everywhere.
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_03: And then at the same time, Michael Burry, who has got to short on it, he's been mixing
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_03: it up.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_03: He is posting in response, I think, to you free, Berglast week, making it a defense of the
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_03: reasonable life of an H100 of these new chipsets that Nvidia sells is it four years, five
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_03: years, six years, seven years.
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_03: When did they get replaced?
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_03: When did they have a useful life and gap accounting?
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_03: He believes, just to make it easy for the audience to understand, that major tech companies,
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_03: Big Tech, are cooking the books in order to spike their earnings, that this is the house
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_03: of cards, and that he's going to short, palantir, because it's a 100 to one sales, price
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_03: sales ratio, but he's going to also short Nvidia, et cetera, because of the depreciation.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_03: What's your thoughts?
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_03: I know you've seen his comments, free bird.
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_03: I downloaded the gap depreciation rules.
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_04: I was going to play a counting corner jingle, which a fan, by the way, set me over the
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_04: week.
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_04: Oh, great.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_04: But I got the internet working.
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_04: We'll put it in post.
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_04: We'll put it in post.
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_00: I want to hear it.
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_00: We'll put it in post.
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_00: I want to hear it.
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_00: Depreciation in round trips to, let's talk about some modern revenue.
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_00: Sharp in your pencils.
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_00: Let's see what you got.
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_00: It's a counting corner, Epioman.
[00:25:30] Very nicely does.
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_03: Thank you, thank you for joining me here at a counting corner, and thank you to Roxana
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_04: Martinez for that incredible jingle.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_04: I think we should adopt it.
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_04: Love it.
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_04: Send in your jingle, folks.
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_04: Jason, the depreciation rules.
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_04: Counting standards, 360.
[00:25:46] Here we go.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_04: Depreciation must reflect the assets.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_04: Estimated useful life.
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_04: Not market innovation.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_04: The specific language.
[00:25:57] Can you call this at 11.30 tonight and put his to bed?
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_05: OK, this is, you found the corner even more boring than science corner.
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_05: People love accounting corner.
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_04: I'm not explaining it, because I'm...
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_05: Yes, it is actually important.
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_05: Under the gap standards, they generally accepted accounting principal standards.
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_04: So you set a useful life, and you reset that useful life as you do a reassessment on
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_04: when you're actually using that asset.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_04: Not necessarily if there's a better asset that makes more value.
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_04: So let's just explain this again.
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_04: You make a big investment in property, plant, equipment, and that investment you write
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_04: down over a period of time that you as an accountant estimate to be the useful life of that asset.
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_04: So if you're going to use a building for 20 years, every year you write down the cost
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_04: of that building by 120.
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_04: You don't get to write it all down in the first year.
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_04: In fact, what Burry is arguing is that if you wrote it all down in the first year,
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_04: your profit would go down and your business would look worse.
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_04: So when you make an investment that you can use over a period of time, unlike salary,
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_04: when you pay someone a salary, you're paying them for the hours they're working that quarter,
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_04: that year.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_04: And so that money is an expense.
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_04: It gets recognized as a period.
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_04: Absolutely.
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_04: That period.
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_04: But when you make an investment in a building or a piece of equipment that you're going
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_04: to use over time, you depreciate it.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_04: You depreciate it just to go through that principal again.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_04: And so there's standards in gap on how do you recognize the depreciation schedule?
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_04: What's the useful life?
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_04: And the useful life is when you're actually realizing return value from that asset.
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_04: Burry's point is incorrect on Twitter, he said.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_04: The idea of a useful life for depreciation being longer because chips from more than three
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_04: to four years ago are fully booked.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_04: Confuses physical utilization with value creation.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_04: That is incorrect.
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_04: There is value creation because they are generating revenue from those chips this year, six years
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_04: later.
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_04: So there is in fact a useful life for that chip that has extended into year six.
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_04: Now let me ask you, it doesn't matter.
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_04: And this is a part of the gap point that I wanted to bring up.
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_04: So what he's arguing is you should depreciate it over say three years, which means you're
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_04: doubling the cost every year and that it's all written off in three years.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_04: But if you did that to give you a point of example in Google's case, their total net profit
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_04: would come down by roughly 10 to 12%.
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_04: So it's not like they're cooking the books and recognizing some massive delta in their
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_04: profit by doing this.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_04: The difference between three and six years is roughly 12% of their profit.
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_04: And they're still using these chips.
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_04: And what Gap says is that only if the new asset, meaning the new chips, replaces the old
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_04: one, then the old assets remaining useful life has to be marked down and you take accelerated
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_04: depreciation at year.
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_04: Of course.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_04: Or if the maintenance costs spike, which means you have to spend money to fix the asset
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_04: which is not the case with chips.
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_04: The third is if the throughput requirements exceed the old equipment capabilities forcing
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_04: early retirement, they're not retiring.
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_04: They're still making revenue off the old chips.
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_04: Or if technological obsolescence means that you're putting it up for sale, then you can
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_04: meaning you stop using it after a period of time.
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_04: If you put it up for sale, you would actually know the market value of it.
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_04: You could take that from the depreciation.
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_04: This is almost textbook gap, which is that if you're still using the asset after six
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_04: years, you can depreciate it over six years.
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_04: I think this conversation lacks technical literacy.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_06: So let's assume you're a Google.
[00:29:13] And let's just say that the equivalent of an output token was the equivalent of a link.
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_06: The first thing you would tell me is HMOT, not all links are made equal.
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_06: So for example, if you generate a link for a pharmaceutical drug, Google charges a
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_06: price per click that's way different than the link that they generate that goes to Amazon
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_06: to buy toothpaste.
[00:29:37] Now for Amazon, it actually costs the same amount of money to generate that link for Google.
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_06: Sorry.
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_06: I think the thing that he needs to understand is he's equating this to energy.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_06: But the reality is that in AI models, the thing that we care about is what is that output
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_06: token?
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_06: What is the revenue that's being generated?
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_06: What is the revenue that's being generated by that output token?
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_06: And ultimately, what he doesn't appreciate is that obviously Google and Facebook and
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_06: Microsoft and OpenAI and X are not going to be in the business of generating negative
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_06: revenue output tokens just for the sake of it.
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_06: How do you know that?
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_06: My wife got to the end of the internet this week.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_06: She launched X, put it on voice mode.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_06: She was stuck in traffic going from our house all the way to San Mateo and back.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_06: That's like 10 minutes.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_04: No, no, no, it's 25 minutes up, 25 minutes back.
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_06: And she said, hey, you know what?
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_06: I ran out of tokens.
[00:30:29] Like it said, you can't use it anymore.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_06: You're wrong.
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_04: You mean?
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_06: Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_06: Why do they do that?
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_06: It's because they are very conscious of there's a certain energy output, there's a certain
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_06: revenue potential, and then beyond this, they start to gated.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_06: You do it on OpenAI, you do it on all these things.
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_06: So they are already keenly aware of the value of these outputs tokens.
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_06: They know the revenue it's generating.
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_06: Sorry, just one thing.
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_06: And then the second thing is, in the bowels of these organizations, everybody has completely
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_06: rebuilt all of the decoder infrastructure.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_06: What does that mean?
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_06: Or something gets to you the user.
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_06: There's all kinds of different manipulations that people are doing in the models, after
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_06: the models, before the models.
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_06: And all of that stuff has been rebuilt.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_06: So I think what he needs to understand and look, in fairness to him, what I would say,
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_06: what GAP needs to appreciate is when those laws were written, it's for a factory.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_06: It's for a turbine.
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_06: And it's this static thing.
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_06: It probably doesn't do a very good job of understanding the world of chips.
[00:31:29] But could he take a little bit of effort to call somebody and actually learn how this
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_06: works?
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_06: Yes.
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_06: Is he doing it?
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_06: No.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_06: So.
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, hold on.
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_03: I think the most important point of what you said there is, Chimoff.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_03: This is a new asset.
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_03: And it's a new space.
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_03: There might be some companies that are like, we're going to lose money on this and we're
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_03: going to let you build, I don't know, Sora videos.
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_03: And that's just going to be a money loser for five years as we get chat GPT to two billion
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_03: users.
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_03: And we don't care about it.
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_03: And those machines are going to have 90% of their utilization in the first three years.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_03: And then for the next seven years, it will be 10% of their value.
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_03: They'll be doing some small jobs in the background that won't be as important.
[00:32:13] Accounting isn't built to do this kind of refined depreciation schedule.
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_04: But what do you mean 90% of their utilization?
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_04: Because if they're still making value to the consumer.
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_03: So that if you theoretically think about the value of that H100, what value did the
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_03: users get out of it?
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_03: Well, the value today is like I'm making goofy Sora videos that generate no revenue.
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_03: It's all money losing.
[00:32:37] SPEAKER_03: But down the road, that might actually be advertising.
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_03: And it might create certain number of clicks.
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_03: It might create some number of subscriptions.
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_03: So we'll actually be able to attribute revenue to it.
[00:32:48] There's no way to look at these devices right now and to know how much of them are actually
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_03: generating revenue in the first two years versus the next four years.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_06: I think we know now much more than we did even six months ago.
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_06: How do you how to value an output token?
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_06: And then what is the instructions we give to the accounting community on how to deal
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_04: with that?
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_04: This is not that complicated.
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_04: In the past, there have been efforts to try and change straight line depreciation.
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_04: But your point of utilization, I don't think it's necessarily the correct one.
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_04: If they're still making revenue on that chip every year, you're four, you're five, you're
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_04: six.
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_04: So even if they're still using a dollar chip, it's still generating revenue for them.
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_04: And I think that the remember, the cost of electricity and the cost of running the data
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_04: center is still like it's still an expense in that period.
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_04: So all of that shows up as an operating expense.
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_04: So if it's generating negative profit, negative gross profit, the market sees that.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_04: And I will say one more thing that I think is really important.
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_04: And they were turned it off.
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_04: Cash stand until tolerated.
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_04: You get a point and then they'll stop.
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_06: You get, look, there's no hidden information here.
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_04: Buries implication that they are cooking the books or hiding accounting is completely false
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_04: because all of the accounting is apparent in the cash flow statement and in the balance
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_04: sheet.
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_04: Remember, companies have three financial statements, an income statement, a balance sheet
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_04: and a cash flow statement.
[00:34:09] SPEAKER_04: The cash flow statement reconciles the income statement and the balance sheet makes the
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_04: linkage.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_04: And it shows you all the cash that's going in and out of the company.
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_04: And many analysts and many investors that are intelligent and do their homework will
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_04: look at the cash flow statement and they will see the capex, they will see all the investments
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_04: going out and they will calculate a number typically called free cash flow that will allow
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_04: them to estimate the true cash generation of the business in a particular period and make
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_04: an assessment of should they be valued on free cash flow or should they be valued on the
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_04: gap standard of EBITDA and the investor has the choice on how they want to value the company.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_04: And Burie is incorrect in thinking that they're hiding anything because it's all there,
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_04: they're following gap standards and then investors make a market and they all decide what
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_04: do I want to value this company on cash flow EBITDA, let them choose and then the market sets
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_04: the price.
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_04: I think we've given this guy way too much airtime.
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_06: He's not very good at what he does.
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_06: I mean, I'm sorry, but like, come on the program, Burie, we'd left a double click on it.
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_03: Is there any other random person out there on the internet you want to take?
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_06: Let's just, I mean, he should be involved to like generate numbers and names.
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_06: I would say that there's a lot of people who think highly of his analysis.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_03: Doesn't mean they're right.
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_03: Of course, but I think it could be a good conversation.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_03: You know, we've never had on the pod stand, Druck and Miller.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_06: Let's get drunk before we get Michael Brack.
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_06: Both of them.
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_06: I mean, why are we choosing here?
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_03: Google released Gemini 3.
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_03: It's pretty great.
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_03: They regain the lead on most of the benchmarks.
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_03: Polymarket now has Google at 89% to finish the year as the top LLM and all the speculation
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_03: that Google was going to have their search franchise absolutely slaughtered by ChatGPT
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_03: has turned out to not be true, at least not this year, with their searches going up.
[00:35:53] SPEAKER_03: We're having you going up.
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_03: But the big story of speculation around Gemini 3 being trained only on Google's TPUs,
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_03: not in videos, GPUs or thoughts, Jama.
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_03: I think TPU is an incredible product on bias, but I think it's an incredible architecture.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_06: This latest spin is very profound, but I also think that what we are quickly seeing is
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_06: that there's going to be a highly fragmented layer of decoding chips that exist in the marketplace.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_06: GROC is one, TPU is one, Microsoft has a spin, Amazon has an Infrarentia.
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_06: Facebook, I think, is apparently spinning up their own silicon.
[00:36:33] So we're going to get to disaggregated decode pretty quickly.
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_06: The question is, who will win?
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_06: There will be a bunch of different solutions.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_06: I think what's incredible about Google is, I don't know if you saw the stats,
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_06: but they went from like 8% share to like 16% share of the entire Chat market
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_06: as of like this last month.
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_06: That's an incredible stat on the enterprise side and Propic is just absolutely crushing.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_06: So what are we seeing?
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_06: We're seeing a nascent market get created.
[00:37:04] We saw an allocation of traffic that basically favored one company over everyone.
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_06: And now we're starting to see a sorting function and a classifier.
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_06: In all of these different markets, it's like breaking apart, right?
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_06: There'll be winners in science, there'll be winners in enterprise level coding.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_06: There's going to be winners on the Chat side.
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_06: And where are the advantages going to be?
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_06: On the enterprise side, it's going to be model quality and
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_06: the Propics is excellent.
[00:37:29] On the Chat side, it's probably going to pivot around your existing inherent distribution.
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_06: Which is operating system, which is your browser, which is your phone,
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_03: which is Apple and Google and Microsoft.
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_06: Yeah, the only thing that I would push back on what you said though is that
[00:37:44] I agree that Google has done an absolutely incredible job in defending search.
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_06: But I think what this creates is the setup where now they can cannibalize themselves
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_06: versus having their market cannibalized for them.
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_06: That's still going to be a very tough decision for Google to make.
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_06: And it's going to happen.
[00:38:04] SPEAKER_06: I'm going to take the other side of it.
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_03: I think what's going to happen is the AI gains in advertising targeting.
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_03: And the number of searches is going to go up.
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_03: So while the revenue per search might go down, the number of searches goes up.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_03: And then the targeting goes up.
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_03: So I'm going to take the other side of it.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_03: I think the search franchise is going to grow and that Google is not going to lose to
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_03: the chat GPT.
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_03: And I think the big loser in all this is going to be open AI because they started with
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_03: 100% of the market.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_03: And they're only going down and they're facing a Google firing on all cylinders,
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_03: Anthropic and GROC beating them in the leaderboards pretty consistently.
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_03: So I think the short in all of this, if you were going to put on the pair trade,
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_03: is short open AI, which I think is overvalued and is going to go down.
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_03: And I think I would be long Google GROC and Anthropic.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_03: I think that they're going to have many challenges.
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_03: So I don't think the startup community, I'll just add this as my final thought on it.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_03: The startup community is not trusting open AI with their data.
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_03: If you use open AI and you see them releasing products like Sora, if you were in the space
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_03: of doing image generation social networking, why would you trust open AI with your data?
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_03: If you're doing a cursor and open AI has that product, they're not going to trust
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_03: them.
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_03: They're going to go with a model like Anthropic, which is taking a more neutral, we're
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_03: not going to go to the application level.
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_03: And they're also using deep seek and open source models again, because they don't want
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_03: to give their data and their advantage over to a person in enabling somebody who might
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_03: compete with them.
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_03: Let me just, yeah, go ahead.
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_03: Make two comments.
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_03: Sure.
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_04: Number one is, I think what we will see over time is probably a differentiation of general
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_04: purpose workhorses in chip architecture to more of these kind of special purpose chips
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_04: that work well with certain models and certain applications.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_04: You can kind of think about inference in machine vision and robotics.
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_04: You don't necessarily need an H100 to do that.
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_04: You can use a purpose built chip to do that in a way that reduces power cost, reduces
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_04: your ultimate capital cost to deploy that in an edge environment.
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_04: In the core data center environment, you may end up having models that are different
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_04: for graph neural nets versus LLMs.
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_04: There are going to be different chips that will likely fit very differently with different
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_04: architectures.
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_04: I would say that the general workhorse is what we had, but now that everyone's making
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_04: these investments and you should expect that the investment dollars in chip design is only
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_04: going to ramp up, not down.
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_04: There's going to be differentiated chips for different markets and different applications.
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_04: That's where there's a risk to Nvidia.
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_04: The other kind of, who do you think is the best chance of challenging Nvidia?
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_04: This is where I was going to go.
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_04: The other black swan that I think is missing in the equation today, and my early prediction
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_04: for 2026 is Huawei, where I think that there's lithography technology that exists in China
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_04: that is not publicly discussed, that is going to be deployed in Huawei and all these
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_04: fabs that they're building in mainland China.
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_04: Huawei can create at a very low cost, probably very high volume, and probably in reasonably
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_04: short order chips that can start to rival for certain market applications, chips that might
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_04: be expensive and long-
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_04: Give the time line for that.
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_04: Two years, three years out.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_03: I think that's going to start to make announcements.
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_04: By the way, remember, chip architecture, and even Jensen's talked about this, is being
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_04: redesigned with AI.
[00:41:31] SPEAKER_04: AI can design better chips.
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_04: So announcements 2026 impact 2027?
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_03: Probably fair.
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_03: Sure.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_03: Great.
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_06: Love it.
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_06: Is this what it'll be like when we have to be in a studio?
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_06: When we get to this level of scale where our show actually matters?
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_06: I mean, we could be in a studio together.
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_03: We'd have to...
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_03: The show would have never happened.
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_03: Or worked.
[00:41:53] Yeah.
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_03: I mean, you have four people with actual schedules and jobs.
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_03: It's not like we do this for a living.
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_03: What do you do?
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_03: No.
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_03: I mean, I invest in a hundred companies in here.
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_03: Not well, but I'm saying to do it.
[00:42:03] No, I mean...
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_03: You could have carved out the time the rest of us actually have jobs.
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_06: No, actually, I literally just got back from watching Founder University in...
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_03: There's what I'm saying.
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_03: Watching.
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_03: That's a keyword, watching.
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_06: You didn't say doing.
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_06: You said watching Founder University in Tokyo, thanks to my partners there.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_03: Did you watch Got The Plug?
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_03: And investing in a hundred, 150 companies per year and launching the fifth launch fund
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_03: next year.
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_03: So go to launch.co and you can email me anytime.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_03: And just a bit of a contribution from you, by the way, recently.
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_03: Yes, good.
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_03: And that's your first fund.
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_03: It's like five, six X now.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it was on eight billion.
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_03: Watch your top fund.
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_03: Have you hit a five X fund yet?
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_03: Okay, great.
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_03: Well, to the club.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_06: Well, to the club.
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_06: It was on 500 million.
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_06: Okay, great.
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_03: Awesome.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_03: It's actually more than a five X.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_03: Okay, great.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_03: I'm happy for you.
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_03: I'm happy for you.
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_03: I should have just done it with all my own money.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_03: That is actually the question.
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_03: I mean, that a lot of people have.
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_03: Do you feel you're a better investor when you're...
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_03: investing your money or do you think you're better when you have the discipline of having to report into LPs?
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_03: It's actually a good question.
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_03: My returns have been better when I've been by myself.
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_06: But I think that there is something really valuable about working for other people,
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_06: which it does keep you accountable.
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_06: I mean, what's happened is my dispersion has increased massively, investing on my own,
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_06: which means I cut the losers off far longer than I would have if I was running a fund,
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_06: because I think what I signed up for when I was running a fund was never lose money.
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_06: Ever.
[00:43:29] And return the money as quickly as possible and then run the upside.
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_06: And so I would have traded a seven X with high vol for a guaranteed three and three and a half X,
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_06: because I think that was my responsibility as the GP,
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_06: because my LPs were memorial Sloan-Kettering, the Mayo Clinic.
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_06: I wanted to give them the money back because they have programs.
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_06: Right.
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_06: And it's not my job to hold the money back.
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_06: With myself, I can keep it out, so then the ups are higher, but then the lows are also lower.
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_06: Yes.
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_06: Because some of these things just get annihilated, like look, like relativity space,
[00:44:03] SPEAKER_06: you know, I took a $400 million goose egg.
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
[00:44:08] And this is the challenge for you, Bernie.
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_03: Eric Schmidt shows up and he's like, here, it's a billion dollars paid to play,
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_06: and I'm like, okay, I'm not going to do it.
[00:44:13] SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_03: So, go.
[00:44:15] SPEAKER_03: You had a venture studio for a little while.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_03: You had to deal with outside investors now.
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_03: You're obviously in the driver's seat CEO of A Hollow.
[00:44:21] You also had that pressure.
[00:44:23] SPEAKER_03: You have to answer to LPs.
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_03: Did it make you better at the job?
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_03: Or did it make you do?
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_03: Not so do.
[00:44:28] Same investor.
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_04: My venture studio owns the majority of A Hollow.
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_04: So, just so it's our biggest driver of value.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_04: So I'm spending all my time on a Hollow.
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_04: Do you run the production board still?
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_06: Are there investments that you need?
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_06: I'm on a few other boards.
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_06: But no active investment.
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_06: I'm not doing any new investing.
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_06: Actually, a lot of folks moved into A Hollow or moved out to stop doing new investing.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_04: And then slowly, we're kind of, as we have a liquidity event, we'll do a distribution.
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_04: But the goal is for TPP to end up being a holding company with just A Hollow.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_04: And that's where all the value is going to come from.
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_04: So we actually just did a distribution.
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_04: And then we're going to do kind of distributions as we have other kind of events for the other things that are in our portfolio.
[00:45:08] SPEAKER_04: And then we'll just focus on a Hollow.
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_04: When you came into this venture studio model, did you anticipate,
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_03: which is what most people do anticipate with venture studios, that you'd have one break out?
[00:45:20] SPEAKER_03: And you would go all in on that.
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_04: I was delusional.
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_04: Okay.
[00:45:24] In 2011, two years before I sold Climate Corp, I started a company called MetroMile.
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_04: I was the chairman of the board of the company.
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_04: I hired an outside CEO, fired him in a year, promoted the CTO to the CEO.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_04: For years, I worked with him as the chairman of the board.
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_04: I invested close to 10 million of my own money in this company, spent years on it.
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_04: It had raised a Series B, a Series C, Series D, was doing great.
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_04: I'm like, man, this is awesome.
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_04: I can be a chairman, not a CEO, run these companies.
[00:45:53] SPEAKER_04: This goes great, scaled to like whatever it was, a hundred million of revenue.
[00:45:56] SPEAKER_04: I started ETSA, which as you guys recall, was this Keenwaw Fast Food Restaurant.
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_04: Robotic as well.
[00:46:02] SPEAKER_04: Robotic, you were running your head here.
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_04: You were way ahead of your time.
[00:46:04] SPEAKER_04: I put three million of my own capital in the business.
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_04: And then I had a CEO run it.
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_04: And then we raised outside money, which I was not planning to do in that business.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_04: And I'm like, man, I am so good at starting companies and being a chairman.
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_04: This is what I should do.
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_04: And that's what led me to start the venture studio.
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_04: Both those companies ended up being net negative returners for me.
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_04: And over time, many of the other projects that I was a founder of,
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_04: but chairman of, didn't succeed financially.
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_04: And over my years being on boards, I realized how frustrating it was to be on a board,
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_04: where you would tell a CEO a bunch of stuff.
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_04: They wouldn't listen.
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_04: They would do whatever they wanted to do.
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_04: I was frustrated pulling my hair out, watching them do things I wouldn't do.
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_04: Not doing the things I would do.
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_04: So after many years of failure, after failure, I realized, you know,
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_04: this was the moment where we had this amazing outcome, series of outcomes at O'Holo.
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_04: And it was a research project for several years.
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_04: We put close to $40 million into this project before these results started to come in.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_04: I'm like, holy s**t, this is the game changing business of my career.
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_04: This is the power law.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_04: And that's when I made the decision.
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_04: I'm going to go all in on this and I'm going to run it as CEO.
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_04: How do you piece take that and how do you communicate it to them?
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_04: Everyone is very supportive and very active.
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_04: They were like, this is exactly what we always hope you would do with defined a winner.
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_04: And I never thought that that's what I would do.
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_04: Because I swore after I stole a climate court, I swore I would never be a CEO again.
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_04: It's too stressful.
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_04: It was damaging to my health.
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_04: It's like overwhelming.
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_04: I'm so into it.
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_04: I cannot stop building the business.
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_04: It just, it consumes me.
[00:47:31] SPEAKER_04: Everything about it, I have to win.
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_04: I have to make the business an ultra success.
[00:47:34] SPEAKER_04: It consumes me.
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_04: And I knew that it would happen to me again.
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_04: And I've got kids and all this stuff.
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_04: So I had to really like dig deep to make the decision to do it.
[00:47:43] SPEAKER_04: And actually, you know what changed my mind about this was I saw the movie Oppenheimer.
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_04: And I'm in IMAX and I left that movie and I cried.
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_04: And I realized I wasn't doing what I should be doing with my life by being, you know, this board member who was useless.
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_04: And I'm like, what am I doing here?
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_04: And I said, I'm going to make this, and I've been thinking about this.
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_04: And I'm like, that's it.
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_04: I'm, I tip me over and I made a decision to step in and CEO.
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_04: So yeah, the LPs, the investors were all thrilled because they had all said like, we hope you would run something one day.
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_04: And then more capital came in and we've been running a hollow for, it's been two years now, this month.
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_04: That I've been running a hollow as CEO.
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_04: And I'm really happy I did it.
[00:48:15] SPEAKER_04: That's incredible.
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_04: Inspiring, Chimoff, would you like to mock Freeberg for crying at Oppenheimer in any way?
[00:48:21] I saw you killing me now.
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_04: In tune, I was like, yeah.
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_04: Great movie, by the way.
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_04: I cried when I got married.
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_05: I got my kids for boarder.
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:48:32] He cried at the hyper.
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_05: He's like, oh my god, he's playing piano.
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_05: Do you ever ask yourself what I do with my life?
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_04: Like, do you ever think like, hey, the impact I thought I would have in my life?
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_04: That there's a missing piece to that.
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_04: There's something that I didn't accomplish.
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_04: That I always expected I would.
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_04: That there's something I didn't achieve as a person.
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_04: And then you see these kind of extraordinary outcomes that others do and you're like, man, what was I doing?
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_04: What am I doing with my life?
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_04: What am I doing?
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_04: I think that's a pretty profound insight you had.
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_03: And it sounds like you made the right decision.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_03: All right, next up on the program, one of our favorite human beings.
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_03: You know the intellectual life's next program.
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_03: The only, the man of the poker tables and the mench in our poker group, Alan Gideon.
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_03: Alan Gideon.
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_03: Good to see you brother.
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_03: Thank you for the kind introduction.
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_01: Have a seat. Have a seat.
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_03: Have a seat.
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_01: You said next to me.
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_01: Oh good, good, good.
[00:49:20] SPEAKER_01: Now, Alan, just like at dinner last night.
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_04: You were right.
[00:49:24] SPEAKER_04: Let me eat you.
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_04: Let me eat you.
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_01: So let me do what you wanted at dinner last night.
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_03: Hold on.
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_03: Let me just do proper attacks with you anytime you stand to Alan Gideon is.
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_03: We'll get to it.
[00:49:32] SPEAKER_03: Alan Gideon just talked about it.
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_03: Alan Gideon just talked about it to YouTube.
[00:49:36] SPEAKER_03: Watch a bunch of Alan Keating clips.
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_03: Alan, very important.
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_03: Here are fours.
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_03: Here are fours.
[00:49:41] SPEAKER_03: That's what I call him.
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_03: Here are fours.
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_03: Alan Keating.
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_03: I saw that.
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_03: I was in Crowley.
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_03: Alan Keating ran the high stakes game here.
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_03: The elite big game for many years.
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_03: Then he started investing in companies.
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_03: He was the seed investor in a little company known as Polymarket.
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_03: And he's gotten into our friend group.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_03: He didn't know how many years ago, Chimathi brought him in.
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_03: And he fit right in.
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_03: And we started handing out 10 years ago.
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_03: And we got to know him in that time.
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_03: He also started to play high stakes on TV.
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_03: Stop running the big game here in Vegas.
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_03: And on TV, you're known for playing way above the rim in a way that,
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_03: to call it non-traditional, would be an understatement.
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_03: Take us through.
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_03: No.
[00:50:28] No.
[00:50:29] Okay.
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_03: You want to...
[00:50:31] Yeah.
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_03: Look.
[00:50:33] Yeah.
[00:50:34] SPEAKER_03: Chimathi looks playing your career.
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_06: Keating.
[00:50:36] Listen up.
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_06: Keating at his core is an exceptional player.
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_06: Not a traditional, like, you know, you'll see these some of the other guys
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_06: who are more solver oriented.
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_06: But Keating has incredible, incredible libraries.
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_06: Kind of like a modern, younger generation of Helmuth.
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_06: I mean, Helmuth has good libraries, but now, you know, he's like an aging horse.
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_06: We're going to have to...
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_06: We're going to send him to the glue factory soon.
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_06: But Keating is in his prime.
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_06: And what he can do is he can soul-read people,
[00:51:06] SPEAKER_06: which when you're playing at the high stakes, honestly, that's all that matters,
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_06: because you can't play solver-based at the stakes in which we play.
[00:51:13] SPEAKER_06: You're just going to get run over.
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_06: And that's why you see him being able to do these things,
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_06: because everybody else steps into the game.
[00:51:20] They're like a deer in the headlights.
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_06: They're so afraid.
[00:51:23] And he is very comfortable.
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_06: You see it and he can pick people off, like when he picked off Doug Polk with a four.
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_06: How does that happen?
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_06: It's because he can soul-read people, and he's a tune to play this game.
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_06: Keating crew-off, can you soul-read people?
[00:51:38] Yeah, I think I'm a navigating fear on the poker table better than most.
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_01: So I think when people are afraid they tend to give things away
[00:51:51] SPEAKER_01: or get scared or act different, and I'm trying to...
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_01: Get myself comfortable.
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_01: The problem with the Doug Polk hand was that he f*** up the bed sizing on the turn.
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
[00:52:00] SPEAKER_06: He ships the turn you fold.
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_06: He puts himself in a horrible situation where he's beforting the river.
[00:52:06] I mean, you just soul-read it.
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_01: And it was great.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_01: It was incredible.
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_01: There were a few different tells that I...
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_01: It was incredible.
[00:52:13] SPEAKER_01: I wonder if I should...
[00:52:14] I'll get into it, but...
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_01: Look it down, because these guys...
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_06: But I think this is important, because a lot of people think poker became
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_04: solved because of computers and AI.
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_04: Everyone uses trainers now.
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_04: But to your point, to Chimaz Point, like they're still at the core of the elite level of the game,
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_04: very much a tell and psychology.
[00:52:32] SPEAKER_04: We'll get Nick to play picture and picture this hand.
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_06: How big was a plot?
[00:52:36] SPEAKER_06: And the end million something?
[00:52:38] No, probably 600.
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_01: 600, okay.
[00:52:42] Doug Polk, who's a phenomenal heads-up player, had Ace King.
[00:52:46] SPEAKER_01: Like the best in the world.
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_06: You like a ding dong head?
[00:52:48] Four two.
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_01: Four two.
[00:52:50] It's playable?
[00:52:51] It's a 75-hands.
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_05: It's a 75-hands.
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_05: It's a 75-hands.
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_05: It's a 75-hands.
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_05: It's somehow...
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_05: It's a good one.
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_06: It's a good one.
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_01: It's a good one.
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_01: It's a raised flop.
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_01: It was like 150 on the flop.
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_06: 75-3.
[00:53:05] SPEAKER_01: 35-3.
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_01: 75-all-in.
[00:53:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:53:09] Okay, so take us behind the end.
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_06: What's the read?
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_06: And why are you playing 2-4 to begin with?
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_03: Why don't you explain that to the...
[00:53:15] SPEAKER_03: He was a big boy watching, yeah.
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_03: Explain the thinking there because a lot of people are...
[00:53:20] SPEAKER_03: Let him talk.
[00:53:21] I...
[00:53:22] You know, a lot of people want to...
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_01: Like you said, put everything into a solver and reduce something into a vacuum
[00:53:29] SPEAKER_01: and navigate that situation.
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_01: And I don't really have a passion for that.
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_01: I have a passion for what's happening in this moment.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_01: What's happening with this person?
[00:53:38] SPEAKER_01: What's happening with me?
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_01: What are they perceiving me as?
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, in that moment, Doug had gotten some confidence around a couple of hands.
[00:53:48] SPEAKER_01: And there was a player in between that I knew he didn't think much of his hand.
[00:53:53] SPEAKER_01: And he didn't think much of my hand.
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_01: And it seemed like an obvious situation for him to pull it away from me.
[00:53:59] SPEAKER_01: And I thought about re-raising all-in,
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_01: pre-flop, just to simplify it.
[00:54:06] SPEAKER_01: And I think that was probably a better way to do it.
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_01: But, at the same time, I do a lot of things for the fun of it.
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_01: And I thought it'd be a little bit more fun to get him in a spot later on a couple of streets down
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_01: where I could, you know, bluff him out or call him down.
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_01: So did he have a tell on the turn?
[00:54:25] SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
[00:54:26] Yeah, he goes 75,000, like kind of directly.
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_01: And about an hour and a half before then, he had the same tonality, same cadence.
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_01: And he was just stealing the situation.
[00:54:40] SPEAKER_01: And there was just a myriad of things where it was like,
[00:54:45] that might be something, I'm not sure.
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_01: That might be something I'm not sure.
[00:54:49] SPEAKER_01: Well, here's a lot of things that might be something.
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_01: And I'm pretty sure that the combination of them leads into this.
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_01: What happens if you call any shows pocket jacks or something?
[00:54:59] So, you know, and then do you, like in those spots where you call off and you lose,
[00:55:05] how do you process losing $700,000 that way?
[00:55:08] SPEAKER_06: Do you think this is so stupid?
[00:55:10] SPEAKER_06: Why did I do that?
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_06: Or do you, are you saying, what's the self-talk?
[00:55:14] SPEAKER_06: What's the internal monologue?
[00:55:16] I don't know.
[00:55:17] SPEAKER_01: I guess, I don't know where it came from, but I wanted to always kind of have a sense of humor around whatever happens to me.
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_01: You know, the things I can't control, the things I can't control.
[00:55:27] SPEAKER_01: You know, if I put myself in a spot, I've gotten to a point where I can immediately recognize how ridiculous what I just did was and kind of laugh about it.
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_01: And be okay with it.
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_06: Yeah, yeah, sure.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: So, like, you're forgiving yourself during the hand?
[00:55:42] Yeah, there'll be like an internal part that's just like, yeah, of course that's stupid.
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_01: So, to be able to pull off the hands you pull off, you have to have a, I don't give a shit kind of attitude about this is all a game.
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_04: I don't take it too seriously because that's where fear comes from.
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_04: It's about mastering the fear.
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think I just recognize that people make bad decisions when they're scared.
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_01: And that's why I like...
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_01: But sorry, say that again, mastering fear.
[00:56:07] SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_06: You put in reps.
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_06: How do you put in reps to master fear?
[00:56:10] SPEAKER_06: You just...
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_01: Because that extends to many other things in life.
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_06: Right, absolutely.
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_01: Like, we talked about this in investing and, you know, different strategies about how big of a bet you want to make relative to your bankroll and venture and stuff like that.
[00:56:23] SPEAKER_01: Well, I like making the bet where if it doesn't work out, I'm in a little bit of trouble.
[00:56:28] SPEAKER_01: You like to feel the pain.
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_04: Oh, you like that, you like feels real.
[00:56:33] Yeah, it's a motivator.
[00:56:34] SPEAKER_01: It's something that drives.
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_01: And I like...
[00:56:37] SPEAKER_01: Just like, poker, I'll put myself in the same time.
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_01: Just like two years ago, Keating calls me, he's like, hey, this is like about portfolio construction and like a specific company we won't say the company.
[00:56:46] Talk for a f***ing hour.
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_06: And I'm trying to give him my best advice.
[00:56:49] SPEAKER_06: Look, here's how you structure it to minimize volatility.
[00:56:52] SPEAKER_06: You know, take some of these chips off the table, do this, do that.
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_06: He goes, I really appreciate this, calls me two days later.
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_06: Yeah, so I doubled down on this thing.
[00:56:59] Put it on.
[00:57:00] Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:57:02] SPEAKER_01: Throw a marker towards calling him a head-drawn out, don't mean nothing.
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_01: You don't know this, but I've tripled down.
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_02: Well, here's what you're saying.
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_04: What was your purpose on calling him then?
[00:57:10] SPEAKER_04: So if you felt that that was where you were going to go, why are you checking it?
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_04: Well, you're trying to check your sanity or like, what were you doing there?
[00:57:17] Why do you check it?
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_01: I'm inviting him to the deep bend.
[00:57:20] I'm saying, I'm asking why he called you.
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_04: I'm asking why you called you to the top of the post.
[00:57:27] SPEAKER_04: No, I'm asking why you called you to the top of the post.
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_04: In that situation where you're going to double down, triple down, you really don't know.
[00:57:32] SPEAKER_04: I've access to someone that's like infinitely smarter than me at the thing that I'm trying to understand.
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_04: You're jumping in the deep bend.
[00:57:39] SPEAKER_04: Yes, yes.
[00:57:40] SPEAKER_01: Why are you asking him, like, should I jump in the deep bend first?
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_04: Because I want to earmark all the reasoning.
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to understand everything about this decision because I'm going to live without
[00:57:52] SPEAKER_01: coming to that decision no matter what.
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_01: So I want to remember his take, my take, my feelings, other people's thoughts.
[00:58:00] SPEAKER_01: And I want to put that into like a little bit of folder that I could come back to.
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_01: You unconsciously, or you've discovered something which is referred to as super forecasting in like behavioral sciences,
[00:58:13] SPEAKER_03: which is if you write down and you understand all the permutations of your decision making,
[00:58:19] and then you reflect on it years from now, you'll just be better at decision making.
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_03: So that's actually what you're doing.
[00:58:24] SPEAKER_03: And I think it just comes natural to you.
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_03: And you were going to say when you thought the question was about the poke and about inviting him to the deep end.
[00:58:31] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:58:32] SPEAKER_03: Unpack that concept of saying, hey, we both know that this is this hands out of control.
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_03: We're in the deep, dark waters.
[00:58:41] SPEAKER_03: There could be sharks in there.
[00:58:43] SPEAKER_03: Explain what you're doing.
[00:58:45] SPEAKER_03: Because I've been in hands with you where I feel like you just dragged me out to the deep water,
[00:58:50] SPEAKER_03: where I've got jacks or queens and then all of a sudden I'm going to be playing for my entire stack.
[00:58:54] SPEAKER_03: And they don't feel good anymore.
[00:58:56] SPEAKER_03: Even though I have an overpair to the board or whatever it is.
[00:58:59] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:59:00] SPEAKER_03: I just think there's some purity or beauty in the chaos after everyone's...
[00:59:09] SPEAKER_01: After you get past where everyone's prepared.
[00:59:12] And I'm interested in that space.
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_01: And I have no interests in the space that everyone's prepared.
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_01: Everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face.
[00:59:20] SPEAKER_03: Because...
[00:59:21] SPEAKER_03: You remind me of Alex, you're the Alex Honel de Poker.
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_03: Alex Honel is the guy who...
[00:59:25] SPEAKER_03: Oh my god.
[00:59:26] SPEAKER_03: Oh my gosh.
[00:59:27] SPEAKER_03: What is this more than that?
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh.
[00:59:29] SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh.
[00:59:30] SPEAKER_02: What is this more than that?
[00:59:31] SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh.
[00:59:32] SPEAKER_02: What is this more than that?
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_02: What is this more than that?
[00:59:34] SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh.
[00:59:35] SPEAKER_02: What is this more than that?
[00:59:36] SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh.
[00:59:37] SPEAKER_02: What is this?
[00:59:38] SPEAKER_02: What is this?
[00:59:39] SPEAKER_02: Catch me or...
[00:59:40] SPEAKER_05: Oh my gosh.
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_05: Catch me.
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_05: And look, guys.
[00:59:43] SPEAKER_05: How many of us decided for this special occasion, what does he or she taping all in for the first time in Vegas?
[00:59:48] SPEAKER_03: How many of us decided to wear a track suit that's only 12 years old?
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_03: He was one of his newer tracksuits.
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_03: A few years ago at Hellmuth birthday, we each chipped in, I think, three grand, to buy him a new wardrobe.
[00:59:59] SPEAKER_04: There was like 70,000 in total.
[01:00:02] SPEAKER_06: Yeah, there were 20 of us.
[01:00:03] SPEAKER_06: And we put in three grand.
[01:00:04] SPEAKER_04: We put in three grand.
[01:00:06] SPEAKER_04: Remember the old rack of clothes?
[01:00:07] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he has a single thing.
[01:00:09] SPEAKER_04: He doesn't want to single thing all to his side.
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_04: No, no, no, this shirt you guys bought for me.
[01:00:13] SPEAKER_02: I will say this between, no hold on, between that wall,
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_02: between that wall and that wall.
[01:00:18] SPEAKER_02: You guys gave me all the ton of clothes.
[01:00:21] SPEAKER_04: No, no, I gave him to my sons.
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
[01:00:24] SPEAKER_03: All right, sit down.
[01:00:26] SPEAKER_03: Phil, please sit down.
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_03: I gotta close the show.
[01:00:28] SPEAKER_03: Hold on.
