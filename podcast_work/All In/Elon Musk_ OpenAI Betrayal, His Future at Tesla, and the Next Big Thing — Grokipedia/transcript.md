[00:00:00] Let's get started. You know, we wanted to try something new this week.
[00:00:04] Every week, you know, I get a little upset. Things perturb me.
[00:00:08] David Sacks: Sacks and when it does, I just yell and scream.
[00:00:12] David Sacks: Disgrace, yeah. And so I bought the domain name,
[00:00:14] David Sacks: Disgrace.com for no reason other than my own amusement. But you know what? I'm not alone
[00:00:20] in my absolute
[00:00:21] David Sacks: disgust at what's going on in the world. So this week
[00:00:25] we're gonna bring out a new feature here on the All in Podcast. Disgrace, yeah, I'd corner.
[00:00:30] Disgrace, yeah.
[00:00:32] David Sacks: He was the best guy around.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_03: What about the fully murdered?
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_03: What murder?
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_03: You can act like a man.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_03: He's just killed a man.
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_03: He insulted him a little bit.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_03: I'm mad. And I want to say.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_03: I'm sorry.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_06: Here was in the toilet water.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_06: Disco thing. I got a little.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_06: Okay, you little.
[00:00:54] Disgrace.
[00:00:56] Ah!
[00:00:58] David Sacks: Disgrace, yeah.
[00:01:00] David Sacks: This is fantastic. This is our new feature.
[00:01:05] Chimoff, you look like you're ready to go.
[00:01:08] Why don't you tell you tell everybody who gets your dysgrace, yeah.
[00:01:12] Wait, we all had to come with a dysgrace.
[00:01:14] Jason Calacanis: You really?
[00:01:15] David Sacks: First time he's like, you missed a memo.
[00:01:17] David Sacks: All right, fine. I know. I got one. I got one.
[00:01:20] Jason Calacanis: Okay, I just come down.
[00:01:21] Jason Calacanis: My dysgrace, yeah, corner goes to Jason Calcanus.
[00:01:24] Jason Calacanis: Here we go. Come on.
[00:01:25] Jason Calacanis: Man, you can't.
[00:01:26] Jason Calacanis: And people to judge where they in the first 30 seconds of the interview,
[00:01:31] Jason Calacanis: compared virtue signaling points about how each one worked
[00:01:35] Jason Calacanis: at various moments at Amnesty International.
[00:01:38] Jason Calacanis: Absolutely.
[00:01:39] Jason Calacanis: Literally affecting zero change,
[00:01:41] Jason Calacanis: making no progress in the world.
[00:01:43] Jason Calacanis: But collecting a badge that they used to hold over other people.
[00:01:46] Jason Calacanis: Disgrace.
[00:01:47] Jason Calacanis: There's a lot of letters.
[00:01:47] Jason Calacanis: We wrote a lot of letters.
[00:01:48] David Sacks: Disgrace, yeah.
[00:01:49] David Sacks: Which is good. That means it's like a good one.
[00:01:51] David Sacks: Disgrace, yeah.
[00:01:52] David Sacks: Find the scenes.
[00:01:53] David Sacks: Disgrace, yeah.
[00:01:53] David Sacks: Jason Calcanus and people to judge.
[00:01:55] David Sacks: Disgrace, yeah.
[00:01:56] David Sacks: Great. I'm glad that I get the first one.
[00:01:57] David Sacks: And you can imagine what's coming next week for you.
[00:02:00] David Sacks: I saw the Sydney,
[00:02:02] David Sacks: Swini dress today trending on social.
[00:02:05] Disgrace, yeah.
[00:02:06] David Sacks: It's too much.
[00:02:08] David Sacks: It's too much.
[00:02:09] David Sacks: What is it?
[00:02:10] David Sacks: I didn't even know what to say.
[00:02:11] David Sacks: You can see it.
[00:02:12] David Sacks: Next picture.
[00:02:13] David Sacks: Okay.
[00:02:13] David Sacks: Bring it up.
[00:02:14] David Sacks: It's a little floppy.
[00:02:14] David Sacks: Galvestito Echro Paul.
[00:02:16] David Sacks: How is this?
[00:02:17] David Sacks: Disgrace, yeah.
[00:02:18] David Sacks: What are you talking about?
[00:02:19] David Sacks: Much.
[00:02:19] David Sacks: It's disgraceful.
[00:02:20] David Sacks: A little bit of, like, look at this.
[00:02:23] David Sacks: Oh my God.
[00:02:24] David Sacks: Too much.
[00:02:24] David Sacks: It's only too much.
[00:02:26] David Sacks: In my day,
[00:02:26] David Sacks: Sacks, a little cleavage maybe.
[00:02:30] David Sacks: Perhaps in the 90s or 2000s,
[00:02:31] David Sacks: some side view.
[00:02:32] David Sacks: This is too much.
[00:02:33] David Sacks: Hey guy.
[00:02:38] Elon Musk: Great.
[00:02:38] Elon Musk: Hi, bro.
[00:02:38] Elon Musk: Subject met him.
[00:02:39] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:02:40] Sorry.
[00:02:41] We were discussing the role of politics.
[00:02:43] Elon Musk: And the Sydney Swini dress.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_02: I know it's trending on that.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_02: Hi dad.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_02: Hi dad.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_02: Put away the phone.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_02: Chase it.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_02: Oh my God.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_02: Oh my God.
[00:02:54] You're like your winner's ride.
[00:02:56] Bring man David Sack.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_03: I'm going on.
[00:03:01] And it said we open sources to the fans.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_03: And they've just got a reason.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_03: Love you guys.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_03: Nice.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_03: We don't get one.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_03: I'm going on.
[00:03:10] What's going on with the algorithm?
[00:03:11] David Sacks: I'm getting serious.
[00:03:12] David Sacks: We need to dress all day.
[00:03:13] David Sacks: And last, we have Sacks.
[00:03:15] David Sacks: Well, maybe you should stop every day.
[00:03:17] Elon Musk: Thank you.
[00:03:18] You're married in 15 times.
[00:03:20] David Sacks: And then Sacks.
[00:03:21] Elon Musk: Poor Sacks got, you got invited to Sluckcon
[00:03:24] David Sacks: for two weeks straight on the algorithm.
[00:03:26] David Sacks: Well, I say the algorithm has become,
[00:03:28] David Sacks: if you if you demonstrate,
[00:03:30] David Sacks: actually, right, you can even tell if that's a joke or a real thing.
[00:03:34] David Sacks: It's a real thing.
[00:03:35] David Sacks: It's all too real.
[00:03:36] David Sacks: It's actually really going.
[00:03:38] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:03:39] Elon Musk: What kind of is a real?
[00:03:41] What have you noticed?
[00:03:42] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:03:42] David Sacks: If you if you demonstrate interest.
[00:03:45] David Sacks: This is anything on X now.
[00:03:46] David Sacks: If you click on it, God forbid you like something.
[00:03:49] David Sacks: Man, yeah, it will give you more of that.
[00:03:53] David Sacks: It will give you a lot more.
[00:03:54] Elon Musk: Yes.
[00:03:55] Elon Musk: Yes.
[00:03:56] Elon Musk: So we we did have an issue.
[00:04:00] We still have some one of an issue where
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_04: there was an important bug that was picking out
[00:04:07] Elon Musk: that was solved over the weekend,
[00:04:09] Elon Musk: which caused in network post to be not shown.
[00:04:15] Elon Musk: So you basically if you followed someone,
[00:04:18] Elon Musk: you wouldn't see the wouldn't see that post.
[00:04:21] Elon Musk: God.
[00:04:22] Elon Musk: It's going to be a big bug.
[00:04:24] Elon Musk: And the better.
[00:04:24] Elon Musk: You did your bug.
[00:04:26] Then the algorithm was not probably taking into account.
[00:04:33] Elon Musk: If you just dwells on something.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: But if you if you interacted with it,
[00:04:41] Elon Musk: it would it would go hog wild.
[00:04:43] Elon Musk: So if you pay as David said, if you if you were to favor reply
[00:04:46] Elon Musk: or engage with it in some way,
[00:04:48] Elon Musk: it is going to give you a torrent of that same thing.
[00:04:52] Elon Musk: Oh, it's a fact.
[00:04:54] David Sacks: So maybe you'll say what was your interaction?
[00:04:57] David Sacks: Did you bookmarks like on I think your bookmark did?
[00:05:00] David Sacks: Here's what I thought was good about it though.
[00:05:02] David Sacks: Is all of a sudden.
[00:05:06] I would see if you haven't just on sweet 70s when he's boobs.
[00:05:08] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:05:09] Elon Musk: And you get a lot more of it.
[00:05:12] Yeah.
[00:05:13] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:05:15] David Sacks: But what I thought was good about it was that you would see who
[00:05:18] David Sacks: else had a take on the same subject matter.
[00:05:21] David Sacks: And that actually has been a useful part of it.
[00:05:25] Yeah.
[00:05:25] So you do you do get more of a you get more of like a 360 view
[00:05:29] David Sacks: on whatever it is that you shown interested.
[00:05:31] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:05:32] Yeah.
[00:05:33] Elon Musk: It just it's like it was giving you if you you take a you'd have
[00:05:38] Elon Musk: like it was just going too far obviously.
[00:05:40] Elon Musk: It was overcorrecting.
[00:05:41] Elon Musk: It had too much gain on just to get up the gain way too high.
[00:05:46] Elon Musk: Any interaction would you would then get a torrent of that.
[00:05:49] Elon Musk: It's like it's like oh you had a taste of it.
[00:05:52] Elon Musk: We're going to give you three helping.
[00:05:54] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:05:54] Elon Musk: We're going to force you.
[00:05:56] Elon Musk: We're going to give you the food funnel.
[00:05:59] Elon Musk: And that's all being done.
[00:06:00] Elon Musk: I assume it's all being done with Grock now.
[00:06:02] David Sacks: So it's not like the old hard code algorithm or is it using Grock?
[00:06:08] Well, what's happening is that we're gradually leading the legacy
[00:06:13] Elon Musk: Twitter heuristics.
[00:06:14] Elon Musk: Now the problem is that it's like I should leave these heuristics.
[00:06:17] Elon Musk: It turns out the one heuristic the one bug was covering for the other bug.
[00:06:22] Elon Musk: And so when you delete one side of the bug,
[00:06:24] Elon Musk: you know, it's like that that mean with the internet that where there's like
[00:06:27] Elon Musk: the spray complicated machine and there's like a tiny little wooden stick
[00:06:30] Elon Musk: that's that's going which was I guess Amazon AWS Easter or whatever.
[00:06:35] Elon Musk: Had something like that.
[00:06:36] Elon Musk: You know, when when when somebody pulled out the little stick
[00:06:41] Elon Musk: that was just.
[00:06:43] Elon Musk: I think it'd be good if it half of earth, you know, it would be great if it showed like one person you follow.
[00:06:49] David Sacks: And then like it blended the old style which was just
[00:06:54] David Sacks: reverse chronological of your friends the original version with this new version.
[00:06:59] David Sacks: So you get like a little bit of both.
[00:07:00] David Sacks: Well, you can still you still have the plot.
[00:07:02] Elon Musk: Everyone still has the following tab.
[00:07:05] Elon Musk: Yeah, now something we're going to be adding is the ability to have a curated following tab
[00:07:10] Elon Musk: because the problem is like if you follow some people and they're maybe a little more prolific
[00:07:14] Elon Musk: than your, you know, it's a double.
[00:07:18] You know, you follow someone and some people are are much more pro, you know, say a lot more than others.
[00:07:24] Elon Musk: That that makes the following tab hard to use.
[00:07:28] Elon Musk: So we're going to add up an option where you can have the following tab be curated.
[00:07:32] Elon Musk: So Rockle will say one of the most interesting things posted by your friends and we'll show you that in the following tab.
[00:07:40] Elon Musk: It will also be.
[00:07:42] Elon Musk: Yeah, everything.
[00:07:46] Elon Musk: But but I think having that option that will make the following tab much more useful.
[00:07:52] Elon Musk: So it'll be a curated list of people you follow like the ideally most interesting stuff that they've said,
[00:07:58] Elon Musk: which is kind of what you want to look at.
[00:08:00] Elon Musk: And then we've mostly fixed the bug, which would give you way too much of something if you interacted with a particular subject matter.
[00:08:11] Elon Musk: And then the really big change, which is where Rock literally reads everything that's posted to the platform.
[00:08:20] Elon Musk: Which we're actually there's about a hundred million posts per day.
[00:08:27] Elon Musk: So there's a hundred million pieces of content per day.
[00:08:30] And I think that's actually just maybe just an English and I think it goes beyond that.
[00:08:35] Elon Musk: It's outside of English.
[00:08:37] Elon Musk: So Grogg is going to we're going to start off reading the really what what Grogg thinks are the top 10 million of the hundred million.
[00:08:46] Elon Musk: And it will actually read them and understand them and categorize them and match them to users.
[00:08:54] It's like this is this is not a job humans could ever do.
[00:08:58] And then once that is together we'll we'll we'll add the entire hundred million a day.
[00:09:04] So it's literally going to read through a hundred million things and and and and and show you the things that it thinks out of a hundred million.
[00:09:12] Elon Musk: Post per day.
[00:09:13] Elon Musk: What are the most interesting.
[00:09:15] Elon Musk: Post to you.
[00:09:16] Elon Musk: How much of colossus will that take a lot of work?
[00:09:19] David Sacks: Yeah, that's like is it tens of thousands of servers like to do that every day?
[00:09:25] David Sacks: Yeah, my guess is it's probably on the order of 50k H 100 something like that.
[00:09:29] Elon Musk: Wow. And that will replace search so you'll be able to actually search on Twitter and find things in like with a with a plan language.
[00:09:39] We'll have semantic search where you can just ask a question.
[00:09:42] Elon Musk: And it will show you all content whether that is text pictures or video that matches your search query semantically.
[00:09:51] Elon Musk: How how's it been three years in this is that he was a three year anniversary like a couple of years.
[00:09:56] Jason Calacanis: Three years.
[00:09:58] Yeah, remember was Halloween.
[00:10:01] Yeah, Halloween's back.
[00:10:03] Halloween's back, but it was the week and you took over was Halloween.
[00:10:09] Yeah.
[00:10:12] David Sacks: Good time.
[00:10:12] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:10:15] Yeah, three years.
[00:10:17] We will things three years from now.
[00:10:20] Yeah, what's the takeaway three years later you were you're obviously don't regret buying it.
[00:10:27] David Sacks: It's safe free speech.
[00:10:28] David Sacks: That was good.
[00:10:29] David Sacks: It seemed to have turned that holding around.
[00:10:30] David Sacks: That was I think a big part of your mission.
[00:10:33] David Sacks: But then you added it to X AI, which makes it incredibly valuable as a data source.
[00:10:38] David Sacks: So when you look back on it, the reason you bought it to stop crazy woke mind virus and a truth exists in the world again.
[00:10:47] David Sacks: Great mission accomplished.
[00:10:49] David Sacks: And now it has a future.
[00:10:51] David Sacks: Yeah, we've got community notes.
[00:10:53] Elon Musk: You can also ask rock any anything you see on the platform.
[00:10:57] Elon Musk: You know, just just press the rock icon on any X post and will analyze analyze it for you.
[00:11:03] Elon Musk: And research it as much as you want so you can you can basically have just by tapping the rock icon you can.
[00:11:10] Elon Musk: Assess the.
[00:11:12] Elon Musk: Whether that that post is the truth, the whole truth or nothing but the truth or whether there's something supplemental you need to be explained.
[00:11:19] Elon Musk: So I think it's actually we made a lot of progress towards.
[00:11:23] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:11:25] Freedom of speech and and and and people being able to tell whether something is false or not.
[00:11:32] Elon Musk: You know, propaganda.
[00:11:35] Elon Musk: The recent update to Grock is actually very good at piercing through propaganda.
[00:11:40] Elon Musk: So and then we we we use that latest version of rock to create rock and media.
[00:11:46] Elon Musk: Which I think is much more it's it's it's not just I think more neutral.
[00:11:54] Elon Musk: That then and more accurate than the new computer, but actually it's a lot more information than a Wikipedia page.
[00:12:00] Jason Calacanis: I've seen it with Wikipedia actually take us that back.
[00:12:02] Jason Calacanis: How did you guys how did you do this?
[00:12:06] Elon Musk: Well, we used AI.
[00:12:09] But meaning like totally unsupervised just complete training run on its own totally synthetic data.
[00:12:15] Jason Calacanis: No, no seated set nothing.
[00:12:19] Elon Musk: Well, it was only just recently possible press to do this.
[00:12:25] Elon Musk: So we've we've we finished training on a maximum of two seeking.
[00:12:31] Elon Musk: Actually, she's seeing a version of Grock that is good at cogent analysis.
[00:12:37] Elon Musk: So breaking down.
[00:12:40] Elon Musk: Any any given argument into its axiomatic elements, assessing with us axioms are.
[00:12:47] Not you know the basic test of a cogency the axioms are likely to be true.
[00:12:53] A contradictory that the conclusion actually that the conclusion most likely follows from those at axioms.
[00:13:03] Elon Musk: So so we just trained Grock on a lot of critical thinking.
[00:13:07] Elon Musk: So it just got really good critical thinking.
[00:13:10] Elon Musk: Which was quite hard and then we took that version of Grock and said, okay cycle through the the million most popular articles in Wikipedia.
[00:13:19] Elon Musk: And and add modifying to delete.
[00:13:22] Elon Musk: So that means research the rest of the internet.
[00:13:27] Elon Musk: What it was publicly available and correct what's correct with computer articles and fixed mistakes.
[00:13:34] Elon Musk: But also add a lot more context.
[00:13:37] Elon Musk: So sometimes really the nature of the propaganda is that.
[00:13:44] You know, effects are stated that are that are technically true, but are not represent do not properly represent a picture of the individual or event.
[00:13:53] This is critical because when you have a bio as you do actually all do on Wikipedia.
[00:14:00] Over time, it's just the people you fired or you beat in business or have an axe to grind.
[00:14:06] David Sacks: So it just slowly becomes like the place where everybody you know kind of who hates you then puts their information I looked at mine.
[00:14:15] David Sacks: It was so much more representative and it was five times longer six times longer.
[00:14:20] David Sacks: And the what it gave way to was much more accurate much more accurate.
[00:14:26] David Sacks: And this opportunity was sitting here I think for a long time.
[00:14:30] David Sacks: It's just great that you got to it because they they don't update my page, but you know, I don't know twice a month with you know, and then who is the secret cobble is 50 people who are anonymous.
[00:14:41] David Sacks: Who decide what's gets put on it was a much better much more updated page in version one.
[00:14:49] Yes, this is person's point one as we put it as we showed the top. So I do think actually by the time we get to version one 1.0 it'll be 10 times better.
[00:14:57] Elon Musk: But even at this early stage, as you just mentioned, it's it's not just that it's correcting errors, but it is creating a more accurate realistic and fleshed out description of people and events.
[00:15:13] And you think that and it's like you can look at articles on on physics and rock peter that they're much better than Wikipedia by far.
[00:15:21] Jason Calacanis: This what I was going to ask you is that do you think that you can take this corpus of pages now and.
[00:15:26] Get Google to deboost Wikipedia or boost.
[00:15:30] Jason Calacanis: Rockopedia in traditional search because a lot of people still find this and they believe that it's authoritative because it comes up number one.
[00:15:38] Jason Calacanis: Right so how do we how do we do that? How do you flip Google.
[00:15:42] Elon Musk: Yeah, so it really can if people share a lot of if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if
[00:16:12] Elon Musk: If you tapped in Gropopedia, Google would just say,
[00:16:14] Elon Musk: did you meet in Gropedia?
[00:16:16] Elon Musk: Wikipedia, yeah.
[00:16:17] Jason Calacanis: Yeah.
[00:16:17] Jason Calacanis: And it wouldn't be great Gropedia at all.
[00:16:19] Elon Musk: Yeah, that's true.
[00:16:21] Elon Musk: So now, how's the usage then?
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_04: Have you seen good growth since it launched?
[00:16:26] Yeah, it's very late.
[00:16:28] Elon Musk: It went super viral.
[00:16:31] Elon Musk: So we're seeing it's outside of all of the place.
[00:16:36] Elon Musk: But yeah, it's, and I think we'll see it use more and more
[00:16:40] Elon Musk: as people refer to it.
[00:16:42] Elon Musk: And people will judge for themselves.
[00:16:44] Elon Musk: When you read a Gropedia article about a subject or a person
[00:16:48] Elon Musk: that you know a lot about, and you see,
[00:16:50] Elon Musk: wow, this is way better than Wikipedia.
[00:16:53] Elon Musk: It's more comprehensive.
[00:16:55] Elon Musk: It's way more accurate.
[00:16:57] Elon Musk: It's neutral instead of biased.
[00:17:00] Elon Musk: Then you're going to set, you're going to forward those links
[00:17:02] Elon Musk: around and say that this is actually the better source.
[00:17:07] Elon Musk: Like it's, Gropedia will succeed, I think, very well,
[00:17:12] Elon Musk: because it is fundamentally a superior product to Wikipedia.
[00:17:16] Elon Musk: It is a better source of information.
[00:17:19] And we haven't even added images and video yet.
[00:17:23] Elon Musk: So we're going to add a lot of video.
[00:17:29] Elon Musk: So using Gropedia to create videos.
[00:17:33] And so if you're trying to explain something,
[00:17:40] Elon Musk: Gropedia can take the text from Gropedia
[00:17:43] Elon Musk: and then generate a video, an explanatory video.
[00:17:47] Elon Musk: So if you're trying to understand anything
[00:17:49] Elon Musk: from how to tie a bow tie to how to send chemical reactions
[00:17:52] Elon Musk: work or really anything, dietary things, medical things,
[00:17:58] Elon Musk: we can just go and see the video of how it works.
[00:18:04] Elon Musk: That's right.
[00:18:05] Elon Musk: When you have this version that's maximally
[00:18:08] Jason Calacanis: truth-seeking as a model, do you
[00:18:10] Jason Calacanis: think that there needs to be a better eVal or a benchmark
[00:18:12] Jason Calacanis: that people can point to that shows how off of the truth things
[00:18:16] Jason Calacanis: are so that if you're going to start a training run
[00:18:19] Jason Calacanis: with common crawl or if you're going to use Reddit
[00:18:21] Jason Calacanis: or if you're going to use it, is it important
[00:18:23] Jason Calacanis: to be able to say, hey, hold on a second,
[00:18:26] Jason Calacanis: this eVal just suck, like you guys suck on this eVal.
[00:18:28] Jason Calacanis: Like it's just this is crappy data.
[00:18:34] Yeah, I guess I think there are a lot of eVals out there.
[00:18:39] Elon Musk: I've completely confidence that Gropedia is going to succeed
[00:18:44] Elon Musk: because what we compete is actually not a very good product.
[00:18:47] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:18:48] Elon Musk: It's the information is sparse, wrong, and out of date.
[00:18:55] Elon Musk: And if you can go, if you find, and it doesn't have,
[00:18:59] Elon Musk: you know, there are very few images that's basically
[00:19:01] Elon Musk: in a video.
[00:19:03] Elon Musk: So if you have something which is accurate,
[00:19:10] Elon Musk: comprehensive, has videos where more over,
[00:19:14] Elon Musk: you can ask if there's any part of it that you're curious about,
[00:19:17] Elon Musk: you can just highlight it and ask Grop right there.
[00:19:22] Elon Musk: Like if you try to learn something, it's just great.
[00:19:25] Elon Musk: It's not going to be a little bit better than Roy Capita.
[00:19:27] Elon Musk: It's going to be 100 times better.
[00:19:29] Elon Musk: Elon, do you think you'll see like good uniform usage?
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_04: Like if you look back on the last three years,
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_04: since you bought Twitter, there was a lot of people
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_04: after you bought Twitter that said,
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_04: I'm leaving Twitter, Elon's bought it.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_04: I'm going to go to this other wherever the hell they went.
[00:19:46] And there's all these news.
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_04: I'm surprised.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_04: And there's all these, and there's all these blue skies.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_04: I appreciate it.
[00:19:54] Elon Musk: Yeah, but blue skies.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_04: Blue skies, my favorite.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_04: I guess my question is, as you destroy the woke mind,
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_04: viral kind of control of the system,
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_04: and as you bring truth to the system,
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_04: whether the system is through Gropopedia or through X,
[00:20:12] do people just look for confirmation bias
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_04: and they actually don't accept the truth?
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_04: Like what do you think people are actually going
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_04: to see the truth and change?
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_04: I think they're going to change.
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:20:25] But I mean, is that like,
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_04: You thought 70s, 70s boobs are great.
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_04: I see mine.
[00:20:30] Looking good.
[00:20:31] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:20:32] David Sacks: Solid.
[00:20:33] David Sacks: I'm not going to be caught there.
[00:20:33] David Sacks: I'm just putting a little cheer.
[00:20:34] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:20:35] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:20:36] Elon Musk: I think we just got flagged on YouTube.
[00:20:39] Elon Musk: Yeah, we did, that was definitely going to give us a sense
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_04: of your moment.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_04: So yeah.
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_04: Great A moves.
[00:20:44] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_04: But like, do people change their mind?
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_04: I mean, if this is, I could take this as such thing
[00:20:51] Elon Musk: as great A move.
[00:20:52] Oh my god.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_04: So that the rails are ready.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_04: David, you were trying to ask a serious question.
[00:20:59] David Sacks: Go ahead.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_04: Well, I just want to know if people change their mind.
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_04: Like can you actually change people's minds
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_04: by putting the truth in front of them
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_04: or do people just take they kind of ignore the truth
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_04: because they feel like they're in some sort of camp
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_04: and they're like they want the confirmation bias.
[00:21:13] Jason Calacanis: They want the confirmation bias
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_04: and they want to stay in a camp
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_04: and they want to be tribal about everything.
[00:21:18] It is remarkable how much people believe things
[00:21:21] Elon Musk: simply because it is the belief of their in-group, what
[00:21:26] Elon Musk: of their sort of political or ideological five is.
[00:21:32] Elon Musk: So I mean, there's some pretty hilarious videos of,
[00:21:37] Elon Musk: you know, and there's like some guy going around,
[00:21:42] Elon Musk: bump is like a racist, not see or whatever.
[00:21:44] Elon Musk: And then, and then there, and here's like trying to show
[00:21:47] Elon Musk: them the videos where of the thing that they are talking about,
[00:21:52] Elon Musk: where he is in fact condemning the Nazis
[00:21:54] Elon Musk: as strong as possible terms and condemning racism
[00:21:56] Elon Musk: in the strongest possible terms.
[00:21:58] Elon Musk: And they literally don't even want to watch the videos.
[00:22:00] Elon Musk: So, so yeah, that people, or at least some people,
[00:22:06] Elon Musk: they were preferred, they will stick to whatever
[00:22:10] Elon Musk: they're ideological views are, whatever
[00:22:13] Elon Musk: that sort of political tribal views are, no matter what.
[00:22:17] The evidence could be staring them in the face
[00:22:21] Elon Musk: and they're just going to be a flat-erther, you know.
[00:22:24] Elon Musk: There is no evidence that you could show
[00:22:26] a flat-erther to commit some of the world's around
[00:22:29] Elon Musk: because everything is just a lie, the world is flat.
[00:22:32] Elon Musk: So I think the ability to hit at-brok in a reply
[00:22:36] David Sacks: and ask a question in the thread has really become
[00:22:40] David Sacks: like a truth-seeking missile on the platform.
[00:22:43] David Sacks: So when I put up metrics or something like that,
[00:22:45] David Sacks: I reply to myself and I say,
[00:22:47] David Sacks: at-brok is the information I just shared correct
[00:22:50] David Sacks: and can you find any better information?
[00:22:52] David Sacks: And please tell me if my argument is correct or if I'm wrong.
[00:22:55] David Sacks: And then it goes through and then it DMs Sacks
[00:22:58] David Sacks: and then Sacks gets in my replies and tries to correct me.
[00:23:00] David Sacks: No, but it does actually a really good job of like,
[00:23:03] David Sacks: and that combined with community notes.
[00:23:05] David Sacks: Now you've got like two swings at bat.
[00:23:07] David Sacks: The community's consensus view and then Groc coming in,
[00:23:11] David Sacks: I think it would be like really interesting if Groc
[00:23:13] David Sacks: on like really powerful threads kind of did
[00:23:16] like its own version of community notes
[00:23:18] David Sacks: and had it sitting there ahead of time.
[00:23:20] David Sacks: You know, like you could look at the thread
[00:23:21] David Sacks: and it just had next to it, you know,
[00:23:24] David Sacks: or maybe on like the specific statistic,
[00:23:26] David Sacks: you could click on it and it would show you like,
[00:23:28] David Sacks: ah, here's what that statistics from.
[00:23:31] Elon Musk: I mean, you can, I mean pretty much every,
[00:23:33] Elon Musk: I mean, essentially every post on X and X
[00:23:35] Elon Musk: is like advertising or something,
[00:23:37] Elon Musk: has the Groc symbol on it.
[00:23:39] Elon Musk: And you can just tap that symbol
[00:23:41] Elon Musk: and you're one tap away from a Groc analysis.
[00:23:43] Elon Musk: Literally just one tap.
[00:23:44] Elon Musk: And we want to cloud the interface with where it's
[00:23:47] Elon Musk: providing an explanation.
[00:23:49] Elon Musk: But I'm just saying, if you go on X right now,
[00:23:51] Elon Musk: it's one tap to get Groc's analysis
[00:23:55] Elon Musk: and Groc will research the X post
[00:23:58] Elon Musk: and give you an accurate answer.
[00:24:00] Elon Musk: And you can even ask us to do further research
[00:24:03] Elon Musk: and further do do all the trends
[00:24:05] Elon Musk: and you can go as far down the rabbit hole
[00:24:07] Elon Musk: as you want to go.
[00:24:08] Elon Musk: But I do think like this is the consistent with,
[00:24:12] Elon Musk: we want X to be the best source of truth
[00:24:14] Elon Musk: on the planet by far.
[00:24:15] Elon Musk: And I think it is.
[00:24:18] Elon Musk: And where you hear, you know, any and all points of view,
[00:24:22] Elon Musk: but where those points of view are corrected
[00:24:25] Elon Musk: by human editors with community notes.
[00:24:27] Elon Musk: And they as in some community notes
[00:24:29] Elon Musk: is that people who historically disagree
[00:24:34] Elon Musk: agree that this community note is correct.
[00:24:37] So this is and and all of the community notes code
[00:24:42] Elon Musk: is open source and the data is open source.
[00:24:44] Elon Musk: So you can recreate any community note from scratch
[00:24:47] Elon Musk: as independently.
[00:24:49] My enlarge, it's worked very well.
[00:24:50] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:24:52] I think we originally had the idea
[00:24:54] David Sacks: to have you back on the pod
[00:24:55] David Sacks: because it was a three year anniversary
[00:24:57] David Sacks: of the Twitter acquisition.
[00:24:58] David Sacks: So I just wanted to kind of reminisce a little bit.
[00:25:02] David Sacks: And I remember, yeah, I mean, I remember.
[00:25:04] David Sacks: Who's that sync?
[00:25:06] Where's that sync?
[00:25:06] Well, yeah.
[00:25:07] David Sacks: So Elon was staying at my house.
[00:25:10] David Sacks: We had talked the week before and he told me
[00:25:11] David Sacks: the deal was going to close.
[00:25:12] David Sacks: And so I was like, hey, do you need a place to stay
[00:25:14] David Sacks: and he took me up on it?
[00:25:15] David Sacks: And the day before he went to the Twitter office,
[00:25:20] David Sacks: there was a request made to my staff.
[00:25:22] David Sacks: Do you happen to have an extra sync?
[00:25:23] David Sacks: And they did not, but they were able to.
[00:25:26] David Sacks: Yeah, who has an extra sync, really?
[00:25:29] But they were able to locate one at a nearby hardware store
[00:25:33] David Sacks: and I think they paid extra to get it out of the window
[00:25:34] David Sacks: or something.
[00:25:37] Well, I think the store was confused
[00:25:39] Elon Musk: because my security team was asking for any kind of sync.
[00:25:43] Elon Musk: And like normally people wouldn't ask for any kind of sync.
[00:25:48] Elon Musk: If you need a sync that puts in your bathroom
[00:25:50] Elon Musk: or connects with certain kind of plumbing.
[00:25:53] Elon Musk: So they're like, he's like, well, what kind of faucets do you want?
[00:25:56] Elon Musk: There's no, no, I just wanted to sync.
[00:25:58] Elon Musk: Yeah, I think it's a mental person.
[00:25:59] Elon Musk: You go online.
[00:26:01] Elon Musk: The store was confused that we just wanted to sync.
[00:26:04] And didn't care what the sync connected to.
[00:26:08] That was.
[00:26:10] Elon Musk: That was a lot of.
[00:26:11] Elon Musk: They were almost not letting us buy the sync
[00:26:13] Elon Musk: because they thought maybe we'd buy the wrong sync.
[00:26:16] Elon Musk: You know, it's just rare that somebody wants a sync
[00:26:20] Elon Musk: for a sync sync.
[00:26:23] David Sacks: For me, in purposes.
[00:26:25] David Sacks: One of my favorite memories was Elon said,
[00:26:27] hey, you know, swing by, check it out.
[00:26:29] David Sacks: I said, okay, I'll come by and I drive up there
[00:26:31] David Sacks: and I'm looking way to park the car
[00:26:32] David Sacks: and I realized there's just parking spaces
[00:26:34] David Sacks: around the entire building.
[00:26:36] David Sacks: And I'm like, okay, this can't be legal parking,
[00:26:39] David Sacks: but I park and it's a little parking.
[00:26:41] David Sacks: Yeah, you're in downtown SF.
[00:26:43] Elon Musk: So you might get you with no broken.
[00:26:45] Elon Musk: Yeah, I might not be able to get back.
[00:26:46] David Sacks: When we get in there and the place is empty.
[00:26:50] And then yeah, yeah.
[00:26:52] It was seriously empty.
[00:26:54] David Sacks: Except the cafeteria.
[00:26:55] David Sacks: There was an entire, there were two,
[00:26:57] Elon Musk: the Twitter courses, two buildings.
[00:26:59] Elon Musk: One of the buildings was completely and utterly empty.
[00:27:02] Elon Musk: The other building had like 5% occupancy.
[00:27:06] And the 5% occupancy, we go to the cafeteria,
[00:27:09] David Sacks: we all go get something to eat.
[00:27:10] David Sacks: And we realized there's more people
[00:27:12] David Sacks: working in the cafeteria than at Twitter.
[00:27:15] There were more people making the food
[00:27:17] Elon Musk: than eating the food.
[00:27:19] Elon Musk: Right.
[00:27:20] Elon Musk: And this giant cafeteria, it was giant.
[00:27:22] Elon Musk: Really nice, really nice cafeteria.
[00:27:28] Elon Musk: This is where we discovered that the actual price
[00:27:30] Elon Musk: of the lunch was $400.
[00:27:34] Elon Musk: The original price was $20,
[00:27:36] Elon Musk: but it had 5% occupancy, so it was 20 times higher.
[00:27:41] Elon Musk: And they still kept making the same amount pretty much.
[00:27:44] Elon Musk: So and charging the same amount.
[00:27:45] Elon Musk: So effectively lunch was $400.
[00:27:49] Elon Musk: And it's a great meeting.
[00:27:51] Yes.
[00:27:52] Elon Musk: And then there was that where we had the initial meetings,
[00:27:56] Elon Musk: sort of the sort of time figure
[00:27:57] Elon Musk: at what they had to go on on meetings in the,
[00:28:00] Elon Musk: in the, because you know, there's the two buildings,
[00:28:03] Elon Musk: two Twitter buildings, and one,
[00:28:05] Elon Musk: the one with literally no one in it.
[00:28:08] Elon Musk: That's where we had the initial meetings.
[00:28:12] And then we tried drawing on the whiteboard
[00:28:15] Elon Musk: and the markers had gone dry.
[00:28:18] Elon Musk: So the nurses said, nobody used the whiteboard markers
[00:28:23] Elon Musk: in like two years.
[00:28:26] So sad.
[00:28:27] Elon Musk: None of the blockers were.
[00:28:28] Elon Musk: So we were like, this is totally bizarre,
[00:28:30] Elon Musk: but it was totally cleaned because the cleaning crew
[00:28:33] Elon Musk: had come in and done their job and cleaned,
[00:28:37] Elon Musk: cleaned it already clean place for,
[00:28:39] I don't know, two, three years straight.
[00:28:42] It was flawless.
[00:28:45] I mean, honestly, this is more crazy
[00:28:48] Elon Musk: than any sort of Mike Judge movie
[00:28:50] Elon Musk: or, you know, Silicon Valley or anything like that.
[00:28:53] Elon Musk: And then we, I remember going into the men's bathroom
[00:28:56] Elon Musk: and there's a table with, you know,
[00:29:04] Hygiene to.
[00:29:06] Mestral Hygiene products.
[00:29:09] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:29:10] Elon Musk: Refreshed every once.
[00:29:12] Elon Musk: It's at tampons, like a fresh box of tampons.
[00:29:16] Elon Musk: And we're like, but there's literally no one
[00:29:18] Elon Musk: in this building.
[00:29:20] Elon Musk: So, but no, it hadn't turned off the send,
[00:29:23] Elon Musk: send fresh tampons to the men's bathroom
[00:29:26] Elon Musk: in the empty building had not been turned off.
[00:29:29] Elon Musk: No.
[00:29:30] Elon Musk: So every week they would put a fresh box of tampons
[00:29:33] Elon Musk: in an empty building for years.
[00:29:37] Elon Musk: That's happened for years.
[00:29:39] Elon Musk: And I'm very confusing to the people
[00:29:41] Elon Musk: that were being asked to do this.
[00:29:42] Elon Musk: Because they're like, okay, you are throwing away.
[00:29:48] Elon Musk: I remember.
[00:29:49] Elon Musk: I guess they're paying us.
[00:29:51] Elon Musk: So we'll just put tampons.
[00:29:53] Elon Musk: So, so you just have to consider the string
[00:29:55] Elon Musk: of possibilities necessary in order for anyone
[00:29:58] Elon Musk: to possibly use that tampon in the men's bathroom
[00:30:01] Elon Musk: at the unoccupied second building of Twitter headquarters.
[00:30:05] Elon Musk: Because you'd have to be a burglar
[00:30:08] Elon Musk: who is a trans man, burglar.
[00:30:15] Elon Musk: Who's unwilling to use the women's bathroom
[00:30:16] Elon Musk: that also has tampons.
[00:30:19] Elon Musk: Statistically, even though this is the one in the building.
[00:30:22] Elon Musk: So, broken into the building.
[00:30:23] Elon Musk: At that moment, you have a period.
[00:30:27] Elon Musk: Yeah, and you're on a period.
[00:30:29] I mean, we're more likely to be struck by a meteor
[00:30:35] Elon Musk: than need that tampon, okay?
[00:30:38] David Sacks: I remember.
[00:30:40] I think it was shortly after that,
[00:30:42] David Sacks: you discovered an entire room at the office
[00:30:46] David Sacks: that was filled with stay woke t-shirts.
[00:30:49] Yeah.
[00:30:50] David Sacks: Do you remember this?
[00:30:50] David Sacks: An entire pile of munch.
[00:30:52] Yes.
[00:30:53] Elon Musk: Tax stay woke.
[00:30:54] Stay woke.
[00:30:55] Elon Musk: And also a big sort of buttons,
[00:30:57] Elon Musk: like those magnetic buttons that you put on your shirt
[00:30:59] Elon Musk: that said, I am an engineer.
[00:31:05] Elon Musk: Like, look, if you're an engineer,
[00:31:07] Elon Musk: you don't need a button.
[00:31:08] Elon Musk: Like a big...
[00:31:09] Who's the button for?
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_04: Who are you taking me to?
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_04: You can just ship code.
[00:31:14] David Sacks: We would know.
[00:31:15] David Sacks: Check your gear.
[00:31:16] David Sacks: But yeah, they're like scarves.
[00:31:20] Elon Musk: Who do you use?
[00:31:22] Elon Musk: All kinds of munch that sit hashtags stay woke.
[00:31:24] David Sacks: Yeah, a couple of music rooms.
[00:31:25] David Sacks: When you found that, I was like, my godman,
[00:31:27] David Sacks: the barbarians are fully within the gates now.
[00:31:29] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:31:30] David Sacks: I mean, the barbarians have smashed through the gates
[00:31:33] David Sacks: and are looting them much.
[00:31:34] David Sacks: Yes.
[00:31:35] David Sacks: You are rummaging through their holy relics
[00:31:38] David Sacks: and defiling them.
[00:31:39] David Sacks: I mean, but when you think about it, David,
[00:31:41] David Sacks: the amount of waste that we saw there
[00:31:44] David Sacks: during those first 30 days,
[00:31:46] David Sacks: just to be serious about it for a second,
[00:31:48] David Sacks: this was a publicly traded company.
[00:31:50] David Sacks: So if you think about the financial duty
[00:31:52] David Sacks: of those individuals,
[00:31:54] David Sacks: there was a list of SaaS software we went through
[00:31:57] David Sacks: and none of it was being used.
[00:31:59] David Sacks: Some of it had never been installed
[00:32:01] David Sacks: and they had been paying for it for two years.
[00:32:03] David Sacks: They've been paying for a SaaS product for two years.
[00:32:06] David Sacks: And the one that blew my mind the most that we canceled was
[00:32:10] David Sacks: they were paying a certain amount of money per desk
[00:32:12] David Sacks: to have desk-sweeting software.
[00:32:14] In an office where nobody came to work,
[00:32:17] David Sacks: so they were paying.
[00:32:19] David Sacks: But there were nobody.
[00:32:20] David Sacks: There was millions of dollars
[00:32:21] Elon Musk: you have being paid for, yes,
[00:32:23] Elon Musk: but for analysis of pedestrian,
[00:32:26] Elon Musk: like software that you use cameras
[00:32:28] Elon Musk: to analyze the pedestrian traffic
[00:32:30] Elon Musk: to figure out where you can alleviate pedestrian traffic
[00:32:33] Elon Musk: gems in an empty building.
[00:32:36] Right.
[00:32:37] That's like 11 out of 10 on a Dilbert scale.
[00:32:41] Yeah, it was pretty shout out, Scott Adams.
[00:32:43] Elon Musk: You've gone off scale on your Dilbert level at that point.
[00:32:48] Let's talk about the free speech aspect for a second.
[00:32:50] David Sacks: Because I think that is the most important legacy
[00:32:53] David Sacks: of the Twitter acquisition.
[00:32:54] David Sacks: And I think people have short memories
[00:32:56] David Sacks: and they forget how bad things were three years ago.
[00:33:00] First of all, you had figures as diverse as President Trump,
[00:33:05] David Sacks: Jordan Peterson, J. Bonnetcharia, and Duterte.
[00:33:09] David Sacks: They were all banned from Twitter.
[00:33:11] David Sacks: And I remember when you opened up the Twitter jails
[00:33:14] David Sacks: and reinstated their accounts,
[00:33:15] David Sacks: kind of freed all the bad boys of free speech.
[00:33:18] David Sacks: That's owned the best deal.
[00:33:19] David Sacks: Yes.
[00:33:20] David Sacks: So you basically gave all the bad boys of free speech
[00:33:22] David Sacks: their accounts back.
[00:33:24] But second, beyond just the bannings,
[00:33:26] David Sacks: there was the shadow bannings.
[00:33:28] David Sacks: And Twitter had claimed for years
[00:33:30] David Sacks: that they were not shadow banning.
[00:33:31] David Sacks: This was a paranoid,
[00:33:33] David Sacks: conservative, experienced.
[00:33:34] David Sacks: They were.
[00:33:35] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:33:36] Elon Musk: There was a very aggressive shadow banning
[00:33:39] Elon Musk: by what was called the trust and safety group,
[00:33:42] Elon Musk: which of course naturally would be the one
[00:33:45] Elon Musk: that is doing the nefarious shadow banning.
[00:33:49] Elon Musk: And I just think we shouldn't have a group
[00:33:52] Elon Musk: called trust and safety.
[00:33:54] Elon Musk: I mean, this is an old name if you ever was one.
[00:33:59] I'm from the trust department.
[00:34:02] Elon Musk: Oh, really.
[00:34:04] Elon Musk: We want to talk to you after tweets.
[00:34:06] Elon Musk: Okay.
[00:34:06] Elon Musk: Well, you see your DMs say that you're from the trust department.
[00:34:10] Elon Musk: It's literally that's the ministry of truth right there.
[00:34:12] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:34:13] And Twitter,
[00:34:14] David Sacks: it's actually that many.
[00:34:16] They had maintained for years
[00:34:17] David Sacks: that they were not engaged in this practice,
[00:34:19] David Sacks: including under oath.
[00:34:20] David Sacks: And on the heels of you opening that up
[00:34:23] David Sacks: and exposing that,
[00:34:25] because by the way,
[00:34:26] David Sacks: it wasn't just the fact they were doing it.
[00:34:27] David Sacks: They created an elaborate set of tools to do this.
[00:34:30] David Sacks: They had checked boxes in the out of tools
[00:34:32] Elon Musk: to, to, yes, to deboost accounts, yes.
[00:34:36] Elon Musk: Yes.
[00:34:37] David Sacks: And, you know, subsequently we found out
[00:34:40] David Sacks: that other social networking properties
[00:34:41] David Sacks: have done this as well, but you were.
[00:34:43] David Sacks: Yes, for the first time.
[00:34:44] David Sacks: This is still being done at the other social media companies.
[00:34:48] I think we're gonna go, by the way.
[00:34:50] Elon Musk: So for, you know,
[00:34:54] Elon Musk: I never pick on Google because they're all doing it.
[00:34:56] Elon Musk: But for search results,
[00:34:59] Elon Musk: if you simply push a result
[00:35:01] Elon Musk: pretty far down the page or, you know,
[00:35:03] Elon Musk: the second page of results, like,
[00:35:04] Elon Musk: like, you know, the joke used to be,
[00:35:06] Elon Musk: or still is anything, like, where do you hide it?
[00:35:08] Elon Musk: What's the best place to hide a dead body?
[00:35:11] The second page of Google search results,
[00:35:13] Elon Musk: because nobody ever goes to the second page
[00:35:14] Elon Musk: of Google search results.
[00:35:15] Elon Musk: So you could hide a dead body there,
[00:35:17] Elon Musk: nobody would find it.
[00:35:18] Elon Musk: And you still have,
[00:35:19] Elon Musk: it's been,
[00:35:20] Elon Musk: then it's not like you haven't made them go away.
[00:35:23] Elon Musk: You've just put them on this one page too.
[00:35:26] Elon Musk: Yes.
[00:35:27] Elon Musk: So shadow banning, I think, was number two.
[00:35:28] David Sacks: So first was banning, second one shadow banning.
[00:35:30] David Sacks: I think third to me was government collusion,
[00:35:33] David Sacks: government interference.
[00:35:34] David Sacks: So you released the Twitter files,
[00:35:36] David Sacks: nothing like that had ever been done before,
[00:35:37] David Sacks: where you just,
[00:35:38] David Sacks: you actually let investigative reporters go through,
[00:35:42] David Sacks: Twitter's emails,
[00:35:43] David Sacks: unfettered tax groups.
[00:35:45] David Sacks: I was not looking over their shoulder at all.
[00:35:47] Elon Musk: They just had direct access to everything.
[00:35:50] And they found that there was extensive collusion
[00:35:52] David Sacks: between the FBI and the Twitter trust and safety group,
[00:35:56] where it turns out the FBI had 88 agents submitting,
[00:35:59] David Sacks: take down requests,
[00:36:00] David Sacks: and they were very involved in the banning,
[00:36:03] David Sacks: the shadow banning, the censorship,
[00:36:04] David Sacks: which I don't think we ever had definitive evidence of that before.
[00:36:08] David Sacks: That was pretty extraordinary.
[00:36:11] Yeah, and the US House representatives had hearings on the matter
[00:36:15] Elon Musk: and a lot of this, you know, was on Earth.
[00:36:19] Elon Musk: It's public record.
[00:36:20] Elon Musk: So a lot of people,
[00:36:21] Elon Musk: so, some people on the left still think this was like made up.
[00:36:24] Elon Musk: I'm like, this is just literally,
[00:36:26] Elon Musk: these, the Twitter files are literally the files at Twitter.
[00:36:30] Elon Musk: I mean, we're literally just talking about,
[00:36:32] Elon Musk: these are the emails that were sent internally that could promise.
[00:36:35] Elon Musk: This is what's on the Slack channels.
[00:36:38] Elon Musk: And this is what is shown in the,
[00:36:40] Elon Musk: on the Twitter database,
[00:36:41] Elon Musk: as where people have made either suspensions or shadow vans.
[00:36:45] Elon Musk: Has the government come and asked you to take stuff down since,
[00:36:49] David Sacks: or they just have to,
[00:36:50] David Sacks: the policy is,
[00:36:51] David Sacks: hey listen, you got a file of warrant,
[00:36:52] David Sacks: you got to,
[00:36:53] David Sacks: you got to come correct,
[00:36:54] David Sacks: as opposed to just putting pressure
[00:36:56] David Sacks: on executives.
[00:36:58] Elon Musk: Yeah, a policy at this point is to follow the law.
[00:37:01] Elon Musk: So, so if the, if,
[00:37:03] Elon Musk: now the laws are obviously different in different countries.
[00:37:07] Elon Musk: So sometimes I, you know,
[00:37:08] Elon Musk: I get criticized for like,
[00:37:10] Elon Musk: why don't I push free speech in XYZ country
[00:37:13] Elon Musk: that doesn't have free speech laws?
[00:37:14] Elon Musk: I'm like, because that's not the law there.
[00:37:18] Elon Musk: And if we don't obey the law,
[00:37:19] Elon Musk: we'll simply be blocked in that country.
[00:37:22] So the policy is really just,
[00:37:26] Elon Musk: adhere to the laws in any given country.
[00:37:30] Elon Musk: It is off to us to agree or disagree with those laws.
[00:37:34] Elon Musk: And if, if, if,
[00:37:35] Elon Musk: if the people of that country wants the laws to be different,
[00:37:38] Elon Musk: then they should, you know,
[00:37:40] Elon Musk: ask their leaders to change the laws.
[00:37:43] Yeah, but anything that,
[00:37:44] Elon Musk: but it's essentially start going beyond the law.
[00:37:46] Elon Musk: Now you're putting a thumb on the scale.
[00:37:49] So, so the, yeah,
[00:37:51] Elon Musk: that I think I think that's the right policy is just adhere
[00:37:55] Elon Musk: to the laws within any given country.
[00:37:57] Elon Musk: Now sometimes we get, you know,
[00:38:00] Elon Musk: in a bit of a bind like we had thought into with Brazil,
[00:38:04] Elon Musk: where, you know,
[00:38:06] Elon Musk: this, this judge in Brazil was asking us to,
[00:38:09] Elon Musk: or telling us to break the law in Brazil.
[00:38:12] Elon Musk: And ban accounts contrary to the law of Brazil.
[00:38:17] Elon Musk: And now we're, now we're somewhat stuck.
[00:38:19] Elon Musk: We're like, wait a second, we're reading the law
[00:38:20] Elon Musk: and it says, this is not allowed to happen.
[00:38:22] Elon Musk: And also that, and giving us a gag order.
[00:38:25] Elon Musk: So like we're not, we're not allowed to say it's happening.
[00:38:31] Elon Musk: And we have to break the law.
[00:38:32] Elon Musk: And the judge is telling us to break the law.
[00:38:34] Elon Musk: The law is breaking the law.
[00:38:35] Elon Musk: That's where things get very difficult.
[00:38:38] Elon Musk: And we were actually banned in Brazil for a while
[00:38:40] Elon Musk: because of that.
[00:38:41] Elon Musk: That's why one final point on the free speech issue
[00:38:43] David Sacks: and then we can move on is just,
[00:38:44] David Sacks: I think you'll forget that the censorship
[00:38:48] David Sacks: wasn't just about COVID.
[00:38:50] David Sacks: There was a growing number of categories
[00:38:52] David Sacks: of thought and opinion that were being outlawed.
[00:38:55] David Sacks: The quote, content moderation,
[00:38:56] David Sacks: which is another or well-in euphemism for censorship
[00:39:00] David Sacks: was being applied to categories like gender
[00:39:04] David Sacks: and even climate change.
[00:39:06] The definition of hate speech was constantly growing.
[00:39:09] David Sacks: Yes.
[00:39:09] David Sacks: And more and more people were being banned or shadow banned.
[00:39:11] David Sacks: And there was more and more things that you couldn't say.
[00:39:14] This trend of censorship was growing.
[00:39:16] David Sacks: It was galloping.
[00:39:17] David Sacks: And it would have continued if it wasn't, I think,
[00:39:20] David Sacks: for the fact that you decided to buy Twitter and opened it up.
[00:39:23] David Sacks: And it was only on the heels of that
[00:39:25] David Sacks: that the other social networks were willing
[00:39:27] David Sacks: to, I think, be a little bit chasened
[00:39:29] David Sacks: in their policies and start to push back more.
[00:39:32] Yeah, that's right.
[00:39:35] Elon Musk: Once Twitter broke ranks, the others had to,
[00:39:39] Elon Musk: it became very obvious what the others were doing.
[00:39:41] Elon Musk: And so they had to mitigate their censorship
[00:39:43] Elon Musk: substantially because of what Twitter did.
[00:39:46] Elon Musk: And I mean, perhaps to give them some credit,
[00:39:47] Elon Musk: they also felt that they had the air cover
[00:39:50] Elon Musk: to be more inclined towards free speech.
[00:39:56] Elon Musk: They still do a lot of shadow banning
[00:40:00] Elon Musk: and whatnot at the other social media companies,
[00:40:03] Elon Musk: but it's much less than it used to be.
[00:40:05] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:40:06] What have you seen in terms of governments creating new laws?
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_04: So we've seen a lot of this crackdown in the UK
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_04: on what's being called hateful speech on social media
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_04: and folks getting arrested and actually going to prison over it.
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_04: And it seems like when there's more freedom,
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_04: the side that is threatened by that comes out
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_04: and creates their own counter, right?
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_04: There's a reaction to that.
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_04: And there seems to be a reaction.
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_04: Are you seeing more of these laws around the world
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_04: in response to your opening up free speech through Twitter?
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_04: And those changes and what they're enabling
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_04: that the governments and the parties
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_04: that control those governments aren't aligned
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_04: and they're stepping in and saying,
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_04: let's create new ways of maintaining our control through law.
[00:40:52] Yeah, there's been an overall global movement
[00:40:56] Elon Musk: to suppress free speech under the name of the guys
[00:41:01] Elon Musk: of suppressing hate speech.
[00:41:03] Elon Musk: But then, the problem with that is that
[00:41:10] Elon Musk: your freedom of speech only matters
[00:41:13] Elon Musk: if people are allowed to say things that you don't like
[00:41:16] Elon Musk: or even things that you hate.
[00:41:19] Elon Musk: Because if you're allowed to suppress speech that you don't like,
[00:41:23] Elon Musk: then you don't have freedom of speech
[00:41:27] Elon Musk: and it's only matter of time before things switch around
[00:41:31] Elon Musk: and then the shoes on the other foot
[00:41:32] Elon Musk: and they will suppress you.
[00:41:34] So, suppress not less, you'd be suppressed.
[00:41:39] Elon Musk: But there is a movement
[00:41:42] Elon Musk: and there was a very strong movement
[00:41:46] Elon Musk: to codify speech suppression into the law
[00:41:49] Elon Musk: throughout the world, including the Western world,
[00:41:52] Elon Musk: the Europe and Australia.
[00:41:54] Elon Musk: The UK and Germany were very aggressive in this regard.
[00:41:59] Yes, and my understanding is that in the UK,
[00:42:02] Elon Musk: there's something like 203,000 people in prison
[00:42:05] Elon Musk: for social media posts.
[00:42:07] Elon Musk: And in fact, that there's so many people
[00:42:10] Elon Musk: that were in prison for social media posts.
[00:42:12] Elon Musk: And many of these things are like,
[00:42:15] Elon Musk: you can't believe that someone would actually
[00:42:17] Elon Musk: put in prison for this.
[00:42:18] Elon Musk: They have, in life cases, released people
[00:42:21] Elon Musk: who have committed violent crimes
[00:42:23] Elon Musk: in order to imprison people who have simply made posts
[00:42:27] Elon Musk: on social media, which is deeply wrong.
[00:42:31] Elon Musk: And, and, and, underscores why the founders of this country
[00:42:35] Elon Musk: made the first amendment, the first amendment
[00:42:38] Elon Musk: was freedom of speech.
[00:42:40] Elon Musk: Why do they do that?
[00:42:41] Elon Musk: It's because in the places that they came from,
[00:42:44] Elon Musk: there wasn't freedom of speech
[00:42:45] Elon Musk: and you could be imprisoned or killed for, for saying things.
[00:42:49] Can I ask you a question just to maybe move to a different topic?
[00:42:52] Jason Calacanis: If you came and did this next week,
[00:42:54] Jason Calacanis: we will be past the Tesla boardbook.
[00:42:56] We talked about it last week
[00:42:58] Jason Calacanis: and we talked about how crazy ISS and glass Lewis's.
[00:43:01] Jason Calacanis: Right.
[00:43:02] Jason Calacanis: We used this one insane example where like,
[00:43:04] Jason Calacanis: Ira, Aaron Price didn't get the recommendation
[00:43:07] Jason Calacanis: from ISS and glass Lewis because he didn't meet
[00:43:10] Jason Calacanis: the gender requirements, but then Kathleen also didn't.
[00:43:14] Elon Musk: It doesn't make sense.
[00:43:15] Elon Musk: Can you, so the board vote is on the six.
[00:43:18] Jason Calacanis: Okay, it's African American one.
[00:43:20] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:43:22] Yeah, she, she, she, they recommend against her,
[00:43:25] Elon Musk: but then also recommend against our enterprise
[00:43:28] Elon Musk: on the grounds he was insufficient of us.
[00:43:30] Elon Musk: So I'm like, this, like these things don't make any sense.
[00:43:33] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:43:34] So I do think about a fundamental issue
[00:43:36] Elon Musk: with corporate governance in publicly traded companies
[00:43:39] Elon Musk: where you've got about half of the stock market
[00:43:42] Elon Musk: is controlled by pass-pint expanse.
[00:43:45] Elon Musk: And most of them,
[00:43:46] Elon Musk: most of them outsource their decision
[00:43:49] Elon Musk: to advisory firms and particularly glass Lewis and ISS.
[00:43:55] Elon Musk: I call them corporate ISIS.
[00:43:57] Elon Musk: So, all they do is basically, they're just terrorists.
[00:44:04] Elon Musk: So, so, and they had, they own no stock
[00:44:07] Elon Musk: in any of these companies.
[00:44:10] Elon Musk: So I think that this, there's a fundamental breakdown
[00:44:12] Elon Musk: of producer responsibility here
[00:44:14] Elon Musk: where really, you know, any company is managing,
[00:44:21] even though they're passively managing index funds
[00:44:23] Elon Musk: or whatever, that they do at the end of the day have
[00:44:26] Elon Musk: a producer duty to vote, you know,
[00:44:31] Elon Musk: along the lines of what would maximize
[00:44:33] Elon Musk: the travel to return.
[00:44:34] Elon Musk: It's because people are counting on them.
[00:44:35] Elon Musk: Like people, you know, have say, you know,
[00:44:39] Elon Musk: so have all their savings and say 401K or something like that.
[00:44:44] Elon Musk: And they're counting on the index funds
[00:44:47] Elon Musk: to do company votes in the direction that would
[00:44:53] Elon Musk: ensure that their retirement savings do as well as possible.
[00:44:57] Elon Musk: But the problem is that that is then outsource
[00:44:59] Elon Musk: to ISS and glass Lewis,
[00:45:01] Elon Musk: which have been infiltrated by fall-up activists.
[00:45:04] Elon Musk: Because, you know, we're falling, you know,
[00:45:07] Elon Musk: you know, we're basically political activists go,
[00:45:09] Elon Musk: they go where the power is.
[00:45:12] And so effectively, glass Lewis and ISS
[00:45:17] Elon Musk: controlled the vote of half the stock market.
[00:45:22] Now, if you're a political activist,
[00:45:24] Elon Musk: you know what a great place would be to go work
[00:45:28] Elon Musk: by assessing glass Lewis and they do.
[00:45:31] So my concern for the future,
[00:45:35] because this, you know, the Tesla thing is,
[00:45:38] Elon Musk: it's called sort of compensation,
[00:45:39] Elon Musk: but it's not about compensation.
[00:45:41] Elon Musk: So I'm like, I'm gonna go and unbi,
[00:45:43] Elon Musk: you know, a yacht with it or something.
[00:45:44] Elon Musk: It's just that I do, I do, if I'm going to build up
[00:45:49] optimists and, you know, have all these robots out there,
[00:45:52] Elon Musk: I need to make sure we do not have a terminated scenario
[00:45:55] Elon Musk: and I can make, you know,
[00:45:57] Elon Musk: maximize the safety of the robots.
[00:46:00] And, and, and,
[00:46:02] Elon Musk: but I feel like I need to have something like a 25% vote,
[00:46:07] Elon Musk: which is enough of a vote to have a strong influence,
[00:46:10] Elon Musk: but not so much of a vote that I can't be
[00:46:13] Elon Musk: a fire if I go insane.
[00:46:15] So it's kind of, but my concern would be,
[00:46:19] Elon Musk: you know, creating this army of robots
[00:46:21] Elon Musk: and then being fired for political reasons
[00:46:25] Elon Musk: because of ISS and glass Lewis,
[00:46:30] Elon Musk: you know, decline to,
[00:46:31] Elon Musk: the ISS and glass Lewis fire me effectively
[00:46:35] Elon Musk: or the activists at those bones fire me.
[00:46:39] Elon Musk: Even though I've done everything right.
[00:46:42] Yeah. That's my concern.
[00:46:43] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:46:44] Elon Musk: And then, then, then, you've got,
[00:46:46] Elon Musk: and then I cannot ensure the safety of the robots.
[00:46:49] If you don't get that vote,
[00:46:51] David Sacks: it doesn't go your way, it looks like it's going to,
[00:46:53] David Sacks: would you leave?
[00:46:54] David Sacks: I mean, is that even in the cards I heard they were,
[00:46:56] David Sacks: the board was very concerned about that.
[00:46:59] Uh, let's just say I'm not going to vote a robot army.
[00:47:04] Elon Musk: If I, if I can be easily kicked out by activists, investors,
[00:47:08] Elon Musk: yeah, away.
[00:47:09] Elon Musk: Yeah. Yeah.
[00:47:10] Makes sense.
[00:47:11] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:47:11] David Sacks: And who is capable of running the four or five major product lines
[00:47:18] David Sacks: at Tesla? I mean, this is the madness of it.
[00:47:20] David Sacks: It's a very complex business.
[00:47:21] David Sacks: People don't understand what's under the hood there.
[00:47:24] David Sacks: It's not just a car company.
[00:47:25] David Sacks: You got batteries, you got trucks,
[00:47:27] David Sacks: you got the self-driving group.
[00:47:29] David Sacks: And this is a very complex business that's,
[00:47:32] David Sacks: you've built over decades now.
[00:47:34] David Sacks: It's, it's not a very simple thing to run.
[00:47:36] David Sacks: I don't think there's a Elon equivalent out there
[00:47:38] David Sacks: who can just jump into the cockpit.
[00:47:39] David Sacks: By the way, if we take a full turn
[00:47:41] Jason Calacanis: around corporate governance corner,
[00:47:44] Jason Calacanis: also this week, what was interesting about the open AI
[00:47:49] Jason Calacanis: restructuring was I read the letter.
[00:47:51] Jason Calacanis: And your lawsuit was excluded from the allowances
[00:47:55] Jason Calacanis: of California attorney general basically saying
[00:47:59] Jason Calacanis: this thing can go through, which means that your lawsuit
[00:48:02] Jason Calacanis: is still out there, right?
[00:48:03] Jason Calacanis: And I think it's going to go to a jury trial.
[00:48:05] Jason Calacanis: Yes.
[00:48:06] Jason Calacanis: So there, that corporate governance thing is still very much
[00:48:08] Jason Calacanis: in question. Do you have any thoughts on that?
[00:48:10] Jason Calacanis: Yes, I believe that will go to a jury trial in February of March.
[00:48:15] Elon Musk: And then we'll see what the results are there.
[00:48:18] Elon Musk: But there's, there's like a mountain of evidence
[00:48:25] Elon Musk: that shows that open AI was created as an open source
[00:48:29] Elon Musk: non-profit.
[00:48:30] Elon Musk: It's literally, that's the exact description
[00:48:33] Elon Musk: in the incorporation documents.
[00:48:35] Elon Musk: And in fact, the incorporation documents explicitly say
[00:48:38] Elon Musk: that no officer or founding member will benefit financially
[00:48:43] Elon Musk: from open AI.
[00:48:46] And they've completely violated that.
[00:48:48] Elon Musk: And more of a, you can, that then you can just use
[00:48:51] Elon Musk: the way back machine and look at the website of open AI.
[00:48:54] Elon Musk: Again, open source, non-profit, open source, non-profit,
[00:48:56] Elon Musk: the whole way until, you know, it looked like, wow,
[00:49:00] Elon Musk: this is a lot of money to be gained here.
[00:49:02] Elon Musk: And then suddenly it starts changing.
[00:49:05] And they try to change the definition of opening
[00:49:06] Elon Musk: AI to be open to everyone instead of open source,
[00:49:09] Elon Musk: even though it always meant open source.
[00:49:12] Elon Musk: I came up with the name.
[00:49:14] Elon Musk: Yeah, look how I know.
[00:49:15] Elon Musk: So if they open sourced it, or they gave you,
[00:49:23] David Sacks: I mean, you don't need the money,
[00:49:23] David Sacks: but if they gave you the percentage ownership
[00:49:26] David Sacks: in it that you would be rightfully,
[00:49:29] David Sacks: which 50 million for a startup would be half at least.
[00:49:32] David Sacks: But they must have made an overture towards you
[00:49:35] David Sacks: and said, hey, can we just give you 10% of this thing
[00:49:37] David Sacks: and give us your blessing?
[00:49:39] You obviously have a different goal here, yeah?
[00:49:42] Yeah.
[00:49:44] I mean, essentially since I came up with the idea
[00:49:46] Elon Musk: of the company, named it, provided the A, B, and C
[00:49:50] Elon Musk: rounds of funding, recruited the critical personnel.
[00:49:55] Elon Musk: I told them everything I know.
[00:49:59] You know, if that had been a commercial corporation,
[00:50:01] Elon Musk: I'd probably own half the company.
[00:50:04] So, but I could have chosen to do that.
[00:50:09] Elon Musk: If I was totally at my discretion,
[00:50:12] Elon Musk: I could have done that.
[00:50:14] But I created it as a nonprofit for the world
[00:50:17] Elon Musk: and open source nonprofit for the world.
[00:50:19] Do you think the right thing to do
[00:50:21] Jason Calacanis: is to take those models and just open source them today?
[00:50:24] Jason Calacanis: If you could affect that change,
[00:50:26] Jason Calacanis: is that the right thing to do?
[00:50:28] Yeah, I think that is what it was created to do.
[00:50:32] Elon Musk: So it should.
[00:50:33] Elon Musk: I mean, the best open source models right now,
[00:50:35] Elon Musk: actually ironically,
[00:50:36] Elon Musk: because if they seem to be an irony maximizer,
[00:50:40] Elon Musk: the best open source models are generally from China.
[00:50:43] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:50:46] Elon Musk: That's bizarre.
[00:50:47] Elon Musk: And then the second best,
[00:50:49] Elon Musk: it's one is, or maybe it's better than second best,
[00:50:54] Elon Musk: but like the, the Grop 2.5 open source models,
[00:50:59] Elon Musk: actually very good.
[00:51:01] And I think we'd probably be,
[00:51:04] and we'll continue to open source models.
[00:51:06] Elon Musk: But whereas, like try using any of the recent
[00:51:09] Elon Musk: so-called the Open AI open source models,
[00:51:11] Elon Musk: they don't work.
[00:51:13] Elon Musk: They basically, they open source
[00:51:14] Elon Musk: a broken, non-working version of their models
[00:51:19] as a fake leaf.
[00:51:23] I mean, do you know anyone who's open
[00:51:25] Elon Musk: open AI's open source models?
[00:51:27] Elon Musk: Exactly.
[00:51:27] Elon Musk: Yeah, nobody.
[00:51:29] We've had a big debate about jobs here.
[00:51:32] Obviously, they're gonna be job displacement.
[00:51:35] You and I have talked about it for decades.
[00:51:39] What's your take on the pace of it?
[00:51:42] David Sacks: Because obviously, building self-driving software,
[00:51:44] David Sacks: you building Optimus,
[00:51:46] we're seeing Amazon take some steps here
[00:51:48] David Sacks: where they're like, yeah, we're probably not gonna hire
[00:51:50] David Sacks: these positions in the future.
[00:51:52] David Sacks: And maybe they're getting rid of people now
[00:51:54] David Sacks: because they were bloated, but maybe some of its AI,
[00:51:57] David Sacks: it's all debatable.
[00:51:59] David Sacks: What do you think the timeline is?
[00:52:01] David Sacks: And what do you think as a society we're gonna need to do
[00:52:05] David Sacks: to mitigate it if it goes too fast?
[00:52:08] Well, I call AI the supersonic tsunami.
[00:52:15] So, there's not the most company description in the world.
[00:52:19] Elon Musk: But it's fast and big.
[00:52:21] Elon Musk: It was a tsunami, a giant wall of water
[00:52:24] Elon Musk: moving faster than the speed of sound, that's AI.
[00:52:27] Elon Musk: When does it land?
[00:52:29] Elon Musk: Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:32] So, now this is happening whether I wanted to or not.
[00:52:36] Elon Musk: I actually tried to slow down AI.
[00:52:38] Elon Musk: But, by the way.
[00:52:41] And then the reason I wanted to create OpenAI
[00:52:46] Elon Musk: was to serve as a counterweight to Google,
[00:52:48] Elon Musk: because at the time Google was essentially
[00:52:51] Elon Musk: had unilateral power in AI.
[00:52:53] Elon Musk: That all the AI, essentially.
[00:52:58] Elon Musk: And Larry Page was not, you know,
[00:53:04] Elon Musk: he was not taking us safety seriously.
[00:53:11] I'm not sure.
[00:53:12] Elon Musk: Were you there when he called me a specius?
[00:53:14] Elon Musk: Yes.
[00:53:15] When's there?
[00:53:16] David Sacks: Yeah.
[00:53:17] Okay, so.
[00:53:18] Elon Musk: You were more concerned about the human race
[00:53:20] David Sacks: than you were about the machines.
[00:53:21] David Sacks: And, yeah, you had a clear bias for humanity.
[00:53:25] Yes, yes, exactly.
[00:53:26] Elon Musk: I was like, Larry, well, what,
[00:53:28] Elon Musk: you know, we need to make sure that the AI doesn't destroy
[00:53:30] Elon Musk: all the humans.
[00:53:32] Elon Musk: And then he called me a specius.
[00:53:34] Elon Musk: Like a great sister to something for being pro human intelligence
[00:53:38] Elon Musk: instead of machine intelligence.
[00:53:39] Elon Musk: I'm like, well, sorry, what side are you on?
[00:53:41] Elon Musk: I mean, you know, that's kind of a concern.
[00:53:46] Elon Musk: And then at the time,
[00:53:48] Elon Musk: the Google had essentially a monopoly on AI.
[00:53:52] Yeah, they bought DeepMind,
[00:53:54] David Sacks: which you were on the board of had an investment in Larry
[00:53:57] David Sacks: and Sergey had invested in it as well.
[00:53:58] David Sacks: And it's really interesting.
[00:53:59] David Sacks: It's really interesting.
[00:54:00] David Sacks: I'm not about it because I told him about it.
[00:54:01] Elon Musk: And I showed him some stuff from DeepMind.
[00:54:05] Elon Musk: And I think that's how we found out about it
[00:54:07] Elon Musk: and acquired them, actually.
[00:54:09] Elon Musk: I gotta give what I say.
[00:54:10] Elon Musk: But the point is that it's like,
[00:54:14] Elon Musk: look, now he's not taking AI safety seriously.
[00:54:17] Elon Musk: And Google had essentially all the AI
[00:54:20] Elon Musk: and all the computers and all the money.
[00:54:21] Elon Musk: And I'm like, this is a unipolar world
[00:54:23] Elon Musk: where the guy in charge is not taking things seriously.
[00:54:25] Elon Musk: So, and called me a specius.
[00:54:28] Elon Musk: I guess we'll be pro-human.
[00:54:30] What are you doing those circumstances?
[00:54:32] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:54:33] Building a competitor.
[00:54:34] David Sacks: Yes.
[00:54:35] Elon Musk: So opening I was created essentially as the opposite,
[00:54:38] Elon Musk: which is an open-source nonprofit, the opposite to Google.
[00:54:41] Elon Musk: Now, unfortunately, it needs to change its name
[00:54:44] Elon Musk: to closed to a maximum profit AI.
[00:54:46] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:54:47] A maximum profit to be clear.
[00:54:49] Elon Musk: The most amount.
[00:54:51] Elon Musk: I can't think of the most amount of profit.
[00:54:54] Elon Musk: profit positively.
[00:54:56] Elon Musk: I mean, it is so it is like, like I said, it's comical.
[00:55:01] Elon Musk: I mean, you hear, we have some, I mean, it is an irony maximizing.
[00:55:04] Elon Musk: You have to say, like, what is the most, the most ironic outcome for a company that was
[00:55:09] Elon Musk: created for to do open source, not at non-profit AI is it's super close source.
[00:55:15] Elon Musk: It's tied in nox.
[00:55:18] And they are going for maximum profit.
[00:55:25] Elon Musk: Like get the bourbon, the steak knife, you know, that, you know, like they're going for
[00:55:37] Elon Musk: the buffet.
[00:55:39] Elon Musk: And they just diving headfirst into the profit buffet.
[00:55:42] Elon Musk: I mean, it's just, or at least ask for the revenue buffet at least.
[00:55:45] Elon Musk: Profit will see.
[00:55:46] Elon Musk: I mean, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, the randomness wolves for revenue.
[00:55:52] Elon Musk: Revenue is a huge buffet.
[00:55:54] Elon Musk: No, no, it's literally like super bad.
[00:55:58] David Sacks: It's like Bond, Villain, level flip.
[00:56:00] David Sacks: Like it went from being the United Nations to being specter in like James Bond led.
[00:56:05] David Sacks: When you hear him say I'm going to, when Sam says it's going to like raise 1.4 trillion
[00:56:10] David Sacks: to build our data centers.
[00:56:12] David Sacks: Yeah, but I think he means it.
[00:56:14] Yeah, I mean, it's, I would say audacious, but I wouldn't want to.
[00:56:20] Yeah, in so the word it actually has a question about this.
[00:56:23] David Sacks: How is that possible?
[00:56:24] David Sacks: In the earnings call, you said something that was insane.
[00:56:28] Jason Calacanis: And then I think the math actually nets out, but you said we could connect all the
[00:56:31] Jason Calacanis: Teslas and allow them in downtime to actually offer up inference.
[00:56:37] Jason Calacanis: And you can string them all together.
[00:56:39] Jason Calacanis: I think the math is like, it could actually be like a hundred gigawatts.
[00:56:42] Jason Calacanis: Is that right?
[00:56:43] Right?
[00:56:44] Elon Musk: Do you do?
[00:56:45] Elon Musk: If ultimately there's a Tesla fleet that is a hundred million vehicles, which I think
[00:56:51] Elon Musk: we probably will get to at some point a hundred million vehicle fleet.
[00:56:54] Elon Musk: And they have, you know, mostly say they are inference computers in them that each say
[00:57:00] Elon Musk: are a kilowatt of inference computer.
[00:57:04] Elon Musk: And they have built in power and cooling and.
[00:57:07] Elon Musk: Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:08] Elon Musk: Connect to the watt.
[00:57:09] Elon Musk: That's the key.
[00:57:10] Jason Calacanis: Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:11] Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:12] Elon Musk: And, and, and, and, and, and, that you think you'd have a hundred gigawatts of inference
[00:57:17] Elon Musk: computer.
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_04: Elon, do you think that the architecture, like there was an attention free model that came
[00:57:21] SPEAKER_04: out the last week.
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_04: There's been all of these papers, all of these new models that have been shown to reduce
[00:57:26] SPEAKER_04: power, per token of output by many, many, many orders of magnitude, like not just an order
[00:57:32] SPEAKER_04: of magnitude, but like maybe three or four, like what's your view and all the work you've
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_04: been doing on where we're headed in terms of power per unit of computer, per token.
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_04: So, token of output.
[00:57:44] Well, we have a clear example of efficient power efficient compute, which is the human
[00:57:52] Elon Musk: brain.
[00:57:54] Elon Musk: So our brain is used about 20 watts of power, but, and all that only about 10 watts is
[00:58:01] Elon Musk: higher brain function.
[00:58:02] Elon Musk: Most of it's, you know, I have it, it's just housekeeping functions, you know, keeping
[00:58:05] Elon Musk: it hot, going, and breathing, and that kind of thing.
[00:58:09] So you've got maybe 10 watts of higher brain function in a human.
[00:58:14] And we've managed to build civilization with 10 watts of a biological computer.
[00:58:21] Elon Musk: And that biological computer has like a 20 year boot sequence.
[00:58:26] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[00:58:27] Elon Musk: But it's very power efficient.
[00:58:31] Elon Musk: So given that humans are capable of inventing general relativity and quantum mechanics and
[00:58:40] Elon Musk: or discovering general opportunity, like inventing aircraft, lasers, the internet, and discovering
[00:58:47] Elon Musk: physics with a 10 watt meat computer essentially, then this clearly a massive opportunity for
[00:58:58] Elon Musk: improving the efficiency of AI compute.
[00:59:03] Elon Musk: It's because it's, it's, it's currently many orders of magnitude away from that.
[00:59:07] Elon Musk: And it's still the case that a 100 megawatt, or even, you know, a gigawatt, a I see a
[00:59:16] Elon Musk: computer at this point can't do everything that a human can do.
[00:59:21] Elon Musk: It will be able to, but it can't yet.
[00:59:25] Elon Musk: So we hope that, like I said, we've got this obvious case of human brains being very power
[00:59:32] Elon Musk: efficient and achieving and building civilization with a, you know, with 10 watts of compute.
[00:59:40] Elon Musk: And a very slow, and our bandwidth is very low.
[00:59:44] Elon Musk: So that the speed of which we communicate information to each other is extremely low.
[00:59:47] Elon Musk: You know, we're not communicating at a terrible.
[00:59:50] Elon Musk: We're communicating more like 10 bits per second.
[00:59:55] Elon Musk: So, um, that's naturally just the conclusion that there's massive opportunity for me to
[01:00:03] Elon Musk: be more power efficient with with AI.
[01:00:05] Elon Musk: And a Tesla and at XAI, we're both, we continue to see massive improvements in, in the
[01:00:11] Elon Musk: internet's computer efficiency.
[01:00:14] So yeah.
[01:00:16] I think that there's a moment where you would justify stopping all the traditional
[01:00:24] Jason Calacanis: cars and just going completely all in on cyber cab.
[01:00:28] Jason Calacanis: If you felt like the learning was good enough and that the system was safe enough, is there
[01:00:34] Jason Calacanis: ever a moment like that?
[01:00:35] Jason Calacanis: Or do you think you'll always kind of do a track and always do both?
[01:00:38] Jason Calacanis: I mean, all of the costs we make right now are capable of being a robot taxi.
[01:00:43] Elon Musk: So there's a little confusion of the terminology because the, the, the, our cars look normal,
[01:00:50] Elon Musk: you know, like model three or model Y looks, it's good looking car, but it looks normal.
[01:00:54] Elon Musk: But it has an advanced AI computer and advanced AI software and cameras.
[01:00:59] Elon Musk: And we didn't want the cameras to stick out.
[01:01:01] Elon Musk: So we, you know, so that we wanted them to be ugly or stick out.
[01:01:04] Elon Musk: So, so we, you know, we put them, they're sort of an out of trees of locations.
[01:01:08] Elon Musk: You know, the Ford looking camera cameras are in front of the review mirror.
[01:01:13] Elon Musk: The side view mirrors are in the side repeaters.
[01:01:15] Elon Musk: Oh, this, the side cameras are in the side repeaters.
[01:01:17] Elon Musk: That the rear cameras, you know, just in the, you know, above the license plate, actually,
[01:01:22] Elon Musk: typically where the review camera is in a car.
[01:01:26] And, you know, and, and the diagonal Ford ones are in the B pillars.
[01:01:31] Elon Musk: They can be look closely.
[01:01:32] Elon Musk: You can see all the cameras, but, but you have to look closely.
[01:01:34] Elon Musk: We just didn't want them to be to stick out like, you know, warts or something.
[01:01:39] Elon Musk: But actually all the cars we make are hyper intelligent and have the cameras in the right
[01:01:45] Elon Musk: places.
[01:01:46] Elon Musk: They just looked normal.
[01:01:48] Elon Musk: And so, so all of the cars we make are capable of unsuitable, full autonomy.
[01:01:55] Elon Musk: Now we have a dedicated part, which is the cyber cab, which has no, no steering wheel
[01:02:00] Elon Musk: pedals, which are obviously vestigial in an autonomous world.
[01:02:06] Elon Musk: And we saw production of the cyber cab in Q2 next year.
[01:02:11] And we'll scale that up to quite high volume.
[01:02:13] Elon Musk: I think ultimately we'll make millions of cyber cabs per year.
[01:02:18] But it is important to emphasize that all of our cars are capable of being robotic taxis.
[01:02:22] Elon Musk: The cyber cab is gorgeous.
[01:02:25] David Sacks: I told you I'd buy two of those if you put a steering wheel in them.
[01:02:28] David Sacks: And there is a big movement.
[01:02:29] David Sacks: We're not putting a steering wheel.
[01:02:31] People are begging for it.
[01:02:33] David Sacks: Why not?
[01:02:34] David Sacks: Why not let us buy a couple, you know, just the first ones off the line and drive them.
[01:02:38] David Sacks: I mean, it's they look great.
[01:02:40] It's like the perfect model.
[01:02:41] David Sacks: You always had a vision for a model too, right?
[01:02:43] David Sacks: Like isn't like the perfect model too in addition to being a cyber cab.
[01:02:47] David Sacks: Look, the reality is people may think they want to drive their car, but the reality is
[01:02:51] Elon Musk: that they don't.
[01:02:53] Elon Musk: How many times have you been saying in group or alift and you said, you know what, I wish
[01:02:57] Elon Musk: I could take over from the driver.
[01:03:00] And I wish I could get off my phone and take over from the Uber driver and drive to my
[01:03:06] Elon Musk: destination.
[01:03:07] Elon Musk: How many times have you thought to yourself?
[01:03:09] Elon Musk: No, it's quite the opposite.
[01:03:11] David Sacks: A room for a time.
[01:03:12] David Sacks: So, okay.
[01:03:13] Elon Musk: I have the model Y and it just got 14.
[01:03:17] David Sacks: I have Juniper and I got the 14 one and I put it on Mad Max mode the last couple of
[01:03:20] David Sacks: days.
[01:03:21] David Sacks: That is Mad Max mode.
[01:03:23] David Sacks: A unique experience.
[01:03:24] David Sacks: I was like, wait a second, this thing is driving in a very unique fashion.
[01:03:32] David Sacks: Yeah.
[01:03:33] Yeah.
[01:03:34] Elon Musk: It seems you want to get to a destination in a hurry.
[01:03:36] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:03:37] David Sacks: I used to give cab drivers a extra 20 bucks to do that.
[01:03:41] David Sacks: Medical appointment or something.
[01:03:42] Elon Musk: I don't know.
[01:03:43] Elon Musk: Yeah, but it's, it feels like it's getting very close.
[01:03:46] David Sacks: We do have to be very careful.
[01:03:49] David Sacks: You know, Uber had a car accident with the safety driver.
[01:03:52] David Sacks: The cruise had a terrible accident.
[01:03:54] David Sacks: It wasn't their fault exactly except, you know, somebody got hit and then they hit the
[01:03:59] person the second time and they got dragged.
[01:04:02] Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:03] David Sacks: There's this pretty high stakes.
[01:04:04] David Sacks: So, you're being extremely cautious.
[01:04:07] Elon Musk: The car is actually extremely capable right now.
[01:04:10] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:04:11] Elon Musk: But we are being extremely cautious and we're being paranoid about it because to your point,
[01:04:17] Elon Musk: even one accident would be headline news.
[01:04:19] Elon Musk: Well, probably worldwide headline news.
[01:04:21] Especially if it's a Tesla.
[01:04:22] David Sacks: Like Waymo, I think it gets a bit of a pass.
[01:04:24] David Sacks: I think there's, I have to country or a number of people probably would, you know, go extra
[01:04:29] David Sacks: hard on you.
[01:04:30] David Sacks: Yes.
[01:04:31] Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:33] Yeah.
[01:04:34] Elon Musk: Not everyone in the press is my friend.
[01:04:37] How did you notice that?
[01:04:40] David Sacks: Yes, I'm a little, little, uh, tagging a stick.
[01:04:43] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:04:44] Elon Musk: So, but people are pressuring you to go fast and I think is everybody's got to just
[01:04:51] David Sacks: take their time with this thing.
[01:04:53] David Sacks: It's obviously going to happen.
[01:04:54] David Sacks: But I just get very nervous that the pressure to put these things on the road faster than
[01:04:59] David Sacks: they're ready is just a little crazy.
[01:05:03] David Sacks: So, I applaud you for putting the safety monitor in, doing the safety drive in no shame in
[01:05:08] David Sacks: the safety driver game.
[01:05:09] David Sacks: It's so much the right decision, obviously.
[01:05:12] David Sacks: But people are criticizing you for it.
[01:05:13] David Sacks: I think it's dumb.
[01:05:14] David Sacks: It's the right thing to do.
[01:05:16] David Sacks: Yes.
[01:05:17] Elon Musk: So, I'm just going to be expected to take to not have any sort of safety, uh, occupant
[01:05:23] Elon Musk: or or there's hardly a driver that just says monitor safety safety monitor just to just
[01:05:29] Elon Musk: sit, they just sit in the car and don't do anything.
[01:05:32] Elon Musk: Safety do.
[01:05:33] Yeah.
[01:05:34] Um, so, uh, but we do expect that that the cause will be driving around without any, any
[01:05:39] Elon Musk: safety monitor, um, before the end of the year.
[01:05:42] Elon Musk: So sometimes it's a number.
[01:05:44] Elon Musk: In Austin, yeah, I mean, you got a number of wraps under your belt in Austin and it
[01:05:48] David Sacks: feels like pretty well.
[01:05:51] You guys have done a great job figuring out where the trouble spots are.
[01:05:55] David Sacks: Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you learned in the first, I don't know, it's
[01:06:00] David Sacks: been like three or four months of this so far.
[01:06:01] David Sacks: What did you learn the first three or four months of the Austin experiment?
[01:06:05] It's gone pretty smoothly.
[01:06:09] Elon Musk: A lot of things that we're learning are just how to manage a fleet.
[01:06:14] Elon Musk: Like it's because you've got to write all the fleet management software, right?
[01:06:17] Elon Musk: So, yeah.
[01:06:18] Elon Musk: And you've got to write the right handling software.
[01:06:21] Elon Musk: You've got to write basically the software that Uber has, you've got to write that software.
[01:06:25] Elon Musk: It's just summoning a robot car instead of a car with a driver.
[01:06:28] Um, so, so a lot of things we're doing with, we're scaling up the number of cars to say,
[01:06:34] Elon Musk: say, what happens if you have a thousand cars?
[01:06:36] Elon Musk: Like so, we think probably we'll have a thousand cars or more in the Bay Area by the other
[01:06:43] Elon Musk: here, probably 500 or more in the greater Austin area.
[01:06:50] And you know, if you have to make sure the cars don't all, for example, go to the same
[01:06:58] Elon Musk: supercharger.
[01:06:59] Elon Musk: That's fine.
[01:07:01] Elon Musk: Right?
[01:07:03] So, or we'll go to the same intersection.
[01:07:06] Elon Musk: Um, there's this, it's like, what do these cars do?
[01:07:10] Elon Musk: And then like sometimes there's a high demand and sometimes there's this low demand.
[01:07:15] Elon Musk: What do you do during those times?
[01:07:17] Elon Musk: Do you have the car so called the block?
[01:07:19] Elon Musk: Do you have a try to find a parking space?
[01:07:21] Elon Musk: Um, the, and then, you know, sometimes the like say it's a, it's a, you know, disabled
[01:07:28] Elon Musk: parking space or something, but the, the riding spaded or the thing spaded or the car's
[01:07:32] Elon Musk: like, oh, look at parking space, we jump right in there.
[01:07:34] Elon Musk: It's like, get a ticket.
[01:07:35] Elon Musk: You got to look carefully.
[01:07:37] Elon Musk: Make sure it's, you know, it's not an illegal parking space or, or, or, or, or it sees,
[01:07:43] Elon Musk: it sees a space to park and it's like ridiculously tight.
[01:07:47] Elon Musk: But it's the park and get in there.
[01:07:50] Elon Musk: Um, with like, you know, three inches on either side, time, bad computer.
[01:07:55] David Sacks: Yeah.
[01:07:56] Yeah.
[01:07:57] Elon Musk: But, but nobody else would be able to get in the car if you do that.
[01:08:01] Elon Musk: Um, so, um, you know, there's just like all these odd walk corner cases.
[01:08:05] Elon Musk: Um, and, um, uh, and regulators like regulators are all very, um, yeah, they're, they have
[01:08:16] David Sacks: different levels of persiccateness and regulations depending on the city, depending on the
[01:08:21] David Sacks: airport.
[01:08:22] David Sacks: And it's just, yeah.
[01:08:24] You know, very different everywhere.
[01:08:26] David Sacks: That's going to just be a lot of blocking and tackling and it just takes time.
[01:08:29] David Sacks: Elon, yeah.
[01:08:30] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[01:08:31] Elon Musk: In order to take people to Santa's A airport, like Santa's A, you actually have to connect
[01:08:35] Elon Musk: to Santa's A airport servers.
[01:08:37] Elon Musk: Um, and, and because you have to pay a fee every time you go off.
[01:08:41] Elon Musk: So, so the car actually has to do a remote call.
[01:08:45] Elon Musk: The robot car has to do, you know, remote procedure called to, to Santa's A airport servers
[01:08:51] Elon Musk: to, to, uh, say I'm dropping someone off at the airport and charging whatever five bucks,
[01:08:57] Elon Musk: um, which is like, they're all these like cookie things like that.
[01:09:00] Elon Musk: The, the, the, like airports are somewhat of a racket.
[01:09:03] Elon Musk: Um, yeah.
[01:09:05] Um, so, so that's like, you know, we had to solve that thing.
[01:09:09] Elon Musk: But it's kind of funny that the robot car is like calling the server, the, the airport
[01:09:13] Elon Musk: server to, to, uh, you know, charge its credit card or, uh, to send a fax.
[01:09:21] David Sacks: Yeah, we're going to be dropping off at this time.
[01:09:23] But it will, it will soon become extremely normal to see cars going around with no one
[01:09:27] Elon Musk: in them.
[01:09:28] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:09:29] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[01:09:30] Elon Musk: Excuse me.
[01:09:31] I'm just before, uh, we lose you.
[01:09:33] SPEAKER_04: I want to like ask if you saw the Bill Gates memo that he put out.
[01:09:37] SPEAKER_04: A lot of people are talking about this memo.
[01:09:39] It's like, you know, did go.
[01:09:41] SPEAKER_04: I just like, Billy G is not my love.
[01:09:46] Oh, man.
[01:09:48] Like did, did, did climate change become, did it become like woke?
[01:09:55] SPEAKER_04: And is it over?
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_04: Like, you know, like what happened and what's, what, what happened with Billy G?
[01:10:01] SPEAKER_04: I mean, you know, sure.
[01:10:03] SPEAKER_04: That's a great question.
[01:10:05] Jason Calacanis: Great question.
[01:10:06] Jason Calacanis: Yeah.
[01:10:08] You know, you, you think that some of my book is who I clearly started to take, you
[01:10:14] Elon Musk: know, started a technology company that's one of the biggest companies in the world, Microsoft,
[01:10:18] Elon Musk: um, being, uh, you, you, you think he'd be really quite, um, you know, strong in the
[01:10:24] Elon Musk: sciences.
[01:10:26] Elon Musk: Um, but actually my, at least direct conversations with him have, um, he, he's, he is not strong
[01:10:34] Elon Musk: in the sciences.
[01:10:35] Elon Musk: Like, like, the kid, the, yeah.
[01:10:37] Elon Musk: This is the really short and surprising.
[01:10:39] Elon Musk: You know, like, he came to visit me at the Tezak Gigapak tree in, in Austin and was telling
[01:10:45] Elon Musk: me that it's impossible to have a long-range, uh, semi truck.
[01:10:49] Um, and I was like, well, but we literally have them.
[01:10:54] Elon Musk: Um, and you can drive them and Pepsi is literally using them right now.
[01:11:00] Elon Musk: And you can drive them yourself or send some of our, obviously, well, guess I can drive
[01:11:03] Elon Musk: them yourself, but you can send, uh, a trusted, uh, person to drive the truck and verify
[01:11:09] Elon Musk: that it can do the things that we say it's doing.
[01:11:10] Elon Musk: And it's like, no, no, it doesn't work.
[01:11:12] Elon Musk: It doesn't work.
[01:11:13] Elon Musk: And I'm like, um, okay.
[01:11:15] Elon Musk: I'm not kind of stuck here.
[01:11:18] Elon Musk: Um, um, then it's like, I was like, well, so it must be that, um, you disagree with the
[01:11:26] Elon Musk: watt-housers for kilogram of the battery pack so that you're, you must think that perhaps
[01:11:31] Elon Musk: we can't achieve the energy density of the battery pack or that the watt-housers per mile
[01:11:35] Elon Musk: of the truck is too high and that when you combine those two numbers, the range is low.
[01:11:40] Elon Musk: And so which one of those numbers do you think we have wrong?
[01:11:44] Elon Musk: And what numbers do you think are correct?
[01:11:45] Elon Musk: And you didn't know any of the numbers.
[01:11:48] And I'm like, well, then doesn't it seem that it's perhaps, um, you know, uh, premature
[01:11:54] Elon Musk: to conclude that a long-range semi cannot work?
[01:11:57] Elon Musk: If you do not know the energy density of the battery pack or the energy efficiency of
[01:12:00] Elon Musk: the truck chassis.
[01:12:01] Elon Musk: Hmm.
[01:12:02] Hmm.
[01:12:03] But yeah, he's now taking 180 on climate.
[01:12:10] David Sacks: He's saying maybe this is just a game.
[01:12:14] Elon Musk: Yeah, I was saying that's wrong.
[01:12:18] Elon Musk: Totally retarded.
[01:12:19] David Sacks: Well, we'll guess that the climate is gay and retarded.
[01:12:25] Elon Musk: Come on.
[01:12:26] Elon Musk: I maybe.
[01:12:27] Elon Musk: I was about to say, is it got to put up?
[01:12:30] David Sacks: Do they have to stand up a data center for say a malt mean or something?
[01:12:34] David Sacks: I don't know.
[01:12:35] David Sacks: What is Azure?
[01:12:36] David Sacks: No.
[01:12:37] David Sacks: It changed this position.
[01:12:41] I can't figure out why.
[01:12:43] I mean, you know, I mean, the reality of the whole climate change thing is, is that the,
[01:12:50] Elon Musk: um, you know, you've just had sort of people who say it doesn't exist at all.
[01:12:54] Elon Musk: And then people who say it's, it's our super-lomest and saying the, you know, Rar is going
[01:12:58] Elon Musk: to be underwater in five years.
[01:13:00] Elon Musk: And obviously neither of those two positions are true.
[01:13:03] Um, you know, the, the reality is you can measure the, the common constriction atmosphere.
[01:13:08] Elon Musk: Again, you can just literally buy a CO2 monitor from Amazon, it's like 50 bucks and, um,
[01:13:15] Elon Musk: you measure yourself.
[01:13:17] Elon Musk: Um, and, uh, you know, and you can say, okay, we'll look the, the, the, the, the possible
[01:13:23] Elon Musk: million of CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily at two to three per year.
[01:13:27] Elon Musk: Um, at some point, if you, uh, continue to take, to take, uh, millions, especially
[01:13:34] Elon Musk: 20 of tons of carbon from deep underground and transfer it to the atmosphere and oceans.
[01:13:40] Elon Musk: So you transfer it from deep underground into the surface cycle.
[01:13:43] Elon Musk: You will change the chemical constituency of the atmosphere and oceans.
[01:13:47] Elon Musk: Just, that you're just literally will.
[01:13:49] Elon Musk: Um, then you can only, I, they, they, I'll, what degree?
[01:13:52] Elon Musk: And over what time scale?
[01:13:54] Elon Musk: Um, and the reality is that, in my opinion, is that we've got at least 50 years, uh, before
[01:14:01] Elon Musk: it's a serious issue.
[01:14:02] Elon Musk: Um, I don't think we've got 500 years, uh, but, but we've probably got, you know, 50, um,
[01:14:08] Elon Musk: it's, it's not, it's not five years.
[01:14:10] Elon Musk: Um, so if you're trying to get to the right order of magnitude of a accuracy, um, I'd say
[01:14:15] Elon Musk: that the concern level of full climate change is on the order of 50 years, it's definitely
[01:14:18] Elon Musk: in our five.
[01:14:19] Elon Musk: And I think it probably isn't 500.
[01:14:21] Elon Musk: Um, so, uh, so really the, the right course of action is actually just the reasonable
[01:14:26] Elon Musk: course of action, which is to lean in the direction of sustainable energy.
[01:14:30] Um, and, uh, and lean in the direction of, of solar, um, and, so, of a sort of solar
[01:14:37] Elon Musk: battery future.
[01:14:39] And, and, and generally have the rules of the system, um, uh, lean in that direction.
[01:14:47] Elon Musk: I, I don't think we need massive subsidies.
[01:14:50] Elon Musk: But then we also shouldn't have massive subsidies for the oil and gas industry.
[01:14:54] Hmm.
[01:14:55] Elon Musk: Okay.
[01:14:56] Elon Musk: So the oil and gas, gas industry has massive tax write offs.
[01:14:59] Elon Musk: Now, they don't even think of it subsidies, um, because these things have been in place
[01:15:04] Elon Musk: for, in some cases, you know, 80 years.
[01:15:08] Um, but they're not there for other industries.
[01:15:11] Elon Musk: So when you've got a special tax conditions that are in one industry and not, not, not
[01:15:14] Elon Musk: the industry, I call that a subsidy.
[01:15:16] Elon Musk: Obviously it, it is.
[01:15:17] Elon Musk: But they're taking it for granted for so long and oil and gas that they don't think of
[01:15:19] Elon Musk: it as a subsidy.
[01:15:21] Elon Musk: Um, so the, the right course of action of course is to remove, in my opinion, to remove subsidies
[01:15:25] Elon Musk: from all industries.
[01:15:27] Um, but, but the, the, the political reality is that the oil and gas industry, um, is
[01:15:32] Elon Musk: very strong in their republican party, but not in the democratic party.
[01:15:35] Elon Musk: So you, you will not see obviously even the tiniest subsidy being removed from the, uh,
[01:15:39] Elon Musk: oil, gas and coal industry.
[01:15:40] Elon Musk: In fact, there were some that were added to the oil, gas and coal industry, uh, in, in
[01:15:45] Elon Musk: the, the, the sort of big bull.
[01:15:49] Elon Musk: Um, and they were a lot, a massive number of, of sustainable energy incentives that
[01:15:55] Elon Musk: were removed, some of which I agreed with by the way.
[01:15:58] Elon Musk: Um, some of the incentives have gone too far.
[01:16:01] Um, but, um, anyway, the, the, the, the, the actual, I think object, it's a correct scientific
[01:16:10] Elon Musk: conclusion in my opinion.
[01:16:12] Elon Musk: Um, and I, and I think we'll come back this up with, with solid reasoning.
[01:16:15] Elon Musk: Let me ask, ask rock, for example.
[01:16:18] Elon Musk: Uh, uh, it is that we should, um, we should lean in the direction of moving towards a
[01:16:25] Elon Musk: sustainable energy future.
[01:16:27] Um, we, we will eventually run out of, uh, oil, gas and coal to burn anyway, uh, because
[01:16:33] Elon Musk: of fights, it's a, it's a finite, there's a finite amount of that stuff.
[01:16:37] Elon Musk: Um, and we will eventually have to go to something that lasts a long time that is
[01:16:40] Elon Musk: sustainable.
[01:16:41] Elon Musk: But to your point about the irony of things, it seems to be the case that making energy
[01:16:47] SPEAKER_04: with solar is cheaper than making energy with some of these carbon-based sources today.
[01:16:51] SPEAKER_04: And so the irony is, it's already working.
[01:16:54] SPEAKER_04: I mean, the market is moving in that direction and this notion that we need to kind of force
[01:16:58] SPEAKER_04: everyone into a model of behavior.
[01:17:00] SPEAKER_04: It's just naturally going to change because we've got better systems, you know, you and
[01:17:04] SPEAKER_04: others have engineered better systems that make these alternatives cheaper and therefore
[01:17:09] SPEAKER_04: they're winning, like they're actually winning in the market, which is great.
[01:17:13] Uh, they can't, they can't win if there are subsidies to support the old systems, obviously.
[01:17:17] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, by the way, there are actually massive disincentives of POSFOLO because the,
[01:17:23] Elon Musk: because China, uh, China, uh, is, is a massive producer of solar panels that during China
[01:17:28] Elon Musk: does an incredible job of solar manufacturing, of solar panel manufacturing.
[01:17:32] Elon Musk: Really incredible. Um, they have one on, like roughly one and a half terawatts of solar production
[01:17:38] Elon Musk: right now. Um, and they're only using a terawatts per year. But by the way, that's a gigantic number.
[01:17:44] Elon Musk: The, the, uh, the average, uh, US power consumption is only half a terawatts.
[01:17:51] So just think about that for a second. China's, uh,
[01:17:56] you know, China's solar panel production, max capacity is one and a half terawatts per year.
[01:18:02] Uh, US steady state power usage is half a terawatts.
[01:18:06] Elon Musk: Now, no, you do have to, to reduce, you say if you do, if produce one and a half terawatts
[01:18:10] Elon Musk: a year of solar, you need, you need to add that with batteries taken to account that,
[01:18:14] Elon Musk: the, the diversity between night and day, the fact that the solar panel is not always, um,
[01:18:19] Elon Musk: pointed directly at the sun, that kind of thing. So you can divide by five ish to say that,
[01:18:25] Elon Musk: but that still means that China has the ability to produce solar panels that have a steady state
[01:18:31] Elon Musk: output that is roughly two thirds that of the entire use economy from all sources,
[01:18:37] Elon Musk: which means that just with solar alone, China can, uh, in one in, in 18 months, um, produce
[01:18:43] Elon Musk: enough solar panels to power the entire, the United States, all the electricity in the United States.
[01:18:48] What do you think about near field solar, AKA nuclear?
[01:18:53] I think the favor of, look, make, make energy from any, any way you, you, you want that, that
[01:18:58] Elon Musk: doesn't, that doesn't like obviously, uh, harmful to the environment. Um, generally,
[01:19:03] Elon Musk: people don't welcome a nuclear reactor and they're back on, um, they're, they're not like
[01:19:08] Elon Musk: championing it. Put it here. Put it on my dad. Put it on my roof.
[01:19:16] Elon Musk: If you're an extra neighbor said, hey, I'm selling my house and they're putting a reactor there.
[01:19:20] Elon Musk: Yeah.
[01:19:23] Elon Musk: Well, you know, it's a big, a lot of response will be negative.
[01:19:28] Elon Musk: It, very few people will embrace a nuclear reactor at, um, adjacent to their house.
[01:19:33] Elon Musk: Um, so, um, but nonetheless, I, I do think nuclear is actually very safe.
[01:19:40] Elon Musk: The, the, it's, there's a lot of scare monitor, sort of scare monitoring and, and probably
[01:19:45] Elon Musk: I end up around, uh, phishing, if the signal to a vision, um, and, and, but phishing is actually
[01:19:50] Elon Musk: very safe. They obviously have this on, uh, you know, the Navy, US Navy has this on submarines
[01:19:54] Elon Musk: and aircraft carriers and with, with people really working right, let me see, the
[01:19:59] Elon Musk: submarines are pretty crowded place and they have a nuclear power submarine. So, um,
[01:20:05] so, so I think I think phishing is fine as, as a, as an option. Um, the, the regulatory environment
[01:20:12] Elon Musk: makes it very difficult to actually get that done. Um, and, and then it is important to appreciate
[01:20:17] Elon Musk: just the sheer magnitude of the power of the Sun. So, this is, here are some just important
[01:20:25] Elon Musk: basic facts, um, even Wikipedia has these facts right. Um, you know, so you're even, you've
[01:20:31] Elon Musk: got to have these rock, the best answer, but even Wikipedia has, yeah, you know, Wikipedia got
[01:20:36] right. Yes, yes. I'm saying, what I'm saying, even Wikipedia's got, got these facts right.
[01:20:40] Elon Musk: Um, the, the, the Sun is about 99.8% of the mass of the solar system.
[01:20:47] Uh, then, then Jupiter is about 0.1%, and everything else is in the remaining 0.1%, and we are,
[01:20:54] Elon Musk: much less than 0.1%. Um, so, um, if you burnt all of the mass of the solar system,
[01:21:04] okay, then the total energy produced by the Sun would still run up to 100%.
[01:21:10] Mm-hmm.
[01:21:12] They've just burnt Earth, um, the whole planet, and burnt Jupiter, which is very big, and,
[01:21:19] Elon Musk: and quite challenging to burn. Uh, you, you know, turn to your new Jupiter into thermonuclear
[01:21:27] Elon Musk: active. Um, it wouldn't matter. The Sun, it, it committed to the Sun. The Sun is 99.8% of the
[01:21:33] Elon Musk: mass of the solar system, and everything else is in the miscellaneous category. So, um,
[01:21:39] like basically no matter what you do, total energy produced, um, in our solar system,
[01:21:45] rounds up to 100% from the Sun. You could even throw another Jupiter in that. Um,
[01:21:51] Elon Musk: so we're going to snag a Jupiter from somewhere else, um, and somehow, I'll tell a, what,
[01:21:56] Elon Musk: you could tell a, what two more Jupiter's, uh, into our solar system, burn them,
[01:22:00] Elon Musk: and the Sun would still run up to 100%. You know, since, as long as you're at 99.6%,
[01:22:07] Elon Musk: you're still rounding up to 100%. Um, maybe that gives some perspective of why solar is really
[01:22:15] Elon Musk: the thing that matters. And, and, and as soon as you start thinking about things in a,
[01:22:20] Elon Musk: sort of a grand scale, like, kotoshib scale two civilizations, it becomes very, very obvious.
[01:22:25] Elon Musk: It's, it's, I'm not saying anything that's new, by the way. Like, uh, anyone who studies physics
[01:22:30] Elon Musk: has known this for, you know, very long time. Um, in fact, kotoshib, I think, was
[01:22:36] Elon Musk: a Russian physicist who came up with this idea, I think in the 60s, um, just as a way to classify
[01:22:42] Elon Musk: civilizations, um, where kotoshib scale one would be, uh, you've used, you're, you're, you've
[01:22:49] Elon Musk: honnest most of the energy of, of the planet. Kotoshib scale two, you're, you've honnest most of the
[01:22:54] Elon Musk: energy of your sun. Kotoshib three, you've honnest most of the energy of galaxy.
[01:23:00] Now, we're only about, I don't know, one percent or a few, a few percent of kotoshib scale one
[01:23:07] right now, just optimistically. Um, so, um, but as soon as you go to kotoshib scale two, we
[01:23:14] Elon Musk: were talking about the power of the sun, then you're, you're really just saying, um, everything is
[01:23:20] Elon Musk: all the power. And, and, and, and that the rest is in the noise. Um, and, um, yeah. So, like the,
[01:23:31] you know, like the, the sun produces about a billion times, or, uh, call it, oh, well over a billion
[01:23:38] Elon Musk: times, more energy than everything on earth, combined. It's crazy. It's my blood. Right. Yeah.
[01:23:50] Yeah. Solar is the obvious solution to all this. And yeah. I mean, short term.
[01:23:54] Yeah. Do you some of these other sources? But hey, there it is. Now, and I think it would like
[01:23:58] David Sacks: to start powered. Like maybe we got a branding issue here. Yeah. Star power. So, solar power,
[01:24:04] Elon Musk: it's, it's starlight. Yeah. Starlight. Uh, it's the power of a blazing sun. Um,
[01:24:12] Elon Musk: yeah. How much energy does an entire star have? Yeah. Well, more than enough. All right.
[01:24:23] Uh, and also you really need to keep the power local. Um, so sometimes people, honestly,
[01:24:31] Elon Musk: I've had these discussions so many times, it's, it's where they say, well, like, would you beam
[01:24:36] Elon Musk: the power back to earth? I'm like, do you want to melt us? Yeah. Because you would melt us if
[01:24:43] Elon Musk: you did that. Um, we'd be very pricey in an instant. Uh, so you really need to keep the power
[01:24:48] Elon Musk: local, um, you know, basically distributed power. And, and, and I guess most of it we use for
[01:24:54] Elon Musk: intelligence. Uh, so it's like the, the future is like a whole, a whole bunch of, um, solar powered
[01:24:59] Elon Musk: AI satellites. But you know, the only, the only, the only thing that makes the star work is it
[01:25:04] SPEAKER_04: just happens to have a lot of mass. So it has a lot of needs to ignite the fusion, to ignite
[01:25:09] SPEAKER_04: the fusion reaction, right? But like, we could ignite the fusion reaction on earth now. I don't
[01:25:13] SPEAKER_04: know, like if your view has changed, I think we talked about this a couple of years ago where you
[01:25:16] SPEAKER_04: were pretty like, we don't know if or when fusion becomes real here. But theoretically, we could
[01:25:22] SPEAKER_04: take like 10, no, one of the camera, my opinion on, um, uh, so, um, you know, I studied physics and
[01:25:29] Elon Musk: college, um, at one point in high school, I was thinking about a career in physics. One of my
[01:25:33] Elon Musk: sons actually is, does a career in physics. Um, but my problem is I can't be conclusions that I'd
[01:25:38] Elon Musk: be waiting for, uh, a collider or, or a telescope. They don't have any, and not to get that collider
[01:25:44] Elon Musk: in physics. But I have it. It's strong interest in the subject. Um, so, um, so, so, uh, my opinion on,
[01:25:53] Elon Musk: say, creating a fusion reaction on earth is, I think this is actually not a hot problem. Um,
[01:25:57] Elon Musk: actually, I mean, it's a little hard. I mean, it's, it's not like totally trivial. But if you just
[01:26:02] Elon Musk: scale up a talkumuck, uh, the, the bigger you make it, the easier the bomb gets. So, the, the,
[01:26:08] Elon Musk: the, you got a surface volume ratio, uh, thing where, you know, you, you're trying to maintain
[01:26:13] Elon Musk: a really hot core while having a wall that doesn't melt. So, uh, uh, that's a similar problem with
[01:26:21] Elon Musk: rocket engines. You've got a super hot core in the rocket engine, but you don't want the,
[01:26:26] Elon Musk: the walls, the chamber walls of the rocket engine to melt. So you have a temperature gradient,
[01:26:31] Elon Musk: uh, where it's very hot in the middle and, and, and gradually gets called,
[01:26:34] Elon Musk: called enough as you get to the, uh, perimeter, gets, as you get to the, uh, you know, the,
[01:26:39] Elon Musk: the chamber walls in the rocket engine, where the, it doesn't melt, uh, because you've lowered the
[01:26:44] Elon Musk: temperature, um, and, and you got a temperature gradient. So, just, if you just scale up, uh, uh,
[01:26:51] Elon Musk: you know, the, the donut reactor, tockumach, um, and, um, and, and, and improve your surface
[01:26:58] Elon Musk: volume ratio, that becomes much easier. And you, you can absolutely, in my opinion,
[01:27:03] Elon Musk: no, I, I think, I think anyone who looks at the math, uh, you can, you can make, uh, a, a,
[01:27:11] Elon Musk: a reactor that is pot that generates more energy than I consumes. And the big you make it,
[01:27:16] Elon Musk: the easier it is. And in the limit, you're just to have a giant gravitationally contained
[01:27:20] Elon Musk: thermonuclear reactor like the Sun. So, uh, which requires no maintenance in its free.
[01:27:26] Elon Musk: Um, so this is also why, why would we bother doing that on making a little itty-beddy Sun
[01:27:34] that's so microscopic, acute belly notice, um, on Earth when we've got the giant free one in the sky.
[01:27:41] Yeah, but we'll, but we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll only get a fraction of 1% of that energy on the
[01:27:46] SPEAKER_04: planet Earth. We have to go, yeah, right. So we've got to figure out how to wrap
[01:27:50] SPEAKER_04: the Sun if we're going to harness that energy. That's our, our long curve.
[01:27:56] If people want to have fun with reactors, you know, um, that's fine. Have fun with reactors.
[01:28:01] Elon Musk: But it's not a serious endeavor compared to the Sun. Um, you know, it's, it's, it's sort of a,
[01:28:06] Elon Musk: a fun, it's a fun science project to make a, um, the, the nuclear reactor, but it's not, um,
[01:28:12] Elon Musk: it's, it's just peanuts compared to the Sun. And, and even the, the, the solar energy that
[01:28:16] Elon Musk: does reach Earth, um, is a gigawatt per square kilometer or roughly, you know, close to
[01:28:22] Elon Musk: 1.5 gigawatts per square mile. Um, so that's a lot, you know, um, and the commercially available panels
[01:28:32] Elon Musk: are around 25, almost 20, 26 percent efficiency. And maybe, you know, what you can do, and then
[01:28:39] Elon Musk: you say like, you should pack it densely, get an 80% packing density. You're going to, uh, which I
[01:28:45] Elon Musk: you know, you get a lot of places you can get an 80% pack density. You effectively have about, uh,
[01:28:51] Elon Musk: you know, uh, uh, 200 megawatts per square kilometer, uh, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and
[01:28:57] Elon Musk: you need to pair that with batteries. So, so you have continuous power. Um, although our power usage
[01:29:03] Elon Musk: drops considerably at night. So you need less batteries than you think. Um, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh,
[01:29:09] Elon Musk: and doesn't the, doesn't the question that we have?
[01:29:11] SPEAKER_04: Roughway to, like, maybe two-number to remember is, is a gig about our, it's quite a kilometer per day.
[01:29:17] Elon Musk: Is a, is a roughly correct number. But then, doesn't your technical challenge become the
[01:29:23] SPEAKER_04: scalability of manufacturing of those systems? So, you know, accessing the raw materials and
[01:29:29] SPEAKER_04: getting them out of the ground of planet earth to make them, to make enough of them, to get to
[01:29:32] SPEAKER_04: that sort of scale and that volume that you're talking about. And as you kind of think about what
[01:29:37] SPEAKER_04: it would take to get to that scale, like, do we have an ability to do that with what we have today?
[01:29:43] SPEAKER_04: Like, can we pull that much material out of the ground?
[01:29:46] Yes, solar panels are made of silicon, which is sand essentially. Um, and, um,
[01:29:52] Elon Musk: I guess more on the battery side, but, on the battery side, yeah, so the battery side, um, uh,
[01:29:58] Elon Musk: you know, the, like iron phosphate lithium-ion battery cells that, you know, earth,
[01:30:03] Elon Musk: and like, to throw out some, like, interesting factories here, um, most people don't know, uh, if you said,
[01:30:11] as measured by mass, what is the biggest element? What is, what is earth made of?
[01:30:15] Elon Musk: As measured as measured by mass? Uh, actually, it's, it's iron.
[01:30:19] Elon Musk: Iron, yeah. Iron, yeah, we're, we're, I think 32% iron, 30% oxygen,
[01:30:24] Elon Musk: and then everything else is in the remaining remaining percentage. So, um, we're basically a,
[01:30:30] Elon Musk: a rusty ball bearing, um, is with, that's earth. Um, and, and with, with, with, you know, a lot of
[01:30:37] Elon Musk: silicon at the surface in the, in the form of sand, um, and the, the iron phosphate, so,
[01:30:42] Elon Musk: so iron phosphate lithium-ion cells, you've iron extremely common, most common element on earth,
[01:30:48] Elon Musk: even in the crust, uh, and then phosphorus is also very common, um, and, um, and then the,
[01:30:53] Elon Musk: the anode is, is carbon, but also very common, and then lithium is also very common.
[01:30:59] Elon Musk: So the, that there's actually, you can, you can do the math, in fact, we did the math and published
[01:31:03] Elon Musk: it, published the math, but then we looked at it. Uh, um, it's on the Tesla website, um, that,
[01:31:08] Elon Musk: that shows that you can completely power earth with solar panels and batteries, um, and, uh,
[01:31:15] Elon Musk: there's no shortage of anything. All right. So, on that note, yeah, go get to work, Elon,
[01:31:24] David Sacks: and just power the earth while you're getting implants, uh, into people's brains and, uh,
[01:31:29] David Sacks: satellites and other good fun stuff. Good to see you, buddy. Yeah, good to see you guys. Yeah.
[01:31:34] Elon Musk: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for coming anytime. Thanks for doing this. You got the same link. Stop by
[01:31:38] David Sacks: the time. Thank you for coming today and thank you for liberating free speech three years ago.
[01:31:42] David Sacks: So, yeah, that was, that was a very important milestone.
[01:31:45] David Sacks: Yeah. And I see, well, you guys are in just different, different places. I guess this is a very
[01:31:49] Elon Musk: virtual situation. I've got the ranch sexism. Oh, you're ever in the same room.
[01:31:56] David Sacks: We try not to be only when we do that, that's some it, but otherwise, we just
[01:32:01] SPEAKER_04: saw them in the same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:32:04] Elon Musk: You're some of this is pretty fun. Yeah. Yes. We're a great time recounting, uh, SNL sketches that
[01:32:10] Elon Musk: didn't, didn't make it. Oh, God. It's just so many good ones. I mean, we didn't even get to the
[01:32:17] David Sacks: jeopardy ones. Yeah. Yeah. No, the show offensive. Oh, wait. I think we skipped a few that would have,
[01:32:25] Elon Musk: dramatically increased our probability of being killed. You take this one out.
[01:32:29] Jason Calacanis: Boys, I love you. I love you. I love you. I'm going to poker later. Take care.
[01:32:37] SPEAKER_02: We're like your winners ride.
[01:32:47] SPEAKER_03: It's got crazy with it.
[01:32:49] SPEAKER_03: Lombi West. I'm going to win. I'm going to win.
[01:32:54] What? What are winners?
[01:32:57] Besties are gone.
[01:33:08] We should all just get a room and just have one big huge or two because they're all just like this like
[01:33:12] SPEAKER_06: sexual tension that we just need to release our album.
[01:33:16] What your, that'd be. What your, your, your feet.
[01:33:21] SPEAKER_02: We need to get. Besties are gone.
[01:33:31] I'm going to win.
