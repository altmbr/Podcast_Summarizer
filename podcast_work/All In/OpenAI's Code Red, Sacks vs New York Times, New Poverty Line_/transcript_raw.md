[00:00:00] All right, everybody, welcome back to the number one podcast in the world,
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_03: the all in podcast in the news in your feed.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_03: We're ready to go.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_03: We've got the original quartet here.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_03: The bands back together.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_03: All right.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_03: First up on the docket.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_03: A code red has been called by Sam Altman.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_03: He sent a memo on Monday.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_03: Told employees to stop working on side quests, you know, like ads,
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_03: etc. and focus on the core chat GPT.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_03: The core experience make it faster, make it better.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_03: And I think we all know why because Gemini and GROC and Claude from
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_03: Anthropic have been crushing it.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_03: Chat GPT five.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_03: Let's call it what it is.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_03: It was a bit of a flop.
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_03: It didn't perform to expectations.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_03: We discussed that a couple of weeks ago or months ago.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_03: Anthropic is beating open AI in enterprise revenue.
[00:00:50] Starting this summer.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_03: And I talked about how, you know, previous episodes on the streets.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_03: I'm seeing more startups want to use Anthropic.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_03: It's API and also Google Gemini's API and they don't essentially
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_03: trust open AI to not steal their business.
[00:01:05] So it's big changes right now.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_03: Here is a chart based on data from July.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_03: Most of Anthropics revenue here is corporate.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_03: Most of open AI's as everybody knows is consumer.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_03: And here's another chart open AI's new infrastructure deals versus
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_03: revenue.
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_03: And this is just for 20, 25 alone.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_03: A lot of deals being made, but competition is fierce.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_03: Chimoff your thoughts here on the game on the field.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_03: Code red for people who don't know in our industry is when everybody reports
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_03: to you obviously gets focused on one thing.
[00:01:41] And that's apparently what Sam's doing.
[00:01:45] How do you interpret it?
[00:01:46] Look, I think that there are two things.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_01: Let's do the strategic lens and then the tactical lens.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_01: The strategic lens is that this is an incredibly vibrant and dynamic
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_01: market.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's too difficult and too early to pick winners other
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_01: than at the silicon layer.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_01: We're largely that die has been cast.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_01: I think that it's going to grow so we can talk about how there'll be
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_01: more competition, but it's roughly in video plus AMD plus Google plus a
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_01: bunch of inference silicon.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_01: So that's sort of that market.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: But above it at the model market, it reminds me frankly a lot of when we were
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_01: building Facebook, I remember sitting around our senior executive team,
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_01: six of us looking at my space, who was an order of magnitude bigger than us.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_01: And at some point, we were like, you know what?
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: Our product is just fundamentally better than theirs.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_01: And they had 100 million plus users.
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_01: And we had sort of 15, but we knew that we were eventually going to beat
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_01: them. Nobody else knew.
[00:02:42] And I feel like this market is similarly evolving, which is that you have
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_01: these early winners, but there's still so much work to do.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: There's still so many consumer expectations to define that it's too early to
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_01: know who's going to win.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_01: And ultimately, what we are learning, especially as all these markets converge
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_01: as a distribution still matters a ton, which favors Google.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_01: It favors meta, although meta is quite behind.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_01: And now it will still favor open AI because they have 800 million multi
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_01: actives. So then the tactical thing is what do you do?
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_01: Knowing that this dynamic is set up to have a lot of competition.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_01: And I think what you have to do is streamline the focus and try to make a
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_01: crisis out of every opportunity because look, the companies tend to just grow.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_01: This positive entropy tends to cause people to hire at every level.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: And you look around and there's thousands of people that you didn't know
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_01: even six months ago.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_01: And so I think if Sam can use different points in time to tighten the core
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_01: focus, they'll be better off.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_01: And I think that is what Google did a while back.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_01: If you remember the whole black George Washington thing, they were able to
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_01: use that as a rallying cry to streamline the organization and to focus and
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_01: to get their best and smartest people to work on the most highly leveraged tasks.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_01: And what you see now is an incredible over performance from where they were.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_01: I've said this before, but Gemini is incredible.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_01: So I think that that's what's happening.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_01: Too early to call it's a three or four horse race.
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_01: And Sam needs to batten down the hatches.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_01: And I think he used this opportunity to stop a bunch of peripheral activities.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: And as we saw, Serge called a personal code read.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_03: He said, I have to get in the office.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_03: I have to inspire everybody because this is existential for us.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_03: If we lose the search franchise, which they haven't the code red works.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_03: So David Freiburg, maybe you could discuss a little bit code red as a management
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_03: technique.
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_03: You were at Google.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_03: I don't know if they were calling code reds back then because you didn't have
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_03: any competition, but we're in a much different world here.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_03: This is the most competitive thing we've ever seen in our lifetime.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_03: I think Google had an early lead in search and then Microsoft launched and it
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_02: formed a code red model at Google that was called project Canada as the code word for
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_02: Microsoft.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_02: And there was a weekly war room meeting and a whole bunch of strategy and product
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_02: decision making that was driven around the impending threat from Microsoft.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_02: Because Microsoft was such a big behemoth so well capitalized, had incredible
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_02: engineering talent.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_02: Part of the response was to set up an office in Kirkland to recruit engineers up in Seattle
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_02: to aggressively grow that base.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_02: There was a whole bunch of tactics that emerged from the strategic lens of project
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_02: Canada.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_02: It is a very powerful method.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_02: It is how the United States got to the moon in a race with Russia.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_02: It is how we are now in a race for supremacy in technology and AI against China.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_02: Having an impending threat is a very strong motivational tactic.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_02: It is a very focusing setting that drives innovation.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_02: And so we'll see what happens.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_02: Chat GPT was basically the market monopoly in AI or LLM chat interface and it only had
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_02: one way to go, which was down.
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_02: Google, I think at this point has roughly 14%.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_02: So here you can see open a eyes on the decline.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_02: Obviously a little over a year ago they were at 90% plus market share in generative AI
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_02: traffic.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_02: And today Gemini is at 14, 15%.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_02: The depth, the flywheel that Google has built gives them such extraordinary advantage.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's go to Emperor Palpatine.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_03: This is coming together as exactly as you orchestrated you as the czar of AI and crypto.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_03: Thank you for your service, civil servant David Sacks.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_03: You wanted to see vibrant competition.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_03: Well, here we have it.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_03: Assess the playing field as you see it from DC.
[00:06:40] Well, first of all, let me give credit to Sam for calling this code red,
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_04: breaking the glass, employing the alarm.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_04: I think it's so easy for CEOs in general to engage in happy talk and ignore problems,
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_04: especially when discussing them is going to create a PR story that they don't like.
[00:07:01] And I do think one of the things that's unique about Silicon Valley is just that the founders
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_04: and CEOs do treat the situation their companies in a more existential way,
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_04: because we actually do have tremendous competition.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_04: And so anytime I think a CEO is willing to again, take a bad PR story in order to focus
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_04: their troops on a real business problem, I think they deserve credit for it.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_04: Because I think when you look at the rest of the Fortune 500, you know,
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_04: these CEOs are just kind of managing PR all the time.
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_04: Now with respect to the ecosystem as a whole, it is very competitive.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_04: And I think we've got five major companies and they all have their strengths.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_04: So chat GPT is the leader in consumer.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_04: They have something like 80% market share in consumer use of LLM chatbots.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_04: But then Google came out with their new Gemini 3 and they were starting to take share
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_04: based on the strength of Gemini 3 and the integration it has obviously within Google search.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_04: Because it's very easy for people to discover it when they do a Google search.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_04: And now they're seeing that it's actually pretty good.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_04: So they were starting to take share from chat GPT and I think that's why
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_04: Sam issued the code red.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_04: Then you've got in Thropic like you mentioned where I don't particularly
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_04: love what I've called the regulatory capture strategy, but I have to acknowledge
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_04: your products are very good.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_04: Everybody seems to say that they have the best coding assistant and they're carving out
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_04: a very lucrative niche in enterprise.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_04: And then you've got X AI, which I think is the best at current events because of the integration
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_04: with X and also Elon seems to be able to scale his data center, his training cluster,
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_04: the fastest.
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_04: He's got, you know, he had classes one.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_04: Now he's got classes two and that portends good things for GROC five.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_04: It's going to be trained on the largest cluster of Blackwells.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_04: So in any event, you've got all these companies that are doing pretty well.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_04: I guess Meta sort of hit some headwinds, but they're going to continue
[00:08:54] investing tremendously in AI and they've got deep pockets to do it.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_04: So I think that they'll come back.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_04: And you know, what you see is all these companies are kind of leapfrogging each other.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_04: You get a new version and then they sort of leapfrog each other in terms of benchmark.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_04: The leader boards are showing that yes, X, when you look at the leader board, it's constantly GROC
[00:09:12] comes above Gemini Gemini comes.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_03: There's a lot of leapfrogs going on.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_03: There's a lot of also, I'd say specialization not going on in the ways that I just mentioned.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_04: All these companies are developing strengths.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_04: There's sort of verticals happening.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_04: Yes.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_04: So I've described this as sort of a Goldilocks scenario where you're making a lot of progress in AI,
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_04: but the market is remaining very competitive.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_04: Ideally, it does not consolidate just to one monopoly player like we've seen in other
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_04: tech markets because then you end up with a big tech company that's got too much power and control.
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_04: That's not generally a great thing for consumers or for citizens.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_04: What does it say about us versus China?
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_04: What does it say versus us versus China?
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_03: That was the dialogue a year ago.
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_03: Oh my god, China, oh my god, China.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_03: Where are we at today?
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_03: Because this is impressive.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_03: This vibrant competition.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_03: Well, a competition brings out the best in the American system.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_04: And I think that that is what creates the most progress.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_04: And that's what's going to allow us to win the AI race against China.
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_04: China has a lot of competition too, but they do tend to annoy national champions more.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_04: I guess they usually do it more after a competition stage.
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_04: So maybe it doesn't prevent competition.
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_04: But look, China's formidable.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_04: They got a lot of good AI companies too and this is going to be a horse race.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_04: But again, there's no question in the American system.
[00:10:24] For sure, but look, there's no question that in the American system,
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_04: it's competition that brings out the best.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_04: And that's what we're seeing right now.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_04: Jason, what do you think?
[00:10:33] Interestingly, I just want to build a little bit on what freeberg showed.
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_03: The way I'm sort of seeing this is now chat GPT versus the world.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_03: 36 months ago, chat GPT Open AI had 100%.
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_03: They started the category as you pointed out correctly, David.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_03: And their decline in market share is increasing in velocity.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_03: If we were looking at just 12 months ago, they had 84% of the space.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_03: And now they're at 68.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_03: So they've, this is accelerating.
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_03: You pointed out, Jim off correctly, why it's accelerating.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_03: Distribution matters.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_03: We've talked about accountants times here.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_03: Meta is forcing you to use their AI search, which is pretty bad.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_03: I'll be honest.
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_03: Every time you do a search on Instagram, it's annoying.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_03: But those all count as users using the product,
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_03: just like slack face competition from Microsoft Teams when it bundled.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_03: And so I just tracked this out.
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_03: And this is what I think is going to happen over the next four years.
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_03: I think we're going to see Open AI go down to about a third of the market.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_03: And I think the other players are going to take two there.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_03: It's the reason I think this is because to SACSIS Point,
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_03: specialization is happening.
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_03: If you look at nano banana, which is the image processing over at Google,
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_03: it's fantastic.
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_03: GROCK images fantastic.
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_03: So you can have four different, five different choices for images.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_03: You can have four or five different really credible choices.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_03: Now you have to look also at the competition
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_03: and what Sam is facing.
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_03: I've known Sam 20 years now.
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_03: He is a consummate deal maker.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_03: Perhaps too good at deal making.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_03: He was incredible at recruiting.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_03: And his PR game was very strong.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_03: Everybody realizes that.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_03: And look at who he's facing, Preberg.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_03: Ilhan Khrug, Sir Vincent,
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_03: hard Google, Zuckerberg, Edmada, Dario, and the Thropic,
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_03: Satyat Microsoft, who is his partner, who's now his competitor.
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_03: Ilhan was his benefactor, now his competitor.
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_03: He got the open source projects, deep seek, etc.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_03: SACS in China.
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_03: And then his former employees are trying to kill him as well.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_03: So you have Ilia doing safe super intelligence,
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_03: which hasn't launched yet in Mira doing thinking machines.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_03: She's obviously was doing all the video stuff.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_03: So I think what we're going to see here, if we're sitting here,
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_03: I don't know, next year, they're going to be in the next 12 to 24 months,
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_03: under 50 percent.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_03: And these companies are explicitly trying to kill opening on.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_03: The amount of badwill that Sam has built is colossal.
[00:13:00] And I think it's from doing too many deals.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_03: And if you look at what he did to Invidia,
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_03: Invidia put out a statement recently
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_03: that they have the option to invest.
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_03: So we were sitting here two months ago,
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_03: and I know people in the industry were staying up late at night
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_03: worrying about all these deals Sam was doing.
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_03: All those deals apparently are coming out that they're options.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_03: These weren't real deals.
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_03: A lot of them were options.
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_03: And so Jensen came out and said,
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_03: Hey, we have the opportunity to invest in OpenAI.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_03: But you remember Sam did that AMD deal the week after he
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_03: or two weeks after he did the OpenAI deal.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_03: A lot of this is creating bad feelings.
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_03: And I think we're at peak OpenAI right now.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_03: I said it on the show a couple of weeks ago.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_03: I think the pair trade is to bet against every,
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_03: it's Chatchee PT versus the world.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_03: And I think the world wins two thirds.
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_03: They can still be in a good place.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_01: I think you're right that this market probably gets split up three or four ways.
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_01: And so the winner probably gets a third of the market.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_01: Most other markets that end up in a three or four person race ends up in that space.
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_01: But a third of a market can still be very valuable
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_01: if that market has five or six billion people using it.
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_01: Absolutely. It's going to be a tremendous.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_01: And I can still support a multi trillion dollar market cap.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_01: So I don't think it's by any means a death knell for OpenAI.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_01: But it does mean that a lot of these projects
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_01: probably need to get shuttered because you need to just do a few things very, very well.
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_01: Because consumers will start to split their purchasing decisions,
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_01: if you will, or their usage decisions across vertical things for specific purposes.
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_01: So yes, I may use GROC image because I love that.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_01: And it's just much better.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_01: But then I may use Anthropic for CodeGen while I use Gemini for deep research.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_01: And then I use Chatchee PT for conversational search.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_01: Now all of a sudden I'm using all four.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_01: That's highly realistic that outcome.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_01: In fact, I look at my phone now.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_01: I try to limit the number of apps on the phone.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_01: But I have Gemini and GROC as the two anchor apps.
[00:14:59] Because I'm so reliant on both of them.
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_01: And I just keep going back and forth between them now.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_01: Interestingly, I have four.
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_03: Have Claude also in perplexity on my desktop.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_03: And I go through all four of them.
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_03: Here's what Google and other folks are planning.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_03: They're going to take the main revenue stream of OpenAI.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_03: And they're going to suck the oxygen out of the room.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_03: And they're going to try to shrangle Sam and the team over there by making it free.
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_03: So right now, if 70% of them have revenue.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_03: 5% of them have four.
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_04: Very, very vital.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_04: But this is more, this is the greatest battle we've seen since like Netscape
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_03: versus Microsoft and the internet.
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_03: They're going to make Gemini free for life for the best models.
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_03: That's my prediction for Google.
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_03: And I think Meta will be right behind them.
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_03: Why?
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_03: They have the ad network already built.
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_03: And they know in that fierce competition,
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_03: which you were part of, Chimoff and Freeberg,
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_03: how fierce that competition was.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_03: That do opally does not want to become a throttle with Sam.
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_03: I think this is going to be very analogous
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_03: to what happened with Netscape.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_03: People used to pay 50 bucks for a Netscape browser.
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_03: And then the idea when Microsoft came in and made it free and Chrome became free
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_03: and Dolphin browser and a million other providers,
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_03: same thing's going to happen to chat GPT.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_03: Right now 80% of the revenue comes from $20 subscriptions.
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_03: That's going to get decimated to zero.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_03: I don't think consumers are going to pay for this product.
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_03: Just like they will pay for search and they will pay for a browser
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_03: because Google and Meta will make it free.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_03: I think it's different reason actually.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_01: The reason why they will do it is because they have such an inordinate amount of cash
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_01: and that cash is valuable is on the balance.
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_01: Big show.
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_01: So your model is just rip it in.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_01: If you look at the companies that have a need to spend money right now,
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_01: it's Google, it's Microsoft, it's Meta, it's Nvidia,
[00:16:41] and maybe Broadcom, but let's just keep Broadcom out of it.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_01: But Apple is there to Apple.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_01: All of those companies have so much cash.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_01: If you actually look at the DCF of the enterprise value of these businesses,
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_01: it gets very little credit for that cash almost to the point where it's worthless.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_01: You either need to spend it on M&A, spend it on buybacks,
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_01: or spend it to subsidize a product so that you can maintain your leadership in the broader market.
[00:17:07] What you're going to see is these big companies do this capital allocation model
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_01: in a much more aggressive way.
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_01: So there's only so many shared buybacks that these guys can do.
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_01: They approve 50, 60, 70, 80 billion dollars in buybacks.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: It just doesn't lift the stock price the same way it does when you actually show leadership
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_01: in a product category. So to your point, if you're just going to underwrite a decision,
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_01: just look at the last three weeks of Google's stock performance.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_01: It basically doubled once we thought that Gemini was incredible.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_01: And so if you want to make Gemini even more incredible,
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_01: just get more and other billion users into it.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_01: And if that costs you 50 billion, it's okay because you'll make a trillion of market gaps.
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_01: It's a second no-brainer.
[00:17:50] And think about all the reinforcement learning that those big players have at scale.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_03: I think it's going to be just by the way, the other thing is if we're playing conspiracy theorists,
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_01: I think the reason why Sam did those deals to your point is a consummate, very talented dealmaker.
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_01: It's probably because he needed to continue to generate the type of momentum required
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_01: to raise the quantum of capital that he needs.
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_01: So if you're a silent, it's much harder to raise $100 billion than you're
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_01: shucking and jiving and you're just putting a lot of things out there,
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_01: that could convince people that there's a level of momentum that's worth underwriting at a
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_01: much higher valuation. So you have to keep that in mind too.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_01: Yes, I think that is his high level, you know, 4D chess. I think Nvidia is predicting it now.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_03: I think Nvidia is not going to take their option to invest in OpenAI or they're going to really
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_03: downgraded 70, 80% and they're going to allocate it to other players.
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_03: Freeberg any final thoughts here is we wrap up on this.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_03: What is your base, what's their basis for that prediction?
[00:18:49] I think that Nvidia is wants to own more of the other players. I do actually have a basis
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_03: for this. I think that they were very pissed off at the other support he gave to their
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_03: competitors. How do you know the close end deal? I know a lot of people in the industry.
[00:19:05] You sound like the New York Times. Okay, well great segue.
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_03: Everybody knows what your source is. Everybody.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_03: Everybody reveal source to say open secret.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_04: I'll just, Jake, let me just wrap up on the A something.
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_02: I was trying to do that. I just echo a little bit what Tomas said. I don't think that the
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_02: battle is going to be won and lost on LLM's. I think that there's several fronts and we're so early
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_02: in AI, it's not going to necessarily just be about text-based token production.
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_02: These non-text-based models, the non-LLM models, the complexity to them and the differentiation
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_02: is so much wider than it is in LLM's. Kind of think about it. I think about it in terms of
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_02: like a hold-in versus Omaha game. The difference between the median and the best player in an Omaha
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_02: game is so significant compared to the median and the best player in a hold-in game because
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_02: it's just so much more complex. I don't know if you remember this guy, Chris Ferguson,
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_02: he used to win every Omaha tournament back in the day because he was one of the first guys to
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_02: figure it out. Everyone that knew hold-in thought that they could just step into Omaha and because
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_02: he figured out how to do Omaha, he just wrecked everyone consistently. Anyway, in video, for example,
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_02: they used diffusion models and then they also use a transformer architecture and then they use
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_02: these convolutional neural networks to create structure within the frame and continue structure
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_02: between frames and video. There are multiple models that have to interact and work together
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_02: to render video. So you have to have good training. You also have to have unique architecture.
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_02: And so the amount of differentiation that's possible in video AI is, I would say this point today,
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_02: so much wider than the differentiation and text-based AI like what we see with LLM's.
[00:20:48] As those things start to become more mainstream, I think that applications that we are not necessarily
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_02: thinking about today are going to become a bigger use case for how we spend our time. And that is
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_02: really when you'll start to see this horse race start to kind of play out a little bit more
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_02: differently than it does today. Where everything's all about usage on a chat interface,
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_02: we're going to look back at that one day. It's going to be the equivalent of everyone on AOL,
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_02: instant messenger or Yahoo instant messenger. It's like who gives a sh**? That's not really where the
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_02: game's going to be played. While we're speaking, Gemini just released Gemini 3 Deep Thing is here. So
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_03: the race is continuing even as we're taping the show. We're doing out of a more thing, which is,
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_04: I don't know, just a few months ago on the show. Maybe those three months ago, maybe those six
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_04: months ago, we were all giving eulogies for Google. I wasn't. I was not even. Well, I took the other
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_04: side. I mean, I don't know. There are a lot of people who were. I think the majority of the industry
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_04: was. I did take a little side of it. Yeah. I think Brad Gurley and sorry, Brad Gerlister and Bill
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_04: Gurley were. Brad Gurley. Brad Gurley. So, it's what Brad Gurley definitely were. Look,
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_04: in the argument made a lot of sense, which was this, which is even if you believe that Google's
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_04: going to come back and have a credible AI product. Remember, they were caught completely flatfooted
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_04: by this. They figured out the transfer market texture back in 2017, but then they didn't really
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_04: do anything with it and then open AI grabbed onto that and then like you showed on that chart,
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_04: they basically had a two year head start on LLMs. So a lot of people were basically saying that this
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_04: was it for Google because obviously LLMs are so much better at web search than the 10 blue links.
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_04: And moreover, for monetization, why would you need to have, you know, ad links or paid links
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_04: in an LLM world? And I think the point that Brad and Bill were making is again, even if Google
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_04: catches up, they'll never have the dominant position in AI that they have in search. It still might
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_04: be true. Who knows? But the point is just everyone was saying that Google was in deep trouble.
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_04: Just six months ago. And then like you said, I think Sergey came back and that gave them a major
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_04: shot in the arm and they got more focused. And now they've launched what appears to be the best or
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_04: one of the competitors. A competitive product. Look, these other companies, there's a lot of leapfrog
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_04: going on. I think really importantly, it's not just about Sergey coming back. It's about giving
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_02: themselves permission to take risks. The reason Google didn't lead into AI for years, even though
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_02: they had the technology sacks is because they were nervous about cannibalization to search. They
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_02: were nervous about the quality of the product. They didn't want to release things too early. And
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_02: then they changed their posture and they became a more risk taking posture. And that gave them the
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_02: permission to run, which by the way, I would argue is the opposite at OpenAI in the last couple
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_02: months. I used to use advanced voice on chat GPT all the time. I cannot stand it anymore. I do not
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_02: use it. It has basically hedged away all of the value because it tries to be polite. It tries to
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_02: make sure that it's giving you warnings all the time. It doesn't want to give you data because it's
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_02: scared that it might give you the wrong data. You can see it used to give you data all the time. I
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_02: cannot get it to give me numbers anymore. I'm like, give me the numbers. And it just says these kind
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_02: of high-level arching statements. And I'm like, that's not what I want. I went over to Gemini. It gave
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_02: me the numbers. And I think that Google's willing this to take risks as really kind of highlighted the
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_02: difference in posture in the last year. Chat GPT is now acting. And OpenAI has been acting like an
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_02: incumbent fearful of losing market share and fearful of getting attacked in the media and attacked
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_02: by consumers for saying the wrong thing. And so they've taken this kind of defensive posture that I
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_02: think has fundamentally damaged the product and the brand. I'm just having a great time thinking of that.
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_03: I'm thinking about Freiberg yelling at his AI assistant in his cars. We need to make a short out of that.
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_03: Well, just Google did one other important thing. I mean, in addition to Sergey, there was
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_04: putting Demis Hassabis in charge of all of AI. Because before, I think he was just in charge
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_04: of Google deep mind. It was sort of a subset. And then they put him in charge of the overall.
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_04: And I think that made a huge difference as well. Yeah. And the pie is growing. So the number of searches,
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_03: the number of queries is increasing dramatically. I think we'll have 20, 30 times the amount of queries
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_03: being done because the answers are better. It's not just queries. It's not just queries. This is my
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_02: point. It's like more than you're not using it to search anymore, right? You're using it to watch
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_02: video. You're using it to book flight. Yeah, the agentic stuff. I'm putting that all together. So
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_03: the amount of utility that you can get from it is so great that it's going to go 20x. The same
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_03: thing's happening with ride sharing. It's more than just search is the whole point. This has now
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_02: become such an instrumental part of everything we do in our lives. And it's going to take over more
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_02: of how we spend our time in our lives that it's not just about search anymore. It's a whole new
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_02: paradigm. The pie will be 20 times. We ask you a question. Do you think that OpenAI is sort of more
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_04: conservative risk posture? Do you think it's a function of the fact that whether by luck or design,
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_04: they decided that the consumer market was sort of their core market, whereas you look at something
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_04: like anthropic, right? And they've carved out enterprise. But if you're a consumer product,
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_04: there's so many more things you have to address. And you're going to be attacked at so many
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_04: different ways. And by being the market incumbent, it actually ended up creating a fantastic
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_02: foil for Google because they started getting all of the arrows and swings from the media about
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_02: health advice and suicides and hallucinations and sending wrong information and all the risks
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_02: and damage that that causes. Meanwhile, everyone's laughing and joking about Google and ignoring them.
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_02: It was more than that. Remember last summer, there was the court case where the judge said that
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_04: they were guilty of having them monopoly. And then he was going to rule on what the remedies
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_04: were going to be. And I think that was in was it September. And the judge said that during the
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_04: summer and then whenever it was that he ruled out the remedy, that they were accidentally threatened
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_04: in their search businesses so everything had changed. Yeah. I mean, so there's no, there's no,
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_04: broken up. Remember, there is no need about whether to spin out from YouTube. Yeah, all these
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_04: kind of right. In a way, no greater blessing has ever happened to alphabet and open AI's rise.
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_02: And I think that that rise not only did it create the foil for Google in the monopoly sense,
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_02: but it also took the attention away from Google focused on open AI and that attention fundamentally
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_02: damaged open AI strategic product capabilities because they had to start to be so much more careful
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_02: about what they said, how they said it. And it fundamentally damaged the product. And the
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_02: opposite was happening at Google at the same time, which is Larry Sergei and Sundar being given
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_02: permission by the board to take risk to go hard to figure this out and boom, you know, it's
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_02: amazing how the horse race has changed. Okay, we had an amazing time in Vegas. I want to thank our
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_03: friends at the Venetian. You guys were the best host we could have ever imagined what VIP treatment
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_03: you gave the besties and our friends and partners. And we had a great interview with Molly Bloom
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_03: from Molly's game movie, et cetera. Thanks to our partners Oracle, okay, X and the New York Stock Exchange
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_03: for partnering with us on a very successful F1 weekend in Vegas. And we had a great lunch with
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_03: Oracle congrats to them on Red Bulls big win in Vegas and an amazing dinner with okay X where
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_03: my new bestie Jose Andreas the chef came from bizarre meats and he cooked for us. He hung out
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_03: with us, he played a little cards with us. He's just a true gentleman and a bench. I'm going to
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_03: look for for it to hanging out with Jose Andreas a little more on the future. All right, there's
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_03: another thing that went on this weekend. Big tech story and at the risk of being a little
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_03: naval gazing here, we're going to cover it. The New York Times versus Mr. David Sacks on Sunday
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_03: the New York Times published an article titled Silicon Valley's Man in the White House is benefiting
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_03: himself and his friends. Sacks are obviously the man they're referring to. Five reporters worked on
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_03: this story for approximately five months is what we hear. And this story attempted to frame you
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_03: Sacks as completed first that your firm craft has investments in companies. New York Times key claim.
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_03: Quote, Mr. Sacks has positioned himself to personally benefit. He has 708 tech investments,
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_03: including at least 449 Sacks in companies with ties to artificial intelligence.
[00:28:57] And for background, Sacks, Elon, you all joined a special government employees, SGEs. These are
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_03: different than cabinet members in a bunch of different ways. Basically, they can't work more than
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_03: 130 days. They're allowed to split time between their day jobs in DC. They don't have to be approved
[00:29:13] by the Senate and they provide special expertise as Mr. Sacks is doing as the czar of crypto and AI.
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_03: Second major claim raising the profile of all in quote, Mr. Sacks has raised the profile of his
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_03: weekly podcast all in through his government role and expanded the business, which is super hilarious
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_03: because I think our traffic peaked right before the election. But Sacks, obviously you got a ton of
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_03: air cover. People thought the story was biased and a hit job and it fell pretty flat. What's your
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_03: take on this? Maybe take us behind. Take us behind the story. Well, I think maybe a good place to
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_04: start is with the reaction to it. Like you said, there was this huge outpouring of people in
[00:29:55] Silicon Valley who reacted in a way that showed that they understood that this story was a hit piece
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_04: that it was biased. And I'd say most importantly, it didn't even live up to its own headline. It didn't
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_04: prove the thing that they were asserting in the headline. And so everyone could just see on its face
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_04: that it was a hatchet job. And so everyone started reacting that way. And it was nice to kind of get
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_04: that outpouring of support from so many different people in Silicon Valley, including many of the
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_04: companies who we just talked about are so vigorously competing with each other. I mean, I think this might
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_04: be the only thing that Sam and Elon have agreed on in the last year. Yeah. Didn't you tell everyone to
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_02: put these tweets out? I mean, like, so that was sort of the next big lie that the media tried to
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_04: perpetrate was somehow that this response was coordinated by me. No, and the way was crazy because
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_03: you told me explicitly stand down. I don't need you to do it. And I was like, Lee Roy Jenkins. And
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_03: I just went in and I was like, I'm tweeting about this bullshit. No, I never told anyone to do
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_04: anything except for you guys. And I told you guys not to react to it because I didn't want to
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_04: strison the story, you know, where you basically draw even more attention to it. That was my media
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_04: plan. And then what happened is the story just went viral anyway because all this Silicon Valley
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_04: reacted on their own in a grassroots and authentic way because I think they were actually genuinely
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_04: offended by how bad this story was, how ridiculous it was on its face. And so they react and then
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_04: that became the story. And so this whole coordinated narrative became in a way part of the
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_04: the media industry's cover up for itself. Like, they're attempt to explain a way why everybody
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_04: thought that the story was so bad. Let me just say I do think that this outpouring of support
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_04: does illustrate something important, which is just how much power and respect the New York Times
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_04: you know, 10 years ago if the New York Times were going to hit peace on somebody even if other people
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_04: didn't like it, they wouldn't want to say anything because they'd be afraid that they would be the
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_04: next target. And that mystique and that fear has completely broken down. People kind of see the
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_04: New York Times for what it is, which is basically a bunch of political activists who are pretending to
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_04: be reporters. And essentially they just launder the point of view of their anonymous sources who
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_04: are basically left wing Democrats and try to portray those viewpoints as somehow being neutral
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_04: or objective truth, right? Because they're kind of presenting themselves as these neutral
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_04: arbiters of the truth. And I think everyone can kind of see through that sham at this point.
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_04: Yes. The thing they started with was the headline. Yeah. And that was the one thing they're
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_04: refused to change, no matter how many times we refuted their narrative. You know, what they would do
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_04: is every couple of weeks it sent us a new fact check. And we would basically debunk it. And we can
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_04: show you some of those fact checks if you want to see them to see where the story started, what they're
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_04: trying to prove. Yeah, let's do that. I think our next week really happened is every time we
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_04: would debunk one of their accusations, they would just come back to us with a new one in every
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_04: couple of weeks. The only fixed point in their reporting was this idea that I had to have these
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_04: conflict of interest that were benefiting myself. You were self-dealing. Yes. Let me ask you a question.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_04: So one of the statements that was made and then Governor Newsom repeated it at Andrew Ross
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_02: Orton's Dealbook conference yesterday is that you did not put all of your investments into a blind
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_02: trust. You should have done that is what Newsom said on stage. Can you just address that like
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_02: and what actions you actually took when you chose to take the office? What were you legally
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_02: required to take and maybe why you didn't do a blind trust or maybe you did I don't know.
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_02: Well, no, we looked at that. Sorry, Sacks, just give me a second. I just want to say this because
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_02: you're not going to say this yourself. But I remember when you were going through this,
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_02: you were so concerned about the perception of a conflict of interest that you took such
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_02: extraordinary measures about the degree at which you were selling things and getting rid of things
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_02: to make sure that you could do the job cleanly and wholly. I watched you do this. And I watched
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_02: you do something that I thought was so over the top. I'm like, Holy shit, you really are doing
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_02: this for the country. And I was so shocked and surprised by it. And I just want to say that
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_02: because I've observed it and they still came out with this piece which was so shocking to me given
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_02: what you did. So you guys know what I went through because I was LPs and some of your funds and you
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_04: know that I divested them. Yep. Which you could argue was above and beyond the call of duty. But I
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_04: was just trying to avoid any central conflict. And that I think is the central lie of this piece.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_04: Not only is the piece not true. It's the anti-truth. Yep. Because the truth is that I divested
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_04: hundreds of millions of dollars of positions in promising technology ventures at a substantial
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_04: cost to my net worth. So not only is this job not benefiting me. It's actually cost me a lot of
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_04: money to serve. But I did it because it's an honor to be asked by the president to serve. And it's
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_04: something I wanted to do. And I thought I can make a difference. So the whole premise here is just
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_04: false. And the newer times through it's five months of investigations knew this. But they
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_04: just refused to budge on the premise of their story. Now to your question here, if you look at
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_04: one of the key paragraphs that Jason you mentioned is when they try to mention that I have
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_04: 449 investments tied to AI. And they say their investigation uncovered this. And some of their
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_04: reporters on podcasts have tried to portray themselves as Woodward and Bernstein here having
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_04: how do they get this crazy list of companies I wonder. I disclose them. They didn't uncover them.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_04: I disclose them. They're in my ethics. They're available to everyone. They're on the White House
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_04: website in my ethics letter. So every government employee, whether you're a full-time or SG files,
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_04: disclosures with the government and my ethics letter is basically contained these pages and pages
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_04: of all these different positions. Now in that ethics letter, they said that I had divested. I had
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_04: initiated a completed divestment of over 99% of the positions that could pose a conflict for AI.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_04: And it's in there. And this is where I think, you know, again, they were very deceptive is
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_04: it was the OG, the officer government ethics, the career civil servants, the lawyers, the
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_04: accountants at OG, who approved that letter and all the conscience of that letter, who reviewed
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_04: all those disclosures. And there are the ones who concluded that I did not have any conflicts.
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_04: So really, what the New York Times's beef is with the career civil servants at OG.
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_04: Maybe walk us through what you actually did do. Why didn't you do the blind trust and
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_02: help us get the contact there? So on the blind trust. So it's kind of funny. One of the New York
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_04: Times reporters was talking about the Sona podcast, which is where I think Newsom picked it up from.
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_04: My ethics lawyer who teaches a course on conflicts of interest at Harvard said that that reporter should
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_04: really take his course because he would actually learn something about the the conflict's laws.
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_04: The blind trust idea is rarely used. And in my case, it would not have worked because I have minor
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_04: children. You can only use the blind trust to have your kids be beneficiaries if they're adults.
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_04: That's the way the conflict laws work. So it just wasn't even applicable in my case.
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_04: And what I did instead of creating a blind trust is I divested the positions that OG said were
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_04: a conflict at a discount to their fair market value in the case of my LP interests in all these
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_04: funds. I divested almost 100 funds that I had invested in venture funds, things like that,
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_04: angel funds at roughly a 50% discount to their fair market value because.
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_04: That's insane. Because while they're private investments, right? And you know that selling an LP
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_04: interest in a fund, there's no liquid market for that. So in order to even find a buyer,
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_04: you have to make it super attractive for them. God. And then I sold, you know, XAI, I sold my
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_04: interest in in GROC. And those were all at substantial discounts to the next round, which has now
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_04: taken place. So during the government's not a money making scheme, the simplest way for me to make
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_04: more money would have just been to keep doing what I was doing. Yeah. Right. Just go back to the
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_04: 449. So again, they're kind of pretending like they did this unbelievable investigation. And they
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_04: find the 449. Can you just put up this paragraph on the screen here? Because really every sentence
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_04: in this paragraph kind of reveals the sham of this story. Mr. Sachs's position himself to
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_04: personally benefit, not true. I mean, I was already an investor in all these companies,
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_04: and I position myself to divest. Then it says I had 449 states and companies with ties to artificial
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_04: intelligence. By the way, that whole phrase ties to is total journalism, weasel words,
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_04: because ties to can mean anything. And every company in the economy is going to have ties to
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_04: artificial intelligence. And then they said, could be aided directly or indirectly. That is not
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_04: what a conflict of interest is. The standard is having a direct and predictable effect on an
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_04: interest, not indirect. And there's nothing in that story that shows that I had a direct benefit.
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_04: This article has nothing to do with everything you guys just spent all this time talking about.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_01: Okay. There is nothing here. Okay. There was no crime here. There's no smoke here. There's no
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_01: fire here. What you did get right though is the headline was the goal. And what is the goal of that
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_01: headline? The goal of that headline is to insinuate and to pressure Sachs. But suddenly it's to pressure
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_01: everyone else that looks like Sachs. Now what does it mean to look like Sachs? It's not just about
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_01: Republican folks. This could be a democratic person as well in the future. You're in industry.
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_01: You know something very specific. You've done very well applying that knowledge. Now all of a sudden
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: you're in a position where you could go and positively impact the trajectory of the United States.
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_01: You're asked by the then sitting president of the United States to do something. What this article
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_01: does is it tries to intimidate those kinds of people to say, wow, this is not worth it. This is
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_01: just too much of a headache. The whole point was the headline. And the whole point was to get
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_01: enough chatter about the headlines so that people like Sachs and then other people in the future
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_01: just say, you know what? Not worth it. I'm not going to try this. And what do they want instead?
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_01: What they want instead are people that they can work with very closely and ultimately co-op.
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_01: If you look at people like Zora and Mamdani who's beloved by the New York Times or if you look
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_01: at Lena Khan who's beloved by the New York Times as well, what's the through line? It's a total and
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_01: complete lack of experience. And so what you're creating is essentially a very simple litmus test.
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_01: If you have experience, we're going to paint you as conflicted. So stay away. But if you're
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_01: completely inexperienced, I have no experience whatsoever, I've never done anything. And you're
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_01: probably going to screw it up. But at least you'll be in our pocket for work with you. And so we
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_01: will leave you alone. That is the point of this article. And that is what is on trial here.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_01: And I think what we all need to do is understand that simple thing and push back on it. Not just if
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_01: you're a Republican, but also if you're a Democrat because there are tons of really smart people on
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_01: both sides that will eventually be asked to do something for the United States. And you need to
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_01: ignore the idiots at the New York Times and do it. Yeah, this is well said and this literally
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_03: was going to be the point I was going to make as well, which is we're setting up two worlds. Do you
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_03: want to have access first? Exactly. You'll only have inexperienced morons in the government.
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_01: Even governments. How does that help? It doesn't. And here's it's such a good point,
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_03: Shema. We have a choice right now. Do we want to have lawyers and academics with no experience in
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_03: the real world? Setting policy in Washington, DC, or do you want to have experts? Do you want more
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_03: Mike Bloomberg? Do you want more Jeff Bezos more David Sacks more best than also a Democrat? Let Nick
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_03: also previously a Democrat. We want the smartest people in Washington, DC. That's what the founders
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_03: wanted. The founding fathers of this country wanted people to do short stints. We want short stints.
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_03: We don't want career politicians like Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell in there for 30, 40
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_03: 600 years. Literally these people are like look like zombies in Washington. They're glitching out.
[00:42:05] SPEAKER_03: We want people in their prime of their careers to go in their Chimoff like you're saying and
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_03: kick ass for us for four or eight years and then come back. By the way, everybody benefits when
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_03: you go to Washington, DC, and you make some connections. Of course, when the Clintons left office,
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_03: what did they do? Clinton Foundation, book deals, Obama's, book deals, Netflix deals,
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_03: everybody gets a little shine when they come out. That's natural when you come out.
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_03: But we want the best and brightest there. It's a gift that you went there, Sacks. It's a gift.
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_03: I mean, yeah, we can debate all these issues and yes, civil servants should be under scrutiny,
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_03: whether it's Lina Khan or Usacks, people should be held to account for anything they're doing.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_03: You did it right. You went above and beyond and now they're trying to punish you and they're trying
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_03: to dissuade the next group of great Americans from going there. Yeah, well, thank you. Yeah,
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_04: good. There are two quotes from Thomas Jefferson. I'll just read because I think it's actually very important.
[00:42:58] He said in a letter in 1788, I apprehend that the total abandonment of the principal of rotation
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_02: in the elected offices will end in abuse. And then he also later said in 1809, nature intended me
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_02: for the tranquil pursuits of science, which is what he was into by rendering them my supreme delight.
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_02: But the enormities of the times in which I have lived have forced me to take apart in resisting them
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_02: and to commit myself on the boisterous ocean of political passions.
[00:43:31] The founding fathers to your point, J. Cal and Jamath were vehemently committed to the United
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_02: States being a free market, being a place where people could pursue with absolute liberty.
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_02: Their interests in business, in science, in life. And the action of political office,
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_02: of getting elected to a political office, was out of a requirement to serve, out of civil
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_02: service, service to this country, service to the nation and service to the enablement of the
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_02: freedoms that allow us to do the things that we choose and want to do. And if you look at the wealth
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_02: that's been accumulated by these career politicians, it is no surprise that they are attacking sacks
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_02: and besieged and letnith and Kelly Loeffler and all of these other elected or appointed officials
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_02: in this government who have had success in private life and who have chosen out of a commitment
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_02: to patriotism to spend their time rather than making money in private life. They have enough money
[00:44:34] but to try and get the government and the country on the track that they hope it will go on.
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_02: And I think that that is the key difference between those who see this article for what it is
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_02: and those who read it to reaffirm their, I would say, violent opposition to what is this current
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_02: administration and the challenge that's ahead. So I think it's a real Rorschach test
[00:44:58] when you read these articles and you look at sacks and others in this administration and the
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_02: choices that they've made to say, are they doing it to grift or they're doing it because they don't
[00:45:08] SPEAKER_02: need to grift. Let me just also say this, proof is in the put. If we send experts to Washington,
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_03: DC, if you look at sacks's early track record, you got the stablecoin stuff done, we were just
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_03: talked about how competitive the AI market is, we talked about building more energy, this, you know,
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_03: and again, I disagree with a lot of the things in the Trump administration. The thing I don't
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_03: disagree with and I fully endorse is the experts and the great job they're doing. How are
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_03: Latinx crushing it? You're crushing it. All these regulations that you've gotten done early and
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_03: often are making crypto legal, a legal framework for crypto, which probably the last two administrations,
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_03: the 45 from the 46 didn't get done. You got it done in six months, right? There's already a
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_03: track record here. If you send experts, they'll get expert sh** done on time, on startup speed.
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_03: So like, let's talk about the results as well. Yeah, I mean, look, they don't want the results.
[00:46:02] SPEAKER_04: I mean, they consider the results to be a negative. And what they're trying to do is criminalize
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_04: policy disagreements. That's really what's going on. Now, at one point, my comms person who is
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_04: dealing with the New York Times asked them, you know, what friends are you talking about? Like,
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_04: what friends did he benefit? And they couldn't name a specific one. I think this is why you guys,
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_04: why they mentioned all in tequila and they all in summit. I think maybe they're trying to portray
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_04: you guys as the friends who benefited. Let me just say one thing on all end. We can't get speakers
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_02: to come on the show because of the association with the Trump administration. We lost money on that
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_02: f**k event in June that I spent 12 days of my life working on. It was a pain in my f**k ass.
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_02: There was no personal benefit for any of the sh**. There's no grifting going on. It's honestly
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_02: a pain in the ass. We do it for sacks because he wanted us to help him out with putting that event on.
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_02: And we lost sacks. Now you're part time on the show. We lost sacks. And now, yeah, from the
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_04: gecko, it was a nonprofit event. We did not sell tickets. We gave them all the way for free.
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_04: If we wanted to make money, you sell tickets. We didn't do that. We had two sponsors that put
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_02: money in to help defray the cost because we spent like a million plus dollars on this f**king thing.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_02: They got their logo on the video, not even in the live event. It was just on the video when we
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_02: put it on YouTube, which was our way of it. Let's move on. Let's go to the New York Times.
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_03: But there's no benefit to all in. There's no benefit to all in. And the fact that they had to throw
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_04: that in. It's a f**k show if you ask me, but I could go. It's because they kitchen sink this thing
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_04: to try and create the illusion that there was something there. So we knew this would take over
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_03: the show because we're all hot under the collar and we all know you're doing a great job there.
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_03: We want more experts. The job description is to have us win AI. Yes. That's what they're
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_04: accusing me of is basically doing my job. Congratulations. You did a great job. And now we're going to
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_03: lie about you in the New York Times. But your friends with Jensen Huyen and now Jensen can sell chips.
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh. Do you want to show the fact check? It's crazy. It's crazy. This guy is the CEO of the
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_00: largest company in the world. He's been designing for years. He's been meticulously designing these chips
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_00: for 30 years for gamers. Before Saks could even spell each 100. He made them for gamers. He was making
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_01: video game car access. A few years ago. Okay, wait, we got I got to show this example of how to
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_04: say or so they would send us these fact checks every couple of weeks. Okay. Okay. So here's the
[00:48:15] SPEAKER_03: real email Saks. They were sending you bullet points after bullet points. This section starts at
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_03: bullet point number 33. It's obviously one of many emails you got. What they do in these fact checks
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_04: is they basically take the story that they're planning to write and just break it up into chunks.
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_04: And then they give you like 24 hours to respond to each sentence or paragraph and say whether
[00:48:35] SPEAKER_04: you agree or disagree with it and give you the chance to make a statement. That's what a fact
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_04: check is. So this is the story they were planning on writing, which is in the spring, Saks had
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_04: dinner with Nvidia CEO, Jensen Wong in Washington. They discussed several foreign export issues.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_04: During the dinner, Saks heard a convincing counter argument that selling American chips
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_04: to rivals, including China, but get those nations hooked on US tech. Saks then took that argument
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_04: to the White House and pushed officials to eliminate by an error restrictions, etc, etc.
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_04: This is one problem with this narrative. There was no such dinner. We checked my schedule. They
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_04: made up the dinner. No, we checked everyone's schedules. There is no dinner. So they've got a source
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_04: who's just making this up. And how does the New York Times respond? They just delete the dinner,
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_04: but they don't delete any other part of this. But if your source has already been caught fabricating
[00:49:24] SPEAKER_04: a dinner at which this conversation supposedly took place, it's totally discredited. They're trying
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_04: to intimidate you. They kind of create this insinuation that somehow I'm being influenced through
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_04: friendships. But then it turns out that those friendships don't even exist. I mean, they're just
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_04: people I met after I joined the administration a lot of cases. So in any event, look, I think the
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_04: audience of the show knows my views on AAPs. They've been publicly advocating for them for
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_04: past year. And you've had scrutiny. We ask you hard questions every week here. We bust your
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_03: chops and force you to explain these positions. And we stress test them with you and the one
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_03: interest test. So that's like a gift to the American people. And I think it's very hard for people
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_02: to contemplate the idea that folks who are significantly wealthy don't actually need to self-deal.
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_02: Like they just don't need it. And the truth is the folks who are trying to build a career
[00:50:21] SPEAKER_02: in politics are the ones who are necessarily going to self-deal because that's the path to wealth
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_02: for them. And if you've already found your path to wealth, you don't need to self-deal. And I
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_02: think it's just so hard for people to grok that. It's hard to understand that somebody is losing a
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_03: massive amount of money serving their country. I for one, thank you for losing all of his money
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_03: in going and serving the country. And for even if people don't do your politics, even if I don't
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_03: agree with everything you say or do sex, again, I never doubt your integrity and your intentions.
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_02: And I never once thought that you would be someone who would ever self-deal or engage in any sort
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_02: of grift or corruption. And I'll say that just personally having known you for a very long time.
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_02: Great. So I appreciate that. Thank you. I'm mad at you because you didn't sell me everything at
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_01: 50% discount. Yeah. I was going to get fired. I've been to state so angry this whole clip thinking,
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_00: what? Where was my call? Oh my God. I would have given you 55%. Give it to me. I would have bought
[00:51:24] another story that's been trending is the new poverty line and some of these incoming tax
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_03: laws. Mike Green and investor and fund manager when fire less week for claiming the US poverty line
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_03: math is very wrong. Historically, the poverty line has been measured as three times the cost of
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_03: a minimum food diet in 1963 adjusted for a relation based on that measures. The poverty line for
[00:51:47] SPEAKER_03: a family for is set at $31,000 in 2025. Green says the real number is over four X higher at
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_03: $104,000. He gets that number by factoring the cost of childcare, which has surpassed housing
[00:52:00] SPEAKER_03: as the largest average expense. He says measuring this number for decades has quietly broken
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_03: America and it could explain why America's middle class feels poor despite healthy GDP and
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_03: historically low unemployment, four point X, which we've talked about here.
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_03: Jamak, your thoughts. I read this. I found his claim to be pretty shocking. So I just
[00:52:20] SPEAKER_01: I wanted to dig into it. That's why I asked that we talked about it. Nick, you can probably link to
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_01: it. But yeah, this thing went viral and basically it's exactly what you said Jason. Food costs
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_01: used to be a third of living costs. And so food used to cost 10,000. You would multiply it by
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_01: three and say, well, the total cost of living is 33,000. That's the poverty line. And then what
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: the government did was they created a whole bunch of staircase incentives to get people from
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_01: about 33,000 to about two X set number to about 65,000. And then after that, you were mostly on
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_01: your own where there were no real benefits like snap or other things. But what this person was
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_01: saying is like, hey, hold on a second. Food costs are now five or six percent. And so if you
[00:53:05] SPEAKER_01: gross it up for the other components, shouldn't the poverty line be something closer to 140K?
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_01: And that's a shocking claim. And so I just spent a little bit of time looking into it. Now
[00:53:17] SPEAKER_01: he is subsequently come back and refine some of the things he said. I think he may have
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_01: written it in a heated moment. So for example, when he looked at that number, he wasn't looking at
[00:53:29] SPEAKER_01: national averages. He was looking at a bunch of data from a high cost suburb of New York City.
[00:53:34] SPEAKER_01: I think it was like Essex County. And so if you look at the food costs plus transportation plus
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_01: energy plus housing plus childcare in other places that are more
[00:53:46] a median American city, the example that I think other people were using was Lynchburg, Virginia,
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_01: just as an example. It does change pretty drastically. You can use this thing called the MIT
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_01: Living Wage Calculator, which we did. And if you are in Lynchburg, Virginia, the income required for
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_01: a family of four to meet all expenses there is not 140K, but it's about 93K. That's still quite
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_01: a big difference. And when you double click into where these variances come, a lot of it looks
[00:54:12] SPEAKER_01: like it's around housing and childcare. And I didn't depreciate how much and how expensive
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_01: childcare has actually become from anywhere between one to three thousand dollars per month,
[00:54:24] SPEAKER_01: which is obviously a lot of money. The other thing is that his original article was claiming that
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_01: if you're above 33K, but under 65K, you're actually better off staying at 33. Because every time
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_01: you go up, you actually lose a benefit. So the net effect is that you are becoming poor. And it
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_01: turns out that that map was actually false. When you calculate the net resources, meaning income plus
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_01: benefits minus taxes and expenses, a family actually, as they step up the staircase, does earn more
[00:54:57] SPEAKER_01: indisposable resources than a family that's earning less. There is a very specific part of though
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_01: what he said, which I think we should focus on, which is there is an area between 45K a year and
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_01: 63K a year, which actually looks like a bit of a stagnation zone. So through the extent that
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_01: one is to read this article, take away the kind of the buzzy title and whatnot. The thing that is
[00:55:27] important is to narrowly focus on this one issue, which is that we do have some policy failures
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_01: in this zone where earning an extra dollar often results in losing a dollar of benefits like snap
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_01: and other things. But that's a good thing to know because now we can narrowly say, okay, what are
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_01: states and what can the federal government do for people in just this part of the valley, this
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_01: sort of like death valley? The last thing is the article was saying, look, there is no real middle
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_01: class. There are the people that are above 140K and then there's everybody else in poverty. And
[00:56:02] SPEAKER_01: if you look at the census data and you look at the percentage of Americans that are struggling,
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_01: those that earn between 100 and 200% of poverty, that percentage is actually fallen. So the good
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_01: news is the American economy seems to be doing a good job of not just getting people out of poverty,
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_01: but getting people out of that struggling bracket, out of that death valley and into a place where
[00:56:26] SPEAKER_01: they're making 200% of that poverty line. So they're moving up. So the article is important because
[00:56:32] SPEAKER_01: I do think it starts to say, look, this affordability thing has become a buzzword. A lot of people on
[00:56:38] SPEAKER_01: the left and the right are using it to try to implement and affect policy. It's really important for
[00:56:45] SPEAKER_01: us to be grounded in the facts of it. And the facts are that childcare costs have become an
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_01: overwhelming burden for many families. We probably need to figure out a way to deal with that.
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_01: Housing costs are out of control. For younger people, student debt is problematic. But on the other
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_01: side, the American economy still does an incredible job of getting people from those lower rungs to
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_01: multiple 100% of that poverty line to get them on the way. And we just need to figure out how to
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_01: push people up that staircase faster. So I'm like, this dovetails, Chema, with a discussion we had
[00:57:20] SPEAKER_03: a couple of weeks ago when a viral clip of Ben Shapiro talking about, hey, just opt out of New
[00:57:24] SPEAKER_03: York City, opt out of San Francisco. And this holding looks completely different. The idea of
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_03: somebody who is up and coming, living in Manhattan or San Francisco is a bit crazy. And in other
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_03: countries, we don't look at living in Paris or Hong Kong or Dubai as like, that's where you start
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_03: your career and you live in the city center, yeah, freeberg. You're saying people
[00:57:49] SPEAKER_02: like would move. I'm not sorry. The point I'm making is to define a poverty line for in San
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_03: Francisco versus Austin or Houston is incredibly different because the cost of living is dramatically
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_03: different. Two, three, four, X, you know, the cost of a nanny in San Francisco or New York is
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_03: dramatically different than if you live 30 outside of a city center. One of the challenges
[00:58:15] SPEAKER_02: America faces is government programs create an anchor. They are a shackle. They hold people back
[00:58:23] SPEAKER_02: when they're supposed to be support payments. And the problem with this, that this article highlights
[00:58:28] SPEAKER_02: is that the supposed support payments actually create an incentive or a challenge in moving up
[00:58:35] SPEAKER_02: the wrong or up the ladder. It's probably the case that it is a lot easier to move up the income
[00:58:43] SPEAKER_02: if you're in certain parts of the country than if you're most of the country. And so most of the
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_02: country is stagnating wages, but they still feel the effects of inflation and these government
[00:58:54] SPEAKER_02: programs keep them stuck in the position that they're in. This is the spiral of socialism.
[00:59:03] The government programs that are meant to provide support to people require an increase in taxation
[00:59:10] SPEAKER_02: that revenue has to come from somewhere. That taxation ultimately leads to an attrition
[00:59:16] SPEAKER_02: of economic value in that region. And then you have to increase taxation more and then you end
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_02: up in the spiral. And we're seeing this now not just in New York where Mamdani's proposing to
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_02: increase taxes, but across the entire West Coast, we talked about the 5% billionaire tax
[00:59:34] that's being proposed as a constitutional amendment to go on the ballot in November.
[00:59:38] SPEAKER_02: There's also a major challenge underway in Oregon where the governor is now trying to
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_02: figure out how to keep businesses in the state. The CEO of Columbia Sportswear, one of the
[00:59:46] SPEAKER_02: biggest employers in the state came out this week saying that his advisors have recommended
[00:59:51] SPEAKER_02: that he leave the state. And in Washington, there is a proposed bill right now to implement
[00:59:58] SPEAKER_02: 5% tax on the payroll of employees making over $125,000 per year.
[01:00:05] SPEAKER_02: And Microsoft, Amazon, Costco, and some of the other big employers in that state are now trying
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_02: to figure out what they should do. And in California, as you guys know, in the last couple of
[01:00:15] SPEAKER_02: quarters, Tesla, Chevron, McKesson, Oracle, Charles Schwab, CB Richard Ellis, Hewlett Packard,
[01:00:22] SPEAKER_02: have all left the state, Palantir, SpaceX, I could go down this list because as the tax burden
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_02: becomes too high on those companies and there's an alternative to them in the country, they'll leave.
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_02: And then you have this spiral that happens where the people that are in that state say,
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_02: wait a second, there's no jobs, there's no income gain, we need to increase taxation and the
[01:00:41] SPEAKER_02: tax bills get passed. Norway, 2022 passed a wealth tax. The wealth tax was supposed to raise $146
[01:00:48] SPEAKER_02: million of incremental revenue per year. Instead, what happened? $54 billion of net worth left the
[01:00:54] SPEAKER_02: country and they actually had a $448 million tax loss. The taxes declined rather than, did they
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_02: reverse it afterwards or no? I'm actually not sure at the state of Norway. Microsoft's President
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_02: Brad Smith has said that tech jobs are going to leave Washington state of this payroll tax gets
[01:01:10] SPEAKER_02: passed. And this is the cycle that's underway. And it starts with the government spending. If we
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_02: didn't have the government spending the way it does where the government's running a deficit,
[01:01:18] SPEAKER_02: California is now expected to have a $50 billion plus dollar deficit, then they don't need to increase
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_02: taxes. And this is the core motivation. Once you're hooked on the government for some sort of
[01:01:27] SPEAKER_02: benefit, it's very hard to unhook yourself. It's very hard for a company or a union or an organization
[01:01:33] SPEAKER_02: to unhook themselves. And it definitionally becomes a spiral. You will not give up that benefit.
[01:01:38] SPEAKER_02: And so you have to spend incrementally more and more and more and more. And as you raise taxes,
[01:01:45] SPEAKER_02: you end up losing the tax base. And it becomes a deficit spiral. That's what leads to socialism.
[01:01:50] SPEAKER_02: And we have seen a time and again, it's not a big revolution. It's not like we see where you go
[01:01:55] SPEAKER_02: from socialism to democratic capitalism, where you have a revolution in the streets. Socialism
[01:02:02] SPEAKER_02: emerges slowly. It's like a quiet sort of hum and then it becomes a roar and all of a sudden
[01:02:07] SPEAKER_02: you're a frog in a pot and you don't realize you're being boiled. Pull this up, this clip from
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_02: this is episode seven of all in. I don't think democracies end with a bang. I think they end
[01:02:19] SPEAKER_02: with a whimper. And I think that's been the case historically. And no democracy has lasted.
[01:02:27] SPEAKER_02: Our democracy in the US has lasted longer than many. Democracy is ultimately
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_02: enable freedom of operation and free markets that result in greater progress than any other
[01:02:39] SPEAKER_02: governing system. The problem with progress is that progress is asymmetric. You have some people
[01:02:45] SPEAKER_02: who progress at a much greater rate than most. And it is that delta that motivates the end of
[01:02:51] SPEAKER_02: that system ultimately. While everyone in the United States or the average and even the bottom
[01:02:55] SPEAKER_02: quartile of the population in the US is better off than they were 50 years ago in terms of income
[01:03:00] SPEAKER_02: and healthcare and shelter and access to food and access to all these things, the top 1% of the US
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_02: is further ahead than the median. And it is that delta that motivates the end of democracy. And it
[01:03:09] SPEAKER_02: is that is which has been perceived to be unfair about this governing system. And that ultimately
[01:03:14] SPEAKER_02: results in fascism or socialism. And then fascism results, socialism ultimately restricts anyone
[01:03:19] SPEAKER_02: for progression. And that's why fascism and socialism ultimately end up in some sort of
[01:03:25] you know, democratic outcome. And it is a cycle. And you know, we're kind of in this, you know,
[01:03:29] SPEAKER_02: awkward phase of trying to figure out what the hell we're going to be next. And I don't think
[01:03:33] SPEAKER_02: that awkward phase is realized in the next presidential term, but it is going to be realized in our
[01:03:37] SPEAKER_02: lifetime. And I think that's where we're headed midterms probably going to go to the Democrats in
[01:03:41] SPEAKER_02: the House. And I think you're seeing Rokana Gavin Newsom yesterday on stage at Dealbook
[01:03:46] SPEAKER_02: talked about redistributing wealth. Rokana is talking about redistributing wealth. This is
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_02: becoming the Democrat party line. And they're going to end up trying to seize this moment
[01:03:54] SPEAKER_02: to take these socialist principles because everyone is feeling the burn. They're feeling the loss
[01:03:58] SPEAKER_02: of benefits. They're feeling the lack of progress. They're having a tough time moving up the
[01:04:03] SPEAKER_02: income ladder. And they're having a tough time paying their bills. And so this is the moment where
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_02: this democratic socialist movement takes foot. And probably by 2028, the presidential nominee is
[01:04:14] SPEAKER_02: going to be not necessarily a self declared, but probably a referensible, you know, socialist.
[01:04:20] SPEAKER_02: Democrat socialists. Democrat socialists. I mean, best advice. Have two plans. One, a state
[01:04:28] SPEAKER_03: that is committed to capitalism. Texas comes to mind. And number two, you kind of have to have
[01:04:33] SPEAKER_03: a country as a pack of plan in case this goes across the whole country. Have you guys been
[01:04:37] SPEAKER_03: tracking the California wealth tax as a former California resident? I'm curious how you're
[01:04:43] SPEAKER_03: interpreting these recent moves. I think we're all seriously thinking about moving out. I mean,
[01:04:49] SPEAKER_04: it's kind of crazy. But did you see, I think Newsom came out and said that he was going to oppose
[01:04:53] SPEAKER_04: it? Is that right? But it doesn't matter because if the California voters voted in, it goes
[01:04:59] SPEAKER_01: immediately into an amendment. Let's not look at gift tors in the mouth here. I think this is a
[01:05:03] SPEAKER_04: moment to thank Governor Newsom for representing the interests of Tecola Garx like us. We really appreciate
[01:05:10] SPEAKER_04: you coming out against this wealth tax. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_04: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We appreciate it. Let's laugh of all the Tecola Garx. Thank you
[01:05:19] SPEAKER_04: for opposing this wealth tax. In fact, the all-in podcast endorses Gavin Newsom's support of billionaires
[01:05:26] SPEAKER_03: and sent to millionaires everywhere. He supports all of us equally, even for poor sent to millionaires
[01:05:34] SPEAKER_03: and as high as the billionaires and even the Deca billionaires. Thank you for standing up against
[01:05:39] SPEAKER_04: the Bernie Sanders AOC wing at the party. Yes. Somebody has to stand up against this democratic
[01:05:45] SPEAKER_03: socialism and Gavin Newsom is the guy. What do you think happens if they just tax 5% of all
[01:05:51] SPEAKER_01: net worth and you have a bunch of illiquid private assets? What are you supposed to do?
[01:05:57] SPEAKER_01: Cash. Yeah, it's going to be a mess. By the way, what that Bill Tumoff says is you can have a
[01:06:02] SPEAKER_02: deferral. So you can actually defer the tax payment but you have to have it booked that year.
[01:06:09] SPEAKER_02: So you can defer it but you can defer it into one fifth payable for a year for five years. So
[01:06:16] SPEAKER_01: that's not really a deferral. That's just installment. I think they said to 5% to 7% interest.
[01:06:21] SPEAKER_01: Let's just say that we could do a financing for something that we've started.
[01:06:26] But it just all of a sudden, what is a financing? It's nothing. It's somebody's guess about
[01:06:30] SPEAKER_01: future value. It has nothing to do with today's value. But if a financing for a company,
[01:06:37] SPEAKER_01: all of a sudden would trigger a bunch of phantom tax. That's due. That's right. I mean, I'll be
[01:06:43] SPEAKER_01: honest. I don't have money sitting around to be 5% of an imputed valuation of a company that I'm
[01:06:48] SPEAKER_01: in the midst of building. Look at what Zach just talked about. He had to sell his private assets at
[01:06:52] SPEAKER_02: a 50% discount. Oh, I would have to say. So you create this negative, reflexive downward spiral.
[01:07:00] SPEAKER_01: And it doesn't stop there. So think about where this goes. So yes, that's a problem for rich people.
[01:07:04] SPEAKER_02: Great. No one gives a shit about us. No one gives a shit about people that have to sell
[01:07:08] SPEAKER_02: highly valued private stock. But where does this go? In the proposed billionaire tax, it actually
[01:07:14] SPEAKER_02: gives power and authority to the California State Legislature that they can actually redo this
[01:07:19] SPEAKER_02: wealth tax at a different level and a different rate in the future. Think about what that does.
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_02: It now gives property seizure rights to the California State Legislature to set a value level.
[01:07:31] SPEAKER_02: So anyone now that's got over 100 million net worth and then it becomes over 10 million and then
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_02: anyone with a million dollar net worth and the state can take 5% of your assets every year.
[01:07:41] Very quickly, it becomes the process by which socialism and the socialization of assets
[01:07:47] SPEAKER_02: that get seized by the government is realized. So what's the what's the bull work on this?
[01:07:52] SPEAKER_02: What do I have? This is why I've been saying for years. This is the direction we're headed because
[01:07:55] SPEAKER_02: the government, I give you the victory. Congrats. But the root cause of it is government spending.
[01:08:00] SPEAKER_03: I think it's pretty straightforward. You just move to a state that is committed to capitalism.
[01:08:05] SPEAKER_03: Capitalism. And but then it becomes a federalization. And then if that doesn't work,
[01:08:10] SPEAKER_03: you're going to need to have an escape hatch to Dubai. We have a problem in this country.
[01:08:14] SPEAKER_03: And the problem is too much progress. Too much progress too fast has led to a distribution of
[01:08:20] SPEAKER_02: capital that is so asymmetric that Gavin Newsom said on stage yesterday 10% of the population
[01:08:27] SPEAKER_02: own two thirds of the assets that may or may not seem right to you. But that is the reality of what
[01:08:31] SPEAKER_02: happens when you have progress. When you build technology companies. When you build car companies.
[01:08:36] SPEAKER_02: Or when you build AI. When America wins globally. You say America, but it's not all Americans.
[01:08:42] SPEAKER_02: And this is the point. This is what's going on. Yeah. Those of us who are on this zoom and our cohort
[01:08:47] SPEAKER_02: of friends are the ones who have mostly benefited from America quote winning. The rest of America has
[01:08:55] SPEAKER_02: been left behind. True. And the mechanism and the mechanism for recapture, the mechanism for restoration
[01:09:01] SPEAKER_02: of equality as everyone views it is these measures, these voting measures. Let me let you do the
[01:09:07] SPEAKER_02: care. Let me give it to I understand that's how people feel. And it is true that we have this
[01:09:12] SPEAKER_03: disparity. Well, I think the counter argument that most people would make is, well, what is our
[01:09:18] SPEAKER_03: unemployment rate? How many people around the world are trying to get into this country? And what
[01:09:23] SPEAKER_03: is the status of folks coming up in this country? If we didn't have the problem with housing
[01:09:29] SPEAKER_03: and education and health care, those are the big three. That's what I think this is really about.
[01:09:34] SPEAKER_03: If you saw housing, which was solved in Texas and Florida and Nevada, they let you build supply.
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_03: People don't feel as bad about their lot in life. They don't feel as bad about their progress.
[01:09:44] SPEAKER_03: If we solve tuition and we paired it like we've talked about countless times here and the loans
[01:09:49] SPEAKER_03: matched the outcomes, we would not have this. And if people felt didn't feel the fear of going
[01:09:55] SPEAKER_03: bankrupt from health care, I think we would have a much different country. I think that's what the
[01:09:59] SPEAKER_03: referendum is going to be in 2028 is those three issues. If you're going to be president, you got
[01:10:04] SPEAKER_03: to solve housing and get people out of the way and build housing stock. Number two, you got to give
[01:10:09] SPEAKER_03: some people some basic health care so they don't feel like they're going to get bankrupt. Number three,
[01:10:13] SPEAKER_03: they got to fix education. Those are the three horsemen of the apocalypse and socialism.
[01:10:18] In my thing, I think we will solve this problem. I think you're too rational. The way politics
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_02: works is you find a group to blame and you blame them. That's how you get elected.
[01:10:27] SPEAKER_02: Well, maybe I'll run the group to the president. The group to blame is going to be the tech and the
[01:10:30] SPEAKER_02: elite. And only one of the three or four of us that can. Well, I got a kitchen cabinet. By the way,
[01:10:35] SPEAKER_03: we'll just run it as a fantastic four. I'll be the figurehead and then we'll just sit there.
[01:10:39] SPEAKER_03: Let's solve these three problems. When I run for president, I'm going to start 10 new cities with
[01:10:44] SPEAKER_03: a million houses in each. That's going to be the number one priority. Number two priority is
[01:10:48] SPEAKER_03: universal health care for everybody using technology, GLPs, Daniel X 3D scanner, pronovo, whatever.
[01:10:56] SPEAKER_03: And then number three, I mean, just trade schools. Let's make trade schools free. We just
[01:11:00] SPEAKER_03: talked about electricians. We talked about generation tool belt. Let's make trade schools free.
[01:11:04] SPEAKER_03: Or make them $20,000. You can pay it back over 20 years, $1,000 a year, no interest. What we
[01:11:12] SPEAKER_03: know, come up with that. That's the platform that wins versus let's raise taxes to 60%. Because you
[01:11:17] SPEAKER_03: raise taxes to 60%. I'll tell you what's going to happen. People are going to retire and stop
[01:11:21] SPEAKER_03: investing in companies. It's not worth it to go to work and give 60 or 70% of your
[01:11:26] SPEAKER_03: outcome to the government. People will just stop working, which is what happened in Europe.
[01:11:29] SPEAKER_03: People are just like, screw it. I'll just be rich. I'll stop investing.
[01:11:33] SPEAKER_03: It sucks, man. I think it sucks. I think there's a clear path out. There is a clear path out.
[01:11:38] SPEAKER_03: Solve the three big problems. I think AI is a path if we get if it leveraged into the hands of every
[01:11:44] SPEAKER_02: person in the United States in the world. If we get abundant free energy through new energy systems,
[01:11:50] SPEAKER_02: and if we can extend human lifespan and help span, I think those are the three abundance
[01:11:55] SPEAKER_02: vectors. If those three vectors hit, I think all bets are off. We can get out of this nasty spiral.
[01:12:01] SPEAKER_02: But I do think we have the choice every day. Do we want to go into the enlightenment or do we
[01:12:04] SPEAKER_02: want to go into the dark age? Let's solve those three big problems. All right, listen. Another
[01:12:09] SPEAKER_03: amazing episode of the All in Podcast. I think Jake I'll just announce he's right.
[01:12:13] SPEAKER_03: I'm a president Jason dot com. Go ahead. Jeff Bezos. Maybe you're running me.
[01:12:17] SPEAKER_03: Jake. Oh, you know, he did say, I was going to be your VP.
[01:12:22] SPEAKER_00: Oh, wait, Jamie Diamond and Bezos.
[01:12:26] SPEAKER_02: I go to boothed.oholo.com. If you want to buy merch, I got this great.
[01:12:29] SPEAKER_02: You think that I'm just a hot. Oh, man. We're also vested in your success when you didn't allow
[01:12:35] SPEAKER_03: any of us to invest in your company. Thanks, Bestie. Yeah, we all feel so vested. Go, but I
[01:12:40] SPEAKER_03: I supported free bird for the last five years made him famous and all I got was an Oholo hat.
[01:12:45] SPEAKER_03: How about you, Chema? You got a quarter. Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:48] SPEAKER_03: What do you got to have? I got to have invested in his three companies that failed.
[01:12:53] But I have no haulers here. Can you just give us 10 bips each in Oholo so we can end this?
[01:12:59] SPEAKER_03: I'll take a hat. I'll take a free. You'll take the hat or 10 bips. How about five bips in a hat?
[01:13:03] SPEAKER_03: I'll take a fat. I'll give you some advice. Don't get help people you're running for president. That's my
[01:13:08] SPEAKER_02: That's my big decisions. Can I get a pocket? Do you have a lot? Gentlemen, I got to go. Love you. Take care.
[01:13:14] SPEAKER_02: All right, everybody. Love you, Bestie. Bye. Bye.
[01:13:34] What? What?
[01:13:38] Besties are gone.
[01:13:48] SPEAKER_01: We should all just get a room and just have one big hug. Because they're all just like this like
[01:13:53] SPEAKER_01: sexual tension that we just need to release that out.
[01:13:56] What your BB? What your BB?
[01:14:00] SPEAKER_00: What's going on? We need to get Besties out of that.
