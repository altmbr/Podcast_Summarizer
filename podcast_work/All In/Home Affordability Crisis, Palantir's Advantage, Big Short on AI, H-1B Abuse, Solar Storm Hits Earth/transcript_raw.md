[00:00:00] All right, everybody, Shamoff is here.
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_07: I'm here, Freeberg's here, but Saxi Poo,
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_07: he was up late at the White House.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_07: We'll show some pictures later.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_07: He couldn't make it today, but let's get started.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_07: We wanted to get you a show and we wanted to get it
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_07: to you on time for your weekend.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_07: Let's start with Michael Barriany shirts.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_07: So you guys know, obviously, Michael Barri,
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_07: he's the capital allocator from the big short
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_07: and he just de-registered his firm with the SEC.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_07: He made a big bet against AI and Palantir.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_07: He disclosed the shorts against Palantir a couple of weeks ago.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_07: They weren't huge.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_07: CMBC apparently reported that the value was like 900 million.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_07: Barri says CMBC was wrong that it was just 9 million,
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_07: but he had a really interesting accusation
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_07: and it's related to what we've been talking about here
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_07: on the show with the build out of,
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_07: can we, come sorry, but can we just talk about
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_05: the complete and total financial illiteracy
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_05: of the mainstream media?
[00:00:58] How do you confuse 9,900 million?
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_05: How do you do that?
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_05: I think maybe it's the cause of the shorts versus the value
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_07: of the stock that the shorts represent.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_07: No, it's because there's 100 shares per option.
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_06: So they were like, yes, because the options have 100.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_07: Of course.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_07: They applied a multiple and they got it wrong.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_07: Got it.
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_07: So the math, the calculator, they got the calculator.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_07: It's not that they got the calculator wrong.
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_05: It's just that they're so uninvested in assets
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_05: that they don't know how asset markets work.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_05: I think it's the more logical explanation.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_05: Meaning if you've ever bought a home,
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_05: you probably know what people are talking about
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_05: when they're talking about financial elements related to a home.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_05: But I guess if you've never owned a stock
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_05: or you've never had to position or had an option,
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_05: you don't really know how any of it works.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_05: But then the problem isn't the person that wrote it,
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_05: then there's no fact checking.
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_05: And the whole thing just gets an entire news cycle on its own,
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_05: which by the way helped his short and it never should have.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_05: Because if you heard that some random dude
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_05: had a $9 million bet against the market,
[00:02:07] you would think nothing of it.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_05: But then to manufacture a headline about somebody...
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_05: It's a good point.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_05: Who had a moment, it was almost 20 years ago,
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_05: but whatever, he had a moment where he was kind of right,
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_05: is short the market and you get it two orders of magnitude wrong.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_05: That seems quite wrong.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_07: But at the point, there is a ramification of it,
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_07: which is it created a headwind against the already AI bubble,
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_07: which was deflating after Brad Gerson or Pompid.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_07: I'll take a walk down conspiracy corner.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_05: Oh, maybe the actual person is not economically illiterate,
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_05: but the exact opposite.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_05: And then writes the error on purpose,
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_05: knowing that whoever has to review it,
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_05: has absolutely no idea what they're talking about.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_05: And then they themselves are short.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_05: So I wonder if CNBC should investigate
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_05: whether this person actually had a trade on.
[00:02:56] Oh, there you go, conspiracy corner.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_07: Let's get our timfoil.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_07: The individual.
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_07: You're either a complete moron
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_05: and you don't know how the financial markets work,
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_05: in which case you probably should be working
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_05: at some other media outlet, not CNBC covering the markets.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_05: Or you know how well they work
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_05: and you know the people above you have no idea.
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_05: And so you yourself shorts the market.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_05: You're basically copying the burry trade,
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_05: but then you rewrite the headline
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_05: to look like it's two orders of magnitude bigger,
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_05: which actually could have moved the market.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_05: If you saw a yard short, I mean yeah,
[00:03:29] like that would have probably gotten my attention
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_05: had I read it, a billion dollars is, you know,
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_05: reasonable position to have.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_05: He was accusing also, he's got the Palantir short,
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_07: but on the AI side, he was saying,
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_07: hey, meta and Oracle have been cooking the books
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_07: with 176 billion in hidden depreciation
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_07: to inflate earnings by over 20% in 2028.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_07: And so here's the chart.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_07: Basically we've talked about what is the reasonable life
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_07: of an each 100 of, you know, an Nvidia chip
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_07: or really an Nvidia server if you think of it that way.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_07: You know, do you do these things
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_07: have a three year lifespan, a four or five,
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_07: six year lifespan core weave might be putting them
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_07: at six year.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_07: And that dramatically changes your expenses,
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_07: which then of course, given the scale of the data build out,
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_07: the data center build out could radically change
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_07: your earnings because dividing the cost of a data center
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_07: that cost 100 billion by six or three is, you know, 2x.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_07: So your thoughts, Freiber?
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_07: Yeah, so just to go into a counting corner,
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_06: it's our most favorite, but least often visited
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_06: a corner here on the all in podcast.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_06: Sharpening your pencils.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_06: Yeah, so in a counting, we need a jingle
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_06: for a counting corner sharp.
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_06: But your counsel get your calculator.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_06: Under gap standards, he's generally accepted
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_06: accounting principles.
[00:04:49] When you report your operating expenses every quarter
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_06: as a public company or a gapfiler,
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_06: you take your capex, anything that, you know,
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_06: you make a big investment in and you depreciate it
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_06: over some lifetime.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_06: And there's an accounting process by which you can do
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_06: an internal review and determine that if your depreciation
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_06: schedule doesn't actually map to reality,
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_06: you should make an adjustment.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_06: And so there's a periodic assessment that's done to do that.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_06: And just to give you a sense to your point Jason on the math,
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_06: Google in the last 12 months made $120 billion
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_06: in operating profit.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_06: And let's assume they're making $70 billion in capex
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_06: this year.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_06: That capex does not get deducted from their operating
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_06: profit when they report earnings.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_06: You take the $70 billion and you divide it
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_06: by what's called its useful life and you report that
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_06: every year.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_06: So if you do it over three years to your point,
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_06: it's about $24 billion a year versus six years,
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_06: it's $12 billion a year.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_06: So that would impact the operating profit by on the order
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_06: of call it 10%.
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_06: If the difference between three and six years.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_06: And so what Michael Burry saying is that all of these hyper
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_06: scalers have extended their depreciation schedule
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_06: or the useful life of their data centers by roughly 2x, which
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_06: cuts the operating costs in half when they report it in earnings.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_06: And so it's making their earnings inflate.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_06: So he's claiming they're cooking the books.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_06: But if you go back to the chart that you showed,
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_06: or I could just speak to this, Google first made this change
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_06: in Q1 of 21, where they said the servers are now
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_06: going from three to four years.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_06: The chart shows the combination of servers
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_06: and networking equipment.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_06: Separately in 2021, Google took networking equipment
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_06: from three to five years.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_06: And then in 2023, they took it from five to six years.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_06: And so this is a result of this effort
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_06: where they went in and did an analysis.
[00:06:32] So what happened?
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_06: What happened in the data centers is that the data centers
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_06: transitioned from being primarily data storage
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_06: and data transfer systems, where you would use hard drives
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_06: and RAM and memory to store data and then transmit it
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_06: back out to being data processing centers
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_06: because of the AI boom.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_06: So as AI became more important in the data center,
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_06: more of the dollars that are going into data centers
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_06: were allocated towards chips from data storage,
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_06: which initially was hard drives.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_06: And you throw away the hard drives every 18 or 36 months.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_06: And then solid state memory, solid state memory
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_06: would last two years, four years, six years,
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_06: depending on the type of memory you're using.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_06: And RAM and RAM had this kind of variable lifetime as well.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_06: And then suddenly when you put these processors in
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_06: to process the data to do AI, that's
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_06: the majority of the spend and the majority of the energy
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_06: is going towards the processors.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_06: So if you pull up this clip, this is Google's head of AI
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_06: and infrastructure, speaking at a conference here recently.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_06: There are we.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_00: Do you think of the Capix spend cycle?
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: But more importantly, what are the signals
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_00: that you guys use internally in your thinking?
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you have to plan data centers, whatever,
[00:07:38] four, five years in advance.
[00:07:40] You have to buy nuclear reactors and whatnot.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: So how do you think about the demand signals, as well
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: as your technology signals, and G2 is the same thing for you,
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_00: but from the point of view of enterprise and neoclassic.
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we're early in the cycle.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_01: Is what I would say certainly relative to the demand
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_01: that we're seeing.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_01: So our internal users are, we've been building with TPUs
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_01: for 10 years.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_01: So we have now seven generations in production
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: for internal and external use.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_01: Are seven and eight year old TPUs have 100% utilization?
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's the key part that's been going on.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_06: I've made some calls and I checked around
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_06: with some other friends.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_06: And everyone says the same thing.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_06: That the seven and eight year old TPUs and GPUs
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_06: that are sitting in the data centers
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_06: are still being used and they're being used
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_06: at 100% utilization.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_06: So that actually justifies and validates
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_06: the depreciation schedule being much longer versus shorter.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_06: And I actually think Michael Burry's got this wrong.
[00:08:38] Timoth, what do you think?
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_07: You're involved in obviously inference.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_07: How long will the Grock inferences be out there doing jobs?
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_07: And it does seem like to Freeberg's point
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_07: in the gentleman in the video that there are other jobs to do,
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_07: right?
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_07: Like so basically things move down the lifecycle.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_07: There'll be something for them to do.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_07: When would you actually unplug them?
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_07: I guess is the question and stop using it.
[00:09:01] The business models of these companies
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_05: are just far too good for them to get to the point
[00:09:07] of having exhausted every other operational tactic
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_05: that then they have to cook the books.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_05: These are not the seven companies that are going to cook the books.
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:09:17] The practical thing that's happening
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_05: that Michael is not technical enough to understand
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_05: is that there are meaningful iterations
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_05: in how kernels are working, in how the intention mechanisms
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_05: of these models are being rewritten,
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_05: in how people are swapping out, HBM for SRAM,
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_05: in these designs, in how they're building,
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_05: in some cases really huge dies, in some cases much smaller chip
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_05: letts.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_05: All of this creates more and more utilization.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_05: So these things last longer, and they also need more.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_05: I think that in order to make these accusations,
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_05: you need to have some mode of come of technical grounding
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_05: that I don't think he has.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_05: Here's the thing with shorts in general,
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_05: which I don't like shorting.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_05: So let me just say this, there's supposed to be a check
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_05: on financial malfeasance, but it's not that.
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_05: When you look at these short selling firms,
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_05: for every one of them that actually uncovers malfeasance,
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_05: what it really is is them creating chaos
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_05: and innuendo under the guise of their right to free speech.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_05: And what they do is they put out some screed that
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_05: tries to move the market.
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_05: They're positioned against the stock before it comes out.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_05: And then they hope to close the position out
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_05: and make some money.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_05: I think that's just a pretty sad and terrible way
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_05: to live one's life, but it's legal.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_05: And so you're allowed to do it.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_05: It almost makes no sense for Michael
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_05: to become technically literate because he probably
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_05: wouldn't have written it.
[00:10:49] And to your point, the fear uncertainty
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_07: doubt you can create if you're a Michael Murray,
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_07: if you did the big short and you sure
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_07: in the housing crisis correctly.
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_07: Now that took two years for him to be correct.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_07: These things are painful to execute on in his defense.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_07: They don't make any money.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_05: Look outside of my venture fund, I ran a hedge fund
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_05: for, I don't know, seven years, eight years.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_05: And here are our lawns, okay?
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_05: We, and you can find these clips on the internet,
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_05: you know, Tesla in 2015, Amazon 2016, sales force 2018.
[00:11:24] Just tagged it.
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_05: And you know how much money I made on the short side
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_05: because we always felt like we had to hedge.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_05: And so what we would do is we would bumble around looking
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_05: for shorts, never made any money.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_05: The one short we found was a wireless telecom operator.
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_05: And it was a legitimate fraud.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_05: Its company's corporate address was a pizza parlor
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_05: in Barcelona.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_05: Toversify revenue streams.
[00:11:45] Otherwise, my point is, it's just,
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_05: shorting is just somebody's ability to cry,
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_05: fire in a theater, quite honestly.
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_05: It's extremely hard to impossible to commit
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_05: financial fraud as a public company.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_05: In 2025.
[00:12:00] I guess the other short we should take a look at
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_07: is the Palantir one because Palantir is,
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_07: man, it's way out there.
[00:12:07] Alex Sharp has been doing some great interviews.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_07: He's a national treasure, incredibly entertaining.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_07: They obviously have a great business.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_07: They're on a $3.5 billion run rate,
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_07: according to their last quarter.
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_07: But the valuations, $480 billion,
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_07: this puts them at 137 times their sales.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_07: It is extraordinary.
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_07: It's way out there.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_07: Data dog and snowflake.
[00:12:32] Microsoft, you know, these are at 13 times their sales.
[00:12:39] And I guess Cloud Flare is out there at 37
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_07: and Croucher like at 30.
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_07: So this is truly an outlier, Friedberg.
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_07: If you were to give Palantir the same price
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_07: to sales ratio as some of those highly valued ones,
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_07: probably be a 60, 70 billion dollar company,
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_07: $29 a share instead of 170.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_07: So what do you think of his Palantir short, Friedberg?
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_07: And he's done the statement.
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_07: You just made, you're saying that a company is worth
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_06: their historical sales numbers.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_06: And I don't think that that's how shareholders often do
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_06: or perhaps should think about what they're buying,
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_06: which is an ownership interest in the future
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_06: of the enterprise that they're buying a piece of.
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_06: When you invest in a startup, you're not saying,
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_06: hey, that startup is worth what the employees did last year
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_06: before they even started the company.
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_06: You're making a bet on the future potential of the business
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_06: and what you think the cash generation over time will be.
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_06: Your time horizon may be different than mine
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_06: and that's how a market finds a price.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_06: As a result, I think there's probably a market
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_06: trying to find a price for Palantir
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_06: where folks have a great deal of difference in opinion
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_06: over what the future potential of the business is.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_06: And as a result, what the earnings generation will be
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_06: at different timescales in the future
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_06: and that's how they're getting to the current market price.
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_06: Who am I to judge?
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_06: I am the person who would make my own decision
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_06: of my own time scale and my own estimation
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_06: of the future of that business
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_06: if I were putting my own capital into the business.
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_06: I've not studied the business well.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_06: I don't have a strong point of view or opinion
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_06: on the value of the business relative
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_06: to its future earnings potential.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_06: That's how I would look at it.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_06: I would make an investment for the long term
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_06: if I were to buy the shares.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_06: Not look at the last year's numbers
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_06: and say that there's a valuation arbitrage opportunity
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_06: and that's what I'm buying.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_06: So to each their own, over time,
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_06: the market corrects itself as they say.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_06: It's a voting matter today
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_06: and it's a weighing matter in the future
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_06: that's Warren Buffett's famous quote
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_06: that the actual earnings generation in the future
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_06: will determine whether someone paid a good price
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_06: or a bad price depending on the point
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_06: at which they bought in the past.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_06: Meaning at 400 billion market cap,
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_06: you could be getting a steal
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_06: or you could be significantly overpaying.
[00:14:53] That's gonna be based on your assessment,
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_06: your judgment as an investor.
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_06: And I think, no idea.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_07: People are looking at 30 to 45% year over year growth,
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_07: Chema, and saying, yeah, it's got a lot of,
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_07: to fill in that valuation,
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_07: we just take a lot of growth, maybe the growth,
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_07: accelerates, we saw that within video, right?
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_07: They started to have unprecedented growth.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_07: Any thoughts on Palantir?
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_07: Short while we move on to our next subject.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_07: I think the Palantir is short as stupid.
[00:15:19] And I think that those people will lose money.
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_05: The thing with all of these other companies,
[00:15:25] put your chart up there.
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_05: The thing that the people that are shorting this company
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_05: don't understand is that all of these other businesses
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_05: that you put up there,
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_05: there is a viable competitor of some kind
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_05: that you can switch to.
[00:15:41] And so what I would say is the opposite of what they're saying,
[00:15:45] which is you have a low multiple to sales
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_05: when the churn risk is higher.
[00:15:52] So look at the one with the lowest multiple to sales,
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_05: MongoDB, there's 90 versions of what MongoDB does.
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_05: I'm not gonna say whether MongoDB is good or bad.
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_05: That's actually a good company.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_05: It's an extremely well-run business.
[00:16:06] But it's not unique, it's just extremely well-run.
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_05: Snowflake is not unique, but it is well-run.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_05: Palantir is both unique and well-run.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_05: And there's no clear alternative.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_05: So there's no place to churn too.
[00:16:20] And so I think the reason why it has a premium valuation
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_05: is because the duration and the durability of these cash flows
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_05: are much longer than what you typically see
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_05: in any of these other companies.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_05: And if people took one 1,000th of a second
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_05: to actually use their brain, they'd come to that conclusion.
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_05: Lack of competitors would be the reason
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_07: you think it's more indefensible.
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_07: By the way, I'm neither long nor short.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_05: I was long in the private markets.
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_05: I was an investor in the series, Beapod too.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_05: I'm not long anymore.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_05: I wish I was, but I'm not.
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_05: So it's not like I'd invested interest in this being right.
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_05: But it's just so obvious that what they do
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_05: is completely unique and completely differentiated.
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_05: There is no alternative in the market for it.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_05: That's why they trade it such a huge premium to sales.
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_05: And if you look at any market for any product
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_05: that is unique and is effectively
[00:17:05] where they are the only competitor for what they offer,
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_05: you will see an equivalent market dynamic like this.
[00:17:11] And there is no competitor to the greatest holiday party
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_07: ever happening December 6th in San Francisco.
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_07: Come with your besties.
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_07: Got a big shirt.
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_05: Such a bad mood.
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_05: I've gotten no f**king seat.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_05: I'm so tired.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_05: I know you're cranky.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_05: You're cranky spanky.
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_05: I couldn't see it.
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_05: I couldn't see.
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_05: Saks goes in the back, Saks sleeps.
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_05: He's like fresh as a daisy when we land.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_05: By the way, when we landed, the winds in San Francisco,
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_05: I don't know what's going on.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_05: We landed in Oakland.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_05: Holy s**t man.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_05: It was like a...
[00:17:40] Category 4 hurricane going on in the West Coast this week.
[00:17:44] Unbelievable.
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_07: You were coming in, of course, from the West Coast.
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_07: You were, I guess, in DC meeting with...
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_07: I don't know.
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_07: Oh, you had some business meetings there
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_07: or some political meetings?
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_05: Oh, you can, let's play Wordswoldo here next
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_05: plus the picture.
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_05: You can see Wordswoldo here.
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_05: Here we got pictures to picture.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_05: Okay, we've got a picture here.
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_05: No, Nick, zoom out.
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, to the zoom out photo.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_05: There's Wordswoldo.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_07: Let's see.
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_07: Here's a bunch of people.
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_07: Bill Ackman is right in the back.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_05: You can see his hand right beside Nats.
[00:18:15] That's Ken Bolus, obviously.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_05: Steve Schwartz with me.
[00:18:18] Bergam.
[00:18:19] Look at you, other men.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_07: Great guys.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_05: Will McDonough.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_07: Well, one of these guys is not like the other.
[00:18:26] Yeah, it was awesome.
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_05: What happened was we were having dinner
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_05: and then he said at 9.45,
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_05: I'm going to go down to the oval
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_05: and sign the bill to reopen the government.
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_05: He said, you guys want to come,
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_05: so we all came up with this just to...
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_05: When you say you were having dinner,
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_05: you and Nat were having dinner
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_07: with the president.
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_07: No, no, no.
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_05: He was hosting a dinner for financial leaders.
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_05: And you were there.
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_05: We were glad it was cool.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_05: The dinner.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_05: Very nice.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_05: You went to dinner with the president.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_07: And yeah, that looks like almost as amazing
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_07: and extravagant as the...
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_07: I got a colon.
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_07: You know the colon where he's braided on...
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_07: Yeah, he's spraying it off our leaders.
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_07: They come in, he sprays it on them.
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_07: And then there are lots of people in the White House.
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_07: The Steve Schwartz fanca.
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_05: The pickups.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_05: We got a push, push on both sides of the neck.
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_05: And we got a colon.
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_05: We got a colon with him and spraying people at the dinner.
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_05: No, after the press conference was done,
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_05: he reopened government.
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_05: He's like, hey, you guys want to come back?
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_05: I think they should have like a little gift shop
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_07: at the White House with all the Trump stuff.
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_07: The stakes.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_07: I will be honest with you.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_07: It smells very good.
[00:19:22] Oh, so anyway, come to the holiday party.
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_07: It's going to be a blast.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_07: There's a couple of tickets left, not many.
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_07: We're going to burn it down this year
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_07: with our bestie, Tony Hinch clip.
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_07: Casino Knight with poker.
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_07: We got a celebrity DJ coming.
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_07: Friedberg's going to be on the ones in twos.
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_07: All in dot com slash events, all in dot com slash events.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_07: And hey, the tequila has shipped.
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_07: So if you bought the killer, we started shipping
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_07: the tequila bottles.
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_07: Thank you to everybody for your patience.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_07: We were getting the bottles.
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_07: But David would seem like the bottles have started to ship.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_07: Yeah, people feel I'm pretty good about it.
[00:19:57] Yeah, it's exciting.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_06: I think very exciting.
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_06: The world's greatest tequila is going
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_06: to be surprisingly well received.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_06: OK, from the number one podcast in the world
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_07: with the world's greatest moderator.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_07: All right, listen, there is an affordability crisis.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_07: We talked about it here for the last couple of weeks.
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_07: Last weekend, the Trump administration
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_07: floated a pretty wild idea of a 50-year mortgage
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_07: that would, ostensibly, cut payments, monthly payments,
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_07: by 20%, 30%.
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_07: And maybe theoretically boost home ownership,
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_07: and we'll discuss this in depth here, for young people.
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_07: The idea was slammed by many people in magazine,
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_07: hey, this is debt slavery, and it's
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_07: going to trip over lifetime interest.
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_07: You're going to just be paying through the nose
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_07: for your entire life, and you'll be in a dentured servant.
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_07: Politico said the idea was brought about by FHFA director
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_07: Bill Paltey.
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_07: Paltey tweeted that the FHFA was, quote,
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_07: actively evaluating portable mortgages.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_07: Now, this is a really good idea.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_07: That means you can take your mortgage with you.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_07: If you go by another home, if you upgrade home,
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_07: that would obviously get people out of homes
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_07: that maybe they've outgrown, or that they're kids of left.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_07: And there's extra bedrooms, and that is not happening,
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_07: because we're afraid to unwind a 2% or 3% mortgage
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_07: to upgrade it to a 6% or 7% one.
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_07: And there's been some data going viral on X,
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_07: national association of real-curs released a report last week.
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_07: The average age of a first-time home buyer
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_07: is now 40 years old.
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_07: That's up from 28 years old in 1991, when I was in college.
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_07: And in the 30 years from 1991 to 2021,
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_07: it only increased a modest 18% from 28 to 33 years old.
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_07: So in the last four years, it's jumped from 33 years old
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_07: to 40 years old for the average first-time home buyer.
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_07: Day later, clip of friend of the pod Ben Shapiro
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_07: when viral, here's the 25-second clip,
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_07: and I will talk about it after.
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_02: If you're a young person and you can't afford to live here,
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_02: then maybe you should not live here.
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_02: I mean, that is a real thing.
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_02: And I know that we've now grown up in a society
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_02: that says that you deserve to live where you grew up.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_02: But the reality is that the history of America
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_02: is almost literally the opposite of that.
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_02: The history of America is you go to a place
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_02: where there is opportunity.
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_02: And if the opportunities are limited here
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_02: and they're not changing, then you really should try
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_02: to think about other places where you have better
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_02: opportunities, pretty obvious statement there
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_07: from Ben Shapiro.
[00:22:33] Your thoughts generally on affordability, Chema?
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_05: It's a real problem.
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_05: I think that this is the keystone topic
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_05: that has to be navigated correctly
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_05: for the Republicans to win the midterms.
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_05: I think there are three critical issues
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_05: if I had to sort of put my finger on it.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_05: Issue number one is one of housing.
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_05: So Ben is right there.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_05: Specifically, the problem is that older folks
[00:23:02] SPEAKER_05: own all the homes and own multiple homes
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_05: and younger folks just cannot get into the housing market.
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_05: And cities and states do not do a good job
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_05: of creating incentives for new homes to be built.
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_05: That's one.
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_05: The second, I think, is still around healthcare.
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_05: The emergent data on the cost of a bomb a care is horrible.
[00:23:24] Obamacare has been an unmitigated failure.
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_05: The concept of capping gross margin
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_05: while it seemed good theoretically
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_05: has really turned out to be an incredibly stupid thing.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_05: So what that meant, Jason, is in Obamacare,
[00:23:39] there was this feature that said you can only make
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_05: a 15% gross margin, right?
[00:23:44] And what the folks at the White House at the time
[00:23:48] thought would happen is that costs would go down
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_05: because their gross margin would be limited.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_05: Instead, what they did was they just started
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_05: to raise the gross prices of everything
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_05: so that the 15% applied to a much bigger number.
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_05: And so you saw the president this week
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_05: trying to see if he could just take the health incentives
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_05: and give them directly to people
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_05: and put it in their HSA accounts
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_05: so that it didn't need to flow through
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_05: the healthcare infrastructure and the insurance companies.
[00:24:12] SPEAKER_05: So that needs to get fixed.
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_05: And then the third is on the student debt side.
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_05: I said it last week, I'll say this week,
[00:24:19] I'm sort of copying Peter Till here,
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_05: but he's been saying for a while
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_05: that we have to be much more sympathetic
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_05: to the loan forgiveness.
[00:24:28] And I think he's right.
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_05: So I think if we get these three issues addressed,
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_05: something in housing, something in healthcare
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_05: and something on the student loan side,
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_05: it is a transformational domestic policy agenda
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_05: that puts affordability front and center
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_05: that will impact 50 to 75 million American households.
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_05: Freiburg, your thoughts?
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_06: If you pull up this article from yesterday,
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_06: yesterday, LACD council held a vote,
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_06: the vote was 12 to two.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_06: In this vote, they limited the amount that a landlord
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_06: can increase the rent every year.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_06: This is rent stabilization?
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_06: Yeah, rent control.
[00:25:05] So it limits what a landlord can charge in rent.
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_06: And basically, they passed the vote 12 to two.
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_06: And what they voted is that the landlord
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_06: cannot increase the rent on an annual basis
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_06: by more than 90% of CPI.
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_06: CPI is the consumer price index,
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_06: which is published by a federal agency every year.
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_06: As we know, it's the inflation index number
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_06: that we often talk about on the show,
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_06: with a floor of 1%, so the landlord,
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_06: regardless of CPI can increase rent by 1%,
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_06: and a cap of 4%.
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_06: So CPI spikes for some reason,
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_06: which I don't think it's happened in recent times,
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_06: you can charge up to 4% increase.
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_06: So it limits what a landlord can charge in rent.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_06: And fundamentally, to think about this as an investor,
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_06: so if you're buying a building or building a new building,
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_06: you are now going to have your equity cap,
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_06: your upside, the amount of cash flows
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_06: that you can generate from that asset,
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_06: meaning the apartment building you're buying,
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_06: is now limited by the amount that you can increase
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_06: the rent every year.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_06: So that creates a disincentive for capital,
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_06: for investors to buy new buildings
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_06: or put money into upgrading buildings
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_06: or put money into building new buildings.
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_06: At the same time, as we know,
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_06: the city of Los Angeles, the state of California,
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_06: and the federal government of the United States,
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_06: have passed law after law, regulation after regulation,
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_06: statute after statute has gone into effect,
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_06: that makes it more expensive,
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_06: take more time and more difficult to build housing.
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_06: The increase in regulation,
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_06: combined with the cap in the economic access
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_06: to free markets, I think has made it increasingly difficult
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_06: for there to be a free flow of capital
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_06: to go and build new housing and develop units
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_06: for people to live in and for sale.
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_06: Every time the government gets involved in a market,
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_06: it distorts the market.
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_06: It limits the flow of liquidity,
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_06: and it limits the market finding lower prices.
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_06: And I think that's fundamentally what's gone on.
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_06: The government is now trying to limit
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_06: what landlord can charge in such a dramatic way
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_06: that it's ripped out all of the incentive
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_06: for landlords to buy and own these buildings
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_06: because they're now only gonna be small yielding investments.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_06: And there's no upside,
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_06: so there's no incentive to go and build new housing.
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_06: And then the government's made it difficult
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_06: to build new housing for lots and lots of different reasons.
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_06: Same thing happened with Prop 13,
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_06: which we passed in California in 1978, I think,
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_06: which creates a huge disincentive for people to sell their homes
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_06: and reduce its liquidity in the market.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_06: Now, I'll just flip to the federal agencies.
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_06: So Fannie and Freddie combined have issued
[00:27:49] SPEAKER_06: or supported about $8 trillion of home loans.
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_06: The initial view on that would be, okay, great.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_06: They're creating liquidity for a market
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_06: that doesn't have liquidity for people that need access
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_06: to capital for banks that don't have assets to lend.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_06: And as a result, it's going to make housing
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_06: more accessible to more people.
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_06: That was the fundamental premise
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_06: of setting up a government lending agency
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_06: to support the purchase of housing.
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_06: But as you fast forward over many years,
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_06: the fundamental reality in a very liquid,
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_06: well capitalized marketplace that we have today
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_06: is that that capital is actually excess liquidity
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_06: that can, in fact, drive prices up.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_06: And much like we've seen in many other markets,
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_06: like education with student loans
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_06: or like healthcare with Medicare, Medicaid,
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_06: Obamacare, and so on,
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_06: when the government gets involved and provides capital
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_06: to quote support a market and make it more accessible,
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_06: the prices skyrocket.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_06: So people will use a Fannie or Freddie Mac loan
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_06: to buy a first home and then they can go
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_06: by their second home or their third home.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_06: Or they can now afford to buy a more expensive home
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_06: that the otherwise might not have bought.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_06: And so over time, creates an inflationary effect
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_06: in the markets.
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_06: And I think that this is a fundamental question
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_06: on like how are we gonna get out of this doom cycle?
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_06: Because fundamentally we're adding restrictions
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_06: for building new homes, we're capping the amount
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_06: you can make on homes, and we're giving liquidity
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_06: to markets to drive up the price of homes,
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_06: all of which create this perfect storm of disaster
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_06: where we're just raising our hands.
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_06: And you know what we say?
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_06: Please government do more.
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_06: And if the government does more,
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_06: I can tell you one thing for sure,
[00:29:20] prices are gonna go up even more.
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_06: And so I think one of the challenging and hardest things
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_06: to do is say, hey, government do less
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_06: and figure out a way to kind of back out of this situation.
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_06: Perfect, so we find it up into what I'm seeing on the ground.
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_07: You know, and I lived in New York,
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_07: West Angeles, San Francisco, and as folks know now,
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_07: I live in Austin, Texas, and if you,
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_07: you're perfect segue there, David,
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_07: there's really two different countries here.
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_07: You have people living in coastal cities
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_07: where you're not allowed to build units
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_07: and rent is incredibly expensive.
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_07: And you make the same amount of money.
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_07: If you look at when I grew up in Brooklyn
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_07: and I went to school at night,
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_07: I took five years to get my degree from Ford
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_07: and University, I had 12K and student loan debt.
[00:30:00] I was making 40 to 60,000 a year
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_07: while I was in college doing IT.
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_07: It's a big salary for back then,
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_07: but my apartment for you,
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_07: Berkeley in Brooklyn was 500 a month.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_07: I lived in an apartment and addict apartment.
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_07: And so if you were to take two people like that
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_07: in America today, they're making 60 to 70K.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_07: That's the average salary for college educated people
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_07: who are 27 years old.
[00:30:23] If you live in Austin, it is absolutely no problem
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_07: for you to own a home.
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_07: Let me explain to you how easy it is for you, Bernie.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_07: We have so many units in Austin, Texas
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_07: and in Houston, it's even more pronounced,
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_07: but Nick, pull up the chart there just on rent
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_07: because you start as renters, obviously.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_07: Austin rent has gone down 20% in the last three years
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_07: because we build units.
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_07: When you build units,
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_07: when you have supply prices go down
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_07: and the stupid people in San Francisco
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_07: with their woke bulls**t are like,
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_07: oh, you're building luxury units.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_07: Let me tell you what happens.
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_07: Domaz is when you build luxury units.
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_07: The rich hipsters who are living in sh**y apartments
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_07: in the mission upgrade to luxury buildings.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_07: How do I know this?
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_07: They're doing it in Austin.
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_07: If you live in a crummy apartment in Austin
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_07: and you see these beautiful apartments being made
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_07: with luxurious pools and restaurants, cafes,
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_07: co-working spaces, you move to one of those
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_07: and that frees up that unit.
[00:31:22] In Austin, if you make $130,000 a year,
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_07: your $130,000 as a couple,
[00:31:29] your rent is going to be 10%, 15% max of your income
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_07: and you're gonna be able to make a down payment of 10%
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_07: because the homes within 25 miles
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_07: under 45 minutes of driving to the city center.
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_07: Do you know how much they are square foot free bird?
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_07: Where I live?
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_07: How much?
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_07: They are 200 to $300 per square foot.
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_07: You can buy a free bedroom for 300,000 to 500,000.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_07: You can buy a brand new one free bird for 500,000.
[00:32:02] SPEAKER_07: So Ben Shapiro is absolutely correct.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_07: The people who are upset at Ben Shapiro
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_07: are a bunch of dipsh**sters who went hundreds of $1,000
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_07: in debt are paying $5,000 or $6,000 a month
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_07: in their rent can never get out from under their rent payment
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_07: or their liberal arts bullshit degree.
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_07: If you're a smart person,
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_07: go to the University of Texas,
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_07: graduate with little to no debt,
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_07: live in a modest department,
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_07: put down a down payment and buy a $500,000 home.
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_07: This problem doesn't exist in Texas.
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_07: It doesn't exist in a lot of markets.
[00:32:38] Last night at dinner in Jason,
[00:32:41] SPEAKER_05: the president asked,
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_05: what could we do?
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_05: What are some ideas around student debt?
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_05: And Bill Ackman had a great idea,
[00:32:47] which was we need to put the university
[00:32:51] on the hook as the first loss.
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_06: And his suggestion was 20,000 was what he said.
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_05: I don't know if that's the right number or not.
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_05: But the logic that he made,
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_05: which I thought made a lot of sense was,
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_05: if the universities are forced to underwrite these degrees,
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_05: and they know that they'll take the first dollar loss
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_05: up to a certain amount, 20, 30, 40,000,
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_05: they'll be much more circumspect about what degrees
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_05: they force onto people and the amount of money
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_05: that they're willing to actually underwrite via these loans.
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_05: And that will be a telltale sign
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_05: that a lot of these degrees don't make any sense.
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_05: And right now we don't have a market check to tell
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_05: young people that.
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_05: And so we push them all into school,
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_05: thinking that it's the right thing to do,
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_05: and then they're just completely saddled
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_05: and they'll never get up.
[00:33:35] You have to do math, you have to have agency,
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_07: and you have to be self-reliant.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_07: When I went to school, there were some kids,
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_07: and it's happening now,
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_07: where they think they have to live on campus.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_07: They think they have to go for four years.
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_07: If you have a job and you take five years to get your degree,
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_07: and you don't live on campus,
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_07: your debt position when you graduate
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_07: is going to be much different.
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_07: If you have a job that is,
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_07: in demand in the world, you'll make 60, 70, 80K.
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_07: If you come out with less debt,
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_07: if you live in an addict department,
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_07: if you do a little f*** off-stereity people,
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_07: and you do a spreadsheet of your finances,
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_07: which I had to do because my dad was a bartender,
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_07: my mom was a nurse, I had to pay for college myself,
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_07: I had to think it through.
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_07: These elite lunatic kids in New York City
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_07: or San Francisco, I think they deserve to live in Manhattan,
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_07: you don't have a God-given right to live in Tokyo, France, Hong Kong,
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_07: or any of the major cities.
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_07: You need to live in the suburbs,
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_07: you need to commute an hour to school.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_07: France is a country.
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_05: In Paris, thank you.
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_07: Okay.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_07: In Paris, sorry.
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_07: But if you live in Paris, London,
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_07: these are not your God-given right.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_07: Live an hour outside the city center
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_07: and take the two people.
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_07: These lunatics think they deserve it.
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_07: This is why Mondami and the Legion of Goaps.
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_07: Can we just title this episode Grumpy Chimoff and soapbox J-Count?
[00:34:55] Absolutely.
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_07: No, I just...
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_07: Did you bring your own soapbox?
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_07: Did you bring your own soapbox to Tokyo?
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_05: Did you buy one there?
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_05: Soapbox.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_05: Soapbox.
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_06: Soapbox.
[00:35:06] Yeah, soapbox.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_06: I know.
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_06: I mean, you're going to...
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_06: Soapbox.
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_06: Soapbox.
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_06: You're going to upset so many of the private equity wives
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_05: that you spend most of your time curing favor from.
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_07: I don't even know what I'm going to prove.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_07: I haven't met any private equity wives.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_07: I don't know where they are.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_07: But literally, these kids are so dope there.
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_07: They're in your comments, for sure.
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_05: I don't think they're following me on that.
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_07: I'm sure your bot army pays for some of them too.
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_05: They're not...
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_07: I'm telling you something.
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_07: They're definitely not in P-A-P public equity wives for J-Count.
[00:35:39] When you run for...
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_05: Listen, you're such a narcissist.
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_05: You will eventually run for some political office
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_05: and that'll be something.
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_05: Bearjason.com.
[00:35:46] P-E-Y's for J-Count.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_05: Absolutely.
[00:35:49] You'll be the first to donate to my...
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_07: Give me a break.
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_07: Bro, you know why I would?
[00:35:53] SPEAKER_05: Because you're one of my best friends and I love you.
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_05: So, yes, sight unseen.
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_05: You tell me how much you need on give it to you.
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_05: But not because I believe you're right or you should win.
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_05: Okay?
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_05: I'm coming back to New York.
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_05: After my money comes in,
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_05: press it down.
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_05: Mayorjason.com.
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_05: Book more.
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_05: I am donating to you has no alignment to philosophy,
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_05: ideology or your potential chances of winning.
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_05: It's purely for purchase.
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_05: There it is.
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_05: Hey, guys, book it now.
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_07: I'm controlled by big tech and finance interests.
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_07: I guess related to the angst about affordability
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_07: was the flare-up of H1Bs again.
[00:36:27] Trump went viral after Laura Ingram on Fox.
[00:36:32] Kinda pushed him pretty hard on H1B visas.
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_07: And he stood his ground.
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_07: President Trump stood his ground that we need
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_07: high skilled workers in America.
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_07: Here's your 25 second clip.
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_07: We'll be back on the other side.
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_07: H1B visa thing will not be a big priority
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_04: for your administration.
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_04: Because if you want to raise wages for American workers,
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_04: you can't flood the country with tens of thousands
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_04: or hundreds of thousands of foreign workers.
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_04: You also do have to bring in talent.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_03: When we're a country,
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_03: we're a country of...
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_03: No, you don't.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_03: We don't have talented people now.
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_03: You don't have certain talents
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_03: and you have to, people have to learn.
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_03: You can't take people off an unemployment line
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_03: and say, I'm gonna put you into a factory.
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_03: We're gonna make missiles or I'm gonna put you...
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_03: How do we ever do it before?
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_03: Jamal?
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_07: Your thoughts here.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_07: We've obviously talked to a blue in the face about the value
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_07: and the abuse of H1B visas.
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_07: But it's coming up again.
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_07: And I guess, you know, at a time when Trump's
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_07: popularity is a little bit low
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_07: and people are suffering with the inflation
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_07: not going down, Yadda,
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_07: this seems to be like another point of contention.
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_07: I think that we have to overhaul the H1B program.
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_05: Last night at dinner, actually,
[00:37:45] Howard Lutnik explained,
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_05: how some of these abuses happen.
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_05: It's really unfair, actually, how it works.
[00:37:52] What he described is that when the application window opens
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_05: for what is a very small number of H1Bs,
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_05: a company that has, you know,
[00:38:00] SPEAKER_05: call it 300,000 employees abroad,
[00:38:04] will apply on behalf of all 300,000
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_05: because they're all roughly the same kind of employee
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_05: whoever gets it gets to come over.
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_05: Now, if you're filing 300,000 applications,
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_05: obviously you have a disproportionately larger chance
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_05: than free birth company or my company
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_05: or your company, Jason, who's filing one, obviously.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_05: And so when those kinds of things happen
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_05: and you can now use the data to understand it,
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_05: you have to fix it.
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_05: So that's one very material and obvious change
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_05: we need to make right away,
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_05: which is we have to allow American companies
[00:38:34] SPEAKER_05: to find these folks and have it be very precise.
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_05: The second thing is that we're introducing a price
[00:38:43] SPEAKER_05: that each of these companies can pay for
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_05: so that then you can signal clearly
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_05: the disproportionate economic value
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_05: that that person can create
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_05: and the fact that after all the effort possible,
[00:38:55] you can't find that person here
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_05: and that's why you're willing to pay $100,000,
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_05: which is a non-trivial amount of money.
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_05: So I think that when both of those two things,
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_05: the $100,000 thing is introduced
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_05: and the visa application abuse is fixed.
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_05: I think that we will go a long way
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_05: to cleaning up the H1B thing
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_05: and putting ourselves back into much better place.
[00:39:14] SPEAKER_05: But right now there's just a lot of abuse.
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_05: And so the program itself is not working the way it should have.
[00:39:19] And I think this has largely been solved
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_07: and there's a communication issue
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_07: for the Trump administration
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_07: because they did put this $100,000 fee on it.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_07: That's already in effect.
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_07: And I've been saying this here at CMBC,
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_07: this means it's starting for a decade.
[00:39:31] SPEAKER_07: There's massive abuse on the bottom half
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_07: and it's necessary on the top half.
[00:39:36] If you're bringing an IT people for $40,000 to $80,000,
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_07: it's not viable to put a $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 fee
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_07: on top of that.
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_07: But if you're Google or Facebook
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_07: and you're bringing in a PhD and AI
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_07: who's gonna get paid a million dollars,
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_07: well that $100,000 fee, $20,000, $30,000 a year,
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_07: whatever it winds up being, is nothing.
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_07: It's de minimis.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_07: I take it one step further, Freeberg.
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_07: I think we should be auctioning these
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_07: using more narrow example.
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_05: Let's say Freeberg, it's a startup.
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_05: He has capital, but he has to return it.
[00:40:08] Freeberg, would you pay $100,000 for the right person?
[00:40:11] That you could not find.
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_05: And are there jobs where right now you're like,
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_05: man, I can't find people that are highly specialized
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_05: or not yet.
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_05: I could see that.
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_06: Yeah, I mean, certainly I could see it being,
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_06: I mean, unfortunately I have,
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_06: we can recruit those sorts of people in my industry
[00:40:27] because we're very special.
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_06: But yeah, I can understand,
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_06: particularly it relates to software,
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_06: I could see people definitely doing that.
[00:40:35] Yeah, and the way to really do this,
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_07: and this is Trump's superpowers,
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_07: turning something that's a cost center into a profit center,
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_07: I always give him credit when he does something brilliant.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_07: And the brilliant thing to do is to take the $100,000
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_07: and make it an auction.
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_07: I would auction off half of these to the highest bidder.
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_07: And then you would have Google Facebook and MediSing,
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_07: instead of give me, you know,
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_07: $100,000 of these at the rack rate,
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_07: they would be saying, hey, I need 10 of these,
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_07: for sure, I'm gonna bid a million.
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_07: I need another 100 of these,
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_07: I'm willing to bid 750.
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_07: And then take that money and just allocate it
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_07: to vocational training and retraining.
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_07: You know, the problem is this administration
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_07: has two different sides.
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_07: You have the brilliant people in this administration
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_07: who I admire very much, like Leightonick and SACs
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_07: and the business people.
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_07: And then you have the knuckleheads in my mind,
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_07: the people who are doing the stuff that ice agents
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_07: and the deportations.
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_07: And the perfect example of this has come up
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_07: with the H1B visas, they took the Hyundai plant
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_07: where you needed high skilled workers
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_07: and they arrested and they deported a bunch of South Koreans.
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_07: They in a very brutal way, very disrespectful way.
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_07: At the same time that Leightonick is out there
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_07: trying to get people to invest in the country
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_07: and build factories here.
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_07: You can't be deporting people with Stephen Miller's
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_07: deranged process of running people down
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_07: and treating them in humanely.
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_07: And then at the same time, be saying,
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_07: hey, we want you to invest and build a battery factory.
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_07: Hyundai has a battery factory.
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_07: These lunatics came there and arrested and chained up
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_07: South Koreans who are our partners
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_07: who are helping us rebuild our navy.
[00:42:11] This is where the administration has to speak
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_07: with one voice and it needs to be the professional smart people.
[00:42:17] And this is another example of it.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_07: They already solved this problem and they can't communicate
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_07: it properly.
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_07: Let Besson go out there and communicate this
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_07: over and over and over again.
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_07: It's a profit center now and don't arrest the South Koreans
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_07: who we're trying to get to build factories here.
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_07: It's a Scraziah.
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_06: Next topic.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_06: There was a massive, three massive,
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_06: coronal mass ejections this week.
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_06: These are giant waves of charged particles,
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_06: protons and electrons mostly that shot off from the sun.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_06: You can see a graphic here.
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_06: You have to take better words.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_06: That looks like your aim is right now.
[00:42:55] SPEAKER_06: Did you ever believe it?
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_06: Mass, mass ejections shot out.
[00:42:59] SPEAKER_05: Mass shot out.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, from Uranus.
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_06: Okay, so the sun goes through an 11 year cycle.
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_06: As you know, the sun is a giant ball of plasma.
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_06: Plasma is where the particles are so hot.
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_06: They're so energetic that the electrons and the protons
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_06: and all the particles kind of split apart.
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_06: And so you have these subatomic particles
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_06: moving around at extremely high energy levels.
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_06: And when they, when the protons smash into each other,
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_06: that's what fusion is and that's what causes the energy
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_06: that we get from the sun.
[00:43:35] And because these are charged particles,
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_06: protons have a positive charge and electrons have a negative charge.
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_06: When they're moving around at this high energy in such a dense space,
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_06: they actually create very powerful magnetic fields.
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_06: And those magnetic fields pull and stretch the physics
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_06: of the surface of the sun.
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_06: And over time, there are these cycles where those magnetic fields
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_06: strengths get so strong that once in a while they snap
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_06: and shoot out a chunk of those particles into space.
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_06: That is the fundamental physics that drives these coronal mass
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_06: ejections, these big waves of charged particles
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_06: that shoot flying through space at thousands of miles a second
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_06: is how fast they move.
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_06: High energy waves of charged particles.
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_06: And then when they hit the earth because they're charged particles
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_06: and we have a magnetic field around the earth,
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_06: they interact with the magnetic field and they disturb it.
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_06: And the disturbance of the magnetic field on earth
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_06: can actually have dramatic effects on GPS,
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_06: on communications, and it can actually create shorts
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_06: in conducting material on the surface of the planet.
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_06: So for years, we've always talked about there could be
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_06: an extinction level event one day.
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_06: If one of these coronal mass ejections are so large,
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_06: they could actually wipe out satellite communication,
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_06: they could turn off all computers,
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_06: they could cause shorts in the electrical grids
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_06: around the planet.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_06: There's all these major risks.
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_06: So this is often talked about as like when's this big event
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_06: going to happen in this week?
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_06: It was a very big event.
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_06: There were three major coronal mass ejections
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_06: that happened in a row, two of them kind of combined
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_06: and hit the earth at the same time.
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_06: And we had the highest level recorded geomagnetic storm,
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_06: which was G5.
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_06: So this G5 storm caused massive disruptions
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_06: in the magnetic field strength of the earth.
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_06: Fortunately, there was not a lot of reported damage,
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_06: but we did get to enjoy the beautiful Aurora
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_06: as far south as Texas in the United States
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_06: because these charged particles with magnetic field,
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_06: they kind of moved towards the North and South Pole.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_06: And then they combined with molecules in the atmosphere,
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_06: they release light.
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_06: And you can see these beautiful waves of orange, yellow, red,
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_06: green, purple lights that look like they're coming down
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_06: from the heavens all over the planet.
[00:45:51] SPEAKER_06: It was really an amazing and spectacular sight.
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_06: So it was a scary week from a solar storm perspective,
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_06: but it created a beautiful view here on earth.
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_06: So that was the explanation for what happened
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_06: with the geomagnetic storm this week.
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_06: But to be clear, there were no other adverse effects
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_07: from the CME.
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_07: So far, there were some reports of communications going
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_06: at an Africa and on small networks and things like that.
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_06: I did not hear about widespread satellite failures,
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_06: which is obviously always a big risk with these things
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_06: because these things can actually short out satellites.
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_06: I mean, these are clouds of protons moving very densely.
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_06: Actually, you know what Nick, can you pull up?
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_06: This is one chart to look at.
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_06: So this chart actually shows on a log scale,
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_06: which means every step up on the chart
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_06: is 10 times bigger than the number before it.
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_06: But you can see that right around midnight London time
[00:46:45] SPEAKER_06: on November 12th, which by the way,
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_06: was just before I got on the airplane
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_06: to fly from Japan to San Francisco.
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_06: So I was actually considering not getting on my flight
[00:46:55] around this time.
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_06: Really?
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_06: But there was a, yeah, very seriously.
[00:46:58] SPEAKER_06: Well, he didn't want to have a mass ejection on his flight.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_07: You're not, that would have been really bad.
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_07: Well, you thought like the GPS could go out or something?
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_07: No, no.
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_07: So this has happened in the past
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_06: and that they do have redundancy for the GPS going out,
[00:47:09] SPEAKER_06: but the radiation level spikes when you're that high up.
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_06: But only at higher latitudes.
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_06: I was looking at the latitude of my flight path,
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_06: but they actually turned off all flights
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_06: going over the North Pole because the radiation gets so high.
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_06: You can't fly over the North Pole
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_06: when you have this much magnetic flux happening,
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_06: particularly in the Northern latitude.
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_06: So you can see in this image that red bar is protons
[00:47:34] that are moving, that have an energy greater
[00:47:37] SPEAKER_06: than 10 mega electron volts,
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_06: which is not a super high energy,
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_06: but more scarily is the green one.
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_06: The green one is actually 100 mega electron volts.
[00:47:48] SPEAKER_06: This is a massive amount of energy and a proton.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_06: That can cause serious damage on a microscopic level.
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_06: So it can shred DNA, for example.
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_06: It can shred circuits and so on.
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_06: So this is a very powerful set of positively charged protons.
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_06: And they count how many they're picking up on these satellites
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_06: where they have these kind of detectors
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_06: as they come from the Sun, how many of them they're hitting.
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_06: And you can see this extraordinary spike
[00:48:13] SPEAKER_06: where it spiked up from normally you see,
[00:48:15] SPEAKER_06: call it one,
[00:48:18] to all the way up to 1,000.
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_06: So it spiked by 1,000 X in five minutes.
[00:48:25] And so this is a massive increase
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_06: in the natural background effect of charged protons
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_06: shooting at this extremely high energy through space
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_06: and hitting our...
[00:48:35] SPEAKER_07: That Carrington event, which was the largest one ever recorded,
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_07: I'm sure you're aware of Friedberg like in the 1800s.
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_07: What would happen if we had that level of event today
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_07: given the infrastructure?
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_07: Because back then we had telegrams, right?
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_07: We didn't have a lot of equipment,
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_07: but some of that equipment got fried during the Carrington event.
[00:48:54] Yeah, I mean, that's the sort of event
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_06: that can absolutely short circuit electronic equipment,
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_06: either in satellites.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_06: And then they would be rendered permanently unusable.
[00:49:03] It can also, if it hits the surface of the Earth,
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_06: because remember what protects the Earth
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_06: is magnetic field we have.
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_06: And the reason we have a magnetic field around the Earth
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_06: is because we have an iron core at the Earth.
[00:49:12] SPEAKER_06: And as that iron core rotates,
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_06: it creates a magnetic field.
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_06: And we're very lucky to have that
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_06: because that magnetic field actually is like a shield.
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_06: It's like a force field around the Earth.
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_06: And it shoots charged particles away from the Earth
[00:49:24] SPEAKER_06: and keeps them from hitting the surface of the Earth,
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_06: which would kill all life on Earth over time.
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_06: That's why we can't go live on the surface
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_06: of the Earth with that protection.
[00:49:32] So preparing for a Carrington event,
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_07: like if it happened, you could turn off all the equipment.
[00:49:36] SPEAKER_07: No, like power grids and stuff like that.
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_07: So what would happen is you could have these voltage spikes
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_06: that can actually short circuit physically destructure
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_06: the microchips, the little wire connectors.
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_06: So this is a very serious risk to civilization,
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_06: which is why people always talk about
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_06: these solar storms being those black swan events,
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_06: those one and a million year events,
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_06: or those one and a hundred year events
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_06: that could render us back into the stone ages.
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_06: Some people say, it's unclear the probability of that,
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_06: but the sun does go through an 11 year cycle.
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_06: And during that 11 year cycle,
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_06: there's a minimum and a maximum.
[00:50:10] SPEAKER_06: We're kind of close to the maximum right now.
[00:50:12] SPEAKER_06: So we are seeing these events very predictably
[00:50:14] SPEAKER_06: every 11 years, but how big they are
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_06: is something that's unknown to us.
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_06: I mean, we try and study the dynamics of the sun,
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_06: but it's very difficult for us to be very predictive
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_06: about how big DCMEs are going to be
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_06: when they're going to happen.
[00:50:28] So we have to be on top of like observing as they happen,
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_06: but then we only have a few hours to say,
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_06: oh my gosh, this thing's coming for us to be where
[00:50:34] SPEAKER_06: everyone will watch out, be careful,
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_06: but there's not very much we can do to prepare.
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_06: I will say, I have a belief that I think
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_06: electron-based computing is going to go by the wayside
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_06: by the end of the century and be replaced
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_06: with photon-based computing.
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_06: And I think we're going to move most of what we do today
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_06: with copper and semi-conducting material
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_06: over to photonic material and photonic systems,
[00:50:55] SPEAKER_06: and what will ultimately be quantum meets photonic systems,
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_06: probably some point this century.
[00:51:00] SPEAKER_06: When that happens, these risks go away,
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_06: but for now, while we're relying on electrons
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_06: and moving electrons around through copper wire and so on,
[00:51:08] SPEAKER_06: we run the very strong risk of these geomagnetic storms
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_06: having an adverse effect on the planet
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_06: and on our core infrastructure.
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_06: Freberg, I got to see you earlier this week in Tokyo.
[00:51:17] We shared a little tempura.
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_07: Good times, yeah.
[00:51:21] Good times in Tokyo.
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_06: Definitely a lot of X-pats making their way
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_06: from the tech industry to Tokyo.
[00:51:27] It's a booming, booming, taxing.
[00:51:30] There's a lot of people from America
[00:51:33] who have come to the conclusion
[00:51:35] that the great confiscation is upon us.
[00:51:37] SPEAKER_07: This is what I'm calling it, the great confiscation.
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_07: Whether it's California or New York,
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_07: they're coming for your bags,
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_07: and so people are now looking for not one,
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_07: but two escape hatches, a state, a sovereign state,
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_07: Freberg, in the United States,
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_07: a great state of Texas where I held from, two years,
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_07: and people are looking for an international.
[00:52:01] Everybody's getting themselves a passport
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_07: or a gold in visa, Japan, Riyadh,
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_07: and where I've spent the last two weeks
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_07: are amongst the top choices.
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_07: Do you see this image behind me?
[00:52:13] SPEAKER_06: This is that forest city in Malaysia.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_06: It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[00:52:19] You wet there?
[00:52:20] I went there last week.
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_06: They put a $100 billion into building this island,
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_06: a whole city.
[00:52:25] SPEAKER_06: This is the thing that Bologna owns?
[00:52:27] No, he rented a hotel.
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_06: They have a big resort hotel.
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_06: He rented the whole hotel.
[00:52:32] SPEAKER_06: That's where he's running his network school.
[00:52:34] SPEAKER_07: He's running essentially like an in-person Y-combinator,
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_07: network state.
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_07: You pay one fee for your apartment, your food, your gym,
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_07: and you hang out with other people
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_07: who want to be part of a new society.
[00:52:47] With their own rules.
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_07: Kind of interesting.
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_07: But between Matt and Singapore and Tokyo,
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_06: I mean, there was like a really interesting cross-section
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_06: of people that I would say are kind of on the frontier of tech
[00:53:05] that feel like it's not in the United States anymore.
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_06: And they're looking for what feels like the Wild West.
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_06: Where can we go?
[00:53:13] SPEAKER_06: Where can we put down roots?
[00:53:14] SPEAKER_06: Where can we establish a new town for a new era?
[00:53:18] Because a lot of people view the US at the end of a cycle.
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_06: And look, it may not be a massive community today,
[00:53:24] SPEAKER_06: but it's a burgeoning community,
[00:53:26] SPEAKER_06: it's a growing community.
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_06: And there's this really, I think,
[00:53:30] SPEAKER_06: interesting, maybe scary trend line of folks wanting
[00:53:35] SPEAKER_06: to kind of see this stuff happen outside the US
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_06: and making an effort to...
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_06: I'm going to start my own little community.
[00:53:43] For Vikuno.
[00:53:45] Vikunian Wagyu.
[00:53:47] SPEAKER_05: Those are the two litmus tests for entry.
[00:53:49] SPEAKER_05: Shamaatha Poppola?
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_05: A Poppola?
[00:53:51] SPEAKER_05: It's going to be...
[00:53:53] You could only wear Vikunian,
[00:53:55] SPEAKER_06: you could only eat Wagatha Poppola.
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_06: All right, everybody.
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_06: Another amazing episode.
[00:54:00] SPEAKER_07: The All-in Podcast is in the can.
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_07: Love you, Besties.
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_07: We're like your winners, right?
[00:54:07] SPEAKER_02: Rainman David Sack.
[00:54:12] And it said...
[00:54:13] We open-source it to the fans,
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_03: and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:54:17] SPEAKER_03: Love you, Bestie.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_03: I sweet up, you know what?
[00:54:19] I'm going crazy with it.
[00:54:20] I'm going crazy with it.
[00:54:21] What?
[00:54:22] What?
[00:54:23] What?
[00:54:24] What?
[00:54:25] What?
[00:54:26] What?
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_07: Besties are gone.
[00:54:28] That's my dog taking it away.
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_07: She's your driveway, so...
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_07: We're gonna die.
[00:54:32] Oh, man.
[00:54:35] We should all just get a room and just have one big hug,
[00:54:38] SPEAKER_05: because they're all...
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_05: It's like this sexual tension
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_05: that we just need to release some of them.
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_05: What?
[00:54:44] You're the big...
[00:54:46] SPEAKER_03: What?
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_03: You're the real big...
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_03: What?
[00:54:49] SPEAKER_03: We need to get Besties aren't there.
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_03: I'm going crazy with it.
[00:54:59] I'm going crazy with it.
