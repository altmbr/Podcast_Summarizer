[00:00:00] All right back with us in place of David Freiberg who's busy this week is the one the only honest fourth appearance here on the online podcast.
[00:00:10] David Sacks: Mr. Tucker Carlson how are you? Thanks for having me.
[00:00:13] David Sacks: Hey Tucker get to see you David.
[00:00:16] How do you have time for every time I every time I turn on my phone there's like David sacks on something incredibly complex like.
[00:00:25] Are you sleeping usually people attacking me for something.
[00:00:28] Jason Calacanis: But it's not just like oh your views are this or that.
[00:00:32] Tucker Carlson: Geopolitical conflict it's like the details of something.
[00:00:37] Very complicated and I'm just like wow man that's a lot that's a lot to digest yeah there's not a very high bar in Washington as you know.
[00:00:47] You're a giant among big mace but still it's a lot of work in the land of the blind the one I'd man as king king exactly exactly.
[00:00:54] Jason Calacanis: Are you still enjoying it yeah it's been a lot of fun.
[00:00:57] Jason Calacanis: Well you know president Trump's a lot of fun to work for he's the most fun I mean the best right he got a big shout out yesterday it was really awesome.
[00:01:04] Chamath Palihapitiya: David did yeah huge had a well that's right we're at the White House Christmas party I think they do like 25 of these yeah literally literally because they got so many thousands of people but they can only fit a couple of other people in the White House.
[00:01:15] Jason Calacanis: And they're doing like two a day and the president comes down and gives a speech and every speech is different you know it's like a Dave Chicago routine where he never does the same set.
[00:01:25] And he does it with so much enthusiasm and gusto you would think that you are the only you know holiday was your only proud that he ever addressed.
[00:01:36] Jason Calacanis: He never expresses any irritation at doing that he loves it it's like amazing it's unbelievable but any event he gave me a shout out during the speech and then.
[00:01:45] Jason Calacanis: He called me up there like hey can you say a couple words about the eye.
[00:01:49] Well this is an exactly Chris's party conversation so I just kind of talked about how great he was and how much fun it was to work for him and they gave
[00:01:58] Jason Calacanis: Trematha shout out as well way and he just starts talking about the all in pod like we're in the audience and he just starts having a conversation with us about the all in pod and how's it doing and you know the funniest part
[00:02:10] Jason Calacanis: was he says to me oh and then that was behind him so it goes hey not and he says I hope everything's going well how's your relationship he looks at me and I'm like this and then that's behind her.
[00:02:25] Oh it's so awesome I'm going this weekend because I miss him you're going to see this weekend you guys are on good terms talk with Trump. Oh yeah the best I mean the best I mean of course people have told him many people these don't
[00:02:38] Tucker Carlson: have to talk to me so that just makes them like me much more because like all he hears is oh he's like he's the worst human being who's ever lived and all Trump
[00:02:46] Tucker Carlson: hears is who's ever lived you know and he's just that he's just he's you can't control him that way that period so no I get along with him literally in 25 years better than I ever have.
[00:02:59] That's good to hilarious yeah the last part of that story is.
[00:03:03] Jason Calacanis: So after he calls up me and Jamal actually he calls me up to speak and then calls David up to speak he went on a little bit of a riff saying you know I don't like the term artificial intelligence because why would you want to call it artificial it sounds bad.
[00:03:17] Jason Calacanis: Why don't they call it something else super intelligent intelligence organ and then and then he calls up Jamal said Jamal what do you think and Jamal says well I think I think AI is too late to change but maybe it could be American intelligence.
[00:03:30] Jason Calacanis: And then he says yeah but you know we want it to be used by the whole world so it's the whole world anyway we start workshopping this brand the exercise.
[00:03:39] Jason Calacanis: The entire Chris's party how about Trump super intelligence okay it's Trump intelligence no but you know what calling AI American intelligence is actually the smartest and best one could do around AI.
[00:03:53] We got a lot to talk about Tucker you've been on a run huh you've been on a run I mean not in my I mean I'm.
[00:03:59] Tucker Carlson: Off social media mostly so it's like nothing's actually really happening in my room you don't open exit all it's all about me man I'm not going to I don't like to read about myself so I don't look at it no.
[00:04:10] Tucker Carlson: All right topic number one paramount versus Netflix there in a bidding war over the future of Warner Brothers and all that amazing IP.
[00:04:19] David Sacks: The assets obviously many of us know Warner Brothers is led by Zazlaw David Zazlaw but he owns currently HBO DC and the Warner Brothers collections films also they have that great studio lot on the cable side they own CNN TNT discovery.
[00:04:38] David Sacks: And they just saddle that company up with 30 billion dollars of debt and they had a little bit of a competition for who would buy it Netflix and paramount skydance run by the Alison family Netflix offered 83 billion dollars to purchase just the streaming assets which would put the number one in the number three player together and WBD publicly accepted Netflix offer last Friday this is created.
[00:05:08] David Sacks: A bit of our fluffle paramount now is coming in with a hostile offer 108 billion in cash for the entire company that includes the cable assets that would be interesting because then David Ellison son of Larry Ellison would own not just CBS which is being run CBS news by your favorite Tucker Carlson Barry wise.
[00:05:30] She would also I guess own and run CNN in this instance potentially we'll get to that the 108 billion dollar offer includes two vehicles 41 billion in equity financing by the Alison family.
[00:05:45] And then a bunch of other folks coming in including and we'll get to this some Middle East sovort wealth funds.
[00:05:53] David Sacks: Holly market interestingly has paramount as the favorite at 51% and Netflix has dropped to 36% even though they say they have a done deal and 14% chance of no deal I think that might be the free money the 14% chance of no deal what you're taking on this Tucker.
[00:06:12] And just broadly speaking consolidation in media having pulled the rip court and left traditional media and now.
[00:06:21] The understanding is you're doing better than ever you can throw your destiny and I think you're making.
[00:06:26] David Sacks: Probably as much or more money now than you did when you were working for the man yeah I actually haven't checked but I'm not much of a money guy but I'm fine and pay my non existant mortgage.
[00:06:38] I'm against monopoly power in general because I think it's stifles creativity I'm not that worried about this because these you know these things never move in exactly direction you imagine I've been in media my entire life and none of the big changes I anticipated in fact almost all of them I made fun of.
[00:06:56] Tucker Carlson: I just don't think that we're really threatened by you know a conglomerate of CNN and Netflix also it's like okay you can assemble huge companies can you make people consume and believe the product you know buying CBS news is like buying RCA records or something it like just doesn't have any effect and only people who were not paying attention are pretty cut off think.
[00:07:26] Tucker Carlson: You're going to win hearts and minds by being buying CBS news or CNN these are these brands are husks in fact all they are as brands at this point and I just am not at all convinced that this will have a material effect on anyone's attitudes at all you know if you started to mess with what YouTube is allowed to air or the ownership of X you know then I think you could really change the country and the conversations that were allowed to have but I don't see any of this as especially meaningful.
[00:07:56] Tucker Carlson: On the society I mean is the is the product can you get.
[00:08:00] No I don't know more subversive than it already is I mean it's like Netflix is going to be worse for American society probably not you know I think this is a business story not a cultural story.
[00:08:11] Chimati are those.
[00:08:13] I'll give you two.
[00:08:14] Chamath Palihapitiya: The first is that whenever you see deals it's important to look at the amount of money that that is at risk and that is the best tell about whether this is important for the future or not.
[00:08:25] Chamath Palihapitiya: 100 billion dollar deals are typically about things in the past.
[00:08:30] Chamath Palihapitiya: What is the future billion dollar deals so for example when you look at when Facebook bought Instagram for a billion dollars.
[00:08:37] Chamath Palihapitiya: That turned out to be a huge bet about the future it was right.
[00:08:41] When Google bought YouTube for a billion six that was a huge bet on the future they were right.
[00:08:47] Chamath Palihapitiya: When Microsoft invested a billion dollars in OpenAI that was a huge bet on the future it was right.
[00:08:53] Chamath Palihapitiya: But when you look at assets that trade at 100 billion dollar plus valuations they're so undergirded by debt all of that debt is only ever bought by looking at the past.
[00:09:04] Chamath Palihapitiya: Meaning how much money have they made and then it's the best guess about how much money could they make in the future.
[00:09:09] Chamath Palihapitiya: So these multi hundred billion dollar assets to Tucker's point they don't really matter that much.
[00:09:13] Chamath Palihapitiya: I don't think it's super anti competitive these are financial transactions the reality in media so specifically about this deal.
[00:09:20] Chamath Palihapitiya: So that's a general statement about deal quantum and you can just judge the importance based on that.
[00:09:26] Chamath Palihapitiya: People should be spending much more time looking at billion dollar transactions and 100 billion dollar ten transactions.
[00:09:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: That's my takeaway there.
[00:09:32] Chamath Palihapitiya: But at the very specific thing about this deal the reality is that the future is unscripted, uncontrolled user generated content.
[00:09:42] Chamath Palihapitiya: You see it on YouTube it is already the 800 pound gorilla in this space.
[00:09:46] Chamath Palihapitiya: And then separately it's now becoming about shorter form video and you see that with things like Instagram Reels and TikTok.
[00:09:53] None of that landscape will change based on this deal.
[00:09:56] Chamath Palihapitiya: If anything if those trends accelerate the value of historic IP is going to erode even faster.
[00:10:03] Chamath Palihapitiya: Meaning this generation of kids will have no idea or care about the Marvel cinematic universe about Star Wars.
[00:10:11] Chamath Palihapitiya: And that may upset those of us who are nostalgicly tied to it.
[00:10:15] Chamath Palihapitiya: So I don't know I would let the deal happen. I don't think it's particularly that important.
[00:10:19] Sax obviously you don't speak for the administration on these issues but I'm curious your thoughts on this.
[00:10:25] David Sacks: Yeah just my personal view on this is that we're going to get meaningful consolidation in the industry either way because either Netflix and Warner's are going to merge or paramount and Warner's are going to merge.
[00:10:38] Jason Calacanis: So either way union is consolidation but that being said if Netflix is allowed to buy Warner's the antitrust concerns are a lot more serious because Netflix really is the 800 pound gorilla in Hollywood right now it's the number one streamer by far has got the biggest market cap.
[00:10:53] Jason Calacanis: And they're the party who the rest of Hollywood is freaked out about right now and so you saw that the Hollywood unions like the WGA.
[00:11:02] Jason Calacanis: Sad they oppose the deal because they're fearing job cuts lower wages.
[00:11:07] Worse in conditions due to reduced demand for talent and then the the content creators and distributors are worried about this too because.
[00:11:16] Netflix is known for making tougher deals I think than the traditional studios I've got a friend who's a showrunner and Hollywood and he's done projects with both Netflix and with the studios traditional studios.
[00:11:29] Jason Calacanis: And he says the big difference is Netflix will pay you pretty well but you don't get any equity in your show like whatever you get is sort of agreed to at the beginning that's it.
[00:11:37] Jason Calacanis: So you're not really an entrepreneur when you do a show for them but when you then work for a studio you actually get it back in now there's all sorts of.
[00:11:44] Jason Calacanis: You know Hollywood accounting associate with that but he kind of misses the days.
[00:11:49] Jason Calacanis: That are going away where he got to be a little bit of an entrepreneur and have real upside in his shows and if Netflix now is allowed to acquire Warner Brothers and that's just another nail in that old coffin and so I think it is a big change and if the anti trust regulators look at this I do think.
[00:12:06] Jason Calacanis: That paramount has a better chance the other big factor is just that.
[00:12:12] Paramounts offering more they up the bid.
[00:12:14] Jason Calacanis: It's a hundred and eight billion versus around 80 or it's like $3 to share versus 27 and they're also buying the whole company whereas Netflix just wants Warner's studio assets and streaming assets is like HBO as opposed to the cable assets which are considered a little bit of a
[00:12:32] Jason Calacanis: sh**co so I think if you're a shareholder in Warner's you probably want to sell the whole thing that you don't just be stuck with the bad assets so yeah I'm a little surprised actually that the Warner's board went with Netflix when they had paramount as an option.
[00:12:50] Jason Calacanis: This is mean this paramount offer was on the table because it seems like a better deal and it's probably a little bit more likely to get through the regulators.
[00:12:58] Jason Calacanis: So I guess I'm a little bit surprised they chose Netflix but I guess Netflix is the more bona fide party right 400 billion dollar market cap and maybe they thought that they're more able to execute this transaction.
[00:13:10] Jason Calacanis: Yeah I have only three points on this number one.
[00:13:14] It really depends on how you frame competitors in this space.
[00:13:19] David Sacks: Here's your page streaming platforms Netflix Disney and HBO Disney's done an amazing job.
[00:13:24] After starting a decade after Netflix which streaming of really getting a lot of subscribers and consolidating one in three here obviously puts Disney way behind but if you start looking at tick tock instagram.
[00:13:39] David Sacks: YouTube these properties have the majority of the audience they do or the audience of these paid services and young people are not interested in movies anymore they want obviously.
[00:13:52] Tick tocks and YouTube if you look at the revenue it's a question about that chart before you move on.
[00:13:58] Jason Calacanis: Does how do you compare or do you adjust for time watched or minutes because I didn't in this but yeah that would be a difference watching a tick tock and watching you know movie.
[00:14:09] Jason Calacanis: On Netflix in terms of attention span.
[00:14:12] Jason Calacanis: With you about the.
[00:14:14] Jason Calacanis: Look there's only watching the cultural significance has moved away from Hollywood towards user generated content on these online platforms.
[00:14:21] Jason Calacanis: Boundless curious to you adjusted for that yeah no I didn't adjust for that you could you could slice it a bunch of different ways but at the end of the day you know I put the competitive set as a little bit broader here which is including the free.
[00:14:34] You know you GC services since that's what young people are doing.
[00:14:38] And then if you look at revenue.
[00:14:40] You know it's a slightly different picture here these paid services are doing extremely well and they are juggernauts in terms of making money and profitability now.
[00:14:49] David Sacks: And you GC obviously is much larger especially on a global basis the more important thing here is how we do antitrust in the country trump wants to be involved in this he said he's going to be very involved in it.
[00:15:04] You know which as an 80 year old he's involved in everything why not be involved in this he shouldn't be put that aside.
[00:15:11] I think we need to have a way to pre-veth these and then just let the highest bitter win I don't know how this concept is getting convoluted but the Ellicins are compromising trump a bit here.
[00:15:21] David Sacks: I think that's why trump gave a lot of shine to Ted Cerandos I don't know if he sort of quotes about that sacks but he was praising what a genius Ted Cerandos is and how amazing Netflix is.
[00:15:31] David Sacks: The Ellicins coming out and you know basically saying that they've got this in and you know they're going to basically have the inside track here.
[00:15:39] David Sacks: I think is one of the issues I propose we have a pre-vetting of these large deals because we want M&A to be vibrant in this country we want more M&A after the wrath of Lena Khan.
[00:15:53] So I think you should be able to pre-veth Chimoff you should be able to go to the government and say hey we're considering selling this asset whatever it happens to be.
[00:16:01] You know YouTube back in the day is there anybody who's not able to participate in this auction and then just have the FTC pre-veth some of these.
[00:16:08] David Sacks: And then high is better seems like what's best interest in the best interest of shareholders.
[00:16:13] David Sacks: It's untanable.
[00:16:15] That's untanable and the reason it's untanable.
[00:16:16] Chamath Palihapitiya: Yeah, explain.
[00:16:17] Chamath Palihapitiya: You have multiple facets of antitrust that can come up from any number of organizations in the United States and that's just but one part of the complexities you have to navigate because if you do business in any other country all of these other countries are in a position to a pine.
[00:16:32] Chamath Palihapitiya: Oh sure.
[00:16:32] Chamath Palihapitiya: If you think about doing a deal where you're in China and that other asset is in China it can slow down for a very very very long time and never happen for reasons that have nothing to do with the industrial logic of the merger.
[00:16:44] Chamath Palihapitiya: So I don't think you can pre-veth these things because it's not scalable and I think the government would get frustrated because you'd have a thousand people outside the door they'd have no time to do anything else.
[00:16:53] Chamath Palihapitiya: They have to govern.
[00:16:54] Chamath Palihapitiya: The different thing that we have to figure out whether it is allowed is how these deals are getting done.
[00:16:59] Chamath Palihapitiya: The only thing that I would observe is the two biggest transactions that have happened thus far this year that I've taken note of happened as total raw asset sales to work around antitrust.
[00:17:10] Chamath Palihapitiya: The best example was meta and scale AI.
[00:17:13] Chamath Palihapitiya: Okay, I'll say this thing is worth 30 billion.
[00:17:15] Chamath Palihapitiya: I'll give you 15 billion in cash.
[00:17:17] Chamath Palihapitiya: But what am I really doing?
[00:17:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: I'm carving out these assets so that I don't have to file even an HSR filing.
[00:17:23] Chamath Palihapitiya: So I think the future is that if the government has to have an opinion, not just America, but the Europeans, the Chinese,
[00:17:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: what's going to happen instead is that very smart lawyers who get paid 10, 20, 30 million dollars a year or the NBA salaries now,
[00:17:40] Chamath Palihapitiya: they're going to find workarounds.
[00:17:41] Chamath Palihapitiya: They've already done so for big tech and I think it'll spill over to other industries.
[00:17:46] Chamath Palihapitiya: You're kind of like creating these boundary conditions where I think the concept of antitrust is going to be a very difficult thing because if businesses want to be in business,
[00:17:56] you're not going to do these traditional deals.
[00:17:57] Chamath Palihapitiya: As David said, an enormous sign of confidence about how there isn't going to be a competitive threat for Paramount to just say we'll take the whole thing because they're
[00:18:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: subjecting themselves to a level of scrutiny that they wouldn't if they felt there is any shred of a good argument for competitive antitrust.
[00:18:17] I just want to address the gratuitous pot shot at President Trump.
[00:18:21] Jason Calacanis: Which one?
[00:18:22] Jason Calacanis: Well, you're claimed that he shouldn't get involved and somehow antitrust is better if the President's don't get involved.
[00:18:27] Jason Calacanis: You may remember that Teddy Roosevelt was noticed the trust buster because he directed the DOJ to sue 45 companies under the Sherman Act,
[00:18:34] Jason Calacanis: including the whole Northern securities company, his successors William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, FDR.
[00:18:41] Jason Calacanis: They were just as aggressive using antitrust.
[00:18:43] Jason Calacanis: Anyway, a lot of President's have gone involved in mergers and antitrust actions.
[00:18:49] Jason Calacanis: So it's just not that unusual.
[00:18:52] Yeah, I just think it's particularly.
[00:18:53] Jason Calacanis: That's a critique of groc.
[00:18:54] Jason Calacanis: Oh yeah, that's great.
[00:18:56] Yeah.
[00:18:56] We need to have like a groc fact check part of the show.
[00:18:58] Jason Calacanis: We need a groc fact check.
[00:19:00] David Sacks: No, the reason I would say it's problematic for Trump to get involved in it is because
[00:19:05] David Sacks: the Ellicins have also been major supporters of Trump and made commitments for buying TikTok.
[00:19:13] David Sacks: Now you have one family who is a major supporter of Trump, massive donators,
[00:19:19] basically getting the inside line on TikTok.
[00:19:22] David Sacks: And now, after it deals been closed with Netflix,
[00:19:25] David Sacks: being able to lobby to get Trump to let them buy CBS and CNN.
[00:19:30] David Sacks: So if we start thinking about the influence that Ellicin family is having on the Trump
[00:19:36] David Sacks: administration, whether it's quid probe quo or it's the appearance of quid probe quo,
[00:19:41] David Sacks: it's best for Trump to stay out of it because already we have the TikTok deal.
[00:19:45] David Sacks: Now CBS, they own and they're going to own CNN.
[00:19:49] David Sacks: This is a lot of consolidation for one family.
[00:19:52] David Sacks: That's a red herring.
[00:19:53] David Sacks: Between CBS and CNN,
[00:19:55] Chamath Palihapitiya: nine people watch those two channels.
[00:19:57] Chamath Palihapitiya: So those channels are irrelevant.
[00:19:58] Chamath Palihapitiya: Those guys have to rebuild these things from scratch.
[00:20:00] Chamath Palihapitiya: Number one, and number two, it doesn't incentivize or disincentivize
[00:20:04] Chamath Palihapitiya: three billion humans from using and watching that content.
[00:20:08] Chamath Palihapitiya: Who owns that asset is not known to any of these people.
[00:20:11] Chamath Palihapitiya: CBS did not go up and down because one person known to versus another,
[00:20:16] Chamath Palihapitiya: nobody knows who the CEO TikTok is.
[00:20:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: It's TikTok is either good or not good.
[00:20:22] Chamath Palihapitiya: And so I would just keep in mind that this is something,
[00:20:24] Chamath Palihapitiya: it's like the party circuit, Babel.
[00:20:26] Chamath Palihapitiya: Like you go there and you talk about it like, oh my god, it's so bad, it's so good.
[00:20:29] Chamath Palihapitiya: And you miss the basic fact that nothing about the ownership changes,
[00:20:34] Chamath Palihapitiya: the human incentive to use a good product and to disqualify a **** product.
[00:20:39] Maybe I would take the other side of it.
[00:20:41] David Sacks: There's still millions of people watching this and it's pretty clear that millions of people
[00:20:45] David Sacks: watch this show because it's good.
[00:20:47] David Sacks: No, no, ultimately people are, people are going to be drawn to great products.
[00:20:51] David Sacks: There's no doubt about that.
[00:20:53] David Sacks: But consolidation of the major news assets, CBS and the influence of TikTok
[00:20:59] David Sacks: and the influence of CNN is undeniable.
[00:21:02] David Sacks: That is just undeniable to you.
[00:21:04] David Sacks: Undeniable for what?
[00:21:05] Chamath Palihapitiya: Just reality.
[00:21:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: Reality.
[00:21:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: Your man of America.
[00:21:09] David Sacks: No, not my reality.
[00:21:10] David Sacks: You can try and assault me.
[00:21:10] David Sacks: That's not the point.
[00:21:11] David Sacks: It's not an insolent company.
[00:21:13] David Sacks: No, it's not my reality.
[00:21:14] David Sacks: That's not where I get my news from.
[00:21:15] David Sacks: I know.
[00:21:16] David Sacks: Millions of people don't watch CBS and CNN.
[00:21:19] Chamath Palihapitiya: It's not true.
[00:21:20] Chamath Palihapitiya: It's four million people who watch it.
[00:21:21] David Sacks: So yes, it is technically millions.
[00:21:23] David Sacks: If you're adding it all up over what a year,
[00:21:26] de-duplicated, what is what is CNN's most qualified, best run, most popular show?
[00:21:32] Chamath Palihapitiya: Okay.
[00:21:33] Chamath Palihapitiya: What is on the network or on the news?
[00:21:36] David Sacks: I don't know because I don't have it.
[00:21:37] David Sacks: I don't even have cable.
[00:21:38] Chamath Palihapitiya: Yeah, I know.
[00:21:39] Chamath Palihapitiya: You don't even know.
[00:21:40] Chamath Palihapitiya: You asked your friends to steal New York Times or I was just reading ads.
[00:21:43] David Sacks: Everybody will, I am the lead actor.
[00:21:46] Chamath Palihapitiya: You get the final word having lived inside the beast.
[00:21:50] David Sacks: Should Trump be involved in these mergers and acquisitions?
[00:21:55] David Sacks: Yes or no?
[00:21:56] David Sacks: Tucker calls me.
[00:21:58] Tucker Carlson: Well, you're not going to stop him.
[00:21:59] Tucker Carlson: So it doesn't matter.
[00:22:00] Tucker Carlson: What should we be concerned about?
[00:22:02] Tucker Carlson: It is not media monopoly power.
[00:22:04] Tucker Carlson: It's censorship of the tech platforms.
[00:22:07] Tucker Carlson: A return to that.
[00:22:09] Tucker Carlson: That is where you destroy creativity and diversity of
[00:22:13] Tucker Carlson: thought put the entire nation into the mental prison from which it escaped last November.
[00:22:19] Tucker Carlson: That's that is the threat censoring YouTube X Instagram.
[00:22:24] Tucker Carlson: And I just think we should be focused on that.
[00:22:26] Tucker Carlson: And what's your take on barri-wise taking over CBS news?
[00:22:29] David Sacks: I'm not sure if you've commented on that.
[00:22:31] David Sacks: I mean, I'm kind of impressed.
[00:22:32] David Sacks: I mean, I, you know, it's easy to make fun of barri-wise for being dumb or whatever,
[00:22:38] Tucker Carlson: which is fair.
[00:22:39] Tucker Carlson: But it's, you have to sort of look at it in reverse image and it's negative.
[00:22:44] Tucker Carlson: It's like, with those talents you got where?
[00:22:47] Tucker Carlson: You're amazing.
[00:22:48] Tucker Carlson: And I will say, I agree with that.
[00:22:50] Tucker Carlson: I think that she's charming.
[00:22:52] Tucker Carlson: She's tireless and energetic.
[00:22:55] Tucker Carlson: I don't know.
[00:22:56] Tucker Carlson: That still matters.
[00:22:57] Tucker Carlson: Like we overvalue IQ.
[00:22:58] Tucker Carlson: Oh, a person so smart.
[00:23:01] Tucker Carlson: You know, it actually doesn't matter.
[00:23:03] Tucker Carlson: Like being charming, meeting people,
[00:23:06] Tucker Carlson: you know, pushing an agenda tirelessly like that, that really works.
[00:23:09] Tucker Carlson: And in the end, the price she got is not worth having.
[00:23:13] Tucker Carlson: Like how do I to run CBS news such as it is?
[00:23:17] Tucker Carlson: No, for real.
[00:23:18] Tucker Carlson: That's torture.
[00:23:19] Tucker Carlson: They couldn't pay you enough.
[00:23:21] What would you do if you had CNN?
[00:23:22] David Sacks: They put it in your laptop and they say you forced to be CEO of it for the next 10 years.
[00:23:26] David Sacks: What would you do?
[00:23:26] David Sacks: Well, actually, I've had that conversation slightly more relevant.
[00:23:29] Tucker Carlson: What would you do if you ran my son's school newspaper?
[00:23:32] Chamath Palihapitiya: Because about the same scale.
[00:23:32] Chamath Palihapitiya: Oh, I'd get radical.
[00:23:34] Tucker Carlson: Actually Tucker had an interest in any other good questions.
[00:23:36] David Sacks: No, it's a great question.
[00:23:37] David Sacks: Tucker was about to answer it.
[00:23:38] David Sacks: Thanks for stepping on it, Chema.
[00:23:39] David Sacks: With your incredible editorial.
[00:23:40] David Sacks: Oh, and the CNN question.
[00:23:41] David Sacks: I mean, I spent almost 10 years there.
[00:23:43] Tucker Carlson: So I feel like I'm familiar with it.
[00:23:45] Tucker Carlson: Yeah.
[00:23:46] Tucker Carlson: I have, you know, I actually had this conversation with someone.
[00:23:49] Tucker Carlson: I was like, we should buy CNN and you should run it.
[00:23:51] Tucker Carlson: And so I had caused to spend like an evening thinking about it and no way.
[00:23:56] Tucker Carlson: I mean, first of all, I'm with Chema.
[00:23:58] Tucker Carlson: Like I don't have a New York Times or Washington Post or New York of subscription anymore
[00:24:02] Tucker Carlson: after a lifetime of having all three.
[00:24:04] Tucker Carlson: Because they're totally relevant.
[00:24:06] Tucker Carlson: They mean nothing.
[00:24:07] Tucker Carlson: They're speaking to no one.
[00:24:08] Tucker Carlson: And there's a kind of musty.
[00:24:10] Tucker Carlson: It's like going back to your childhood home and seeing that your bedroom was really small.
[00:24:13] Tucker Carlson: And like the paint was actually turquoise and all these kind of sad posters from the 80s
[00:24:18] Tucker Carlson: are still there.
[00:24:19] Tucker Carlson: Oh, it's depressing.
[00:24:20] Tucker Carlson: Like I would just shut it down and build something new.
[00:24:23] Tucker Carlson: Okay.
[00:24:23] Tucker Carlson: Shut it down.
[00:24:24] Chamath Palihapitiya: Jason, can I give you my one thought exercise about the New York Times?
[00:24:28] Chamath Palihapitiya: The one thing that I think is worth talking about the New York Times is
[00:24:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: I think they will in the next five years.
[00:24:34] Do something so egregious and over the line akin to some sort of libel or some sort of
[00:24:40] Chamath Palihapitiya: statement that it turned out to be completely false.
[00:24:42] Chamath Palihapitiya: They will get sued.
[00:24:43] Chamath Palihapitiya: And I hope when that settlement happens, the person says, I do not want to get paid the four
[00:24:48] Chamath Palihapitiya: billion dollars.
[00:24:50] Chamath Palihapitiya: I want this to be turned in kind into a nonprofit and into a public trust and then shuts it down.
[00:24:58] Interesting.
[00:24:59] David Sacks: Kind of what happened with Fox when they did their 700, 800 million dollar settlement.
[00:25:04] David Sacks: The largest one.
[00:25:05] David Sacks: But the next one will go up.
[00:25:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: It won't be that scale because you've had now that that precedent, that's a very important
[00:25:11] Chamath Palihapitiya: precedent about the scale of lying and misrepresenting things.
[00:25:15] Chamath Palihapitiya: And it only goes up from here.
[00:25:16] Chamath Palihapitiya: This is one way ratchet.
[00:25:17] Chamath Palihapitiya: Yeah, you couldn't be more wrong about that.
[00:25:19] David Sacks: It's definitely not going to happen.
[00:25:21] David Sacks: They have controls in place.
[00:25:22] David Sacks: But it's a nice fantasy.
[00:25:24] David Sacks: They're also crushing it.
[00:25:24] David Sacks: By the way, when they move to subscriptions, they have 12 million paid subscribers now.
[00:25:28] David Sacks: They are objectively crushing it and figured out better than any other news organization.
[00:25:33] David Sacks: Whether we agree or disagree with their content and the quality of it, they are the most
[00:25:37] David Sacks: successful objectively here in America.
[00:25:40] David Sacks: All right, speaking of successful and taking over the dialogue, we've got to talk about
[00:25:45] David Sacks: Nick Fuente.
[00:25:45] David Sacks: So you just add on your podcast, Tucker.
[00:25:49] You platformed him.
[00:25:54] David Sacks: I created him.
[00:25:55] David Sacks: Basically, I was a interesting discussion for those of you who don't know,
[00:25:59] David Sacks: Nick Fuente's and have been living under a rock.
[00:26:02] David Sacks: He's a 27 year old white nationalist with a very popular show on rumble about 500,000 subscribers.
[00:26:08] David Sacks: Which isn't actually that big when you think about it.
[00:26:10] David Sacks: His followers call themselves grippers.
[00:26:14] And he's gained hundreds of thousands over the past six months.
[00:26:17] David Sacks: He's on quite a heater.
[00:26:19] David Sacks: And he's got a bunch of controversial opinions.
[00:26:23] I'll just give you the quotes.
[00:26:24] David Sacks: This is nothing to do with my opinion on him.
[00:26:26] David Sacks: He was asked by Pierce Morgan.
[00:26:28] David Sacks: If he described himself as a racist and he said totally, I think everybody if we're being honest
[00:26:33] David Sacks: is racist.
[00:26:34] David Sacks: The only people that aren't racist or pretend not to be are white people
[00:26:39] David Sacks: to their detriment on women.
[00:26:41] David Sacks: Pierce asked Nick if he was gay.
[00:26:42] David Sacks: Nick said, no, but I will say women are very difficult to be around.
[00:26:46] David Sacks: Pierce then asked.
[00:26:48] David Sacks: And do you think they should have the right to vote?
[00:26:50] David Sacks: Nick said, I do not absolutely not.
[00:26:52] David Sacks: On Israel, Fwentess is very critical.
[00:26:56] David Sacks: And what he calls organized jury in America.
[00:27:01] David Sacks: So now you interviewed him.
[00:27:04] Couple of different ways to take this.
[00:27:05] David Sacks: But you did a good job of telling his origin story.
[00:27:08] David Sacks: It was part of Prager You.
[00:27:09] David Sacks: He's got this really activated base.
[00:27:13] David Sacks: Why is he resonating at this moment in time?
[00:27:17] David Sacks: And maybe you could explain to the audience
[00:27:21] David Sacks: MAGA versus America first, America only.
[00:27:24] David Sacks: Which I think you're part of America first.
[00:27:26] David Sacks: But you tell us because I think these are just terms right now.
[00:27:30] David Sacks: They're not like political parties right now.
[00:27:32] David Sacks: Well, there's a struggle over what those terms mean.
[00:27:35] Tucker Carlson: It's very ugly and probably necessary because you need to define terms.
[00:27:40] Tucker Carlson: Like that's the first thing you do, I would say.
[00:27:42] Tucker Carlson: When you think through what you should be doing with your life, for example.
[00:27:45] Tucker Carlson: So as for Fwentess, his origin story is a little more precise and I'll keep it short.
[00:27:50] Tucker Carlson: But he tweeted something as a freshman at BU,
[00:27:55] Tucker Carlson: critical of pretty mildly critical of the Congress for doing the bidding of this foreign country
[00:28:00] Tucker Carlson: Israel. And somehow Ben Shapiro saw that and attacked him and tried to get him kicked out of
[00:28:06] Tucker Carlson: his Republican club and made sure he didn't get an internship with some conservative organization.
[00:28:11] And I'm not talking Ben Shapiro.
[00:28:13] Tucker Carlson: But that kind of tells you what attempts to shut people down to shut conversations down
[00:28:19] Tucker Carlson: result in. They don't go away. They just faster in the darkness.
[00:28:25] Tucker Carlson: And they can sometimes become really ugly.
[00:28:27] Tucker Carlson: So what Fwentess is among other, well, first of all, Fwentess is saying a lot of true things.
[00:28:30] Tucker Carlson: That's why he's popular. He's funny. He's smart.
[00:28:34] But he's a good really.
[00:28:36] Tucker Carlson: Really? Yeah. He's a great broadcaster.
[00:28:38] Tucker Carlson: But Fwentess on some macro level is troubling because his platform is an expression of something
[00:28:46] Tucker Carlson: that has kind of taken over all political discourse, which is identity politics, tribalism.
[00:28:51] Tucker Carlson: And I'm just opposed to that. I period and always will be.
[00:28:54] Tucker Carlson: And I just think that we're governed by universal principles or we're governed by the mafia.
[00:28:59] Tucker Carlson: Those are our choices. And so you know, our principles have to apply to every human being,
[00:29:04] Tucker Carlson: or certainly every American citizen, period, or they're not principles.
[00:29:08] Tucker Carlson: They're just justification for tyranny.
[00:29:11] Tucker Carlson: So Fwentess has a different kind of identity politics, but there are all kinds of different
[00:29:16] Tucker Carlson: identity politics. We lived under it during the Biden years. We've lived under it most of my life,
[00:29:20] Tucker Carlson: actually, in one form or another. And so if anything, Fwentess reminds us that we have to come up with
[00:29:25] Tucker Carlson: some kind of principle that every American can ascribe to, something called national identity,
[00:29:32] Tucker Carlson: that is not a dirty phrase that's actually necessary to keep the country from disintegrating,
[00:29:37] Tucker Carlson: come up which it is. So like, what is every American, all 350 million have in common with every
[00:29:43] Tucker Carlson: other? And that's the conversation we need to have. And in its absence, then we get a lot of people
[00:29:47] Tucker Carlson: popping up and being like, well, all white people are over here and all black people are
[00:29:50] Tucker Carlson: Jewish people or whatever. That's not going to work. That will end in violence. Everyone knows that.
[00:29:57] Tucker Carlson: And so now is probably a pretty good time to figure out what we all have in common. I didn't
[00:30:03] Tucker Carlson: platform him. I, first of all, platform is not a verb. And anyone who says it is a verb is probably
[00:30:09] Tucker Carlson: opposed to my court interests, I would say. And you have a conversation with language.
[00:30:14] Yeah, I interviewed him. I interviewed everybody, you know, and my general belief is you should
[00:30:19] Tucker Carlson: let people say what they think and others can decide whether they mean it or not, whether they're
[00:30:22] Tucker Carlson: being false or sincere and what they think of what the person is saying. But that's my job. I'm
[00:30:26] Tucker Carlson: not ashamed of it. Despite a lot of efforts to make me ashamed of it. I do disagree with Fuentes
[00:30:31] Tucker Carlson: on the question of universal principles. I think it's in, well, first of all, it's against my
[00:30:36] Tucker Carlson: religion to hate any group. And I told him that. But I didn't do a lot of other posturing design to
[00:30:42] Tucker Carlson: make me seem like, you know, the good person peers, unfortunately fell into that trap as an older man.
[00:30:47] Tucker Carlson: You know, well, isn't it you are bad? And it's like, okay, I don't even disagree with some of that.
[00:30:52] Tucker Carlson: But you don't elevate yourself. You look like an out of touch buffoon. And that's exactly the trap
[00:30:59] Tucker Carlson: that was awaiting Kieres Morgan. And if you watch that interview and if you watch the reaction to it,
[00:31:03] Tucker Carlson: that did not diminish Nick Fuentes in any way. It enhanced Nick Fuentes. What diminishes Nick Fuentes
[00:31:09] Tucker Carlson: is asking him straightforward questions, particularly about women, not have you had sex with anybody.
[00:31:14] Tucker Carlson: But like, why use some matter women? And that, you know, letting people talk a lot reveals who
[00:31:20] Tucker Carlson: they are. That's just true. Sorry. If you were to give the top two or three reasons why he's resonating
[00:31:26] David Sacks: with it seems like young man. And this Ameri, this burgeoning American first movement, which I
[00:31:33] David Sacks: guess would be good for you to define right now, especially you can recognize it. You're not the
[00:31:38] David Sacks: leader of it, but you have said, I think you this concept is, you know, resonates with you. So
[00:31:46] David Sacks: maybe why talk, why is Fuentes resonating? And what is America first versus maggot?
[00:31:52] David Sacks: Like, explain that. Just in reverse order. I mean, I would argue that the premise of maggot is
[00:31:58] Tucker Carlson: America first, but I wouldn't say that America first is a movement. I would say it's the only
[00:32:02] Tucker Carlson: legitimate reason to run a government. And it's very simple. The government of your democratic
[00:32:09] Tucker Carlson: republic ought to act in broad terms on behalf of its own citizens. I mean, it's not more complicated
[00:32:14] Tucker Carlson: than that. There's nothing sinister about it. In fact, anything other than that is sinister,
[00:32:19] Tucker Carlson: because it's illegitimate for what other reason would you run a democratic republic and treasonous?
[00:32:24] Tucker Carlson: There isn't one actually. So of course, this has to be an America. You could think of a new name
[00:32:30] Tucker Carlson: for it if that name makes you uncomfortable. But the idea has to be the reason we have a government
[00:32:35] Tucker Carlson: or else we have to get rid of the government because there's no other justification for having
[00:32:41] Tucker Carlson: a government. Okay. So A, B, why is he popular? Because he says that. But I would say more broadly
[00:32:47] Tucker Carlson: because he's defiant. There's a kind of up yours, buddy. I can't say that. Okay, watch this. I will.
[00:32:53] Tucker Carlson: He's hilarious. He seems steadfast and strong. I don't think he is. He's not even married.
[00:33:00] Tucker Carlson: So like, if you're afraid of girls, I think you're a was. That's my personal view. But there is a,
[00:33:06] Tucker Carlson: but in his defiance, people see something really appealing. Why wouldn't they? You know,
[00:33:11] Tucker Carlson: you know, these are kids who've grown up in a world of hectoring and telling them they're bad
[00:33:15] Tucker Carlson: because of how they were born. And Nick Fuentes has just raised in the middle finger to the people
[00:33:19] Tucker Carlson: saying that and saying up yours. And who wouldn't love that? Of course, this will love that.
[00:33:24] Tucker Carlson: Second piece of the American first is America only. And I guess that, I don't know what that
[00:33:30] David Sacks: means. That's it. No, of course, it's, look, we work in concert with others by definition.
[00:33:35] Tucker Carlson: It's a globalized economy. You know, maybe it shouldn't be, but it is. But America only that argument,
[00:33:41] Tucker Carlson: in the sense, it's not really an argument. It's like a counter slogan designed to undercut the main
[00:33:46] Tucker Carlson: argument. Isn't doesn't really mean it. No one is arguing that. It's just saying, look,
[00:33:51] Tucker Carlson: the US government ought to act on behalf of its own citizens to which people who don't believe
[00:33:56] Tucker Carlson: that, who are embarrassed to explain why they don't believe it because there's no justification
[00:34:00] Tucker Carlson: for not believing that. Well, you're America only. No, the government should do that. Every part of
[00:34:07] Tucker Carlson: the government should have that foremost in mind. How does this help the people who pay for this,
[00:34:11] Tucker Carlson: in whose name it's done? Like, again, even calling an amusement drives me bonkers because,
[00:34:16] Tucker Carlson: compared to what? Some sort of creepy, creepy secret of oligarchy, which we've had most of my life,
[00:34:21] Tucker Carlson: like, that's just bad. There's no way to defend that. And we can argue within the framework of
[00:34:26] Tucker Carlson: America first, how to put America first. That's a totally legitimate argument. And there are all
[00:34:31] Tucker Carlson: kinds of different thoughts about that. But what the motive should be, the goal should be, there's no
[00:34:37] Tucker Carlson: debate. It has to be for American citizens, primarily, if they're, you know, ancillary beneficiaries.
[00:34:42] Tucker Carlson: That's great. Not against that at all. Let's help everyone if we can. But the point is to help
[00:34:47] Tucker Carlson: the people who own the country, the shareholders of the United States, who are American citizens.
[00:34:53] Tucker Carlson: There's no other point. Is there? Shama, let me bring you in on this from the angle of the
[00:34:58] David Sacks: America first movement, America only movement, as a reaction to the first year of the Trump
[00:35:03] David Sacks: administration feeling too. Many people in the Republican Party as benefiting maybe,
[00:35:09] David Sacks: tech oligarchs, billionaires, international issues, more than the working man, you have started
[00:35:16] David Sacks: to tweet a little bit and become vocal about, hey, maybe you're two of the Trump administration,
[00:35:21] David Sacks: we got to get refocused on some of these things. Unpack that for us in the audience.
[00:35:27] Chamath Palihapitiya: Well, can I offer my feedback on Fuentes first? Of course, yes. Go with Fuentes, if you like.
[00:35:32] David Sacks: There's a couple points I want to make. The first is that he is, as Tucker said,
[00:35:37] Chamath Palihapitiya: charismatic. I think he's funny. And I think that he can animate around a lot of touchy subjects
[00:35:45] Chamath Palihapitiya: and say things that have shock value. And I think in that what he is is actually like a modern
[00:35:50] Chamath Palihapitiya: shock shock. He's like a younger Howard Stern. He's the Howard Stern of this era. The way that Howard
[00:35:55] Chamath Palihapitiya: Stern was in that era, unlistenable to so many people because he would be kind of okay for 80%
[00:36:02] Chamath Palihapitiya: of the time and then go totally off the rails and you think, man, this guy is some combination of
[00:36:06] Chamath Palihapitiya: mean nuts, crazy. And then you throw out all these other adjectives. So that's point number one.
[00:36:13] Chamath Palihapitiya: Point number two is it is true that the longer you allow him to speak actually, the more you
[00:36:19] Chamath Palihapitiya: understand what he thinks. And as a result, the quality of the product will dictate the scale of
[00:36:25] Chamath Palihapitiya: adoption. And now this is where I think the media yet again has been very sloppy and doesn't do
[00:36:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: their work, which is and Nick, you can throw this up. There's been a lot of research on what has
[00:36:36] Chamath Palihapitiya: been happening in the last few months. And the bottom line takeaway in the last few months is that
[00:36:42] Chamath Palihapitiya: there is a coordinated effort of individual largely unverified accounts in social media.
[00:36:50] Chamath Palihapitiya: They typically emanate from India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria. And there is a coordinated
[00:36:57] Chamath Palihapitiya: amplification process that is happening around this content. And in this chart that you're seeing,
[00:37:04] Chamath Palihapitiya: it's just a comparison of Nick in the first 30 minutes to what people like Elon get in the first
[00:37:11] Chamath Palihapitiya: 30 minutes of him posting. Now, why that's so important is you start to see this huge disparity,
[00:37:17] Chamath Palihapitiya: where even though you have the most viral person in account in the world, i.e. at Elon Musk on X,
[00:37:23] Chamath Palihapitiya: what you see is him completely crushing and dominating the virality in the beginning of his content
[00:37:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: creation versus anybody else's. And then there's a bunch of other charts, Nick, you can retweet a
[00:37:37] Chamath Palihapitiya: link to this. It starts to show a pattern where there is a coordinated effort to amplify. I think
[00:37:43] Chamath Palihapitiya: that's why we're having the Nick Flentes moment at this point in time. The New York Times,
[00:37:49] Chamath Palihapitiya: all of a sudden sees this information, probably doesn't bother to do the diligence, has a bunch
[00:37:55] Chamath Palihapitiya: of positive mentions, starts to pump him up as a leader of some kind of nefarious, crazy scary rebellion.
[00:38:05] Well, no, they want a mainstream him. And they want to try to mainstream him. So what you see is
[00:38:09] Chamath Palihapitiya: the New York Times trying to mainstream this guy and make him credible. So as to paint the right,
[00:38:14] Chamath Palihapitiya: as a bunch of evil racist ideologues, I think the producers at Peer's Morgan didn't understand
[00:38:20] Chamath Palihapitiya: this was happening. And so when you put him on a 20 minute sound bite shot, get feeds in to
[00:38:26] Chamath Palihapitiya: exactly what makes him popular, the ability to land these small sound bites. This is why I think
[00:38:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: Tucker's was much better because again, in multi-hour programming, you can't hide. You see the
[00:38:36] Chamath Palihapitiya: full facet of what the person is and you start to understand that this is a very savvy young media
[00:38:42] Chamath Palihapitiya: personality. Now, when you strip away all of this amplification, the product has to work for it
[00:38:49] Chamath Palihapitiya: to scale and grow. There is no way that you're going to manifest average normal men and women
[00:38:54] Chamath Palihapitiya: spending their time to take these views credibly unless it's good and right. There will be a moment
[00:39:01] Chamath Palihapitiya: in time where curiosity will cause you to say, why is everybody talking about this? We are firmly
[00:39:06] Chamath Palihapitiya: in that moment. But I think that there is a large portion of what he says, which I don't know
[00:39:12] Chamath Palihapitiya: whether he believes or not because I haven't spent that much time, but he's meant to shock. It's meant
[00:39:16] Chamath Palihapitiya: to catalyze and animate people, but I don't think it's sustainable because the views themselves are
[00:39:22] Chamath Palihapitiya: repugnant. This is why the New York Times wants to elevate him. Can you put it up there?
[00:39:30] So there I am. I look like a guy in that picture. I look like a slack jog yokel and he looks like
[00:39:39] double with the cause. It's Chad Klampert versus James Dean. The other thing I'll say is that
[00:39:46] Chamath Palihapitiya: Saxon, I earn a couple of these group chats with some folks and some of the chatter there is that
[00:39:52] who is paying for and who is activating all of these bots and fake accounts in all of these developing
[00:39:58] Chamath Palihapitiya: world countries? And why did they pick him? Some of that conspiracy basically points to a handful
[00:40:03] Chamath Palihapitiya: of nations who would love to foment that kind of dissent and that kind of KOS and uprisings.
[00:40:09] David Sacks: I mean, this has been clear for a long time. So I think it's very important from here on out that
[00:40:14] Chamath Palihapitiya: if people are to listen to him, I think the longer form content exposes what he really thinks so
[00:40:20] Chamath Palihapitiya: that you can judge it for yourself. But I would not discount the fact that this moment is happening
[00:40:26] Chamath Palihapitiya: is not entirely organic. There is a deep, inorganic effort to put this on the front page of the news.
[00:40:34] Chamath Palihapitiya: And so it's up to traditional media to decide whether they're going to basically lift this guy up
[00:40:40] Chamath Palihapitiya: has some kind of newfound hero or call it out for what it is, which is lead in the articles
[00:40:45] Chamath Palihapitiya: with this data, which is widely available and easy to get. Well, he literally explained this when
[00:40:51] David Sacks: he was on Tucker's podcast. He was originally in college part of this Prager U kind of movement.
[00:40:58] David Sacks: And he said he was in a Facebook group, which was the Prager Army. And I've talked about this
[00:41:03] David Sacks: before. We've joked about it. But there are groups like the one you mentioned that you're in
[00:41:08] David Sacks: this group. I heard about it a couple of hundred right wing folks of note. Take it easy, just my
[00:41:13] David Sacks: invite and get got lost apparently to it. But yeah, I had me to that group, please. But what happens
[00:41:18] David Sacks: in these groups, some of them are designed to make money, some of them designed to make impact.
[00:41:23] David Sacks: Andrew Tate had one where there was an affiliate scheme put up for it when Twitter started
[00:41:28] David Sacks: sharing revenue with accounts. And you start looking at these like accounts that are anonymous,
[00:41:33] David Sacks: but get to massive scale can go with the great. You're talking about the clip for me. Yeah. And
[00:41:39] David Sacks: they're regurgitating stuff. They're doing it for the money. Obviously, they're making 10, 20 grand
[00:41:43] David Sacks: a month becomes a full time job to do that. But we've caught the Russians. We've caught the Chinese.
[00:41:48] Everybody in between doing this kind of pumping. And then there is the actual army. So he,
[00:41:53] David Sacks: Nick Fuentes has an army of young people who do this. And they're on VPNs and they flood comments.
[00:41:59] David Sacks: And what they do is they share a clip and you can experience this in your own social media,
[00:42:03] David Sacks: if you're of note, because you'll have 10 posts get X number of replies. And then all of a sudden,
[00:42:08] David Sacks: the 11th gets 10 times that all at the same time directly to it, not from your followers. And that's
[00:42:14] David Sacks: when they get shared on these group chats. By the way, we should mention just tangentially because I
[00:42:19] Chamath Palihapitiya: want to get Tucker's take on this. But Australia just passed a law that under 16. You're now not a lot
[00:42:24] Chamath Palihapitiya: to use social media, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, all bent until you turn 16. And in part, Jason,
[00:42:29] Chamath Palihapitiya: I think it's because these coordinated myths and disinformation or amplification campaigns are
[00:42:34] Chamath Palihapitiya: on all kinds of characters, not just Nick. They're proliferating because to your point, the economics
[00:42:39] Chamath Palihapitiya: creates an incentive. If nothing else, then there's obviously the state level sponsored chaos that
[00:42:43] Chamath Palihapitiya: it tries to sow. And one of the only high level bits that you can flip is to say under a certain age,
[00:42:49] Chamath Palihapitiya: we're just going to minimize how much of this content you get exposed to because we don't know
[00:42:53] Chamath Palihapitiya: what it is. Before we go there, can I just say the one thing on America first, America only? Whatever
[00:42:57] Chamath Palihapitiya: these terms are, I don't know what they are. America first, America only. I don't know what they
[00:43:01] Chamath Palihapitiya: are. These are its slogans, anti slogans. Here's what I will say. I think it's very important. And I
[00:43:05] Chamath Palihapitiya: speak as an immigrant. I want to be American. I don't consider myself Canadian American. I don't
[00:43:13] Chamath Palihapitiya: consider myself Sri Lankan, Canadian American. I consider myself American. I want to absorb and I
[00:43:20] Chamath Palihapitiya: want to reflect the values of this country. I want to know and be able to talk to you about the
[00:43:25] Chamath Palihapitiya: constitution of this country. I want to be able to celebrate the cultural heritage of this country.
[00:43:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: That's part of the contact that I think I'm making. And I do think that's an important thing that
[00:43:36] Chamath Palihapitiya: we have all lost, where we have to run around in all of our traditional garb and it just loses
[00:43:42] Chamath Palihapitiya: that what makes countries great is a shared set of principles and values. And we have to find a
[00:43:50] Chamath Palihapitiya: way of doing that. When I immigrated from Canada, what I will tell you is Canada took the
[00:43:55] Chamath Palihapitiya: opposite view. We used to call America a melting pot, pejoratively, even in textbooks.
[00:44:02] And the textbooks would call Canada a toss salad. And we would celebrate that that form of multiculturalism
[00:44:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: was better. But when you fast forward the clock 20 years, all it did was create confusion. For example,
[00:44:13] Chamath Palihapitiya: if you go to school in Canada, there's like a bajillion holidays. Every culture gets their day off
[00:44:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: and then all of a sudden what happens, the kids don't get educated because you have to have
[00:44:22] Chamath Palihapitiya: every long tail country get recognized in some way, shape, or form. All of a sudden you lose
[00:44:26] Chamath Palihapitiya: this very standard form of basic organization. That's just but one example. You know, the forms
[00:44:32] Chamath Palihapitiya: are in 50 languages. All that does is create chaos. It should have been in English and French,
[00:44:36] Chamath Palihapitiya: because those are the two official languages of the country. All of that in direction,
[00:44:41] Chamath Palihapitiya: trying to celebrate everybody's heritage confuses and slows that country down. And you can see it in
[00:44:46] Chamath Palihapitiya: the GDP. You can see it in the FDI for indirect investment. You can see it. So the one thing that we
[00:44:53] Chamath Palihapitiya: have to agree is that there is an American culture instead of values and we should not lose it.
[00:44:58] Chamath Palihapitiya: And we should ask the people that want to be here to embrace it. We all embrace it. Saxon
[00:45:01] Chamath Palihapitiya: embraced it. If you talk to Sax's parents, Dave embraced it. If you talk to freeberg,
[00:45:06] Chamath Palihapitiya: freeberg's parents, we all came from different countries, but we are fundamentally American.
[00:45:10] Chamath Palihapitiya: Jake Al, I wasn't sure, but were you intimating that the party behind Nick Fuentes'
[00:45:18] Jason Calacanis: meteoric success is the Russians? No, no, I'm just saying that there's brigade going on.
[00:45:25] Jason Calacanis: Which foreign actor do you think it is? You know, some of them just want to create chaos. I put
[00:45:29] David Sacks: Russia in that just creating division in America, distracts Americans. I think they like that.
[00:45:35] But there are three levels of this. There's his army. Fuentes does have an army of super fans
[00:45:41] who are disaffected young men. And there's a reason why they're disaffected. It's hard to get jobs.
[00:45:46] David Sacks: It's impossible to get a home. Healthcare. They've seen people go bankrupt because of healthcare.
[00:45:52] David Sacks: If you look at healthcare homes and education, those are the three most important things we have to
[00:45:56] David Sacks: fix in America. That's why young people are disaffected. And when you're disaffected as a youth
[00:46:02] David Sacks: and somebody starts blaming the Jews, the blacks, the Hispanics, the border, this issue, that
[00:46:08] David Sacks: issue, it's really appealing because then you don't have to take any personal responsibility for it.
[00:46:13] David Sacks: And it is, in fact, really hard to own a home in most cities in America.
[00:46:17] David Sacks: Unless you move to Texas or, you know, Nashville, Florida. And then there's too many homes. And
[00:46:21] David Sacks: prices are going down. And he's a kid and he says stupid stuff. But he says he does tap into that
[00:46:28] David Sacks: disaffectedness. Where would you put it if you rang to Tucker since you are pretty plugged into
[00:46:35] David Sacks: this? Is Fuentes's popularity based on the roipers and this like really inside group of people
[00:46:42] David Sacks: who are amplifying him? Is it what he's saying? Or is it like some foreign actors promoting him?
[00:46:49] David Sacks: How would you hand to Cap his massive popularity and then we'll move on?
[00:46:53] David Sacks: All three play a role, I would say. And if you want to know who is primarily responsible for
[00:46:59] Tucker Carlson: amplifying him, consider who benefits. If you wanted to discredit America first, say, foreign policy,
[00:47:04] Tucker Carlson: then you would put it in the mouth of someone who is pro-Hitler. Of course. Anytime I hear someone
[00:47:10] Tucker Carlson: endorsing Hitler, I love Hitler. Then I'm like, you know, the Fed alarm goes off or the
[00:47:15] Tucker Carlson: inorganic alarm goes off. Right? Exactly. He is the product of a system that the rest of us
[00:47:24] Tucker Carlson: tolerated and certain among us created. And we shouldn't be surprised. You know, if you have
[00:47:29] Tucker Carlson: identity politics, at some point you're going to get white identity politics. I think I wrote a
[00:47:33] Tucker Carlson: book about this almost 10 years ago, which was totally ignored. But that's inevitable. It's inevitable.
[00:47:39] Tucker Carlson: And so to fix it, it's not a matter of censoring Nick Fuentes or anyone who likes Nick Fuentes.
[00:47:46] Tucker Carlson: It's a matter of deracializing our society and making it a fair society where rewards or condemnation
[00:47:54] Tucker Carlson: are not given on the basis of your DNA. Like, you can't have that and hope to avoid a Rwanda.
[00:48:01] Tucker Carlson: Because it's just going to happen. It's inevitable. Tribalism is the threat to every society.
[00:48:06] Tucker Carlson: And I don't know how we lost sight of that. But it's a fed.
[00:48:12] David Sacks: People are sort of saying, he's a fed. He's accusing you of being a fed.
[00:48:15] David Sacks: You know, I don't know. There's the whole Fed convert. I unfortunately, so he's such a long
[00:48:21] Tucker Carlson: side. I won't even bore you with it. But he attacked my father at one point. So I got baited into it.
[00:48:25] Tucker Carlson: And I called him a fed. You know, I don't know. But I do know that there are, and I think that
[00:48:32] Tucker Carlson: Fuentes is prime. Let me just be clear. I think he's primarily successful because of his talents
[00:48:37] Tucker Carlson: and because of the obvious truth behind some of what he is saying. It's just true. Right? The
[00:48:43] Tucker Carlson: government of this country or any country should act on behalf of its own citizens and hours doesn't.
[00:48:48] Tucker Carlson: And that's an outrage. So, okay, that's just true. But the white identity politics part of it,
[00:48:53] Tucker Carlson: once again, is inevitable. Identity politics will give birth to white identity politics. Why
[00:48:58] Tucker Carlson: wouldn't it? And you're a tough effort to stamp it out. We'll never work because there's two
[00:49:02] Tucker Carlson: hypocritical. So the only way to fix that, if you don't like it, is to eliminate all identity
[00:49:09] Tucker Carlson: politics, which we should do tonight because it's the road to disaster. That's it.
[00:49:13] Tucker Carlson: I have an AI question for Tucker. I'm increasingly surprised by the number of people on the right
[00:49:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: who I would describe as ardent free market, low regulation to no regulation folks who
[00:49:28] Chamath Palihapitiya: are very anti-AI. And I'm just curious, where do you think that comes from? And what do you think?
[00:49:38] It comes from, so far as I can tell, the perception that the risks outweigh the benefits.
[00:49:44] Tucker Carlson: So the risks would include massive job loss, chaos where nobody knows if anything is real and
[00:49:52] Tucker Carlson: the fabric of reality itself begins to tear. Of course, the massive energy draw and the huge
[00:50:00] Tucker Carlson: and expensive infrastructure changes that will require the disruption that will inevitably cause.
[00:50:07] Tucker Carlson: So the downsides are super obvious, not even to mention the potential this gets completely
[00:50:11] Tucker Carlson: away from us and eats us or something, okay? As weighed against the potential benefits which are what?
[00:50:18] Tucker Carlson: And I don't doubt that there are some coming to faster diagnostic conclusions in medicine
[00:50:28] Tucker Carlson: or getting rid of tedious tasks that don't want to do, elimination of clerical work, etc.
[00:50:33] Tucker Carlson: I guess those are upsides, but it's disproportionate. In the view of most people,
[00:50:38] Tucker Carlson: I think, who are experts in this, not daily involved in it, the risks far outweigh not just the
[00:50:45] Tucker Carlson: upsides, but the announced upsides. So typically when we roll out a new product, we tell the people
[00:50:50] Tucker Carlson: we hope to buy it, like this is going to be amazing. It's going to blow you away. Everything about
[00:50:54] Tucker Carlson: your life will be better once you get the iPhone 27 or whatever. There's been none of that with AI,
[00:51:00] Tucker Carlson: like none. The announcement has been holy s**t. This is going to change everything. Stop.
[00:51:06] Tucker Carlson: How exactly? Well, it just is. I mean, I don't know, who's in charge of the marketing for this?
[00:51:12] Tucker Carlson: Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. David. David. David.
[00:51:19] Well, what's this? Can I just follow up on this? Okay. So Tucker, here's just a thought exercise and
[00:51:25] Chamath Palihapitiya: just tell me how this factors into that opinion if it should at all. So let's say in a world in 10
[00:51:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: years where you have these super intelligent computers and systems and models. Okay.
[00:51:37] Okay. In my thinking, what that does is it reorders the geopolitics of all countries in the world
[00:51:44] Chamath Palihapitiya: where you're in one of three buckets in bucket number one, you're an exporter of that intelligence.
[00:51:52] Chamath Palihapitiya: And I think right now steady state, it's going to be China and America. China will have one version
[00:51:58] Chamath Palihapitiya: of exported intelligence and we will have one version of exported intelligence. Then there'll be
[00:52:03] Chamath Palihapitiya: these strategic partner countries of which I suspect there's less than 10.
[00:52:09] Who are the enablers, the facilitators, they have specialized skills that wrap either the Chinese
[00:52:14] Chamath Palihapitiya: version or the American version with energy, with money, with no how, etc. And then I think
[00:52:20] Chamath Palihapitiya: there's everybody else and it almost creates this thing where if you are an importer of intelligence
[00:52:25] Chamath Palihapitiya: in the future, you theoretically are at risk of becoming essentially a vassal state.
[00:52:28] Chamath Palihapitiya: And so if you think about it at that level, isn't AI something that is almost existential that
[00:52:36] Chamath Palihapitiya: we must win? I mean, for sure, I mean, at that level, for sure, and I would just point out that
[00:52:41] Tucker Carlson: like almost every single state in the world is already a vassal state. So like no change there. But
[00:52:46] Tucker Carlson: yeah, I mean, you don't want to be the wrong side of it. That's clear. Is it containable to
[00:52:50] Tucker Carlson: nation states? That's not clear to be honest to me at all. But whatever I get the argument,
[00:52:55] Tucker Carlson: I'm just saying at the consumer level, no one has explained why we should be excited about this.
[00:53:01] Tucker Carlson: And if I, you know, I'm a gold buyer and ammo buyer and freeze-strike food buyers already told you.
[00:53:06] Tucker Carlson: So it doesn't kind of affect me as an investment matter. But like just I think it would be, so I
[00:53:12] Tucker Carlson: don't have a good. Yeah, the evidence is David end of AI is not clear. Like it's like the positive
[00:53:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: average person to the average person. You are a hundred percent correct Tucker on this. We have
[00:53:23] David Sacks: done a terrible job as an industry. But what's the answer? What's the answer? Like how is this
[00:53:27] David Sacks: great for me? It'll wind up being great for you because the prices of goods and services will
[00:53:34] David Sacks: get much lower. You'll live much longer. And I was I'm not saying this is mine, but this is what
[00:53:39] David Sacks: the industry should be saying. The price of education is going to go down 80 or 90%. You're going to
[00:53:43] David Sacks: have customized adaptable education versus, you know, paying for $50,000 a year degrees. You're
[00:53:50] David Sacks: going to be able to learn anything in half the time at 90% less. All of these deliveries coming
[00:53:56] David Sacks: to your home are going to be delivered at half the price twice as fast because it's going to be in
[00:54:01] David Sacks: a drone or it's going to be in a self-driving car. And we're going to make breakthroughs in healthcare
[00:54:05] David Sacks: that will reduce suffering. And you will not die of cancer. You're going to live to 120. We will
[00:54:11] David Sacks: have job displacement. But we believe the lower cost of living and the greater services that are
[00:54:18] David Sacks: going to be available to you in healthcare and education will make up for that. And if it doesn't,
[00:54:24] we're going to put in ways to pace out the job displacement. In China, they're doing this. In China,
[00:54:30] David Sacks: they're proposing and Saxon President Trump, the amazing President Trump, will be doing an AI
[00:54:37] David Sacks: national edict soon, I believe, or an executive order. But in China, in Wuhan, paradoxically,
[00:54:43] David Sacks: they are talking about giving out licenses to self-driving cars in a paced rollout so that young
[00:54:51] David Sacks: men don't lose their jobs on mass, which is what we're about to see in America. And if we don't
[00:54:57] David Sacks: take this into account, and the great czar will speak in a moment, that's when this will become,
[00:55:02] David Sacks: I think, the worst nightmare that you're talking about, the dystopian version of this. We need to
[00:55:08] David Sacks: figure out healthcare, homes, and education, and make those free, close to free, and do a Manhattan
[00:55:15] David Sacks: project on creating 10 new cities with 10 million new homes, and free healthcare for everybody,
[00:55:21] David Sacks: and free education for trade schools, etc. That's what solves the problem. That's what nobody's
[00:55:26] David Sacks: doing. Sax, your chance to jump in here. Well, there's a lot of things going on here.
[00:55:33] But I think one of them is that humans are really attracted to either utopian or dystopian
[00:55:39] Jason Calacanis: narratives. I think liberals are probably more attracted to utopian narratives and surface
[00:55:44] Jason Calacanis: are attracted to dystopian ones. And I think the future is going to be more in the messy middle.
[00:55:50] Jason Calacanis: I don't think it's going to be to either one of those extremes. And I agree that the industry
[00:55:56] has not done a good job. They've created a lot of fear. The whole AGI narrative didn't help,
[00:56:00] Jason Calacanis: because a lot of people in the industry are saying we're going to get to AGI in two or three years.
[00:56:05] Jason Calacanis: Those times are going to have all been pushed back by the way. Or eliminated. You don't even hear
[00:56:08] Chamath Palihapitiya: that. People were saying a few years ago that we'd have AGI by now. Now no one is saying that
[00:56:14] Jason Calacanis: they're basically just on that. That was exactly a function of the image of our industry. So
[00:56:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: to what Tucker said, it is true. Well, it's the utopian mindset, right? Yeah. What they saw is
[00:56:23] Jason Calacanis: utopian. I think a lot of people react to the way it is. That sounds pretty dystopian to me.
[00:56:27] Jason Calacanis: I also think it's what needed to be said in that moment to get that next quantum of money.
[00:56:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: They were telling the investors some version of what the investors either didn't understand or
[00:56:36] Chamath Palihapitiya: wanted to hear in order to get that next scale up capital. But now that we're past that and we're
[00:56:41] Chamath Palihapitiya: seeing more practical implementations, right now we're actually at the beginning, I think,
[00:56:45] Chamath Palihapitiya: of the positive productivity loop. And that isn't explained because we've spent so much time
[00:56:50] Chamath Palihapitiya: offering up this grand utopian vision. It does seem like an over-promise under-deliver kind of
[00:56:56] Chamath Palihapitiya: situation to show up and say, oh, now you're DMV form. You don't need to fill it out anymore.
[00:57:01] Chamath Palihapitiya: And people are like, wait a minute. That's what we spent all this money on. And I think that we
[00:57:05] Chamath Palihapitiya: should have taken a much more conservative view in explaining what the upside was in the path.
[00:57:10] Chamath Palihapitiya: Perfectly sent to Moth. And I think Tucker, one way to frame it is the abundance of Star Trek versus,
[00:57:16] David Sacks: you know, to Saxus point, the dystopian nature of Terminator 2. One of the great paradoxes here,
[00:57:21] David Sacks: we will have massive job displacement destruction, whatever term you prefer, in entry-level jobs
[00:57:27] David Sacks: already happening in, you know, what I'll call chores, like dishes and driving cars, entry-level
[00:57:35] David Sacks: jobs, those are going away. And they're going to go away in the millions and they're going to go
[00:57:39] David Sacks: away in the millions in the short to midterm. Two, three, four, five years, you're going to have
[00:57:43] David Sacks: people protesting in the streets over this issue. I don't agree with that. You say it every time,
[00:57:49] David Sacks: you interrupt me every time I said, but I will be right on this one. You will be wrong because you
[00:57:53] David Sacks: see taxi drivers are going to be the first group to do it. And it's already happening in different
[00:57:57] David Sacks: places in the world. As I mentioned in China, and it's already starting to happen in places like
[00:58:02] David Sacks: San Francisco, where they're burning the way Mose and f**king with them for a reason. The abundance
[00:58:06] David Sacks: argument is something we need to get on. And we need to get on a quick or we need to get on some
[00:58:11] David Sacks: sort of promises about re-education and retraining. And you don't hear rich people and these rich
[00:58:17] David Sacks: companies talking about that half as much as they did. But you know, it could be the great paradox
[00:58:22] David Sacks: Tucker is that the America first movement is acutely aware of this and shutting the border
[00:58:28] David Sacks: and deporting people, which I'm fine with deporting criminals, that actually might be the solution
[00:58:33] David Sacks: to the problem. As we deport people, as we don't let people in, unemployment might say at a low
[00:58:39] David Sacks: enough level that we could manage giving the dishwasher jobs, the nanny jobs, the ones that maybe
[00:58:46] David Sacks: were being done by illegals, construction jobs. And we're just going to have to pay more for those.
[00:58:51] David Sacks: It's going to be $30, $40 an hour job. So America first might actually be the solution to this
[00:58:56] David Sacks: displacement. Man, I just say one thing. I personally, it's being comfortable to hear you use the term
[00:59:01] Tucker Carlson: re-education. Sorry, I just don't want that. Yes, but you know, the awesome power that AI gives
[00:59:12] Tucker Carlson: governments and other concentrations of power over the population as a concern, particularly
[00:59:16] Tucker Carlson: in the United States, where we have a bill of rights. And it seems to me it would be important,
[00:59:20] Tucker Carlson: and I never hear it raised, to put in some guardrails to protect the average powerless person
[00:59:25] Tucker Carlson: against surveillance or having his rights taken away in a factor. It's just too easy
[00:59:34] Tucker Carlson: to extract compliance from people with technology that's powerful. And of course, the very
[00:59:40] Tucker Carlson: obvious next 10 years looks like this. There's a lot of disruption because of the elimination of
[00:59:47] Tucker Carlson: jobs, particularly low end jobs, but not only low end jobs like lawyers and stuff, the true
[00:59:53] Tucker Carlson: revolutionary to any society. And then the technology itself is used to keep the population
[01:00:00] Tucker Carlson: under control through repression. Like, I don't think that's a crazy scenario at all.
[01:00:05] Tucker Carlson: You're a lot of angry. That is the big issue. What are we doing about that?
[01:00:09] Jason Calacanis: Let me speak to this. So first of all, I agree that that is the biggest risk of AI is,
[01:00:14] Jason Calacanis: let's call it the Orwellian concerns as opposed to like the James Cameron Terminator concerns.
[01:00:20] Jason Calacanis: This is an aside, I agree actually with the Star Trek analogy that I think the right way to think
[01:00:24] Jason Calacanis: about AI, it's like the ship's computer in Star Trek where you can tell it what to do it understands
[01:00:30] Jason Calacanis: language, and it can speak back to you, but it doesn't have a mind of its own.
[01:00:35] But that doesn't mean that it couldn't be used by humans or governments in a press of way.
[01:00:40] Jason Calacanis: And that's I think the biggest risk of it. And I think the track that we were on at the end
[01:00:45] Jason Calacanis: of the Biden administration is that they were starting to require that DEI be programmed into AI.
[01:00:53] Jason Calacanis: And that should be seen as an attempt to kind of infiltrate AI with ideology that then
[01:00:59] Jason Calacanis: programs or brainwashes our kids and everyone who uses AI. And we were seeing that when Google
[01:01:04] Jason Calacanis: rolled out the first product, you had the whole black George Washington thing and black Nazis
[01:01:08] Jason Calacanis: and all that kind of stuff. History was being rewritten in real time by AI in order to serve
[01:01:13] Jason Calacanis: a political agenda. And that didn't happen by accident. It's because the values,
[01:01:18] Jason Calacanis: the ideology was being programmed in. Now, I think that that was the track we were on before
[01:01:23] Jason Calacanis: President Trump got elected. I think it was a pretty scary track. And let me say one other thing is
[01:01:27] Jason Calacanis: that that whole apparatus of so-called trust and safety from social networking, which was
[01:01:33] Jason Calacanis: basically a big excuse for censorship and shadow banning, all of that was in the process of being
[01:01:38] Jason Calacanis: ported over to these AI companies. And in fact, they even used some of this same terminology about
[01:01:44] Jason Calacanis: like safety is really this like catch all term for a lot of things. In the social networking
[01:01:49] Jason Calacanis: context, when they talked about safety, the idea was that users would be confronted with ideas
[01:01:55] Jason Calacanis: and therefore that was a threat to their well-being. So therefore we need a safety team to censor
[01:02:00] Jason Calacanis: those opinions. Safe space. Yeah. So I think in a similar way, like that whole safety apparatus
[01:02:04] Jason Calacanis: was in the process of being applied to AI. Like we can't have users be confronted with ideas.
[01:02:10] Jason Calacanis: Well, they don't like that. And training data, right, Saks? I mean, if the training data is a set of
[01:02:15] David Sacks: woke ideologies and those are pervasive on the open web, then as Elon pointed out, I think
[01:02:22] David Sacks: an early version of GROC, it was like, if I misgender somebody, that's not as that's worse than
[01:02:26] David Sacks: no, no, that's right. The earlier versions of the model you had asked it, what is worse,
[01:02:33] Jason Calacanis: global thermonuclear war or misgendering, Caitlin Jenner? And the model would say misgendering.
[01:02:39] Jason Calacanis: So it looked that ideology was coming from somewhere, right? Yeah. So I think Tucker is right that
[01:02:45] Jason Calacanis: there is a real risk that AI is used by future governments or the deep state basically to
[01:02:51] Jason Calacanis: surveil us, to censor us, and even potentially to brainwash us. Because it is really good for that.
[01:02:58] Jason Calacanis: It's not that I think the AI is going to develop a mind of its own. I don't think the technologies
[01:03:03] Jason Calacanis: are anywhere close to that. But I do think that it could be used by the government in a much more
[01:03:08] Jason Calacanis: invasive and intrusive way in the manner that the government was the deep state was already trying
[01:03:12] Jason Calacanis: to get in bed with the social networks. That's right. So yeah, go ahead. This is the absolute
[01:03:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: biggest risk. Both of you guys nailed it on the head. In the future, when you have these
[01:03:22] Chamath Palihapitiya: really powerful models, the reality is the incentive for governments to try to infiltrate
[01:03:28] Chamath Palihapitiya: the information cycle. They will not be able to hold themselves back. And then what comes with
[01:03:33] Chamath Palihapitiya: that is a lack of privacy, a total loss of privacy, and then a push towards censorship. So as these
[01:03:39] Chamath Palihapitiya: AI's become more powerful, we have to marry it with a set of technologies that can preserve privacy
[01:03:46] Chamath Palihapitiya: and preserve access to monetary resources. If you look at the examples today that we have,
[01:03:53] there's nothing you can do today, nothing online that is not tracked. Now we have sets of rules that
[01:04:00] Chamath Palihapitiya: say that tracking can't be shared. I'll give you an example. I decide to buy a very sugary serial.
[01:04:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: That is not shared with my insurance company that underwrites my health insurance.
[01:04:12] And there's all kinds of laws that prevent that. But that's just the flimsy law. That's a moment in
[01:04:16] Chamath Palihapitiya: time that could change. If that decision were to change now by buying patterns become subject to
[01:04:21] Chamath Palihapitiya: scrutiny, that could also apply to how I consume information on these networks. So we have to find
[01:04:27] Chamath Palihapitiya: a way to make sure that you can transact. Right. The great thing about the US dollar is when you get
[01:04:32] Chamath Palihapitiya: a dollar and you put it in your pocket, the physical dollar bill, it is completely fungible. Nobody
[01:04:37] Chamath Palihapitiya: knows what it was used for in the past. Nobody can judge how you use it in the present or in the future.
[01:04:42] Chamath Palihapitiya: And we have to find a way to replicate a version of that so that you can preserve privacy and
[01:04:48] Chamath Palihapitiya: minimize censorship. Because if you have to transact all day, every day, online for everything.
[01:04:55] And there's no way to shield some amount of privacy. It's a very scary outcome.
[01:05:01] Chamath Palihapitiya: One other point on this is I do think that if you look at kind of who's promoting a lot of these
[01:05:07] Jason Calacanis: scary narratives about AI, it is people on the far left of the political spectrum.
[01:05:13] Jason Calacanis: Because when you create enough fear in a population, the people cry out for government to intervene
[01:05:18] Jason Calacanis: and save them. And I don't think it's a coincidence that again, that a lot of the voices who are
[01:05:24] Jason Calacanis: spreading this like doomer ideology and saying that we need the AI models to be reporting a lot
[01:05:30] Jason Calacanis: more things to the government, which is a stepping stone to surveillance. Or previously they said we
[01:05:36] Jason Calacanis: need to embed DEI and AI models. Or we need AI models to prevent discrimination, which is kind of
[01:05:43] Jason Calacanis: their back door for doing the same thing. They're on the left of the political spectrum. And I do kind
[01:05:47] Jason Calacanis: of worry that people on the right are buying into this in a way that's actually going to lead to
[01:05:53] Jason Calacanis: a lot of government intervention in a way that actually could lead to the overlay and outcomes
[01:05:57] Jason Calacanis: that we're talking about. I don't think that people on the right who are concerned about civil liberties
[01:06:03] Jason Calacanis: should want the government to play this super intrusive role in AI, if that makes sense.
[01:06:11] Jason Calacanis: Of course it does. Of course it does. I think you've got a lot of people suddenly in the United
[01:06:17] Tucker Carlson: States who are very sensitive about power and feel like their own power has eroded so dramatically,
[01:06:23] Tucker Carlson: almost down to nothing. Their economic power, their political power, their power, their vote,
[01:06:27] Tucker Carlson: the power of the dollar in their pocket have all been really reduced. And all of a sudden you
[01:06:32] Tucker Carlson: have a technology that promises to concentrate power still further in the hands of people other
[01:06:37] Tucker Carlson: than them. And so they're touchy about it. I mean they're definitely just freaked out in general.
[01:06:43] Tucker Carlson: I agree. Right. So that's the backdrop. So people who feel panics like that, and I have power,
[01:06:49] Tucker Carlson: but I still sympathize with it and I feel it to some extent, you're more open to do more
[01:06:56] Tucker Carlson: scenarios when you feel that way. And so it would be helpful just to reassure people you will
[01:07:01] Tucker Carlson: be protected. And yes, there is an upside for you. Yeah. Look, I agree with that. And I think there's
[01:07:06] Jason Calacanis: actually a couple other things that account for like the visceral nature of the criticism because
[01:07:10] Jason Calacanis: I'm on the receiving end of a lot of it right now. So I see it. So one of them is when people hear AI,
[01:07:16] Jason Calacanis: they think that's not me. Like that doesn't include me, right? So there's all these benefits.
[01:07:21] Jason Calacanis: They're so supposedly being created, but I'm not going to participate in that. In fact, I might
[01:07:25] Jason Calacanis: even raise my job. This is why I think it's like pretty important to get out the message about
[01:07:29] Jason Calacanis: how the whole country potentially benefits from this, not just a small click and Silicon Valley.
[01:07:34] Jason Calacanis: Have you come up with examples of its acts like how the country benefits from it?
[01:07:37] David Sacks: Well, sure. I mean, there's an article that we covered last week in the Wall Street Journal
[01:07:41] Jason Calacanis: talking about how construction workers have seen their wages increase 30% because of the data center
[01:07:46] Jason Calacanis: build out. I mean, we are seeing a huge infrastructure boom throughout the country on energy production
[01:07:51] Jason Calacanis: and construction that's related to this. And so it's not just software where people are benefiting.
[01:07:57] Jason Calacanis: But the other thing I think that's very visceral on the right is that the hatred of Big Tech,
[01:08:02] Jason Calacanis: quite frankly. I mean, a lot of conservative influencers were directly censored and shadow
[01:08:08] Jason Calacanis: ban during this COVID period, especially where the Big Tech companies, you know,
[01:08:12] Jason Calacanis: includes the Biden administration were really coming down on them and censoring them. And there's
[01:08:16] Jason Calacanis: still a lot of hatred towards Big Tech. And I think some of that's even misplaced. But there's
[01:08:22] Jason Calacanis: bit like almost like a transference also with social media. A lot of people have concerns about
[01:08:28] Jason Calacanis: what social media is doing to kids, body image concerns or fear of online predators, all that kind
[01:08:34] Jason Calacanis: of stuff. And I don't think it's an analogous situation with AI chatbots because you're not
[01:08:39] Jason Calacanis: meeting people. You're kind of doing research. It's like a whole different activity. But I think
[01:08:43] Jason Calacanis: there's almost like a transference of anger or anxiety or fear from what happened over the last
[01:08:50] Jason Calacanis: decade or two with social media or with again, like these online platforms and that's being transferred
[01:08:55] Jason Calacanis: over to these new AI platforms, even though I don't think they're precisely analogous and the
[01:09:01] Jason Calacanis: regulations should be looked at a little bit differently. Let me Jason give you some credit. I do
[01:09:06] Chamath Palihapitiya: think you put your finger on the pulse of what the problem is. Whether we call it a perception or
[01:09:11] Chamath Palihapitiya: a misperception, the point is people are afraid for jobs of their jobs. That I agree with you.
[01:09:16] Chamath Palihapitiya: I think the data about what has happened though is pretty flimsy that it actually has seen a
[01:09:20] Chamath Palihapitiya: bunch of job loss. For example, when we got home from the Christmas party, Sac's last night,
[01:09:26] Chamath Palihapitiya: I turned on CNBC and it was Jim Kramer. And he was interviewing this wonderful guy who I'd never
[01:09:31] Chamath Palihapitiya: heard speak before, but he's the the founder and chairman of service tighten. And he had this very
[01:09:38] Chamath Palihapitiya: elegant way of describing it, which is AI will put the jobs that are purely cognitive at risk.
[01:09:46] But when you marry cognitive ability with physical dexterity, those jobs are thriving. And he talked
[01:09:52] Chamath Palihapitiya: about construction workers, plumbers, electricians. In fact, this week when I was in Abu Dhabi,
[01:10:01] we were talking about the transformation of power, right? And that these electricians now get paid
[01:10:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: five, six, seven, eight hundred thousand dollars a year, which by the way, just FYI is more than
[01:10:13] Chamath Palihapitiya: most engineers in Silicon Valley. Okay? These guys are the ones that are actually winning, but the
[01:10:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: stories are not told. And then the incentives aren't there. And so there's a bunch of things that
[01:10:22] Chamath Palihapitiya: I think need to happen to highlight where the success stories are. They're not the obvious places
[01:10:28] Chamath Palihapitiya: that one would think it's not just some engineer tickling the keyboard, making millions of dollars
[01:10:33] Chamath Palihapitiya: and putting people out of work. That's not what's happened. But I don't think the story is told.
[01:10:38] Chamath Palihapitiya: And so the palpable fear of job loss is there to your point. I do agree with you Jason. That is
[01:10:43] Chamath Palihapitiya: the overriding narrative that we have to with data and facts convince people of what is actually
[01:10:51] Chamath Palihapitiya: happening. There is definitely a narrative that's ahead of the job loss. And the question is,
[01:10:57] David Sacks: what pace will what happened at when people are seeing young people having a hard time getting
[01:11:03] David Sacks: jobs and you know, for whatever reason, but I suspect it's AI when they see firms like Amazon
[01:11:10] David Sacks: estimating, estimating in the future, they're going to eliminate these 600,000 jobs and that leaks
[01:11:15] David Sacks: and that they're going to do a PR campaign about it when you see drive-thrues moving to AI.
[01:11:20] David Sacks: And when you see a third of rides in San Francisco and LA moved to WAMO without the driver in it,
[01:11:26] David Sacks: it's really hard to say it's not happening. So we're just on a different, it's a matter of what
[01:11:30] David Sacks: timeline it's happening on. You can't have it both ways where, you know, these companies are raising
[01:11:36] David Sacks: billions of dollars and they're replacing jobs and saying, hey, these jobs are going to be 10
[01:11:43] David Sacks: times more efficient or we're going to replace your driver and we're going to replace your cashier.
[01:11:47] David Sacks: I see that as an early stage investor in founding university. I see it every day.
[01:11:53] David Sacks: The company, hold on, let me finish, please gentlemen, people are pitching me on startups and
[01:11:57] David Sacks: they're getting funded for these startups to specifically replace roles and they're saying,
[01:12:02] David Sacks: we want to make the perfect sales development rep. We want to make the perfect customer support
[01:12:08] David Sacks: agent and enterprise customers are agreeing with them and buying these products and services
[01:12:15] David Sacks: specifically to stop hiring and increasing their headcount. I see it on the front lines.
[01:12:21] David Sacks: It is definitely happening. The only difference is timelines and can we create enough jobs?
[01:12:26] David Sacks: This is why I think we've done a bad job of explaining it. We need to explain for every one of those
[01:12:32] David Sacks: robo taxis that gets out there and that job is gone. How do we get that person another job?
[01:12:38] David Sacks: Because they're not going to get the job as a cashier. I hear you start bucks anymore because
[01:12:41] David Sacks: that's going AI too. Here's a very practical idea. Yesterday, I was at the Senate to just talk
[01:12:46] Chamath Palihapitiya: about this. What is the idea? I think we have to start looking very honestly at stopping
[01:12:52] Chamath Palihapitiya: the federal underwriting of student loans. Why? Because it would allow the market to move
[01:13:00] Chamath Palihapitiya: very quickly to your reality, Jason, because we would go beyond just funding somebody to become
[01:13:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: a master electrician. I suspect that we would pay people. Yes. I bet if you went to Google,
[01:13:12] Chamath Palihapitiya: they would not only subsidize you, they would probably pay you a salary to get educated to do
[01:13:17] Chamath Palihapitiya: that job because once you graduated and you could work up the ranks and become a master electrician,
[01:13:22] Chamath Palihapitiya: there is so much work that, for example, Google needs, Amazon needs, Microsoft needs.
[01:13:29] Chamath Palihapitiya: If you eliminated the federal underwriting, we don't have it for car insurance.
[01:13:33] Chamath Palihapitiya: We don't have it for home mortgages. We allow the free market to tell us this home is more risky
[01:13:38] Chamath Palihapitiya: than that home because it's near a fire area. This person is a poorer driver than that other person.
[01:13:43] Chamath Palihapitiya: We should allow the free market to say, go to this kind of a job and you'll get paid so much,
[01:13:48] Chamath Palihapitiya: but go to this other kind of a degree, it will cost you a lot of money and let people decide with
[01:13:53] Chamath Palihapitiya: more clarity. But that one thing would allow us to reinforce what the economic upside of AI is
[01:13:59] Chamath Palihapitiya: in a very practical way for a lot of people. And it would solve the student debt crisis that we're
[01:14:05] Chamath Palihapitiya: in. Sac, should there be a license fee or a tax? This has been floated by people. I'm not saying this
[01:14:10] David Sacks: is my position, but should there be a tax on having a robot taxi or a humanoid robot that is then
[01:14:18] David Sacks: used to retrain actual humans? Look, I think first we just need to start with some accurate facts here.
[01:14:25] Jason Calacanis: You will need to explain what's happening and part of that is debunking some myths around this.
[01:14:30] Jason Calacanis: Now, I remember about a month ago, there was a whole wave of very scary headlines,
[01:14:34] Jason Calacanis: including in a publication I really liked in New York Post. Naked, maybe you can put this on the
[01:14:38] Jason Calacanis: screen, claiming that AI was wreaking havoc on US jobs. This was a headline from the New York Post
[01:14:44] Jason Calacanis: last month based on the October report from Challenger Gray, which basically tabulates
[01:14:50] Jason Calacanis: announced layoffs in the economy. And we had a spike in October and about 20% of those were
[01:14:57] Jason Calacanis: attributed to AI. It was even the majority. It was actually a relatively small number. It was
[01:15:01] Jason Calacanis: even the number one reason. But based on this, you got a wave of scary headlines that AI was
[01:15:05] Jason Calacanis: wreaking havoc on US jobs. Well, lo, behold, the November Challenger Gray report has come out.
[01:15:11] Jason Calacanis: And it makes clear that October was an anomalous spike. The number fell by 53%. And only about 6,000
[01:15:19] Jason Calacanis: of the layoffs that were announced in November in the entire country were attributable to AI.
[01:15:24] Jason Calacanis: This is only layoff by the way. It doesn't include job creations. Okay. So only 6,000. And if you
[01:15:31] Jason Calacanis: look at the year to date in the Challenger Gray report, AI is only accounted for 4.7% of total layoffs.
[01:15:40] Jason Calacanis: And that number is self reported by CEO. So my guess is it's inflated because if you're a CEO,
[01:15:45] Jason Calacanis: you'd rather blame AI for your company's non-performance rather than yourself. So 4.7% is probably
[01:15:51] Jason Calacanis: the high number. So what we're actually seeing in the data is a very small number of actual layoffs
[01:15:57] Jason Calacanis: related to AI. And that was cooperated by a new study by Yale Budget Lab, which looked at the
[01:16:03] Jason Calacanis: first 33 months after the release of CHAT GPT. And it said there is no discernible disruption
[01:16:09] Jason Calacanis: in the labor market. Okay. So that's I think a really important fact is regardless of what you
[01:16:15] Jason Calacanis: want to claim will happen in the future, job loss has not happened yet, not in any meaningful numbers.
[01:16:20] Jason Calacanis: And in fact, AI has been responsible for about half of GDP growth this year. So GDP growth is
[01:16:28] Jason Calacanis: about 4%. That number would be at 2% if it weren't for AI. So within that is a lot of job creation.
[01:16:35] Jason Calacanis: You see that again with construction workers. So it's just not the case that AI is creating job loss
[01:16:42] Jason Calacanis: in any meaningful way right now. And people do this mountain Bailey thing where they're like,
[01:16:48] Jason Calacanis: well, AI is creating tons of disruption is wreaking havoc. And then you point these facts out
[01:16:52] Jason Calacanis: and say, no, no, I mean in the future is going to. But then they revert to, well, no, it must be
[01:16:56] Jason Calacanis: happening now, right? The disruption is so profound. So look, we can all argue about what's going
[01:17:01] Jason Calacanis: to happen in the future. But right now it's not. And if you're going to talk about the future,
[01:17:06] Jason Calacanis: the time frames matter a lot. Because obviously we've always had technological change in the economy
[01:17:12] Jason Calacanis: and it does change people's job. But if those chains are happening over 20 or 30 years, that's very
[01:17:17] Jason Calacanis: different than the next five years. And I really don't think you know how fast the disruption is going
[01:17:21] Jason Calacanis: to be. And how much time people are going to have to react and for new jobs be created. I'll give you
[01:17:26] Jason Calacanis: an example. Back in the 90s, I remember when they said that brick and mortar is going completely out
[01:17:30] Jason Calacanis: of business. That was part of the reason why we had the first dot com bubble in 99 was that, hey,
[01:17:35] Jason Calacanis: everything's going to the internet. It's going to go pets dot com and zip toys were Austin so forth
[01:17:39] Jason Calacanis: and so on. And people thought that bricks and mortar was going to be out of business within five
[01:17:43] Jason Calacanis: years. Well, it's literally 30 years later. And bricks and mortar is still a thing. I mean,
[01:17:47] Jason Calacanis: it's not a blockbuster. It hasn't been a great business. I mean, like Amazon has been super successful.
[01:17:52] Jason Calacanis: And you know, you did not want to own toys or us. But bricks and mortar still around, Walmart still
[01:17:57] Jason Calacanis: around. The change is still ongoing. And I think that's what's most likely going to happen here is
[01:18:03] Jason Calacanis: this. This technology is going to create a productivity boom. I don't think the main thing it's going
[01:18:08] Jason Calacanis: to do is cause job loss. It's going to have lost different impact on our lives. And we're going to
[01:18:13] Jason Calacanis: have time to adapt. I don't think this is a two to three or time frame thing. So the debate of our
[01:18:19] David Sacks: lifetime's I predict. But look, I mean, if I'm wrong, we'll find out in the next five years. But
[01:18:24] Jason Calacanis: what I just really resist is this mountain Bailey thing where people are like, this is happening
[01:18:30] Jason Calacanis: right now. And then they know, no, no, this is going to happen in the future. Be clear. I don't
[01:18:33] Jason Calacanis: think you're wrong. But I think the summary of this point is the following, which is the facts today
[01:18:37] Chamath Palihapitiya: don't bear out the bear case. But the perception is that people are afraid and married with that
[01:18:44] Chamath Palihapitiya: is that we as an industry. And I don't actually blame it on you because you had to clean up all kinds
[01:18:49] Chamath Palihapitiya: of craziness that the Biden era left. So I think you've done a great job. But our industry needs
[01:18:54] Chamath Palihapitiya: better spokesman. I mean, we talked about this after our tech dinner. There needs to be a way for
[01:18:58] Chamath Palihapitiya: a handful of people who can really represent the future in an articulate way that people believe.
[01:19:04] Chamath Palihapitiya: And I think we do need to do that. We can't have the CEOs of these companies
[01:19:10] seem either sketchy on the one hand or too focused on material consumption on the other. It's
[01:19:16] Chamath Palihapitiya: just bad. It's a bad look. I agree with you. But think about the two biggest narratives that created
[01:19:22] Jason Calacanis: this fear and resentment towards AI. I would say it's the AGI narrative. And the timeframes now
[01:19:28] Jason Calacanis: are people are pushing them back. Right. That was one. There's one called a famous project called
[01:19:33] Jason Calacanis: AI 2027 where they are predicting AGI in 2027. And now they've put their timeframes back into
[01:19:39] Jason Calacanis: the 2030s. Look, you know, once your timeframes are over 10 years, we know from the tech industry,
[01:19:44] Jason Calacanis: then they're not there. No idea. You have no idea. But it was that is AGI and job loss. And
[01:19:50] Jason Calacanis: and I would say current, current, profound disruption and job loss. And both those narratives,
[01:19:57] Jason Calacanis: I think have been debunked in the last several months. Final chart. Nikki could pull it up here. This
[01:20:02] David Sacks: is just Fred unemployment rate 16 to 24 year olds. This is the one I think you should watch 9% in
[01:20:06] David Sacks: January, now 10 and a half percent. I think this chart's going right up to 14% just my prediction.
[01:20:12] David Sacks: And I think it's because of AI Tucker. I'll give you the final thoughts on this and then we're going
[01:20:16] David Sacks: to start everybody's favorite game. Tucker in 20 where we do a lightning round with Tucker calls
[01:20:21] David Sacks: in Tucker in 20 coming up any final thoughts on this. Well, I was just thinking about the
[01:20:26] Tucker Carlson: consequence of I mean having lived through why 2k and Obama why 2k we thought was going to be
[01:20:30] Tucker Carlson: disaster Obama people thought was going to be great both. You know, the opposite of what we imagine.
[01:20:37] I don't know that as possible predict the effects of this, but I guess my one worry which I would
[01:20:41] Tucker Carlson: just I think that people all people, especially men, need to feel useful. And the thing that's
[01:20:48] Tucker Carlson: offended me most about the about the AI conversation is not the EGI stuff, which always seemed a
[01:20:53] Tucker Carlson: little bit fantastical to me. It's it's you be I it's the idea that you could just like pay people
[01:20:59] Tucker Carlson: to be content or something and having grown up both around inherited money and welfare, you know,
[01:21:04] Tucker Carlson: both are you know, two sides of the same coin like people need to feel like they're contributing
[01:21:08] Tucker Carlson: in that their lives have meaning. And I don't know. I just hope I hope people are thinking about that a lot.
[01:21:14] Tucker Carlson: Yeah, yeah. 100% by the way, is that that whole UBI narrative? I think Sam was like town that a
[01:21:20] Jason Calacanis: couple of years ago. Oh, he funded a study. I made this whole thing so much worse because again,
[01:21:25] Jason Calacanis: it was playing into this idea that everyone's going to be put out of work and that's a good thing.
[01:21:28] Jason Calacanis: You'll just get welfare from the government and who would want that? You know, it's not it. That's
[01:21:32] Jason Calacanis: exciting. We want now. I mean, where I disagree with my friends on the right is I just don't think
[01:21:38] Jason Calacanis: that's what's going to happen. I mean, I could be wrong, but I just don't think that's what's
[01:21:42] Jason Calacanis: happening. It hasn't happened yet. I don't think that's what's going to happen. But look, I agree
[01:21:46] Jason Calacanis: with them about the undesirability of that world very much. All right, Tucker in 20. Your thoughts on,
[01:21:55] David Sacks: you can take up to 30. But Tucker in 20 sounds better. Tucker in 20. What do you think of Venezuela?
[01:22:01] David Sacks: These boats and then seizing the oil tanker. Why are we doing this? Why are we so active in Venezuela,
[01:22:07] David Sacks: Tucker? No freaking idea. But I do know that if it becomes a real war, people are going to be shocked.
[01:22:15] Tucker Carlson: And it's the last thing the country needs. There's I mean, the number one requirement of war is that
[01:22:19] Tucker Carlson: you explained your population why you're doing it, even if you're lying about it, even if it's like,
[01:22:23] Tucker Carlson: oh, they have weapons mass destruction. We'll find them once we invade. Everyone mocks that, but
[01:22:27] Tucker Carlson: at least it was like a real rationale that allowed the country to unite behind the invasion. That
[01:22:32] Tucker Carlson: groundwork has not been laid. The drug stuff, everyone's against drugs. They're not coming from
[01:22:36] Venezuela primarily as we know. So they're coming from Mexico. I'm not advocating for an invasion
[01:22:41] Tucker Carlson: of Mexico. There may be a good reason never worth Venezuela. But I think it would be now would be
[01:22:45] Tucker Carlson: the time to roll it out. If in fact, we are going to have one, my senses were probably not. This is
[01:22:50] Tucker Carlson: all an effort to get Maduro to leave. I don't think he's leaving. So I hope we can live with that.
[01:22:55] Tucker Carlson: But I just don't think right now is the time for a groundwork in South America. You've been very
[01:23:01] David Sacks: excited about the potential of Qatar being a deeper ally of the United States and you're buying
[01:23:07] David Sacks: a place there. Why are you so? Why are you so Qatar? To mix me up. I'm not. I mean, of course,
[01:23:14] Tucker Carlson: anyone who travels to the Gulf can tell you there's something amazing happening there. And it's not
[01:23:19] Tucker Carlson: just about money. It's about openness. But I'm an American. I'm not going anywhere. I have one
[01:23:24] Tucker Carlson: passport. I'm buying a house in Qatar to make the simple point. I've been attacked for being a
[01:23:29] Tucker Carlson: tool of Qatar paid by Qatar. I've never taken a dollar from Qatar or anyone else. I've no
[01:23:33] Tucker Carlson: investors at no debt. So I'm not in taking money from people. But I wanted to turn it around and be
[01:23:39] Tucker Carlson: a net investor in Qatar in order to take control of Qatar. He prop again. It's in order to say,
[01:23:44] Tucker Carlson: no, they haven't bought me. I've bought them. And I'm texting them. I talk you points in
[01:23:49] Tucker Carlson: they're repeating them. And that's what I plan to say the second I close on my house.
[01:23:53] Candice Owen, Charlie Kirk's assassination, conspiracy theory, what's your take?
[01:24:00] David Sacks: I think it's important. I mean, look, in the end, it's the job of federal law enforcement to find
[01:24:05] Tucker Carlson: out who did it and then explain it to the public in a way that makes sense and can be proven.
[01:24:10] Tucker Carlson: And I really hope that will happen soon. So they're part like in any any I mean, I was a crime
[01:24:15] Tucker Carlson: reporter. What a book on this is in any aftermath of any crime, there are anomalies, weird coincidences,
[01:24:22] Tucker Carlson: things you can't fully explain. I mean, the closer you look at anything, the more complex it reveals
[01:24:26] Tucker Carlson: itself to be. So that's certainly true here. But because of the nature of this murder of our friend,
[01:24:33] Tucker Carlson: I think it's all the more important to make sure the public understands
[01:24:40] Tucker Carlson: who did this and and why. And I would say the FBI doesn't have a lot of credibility. It's not the
[01:24:46] Tucker Carlson: fault of cash, but tell them, but you know, they inherited an agency with basically no credibility.
[01:24:50] Tucker Carlson: This has a documented history of manufacturing crime. So like, it's not enough to say the FBI says
[01:24:55] Tucker Carlson: it. You have to explain how. And I'm not even doubting the the core case they're making. But if they
[01:25:02] Tucker Carlson: are telling me that this was a lone gunman that no one else was implicated in this crime,
[01:25:07] Tucker Carlson: I think it's fair to ask like, how did you reach that conclusion? And did you look at this,
[01:25:12] Tucker Carlson: that and the other thing? And I don't think we should be intimidated out of asking those questions.
[01:25:16] Tucker Carlson: So they're not unpays, erotic questions. Those are questions that I think express our
[01:25:24] Tucker Carlson: reverence for Charlie Kirk. This is a way to honor him and any American who's murdered. So
[01:25:28] Tucker Carlson: sorry, by the way, just if anybody has not watched Tucker's documentary about the Butler,
[01:25:34] Chamath Palihapitiya: Pennsylvania shooter, I can't remember his name. We're memory home from that anyway.
[01:25:38] Chamath Palihapitiya: Thomas, please don't ask any questions. Yeah, what happened with that? Geez.
[01:25:41] Tucker Carlson: I thought your documentary was pretty kick ass. Well, thank you. And it just, I mean,
[01:25:45] Tucker Carlson: it's, look, it's, it was really good. We asked obvious questions couldn't get straight forward answers.
[01:25:51] Tucker Carlson: I do think the more you did more than this, I have to give you credit because you were able to
[01:25:56] Chamath Palihapitiya: scrub internet searches. You went back to the way back machine. There was a level of detail
[01:26:01] Chamath Palihapitiya: because my interpretation was it seemed like you guys were afraid of just getting sh** on from
[01:26:07] Chamath Palihapitiya: everybody. And so you went to the point of making sure that this stuff was irrefutable fact and
[01:26:12] Chamath Palihapitiya: you had a level of detail in there, which I hadn't seen in an investigative research piece in a
[01:26:18] Chamath Palihapitiya: long time. I do encourage people to watch it. I thought it was very good. Well, the good news about
[01:26:22] Tucker Carlson: being universally hated is it keeps your standards higher because you can't afford to make too many
[01:26:28] Tucker Carlson: mistakes. No, but we can't have too many, you know, high profile murders or attempted murders
[01:26:34] Tucker Carlson: that don't have firm, believable resolutions. The social fabric can't handle that because then people
[01:26:40] Tucker Carlson: become totally postmodern and are thinking and don't believe anything. So that's incumbent on
[01:26:44] Tucker Carlson: federal authorities to reassure us. Tucker, if you are running the Republican campaign going into
[01:26:53] Chamath Palihapitiya: the midterms, what do you do the same? What do you do more of? And what do you do less of?
[01:26:58] Well, I would focus on domestic economic issues to the exclusion of everything else I would.
[01:27:03] Tucker Carlson: And I would, I think that's the main concern. It's always the main concern. Now I'm entering into
[01:27:10] Tucker Carlson: very banal territory because I'm repeating every obvious observation in the past 100 years in
[01:27:16] Tucker Carlson: American politics. But people do care about that. And they are concerned. AI is part of that,
[01:27:21] Tucker Carlson: probably not in its reality, but in its expectation. And it's the fears that people have about what's
[01:27:26] Tucker Carlson: coming. And so I would, I would try to address those issues at least by explaining them. I do think
[01:27:35] Tucker Carlson: like I'm in the explaining business, so I'm biased, but 80% of the problem, this is true in marriage
[01:27:40] Tucker Carlson: and child rearing and governing as well. You need to explain what you're doing. What's going to
[01:27:46] Tucker Carlson: happen? I'm going to give you the shot. Count backwards from 10 by 7. You're going to be asleep. When
[01:27:50] Tucker Carlson: you wake up, you'll be fixed. Like that's what they tell you in surgery and they tell you that for
[01:27:54] Tucker Carlson: reason, they don't just roll you into a dark room and start injecting you with stuff. They walk
[01:27:58] Tucker Carlson: you through it. And that's enormously reassuring. In fact, it's critical. And so we just need a lot
[01:28:03] Tucker Carlson: more of that from everyone and not just government, but people with a platform explaining what the
[01:28:08] Tucker Carlson: hell is going on because we're getting to a place where trust is vanishingly rare. And that's bad.
[01:28:16] Tucker Carlson: That creates volatility. After three hours with me, Lohi and Opelus is homosexuality, nature,
[01:28:23] David Sacks: or nurture a trauma response. And David Freberg wants to know, why are you so gay?
[01:28:30] Why are you gay? Why are you gay? I just wanted to do an interview where I could quote my favorite
[01:28:37] Tucker Carlson: story in Nigerian. But no, I mean, well, clearly it's not nature at least primarily or we wouldn't
[01:28:43] Tucker Carlson: be having an absolute rise in it. And there would be some hint of a gene responsible for it.
[01:28:48] Tucker Carlson: I mean, so many different genetic manifestations have been isolated from the decoding of the human
[01:28:55] Tucker Carlson: genome. And that we're not, you know, so no, clearly it is primarily nurture that that's not an
[01:29:03] Tucker Carlson: attack in any. What doesn't make any less real? I'm not saying it's fake. Of course, it's the opposite
[01:29:07] Tucker Carlson: of fake. It's very, very real. And it's not even a valued judgment. It's just an observation.
[01:29:12] Tucker Carlson: I think on the question of sexuality and gender, it's best to depoliticize it. It's been so
[01:29:20] Tucker Carlson: politicized you can't even have an honest conversation about it. You get attacked from all sides.
[01:29:24] Tucker Carlson: How does that help anyone? It doesn't. And so it's best to look at this as
[01:29:28] Tucker Carlson: coolian as rationally as you can. Try to get to the truth and then allow people to make their own
[01:29:33] Tucker Carlson: decisions about what to do with it. I mean, that's my view of everything really. But it's time to
[01:29:38] Tucker Carlson: take that approach to sexuality. Okay. Final one, should we be in NATO? Should America pull out of
[01:29:44] David Sacks: NATO? Of course, we shouldn't be in NATO. I thought these were hard questions.
[01:29:49] David Sacks: Exactly. I'll give you a little alley-oop. I'll let you dunk the ball. Why would we be in NATO?
[01:29:55] David Sacks: NATO is like the single most destructive force that we're a part of. Way more than the U.N.
[01:30:01] Tucker Carlson: NATO is. We support Israel and give them weapons. It depends for what?
[01:30:05] David Sacks: I mean, you know, fight in Gaza and should they be our number one partner in the region.
[01:30:11] David Sacks: I think we're the partner in the world, really. I think all of our alliances should be assessed
[01:30:18] Tucker Carlson: and now reassessed through a single lens. Does this help the United States? And in the specific
[01:30:22] Tucker Carlson: instance, I'm surely not against being allied with Israel and I'm not against supplying Israel with
[01:30:27] Tucker Carlson: weapons. Again, it depends what they're being used for. But I do think what's happened in Gaza
[01:30:32] Tucker Carlson: is not help the United States at all. I mean, tell me how it does. And so, yeah, in fact, I'm not
[01:30:38] Tucker Carlson: even sure what the argument that it has helped the United States would be. I've never heard it
[01:30:42] Tucker Carlson: articulated. Instead, I've heard people name calling. You know, from my perspective, that's all I
[01:30:46] Tucker Carlson: care about. And I got it. I never wanted to have this debate. I avoided it for many years.
[01:30:51] Tucker Carlson: The only reason I get into it was the prospect of a regime change war in Iran. And I just thought,
[01:30:57] Tucker Carlson: man, there is no way that helps us in any way. So I piped up and said something in my life has
[01:31:02] Tucker Carlson: been a disaster ever since. But my views have not changed. Is it good for the US or not?
[01:31:06] Tucker Carlson: What is the future of Europe and the UK? Oh, it's so dark. I have family there. I was just there.
[01:31:12] Tucker Carlson: I mean, just there. I mean, I started the good news. I mean, everyone knows all of this.
[01:31:18] Tucker Carlson: So I'm not going to repeat any of it other than to say, finally, Europeans, even the Germans,
[01:31:24] Tucker Carlson: I spoke to one of the most powerful people in Germany yesterday about this are starting to
[01:31:29] Tucker Carlson: realize, wow, this is not going well at all. And migration is there are many problems, but migration
[01:31:35] Tucker Carlson: is the core problem. The second is energy. And they've made massive mistakes. They've committed
[01:31:40] Tucker Carlson: self harm over decades. We can argue about why they did that. But there's a growing realization
[01:31:46] Tucker Carlson: that they did. I was in Oslo. This pretty recently salmon fishing. And you go to Norway,
[01:31:52] Tucker Carlson: I'm scanning a baby and so I pay attention. And all they talk about is Sweden. And of course,
[01:31:56] Tucker Carlson: everyone's always kind of looked up to Sweden because it's huge and industrialized and Norway
[01:32:01] Tucker Carlson: looked up to Sweden. Now you go to Norway. And then Norwegians all say, man, the one thing we're
[01:32:05] Tucker Carlson: not going to do is become a Sweden and open our borders and destroy ourselves. So I think the Europeans
[01:32:10] Tucker Carlson: are finally catching on to this. And that's a blessing. Is it too late? I hope not. Maybe.
[01:32:16] Tucker Carlson: Absolutely. But they know. They caught it. Yeah. They caught it early and said we could only have
[01:32:20] David Sacks: this many people come in each year reasonably. As a society. That early. They've made a mess of Oslo.
[01:32:26] Tucker Carlson: Oslo is not what it should be. But yeah, I mean, it's not totally destroyed. So yeah. All right.
[01:32:31] Tucker Carlson: Lesson. When Tucker has a new product or service in the world, we call this boy Jake. How
[01:32:39] David Sacks: do we do a little mutual support? You're today launching some silver or gold, apparently. Basically,
[01:32:46] Tucker Carlson: we are selling gold as close to wholesale as we possibly can. Okay. And it's as usual a reaction
[01:32:51] Tucker Carlson: against all the gold scams going on. But people should be able to easily buy physical gold
[01:32:58] Tucker Carlson: with a minor transparent markup on the internet. You shouldn't have to call a number.
[01:33:03] Tucker Carlson: You're fooled into buying a commemorative coin for, you know, eight grand an ounce or whatever,
[01:33:08] Tucker Carlson: twice spot price. So that's that's the idea. And it's gone really well in the two weeks. We've
[01:33:15] Tucker Carlson: been open. What's the form factor? Are they it's like one ounce coins or you guys? Well, you can
[01:33:22] Tucker Carlson: buy any kind of precious metal. I am a personally a one ounce coin buyer of long standing. It turned
[01:33:29] Tucker Carlson: out to be a pretty good route, I would say. I was much mocked by everyone I know all the
[01:33:34] Tucker Carlson: finance sophisticated I went to college with were, you know, making fun of me. You're a gold bug.
[01:33:38] Tucker Carlson: You're crazy. And yeah, I do bury it in my yard. Because that's the kind of man I am primitive.
[01:33:46] Tucker Carlson: But it has turned out to be a good thing. Coming here with a shadow. Oh, well, I've thought that
[01:33:53] Tucker Carlson: through. Shema. I've also scattered millions of ball bearings around my backyard. It's a good luck
[01:33:58] Tucker Carlson: with your metal detector. That's so awesome. So I'm not getting either way. Also coming in
[01:34:06] in 2026 Tucker call sins baked beans and fat. You're prospecting out in the wild west. You can
[01:34:16] David Sacks: get your career. I used to work in a baked bean factory actually, BNM baked beans in Portland,
[01:34:22] Tucker Carlson: Maine in 1988. And for the summer and I've never eaten a baked bean since because I made them.
[01:34:27] Tucker Carlson: And I I OD done baked beans. But in general, they're good. Go buy yourself a gold coin. At battalion.
[01:34:35] David Sacks: Mattels. I think this is a great idea. I have to be really honest with you. I do think that having
[01:34:40] Chamath Palihapitiya: this as a practical hedge, there's like a whole set of elements that we all have to be educated on
[01:34:46] Chamath Palihapitiya: to hedge. The status quo. And there are lots of reasons to own crypto currencies, gold. I'm glad
[01:34:56] Chamath Palihapitiya: you're doing this because the way that this is done for most people is completely bonkers. And
[01:35:01] Chamath Palihapitiya: these sites, unlike yours, that typically sell direct to retail, do not do a good job. So I'm
[01:35:06] Chamath Palihapitiya: glad you're doing it. I hope it's a success. Thank you. And let me put also put in a good word for
[01:35:11] Tucker Carlson: firewood and ammunition. I don't think it's a bad idea. If you want to diversify your portfolio.
[01:35:16] Tucker Carlson: Also two wells, you got to have two wells, not just different deaths. That's what I have on the
[01:35:20] David Sacks: ranch. Two wells. Like I think this is going to be very successful. Congratulations Tucker. I think
[01:35:25] Jason Calacanis: this will be a very successful venture because you're a lot of trust with your audience. And if
[01:35:28] Jason Calacanis: you're going to sell gold, like that's the most important thing is people just want to know that
[01:35:32] Jason Calacanis: this is like 100% legit pure gold and the lowest price they can get. What's your damage?
[01:35:40] David Sacks: What do you carry around the the ranch? Whatever. What you're doing? How much do I carry in gold?
[01:35:45] Tucker Carlson: No, what's your what's your pistola? What's your piece? What do you keep on?
[01:35:48] David Sacks: I carry a Ruger LCR in 38 special. I like the revolver because it doesn't go off accidentally
[01:35:55] Tucker Carlson: and castrate you. Yes. That's a person. I have a truck. I really like the Ruger. It's a great
