[00:00:00] **Jason Calacanis**: Brad Gershner is here joining us hot after crashing the stock market and popping the AI bubble
[00:00:06] **Jason Calacanis**: well done, Brad. Will they get into it? All of our portfolios thank you. We're all down 15%
[00:00:13] **Jason Calacanis**: this week. Can we ask open AI to just put a moratorium on any more public statements or appearances
[00:00:19] **Jason Calacanis**: for another couple months? Good job, Brad. You decided you'd be a podcaster. You're like,
[00:00:23] **Jason Calacanis**: hey, let me ask a couple of hard questions here and you're popping the AI bubble.
[00:00:30] **Brad Gerstner**: Something like that. Do as I say, not as I do. Are we getting into it? Because I think it is
[00:00:34] **Brad Gerstner**: interesting, actually. It's super interesting. Super interesting. Let's go to Sam. Of course,
[00:00:38] **Brad Gerstner**: if you're not in the industry, Sam Altman appeared on the Fabulous BG2 podcast last Friday.
[00:00:46] **Brad Gerstner**: And it got a little frisky when our fifth bestie here asked what I thought was
[00:00:54] **Brad Gerstner**: a completely legitimate, totally mundane question. Hey, you're making 13 billion.
[00:01:01] **Jason Calacanis**: It's actually a softball question to be honest. It was an underhanded pitch. The way that it was
[00:01:06] **Jason Calacanis**: asked, I think you did a very reasonable job of asking a good question in a very fair way.
[00:01:10] **Jason Calacanis**: So let's just show this clip here and then I want to go behind the pod with you, Brad.
[00:01:15] **Brad Gerstner**: So I think this single biggest question I've heard all week and hanging over the market is,
[00:01:21] **Brad Gerstner**: how can the company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments?
[00:01:30] **Sam Altman**: You've heard the criticism, Sam. We're doing well more revenue than that. Second of all,
[00:01:34] **Sam Altman**: Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer, excuse me. I just,
[00:01:39] **Sam Altman**: enough. I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy open AI shares. I don't think
[00:01:45] **Sam Altman**: you want to sell that. Including myself. Including myself. Talk with a lot of breathless concern
[00:01:52] **Sam Altman**: about our compute stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we could sell,
[00:01:56] **Sam Altman**: you know, your shares are anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on
[00:02:00] **Sam Altman**: Twitter, whatever about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply revenue.
[00:02:05] **Sam Altman**: He's growing steeply. We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow.
[00:02:09] **Sam Altman**: There are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's
[00:02:13] **Sam Altman**: appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open AI is about to go out of business
[00:02:18] **Sam Altman**: and, you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would
[00:02:21] **Sam Altman**: love to see them get burned on that. So Brad, you asked, I think, like, you know, to Moth and I
[00:02:27] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: were just saying, pretty mundane question. You said it very nicely. I guess we could give Sam
[00:02:33] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: a little bit of grace. I don't know if he was being a little cheeky or maybe he's tired
[00:02:36] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: of answering the question, but the internet took this and ran with it in a very viral way that he
[00:02:43] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: was angry and he was hostile. How did you take it? And that's the interesting thing, right? I mean,
[00:02:49] **Brad Gerstner**: I mean, listen, we bust each other's chops all the time. We get feisty with one another. Sometimes
[00:02:54] **Brad Gerstner**: it runs amok. Like we don't know if somebody's being serious or not serious and, you know, Sam and I
[00:02:59] **Brad Gerstner**: had a good laugh after, you know, I think Sam was, he was feisty, but I think he also intended it as a
[00:03:05] **Brad Gerstner**: joke. He knows that I don't want to sell my shares. He knows that I would like to buy more shares
[00:03:09] **Brad Gerstner**: in the company, et cetera. But I think the reason that it went so viral is because it is a super
[00:03:16] **Brad Gerstner**: important question. People are really nervous. They're wondering, are we walking into an AI bubble?
[00:03:22] **Brad Gerstner**: Like how can these huge numbers? How can you be talking about 1.4 trillion in spending when you,
[00:03:28] **Brad Gerstner**: you know, have kind of gap revenue that's been reported to 13 billion this year? So I was,
[00:03:33] **Brad Gerstner**: I was a little disappointed. And I tweeted about this afterwards that kind of the feistyness got in
[00:03:38] **Brad Gerstner**: the way of the answer. But if you listen to his words during the rest of the segment, he basically
[00:03:45] **Brad Gerstner**: said, listen, we think we're going to have 100 billion in revenues over the course of the next
[00:03:49] **Brad Gerstner**: couple of years. And, you know, Jay Kelly sent the team a chart that basically just shows the
[00:03:54] **Brad Gerstner**: information's forecast for what open AI and anthropics revenues are going to be over the course
[00:03:59] **Brad Gerstner**: of the next several years. And like the information is reporting that their internal numbers are
[00:04:04] **Brad Gerstner**: both over 100 billion dollars. This is the information reporting on leaked internal numbers,
[00:04:09] **Jason Calacanis**: or the information is taking a guess. No, I think this is, I think they report, this is on leaked
[00:04:14] **Brad Gerstner**: internal numbers according to the information. And so, you know, I think Sam's in his head saying,
[00:04:21] **Brad Gerstner**: I believe, and he said multiple times on the pod, we're going to have revenues in excess of 100
[00:04:27] **Brad Gerstner**: billion dollars. And the 1.4 trillion, it's super important to remember. This is over a period of
[00:04:33] **Brad Gerstner**: five or six years. I estimate about half of that spending is going to be borne by the partners.
[00:04:39] **Brad Gerstner**: So now we're talking 700 billion dollars in spending. Spread that over five or six years. In the
[00:04:45] **Brad Gerstner**: out years, you're probably talking about 150 billion dollars of CapEx to open AI. So he's probably,
[00:04:52] **Brad Gerstner**: you know, sitting there saying on any said, we're going to have over 100 billion of revenues. So,
[00:04:56] **Brad Gerstner**: if we have 150 billion of revenue and 150 billion in CapEx, now it begins to pencil out a little
[00:05:02] **Brad Gerstner**: bit more. But importantly, he said, and if we don't have those revenues, we've got to match our
[00:05:08] **Brad Gerstner**: revenues to our expenses, right? I think they will just extend, recut the deals in order to make
[00:05:14] **Brad Gerstner**: those expenses doable for the company. This is an important point because we don't know, we
[00:05:19] **Jason Calacanis**: haven't seen these actual deals. And if they have conditions or outs, or if they can push it out,
[00:05:25] **Jason Calacanis**: or they can cancel it. Maybe, you know, they have, and that will come out, I guess, in the public
[00:05:29] **Jason Calacanis**: filings. But putting all that aside, the market was not happy about this. Microsoft, Nvidia,
[00:05:36] **Jason Calacanis**: Oracle, Broadcom, CoreWeave, who all are the partners we're talking about, who are close to,
[00:05:43] **Jason Calacanis**: and when you see these charts of all the deals Sam has done, and Sam's a great deal maker,
[00:05:47] **Jason Calacanis**: obviously, they were all down six to 20%. So this has, in fact, been a significant correction
[00:05:55] **Jason Calacanis**: in terms of the AI boom. So before we get into their CFOs comments, Shemath, I'd love to hear
[00:06:00] **Jason Calacanis**: you're just general. I think it's fun to give these guys, but they're totally and completely
[00:06:08] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: uncorrelated. Okay. Every now and then you have a bad day, I've done thousands of hours on TV,
[00:06:16] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: I've had a couple of really bad days. You've got some been there. Yeah. I suspect that if Sam
[00:06:22] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: had to do it over, he wouldn't have said what he said in the way he said it. And even if he was
[00:06:25] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: joking, he would have practiced it a little bit more and just landed it. So what's actually going
[00:06:32] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: on? I think right now we are in a period of getting a little risk off and rebalancing. Why?
[00:06:41] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: There are two sets of things that are happening. The first set of things is the market is learning
[00:06:47] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: to digest all of the capex that has happened. And they're all breathlessly trying to build models
[00:06:55] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: that try to predict what the ROI is of that spend. The second part of that is they're trying to figure
[00:07:01] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: out how this new spend will actually impact future earnings. And this is less to do with open AI,
[00:07:09] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: but it has much more to do with the big stalwarts of the Mag 7. Google's earnings were phenomenal.
[00:07:16] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Their AI numbers were blazing hot. Facebook's was terrible. Apple is now in this really interesting
[00:07:26] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: place where it seems like they're going to seed their AI business to Google and pay them billions
[00:07:33] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: of dollars a year like they get paid billions of dollars a year for search from them. I think
[00:07:39] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: that that's what's happening. The second part is as you go into your end, there's just a little
[00:07:45] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: bit of all in the market and people are like, let me just consolidate. Let me book some wins. Let
[00:07:50] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: me get ready for the new year. Let me tax loss harvest. Let me do all the things that people used
[00:07:54] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: to wait until mid-December. And now they are smart enough to know that mid-December the price
[00:08:00] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: action is sh**. And so now this price action starts in mid-November. So I wouldn't pin this
[00:08:05] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: on Brad and Sam. I just think this is natural market machinations, but to be clear, we are very much
[00:08:12] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: getting into a phase of risk off. Yeah, and this got exacerbated sacks because on Wednesday,
[00:08:20] **Jason Calacanis**: open AI decided to be in the news. Again, when their CFO Sarah Fryer told the Wall Street Journal,
[00:08:26] **Jason Calacanis**: she hopes the US government, that's you sacks, will backstop the financing of its 1.4 trillion
[00:08:33] **Jason Calacanis**: dollars in data centers. Here's the direct quote, the backstop, the guarantee that allows the
[00:08:39] **Jason Calacanis**: financing to happen. And she said that the federal guarantees would quote, really drop the cost
[00:08:46] **Jason Calacanis**: of finance, of course it would. And this would allow open AI to borrow more money at lower rates
[00:08:52] **Jason Calacanis**: from a much larger pool of lenders. That went viral. And everybody said, oh my god,
[00:08:57] **Jason Calacanis**: it started feeding, I think, the narrative that maybe open AI is insolvent, in fact. And there's
[00:09:02] **Jason Calacanis**: no way for them to pay their bills, which obviously is a little bit ridiculous.
[00:09:08] **Jason Calacanis**: And people are trying to correlate this to obviously the dot com bust and then the great
[00:09:14] **Jason Calacanis**: financial crisis. But on Wednesday nights, Fryer walked back her comments. I want to clarify
[00:09:20] **Jason Calacanis**: for my comments, open AI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments.
[00:09:25] **Jason Calacanis**: I used the word quote, backstop and it muddy the point I was making the point that American
[00:09:31] **Jason Calacanis**: strength and technology will come for building real industrial capacity, which requires the private
[00:09:34] **Jason Calacanis**: sector and government playing their part. And she also said that open AI was some pace to generate
[00:09:39] **Jason Calacanis**: 13 billion. I'll get to you on this one, Brad, because he took offense to the 13 billion dollar
[00:09:44] **Jason Calacanis**: revenue number and disputed that. So we'll see if there's some clarity there. But sacks, you came
[00:09:50] **Jason Calacanis**: over the top and tweeted that there will be no federal bailout. There's plenty of people
[00:09:57] **Jason Calacanis**: available to pick up the mantle of open AI needed a bailout. You got five major frontier
[00:10:04] **Jason Calacanis**: model companies, Grog, Claude, Gemini, plenty of them. So sacks, you came in, Daddy's home and
[00:10:12] **Jason Calacanis**: you settled it. Daddy came home. Everybody has to sit down in the kitchen and explain what's going
[00:10:17] **Jason Calacanis**: on. Take us through, you know, how you think about this as ours are. Well, this morning my entire
[00:10:24] **David Sacks**: feed was full of comments by people analysts, consumers, business people and politicians saying
[00:10:34] **David Sacks**: that we can't allow open AI to have a federal bailout. And I think they were kind of connecting
[00:10:40] **David Sacks**: Sam's original comments or prickliness to what Brad talked about like, hey, do they have the
[00:10:44] **David Sacks**: money? Can they justify this with friar's comments that they need a backstop to say, hey,
[00:10:49] **David Sacks**: this company is not solvent. It's going out of business and they're demanding a federal bailout.
[00:10:53] **David Sacks**: So I think that's kind of how the pieces got put together. And what I said is, look, there's
[00:10:57] **David Sacks**: not going to be a federal bailout for AI. Not going to happen. We have five major frontier
[00:11:03] **David Sacks**: model companies right now. And there are new companies being formed all the time. And if one of
[00:11:09] **David Sacks**: them fails, hey, it's going to go out of business and the other ones are going to replace it. So
[00:11:13] **David Sacks**: nobody is talking about a bailout. In fact, I would say that the AI sector is maybe one of the
[00:11:19] **David Sacks**: healthiest, meaning most competitive sectors of the entire American economy right now.
[00:11:24] **David Sacks**: To the extent that you just love ruthless competition driving innovation, that's what we have
[00:11:28] **David Sacks**: right now. So if one of these companies gets over its skis and ends up going bankrupt, the chips
[00:11:33] **David Sacks**: are going to fall where they may. And I've never heard anyone serious disputing that fact. Now,
[00:11:39] **David Sacks**: I also made the point, which I think is important that to give open AI the benefit of the doubt.
[00:11:43] **David Sacks**: I don't think anyone at open AI was asking for a bailout. If you watch the video as Sarah
[00:11:49] **David Sacks**: Fire, she's clearly searching for the right word to describe what she's trying to say. And then
[00:11:55] **David Sacks**: she settles on a word that she now regrets, which is backstop, definitely not the right word.
[00:12:00] **David Sacks**: So I don't think they are asking for a bailout. I don't know what she meant by backstop doesn't
[00:12:05] **David Sacks**: make sense. So I think this is a little bit of a tempest and a teapot. What I think is important.
[00:12:12] **David Sacks**: And I think maybe where she was going is that I do think that we want to make it easier
[00:12:18] **David Sacks**: to build infrastructure in this country. And that means making permitting easier, making power
[00:12:24] **David Sacks**: generation easier. That's all about regulatory reform. And I think that the goal here is to
[00:12:31] **David Sacks**: enable a rapid infrastructure build out without increasing residential rates for electricity,
[00:12:35] **David Sacks**: which nobody wants. And that's in the process of potentially creating a little bit of an
[00:12:39] **David Sacks**: envy backlash is when local communities fear that their electricity rates are going to go up
[00:12:43] **David Sacks**: because someone wants to build a data center. That's the thing we have to combat. But the way that
[00:12:47] **David Sacks**: you solve that problem is by making it easier for these AI companies to stand up their own power
[00:12:52] **David Sacks**: generation behind the meter. And that requires regulatory reform. That's what the president is called
[00:12:56] **David Sacks**: for is allowing the AI companies to do behind the meter. So no one's talking about bailout.
[00:13:01] **David Sacks**: Nobody's talking about backstop. We are talking about making making permitting easier and making it
[00:13:06] **David Sacks**: easier to do build out. So build out not bailout. Yes. Should be our motto here. Build out not bailout.
[00:13:13] **Jason Calacanis**: Now there was a little bit of sort of reading the tea leaves. There have been times when loans were
[00:13:18] **Jason Calacanis**: given to incentivize an industry. So I just want to be clear with you. There's no discussions of
[00:13:23] **David Sacks**: like Selendra, you know, type loans. No, let's discuss any of that with me. So like it's not even
[00:13:29] **David Sacks**: on the radar. I would say from the government standpoint. And why would it be if there's so many
[00:13:33] **Jason Calacanis**: people trying to pour capitalists capital into this Brad and there's so many people trying to buy
[00:13:38] **Jason Calacanis**: your shares in a company making $13 billion that's currently valued at $500 billion,
[00:13:44] **Jason Calacanis**: which I think is like a 30 to 40 price to sell is a ratio. I mean this company is fully
[00:13:48] **Jason Calacanis**: valued and people are still trying to buy shares. So Brad wrap us up here. Yeah. I think I was
[00:13:53] **Brad Gerstner**: brilliantly said by David. Listen, it's a national imperative that we accelerate the build out of
[00:13:57] **Brad Gerstner**: AI infrastructure across the country. I've said before, the $4 trillion that Jensen Huang has
[00:14:04] **Brad Gerstner**: estimated will be built out over the next five years is 10 times the size of the Manhattan
[00:14:09] **Brad Gerstner**: project that was totally federally funded. Okay. And this is all being privately funded.
[00:14:15] **Brad Gerstner**: But it wouldn't be possible without the government, Secretary Wright, others,
[00:14:19] **Brad Gerstner**: Bergram, etc. Clearing out of the way, the regulatory hurdles, you know, you heard on the
[00:14:25] **Brad Gerstner**: pod, same pod that power is really the gating issue here. And so it's been amazing to see what the
[00:14:32] **Brad Gerstner**: federal government is doing. I think that's what Sarah was trying to get to that they need to be
[00:14:36] **Brad Gerstner**: have a public private partnership. They're going to do their job, raise their money, backstop was
[00:14:41] **Brad Gerstner**: not the right choice of words. But they I know and I talked to Sarah this morning about this are
[00:14:47] **Brad Gerstner**: deeply grateful for what the federal government is doing to accelerate the build out of power and
[00:14:53] **Brad Gerstner**: infrastructure. And the federal government could do that without taking risk on their own balance.
[00:14:57] **Brad Gerstner**: In fact, we've seen some of the investments they've made as a result of the Japanese deal they
[00:15:02] **Brad Gerstner**: got on tariffs. They can reinvest those dollars to accelerate some of the nuclear build out,
[00:15:06] **Brad Gerstner**: etc. By the way, Sam just posted something about 15 minutes ago. And he was pretty authoritative
[00:15:12] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: in addressing the three critical questions. The first thing he says is that we will we meaning
[00:15:20] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: open AI will end the year on a 20 billion dollar forward run rate, which means December revenue
[00:15:26] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: will be 1.666 billion at least. So we kind of know where the revenues going from 1.2 to 1.6 over
[00:15:36] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: these next few months, which is a pretty staggering growth rate if they were at 13 and they're going
[00:15:40] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: end of 20. And then he goes and addresses the whole too big to fail and whether they want government
[00:15:45] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: sponsorship and he's pretty unequivocal here. So I think this is a 10% of people. I think people are
[00:15:51] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: people are on pins and needles. They're agitated. Some people have had no gains. Other people have had
[00:15:57] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: incredible gains. Everybody's agitated. I think we we are getting in the
[00:16:03] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: risk off phase for at least two or three months. We will be back firmly in risk on voting
[00:16:10] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: February is my suspicion. But these next few months, I think people will over blow every random
[00:16:15] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: little thing. Well, and in fairness, you know, 1.4 trillion dollars is a very large number. I mean,
[00:16:20] **Jason Calacanis**: this is a number we've never seen. One company say they're going to do a build out of it.
[00:16:25] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Okay. Well, can I take the other side of this? If it is, if I was the US government, to the extent
[00:16:30] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: that we are doing public-private partnerships, if there is a way for US taxpayers to own a piece of
[00:16:35] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: open AI, I would say great. I mean, so Brad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to the
[00:16:41] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Trump. So hold on. So before everybody breathlessly complains, whether you see it or not,
[00:16:48] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: there is an enormous sovereign wealth fund that is being built by President Trump. And it is
[00:16:56] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: for the benefit of all American taxpayers. And so to the extent the people in government could
[00:17:04] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: underwrite an investment structure, like they have done in things like MP materials, which is
[00:17:11] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: way up, things like Intel, which is way up. These guys are like really good smart people,
[00:17:17] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Mike Grimes, Dave Shapiro, Stephen Feinberg, and his team at DOD. They're cutting hard deals,
[00:17:23] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: tough deals. So I don't know if they did do a deal with open AI, I think they probably get the
[00:17:28] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: best of it. And the American taxpayer would win. And I wouldn't be angry at that.
[00:17:33] **Brad Gerstner**: I think as you see from Sam's tweet, they're not looking for the government to invest. They're not
[00:17:38] **Brad Gerstner**: looking for a government bailout. What they are doing, and I think David said it well, is they're
[00:17:44] **Brad Gerstner**: pushing us very hard as a matter of national security and economic growth to go faster, to accelerate,
[00:17:51] **Brad Gerstner**: to build out infrastructure, and to give a little credit where credit is due, right? All of this
[00:17:57] **Brad Gerstner**: build out, right? All of the Stargate stuff that people were laughing about 18 months ago. Thank
[00:18:02] **Brad Gerstner**: God as an American citizen that we are running this fast. China has 100 nuclear fission plants
[00:18:08] **Brad Gerstner**: under construction. And we were sitting on our hands. So I think if anything, they've helped jump,
[00:18:12] **Brad Gerstner**: start that conversation and get us moving faster. And I think that's good for all of us.
[00:18:16] **Jason Calacanis**: Great segue, Brad. Thank you. Jensen told the FT straight up, quote, China is going to win
[00:18:24] **Jason Calacanis**: the AI race. His argument is that US state-by-state regulations and power constraints are making it
[00:18:30] **Jason Calacanis**: harder for USAI companies as we've discussed here countless times. Whereas the CCP is obviously
[00:18:36] **Jason Calacanis**: in interest making it super affordable to run all those GPUs. Nvidia put out the following
[00:18:43] **Jason Calacanis**: statement from him, as I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind American AI. It's vital
[00:18:48] **Jason Calacanis**: that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide. Obviously he's a hundred percent
[00:18:55] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: right. He's a hundred percent right. I don't know if you guys saw, but cursor 2.0 launched this week.
[00:19:01] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: My team at 80 90 use it. It's an incredible product. Guess what they did? They swapped out
[00:19:06] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: and thropic for an open source Chinese model. Yep. Do you know what they're using? Is it like
[00:19:10] **Jason Calacanis**: Kimmy or what is it? I think it's Gwen. I think they're using a spin of coin to be clear. They're
[00:19:14] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: cleansing these Chinese open source models, but they are. I don't know about cursor, but they're
[00:19:19] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: a lot of companies. Yes. And then running them, standing them up themselves obviously. My point
[00:19:24] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: is we are right now running with one hand time behind our back. We are going to have to deal with
[00:19:32] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: 50 different sets of legislation from state legislators who think they know what AI is. They don't.
[00:19:39] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Sax knows. So there should be a federal framework and that should be it. And then meanwhile,
[00:19:46] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: the Chinese open source models get better and better and better and better. And so we're making
[00:19:50] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: technology decisions that tie our wagons to that steel thread. And so Jensen is right. We need to
[00:19:58] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: clean this up quickly. I was a little bit disappointed to see. I thought it was reasonable
[00:20:02] **David Sacks**: for certain politicians, especially Republican ones to say, left there's not going to be a federal
[00:20:08] **David Sacks**: bailout for AI. Great. We all agree. No one's asking for it. But I was a little disappointed to see
[00:20:13] **David Sacks**: that some of them were associating a bailout with a single federal framework as opposed to the
[00:20:19] **David Sacks**: patchwork of 50 state regulatory regimes. Because if Republican governors think that there are the ones
[00:20:24] **David Sacks**: who are going to be writing the rules, they're sorely mistaken about this. 25% of the bills going
[00:20:30] **David Sacks**: through state legislatures are in four states. California, New York, Colorado, and Illinois. In
[00:20:35] **David Sacks**: other words, the biggest blue states. Those also happen to be the states where these big AI
[00:20:41] **David Sacks**: companies are all headquartered with the one exception of XAI, which is in Texas. But these companies
[00:20:47] **David Sacks**: are in California. The blue states have the most market power. And if they end up creating the
[00:20:52] **David Sacks**: regulations, I just think it's naive to think that the AI companies won't write their models to
[00:21:00] **David Sacks**: those regulations of the blue states. I don't think the red states are somehow going to find
[00:21:04] **David Sacks**: themselves exempted from the blue state regulations that are being imposed. And I've talked about
[00:21:08] **David Sacks**: in a previous podcast, how what the blue states are going for here is to reinsert DEI into AI models
[00:21:16] **David Sacks**: to achieve ideological capture. And the way they do this, they don't say we're requiring DEI. They
[00:21:22] **David Sacks**: say that we're prohibiting algorithmic discrimination, which means that the model says something bad
[00:21:26] **David Sacks**: about a protected group. You end up with the same end result, which is, again, ideological capture.
[00:21:31] **David Sacks**: I think all Republicans should be opposed to this. There's only one way to stop it,
[00:21:35] **David Sacks**: which is with federal preemption. Otherwise, the states will do what they want and the blue states
[00:21:38] **David Sacks**: will basically dominate. Now, I think that part of what's going on here is that Republicans have
[00:21:44] **David Sacks**: muscle memory around what happened during the Biden years. And what happened during the Biden
[00:21:49] **David Sacks**: years is that the Biden administration pushed for censorship and shadow banning and
[00:21:56] **David Sacks**: deplatforming all that kind of stuff. They were working very close with big tech companies to push
[00:22:00] **David Sacks**: the censorship agenda. The only pushback that Republicans were able to achieve was at the state
[00:22:05] **David Sacks**: level. And so you had cases like Biden v. Missouri where we had Senator Eric Schmidt was on the pod
[00:22:11] **David Sacks**: talking about that when he was attorney general. And so he was able to make a states rights argument
[00:22:16] **David Sacks**: to push back on the Biden censorship. So I think that Republicans remember that and they think
[00:22:23] **David Sacks**: well, states rights is our solution. But now we have a completely different situation. I mean,
[00:22:28] **David Sacks**: the board's been completely reversed where Republicans are in power in Washington and the states
[00:22:34] **David Sacks**: are making a bunch of bad decisions with respect to AI. And so I think that, to be honest, I think
[00:22:40] **David Sacks**: we need to kind of just realize that. And I think the arguments that make the most sense right now
[00:22:44] **David Sacks**: are the commerce clause arguments where look, the Constitution wants to create a single national
[00:22:50] **David Sacks**: market for interstate commerce, AI clearly qualifies. And let's get President Trump, not Gavin
[00:22:56] **David Sacks**: Newsom or J.B. Pritzker or Kathy Hockle or Jared Polis, the ability to write the rules. Let's have
[00:23:03] **David Sacks**: a single federal framework that will prevent ideological capture of AI. Keep it unbiased, which
[00:23:09] **David Sacks**: every conservative should want. I'll just reiterate again, if you want to see the impact of having
[00:23:14] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: a state set of regulations that basically munge a market up, just go and use your favorite AI
[00:23:21] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: tool and ask what happened when California passed CARB, which are the emission standards that
[00:23:27] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: force the entire American US auto industry to have two sets of cars, one for California and one for
[00:23:32] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: the rest of the market. And what did it do? It completely flipped demand upside down on its head.
[00:23:38] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: And it has made it very difficult for the auto industry to be sustainable. And I think if you
[00:23:43] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: apply that same idea across four states, instead of just one, across the most important technological
[00:23:51] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: revolution we've had, I just don't think it's going to be a good outcome. The steel man first of
[00:23:55] **Jason Calacanis**: that, Chimoff would be, we got rid of Smugg and California and that it did an amazing job
[00:24:01] **Jason Calacanis**: in terms of getting rid of pollution, which also matters. And I'm trying to think of the steel man.
[00:24:06] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Are you sure that that's the steel man that you've come up with or do you think that the tax credits
[00:24:10] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: did that? Do you think making the tops of everything was the way that solves Smugg, or do you
[00:24:18] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: think the $7,500 federal tax credit solves Smugg? Well, no, but the Smugg regulations predated the
[00:24:24] **Jason Calacanis**: EV ones. Those have been going on for decades. So it did get rid of Smugg. So, you know, putting
[00:24:30] **Jason Calacanis**: better using cleaner gas and then having better exhausts on those cars, that would be the steel man
[00:24:37] **Jason Calacanis**: of it. I'm not saying I'm for or against state regulations, but Sachs, have you heard any,
[00:24:45] **Jason Calacanis**: aside from the federalism argument states, right? Have you heard any great defense of states
[00:24:51] **Jason Calacanis**: having some say in how AI is deployed in their communities? Well, they can have some say. There's
[00:24:58] **David Sacks**: definitely areas where you don't preempt. I mean, you have to decide how wide the preemption is,
[00:25:03] **David Sacks**: but when it comes to things like notifications about models, safety, instance, things like
[00:25:08] **David Sacks**: that, it doesn't make sense to have model companies needing to report to 50 different states,
[00:25:13] **David Sacks**: 50 different agencies within those states, each with a different definition of what needs to be
[00:25:17] **David Sacks**: reported, each with different reporting deadlines. Like, why would you have that? It doesn't make any
[00:25:22] **David Sacks**: sense. Why would you allow the big blue states to essentially insert DEI into the models,
[00:25:29] **David Sacks**: which will affect the red states, too? You're not going to be able to keep that out. If California
[00:25:33] **David Sacks**: pushes algorithmic discrimination, Florida and Texas and Arkansas are going to be affected as well.
[00:25:39] **David Sacks**: I think we need to use the opportunity we have right now by the fact that we have a majority in
[00:25:44] **David Sacks**: Washington to set a sensible federal standard that preamps the excesses of the blue states. Look,
[00:25:52] **David Sacks**: the constitutional arguments you can make either way. I personally believe in the commerce clause,
[00:25:56] **David Sacks**: but I think when it comes to the merits of the policy argument, we should let Donald Trump write
[00:26:00] **David Sacks**: these rules. Let me just say one other thing. Part of what's going on here on the right is that
[00:26:04] **David Sacks**: there's so much anger towards the big tech companies for what happened during the by-years with
[00:26:09] **David Sacks**: censorship and de-platforming that I think there's just this knee-jerk reaction where we don't
[00:26:14] **David Sacks**: want to do anything to help the tech companies. We just want to hurt them. I think we just have to
[00:26:18] **David Sacks**: have a more nuanced approach than that because the question is, what will the result be? Look,
[00:26:23] **David Sacks**: no one was more critical of the big tech companies engaging in censorship in Silicon Valley than me
[00:26:28] **David Sacks**: when Donald Trump was kicked off every big tech platform. I think I was literally the only
[00:26:33] **David Sacks**: person in Silicon Valley who was publicly objecting to that on this podcast. So I'm perfectly
[00:26:39] **David Sacks**: willing to criticize the big tech companies when they make a mistake, but when they're engaging in
[00:26:45] **David Sacks**: healthy competition and innovation and we want to prevent ideological capture and that's what we're
[00:26:51] **David Sacks**: talking about. Let's make sure it ends up in the right place not just engaging this knee-jerk
[00:26:56] **David Sacks**: anti-tech reaction which will play into the hands of the blue state governors. We're in this race
[00:27:03] **Brad Gerstner**: to win AI globally and one of the major concerns I have is that AI is becoming deeply unpopular in
[00:27:10] **Brad Gerstner**: America, right? Silicon Valley is losing the battle around AI. Dumaers are now scaring people
[00:27:17] **Brad Gerstner**: about jobs. They think all these job cuts that are going on in America are the result of AI.
[00:27:21] **Brad Gerstner**: And number two, they're seeing their electric bills go up and they think that's also the result of AI.
[00:27:26] **Brad Gerstner**: I've talked with a lot of Republican Senator and House members who say they are afraid to mention
[00:27:31] **Brad Gerstner**: the words AI because their popularity ratings go down. We need to get on the other side of that
[00:27:36] **Brad Gerstner**: because that is a losing proposition for America. If what takes hold here is that, you know,
[00:27:42] **Brad Gerstner**: it's politically popular, right? To push back against AI, the David, I think that's what you're
[00:27:48] **Brad Gerstner**: seeing at the state levels with Republican governors as well. And so, you know, I think both of those
[00:27:53] **Brad Gerstner**: are false narratives, but we need to get on the other side. In China, they're not going to slow down.
[00:27:58] **Brad Gerstner**: So if we do a known goal here in slowdown because we think somehow that this is the path to
[00:28:04] **Brad Gerstner**: greater economic growth, it's going to be a real problem, both national security as well as
[00:28:08] **Brad Gerstner**: economic security, three, five years down the line. Yeah, can I build on that actually? So in
[00:28:13] **David Sacks**: terms of the public discourse, it's true that the Duma narratives have had this tremendous
[00:28:17] **David Sacks**: effect that you can see in the poll numbers and then the politicians feel like they can basically
[00:28:21] **David Sacks**: play into that in one way or another. But where do these narratives come from?
[00:28:26] **David Sacks**: Three big tech billionaires who are on the left contributed over a billion dollars to these
[00:28:31] **David Sacks**: Duma think tanks, basically with Dustin Moskovitz, Jan Tallinn, and Vitalik Buterin. And from
[00:28:38] **David Sacks**: open philanthropy and from some of these other entities, they have spun up hundreds of these
[00:28:42] **David Sacks**: astroturfed organizations that are spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars to spread
[00:28:47] **David Sacks**: these Duma narratives. A writer named Neurit Weisblatt on Substack has basically broken down
[00:28:53] **David Sacks**: how this all works. It's actually a great article I'll put on the screen. So people need to understand
[00:28:59] **David Sacks**: that these narratives are coming from somewhere. They're astroturfed. I don't think they're true.
[00:29:04] **David Sacks**: And the narratives are contradictory. So let me give you an example. Right now, the two biggest
[00:29:08] **David Sacks**: narratives that we're seeing on social media and in mainstream media are number one, the idea
[00:29:13] **David Sacks**: that there's a huge AI bubble right now. In other words, it's all totally fake. The other
[00:29:17] **David Sacks**: biggest narrative is that AI is on the verge of superintelligence and we're all going to get
[00:29:22] **David Sacks**: replaced. Also fake. In other words, AI is completely real and super powerful. These two things
[00:29:27] **David Sacks**: are contradictory. If it's a bubble, it's not going to be on the verge of superintelligence.
[00:29:31] **David Sacks**: And if AI is really that powerful, then obviously on some level, this economic activity is justified.
[00:29:37] **David Sacks**: So these narratives are completely contradictory. I think that is possible to believe in neither one
[00:29:43] **David Sacks**: of them, which is where I'm at. But it makes no sense for people to believe in both. And you literally
[00:29:48] **David Sacks**: have the same people on social media and in mainstream media pushing both of these Duma narratives.
[00:29:54] **David Sacks**: So I think we need to increase somehow our immune defenses or antibodies. We need to improve
[00:29:59] **David Sacks**: our antibodies to I think these memes that are being pushed out by groups that have these weird
[00:30:08] **David Sacks**: Duma radiologies like effective altruism. And they literally just want progress to stop
[00:30:14] **David Sacks**: on AI. And if we do that, like Brad's saying, China will end up winning this AI race. Progress
[00:30:19] **David Sacks**: in AI is not going to stop. It'll just all be in China. Brad, let's talk brass tax before
[00:30:25] **Jason Calacanis**: we move on to our next topic about chat GPT and their revenue. If they're at 20 billion in revenue
[00:30:31] **Jason Calacanis**: run rate, I think it's pretty well known. Their majority of their revenue is consumer 75% is the
[00:30:39] **Jason Calacanis**: number I heard. You could tell me if that aligns with your estimates as well. And cost 20 bucks a
[00:30:45] **Jason Calacanis**: month, 240 a year. That's about 60 million paid subscriptions a year. And then on the other side,
[00:30:52] **Jason Calacanis**: you got an anthropic, which is kind of got the opposite right there. They're mostly EPIs.
[00:30:56] **Jason Calacanis**: And do those roughly correlate with what you know, Brad? Well, I would just say they correlate
[00:31:03] **Brad Gerstner**: with what the information is reported as leaked data from both companies. And that makes them both
[00:31:09] **Brad Gerstner**: the fastest growing companies in the history of Silicon Valley. But specifically the 75% coming from
[00:31:14] **Jason Calacanis**: consumer from open AI. I think it's well known. More comes from consumer at open AI and more comes
[00:31:19] **Brad Gerstner**: from enterprise at two challenging questions for you. Since you have a big bet here, Google, Apple
[00:31:26] **Jason Calacanis**: make these products free. They have pretty robust ad networks. That's a massive headwind. And then
[00:31:32] **Jason Calacanis**: on top of that in the startup community, we just talked about cursor. People are not trusting open AI
[00:31:38] **Jason Calacanis**: and their API anymore because they know open AI is creating competing services. And so there's a big
[00:31:44] **Jason Calacanis**: movement in the startup community to not use open AI's API products. How confident are you
[00:31:51] **Jason Calacanis**: that with those two headwinds? Free for consumers and better products, right? Gemini is a great
[00:31:57] **Jason Calacanis**: product. Rocks a great product. Claude's a great product. A lot of great product out there.
[00:32:01] **Jason Calacanis**: And I don't think consumers can tell the difference. Why would they pay 240 if they can get it for
[00:32:04] **Jason Calacanis**: free from Google? And then second, startups are realizing, hey, Sam has to make a lot of money.
[00:32:11] **Jason Calacanis**: Therefore, he's going to do it. Microsoft did. There was a company called Lotus 123. There's
[00:32:16] **Jason Calacanis**: a company called WordPerfect. Now we're on the Microsoft platform windows and then Microsoft
[00:32:21] **Jason Calacanis**: killed them. People right now are experiencing that from open AI. How concerned are you about the
[00:32:26] **Jason Calacanis**: revenue growth? Yeah, I mean, listen, I'm betting in the super cycle. This is the biggest super cycle
[00:32:31] **Brad Gerstner**: of all of our lives. I'm an investor in open AI and anthropic and Google and in Microsoft and
[00:32:36] **Brad Gerstner**: Nvidia, et cetera. And so I don't think you have to make the call right now. One of these,
[00:32:41] **Brad Gerstner**: you know, companies winning the fact of the matter as SAC said, we have one of the most vibrant
[00:32:46] **Brad Gerstner**: and competitive ecosystems in AI in the world. I love the fact that Sundar is coming off them at
[00:32:52] **Brad Gerstner**: swinging. I think Gemini three is going to be great at Google. They may in fact make it free.
[00:32:57] **Brad Gerstner**: I think Apple, I love seeing Apple pay Google to, you know, make Siri better. I think that's
[00:33:02] **Brad Gerstner**: going to be a great consumer experience. And the only way that open AI wins is they got to build
[00:33:06] **Brad Gerstner**: a product that we all love. You've seen those cohort curves. The reality is they are the verb
[00:33:12] **Brad Gerstner**: at the moment. It's theirs to lose in consumer. The cohort curves are things of dreams, right? This
[00:33:18] **Brad Gerstner**: is the retention rate, the engagement rate is people stay with the service longer. And then by
[00:33:22] **Brad Gerstner**: the way, anthropics numbers, despite cursor, doing some of their own thing, anthropics numbers
[00:33:28] **Brad Gerstner**: are off the charts. I think that this market is as big or bigger than current estimates are out
[00:33:34] **Brad Gerstner**: there, but it's not going to be a straight line up into the right. We're going to have these
[00:33:37] **Brad Gerstner**: moments as Jamal said of risk off panic, just as we did with internet, just as we did with mobile,
[00:33:43] **Brad Gerstner**: just as we did with cloud. The key here is as an investor's conviction, there is a massive
[00:33:49] **Brad Gerstner**: conviction tax to be paid, right? If you lack conviction and sell when these things are down,
[00:33:54] **Brad Gerstner**: I'm going to bet on the super cycle, but I'm betting over a much longer period of time than most
[00:33:58] **Brad Gerstner**: people. And amongst the startups out there, they basically believe cloud is not trying to take their
[00:34:04] **Jason Calacanis**: business. And cloud has been very careful to say, hey, we're not going to encroach into the
[00:34:08] **Jason Calacanis**: application layer. So, all right. Yeah. The most impressive revenue chart when you showed that
[00:34:15] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: leak from open AI was anthropic. If that revenue chart is real, what's really impressive is
[00:34:22] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: anthropic is not really in a j curve at all. And they get to very similar points of free cash
[00:34:30] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: flow, but will not have burned through near as much capital to get there. That's my singularly
[00:34:36] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: interesting observation about this chart. Can I say again, those numbers are real as reported
[00:34:43] **Brad Gerstner**: by the information, but what I would say about that is this, I've been forecasting companies for
[00:34:48] **Brad Gerstner**: 25 years. I know the numbers today. Sam just told us 20 billion dollar run rate and a year for
[00:34:55] **Brad Gerstner**: open AI. Everybody who is forecasting three years out on these companies is totally guessing, right?
[00:35:03] **Brad Gerstner**: Like that's why I said, time is on your side if you're betting over a five to 10 year horizon,
[00:35:08] **Brad Gerstner**: but if you think with precision that the company itself can forecast what's going to be happening
[00:35:13] **Brad Gerstner**: in three years, I think you're misleading yourself, right? So we'll see. I think it's going to be
[00:35:18] **Brad Gerstner**: a lot bigger, could be even bigger than those numbers. But you know, those forecasts are highly
[00:35:23] **Brad Gerstner**: uncertain because the rate of growth has never been seen before. How do you think about expenses then?
[00:35:27] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Because you're going to have to have some sense of whether this spend is accurate or reasonable.
[00:35:32] **Brad Gerstner**: I think you have to build in an expense structure that has the flexibility. So if the numbers don't
[00:35:37] **Brad Gerstner**: show up that you have the ability to extend your, you know, your obligation. So that's why I was saying,
[00:35:43] **Brad Gerstner**: I don't think there's 1.4 trillion. I think it's kind of the red herring out there. I think it's
[00:35:48] **Brad Gerstner**: kind of a fake made up number. It's all of the obligations of all of the deals that have been
[00:35:53] **Brad Gerstner**: announced and the truth of the matter is only a portion of that is born by open AI and I'm certain
[00:35:58] **Brad Gerstner**: there's flexibility in all of those deals to match the expenses with the revenue side. But listen,
[00:36:04] **Brad Gerstner**: let's deal with the opposite case, Chema. Let's just say that all of these revenues start flatlining
[00:36:10] **Brad Gerstner**: for Anthropic, for X, for, you know, for Google people aren't willing to pay for these products,
[00:36:15] **Brad Gerstner**: then our, then our CapEx build out for AI is going to be a lot slower because at the end of the day,
[00:36:20] **Brad Gerstner**: there's got to be somebody either in the enterprise or a consumer willing to pay real money to pay
[00:36:25] **Brad Gerstner**: back all of this infrastructure build out or it doesn't happen. Well said. And, hey, just a quick
[00:36:31] **Jason Calacanis**: plug here. We're going to have an amazing holiday party come spend another Christmas with your
[00:36:36] **Jason Calacanis**: besties at the all-in holiday Travaganza with Killtony. Yeah, thank you. You got the announcement.
[00:36:44] **Jason Calacanis**: We're burning it down this year. Joining us on stage, it's going to be a sh** show.
[00:36:49] **Jason Calacanis**: The whole stuff, Killtony, is going to mercilessly roast everyone in Silicon Valley and the besties,
[00:36:57] **Jason Calacanis**: Tony Hingecliff is coming to the Bay Area. We're going to have the same great stuff we always do,
[00:37:02] **Jason Calacanis**: Casino and I, it's Pope Bernard. Are we going to do the Jays? You guys have the courage to go
[00:37:08] **Jason Calacanis**: up there and do a little set? I'm going to do a set. That's what we're going to do. It's
[00:37:12] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: going to be the four of us. People are going to come up and do a set. We're going to roast each
[00:37:15] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: other. It's going to be absolutely brutal and fun. So you can- I'm going to have to bring in some
[00:37:21] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: firepower. I'm going to have to bring in my- I know exactly what you're calling Kevin Hart, aren't you?
[00:37:27] **Jason Calacanis**: That's fine. I'm going to get your pal. I got a way to get to your pal.
[00:37:32] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: So I'm going to get my own writing team going. You guys were all there. I mean, not through a birthday
[00:37:37] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: party for me. What was it? Five years ago? Three years? Four years ago. And Kevin and Sky and Diego,
[00:37:42] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: they all flew up from LA, Al, Robo. We all did speeches. Sacks did a great roast. J. Cal did one.
[00:37:50] **Jason Calacanis**: Friedberg did one. Not did an incredible one. And then Kevin just adlibs and destroyed everyone.
[00:37:59] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Singularly destroyed everybody in the room. And the water is like a- like a sniper.
[00:38:05] **Jason Calacanis**: She said that. I'm going to do a quick tight of five minutes on Yorapisha Medili, which is
[00:38:11] **Jason Calacanis**: so small in the pathetic. And so go to allin.com slash events and you get to come. Make jokes about
[00:38:20] **David Sacks**: Shamat's tiny penis. Join us for the all-inspectacular. That's worth the price of admission alone.
[00:38:27] **Jason Calacanis**: Allin.com slash events is going to be off the chain. If you want to do something fun,
[00:38:32] **Jason Calacanis**: you know, it's hard to throw a holiday party. Why not buy a 20 tickets? You bring your whole
[00:38:37] **Jason Calacanis**: company and you can buy a group ticket, individual tickets available, group tickets available.
[00:38:43] **Jason Calacanis**: And you know, you get your logo on the step and repeat. All kinds of great stuff.
[00:38:46] **Brad Gerstner**: outsourced your holiday party to us. We'll make it back. I'll do that at 8090. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:38:52] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: 8090. You know, just outsource it. Sacks. You could outsource it for your
[00:38:58] **Jason Calacanis**: 370 domestic staff. They can all probably get the- all right. Listen, we got to talk about
[00:39:04] **Jason Calacanis**: markets. We got Brad here, our fifth bestie stock market pulling back. As Shamat just said,
[00:39:10] **Jason Calacanis**: maybe we're going to be risk off and we have been getting a lot of data, a lot of hand ringing
[00:39:16] **Jason Calacanis**: going on Brad, GDP growth. Hey, maybe that's mostly due to AI, the unemployment rates taking up,
[00:39:22] **Jason Calacanis**: inflation's taking up, lots of concerning signs. Let's help us make sense of this, Brad.
[00:39:29] **Brad Gerstner**: I think, you know, Shamat teed this up perfectly, which is, you know, let's rewind the clock
[00:39:34] **Brad Gerstner**: a little bit to April of this year. I think on an intraday basis, the NASDAQ was down 20%
[00:39:40] **Brad Gerstner**: year to date in April. We're now up 20%. So 40% move higher in a few months. Same with the S&P.
[00:39:48] **Brad Gerstner**: I think it was down over 10%. Now it's up 40% on the year. So we've had some pretty massive moves.
[00:39:54] **Brad Gerstner**: And I think you have to, you know, reflect on where we are, you know, and we used to do this on
[00:40:00] **Brad Gerstner**: on market checks when I was on. And you say, you know, where is altimeter? And so early in the year,
[00:40:06] **Brad Gerstner**: we're worried about tariffs. Altimeter was positioned small, right? By May, we thought they
[00:40:12] **Brad Gerstner**: would land the plane with the best and consensus, you know, on trade, we'd get the big beautiful bill
[00:40:17] **Brad Gerstner**: past. And we went to kind of extra large positioning. And we've been there most of the year.
[00:40:22] **Brad Gerstner**: And so now we're back to kind of Shamat just now that, you know, we're back to kind of medium,
[00:40:27] **Brad Gerstner**: medium small positioning in the market. And I'll walk through a couple of slides as to the
[00:40:31] **Brad Gerstner**: reasoning for that. Maybe we can kick it around a little bit. The first one is just there's growing
[00:40:36] **Brad Gerstner**: signs, you know, the consumer is pulling back. And, you know, you heard it out of Chipotle,
[00:40:42] **Brad Gerstner**: you heard it out of Kava, you heard it out of NCL, you heard it out of JetBlue. And, and, you know,
[00:40:47] **Brad Gerstner**: the nature of it is we have this two-tier economy. The low end consumer is fault,
[00:40:51] **Brad Gerstner**: reading the higher end consumer is hanging in there. But the consumer things making people nervous.
[00:40:55] **Brad Gerstner**: Now, compounding that is US credit card delinquencies are now back to, you know, 2009 levels.
[00:41:04] **Brad Gerstner**: Right. And so you have, okay, consumer cracking a little bit, delinquencies, you know,
[00:41:09] **Brad Gerstner**: and now we're seeing regional banks roll over, etc. We're seeing the credit markets beginning
[00:41:14] **Brad Gerstner**: to crack a little bit, credit spreads blowing out a little bit. And then if you go to this next slide,
[00:41:19] **Brad Gerstner**: you know, this goes to what Sachs has talked a lot about on this pod that we're still in highly
[00:41:24] **Brad Gerstner**: restrictive territory when you look at the 10-year tips. You know, the Fed is still, you know,
[00:41:30] **Brad Gerstner**: got the market tight because they're seeing, you know, the market at all time highs, they're seeing
[00:41:35] **Brad Gerstner**: AI stocks rip. But under the surface, I think there's a lot of concern and question about what's
[00:41:40] **Brad Gerstner**: going on. The good news about this is we still have firepower. So what's going on in this earnings
[00:41:46] **Brad Gerstner**: season? You know, this next slide basically earnings have come in really strong. You know, so we have
[00:41:52] **Brad Gerstner**: 70% of companies that are beating. They're beating by wide margins, you know, in earnings.
[00:41:59] **Brad Gerstner**: But if you look at the forecast, you know, basically, earnings have come in about 11% higher than
[00:42:06] **Brad Gerstner**: last year. And the stocks are up about 13 or 14%. But the real question is as we roll into next year.
[00:42:12] **Brad Gerstner**: And so, you know, Scott Besson on the one hand is saying, listen, in Q1, we're going to have
[00:42:18] **Brad Gerstner**: some big tax refunds because of no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. And he thinks that'll give
[00:42:24] **Brad Gerstner**: it a boost. But clearly, you hear them pounding the table that we need to get rates down. I tend
[00:42:29] **Brad Gerstner**: to agree. The low end consumer who pays a lot on their credit cards on their car loan, et cetera,
[00:42:35] **Brad Gerstner**: is clearly hurting. We see these layoffs, these layoffs are hurting some of these people as well.
[00:42:41] **Brad Gerstner**: And so when you look at the multiples of the market, how do we look at it from an
[00:42:46] **Brad Gerstner**: ultimate perspective? We still believe that owning all of compute like we have for three years and
[00:42:52] **Brad Gerstner**: this AI trade has room to run. But they're obviously multiples have come up a lot. I talked about a
[00:42:57] **Brad Gerstner**: 40% move from the bottom this year. And so you can just take your position size and make it a little
[00:43:03] **Brad Gerstner**: bit smaller. So in the world of less or more, I think Chamos exactly right. There's a pause as we
[00:43:08] **Brad Gerstner**: head in over the course of the next couple months, reflected by the stuff that we're doing.
[00:43:13] **Brad Gerstner**: But I do think the economy is set up as we head into next year. There's been a total decoupling.
[00:43:19] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Yeah. It used to be the case that as goes Main Street, so goes Wall Street or vice versa.
[00:43:24] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: The unfortunate reality is that there's a handful of companies that have bids that are as you
[00:43:29] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: said, totally speculative and well into the future. But they are so well bid and they're so highly
[00:43:36] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: value that they drag the entire indices forward. Even though underneath the waterline,
[00:43:41] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: you're leaving 493 companies behind. And the reality is that those companies that more
[00:43:46] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: accurately reflect what's happening to middle income America are not doing so well. And so we need
[00:43:53] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: to find some visible wins in the domestic policy arena. I think that that's what we need now.
[00:44:01] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Because if you think of each year of a presidency as an act in three parts,
[00:44:06] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: I think act one was tariffs. I think act two has been foreign policy.
[00:44:11] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: And now it's an opportunity for act three to refocus on domestic earnings and
[00:44:19] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: the domestic wealth effect of middle income Americans. I think that's what has to happen.
[00:44:23] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: And there's a lot of clever ways, by the way, that we can do this. I've mentioned this before.
[00:44:30] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: But I think the really interesting opportunity for us is to use the money that's been committed
[00:44:37] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: by all of these countries as part of their trade negotiations. Like if you add up the money that
[00:44:43] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: was committed from Japan to South Korea to the Middle Eastern countries, you're talking trillions
[00:44:48] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: of dollars. I think it's like 3.2 trillion is the number. So it's an enormous amount of capital
[00:44:55] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: that can improve the state of earnings of the middle class. And I think we need to figure
[00:45:01] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: out a way to more aggressively put that money to work now. I think that that's what needs to happen.
[00:45:06] **Jason Calacanis**: I think if you look at some of these other markets, it's really incredible. Bitcoin is about to
[00:45:10] **Jason Calacanis**: break through 100,000 to the downside, which I think is a psychological barrier that probably
[00:45:17] **Jason Calacanis**: has another 5 or 10% more to run. There's a dispersion happening in the mag 7 as of this past quarter
[00:45:22] **Jason Calacanis**: earnings. So I think all of it has to get sorted out. You nailed it. 29 days ago, I talked to you guys
[00:45:28] **Jason Calacanis**: a little bit about the net approval rating here and how the country's feeling. And you can see
[00:45:33] **Jason Calacanis**: Trump's net approval rating 9.4. We're going to get into the election as well because it ductiles
[00:45:37] **Jason Calacanis**: really nicely with this discussion. It's gotten worse. Here's the numbers from November. It's gotten
[00:45:43] **Jason Calacanis**: 30% worse now. Trump's down 13%. I attributed, I think, to the fact that we've had all this layoff
[00:45:51] **Jason Calacanis**: news inflation ticked up to 3%. Everybody knows it was down at 2.3. We had made great progress on it,
[00:45:56] **Jason Calacanis**: but now it went back up. And there's a lot of survey data going on right now. And I think
[00:46:03] **Jason Calacanis**: if you look at this next chart, it's super interesting. What gets all the press is the foreign
[00:46:07] **Jason Calacanis**: policy, right? We're talking about the war is ending and great job in the Middle East for Trump and
[00:46:12] **Jason Calacanis**: Jared and the team. Border security immigration. Of course, a big win in terms of shutting the
[00:46:19] **Jason Calacanis**: pit controversial on ice, but that's my personal stuff. So I'll leave it out here and we'll just
[00:46:23] **Jason Calacanis**: talk about breast tax. If you look at where the country feels Trump has fallen short, it's where
[00:46:30] **Jason Calacanis**: he's strongest or where he was elected for being so strong. Look at these last three here,
[00:46:36] **Jason Calacanis**: Tremoff, the economy. 63% believe Trump is falling short. Looking out for the middle class,
[00:46:42] **Jason Calacanis**: this is the one that should be the most disturbing. 65% of the country believes he's falling short
[00:46:47] **Jason Calacanis**: and inflation in the cost of living 66%. If you look at this next chart, this one has been trending
[00:46:54] **Jason Calacanis**: online. And I've been talking about unemployment and I've been attributing it to AI. I know some
[00:46:59] **Jason Calacanis**: people think I'm crying wolf here or I'm the boy who cried wolf, but the statistics are starting
[00:47:04] **Jason Calacanis**: to trend towards my position, I believe. And if you look at people who are age 20 to 24, they're at
[00:47:10] **Jason Calacanis**: 9.2% unemployment and it is spiking. Why is it spiking? I can tell you from the front lines,
[00:47:18] **Jason Calacanis**: hiring young people and being at startups with young people in them and talking to them about
[00:47:24] **Jason Calacanis**: their contemporaries as companies cut and they use AI to solve problems, they're saying hiring
[00:47:31] **Jason Calacanis**: young people and training them is not as rewarding or efficient as training an AI to do the same
[00:47:39] **Jason Calacanis**: task. And why do you keep thinking it's AI? Even the Amazon cuts Andy Jassy on the earnings call
[00:47:45] **David Sacks**: said, this is not AI. This is us digesting all this hiring from Zurp and DEI. Yeah, I can answer
[00:47:52] **Jason Calacanis**: that. Yeah, for sure he did say that. He did also say in his memo before that that he thought
[00:47:58] **Jason Calacanis**: there would be a lot of changes because of AI and they had the leak memo that they would not be
[00:48:02] **Jason Calacanis**: hiring those. But I'm talking here specifically about youth people. And so I'll take Jassy at his
[00:48:06] **Jason Calacanis**: word, those 30,000 people are just redundancies. But what I'm seeing on the ground because I work
[00:48:12] **Jason Calacanis**: with startups and I work with young folks who are in them, their contemporaries are not finding
[00:48:17] **Jason Calacanis**: jobs in the companies that we see and the companies that are selling technology solutions are getting
[00:48:23] **Jason Calacanis**: rid of what I'll call the entry level white collar work. In addition to this, student loan delinquencies
[00:48:30] **Jason Calacanis**: also going up massively. They had a big hiatus. Yeah, but it doesn't this indicate that there's no
[00:48:36] **David Sacks**: ROI to this expensive degree. And a lot of cases that these kids are being sold. They're being
[00:48:42] **David Sacks**: foisted all this debt. This has been going on. Exactly. Before November of 2022 when Chattachee
[00:48:47] **David Sacks**: P. Launch, I don't think AI has had enough time to have a huge impact on this. Yeah, in this case,
[00:48:54] **Jason Calacanis**: I think you're wrong respectfully, even though you're the ZAr of AI. I'm seeing it with young folks
[00:48:58] **Jason Calacanis**: and I'm seeing it with the software that the companies I'm investing in are deploying in other
[00:49:03] **Jason Calacanis**: companies. But we'll see who's right in the coming months and that inflation back up to 3%
[00:49:08] **Jason Calacanis**: and so this is going to make it particularly hard to cut rates because the reason when we go back
[00:49:14] **Jason Calacanis**: to slide number three there, the reason why people feel Trump has fallen so short on the economy
[00:49:21] **Jason Calacanis**: and taking care of the middle class is because of inflation. Trump said over and over again and
[00:49:26] **Jason Calacanis**: some people in the administration have been very publicly gaslighting in my opinion. The country
[00:49:31] **Jason Calacanis**: is saying, hey, inflation is not happening. Inflation is happening. And Trump sold people that
[00:49:37] **Jason Calacanis**: prices would go down. We're back up to 3% inflation folks. Not only is it not going down, it's going
[00:49:43] **Jason Calacanis**: up. And I think when you put together what people are seeing, this focus on a big ballroom being
[00:49:51] **Jason Calacanis**: at it, focus on tariffs, things that Americans are not seeing hit their wages and they're seeing
[00:49:58] **Jason Calacanis**: their kids not be able to get jobs that 9%. This is what's concerning Americans. Trump has failed
[00:50:04] **Jason Calacanis**: the middle class. That's the bottom line here. I don't think that that's true. The country does 66%
[00:50:11] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: of them. I think everybody can find a piece of data to hang their bias on. And I think that what
[00:50:19] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: this most recent spade of elections show is that most people are looking for some form of a price
[00:50:28] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: break. And so if you're a New York mayoral candidate and you offer giveaways, you get a lot of
[00:50:34] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: attention. If you're running for governor and you offer giveaways, you get a lot of attention.
[00:50:40] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: The question is why is that happening? And I think it's fair to say that the reason why that's
[00:50:44] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: happening is that we have now spent a lot of time setting the table for a wave of domestic policy
[00:50:55] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: initiatives. And I think now is just the opportunity to follow through on those. I think that what
[00:51:01] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: we need to do is we need to just figure out where the pressure is. And I think Trump is doing
[00:51:06] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: this. So for example, today he announced the Eli Lilly and Noah Nordes could be selling
[00:51:10] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: GLP ones for like $149 a dose. I think that's good. Is it as expansive? I think it could be
[00:51:18] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: probably more expansive. But there are all of these other programs that I think need to get addressed.
[00:51:23] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: The student loan thing is a key one. It's time for legislation that says we're going to stop
[00:51:28] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: federally undriding these things. Force it into the public market. Force it into the open.
[00:51:34] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Allow transparent pricing of loans and risk. And you can stop that curve dead in its tracks.
[00:51:41] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: We need to clean up the AI stuff. So there's a bunch of things now where when the government shutdown
[00:51:45] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: ends, we just got to get to its legislative agenda and start to fix domestic policy. But you can't
[00:51:50] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: do that when folks won't even come together or folks won't even end the shutdown. So I think
[00:51:55] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: which isn't part of this is a frustration that's going to keep brewing that I think is less
[00:52:00] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: of a reflection on him. But more reflection on the point where we're at is that people want
[00:52:04] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: these structural problems fixed that can only happen through legislation. But that can't happen
[00:52:09] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: if the House and the Senate are not even convening because there's still a shutdown.
[00:52:12] **Jason Calacanis**: Yeah. And people are seeing equity holders like us, people in crypto get rich. We're all up 20,
[00:52:20] **Jason Calacanis**: 30% this year. And the working man in this country and the working woman is not. That's the truth
[00:52:26] **Jason Calacanis**: of it. And I think that's why and 60% by the way, 65% of the country blame the Republicans for the
[00:52:32] **Jason Calacanis**: shutdown. And people aren't getting food stamps. And you know, people aren't getting paid. And people
[00:52:38] **Jason Calacanis**: see their healthcare prices are about to spike. So we're doing all these tax cuts. It's great that
[00:52:43] **Jason Calacanis**: the economy's ripping for equity holders. But there's a reason why two thirds of the country feels
[00:52:48] **Jason Calacanis**: this administration has failed the working man. It's time to get back to work. It's time for Trump
[00:52:53] **Jason Calacanis**: and his group to get focused on the people who put him there. Not just the people like us who are
[00:52:59] **Jason Calacanis**: extremely affluent already. What do you think, Brett? If you're right. And we have inflation over
[00:53:05] **Brad Gerstner**: 3% next November. And you have higher youth unemployment. And the economy is only growing
[00:53:13] **Brad Gerstner**: 1.5% and interest rates stay high. Then I think it'll be a rough midterm for the Republicans.
[00:53:21] **Brad Gerstner**: I don't actually think that's the flight path for the country. I actually think you are going to
[00:53:25] **Brad Gerstner**: get three to four rate cuts. I actually think you are going to see a reacceleration of GDP. I don't
[00:53:31] **Brad Gerstner**: think that these job cuts are the result of AI. But that's what makes a market. I think you heard
[00:53:38] **Brad Gerstner**: the president say after the elections this week that, you know, that there are a lot of things
[00:53:43] **Brad Gerstner**: around affordability that got to be delivered that aren't being delivered. And that number 1
[00:53:48] **Brad Gerstner**: affordability issue starts with interest rates being lower. And he's been pounding the table on
[00:53:52] **Brad Gerstner**: that all year long. But listen, I think a big mistake by Republicans in this last election cycle
[00:53:59] **Brad Gerstner**: is they weren't talking about affordability. And the people they lost to were talking about
[00:54:04] **Brad Gerstner**: affordability. So I think on that score, you're correct. But I happen to think that inflation
[00:54:11] **Brad Gerstner**: is going to continue rolling over. I think you see some one time effects in here. And so I'll take
[00:54:16] **Brad Gerstner**: the under Jason with you. And you can I can have a little sideways. I'm just sharing the under next
[00:54:22] **Brad Gerstner**: year. So can I respond? Of course. Yeah. That's why we're here. Yeah. You're really good at finding
[00:54:26] **David Sacks**: these cherry-pick charts. So let me show you a couple of them. So with respect to the job.
[00:54:32] **Jason Calacanis**: Well, you find, like Jamal said, you find charts or polls that support the point you're trying to
[00:54:37] **Jason Calacanis**: make, which is fine. But let me just show you a couple of the ones to provide some balance.
[00:54:40] **David Sacks**: So US white collar jobs is a percent of total employment in the US. Very steady line. You see
[00:54:47] **David Sacks**: a blip there around COVID because so many blue collar jobs were lost. So that created the
[00:54:52] **David Sacks**: percentage of white collar to bounce up. But post-COVID has been on a very stable trajectory.
[00:54:57] **David Sacks**: If it were true that we were seeing massive AI job loss, you would see the percent of white
[00:55:02] **David Sacks**: collar jobs dropping in the economy. That does not happen. Okay. And every time there is some sort
[00:55:08] **David Sacks**: of job loss story, you glom onto it being AI-related like you do with Amazon. And then Andy
[00:55:13] **David Sacks**: Jazzy comes out and refutes that. Then you're like, oh, no, I'm talking about spring in the future.
[00:55:17] **David Sacks**: So like you want to talk about your chart here. You'd like to talk about your chart.
[00:55:20] **Jason Calacanis**: Is that chart ends in the first quarter of 2025? So it's missing the last two quarters.
[00:55:26] **Jason Calacanis**: So now you're saying that all of a sudden this, this has just happened in the last six months.
[00:55:30] **David Sacks**: No, no, it's just, it's flat. You can see it's flat there for the four years. The percentage
[00:55:34] **David Sacks**: on your own chart. And it's that only goes to Q1. But sure, keep going. I don't see a big change here
[00:55:39] **David Sacks**: in the percent of white collar jobs. Yeah, I'm not even sure this is relevant without the last
[00:55:45] **Jason Calacanis**: course. It is. If there was some sort of job shock in the economy, it would be white collar jobs
[00:55:49] **David Sacks**: who'd be affected, right? Well, I think the white collar jobs. You keep young people over the
[00:55:54] **Jason Calacanis**: place of the narrative. Whenever we point out that I think it's happening with young folks. And
[00:55:59] **Jason Calacanis**: then the number of layoffs right now is the largest number of layoffs we've had in a quarter
[00:56:02] **Jason Calacanis**: since 2003. So this has been a lot of layoffs. I know it's hard to hear sacks, but this has
[00:56:09] **Jason Calacanis**: been the largest number of layoffs in 20 years. It's not hard to hear. I think, look,
[00:56:14] **David Sacks**: you keep bringing up these anecdotes. And the plural of anecdotes is not data. So in any event,
[00:56:19] **David Sacks**: when I look at this chart, I see that there is no job loss shock in the economy. And that's
[00:56:26] **David Sacks**: what you've been claiming. And every time we specifically refute your anecdote, you're like,
[00:56:29] **David Sacks**: oh, no, no, that's going to happen in the future. So you don't know what the cause of that is.
[00:56:35] **David Sacks**: The cause of that could be the fact that all these kids graduating from college are woke and
[00:56:39] **David Sacks**: major in degrees that don't have economic value. You don't know what the problem is.
[00:56:44] **David Sacks**: You're just glomming on to this AI story because you just like it. You like this narrative.
[00:56:48] **David Sacks**: And you're, I'm just, I told you, you're narrative. That's, no, no, fed to the narrative by the media.
[00:56:53] **Jason Calacanis**: Okay. No, no, I told you what it is. I'm just seeing the anecdotal stuff I see on the front lines
[00:56:58] **Jason Calacanis**: is what I base it on. It's, it's not just me glomming on to random data.
[00:57:02] **David Sacks**: Okay. The second chart I want to bring up what you see here is median
[00:57:06] **David Sacks**: real wages earnings are going up. Now, if it's true that inflation is high and wages don't
[00:57:13] **David Sacks**: increase, then people's purchasing power will go down. But what we're seeing here is
[00:57:16] **David Sacks**: purchasing power is still going up. And we have seen that during the first year of the Trump
[00:57:20] **David Sacks**: administration. So look, it is true that Republicans need to focus on affordability.
[00:57:25] **David Sacks**: The price of gas and eggs, for example, has gone down. And we need to keep making progress
[00:57:31] **David Sacks**: in that area. I don't know if you saw the tweet by JD Vance, but he basically said that.
[00:57:36] **David Sacks**: Republicans need to focus on the domestic picture. And they will. Now, if you're talking about
[00:57:40] **David Sacks**: the election, one thing I want to point out is that all the major races were in blue territory.
[00:57:47] **David Sacks**: And we got blue results. So this wasn't like unexpected. And furthermore, Trump wasn't on the
[00:57:54] **David Sacks**: ballot. Now, I can see to you that Republicans have a problem that when Trump is not on the ballot,
[00:58:00] **David Sacks**: our voter turnout is lower. So in this election, the only thing that was a little disappointing,
[00:58:05] **David Sacks**: I think, was the gap and excitement between the Democrats and the Republicans. Democrats were
[00:58:09] **David Sacks**: able to turn out their voters. Republicans were not. And again, that's a problem that Republicans
[00:58:13] **David Sacks**: are going to have to solve for the midterms and in 2028, which is how do we turn out our base
[00:58:18] **David Sacks**: when Trump is not on the ballot? But you can't really lay that problem at Trump's feet. I mean,
[00:58:21] **David Sacks**: when he's on the ballot, he turns out the base and he wins. And that is the problem that we have
[00:58:26] **David Sacks**: to solve. So I agree with that part of it. And I agree with the part of it that said that
[00:58:33] **Brad Gerstner**: Republicans now need to focus on the domestic picture. But look, one of the biggest problems we have
[00:58:37] **Brad Gerstner**: right now is the government is shut down. Who does the public blame for that? Unfortunately,
[00:58:41] **Brad Gerstner**: they're going to blame the party that's in power, not realizing that the reason why the Democrats
[00:58:47] **Brad Gerstner**: are able to shut down the government is because of the filibuster. So unfortunately, I think the
[00:58:52] **Brad Gerstner**: public perceives that they gave power to Republicans, but the government shut down. The reason for that
[00:58:58] **Brad Gerstner**: is because Democrats can shut down the government with just 41 votes, basically. And President
[00:59:05] **Brad Gerstner**: Trump has called for getting rid of the filibuster. If the Democrats won't reopen the government,
[00:59:09] **Brad Gerstner**: I think we should do that. By the way, just to go off on this tangent for a second. Most people
[00:59:14] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: don't understand the filibuster or how it works or why that's even a part of democracy.
[00:59:18] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Basically, what it says is that for votes where the filibuster is in play, you need 60 votes,
[00:59:24] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: you know, superjority in the Senate, as opposed to 50. If you ask most people in the country,
[00:59:28] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: what is democracy, they would say it's 50 plus one in the house, 50 plus one in the Senate,
[00:59:35] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: and the presidency. That's all you need. But that's not true. And the question is if Democrats
[00:59:41] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: won't reopen the government, then I think Republicans are within their rights to get rid of this
[00:59:45] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: filibuster. And we know that Democrats will do it. The next time the Democrats have the trifecta,
[00:59:50] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: they will absolutely get rid of the filibuster. We know that's true because when we interview Joe
[00:59:54] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: Manchin, he was very clear. He was asked by Schumer and Biden, let's vote out the filibuster.
[01:00:00] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: And he drew a bright line in the Senate and said, no, but you're right, they would have. And
[01:00:05] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: we're getting to a place where if these folks in the Senate and the House don't get back to work soon,
[01:00:11] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: there will be no domestic policy agenda that gets passed. There's critical crypto legislation,
[01:00:15] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: AI legislation, there's domestic health care and other legislation that has to have a chance
[01:00:20] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: to see the light of day. And so if you're not going to show up, then it doesn't leave many other
[01:00:26] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: options, except to get rid of the filibuster. Now that has all these downstream effects for when
[01:00:31] **Chamath Palihapitiya**: you're not in charge, right? Just because then it'll be a simple majority for the other team as well.
[01:00:36] **David Sacks**: Right. But you're right, Sachs, like we're getting to a point where there are two Democrats who
[01:00:40] **David Sacks**: are opposed to getting rid of the filibuster. It was Manchin and Sinema, they're now both gone.
[01:00:43] **David Sacks**: So the modern Democrats are largely out of the caucus now. And if and when, because at some point,
[01:00:49] **David Sacks**: the Democrats will at some point return to power, you know they're going to get rid of the filibuster.
[01:00:54] **David Sacks**: And here's the crazy thing. You can get rid of the filibuster with 50 votes in the Senate.
[01:00:59] **David Sacks**: I don't think people will realize that. So basically, you've got this custom, because that's all it is,
[01:01:04] **David Sacks**: this is a customer
