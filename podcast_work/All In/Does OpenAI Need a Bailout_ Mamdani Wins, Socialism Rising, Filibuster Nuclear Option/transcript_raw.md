[00:00:00] Brad Gershner is here joining us hot after crashing the stock market and popping the AI bubble
[00:00:06] well done, Brad. Will they get into it? All of our portfolios thank you. We're all down 15%
[00:00:13] this week. Can we ask open AI to just put a moratorium on any more public statements or appearances
[00:00:19] for another couple months? Good job, Brad. You decided you'd be a podcaster. You're like,
[00:00:23] hey, let me ask a couple of hard questions here and you're popping the AI bubble.
[00:00:30] Something like that. Do as I say, not as I do. Are we getting into it? Because I think it is
[00:00:34] interesting, actually. It's super interesting. Super interesting. Let's go to Sam. Of course,
[00:00:38] if you're not in the industry, Sam Altman appeared on the Fabulous BG2 podcast last Friday.
[00:00:46] And it got a little frisky when our fifth bestie here asked what I thought was
[00:00:54] a completely legitimate, totally mundane question. Hey, you're making 13 billion.
[00:01:01] It's actually a softball question to be honest. It was an underhanded pitch. The way that it was
[00:01:06] asked, I think you did a very reasonable job of asking a good question in a very fair way.
[00:01:10] So let's just show this clip here and then I want to go behind the pod with you, Brad.
[00:01:15] So I think this single biggest question I've heard all week and hanging over the market is,
[00:01:21] how can the company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments?
[00:01:30] You've heard the criticism, Sam. We're doing well more revenue than that. Second of all,
[00:01:34] Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer, excuse me. I just,
[00:01:39] enough. I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy open AI shares. I don't think
[00:01:45] you want to sell that. Including myself. Including myself. Talk with a lot of breathless concern
[00:01:52] about our compute stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we could sell,
[00:01:56] you know, your shares are anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on
[00:02:00] Twitter, whatever about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply revenue.
[00:02:05] He's growing steeply. We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow.
[00:02:09] There are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's
[00:02:13] appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open AI is about to go out of business
[00:02:18] and, you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would
[00:02:21] love to see them get burned on that. So Brad, you asked, I think, like, you know, to Moth and I
[00:02:27] were just saying, pretty mundane question. You said it very nicely. I guess we could give Sam
[00:02:33] a little bit of grace. I don't know if he was being a little cheeky or maybe he's tired
[00:02:36] of answering the question, but the internet took this and ran with it in a very viral way that he
[00:02:43] was angry and he was hostile. How did you take it? And that's the interesting thing, right? I mean,
[00:02:49] I mean, listen, we bust each other's chops all the time. We get feisty with one another. Sometimes
[00:02:54] it runs amok. Like we don't know if somebody's being serious or not serious and, you know, Sam and I
[00:02:59] had a good laugh after, you know, I think Sam was, he was feisty, but I think he also intended it as a
[00:03:05] joke. He knows that I don't want to sell my shares. He knows that I would like to buy more shares
[00:03:09] in the company, et cetera. But I think the reason that it went so viral is because it is a super
[00:03:16] important question. People are really nervous. They're wondering, are we walking into an AI bubble?
[00:03:22] Like how can these huge numbers? How can you be talking about 1.4 trillion in spending when you,
[00:03:28] you know, have kind of gap revenue that's been reported to 13 billion this year? So I was,
[00:03:33] I was a little disappointed. And I tweeted about this afterwards that kind of the feistyness got in
[00:03:38] the way of the answer. But if you listen to his words during the rest of the segment, he basically
[00:03:45] said, listen, we think we're going to have 100 billion in revenues over the course of the next
[00:03:49] couple of years. And, you know, Jay Kelly sent the team a chart that basically just shows the
[00:03:54] information's forecast for what open AI and anthropics revenues are going to be over the course
[00:03:59] of the next several years. And like the information is reporting that their internal numbers are
[00:04:04] both over 100 billion dollars. This is the information reporting on leaked internal numbers,
[00:04:09] or the information is taking a guess. No, I think this is, I think they report, this is on leaked
[00:04:14] internal numbers according to the information. And so, you know, I think Sam's in his head saying,
[00:04:21] I believe, and he said multiple times on the pod, we're going to have revenues in excess of 100
[00:04:27] billion dollars. And the 1.4 trillion, it's super important to remember. This is over a period of
[00:04:33] five or six years. I estimate about half of that spending is going to be borne by the partners.
[00:04:39] So now we're talking 700 billion dollars in spending. Spread that over five or six years. In the
[00:04:45] out years, you're probably talking about 150 billion dollars of CapEx to open AI. So he's probably,
[00:04:52] you know, sitting there saying on any said, we're going to have over 100 billion of revenues. So,
[00:04:56] if we have 150 billion of revenue and 150 billion in CapEx, now it begins to pencil out a little
[00:05:02] bit more. But importantly, he said, and if we don't have those revenues, we've got to match our
[00:05:08] revenues to our expenses, right? I think they will just extend, recut the deals in order to make
[00:05:14] those expenses doable for the company. This is an important point because we don't know, we
[00:05:19] haven't seen these actual deals. And if they have conditions or outs, or if they can push it out,
[00:05:25] or they can cancel it. Maybe, you know, they have, and that will come out, I guess, in the public
[00:05:29] filings. But putting all that aside, the market was not happy about this. Microsoft, Nvidia,
[00:05:36] Oracle, Broadcom, CoreWeave, who all are the partners we're talking about, who are close to,
[00:05:43] and when you see these charts of all the deals Sam has done, and Sam's a great deal maker,
[00:05:47] obviously, they were all down six to 20%. So this has, in fact, been a significant correction
[00:05:55] in terms of the AI boom. So before we get into their CFOs comments, Shemath, I'd love to hear
[00:06:00] you're just general. I think it's fun to give these guys, but they're totally and completely
[00:06:08] uncorrelated. Okay. Every now and then you have a bad day, I've done thousands of hours on TV,
[00:06:16] I've had a couple of really bad days. You've got some been there. Yeah. I suspect that if Sam
[00:06:22] had to do it over, he wouldn't have said what he said in the way he said it. And even if he was
[00:06:25] joking, he would have practiced it a little bit more and just landed it. So what's actually going
[00:06:32] on? I think right now we are in a period of getting a little risk off and rebalancing. Why?
[00:06:41] There are two sets of things that are happening. The first set of things is the market is learning
[00:06:47] to digest all of the capex that has happened. And they're all breathlessly trying to build models
[00:06:55] that try to predict what the ROI is of that spend. The second part of that is they're trying to figure
[00:07:01] out how this new spend will actually impact future earnings. And this is less to do with open AI,
[00:07:09] but it has much more to do with the big stalwarts of the Mag 7. Google's earnings were phenomenal.
[00:07:16] Their AI numbers were blazing hot. Facebook's was terrible. Apple is now in this really interesting
[00:07:26] place where it seems like they're going to seed their AI business to Google and pay them billions
[00:07:33] of dollars a year like they get paid billions of dollars a year for search from them. I think
[00:07:39] that that's what's happening. The second part is as you go into your end, there's just a little
[00:07:45] bit of all in the market and people are like, let me just consolidate. Let me book some wins. Let
[00:07:50] me get ready for the new year. Let me tax loss harvest. Let me do all the things that people used
[00:07:54] to wait until mid-December. And now they are smart enough to know that mid-December the price
[00:08:00] action is sh**. And so now this price action starts in mid-November. So I wouldn't pin this
[00:08:05] on Brad and Sam. I just think this is natural market machinations, but to be clear, we are very much
[00:08:12] getting into a phase of risk off. Yeah, and this got exacerbated sacks because on Wednesday,
[00:08:20] open AI decided to be in the news. Again, when their CFO Sarah Fryer told the Wall Street Journal,
[00:08:26] she hopes the US government, that's you sacks, will backstop the financing of its 1.4 trillion
[00:08:33] dollars in data centers. Here's the direct quote, the backstop, the guarantee that allows the
[00:08:39] financing to happen. And she said that the federal guarantees would quote, really drop the cost
[00:08:46] of finance, of course it would. And this would allow open AI to borrow more money at lower rates
[00:08:52] from a much larger pool of lenders. That went viral. And everybody said, oh my god,
[00:08:57] it started feeding, I think, the narrative that maybe open AI is insolvent, in fact. And there's
[00:09:02] no way for them to pay their bills, which obviously is a little bit ridiculous.
[00:09:08] And people are trying to correlate this to obviously the dot com bust and then the great
[00:09:14] financial crisis. But on Wednesday nights, Fryer walked back her comments. I want to clarify
[00:09:20] for my comments, open AI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments.
[00:09:25] I used the word quote, backstop and it muddy the point I was making the point that American
[00:09:31] strength and technology will come for building real industrial capacity, which requires the private
[00:09:34] sector and government playing their part. And she also said that open AI was some pace to generate
[00:09:39] 13 billion. I'll get to you on this one, Brad, because he took offense to the 13 billion dollar
[00:09:44] revenue number and disputed that. So we'll see if there's some clarity there. But sacks, you came
[00:09:50] over the top and tweeted that there will be no federal bailout. There's plenty of people
[00:09:57] available to pick up the mantle of open AI needed a bailout. You got five major frontier
[00:10:04] model companies, Grog, Claude, Gemini, plenty of them. So sacks, you came in, Daddy's home and
[00:10:12] you settled it. Daddy came home. Everybody has to sit down in the kitchen and explain what's going
[00:10:17] on. Take us through, you know, how you think about this as ours are. Well, this morning my entire
[00:10:24] feed was full of comments by people analysts, consumers, business people and politicians saying
[00:10:34] that we can't allow open AI to have a federal bailout. And I think they were kind of connecting
[00:10:40] Sam's original comments or prickliness to what Brad talked about like, hey, do they have the
[00:10:44] money? Can they justify this with friar's comments that they need a backstop to say, hey,
[00:10:49] this company is not solvent. It's going out of business and they're demanding a federal bailout.
[00:10:53] So I think that's kind of how the pieces got put together. And what I said is, look, there's
[00:10:57] not going to be a federal bailout for AI. Not going to happen. We have five major frontier
[00:11:03] model companies right now. And there are new companies being formed all the time. And if one of
[00:11:09] them fails, hey, it's going to go out of business and the other ones are going to replace it. So
[00:11:13] nobody is talking about a bailout. In fact, I would say that the AI sector is maybe one of the
[00:11:19] healthiest, meaning most competitive sectors of the entire American economy right now.
[00:11:24] To the extent that you just love ruthless competition driving innovation, that's what we have
[00:11:28] right now. So if one of these companies gets over its skis and ends up going bankrupt, the chips
[00:11:33] are going to fall where they may. And I've never heard anyone serious disputing that fact. Now,
[00:11:39] I also made the point, which I think is important that to give open AI the benefit of the doubt.
[00:11:43] I don't think anyone at open AI was asking for a bailout. If you watch the video as Sarah
[00:11:49] Fire, she's clearly searching for the right word to describe what she's trying to say. And then
[00:11:55] she settles on a word that she now regrets, which is backstop, definitely not the right word.
[00:12:00] So I don't think they are asking for a bailout. I don't know what she meant by backstop doesn't
[00:12:05] make sense. So I think this is a little bit of a tempest and a teapot. What I think is important.
[00:12:12] And I think maybe where she was going is that I do think that we want to make it easier
[00:12:18] to build infrastructure in this country. And that means making permitting easier, making power
[00:12:24] generation easier. That's all about regulatory reform. And I think that the goal here is to
[00:12:31] enable a rapid infrastructure build out without increasing residential rates for electricity,
[00:12:35] which nobody wants. And that's in the process of potentially creating a little bit of an
[00:12:39] envy backlash is when local communities fear that their electricity rates are going to go up
[00:12:43] because someone wants to build a data center. That's the thing we have to combat. But the way that
[00:12:47] you solve that problem is by making it easier for these AI companies to stand up their own power
[00:12:52] generation behind the meter. And that requires regulatory reform. That's what the president is called
[00:12:56] for is allowing the AI companies to do behind the meter. So no one's talking about bailout.
[00:13:01] Nobody's talking about backstop. We are talking about making making permitting easier and making it
[00:13:06] easier to do build out. So build out not bailout. Yes. Should be our motto here. Build out not bailout.
[00:13:13] Now there was a little bit of sort of reading the tea leaves. There have been times when loans were
[00:13:18] given to incentivize an industry. So I just want to be clear with you. There's no discussions of
[00:13:23] like Selendra, you know, type loans. No, let's discuss any of that with me. So like it's not even
[00:13:29] on the radar. I would say from the government standpoint. And why would it be if there's so many
[00:13:33] people trying to pour capitalists capital into this Brad and there's so many people trying to buy
[00:13:38] your shares in a company making $13 billion that's currently valued at $500 billion,
[00:13:44] which I think is like a 30 to 40 price to sell is a ratio. I mean this company is fully
[00:13:48] valued and people are still trying to buy shares. So Brad wrap us up here. Yeah. I think I was
[00:13:53] brilliantly said by David. Listen, it's a national imperative that we accelerate the build out of
[00:13:57] AI infrastructure across the country. I've said before, the $4 trillion that Jensen Huang has
[00:14:04] estimated will be built out over the next five years is 10 times the size of the Manhattan
[00:14:09] project that was totally federally funded. Okay. And this is all being privately funded.
[00:14:15] But it wouldn't be possible without the government, Secretary Wright, others,
[00:14:19] Bergram, etc. Clearing out of the way, the regulatory hurdles, you know, you heard on the
[00:14:25] pod, same pod that power is really the gating issue here. And so it's been amazing to see what the
[00:14:32] federal government is doing. I think that's what Sarah was trying to get to that they need to be
[00:14:36] have a public private partnership. They're going to do their job, raise their money, backstop was
[00:14:41] not the right choice of words. But they I know and I talked to Sarah this morning about this are
[00:14:47] deeply grateful for what the federal government is doing to accelerate the build out of power and
[00:14:53] infrastructure. And the federal government could do that without taking risk on their own balance.
[00:14:57] In fact, we've seen some of the investments they've made as a result of the Japanese deal they
[00:15:02] got on tariffs. They can reinvest those dollars to accelerate some of the nuclear build out,
[00:15:06] etc. By the way, Sam just posted something about 15 minutes ago. And he was pretty authoritative
[00:15:12] in addressing the three critical questions. The first thing he says is that we will we meaning
[00:15:20] open AI will end the year on a 20 billion dollar forward run rate, which means December revenue
[00:15:26] will be 1.666 billion at least. So we kind of know where the revenues going from 1.2 to 1.6 over
[00:15:36] these next few months, which is a pretty staggering growth rate if they were at 13 and they're going
[00:15:40] end of 20. And then he goes and addresses the whole too big to fail and whether they want government
[00:15:45] sponsorship and he's pretty unequivocal here. So I think this is a 10% of people. I think people are
[00:15:51] people are on pins and needles. They're agitated. Some people have had no gains. Other people have had
[00:15:57] incredible gains. Everybody's agitated. I think we we are getting in the
[00:16:03] risk off phase for at least two or three months. We will be back firmly in risk on voting
[00:16:10] February is my suspicion. But these next few months, I think people will over blow every random
[00:16:15] little thing. Well, and in fairness, you know, 1.4 trillion dollars is a very large number. I mean,
[00:16:20] this is a number we've never seen. One company say they're going to do a build out of it.
[00:16:25] Okay. Well, can I take the other side of this? If it is, if I was the US government, to the extent
[00:16:30] that we are doing public-private partnerships, if there is a way for US taxpayers to own a piece of
[00:16:35] open AI, I would say great. I mean, so Brad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to the
[00:16:41] Trump. So hold on. So before everybody breathlessly complains, whether you see it or not,
[00:16:48] there is an enormous sovereign wealth fund that is being built by President Trump. And it is
[00:16:56] for the benefit of all American taxpayers. And so to the extent the people in government could
[00:17:04] underwrite an investment structure, like they have done in things like MP materials, which is
[00:17:11] way up, things like Intel, which is way up. These guys are like really good smart people,
[00:17:17] Mike Grimes, Dave Shapiro, Stephen Feinberg, and his team at DOD. They're cutting hard deals,
[00:17:23] tough deals. So I don't know if they did do a deal with open AI, I think they probably get the
[00:17:28] best of it. And the American taxpayer would win. And I wouldn't be angry at that.
[00:17:33] I think as you see from Sam's tweet, they're not looking for the government to invest. They're not
[00:17:38] looking for a government bailout. What they are doing, and I think David said it well, is they're
[00:17:44] pushing us very hard as a matter of national security and economic growth to go faster, to accelerate,
[00:17:51] to build out infrastructure, and to give a little credit where credit is due, right? All of this
[00:17:57] build out, right? All of the Stargate stuff that people were laughing about 18 months ago. Thank
[00:18:02] God as an American citizen that we are running this fast. China has 100 nuclear fission plants
[00:18:08] under construction. And we were sitting on our hands. So I think if anything, they've helped jump,
[00:18:12] start that conversation and get us moving faster. And I think that's good for all of us.
[00:18:16] Great segue, Brad. Thank you. Jensen told the FT straight up, quote, China is going to win
[00:18:24] the AI race. His argument is that US state-by-state regulations and power constraints are making it
[00:18:30] harder for USAI companies as we've discussed here countless times. Whereas the CCP is obviously
[00:18:36] in interest making it super affordable to run all those GPUs. Nvidia put out the following
[00:18:43] statement from him, as I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind American AI. It's vital
[00:18:48] that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide. Obviously he's a hundred percent
[00:18:55] right. He's a hundred percent right. I don't know if you guys saw, but cursor 2.0 launched this week.
[00:19:01] My team at 80 90 use it. It's an incredible product. Guess what they did? They swapped out
[00:19:06] and thropic for an open source Chinese model. Yep. Do you know what they're using? Is it like
[00:19:10] Kimmy or what is it? I think it's Gwen. I think they're using a spin of coin to be clear. They're
[00:19:14] cleansing these Chinese open source models, but they are. I don't know about cursor, but they're
[00:19:19] a lot of companies. Yes. And then running them, standing them up themselves obviously. My point
[00:19:24] is we are right now running with one hand time behind our back. We are going to have to deal with
[00:19:32] 50 different sets of legislation from state legislators who think they know what AI is. They don't.
[00:19:39] Sax knows. So there should be a federal framework and that should be it. And then meanwhile,
[00:19:46] the Chinese open source models get better and better and better and better. And so we're making
[00:19:50] technology decisions that tie our wagons to that steel thread. And so Jensen is right. We need to
[00:19:58] clean this up quickly. I was a little bit disappointed to see. I thought it was reasonable
[00:20:02] for certain politicians, especially Republican ones to say, left there's not going to be a federal
[00:20:08] bailout for AI. Great. We all agree. No one's asking for it. But I was a little disappointed to see
[00:20:13] that some of them were associating a bailout with a single federal framework as opposed to the
[00:20:19] patchwork of 50 state regulatory regimes. Because if Republican governors think that there are the ones
[00:20:24] who are going to be writing the rules, they're sorely mistaken about this. 25% of the bills going
[00:20:30] through state legislatures are in four states. California, New York, Colorado, and Illinois. In
[00:20:35] other words, the biggest blue states. Those also happen to be the states where these big AI
[00:20:41] companies are all headquartered with the one exception of XAI, which is in Texas. But these companies
[00:20:47] are in California. The blue states have the most market power. And if they end up creating the
[00:20:52] regulations, I just think it's naive to think that the AI companies won't write their models to
[00:21:00] those regulations of the blue states. I don't think the red states are somehow going to find
[00:21:04] themselves exempted from the blue state regulations that are being imposed. And I've talked about
[00:21:08] in a previous podcast, how what the blue states are going for here is to reinsert DEI into AI models
[00:21:16] to achieve ideological capture. And the way they do this, they don't say we're requiring DEI. They
[00:21:22] say that we're prohibiting algorithmic discrimination, which means that the model says something bad
[00:21:26] about a protected group. You end up with the same end result, which is, again, ideological capture.
[00:21:31] I think all Republicans should be opposed to this. There's only one way to stop it,
[00:21:35] which is with federal preemption. Otherwise, the states will do what they want and the blue states
[00:21:38] will basically dominate. Now, I think that part of what's going on here is that Republicans have
[00:21:44] muscle memory around what happened during the Biden years. And what happened during the Biden
[00:21:49] years is that the Biden administration pushed for censorship and shadow banning and
[00:21:56] deplatforming all that kind of stuff. They were working very close with big tech companies to push
[00:22:00] the censorship agenda. The only pushback that Republicans were able to achieve was at the state
[00:22:05] level. And so you had cases like Biden v. Missouri where we had Senator Eric Schmidt was on the pod
[00:22:11] talking about that when he was attorney general. And so he was able to make a states rights argument
[00:22:16] to push back on the Biden censorship. So I think that Republicans remember that and they think
[00:22:23] well, states rights is our solution. But now we have a completely different situation. I mean,
[00:22:28] the board's been completely reversed where Republicans are in power in Washington and the states
[00:22:34] are making a bunch of bad decisions with respect to AI. And so I think that, to be honest, I think
[00:22:40] we need to kind of just realize that. And I think the arguments that make the most sense right now
[00:22:44] are the commerce clause arguments where look, the Constitution wants to create a single national
[00:22:50] market for interstate commerce, AI clearly qualifies. And let's get President Trump, not Gavin
[00:22:56] Newsom or J.B. Pritzker or Kathy Hockle or Jared Polis, the ability to write the rules. Let's have
[00:23:03] a single federal framework that will prevent ideological capture of AI. Keep it unbiased, which
[00:23:09] every conservative should want. I'll just reiterate again, if you want to see the impact of having
[00:23:14] a state set of regulations that basically munge a market up, just go and use your favorite AI
[00:23:21] tool and ask what happened when California passed CARB, which are the emission standards that
[00:23:27] force the entire American US auto industry to have two sets of cars, one for California and one for
[00:23:32] the rest of the market. And what did it do? It completely flipped demand upside down on its head.
[00:23:38] And it has made it very difficult for the auto industry to be sustainable. And I think if you
[00:23:43] apply that same idea across four states, instead of just one, across the most important technological
[00:23:51] revolution we've had, I just don't think it's going to be a good outcome. The steel man first of
[00:23:55] that, Chimoff would be, we got rid of Smugg and California and that it did an amazing job
[00:24:01] in terms of getting rid of pollution, which also matters. And I'm trying to think of the steel man.
[00:24:06] Are you sure that that's the steel man that you've come up with or do you think that the tax credits
[00:24:10] did that? Do you think making the tops of everything was the way that solves Smugg, or do you
[00:24:18] think the $7,500 federal tax credit solves Smugg? Well, no, but the Smugg regulations predated the
[00:24:24] EV ones. Those have been going on for decades. So it did get rid of Smugg. So, you know, putting
[00:24:30] better using cleaner gas and then having better exhausts on those cars, that would be the steel man
[00:24:37] of it. I'm not saying I'm for or against state regulations, but Sachs, have you heard any,
[00:24:45] aside from the federalism argument states, right? Have you heard any great defense of states
[00:24:51] having some say in how AI is deployed in their communities? Well, they can have some say. There's
[00:24:58] definitely areas where you don't preempt. I mean, you have to decide how wide the preemption is,
[00:25:03] but when it comes to things like notifications about models, safety, instance, things like
[00:25:08] that, it doesn't make sense to have model companies needing to report to 50 different states,
[00:25:13] 50 different agencies within those states, each with a different definition of what needs to be
[00:25:17] reported, each with different reporting deadlines. Like, why would you have that? It doesn't make any
[00:25:22] sense. Why would you allow the big blue states to essentially insert DEI into the models,
[00:25:29] which will affect the red states, too? You're not going to be able to keep that out. If California
[00:25:33] pushes algorithmic discrimination, Florida and Texas and Arkansas are going to be affected as well.
[00:25:39] I think we need to use the opportunity we have right now by the fact that we have a majority in
[00:25:44] Washington to set a sensible federal standard that preamps the excesses of the blue states. Look,
[00:25:52] the constitutional arguments you can make either way. I personally believe in the commerce clause,
[00:25:56] but I think when it comes to the merits of the policy argument, we should let Donald Trump write
[00:26:00] these rules. Let me just say one other thing. Part of what's going on here on the right is that
[00:26:04] there's so much anger towards the big tech companies for what happened during the by-years with
[00:26:09] censorship and de-platforming that I think there's just this knee-jerk reaction where we don't
[00:26:14] want to do anything to help the tech companies. We just want to hurt them. I think we just have to
[00:26:18] have a more nuanced approach than that because the question is, what will the result be? Look,
[00:26:23] no one was more critical of the big tech companies engaging in censorship in Silicon Valley than me
[00:26:28] when Donald Trump was kicked off every big tech platform. I think I was literally the only
[00:26:33] person in Silicon Valley who was publicly objecting to that on this podcast. So I'm perfectly
[00:26:39] willing to criticize the big tech companies when they make a mistake, but when they're engaging in
[00:26:45] healthy competition and innovation and we want to prevent ideological capture and that's what we're
[00:26:51] talking about. Let's make sure it ends up in the right place not just engaging this knee-jerk
[00:26:56] anti-tech reaction which will play into the hands of the blue state governors. We're in this race
[00:27:03] to win AI globally and one of the major concerns I have is that AI is becoming deeply unpopular in
[00:27:10] America, right? Silicon Valley is losing the battle around AI. Dumaers are now scaring people
[00:27:17] about jobs. They think all these job cuts that are going on in America are the result of AI.
[00:27:21] And number two, they're seeing their electric bills go up and they think that's also the result of AI.
[00:27:26] I've talked with a lot of Republican Senator and House members who say they are afraid to mention
[00:27:31] the words AI because their popularity ratings go down. We need to get on the other side of that
[00:27:36] because that is a losing proposition for America. If what takes hold here is that, you know,
[00:27:42] it's politically popular, right? To push back against AI, the David, I think that's what you're
[00:27:48] seeing at the state levels with Republican governors as well. And so, you know, I think both of those
[00:27:53] are false narratives, but we need to get on the other side. In China, they're not going to slow down.
[00:27:58] So if we do a known goal here in slowdown because we think somehow that this is the path to
[00:28:04] greater economic growth, it's going to be a real problem, both national security as well as
[00:28:08] economic security, three, five years down the line. Yeah, can I build on that actually? So in
[00:28:13] terms of the public discourse, it's true that the Duma narratives have had this tremendous
[00:28:17] effect that you can see in the poll numbers and then the politicians feel like they can basically
[00:28:21] play into that in one way or another. But where do these narratives come from?
[00:28:26] Three big tech billionaires who are on the left contributed over a billion dollars to these
[00:28:31] Duma think tanks, basically with Dustin Moskovitz, Jan Tallinn, and Vitalik Buterin. And from
[00:28:38] open philanthropy and from some of these other entities, they have spun up hundreds of these
[00:28:42] astroturfed organizations that are spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars to spread
[00:28:47] these Duma narratives. A writer named Neurit Weisblatt on Substack has basically broken down
[00:28:53] how this all works. It's actually a great article I'll put on the screen. So people need to understand
[00:28:59] that these narratives are coming from somewhere. They're astroturfed. I don't think they're true.
[00:29:04] And the narratives are contradictory. So let me give you an example. Right now, the two biggest
[00:29:08] narratives that we're seeing on social media and in mainstream media are number one, the idea
[00:29:13] that there's a huge AI bubble right now. In other words, it's all totally fake. The other
[00:29:17] biggest narrative is that AI is on the verge of superintelligence and we're all going to get
[00:29:22] replaced. Also fake. In other words, AI is completely real and super powerful. These two things
[00:29:27] are contradictory. If it's a bubble, it's not going to be on the verge of superintelligence.
[00:29:31] And if AI is really that powerful, then obviously on some level, this economic activity is justified.
[00:29:37] So these narratives are completely contradictory. I think that is possible to believe in neither one
[00:29:43] of them, which is where I'm at. But it makes no sense for people to believe in both. And you literally
[00:29:48] have the same people on social media and in mainstream media pushing both of these Duma narratives.
[00:29:54] So I think we need to increase somehow our immune defenses or antibodies. We need to improve
[00:29:59] our antibodies to I think these memes that are being pushed out by groups that have these weird
[00:30:08] Duma radiologies like effective altruism. And they literally just want progress to stop
[00:30:14] on AI. And if we do that, like Brad's saying, China will end up winning this AI race. Progress
[00:30:19] in AI is not going to stop. It'll just all be in China. Brad, let's talk brass tax before
[00:30:25] we move on to our next topic about chat GPT and their revenue. If they're at 20 billion in revenue
[00:30:31] run rate, I think it's pretty well known. Their majority of their revenue is consumer 75% is the
[00:30:39] number I heard. You could tell me if that aligns with your estimates as well. And cost 20 bucks a
[00:30:45] month, 240 a year. That's about 60 million paid subscriptions a year. And then on the other side,
[00:30:52] you got an anthropic, which is kind of got the opposite right there. They're mostly EPIs.
[00:30:56] And do those roughly correlate with what you know, Brad? Well, I would just say they correlate
[00:31:03] with what the information is reported as leaked data from both companies. And that makes them both
[00:31:09] the fastest growing companies in the history of Silicon Valley. But specifically the 75% coming from
[00:31:14] consumer from open AI. I think it's well known. More comes from consumer at open AI and more comes
[00:31:19] from enterprise at two challenging questions for you. Since you have a big bet here, Google, Apple
[00:31:26] make these products free. They have pretty robust ad networks. That's a massive headwind. And then
[00:31:32] on top of that in the startup community, we just talked about cursor. People are not trusting open AI
[00:31:38] and their API anymore because they know open AI is creating competing services. And so there's a big
[00:31:44] movement in the startup community to not use open AI's API products. How confident are you
[00:31:51] that with those two headwinds? Free for consumers and better products, right? Gemini is a great
[00:31:57] product. Rocks a great product. Claude's a great product. A lot of great product out there.
[00:32:01] And I don't think consumers can tell the difference. Why would they pay 240 if they can get it for
[00:32:04] free from Google? And then second, startups are realizing, hey, Sam has to make a lot of money.
[00:32:11] Therefore, he's going to do it. Microsoft did. There was a company called Lotus 123. There's
[00:32:16] a company called WordPerfect. Now we're on the Microsoft platform windows and then Microsoft
[00:32:21] killed them. People right now are experiencing that from open AI. How concerned are you about the
[00:32:26] revenue growth? Yeah, I mean, listen, I'm betting in the super cycle. This is the biggest super cycle
[00:32:31] of all of our lives. I'm an investor in open AI and anthropic and Google and in Microsoft and
[00:32:36] Nvidia, et cetera. And so I don't think you have to make the call right now. One of these,
[00:32:41] you know, companies winning the fact of the matter as SAC said, we have one of the most vibrant
[00:32:46] and competitive ecosystems in AI in the world. I love the fact that Sundar is coming off them at
[00:32:52] swinging. I think Gemini three is going to be great at Google. They may in fact make it free.
[00:32:57] I think Apple, I love seeing Apple pay Google to, you know, make Siri better. I think that's
[00:33:02] going to be a great consumer experience. And the only way that open AI wins is they got to build
[00:33:06] a product that we all love. You've seen those cohort curves. The reality is they are the verb
[00:33:12] at the moment. It's theirs to lose in consumer. The cohort curves are things of dreams, right? This
[00:33:18] is the retention rate, the engagement rate is people stay with the service longer. And then by
[00:33:22] the way, anthropics numbers, despite cursor, doing some of their own thing, anthropics numbers
[00:33:28] are off the charts. I think that this market is as big or bigger than current estimates are out
[00:33:34] there, but it's not going to be a straight line up into the right. We're going to have these
[00:33:37] moments as Jamal said of risk off panic, just as we did with internet, just as we did with mobile,
[00:33:43] just as we did with cloud. The key here is as an investor's conviction, there is a massive
[00:33:49] conviction tax to be paid, right? If you lack conviction and sell when these things are down,
[00:33:54] I'm going to bet on the super cycle, but I'm betting over a much longer period of time than most
[00:33:58] people. And amongst the startups out there, they basically believe cloud is not trying to take their
[00:34:04] business. And cloud has been very careful to say, hey, we're not going to encroach into the
[00:34:08] application layer. So, all right. Yeah. The most impressive revenue chart when you showed that
[00:34:15] leak from open AI was anthropic. If that revenue chart is real, what's really impressive is
[00:34:22] anthropic is not really in a j curve at all. And they get to very similar points of free cash
[00:34:30] flow, but will not have burned through near as much capital to get there. That's my singularly
[00:34:36] interesting observation about this chart. Can I say again, those numbers are real as reported
[00:34:43] by the information, but what I would say about that is this, I've been forecasting companies for
[00:34:48] 25 years. I know the numbers today. Sam just told us 20 billion dollar run rate and a year for
[00:34:55] open AI. Everybody who is forecasting three years out on these companies is totally guessing, right?
[00:35:03] Like that's why I said, time is on your side if you're betting over a five to 10 year horizon,
[00:35:08] but if you think with precision that the company itself can forecast what's going to be happening
[00:35:13] in three years, I think you're misleading yourself, right? So we'll see. I think it's going to be
[00:35:18] a lot bigger, could be even bigger than those numbers. But you know, those forecasts are highly
[00:35:23] uncertain because the rate of growth has never been seen before. How do you think about expenses then?
[00:35:27] Because you're going to have to have some sense of whether this spend is accurate or reasonable.
[00:35:32] I think you have to build in an expense structure that has the flexibility. So if the numbers don't
[00:35:37] show up that you have the ability to extend your, you know, your obligation. So that's why I was saying,
[00:35:43] I don't think there's 1.4 trillion. I think it's kind of the red herring out there. I think it's
[00:35:48] kind of a fake made up number. It's all of the obligations of all of the deals that have been
[00:35:53] announced and the truth of the matter is only a portion of that is born by open AI and I'm certain
[00:35:58] there's flexibility in all of those deals to match the expenses with the revenue side. But listen,
[00:36:04] let's deal with the opposite case, Chema. Let's just say that all of these revenues start flatlining
[00:36:10] for Anthropic, for X, for, you know, for Google people aren't willing to pay for these products,
[00:36:15] then our, then our CapEx build out for AI is going to be a lot slower because at the end of the day,
[00:36:20] there's got to be somebody either in the enterprise or a consumer willing to pay real money to pay
[00:36:25] back all of this infrastructure build out or it doesn't happen. Well said. And, hey, just a quick
[00:36:31] plug here. We're going to have an amazing holiday party come spend another Christmas with your
[00:36:36] besties at the all-in holiday Travaganza with Killtony. Yeah, thank you. You got the announcement.
[00:36:44] We're burning it down this year. Joining us on stage, it's going to be a sh** show.
[00:36:49] The whole stuff, Killtony, is going to mercilessly roast everyone in Silicon Valley and the besties,
[00:36:57] Tony Hingecliff is coming to the Bay Area. We're going to have the same great stuff we always do,
[00:37:02] Casino and I, it's Pope Bernard. Are we going to do the Jays? You guys have the courage to go
[00:37:08] up there and do a little set? I'm going to do a set. That's what we're going to do. It's
[00:37:12] going to be the four of us. People are going to come up and do a set. We're going to roast each
[00:37:15] other. It's going to be absolutely brutal and fun. So you can- I'm going to have to bring in some
[00:37:21] firepower. I'm going to have to bring in my- I know exactly what you're calling Kevin Hart, aren't you?
[00:37:27] That's fine. I'm going to get your pal. I got a way to get to your pal.
[00:37:32] So I'm going to get my own writing team going. You guys were all there. I mean, not through a birthday
[00:37:37] party for me. What was it? Five years ago? Three years? Four years ago. And Kevin and Sky and Diego,
[00:37:42] they all flew up from LA, Al, Robo. We all did speeches. Sacks did a great roast. J. Cal did one.
[00:37:50] Friedberg did one. Not did an incredible one. And then Kevin just adlibs and destroyed everyone.
[00:37:59] Singularly destroyed everybody in the room. And the water is like a- like a sniper.
[00:38:05] She said that. I'm going to do a quick tight of five minutes on Yorapisha Medili, which is
[00:38:11] so small in the pathetic. And so go to allin.com slash events and you get to come. Make jokes about
[00:38:20] Shamat's tiny penis. Join us for the all-inspectacular. That's worth the price of admission alone.
[00:38:27] Allin.com slash events is going to be off the chain. If you want to do something fun,
[00:38:32] you know, it's hard to throw a holiday party. Why not buy a 20 tickets? You bring your whole
[00:38:37] company and you can buy a group ticket, individual tickets available, group tickets available.
[00:38:43] And you know, you get your logo on the step and repeat. All kinds of great stuff.
[00:38:46] outsourced your holiday party to us. We'll make it back. I'll do that at 8090. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:38:52] 8090. You know, just outsource it. Sacks. You could outsource it for your
[00:38:58] 370 domestic staff. They can all probably get the- all right. Listen, we got to talk about
[00:39:04] markets. We got Brad here, our fifth bestie stock market pulling back. As Shamat just said,
[00:39:10] maybe we're going to be risk off and we have been getting a lot of data, a lot of hand ringing
[00:39:16] going on Brad, GDP growth. Hey, maybe that's mostly due to AI, the unemployment rates taking up,
[00:39:22] inflation's taking up, lots of concerning signs. Let's help us make sense of this, Brad.
[00:39:29] I think, you know, Shamat teed this up perfectly, which is, you know, let's rewind the clock
[00:39:34] a little bit to April of this year. I think on an intraday basis, the NASDAQ was down 20%
[00:39:40] year to date in April. We're now up 20%. So 40% move higher in a few months. Same with the S&P.
[00:39:48] I think it was down over 10%. Now it's up 40% on the year. So we've had some pretty massive moves.
[00:39:54] And I think you have to, you know, reflect on where we are, you know, and we used to do this on
[00:40:00] on market checks when I was on. And you say, you know, where is altimeter? And so early in the year,
[00:40:06] we're worried about tariffs. Altimeter was positioned small, right? By May, we thought they
[00:40:12] would land the plane with the best and consensus, you know, on trade, we'd get the big beautiful bill
[00:40:17] past. And we went to kind of extra large positioning. And we've been there most of the year.
[00:40:22] And so now we're back to kind of Shamat just now that, you know, we're back to kind of medium,
[00:40:27] medium small positioning in the market. And I'll walk through a couple of slides as to the
[00:40:31] reasoning for that. Maybe we can kick it around a little bit. The first one is just there's growing
[00:40:36] signs, you know, the consumer is pulling back. And, you know, you heard it out of Chipotle,
[00:40:42] you heard it out of Kava, you heard it out of NCL, you heard it out of JetBlue. And, and, you know,
[00:40:47] the nature of it is we have this two-tier economy. The low end consumer is fault,
[00:40:51] reading the higher end consumer is hanging in there. But the consumer things making people nervous.
[00:40:55] Now, compounding that is US credit card delinquencies are now back to, you know, 2009 levels.
[00:41:04] Right. And so you have, okay, consumer cracking a little bit, delinquencies, you know,
[00:41:09] and now we're seeing regional banks roll over, etc. We're seeing the credit markets beginning
[00:41:14] to crack a little bit, credit spreads blowing out a little bit. And then if you go to this next slide,
[00:41:19] you know, this goes to what Sachs has talked a lot about on this pod that we're still in highly
[00:41:24] restrictive territory when you look at the 10-year tips. You know, the Fed is still, you know,
[00:41:30] got the market tight because they're seeing, you know, the market at all time highs, they're seeing
[00:41:35] AI stocks rip. But under the surface, I think there's a lot of concern and question about what's
[00:41:40] going on. The good news about this is we still have firepower. So what's going on in this earnings
[00:41:46] season? You know, this next slide basically earnings have come in really strong. You know, so we have
[00:41:52] 70% of companies that are beating. They're beating by wide margins, you know, in earnings.
[00:41:59] But if you look at the forecast, you know, basically, earnings have come in about 11% higher than
[00:42:06] last year. And the stocks are up about 13 or 14%. But the real question is as we roll into next year.
[00:42:12] And so, you know, Scott Besson on the one hand is saying, listen, in Q1, we're going to have
[00:42:18] some big tax refunds because of no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. And he thinks that'll give
[00:42:24] it a boost. But clearly, you hear them pounding the table that we need to get rates down. I tend
[00:42:29] to agree. The low end consumer who pays a lot on their credit cards on their car loan, et cetera,
[00:42:35] is clearly hurting. We see these layoffs, these layoffs are hurting some of these people as well.
[00:42:41] And so when you look at the multiples of the market, how do we look at it from an
[00:42:46] ultimate perspective? We still believe that owning all of compute like we have for three years and
[00:42:52] this AI trade has room to run. But they're obviously multiples have come up a lot. I talked about a
[00:42:57] 40% move from the bottom this year. And so you can just take your position size and make it a little
[00:43:03] bit smaller. So in the world of less or more, I think Chamos exactly right. There's a pause as we
[00:43:08] head in over the course of the next couple months, reflected by the stuff that we're doing.
[00:43:13] But I do think the economy is set up as we head into next year. There's been a total decoupling.
[00:43:19] Yeah. It used to be the case that as goes Main Street, so goes Wall Street or vice versa.
[00:43:24] The unfortunate reality is that there's a handful of companies that have bids that are as you
[00:43:29] said, totally speculative and well into the future. But they are so well bid and they're so highly
[00:43:36] value that they drag the entire indices forward. Even though underneath the waterline,
[00:43:41] you're leaving 493 companies behind. And the reality is that those companies that more
[00:43:46] accurately reflect what's happening to middle income America are not doing so well. And so we need
[00:43:53] to find some visible wins in the domestic policy arena. I think that that's what we need now.
[00:44:01] Because if you think of each year of a presidency as an act in three parts,
[00:44:06] I think act one was tariffs. I think act two has been foreign policy.
[00:44:11] And now it's an opportunity for act three to refocus on domestic earnings and
[00:44:19] the domestic wealth effect of middle income Americans. I think that's what has to happen.
[00:44:23] And there's a lot of clever ways, by the way, that we can do this. I've mentioned this before.
[00:44:30] But I think the really interesting opportunity for us is to use the money that's been committed
[00:44:37] by all of these countries as part of their trade negotiations. Like if you add up the money that
[00:44:43] was committed from Japan to South Korea to the Middle Eastern countries, you're talking trillions
[00:44:48] of dollars. I think it's like 3.2 trillion is the number. So it's an enormous amount of capital
[00:44:55] that can improve the state of earnings of the middle class. And I think we need to figure
[00:45:01] out a way to more aggressively put that money to work now. I think that that's what needs to happen.
[00:45:06] I think if you look at some of these other markets, it's really incredible. Bitcoin is about to
[00:45:10] break through 100,000 to the downside, which I think is a psychological barrier that probably
[00:45:17] has another 5 or 10% more to run. There's a dispersion happening in the mag 7 as of this past quarter
[00:45:22] earnings. So I think all of it has to get sorted out. You nailed it. 29 days ago, I talked to you guys
[00:45:28] a little bit about the net approval rating here and how the country's feeling. And you can see
[00:45:33] Trump's net approval rating 9.4. We're going to get into the election as well because it ductiles
[00:45:37] really nicely with this discussion. It's gotten worse. Here's the numbers from November. It's gotten
[00:45:43] 30% worse now. Trump's down 13%. I attributed, I think, to the fact that we've had all this layoff
[00:45:51] news inflation ticked up to 3%. Everybody knows it was down at 2.3. We had made great progress on it,
[00:45:56] but now it went back up. And there's a lot of survey data going on right now. And I think
[00:46:03] if you look at this next chart, it's super interesting. What gets all the press is the foreign
[00:46:07] policy, right? We're talking about the war is ending and great job in the Middle East for Trump and
[00:46:12] Jared and the team. Border security immigration. Of course, a big win in terms of shutting the
[00:46:19] pit controversial on ice, but that's my personal stuff. So I'll leave it out here and we'll just
[00:46:23] talk about breast tax. If you look at where the country feels Trump has fallen short, it's where
[00:46:30] he's strongest or where he was elected for being so strong. Look at these last three here,
[00:46:36] Tremoff, the economy. 63% believe Trump is falling short. Looking out for the middle class,
[00:46:42] this is the one that should be the most disturbing. 65% of the country believes he's falling short
[00:46:47] and inflation in the cost of living 66%. If you look at this next chart, this one has been trending
[00:46:54] online. And I've been talking about unemployment and I've been attributing it to AI. I know some
[00:46:59] people think I'm crying wolf here or I'm the boy who cried wolf, but the statistics are starting
[00:47:04] to trend towards my position, I believe. And if you look at people who are age 20 to 24, they're at
[00:47:10] 9.2% unemployment and it is spiking. Why is it spiking? I can tell you from the front lines,
[00:47:18] hiring young people and being at startups with young people in them and talking to them about
[00:47:24] their contemporaries as companies cut and they use AI to solve problems, they're saying hiring
[00:47:31] young people and training them is not as rewarding or efficient as training an AI to do the same
[00:47:39] task. And why do you keep thinking it's AI? Even the Amazon cuts Andy Jassy on the earnings call
[00:47:45] said, this is not AI. This is us digesting all this hiring from Zurp and DEI. Yeah, I can answer
[00:47:52] that. Yeah, for sure he did say that. He did also say in his memo before that that he thought
[00:47:58] there would be a lot of changes because of AI and they had the leak memo that they would not be
[00:48:02] hiring those. But I'm talking here specifically about youth people. And so I'll take Jassy at his
[00:48:06] word, those 30,000 people are just redundancies. But what I'm seeing on the ground because I work
[00:48:12] with startups and I work with young folks who are in them, their contemporaries are not finding
[00:48:17] jobs in the companies that we see and the companies that are selling technology solutions are getting
[00:48:23] rid of what I'll call the entry level white collar work. In addition to this, student loan delinquencies
[00:48:30] also going up massively. They had a big hiatus. Yeah, but it doesn't this indicate that there's no
[00:48:36] ROI to this expensive degree. And a lot of cases that these kids are being sold. They're being
[00:48:42] foisted all this debt. This has been going on. Exactly. Before November of 2022 when Chattachee
[00:48:47] P. Launch, I don't think AI has had enough time to have a huge impact on this. Yeah, in this case,
[00:48:54] I think you're wrong respectfully, even though you're the ZAR of AI. I'm seeing it with young folks
[00:48:58] and I'm seeing it with the software that the companies I'm investing in are deploying in other
[00:49:03] companies. But we'll see who's right in the coming months and that inflation back up to 3%
[00:49:08] and so this is going to make it particularly hard to cut rates because the reason when we go back
[00:49:14] to slide number three there, the reason why people feel Trump has fallen so short on the economy
[00:49:21] and taking care of the middle class is because of inflation. Trump said over and over again and
[00:49:26] some people in the administration have been very publicly gaslighting in my opinion. The country
[00:49:31] is saying, hey, inflation is not happening. Inflation is happening. And Trump sold people that
[00:49:37] prices would go down. We're back up to 3% inflation folks. Not only is it not going down, it's going
[00:49:43] up. And I think when you put together what people are seeing, this focus on a big ballroom being
[00:49:51] at it, focus on tariffs, things that Americans are not seeing hit their wages and they're seeing
[00:49:58] their kids not be able to get jobs that 9%. This is what's concerning Americans. Trump has failed
[00:50:04] the middle class. That's the bottom line here. I don't think that that's true. The country does 66%
[00:50:11] of them. I think everybody can find a piece of data to hang their bias on. And I think that what
[00:50:19] this most recent spade of elections show is that most people are looking for some form of a price
[00:50:28] break. And so if you're a New York mayoral candidate and you offer giveaways, you get a lot of
[00:50:34] attention. If you're running for governor and you offer giveaways, you get a lot of attention.
[00:50:40] The question is why is that happening? And I think it's fair to say that the reason why that's
[00:50:44] happening is that we have now spent a lot of time setting the table for a wave of domestic policy
[00:50:55] initiatives. And I think now is just the opportunity to follow through on those. I think that what
[00:51:01] we need to do is we need to just figure out where the pressure is. And I think Trump is doing
[00:51:06] this. So for example, today he announced the Eli Lilly and Noah Nordes could be selling
[00:51:10] GLP ones for like $149 a dose. I think that's good. Is it as expansive? I think it could be
[00:51:18] probably more expansive. But there are all of these other programs that I think need to get addressed.
[00:51:23] The student loan thing is a key one. It's time for legislation that says we're going to stop
[00:51:28] federally undriding these things. Force it into the public market. Force it into the open.
[00:51:34] Allow transparent pricing of loans and risk. And you can stop that curve dead in its tracks.
[00:51:41] We need to clean up the AI stuff. So there's a bunch of things now where when the government shutdown
[00:51:45] ends, we just got to get to its legislative agenda and start to fix domestic policy. But you can't
[00:51:50] do that when folks won't even come together or folks won't even end the shutdown. So I think
[00:51:55] which isn't part of this is a frustration that's going to keep brewing that I think is less
[00:52:00] of a reflection on him. But more reflection on the point where we're at is that people want
[00:52:04] these structural problems fixed that can only happen through legislation. But that can't happen
[00:52:09] if the House and the Senate are not even convening because there's still a shutdown.
[00:52:12] Yeah. And people are seeing equity holders like us, people in crypto get rich. We're all up 20,
[00:52:20] 30% this year. And the working man in this country and the working woman is not. That's the truth
[00:52:26] of it. And I think that's why and 60% by the way, 65% of the country blame the Republicans for the
[00:52:32] shutdown. And people aren't getting food stamps. And you know, people aren't getting paid. And people
[00:52:38] see their healthcare prices are about to spike. So we're doing all these tax cuts. It's great that
[00:52:43] the economy's ripping for equity holders. But there's a reason why two thirds of the country feels
[00:52:48] this administration has failed the working man. It's time to get back to work. It's time for Trump
[00:52:53] and his group to get focused on the people who put him there. Not just the people like us who are
[00:52:59] extremely affluent already. What do you think, Brett? If you're right. And we have inflation over
[00:53:05] 3% next November. And you have higher youth unemployment. And the economy is only growing
[00:53:13] 1.5% and interest rates stay high. Then I think it'll be a rough midterm for the Republicans.
[00:53:21] I don't actually think that's the flight path for the country. I actually think you are going to
[00:53:25] get three to four rate cuts. I actually think you are going to see a reacceleration of GDP. I don't
[00:53:31] think that these job cuts are the result of AI. But that's what makes a market. I think you heard
[00:53:38] the president say after the elections this week that, you know, that there are a lot of things
[00:53:43] around affordability that got to be delivered that aren't being delivered. And that number 1
[00:53:48] affordability issue starts with interest rates being lower. And he's been pounding the table on
[00:53:52] that all year long. But listen, I think a big mistake by Republicans in this last election cycle
[00:53:59] is they weren't talking about affordability. And the people they lost to were talking about
[00:54:04] affordability. So I think on that score, you're correct. But I happen to think that inflation
[00:54:11] is going to continue rolling over. I think you see some one time effects in here. And so I'll take
[00:54:16] the under Jason with you. And you can I can have a little sideways. I'm just sharing the under next
[00:54:22] year. So can I respond? Of course. Yeah. That's why we're here. Yeah. You're really good at finding
[00:54:26] these cherry-pick charts. So let me show you a couple of them. So with respect to the job.
[00:54:32] Well, you find, like Jamal said, you find charts or polls that support the point you're trying to
[00:54:37] make, which is fine. But let me just show you a couple of the ones to provide some balance.
[00:54:40] So US white collar jobs is a percent of total employment in the US. Very steady line. You see
[00:54:47] a blip there around COVID because so many blue collar jobs were lost. So that created the
[00:54:52] percentage of white collar to bounce up. But post-COVID has been on a very stable trajectory.
[00:54:57] If it were true that we were seeing massive AI job loss, you would see the percent of white
[00:55:02] collar jobs dropping in the economy. That does not happen. Okay. And every time there is some sort
[00:55:08] of job loss story, you glom onto it being AI-related like you do with Amazon. And then Andy
[00:55:13] Jazzy comes out and refutes that. Then you're like, oh, no, I'm talking about spring in the future.
[00:55:17] So like you want to talk about your chart here. You'd like to talk about your chart.
[00:55:20] Is that chart ends in the first quarter of 2025? So it's missing the last two quarters.
[00:55:26] So now you're saying that all of a sudden this, this has just happened in the last six months.
[00:55:30] No, no, it's just, it's flat. You can see it's flat there for the four years. The percentage
[00:55:34] on your own chart. And it's that only goes to Q1. But sure, keep going. I don't see a big change here
[00:55:39] in the percent of white collar jobs. Yeah, I'm not even sure this is relevant without the last
[00:55:45] course. It is. If there was some sort of job shock in the economy, it would be white collar jobs
[00:55:49] who'd be affected, right? Well, I think the white collar jobs. You keep young people over the
[00:55:54] place of the narrative. Whenever we point out that I think it's happening with young folks. And
[00:55:59] then the number of layoffs right now is the largest number of layoffs we've had in a quarter
[00:56:02] since 2003. So this has been a lot of layoffs. I know it's hard to hear sacks, but this has
[00:56:09] been the largest number of layoffs in 20 years. It's not hard to hear. I think, look,
[00:56:14] you keep bringing up these anecdotes. And the plural of anecdotes is not data. So in any event,
[00:56:19] when I look at this chart, I see that there is no job loss shock in the economy. And that's
[00:56:26] what you've been claiming. And every time we specifically refute your anecdote, you're like,
[00:56:29] oh, no, no, that's going to happen in the future. So you don't know what the cause of that is.
[00:56:35] The cause of that could be the fact that all these kids graduating from college are woke and
[00:56:39] major in degrees that don't have economic value. You don't know what the problem is.
[00:56:44] You're just glomming on to this AI story because you just like it. You like this narrative.
[00:56:48] And you're, I'm just, I told you, you're narrative. That's, no, no, fed to the narrative by the media.
[00:56:53] Okay. No, no, I told you what it is. I'm just seeing the anecdotal stuff I see on the front lines
[00:56:58] is what I base it on. It's, it's not just me glomming on to random data.
[00:57:02] Okay. The second chart I want to bring up what you see here is median
[00:57:06] real wages earnings are going up. Now, if it's true that inflation is high and wages don't
[00:57:13] increase, then people's purchasing power will go down. But what we're seeing here is
[00:57:16] purchasing power is still going up. And we have seen that during the first year of the Trump
[00:57:20] administration. So look, it is true that Republicans need to focus on affordability.
[00:57:25] The price of gas and eggs, for example, has gone down. And we need to keep making progress
[00:57:31] in that area. I don't know if you saw the tweet by JD Vance, but he basically said that.
[00:57:36] Republicans need to focus on the domestic picture. And they will. Now, if you're talking about
[00:57:40] the election, one thing I want to point out is that all the major races were in blue territory.
[00:57:47] And we got blue results. So this wasn't like unexpected. And furthermore, Trump wasn't on the
[00:57:54] ballot. Now, I can see to you that Republicans have a problem that when Trump is not on the ballot,
[00:58:00] our voter turnout is lower. So in this election, the only thing that was a little disappointing,
[00:58:05] I think, was the gap and excitement between the Democrats and the Republicans. Democrats were
[00:58:09] able to turn out their voters. Republicans were not. And again, that's a problem that Republicans
[00:58:13] are going to have to solve for the midterms and in 2028, which is how do we turn out our base
[00:58:18] when Trump is not on the ballot? But you can't really lay that problem at Trump's feet. I mean,
[00:58:21] when he's on the ballot, he turns out the base and he wins. And that is the problem that we have
[00:58:26] to solve. So I agree with that part of it. And I agree with the part of it that said that
[00:58:33] Republicans now need to focus on the domestic picture. But look, one of the biggest problems we have
[00:58:37] right now is the government is shut down. Who does the public blame for that? Unfortunately,
[00:58:41] they're going to blame the party that's in power, not realizing that the reason why the Democrats
[00:58:47] are able to shut down the government is because of the filibuster. So unfortunately, I think the
[00:58:52] public perceives that they gave power to Republicans, but the government shut down. The reason for that
[00:58:58] is because Democrats can shut down the government with just 41 votes, basically. And President
[00:59:05] Trump has called for getting rid of the filibuster. If the Democrats won't reopen the government,
[00:59:09] I think we should do that. By the way, just to go off on this tangent for a second. Most people
[00:59:14] don't understand the filibuster or how it works or why that's even a part of democracy.
[00:59:18] Basically, what it says is that for votes where the filibuster is in play, you need 60 votes,
[00:59:24] you know, superjority in the Senate, as opposed to 50. If you ask most people in the country,
[00:59:28] what is democracy, they would say it's 50 plus one in the house, 50 plus one in the Senate,
[00:59:35] and the presidency. That's all you need. But that's not true. And the question is if Democrats
[00:59:41] won't reopen the government, then I think Republicans are within their rights to get rid of this
[00:59:45] filibuster. And we know that Democrats will do it. The next time the Democrats have the trifecta,
[00:59:50] they will absolutely get rid of the filibuster. We know that's true because when we interview Joe
[00:59:54] Manchin, he was very clear. He was asked by Schumer and Biden, let's vote out the filibuster.
[01:00:00] And he drew a bright line in the Senate and said, no, but you're right, they would have. And
[01:00:05] we're getting to a place where if these folks in the Senate and the House don't get back to work soon,
[01:00:11] there will be no domestic policy agenda that gets passed. There's critical crypto legislation,
[01:00:15] AI legislation, there's domestic health care and other legislation that has to have a chance
[01:00:20] to see the light of day. And so if you're not going to show up, then it doesn't leave many other
[01:00:26] options, except to get rid of the filibuster. Now that has all these downstream effects for when
[01:00:31] you're not in charge, right? Just because then it'll be a simple majority for the other team as well.
[01:00:36] Right. But you're right, Sachs, like we're getting to a point where there are two Democrats who
[01:00:40] are opposed to getting rid of the filibuster. It was Manchin and Sinema, they're now both gone.
[01:00:43] So the modern Democrats are largely out of the caucus now. And if and when, because at some point,
[01:00:49] the Democrats will at some point return to power, you know they're going to get rid of the filibuster.
[01:00:54] And here's the crazy thing. You can get rid of the filibuster with 50 votes in the Senate.
[01:00:59] I don't think people will realize that. So basically, you've got this custom, because that's all it is,
[01:01:04] this is a customer convention or tradition in the Senate of having this filibuster vote.
[01:01:09] But the majority can just get rid of it. And the Democrats already said they're going to.
[01:01:14] So why would the Republicans foolishly abide by this sort of gentleman's agreement that doesn't
[01:01:19] exist anymore? Hold themselves to a 60 vote majority. The country gave President Trump a mandate.
[01:01:25] They gave him a sweeping reelection, seven out of seven swing states, the House and the Senate.
[01:01:32] And they want results. And those results are being thwarted by a government shutdown. And more
[01:01:37] generally, by this crazy filibuster rule, why wouldn't we get rid of it now and actually pass the
[01:01:42] reform that the country wants? And then let's be judged on that in the midterms in in 2028.
[01:01:48] And if it ends up, if it ends up not being good, then we'll pay the price.
[01:01:51] That's right. Because so we should get to the election results. And then just as the,
[01:01:55] this is what they chart. I was mentioning sacks. Here's the layoffs for any October.
[01:02:01] Highest since 2003. So hey, listen, we're all trying to figure things out in real time here.
[01:02:07] But it's not just the oil and pod talking about what's going on here with jobs.
[01:02:11] It's a big discussion on CNBC and everywhere in between social media.
[01:02:15] I know. And I remember that article that got pulled up when we discussed for Amazon was
[01:02:20] basically automating its warehouses. And you were saying that this is like all AI related
[01:02:23] job loss. And then the article itself said that they bought a robotics company a decade ago.
[01:02:28] And this was all on trend for what they've been planning for a decade. And the human oil
[01:02:31] robots aren't even here. And then you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm talking about the, you know,
[01:02:35] the Tesla Optimus robot that'll be here in a few years. It's like, you keep pivoting between
[01:02:39] what's going to happen in the future and what's happening right now? I know you're trying to win
[01:02:42] the debate club, but you're, you're, you're misconstricting my point. You're trying to spend like
[01:02:45] my point of view. And you're the greatest debate club captain. I'm not trying to debate. I'm just
[01:02:49] putting out facts here for the audience. You are debating me. No, no, no, I'm just putting out facts
[01:02:53] here as the world's greatest moderator. You're putting out spin. It's okay. It's not. Go ahead,
[01:02:57] spin. Okay, spin away. Take it easy to debate club captain. Don't pretend you're not debating
[01:03:02] when you're debating. Okay, just debate. It's okay. Don't be a f***ing say it.
[01:03:10] It's okay to debate. Just disagree with me. Don't pretend you're not. Here's the thing. The
[01:03:14] the 600,000 jobs is what they were saying in a leaked document, Amazon, that they were not going
[01:03:20] to fill the automation group. You want to be a defender of the week and the plighted. And the
[01:03:24] problem is, once again, you're trying to diminish me by saying this is virtually what I'm trying
[01:03:28] to do is balance out the fact that you two guys are captured and are no longer objective on this
[01:03:32] podcast. You see the objective voice out of reality where the CEO said the exact opposite and you
[01:03:38] won't take him at your word. He said that a week later. Okay, so you get a week to make up your own
[01:03:43] bullshit. Doesn't make it right. He was here. Here's where they literally were saying in the
[01:03:47] leaked documents that they had a PR crisis on their hand. And they were going to try to spin.
[01:03:51] Jay said job losses. And part of what he said, they were going to do us.
[01:03:54] Trillion dollar public companies said on the record and filed with the SEC.
[01:03:58] Sure. At the reason he did these layoffs was because of Zurpen DEI.
[01:04:03] There's two sets of layoffs. One of them is the 30,000 white collar people. Sure, we'll take
[01:04:08] them on his word. The other one is that they're canceling jobs explicitly because of the AI that
[01:04:14] they're planning to deploy and that they're making PR plans to cover themselves for how bad
[01:04:19] that looks to them. Let's move on to my dummy. I want to read you something from Morgan Stanley
[01:04:24] this week on this question of are the job losses caused by AI or they caused by something else?
[01:04:30] And the title of this section is flatter as faster. It says, you know, the cynical take has always
[01:04:36] been that this just wouldn't last that companies wouldn't be able to maintain this level of discipline
[01:04:40] and that they were doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. It's never different this time as
[01:04:46] they say. But the cynical take seems wrong again. And the number of examples of companies that
[01:04:52] have adopted this mindset, culture, behavior of efficiency and getting fit appears to be growing
[01:04:59] quarterly. Guess what? It's cool to have fat margins, no debt, maximum flexibility and be efficient
[01:05:05] and more faster credit, ashton, Curtis. But they're saying, you know, they're out there talking
[01:05:10] to the company. So I'm not saying that there's no AI effect. But the idea that you're going to hang
[01:05:15] all of these layoffs on AI. I would just think it would hang them all on you. I think there's
[01:05:20] if you're a CEO, hold on. I'm going to be very clear. I am not hanging them all on you.
[01:05:24] They're saying for the young folks, that's what I suspect is happening there. For the existing
[01:05:29] process, I do agree that they're all getting rid of excess fat and they want to be a leader and they
[01:05:34] want to juice their earnings. Those are two different things. Okay. Now, let's go on to
[01:05:39] Montgomery because it's getting boring. We're starting to circle here. This is all Ron has one
[01:05:43] New York City. The Dems won across the board. Zoron won every borrow except Stan Island. You finished
[01:05:52] with 50.4% of the vote. Nine point lead over Cuomo. Curtis was a distant third at 7%. No surprise
[01:06:02] if you're on polymarket because they have been saying this for months. Pull up the chart,
[01:06:06] producer Nick. Thank you. He's been a big favorite since he crushed Cuomo in the primary in June
[01:06:13] and he's held the lead the whole way. He's self-proclaimed democratic socialist. Some people
[01:06:20] think he's a communist and he's the first Muslim mayor and the youngest in over 100 years.
[01:06:29] Big promises seem to have resonated with young folks, especially women in New York,
[01:06:33] affordability, rent freezes, free public transit, higher taxes on the rich. You're going to pay an
[01:06:38] extra 2% and it'll be 54% with the highest tax rate in New York, the highest tax rate in the nation.
[01:06:44] And hilariously, he had supervillain leader Khan to his transition team and she's going to go
[01:06:51] break up the bodegas and shout out to our friend. He's not here today. The Sultan of
[01:06:56] Science David Freerberg predicted the rise of socialism on this very show about six months before
[01:07:02] anybody knew who Zoran was. Here's the clip. Give him his flowers. He's not here. The party line is
[01:07:10] that socialism was defeated in this election cycle and that there was a resounding kind of vote
[01:07:18] from the American populace against socialism and I actually think my my country and belief is
[01:07:23] that we'll see a rise a dramatic rise in socialist movements in 2025 in the United States. We're
[01:07:30] going to see an unleashing of economic growth because of deregulation and AI. There's going to be
[01:07:35] some parts of the economy that are going to be big winners and some parts of the economy that are
[01:07:38] going to be big losers. When you have this sort of a change this fast, there are often large
[01:07:43] contingents of people that are left behind and when that happens, I do think that the socialist
[01:07:48] policies and the socialist movements gain steam. Growth does not mean that it benefits everyone
[01:07:53] equally and I think that some folks will see people go from being billionaires to 100 billionaires
[01:07:58] to the world's first trillionaire and it will also start to fuel this rise. So I think that
[01:08:02] we will see an increase in the breadth and depth of socialist movements in the United States.
[01:08:07] Shema, what can we learn from the Mamdami? Peter Tio predicted this in 2020.
[01:08:14] There was a bunch of leaked memos between Peter and Zuck and Andreessen but he put his finger on it
[01:08:19] in January of 2020. I retweeted it out. Basically what Tio said was from the perspective of a broken
[01:08:27] generational compact, there seems to be a pretty straightforward answer to me, namely that when one
[01:08:32] has too much student debt or if housing is too unaffordable, then one will have negative capital
[01:08:38] for a long time and or find it very hard to start accumulating capital in the form of real estate.
[01:08:44] And if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it.
[01:08:50] This has been floating around for years and I think Tio yet again has seen the forest from the
[01:08:56] trees many years ago. So yeah, what is happening? I think that we've put our finger on it. We need
[01:09:03] to come back and now focus on domestic policy and fix some of these core pernicious issues.
[01:09:10] One is clearly that we now need to address how student loans are underwritten.
[01:09:17] We cannot allow generation after generation of people to graduate from degrees that they don't
[01:09:22] quite understand with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt that they have zero
[01:09:28] chance of paying on. That is a horrible way to start your life and we have not done right by
[01:09:34] these folks. We need the free market to be able to tell somebody as hard as it may sound to
[01:09:39] hear that an art history PhD will cost you $800,000 so that the people that take it
[01:09:47] have the money or are ruling to bear that cost. Meanwhile, if you became an electrician,
[01:09:53] it would only cost you 40 or 50,000 and you could have an incredible life.
[01:09:57] Or if you go and get a degree in AI or stats or something, my point is that we need to
[01:10:02] differentially price degrees based on the value and the earnings power that it creates for people.
[01:10:08] That is a policy level initiative that needs to cascade through America that cannot happen if
[01:10:14] the government is not working. So we need to fix that. The problem with housing is much more
[01:10:20] state and local and I'm not sure I have a great diagnosis for how to fix that except that certain
[01:10:26] states just need to get their act together. I mean, in California, we have just absolutely
[01:10:30] abysmal building regulations that prevent anything and anybody from doing anything. So
[01:10:35] that's what we need to do. We need to fix these things legislatively. We need to do it right away
[01:10:40] and we need to fix this broken generational compact. This was the first moment in years
[01:10:47] where I have now become sympathetic to this idea of student alone forgiveness. I was never
[01:10:52] sympathetic to this idea. I am sympathetic to it now. Why are you sympathetic to it?
[01:10:57] Because I think that we should have fixed this problem a long time ago. We should have not allowed
[01:11:04] these loans to be underwritten the way that it was for so long not allowed all of these effective
[01:11:11] subsidies to pervert the free market's ability to tell people that some of these degrees were not
[01:11:18] worth their time. We have a balance here today saying that they're not going to hire from college
[01:11:23] anymore. Let me build on that. Okay. So look, I just on the narrow loan forgiveness point.
[01:11:29] So I actually agree that maybe loans should be forgiven if you get a total overhaul of the system.
[01:11:34] What you don't want to do is acknowledge that all the loans are bad and they need to be written
[01:11:37] off and then continue making them. And that was a problem with I think the Biden loan
[01:11:41] forgiveness program is he's going to write off trillions of dollars of loans while keep funding
[01:11:45] the system without any reform. So let's talk about a big reform package where we completely
[01:11:50] re-underwrite how we do this and maybe some loans forgiveness can be part of that so that we don't
[01:11:54] have all these kids graduating who are basically socialists because they're so deeply in debt.
[01:11:59] They're never going to own capital in the system. By the way, Jay-Cal, maybe the fact that all
[01:12:04] these millennials are socialists might have something to do with the fact they're unemployable.
[01:12:09] Who the hell wants to hire? Fair enough. Young Lenin 2.0 communist revolutionary to be in their
[01:12:16] company. If they don't believe in capitalism, how they're going to work the way up through a
[01:12:19] capitalist system? Just saying. Just saying. Just saying. Best point so far.
[01:12:24] Maybe it has something to do with the fact that all these kids are socialists and
[01:12:29] junior communist revolutionary rather than blaming our favorite scapegoat AI. Okay, so anyway,
[01:12:35] that's that point. Now in terms of mom Donnie getting elected, you got to remember New York City is
[01:12:40] like 80-20 Democrat and he won very narrowly. It was like 50.4% of the vote. So this was not some
[01:12:46] overwhelming victory. It was a narrow victory. He squeaked by but he did win and it's because the
[01:12:53] base of the Democratic Party is energized by this socialist ideology. So what we saw in this election,
[01:12:59] I think, was blue cities and states getting blue or meaning moving to the left. And that is a
[01:13:07] problem that is a little bit scary because historically in this country, the politics was played
[01:13:12] between the 40-yard lines. You didn't have one of the parties being fundamentally a revolutionary
[01:13:17] party. And it does seem like the Democratic Party is gradually becoming a party of mem Donnie's
[01:13:22] and Katie Porter's and genuine social revolutionaries. And you know, if we ultimately lose,
[01:13:29] then the country's going to be in for a big shock. But I don't think that's going to happen,
[01:13:33] though. But this is why I think we should take very seriously the idea of if the shutdown continues
[01:13:40] and the filibuster because while the country has empowered Republicans with all the different parts
[01:13:46] of the federal government, we have to deliver genuine results now. Otherwise, these socialists
[01:13:50] are going to take over in three years. Brad, what was your take on this? I know you were involved
[01:13:56] in a debate, abandoned the billionaires debate that you did very bravely. I don't know if you can
[01:14:01] talk about it or not. I know it was at a certain university. I'll leave it at that. But if you were
[01:14:07] willing to talk about it a little bit, I think it relates and dovetails quite nicely with what happened
[01:14:11] in New York. And by the way, I think the most important statistics since my hometown, I think
[01:14:17] a lot of New Yorkers don't fall for this kind of bullshit that he's spinning. And if you look at
[01:14:21] the chart, if you could pull up the chart, Nick, of people who were born in New York, as opposed to
[01:14:26] people who have been there. So if you look at that bottom one, I was born in New York City.
[01:14:30] 38% of those people went for a mandami and the other 60% went for the other two candidates. But if
[01:14:37] you were there for less than five years or less than 10 years, 78 and 85% chance you voted for him,
[01:14:44] the people who were not born there, they fell for it. This guy's a charlatan. Nothing he says he's
[01:14:49] going to do is going to happen. It's going to be total complete utter chaos, Brad. Your thoughts on
[01:14:56] what we're getting like bigger picture, not just what's happening in New York, but what you heard
[01:15:00] when you debated kids about banned the billionaires and socialists. Yes.
[01:15:06] Yeah, so the debate was at Stanford sponsored by the economics department, or whether or not
[01:15:10] billionaires should be allowed to exist in America. I can't talk about, you know, what we debated
[01:15:15] in the room is Chatham House rules, but I will tell you this, that a proponderance of people on
[01:15:19] their way in, you know, thought that they should, you know, ban billionaires in the United States,
[01:15:24] right? I think it's a fundamental fight for the soul of America going on right now. This goes to
[01:15:30] the very basic premise of the American dream. You know, is there economic mobility in America?
[01:15:36] But I think Republicans have to get real about this. I think they have the president ran on a
[01:15:40] main street agenda. He passed the Invest America Act. I think he absolutely gets what's at stake.
[01:15:46] 70% of people feel left out and left behind. They feel like the system is rigged against him.
[01:15:51] And when you have somebody like Montgomery who comes along and promises everything under the
[01:15:55] sun for free that he can solve all of these problems, I think it's very enticing for young people
[01:16:00] who are frustrated. They also don't do any diligence because he can't deliver on any of these
[01:16:05] promises. It's not allowed to as mayor. It takes the state assembly. You know,
[01:16:09] Chimath and I were with Vivek Ramaswami last night and Vivek tweeted about this yesterday.
[01:16:13] Republicans have to talk about the issue of affordability, right? And I think they really have
[01:16:20] a good game plan around the main street agenda for affordability. Remember, no tax on tips.
[01:16:25] That doesn't help rich people, helps people who are feeling left out. No tax on overtime,
[01:16:30] helps people who are feeling left out. But that's getting drowned out, you know, Jason,
[01:16:34] as you pointed out in the moment by people who feel like their grocery bills are going up,
[01:16:39] the cost of rent is going up, etc. So that is going to be the struggle over the course of the next
[01:16:44] 12 months. That is the battling narrative. And in the Democratic Party, clearly, this was,
[01:16:49] remember, this was a fight within the Democratic Party between Andrew Cuomo and Mamdani and the
[01:16:55] centrist Democrats are losing to, you know, kind of the more socialist party, wing of the party.
[01:17:01] And I think on a national level, folks in Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, they don't fall for that.
[01:17:06] They believe in the American dream. They believe in economic mobility. They may be frustrated by
[01:17:11] affordability, but they're not ready to burn down capitalism in the way that Mamdani is suggesting.
[01:17:17] Those voters may not want to burn down capitalism, but that's what they're going to get,
[01:17:21] because we have a two party system in America. And if the Democrats go socialist,
[01:17:25] and then they get the trifecta and they get rid of the filibuster, that's what they're going to
[01:17:29] impose. I think the person who wins 2028 is the person who puts this much energy into, say,
[01:17:37] building data centers or ballrooms as puts into building affordable housing. That will be
[01:17:43] a great thing for somebody running in 2028 to champion. What do you guys think? Young women
[01:17:50] overwhelmingly supported Mamdani. The vibes?
[01:17:55] No, look, I think there's a lot of polling showing that between young people and old people,
[01:18:02] young people are much further left. And as between women and men, women are much further left.
[01:18:06] So like the most left-wing group of the electorate is young female professionals,
[01:18:12] add the professionals versus blue collar, so basic professional class versus working classes,
[01:18:16] another very important overlay. It might also be there's the overlay sacks of
[01:18:21] Cuomo being me too, as well. So maybe some women didn't feel comfortable voting for him. He's a
[01:18:26] particularly odious candidate, by the way. The worst candidate ever. Yeah. I agree that he is a
[01:18:31] weak candidate. He kind of represents this like washed up establishment vibe. It's not a fresh
[01:18:37] candidate at all. That's a problem. But look, the Democratic establishment did a terrible job
[01:18:44] here that not only was Cuomo the candidate they put forward, but also they law-fared Eric Adams.
[01:18:48] They basically wrecked his mayorship through this really weak law fair based on like airplane
[01:18:53] upgrades or whatever. And they did that because they thought they're going to be able to get a
[01:18:56] more compliant establishment figure in the role. And it completely backfired. And they end up with
[01:19:01] Mamdani who hates them as much as they hate Trump. So the establishment Democrat wing of that party
[01:19:08] has completely failed. But look, this is what we're seeing across the country is that the so-called
[01:19:12] centrist Democrats that mentions the cinemas. They're being driven out of the party. And all
[01:19:17] the energy is with this base that's turned socialist. And so Brad, this is where I get very nervous.
[01:19:23] Yeah, it's true. Like the American Heartland does not want a communist revolution. But if these
[01:19:27] guys get power, then that's what we're in for. So it is pretty scary. How are we vulnerable homes
[01:19:33] and this will end? How are we vulnerable homes? San Francisco ran this experiment. We have people,
[01:19:40] you know, feces in the street. We had people dying in the street, etc. Daniel Lurie, a centrist
[01:19:45] Democrat gets elected in San Francisco now is putting the city back on the right trajectory.
[01:19:50] And New York is heading in the exact opposite direction. That's going to be a really interesting
[01:19:54] AB test for America. Because I think San Francisco is trending in the right direction. I think that
[01:20:00] you know, to the extent that Mamdani can do any of these things he's talking about. He's going to
[01:20:04] put New York City on a very, very bad track. In addition to all the economic redistribution, the idea
[01:20:09] the government is going to run grocery stores and things like that. He's also said he's going to
[01:20:13] abolish all the gifted programs in New York City schools. And he wants to close Rikers and he believes
[01:20:19] in, you know, cashless bail. I think that's the plot of the second dark night movie by Christopher
[01:20:23] Nolan. It's awesome. No, that's awesome. I mean, that's awesome. I mean, like the Joker and the
[01:20:27] Sandman come out. Okay. So speaking of which, at least I think New York City's got multiple
[01:20:33] jails in LA right now. There's only one county jail. It's like, I think it's called like the men's
[01:20:38] county jail or something like that. And the board of supervisors for LA County has been talking
[01:20:45] about shutting that down because it has fallen to disrepair and needs to be upgraded. They have a
[01:20:50] $50 billion budget. They haven't allocated any money towards building a new jail. And now they're
[01:20:55] talking about demolishing that jail without a replacement and just having all the inmates basically
[01:21:00] be sent to diversion or social services, which means they get an ankle bracelet and they're
[01:21:04] turned down the street. There's 7,000 of the most hardened criminals are in that jail. And half
[01:21:10] of them are like severe mentally disturbed cases like the guy who killed Brianna Cupfer.
[01:21:16] So they're talking about doing this right now. There was supposed to be a vote. A couple of
[01:21:19] weeks ago, they're going to make new jails is the idea. They're going to shut down this. No,
[01:21:22] they have not allocated any money towards building a new jail. They should have done it years ago.
[01:21:26] And they're actively discussing whether they are going to shut down this jail, whether they're
[01:21:30] going to demolish it and send all the inmates to diversion of social services. This is a serious
[01:21:36] possibility in LA County right now. That's insane. So they've gone from defund the police to demolish
[01:21:42] the jails. Yeah, Mondami's been trying to clean that up and saying he's not going to shut it
[01:21:48] down without the new ones belt. But yeah, Arkham, Arkham aside. It is not a great idea. It's like
[01:21:53] releasing all the crazy people. Yeah. Well, I mean, and a lot of these people who are in jail are
[01:21:59] actually suffering from mental illness. And we should definitely have addressed that as well at
[01:22:03] the same time. Jake, how are you doing? Found a university you're trying to raise money. What
[01:22:07] are you doing over there? So we did a deal with Sonobl to bring Founda University to Riyadh.
[01:22:12] And we were going to have 25 companies and mostly Saudi nationals and then teach them how to
[01:22:18] build companies and like the best practices from America. We had so many applications. It went to
[01:22:23] 50. Then it was like all these people we know trying to get people into the program. So we wound
[01:22:29] up with 60 companies and I spent three days working with them. Really great like FinTech,
[01:22:34] construction technology, real estate stuff. It was really inspiring. And I saw all of our friends
[01:22:40] from Saudi there. And then I saw that I think did you have Tariq from Humane actually talked
[01:22:45] to the found Tariq came. Yeah. And he made an offer to them to give them. He matched the Google
[01:22:50] offer for computing with all of them. So just giving them a bunch of credits and Tariq came by.
[01:22:56] And it was really nice of him to come by. He was going to his board meeting and he came to
[01:23:01] speak to 60 founders. There were probably like 60 teams but maybe 90 founders in the room.
[01:23:07] It's a tiny little thing and a lot of people came out to support it because they're trying to get
[01:23:13] more domestic startup. Totally. So it was really good. And then since
[01:23:19] that went so well, the Jetro, which is the enterprise trade organization of Japan called me and
[01:23:28] said, we want to do it in Japan. So I'm leaving here to go to Japan and announce the launch of it.
[01:23:34] Oh wow. And then we'll have it in three cities, the United States or three countries,
[01:23:38] United States, Saudi and Japan, which will officially start in January. I'm just going there to do
[01:23:44] like a press tour about it. Now are those to feed the funnel of angel investments for you or
[01:23:51] you make money on this? So we had a feed around the program but it's not going to match venture
[01:23:57] investing obviously. It just kind of underwrites the cost of it. And then that creates the funnel,
[01:24:02] about 5% of the companies that come to five to 10% of the companies that come to Founder University
[01:24:07] wind up going to the accelerator or we make a direct investment. So it's a pre-accelerator but
[01:24:12] it lets us get to the companies before tech stars or why combinators or other folks even know
[01:24:17] they exist because half of them aren't incorporated yet. So that's kind of the exciting part about
[01:24:22] is we meet them when they're just two or three people working on a prototype. It is there were,
[01:24:28] I've had two angels, three angels come in or three Founders come in here over the course of
[01:24:32] the last two years. Two, I did angel investments and the third, I did not, unfortunately.
[01:24:41] But they, their valuations of those three companies. One is cognition, not 15 billion. One is
[01:24:47] decogon, now at four billion. And you know, and the other one is distilled that just raised it
[01:24:54] two billion. I mean the rate at which these companies are scaling for the best companies really.
[01:24:59] I mean, it's pretty angel money now, real money. It's going to be interesting to see, you know,
[01:25:07] how resilient and robust this revenue is, you know, in turn and totally people sampling stuff.
[01:25:15] But it's feeling pretty good right now. The cohort data for people who have had products out
[01:25:19] for six, seven, eight months, starting to turn into the smile where the cohorts like go down, down,
[01:25:25] but then they turn back up, which means people who, you know, signed up for it, forgot they were
[01:25:29] using it and then they came back and started using it again. It's a really good sign for some of
[01:25:34] these companies. All right, listen, great show everybody. We got through a lot. And everybody come
[01:25:41] to the holiday, we're going to be a holiday cheer. Saxony will be pouring eggnog and singing
[01:25:47] paralleling songs. It's going to be wonderful Saturday, December 6th. Join us all in.com slash
[01:25:53] events. Brad, are you going to join us as fifth bestie at the all in holiday special?
[01:25:59] Who's dealing? We got some poker up there. If there's poker, yes.
[01:26:03] Absolutely. There'll be some poker. Yes. Christmas poker with the besties. Love it.
[01:26:07] All right, everybody. We'll see you next time. Bye bye. Love you, Bruce. Bye bye.
[01:26:18] We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:26:24] Love you, West. I'll be queen. I'll be queen. I'll be queen.
[01:26:28] One, one, one, one, one, one, one. Besties are gone.
[01:26:36] That's my dog. Can you give it to me? I wish you drive away.
[01:26:41] Oh, man, my hamster will meet me. We should all just get a room and just have one big hug
[01:26:46] George because they're all just like this like sexual tension that we just need to release
