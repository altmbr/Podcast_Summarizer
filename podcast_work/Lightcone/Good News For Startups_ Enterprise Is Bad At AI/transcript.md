[00:00:00] Engineering teams at these orgs are filled with people that themselves don't actually really believe in AI.
[00:00:05] Jared: Don't use code gen tools, think it's all super over-hyped,
[00:00:08] Jared: are really excited when an MIT study comes out saying that it's all by hype and retweeted.
[00:00:12] Jared: And really one, because it's a narrative they want to believe.
[00:00:15] Jared: But the consequence of that for the companies is that they can't build the product.
[00:00:19] Jared: So if your engineers don't believe in this, then how are you going to build a product that actually works?
[00:00:23] Jared: Then not going to affect for startups, then as if you can actually build something that works,
[00:00:26] Jared: the enterprises will talk to you because they have no other options.
[00:00:28] Jared: You can't build it internally, you can't go to an established company.
[00:00:31] Jared: So the startups are actually getting the shot that they've never had before.
[00:00:34] Jared: I guarantee you someone is watching this right now,
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: and you've just horribly triggered them.
[00:00:47] Welcome back to another episode of The Lightcon.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_00: One of the things that has been really pissing me off is these AI influencers.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: You see them on X, you see them on YouTube,
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: and they're claiming that 95% of AI projects are failures,
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_00: and that's proof that AI is a scam.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_00: What's the real story, Jared?
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_00: You actually dug in to the MIT report that these people are grifting with.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: What does the report actually say?
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_00: What really went viral was like tweets about this study.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_03: And I think the tweets are actually quite misleading.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_03: Diane and I were talking to a bunch of college students recently,
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_03: and they had concluded just by reading the tweet version of the study
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_03: that like, oh, all these AI startups that YC is talking about must not be working
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_03: because the study says that they all fail.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_03: But actually, the more I read the study,
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_03: the more I realized it was actually confirming a lot of the things we've talked about here
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_03: on this podcast about what AI agents are really like in the real world
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_03: and what approaches and categories are working.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_03: And so I thought it'd be interesting for us to talk about what the study really says.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_03: Because there's a very different approach to the go-to market for all these AI solutions.
[00:02:00] Andy: It's not just standard enterprise sales.
[00:02:03] Andy: I think one of the big things that we talk a lot about is this aspect of teams start up
[00:02:10] Andy: and founders embedding themselves into the business processes
[00:02:14] and really rocking a lot of the internal systems of record
[00:02:18] Andy: and going deep, deep, deep in the integration,
[00:02:21] Andy: which is not something that is been typically done in the SaaS world SaaS
[00:02:24] Andy: was like very plug and play, which is different.
[00:02:28] But when you do succeed and plug into the systems of record,
[00:02:32] the part of gold is actually quite big.
[00:02:34] But it does take a long time.
[00:02:35] Andy: We actually have a little examples and work with companies that have succeeded,
[00:02:38] Andy: which we can talk about later.
[00:02:40] Andy: You had a really great wave,
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_03: like having a mental model of what typically happens when an enterprise tries to adopt AI
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_03: and like, why the failure rate is so high.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_03: Can you give us some intuition?
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, if you think about enterprises are trying to get something done
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: and they've got internal IT or sometimes when internal IT doesn't do it,
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_00: they go out and they get an Ernst & Young
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_00: or they get some much bigger consulting shop, a Deloitte to come in.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_00: And it turns out if anyone has ever used internal IT systems,
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_00: generally internal IT systems are bad.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: And then not only that, if you decide that you can't build it in-house
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_00: and you have to go to consulting, well, now you've got two problems.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_00: The output of the study is no surprise to me
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: in that the majority of software that actually gets built in the world is very, very bad.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_00: To be fair to IT consultants, Apple is very bad at software.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: My favorite example is Apple,
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: the company that can have infinite access to capital
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: and infinite access to the smartest people in the world.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_00: All of us use iPhones and I use the calendar app.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: I think you guys do too. We use it many times per day due to our schedules.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: And even the calendar app is a piece of trash.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: You probably run into some sort of weird bug in that almost every single day.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: So Apple, a company with infinite resources
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: and infinite access to the smartest people in the world,
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: cannot make a good calendar app.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_00: So if that's true for Apple,
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: how could any normal company let alone an internal IT system,
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: let alone like Deloitte or Ernst & Young,
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_00: like very well-meaning people,
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: but most of the time,
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: the output of something like that is bad.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: I think a lot of what goes on is that in the big enterprises,
[00:04:32] Jared: to really deploy sophisticated software,
[00:04:36] Jared: it usually has to be used by multiple teams across the org.
[00:04:39] Jared: And so big enterprises,
[00:04:41] Jared: there's always going to be political battles and turf wars
[00:04:44] Jared: and various things going on.
[00:04:46] Jared: And so part of the reason I think these enterprises go to consultants
[00:04:49] Jared: is you can go to Ernst & Young and get them to meet with the data science team,
[00:04:53] Jared: the customer support team, the IT team,
[00:04:56] Jared: and write up a bunch of docs about what everyone wants
[00:04:59] Jared: and sort of almost play some sort of media role of,
[00:05:01] Jared: hey, here's kind of what we're aligned on,
[00:05:03] Jared: and here's the spec that will work for everyone.
[00:05:05] Jared: The challenge is then you actually have to,
[00:05:07] Jared: which I think is valuable,
[00:05:08] Jared: but then for the next step is to actually implement that.
[00:05:11] Jared: And at which point the consultants don't have the technical expertise
[00:05:14] Jared: to build the software.
[00:05:15] Jared: And then often in the enterprise,
[00:05:17] Jared: even if they have an internal software team,
[00:05:18] Jared: the systems are just so old and siloed that you actually need
[00:05:23] Jared: both the external consultancy expertise to bring everyone together,
[00:05:27] Jared: but then also the software expertise to actually build the systems.
[00:05:30] Jared: And is the thing that you end up with at the end,
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_03: like basically a camel horse design Bayer?
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, come in.
[00:05:36] Jared: I think Jarrin May actually now summer 2020,
[00:05:40] Jared: so a while ago worked with a company called Tactile
[00:05:42] Jared: that's building sort of like a high level,
[00:05:44] Jared: like a business decision engine for banks in particular.
[00:05:47] Jared: So it does things like in real time can help them go through like KYC and AML
[00:05:53] Jared: to figure out someone who's applied for a loan, for example,
[00:05:56] Jared: and then instantly figure out,
[00:05:57] Jared: oh yeah, like does this person have the right credit?
[00:05:59] Jared: Do they meet the right business rules and do that,
[00:06:01] Jared: like, you know, millions of times per day at scale?
[00:06:04] Jared: The banks themselves, like city bank and JP Morgan,
[00:06:08] Jared: have tried to build this kind of software themselves,
[00:06:11] Jared: and it's to in each case, it's taken years,
[00:06:13] Jared: three to five years and tens of millions of dollars
[00:06:15] Jared: to actually get this implemented,
[00:06:17] Jared: whereas Tactile was able to build a rest API
[00:06:20] Jared: that makes decisions in real time.
[00:06:22] Jared: You can plug the latest AI models into it,
[00:06:25] Jared: and they've been able to do that all for a fraction of the budget
[00:06:27] Jared: and in way less time.
[00:06:29] And there's a company that I worked with called Greenlight
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_03: that also sells AI systems to banks,
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_03: and they were telling me a story that is exactly long lines of a Gary
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_03: who was talking about where there is a bank
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_03: that they were trying to sell to,
[00:06:42] and the deal fell through,
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_03: because the bank had an existing relationship with Ernst and Young,
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_03: who apparently builds all the software for the bank,
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_03: which is apparently not that uncommon.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_03: And they're like, well, you know,
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_03: we trust or vendor Ernst and Young,
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_03: we've been working with them for years,
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_03: they say that they're gonna build this AI system.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_03: And that's where they got it all wrong.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_03: As Ernst and Young spends a year trying to build this AI system,
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_03: it doesn't work at all,
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_03: and the bank comes back to Greenlight,
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_03: is like, actually, could you guys build this for us?
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_03: And Greenlight now has their system,
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_03: like fully deployed at the bank, and it's actually working.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_03: An interesting thing about the report
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_03: is that of the products that they surveyed,
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_03: two thirds of them were projects
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_03: where the enterprise built an internal software project
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_03: or did it with the help of a consulting agency,
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_03: and only one third was once where they bought a product
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_03: from an outside agency like a Greenlight.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_03: And so enterprises are mostly trying to build things in-house,
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_03: but the success rate of the ones where the enterprise
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_03: went with an outside vendor,
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_03: like a Greenlight or a tactile was much higher
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_03: than a success rate of when they tried to build stuff themselves.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_03: I mean, why do you think this is?
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: I certainly have my theories,
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: but going back to the Apple thing,
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: my sense is that there actually just aren't that many people
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_00: who are polymaths enough to be good at product
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: and good at engineering to make things that actually work.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: There are lots of people out there
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: who are really, really good engineers,
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_00: but maybe they're just in the coding cave all day
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_00: and they can't relate to someone working at a bank
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_00: because they just don't step outside of their coding cave.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_00: And then way over on the other end,
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: that goes back to the user.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: Why doesn't the user just do this?
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: There's some evidence that maybe they will.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: There are all these examples of people,
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_00: Varun Mohan from Windsor,
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: if mentioned that back when he was working on that
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: with his sales leader who might not have an engineering degree,
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: they used Windsor to create their own tools.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: So way out at like the 150 IQ type organizations in the world,
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: this is already happening.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: But for now, like a lot of the people
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_00: who really understand the domain, they can't code
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: or they don't understand tech
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: or they can't do design or product and ship it.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: So for now, there's just this startup shaped hole
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_00: in basically every process or every sort of annoying system
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_00: that should exist that doesn't exist yet.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: It's a very rare breed of skill sets
[00:09:09] Andy: where they have a lot of the extreme up-to-date
[00:09:15] Andy: ladies and graded AI understanding and product taste
[00:09:18] Andy: and at the same time to some extent,
[00:09:20] a lot of the kind of humanity in a sense
[00:09:22] Andy: to understand all the human processes
[00:09:25] Andy: to then grok those into a product.
[00:09:28] And I think there's a different permutation
[00:09:30] Andy: of what you both have mentioned around companies
[00:09:34] Andy: going after consultants as a solution as a vendor.
[00:09:37] Andy: This is company that Jerry and I were partners with, Castle AI.
[00:09:41] Andy: They're also selling two banks.
[00:09:43] Andy: There's a theme here.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: They're basically building AI mortgage servicer.
[00:09:48] Andy: There's a lot of vendors around that have been around
[00:09:51] Andy: for like decades with very old system
[00:09:54] Andy: and they're catching on as well.
[00:09:55] Andy: They know that their lunch is gonna get eaten.
[00:09:57] Andy: They're gonna get these vendors and they are adding AI
[00:10:00] Andy: on top of it.
[00:10:01] Andy: And what happens when Castle goes into
[00:10:04] Andy: all these sales conversations with their banks,
[00:10:06] Andy: they have to do a bake off with the current income bin solution.
[00:10:10] Andy: And it turns out what they learn,
[00:10:12] Andy: the banks still do it because they trust the vendor
[00:10:15] Andy: that been around with them for a long time,
[00:10:17] Andy: not just a consultant but regular old school software system.
[00:10:21] And funny thing is a lot of times these products
[00:10:25] Andy: are very subpar.
[00:10:26] Andy: The particular customers they work with,
[00:10:28] Andy: they like closed off the bake off because it's like,
[00:10:31] Andy: wow, this vendor solution was just AI slapped on top of it.
[00:10:35] Andy: So such thing as it could be AI on the vendor's side
[00:10:38] Andy: and they added, but it's lacking this aspect
[00:10:41] Andy: of being really native from the beginning
[00:10:44] Andy: and having that really good taste on the product.
[00:10:46] Andy: And this is how Castle has closed some of these larger banks,
[00:10:50] Andy: which is impressive, just one year after the batch now.
[00:10:54] YC's next batch is now taking applications.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: Gotta start up in you, apply at ycombinator.com slash apply.
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_00: It's never too early and filling out the app
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_00: will level up your idea.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_00: Okay, back to the video.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_03: And Andy, you have another example of a company
[00:11:11] speaking of Apple that actually sold to a thing company
[00:11:15] that had tried to implement an internal solution
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_03: and had it not work.
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_03: Maybe you can tell us about that.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_03: This is a very impressive case study.
[00:11:23] Andy: The company is called Redacto.
[00:11:25] Andy: They just announced their Series B recently
[00:11:29] and they actually closed a fan company 154 days after the batch,
[00:11:34] Andy: which is, I haven't seen that happen.
[00:11:37] Andy: And this big fan company reached out to them
[00:11:40] Andy: because they did a YC launch.
[00:11:43] Andy: That's how they found them.
[00:11:44] Andy: So our launches get people watching them
[00:11:47] Andy: and they reached out and they go,
[00:11:48] Andy: this is interesting, we'll love to try it
[00:11:51] Andy: and we've been working on a solution,
[00:11:52] Andy: turns out this particular company has been trying to,
[00:11:54] Andy: what Redacto does is document processing for AI.
[00:11:57] Andy: And this company has been having a lot of internal systems
[00:12:01] Andy: and build internal solutions for years
[00:12:04] Andy: to run a lot of the operations.
[00:12:06] Andy: And the solution, they try open source,
[00:12:11] Andy: they try AWS Tezirag, all sorts of OCR solutions
[00:12:17] Andy: and they were not cutting the mark.
[00:12:18] Andy: And this is where product excellence really got
[00:12:23] Andy: Redacto to win the deal and be a pretty big one.
[00:12:25] Andy: But the thing about this one that still took time
[00:12:27] Andy: to go through it, I mean,
[00:12:29] Andy: so Redacto had to compete with internal team
[00:12:32] Andy: and they had to have a lot of finesse
[00:12:34] Andy: to navigate a lot of the politics,
[00:12:36] Andy: which is actually one of the aspects
[00:12:38] Andy: that the MIT paper does talk.
[00:12:40] Andy: So we do agree with that.
[00:12:41] Andy: There's still a lot of work to get there,
[00:12:44] Andy: but they got it done and it's still like hard.
[00:12:45] Andy: But at the end of it, they do have this awesome deal
[00:12:49] Andy: with them and they've been live in production
[00:12:51] Andy: for more than a year or two now.
[00:12:53] Andy: Yeah, what was the secret to avoid pissing off
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_00: the wrong people, you know, still be in the running
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: and eventually win?
[00:13:02] Andy: This is where you do things that don't scale.
[00:13:03] Andy: One of the things that they did is they became
[00:13:06] Andy: really good friends with the champion
[00:13:08] Andy: and really building friendship with them.
[00:13:10] Andy: And they saw that, oh, there's these really smart kids.
[00:13:15] Andy: And I wanted to get shot on them.
[00:13:16] Andy: And this is what I think a lot of the story
[00:13:19] Andy: around YC Founders selling to big enterprises.
[00:13:21] Andy: I think there's something about this ambition
[00:13:24] Andy: and really optimism from founders that is contagious
[00:13:27] Andy: that really gets people excited.
[00:13:29] Andy: He's like, this is a bit of a boring problem
[00:13:30] Andy: to like process documents, but you're super jazz about it.
[00:13:33] Andy: And I'll give you a shot.
[00:13:34] Andy: And then when they do, they surpass a lot of the expectations
[00:13:38] Andy: and then it's cool.
[00:13:39] Andy: I've heard it's actually sort of a particular archetype
[00:13:41] Jared: of big company employee.
[00:13:43] Jared: Someone that really wants to do a startup
[00:13:45] Jared: or has always sort of had dreams of a startup,
[00:13:47] Jared: but they're not actually ever going to do it.
[00:13:49] Jared: The two risk averse.
[00:13:50] Jared: And so they can kind of live vicariously through
[00:13:52] Jared: an exciting startup with founders that they get along with.
[00:13:54] Jared: And if you find someone like that to be your champion,
[00:13:57] Jared: it's like they want you to succeed
[00:13:59] Jared: because they're going to feel like they're
[00:14:00] Jared: on the startup journey as well.
[00:14:02] Jared: I think so.
[00:14:03] Andy: I think it's finding more people like that
[00:14:04] Andy: that want to nurture that inner child
[00:14:06] Andy: that had this dream of startups, but they didn't get to do it.
[00:14:08] Andy: What's funny is this is a good example of when you meet,
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: especially young founders, often they try to like dress up.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_00: Like they'll just dress up in a suit
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: and they like copy Microsoft's homepage or something.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_00: And they shouldn't do that.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_00: Like they should just try to be a little bit more authentic.
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: Like it's actually fine to be a startup.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: Like it's important to come off as smart and with it,
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: but you do not need to copy the formalism of, you know,
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: sort of wearing a suit or the equivalent of that
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_00: in like your interactions with people.
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_00: Another good tactic is to find founders
[00:14:42] Jared: whose companies were acquired by big companies
[00:14:45] Jared: and get them to your champion.
[00:14:46] Jared: With Triple White, we sent you,
[00:14:48] Jared: we were able to work with Apple
[00:14:49] Jared: and there were like almost no recruiting companies
[00:14:52] Jared: working with Apple.
[00:14:53] Jared: And that was all because of a YC company queue
[00:14:56] Jared: started by Robbie Walker and Daniel Yose, actually,
[00:14:59] Jared: that would be required by Apple
[00:15:00] Jared: and then they helped us get in there.
[00:15:02] Jared: And then I actually remember we got like a pilot
[00:15:04] Jared: with Oracle through a founder who had sold his company
[00:15:07] Jared: to Oracle and was just pushing for them
[00:15:09] Jared: to hire better engineers and helped us through procurement
[00:15:12] Jared: and gave us all the internal politics
[00:15:14] Jared: and step-by-step playbook to get the pilot going.
[00:15:17] Jared: I think this is a special thing about being here
[00:15:19] Andy: in Silicon Valley is this pay-a-forward aspect
[00:15:22] Andy: that I think you cannot measure in a study.
[00:15:24] Andy: One of the other interesting things
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_03: from this paper that's also, I think, like,
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_03: a very optimistic point that got lost
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_03: in the like tweet version of this paper
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_03: is it like there's overwhelming demand
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_03: from enterprises to adopt AI
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_03: and they're way more willing to take bets on new startups.
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_03: So, you know, all these tricks are helpful,
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_03: but I do think it's probably much easier to sell
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_03: to a FAN company now, some AI agent
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_03: than it was back when you were running triple byte.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_03: But it sort of ties back into this original study,
[00:15:54] Jared: something we've talked about and maybe tweeted about
[00:15:56] Jared: is that I think the enterprises would certainly prefer
[00:15:59] Jared: to buy these solutions from established software companies,
[00:16:02] Jared: even established startups, like late-stage startups
[00:16:05] Jared: that have been around for a while
[00:16:06] Jared: and have lots of funding and feel less risky,
[00:16:08] Jared: but they fundamentally can't build the products.
[00:16:10] Jared: And I think many of the YC partners feel that a lot of the time
[00:16:14] Jared: it's just because the engineering teams at these orgs
[00:16:17] Jared: are filled with people that themselves don't actually
[00:16:19] Jared: really believe in AI, don't use code gen tools,
[00:16:22] Jared: don't think it's all super overhyped,
[00:16:24] Jared: are really excited when an MIT study comes out
[00:16:26] Jared: saying that it's all like hype and retweeted
[00:16:28] Jared: and really one because it's a narrative they want to believe.
[00:16:31] Jared: But the consequence of that for the companies
[00:16:33] Jared: is that they can't build the products.
[00:16:35] Jared: So if your engineers don't believe in this,
[00:16:36] Jared: then how are you going to build a product that actually works?
[00:16:39] Jared: Then not going to affect for startups,
[00:16:40] Jared: then as if you can actually build something that works,
[00:16:42] Jared: the enterprises will talk to you
[00:16:43] Jared: because they have no other options.
[00:16:44] Jared: Can't build it internally, can't go to an established company.
[00:16:47] Jared: So the startups are actually getting the shot
[00:16:49] Jared: that they never had before.
[00:16:50] Jared: I guarantee you, someone's watching this right now
[00:16:53] SPEAKER_00: and you've just horribly triggered them.
[00:16:56] Jared: Oh yeah, no, I tweet this and I got lots of angry emails.
[00:16:59] Jared: So I'm going to hang out there right now.
[00:17:02] Jared: I'm going, and the message for you guys out there,
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_00: the irony is all you have to do is literally just try it.
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_00: Like if you code and you're a great engineer
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_00: or even an okay engineer, honestly,
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_00: if you just try this stuff and get really good at it
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_00: and give it a shot, like it's not like I try it once
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_00: and it screwed up a variable name and now I'm mad
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_00: and I'll never use it again, right?
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_00: It's actually like invest into a real project.
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't have to be your main work.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_00: It could just be a side project.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_00: Do something super fun.
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_00: We literally had a vibe coding dad's night
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_00: about a month ago and people who are not even technical,
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_00: we had like a landlord who was making a vibe code thing
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_00: for their tenants so that they could like see
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: if they had paid the rent or something.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_00: It was like you will be amazed.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_00: And so the people who like feel this,
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_00: it's like just give it a shot because you are sort of
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_00: the perfect people in the world to use these tools
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_00: and even if, I mean honestly,
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_00: it turns 10X engineers into 100X engineers
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_00: and it turns 1X engineers into 10X engineers.
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_00: I mean, that's like such a gift
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_00: but it requires an overcoming of this very real emotion
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_00: that's inside of people.
[00:18:16] Yeah, the other instance over the last week
[00:18:18] Jared: where I've just seen this,
[00:18:19] Jared: sort of like the people waiting for the Ito the Hype.
[00:18:22] Jared: Narrative was after the Andre Kapathy,
[00:18:24] Jared: to our kitchen to you.
[00:18:25] Jared: Did you guys see that?
[00:18:26] Jared: Oh, yes, yes.
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I told you 10 years.
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I read the tweets.
[00:18:29] Jared: And the tweets are essentially,
[00:18:30] Jared: oh, like Kapathy says agents are overhyped
[00:18:33] Jared: and can't do the work.
[00:18:35] Jared: So then I listened to the interview
[00:18:36] Jared: and it's like the point he's making is,
[00:18:37] Jared: you can't just like give an agent a prompt
[00:18:39] Jared: and expect it to do everything perfectly the first time.
[00:18:42] Jared: Like you still actually have to do lots of work
[00:18:44] Jared: to provide the right data and do all the correct context
[00:18:46] Jared: and actually do the evals
[00:18:48] Jared: and all like the actual tooling.
[00:18:50] Jared: In my interpretation of that was,
[00:18:51] Jared: that's like a fantastic opportunity for startups
[00:18:53] Jared: and anyone who can build software.
[00:18:55] Jared: There's like tons of stuff that's still yet to build
[00:18:58] Jared: and I just found it like an interesting
[00:19:00] Jared: RawShark test almost of it.
[00:19:02] Jared: It's like if you fundamentally want to believe
[00:19:04] Jared: that everything is overhyped,
[00:19:05] Jared: you're going to read into that that,
[00:19:06] Jared: oh yeah, like look like AI expert confirms it's overhyped.
[00:19:09] Jared: But if you listen to actually what he's saying,
[00:19:11] Jared: there's like tons of opportunities
[00:19:13] Jared: you need to build really great tooling.
[00:19:14] Jared: It's like, the things are a tool
[00:19:16] Jared: and you just have to help them work better
[00:19:18] Jared: versus expect that they're all just going to be
[00:19:21] Jared: absolute magic and work without any help.
[00:19:23] Jared: Well, I think the exciting thing is basically,
[00:19:26] Andy: there's just a lot of opportunity to rebuild
[00:19:28] Andy: all these systems to be AI native
[00:19:30] Andy: because software needs to be completely rewritten
[00:19:34] Andy: to work with AI, which is really just
[00:19:37] lots of opportunities for founders, which is cool.
[00:19:40] Andy: Here's one other point from the study
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_03: that I also thought was really interesting
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_03: in terms of like why enterprise is such a big opportunity
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_03: for startups.
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_03: I'll actually read this quote.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_03: This is from some enterprise buyer person.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_03: We're currently evaluating five different Gen AI solutions.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_03: But once we've invested time in training a system,
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_03: the switching costs will become prohibitive.
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_03: That's the CIO of a $5 billion financial services firm.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_00: Fantastic, right?
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_00: That sounds like a moat to me.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_03: Exactly.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_03: I hadn't heard such a direct quote
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_03: from like a legit enterprise buyer about that before.
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_03: So all these people who are worried
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_03: that these ICHATGBT wrappers want to moat,
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_03: it's like that's the moat.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_00: So there you have it.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_00: The AI Doomer influencers have been leading you astray.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: AI is hard to actually implement.
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_00: And it turns out it's so hard to implement that only 5%
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_00: of the time it actually works.
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_00: But it also turns out that if you're a startup founder
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: and you're really good one at YC,
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_00: the acceptance rate is under 1% now.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_00: So we gave you a whole bunch of examples
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_00: of people who are in that 1% who then went on to be a part
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_00: of like probably that top 1% of implementations that actually
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_00: work because some of the smartest best product people
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_00: engineers are actually focused on it.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: Ultimately, it's about people who really, really great
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_00: at technology, but also are polymaths.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_00: They're, you know, understand other people,
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_00: can understand what that bank, you know, $5 billion
[00:21:11] SPEAKER_00: fintech CIO really, really wants.
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_00: That's the good news.
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: You should not look at these stats and say,
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: I could never be a part of that 5%.
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_00: If you're actually really, really good,
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_00: you absolutely can be and we have so many examples
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_00: of that at YC.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: So with that, we'll see you guys next time.
