[00:00:00] There is a point that you get to a year, maybe two years in, where from a rational standpoint,
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_04: you probably should quit.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_04: But for whatever reason, those successful ones don't.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_04: And so that is the number one filter in criteria.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_04: The best advice I can have is be clear in your own head about what you're trying to learn,
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_04: and then be open to where it comes from.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_04: And that's where I think people fuck that up a lot.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_04: They don't get really crystal clear on why they're trying to build
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_04: a startup or what they need to do to be successful.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_04: There is going to be a reinvention of analytics in the next few years.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_04: And we want to be the ones to go lead it.
[00:00:30] Welcome back to another episode of The Light Cone.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_02: Today we're really excited to be joined by Spencer Skates, CEO and co-founder of Amplitude.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_02: So Amplitude went through YC in winter 2012.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_02: Amplitude is one of the world's leading analytics platforms,
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_02: and they're used by some of the biggest companies in the world,
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_02: like Kursa, Dordash and Walmart.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_02: Thanks for joining us, Spencer.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_02: Absolutely. Good to see you here, Harch.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_02: So I was really excited to have you here, because both of us made people on the internet
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_02: angry recently, specifically on X or Twitter.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_02: I made the angry because I said that a lot of the reason
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_02: incumbent tech companies can't build AI products is that the engineers are kind of grumpy
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_02: and don't believe in AI and its capabilities, so they don't want to build the product.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_02: People got mad at you for that.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, people are really mad. Turns out that like there are actually a lot of grumpy engineers
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_02: that don't believe in AI.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_02: So I was curious to hear for you as a company that started well before the AI wave,
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_02: and is now trying to move into AI and building more AI products.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_02: How has that changed being for you and what are being some of the challenges you faced?
[00:01:40] It is hard as a larger company to reorient and rebuild your company to use AI well.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_04: And this is, I think, to your point, the huge advantage that a lot of earlier companies that can
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_04: build from the ground up in this way. I mean, I'll just tell you the amplitude story.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_04: So we were frankly skeptics on AI for a while too, so started to become relevant in 2022, 2023.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_04: There's a discussion, but we didn't really do that much.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_04: And it wasn't until late in 2024 that we're like, okay, we need to get serious because I think
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_04: this has the potential to reshape analytics and what we're doing.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_04: I think just to defend the skeptics for a second, I remember being in a board meeting once,
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_04: you had all these board investor finance people and you had all these sales people who were like,
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_04: hey guys, should you look at this AI thing? Is that getting hot?
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_04: Should you guys do it?
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_04: And it's like your AI strategy.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_04: Actually, that literally was a question from one of our execs to me.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_04: It's like, we got to get our AI strategy.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_04: What's our AI strategy Spencer?
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_04: This is the wrong way to think about what it is or doing.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_04: It's like, you guys think it is.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_04: You guys think you can figure it out.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_04: Go do it.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_04: And I remember one of my co-founders, Jeffrey,
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_04: actually was the most frustrated because I think he saw a lot of grifting happening in AI,
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_04: being like, oh, it's going to replace all these jobs.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_04: And like, it's going to do all these things.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_04: And we're not going to create this world of abundance.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_04: And it's just going to totally reshape how we're building products and shipping them.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_04: And how our customers are using them.
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_04: But the reality was, if you use any of these models at this point,
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_04: it's like, it was not clear at all.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_04: I think if you look at the capabilities of any of these models,
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_04: it's like, they're very, very jagged.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_04: So there's some things they're exceptional about.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_04: And there's some things that they're just absolutely terrible about.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_04: I think the frustrating part is to be told by someone who has no clue about,
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_04: you know, what stuff falls and what buckets.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_04: Like, oh, yeah, you should do more of this AI thing.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_04: It was very, very, very, very frustrating.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_04: And so I think there was, there's frankly skepticism in my part.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_04: There's skepticism in the part of my co-founders.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_04: And some of the broader team with an amplitude about what was actually going to be possible with it.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_04: But something changed.
[00:03:55] Yes. Well, I think you saw the transformative effect that AI had on software engineering.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_04: Like, no question if you were using, I mean,
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_04: started by cursor, but then, you know, all these other amazing tools,
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_04: cloud code, codex, like tons, you know, tons and tons of others.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_04: It was very clear that you would be a lot more productive using these things.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_04: And so that was kind of the first of us saying, okay, there's something there there.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_04: And let's go after this.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_04: So we really started on this path and earnest in around October of 2024.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_04: And kind of two things happened then.
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_04: One, I hired a new engineering leader, this guy Wade Chambers, who's just Silicon Valley legend.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_04: The other is we acquired this company, Command AI, also a YC company.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_04: In both their cases, they were kind of the chain ages that amplitude needed.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_04: So Wade had been working on AI in his previous company and had known a bunch of people who were
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_04: on the bleeding edge of leveraging the capabilities of models.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_04: They had been building a product where they were trying to, they're doing a bunch of different
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_04: things, but they were trying to smartly trigger guides to end users just based on if they were
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_04: confused. And they created this chatbot that very much like an Intercom Fin that would
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_04: interact with users and help them answer support questions and stuff like that.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_04: And they had been on leveraging a bunch of model capabilities.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_04: That was kind of the first point that we started to get serious about it.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_04: And then since then, it has been a very, I'd like to think we're kind of coming up.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_04: And we just launched a whole bunch of AI products in the last few weeks.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_04: We did AI feedback, we did AI visibility, we did our MCP server.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_04: And then we're going to go much, much bigger in December, January and February,
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_04: where we are going to be coming out with what we call the cursor for analytics,
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_04: which I'm incredibly excited about.
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_04: And I think we'll dramatically change how people use and leverage analytics. But it's taken
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_04: to transform amplitude as an organization. I like to think we're still small. We're about 800
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_04: people, product engineering and design. That organization is about 200 people. So it's like
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_04: you can know most people in it and change pretty quickly. It's still taking us a full year
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_04: to get the team fully on board and ramped and believing and seeing and building.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_04: Chat GBT launches, AI starts taking off and sounds like you're investors and board members and
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_02: maybe people who aren't in the day-to-day are sort of like, hey, what are you doing with this AI thing?
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_02: What about it in tech renters?
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_02: Exactly. What about internally? What was the vibe internally at amplitude on the team?
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_02: Was there anyone internally asking, hey, should we be building AI products or doing something with AI?
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_02: There were a few people that were kind of testing out ideas.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_04: But I think we're so focused on our regular motion. We were coming out with a lot of other
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_04: products outside of analytics. We were doing, we launched experimentation, we were building
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_04: session replay internally, we were building this thing activation, which targets your users
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_04: based on their behavior. There was a lot to do. That was just right in front of us.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_04: That was clear, hey, we can be much more competitive with,
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_04: and there's this revenue that's just sitting here if we go build these things.
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_04: There are a few folks that were messing around with it, and there were some people that had
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_04: used cursor and other things. But the organization as a whole did not have, it's not like it was
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_04: conscious and aware of this change. This massive change that was about to happen.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_04: I give a lot of credit to Wade, and I give a lot of credit to the command team of being the
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_04: tip of the spear in terms of showing people what is possible and then getting the organization
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_04: to embrace. By early 2025, I was convinced, and I was like, all right, we have to be very aggressive
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_04: on this. So the first order is to train the organization of what the capabilities of AI are.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_04: Specifically engineering. What was like the light bulb moment for you when did you flick into
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_02: and Disney's be my priority? It's hard to say that there was one moment. We've always had
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_04: this vision at amplitude of a self-improving product where you have a product that dynamically
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_04: responds to your user feedback. So it knows what features you like. It knows when you're getting
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_04: frustrated and stuck. It knows how to change things based on your input as a user.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_04: And I had always thought this vision was like 10 years out if even that close.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_04: And one of the things that was becoming clear, it was actually a lot closer.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_04: That moment was actually probably a lot closer than we had realized because of what we saw
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_04: happening on the coding side with AI. I said, okay, look, whether or not a self-improving product
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_04: is going to be possible, it's clear at least a step towards it. We're going to have to go do it.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_04: And the way to do this is we're going to have to train the organization on this. I started working
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_04: with James, the founder, CEO of Command, as well as Wade, our engineering leader to
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_04: figure out how do we train the organization on AI. And we came up with an AI week. And unfortunately,
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_04: for a bunch of reasons, we weren't able to actually do that until June. But that was a key pivot point.
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_04: What we did was we got a bunch of the existing leaders in the organization. So our VP's
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_04: of product, our engineering managers, to use this technology and to see what was possible about
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_04: it. And then during that AI week, what we do is we train the team. We had one of our product leaders,
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_04: vibe code, like a dark mode for amplitude in front of the entire organization, which was actually
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_04: very scary. But actually, it happened to, they write a new bug, but then happened to sort it out.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_04: It was actually kind of a cool moment because the entire engineering product and design organization
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_04: saw what was, it's like, wow, okay, all the leaders with an amplitude are saying, this is the
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_04: thing and they're showing how they're doing it. And I better get with this as well. And then the
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_04: rest of the week, so we did training for about two days. And then the rest of week was just,
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_04: like a hackathon of work on stuff, you're already doing, except do it faster and better
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_04: by getting set up with cursor as well as a bunch of these other pieces of tooling.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_04: So step one is, but it was actually not by case what we need to build at amplitude with AI.
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_02: Step one is just get the existing team using tools and support and believing in them.
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_04: This is the core difference between building product and SaaS and building product with AI.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_04: In SaaS, I mean, it's the best business model and the best product delivery system of all time.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_04: You go to your customers, you ask them what they want and what they're going to pay for.
[00:10:36] You prioritize that list and you start building it, you get them to those customers and then
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_04: you do the whole thing over and over again. That's the delivery loop that amplitude has mastered
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_04: over the last decade. And you know, that's our core competitive advantage, you know, as an
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_04: analytics company is we're better at that than anyone else. The key is you can go to your customers
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_04: and they can tell you what they want. With the capabilities of AI, because they're so jagged,
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_04: you it's a technology first understanding of what is possible. And so if you go to your customers
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_04: and tell them and ask them what they want, like they're not even going to be able to describe what's
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_04: possible. You give me a faster horse. Yeah, give me a faster horse. You know, or it'll be asking for
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_04: something that's not quite possible or possible in the wrong way or like, hey, you know, I want
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_04: something that ships insights to me and you know, does it in this particular way and you'll get
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_04: all sorts of different visions of it. And what's much more important is you have to be familiar with
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_04: the capabilities of the models and then how those can map back into what your product does.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_04: The thing that I just find really surprising about this is usually the way it works with new
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_02: technologies is like the engineers of the early adopters and they are usually like bugging their
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_02: like company. I really want to use like this tool where like, and it's like the companies are
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_02: resisting saying it's not like tested yet. It's not safe. But like, it seems to be a more common
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_02: pattern with AI that is like going the other way. Yeah, it stops down. Yeah, like, why do you think
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_02: that's happening? I mean, it's going to sound extraordinarily reductive. But I think, I think
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_04: Sam Altman is the best salesperson of this generation by no bar none. Like, I think he has done
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_04: an exceptional job stating a very ambitious vision, getting a lot of people rally behind it at
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_04: open AI showing what's possible and convincing, you know, the entire world of the impact that
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_04: this technology is going to have. And so you have these, you know, exact investors already bought
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_04: in executives are bought in, you know, world leaders are bought in like, you know, as a society,
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_04: you know, the people in power have said, hey, this technology matters. And the reality is the
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_04: capabilities are still trying to catch up. And it's not clear if they'll catch up to those
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_04: aspirations. And so you have to your point, hard, the opposite disconnect happening where,
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_04: you know, yeah, you have a lot of desire for this thing to happen. But, you know, it's not clear if
[00:12:52] the capabilities are there yet. And so this is why, you know, you had a lot of frustration, you know,
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_04: in amplitude as a case study, a lot of frustration from engineers being like, man, I see just
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_04: touch tremendous what they feel is grifting in AI where it's a lot of talkers. Not many doers.
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_04: You know, it's not till the last year that, you know, okay, hey, we think the capabilities are
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_04: here for it to transform the business that we're in an analytics. One thing that comes to mind is
[00:13:20] this mode of running the company more like founder mode is even more present.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_00: Yes. And there's a story of the transformation with case tags where we've just founder led to do
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: that transformation. Sounds like this is what's going on with the amplitude too is coming from
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: from you. Absolutely. So I've had to learn over the last 10 years how to be go from being a founder
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_04: to being a large company executive. There is no way to understand what is possible than being using
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_04: the technology and being on the front lines of it. And so, you know, that's why it's like, yeah,
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_04: you train the entire organization and it's a much more bottoms up thing on what is possible. And so
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_04: out of that AI week came basically all the AI stuff that we're working on now. So our MCP
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_04: server, which we didn't even plan for, like that was actually one of our engineers Brian Geori,
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_04: who's incredibly excited. You had one of our engineers, this guy named Leo Chang, who built AI
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_04: visibility and he just wanted to he was actually going to leave amplitude to start a company. And
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_04: we're like, look, just come here, stay here, learn how to do this while getting paid and we'll
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_04: will teach and coach you and then, you know, we'll fund whenever you do go something. And I didn't
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_04: want him to do AI visibility, but he was like, oh, I think that there's a huge opportunity here
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_04: to like build something for free and give it away. And, you know, now that's now like, you know,
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_04: it's been this explosion. Like we have that launch product launch doubled new signups to amplitude,
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_04: which is wild. You know, like every week, it's like we're getting twice as many signups to our
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_04: free plan as we did from before our AI visibility launch all the way to what we're going to be launching
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_04: in January, which is we're going to launch a what we're going to call ask AI, which is a global
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_04: chat interface very much like cursor, where you will be able to chat with, yeah, chat with AI
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_04: and ask it to pull certain charts for you or do analysis or figure out why something has happened
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_04: to you for within within, you know, your data and pull that back out to you to our agents to like
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_04: so many different things have come out of this from, but it's all been very bottom-zop and then
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_04: it's about, you know, for me and for Wade to sculpt, okay, how do we set these up in the
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_04: organization for success? So, not many large companies like yourself have been able to do this
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_00: transformation a lot of them are still stuck and it's been probably very painful to overcome.
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_00: What are things that you have to give up to get to where you are right now?
[00:15:46] I mean, we've done two reorganizations in the engineering product and design organization
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_04: since the since the start of this year. And so, you know, there were leaders and executives and
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_04: different people who were very much kind of in the sass modality, but were not on the bleeding edge
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_04: of AI that just unfortunately were not quite the right fit for what we were trying to build in the
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_04: future and so ended up having to move folks out of the business. I mean, doing that level of
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_04: reorganization, you know, twice in a year is very disruptive. We've also acquired other companies,
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_04: so we brought in the craftful team and Yana who's been phenomenal and we brought in Eric and
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_04: Frank from Inari. We brought in also YC company, we brought in Enzo and Frucio from June.
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_04: Also, I think YC company, yeah, so we brought in all these great YC founders and then kind of
[00:16:38] SPEAKER_04: meld with them with a lot of long time amplitires and that combination has been very, very special.
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_04: What are the specific differences? For people who are really successful, I think especially
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_02: engineers, like who are successful in pre-AI, sass world, gang grew up in that environment and then
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_02: you compare, like what are sort of the things that they're lacking is the right word, but what are
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_02: the things that they can't see or they're not as naturally adept at as people who came up in
[00:17:05] post AI world and are like AI native engineers and believe in it deeply. To say the more uncomfortable
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_01: thing, like is it an age gap? It's not an age thing per se. It's a mentality thing. Like in the sass
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_04: world, you can do that loop I talked about earlier. Talk to customers, ask them what they want,
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_04: prioritize that list, build it, deliver it, do it again. Like you kind of, I don't know, it feels
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_04: very cliche to say, but you want to take kind of the state of the art and whatever field you're
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_04: building for and then start to say, okay, if I were to redo this in an AI native way, why?
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_04: On the flip side, I think what a lot of these AI native teams are really missing is they haven't
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_04: learned the product and the problem and why things are solved the way they're solved. And so like,
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_04: they try to create these new interfaces from scratch without drawing on the previous expertise
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_04: that's happened over the last decade on whatever problem that they're solving. And so if you try to
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_04: build an analytics interface from the ground up where you're just, say, starting with questions
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_04: and you're not seeing your data, that's actually has its own set of challenges. And so I think
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_04: you know what I'll say with the amplitude team is like, there's some incredible engineers there.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_04: I think the ones that have adapted the best have always been very in tune with, okay,
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_04: the code is not an end in itself. It just like shipping it, that's just a side effect of
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_04: solving whatever problem for the customer. And then hey, now I need to get up to speed with this
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_04: new technology. And if I can marry those two things, then I'm going to create something amazing.
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_04: I guess one of the weird things that I've noticed in my own behavior is we have an internal agent
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_01: in for at YC and it has access to all our databases and everything like that. And then Jared
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_01: recently told me I'm like sort of a super user for it. And then what I realize is I don't,
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_01: basically it actually fails most of the time still. But I just like try and ask it in a different
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_01: way. I tried, you know, if it failed with Gemini 3, then I'll try it with, you know, Claude, I'll try
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_01: it with GP 5.1, like I'll change the reasoning levels, like, and then eventually I figured out.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, and it works. So whereas like in B2B SaaS and door building, you know, sort of
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_01: standard Web 2.0 software, it's like, man, if it broke even once, like this thing, it's piece of crap
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_01: and I'll never use it again. So it's like a weird, yeah, you have to like read why are your brain to be,
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: it's like working with a child right now. This is why I think a lot of the hype in that AI
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_04: killing SaaS is way overblown because particularly for a lot of business workflows, like very high
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_04: guarantees on performance are fundamental to it. You know, if you put a record into your CRM,
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_04: that stuff better be there. You know, you don't want it. Oh, well, it put this in with 80%
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_04: probability. It's like you want it to be there. And SaaS does a great job. But that actually took a
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_04: set of existing workflows that were handled on prem or by paper and just moving the cloud. And so
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_04: it wasn't really like it wasn't any workflow transformation. And this is where I think
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_04: Andre Carpati's point is totally right where a lot of these businesses are trying to overshoot
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_04: the mark and just say, okay, well, hey, we'll just have this agent handle this workflow end-to-end.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_04: Actually, the editing and redoing it like you like you talk about Gary is actually incredibly
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_04: important. And so how do you create a product that allows you to do that really well? I think is the
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_04: key challenge that a lot of AIB2B companies are figuring out. Speaking of things that you have to
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_03: give up in order to do this, what happened to the existing amplitude roadmap? You had all these
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_03: other things that you were working on before the company got AI for ever. Did you throw up the whole
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_03: roadmap? Oh, like half of it. How are you thinking about like allocating resources between these
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_03: new AIBets and the like existing stuff that makes the money? It's not like there's totally
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_03: separate products like the goal of, for example, our what we're calling ask AI, which is the
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_04: chatter interface and amplitude is to make it easier to use the existing product. And so,
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_04: as we've looked at next year, there are four big priorities we have. One is rebuild amplitude to
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_04: B.A.I. native. The second is make it much easier to use. The third is make sure our other products
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_04: outside of analytics have parity with the competition. And the fourth is serve marketers really well so
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_04: that we can take on a bunch of the legacy martec guys. There's still like basics that we're doing
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_04: or foundational things we're doing on our session replay product, on our experimentation products,
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_04: on our guides and surveys product. Like, you know, for example, one big thing that we're going to be
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_04: coming out with in session replay in the next few months is zoning, which is this way where you can
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_04: look at a web page and then see the analytics overlayed on top of it, which is super cool functionality.
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_04: And so that we're still doing in the same way. I think what getting the team to embrace AI from
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_04: from the ground up has happened has allowed us to do is one, you know, they're a lot faster and
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_04: more productive. So they're shipping a lot more, which is absolutely amazing. And then two,
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_04: they are looking at these problems with this lens. And so the big change we did organizationally
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_04: is we had a lot of these AI projects as kind of side projects for a bunch of people and we said,
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_04: okay, let's have a dedicated team that kind of goes after them. But the existing team is still going
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_04: to do work on making the amplitude product great and that work is just as important. Because I
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_04: think the timeline for change in the business world is the cycles are just much, much, much longer.
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_04: And how do you allocate people between the teams working on the new AI stuff and the more
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_03: traditional SaaS stuff? Did they self-select into different groups? Is there like a challenge
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_03: and cultural divide there that you have to navigate? No, you know, I think by doing the AI
[00:22:43] we can make it clear. We had this whole metaphor we talked about burning the boats like we're all
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_04: in on this. And there are some people that got even more into it and they very naturally self-selected
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_04: into a bunch of a bunch of this work like we and it's crazy. It's like it's not just, hey,
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_04: engineers, it's like designers too are very best designer at amplitude. This guy named Bull Newton.
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_04: We actually had him spread among way too many projects and he was like, no, I got to focus in like,
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_04: let's say, noted some of these for a little bit so I can go really deep on this chat interface
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_04: and make sure that when we launch this thing and everything next year it's going to be awesome.
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_04: So yeah, people will naturally kind of self-select and or out and it's a 200 person or so you
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_04: get a whole spectrum of this. Can we talk about the thing that you said that made people angry on
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_04: the internet? Yeah, which one? I think it was the AI visibility treat, right? I think
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_02: generally I think you were making the point that a lot of these startups are sort of like features
[00:23:47] SPEAKER_02: not companies and obviously like at YC we're going to take the other side of it. I know.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_02: I know where to argue that. You guys have a visibility company that feels like every batch.
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's a point. It's become a popular idea. We find founders not ideas. I love it.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_02: But AI visibility aside, you've gone through the whole journey. You were in the batch, you started
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_02: a company, now you're running a public company. I think we would argue the side of just that
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_02: the start, the advantages the startups have in general is just like they don't have an existing
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_02: customer base and have revenue. Their customers are going to be more forgiving if the thing doesn't
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_02: work yet and these have seemed like advantages for new startups attacking incumbent companies with
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_02: like an AI product. But from your perspective, what are the advantages that incumbent companies have
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_02: over the, how do you think about it? I think the real business has to be downstream of AI visibility.
[00:24:38] It's a valuable, there's value in it. Just like there's value in the SEO world. But it's so easy
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_04: to do. We did it, as I mentioned, in probably more like a few months and a few weeks, but we
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_04: did it very quickly and gave it away for free and it's been this incredible lead generation for us.
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_04: So the commoditization is going to happen real, real fast. You talk about people talk about
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_04: hey, sass going away because of AI, I think that's a great example of it.
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_04: And so in contrast, if you look at I think businesses that have done very well here,
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_04: there is a business that is very viable here, which is what AirOps is doing, where they're,
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_04: yes, they have some visibility aspects, but they have a whole content generation business to help
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_04: you create blog posts and other material on that. And that's their real business. And so I think
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_04: all of these visibility businesses, you can get it for free from us. You can get it, you know,
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_04: you're going to be able to get it free from a lot of other places and you're going to have to
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_04: construct a real business kind of downstream. And maybe to give the flip side of it, like,
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_04: I think innovation in the space is great. It's already moved a lot in the last few months.
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_04: One of the advantages we have is because we have an existing revenue base of hundreds of millions,
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_04: we can give away this for free. And that's great because now a lot more people can get visibility
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_04: without having to go through all the hoops of paying a company and get tons of
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_04: tons and tons of value out of it. You have expensive founder, like Ryola College,
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_02: starting company, now you're like public company CEO. So you have all this knowledge from seeing
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_02: what things look like at scale. Let's say you went out and started another company again,
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_02: and you were looking at markets to go into and you were thinking about where a market to where
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_02: you would imagine, this incumbent is actually really good. We should just stay away and AI is not
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_02: going to give us an advantage. And which are ones where you'd be like, oh yeah, that's totally
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_02: vulnerable and we could really compete with them. I mean, honestly, I joke about this, but
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_04: anything Google is trying to do, I think that Google is the worst B2B company of all time.
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_04: And there's an incredible opportunity to compete with them. So I'd look at email, I'd look at
[00:26:56] SPEAKER_04: the workspace stuff. I think what the notion guys, for example, are doing as a competitor to Google
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_04: Docs is very exciting. Institutionally, Google's way too slow and way too conservative
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_04: that to be able to do this. And so it's only when other companies start to innovate that they
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_04: get their stuff together, you know, same on that coding thing. They proven it can work from a
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_04: technology standpoint, but bringing it to market, selling it to customers, making it work from
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_04: product standpoint, I think is very ripe for disruption. Honestly, so we've seen it in coding,
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_04: we're starting to see in support, we're seeing, you know, we think there's a massive opportunity
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_04: in analytics that we're uniquely positioned for. I think, you know, there's going to be a cursor
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_04: moment in analytics in the next two years. No question in my mind where people are going to use
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_04: analytics with AI and you're going to be like, why did we ever do it the old way? And I can't
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_04: even imagine going back. I think there's a lot of very generalized agent builders. And I think
[00:27:49] SPEAKER_04: picking a particular problem in a particular buyer is going to be a much more successful way
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_04: of building a business. You know, yeah, there's a general, you know, there's probably multiple
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_04: generalized agent builders every YC batch now too. And so having a strong point of view for a
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_04: particular buyer that cares about some things, like one of the ones I saw recently was like, I think
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_04: you know, there's all these studies being like, hey, enterprise is failing to adopt AI. And if you
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_04: look at, you kind of dig into the Y behind it, there's all these security and compliance concerns.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_04: And so, okay, I think there's a huge opportunity to solve those to get much faster adoption of
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_04: these products. There has to be a Uber for tech support. When I was in high school, I ran my own
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_04: IT support business just helping people around the neighborhood fix their computers because it's like
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_04: set my Wi-Fi network up to my printer, you know, whatever. And the fact there's still not a scaled
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_04: solution, it just blows my mind for this. Like you have a lot of people that, you know, are older,
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_04: that are not native to technology that have a bunch of money and want this stuff to be set up.
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_04: And you have this young generation that desperately needs money that has a ton of expertise on
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_04: technology. And so a business that matches those that's kind of supply and demand. I mean, we also
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_02: spend a lot of time helping people figure out the idea actually and of like, it's really hard.
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_04: This is extraordinary. I don't think everyone realizes how Amplitude started out. Can you maybe talk
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_02: about Yoljani to actually finding the Amplitude idea and maybe reflections on it a decade later?
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_02: So before Amplitude, we started this company called Sonal Light, which was a voice recognition.
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_04: I was like an early version of Siri. And it had this really amazing demo actually where you could
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_04: it listened in the background for your voice. And this was before any of the hey Siri, hey Alexa stuff.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_04: And so it like listened in the background on Android phone. And as far as we could tell,
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_04: we're the first to come out with the technology. We didn't know anything about what made for a
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_04: successful product or business or company. And we were just kind of taking our shot on that.
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_04: We were just two kids at a college that were like, okay, what's the problem that seems
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_04: barely at the edge of possible? That's probably an interesting place for us to go to.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_04: You know, and we ended up choosing voice recognition not because we were passionate about the space.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_04: So we did why see with that. We did went through the whole batch, did demo day, did this amazing
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_04: demo on stage. We got tons of press written about us. But the product and the tech, it was just not
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_04: good enough. It wasn't a good enough product. And so we ended up right after a demo day,
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_04: deciding to shut that down. And then we had always built our own analytics and house.
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_04: You know, it's like, so what you do as an engineering? You're always like, I want to build this
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_04: instead of paying amplitude money because it was very clear to us, this was the right way to build
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_04: product. It was you could look at what people did in your product. You would understand them deeply
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_04: and you could build an iterate on a better product. And so we ended up, and when we showed what we
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_04: had done in the analytics side to a lot of other companies that are like, hey, we want this. And so
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_04: that right after YC winner 2012 demo day, we ended up pivoting to amplitude. And that was, I think,
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_04: that was June of 2012. And it was a pretty crowded space. Oh, that's what narrowly crowded.
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_02: But what did that factor into you thinking about getting into it a little bit? You know, and so
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_04: you have to ask yourself, it's like, okay, why do you think you're different? We knew this was
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_04: a particularly good problem for us. Compared to voice recognition, you know, and a lot of this AI
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_04: stuff, frankly, that was, those were probabilistic problems. So you could not get a right answer.
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_04: And we were a bunch of algorithms engineers coming out of MIT. And so this problem of how do you
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_04: analytics? It seems amazing because it's like, okay, you build this really scaled distributed system
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_04: and you can get a right answer. And it's just about doing it better and faster. That sounds great
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_04: and amazing. On comparison to voice recognition, I think in retrospect, you know, we got lucky that
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_04: we were particularly suited for that problem. And then the other part of the other point of
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_04: you, I think I had was that I'd see all these great engineers and these great founders who
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_04: built these amazing pieces of technology, but just did not really understand how to get it in
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_04: the hands of customers and sell it and all that. So I'm like, okay, I'm going to go fall. I'm going to
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_04: go all in learning how to do that. I don't even think I do that particularly well. But just because we
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_04: were willing to do that and kind of build the next thing and build the next thing and build the next
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_04: thing, you know, you compound that 10 years later and now you're the leader in the space.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_04: Do you have like a method for learning these things? Like one of the things I remember was once you
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: went to amplitude, then it was, you know, B2B sales and then you got really good at it. But you didn't
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_01: know anything about it. I'm not good at B2B sales to be clear. I still feel an imposter to this day.
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_01: But being able to do it at all, like from an engineering background, I mean, and being willing to
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_01: learn how to do it and realizing like, oh, this is actually my go-to-market and I have to do it this way.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Analyze. I think in particular, there are some products that you can adopt without selling
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_04: and that like people just, you know, they have single player mode, you know, cursors, great examples,
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_04: slacks a great example. But there's some where you need to convince multiple people at the same time
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_04: that you're going to go do it and that requires a sales motion. The number one misconception I had
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_04: was like, this would be something you learn out of a book or on a website or, you know, you kind of
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_04: read about, but one, you have to do it and it's like two, you just want to get someone who's good at
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_04: coaching you. So we work with this guy, Mitch Morando, who coached, you know, as a sales exec,
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_04: who had gone on to coach a bunch of other companies. And I just happened to randomly
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_04: meet him through the sensor tower guys actually. And I was like, okay, this is the expert I need,
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_04: you know, teach me everything you know about sales. He's like, whoa, whoa, slow down. And then he would
[00:33:28] just come in once a week and just beat me up and just being like, hey, you don't really, you know,
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_04: what's the customer pain? And I'm like, oh, they want some dashboards of charts. Like Spencer, it's not a
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_04: business pain. Like, what's the pain? And so after a while, like, finally get the message.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_04: It's very much like learning a sport or the play an instrument in a lot of ways. You're not going
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_04: to do it reading a book. You want to just do it and then get a little bit of advice and coaching
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_04: on the side. Like that's the that's the much, much better approach. I mean, you said the several
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_01: times, even in this hour that, you know, you find certain people who are really, really great. If you
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_01: could, you know, give your, the 20 year old version of yourself, like the cheat sheet on what you
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_01: learned about finding those mentors. Like, are there, you know, is there, is it like, I know it when
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_01: I see it or, you know, there's a track record or, it's so hard. I mean, I've been extraordinarily
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_04: lucky. And this is one of the great parts of Silicon Valley is there's such a positive sum help
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_04: others pay afford mentality. I mean, Mitch was an amazing, why season, amazing one, you know,
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_04: is very clear. I mean, the best advice I can have is be clear in your own head about what you're
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_04: trying to learn and then, you know, be open to where it comes from. So you first need to be clear
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_04: on what you're trying to do. And that's what I think people fuck that up a lot. They don't get
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_04: really crystal clear on why they're trying to build a startup or what they need to do to be
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_04: successful. And then from there, you know, how you get the, how you get the mentorship or advice
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_04: may come from a lot of different directions. Can I ask like one more kind of meta question?
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_01: Hearing you speak about your experience at Amplitude, it's just really inspiring me because like,
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_01: you go all the way into the details, you have this capability, like hyper focus. And then,
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_01: I guess like, how do you direct it? Like, how do you know that you're hyper focusing on the thing
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_01: that, you know, really is the number one thing? Like, do you have like a cycle in the back where you're
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_01: like, I'll just, you know, spend 10 minutes thinking about blah, but like, is that actually the
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_01: most important thing or not? Like, how do you, you know, prevent just like, rat-hoaling on something?
[00:35:25] It's hard. One of the things I did before starting a company was getting real clear in my head
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_04: as to what I wanted to do with my career and why. And one of the takeaways I had was,
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_04: you know, you want to dedicate yourself to a mission that's greater than yourself.
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_04: And you'd be part of contributing something larger to humility. And what I knew how to do was to,
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_04: build software and sell it. And so I'll come like, okay, what's the best way I can do that,
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_04: you know, starting a company. And then from there, it's just, you know, you kind of, the goal,
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_04: you know, you create a goal tree that goes down from there. Okay, let's figure out what product to
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_04: build. Let's figure out how to sell that product, you know, and then it just kind of falls into place.
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_04: I find that where people get screwed up the most on that is they are not clear. And by the way,
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_04: speaking of starting a company, it's extraordinarily emotionally painful. Like, I do not recommend it
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_04: for the vast majority of people. I mean, there's so many times like every few years I've gotten
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_04: to a spot where I feel like I want to quit the business and you feel that deeply. And the best
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_04: counter to that is I kind of go back to the why, why I kind of came into this business. And so I think,
[00:36:38] if you get that top node really right, you can always kind of hanker or go back to that. You always
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_04: know, okay, look, if I just continue to see this through somehow, I don't know necessarily how it'll
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_04: lead back to, hey, I'm going to create a, you know, build technology and make the world a better place
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_04: in my own little way. So I just, I, that would be my number one advice for, you know, anyone that's
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_04: coming out of school or thinking of starting a company is getting really clear on that. I think
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_04: the worst, I see them. You guys see it all the time, which is like, hey, you know, I'll do it. And if
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_04: it takes off, I'll double down. If not, I'll go back to grad school or a job or whatever. And that's
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_04: like the freaking worst of this because you have to put up with uncertainty for a long period of
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_04: time. You have to have all these existential questions hanging over your head. It's, it's, um,
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_04: you're not going to get through it. Like if you look, one of the big takeaways, like I read founders
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_04: at work. Um, and one of the really clear takeaways from any of these journeys is there is a point
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_04: that you get to a year, maybe two years in where from a rational standpoint, you probably should quit.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_04: But for whatever reason, um, those successful ones don't. And so that is the number one filter
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_04: in criteria. Now, not to say, you know, that, you know, there's no guarantees. Getting that,
[00:37:47] SPEAKER_04: that top node really clear so that you can anchor on it over very long periods of time is the most
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_04: important I found intrinsic motivation. Yeah. If you're, if you're doing it for like recognition from
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_04: others or, or, you know, hey, you know, because you're going to get paid a lot or whatever else, you'll,
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_04: your, your ability to last through is going to be much, much worse than someone else's. I mean,
[00:38:08] SPEAKER_04: embedded in that, you know, I'm taken by earlier, you're saying like at every point of amplitude,
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_01: there's sort of a moment where you have to learn how to do something and like grow into that.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_01: And then being a public company CEO is one of those things. Walk me through like the, you know,
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_01: how you started like the, you know, the intrinsic motivation. And now it's like, it feels like you
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_01: have a really big responsibility on your back. It's like, you know, people looked you for leadership.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, you were the leader of a great many people and they have families and
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_01: totally, oh yeah. I mean, they're betting their careers on what we're doing here. It's, it's,
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_04: it's a, it's a, it's a very deep responsibility. As a founder, your job is always to run to the
[00:38:48] SPEAKER_04: most difficult problem in the business and lead from the front. And so if there's an incredibly
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_04: difficult piece of code, a difficult product or design problem, a difficult customer, you know,
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_04: a difficult employee problem, whatever, you need to go, the great founders will go headfirst
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_04: into it and lead from the front. And they will rally the rest of the team behind them.
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_04: Even if you look at the successful founder CEOs, after about a decade, most of them leave. And in my
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_04: mind, it's actually for this very reason is could be because being a large company executive is
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_04: different. And because you, you, you can't lead by example everywhere all the time. There are
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_04: places you can't, but you can't do it universally because it's like, okay, you got to do in sales,
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_04: you got to do a marketing, you got to do in people, you got to do it on the product, you got to
[00:39:31] SPEAKER_04: do it with customers, you got to do it with the press. And it's like the list goes on. There's
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_04: just too much. You have to be much more disciplined about your time and say no to most stuff. And then
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_04: what you realize is you become the person you hate. You'd always make fun of big company executives
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_04: for not doing any work for themselves and just like judging other people's work all the time.
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_04: But there's a reason for that. And you have to embrace that reason. And so it's, it's very hard.
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_04: That is a very hard thing to unlearn. Another thing which still trips me up to this day and I hate.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_04: And I try to run amplitude differently, but there's truth to it is like hierarchy. There is a
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_04: reason for higher. Oh, yeah. That's like the hard way many, many needs to have people who own certain
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_04: things and who are responsible for leading certain teams and other people within the business. It's
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_04: much easier in my mind, I think, to be a large company executive because you have all these
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_04: resources and you have all this leverage. Well, you actually work less hard in the product market.
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_04: You're like, it's deploying like, you know, we're 350 million revenue and, you know, we're deploying
[00:40:31] close to that in terms of total spend every year. So you have a lot of resources to do stuff.
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_04: Now you're learning about how do you actually deploy those resources effectively. So, so there's
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_04: levers that you have as a large company executive that you don't as a founder, which is awesome. And,
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_04: you know, it, but it's a different, very different tool set and a very different set of skills in order
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_04: to build a business successfully. And that's been the hardest transition by far.
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_04: I think this will be really interesting next couple of years then because like sort of this
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_01: flies a little bit in the face of the most facile view of what founder mode is. Like the most
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_01: facile view is like you have to be all the way in the weeds 100% of the time, which is like
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_01: obviously not possible when you have 800 employees. Well, you can't do it everywhere. You have to be
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_04: clear on where you're doing it. Yeah. So there's just like a lot more nuance to you. Yeah, I mean,
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_01: you know, it's one of these like, you know, there's like a million management books about this thing.
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_04: And, you know, they kind of all try to abstract it into some framework and it's none of them are
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_04: really right. You go through it and experiencing yourself and get coaching from others who do. And
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_04: that's how you end up figuring it out. But that transition to large company executive, that one's
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_04: a really hard one. Well, in the immortal words of Bob Marley, one good thing about product market fit
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_01: is when it hits you feel no pain. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Gross solve some problems. And then,
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_01: hopefully people watching this will actually get a chance to experience some of the problems that
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_01: you get to live on a daily basis. Absolutely. Absolutely. One of the things I'm actually very
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_04: appreciative, Gary, that you and PG and Jessica and others are doing is just helping people tell
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_04: these later stage stories. One of the things I think YC's done exceptionally well is like,
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_04: you know, to the extent you can have a playbook for what is like the early stage stages, you guys
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_04: have written and talked about it and made everyone out there aware of it. So they know what the path
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_04: is and what it looks like. It's still incredibly hard. But now it's like, okay, you at least has
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_04: some guidance. It doesn't exist for a lot of the later stage stuff as you grow up. So I'm very appreciative
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_04: that you guys are building that. There's levels to it. But thank you for sharing your levels.
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_01: Of course. Do you feel like we could turn what you did with the amplitude into the playbook for
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_03: House Ass Company should reinvent themselves in the AI era? You know, I still feel like an
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_03: imposter on this thing to this day. But I'm very happy to contribute. You have to get very
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_04: judicious with your time. There are a lot of people who want your time. You know, and you could
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_04: spend infinite time within people in the organization with customers, with partners, with investors,
[00:42:50] SPEAKER_04: whoever. And so you have to think about like, you're like, no one owns your time. But you,
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_04: as a founder, you're just like, nobody cares. And so you're just desperate for anyone to give you
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_04: attention. So if they do, you're like, okay, this is great. But as you know, large company, it's like,
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_04: no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you have to be very, very judicious. One of the things I am deliberately
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_04: trying to do is just be more out there and vocal. So you see it on Twitter, you see it, you know,
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_04: I'm just trying to be unfilled. There's still, you know, there's still an aperture you're constrained
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_04: to as a public company CEO. But most are just so conservative. They're not putting anything out there.
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_04: And so, you know, I'm at least trying to kind of share my story, put it out there, put my hot takes
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_04: on, you know, politics, politics, religion, whatever, you know, products, companies out there. So
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_04: at least at least others, you know, can can learn and benefit from that too. And honestly,
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_04: it's like, it's just who I am, you know, ultimately, I want to be able to express who I am. I don't
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_04: want to hurt you with people on the internet. I don't want to have to be this other persona that
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_04: that I'm not, you know, or try to represent something I'm not, you know, if I believe in
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_04: I have conviction in something, I want to be able to say it. Spencer, thank you so much for spending
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_01: time with us. This is super illuminating and can't wait to see amplitude AI, the new
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_01: resurgence coming in to every company in the world. There is going to be a reinvention of
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_04: analytics in the next few years. And, you know, we want to be the ones to go lead it. So thank
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_04: you guys. You heard it here first. We'll see you guys next time.
