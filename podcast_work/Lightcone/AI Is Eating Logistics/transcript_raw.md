[00:00:00] Logistics are very scale-driven industry and so the bigger you get the cheaper you get
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_02: our take is that we can make the price of shipping anything by ocean container shipping between 8
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_02: and 10% cheaper over the next few years and AI is a big part of that. So our AI for that
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_02: saved us 2% of our ocean freight spend while improving transit time 20%. Usually that's a trade-off.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_02: It's like you're either faster or cheaper but not both. And you're at $2 billion
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: a year revenue and just getting started.
[00:00:35] Welcome back to another episode of The Light Cone. We've got a real treat today.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_00: We have Ryan Peterson of Flexport with us. He went through YC in 2014 and he is easily
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: one of the most awesome founders I've ever met. Ryan thanks a lot for joining.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_00: Thank you. To start Ryan, what is Flexport and what are some of the things in AI you're actually
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_00: implementing right now? So Flexport is a global logistics company built around a modern
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: tech stack and that means we help companies ship cargo from point A to point B across any
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_02: mode of transport. So air, ocean, truck and rail and get that cargo delivered hopefully on time
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_02: and in full at a lower cost thanks to the tech. What we're doing today is man it's an exotic,
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_02: I had to make an exhaustive it was extend the link to the podcast to pull that off but starts with
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_02: customer user experience. What can we do with their data? Getting them better access. How do we
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_02: load containers in the optimal way? How do we put that container onto the right ship at the lowest
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_02: cost while maintaining or beating transit time expectations? Automating just tons of work that's
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_02: done in email or that you or phone or work that you wouldn't even do because the cost is too high
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_02: for a human but actually does create some value that's worth it with AI. So most contracts in logistics
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_02: come in giant Excel files, thousands of rows and you know, dozen tabs. You can't just feed that to
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_02: open AI and get an answer get a structured JSON file back. It needs intelligence but writing code
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_02: and then having AI write the code. You write a parser that ingests it and then have AI that
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_02: can write those parsers for you learning. It's an endless list and we feel like we don't even know
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_02: all the things that they can do. It's so pretty new. So basically one of the most human intensive
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: things now can be streamlined to the point where actually it might affect GDP in the world.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: Our take is that we can make the price of shipping anything by ocean container shipping
[00:02:30] cheaper by between eight and 10% cheaper over the next few years. And AI is a big not the only
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_02: part of that but a big part of that as our business model the way we think about it is as I call it
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_02: scale economy is shared which is the bigger you get the cheaper you get the more automation is
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_02: a form of scale and the bigger you get or the cheaper you get the lower the lower your cost you
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_02: give that share that with your customer which will make them do even more volume with you
[00:02:55] their scale benefits that come logistics are very scale driven industry. And so the bigger you
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_02: get the cheaper you get like the Costco model I like I like I love Costco even though I don't shop
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_02: there I just love the business you keep driving down the price that makes you more attractive more
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_02: competitive and just keep going. And you're at two billion dollars a year revenue and just getting
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: started. Just getting started yes. Something I'm curious about so from our perspective we work
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_04: with the startups and we've seen like AI of the last couple years ago from like when chat
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_04: you be t launched and then like some startups and the batch start playing around with it and it's
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_04: become like progressively more serious. I think you're the first person we've had on the show who's
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_04: running a company at scale that was founded pre AI. What are the last few years been for you
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_04: from that perspective from like chat Gbt launch? Like what point did it start becoming like a thing
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_04: you would pay more attention to? Like so many other people is on November of 2020 was at 2022.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_02: It's already been a few years since the chat Gbt launch been personally obsessed ever since then.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_02: It's interesting to watch it take hold at the company and in some cases not take hold and you
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: then saying like come on guys we can't be this boomer company. Everybody needs to be using this.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_02: We're trying to drive that sense of paranoia from from the top from me but but many others in the
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_02: company maybe even more paranoid than me or more enthusiastic excited than me as well. To say
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_02: that story that we say of like well we're the only large logistics company founded since the
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_02: web browser and I know there's a kid in the next YC batch who say hey we're the only
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_02: brave border founded since it's got to be seen in 2022 like it's got a point. So we have to be
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_02: leading on this. This is true of all incumbents in an industry. They have some real advantages when
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: it comes to AI and benefiting from it and one is the scale of the data. Two is the domain experience
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_02: to know okay which problems should we be solving? And some of those problems are small enough that
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_02: you shouldn't start a whole company around the problem. It's maybe a feature not a company.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_02: But for them it's great it's a valuable feature that they could add. And third is distribution like
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: when we build or any large company builds a great AI product the next day it can be used by
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_02: thousands of companies whereas a startup doing that has to go beg people for their data to train the
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_02: model and trust get earn their trust to have that data from a security compliance standpoint. And
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_02: then third get the customer get you know so that's the huge advantage that any incremental have and
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_02: we think we definitely feel that we have that advantage at our scale. But the flip side where I
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_02: think we also have an advantage is that we are still a young company relative to our industry but
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_02: young in terms of our tech stack like we build our own tech therefore we can implement
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_02: integrate AI and just add it wherever we want most of our competitors treat AI a treat
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_02: technology period as IT as a service that they pay for. Many cases like desktop app or like
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_02: windows remote desktop is very common in our industry but still it's something they buy and
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_02: therefore you don't control the code base. If you wanted to add AI to automate something or do
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_02: some of you're like it's not really it's hard. Has there been a specific moments in such
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_04: CBT launch where you started as a company sort of taking it more seriously or because my
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_04: impression like the first version was a toy even within the YC batches like we sort of see some
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_04: founders playing around with things but it wasn't clear that they'd actually be like companies
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_04: founded on it. So I'm just curious what's like founder running a large scale company. You start
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_04: out you're like this is really interesting to me personally like what was this some moment where
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_04: you're like oh like we should probably try and like build something or do something internally with
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_04: this. Yeah I think a lot of it has come through in our hackathons but there could be an interesting
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_02: metric here is like what percentage of hackathon projects first of all use AI like we're building
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_02: something with large language models and which percent of the projects actually you decided to
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_02: and push into like let's actually make this thing real it's not just a hack.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_02: Is hackathon something you've done for a while? Yeah we usually do two a year okay. I think now we're
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_02: like kind of religious about two every year but but one to two a year where and for us it's very
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_02: much of free for you to build anything you want. If you look now at the last two hackathons we've
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_02: done it'd be like 90% LLM based projects in my I haven't studied it but it's just like feeling
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_02: my feeling my gut whereas probably 18 months ago there were like four or five.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_02: Interesting. There's probably 50 60 teams that do a hackathon project each time. In the beginning
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_02: of Flexport I was very much of this idea that like you just let let the people get smart people
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_02: and get out of their way and go execute and oh that sounds like manager mode. Yeah I was I
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_02: way too much manager mode I had this idea of like human beings were going to flourish if only
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_02: they could be separate. I don't want to be told what to do by the man that's why I started with a
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_02: company. I don't want to be told what to do and I went through my own Chesky moment of founder mode
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_02: and recognizing how you got to be way more topstown and directive and tell people what to do and
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_02: get people aligned and rowing in the right direction and that's been my evolution the last two
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_02: years at Flexport. I've been pretty way more hands on and hardcore and directing the business but
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_02: then as I see these hackathons I'm like I never would have come up with that idea in a million
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_02: years and I got to let these guys build what they want to build and flourish and so I'm starting
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_02: and now come back on myself and say where's the room in our product roadmap for bottoms up innovation
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_02: certainly you see it in these hackathons and trying to maybe even start making sure I do the
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_02: hackathon timing before we say we do our kind of roadmap exercise every six months or so we
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_02: probably do the hackathon right before that so that when you see a great idea you can budget it
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_02: instead of after I mean there's a noteworthy change here that's happening for you that I mean
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: I think most companies might throw a hackathon and then in most hackathons the 90% of the projects
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: are just like toys and you never return to them again like you know someone gets a nice
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_00: participation trophy and that's it yeah but like it sounds like the difference right now in the age
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: of LLMs and age of intelligence is that these hackathon things are actually turning into real product
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_00: lines and features for you yes and and at the very least into debates in my head of being like man
[00:08:59] I've got to do that but I lost we're gonna we're gonna crush everybody with just our regular roadmap
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: but I had this after the very last I think our last our next hackathons in two weeks or the last
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_02: or six months ago I remember thinking afterwards I'm like you know what we could just only do that
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_02: stuff and we'll also win yeah maybe win faster maybe is highly unlikely that the person at the top
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_02: now knows best what the best implications are applications are that it's just as likely that someone
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_02: on the front line is closer to the problem is gonna go hey look watch it can do this you go oh man
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_02: I wouldn't have guessed they could do that you kind of need engineers who are just really into it
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_04: and I've been playing around with that and just like understand how to like build the products in
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_04: the first place to come with the idea as probably engineers and engineers being really close to the
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_02: business is something we've always prided ourselves on like really being in the weeds and one of the
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_02: other things that we've done is create a program for non-engineers to learn AI skills and if
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_02: kind of formalized programs so you're managed to agree but you get one day a week for 90 days it's
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_02: a 90 day program one day a week where we teach you kind of a AI bootcamp vibe coding in different
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_02: ways to apply and it's a new progress we're only about six months into this we'll see how it works
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_02: people love it and you are seeing gains but the promise of the leader who created this and
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_02: convince the managers to give up someone for 20% of their time to go into it was I will return
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_02: them to you as 10 times more productive than their peers I'm sure we haven't have achieved that
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_02: or it would show up in the metrics but that is the you know that's the idea how you training all
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: these folks to a level scale in AI what are what are the sorts of things they're learning certainly
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_01: it's it's cursor and a set of related products like that that like I think we're using something
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_02: called streamlit but probably there's YC company I don't know maybe she's repilit or something
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_02: with similar ideas you can spin up build your own little apps build workflow automation tools to
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_02: say okay because a lot of what flexport is we call it freight forwarding I've often joked you should
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_02: be called freight email forwarding you're like taking docs and sending it on so how do you look at
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_02: a person's job and there's no one better to look at it than the person doing the job and saying oh
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_02: man I'm doing the same thing over and over again what if I instead it's like if everybody was an
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_02: engineer they would and I thought about this in the past is saying hey what if I took one group
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_02: of engineers and hire them as engineers as a big bait and switch and then tell them actually you're
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_02: just moving freight sorry and watch them automate their way out of the job right and you sort of say
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_02: okay I never really wanted to do that to an engineer because I feel like I just have a revolt of
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_02: but now you kind of like well I can do it to a non-engineer who's already doing that job and
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_02: turn them into a lightweight nook low code which is cool yeah it's going the other direction where you're
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_02: taking really all the super domain experts and now they can finally build and they can automate
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_01: themselves out of it instead of getting the engineer to do it yeah and that that program started on
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_02: our Amsterdam we have an engineering office in Amsterdam it started there I think they did it
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_02: without me knowing about it for the first six the few months and then now we're like oh this is great
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_02: everybody loves it so we're starting to bring it global to other offices I wonder if you could
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_03: share some examples of the AI projects that you rolled out that have been most impactful over the
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_03: last couple of years both customer facing features but also like any internal operational things
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_03: that you guys have automated that maybe the customers have no idea about yeah the customer facing
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_02: one probably the most impactful like a lot of what you care about for me logistics companies your
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_02: data what's going on with my supply chain where the types of data that people are looking at it so
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_02: the way Flexport work you place orders to your factories through Flexport I'm replenishing my
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_02: inventory I'm buying things up placing purchase orders so those flow out to the factory factory
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_02: becomes a user there's a nice network effect there once the cargo is ready they place a booking
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_02: and then we execute that booking to move the freight come pick it up on this date and we'll execute
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_02: by air ocean truck rail whatever and move it across the world for you so that's kind of the loop
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_02: that we're trying to run so you care a lot about the data for on-time performance skew level
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_02: performance cost you care a lot about that there's customs attributes here that are super important
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_02: with tariffs and everything's happening so being able to get that data as one of the core areas
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_02: that Flexport shines already historically with AI and this did start as a hackathon project we just
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_02: built like natural language ability so that you don't need to know SQL you don't need to build
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_02: dashboards you just type your question and it generates those graphs charts tables don't think it
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_02: does maps yet but it should and it works and that is done wonder one customers love it but two is
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_02: about 25% of our account management time is spent helping people generate reports
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_02: that's the another huge metric for us if we're cheaper will more people choose us it's not
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_02: that we just started using AI with LLMs we've had a machine learning model for doing planning
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_02: for and planning in the sense of logistics means let's say on a containerized basis I've got a
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_02: container which ship should it go on therefore you need all the contracts with their price you need
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_02: the sailing schedules like how long is it going to take which route variability all around
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_02: those things so our AI for that saved us 2% of our ocean freight spend while improving transit time
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_02: 20% usually that's a tradeoff it's like either faster or cheaper yeah but not both so huge wind
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_02: there customers don't they care a lot about those metrics they don't care how we did it and for
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_02: that one was the unlock parsing a bunch of unstructured like emails and data that you get from
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_03: the shipping companies that have this but it's all like in like a big paragraph where like you
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_03: couldn't just like run a simple query on it before sort of yeah you the way to think about it is um
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_02: you've got if you just put a container on the cheapest contract you you made it's an optimization
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_02: okay which ones the cheapest but also the fast you know I'm trading off so that that's one thing
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_02: that machines are better at and then it's the scale of that so on a given week we have about 2000
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_02: containers that get canceled by our customers they place the booking and then they say oh actually
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_02: the cargo's not ready the factories late it's just inevitable it's gonna happen what software
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_02: does that humans could never do is go through 10 times a day and taking each one of those containers
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_02: and say okay I lost this container it's been canceled is there another container that was meant to
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_02: depart one week from now and I'll grab that and move it forward that's how you get the 20%
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_02: transit time increase and then the optimization piece of fine is just fine the cheapest contract
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_02: like a solver out you know I'll grow them to go find the human come do that because it has to
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_04: happen really quickly is this happening 10 times a day for every container in the system okay you
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_02: know it's just like you would you maybe you could but you wouldn't you have time like an
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_04: on the call to get crazy if you calculate this first principle sounded like that first version was
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_01: using classical optimization problems and you have certain data about all these shipments and
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_01: puts up with them scheduled what do you think is the delta that you could get with AI now that you
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_01: could harness all the instructor data so what kind of efficiencies could you get you may be able to
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_01: get a lot more now that you're starting to see it tool use because the tool itself is incredibly
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_02: powerful and I don't think in a lm will outperform that but the lm can use that tool and it could do
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_02: other things outside of that so you can we'll see we haven't started to do that yet so we're actually
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_02: still using that I can actually email people a little cool them up and yeah but it could you assign
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_02: the lm the same solver problem but it is good at default to use this tool and then it'll also say
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_02: yes maybe this container I'm not sure if I could move it forward I should ask the customer would be
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_02: a good idea actually email the hey is it okay if I bring you this container early like the solver
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_02: still there but then basically the agent is the user yes instead of right now there's not really a
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_02: user or there's someone is approving the plan and so you could make that person upstream of the solver
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_02: choose the solver as one of many tools so that'd be interesting we haven't done that yet but and then
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_02: the other thing is to just routine work for example you've got a lot of email communication with
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_02: your customer base so how do you take this you say I want a place of booking for a container
[00:16:58] translate that into a booking lm's are quite good at that or a big use case today is verifying
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_02: warehouse addresses and other information and getting appointments I've got to deliver to a warehouse
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_02: quite costly to call the warehouse and be like do I have the right address look you're not
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_02: going to do it every time and then you have a lot of misses where your address data was bad
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_02: and you truck a lot you know pain in the ass so lm's now before we deliver we if we haven't
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_02: delivered to the site in the last three months there's an lm agent it does email and voice
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_02: interesting wow so if necessary actually call the warehouse and be like hey can you confirm the 2
[00:17:36] pm tomorrow is a okay time to deliver this yes yes yes yes it's great because you're turning this
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_01: previous communication protocol which is very much as opposed very lossy to work sort of like
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_01: the internet like TCP fully acknowledge and you can get guarantees sometimes it's not
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_02: replacing work although i'm very happy to do so but like in some cases the work would have been
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_02: too expensive so you just didn't do the work huh to do this phone call and even if a human could do
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_02: it's like not worth it another good one is just messages so like the way we communicate with our
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_02: customers some of its email but a lot we try to drive as much as possible through our messaging
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_02: applications inside the inside the flex port platform there's this huge amount of signal in that
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_02: just customer sentiment if if if a customer in aka the AI we've trained the model to detect unhappy
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_02: customers in the way that they message us and then that creates an automatic escalation to
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: the manager of the front-wind person doing hey this person seems upset as long as emotion and
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_02: logistics you know this your stuff your business is done online you need to get it delivered
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_02: infinite list we in fact we measured at the beginning of the year we automated 20% of the work it was
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_02: pretty low scale of automation we're gonna finish this year at 50% and we had set a goal for
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_02: ourselves next year of 80 we thought 80 was like sure the upper limit of what could be automated
[00:18:57] this is not scientific but now we feel like it's probably closer to 90 to 95
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_02: current and then that'll get way more so as lul msk progressing how will that affect like
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_03: the total cost of ocean freight like if all the human work gets automated does stuff actually get
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_03: materially cheaper yeah it's 10% of the end cost that the by the the importer exporter pays for
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_02: their freight 10% if you look at the full pnl about 10% is the labor cost in the freight forwarding
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_02: layer of logistics wow so so when a is like fully rolled out like stuff will actually get 10% cheaper
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_03: well the freight of removing the stuff the cost of moving it right the stuff itself depends on
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_03: of what the ratio is but yeah but like the transportation costs of like international freight is
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_03: actually like 10% on containerized ocean freight that's our that's our view is that we can drop
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_02: the price of everything by around 8% and maybe it goes to 9% over the next few years by doing this
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_02: that's has some less big economic ripples in terms of if it's becoming cheaper to ship things
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_01: across the ocean is it gonna create just more trade I mean this is a trade war it's bad
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_01: exactly it's very hard to control for that in the mirror what we're terrorists just made
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_02: everything like 10 times more expensive but we're doing our part I mean the white pill on AI right
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_00: now is you know this hope and sort of possibility that AI rolled out properly across society would
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_00: increase GDP 7% a year so this would be maybe seven percent a year will double you in 10 years
[00:20:26] SPEAKER_02: is the the law of 72 yeah yeah that is the hope right and I think more people should talk about that
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_02: and everyone's so worried about automating away the jobs and I just think that
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_02: misunderstands the role of companies in the in society like the role of companies is not to employ
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_02: people it's to deliver goods and services and in fact whoever employs the least number of people
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_02: will have the lowest cost and win and that's how they benefit society is lowering costs and making
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_02: things more available for us to buy and sell and that there's this idea well how are people
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_02: going to make money if AI is doing all the work and I I think that that very much misunderstands
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_02: human nature that will will just want more things like there's an infinite desire inside the the
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_02: human soul can never be satisfied without God we need more stuff like we got to have more we got
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_02: to have more and so we're trying to return to the garden we may get a return to some I think that
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_02: actually the internet first we haven't quite reconciled this on like a spiritual philosophical level
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_02: the emergence of these technologies and an AI would not even be getting to of what it means for us
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_02: but there's a period in history called the axial age it's about 500 years BC and that's when coins
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: really started to spread what you had if you think about it with coins is taking transactions
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_02: between two people and making and really making them very impersonal you no longer care who you're
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_02: doing business with I don't need that for ledger to this guy owe me money what's my relationship to
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_02: I trust him just like here take this thing so and it actually led to this breakdown in
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_02: societies because we just stopped being so knowing your neighbor like you used to only do business
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_02: with your neighbors now you could just do business then the old person the internet kind of does
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: that at scale what happened in the actual age you had this breakdown of ability for of trust and
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_02: you started to get your generosity and all kinds of like things that start to break down a society
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_02: and simultaneously across the world you had four major profits that emerged
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_02: yet well profits as of sort yet Buddha you had Laos Confucius and Socrates they all lived
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_02: at the exact same moment in time right as coins were taking hold that's amazing as like hey we need
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_02: to we need to kind of like get our hands around how do we behave in this new world so I do think
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_02: there's an opportunity here maybe it could be you Gary at YC to be the next the next Socrates
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_02: I'm in but I might not be the right person but I mean I particularly like this idea that like
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_00: the idea that what are humans going to do is a little bit invalid in the view that's a little
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_00: bit like going back five eight hundred years and saying like oh my god all of us are farmers
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_00: and then what are we going to do when modern agriculture comes yeah and it's like we figured it out
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_00: like we were you know the printing press yeah right what are the what are the monks going to do
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_02: they're transcribing words all day there's no more jobs for transcribed like so there will be
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_00: implications for society and morality and how people relate to one another and obviously like
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_00: and we have no idea it's early days but history does kind of repeat and there's lessons there
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_02: and figure out okay how does this but the human nature doesn't change what's right and you can't
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_02: satisfy humans you just get it what more stuff the more money you have the more classically right
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_02: cliche like the more you have the more you want that's not going to go away so you give people a lot
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_02: more stuff is not like I'm gonna quit working most people aren't like that I'm gonna get a lot of
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_02: stuff I'm just quit working you find out you're miserable you want to keep producing keep contributing
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_02: one of the interesting things that has been percolating around the Weissic community among young
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_00: founders and like AI researchers that we've been talking to is this idea that like they're going
[00:24:00] SPEAKER_00: to be humans in the loop the humans in the loop may well be some some might be like government
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_00: mandated right you infintech there's a lot around you cannot have an AI algorithm like approved
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_00: loans for instance they're like requirements from the government in these highly regulated
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_00: industries to have humans in the loop and then customs brokerage as well we have to have a human
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_02: that's improving the transaction before before we clear customs yeah and so vibe coatings happening
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_00: there's this idea of you enter a prompt it comes back with a bunch of stuff and then you just
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_00: click accept all changes without reading any of it right do you think this might happen that
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_00: would this happen at Flexport would this happen uh written more broadly across all businesses like
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_00: what if businesses are at the core like hyper intelligent AI that uh has access to all your systems
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_00: of record knows what to do optimizes constantly and then you have sort of like government mandated
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_00: liability sinks that are humans in the loop ideally the organization is still actually sort of
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_00: human needs in which case like the decision to use you know vendor a or vendor b sometimes boils
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_00: down to who brought me to the nicest take-home last so then like the model for companies ends up
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_00: being ASI of some sort like some sort of AI process at the core of each company but then you know
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_00: humans attached to it as either like decision makers in like you know accepting or preventing liability
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_00: and or holding relationships with other relationship holders at other companies yeah and presumably
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_02: you're still relating with you're still here to serve humans you know once we get to our
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_02: world of our AI serving AI then fair enough you don't need to learn that much from the uh
[00:25:46] record of human history because there's no more humans involved in the loop and I don't have a lot
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_02: to say about that but as long as there's humans there there's going to be humans you're going to
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_02: want to relate with other humans and have a relationship and that we're pretty pretty far from
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_02: humans preferring to work with AI then to work with other humans we're seeing where AI is doing more
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_02: and more work you know another good example is and just didn't even think of with your bank you
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_02: know you have to have an approval or a prover is that even our humans and customs brokerage across
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_02: the industry we benchmark make about 2% mistakes and they file the entry with 2% and we built
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_02: this sort of like AI spell checker the 2-digit code for Australia versus Austria you could easily
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_02: get that wrong and AI will figure out like this thing is not made and Australia has made an
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_02: Austria I guess one question for you Ryan is if you were to start Flexport today how would the
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: company be different not that different I hope the things that Flexport did really well compared to
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_02: all the other tech companies who have tried and failed in our space both before we came along and
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_02: in parallel is we didn't look at ourselves as a pure technology company we're willing to pick up
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_02: the phone and solve problems with humans drive down to the port still to this day like I we've got
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_02: a new customers asking us to do something really weird we need a crane on the truck to unload this
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_02: thing that we don't have that is not typical what we do and I just take the customer and I need you
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_02: to drive there and follow the truck and make sure this goes well so I would not change that at all
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_02: and I think that's that that's the mistake that a lot of tech people will in traditional markets
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_02: will fail at because they're like oh if there's no API I can't do it if my agent is unable to do
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_02: this task I guess the task can't be done no tool use for cranes yeah it might take you a long time
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_02: and you should not try to automate that last that tale of things you started and grew Flexport like
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_04: especially in those first few years during era was just like more money coming into like there's
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_04: more venture capital each year coming into startups and like you're like multiple fundraising rounds
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_04: like in what ways was like that capital like an advantage and I feel like now is sort of somewhat
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_04: back there in the AI world now like the rounds are heating up there's more money flowing in it
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_04: just sort of like post like the 2022 crash yeah what's your advice to the founders now who are in
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_04: these like companies that are growing and have options to raise like huge funding rounds like how
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_04: should they think about it every company is super unique so don't listen advice on the podcast
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_02: like get someone who's like paying attention you know knows the details of your business which no
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_02: one will know better than you generally capital is a beautiful thing having it in your bank account
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_02: gives you a lot of advantages all you really need to care about at the end of the day is
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_02: price for share because if you issue more stock like the number as long as your price for share goes
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_02: up you you are richer doesn't matter how many what percent you own until it comes to control so
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_02: there's two things that matter you control your company legally or otherwise culturally it also works
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_02: but do you really have control over what's going to the decisions that are made and do you have a
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_02: job and and price for share and that all that matters I think I still think that's true that's
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_02: always how I thought about is there's been a lot of dilution to our investors but the price for
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_02: share went up and everybody's made better off I didn't take away anybody shares so you're better off
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_02: the part that I underappreciated and that now I'm that take very very seriously is the degree to
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_02: which money just wants to spend itself and you will end up making a lot of mistakes where in the
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_02: biggest mistake is believing for sure every company has a lot of problems and you start to
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_02: default it like oh we'll just use money to solve this problem and the way that that manifests
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_02: itself is oh I got this thing that we need to do okay hire someone to do it and you feel like
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_02: you just end up very bloated we had too many people you start to really slow down and it's just a
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_02: super bad cultural approach to problem solving like you're going to solve the problems not the new
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_02: people that are you're going to hire so I give this advice only one founders ever listen to me but I
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_02: tell founders who who friends of mine who raise a large round is sure go raise a big round as
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_02: long as you're up around like you're doing good great raise a large round then do a hiring
[00:29:51] freeze for 90 days the next day to tell your team culturally like nope the money's not going to solve
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_02: our problems we're going to solve our problems and keep that and then of course you're go higher
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_02: but it's because it's super it can happen us over and over again where you just like head count got
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_02: out of control all the plans look good I want to fund all the we're doing budgeting for next year
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_02: and I'm like it's so painful not to you know add up X add engineers whatever but you got to say
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_02: discipline in the money you'll easily make that stop so I really psyched to hear about this idea
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: that AI is actually transforming your business in pretty fundamental ways it's like coming bottom
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_00: up what does flex port look like in 2035 what cool thing about flex port is the way our vision is
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_02: evolved I mentioned we started as a customer broker now we do all end to end all the way from factory
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_02: floor to consumer stores like we have an e-commerce business that does fulfillment retail store
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_02: distribution etc so we want to take that globally so where you can really ship anything anywhere
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_02: by any means any mode in any quantity and do it all be a code like all available via APIs or voice
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_02: or you're just like easy to execute transactions at the lowest cost automated way the cost and so
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_02: that brands companies of all kinds don't spend time thinking about logistics logistics should be
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_02: this utility that just works just like you don't spend time thinking about the electrical grid you flip
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_02: the lights which you get power you go back to doing your thing which is making something people want
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_02: and talking to users right that's what I think companies should do our customers should be doing that
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_02: all day like make great products make a great brand to sell those products and we'll take care of
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_02: everything in between in the most automated efficient liable ways possible on a global basis so
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_02: today and we have a long ways to go to actually make all that true for self-admiration stuff I
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_02: talked about making progress but I got to keep going and then the global aspect so we have
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_02: employee we shipped cargo to and from 147 countries last year but we only have employees in 22
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_02: countries and therefore people on the ground they can do the work yes we are automating that work
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_02: and in fact it's easier for us to automate our own employees work than it is some third-party
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_02: company that's doing work you know even though they're in our software it's very hard to automate
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_02: we don't know what they're doing so we want to be in every country by 2035 certainly in fact our
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_02: roadmap has us covering 95% of all container trade with our own people doing all the work in the
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_02: country in 2028 so by 2035 I think we could realistically say look we'll be everywhere that's
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_02: that's legal and that is a big extension of our original vision and I didn't have all that
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_02: in mind when I did YC demo day my pitch was like we're due customs and then we'll add some other
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_02: stuff but it wasn't like we will cover the earth many two plates on earth whatever you want to move
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_02: we'll move it uh it's uh yeah it's a very ambitious goal the good thing is I really genuinely
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_02: we're gonna win on tech we're winning we're gonna extend our lead there relative to our peers our
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_02: competitors we're behind them on the global side that's super fun if you told 25-year-old me they're
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_02: like oh Ryan your job this year is we got a launch flex port in Indonesia australia Japan
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_02: Philippines Turkey and Poland and France I'm like oh my really I get to go to all those places and
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_02: talk to the locals and stuff so it's a it's a pretty fun moment in our history but also really
[00:33:16] challenging but fun kind of challenging yeah no better kind
[00:33:22] Ryan thank you so much for joining us man it's always a pleasure all right we'll see you guys next time
