[00:00:00] Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:11] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17] And now, for my discussion with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg. Justin, thanks so much for being here.
[00:00:22] Andrew Huberman: Great to be here.
[00:00:23] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: I am a true novice when it comes to the microbiome.
[00:00:28] Andrew Huberman: So I'd like to start off with a really basic question, which is, what is the microbiome?
[00:00:34] Andrew Huberman: I think, you know, just to start off with clarifying terminology, microbiome and microbiota quite often are used to refer to our microbial community interchangeably.
[00:00:43] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And I'll probably switch between those two terms today.
[00:00:46] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: The other important thing to realize is that these microbes are not just in our gut, but they're all over our body.
[00:00:52] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: They're in our nose, they're in our mouths, they're on our skin.
[00:00:56] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Basically, anywhere that the environment can get to in our body, which includes inside or digestive tract, of course, is colonized with microbes.
[00:01:05] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And the vast majority of these are in our distal gut and in our colon.
[00:01:10] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so this is the gut microbiota or gut microbiome.
[00:01:13] And the density of this community is astounding.
[00:01:18] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: You start off with a zoomed out view and you see something that looks like, you know, fecal material that digests inside the gut.
[00:01:25] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And you zoom in and you start to, you know, get to the microscopic level and see the microbes.
[00:01:30] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: They are just packed, you know, side to side end to end. It's a super dense bacterial community almost like a biofilm.
[00:01:38] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: To the point where it's thought that, you know, around 30% of fecal matter is microbes, 30 to 50%.
[00:01:44] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So, you know, it's an incredibly dense microbial community.
[00:01:48] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We're talking of, you know, trillions of microbial cells.
[00:01:53] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And all those microbial cells, if you start to get to know them and see who they are, break out in the gut, probably two hundreds to a thousand species.
[00:02:04] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Most of these are bacteria, but there are a lot of other life forms there.
[00:02:09] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: There are archaea, which are little microbes that are bacteria like, but they're different.
[00:02:15] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: There are eukaryotes.
[00:02:18] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So, you know, we commonly think of eukaryotes in the gut as, you know, something like a parasite.
[00:02:25] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But there are eukaryotes, there are fungi, there are also little viruses.
[00:02:31] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: There are these bacteria, fages that infect bacterial cells.
[00:02:36] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so, and those actually outnumber the bacteria like 10 to 1.
[00:02:41] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So, they're just everywhere there. They kill bacteria.
[00:02:45] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so, there's these really interesting predator prey interactions.
[00:02:49] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But overall, it's just this really dense, complex, dynamic ecosystem.
[00:02:54] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Are microbiota seen in newborns? In other words, where do they come from?
[00:02:59] Andrew Huberman: And dare I ask, what direction do they enter the body?
[00:03:03] Andrew Huberman: There have been some studies that have looked at whether there are microbes in the womb and microbes colonizing the fetus.
[00:03:10] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And there's some debate about this, but overall, it looks like that's not a big part of the equation of microbial colonization.
[00:03:15] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so, each time an infant is born, it's this new ecosystem.
[00:03:21] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: It's like an island rising up out of the ocean that has no species on it.
[00:03:25] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And suddenly, there's this like land rush for, you know, this open territory.
[00:03:29] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: There also are a lot of different trajectories that developmental process can take because our microbiota is so malleable and so plastic.
[00:03:37] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And those trajectories can be affected by all sorts of factors in early life.
[00:03:42] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So, an example is whether an infant is born by C-section or born vaginally.
[00:03:47] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Infants that are born by C-section actually have a gut microbiota that looks more like human skin than it does like either the birth canal, the vagina microbiota or the mother's stool microbiota.
[00:04:06] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Compound on top of that, whether your breastfed or formula fed, whether your family has a pet or doesn't have a pet, whether you're exposed to antibiotics.
[00:04:15] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: There are all these factors that really can change that developmental process and really change your microbial identity eventually in life.
[00:04:24] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We know from animal studies that depending upon the microbes that you get early in life, you can send the immune system or metabolism of an organism or other parts of their biology in totally different developmental trajectories.
[00:04:42] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So, what microbes you're colonized with early in life can really change your biology.
[00:04:47] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: How do I know if my microbiome is healthy or unhealthy?
[00:04:49] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Context matters a lot. What's healthy for one person or one population may not be healthy for another person or population.
[00:04:56] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And I will say that there's no single answer to this, but there's some really important considerations.
[00:05:01] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Perhaps the best way to start talking about this is to go back to the inception of the Human Microbiome Project, which was this program that NIH started.
[00:05:10] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: They invested a lot of money in 2008, 2009 for really propelling the field of gut microbiome research.
[00:05:20] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: It was becoming evident at that point that this was not just a curiosity of human biology that it was probably really important for our health.
[00:05:27] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Through those studies, we really started to get the image that there is this tremendous individuality in the gut microbiome.
[00:05:34] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so it's really hard to start drawing conclusions after initial pass of that project of what is a healthy microbiome.
[00:05:45] But the other thing that we started to realize at the same time, there were studies going on documenting the gut microbiome of traditional populations of humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural populations.
[00:05:58] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And those studies were really mind-blowing from the perspective of all these people are healthy.
[00:06:04] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: They're living very different lifestyles. And their microbiome doesn't look anything like a healthy American microbiome.
[00:06:12] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so one possibility is that in the industrialized world we have a different microbiome from traditional populations,
[00:06:20] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: and that microbiome is well adapted to our current lifestyle, and therefore healthy in the context of an industrialized society.
[00:06:26] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And there probably are elements of that that are true.
[00:06:29] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But another possibility is that this is a microbiome that's gone off the rails.
[00:06:33] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: That it is deteriorating in the face of antibiotic use and all the problems associated with an industrialized diet, western diet,
[00:06:45] and that even though the human microbiome project documented the microbiome of healthy people, healthy Americans,
[00:06:55] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: that what they really may have been documenting there is a perturbed microbiota that's really predisposing people to a variety of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.
[00:07:06] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: If my gut microbiome was dysbiotic, it was off early in life, can I rescue that through proper conditions and exercise,
[00:07:16] Andrew Huberman: or is there some sort of fixed pattern that's going to be hard for me to escape from?
[00:07:21] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Yeah, there's a big field that's emerging now that we refer to as kind of reprogramming the gut microbiome.
[00:07:29] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And the issue that I think we're seeing in the field is that microbiomes quite often, whether they're diseased or healthy, exist in stable states,
[00:07:40] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: and have 10 towards this well that has gravity to it in a way biological gravity, where it's really hard to dislodge that community from that state.
[00:07:52] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So even individuals, for instance, that get antibiotics, you take oral antibiotics, the community takes this huge hit, we know that a bunch of microbes die, the composition changes,
[00:08:04] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: and that represents a period of vulnerability where pathogens can come in and take over and cause disease.
[00:08:10] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But if that doesn't happen, the microbiota kind of works its way back to something that is not exactly like, but similar to the pre-annabiotic treatment.
[00:08:20] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We know with dietary perturbations quite often, you'll see a really rapid change to the gut microbiome, and then it's almost like a memory where it snaps back to this something that's very similar to the original state,
[00:08:33] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: even though the diet remains different. And so there's this incredible, we refer to as resilience of the gut microbiome and resistance to change, or at least resistance to establishing a new stable state.
[00:08:46] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So that doesn't mean it's hopeless to change an unhealthy microbiome to a healthy microbiome, but it does mean that we need to think carefully about restructuring these communities in ways where we can achieve a new stable state that will resist the disease.
[00:09:02] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And we need to think about a new state that will resist the microbiocommunity getting pulled back to that original state.
[00:09:09] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And one of the simplest and nicest examples of this is an experiment that we performed with mice, where we're feeding mice a normal mouse diet, a lot of nutrients there for the gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber,
[00:09:26] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: and we're asking those mice, half the mice, to a low fiber diet. And we were basically asking the question that if you switched to a western-like diet, a low fiber or higher fat diet, what happens to the gut microbiota?
[00:09:39] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And we saw the microbiota change at lost diversity. It was very similar to what we see in the difference between industrialized and traditional populations.
[00:09:49] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We brought back a healthy diet. A lot of the microbes returned, as fairly, there was this kind of memory where it went back to very similar to its original state.
[00:10:00] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: The difference is that when we put the mice on a low fiber or high fat diet and then kept them on that for multiple generations, we saw this progressive deterioration over the course of generations, where by the fourth generation, the gut microbiome was a fraction of what it originally was.
[00:10:18] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Let's say 30% of the species only remained something like 70% of the species had gone extinct or appeared to have gone extinct.
[00:10:27] We then put those mice back onto a high fiber diet and we didn't see recovery. So in that case, it's a situation where a new stable state has been achieved.
[00:10:37] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: In that case, it's probably because those mice don't actually have access to the microbes that they've lost. And we actually know that we did the control experiment of mice on a high fiber diet for four generations.
[00:10:49] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: They maintain all their microbes. If we take those fourth generation mice with all the diversity and do a fecal transplant into the mice that had lost their microbes but had been returned to a high fiber diet, all of the diversity was reconstituted.
[00:11:03] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So you're a question of how do we establish new stable states? How do we get back to a healthy microbiota if we have taken a lot of antibiotics or have a deteriorated microbiota?
[00:11:14] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: It's probably a combination of having access to the right microbes. And we can talk about what that access looks like. It may look like therapeutics in the future.
[00:11:22] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: There are a lot of companies working on creating cocktails of healthy microbes, but it'll be a combination of access to the right microbes and nourishing those microbes with the proper diet.
[00:11:34] What's the idea about cleanses and fasting as it relates to the health or the dysbiosis of the microbiota?
[00:11:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah. I mean, we know that like, you know, in studies that are being done now to reprogram the got microbiota to install a completely new microbial community.
[00:11:48] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: The first step is to wash away the resident microbial community that's there. So if you're in the process of acquiring a really good microbiota and you know how to do that, then the flushing everything out is great.
[00:12:00] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Otherwise, what is happening is you're kind of leaving rebuilding of the community to chance. Like what is it? And so, you know, what microbes are going to colonize, who's going to take up space after you do this flush or cleanse?
[00:12:14] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And you know, that I think it's a little bit like playing Russian roulette. You may end up with a good microbial community in their afterwards. You may not.
[00:12:24] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: You certainly want to pay close attention to what you're eating while you're doing the reconstitution of the community after you do something like that.
[00:12:31] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: It sounds to me that avoiding processed foods is a good idea or heavily processed foods in general.
[00:12:38] Andrew Huberman: I mean, not that, you know, the occasional consumption is necessarily bad, but consuming processed foods is just bad for the microbiome. Can we say that categorically?
[00:12:48] Andrew Huberman: For sure. Yeah. You're exactly right. And we can break down, you know, there's a lot of data of why different components of processed food are so bad for us and so bad for our microbiome.
[00:12:57] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And I can talk about a few examples of that, but the flip side of this, the plant-based diet, if you're eating a bunch of complex, you know, fibers that feed your gut microbiota, your gut microbiota produces these substances called short-chain fatty acids, things like butarate.
[00:13:13] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And it's known that these short-chain fatty acids play really essential components, both in terms of fueling colonocytes, enforcing the barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating the immune system, regulating metabolism.
[00:13:25] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Your gut microbiota is just producing this vast array of fermentation and products that then get absorbed into our bloodstream and have all of these tremendous cascading effects that appear to be largely beneficial on our biology.
[00:13:40] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Now, processed foods, I think, is this other dimension where you have all of these weird chemicals, artificial sweeteners, weird fats, you know, a lot of refined simple nutrients.
[00:13:51] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: The simple nutrients we've talked about, but we know that, for instance, artificial sweeteners can have a massive negative impact on the gut microbiome and can lead us towards metabolic syndrome.
[00:14:01] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Actually, there's been beautiful work out of the Weizmann Institute on this. And then emulsifiers, these compounds that are put in processed foods to help them maintain shelf stability so things don't separate.
[00:14:13] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: You know, all the moisture content is retained appropriately. Many of these are known to disrupt the mucus layer. And as soon as you start disrupting that barrier, that can lead you in the direction of inflammation.
[00:14:26] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And in animal models, we know that can lead towards metabolic syndrome as well. So there's components of processed food that are when studied in isolation known to have a direct negative impact on gut biology and the microbiota.
[00:14:39] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: I do want to make sure that we distinguish artificial sweeteners from non-chaloric plant-based sweeteners. Do we know anything about plant-based non-chaloric sweeteners or low-chaloric sweeteners?
[00:14:51] Andrew Huberman: Very little. You know, a lot of those have a lot more bang for the buck. They're incredibly sweet, so it takes a really small amount for them to trigger a huge amount of sweetness.
[00:15:01] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so it's depending upon the mechanism of action by which these sweeteners that are not sugar are impacting our biology. It may be that those are actually less negative or more healthy than the ones that are artificial.
[00:15:19] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Just because it requires less of them in the food for us to perceive that sweet taste. Historically, there are, I think, traditional populations that use these, for instance, to sweeten different foods that our bodies just kind of know how to deal with those compounds better than the ones that are synthetic.
[00:15:37] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But I think the study still need to be done.
[00:15:40] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Do you actively avoid artificial sweeteners? Sookrilo's aspartame saccharin? You personally.
[00:15:46] Andrew Huberman: Yeah, you know, I do. I avoid them, but I'm not. I think that just doing things in moderation makes it a lot easier. And doing things slowly makes it a lot easier.
[00:15:57] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so there are very few rules that I have that are hard and fast. I'm a pretty flexible eater. I don't believe that having a diet coke will somehow cascade into some terrible disease or something like that.
[00:16:11] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: I'd love to talk about fiber and fermented foods because you and Chris had a, what I think is a really interesting and exciting paper comparing inflammatory markers of people who ate a certain amount of fiber or a certain amount of these fermented foods.
[00:16:27] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Let me take, before I dive into that study, let me take a step back because I think the reason that we did this study goes back to this kind of epiphany that we had while studying the gut microbiome because I think when we started studying it at Stanford, we were thinking about it as this kind of newly appreciated aspect of our biology, almost like finding an organ that we didn't know as there.
[00:16:49] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And starting to think about like all the drug targets that were there. Can we go in with small molecule drugs and think of ways to manipulate this community to a million rate disease.
[00:16:58] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And this is largely the mindset of Western medicine and largely born out of the era of infectious disease. You wait for an infection to start a bacterial infection. You treat with antibiotics. And you know, that's the way medicine is practiced. And that's become less successful over time as we moved into this era of inflammatory Western diseases.
[00:17:18] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Western diseases and largely moved out of the era of infectious diseases, at least infectious bacterial diseases, that this paradigm of waiting for diseases to appear and come into the clinic is not really very effective in the context of inflammatory Western diseases autoimmune diseases metabolic syndrome, heart diseases and inflammatory disease. You know, the list goes on and on.
[00:17:41] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so we started to think a lot about like how can we get out in front of this? How can we think about like preventative ways of dealing with this crisis of metabolic and inflammatory diseases.
[00:17:52] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And this tremendous beautiful body of literature started to come forward in the field that showed that the gut microbiome is absolutely critical to modulating our immune status.
[00:18:03] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So if you change the microbiome, you can fundamentally change how the immune system operates. And we know that the immune system is the at the basis of a lot of these diseases inflammatory chronic diseases.
[00:18:16] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so it brought up this possibility that maybe the fact that we're not nourishing this community well enough, maybe the fact that it's deteriorated over time due to all of the things that go along with an industrialized lifestyle antibiotics and so forth.
[00:18:32] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Maybe we have a microbiome right now in the industrialized world that is setting our immune system at a set point, simmering inflammation that's driving us towards these inflammatory diseases.
[00:18:45] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could figure out how to use diet specifically, but just kind of learn the rules of how to reconfigure both the composition and function of our gut microbiome.
[00:18:58] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So that inflammation was different in our bodies so that each one of us was less likely to go on and develop an inflammatory disease.
[00:19:07] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Our flagship study, we wanted to understand if we put people on a high fiber diet, how would that affect their microbiome and immune system?
[00:19:15] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And if we put them on a high fermented food diet, a diet rich in live microbes and all the metabolites that are present from fermentation and foods, how would that change microbiome and immune system?
[00:19:25] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: The idea was in the case of the high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
[00:19:30] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So can you eat more whole grains, more legumes, more vegetables, nuts, get the fiber up in the range of, you know, from 15 to 20 grams per day up to over 40 grams per day.
[00:19:41] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So can you kind of double or more the amount of fiber that you eat per day?
[00:19:46] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: The people that were eating the high fermented food diet, they were instructed to basically eat, you know, foods that you could buy at a grocery store that were naturally fermented and contained live microbes.
[00:20:01] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, we instructed people to eat non-sweetened yogurts.
[00:20:09] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Huge pitfall in this area is you can have a yogurt loaded with bacteria, kind of the base of what's healthy.
[00:20:15] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And then a ton of artificial flavoring and sugar loaded on top of that, manufacturers put a ton of sugar in after the fact to kind of mask the sour taste of fermented foods, which is hard for some people to become accustomed to.
[00:20:28] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Getting used to that sour flavor is difficult, but people really should try to stay away from those fermented foods that are loaded with sugar, and that's what we instructed people in this study.
[00:20:37] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: A lot of people shy away from the high quality fermented foods because they can be quite costly.
[00:20:43] Andrew Huberman: I'll just refer people to a resource in Tim Ferris' book, The Four Hour Chef. He actually gives an excellent recipe for making your own sauerkraut, which basically involves cabbage and water and salt.
[00:20:55] Andrew Huberman: But you have to do it properly because you can grow some not necessarily lethal, but somewhat dangerous bacteria if you don't scrape off the top layer properly.
[00:21:05] Andrew Huberman: But he gives beautiful instructions for how to do this in vats. You can make large amounts of truly fermented sauerkraut just from cabbage, water, and salt if you're willing to follow the protocol.
[00:21:15] Andrew Huberman: If you can get your hands on a scoby, kombucha is another one that's super simple.
[00:21:19] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: You can grow your own.
[00:21:20] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: You can just make your own, and it's super easy to do.
[00:21:23] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: I constantly have a batch of kombucha going at home.
[00:21:26] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: It's a scoby symbiotic community of bacteria in the yeast that you brew tea, you add sugar to it, and you put the scoby in and you wait a week or two depending upon the temperature.
[00:21:38] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Then you just move the scoby over to a new batch and you're old.
[00:21:44] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: What the scoby was in is kombucha, and it's wonderful.
[00:21:47] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: How much fermented food were they consuming?
[00:21:50] Andrew Huberman: Eating servings, ounces, how many times a day, early day, late day?
[00:21:54] Andrew Huberman: The general instructions were for people to eat as much fermented foods as possible, more as better.
[00:21:59] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: People during the height of the intervention phase were up over six servings on average per day of fermented food, so kind of two servings at each meal.
[00:22:09] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: The ounces or weight or size really depended on what the fermented food was, and we just told them to stick to what was a recommended dose on the package that they were buying for kombucha.
[00:22:23] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: It would be like a six to eight ounce glass, a sourcrout, like a half cup or something like that in the same with yogurt.
[00:22:29] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: The big signal really was in the fermented food group.
[00:22:32] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We saw all the things that you would hope to see in a Western microbiota and Western human.
[00:22:38] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We saw this increase in microbiota diversity over the course of the six weeks while they were consuming the fermented foods.
[00:22:44] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We can't always say that higher diversity is better when it comes to our microbial communities.
[00:22:49] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We know there are cases, for instance, bacterial vaginosis where higher diversity is actually indicative of a disease state.
[00:22:56] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But we know in the context of the gut and for people living in the industrialized world, higher diversity is generally better.
[00:23:05] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We know that there's a spectrum of diversity, people with higher diversity generally are healthier, if you can push your diversity higher, you're in better shape.
[00:23:13] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We saw that increase in diversity, and then the major question is what happened to the immune system as these people were increasing their gut microbiota diversity through the fermented foods.
[00:23:24] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We did this massive immune profiling, and we see a couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers, decrease over the course of the study.
[00:23:35] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We measure these at multiple time points throughout the course of the study, and there's this stepwise reduction in things like interleukin six and interleukin 12, a variety of famous inflammatory mediators.
[00:23:50] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And then even if you go into the immune cells and you start looking at their signaling cascades, we see that those signaling cascades are less activated at the end of the study compared to the beginning of the study indicating an attenuation of inflammation.
[00:24:03] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So kind of exactly what we would hypothesize would lead to less propensity for inflammatory disease over time.
[00:24:11] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: That's a huge extension of a very short study.
[00:24:14] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But did people say they were feeling better in any way? And if so, what did you observe? And again, we're highlighting these as anecdot data.
[00:24:21] Andrew Huberman: You know, tons of people say they have more energy, they think more clearly, they sleep better, and it's really hard to un couple like, is this because these people have taken charge now of what they're eating and just feel better in general for being in control of kind of what they're doing?
[00:24:35] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Or is there this cascading set of effects that are actually kind of emanating from the gut brain access?
[00:24:42] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And I should say, you know, the list of this goes on and on. There are people who claim that their complexion improves and that their allergies and there's probably all sorts of ripple effects. If you can affect your inflammation, we know that you can affect your cognition.
[00:24:56] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We know that you can affect your skin and inflammation that's occurring on your skin.
[00:25:01] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So I really think that there is a basis for a lot of those anecdotes. It may just be hard to see in a short study and in a small, you know, a small cohort of people over a short period of time.
[00:25:14] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: You know, we also have a standardized stool measure that people use and there was, you know, kind of less constipation, better bowel movements over the course of both of these interventions.
[00:25:28] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So it did seem like bowel habits improved, which a lot of times can lead to better moods, but that we weren't able to measure that.
[00:25:36] What sorts of interesting things did you observe in the fiber group?
[00:25:40] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Data seem to be telling us that if you start off with a diverse microbiota, maybe one that's better equipped to degrade a wide variety of dietary fiber, you're more likely to respond positively to it.
[00:25:52] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: If you have a very depleted gut microbiome, you're not as likely to be able to respond to it.
[00:25:57] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And thinking back to that experiment that we talked about before with the multi-generational loss of fiber fermenting microbes in mice that were fed a Western diet, it may be that many of us in the industrialized world have a microbiome that's so depleted now that even if we consume a high fiber diet, at least for a short period of time, we don't have the right microbes in our gut to degrade that fiber.
[00:26:21] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And this has actually been observed by other groups, beautiful study out of University of Minnesota, looking at immigrants coming to the United States.
[00:26:29] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And within nine months, but certainly over the course of years, immigrants that come here lose a lot of the diversity in their gut microbiome, but a lot of the fiber degrading capacity in their gut microbiome too.
[00:26:42] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So it could be that over time, this becomes a one way street, and it's hard for us to recover the microbes that actually can degrade the fiber.
[00:26:51] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And I think that this probably intersects with sanitation in our environment and the fact that we don't have access to new microbes that might help us degrade the fiber that we actually have lost these microbes in some ways irrecoverable without deliberate reintroduction of fiber degrading microbes.
[00:27:09] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Well, you have children, do you encourage them to interact with pets and dirt and stuff in the environment provided that stuff wasn't immediately toxic?
[00:27:19] Andrew Huberman: Exactly. Certainly just with infectious diseases in general, it's really important to be aware of the possibility for compromising your health through the spread of germs.
[00:27:29] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so that is just hand washing is important and we have to be careful with the spread of germs.
[00:27:36] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But I do think that the sanitization of our environment has gone overboard with the various things being impregnated with antibiotics, shopping carts and things like that and tooth brushes.
[00:27:53] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And it's like antibiotics and things for killing microbes are everywhere.
[00:28:00] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And when we were raising, when our daughters were young and we were making these decisions, the calculations that we would make were really one, how likely are they to encounter a disease causing microbe?
[00:28:15] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: If we've been out on a hike or in our garden, just kind of working in the dirt or whatever, maybe it's not as important to wash your hands before you have lunch, even if there's a little bit of dirt on them.
[00:28:25] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: If they've been in a public playground where maybe there's other kids with germs or maybe even chemicals like pesticides and herbicides that are being used, maybe it's more important than to wash your hands.
[00:28:38] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Certainly if you've been in the grocery store or on the subway, probably a good idea to wash your hands.
[00:28:44] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So I think you really need to think about kind of the context of it.
[00:28:48] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Exposure to microbes from the environment is likely an important part of educating our immune system and keeping the proper balance in our immune system.
[00:28:58] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And it's just a matter of figuring out the right way to do that safely.
[00:29:02] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: What's the thought about probiotics for the typical person that's not recovering from a round of antibiotics that has been prescribed them?
[00:29:10] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So I think the first thing to say is buyer beware because it's a supplement market, it's largely unregulated.
[00:29:16] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And that means that there are a lot of bad products out there and a lot of products that even though they're not intended to be bad, just don't have great quality control.
[00:29:26] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: There have been several studies that have taken over the counter, just kind of off the shelf, probiotics, surveyed what's in there based on sequencing, and shown that what is in there does not match what's on the label.
[00:29:41] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So there are places that probiotic companies can send their product to have it independently validated.
[00:29:47] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So you want to look for that sort of validation on a product.
[00:29:51] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: There also are names that are just very well known and you know, it's, you know, their reputations are on the line.
[00:30:01] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So they probably invest a little bit more in quality control than maybe some of the other lesser known names because there's such a huge range of products.
[00:30:09] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And because each person is their own little caper when it comes to the microbiome, it's really hard to know whether there are great products for a given indication.
[00:30:20] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And the really good advice that I've heard is try to find a study that supports in, you know, a really well designed study.
[00:30:28] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And this is very hard for people who aren't scientists to evaluate.
[00:30:31] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But so, you know, if you're experiencing a medical problem or want to consult a doctor, that might be helpful.
[00:30:38] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But finding a study where a specific probiotic has successfully done whatever it is you're looking for, and then sticking with that probiotic is really the best recipe for as a place to start in the world.
[00:30:49] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And what about prebiotics? Is there a number of reasons why I can imagine that prebiotics would be beneficial?
[00:30:57] The studies that have been done on prebiotics, the, it's really kind of a mixed bag of results.
[00:31:05] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And there have been studies done with purified fibers where you actually see microbiota diversity plummet over the course of the study because you get a very specific bloom in a small number of bacteria that are good at using that one type of fiber.
[00:31:20] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And that's at the expense of all the other microbes that are in the gut.
[00:31:23] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so, so it's really hard to replicate with purified fiber or what you'd get, for instance, at a salad bar in terms of the array of complex carbohydrates that you would be exposing your microbiota to.
[00:31:35] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And I think the kind of broad view of this in the field is that consuming a broad variety of plants is, and all the diverse fiber that comes with that is probably better in fostering diversity in your microbiota.
[00:31:52] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Then purified fibers now there are again, a lot of people who benefit from purified fibers either for GI motility or for other aspects of GI health problems that they've been experiencing.
[00:32:05] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Again, I think it's a type of thing where you have to try to find the thing that that's right for you.
[00:32:10] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But there are also our studies that suggest that if you layer rapidly for menable fibers on top of a Western diet, you actually can result in weird metabolism happening in your liver because you have this incredibly rapid fermentation of fiber along with a lot of fat coming into the system.
[00:32:32] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: At least that's the theory. And in a mouse study that was published a few years ago, they actually see that a subset of the mice develop hepatocelular carcinoma when they're fed a high dose prebiotic liver cancer on top of on top of a Western diet.
[00:32:49] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So whether that's representative of human biology, we don't know.
[00:32:53] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: But purified fibers are definitely very different both in terms of the diversity of structures, but also in terms of how rapidly they're fermented in the gut because if you are eating plants, the complex structures, they're really slow the microbes down in terms of fermentation and you end up with a slow rate of fermentation over the length of your colon as opposed to this big burst of fermentation that can happen if you eat something that is highly soluble and easily accessed.
[00:33:22] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: So you've covered a tremendous amount of information and I'm incredibly grateful where can people find out more about the work that you're doing. We can certainly provide links and you have a book on this topic. So could you tell us about the book where we can learn more about the Saunenberg lab and the work that you're doing.
[00:33:37] Andrew Huberman: Maybe people will even try and enroll in some of these studies.
[00:33:40] Andrew Huberman: Yeah, so Eric and my wife and I wrote a book called The Good Gut and that that really was a response to how we were changing our lives in response to to being in the field being very familiar with the research.
[00:33:55] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Seeing that a lot of our friends that weren't studying the got microbiome, but were very well informed many of them scientists were not doing the same things we were doing.
[00:34:03] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And it was very clear that it was just the lack of information funneling out of the field to other people.
[00:34:11] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And so we wanted to make that accessible to people who are not microbiome scientists.
[00:34:16] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And then in terms of kind of connecting with our research, certainly there's the Center for Human Microbiome Studies at Stanford, which is kind of our home base for doing a lot of these dietary interventions.
[00:34:26] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: We list the studies there, give more information on what we're doing. And then we have a lab website too that people can go to and read more about our research.
[00:34:34] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: And we're always looking for participants for our studies.
[00:34:36] Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: Thank you so much for your time and for the work you do. And I hope we can do it again.
[00:34:40] Andrew Huberman: Thanks Andrew. This was a great conversation.
