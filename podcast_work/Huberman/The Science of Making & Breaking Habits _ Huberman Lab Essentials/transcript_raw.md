[00:00:00] Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_00: science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:11] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17] Today we're talking all about habits. In particular, we're going to discuss the biology
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_00: of habit formation and the biology of how we break habits. Habits are things that our nervous
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_00: system learned, but not always consciously. Sometimes we develop habits that we're not even aware of
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: until they become a problem, or maybe they serve us well. Who knows? But the fact of the matter is
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_00: that habits are a big part of who we are. In fact, it's estimated that up to 70% of our waking
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: behavior is made up of habitual behavior. So if habits are largely learned consciously or unconsciously,
[00:00:54] we have to ask ourselves what is learning? Well, learning is neuroplasticity.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: Neuroplasticity is simply the process by which our nervous system changes in response to experience.
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_00: But at the end of the day, neuroplasticity is about forming new neural circuits, new pathways by
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: which certain habits are likely to occur, and other ones are less likely to occur. As many of you
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: are well aware, there are popular books about habits and there's a whole psychological literature
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_00: about habits. And those two areas point to some very interesting aspects of habits that I think
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_00: are worth mentioning. First of all, is this notion of immediate goal-based habits versus identity-based
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: habits. Immediate goal-based habits are going to be habits that are designed to bring you a specific
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_00: outcome as you do them, so each and every time you do them. So maybe you're somebody that wants to
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_00: get more of zone two cardio, for instance. That would be an immediate goal-based habit. If your
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_00: goal is to get that cardio maybe four times a week, every time you do it, you could check off a
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_00: little box and you'd say, okay, I did it, you met the goal. That is different than so-called
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_00: identity-based habits where there's a larger overarching theme to the habit where you're trying to
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: become, quote-unquote, a fit person, or you're somebody who wants to be an athlete or something of
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: that sort. It's where you start to attach some sort of larger picture about yourself or what it
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: means for you to do that habit where there's both the immediate goal, complete the exercise,
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: complete the session, or whatever it is. Check off that box, but that you're linking it to some
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: sort of larger goal. Another thing that you'll hear out there in the literature is that it takes
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: 21 days to form a habit. Some people say 18, some people say 21, some people say 30 days, some people
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_00: say 60 days. So which one is it? Does it depend on the habit that one is trying to form, or does it
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: depend on the person that's trying to form the habit? It turns out that there's excellent peer-review
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_00: data on this. There's a study published in 2010 first author Lallie LLY. This study found that for
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: the same habit to be formed, it can take anywhere from 18 days to as many as 254 days
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: for different individuals to form that habit. So for those of you listening, some of you might be
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: thinking, I can't believe that it would take some people 254 days to get into that habit. But as I
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: said, people are highly variable. And if you can't form one habit easily, it doesn't mean that you
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: can't form other habits easily. The mystery of why certain people can form certain habits more
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: easily than others probably has something to do with how well people manage what's called limbic
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_00: friction. Now limbic friction is not a term that you're going to find in the formal
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: neurobiological literature or even psychological literature. It's frankly a term that I coined to
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: encompass a number of different pieces of the psychology and neuroscience literature.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: limbic friction is a shorthand way that I use to describe the strain that's required in order to
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_00: overcome one of two states within your body. One state is one of anxiousness where you're really
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_00: anxious. And therefore, you can't calm down. You can't relax. And therefore, you can't engage
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_00: in some particular activity or thought pattern that you would like. The other state is one in which
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: you're feeling too tired or lazy or not motivated. Both of those states feeling too alert and too
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: calm, if you will, relate to the function of the so-called autonomic nervous system, a set of neurons
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_00: and hormones and chemicals in your brain and body that act as sort of a seesaw. You're either
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_00: alert or calm. You're either asleep or stressed. Those two states are not compatible with one
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_00: another. You've probably heard of wired and tired, but that's really once you've been very stressed
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_00: for a long time to the point where you're exhausted. What does the autonomic nervous system have to do
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_00: with any of this? Well, limbic friction is a phrase that can be used to describe how much
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: effort, how much activation energy you need in order to engage in a particular behavior. A lot of
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: habit formation has to do with being in the right state of mind and being able to control your
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: state of body and mind. So as we march forward, what you're going to find is that this phrase or this
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: term limbic friction is going to be a useful metric or way for you to touch in with yourself
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_00: and address whether or not you are likely to be able to form a certain habit easily or whether
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_00: or not it's going to be very challenging. And I'm going to teach you a way to measure your degree
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_00: of limbic friction. That is how much activation energy it will take in order for you to execute
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_00: a new habit. And I'm going to teach you how to measure your limbic friction and activation
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_00: energy for how likely it is that you're going to be able to break a habit that you don't want to have.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_00: The other key concept for us to address that's really mainly found in the books and articles out
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_00: there about habits is this notion of what I call linchpin habits. Linchpin habits are certain habits
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: that make a lot of other habits easier to execute. Now, the sorts of linchpin habits that I'm
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_00: referring to are always going to be things that you enjoy doing. I'll just give you an example
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: from my life. I happen to like exercise, not all forms of exercise, but I happen to like resistance
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_00: training and I happen to like running. And for reasons that I'll get into a little bit later,
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_00: I place those activities typically early in the day because of the neurochemistry and the various
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_00: types of hormones, et cetera, that are associated with performing those activities. But I really
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_00: place those activities under the umbrella of what I call linchpin habits. Why? Because those
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_00: particular habits are easy to execute because I enjoy them. But they also make a lot of other
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: habits easier to execute. Things like being alert for work, things like making sure that I get
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_00: good sleep the night before, things like hydration, things like making sure that I eat the foods that
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_00: are better for me than maybe some of the other foods that I would more reflexively reach to if I
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: weren't doing that training. So certain habits act as linch pins, meaning that they shift a lot of
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: other things. They can control and bias the likelihood that in this case you or me will perform
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: other habits that are harder to access that we have less of an affinity for. So again, there's
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: three concepts that we need to include here. We've got identity-based versus goal-based habits.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: We've got the concept that different habits take different periods of time to adopt depending on
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_00: the person and the habit and that there are these what I call linchpin habits. Certain habits that
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_00: make other habits easier to execute and those linchpin habits always, always, always are things
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_00: that we enjoy doing. So now I'd like to shift to thinking about a particular aspect of habits.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_00: And that's habit strength. Habit strength is measured by two main criteria. The first is how context
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_00: dependent a given habit is. So context dependence is if you go from one environment to the next,
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: do you tend to do the same thing in the same way at the same time of day? So for instance,
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_00: brushing your teeth first thing in the morning, maybe some of you do that before breakfast, maybe
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_00: some of you do that later, maybe some of you like me don't even eat breakfast. But when I travel,
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: I tend to brush my teeth at more or less the same time of day relative to when I wake up as I do
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: when I'm at home. So it's context independent. So it's a very strong habit. The other aspect of
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_00: habit strength is how much limbic friction is required to perform that habit on a regular basis.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_00: This is extremely important because if you were in the process of building habits and consolidating
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: those habits, then it's probably going to take more limbic friction to execute those habits.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_00: So these two aspects, context dependence, whether or not you're likely to do the thing,
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: regardless of where you are, right, on travel at home, on vacation with people around, not people
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: around, etc. And how much limbic friction is required to execute that habit will tell you whether
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: not that habit is deeply or just shallowly embedded within your nervous system. The goal of any
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_00: habit that we want to form is to get into what's called automaticity. Automaticity is fancy language
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: for the neural circuits can perform it automatically and that's the ultimate place to be.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_00: So what I'd like to do is to take the scientific literature of how the nervous system learns and
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_00: engages in neuroplasticity and apply that to habit formation, habit maintenance, and if so desired,
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_00: how to break particular habits. I'd like to give you a particular tool that's gleaned from the
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_00: research psychology literature. I should mention that I learned about this from an excellent
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_00: review article that's available online. It's called Psychology of Habit. The authors are Wendy
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_00: Wood and Dennis Runger. This is published in annual review of psychology. They're talking about
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: the various ways that habits form in the nervous system and they mention with each repetition
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: of a habit, small changes occur in the cognitive and neural mechanisms associated with procedural
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: memory. Procedural memory is holding in mind the specific sequence of things that need to happen
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: in order for a particular outcome to occur. Let's say I want to get into the habit of making myself
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_00: or someone else in my household a cup of espresso every morning. I would actually think through
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_00: each of those steps, walk into the kitchen, turn on the espresso machine, draw the espresso,
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_00: walking through each of those steps from start to finish and turns out just that simple mental
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_00: exercise done once can shift people toward a much higher likelihood of performing that habit
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_00: regularly, not just the first time, but as they continue out into the days and weeks that follow.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: So this procedural stepping through of the steps of the recipe or the series of action steps that
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_00: are involved in sitting down to study and writing for an hour or generating exercise, whatever it is
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_00: the habit that you're trying to learn. When you're doing that exercise, it sets in motion the same
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_00: neurons that are going to be required for the execution of that habit. And so when you actually show
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: up to perform that habit, it's as if the dominoes fall more easily. It's a lower threshold as we
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_00: say in order to get the habit to perform. So for those of you that just want to be more habitual about
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_00: certain things, be able to perform certain things more reflexively that you would like in your life,
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: simply take the time, do it once, maybe twice and just sit down, close your eyes if you like,
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_00: and just step through the procedure of what it's going to take in order to perform that habit.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_00: The psychology literature, as I mentioned, and also the neuroscience literature
[00:11:15] strongly supports the fact that it is going to make it far easier for you to adopt and maintain
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: that habit. So now I'd like to discuss a second and what I think is perhaps the most powerful tool
[00:11:26] for being able to acquire and stick to new habits. The tool that I'm referring to is something
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_00: called task bracketing. We have in our brain a set of neural circuits that fall under the umbrella
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: term of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are involved in action execution, meaning doing
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: certain things and action suppression, not doing certain things. In the experimental realm,
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_00: these are referred to as go, meaning do or no go, don't do certain things. So it turns out that
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_00: there's an area of our basal ganglia called the dorsal lateral striatum. It's very important
[00:12:01] for the establishment of behaviors that are associated with the habit, but not necessarily the
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_00: habit itself. And beautiful studies in both animals and humans that record the electrical activity
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_00: in the dorsal lateral striatum find that the dorsal lateral striatum is associated, meaning
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: it becomes active at the beginning of a particular habit and at the very end and after a particular
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_00: habit. Hence the phrase task bracketing, it brackets the habit. Now this is very important because
[00:12:33] task bracketing is what underlies whether or not a habit will be context dependent or not.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_00: Whether or not it will be strong and likely to occur even if we didn't get a good night's
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_00: sleep the night before, even if we're feeling distracted, even if we are not feeling like doing
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_00: something emotionally or if we are completely overwhelmed by other events. If the neural circuits
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_00: for task bracketing are deeply embedded in us, meaning they are very robust around a particular
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_00: habit, well then it's likely that we're going to go out for that zone two cardio no matter what,
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: that we're going to brush our teeth no matter what. In fact, brushing our teeth is a pretty good
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: example because for most people, even if you got a terrible night's sleep, even if everything in
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_00: your life is going wrong, chances are, unless you're very depressed, if you're going to leave to work
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_00: or even if you're not, that you're going to still carry out the behavior of brushing your teeth in
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_00: the morning. I would hope so actually, but you are probably less likely to perform particular habits
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_00: that are not what you deem as necessary, but if you think about it, brushing your teeth,
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_00: exercise, eating particular foods, maybe engaging socially in particular ways,
[00:13:42] you are the one that places any kind of value assessment on which ones are essential and which
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_00: ones are negotiable. So task bracketing sets a neural imprint, a kind of a fingerprint in your
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: brain of this thing has to happen at this particular time of day, so much so that it's reflexive.
[00:13:59] And as we'll talk about in a moment, there's a way that you can build up task bracketing,
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_00: so that regardless of what it is you're trying to learn, there's a much higher probability that you're
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_00: going to do that thing. When I say learn, meaning, let's say you're trying to acquire a habit that
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_00: for you is really challenging. Maybe it's that you're going to write for an hour a day on a book
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_00: project that you've been thinking about or you're going to work on mathematics or you're going to
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_00: do any sort of thing that for you, there's a lot of limbic friction. While it is important to think
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: about the sequence of events that would be required in order to engage in that behavior, that
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_00: procedural memory visualization exercise we talked about before, that will help. There is a way also
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: that you can orient your nervous system toward this task bracketing process so that your nervous
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_00: system is shifted or oriented towards the execution of a given habit. So this is sort of like warming
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_00: up your body to exercise. When the dorsal lateral striatum is engaged, your body and your brain are
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_00: primed to execute a habit and then you get to consciously insert which habit you want to perform.
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_00: So in order to leverage the neural mechanisms of task bracketing in order to increase the
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_00: likelihood that you're going to perform a particular habit, I have to break it to you that one
[00:15:12] thing that you've probably heard over and over about habit formation is not true. And what I'm
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: referring to is this idea that if you are very specific about exactly when you're going to perform
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_00: a particular habit that you are more likely to perform that habit. And while that is true in
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_00: the short term, it is not true in the long term. And the reason for that is that our nervous system
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_00: tends to generate particular kinds of behaviors based not on time but on our state, meaning what
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_00: level of activation is taking place in our brain and body. How much focus we happen to have? How fatigued
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_00: we are? How energized we are? So while schedules are important, it's not that specific time of day
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_00: per se that's going to allow you to get into a habit and form that habit and consolidate that habit.
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_00: Rather, it's the state that your brain and body are in that's important to anchor yourself to.
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: And so now I'm going to present a very straightforward but neurobiologically grounded program by which
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_00: you can insert particular types of habits that you want to perform at particular phases of the day,
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_00: not times of day, but in particular phases of the day because it turns out that particular phases of
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: the day are associated with particular biological underpinnings, chemicals and neural circuits and so
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_00: forth. It involves dividing the 24 hour days into what I call three phases. The first is phase one,
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_00: which is zero to eight hours after waking up, approximately. The second phase is the nine to 14,
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_00: maybe 15 hours after you wake up. And the third phase is 16 to 24 hours after waking up. So we've
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: taken the 24 hour cycle, we've carved it up into three phases, phase one, phase two and phase three.
[00:17:00] Phase one, which again is zero to eight hours after waking, has a particular neurochemical signature.
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: Regardless of what you do, the neuromodulators, nor epinephrine, as well as epinephrine,
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_00: so that's noradrenaline and adrenaline, as well as the neuromodulator dopamine, tend to be elevated
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_00: during that first zero to eight hours after waking. But in that first phase, your whole system is
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_00: action and focus oriented. And we know that when your action and focus oriented and because of the
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_00: neurochemicals that are naturally released into your brain and body, that you will be more likely
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: to overcome any limbic friction that stands in the way of performing particular habits. So as you
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_00: list out or think about the various habits that you'd like to adopt in your life,
[00:17:48] take the habits for which you know there's the highest degree of limbic friction. They are the
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_00: hardest for you to engage in. They require the most activation energy and put those in this zero to
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_00: eight hours after waking. This will greatly facilitate your performance of those new habits. By placing
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_00: them in this broader window of zero to eight hours after waking, what you're doing is you're creating
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_00: task bracketing. You're making it such that your nervous system will predict when you are going to
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_00: lean in against limbic friction in order to perform particular types of habits.
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_00: Phase two, as I mentioned, is about, again, these aren't specifics, but about nine to 14 or 15
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: hours after waking. During this phase of the day, because of the circadian shifts in our biology,
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_00: dopamine and oripanephrine and cortisol are starting to taper down just naturally. And a different
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_00: neuromodulator, serotonin is starting to rise. Serotonin is definitely going to be highest in this
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_00: second half of the day and tends to lends itself to a more relaxed state of being. There are certain
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: things that we all can and should do during this phase two of each day that lend themselves to a
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: state of mind and a state of body that is going to be beneficial for the generation and consolidation
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_00: of certain types of habits. What are those things? First of all, as the day goes on, you should try if
[00:19:15] you can to start tapering the amount of really bright light that you're getting, unless it's sunlight,
[00:19:21] talked about this before on the podcast, but if you haven't heard, viewing the sun as it's what we
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: call low solar angle so as it's headed toward the horizon, but getting some sunlight in your
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: eyes in the second half of the day can also be beneficial for a number of brain systems and
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_00: psychological systems. Things like heat and sauna, hot baths, hot showers, those are terrific
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_00: things to do in the second half of the day. They tend to support this serotonergic or high
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_00: serotonin-like state and lend themselves to more calm and relaxation. Basically, this phase two of
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: the day is one in which you're alert, you are present, you are working, you are engaging socially,
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_00: you're cooking dinner, probably paying attention to a number of things, but you should really be
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: trying to taper off your stress level. So how do you leverage phase two of the day for habit formation?
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: Well, given what we know about the neurochemistry of learning and memory, given what we know about
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_00: task formation and its reliance on certain forms of neuroplasticity, the second half of the day
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_00: is a terrific time to take on habits and things that you're already doing that require very little
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: override of limbic friction. So these might be things that you could categorize in common terms
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_00: as kind of mellower activities. It might be journaling. It might be that you already are performing
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_00: music or I should say practicing music regularly or you're trying to learn a language, something
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_00: that's a little bit challenging, but doesn't require a ton of energy in order to override that limbic
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_00: friction. One of the hallmark features of those basal ganglia circuits for go and no go is that
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_00: they are associated with certain neurochemicals, dopamine and serotonin, acetylcholine and other
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_00: neurochemicals. And by placing particular habits, at particular phases of the day, those neurochemical
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_00: states start to be associated with the leaning in and the process of beginning and as I mentioned,
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: ending those particular habits. And in doing so, they shift the whole nervous system toward being
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: able to predict that certain things are going to happen at particular times of day, that you're going
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_00: to be leaning very hard against limbic friction early in the day in phase one and that you're going
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_00: to be doing things that require less conscious override of limbic friction in phase two. And in doing so,
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_00: set up this task bracketing system so that the individual habits that you're learning or that
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_00: you're trying to learn have a much greater probability of being executed and consolidated,
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_00: meaning that pretty soon they will just naturally become reflexive. Phase three of the 24-hour
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_00: schedule runs from about 16 to 24 hours after waking. During that period of time, there are a few
[00:21:55] things that are going to support being in a state of mind, state of body that are going to allow
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_00: neuroplasticity to occur, that are going to allow the rewiring that you triggered during the waking
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_00: part of the day to actually take place. Those things are very low to no light, meaning keeping your
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_00: environment very dark or very, very dim. I don't think it's necessary to sleep in a room that's
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: complete blackness, but for most people, keeping the room dark and keeping the room temperature low
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_00: is very beneficial for getting and staying in deep sleep. A lot of people recommend putting a gap
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_00: between your final bite of food and when you go to sleep at night, some people will say that gap
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_00: should be four hours. Other people say two hours. If you're me, I generally have something I don't
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_00: know within two hours or 90 minutes of going to sleep, but it's not a big meal, but that's just me,
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_00: and I fall asleep and stay asleep fine with that. What if you wake up the way I've cast face
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_00: three is that you're supposed to be in this deep slumber. You're not supposed to wake up at all.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_00: You're supposed to be in low light and your brain is rewiring and those habits are getting consolidated,
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_00: etc. Well, if you're like me, you probably get up once in the middle of the night,
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_00: perfectly normal, but a lot of people have trouble falling back asleep. Very important, if you get
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_00: up in the middle of the night to use a minimum of light in order to navigate your surroundings,
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_00: just as much as you need in order to safely do so, because light inhibits the hormone melatonin,
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_00: can make it very hard to fall back asleep if you inhibit melatonin. Again, neuroplasticity
[00:23:20] SPEAKER_00: is the basis of habit formation and neuroplasticity and the rewiring of neural circuits happens in
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_00: these states of deep sleep. If you're not obeying this phase three, if you're not giving phase three,
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_00: the materials it needs and you're not avoiding the certain things like caffeine and bright light
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_00: and stress during phase three, you're simply not going to be able to build those habits that you've
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_00: been working so hard to trigger in phase one and phase two of the day. I fully acknowledge that
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_00: many of the things that I've listed out here are things that I've encouraged people to do in
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere, but really this is about habit formation and the
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: whole reason for placing particular types of behaviors at particular phases of the day is to set
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_00: a framework for that task bracketing. Again, task bracketing and those circuits of the basal ganglia
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_00: indicate that it's not just the neural circuits that are engaged by the task itself,
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_00: but the neural circuits that are engaged before and after that task execution. That's what gets
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_00: consolidated. So when you do things at particular phases of the day under particular conditions of
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_00: neurochemistry, what you're doing is you're giving the brain a very predictable set of sequences that
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_00: during sleep, it can start to put into your hard drive, if you will. It can really program it into
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_00: your nervous system so that within a short period of time, hopefully within 18 or maybe even six
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_00: days or who knows, maybe even fewer days, you'll find that executing those behaviors is very,
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_00: very straightforward for you and that you won't have to feel so much limbic friction or override so
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_00: much limbic friction. Some of you are probably asking, okay, if I perform a particular habit
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_00: during phase one and then I do other habits during phase two and I eventually get to the point
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_00: where I'm engaging in those habits in a pretty effortless way. Do I keep them in the same phase of
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_00: the day? And the good news is the literature says it doesn't matter and in fact moving that particular
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_00: habit around somewhat randomly can actually be beneficial to you because actually moving it from
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_00: one time a day to the other is that context independence that we really are seeking by
[00:25:35] being able to do the same thing that we want to do regardless of time of day or circumstances,
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_00: that's how we know that we've achieved a real habit formation. That's how we know that the habit
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_00: has been moved into certain components of our neural circuitry that just allows to do it what
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_00: seems like reflexively, although earlier I pointed out that these aren't reflexes in the traditional
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_00: sense. The reason for that is that this brain area, the hippocampus that many of you know, is
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_00: associated with learning and memory, is not actually where memories are stored. The hippocampus is
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_00: where memories are formed. It's where procedures, like I talked about before, procedural memory of how
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_00: you're going to execute a particular sequence where that's maintained. So that whole process of
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_00: really leaning into something that's hard, then it becoming easier and then eventually that thing
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_00: becoming more or less reflexive involves a migration of the information in the brain.
[00:26:25] And once it's migrated out to a different location in the brain, at that point it's achieved
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_00: context independence. It doesn't have to be bracketed by your caffeine and your lunch. It doesn't
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_00: have to occur immediately after your afternoon NSDR, but before your four o'clock meeting on Zoom or
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_00: something of that sort. So all this is to say that once something has become reflexive, you should
[00:26:51] play with it a little bit about time of day. If you want to keep it in the same phase of day,
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_00: great. But if you one day decide you're going to exercise in the afternoon, next day, you decide
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_00: you're going to exercise in the morning and that's the habit that you're concerned with, that's
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_00: terrific. If you're able to do that, that means that it's truly achieved context independence. It
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_00: means that you have officially formed that habit. And as I mentioned earlier, much earlier at the
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_00: beginning of the episode, the strength of a habit is dictated by how much limbic friction,
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_00: that was one, and how much context dependence there is. So when it doesn't take much
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_00: activation energy to get into the execution of that habit, and you can do it in any context,
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_00: well, then you have formed a habit. Way back at the beginning of the episode, I promised to you that
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_00: I would deliver two programs that are geared towards habit formation. And I promised that I would give
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_00: you ways in which you could gauge whether or not certain habits had moved from high effort,
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_00: what I call high limbic friction to reflexive. In researching this episode, I found a tremendous
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_00: number of different systems for habit formation. I want to spell out a particular system that I
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_00: think could be very useful to most, if not all people, that's rooted in the biology of habit formation,
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_00: rooted in the psychology of habit formation. And that is entirely compatible with that phase one,
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_00: phase two, phase three type program that I talked about earlier. But encompasses a bit of a longer
[00:28:16] SPEAKER_00: time scale and really arrives at a kind of a system, if you will, for how to build in habits. And so
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_00: this is at least for sake of this example, a 21-day system. I picked 21 days because that seems
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_00: to be the average or most typical system for engaging neural plasticity as it relates to the formation
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_00: of new habits. So basically what this involves is you set out to perform six new habits per day
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_00: across the course of 21 days. The idea is you write down six things that you would like to do
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_00: every day for 21 days. However, the expectation is that you'll only complete four to five of those
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_00: each day. Okay. So built into this is a kind of permission to fail, but it's not failure because
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_00: it turns out that this approach to forming habits is based not so much on the specific habits that
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_00: you're trying to form, but the habit of performing habits, right? It's the habit of doing a certain
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_00: number of things per day. So you set out to perform six. Now, another reason for not necessarily
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_00: performing all six is that some activities probably shouldn't be performed each day. For instance,
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_00: in my case, if I were to weight train or even run every day, I'm of the sort or my biology is
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_00: of the sort that I don't recover so well. So I wouldn't want to do resistance training every day,
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_00: but I might want to do it four days a week, for instance. So by having six things in that list,
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_00: it could shuffle out that particular activity on particular days of the week and simply do four or
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_00: five other activities. If you miss a day, meaning you don't perform four to five things, there is no
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_00: punishment. And in fact, it's important that you don't actually try and do what in the literature is
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_00: called a habit slip compensation, which is just fancy psychological language for if you screw up and
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_00: you don't get all four or five in one day, you don't do eight the next day in order to compensate.
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_00: After 21 days, you stop engaging in this 21 day deliberate four to five things per day type schedule.
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: And you simply go into autopilot. You ask yourself how many of those particular habits that I was
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_00: deliberately trying to learn in the previous 21 days are automatically incorporated into my schedule.
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_00: How many of them am I naturally doing? In other words, every 21 days, you don't update and start
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_00: adding new habits. You're simply going to assess how well, how deeply you've rewired your nervous
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_00: system to be able to perform those six habits of the previous 21 days. Many people are trying to
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_00: cram so many new behaviors into their nervous system that they don't stand a chance of learning all
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_00: those behaviors. What you may find is that you kept up two of those things very consistently throughout
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_00: the 21 days. And perhaps there was one of them that you did sporadically and that there were three
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_00: others that frankly, you didn't manage to execute. You may also be one of these people, one of these
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_00: mutants that sets out to do six new things per day for 21 days and performs every single one of them.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_00: Terrific. More power to you. In that case, for the following 21 days, let's see whether or not you can
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_00: continue to perform those very same six things every day for 21 days. And then and only then would you
[00:31:33] SPEAKER_00: want to add more habits in. So you could repeat this 21 day process, you know, 21 days of new habit,
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_00: 21 days of testing those new habits as whether or not they're reflexive or not. The idea is that this
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: isn't something that you're doing all year long. It's that you perhaps starting the new year or
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_00: regardless of when you're listening to this, you set out to make that 21 day really the stimulus
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_00: period in which the habits get wired in. And then the following month and maybe even the following
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_00: months or periods of 21 days are really that kind of thermometer or the test bed of how well you've
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_00: embedded those particular habits. And if indeed you want to continue to add new habits or you find
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_00: that certain habits that you weren't able to embed in your nervous system and make reflexive,
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_00: you want to then bring those in fantastic. But it's only once you've achieved all those six habits
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_00: as reflexive that you would move forward. And the fact that habit slips missing of particular habits
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_00: and not doing all six is kind of built into the system. I think makes it a very reasonable one.
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_00: It's very adaptable to the real world. And I think it's one that provided you obey the phase one,
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_00: phase two, phase three type system that we talked about earlier. If you do that, and I think there's
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_00: a very high probability that the habits that you try and form will achieve this context dependence
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_00: and that it will take progressively less and less limbic friction to perform them. Thus far,
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_00: we've almost exclusively been discussing how to form habits. But what about breaking habits?
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_00: Certainly many people out there would like to break habits that they feel don't serve them well.
[00:32:59] One of the challenges in breaking habits is that many habits occur very, very quickly. And so there
[00:33:04] isn't an opportunity to intervene until the habit has already been initiated. And in some cases,
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_00: completed. So it turns out that the key to generating long-term depression in these pathways is actually
[00:33:18] to take the period immediately following the bad habit execution. And in that moment,
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_00: capture the sequence of events, not that led to the bad habit execution. But actually to take
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_00: advantage of the fact that the neurons that were responsible for generating that bad habit were
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_00: active a moment ago and to actually engage in a replacement behavior immediately afterward.
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_00: So let's give an example. Let's say you find yourself, you're trying to do focused work, you
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_00: pick up your phone, you're just a point in yourself for picking up your phone. You could of course
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_00: just put it down or you engage in the work behavior. But if you were good at that, then you probably
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_00: wouldn't have done it in the first place. And so what turns out to be very effective is to go
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_00: engage in some other positive habit. This has two major effects. The first one is you start to
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: link in time the execution of a bad behavior to this other good behavior. In other words, you start to
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_00: create a kind of a double habit that starts with a bad habit and then ends with a good habit.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_00: So as I mentioned before, this might seem counterintuitive. I think why would I want to reward the
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: execution of a bad habit with a good habit? I don't want to reward myself for the bad habit. But
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_00: really what you're trying to do is you're trying to change the nature of the neural circuits that are
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_00: firing so that you can rewrite the script for that bad habit. And so when people have applied this
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_00: kind of approach, it removes the need to have constant conscious awareness of one's own behavior
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_00: prior to that behavior, which is very, very difficult to achieve. Rather, what they find is that
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_00: they are able to engage in remapping of the neural circuits associated with bad habits in ways that
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_00: are very, very straightforward, right? Because you can always identify when you've done the thing you
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_00: don't want to do and then attack on to that something additional that's positive. Now,
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_00: the nature of that positive thing is important. You don't want it to be something that's very
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_00: hard to execute. You want it to be something that's positive and fairly easy to execute so that
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_00: you're not struggling all the time to insert this on top of this bad behavior. Whatever that bad
[00:35:24] behavior might happen to be. And of course, I want to acknowledge that breaking bad habits is
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_00: really hard. So today, we've covered a lot about the biology and psychology of habit formation and
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_00: habit breaking. My hope is that today, you've learned both the biological mechanisms and the practical
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_00: tools by which you can start to establish habits that for you, you deem adaptive, healthy,
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_00: and that are going to support you in your goals. And that you can start to dismantle some of the
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_00: habits that you find to be unhealthy or maladaptive for you and for your goals. And once again,
[00:35:56] I want to thank you for going on this journey of exploring the neuroscience and the psychology of
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_00: habit formation and habit breaking. I hope it supports you in your goals and last, but certainly not
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_00: least, thank you for your interesting science.
