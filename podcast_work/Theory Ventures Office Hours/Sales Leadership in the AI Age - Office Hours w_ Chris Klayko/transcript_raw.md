[00:00:00] Awesome. So kick things off. Let's talk about AI and how it's changed. I mean, you've
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_08: seen many different sales organizations. You built many different sales organizations
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_08: that an AI is meaningfully changing all of it. Maybe we can start at the core, which is
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_08: first it was a usage based model. And now we're in a place where AI is driving meaningful
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_08: changes in productivity. We had a conversation yesterday about usage
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_08: based billing. So you built a lot of these organizations. There's a pretty fundamental
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_08: difference in the way that you run a usage based billing sales org that a seat based
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_08: org. If we can start there. For sure. First off, thanks for having me. And likewise,
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_07: about the learning I'm looking forward to hearing the questions because I'll learn a lot
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_07: just from the questions alone, but hanging out with you guys afterwards. Yeah, usage, consumption.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_07: This is my 13th year in consumption. Yeah. So it's been a minute and it's shocking to me
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_07: that we don't have better systems of record at this point to manage consumption. I'm assuming
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_07: that many, if not all of you are in consumption style businesses. If not, I would, you know,
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_07: I kind of see it as the future of how it's going to work. I think perpetual licenses was
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_07: way back then, SaaS and now consumption. I think it's a very modern way, but it is a very
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_07: different. It's a very different motion as a whole. It's a lot of micro selling events
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_07: on the AEP part. It's a much different value exchange from the customer to the company.
[00:01:39] We have these. So at Databricks and actually at Google, you do a consumption based model
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_07: where you pay for just what you use, but there is still a commit motion with the customer.
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_07: It's an interesting first negotiation with companies that aren't used to buying consumption
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_07: because they're so used to getting discounts, being an enterprise, because they're guarding
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_07: against shelfware. In the SaaS world, you don't know exactly what you're in that need. So you buy
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_07: to the best of your ability. But in consumption, you get 100% value of what you consume.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_07: And so the discount, why are you giving a discount to begin with? Yeah, there's some economies
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_07: of scale, so some economic unit economics are deserved, but it's typically a much smaller discount
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_07: as a result. As for sales people, it's totally different. I have a saying, I have a few sayings
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_07: with my team and one of them is each of vegetables. What I mean by that or code of the gym, it's
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_07: in a SaaS world, you can go for 89 days not really doing anything from a sales standpoint on the 90th
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_07: day of the quarter, you can go do the big elephant deal and put your name up in lights and it's
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_07: all as good and you're like the hero that doesn't work in consumption. It compounds. If you don't
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_07: go, if you don't eat your vegetables every day or go to the gym, you can't go to the gym once
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_07: a quarter and come out ripped. You know what I mean? And so in consumption, you got to be on the
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_07: data, you got to be almost like a program manager or project manager. In fact, I have this like,
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_07: I subscribe to the Frank Slootman thought of no CS. I don't believe in CS. So that was a big change,
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_07: right? When he published that book, yeah, 10 years of customer success and then all of this,
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_08: and he comes into the snowflake leadership seat. And he said, there are four people around in
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_08: account. One of you is no longer necessary. And that changed a lot about the sales structure
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_08: because the account executives up until that point, they were always hunters and then it was kind
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_08: of past to the CS team to manage. And then if you eliminate the CS role, well, then at some point,
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_08: an A.E. was a book of business that's large enough to meet quota as an NDR that's great enough
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_08: to meet bookings, then they get to the place where they're not eating their vegetables. That's
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_08: right. So that's a trade. Yeah, it's a trade, but in a consumption based world, it's a core
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_07: responsibility of the rep, right? I mean, that's their job day in and day out to drive that consumption.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_07: Not to eat, you know, there's a saying in sales, don't confuse sales with implementation.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_07: That's like what an A.E. here hears because they don't have to deal with it. They go sell close
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_07: to deal, then they move on and somebody else has to win consumption. You can't choose that.
[00:04:30] You're on that account and you're going to be the one overseeing a lot of that program management
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_07: to get that thing implemented, whatever it is to make sure that value is constantly being
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_07: that five was there. So I don't really see the role of a CS.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_07: That's a Chris. Does that change the spec of the N.E.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_07: Yeah, for sure. I think in general, the spec of an A.E. has changed. I mean,
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_07: I think there's a technical argument that's required for account executives today.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_07: I just think they got to be way more data driven. In fact, I have this like little algebraic
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_07: formula. It's IQ plus EQ plus TQ, technical question. I think it's a critical component as a
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_07: as a seller because most of the people today have some sort of freemium model
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_07: that they or OSS we talked about as a way. So you've got to come in and you've got to add value
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_07: across multiple dimensions. The business side, you've got to be able to talk to about the value
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_07: of your product. But you also got to be able to differentiate from the technical side.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_07: Plus, you've got to be a GM of your business to look at all the data signals that are coming from
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_07: a consumption based business. So it's just a different makeup as a whole. I just I think
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_07: you still need people that have that charismatic ability, ability to navigate an organization,
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_07: have the relationships. But that can only get you so far now. I think that's gone
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_07: over those days. Okay, so I'm an A.E. I'm working in your org and I'm running a consumption
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_08: book of business. Does it feel like I'm managing a stock market portfolio where some of the accounts
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_08: are going up and some of them are going down and I'm living a minute to minute. Yes, I think
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_07: we bring everyone in at Databricks when we have someone join the company, we bring them in
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_07: to San Francisco many times here at the ferry building. And I get to beat them and talk to them,
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_07: you know, there's a bunch of executives that comes through. But I always tell them like,
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_07: hey, just so we're perfectly clear, I know sales, we've got a lot of adrenaline junkies and sales
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_07: because 50% of your comp is typically at risk. Consumptions boring and you just need to get your
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_07: head wrapped around it. Like it's wow, you're the tough left. Well, I mean, let's get it out of the
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_07: way right away, you know, but if you do the right things day in and day out, the results will be
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_07: there guaranteed. Like I'm a big believer of that on, you know, on the work ethic, the results,
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_07: the activity and the consumption will flow. But it is a very it is kind of a boring thing and that
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_07: you're managing a bunch of micro selling events projects and you never get, you have to as a leader
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_07: of a sales organization, as a consumption, you have to find time to recognize people because it's not
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_07: as obvious. There's no big selling endeavor that says I just closed a million dollar deal. It's like,
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_07: oh, you won a $3,000 workload, $3,000 a month, but that compounds and oh, you won another 5,000.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_07: I know it just so you got to find that way to incentivize reward, recognize. That's a little
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_07: different than what you had historically where it's so obvious. There's the leaderboard of the top
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_07: deals for the quarter. Yeah, it's a different kind of machine. It's a much more predictable. It,
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_08: I mean, or at least much more, it's long term. Yeah, it's just long term. I mean, the only thing that
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_07: that's kind of backwards, but if you do it right, if you're in a consumption based business, you need
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_07: to be consistently teaching in my business, at least, and I don't know how much this will resonate
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_07: with the folks here, but I'm always telling my team to go talk to their customers every 90 days
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_07: and offer up optimization opportunities. How do you spend less with me? And that's counterintuitive
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_07: to a sales rep who wants to go generate as much revenue as possible. But the construct here is,
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_07: if you go and you're proactive on that, then the next workload or use case comes my direction.
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_07: And it's a much, you build this inertia. And then you have that portfolio that, you know,
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_07: you're not dependent on that one deal that year. It's just you have inertia behind you in the
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_07: stickiness of the product and trust with the customer and they're getting value and it's just a
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_07: much better environment. Awesome. Any questions from the audience on this topic? Yeah, Mark.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_08: So I just repeat the question. Yeah, just for the video. Did you get rid of the AE and replace it
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_08: with this yes or forward deployed engineer, which is the you then do. Yeah, here's the problem.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_07: For what? Here's the answers for deployed engineer. What's the problem? I like, I have a
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_07: volunteer is an amazing job on that one. No, I don't, I don't think so. I think it's an it's an
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_07: and because you're still having to win workloads. So if you think of commit motion where you have
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_07: like a med pick inspection motion on a deal, I still run med pick, but I run it at use case levels.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_07: That's why I call micro selling events because like a use case or winning a workload still goes
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_07: through the same motion to get there. Like you're going to do your discovery at the pain point.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_07: You're going to go through some sort of evaluation technically. You're going to make sure it has
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_07: budget. You're going to get that thing signed off on as a project. It's the same general construct
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_07: of winning a deal. Now, the problem is you just don't hand it off and walk away. You you maintain it
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_07: and you in what I'm suggesting is every 90 days with my team at least, we we do the same
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_07: quarterly business reviews with our customers. So I mandate track diligently every 90 days and
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_07: each and meet with executive on that side. And I need you go through the status of the projects,
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_07: how they're tracking the concert budget, offer them optimizations and then go through the new
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_07: things that are on the road map. Databricks is a beautiful place and that we have new stuff every
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_07: 90 days on the on the road map. So it's quasi selling opportunity, check in opportunity, but there's
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_07: there's also we're talking about the business value at that time because if you're doing a
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_07: consumption and you're spending 10 grand a month, that might fly under the radar. But if all
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_07: the sudden you're getting to a hundred or a million dollars a month, you know, some thin ops person
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_07: or a CFO is going to go, why are we doing this? Can we do this with something else? And so every 90
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_07: days we're meeting with them and telling them, here's the value you're getting. Right? And oh,
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_07: I'm going to try to make us cost less, but I see these five other things we could do together.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_07: So you can get even more value on the platform.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_07: Keep, keep, keep, oh, go ahead.
[00:11:09] You talked a little bit about this like hunter, whether it's like,
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_09: they're not like about gate. I've always had this like a lot of advice for that,
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_09: be with the needs of higher hunters, farmers and that's either distinct people,
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_09: or point to eat the same person, but it sounds like you're with eat for these unicorn people that
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_09: you look the other way.
[00:11:29] So fair, you're always, if you're a farmer, so to speak, in your model, you're still looking for
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_07: new workloads. You're farming to find those new workloads within the given install base.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_07: We, and I'm a big believer in a delineation between the two roles of hunting and core. We call it
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_07: core farming, hunting is self expatatory. And the hunters go out and they land that very first workload
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_07: at that account. And account that had it was a zero dollar spender. They're now the cross
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_07: of threshold. We consider them installed, but that's their job. And then on an annual basis,
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_07: we migrate those over to a core. Yeah.
[00:12:11] So you're about to, like, the logo is basically staying with that core first. They don't just go
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_09: about, is our highest most on or the logo is, so you have a core rep that has a portfolio.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_07: Maybe if they're strat, they have one, if there's, you know, mid market or whatever,
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_07: they may have five to 10. They have their portfolio and we try to keep as much as we can that
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_07: connective tissue. Obviously, we're growing pretty dramatically. So it's hard, but the goal is to
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_07: keep the core relationships intact. The hunters are out there knocking down those new logos. And then
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_07: once a year, we turn them over. Chris, how do you set up the compensation structure in a model like
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_08: this, both the usage component and then what you talked about between hunting and core?
[00:12:55] Yeah. So at first, I'll start by saying there's no such thing as a perfect comp plan.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_07: They do that if you find one of those wrangled, I'd like to inspect it and see it.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_07: We are in a consumption world, you want to look at incremental revenue. So you snap a line at
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_07: the beginning of the year and you go, okay, this company is doing $100 and you're a new incremental
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_07: quota is 150. And so you're looking at that incremental revenue and you're compensating the team
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_07: on top of that. We today don't have any commit quota. So there's not a sales percent at Databricks
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_07: that owns or has a quota that has a commit period hard stuff. That keeps people focused on the
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_07: right thing and growing the account and being with them long term. We do play a spiff above and
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_07: beyond though. So we want certain enterprises will not start using your product unless they
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_07: have a contract in place. So you got to establish that and so there should be a reward for that.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_07: But on the consumption front, it's basically setting the baseline, figuring out what the growth is
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_07: and providing that out and then paying them on the incremental. On the AL front, it's a little different.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_07: It's like there's different ways to activate AL being activated in new logo. There's different ways
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_07: to land that. Yeah. Bill, I was asking about you taking respect for an AD today. I was listening to Chris
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_10: Degn and talking about fake and snow and they have changed respect of an SD quarter front sale
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_10: engineer, solution engineer. What's your take on the technical requirements for a solution?
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_07: It's a really interesting question right now. I think what I'm not sure how it's in all
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_07: shake out. I think vibe coding isn't a very unique role with the sales engineering effort.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_07: As well sales effort, I think you're going to see far richer prototyping happening than you have
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_07: historically, instead of having a demo built team, you're going to see SCAs basically or essays
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_07: or whatever. What did you call them? Solution engineers. SCAs play a far more active role in kind of
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_07: the POC or the creation of these demos as opposed to like the ACME corp that we all have with the
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_07: throw up and show up. I think it's going to be highly contextualized because vibe coding allows for
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_07: it. It's kind of cool to see at the end of the day, they're the technical side of the equation
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_07: and responsible for the technical win. Question in the back. Spencer gets you a microphone.
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_07: We have to repeat the questions. What does your exception reporting look like? When do you know
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_04: things are not like what do you look for to tell you things are not going right? Has anything changed
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_04: in this world? What's your dashboard? Yeah, it's a great question and you can, there's actually
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_07: a balance here that you have to find because there's too many. It can be too noisy.
[00:16:09] Exception. The way that I look at it is and I'll break it down the most simplest and then I can
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_07: get more granular if you like, but like on a consumption is the rep making their number from a
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_07: consumption? Yes, great. No, they're not making that over. Do they have pipeline? Yes. Okay,
[00:16:25] pipeline will usually lead to consumption over time. There will be a conversion. No, no pipeline.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_07: Do they have activity? Yes, well, usually activity will build to pipeline, pipeline will build
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_07: consumption. No activity. How's their training and enablement? Have they gone through and been
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_07: certified so to speak? I always find that people that don't have the pipeline and don't have the
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_07: activity is typically they're uncomfortable talking about the topic. They're not secure
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_07: in representing it either the content that we've given them isn't there. We haven't quite
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_07: fit, don't have product market fit and they're uncomfortable exploring. I kind of go down that
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_07: at a Colombo line of questioning. Yeah, yeah. I don't come from sales necessarily, so
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_04: charities are, forgive me if it's not the right question, but was it pretty not churn in this world?
[00:17:25] I churn would be what you're so NRR you you typically look at so if customer spends a dollar
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_07: today and then they spent a dollar 50 the following year like that's the growth of NRR if it's
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_07: below one then there's some form of churn there in consumption and on a commit deal it would be a
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_07: renewable rate. So if the renewable rate falls below. Chris, maybe we can start talking about how you
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_08: use AI within your team. Okay, right? So AISCR there's training mechanisms, coaching mechanisms.
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_08: We talked a little bit about vibe coding demos. What's working for you? What are you excited about?
[00:18:05] We use a lot of it on the top end of the funnel. I think it's helpful on building propensity
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_07: models, finding the right accounts, putting a point of view to get there, automating a lot of that,
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_07: making our XDR organization more effective. So we use a lot of that there. I find that it's okay,
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_07: it's not great. We use Clary as on the commit side of the business and there's a plenty of
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_07: equivalents out there. I think at this point, but they'll give you a deal score. I don't the
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_07: qualitative element of that is not great in my mind for AI. Yeah, they're looking at how many
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_07: activities or meetings and like a meeting with you to talk about a closed process and funding is
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_07: very different than just a bump in to someone in the hallway. But it scores at the same. So the
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_07: qualitative elements I still have suspect on. And I think that's true for just in general for
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_07: enterprise sales. They're hyper complex. You have multiple buyers. The personalities that I don't
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_07: think AI has been helpful there. But I do think like some of the things that I use it for, like
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_07: personally, we have a natural language component to Databricks. So we have all of our data in one
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_07: place and I just will literally go in and be curious to say, Hey, how is Lars doing over the last
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_07: 30 days? How many activities? How many new look? New, we call them use case objects? How's he doing
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_07: on his consumption? How's the retail business doing? You can just ask it questions and it pops up
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_07: and it's very empowering. So lots of dashboards that look at, but the ad hoc questions, really good.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_07: And then, canally, as somebody who gets to go and talk to customers on my team's behalf, but a lot
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_07: of the times it's one on one, I'll just pick up my phone afterwards, go to open AI is what I use
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_07: and click on the little person that you talk with back and forth and just dump a bunch of unstructured
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_07: content and say create an executive summary for me. I can send to my team with action items.
[00:20:18] Do you expect more productivity out of your team as a result of AI? Are you raising quotas or
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_08: numbers anywhere? We do. I think so. I think it will help our teams be more productive going into a
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_07: call. I think you can do a lot more research. So if you have a team that's not verticalized,
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_07: it's a geo team. And one day they're talking, or one the morning they're talking to a health
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_07: care provider and they have to do talking to a manufacturer and later they're talking to a
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_07: software company. The ability to change gears and do research on the fly heading into that is
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_07: incredible. I mean, it's absolutely incredible. I think every AI is doing that to some degree. In
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_07: fact, I tell my team that, hey, we're in a competitive evil with name your favorite competitor.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_07: So you're going to go in and say, hi, I'm a Databricks rep competing against this competitor
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_07: at this account. How should I position my product? And it'll give you the top five things.
[00:21:24] I ask my team, do you think your competition's not doing that? Why don't you say,
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_07: I'm this person that a competitor competing against Databricks at this account? How should I
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_07: compete? And then you have the playbook. So like, you know, there's a little bit of reverse
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_07: engineering that happens there, but I think just helping people be a little bit smarter about who
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_07: they're talking to, getting spun up thinking competitively. Yeah, from Game Theory Mike. How are you
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_02: testing the A, E or whatever you call them? No. Has to their, but all the output, because what you
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_02: get out of open AI or everything else is a lot of BS. So how do you know if they're not just
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_02: taking that? Is it on the e-mail phone? That's one question. Also, how do you test the AI
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_02: needed this other call assessment? Okay, I'm just going to repeat the question. The first is,
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_08: how do you, how do you, well, the second one was how do you test the AI nativiveness? And then
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_08: the second, the first one was, how do you verify the quality of the output from the AEs? Are they just
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_08: taking what's being output by AI and regurgitating it? Yeah. So there's a couple things. We do a lot
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_07: of certifications. With ironic part is we use AI to certify our people on pitches. So that's been
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_07: a, it's been a good one though. Honestly, you know, we say here's the golden pitch. You're going to
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_07: certify, we do it with the AI companion and it tells you basically where you know, the score of each
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_07: each person. There is no substitute to be perfectly clear for being in the field with your team though.
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_07: You will see very quickly who's real and who's not. You know, I think the AI can help you
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_07: in an elevator as you're heading up to get smart on something to a degree surface level for sure.
[00:23:12] And you're going to know very quickly. It's a, it's a tool to take you from good to great, not from
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_07: mediocre to great. You know, and so be out in the field. There's no, there's no substitute for it
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_07: still to this day in my opinion. What are you using for training? We use, we use a few. And again,
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_07: I don't know how I'm allowed to say or not, but I'll tell you, uh, Yodley is one that we, we've had
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_07: good success with to help train the team on their pitches. It's the video capability that they pitch
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_07: and it gives you feedback. Yeah. The question that there was just asked was what do we use? Yeah.
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_07: I've got one back here. So there was two things that were very compelling that you said earlier around
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_05: being able to kind of boot CS and reduce the cost there and then not having to worry about
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_05: committed revenue. I guess my question is, would you say that these are like general principles now
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_05: that you'll take to other businesses? Should you land at other places in the future? Or is this a
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_05: little bit of a symbol of the product market fit for a data break? So for instance, like customers
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_05: access exists to drive adoption. And so if it the product is so sticky that you don't need to drive
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_05: adoption, then yeah, get one of those people out of there. Um, and then committed revenue if the
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_05: business can just focus on growth and not worry about commit, which some companies do. That's also
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_05: great too. So are some of these decisions tied to just the strength of the product market fit?
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_05: Or would you say these are decisions that you take from place to place? I don't have a playbook
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_07: that I take, you know, and try it's it's very specific, you know, you got to look and read and
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_07: understand the company. So, but I do think in consumption based businesses as a whole, I don't
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_07: think it has much to do with product market fit. I think it's the role of the AE to drive that
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_07: growth. So it's just a fundamental mindset that that AE's job, if they want to get paid on
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_07: incremental revenue, they're going to care about driving incremental consumption and gross.
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_07: So I just think it cuts one extra person out and puts, you know, the onus on the AE.
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_07: Now there are the consumption businesses that need a little more muscle to like drive the consumption.
[00:25:24] Um, that would still be your take. You'd have the AE drive that. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think if
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_07: they need more muscle that I've count on an AE over CS. How do you see sales management
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_06: evolve with AI? Like traditionally, you may be able to like manage like six or eight reps max,
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_06: right? Like do you think that change? Like do you think that AI is going to help people like
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_06: manage their teams more effectively? And how is that going to involve like career development for
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_06: reps when everybody wants to be a manager eventually? Yeah. I mean, I read these articles about
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_07: Jensen having 33 direct reports. And I'm like, I have no idea how you do it. Like you're not really
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_07: having a relationship with someone. Um, I think it's very similar when you're managing teams.
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_07: It's very personal. You need to be diagnosing what that person, I mean, just reading them,
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_07: understanding what's going on, having that conversation. I don't think AI is going to ever
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_07: substitute that. It's a different experience as a whole. So I think spanish control is probably
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_07: going to always be in the six to eight as classic. And you know, you could stretch to 10.
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_07: But you got to have a relationship with your people. You got to know kind of what's going on
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_07: in their personal life and how, you know, how that affects their performance versus not. And
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_07: what they're good at from an exact present standpoint, navigating a complex org. I don't know
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_07: that AI is ever going to get there. So that's my gut on that.
[00:26:55] Presumity helped. Um, so continue on that thought process around teams, right? Like how are you
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_00: thinking of setting up or how do you set up your team where Databricks has like a core business
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_00: and then there's AI. And in the AI world, I think people are still trying to figure out
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_00: like how you sell and what you sell and who you sell to those kinds of things. And so
[00:27:18] in that world, do you have like a forward deploy that's like trying to figure that out and make
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: it a repeatable process versus the people who are just turning out your, um, their code doesn't
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_00: think like that or how are you setting that? You mean in the company, do we have a dedicated like AI
[00:27:37] when you're selling AI, basically, right? When I'm selling AI or
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_07: not implementing AI internally. No, no, when you're selling like AI products. Yes. It's a new
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_07: market. Yes. We doesn't have a let's say it doesn't have a repeatable motion yet.
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_07: Product market fit hasn't been found. Right. And so you're still like iterating on that. I'm assuming.
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_00: And in that case, if that's the setup, then like, yeah, how would one set up a team where you're
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_00: still trying to figure out PMFs, still trying to figure out actually what the ICP is to be honest.
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And so I'll rewind because we're doing a billion dollars plus an AI specifically now.
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_07: So it is a fairly sizable business, but it's still so new because I joke with the team all the time,
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_07: you're going to be sitting in with these people in this room 10 years from now and you're going to
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_07: be laughing about remember when enterprises had no idea what to do with AI. Like yeah, it's for sure
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_07: thing. The key is it is a lot like your network is your network. I say this all the time to my team.
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_07: And that includes the colleagues that you have internally in marketing and product. And oftentimes
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_07: your sales people need to go out and figure out what does the market need and feed that back as
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_07: quickly as possible to the marketing team to create the content to the product team to create the
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_07: product. And so it's a lot of iteration. And so you can use AI and tooling like the conversation
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_07: intelligence tools to hear the common themes push back feedback, et cetera. But you really got to
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_07: make as you have a new product introduction a consistent effort to have that feedback loop. And
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_07: just a lot of like, hey, I pitched this today. This is how it works. So you know, finding a way to
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_07: build that operational rigor and rhythm into your business so that you that loop is closed not only
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_07: within the team, but within the corresponding teams. That's how you go fast. Yeah. Do you hire
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_00: differently from that though? Because that's a different skill set. No, I, you got a higher,
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_07: really curious, really collaborative people. I have us saying if I want missionaries, not mercenaries,
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_07: I need people that are believing in the mission and they're going to be on it for a while and they
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_07: want to do better and help everyone around them better. Loan Wolfs, I don't need. Sounds good,
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_00: thanks. Yeah. Great. Time for two more questions. I thought it was really interesting you're talking
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_01: about commits and how they play a lesser role in some ways. That's how interpreted your answer. But
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_01: in a pure consumption business, I imagine most of the revenue basis is very stable. So you can
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_01: kind of project it pretty well. But if you have new product lines, let's say, where you know,
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_01: you're introducing new products and if they're consumption based, the consumption is very,
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_01: I imagine significantly. If that is your experience, how do you think about forecasting products,
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_01: which are newer and do you look at revenue on a product basis or do you look at as an overall
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_01: sort of business in view? Yeah, we're sure to. When you do a new product introduction, like, you
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_07: need to have a concerted effort to drive that. There's got to be a lot of enablement behind that.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_07: You want to get your ecosystem behind that. You want to incentivize typically in the form of some
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_07: sort of spiff or multiplier for the team to push that. You need product to be signing up to, like,
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_07: go meet with certain customers because the feedback loop is going to come fast and they're going
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_07: to need to iterate. So it's definitely a thing. I've seen it done a lot of different ways. I've
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_07: seen companies that have a new product introduction specialist team. It's a confined thing that they
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_07: build and then it has whatever the new product is to flavor the year. And then the next year,
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_07: as the company innovates, it moves on to the next product because the team, the core team has learned
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_07: how to pick up that new product that prior year. And that keeps you from getting a bloated overlay
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_07: organization of specialists, but still helps your AEs with wingman or wing women to go land that
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_07: new product. So there's a few ways to do it, but you got to think about it 360. It's got to be a
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_07: priority. I give a lot of credit to Databricks. They're really good at the executive level. We
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_07: set three priorities for the year on a product basis. And the team knows, like, I'm going to have
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_07: a target on this. And I'm going to have, you know, I'm going to be measured on it every week. And
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_07: it's important for the company's success. And it's just very consistent.
[00:32:03] Can you talk a little bit about the cadence and the rhythm, the dashboards, the rituals that
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_03: work for you, terms of keeping the sales force going? Yeah, I mean, we owe a lot of dashboards,
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_07: as you might imagine, as a data and AI company. My favorite is one that we call morning coffee.
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_07: It's meant to be looked at by sales leader every morning as they have their cup of coffee.
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_07: And it looks at your consumption on a daily basis, your gainers, your losers,
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_07: your any new use cases that were created, the use cases that have moved to live, the use cases
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_07: that have slipped, where the amount of training vouchers. So there's like 15 things on it. And you've
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_07: kind of go through it every single day. You get a rhythm of a given dashboard. And you can kind of
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_07: see those changes quickly. But morning coffee is probably my favorite. It just kind of helps me see
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_07: what's going on in the business. And if I see something that has like a material change, I just
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_07: ping the A E. And I'm like, what happened? You know, what's going on? Did you know this optimization
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_07: was coming? You know, what happened? How can I help? Well, Chris, thank you very much for joining.
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_08: I was fascinated to learn about your journey, your belief in usage-based pricing, the structure
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_08: of the orgs, and then how you implement them. So big round of applause for Chris. Thanks for sharing
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_08: your insight. Thank you.
