# [Key Themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJfC1q6Uv4)

### 1. **Consumption-Based Sales Requires Fundamentally Different AE Behavior and Skills**
The shift from SaaS to consumption-based models demands AEs act more like portfolio managers with daily diligence rather than quarterly deal hunters. Chris Klayko emphasizes: "I have a saying, I have a few sayings with my team and one of them is each of vegetables... in a SaaS world, you can go for 89 days not really doing anything from a sales standpoint on the 90th day of the quarter, you can go do the big elephant deal... that doesn't work in consumption. It compounds." He adds that AEs need "IQ plus EQ plus TQ, technical question" - highlighting the necessity of technical capability alongside traditional sales skills. The role now requires being "almost like a program manager or project manager" managing multiple micro-selling events continuously.

### 2. **Eliminating Customer Success in Favor of AE-Owned Relationships**
Klayko advocates for removing the CS function entirely in consumption models, with AEs maintaining ownership throughout the customer lifecycle. He explains: "I subscribe to the Frank Slootman thought of no CS. I don't believe in CS... In consumption, you can't choose that. You're on that account and you're going to be the one overseeing a lot of that program management." The model includes mandatory quarterly business reviews where AEs proactively offer optimization opportunities: "I'm always telling my team to go talk to their customers every 90 days and offer up optimization opportunities. How do you spend less with me?... if you go and you're proactive on that, then the next workload or use case comes my direction."

### 3. **AI's Current Impact is Tactical, Not Strategic in Enterprise Sales**
While AI enhances productivity in specific areas like top-of-funnel prospecting and research, Klayko remains skeptical about its ability to handle complex deal qualification. He states: "I think it's okay, it's not great. We use Clary... they'll give you a deal score. I don't the qualitative element of that is not great in my mind for AI... a meeting with you to talk about a closed process and funding is very different than just a bump in to someone in the hallway. But it scores at the same." He finds personal value in natural language queries to internal data and using it for competitive research: "I'm this person that a competitor competing against Databricks at this account? How should I compete? And then you have the playbook."

# Contrarian Perspectives

### 1. **Discounting Should Be Minimal in Consumption Models**
Klayko challenges the enterprise expectation of steep discounts, arguing consumption eliminates the need for traditional pricing concessions: "In consumption, you get 100% value of what you consume. And so the discount, why are you giving a discount to begin with? Yeah, there's some economies of scale, so some economic unit economics are deserved, but it's typically a much smaller discount as a result." This contradicts standard enterprise procurement practices where larger commitments typically yield 30-50% discounts.

### 2. **Consumption is "Boring" and Should Be Positioned That Way**
Counter to typical sales culture celebrating big wins, Klayko explicitly tells new hires: "I always tell them like, hey, just so we're perfectly clear, I know sales, we've got a lot of adrenaline junkies and sales... Consumptions boring and you just need to get your head wrapped around it." He deliberately sets expectations that there won't be quarterly hero moments, which goes against conventional sales motivation tactics. His justification: "if you do the right things day in and day out, the results will be there guaranteed."

### 3. **No Commit Quotas Despite Running a Billion+ Dollar Business**
Despite managing over $1B in AI revenue, Databricks doesn't assign commit quotas to salespeople: "We today don't have any commit quota. So there's not a sales percent at Databricks that owns or has a quota that has a commit period hard stuff. That keeps people focused on the right thing and growing the account and being with them long term." They only provide spiffs above baseline consumption targets, which contradicts standard enterprise software sales methodology that emphasizes securing large upfront commitments.

### 4. **AI Won't Increase Span of Control for Sales Managers**
While many predict AI will allow managers to oversee larger teams, Klayko disagrees: "I read these articles about Jensen having 33 direct reports. And I'm like, I have no idea how you do it... I think spanish control is probably going to always be in the six to eight as classic... you got to have a relationship with your people. You got to know kind of what's going on in their personal life and how, you know, how that affects their performance." He views management as fundamentally human work that AI cannot augment meaningfully.

# Operating Insights

### 1. **Build Exception Reporting as a Diagnostic Waterfall**
Klayko uses a systematic hierarchy to diagnose underperformance: "Is the rep making their number from a consumption? Yes, great. No, they're not making that over. Do they have pipeline? Yes. Okay, pipeline will usually lead to consumption over time... No pipeline. Do they have activity? Yes, well, usually activity will build to pipeline... No activity. How's their training and enablement?" This creates a clear diagnostic tree that identifies root causes rather than just symptoms, with the insight that "people that don't have the pipeline and don't have the activity is typically they're uncomfortable talking about the topic."

### 2. **Use AI to Reverse-Engineer Competitive Positioning**
Rather than just using AI for internal research, Klayko advocates using it to understand how competitors will attack you: "I tell my team, do you think your competition's not doing that? Why don't you say, I'm this person that a competitor competing against Databricks at this account? How should I compete? And then you have the playbook. So like, you know, there's a little bit of reverse engineering that happens there."

### 3. **Mandate Leadership Field Time Despite Data Availability**
Even with extensive dashboards and AI tools, Klayko emphasizes: "There is no substitute to be perfectly clear for being in the field with your team though. You will see very quickly who's real and who's not... It's a tool to take you from good to great, not from mediocre to great... there's no substitute for it still to this day in my opinion." This counters the trend toward purely data-driven management.

### 4. **Create Dedicated New Product Introduction Teams That Rotate**
For new product launches, Klayko recommends: "I've seen companies that have a new product introduction specialist team. It's a confined thing that they build and then it has whatever the new product is to flavor the year. And then the next year, as the company innovates, it moves on to the next product because the team, the core team has learned how to pick up that new product that prior year. And that keeps you from getting a bloated overlay organization of specialists."
