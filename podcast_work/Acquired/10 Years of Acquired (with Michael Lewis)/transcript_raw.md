[00:00:00] Happy 10 years.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_03: Happy 10 year anniversary, Ben.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_03: It's crazy it's been 10 years.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_03: I know.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_03: Here we are, brought you down here to Silicon Valley
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_03: to record our 10 year anniversary holiday special here.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_03: I wanted a special place.
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, what are we doing?
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_01: You keep like teeing up.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_03: The go just come down.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_01: Oh, we'll just record it here and like clearly,
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_01: we're not at your house.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_03: I was actually thinking we should try and find
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_03: the Silicon Valley house, the early Bachman, Aviato.
[00:00:27] There's Aviato.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_01: Aviato.
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_03: Aviato.
[00:00:31] Now, the reason I brought you down here
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_03: is I booked us a very special place to record.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_03: It's actually right over here.
[00:00:39] It's a house.
[00:00:42] Is this the Google house?
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_01: It's the house.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_03: Where they had their first office in the garage.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: This is Google's first office right here.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_03: They gave it to us for the day.
[00:00:50] Like we can do our holiday special in it.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_01: Come on in.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_03: MUSIC
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: Welcome to the fall 2025 season finale
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: of acquired the podcast about great companies
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_01: and the stories and playbooks behind them.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: I'm Ben Gilbert.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: I'm David Rosenthal.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_01: And we are your hosts.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: Well, listeners, today we're going to do something
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: very different than our holiday specials of years passed.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_01: We've received a bunch of requests over the years
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: to do an acquired episode on acquired itself
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: and to unpack why acquired work
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_01: to win 99% of podcasts do not.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: But it's always felt a little bit strange to me.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_01: And we've always shied away from analyzing our own company.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_01: Yep.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_03: But then this year we turned 10 years old and thought,
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_03: well, maybe it's time for something,
[00:02:01] at least a sort of pause and reflection
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_03: to shout out the Coca-Cola episode on our journey
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_03: to this point and why acquired has worked.
[00:02:10] And so we thought, well, if we're going to do something,
[00:02:13] we should bring someone in to do it with us.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: And we'd want someone who is great at dissecting
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_01: the mechanics behind teams or companies,
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_01: someone who distills complexity into simplicity,
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: someone who himself knows how to tell a great story.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_01: And there was really only one choice.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_03: Michael Lewis, author of Moneyball, Liars Poker,
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_03: The Blind Side, The End Doing Project,
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_03: going infinite on and on and on.
[00:02:38] And of course, host of his own podcast against the rules.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_03: And Ben, you and I have looked up to Michael forever.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_03: So this was really special.
[00:02:46] Yes.
[00:02:46] And then of course, there's the venue.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_01: We thought it'd be a fitting way to cap off the year
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: of our three-part Google series to record
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: in the literal garage where that nearly $4 trillion
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_01: company got started.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: Yes, indeed.
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_03: Well, listeners, if you want to know every time
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_03: an episode drops, vote on future episode topics
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_03: and get corrections on past episodes,
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_03: check out our email list at acquired.fm slash email.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_03: And that email list just got a whole lot better
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_01: with our first overhaul in five years.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: So you'll now get episode summaries
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_01: are big takeaways and exclusive photos
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_01: from our research process.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_01: That's acquired.fm slash email.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_01: Chat about this episode with us
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_01: and the whole acquired community in Slack,
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_01: acquired.fm slash slash.
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_01: And if you want more acquired,
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_01: check out our interview show ACQ2.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: Our last episode was with Andrew Ross Sorkin,
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_01: founder of the New York Times dealbook,
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_01: host of CNBC's Squawk Box and author of 1929.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_01: That's ACQ2 in any podcast player.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_01: And before we dive in,
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_01: we want to briefly thank our presenting partner,
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_01: JP Morgan Payments.
[00:03:50] Yes, just like how we say,
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_03: every company has a story,
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_03: every company's story is powered by payments.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_03: And JP Morgan Payments is a part of so many
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_03: of their journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_03: So with that, this show is not investment advice.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_01: Dave and I may have investments in the companies we discuss
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_01: and this show is for informational
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_01: and entertainment purposes only.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_01: With that, onto our conversation with Michael Lewis.
[00:04:11] Well, Michael, thank you for joining us.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_03: Total pleasure.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_03: We have all something since this is our 10-year anniversary
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_03: that we're celebrating that we need to do before we start.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_03: Okay. So you went to Princeton.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_03: I went to Princeton.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_03: Yep.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_03: My senior thesis would become impactful for acquired.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_03: I was a French literature major.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_03: I wrote my thesis on the history of Dom Parignon
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_03: and the marketing history of...
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_03: Very serious college student.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_03: Very serious college student.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_03: A little different thing.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_03: I'd like to let you do that.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_02: Somehow, I conned the French department into letting me do this.
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_03: And what probably 12, 13 years later,
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_03: we made our LVMH episode.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_03: And it was a big moment for acquired.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_03: Moet and Chendon has just released the 2015 vintage
[00:05:02] of Dom Parignon.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_03: 2015 is the year we started.
[00:05:05] So I thought you were going to say that the effect
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_02: that the Princeton thesis had on acquired.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_02: I didn't think it was as specific as that.
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_02: But I feel like when I'm listening to your episodes,
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_02: I'm listening to someone who's worked to a thesis.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_02: That is thesis-like immersion in a subject.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_03: Why can't tell you our episodes are much better
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_03: than my actual thesis was?
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_01: But that is exactly how it feels.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_01: But that is the process we go through.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And it's like we're going to see a business.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_03: It's like we're going to see a business.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of academic feelings that happen
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_01: as we get close to recording day.
[00:05:37] So it's your show and I don't want to take it over.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_02: But I wanted to start by saying that I didn't discover it
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_02: until this year in July.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_02: I was at Google Camp, which is kind of a good way
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_02: to discover acquired.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_02: And we should talk about where we are now, too.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_03: And we are sitting in the Google garage where, yes.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I don't know exactly what that was.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_02: But sure, exactly what happened in the Google garage.
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_02: So this was the nice idea.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_02: Like literally Susan Wujeski lived here.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_01: I think just bought the house.
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_01: This was very hot.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_03: And was looking to sublet part of it.
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_01: Like just make some extra money on other people
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_01: using the house.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_01: I'm posted bulletin notice on the Stanford campus
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_03: that there was space available here.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_03: And so Larry and Sergei's first desks
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_01: when they got kicked out of Stanford's offices.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: We're right there.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_01: Right here, huh?
[00:06:30] All right.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_01: Actually, this actual door desk saw horse
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_01: is the one that they were using.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_01: Because Google pulled it out of storage for us.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_02: So I'm at this camp with a lot of kind of well-known people.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_02: And a prominent CEO says to me, have you listened to acquired?
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_02: And I didn't know what he was talking about.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_02: And I went and listened.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_02: I can't remember what I listened to first.
[00:06:53] I think it might have been the Morris Chang episode.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_02: But I had about eight different reactions to it, all positive.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_02: And I thought, this is kind of amazing, which you all are doing.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_02: So then I was from July until now, I've
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_02: listened to maybe Canada the episodes,
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_02: which is a lot of our listening.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_02: The first thing struck me, could not believe you were getting away
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_02: with a four-hour podcast.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_02: And I couldn't believe that even after four hours,
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_02: I was still looking for even more.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_02: You created the environment with a podcast that I
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_02: tried to create with a book.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_02: You grab the listener, like I try to grab a reader,
[00:07:31] and get them to the state of mind, well,
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_02: they'll let you take them anywhere.
[00:07:35] And teach them about stuff that they don't even know
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_02: they want to learn about.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_02: If we're doing this as a 10th anniversary celebration.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_02: Please, yeah.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_02: I'm honored.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_02: And I feel like I'm a lot of my depth here,
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_02: because I'm just a new listener.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_02: And I haven't listened to all of it.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_02: I'm hardly the world's authority on your podcast.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_02: And I didn't prepare it all except to listen to it.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_02: Except I did one thing.
[00:07:58] And that was I went back and listened to you very first.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_02: Oh, wow.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_02: Oh, wow.
[00:08:03] Just to compare.
[00:08:05] And it is shocking how different it is from where you started
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_02: from where you have, you probably haven't ended up,
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_02: but where you are now.
[00:08:16] So I'm going to start by this 10-year journey.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_02: I think I can see some things you've learned.
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_02: Oh.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_02: But I want to know what you think you've learned.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_02: Give me, let's do the 10 lessons from the 10-year journey.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_02: Do you have yours like crystallized?
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_01: Because I don't want to taint you with what we've done.
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_01: I do have, it's actually one big thing.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_02: And if you say it, I'll acknowledge it.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_02: You know, it's not my battleship.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_02: And I have nothing to ask.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_02: But I'm curious what you think.
[00:08:46] There's no way that first thing you did
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_02: was ever going to become a hit.
[00:08:51] Well, I'm curious if you think, I've always believed
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_03: something that's always been there from the beginning
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_03: is the magic between me and Ben.
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_03: That's interesting to me.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_02: You all meet at like a Passover Seder.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_02: And you're a colleague.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: You're not being colleagues at a VC firm.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_02: I'll come back to that.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_02: I want to talk a little bit about you as investors.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_02: But we'll come back to that.
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_02: And how that's different from being a podcaster.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_02: But what point do you decide that, oh, there's
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_02: a kind of odd chemistry here?
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_02: We really just wanted to spend more time together.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_01: It was one of these things where.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_01: You're both straight.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: This is a better way.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_01: It's not a romantic relationship.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_03: We like to say that we each have two spouses.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_03: We have our actual romantic spouses that we have families
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_03: with.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_03: And then we have each other.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_01: But David and I shared a bank account
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_01: before my wife and I shared a bank account.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: So are either of your spouses threatened
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_01: by the relationship?
[00:09:43] No.
[00:09:44] No.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_03: Then just from sheer time perspective.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_03: A little bit.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_03: My spouse loves it because she doesn't actually
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_03: want to spend that much time with me.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_03: She likes it.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_03: No, I used to all the stuff we do on a card.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_03: I used to just talk at her.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_03: And she wasn't interested.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_03: That is true.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_03: And my wife loves it.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_03: She loves it because I get to talk to you.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_03: Although she gets the rough draft.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_01: My wife won't listen to episodes because she's like,
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_01: I've already heard four versions of the episode.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_01: And unfortunately, I heard four worse versions.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_01: And because I endure that and give you feedback,
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_01: the listener actually gets the better version.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_01: So you meet and there's a chemistry.
[00:10:19] Explain that chemistry.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_02: What is it that makes you excited to see each other?
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_02: David knew all the Apple rumors in real time
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: just like I did.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_01: You had read all the latest,
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_01: tritekery posts.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: We bonded over Bentopson originally.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_03: And I think, you can tell me if this is mutual,
[00:10:38] but I looked up to you because you
[00:10:41] were doing a thing that was mysterious to me,
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_01: which was venture capital.
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_01: I was a software engineer.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_01: And I got hired to work at a venture firm
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_01: to do some incubation work.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_01: But I didn't know anything about the real job of venture capital.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_01: And here's David, someone who's just a few years older than me,
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_01: like doing that thing, but kind of in my peer age group.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_01: And I could lean over and be like, what are they talking about?
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_01: Well, I kind of felt like a fraud in a lot of ways as of.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_03: I repressed this deep down.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_03: But if I'm honest with myself,
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_03: I think I felt like a fraud as a VC because I'd never,
[00:11:14] but I went to Princeton.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_03: I was a French literature major.
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_03: I worked on Wall Street.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_03: I worked briefly at the Wall Street Journal
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_03: and then I became a venture capitalist.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_03: I had no qualification to...
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_03: Have you ever coded it?
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_02: Coded or you've ever done any text?
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_03: I'm going to take some CS classes in college,
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_03: but I'd never built anything.
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_03: So I was like, you were in a bed and built all these things.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_03: Like you built the this for that website.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_03: You built so many products.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_03: You had products that millions of people use.
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_03: And I was like, I'm just masquerading here.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_03: So you can see that Ben knew stuff.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_02: And it was exciting for you to know about.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_02: Did you feel that David knew stuff?
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_02: Absolutely.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_02: What kind of stuff?
[00:11:50] Business.
[00:11:52] Really?
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_02: It was just French literature.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: I only found out years into doing acquired.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_01: He was a French lit major.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_01: But that's important.
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_02: That French lit.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_02: It ended up becoming a huge important part.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_03: This kind of broad curiosity about things
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_02: other than business and technology.
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_02: I hear it in your program.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_02: I hear it in your podcast.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_02: So what I'm thinking of in my head is Conoman and Tversky.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_02: I wrote a book called The Undying Projesse.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_02: And you could see...
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_02: It's similar.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_02: If you could see two people.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_02: And then it got me thinking about collaboration.
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_02: And I've had exciting collaborations with people.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_02: And the feeling I get is this person is bringing out
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_02: a better version of me, which is why I asked
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_02: if your spouses were threatened.
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_02: Because Conoman and Tversky's spouses
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_02: were threatened is too strong a word.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_02: But they were very aware that the relationship
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_02: that was the most important in their lives
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_02: was with not with their spouses.
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_02: But with the...
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_03: I got this sense from The Undying Project
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_03: that Conoman and Tversky's relationship was very intense.
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
[00:12:52] I don't know that I would describe our relationship as intense.
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_03: You know what?
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_02: It was competitive.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_02: Yes, it was.
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah.
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_02: In competitive.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_01: It was not competitive on what...
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_02: Danny Conoman felt...
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_02: was always at felt at risk of being dismissed,
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_02: thought the lesser partner.
[00:13:09] There was a status difference between the two of them.
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_02: Right going into it.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_02: Everyone in the world thought Amos
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_02: was the smartest person they'd ever met.
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_02: You two didn't have that, ever have any of that.
[00:13:20] Not for me.
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_02: But you said you felt like a fraud.
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_02: I think I felt less.
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_01: There were a lot of things when we started doing acquired
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_01: where we were doing this business analysis podcast,
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_01: but I didn't know finance.
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_01: Like it was...
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_01: Which is funny because you think
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_01: you're more the keeper of the analysis on acquired.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_03: And I'm more the keeper of the story.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_03: It's different though than a difference in status.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_01: I don't feel that you or I have ever felt
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_01: we had a difference in status.
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_01: And the number of fights we've had,
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_01: or real attention we've had is like two, three, ever,
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_01: in 10 years.
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_01: It's weirdly...
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_01: Let's come back to this.
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_03: And let's get to the lessons.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_03: What have you learned?
[00:13:58] We started thinking about what have we learned
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_03: from the companies we've covered
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_03: that we've then applied to acquired.
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_03: All right.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_01: In particular, acquired has clearly worked.
[00:14:08] Why?
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_01: And does that why have something to do with the fact
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_01: that we study the world's best companies?
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_01: Like is there some osmosis that happens
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_01: from the subject matter bleeding into the property itself?
[00:14:21] And...
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_01: So that's our frame.
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_01: So let's go with that frame.
[00:14:25] Yes.
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_02: So the one I was gonna start with is the NFL.
[00:14:30] The product is scarce.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_03: 162 baseball games a year.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_03: It's called America's Past Time.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_03: You pass a lot of time with it.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_03: But with the NFL,
[00:14:40] because the product is scarce
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_03: and then they have very smartly cultivated that
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_03: and engineered it to be more scarce,
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_03: more of an event driven sport,
[00:14:51] that's made all the difference.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_03: And like to me,
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_03: is like what we do isn't same
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_03: for the podcasting industry.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_03: Like it's completely insane.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_03: We release the last three years.
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_03: We've released 12 episodes.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_03: The next year we're gonna do eight episodes
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_02: for the whole year.
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_02: Now as a hobbyist podcaster,
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_02: what I get told is you have to be on all the time.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_02: And I can't do it.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_02: And so I'm not gonna do it.
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_02: Podcasting is like your second or third thing
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_03: that you do, right?
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_03: And we make more episodes,
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_03: I think, per year than we do.
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_03: That's correct.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_02: But they're just, you know,
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_02: it's except for the scripted ones,
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_02: which I do throw myself into.
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_02: It really is.
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_02: I do no preparation and it is a convert.
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_02: And I do do very much of those.
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_02: A scripted ones I do put time into.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_02: And but it's a different sort of thing
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_02: than what you're doing.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_02: It tends to be a very narrow little story
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_02: that I'm telling.
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_02: You didn't start out though.
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_02: You used to make 26 episodes a year, you know.
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_03: They were 40 minutes long to an hour 20.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_02: And so how do you go for that to realizing
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_02: and did you really learn it from the NFL
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_02: or did you just do it and then this all over?
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_02: We were starting to do it and then we covered the NFL
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_03: and we were like,
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_03: this is what we're doing.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_03: Most of these things are actually,
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_01: I think our confirmation bias.
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_01: We get some inkling that like we should continue
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_01: to go in this direction.
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_01: Like my, in calling out Hermes,
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: it's because I think quality and scarcity
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: have become an important part of acquired.
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_01: And in some ways we like learned that from Hermes,
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: but we covered Hermes last year.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: I think we found our way to that probably four-ish years ago,
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_01: maybe five years ago,
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: where we used to feel like we were bad at podcasting
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_01: because we couldn't make very many.
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_01: And because we didn't have a whole production team
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: and we didn't have professional ad sales people
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_01: and we didn't have,
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_01: we weren't full time for a long time.
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and at some point we kind of looked at each other
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_01: and we were like,
[00:16:35] maybe if we just admit that we,
[00:16:38] SPEAKER_01: we are heavily constrained
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_01: and then try to just lean into that constraint
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_01: in the way that Hermes leans into every single Birken bag
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_01: must be handmade by one artisan
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_01: and we're gonna build a business model around that.
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_01: And it turns out to be a great business.
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_01: We sort of thought every episode
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_01: is gonna be entirely handcrafted by us,
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_01: all the research, all the recording.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_01: We work with this amazing audio engineer, Stephen,
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_01: who does the like literal waveform editing,
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_01: but you know, we go in and in a transcript
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_01: and highlight 1,000 cuts per episode.
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_01: Like it's this made with love product
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_01: and it turned out we could actually build a big platform
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: and a good business out of something heavily constrained.
[00:17:19] But that's not where you start.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no.
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_01: So how do we shouldn't do that?
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_02: So let's just say people who don't know,
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_02: where you start is you're two guys who've met each other
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_02: and got a crush on each other.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_02: You're being with each other
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_02: and you get this idea that
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_02: that would be really cool to do a podcast
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_02: on corporate acquisitions that worked.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that worked.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_02: That idea.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_02: Well, it is an idea.
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_02: I would refer to the starting point.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_02: You could easily have started the opposite.
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_02: Corporate acquisitions that didn't
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_02: and you'd have done much more material.
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_01: Which is what most press at the time was.
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_01: Right, let's talk about how crappy this acquisition is.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_01: So it's interesting to me that your first step
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_02: right from the start is positive.
[00:17:59] It's like what worked.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_02: Not what didn't work, it's what worked.
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_01: That's because we were VCs
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_01: and I was trying to build companies.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the goal was create things
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_01: that have enough value to get bought or go public.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_01: And when people buy things,
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_01: it's because they're working.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_01: So let's try to reverse engine and what works.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_01: We understand why things worked.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_03: Right, so that's a different starting spot
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_02: from almost all journalism.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_02: In fact, if most journalists started there,
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_02: they'd be accused of hegeography of that.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: But because of where you're coming from
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_02: and because you're thinking of this
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_02: in very practical terms, like how, why did this work?
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_02: You do get away with it.
[00:18:38] It's just that first episode,
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_02: you're almost like different people.
[00:18:42] But I'm gonna hold back on what I think you look.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_02: Because I wanna see if you get to it.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_02: So we got, what's the third episode
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_02: that you have learned a lesson from?
[00:18:51] I think Berkshire, we learned so many things from.
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_01: We did this three part.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_01: I'm not a big about it.
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_01: I'm very sure it should be a lot of it.
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_01: God, I have not listened to it.
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_02: And I am a big investor in Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_02: Good for you, so.
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_02: Where are you from?
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_02: Well, since when?
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_02: I bought it right in the middle of the financial crisis.
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_02: Because I thought, I mean, I had done a take,
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it's not, it's a little, putting it a little strongly.
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_02: But oddly, I had written a take down a Warren Buffett
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_02: on the cover of the New Republic magazine
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_02: called the Temptation of St. Warren.
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_02: You can probably dig it off of the way back to Jesus.
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_02: What was the thesis?
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_02: The thesis was that he may have started out
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_02: being who he says he is.
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_02: But that he's become this very different thing
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_02: in the marketplace.
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_02: His money's not like other people's money.
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_02: That's true.
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_02: And you don't have a couple of things Warren Buffett has.
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_02: And his money's valued differently.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_02: But secondly, he was willing to do deals
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_02: that the time bothered the hell out of me.
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_02: And what had happened was, I think I-
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_02: Like the Golden Deal or?
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_02: This was a Solomon Brothers deal with bother the hell out of me.
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_02: He kept a CEO in place who I thought should not have been
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_02: with.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_02: Were you there?
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you lived through it.
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_02: No, it's through.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_02: It's part of our purchase here.
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_02: It turned me briefly, only briefly actually,
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_02: cynical about Warren Buffett.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_02: And then I came out of it and fell in love with them all
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_02: over again.
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_02: But I had ridden this thing and pissed him off entirely.
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I clearly upset him.
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_02: And then kind of started watching him for a longer.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_02: And I thought, you know, I just liked him.
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_02: Just liked him.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_02: You couldn't help but like him.
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_02: So I started to soften.
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_02: And when we get to the financial crisis,
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_02: I thought, well, his money's going to be so valuable here.
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_02: But what is needed is credit.
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_02: And I think it might, if he stays alive long enough,
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_02: it might happen again soon.
[00:20:33] So you know, I've-
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_02: So you invested in Berkshire before the Golden
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_02: Dairy deals coming out of the financial crisis.
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_02: And so I bought a chunk of the A shares and I've just sat on them.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_02: And let me tell you, can I tell you Warren Buffett's story?
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_02: I mean, this is a little talking a little bit out of school.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_02: But I've never met him.
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_02: I know he was really irritated with me.
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_02: And then I actually looked back at that art.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_02: It's the only time I've ever looked back at peace I wrote.
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_02: And I thought, I overdid that.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_02: And when bright back to the New Republic
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_02: and wrote another 5,000 word thing about Warren Buffett,
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_02: in which I basically apologized for the first piece,
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_02: I bought these shares in 2008.
[00:21:05] When I was working on going infinite,
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_02: I was working on the Sandbackman Fried book.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_02: And I was talking to a publicist,
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_02: completely unrelated to Warren Buffett.
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_02: And she said, you know, I also represent Warren.
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_02: And she said, and I told Warren
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_02: that I've been talking to you.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_02: And he said, he has a question for you.
[00:21:28] SPEAKER_02: And I said, what?
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_02: Is he the Michael Lewis who bought shares back in the...
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I swear to God.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_02: I swear to God.
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_02: So this tells you something about Warren Buffett,
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: Warren Buffett, Warren Buffett, me.
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_02: And he said, he bought it like,
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_02: the book value to, you know, that thing, that ratio.
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_02: He bought it as cheap as it's ever been.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_02: And he says, he says,
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_02: You made the best choice.
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_02: When I hold on, hold on, as he says.
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_02: Then he says, so he's the Michael Lewis who sold.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_02: Some burst your half away two years ago and four years ago.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_02: And he was like, why do you sell?
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_02: So he's tracking...
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_02: I'm not a huge...
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I can't imagine he's tracking.
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_02: He's like, banger here.
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: And I said, well, actually, I actually just gave him a charity.
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_02: It's what I'd done.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_02: I would give him the money away.
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_02: That's fun, man.
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_02: And when he heard it, he said that,
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_02: he'll be relieved to hear that kind of thing.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_02: It's like, so can you imagine?
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_02: Can you imagine that Warren Buffett is taking the time
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_02: to watch who is coming in and out of the A shares
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_02: and thinking about it?
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I just thought, he has that...
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_02: He and Munger had that whole thing about,
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_02: don't put your money in index fund, put your money
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_02: in a big bundle of stocks.
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_02: Put it in a few stocks and watch those stocks like a hawk.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_02: It's like they watch that thing in a way that...
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_02: I just, in history, is anybody ever done anything?
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_02: I mean, all these people are the maniacs.
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_02: You don't build something like this.
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_03: You don't, that's exactly right.
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_02: So anyway, sorry, I just digressed here.
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_02: What did you learn from your Berkshire...
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_02: There are three episodes of Berkshire Halfaway.
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_01: Well, as it applies to acquired,
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_01: we got really obsessed with the circle of competence
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_01: that it's okay to have a giant two-hard pile.
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_01: There's a bunch of things that like...
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_01: I'm not intelligently saying no to...
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_01: We used to send this all the time.
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_01: We'd be like, two-hard piles, three-hard piles.
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_03: Every time you had a phone call, we'd have a...
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_01: What is this?
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_01: What is this expression used?
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_02: So that Warren...
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_03: This is a Charlie had this thing.
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_03: There was the, like the yes pile, the no pile,
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_03: and then the two-hard pile.
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_03: Or the two-hard pile, I see.
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_03: And it's okay to just like...
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_03: And the two-hard means no.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_03: All the technology was a two-hard pile.
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was all...
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_03: Like, there might be something in here,
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_03: but like I'm just too hard.
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_03: It's basically admitting that like our opportunity cost
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_01: is so high, like the things that we say yes to are so awesome,
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_01: that it's okay to say too hard to just a giant amount of things.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_01: Yep.
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_01: And that was really freeing once we started just like...
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: I mean, truly unknowingly...
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: So what's an example of something that you...
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_02: I'm surprised you say this.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_02: Which two-hard...
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_02: With the reason that...
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_03: One of the reasons, besides just wanting to meet you,
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_03: because you've been an inspiration to us forever,
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_03: that I wanted to meet you a few months ago, was Hollywood.
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_03: We've had lots of opportunities to work with Hollywood.
[00:24:08] It keeps being...
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_03: To this point, Tim does always invariably
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_03: end up in the two-hard pile.
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_03: Are you talking about doing episodes about...
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_03: In Hollywood?
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no.
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_02: To become a movie star.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_02: On a creative show, it's creative.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_02: It's like a TV show.
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_02: Adapting into films.
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_01: These stories into films.
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_01: They all sound good until we start digging in,
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_01: and then we're like,
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_01: the time it would take us to think through
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_01: all the implications of this...
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_01: We should just...
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_01: We should just make another episode.
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_03: The answer...
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_03: The answer, almost always, is we should just make another episode.
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_03: That's a really intelligent place to land.
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_02: Because what they will do is
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_02: woo you with their enthusiasm
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_02: and then take you down a rabbit hole
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_02: where you will spend years of your life
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_02: and have nothing to show.
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_02: Well, this is one of the reasons I want to talk to.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_03: Michael's a very smart guy.
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_03: You've been very successful.
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_03: I've gone down the rabbit hole.
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but you're not really knowing that.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_03: I thought you were not knowing that.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_02: I didn't have a whole lot else better to do at the time.
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_02: It's like between books.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_02: It's a palette cleanser.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_02: You don't have a between books period.
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_02: You know...
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_02: We need to.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't have that.
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_02: I don't have the machine you have.
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_02: You've got an assembly line going.
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_02: And it's a compounding asset.
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_02: I mean, this is the craziest,
[00:25:13] SPEAKER_01: craziest thing about podcasting
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_01: and like a giant amount of why this has worked for us is...
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_01: We do a lot of work that looks a lot like
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: the research and the writing of a book.
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_01: But when we make our book and we release it to the world,
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_01: people click subscribe.
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_01: And so when we release the next one...
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_01: Get the next book.
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_01: Those same people go listen, like it's almost guaranteed.
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_01: We're always going our base.
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_03: Podcasting, being an author,
[00:25:37] there's loose compounding elements to it,
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: but there's not a literal...
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_01: Not nearly what I thought.
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: When I got into the business of writing books,
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_02: I thought there was going to...
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_02: I thought about this a little bit.
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_02: And I...
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_02: You're right.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_02: But you've probably done it better than...
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_01: You're one of the few people who probably does have a...
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_01: But I thought...
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to move around America
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_02: to the various arenas of ambition, Wall Street,
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_02: Silicon Valley, Washington, movie business, sports,
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_02: for various things.
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_02: And I'll naturally attract the audience
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_02: that is interested in that arena.
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_02: And then I'll drag them along to the others.
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_02: And it hasn't really happened that way.
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_02: Even for you.
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_02: Not really.
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_02: Not really.
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_02: The books have a kind of market.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_02: And it's a big market, big-ish market,
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_02: but I see no evidence that I'm dragging people along with me.
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_02: I feel like each book feels like another startup.
[00:26:28] And then I've got to go out and make it happen
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_02: almost as if I've not written one.
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_02: Now that's...
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_03: Moneyball audience is not necessarily...
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_03: Correct.
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_03: ...the fifth risk.
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_03: Exactly.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_02: And the audience is end up just being different.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_02: So it's just the way it is.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_02: But that's not true with you.
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_02: That's not true for our hearts.
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_02: So every time...
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_02: If you were to take time off
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_02: to go do something in Hollywood,
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_02: you'd be abandoning this glorious network.
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_02: The opportunity cost is so high
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_01: of spending a month not making an acquired episode.
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_01: Because when we publish an episode of acquired,
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_01: the base does come with us.
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_01: Put it right on hold.
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_01: We're not all of it.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_01: But like, you know, we make epic systems about healthcare
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_01: and all the people who listen to LVMH
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_01: are now learning how doctors' office IT works.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_01: So podcasts are unique in that it does have that
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_01: true subscriber base.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_01: But unlike anything else where you click subscribe,
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_01: there's not an algorithmic platform
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_01: that disintermediates you.
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_01: I mean, you think YouTube or Twitter or any of these.
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_01: When someone clicks follow or subscribe,
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_01: they're like, it's like signal in the algorithm,
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_01: but it's not guaranteed.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_01: But like, you subscribe in Apple Podcast or Spotify.
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_01: And those people are actually subscribed
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_01: and they're gonna get the next episode.
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_01: And they learn to trust you.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_02: They learn to trust you that if you're interested,
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_02: they'll be interested.
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_02: In fact, if they're buying into,
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_02: it's not the subject, but you're interested in the subject.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_01: And I am terrified of betraying that trust.
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_01: Like anytime we make an episode,
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_01: I think of it as a churn opportunity.
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_01: If we put this in the feed,
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_01: if we don't live up to the expectations
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_01: their listeners have, we will burn them.
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_01: There's a forever.
[00:28:00] In the, why does acquired work framework,
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_03: there's a strong element of terror of what works.
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_03: It's like, we're constantly terrified
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_03: every time we make an episode.
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_03: Every minute is a churn opportunity.
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_01: Are we letting people down?
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_03: All right, listeners.
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_01: Now is a great time to thank our presenting partner,
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_01: JP Morgan Payments.
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_01: And we want to tell you about something pretty cool
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_01: that we just did with them last week,
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_01: which was a big live show in Las Vegas together.
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_03: A acquired residency in Las Vegas, baby.
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_03: No, no, no.
[00:28:32] But what we did do is we took the stage
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_03: at the beautiful Venetian theater at AWS ReInvent.
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_03: We did four really just incredible interviews
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_03: with the CEOs of Netflix, perplexity, AWS,
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_03: and JP Morgan Payments.
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_03: And I will say Ben, it was extra special in retrospect.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_03: We were talking with Greg Peters, the co-ceo of Netflix,
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_03: and asking him how Netflix is reshaping Hollywood,
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_03: just a few hours before they announced
[00:28:56] SPEAKER_03: the Warner Brothers acquisition.
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_03: He has a pretty good poker face
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_03: given that we were in Vegas and all that.
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that he does.
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_01: Also, very funny to interview Matt Garman
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_01: from AWS at his own event.
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_01: And I will say, one of the most interesting conversations
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_01: was with Max Newkirchen, the global co-head
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_01: of JP Morgan Payments.
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_01: We dug into this question that I've always wondered about.
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_01: How did the leading global bank also come to own
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_01: this technology business that does $18 billion a year
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_01: in annual revenue on its own separate
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_01: from the rest of JP Morgan?
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's wild.
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_03: If JP Morgan Payments were a standalone company,
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_03: it would very likely be in the Fortune 500.
[00:29:35] But it's also part of JP Morgan.
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_01: Max also told us about JPM coin,
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_01: developed by ConnectSys by JP Morgan,
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_01: and how it's helped the bank and even JME
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_01: evolve their thinking on how blockchain technology
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_01: is transforming financial infrastructure.
[00:29:49] Overall, it was a great week.
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_03: We hung out at JP Morgan's booth on the show floor
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_03: and got to see their developer portal
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_03: being demoed live in action to customers too.
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_03: Yep, so if you want to learn more about these innovations
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_01: and payments and how JP Morgan can help power your business,
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_01: head on over to JP Morgan.com slash acquired.
[00:30:06] Are you more terrified than you were two years ago?
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_02: Yes, so you grow the territory growing.
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_02: The territory growing.
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_02: At some point it's not going to be a good thing.
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_02: It's good to be a little on edge.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_02: Yes, but you don't want to get into yourself
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_02: in a situation where you feel like
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_02: you have to do the same thing over and over again.
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_02: Because eventually it will get old.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_02: We'll come back.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_02: This is where we're going to get to the bull
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_02: in the bear case at the end.
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay, okay.
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_02: But this is so back to the lesson that you glean
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_02: from Munger and Buffett.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_02: It's okay to have a two-hard pile.
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_02: And you said, and the two-hard pile is like
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_02: doing things in Hollywood.
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_02: But when I asked the question,
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_02: did you ever run across this?
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_02: Have you run across this?
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_02: Have you ever had a subject where you thought,
[00:30:42] ah, this is just too hard to do?
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_02: What would be the example of that?
[00:30:47] We cut pretty far down the line
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_01: on doing an episode on the Fed.
[00:30:50] Yep.
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_01: And walked away from it.
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_01: Yep.
[00:30:53] You said you walked away from it?
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_02: We might come back, but it's been quite a while.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_02: It'll be a moment to come back to it.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_02: I'm glad we didn't do it in the past.
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, now it should be better in the world.
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_02: Although it's going to violate your rule
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_02: about doing newsy things.
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_02: We always try and find things.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_03: Must be timelessness is like a must, must.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_03: Everything we do must be timeless.
[00:31:13] The company we're covering.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_03: Nothing's timeless.
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_02: So what do you mean by that?
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_02: It must be that, like, if you listen to this
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_03: an episode that we make five years after we made it,
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_03: it's 80% as relevant.
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_03: It will still be an important institution in the world.
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_03: A CNBC article is worth 2% of its original value within a month.
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_02: And we want to be worth 80% of our original value
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: five years from now on a given piece of content.
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_01: Well, does that mean you're picking institutions
[00:31:43] SPEAKER_02: that you think will survive?
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_02: So that's like a very, very, very, very volatile
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_02: and your so much of your stuff is tech and finance.
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_02: Where there's so much churn.
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_02: Well, yes.
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_02: This didn't used to be true.
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_01: You look at anything pre-2020, 2021.
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_01: We had not yet discovered this principle.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_01: But our real bangers are timeless and timely.
[00:32:03] Do you in Google this year was timeless and timely?
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_02: Having that, however you do it, that you're
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_02: getting to something that I try to get to when I'm picking
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_02: subjects, but you're doing it in a slightly different way.
[00:32:15] What I like, what gets when my socks start to go up
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_02: and down about a subject, is when I'm really interested
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_02: in it and nobody else is.
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_02: That there aren't people, it's not hot.
[00:32:27] And I found with, I think it's true,
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_02: I basically all my books, maybe a couple of exceptions,
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_02: but a lot of the books, if I'm at a dinner party
[00:32:37] SPEAKER_02: and someone asked me, what are you working on?
[00:32:40] And after about 60 seconds, you can see their eyes glaze over.
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_02: Like, why is he interested in that?
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_02: It's just not registering with them in any way.
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_02: And I've learned just to not even talk about it
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_02: because it kills my interest to watch it kill their interest.
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_02: But I know why I'm interested and why it's important.
[00:32:59] SPEAKER_02: And I'm not relying on the world telling me it's important
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_02: that that's a really good sign.
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_02: This is a difference between what you do and what we do.
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_01: Because I feel like when I think through all your books,
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_01: they're almost always a story of obscurity
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_01: that once it becomes a Michael Lewis book,
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_01: then it becomes a well-known phenomenon.
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_01: Moneyball.
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_01: Like, you are discovering these things
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_01: that kind of nobody's talking about.
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_01: Whereas when we do something like Trader Joe's,
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_01: someone says, what are you working on?
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_01: And we're like Trader Joe's.
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_01: They're like, I love Trader Joe.
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_01: Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_01: So that is a difference.
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_02: Your subjects are not obscure.
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_02: The most famous corporations are people love it,
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_03: but they don't really understand.
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, there's a secret in hiding in plain sight.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_01: People didn't understand Trader Joe's.
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_03: Or people didn't understand Google we thought when we were like.
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_03: There's three things that make a great acquired episode.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_01: One, there's a compelling hero protagonist
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_01: that takes a hero's journey.
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_01: Where we're going from obscurity to ubiquity,
[00:33:58] how it starts as this thing that nobody cares about,
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_01: and then it becomes the most important thing in the world.
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_01: Two is there's a secret hiding in plain sight.
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_01: Like Costco.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_01: I think when the ordinary consumer sees Costco,
[00:34:09] SPEAKER_01: they're like, oh, I love Costco.
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_01: But when someone who's listened to
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_01: the acquired episode on Costco thinks about Costco,
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_01: they see like all the gears turning of the machine.
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_01: Like there has to be some way that we can expose something.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_01: And then our third criteria is it has to be important in the world.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's something we picked up later.
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_01: I mean, we used to do these like little $10 million acquisitions.
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: And now when we're going to go spend
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_01: two months of our life researching and making that like the acquired episode,
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_01: it has to be something worthy of the acquired stage.
[00:34:39] When did that happen?
[00:34:41] So I'm a little unclear.
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_02: Again, getting back to this first episode you did
[00:34:45] SPEAKER_02: and where you are now and the difference between them.
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_02: What sort of propelled you into the current form of acquired?
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_02: The decision to make it a business and the decision to actually live off of
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_02: what you earned from your podcast.
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_02: So it had to work commercially.
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_02: So then you started to make these adjustments.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_02: Is that how it works?
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_02: Yes and no.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_03: You're on the right track.
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_03: I like the Berkshire.
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_03: I thought you were going to say partnership as a lesson from it.
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_03: So we did a series on Sequoia Capital, the venture firm.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_03: Yep.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_03: I went full-time on acquired in 2020.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_03: Five years in, Ben didn't go full-time until January 24, right?
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_03: Correct.
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_03: And a 23 being the 24.
[00:35:29] SPEAKER_01: When I went...
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_01: You were a main equal partners.
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_01: Oh, it wasn't a business we started.
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_01: It was just like, I mean, we made money to our third year.
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_01: But those three years while you're full-time and you're a part-time,
[00:35:38] SPEAKER_02: it was an equal...
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: Yes, David was never once raised the issue.
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_01: I'm depending on this for my livelihood and it's my only thing.
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_01: So I should own more or get a greater share that never once came up.
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_01: That's great.
[00:35:51] SPEAKER_01: It never crossed my mind.
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:35:53] SPEAKER_02: There we go.
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_02: That's an important point.
[00:35:55] You're not...
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_02: I guess I'm glossing over it because it wouldn't even...
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_03: It didn't even cross my mind now.
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_03: It's always been...
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_03: A card has always been the two of us.
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_03: Equal of us.
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_03: It would be profane for it to be anything.
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_03: It would actually break it.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_01: If we ever started trying to figure out like little carve-outs or pieces of the pie.
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_01: Well, I did this.
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_01: Therefore, I should get...
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_01: It's true collaboration.
[00:36:16] You don't recognize there's no boundary where you start and you start.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_02: This is where I'm going with the start.
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_02: It's funny you play out Sequoia because it's actually benchmarking in that way.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_01: It's the quote.
[00:36:25] SPEAKER_03: It's Leonie's quote.
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_03: So, end of 22, FTX happens.
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_03: Injust rates go up.
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_03: Feed all the podcast advertising market.
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_03: You know, false off of cliff.
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_03: Our revenue dropped 40%.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_03: So we went from this wasn't a business.
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_03: I went full-time.
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_03: We made it a business.
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_03: It worked amazingly well.
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_03: From 20 to 20.
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_03: From 20 to 21.
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_03: Into 22.
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_03: And then our revenue dropped 40%.
[00:36:52] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_03: Over night.
[00:36:55] And that was the moment when we changed everything.
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_03: Oh.
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_02: So how many episodes are you making in 2021?
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_02: A lot.
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_02: Oh, I see.
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_02: But it's not no longer just corporate acquisitions.
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_01: We started broadening with the Tesla episode in like 2019.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_01: Maybe 18.
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_01: And why did you broaden?
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_02: It was David's idea.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_01: And he said, I have this thesis that the audience doesn't listen to us because they
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: want to hear if a tech acquisition worked or not.
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_01: They want to hear the story and strategy of the most important technology companies.
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_01: There you go.
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_01: So you were kind of foul hooked the listen to your audience.
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_02: They were listening.
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_02: What's a foul hook?
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_02: When you go fishing and you catch the fish by the belly rather than the mouth.
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_02: So the hook gets in or some weird way.
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_02: You didn't actually catch the fish in the honest way.
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_03: But we get all these emails every time we meet people and they talk about the show.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_03: Like I love the story.
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_03: You guys are just gifted storytellers.
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_03: That's what we hear over and over and over again.
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_03: And eventually we were like, well, we should believe that.
[00:37:59] So I'm going to interject what I noticed.
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_02: Because in that first episode, you were so unsure of yourselves.
[00:38:10] There is.
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_02: You were so choked both of you.
[00:38:13] SPEAKER_02: And you have a background in theater.
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_02: You were a kid at the outdo.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_02: So you did not come across as people who had been on stage.
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_02: It was kind of an affectless performance.
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_02: There was a flatness to it.
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_02: You were afraid to, whether you knew it or not, exhibit a lot of emotion.
[00:38:35] You didn't realize that one of your secret sauces is emotion.
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_02: It's the way you respond to each other when you're presenting material is teaching the
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_02: audience, is helping the audience understand how they should feel about it.
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_02: That you're giving them sometimes very dry facts.
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_02: Like, I don't know.
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_02: Are there revenues doubled every year for 100 years straight?
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_02: And the audience may not know that that's something that requires emphasis.
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_02: That's an incredible thing.
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_02: And the way you respond even sophisticated listeners are helped.
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_02: Oh, pay attention now.
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_02: This was a, that's an important thing.
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_02: I should, I should get excited about that.
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_02: We used to share our research.
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_03: That's what we were doing research in the early days.
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_03: I think we only had a single Google Doc that we worked out.
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_03: We were just dumping everything into the same share document.
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_01: And we were on the show.
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_03: So by the time we would actually go to record the episode, it was still.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_03: There's no surprise.
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, there's no surprise.
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_03: You can pretend to be surprised.
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we can't.
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_02: Or you would be pretending to be surprised.
[00:39:31] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_02: Neither of us were good actors.
[00:39:33] SPEAKER_02: I don't, when did we?
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_02: We did a whole, so that's the thing.
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_02: So this is really important.
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_02: So you added an improvisational component.
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_02: There's another way of putting that.
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_02: You're added risk.
[00:39:43] You're taking risks when you don't know what's going to happen when you come on.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_02: 100% agree.
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_02: Every episode now, going into Recording Day feels like a high wire act because we haven't
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_01: fully scripted it out.
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, I think this is going to come together.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_01: But we had to add this thing called a production meeting about six months ago.
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_01: One week before recording, we are required to get together and share, agree on an episode
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_01: structure, but not share any details.
[00:40:08] SPEAKER_01: A file.
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_01: Because we got so into this improvisation thing that some of our episodes would end and
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_01: you're like, that had no flow to it.
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_01: Like you guys had to complete the work.
[00:40:17] SPEAKER_01: You're not taking the risk.
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_01: You're not taking the risk.
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_01: If it doesn't work sometimes.
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:40:23] But it's the difference between, I mean, do you know how your heart sings when someone
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_02: gets up in a podium with a script with a speech?
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_02: And they're going to read their speech.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_02: The artist is waiting for you to get through this thing because they know nothing is going
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_02: to happen.
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_02: Like, whatever's on that page, that's what's going to happen.
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_02: They're pronouncing the score to the super.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's exactly right.
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_02: And if you get up and you just start talking, the audience also knows, oh my god, this
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_02: could be a disaster.
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_02: They don't know where it's going.
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_02: Having just some of that has a huge effect on the way the audience responds to the performance.
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_02: And so that is not in the beginning.
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_02: Do you remember when we started doing that?
[00:41:03] Well, I think in the first 10 episodes, first five episodes, we got back saying you guys
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_01: need to disagree more.
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_01: But I don't think we quite realize that we should reveal surprises for each other until
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_01: five years ago, four years ago.
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_01: But at some point, we made it an unwritten rule of like, we have separate documents, we
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_03: prepare separately.
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_03: We tried to do like, how about phone calls?
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_03: That was five years ago, you say?
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_02: So the B-Eck call.
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_02: So we start with the corporate acquisitions in 2015.
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_02: And you two, knowing everything that you're going to say when you get on, basically.
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:41:35] SPEAKER_02: And it's short.
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_02: And it's 40 minutes.
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_02: So first.
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_01: And we're not confident.
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_01: And what you're going to do is like, I'm supposed to be doing financial analysis as someone
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_01: who's never been taught how to read a financial statement.
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_01: And so you're also hearing a little bit of like, imposter syndrome.
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_01: I'm trying, I can't get over enthusiastic because I'm afraid David's going to catch me and
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_01: be like, you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_02: So plus, there's an uncertainty about your own abilities.
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_02: So first thing that happens is you move off the corporate acquisitions.
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_02: We went from acquisitions to IPOs, which was unbelievable timing in 2017-18 when Uber,
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_01: Pinterest, Slack, there's like eight IPOs in a row of tech companies that everyone had
[00:42:18] SPEAKER_01: been following.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_01: And then it went really for two years and kind of culminated at the end of 2020 with Door
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_01: Dash and Airbnb, which we recorded and released one day apart.
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_01: Because we wanted to be there on IPO day.
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_01: But once again, you're constraining yourself unnecessarily.
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_02: Eventually you get to, we're just going to do stories.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_02: Big success stories, basically.
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_01: So as acquisitions, IPOs, then it was broad histories and strategies of tech companies
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_01: and then broad histories and strategies of companies, Paul Company.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_01: And people.
[00:42:50] And people with tear swathed.
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: And people with tear swathed.
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_01: And frame them as, yeah.
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_01: We frame them as companies.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_01: In a funny way, you're still constraining yourself.
[00:42:55] SPEAKER_02: You feel like you need this frame.
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_02: And you actually, you're not really living in a frame anymore.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but constraints are good.
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_01: Like format, for yourself and for yourself.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_01: Sure.
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_02: But at some point, you're going to wake up and say, you know, we should be doing more
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_02: biography.
[00:43:09] We should be doing more people.
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_02: And if that person is not, you know, is not naturally a huge corporation, you may still,
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_02: I have a feeling there's more, there's an evolution to come that you're not just seeing.
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_02: There might be.
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_02: You haven't reached like the end point of this.
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_02: So what point do you start to feel confident?
[00:43:29] Like we know what we're doing.
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_02: Well, when the crash, you know, crash, when the reset happened in 2022, 2023.
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_03: So pretty recently.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_03: Crypto bubble, tech stocks, plummet, advertising, advertising budgets kind of dry up and to 2022.
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_03: Ben and I looked at each other and it was like, it wasn't even like really a conversation.
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_03: We just knew what we had to do.
[00:43:52] We watched a lot of other people go for easy, secure money now.
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_01: Try and keep the music playing.
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_03: Just like parties over, we need to get to work.
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_03: We need to focus on only what is enduring and like make great, great, great work and
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_03: stop doing everything else.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_03: Like up into that point, we were, we used to do these things called specials.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_03: We would just do not totally random, but essentially random kind of interviews and
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_03: undifferentiated topics.
[00:44:24] SPEAKER_03: And we said, we need to start making stuff that is only an of one.
[00:44:28] Only we can do will only be great.
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_03: We need to stop doing everything else.
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_03: And we did it on the commercial side too.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_01: We said, let's go cut deals with our favorite partners.
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_01: Get rid of most of our sponsors.
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_01: And try to just figure out when we come out the other side of this that we have like the
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_01: best companies to work with commercially as well as the most durable stories and brands
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_01: associated with us because the editorial side of the house.
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_01: The JP Morgan's are the world.
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_02: Did they join before you proved that this new way of doing it?
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_02: No, we did a year.
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_03: 2023 was the first year.
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_03: And what were those episodes?
[00:45:02] SPEAKER_02: That was LVMH, that was the NFL.
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_03: That was the beginning of what we were doing.
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_03: These long episodes.
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:45:12] SPEAKER_03: And I think that's when we started to build the confidence of like, oh, we can do something
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_03: that isn't it interesting that you grabbed this kind of commercial attention only after
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_02: you went really long.
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:45:24] SPEAKER_03: And so then JP Morgan came in in the January 24.
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_03: So we had to do the year of kind of building this out.
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_03: You're right.
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_01: It was only after we had sort of leaned into acquired as a brand about durability, about
[00:45:39] SPEAKER_01: compounding over decades and, you know, centuries.
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_01: And I don't think I appreciated that as a person in the early days of acquired.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_01: And it certainly wasn't what the show was about.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_02: And we, so I got us a little off track.
[00:45:52] Your lesson number three was Berkshire Hathaway and don't be afraid to have a too hard pile.
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_02: We're going to have a really down of these.
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_02: By frame for all this story was Sequoia.
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_03: So this story is very different than Sequoia.
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_03: But we interviewed Doug Leoni, who was one of the, I guess, two stores ago of Sequoia.
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_03: And he told us that after the dot com crash for the Sequoia fund that was the dot com bubble
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_03: fund, every other venture firm out there after the bubble popped, we're taking Mulligan
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_03: funds.
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_03: They went to their LPs and they said, you know, there's nothing we can do on this one.
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_03: We're going to be more disful next time.
[00:46:34] We said, absolutely not.
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_03: We will never lose money for our investors ever.
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_03: We will do everything we can possibly do to make this fund in the black.
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_03: And he said the best, I think the best line anyone's ever said on acquired.
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_03: He said, we looked at each other and you could burn cigarettes on our arms and we wouldn't
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_03: flinch.
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_03: And they spent the next like five years and raised another fund.
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_03: They just like went to work with the portfolio and they stopped taking fees for a while
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_03: until they were fired.
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_01: They stopped taking fees.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_03: And got it back and it ended up being a positive returning fund.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_03: This is how you get a reputation.
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:47:09] SPEAKER_03: And that was the moment for us.
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_03: And easy to lose one too.
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_02: And so I mean, they were really sensitive to reputation.
[00:47:16] Yeah.
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_01: We had studied enough business by that point where we saw what led to durability.
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_01: And I think we already were awake to the idea that all that matters is the late years
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_01: of compounding.
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_01: Like in any given year you look at a Mag 7 company and their profits from the last year
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_01: are greater than the first 20 years combined or whatever.
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_01: And I think realizing that being around and being respected on the other side of this
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_01: economic chasm is like the key to everything.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_01: Who cares about making money this year?
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_01: That's about 5, 10, 20 years from now.
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_01: And we have to like have the brand that people want to be a part of them.
[00:47:58] Right.
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_02: But you don't know that you are a Mag 7 podcast.
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_02: It's got a ridiculous to compare.
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_02: You know what I'm saying?
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_02: When you make this decision, you don't know that there's going to be great riches 10 years
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_02: out or five years out or three years out.
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:48:15] But really like, I think we were just, we both so believe.
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_03: It was like the burn cigarettes on our arm.
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_03: So believe that that was the right thing to do.
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_03: Something that happened.
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_02: So something that happened up before that.
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_02: You would figure it out how to do this.
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_02: You'd figure it out how to study a business in a way that was really interesting.
[00:48:32] SPEAKER_02: The first episode is not that interesting.
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:48:35] SPEAKER_02: It is just not that much.
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_02: I didn't know, thought of, you know, whatever.
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_02: And I don't know much about that.
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_02: And I don't know much about that.
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_02: And I'm going to tell a story.
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_02: And it's 30 minutes or whatever it is.
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_02: There are now in that first episode that I think there are more ads than there are you
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_02: all te- you two speaking.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_02: But now we pride ourselves on having the lowest.
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_02: So let's just pause here before you get to number four.
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_02: How do you study a business?
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_02: Like what have you learned about how to study a business that's different from when you
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_02: started out?
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_02: Explain to the audience what you do to prepare.
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_02: What you do to learn about a business.
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_02: Great.
[00:49:09] I don't read everything ever about that.
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_02: So you do what I do.
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:49:15] SPEAKER_02: Whatever's out there.
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_02: That's just the AI part of it.
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_01: Who started with canonical?
[00:49:20] SPEAKER_01: Who's done great canonical work in the past.
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_01: And then what ideas do you have from reading the previous canonical work?
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_01: And you know, you then say like, I wonder if I can find this old YouTube video.
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_01: And then those YouTube videos mentioned something else.
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_01: And the spider web always starts with the pre-existing canonical work.
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_01: And what point do you pick up the phone and start calling people who maybe have information
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_02: that isn't on the worldwide web?
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_02: Zero ever until about 2023.
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_01: And now that is the most important way to do that.
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_01: So that's probably about 50% for me.
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_03: It's about 50% of the way through the like start to get your arms around then start calling.
[00:49:55] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[00:49:56] You don't call uninformed.
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_02: You call knowing as much as there is to know.
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_02: And then you start picking the brains of people who might know more and have not said.
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_03: There's like the obvious people to talk to like you know, for Google we talked to, you
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_03: know, Cedar, Demis are like, you know, like obvious.
[00:50:10] SPEAKER_03: Then there's like the less slightly less obvious.
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_03: You just say that so casually.
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_02: Who gets to pick up the phone?
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_02: Well, who's part of the conhounding effect?
[00:50:18] SPEAKER_02: Talk to the CEO of Google about Google.
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_02: I mean, nobody.
[00:50:23] SPEAKER_02: We're in a scale.
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_02: No, nobody.
[00:50:25] SPEAKER_02: We're in a compelling business.
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_02: So the fact that you, when do you first realize that you can pick up the phone?
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_02: That's a good question.
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_02: And call Tim.
[00:50:34] SPEAKER_02: Who are you know that you have?
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_02: You're on this first name basis for all these people.
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_02: When is that so?
[00:50:39] SPEAKER_02: I think it was my Microsoft series when we talked to Steve.
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_03: To Bob.
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_03: Steve, yeah.
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_03: Steve.
[00:50:45] He passed a choir?
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_01: Steve, I love him.
[00:50:48] SPEAKER_02: Name dropping in your world is so different from the name dropping in like Hollywood.
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_02: No, your names mean anything in that.
[00:50:55] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but they mean everything here.
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_02: And the arenas are so funny because like these people aren't, most of them aren't famous
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_01: and they're a thousand to 10,000 times wealthier than, of course, these Hollywood stars.
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:51:08] SPEAKER_03: This is different yard.
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_03: Well, it's funny with Microsoft.
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_03: So we had some acts because Ben used to work in Microsoft before.
[00:51:13] SPEAKER_03: Which got a zero access.
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_03: I don't know, but you knew something like here's in my mind what sort of happened with
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_03: this as I'm trying to think about how to answer Michael's question.
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_03: Because we had started in Seattle and you still live in Seattle and you'd work to Microsoft.
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_03: When we started our Microsoft journey, we knew some people.
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:51:32] SPEAKER_03: That's true.
[00:51:33] SPEAKER_03: We were like, well, let's see if we can talk to Steve.
[00:51:35] SPEAKER_03: And so then we talked to Steve and we got his perspective on things.
[00:51:39] SPEAKER_03: And it completely.
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_03: We can't hold email.
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_03: I think it was.
[00:51:43] I think it was.
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_01: Is that the first time you do that?
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_03: First time we reached that high.
[00:51:47] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:51:49] And you know what?
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_01: This is where reputation matters.
[00:51:51] SPEAKER_01: Steve didn't get back to us for a day and then we heard back and he said, I don't listen
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_01: to podcasts.
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_01: I haven't listened to your podcast.
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_01: I talked to some people.
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_01: But I talked to some people that I trust and they say you're great.
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: So let's hop on a call.
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_01: And we wouldn't have gotten the response back if.
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_03: And he gave us probably three hours, four hours in research for.
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_03: He did.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_02: And you learned a lot.
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_03: Before we even interviewed him, that was later.
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_03: But just in research.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_03: I see.
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_03: And we learned a lot.
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_03: Did you all have a moment where you said, oh my god, let's keep doing that.
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_02: That worked.
[00:52:22] SPEAKER_03: Well, yes.
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_03: So then we were like, that worked great.
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_01: Because it kind of worked with Jensen too.
[00:52:25] SPEAKER_01: So originally when we had the idea in 2021 to do Nvidia, we thought we were like an interview
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_01: show then.
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_01: We thought the interviews would be better than our core storytelling episodes because we
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_01: hadn't discovered that the Ben and David storytelling is our end of one product.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_01: It is the thing that we uniquely can do that no one else can do.
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: And we thought getting these big gets would be the key to success, which is funny because
[00:52:46] SPEAKER_01: usually they underperform our standard format.
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_01: And so in 2021, we emailed Nvidia through the warmest connection we could find and said,
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_01: can we get a company?
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_01: We're planning to come in the company.
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_01: Can we interview Jensen?
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_01: And they said, they gave us a nice party line back.
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_01: He's very busy.
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_01: And then in 2022, we did our Nvidia part one.
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_01: We did our standard research process.
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_01: And I think we did our part two.
[00:53:07] SPEAKER_01: We did part two.
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_01: And note from Nvidia saying Jensen has listened and wants to know who your inside sources are
[00:53:13] SPEAKER_01: because it's the most correct telling of Nvidia story ever.
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_01: And we were like, oh, this was all just public information.
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_01: And if you're good at sputtering the internet and just like digesting it and thinking about
[00:53:24] SPEAKER_01: why he would have said something at this point in time to this audience in these various
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_01: random university talks and stuff, you can kind of piece together the story.
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_01: And so that's just like.
[00:53:34] But you're still flying by radar a bit.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:53:37] SPEAKER_01: But that landed us.
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_01: They were like that started their relationship and eventually.
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_01: Then they're like, I want to meet you and then do you want to do an interview and follow
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_01: up on your episodes?
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_01: But you did an interview episode with them, but it doesn't do as well as your own Nvidia
[00:53:51] episode.
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_02: That one may have been like at some particular peak of Nvidia buzziness.
[00:53:55] SPEAKER_01: So it was probably our then largest episode.
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_01: Well, here's what happens with interviews.
[00:54:00] SPEAKER_01: It makes it look small.
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_03: They spike faster.
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:54:04] SPEAKER_03: And then they go.
[00:54:05] SPEAKER_03: And those listeners don't retain.
[00:54:06] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:54:07] SPEAKER_01: The way that.
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_03: Whereas if you look at our Costco episode, which is now two and a half years old or Helvet
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_03: Mage or Mez Rolex, they just keep going.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_03: They just keep going.
[00:54:19] SPEAKER_03: I'm sure your books are like this.
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_03: Like they just keep going.
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:54:22] Every time I bring out a new book, it has the same effect on the old books that a new
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_02: podcast has on old podcasts.
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it sells all the back list.
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_02: So yes.
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:54:31] SPEAKER_02: So I was asking you how you studied a business.
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_02: You told me you read everything.
[00:54:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_02: So and you must find when you go and read everything there is, you're very polite and you're
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_02: very generous about citing your sources and all that.
[00:54:46] SPEAKER_02: But you must find my wife is an academic.
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_03: My wife has a PhD.
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_03: She was trained as an academic and she was like, you guys got to say your sources.
[00:54:53] SPEAKER_03: Like what are you doing?
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_03: Like, well, yeah, but it's also you.
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_02: Are you ever surprised by the weakness of the source material?
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:55:04] In fact, literally, we are no longer surprised.
[00:55:07] SPEAKER_03: But we got an email from a company that we recently covered saying you said a factually
[00:55:13] SPEAKER_01: incorrect story in the episode and we know the book that you got it from because it
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_01: was factually incorrect in that book.
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_01: We told the author that it was factually incorrect and it went out anyway.
[00:55:21] SPEAKER_01: And now you're repeating the incorrect story.
[00:55:23] SPEAKER_01: And you know, we have now in a rata section where we published our emails.
[00:55:27] SPEAKER_01: And I bet you're mainly correcting other people's errors that you just repeated.
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I'm sometimes there are.
[00:55:33] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes there are.
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes we make a financial calculation error or something like that.
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_02: So we read all source material.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_02: And then we start to make phone calls in 2023.
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_02: And now the phone calls are becoming extremely important and you're making extremely, 25
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_02: of them.
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_01: Google is 40 across the screen.
[00:55:49] SPEAKER_01: 40 across the screen.
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_02: And do you find that when you are reaching out by phone to all these people that they
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_02: always want to talk to you?
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:55:57] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes it makes.
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_01: But usually when you approach it with a spirit of.
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_01: I'm just trying to understand that it's on background.
[00:56:02] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_01: We are going to tell a narrative here.
[00:56:05] Our biggest question to you is what is most misunderstood and what incorrect stories are
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_01: out there where we can set the record straight.
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_01: And you get lots of information after that.
[00:56:15] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
[00:56:16] SPEAKER_02: It's a very good way to go about it.
[00:56:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_02: I do the same thing.
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_02: When I'm researching something, I don't know what the story is for a long time.
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_02: And I'm holding everything very loosely.
[00:56:27] SPEAKER_02: And almost all the relationships I have with people, I'm interviewing is, hey, this is
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_02: all I'm background.
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_02: I just want to try to understand this.
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_02: Can I hop on a call with you?
[00:56:34] SPEAKER_02: And they're usually pretty open to it.
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_02: And I just want to be educated kind of thing.
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_02: And it's a great way to say like, what's a stupid thing people say?
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_02: Because everybody has an opinion.
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_02: But it's not a trick.
[00:56:45] SPEAKER_01: Like, this isn't, here's one cool trick to get people to talk to you.
[00:56:48] SPEAKER_01: I think you mean it earnestly and we mean it earnestly.
[00:56:50] SPEAKER_01: Of like, I want to make something good.
[00:56:52] SPEAKER_01: It's good.
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:56:54] SPEAKER_01: Everybody has different beliefs about the truth.
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_01: But I want to make the story that most correctly approximates the average truth that exists
[00:57:03] SPEAKER_01: from all these different truthy sources.
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_02: I don't think of it quite that way.
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_02: I do think it's like, I want to give you something that's good and pure and true.
[00:57:11] SPEAKER_02: And it's like, it's like the thing that will, once it's said, there's nothing else to
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_02: say.
[00:57:16] SPEAKER_02: It's like done.
[00:57:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_03: I got to imagine for your subjects, I think a big part of us too, is like, there's the
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_03: truthy aspect, which is very, very important.
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_03: But there's also the, like, this is going to be great.
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_03: Like this is going to be really fun.
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_03: This is going to be entertaining to read and people are going to consume it.
[00:57:33] SPEAKER_03: That's I think a huge motivation for our sources.
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_03: Have you, so when you're working on one of these episodes, do you, are you aware of how
[00:57:40] SPEAKER_02: much fun you're having learning and do you ever, have you ever shut something down just
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_02: because, oh, this isn't that much fun?
[00:57:47] The fat.
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_02: Maybe the fat.
[00:57:49] SPEAKER_02: That's how we kill the fed.
[00:57:50] SPEAKER_02: We've definitely killed other episodes.
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_02: If you can find fun in the fed, man.
[00:57:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_02: You are doing it.
[00:57:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_02: We're doing it.
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:57] SPEAKER_02: We're doing it.
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_02: We're doing it.
[00:57:59] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:58:00] SPEAKER_01: We killed Bell Labs because we couldn't find a through line.
[00:58:02] SPEAKER_01: There were so many different stories.
[00:58:03] SPEAKER_01: Ooh.
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_01: So many different characters.
[00:58:05] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_01: We might come back to it.
[00:58:07] SPEAKER_01: Bell Labs.
[00:58:08] SPEAKER_02: That's one that I saw.
[00:58:09] SPEAKER_02: I thought yes.
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_01: I wasn't.
[00:58:11] SPEAKER_01: Mmm.
[00:58:12] SPEAKER_03: It feels like a Michael Lewis book.
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_01: You could kind of do it as the history of the transistor.
[00:58:16] SPEAKER_01: But then you miss all these other things like radar and.
[00:58:20] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:58:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_01: There's so much stuff that came out of Bell.
[00:58:23] SPEAKER_01: Did you do Xerox Park?
[00:58:24] SPEAKER_01: No, no, but someone.
[00:58:25] SPEAKER_01: That's a good.
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_02: It's another one.
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:58:28] SPEAKER_02: I guess Google still has this spirit where they're doing lots of stuff that maybe you can't
[00:58:34] SPEAKER_02: identify instantly the competing.
[00:58:35] SPEAKER_02: Quantum competing.
[00:58:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the payoff that's right around the corner is kind of like, let's just fiddle around
[00:58:40] SPEAKER_02: see what we find stuff.
[00:58:41] SPEAKER_02: I mean, corporate America is, I think, this generally does less of that than it used to
[00:58:45] SPEAKER_02: do a long time ago.
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_02: But the big tech is wrong.
[00:58:48] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_02: No, I'm trying to think that's an interesting.
[00:58:51] SPEAKER_01: So I'm stealing this idea from our friend, Hamilton Helmer, but he brought up this idea
[00:58:57] SPEAKER_01: in conversation with us that there is a positive benefit to monopolies because they create the
[00:59:05] SPEAKER_01: cash flows that fund these sorts of boondoggle basic research.
[00:59:11] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of the most important technologies that move society forward come out of these
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_01: need fat.
[00:59:19] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:59:20] SPEAKER_01: And that's what the boy does Google have that.
[00:59:22] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_01: I mean, their last quarter was their first $100 billion quarter ever, astonishing.
[00:59:27] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: And that's how they fund the next Gemini.
[00:59:31] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, all right.
[00:59:32] SPEAKER_01: Right, right, Waymo.
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_01: And yeah, actually, you just bring up your friend Hamilton Helmer.
[00:59:36] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:59:37] SPEAKER_02: So I had never heard of until I listened to your podcast and you do that thing at the seven
[00:59:39] SPEAKER_02: powers.
[00:59:40] SPEAKER_02: Seven powers, yeah.
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_02: Let's just briefly, since we're here, how you study a business, that has been a useful
[00:59:46] SPEAKER_02: analytical framework for you.
[00:59:47] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:59:48] SPEAKER_02: And I'll never remember any of it.
[00:59:50] SPEAKER_02: That's why we say I'm ever going to work effects and all that.
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:59:55] SPEAKER_02: What is about Hamilton?
[00:59:57] SPEAKER_02: It like, where did you find him?
[01:00:00] SPEAKER_02: And why is he making him so famous?
[01:00:02] SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of good frameworks out there for analyzing business strategy.
[01:00:06] SPEAKER_01: And this one just clicked.
[01:00:07] SPEAKER_01: I just read it and I was like, that is actually the complete list.
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_01: When did you read it?
[01:00:11] SPEAKER_01: You found it.
[01:00:12] SPEAKER_01: I think it was 2020.
[01:00:15] SPEAKER_02: I read the list.
[01:00:16] SPEAKER_02: I read the list.
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_02: And it was all gobbledygook.
[01:00:19] SPEAKER_02: I mean, the words did not mean things.
[01:00:22] SPEAKER_02: But if you bring, if I asked you in plain English, can you brainstorm all the ways in which
[01:00:28] SPEAKER_01: a industry leading company gets away with being more profitable than their competitor and
[01:00:35] SPEAKER_01: gets to keep being more profitable?
[01:00:38] SPEAKER_01: That's the list you would come up with.
[01:00:39] SPEAKER_01: You might find out what creates the moment.
[01:00:41] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:00:43] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[01:00:44] SPEAKER_02: So why did you decide you even needed that framework?
[01:00:47] We, how is it going to end with the durability?
[01:00:51] SPEAKER_01: If you're trying to study why is a business durable, the cause is the power.
[01:00:56] SPEAKER_01: We'd always been searching for a way to land the plane on the episode.
[01:00:59] SPEAKER_03: It's like, we tell this story.
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_03: Yep.
[01:01:02] SPEAKER_03: And we finished the story, but that's so unsatisfying.
[01:01:04] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:01:05] SPEAKER_03: What's the takeaway?
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:01:07] SPEAKER_03: So we've had all various permutations of analysis at the end.
[01:01:10] SPEAKER_03: By or sell or hold.
[01:01:11] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:01:12] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_03: You know, we'd be in Bolambayard and degrading and blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:16] SPEAKER_03: Once we shifted to like, hey, we're studying these great companies, these durable businesses,
[01:01:21] SPEAKER_03: power felt like a really good part of that, like so what?
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:01:27] SPEAKER_03: Why?
[01:01:28] SPEAKER_03: For me, a critical, critical part of process.
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_03: It goes back to writing a senior thesis at Princeton.
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_03: Everything needs to pass through multiple cycles of source material, through my brain,
[01:01:39] SPEAKER_03: through my fingers, onto a keyboard and recycle back through about three times.
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_03: And so like, I don't use AI, no taking, I do write physical notes in hard copy books.
[01:01:50] SPEAKER_03: Like, if I'm not doing that, I feel like it's not gonna work.
[01:01:55] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:01:57] SPEAKER_03: What do you do?
[01:01:58] SPEAKER_02: So I'm exactly the same issue.
[01:02:00] SPEAKER_02: I discovered I wanted to be a writer writing my senior thesis and no ambition to do it before
[01:02:04] SPEAKER_02: then.
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_02: And then all of a sudden I thought, oh my god, I love this.
[01:02:07] SPEAKER_02: And what I love was just that was the constant recycling of the thought.
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_02: So what I do, the process, I don't want to get too far away from your podcast.
[01:02:17] SPEAKER_02: But I think I'm more than a pan.
[01:02:19] SPEAKER_02: So this is a filter.
[01:02:21] SPEAKER_02: Like if I'm talking to you, it takes effort to put it down on the page.
[01:02:24] SPEAKER_02: I don't record anything that I filtered it.
[01:02:27] SPEAKER_02: It's interesting enough to me that it belongs on the page.
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_02: Then I go home and I write the notes up quickly.
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_02: And that's another filter.
[01:02:35] SPEAKER_02: If what's on the page interests me enough to put it in a word document, then I've got
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_02: it's filtered again.
[01:02:42] SPEAKER_02: And I keep those notes while I'm working on a book and the file will be 500 pages along
[01:02:48] SPEAKER_02: by that.
[01:02:49] SPEAKER_02: Maybe longer, by the time.
[01:02:50] SPEAKER_02: And it's just stuff.
[01:02:52] SPEAKER_02: And then I start thinking about, how do you frame the story?
[01:02:55] SPEAKER_02: What is this story?
[01:02:57] SPEAKER_02: But that's months, usually down the road.
[01:03:01] SPEAKER_02: And there are times when I get into something and I am months into it and I realize, there's
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_02: nothing here.
[01:03:06] SPEAKER_02: With Sam Beckman-Freed, I was a year into it.
[01:03:09] And I did not know what I was going to do with it until it blew up.
[01:03:13] SPEAKER_02: And then I thought, oh my God.
[01:03:15] SPEAKER_02: I have the story.
[01:03:17] SPEAKER_01: Do you think you would have-
[01:03:18] Do you think you would have-
[01:03:19] SPEAKER_02: You would have been sitting there for a year watching it other things too?
[01:03:21] SPEAKER_01: I do think you would have published the book if it hadn't.
[01:03:23] SPEAKER_03: Oh no.
[01:03:24] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[01:03:25] SPEAKER_02: You would have killed the book.
[01:03:26] SPEAKER_02: Well, I might have found a way to do it.
[01:03:28] SPEAKER_02: I might have found a way to do it, but I hadn't found a way to do it.
[01:03:30] SPEAKER_02: And it was always the same conversation with my editor.
[01:03:33] SPEAKER_02: It was, I just don't know where this is going.
[01:03:36] SPEAKER_02: I don't know what the end is.
[01:03:37] SPEAKER_02: When I don't know what the end is, I don't know.
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_02: But the beginning is.
[01:03:40] SPEAKER_02: And it's that simple.
[01:03:42] SPEAKER_02: And it wasn't that, oh, I smelled fraud or anything like that.
[01:03:46] SPEAKER_02: It was just, it didn't have shape to it.
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_02: It was just, it was picrastic experience after picrastic experience.
[01:03:52] SPEAKER_02: It was like Don Quixote, but the first chapter over and over and over and over.
[01:03:57] SPEAKER_02: And so there was material there, which is why I kept coming back.
[01:04:00] SPEAKER_02: It was fun.
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_02: There were endless scenes.
[01:04:02] SPEAKER_02: There were, you know, but there was just like, I don't know.
[01:04:05] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but scenes don't make a-
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_02: No.
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_02: Scenes don't make a play.
[01:04:08] SPEAKER_03: No, they're necessarily, they're necessarily but insufficient.
[01:04:10] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_02: So, but the bigger point, I didn't get, I don't want to be talking about me.
[01:04:14] SPEAKER_02: We would be talking about you.
[01:04:15] SPEAKER_02: But this, you are doing, I smell this from your work.
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_02: You're doing something that rhymes with what I do.
[01:04:24] SPEAKER_02: You are gathering before you make judgments.
[01:04:27] SPEAKER_02: You're open to learning things.
[01:04:30] SPEAKER_02: You're trying to be the world's best student.
[01:04:32] SPEAKER_02: You want people to want to teach you.
[01:04:34] And then if you, if people want to teach you, they will teach you.
[01:04:39] SPEAKER_02: And then you could take what you learned and you could present it in the way, the best
[01:04:42] SPEAKER_02: way you can present it.
[01:04:43] SPEAKER_02: I basically take a note in two scenarios.
[01:04:46] SPEAKER_01: One is, oh, I just figured out how that works and that is so cool.
[01:04:53] SPEAKER_01: Like when I learned how-
[01:04:54] SPEAKER_01: You're the master of the like, this is such a cool thing.
[01:04:58] SPEAKER_03: It was like, I-
[01:04:59] SPEAKER_01: You guys are excited.
[01:05:00] SPEAKER_01: This is in some ways irrelevant to the business success of Rolex.
[01:05:03] SPEAKER_01: But it will make my year to explain on air how a mechanical watch works and how an
[01:05:09] SPEAKER_01: escape man is a thing.
[01:05:12] SPEAKER_01: And my excitement around that-
[01:05:14] There's a great moment.
[01:05:15] SPEAKER_01: It is-
[01:05:16] SPEAKER_01: Or the Costco ballet or like, yeah.
[01:05:19] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:05:20] SPEAKER_01: So there's the, I just figured out how something worked.
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_01: And then there's the, I just made a connection.
[01:05:24] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:05:25] SPEAKER_01: It's-
[01:05:26] SPEAKER_01: Like I'll be on a run.
[01:05:27] SPEAKER_01: I'll be listening to an audiobook.
[01:05:28] SPEAKER_01: It'll be the third audiobook that I've listened to about a certain subject.
[01:05:31] SPEAKER_01: And I'll hear something and think, oh.
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_01: That's why- and I'll stop and I'll write my little apple note.
[01:05:38] SPEAKER_01: This timestamp in this book, you know, just realized why-
[01:05:43] SPEAKER_01: I can't think of an example right now, this happened.
[01:05:45] SPEAKER_01: And then later I go and I look it up in the Kindle book and I figure out like how I want
[01:05:48] SPEAKER_01: to explain the connection that I just learned on air.
[01:05:51] SPEAKER_01: But it has to come from the-
[01:05:54] SPEAKER_01: I have to like remember and bottle up my excitement of learning it in that moment to
[01:05:58] SPEAKER_01: share that enthusiasm with the listener.
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:06:01] Yep.
[01:06:02] SPEAKER_02: That's all very familiar to me.
[01:06:04] SPEAKER_02: All right, listeners.
[01:06:06] SPEAKER_01: Now is a great time to tell you about a great friend of the show, Work OS.
[01:06:10] SPEAKER_01: And since we recorded this episode in the garage where Google started, we thought this would
[01:06:14] SPEAKER_01: be a fitting moment to talk about when a startup exits their proverbial garage phase and
[01:06:20] SPEAKER_01: starts to become a real business.
[01:06:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:06:23] Garage is where we're a little more popular back in the day with HP or Apple or in the
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_03: 90s with Google and Amazon all found it in garages.
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_03: Today though, it's more likely an SF apartment or a coffee shop or a hacker house.
[01:06:36] SPEAKER_03: But, you know, the key question remains, what do you do after you find product market fit
[01:06:41] SPEAKER_03: and when you start scaling?
[01:06:42] SPEAKER_03: One big answer is moving up market and finding your first enterprise customers.
[01:06:47] SPEAKER_01: And the best way to do that is Work OS.
[01:06:50] SPEAKER_01: Work OS makes it easy to add all the things that enterprises require, single sign on,
[01:06:55] SPEAKER_01: skim, permissions, audit logs, all with simple drop in APIs.
[01:07:00] SPEAKER_01: It lets you scale revenue bigger and faster earlier in the life of your company or if you
[01:07:04] SPEAKER_01: already have some of this functionality to just simplify your code base.
[01:07:08] SPEAKER_01: As we've been saying all season, this is even more important in the AI era.
[01:07:13] SPEAKER_03: AI products need deep access to sensitive data to be impactful.
[01:07:17] SPEAKER_03: So these security features are just a price of admission for enterprises.
[01:07:20] SPEAKER_01: You really don't want to be late to this.
[01:07:22] SPEAKER_01: We talked on our Google series about even with how successful they are today by initially
[01:07:27] SPEAKER_01: ignoring the enterprise, Google left the door open to competitors for a while.
[01:07:32] SPEAKER_01: Google docs and their original G Suite were so good.
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_01: I mean, amazing productivity apps on the web, but they lacked enterprise features for
[01:07:40] SPEAKER_01: years, leaving the door open for Microsoft to catch up and respond with Office 365.
[01:07:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's funny.
[01:07:46] SPEAKER_03: We were talking with Work OS founder Michael Greenwich about this and he was making an
[01:07:49] SPEAKER_03: impassioned pitch to us that Google should have won the entire web base productivity market
[01:07:55] SPEAKER_03: given they were first and they had better technology.
[01:07:57] SPEAKER_01: Get your enterprise story right early on open AI and Thropic cursor proplexity.
[01:08:02] SPEAKER_01: Sierra, Repplet, Versel hundreds of other AI startups to they all rely on Work OS as their
[01:08:08] SPEAKER_01: enterprise ready, Auth solution and you should too.
[01:08:11] So if you're ready to get started with just a few lines of code for Saml, Skim, Arbach,
[01:08:15] SPEAKER_03: SSO authorization authentication and everything else to please IT admins and their checklists,
[01:08:21] SPEAKER_03: check out Work OS.
[01:08:22] SPEAKER_03: It's the modern software platform to make all this happen.
[01:08:25] SPEAKER_03: That's work OS.com and just tell them that Ben and David sent you.
[01:08:29] So give me a fourth example of lesson learned from an episode.
[01:08:33] SPEAKER_01: This we learned I feel like I learned from Ben Thompson, which is.
[01:08:36] SPEAKER_01: Kelly audience who Ben Thompson is.
[01:08:38] SPEAKER_01: Ben Thompson is the author of Stratekery, provider of Stratekery.
[01:08:42] SPEAKER_01: We did an episode on him and.
[01:08:45] SPEAKER_03: With him a few years ago.
[01:08:47] SPEAKER_01: But his writing is sort of the thing that we bonded over when we met.
[01:08:49] SPEAKER_01: He's a great strategy technology writer.
[01:08:53] A, the internet niches are way bigger than you think they are.
[01:08:58] SPEAKER_01: So if you think you're writing about a niche topic, the internet being a global community
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_01: of fourish billion people means that any little niche, there might be six people in your
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_01: geography that care about it in your local town.
[01:09:12] SPEAKER_01: But there are there's millions of people online.
[01:09:14] SPEAKER_01: And the internet is your way to reach them.
[01:09:16] SPEAKER_01: So no matter how niche you are, it's actually way, way bigger.
[01:09:19] SPEAKER_01: And the corollary to that is in the media business, in podcasting, you can grow your audience
[01:09:26] SPEAKER_01: and thus your revenue and thus your importance in the world.
[01:09:30] SPEAKER_01: All outputs can scale completely independently of your inputs.
[01:09:35] David and I effectively do the same thing that we did not 10 years ago, but two years ago
[01:09:41] SPEAKER_01: to make an episode.
[01:09:42] SPEAKER_01: But the audience has grown so much that like every output from the business is dramatically
[01:09:46] SPEAKER_01: different, even though all the inputs are the same.
[01:09:48] SPEAKER_01: And so we really like took to heart the niche of smart people who care about how these
[01:09:54] SPEAKER_01: businesses work and why the world is arranged in this way is large.
[01:09:58] SPEAKER_01: And we don't have to scale our operation to reach them.
[01:10:00] SPEAKER_01: We just have to keep making the highest quality stuff and giving people reason to share it.
[01:10:07] SPEAKER_01: What is your operation?
[01:10:08] SPEAKER_01: We're in here with a large group of large men.
[01:10:12] And this is a bigger operation.
[01:10:14] SPEAKER_02: But this isn't your normal operation.
[01:10:16] SPEAKER_02: What is your operation?
[01:10:18] SPEAKER_01: I have a basement studio, it's an office that we happen to have some lights at a camera
[01:10:22] SPEAKER_01: in.
[01:10:23] I built a studio in my backyard.
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_03: So that's the YouTube.
[01:10:25] SPEAKER_03: You mention that you send your stuff to an editor without me being the editor.
[01:10:29] SPEAKER_02: His name's Stephen.
[01:10:30] SPEAKER_02: Stephen is Steve's part of a mobile video.
[01:10:34] SPEAKER_01: He does, I'm not sure he'd want us to share on here.
[01:10:35] SPEAKER_01: So Stephen.
[01:10:36] SPEAKER_01: So the mysterious Stephen.
[01:10:37] SPEAKER_01: He's an independent contractor where his only client works only for you.
[01:10:41] SPEAKER_01: He's the best.
[01:10:42] SPEAKER_01: He's the best.
[01:10:43] SPEAKER_01: So he's clearly good at his job.
[01:10:44] SPEAKER_01: He's a maniacal about creating the best audio products and video when we do it.
[01:10:54] SPEAKER_03: But yeah, no assistance, no.
[01:10:56] SPEAKER_03: We do everything.
[01:10:57] SPEAKER_03: You don't sell, you don't have to add sales.
[01:10:59] SPEAKER_02: We do sell.
[01:11:00] SPEAKER_02: We love doing this.
[01:11:01] SPEAKER_02: We love doing this.
[01:11:02] SPEAKER_02: We love doing this.
[01:11:03] You do the right.
[01:11:04] SPEAKER_03: We love doing the business equally as much as we love making.
[01:11:07] SPEAKER_01: And I love the alignment.
[01:11:08] SPEAKER_01: The business and the content are equally important and they're like married.
[01:11:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's funny.
[01:11:13] SPEAKER_01: We're always tempted to just talk about the business because we love the business as
[01:11:17] SPEAKER_03: much as the show, but we never talk about the business.
[01:11:19] SPEAKER_03: So let's just stop here for a moment because I want to talk about this.
[01:11:21] SPEAKER_02: First of all, we move on from Stephen.
[01:11:23] SPEAKER_02: So Stephen is in this rare position basically being the only person who helps you create
[01:11:26] SPEAKER_02: this thing.
[01:11:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:11:28] Yeah.
[01:11:29] SPEAKER_02: How different is the...
[01:11:30] We hired a wonderful production crew because we wanted to have a great video for today.
[01:11:34] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:11:35] SPEAKER_02: How different is what you give...
[01:11:38] SPEAKER_02: What comes out of Stephen from what you give him?
[01:11:42] Eight, nine hours of raw audio with dozens of retakes, sometimes hundreds of retakes.
[01:11:50] SPEAKER_01: We produce each other as we do.
[01:11:51] SPEAKER_01: Hundreds of retakes?
[01:11:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:11:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:11:54] SPEAKER_01: David will say a paragraph and I'll be like, wait, I want to do that in an acquired tone.
[01:11:58] SPEAKER_02: Well, that's amazing.
[01:11:59] SPEAKER_02: Hundreds of retakes.
[01:12:00] SPEAKER_02: Hundreds of retakes.
[01:12:01] SPEAKER_02: You do.
[01:12:02] SPEAKER_02: That's incredible.
[01:12:03] SPEAKER_02: I would have guessed like if you just asked.
[01:12:05] SPEAKER_02: You asked me five.
[01:12:06] SPEAKER_03: Hundreds.
[01:12:07] SPEAKER_03: You sound like a millennial.
[01:12:08] SPEAKER_03: I just want to be appropriately amazed.
[01:12:12] SPEAKER_02: The number of hundreds...
[01:12:13] SPEAKER_02: You can't do hundreds of retakes.
[01:12:14] SPEAKER_01: Literally is that we cut.
[01:12:15] SPEAKER_01: We cut literally all the time.
[01:12:17] SPEAKER_01: Literally.
[01:12:18] SPEAKER_01: I see.
[01:12:19] SPEAKER_01: Totally.
[01:12:20] SPEAKER_01: But the retakes though are a different thing.
[01:12:21] SPEAKER_01: The retakes are...
[01:12:22] SPEAKER_01: We didn't say that clearly enough.
[01:12:23] SPEAKER_03: We didn't land the point.
[01:12:24] SPEAKER_03: I made a point where I wasn't paying enough attention to what David was saying because
[01:12:28] SPEAKER_01: I was like looking over at my notes and then I make the same point and he's like, oh,
[01:12:32] I think you missed it.
[01:12:33] SPEAKER_01: I said that.
[01:12:34] SPEAKER_01: Can you just say the last thing?
[01:12:36] SPEAKER_01: Just give me an aha and then we'll move on.
[01:12:39] SPEAKER_01: Or I explained something in twice the amount of time and David's like getting bored and
[01:12:44] SPEAKER_01: he's like, that was a real monologue.
[01:12:46] SPEAKER_01: I think we got to keep the story moving and I'm like, I agree.
[01:12:50] SPEAKER_01: When I wrote it in my notes, I was really excited about it.
[01:12:53] SPEAKER_01: But now that we're in the moment, I can feel that it's slowing down the energy.
[01:12:56] SPEAKER_01: So let me take two minutes.
[01:12:58] SPEAKER_01: Let me retip some stuff and let me figure out if there's a condensed way to say that so
[01:13:02] SPEAKER_01: that it can flow seamlessly in the energy of the story.
[01:13:06] SPEAKER_01: But that is all in the eight, nine hours of delivery.
[01:13:09] SPEAKER_01: And so he's cutting it in half.
[01:13:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:13:12] SPEAKER_02: And when it comes back to you from him.
[01:13:15] SPEAKER_03: So he turns eight, nine hours of that into an intelligible.
[01:13:19] SPEAKER_03: Into like five-ish?
[01:13:20] SPEAKER_03: I think it's probably appropriate to call it release candidate one to use like a software
[01:13:25] SPEAKER_03: analogy.
[01:13:26] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[01:13:27] SPEAKER_01: So we have five to eight hundred additional cuts to cut another hour off of it.
[01:13:32] SPEAKER_01: And that stuff coming on the page, you're doing it by the page.
[01:13:36] SPEAKER_01: We use a tool called Descript, which we sort of use it not to send it to your reading.
[01:13:43] SPEAKER_03: We are listening to it and we are watching.
[01:13:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah, watch it.
[01:13:46] SPEAKER_01: How long does that take?
[01:13:47] Three days.
[01:13:48] SPEAKER_03: Three days to edit.
[01:13:49] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:13:50] SPEAKER_03: Because we usually do two cycles of that.
[01:13:52] SPEAKER_03: And then do you send it back to him after you've done that?
[01:13:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:13:55] SPEAKER_02: And then we do it again.
[01:13:56] SPEAKER_01: And then you listen to it at 1x and you have to like feel where you get bored or feel
[01:13:59] SPEAKER_01: where you're just like, I don't care.
[01:14:01] SPEAKER_01: Like you have to get so sick of the material where you're just like cutting the bone.
[01:14:05] SPEAKER_01: You're the hero of this.
[01:14:06] SPEAKER_03: I can't break myself to do it.
[01:14:07] SPEAKER_03: I listen to it on two and a half x.
[01:14:09] SPEAKER_03: You're the hero for doing it.
[01:14:11] SPEAKER_03: You don't actually listen to it at normal speed?
[01:14:14] Ah, it's so like Ben really jumps on the grenade for this.
[01:14:19] SPEAKER_03: Almost always.
[01:14:21] You can cut the beginning of almost everything.
[01:14:23] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:14:24] SPEAKER_02: Because it always throat clear.
[01:14:25] SPEAKER_02: I'll be getting it.
[01:14:26] SPEAKER_02: It's always jammed.
[01:14:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, wind up.
[01:14:28] SPEAKER_02: You don't need it.
[01:14:29] SPEAKER_02: You just go right to it.
[01:14:30] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:14:31] SPEAKER_02: And then once I start to feel like it's taught, I just love it.
[01:14:34] SPEAKER_02: I love it.
[01:14:35] SPEAKER_02: I like it.
[01:14:36] SPEAKER_02: The hardest thing is getting the stuff out in the first place.
[01:14:38] SPEAKER_02: And then once it's out on the page, then you could start, ah, each time it gets better.
[01:14:43] SPEAKER_02: I find there's no despair associated with it.
[01:14:46] SPEAKER_02: And there's stuff in the original draft that is a remnant of the point you thought you
[01:14:50] SPEAKER_01: were going to make.
[01:14:51] SPEAKER_01: And by the time you get to the end, you're like, that's actually not the important thing
[01:14:55] SPEAKER_01: here.
[01:14:56] SPEAKER_01: I no longer need that whole setup or that, that, or the idea of all kinds of other ways.
[01:15:01] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:15:02] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:15:03] SPEAKER_02: But it's important that you had the idea, but it's buried in the story some which way.
[01:15:07] Yeah.
[01:15:08] SPEAKER_01: David will often highlight something and go at Ben, okay, to cut, belaboring.
[01:15:12] So the minute you're there, you know it's got to be cut.
[01:15:15] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:15:16] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, mostly right.
[01:15:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:15:18] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:15:19] SPEAKER_02: So you get five hours down to whatever it is, three and a half, four.
[01:15:23] SPEAKER_03: Three and a half is the sweetest.
[01:15:24] SPEAKER_03: And how do you know when you're done?
[01:15:26] We run out of time.
[01:15:27] Deadline.
[01:15:28] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:15:29] SPEAKER_03: So that's, yeah.
[01:15:30] SPEAKER_03: Deadline is like your year.
[01:15:31] SPEAKER_03: You're never really done.
[01:15:32] SPEAKER_01: I would love one more at it.
[01:15:33] SPEAKER_01: We'd always, there's always more.
[01:15:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:15:35] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:15:36] SPEAKER_03: We have both the gift and the curse of Deadline in the next episode coming, whereas like
[01:15:40] SPEAKER_03: you have an infinite timeline, right?
[01:15:43] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no.
[01:15:44] SPEAKER_02: I have, I mean, I owe a book on June the 1st.
[01:15:46] SPEAKER_02: It will come out September the 29th that I will start writing on January the 5th.
[01:15:51] SPEAKER_02: And I will write it in five chunks and each chunk will be delivered at the end of the
[01:15:54] SPEAKER_02: month.
[01:15:55] SPEAKER_02: And I won't be able to go back.
[01:15:57] SPEAKER_03: So what happens if you get to June and you're like, no, I'm not a, can't, can't.
[01:16:02] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[01:16:03] SPEAKER_03: So it's a hard death.
[01:16:04] SPEAKER_03: It's a dead one.
[01:16:05] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:16:06] SPEAKER_02: But I always find, I, once I established that deadline, which is a reasonable deadline
[01:16:08] SPEAKER_02: because I've done all, spent a year doing the work.
[01:16:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:16:12] SPEAKER_02: I have the material.
[01:16:13] SPEAKER_02: By the way, it's very polite of you to ask me questions about myself.
[01:16:15] SPEAKER_02: But it's like this.
[01:16:18] SPEAKER_02: No, but it's somehow, if you take your deadline seriously, that's the key.
[01:16:25] SPEAKER_02: You take the deadlines deadly seriously.
[01:16:28] SPEAKER_02: And you just refuse to violate them.
[01:16:31] SPEAKER_02: Then you're serious when you establish them and your mind just finishes when it needs
[01:16:37] SPEAKER_02: to finish.
[01:16:38] SPEAKER_02: I, and I'm always like a couple of days ahead of it.
[01:16:40] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:16:41] SPEAKER_02: So I would talk a little bit about the business side because this is something that I
[01:16:44] SPEAKER_02: certainly don't know anything about in your lives.
[01:16:47] SPEAKER_02: But you turn this into a very lucrative franchise and you go out and you, and unlike most podcasts,
[01:16:52] SPEAKER_02: you don't, you don't subcontracting the sale of ads to some other company and you're
[01:16:58] SPEAKER_02: not just promiscuous in who you have as advertisers.
[01:17:02] SPEAKER_02: So you have two or three, four, whatever it is, major advertisers.
[01:17:06] SPEAKER_02: You've got every season.
[01:17:08] SPEAKER_02: And some stability there, when you go, walk me through, pretend, Michael Lewis Inc. is
[01:17:17] SPEAKER_02: your target that you want me to be a, like the anchor tenant in your building.
[01:17:23] SPEAKER_02: And you're coming in to tell me why I should do this.
[01:17:26] SPEAKER_02: Give me a, give me a sense of it with that list.
[01:17:29] SPEAKER_02: Well, I'll, David, give you the sales pitch.
[01:17:31] SPEAKER_01: The philosophy of the whole thing comes from we want to create a durable business on
[01:17:35] SPEAKER_01: our side and a great listener experience on the listener side.
[01:17:39] SPEAKER_01: And I always feel as a listener so disrespected when there is this content of the podcast
[01:17:45] SPEAKER_01: that is diamond quality.
[01:17:47] SPEAKER_01: And then there's a record scratch.
[01:17:50] SPEAKER_01: McDonald's ads in the middle.
[01:17:52] SPEAKER_01: Usually not read by the host, usually with some jingle playing underneath.
[01:17:56] SPEAKER_02: It bothers the hell out of me too and I haven't been able to do anything about it.
[01:17:59] SPEAKER_02: I agree.
[01:18:00] SPEAKER_02: And I, it's, it's the biggest complaint I get about in my podcast.
[01:18:05] SPEAKER_02: It's like, I got to listen to these ads.
[01:18:08] SPEAKER_01: The very first ad we ever sold when we said, what sponsor could we get that would make
[01:18:13] SPEAKER_01: people perceive acquired to be a higher quality brand?
[01:18:17] SPEAKER_01: So we could like have our cake and eat it too.
[01:18:19] SPEAKER_01: We'll get.
[01:18:20] SPEAKER_01: I had a thought about this on mine and no one ever took me up on it.
[01:18:23] SPEAKER_02: Really?
[01:18:24] SPEAKER_02: Just find the things I actually use and I'll, and it will be fun to talk about them.
[01:18:29] SPEAKER_02: I want to, I want to tell the whole world about ex officio underpants.
[01:18:33] SPEAKER_02: And I can't get ex officio to return my calls.
[01:18:37] SPEAKER_02: I mean, that kind of thing foolish.
[01:18:38] SPEAKER_02: I just, sleep with it.
[01:18:40] SPEAKER_02: I don't, literally, you tell me that Michael Lewis, I didn't hear it from you.
[01:18:44] SPEAKER_03: I didn't, I just gave them a, I gave my podcast away.
[01:18:47] SPEAKER_02: A list of things that I really love, just love.
[01:18:50] SPEAKER_02: Oh, you got to call them, that's the problem.
[01:18:52] SPEAKER_03: And well, that probably is the problem.
[01:18:54] SPEAKER_02: I would already, my podcast company does not, does not actually sell ads.
[01:18:59] SPEAKER_02: Another company sells the ads.
[01:19:01] SPEAKER_02: And so it's just, I, that, I thought that was the way to make a seamless is actually,
[01:19:05] SPEAKER_02: inner, what's inner world's my life will be the things that we're talking about.
[01:19:08] SPEAKER_02: So that is a structural blocker to creating the best experience.
[01:19:14] SPEAKER_01: And everything has a trade off.
[01:19:16] SPEAKER_01: The trade off for us is we spend an enormous amount of time engaging with our sponsors.
[01:19:20] SPEAKER_01: We write a custom read for every single sponsor, every single episode.
[01:19:23] SPEAKER_01: We try to write it as if we're almost like talking about what we think is interesting
[01:19:28] SPEAKER_01: about the business.
[01:19:29] SPEAKER_01: And this like mini two minute analysis.
[01:19:31] SPEAKER_01: And you know, there's some horse trading there of we have to make these points, okay?
[01:19:34] SPEAKER_01: But like for the most part, and the best sponsor relationships are the ones where they say
[01:19:38] SPEAKER_01: like, yeah, your listeners are going to respond the best to what you have to say.
[01:19:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:19:44] SPEAKER_03: So if you're Michael Lewisink, we want you to be a sponsor.
[01:19:46] SPEAKER_03: I would say, we're not coming to pitch you, but like we're deciding a year in advance.
[01:19:52] SPEAKER_03: Now two.
[01:19:53] SPEAKER_03: When we're, when we're now two years in advance, like what do we want our sleigh of
[01:19:57] SPEAKER_03: partners to look like?
[01:19:58] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:19:59] SPEAKER_03: So we start like Lewisink, we think is going to be super strategic for us in 2027, 2028.
[01:20:05] We start planning like, okay, how are we going to make this happen?
[01:20:09] How are we going to make sure that we really, you, you, you, Michael Lewisink is as good
[01:20:13] SPEAKER_03: as we think it could be.
[01:20:14] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:20:15] SPEAKER_03: How are we going to make sure that we're going to work really well together, that you're
[01:20:16] SPEAKER_03: going to see massive ROI from us?
[01:20:18] SPEAKER_03: At any point, do you sit there worrying that you're compromising the, you know, the, the
[01:20:23] SPEAKER_02: shows because of your, the relationship you're about to have with an advertiser?
[01:20:27] SPEAKER_01: No.
[01:20:28] SPEAKER_01: It's been companies that don't feel Switzerland enough that come to us that want to sponsor
[01:20:33] SPEAKER_01: and we just like the idea of not picking a venture capital firm to say we think this is
[01:20:40] SPEAKER_01: the best venture capital firm.
[01:20:42] SPEAKER_01: It's like too much of a picking team.
[01:20:44] SPEAKER_01: What do you think?
[01:20:45] SPEAKER_02: I've never heard anybody say that.
[01:20:46] SPEAKER_02: They don't feel Switzerland enough.
[01:20:47] SPEAKER_02: Is this a, is this a cliche in the VC?
[01:20:50] SPEAKER_02: No, I think that's good.
[01:20:51] SPEAKER_02: That's a long line.
[01:20:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:20:53] SPEAKER_02: So you're looking for Switzerland's.
[01:20:54] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:20:55] SPEAKER_01: And what do you mean by that?
[01:20:57] SPEAKER_01: It's that we think are great where we don't have to take a side in like a big contentious
[01:21:03] SPEAKER_01: current thing conversation.
[01:21:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:21:05] SPEAKER_01: Well, the industry doesn't take, Coca-Cola.
[01:21:08] We don't really deal with, because we don't, so I was number one.
[01:21:10] SPEAKER_01: Okay, here we go.
[01:21:11] SPEAKER_03: B2B companies with high, very high LTV products.
[01:21:15] SPEAKER_03: So not, not, not, not ex officio underwear.
[01:21:17] SPEAKER_02: Basically, we want companies that are doing a significant number of multi-million dollar
[01:21:23] SPEAKER_03: annual deals with customers, because we want to feel like we can deliver a couple incremental
[01:21:28] SPEAKER_03: of those for you.
[01:21:29] SPEAKER_03: And so you can charge lots of money.
[01:21:31] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and then like it's just a no brain.
[01:21:33] SPEAKER_03: Many of our sponsors have been ROI positive on signing one large customer who heard about
[01:21:39] SPEAKER_01: them on acquired.
[01:21:40] SPEAKER_01: That is awesome.
[01:21:41] SPEAKER_01: And often it's not even just heard about on acquired.
[01:21:43] SPEAKER_03: It's events are a big part of this.
[01:21:46] SPEAKER_03: So we do events with almost all of our sponsors.
[01:21:48] SPEAKER_03: So there's the funnel of like heard about on acquired that helps, but then like we're
[01:21:51] SPEAKER_03: doing an event together with them, we're sitting next to your their best prospects.
[01:21:56] SPEAKER_03: So I'm thinking about hiring you.
[01:21:58] SPEAKER_02: What kind of event will you do for me?
[01:22:00] SPEAKER_02: We're happy to join for a customer dinner.
[01:22:02] SPEAKER_01: We're happy to speak at your big annual customer conference.
[01:22:06] SPEAKER_01: We're happy to give this fit.
[01:22:08] SPEAKER_01: We're happy to go to a sporting event with you with your top clients.
[01:22:12] SPEAKER_03: We're happy to...
[01:22:13] SPEAKER_03: At that sporting event, will you do like some...
[01:22:15] SPEAKER_02: Fireside chat.
[01:22:16] SPEAKER_02: Fireside chat.
[01:22:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:18] SPEAKER_02: Interviewer CEO.
[01:22:19] SPEAKER_03: I'll give you a legend from the sport.
[01:22:21] SPEAKER_03: How many hours of your time am I going to get?
[01:22:23] SPEAKER_02: A couple days.
[01:22:24] SPEAKER_03: A couple.
[01:22:25] SPEAKER_03: We're there.
[01:22:26] SPEAKER_03: And while we're there with you, it's like...
[01:22:27] SPEAKER_03: We're there with you.
[01:22:28] SPEAKER_03: How can you maximize using us?
[01:22:29] SPEAKER_03: You promised to be my friend.
[01:22:30] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, of course.
[01:22:31] You'll be my friend too in the bargain.
[01:22:32] SPEAKER_02: Oh, we're great friends with the whole bunch of...
[01:22:35] SPEAKER_03: Okay, so then it gets even better.
[01:22:36] SPEAKER_03: So we...
[01:22:37] SPEAKER_03: Let me tell you more.
[01:22:38] SPEAKER_03: Tell me more.
[01:22:39] SPEAKER_03: I'm getting interested.
[01:22:40] SPEAKER_03: I'm in the edge of my seat here.
[01:22:42] SPEAKER_01: The reason this whole thing works is the people who listen to acquired the most valuable
[01:22:46] SPEAKER_01: audience in the world.
[01:22:47] SPEAKER_01: And so if you want to market your B2B software or financial product or whatever to them...
[01:22:53] SPEAKER_01: Founders are executive decision makers.
[01:22:56] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:22:57] SPEAKER_03: But really, I'm going to take a step back.
[01:22:58] SPEAKER_03: I think the whole business side...
[01:23:00] SPEAKER_03: And that's a lot of the content too.
[01:23:02] SPEAKER_03: But the whole business side of acquired starts with...
[01:23:04] SPEAKER_03: We were venture capitalists.
[01:23:06] SPEAKER_03: We're not media people.
[01:23:08] SPEAKER_03: So we have just always taken an approach.
[01:23:10] SPEAKER_03: You're aspiring to be a great partner to them.
[01:23:13] SPEAKER_03: You're going to help recruit employees.
[01:23:15] SPEAKER_03: You're going to help with whatever.
[01:23:16] SPEAKER_03: So we just like...
[01:23:17] SPEAKER_03: Great, that's how we approach our partners.
[01:23:19] SPEAKER_03: Why do you think...
[01:23:20] SPEAKER_02: Maybe you've just answered the question.
[01:23:22] SPEAKER_02: Why do you think no other podcast has approached their business in the way you approach your
[01:23:25] SPEAKER_02: business?
[01:23:26] SPEAKER_02: I think we just came at it from...
[01:23:28] SPEAKER_03: You think you have a little space?
[01:23:29] SPEAKER_03: You think you have a little space?
[01:23:30] SPEAKER_02: A little space.
[01:23:31] SPEAKER_02: A little space.
[01:23:32] SPEAKER_02: A little space.
[01:23:33] SPEAKER_02: A little space.
[01:23:34] SPEAKER_01: A little space.
[01:23:35] A little space.
[01:23:36] SPEAKER_01: A little space.
[01:23:37] SPEAKER_01: A little space.
[01:23:38] SPEAKER_01: A little space.
[01:23:39] SPEAKER_01: Okay, here's a take.
[01:23:40] SPEAKER_01: The media business model of splitting the commercial activity from the editorial is a societal
[01:23:44] SPEAKER_01: benefit that we all benefit from publications like the New York Times.
[01:23:48] SPEAKER_01: It is...
[01:23:49] SPEAKER_01: It was really good for journalism.
[01:23:50] SPEAKER_01: It was really good for journalism that exists.
[01:23:52] SPEAKER_01: The rest of the media seems to have adopted it and everyone doesn't need to.
[01:23:59] If we're the host of acquired, it's kind of great if you're going and learning about
[01:24:02] SPEAKER_01: your sponsors' business and working with them and trying to build partnerships with them.
[01:24:07] SPEAKER_01: It was almost like we had the luxury of getting to rethink what our operational model
[01:24:12] SPEAKER_01: looks like.
[01:24:13] SPEAKER_03: The thing they brought it full circle a couple years ago is we added an investment fund.
[01:24:18] SPEAKER_03: Not our public company sponsors, but almost all of our private companies' sponsors.
[01:24:22] SPEAKER_03: We invested them.
[01:24:23] SPEAKER_03: So it came full circle.
[01:24:24] SPEAKER_02: You created an investment fund.
[01:24:25] SPEAKER_02: You two are...
[01:24:26] SPEAKER_02: You're the ones who are making investments.
[01:24:28] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:24:29] SPEAKER_02: How you do it?
[01:24:30] SPEAKER_02: It's quite full circle.
[01:24:31] SPEAKER_02: We're only a year in, but we've invested in five of our sponsors and several of them
[01:24:36] SPEAKER_01: are more valuable than when we've invested.
[01:24:40] SPEAKER_03: We asked ourselves, we're like, how do we do this?
[01:24:42] SPEAKER_03: The focus is the show.
[01:24:43] SPEAKER_03: For a venture capital firm with the podcast, it doesn't work.
[01:24:45] SPEAKER_03: We need to be a podcast for the venture capital firm.
[01:24:47] SPEAKER_03: The way we make this work is we just invest in our sponsors.
[01:24:50] SPEAKER_03: We put all this work into finding the best partners for our sponsors in every category
[01:24:55] SPEAKER_03: that we think are great.
[01:24:56] SPEAKER_03: Why wouldn't we just invest in them?
[01:24:57] SPEAKER_03: We don't do any incremental work.
[01:24:58] SPEAKER_03: You invest in all of your sponsors?
[01:24:59] SPEAKER_01: No, but a lot of the time, we'll just get a call.
[01:25:02] SPEAKER_01: Hey, we're raising it up round.
[01:25:04] SPEAKER_01: We want to talk about it in the next ad read and we say, oh, that's cool.
[01:25:06] SPEAKER_01: Can we invest a couple million dollars?
[01:25:08] SPEAKER_01: We're like, the round's like 300 million.
[01:25:11] SPEAKER_01: No one on the cap table is going to care and we love it.
[01:25:14] SPEAKER_01: You're more aligned with us now.
[01:25:15] SPEAKER_01: So we'll make room.
[01:25:16] SPEAKER_01: So you're only really accepting as sponsors companies that you would like to invest in.
[01:25:21] SPEAKER_02: That's essentially the frame we put on the whole thing.
[01:25:23] SPEAKER_03: It's not a perfect.
[01:25:24] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but JP Morgan is not an example.
[01:25:26] SPEAKER_01: Right, right.
[01:25:27] SPEAKER_01: We think we like having a couple public companies to eat.
[01:25:30] SPEAKER_03: Be Morgan, Shopify, ServiceNow.
[01:25:32] And how deep is this market?
[01:25:34] SPEAKER_02: How many acquires could be created on the back of this business model?
[01:25:38] SPEAKER_02: Oh, I think a lot.
[01:25:39] SPEAKER_01: The question that I'm always wondering is why aren't there more acquires out there?
[01:25:43] SPEAKER_01: I'm asking that question now.
[01:25:44] SPEAKER_01: The format.
[01:25:45] SPEAKER_01: Why?
[01:25:46] SPEAKER_01: Here's the ingredients.
[01:25:47] Two hosts that independently go to research and through storytelling, like narrative storytelling
[01:25:52] SPEAKER_01: and analysis, create a conversational audiobook.
[01:25:56] SPEAKER_01: Could be about businesses.
[01:25:57] SPEAKER_01: Could be about sports teams.
[01:25:59] SPEAKER_01: Could be about political parties.
[01:26:01] SPEAKER_01: Political parties.
[01:26:02] SPEAKER_01: Could be about any.
[01:26:03] SPEAKER_01: Any arena of ambition as you would say.
[01:26:06] There should be unacquired in all these other verticals.
[01:26:10] SPEAKER_01: In fact, the business verticals.
[01:26:11] SPEAKER_01: Because there's a lot more money in business.
[01:26:14] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:26:15] SPEAKER_01: In tech and finance.
[01:26:16] SPEAKER_01: I think there's a bit of a cold start.
[01:26:18] SPEAKER_03: If you were to propose going and creating an acquired for sports, you would, the sort
[01:26:26] SPEAKER_03: of risk, I guess we took.
[01:26:27] SPEAKER_03: We didn't think about it as risk at the time because it was just a hobby.
[01:26:30] SPEAKER_03: You're looking at years of no or little monetization.
[01:26:35] SPEAKER_03: Because it's going to take a long time to build up the audience.
[01:26:39] SPEAKER_03: Versus, oh, I could go join a network.
[01:26:41] SPEAKER_03: I could make a show on the ringer.
[01:26:42] SPEAKER_03: I could do whatever.
[01:26:44] SPEAKER_03: Acquired as path dependent on us having day jobs.
[01:26:47] SPEAKER_01: For sure.
[01:26:48] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[01:26:49] And day jobs in the industry that you're going to cover.
[01:26:52] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[01:26:53] SPEAKER_01: We built half the relationships and all the know-how and all the shorthand from being in the
[01:26:58] SPEAKER_01: industry before.
[01:27:00] So I asked you how many acquires could be created in just your space.
[01:27:06] What percentage of the advertising revenues do you think you're hoovering up in the way
[01:27:11] SPEAKER_02: you're hoovering them up?
[01:27:12] SPEAKER_02: In business, business, business, business, business, business, business.
[01:27:16] SPEAKER_02: The things you pick, the kind of people you will accept as your sponsors.
[01:27:20] SPEAKER_02: How many times are there over there?
[01:27:22] SPEAKER_02: Fortunately, there are a lot more people who want to sponsor acquired than that.
[01:27:26] SPEAKER_03: That's what I mean.
[01:27:27] SPEAKER_03: How many more are there?
[01:27:28] SPEAKER_03: A lot.
[01:27:29] We're probably three or four X oversubscribed on people who really could convert on becoming
[01:27:36] sponsors if we said, sure, we'll take you.
[01:27:38] SPEAKER_01: How come you don't spawn an extra acquired or two?
[01:27:41] SPEAKER_02: Why don't you create the next use?
[01:27:47] SPEAKER_02: Then we're not acquired.
[01:27:48] SPEAKER_02: Then we're not us.
[01:27:50] SPEAKER_03: I say, do less.
[01:27:51] SPEAKER_03: Then we become CEOs.
[01:27:52] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:27:53] SPEAKER_03: But do not want to build.
[01:27:54] SPEAKER_02: No, it's funny.
[01:27:55] SPEAKER_02: There's a line that you don't have bosses.
[01:28:02] You have incentives, but you don't have bosses.
[01:28:05] SPEAKER_02: And we're not other people's bosses.
[01:28:07] SPEAKER_01: That's my life, too.
[01:28:08] SPEAKER_02: I have a lot of incentives.
[01:28:09] SPEAKER_02: I have no bosses.
[01:28:10] SPEAKER_02: When you're in any kind of creative thing, there is this benefit to not just following the
[01:28:16] SPEAKER_02: financial incentives and not trying to milk every last penny out of it and to creating
[01:28:24] SPEAKER_02: any scarcity, not just for the sake of the scarcity, but for the sake of the quality.
[01:28:29] SPEAKER_02: And only do it if it's great.
[01:28:32] SPEAKER_02: If you only do it, it's a long-term strategy.
[01:28:34] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it's not that I think all my books are great.
[01:28:38] SPEAKER_02: I don't write them though unless I think they're going to be great.
[01:28:40] SPEAKER_02: I just don't.
[01:28:41] SPEAKER_02: Why would you allocate?
[01:28:42] SPEAKER_01: Let's say you have a portfolio of however many more years you think you're going to write
[01:28:46] SPEAKER_01: 20, 30.
[01:28:47] SPEAKER_01: Why would you allocate?
[01:28:48] SPEAKER_01: I don't know how long I live.
[01:28:49] SPEAKER_01: A year.
[01:28:50] SPEAKER_01: A year and a half.
[01:28:51] SPEAKER_01: So that's a huge slot.
[01:28:52] SPEAKER_01: A bad one.
[01:28:53] SPEAKER_02: That's a gaping whole.
[01:28:54] SPEAKER_02: Well, I give you a reason why some people might publish or offers me gazillion dollars to
[01:29:00] SPEAKER_02: write a book about X.
[01:29:02] SPEAKER_01: And how much?
[01:29:03] SPEAKER_02: I know the book's going to suck because it's not actually a good idea for a book.
[01:29:05] SPEAKER_02: And it's not going to be fun to do because all the fun is and it may be great.
[01:29:09] SPEAKER_01: Is there any chance any of those dollars make your life better?
[01:29:12] SPEAKER_01: No.
[01:29:13] SPEAKER_02: At this point.
[01:29:14] Zero.
[01:29:15] SPEAKER_02: So this is the thing people miss.
[01:29:16] What is Lane Kiffing going to get out of an extra couple of million dollars going
[01:29:19] SPEAKER_02: to LSU from all of this?
[01:29:21] SPEAKER_02: The average athlete who's taking a few million dollars more to move is wife and kids from
[01:29:25] SPEAKER_02: one family to one city that loves him and that he loves to some strange place where everybody's
[01:29:30] SPEAKER_02: going to be unhappy.
[01:29:31] People do this all the time.
[01:29:32] SPEAKER_02: All dollars do not have equivalent value.
[01:29:35] SPEAKER_01: The marginal dollars have way smaller value than the early dollars.
[01:29:39] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes they end up having kind of negative value.
[01:29:42] And you become a person who that's what you're about.
[01:29:44] SPEAKER_02: It's like you're saying I'm going to be the person who just follows the financial incentives.
[01:29:48] SPEAKER_02: And then I'm going to control the, I'm going to let these incentives do, they could be
[01:29:52] SPEAKER_02: useful.
[01:29:53] SPEAKER_02: They get you out of bed in the morning for a while.
[01:29:55] SPEAKER_02: But you have to kind of control them.
[01:29:58] SPEAKER_02: So I love that you're not milking the market.
[01:29:59] SPEAKER_02: I think there's two different things that we're talking about here.
[01:30:02] SPEAKER_03: One is milking the market, yes or no.
[01:30:05] SPEAKER_03: The other one is do you want to build an enterprise or do you want to stay a boutique?
[01:30:11] SPEAKER_03: So like to your question for us, why don't we create more of wires?
[01:30:14] SPEAKER_03: Like we don't want to manage other shows, podcast hosts.
[01:30:17] SPEAKER_03: People often tell us like, oh, you're building this business.
[01:30:20] SPEAKER_01: You guys are sort of foolish because there's those are all this key man risk.
[01:30:23] SPEAKER_01: Like you're building this great business.
[01:30:25] SPEAKER_01: But if either of you leave, your business has low enterprise value.
[01:30:29] SPEAKER_01: And we're like, okay, but if we sold this business, then we would just go start acquired.
[01:30:34] SPEAKER_01: Like we're already doing the dream.
[01:30:38] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the dream is what we're doing.
[01:30:40] SPEAKER_02: All right, so I took us off on a sidetrack.
[01:30:41] SPEAKER_02: We've only gotten through four.
[01:30:42] SPEAKER_02: I want to hear the fifth.
[01:30:44] SPEAKER_02: We've gotten like five or seven.
[01:30:45] SPEAKER_02: We've got to.
[01:30:46] SPEAKER_02: What's the fifth?
[01:30:47] SPEAKER_02: Founder control was my huge one.
[01:30:51] SPEAKER_01: Is this from Google?
[01:30:52] I think we look.
[01:30:53] SPEAKER_01: We met again.
[01:30:54] SPEAKER_01: This is one of these things that we like learned early, but then got reinforced through
[01:30:58] SPEAKER_01: episodes.
[01:30:59] SPEAKER_01: Meta, Rolex, Trader Joe,
[01:31:01] SPEAKER_01: Karnakia.
[01:31:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:31:03] SPEAKER_01: Like stay private, be family owned.
[01:31:05] SPEAKER_01: You don't even have to take that.
[01:31:06] SPEAKER_01: Meta's public company, but yeah, founder control.
[01:31:09] SPEAKER_01: I mean, Google, Google's founder control.
[01:31:12] The important things in the world probably should be big publicly traded corporations.
[01:31:15] SPEAKER_01: But like there's these amazing, wonderful things you can create by being boutique and maintaining
[01:31:20] SPEAKER_01: control.
[01:31:21] SPEAKER_01: I think there's an argument you may, that in any industry where they're both private and
[01:31:24] SPEAKER_02: public companies, the private companies end up being a much better run.
[01:31:27] SPEAKER_02: And I mean, like that mostly bad things happen when companies go public and certainly less
[01:31:32] SPEAKER_02: pleasant.
[01:31:33] SPEAKER_02: So public or private, your point is founder control.
[01:31:36] SPEAKER_02: But there's also just like a personal choice element.
[01:31:38] SPEAKER_03: Last year we had a like a existential crisis as way too dramatic.
[01:31:44] SPEAKER_03: But I think something that was on our minds was like, are we being wooseys?
[01:31:49] SPEAKER_03: We're not doing Hollywood.
[01:31:51] SPEAKER_03: We're not adding more shows.
[01:31:53] SPEAKER_03: We're not building an enterprise.
[01:31:54] SPEAKER_03: We're triggered this.
[01:31:55] SPEAKER_01: Are we being wooseys?
[01:31:56] We were currently researching Bell Labs.
[01:31:59] And I think I felt like we were chasing this like esotericness.
[01:32:05] So we saw some advice.
[01:32:07] SPEAKER_03: And we went to one of the best investors ever who we've kind of knows, the fans of the
[01:32:12] SPEAKER_03: show.
[01:32:13] SPEAKER_03: And we asked him to dinner and we just sort of like, we've got this, you know, we could
[01:32:18] SPEAKER_03: do all these things.
[01:32:19] SPEAKER_03: We're not like Hollywood, etc.
[01:32:22] And we sort of expected his comment to be like dream bigger, like, you know, go for it.
[01:32:27] SPEAKER_03: Like, you know, you guys are being wooseys.
[01:32:29] SPEAKER_03: And he sort of sat there and he thought a minute and he said, I have seen so many founders
[01:32:36] become trapped in prisons of their own making in their own companies.
[01:32:40] SPEAKER_03: And they're successful prisons.
[01:32:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:43] SPEAKER_03: You guys have avoided that feat.
[01:32:46] SPEAKER_03: Don't go down that road.
[01:32:48] But what is I'm missing actually the connection.
[01:32:51] SPEAKER_02: Why if you were less wooseyish, would you have created higher people take on more of this
[01:32:59] SPEAKER_03: project?
[01:33:00] SPEAKER_03: Oh, I see.
[01:33:01] SPEAKER_03: Oh, I see.
[01:33:02] SPEAKER_03: You've been busy with movies.
[01:33:03] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, business was.
[01:33:04] SPEAKER_02: I thought maybe you were saying you were avoiding like the consequences.
[01:33:06] SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, that's a whole separate wooseys.
[01:33:07] SPEAKER_03: But no, we asked ourselves, are we being business wooseys?
[01:33:10] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:33:11] SPEAKER_03: But they sort of go hand in hand.
[01:33:12] SPEAKER_01: Like, cheap growth is covering the current thing.
[01:33:15] SPEAKER_01: It will, I've been toying with this idea of, yeah, stored potential energy that like
[01:33:20] SPEAKER_01: great businesses have a stored potential energy that you can't see in the current financials.
[01:33:27] SPEAKER_01: And it's great people have that too.
[01:33:30] SPEAKER_02: Great people have that too.
[01:33:31] SPEAKER_02: These reserves that you just, that come out when they need them.
[01:33:35] SPEAKER_01: And they're not like presented in the office.
[01:33:36] SPEAKER_01: They are.
[01:33:37] SPEAKER_01: They aren't sparkling there in front of your eyes.
[01:33:41] And I think we, we're trying to like store up as much potential energy and acquire it
[01:33:45] SPEAKER_01: as we can, rather than any time there's a way to make it show up on the financial statements,
[01:33:53] SPEAKER_01: sort of like letting out the pressure and being like, yep, second show, yep more ads,
[01:33:59] SPEAKER_01: yep, dynamic ads from an ad network.
[01:34:02] SPEAKER_01: Like just, you can say yes to all these things and you can sugar high the current profits.
[01:34:06] SPEAKER_01: Or you can try to like figure out how to store up as much potential energy as you can.
[01:34:11] SPEAKER_01: I think once you kind of hit the point in life where money won't make you any happier,
[01:34:16] SPEAKER_01: then there's actually not a point to letting any of that potential energy out.
[01:34:21] SPEAKER_01: It just creates good will for everyone.
[01:34:24] Most principally, selfishly yourself to keep it bottled.
[01:34:29] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:34:30] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[01:34:31] SPEAKER_02: So how do we get on that?
[01:34:32] We, how do we get on that from the above?
[01:34:34] SPEAKER_02: Founder control.
[01:34:35] SPEAKER_02: That was metadone.
[01:34:36] SPEAKER_02: That was metadone.
[01:34:37] SPEAKER_02: That was metadone.
[01:34:39] SPEAKER_03: Okay, I've got one from the non-obvious one.
[01:34:44] SPEAKER_03: Also, can I just say like, sometimes we do some stuff like this.
[01:34:48] SPEAKER_01: We are not like saints or capitalists.
[01:34:50] SPEAKER_01: Like we're running a capitalist enterprise here.
[01:34:53] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes we have our production crew.
[01:34:54] SPEAKER_03: Sometimes we last year we added a fourth ad slot.
[01:34:58] SPEAKER_01: We always had three.
[01:34:59] SPEAKER_01: Last year we looked at ourselves and we said, there's four hour podcast episodes.
[01:35:03] SPEAKER_01: We're currently at like 2%, 3% ad load.
[01:35:06] SPEAKER_01: Everyone else is at 15%.
[01:35:08] SPEAKER_01: God forbid we go to 4.5% of time.
[01:35:10] SPEAKER_01: So like we indulge occasionally.
[01:35:14] All right, listeners, this is a great time to thank our friends at Century.
[01:35:19] SPEAKER_01: That's S-E-N-T-R-Y, like someone's standing guard.
[01:35:23] SPEAKER_03: Which is exactly what they do for developers.
[01:35:27] SPEAKER_03: Century helps teams debug everything from errors to latency issues and fix them before
[01:35:31] SPEAKER_03: users get mad.
[01:35:32] SPEAKER_03: And since this episode, we are reflecting on 10 years of acquired.
[01:35:35] SPEAKER_01: It's fitting to look at Century's journey, which actually looks a lot like our story.
[01:35:40] SPEAKER_01: They started in 2008 as a tiny open source project, not even a company.
[01:35:44] SPEAKER_01: And the goal was to solve one simple problem.
[01:35:47] SPEAKER_01: Alert me when something is broken.
[01:35:50] SPEAKER_01: It wasn't born out of a big budget or a funding round, no big strategy off site, just a developer
[01:35:55] SPEAKER_01: seeing something broken in the world and fixing it.
[01:35:58] And from there, they just listen to what developers needed.
[01:36:01] More language support, insight into what happened before an error, who was affected,
[01:36:05] SPEAKER_03: which released broke and where the bug lived.
[01:36:08] SPEAKER_03: Century delivered all these and slowly started compounding and making the product better
[01:36:11] SPEAKER_03: every week for 17-ish years.
[01:36:14] SPEAKER_03: And that's why more than 150,000 organizations trust them today.
[01:36:19] SPEAKER_03: And the range of those companies is incredible.
[01:36:22] SPEAKER_01: Disney Plus, Duo Lingo, friends of the show over at Versel and Anthropic, there's Cloudflare,
[01:36:28] SPEAKER_01: GitHub, Atlassian, also a ton of indie developers who are shipping features at 2 in the
[01:36:33] SPEAKER_01: morning.
[01:36:34] SPEAKER_01: Century has just become a key part of how modern software gets built.
[01:36:37] SPEAKER_01: The product has grown the way the best companies do, expanding organically into other tools
[01:36:42] SPEAKER_03: that give developers granular context like tracing, profiling, and session replays.
[01:36:47] SPEAKER_03: And now Century is taking the next step with AI.
[01:36:50] SPEAKER_03: Their agent, Seer, can pinpoint root causes with nearly 95% accuracy by using everything
[01:36:57] SPEAKER_03: that Century already knows, including errors, logs, traces, and code.
[01:37:01] SPEAKER_03: Even suggest fixes.
[01:37:02] SPEAKER_03: And because Seer has that full context, it can review a pull request and spot bugs before
[01:37:07] SPEAKER_03: they ever ship.
[01:37:08] SPEAKER_03: This is not noisy code review.
[01:37:10] SPEAKER_03: This is like real error prediction.
[01:37:12] SPEAKER_03: So as acquired celebrates our own decade of learning and improvement, it is fitting to
[01:37:16] SPEAKER_01: partner with a company that has been on a learning and improvement journey right along
[01:37:20] SPEAKER_01: with the rest of the software industry over that same time.
[01:37:23] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:37:24] SPEAKER_03: So thanks to Century for helping make sure that everyone's favorite apps work the way they
[01:37:27] SPEAKER_03: should.
[01:37:28] SPEAKER_03: Make them out at Century.io slash acquired.
[01:37:31] SPEAKER_03: That's Seen.
[01:37:32] SPEAKER_03: T-R-Y.
[01:37:33] SPEAKER_03: .io slash acquired.
[01:37:34] SPEAKER_03: And just tell them that Ben and David sent you.
[01:37:37] Okay.
[01:37:38] SPEAKER_03: So sometimes we make episodes that either we think are going to be great or we're just
[01:37:43] SPEAKER_03: really interested in them and they like in the numbers wise, they don't perform.
[01:37:48] SPEAKER_03: They don't.
[01:37:49] SPEAKER_03: You know, the great thing about podcasting is like it's always within like a 20-30% range.
[01:37:54] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:37:55] SPEAKER_03: So it's not like it's a total flop.
[01:37:56] SPEAKER_02: Give me an example of the podcast, the extreme version of the one you were most excited
[01:38:01] SPEAKER_02: about that didn't resonate with your audience in the same way.
[01:38:05] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[01:38:06] SPEAKER_03: So the less it is going to be Nintendo.
[01:38:09] SPEAKER_03: We thought Nintendo was going to be a big, such a great, it's an incredible history,
[01:38:15] SPEAKER_03: incredible story, incredible company, and of one company durable over 100 years plus
[01:38:21] SPEAKER_03: has been through so many iterations.
[01:38:23] SPEAKER_03: People love it.
[01:38:25] You know, 20% underperformed our benchmark at the time.
[01:38:29] SPEAKER_03: We're like, oh, man.
[01:38:31] SPEAKER_03: And then we did a part two to really dig ourselves.
[01:38:33] SPEAKER_01: Really like, yeah, just like.
[01:38:34] SPEAKER_01: And you know what people don't love is part two's.
[01:38:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:38:37] It's really don't love part two.
[01:38:38] SPEAKER_01: Let me tell that joke again.
[01:38:39] SPEAKER_01: It's so funny that you like it.
[01:38:40] SPEAKER_01: You better second time.
[01:38:41] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[01:38:42] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[01:38:43] SPEAKER_02: It's like it's a necessary subset.
[01:38:47] SPEAKER_01: You never tune into something called part two without part one.
[01:38:50] SPEAKER_01: And so the dumbest thing you can do if you're focused on growth is have an underperforming
[01:38:55] SPEAKER_01: part one followed by a part two.
[01:38:57] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:38:58] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:38:59] SPEAKER_03: But we did it.
[01:39:01] SPEAKER_03: And you liked it.
[01:39:02] SPEAKER_03: We had a great time.
[01:39:03] SPEAKER_03: Nintendo.
[01:39:04] SPEAKER_03: It's like one of the most interesting companies I mean, it started as a Yakuza company.
[01:39:08] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:39:09] SPEAKER_03: Like it's crazy.
[01:39:10] SPEAKER_03: How did it start?
[01:39:12] It was playing cards.
[01:39:13] SPEAKER_03: Playing cards.
[01:39:14] SPEAKER_03: So for gambling was illegal in Japan after the major restoration.
[01:39:17] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[01:39:18] SPEAKER_03: We made Hana Fuda cards, which are cards in Japan.
[01:39:21] SPEAKER_03: And the Yakuza was the main customer.
[01:39:23] SPEAKER_03: And then they got into toys and then they wail later found their way into these
[01:39:26] SPEAKER_01: movies.
[01:39:27] SPEAKER_01: The Japanese movie was the main course.
[01:39:28] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[01:39:29] SPEAKER_03: That's funny.
[01:39:30] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:39:31] SPEAKER_03: This is an amazing, amazing story.
[01:39:32] SPEAKER_03: And they have this philosophy called lateral thinking with weather technology, which is
[01:39:38] SPEAKER_03: if you look at Nintendo systems, you can go way, way, way back.
[01:39:40] SPEAKER_03: It's not bleeding edge technology.
[01:39:42] SPEAKER_03: It's like, how can we, a couple generations back technology?
[01:39:46] SPEAKER_03: How can we take weather technology?
[01:39:48] SPEAKER_03: Take outside the box with it.
[01:39:49] SPEAKER_03: So like the Wii is the best example of this.
[01:39:51] SPEAKER_03: The Game Boy was the original example of this.
[01:39:52] SPEAKER_03: The Game Boy is basically a calculator.
[01:39:54] SPEAKER_03: But like, you know, it didn't have a color screen.
[01:39:57] SPEAKER_03: It had two buttons like, you know, but it was incredible success.
[01:40:01] SPEAKER_03: You can see the passion.
[01:40:02] SPEAKER_01: I feel like I'm a bestie.
[01:40:03] SPEAKER_01: I'm a bestie.
[01:40:04] SPEAKER_02: Get you into part three.
[01:40:05] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:06] SPEAKER_03: We're going to do part three.
[01:40:07] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[01:40:08] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[01:40:09] SPEAKER_03: But here's the lesson.
[01:40:10] SPEAKER_03: Another episode that was totally like this Indian Premier League cricket.
[01:40:12] SPEAKER_03: Underperformed.
[01:40:13] SPEAKER_03: Love that show.
[01:40:14] SPEAKER_03: Incredible.
[01:40:15] SPEAKER_01: Thanks.
[01:40:16] SPEAKER_01: Incredible story.
[01:40:17] SPEAKER_01: You either really loved it or didn't listen to it.
[01:40:18] SPEAKER_02: You're the only one who can make the most of the lessons.
[01:40:19] SPEAKER_02: It's the first of your shows I listened to.
[01:40:20] SPEAKER_02: You started with, okay.
[01:40:21] You know, why are making the point here?
[01:40:23] SPEAKER_01: This is why we did IPL.
[01:40:24] SPEAKER_01: This is the whole worth it if we just got Michael.
[01:40:27] I'm a partial owner of the Rajasthan Royals.
[01:40:29] SPEAKER_02: You are not.
[01:40:30] SPEAKER_01: I haven't watched Jersey.
[01:40:31] SPEAKER_01: You are a manaj.
[01:40:32] SPEAKER_01: Is the manaj.
[01:40:33] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:40:34] SPEAKER_02: You heard the ball.
[01:40:35] SPEAKER_02: He's a majority owner.
[01:40:36] SPEAKER_02: So it's a very tiny slice.
[01:40:37] SPEAKER_02: But as I haven't been over, I still can't explain the game.
[01:40:41] SPEAKER_02: But the league.
[01:40:42] SPEAKER_02: How did you become a manajan?
[01:40:45] Two friends.
[01:40:46] SPEAKER_02: I don't believe their names out of it.
[01:40:48] SPEAKER_02: But you know who they both were.
[01:40:50] SPEAKER_02: Call and said, there's this guy who's got this cricket team.
[01:40:54] SPEAKER_02: He wants to make it the money ball of.
[01:40:56] SPEAKER_02: Oh, they're the Oakland days of the IPL.
[01:40:59] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I got it.
[01:41:00] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[01:41:01] SPEAKER_02: And he'd be open to having you invest.
[01:41:04] SPEAKER_02: And they were both good filters.
[01:41:06] SPEAKER_02: Like, if they were interested, it was already smart.
[01:41:09] SPEAKER_02: And I also thought it was small enough that if it went wrong,
[01:41:14] it would be an amazing story.
[01:41:16] SPEAKER_02: And even if it goes right, even if it goes right.
[01:41:19] SPEAKER_02: Have you met Lollet?
[01:41:20] SPEAKER_03: Modi?
[01:41:21] SPEAKER_03: No.
[01:41:22] SPEAKER_03: No, no.
[01:41:23] SPEAKER_02: I haven't met anybody but Manoj.
[01:41:24] SPEAKER_02: Oh boy.
[01:41:25] SPEAKER_02: And it's.
[01:41:26] SPEAKER_02: Oh boy.
[01:41:27] SPEAKER_02: No, I know there's a whole.
[01:41:28] SPEAKER_02: We got a subject for you.
[01:41:29] SPEAKER_03: But I don't want to redo your podcast.
[01:41:31] SPEAKER_02: It's just like there may be some way down.
[01:41:33] SPEAKER_02: So that was the other thing I was thinking.
[01:41:35] SPEAKER_02: Like a number of this could work out a number of ways.
[01:41:38] SPEAKER_02: So that was the first way I listened to it.
[01:41:41] That was a, that was an unbelievable story.
[01:41:44] SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:41:45] SPEAKER_02: Everybody in the world should listen to this.
[01:41:47] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:41:48] SPEAKER_02: And it underperformed.
[01:41:49] SPEAKER_03: And yet it underperformed.
[01:41:50] SPEAKER_02: Okay, but here's the lesson.
[01:41:51] SPEAKER_03: It's both Nintendo and IPL.
[01:41:54] SPEAKER_03: We got, they were the first listening experiences
[01:41:57] SPEAKER_03: for some incredibly influential people
[01:42:00] SPEAKER_03: who have changed the literature.
[01:42:02] SPEAKER_03: Actually, here, let's go ahead.
[01:42:03] SPEAKER_03: I think we can share the whole story.
[01:42:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:42:05] SPEAKER_03: Nintendo was specifically listened to by one person
[01:42:06] SPEAKER_03: on the Met executive team who found it.
[01:42:09] SPEAKER_03: I thought it was amazing.
[01:42:10] Senate to the entire Met executive team.
[01:42:12] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:42:13] SPEAKER_03: And then they all listened.
[01:42:14] SPEAKER_03: We built a relationship with them.
[01:42:16] SPEAKER_01: And then when JP Morgan called us and said,
[01:42:19] SPEAKER_01: we've got Chase Center.
[01:42:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:42:22] SPEAKER_01: And they were like, well, what would you do?
[01:42:23] SPEAKER_01: And we asked this person, like, hey,
[01:42:25] SPEAKER_01: do you think Mark would want to do it?
[01:42:26] SPEAKER_01: And.
[01:42:27] SPEAKER_01: And he said, I don't know, but I'm going to ask him right now.
[01:42:29] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:42:30] SPEAKER_03: And so without the Nintendo episode.
[01:42:31] SPEAKER_01: Without the Nintendo episode, Mark Zuckerberg doesn't do it with the chase.
[01:42:34] SPEAKER_03: No, 6000 person.
[01:42:35] SPEAKER_03: And we have some similar stories with IPL.
[01:42:37] SPEAKER_03: The point is that doing episodes that we want or both of us is just like insanely passionate about.
[01:42:47] SPEAKER_03: Where did you learn this from?
[01:42:48] SPEAKER_03: And from doing these episodes and like, on the performing.
[01:42:51] SPEAKER_03: No.
[01:42:52] SPEAKER_03: We learned it from LVMH.
[01:42:53] SPEAKER_01: Oh.
[01:42:54] SPEAKER_01: I pitched that like three times and you were like, okay.
[01:42:56] SPEAKER_01: No, but LVMH was a banger.
[01:42:57] SPEAKER_01: It performed great.
[01:42:58] SPEAKER_01: Which is why we learned the lesson that if one of us feels passionate about something.
[01:43:01] SPEAKER_01: Go for it.
[01:43:02] SPEAKER_01: I make a different point, which is that if one of us feels passionate about something,
[01:43:04] SPEAKER_03: even if the episode is a relative dud,
[01:43:06] SPEAKER_03: it's still worth doing because.
[01:43:09] SPEAKER_03: That passed very well.
[01:43:10] SPEAKER_03: Someone else's share.
[01:43:11] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[01:43:12] SPEAKER_03: This is exactly right.
[01:43:13] SPEAKER_03: And if you don't feel anything, no, it's a chance nobody's going to feel anything.
[01:43:15] SPEAKER_02: But if you feel a lot, someone's going to feel something.
[01:43:17] SPEAKER_02: Someone's going to feel something.
[01:43:18] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:43:19] SPEAKER_02: That's right.
[01:43:20] So go, so cross that feeling.
[01:43:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:43:22] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:43:23] SPEAKER_01: It's about the magnitude of the way a small number of people feel about episodes often more than the.
[01:43:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:43:30] SPEAKER_01: That's spread.
[01:43:31] SPEAKER_01: I think that's right.
[01:43:32] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:43:33] SPEAKER_03: We're passionate about something and it becomes a banger.
[01:43:36] SPEAKER_03: That's the ideal.
[01:43:37] SPEAKER_03: Rentech, Renaissance technologies.
[01:43:39] SPEAKER_03: That was amazing.
[01:43:40] That was incredible.
[01:43:41] SPEAKER_03: That's one of the episodes I've listened to.
[01:43:43] SPEAKER_02: I loved it too.
[01:43:44] SPEAKER_02: So great.
[01:43:45] SPEAKER_02: It's one of the two great mysteries on Wall Street.
[01:43:47] SPEAKER_02: How they do what they do.
[01:43:48] Yeah.
[01:43:49] SPEAKER_02: And who is Satoshi?
[01:43:51] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:43:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, those are the two.
[01:43:53] SPEAKER_02: Those are the two.
[01:43:54] SPEAKER_02: I kind of like the take that they invented machine learning a decade or two before.
[01:44:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:44:01] SPEAKER_01: And they were able to find a secret that resembles LLM's and that they were able to find signal that existed only in really weak ways in a predictable alpha generating.
[01:44:11] SPEAKER_01: But that nobody else found it too.
[01:44:13] SPEAKER_02: So they all went away because they hit it at the same time as they found it.
[01:44:17] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:44:18] SPEAKER_02: That's mind blowing.
[01:44:19] SPEAKER_02: If true, that that could still be going on with.
[01:44:23] SPEAKER_02: I mean, you can see why it worked through the 90s.
[01:44:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:44:28] SPEAKER_02: It's really hard with like Jane Street and Citadel and all these other places looking for every bit of signal in the marketplace.
[01:44:33] SPEAKER_02: It is an amazing story.
[01:44:35] SPEAKER_02: And that is of the books I didn't write that I wished I'd written.
[01:44:38] SPEAKER_02: Did you consider?
[01:44:39] SPEAKER_02: Oh, I so Jim Simon's son had a kid in my oldest child's class in high school.
[01:44:46] SPEAKER_02: And I tried, I said, look, I can't do it unless you want me to do it.
[01:44:51] SPEAKER_02: There's no point.
[01:44:53] SPEAKER_02: And he said like that.
[01:44:54] SPEAKER_02: That's like, no, no.
[01:44:57] This whole business of kind of doing it by radar completely from the outside.
[01:45:01] SPEAKER_02: You know you're going to get so many things wrong.
[01:45:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:45:04] SPEAKER_03: And it's like an embarrass yourself that you need to be so inside so that you don't.
[01:45:08] SPEAKER_02: So that the person you're writing, my doesn't read and say like, that's just completely wrong.
[01:45:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:45:12] SPEAKER_02: And I could have done that book.
[01:45:14] SPEAKER_02: But why?
[01:45:15] SPEAKER_02: You know, that didn't appeal to me.
[01:45:17] SPEAKER_02: What appealed to me was he was at the end of his career.
[01:45:20] SPEAKER_02: I didn't need all the secrets.
[01:45:22] SPEAKER_02: But I needed some of the secrets.
[01:45:25] SPEAKER_02: And I would need him.
[01:45:27] SPEAKER_02: But that's one, that's on my, oh, that's too bad that one got away.
[01:45:33] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for butterfly and flaps, it's wings differently and he collaborated.
[01:45:37] SPEAKER_03: It would have been fabulous.
[01:45:38] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:45:39] SPEAKER_03: It would have been a fabulous book.
[01:45:41] SPEAKER_01: All right, number seven.
[01:45:43] SPEAKER_01: There's a different twist on the NFL.
[01:45:45] SPEAKER_01: But we definitely learned it from the NFL.
[01:45:48] SPEAKER_01: Create spectacle.
[01:45:49] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[01:45:50] A live event strategy.
[01:45:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this twofold.
[01:45:53] SPEAKER_01: One we now have stopped thinking about acquired as a habit for people.
[01:45:57] SPEAKER_01: Most podcasts, your dream is to create a habit.
[01:46:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:46:01] SPEAKER_01: And ours, we've thrown that out the window and said, you don't do enough of it.
[01:46:03] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:46:04] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:46:05] SPEAKER_01: So we need to create events.
[01:46:06] SPEAKER_01: It needs to be the current thing when we release an episode for whatever your group of friends or, you know, acquaintances is like,
[01:46:12] SPEAKER_01: it has to be the water cool conversation.
[01:46:14] SPEAKER_01: It has to be my net football.
[01:46:15] SPEAKER_01: And then once a year, we have to have a Super Bowl.
[01:46:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:46:19] SPEAKER_01: And doing the chase center show and then the radio city show.
[01:46:25] SPEAKER_01: Very small amount of people in the audience.
[01:46:27] SPEAKER_01: I mean, six thousand.
[01:46:28] SPEAKER_01: Six thousand.
[01:46:29] SPEAKER_01: So it's, yeah, great.
[01:46:30] SPEAKER_01: It's the world's largest indoor theater.
[01:46:31] SPEAKER_01: It's 6,000 people in this incredible venue in New York City.
[01:46:34] SPEAKER_01: Relative to the number of people who listen to our episodes.
[01:46:36] SPEAKER_01: Even if it were 50 or half of them, it would still be.
[01:46:37] SPEAKER_01: It's point, uh, point four percent of the audience.
[01:46:41] SPEAKER_01: It's a very small.
[01:46:42] SPEAKER_01: It's a tiny percentage.
[01:46:43] SPEAKER_01: But the amount of heat and light created from the, the idea that you did that.
[01:46:48] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:46:49] SPEAKER_01: Is more impactful to building the franchise of acquired than any given episode.
[01:46:53] SPEAKER_01: Maybe even then a whole season of episodes.
[01:46:55] SPEAKER_01: What's, uh, what's the first spectacle you created?
[01:46:58] SPEAKER_01: Well, the center was the first.
[01:47:00] SPEAKER_02: Spell on the road.
[01:47:01] SPEAKER_02: We had been stepping up.
[01:47:02] That was 18 months.
[01:47:03] SPEAKER_03: So you just start on December 24th.
[01:47:04] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:47:05] SPEAKER_03: This is a, we had been, um, uh, we did a show in climate,
[01:47:09] SPEAKER_03: Pledgerina and Seattle.
[01:47:10] SPEAKER_03: Uh, but it was one section.
[01:47:11] SPEAKER_03: But actually, by being able to say we did an urban show.
[01:47:15] SPEAKER_03: We had credibility.
[01:47:16] SPEAKER_01: We talked about it on air as the acquired arena show.
[01:47:18] SPEAKER_01: And that had some.
[01:47:19] SPEAKER_01: We were able to say that it should be Morgan to chase center to the Warriors.
[01:47:22] SPEAKER_01: Like, we have done this before.
[01:47:24] SPEAKER_01: I'm asked rude couple of rude questions.
[01:47:26] SPEAKER_03: Your, your radio city, uh, musical event was with Jamie Diamond.
[01:47:30] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:47:31] SPEAKER_02: 6,000 people.
[01:47:32] SPEAKER_02: And Meredith Copat-Levian, New York Times CEO and Barry Diller.
[01:47:36] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[01:47:37] SPEAKER_02: So the three, how many people are there for them and how many people are there for you?
[01:47:41] SPEAKER_01: We did not announce the guests.
[01:47:42] SPEAKER_01: Oh.
[01:47:43] SPEAKER_02: So they were, they were there for acquired.
[01:47:44] SPEAKER_02: Oh, they're so, that's because I wanted to give this answer.
[01:47:45] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:47:46] SPEAKER_02: We knew Michael.
[01:47:47] SPEAKER_01: I was gonna ask the question.
[01:47:48] So I, so it's the, it was a, all I knew was it was gonna be acquired with the guest.
[01:47:59] SPEAKER_01: Would it sold out before you announced the guest?
[01:48:02] We didn't have to announce the guest.
[01:48:03] SPEAKER_02: So the guest is surprised.
[01:48:04] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:48:05] SPEAKER_02: Oh.
[01:48:06] SPEAKER_02: It hurt in my soul when we did a show.
[01:48:07] SPEAKER_02: It was a surprise.
[01:48:08] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:48:09] SPEAKER_01: Oh.
[01:48:10] SPEAKER_01: It hurt in my soul when we did Chase Center afterwards reflecting on it.
[01:48:13] SPEAKER_01: There was this little thing of like, did all those people show up because it said Mark Zuckerberg
[01:48:17] SPEAKER_01: on the poster?
[01:48:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:48:19] SPEAKER_02: Well, now you know.
[01:48:20] SPEAKER_02: So now we know.
[01:48:21] SPEAKER_02: So are you doing it?
[01:48:22] SPEAKER_02: So that's, this is your form of spectacle of these big public shows.
[01:48:23] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:48:24] SPEAKER_02: Any other forms of spectacle on the horizon?
[01:48:26] SPEAKER_02: Well, we are doing the actual Super Bowl.
[01:48:28] SPEAKER_03: So this is coming.
[01:48:29] SPEAKER_03: We basically manifested this.
[01:48:30] SPEAKER_03: Is it a half time show?
[01:48:32] SPEAKER_03: I wish.
[01:48:33] SPEAKER_02: I wish.
[01:48:34] SPEAKER_02: Closing with that.
[01:48:35] SPEAKER_02: We're going to be, I would love the reaction of the NFL fan base.
[01:48:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:48:40] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:48:41] SPEAKER_02: It's not going to be music.
[01:48:42] SPEAKER_02: Ben and David are just going to be in a quiet episode.
[01:48:44] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:48:45] Yes.
[01:48:46] SPEAKER_02: With Kate and Eli Man.
[01:48:47] SPEAKER_02: The end up actually.
[01:48:48] SPEAKER_01: That would be so good.
[01:48:49] SPEAKER_01: That would be so good.
[01:48:50] SPEAKER_01: That would be great.
[01:48:51] SPEAKER_01: That would be great.
[01:48:52] SPEAKER_01: It's like, I watch Monday Night Football now.
[01:48:53] SPEAKER_01: Oh.
[01:48:54] SPEAKER_01: We're doing the Innovation Summit.
[01:48:55] SPEAKER_01: So the NFL is launching.
[01:48:56] SPEAKER_01: Launching an innovation summit the Friday before the Super Bowl because the Super Bowl
[01:48:59] SPEAKER_03: is here in, in San Francisco this year.
[01:49:02] SPEAKER_03: We're launching an innovation summit Friday before the Super Bowl with all the big partners
[01:49:07] SPEAKER_03: in the NFL with Roger Cadill.
[01:49:09] SPEAKER_03: It'll be in the city in San Francisco and we're going to MC it.
[01:49:12] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[01:49:13] SPEAKER_02: So do you know who your guests are going to be?
[01:49:15] We do.
[01:49:16] SPEAKER_02: We do.
[01:49:17] SPEAKER_02: It's an outskirts.
[01:49:18] SPEAKER_02: And it'll be, it'll be, you know, one part with, so with our past.
[01:49:20] SPEAKER_02: What are you doing this?
[01:49:21] As a moment.
[01:49:22] SPEAKER_03: As a moment.
[01:49:23] SPEAKER_03: As a moment.
[01:49:24] SPEAKER_03: Oh.
[01:49:25] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:49:26] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[01:49:27] SPEAKER_03: It's not, it's not going to be open to the public.
[01:49:28] SPEAKER_03: It'll be, it'll be streamed.
[01:49:29] SPEAKER_03: Yep.
[01:49:30] SPEAKER_03: It'll be VIPs for the Super Bowl.
[01:49:34] SPEAKER_03: It's for the NFL's partners.
[01:49:35] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:49:36] SPEAKER_03: But, yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be incredible.
[01:49:40] All right.
[01:49:41] Let's go to, I think we're on number nine.
[01:49:43] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[01:49:44] SPEAKER_03: We're at home stage.
[01:49:45] SPEAKER_03: So we made Costco in the back half of 2023.
[01:49:50] SPEAKER_03: But it was one or two episodes after we made Nike.
[01:49:54] SPEAKER_03: Nike I think ended up being a fine episode, but I tried way too hard.
[01:49:59] SPEAKER_03: Like way too much pressure on myself.
[01:50:01] SPEAKER_03: I want to speak for you on the Nike episode.
[01:50:04] SPEAKER_03: And it, it, it came out flat.
[01:50:06] SPEAKER_03: We read nine books between us.
[01:50:08] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:50:09] SPEAKER_01: To prepare.
[01:50:10] SPEAKER_03: I think it was 11.
[01:50:11] SPEAKER_03: It was just too much for all sorts of reasons.
[01:50:12] And so like we were like burnt out.
[01:50:14] SPEAKER_03: We're not happy.
[01:50:15] SPEAKER_03: We decided to do Costco.
[01:50:17] SPEAKER_03: That's it.
[01:50:18] SPEAKER_03: I just got to, I got to take a different approach here.
[01:50:21] SPEAKER_03: I got to play loose on this one.
[01:50:23] SPEAKER_03: Like I can't, you know, play tight to use the sports analogy.
[01:50:26] SPEAKER_03: And is it like, let's, let's find the, the one book.
[01:50:29] SPEAKER_03: The right book.
[01:50:30] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:50:31] SPEAKER_03: Helped it.
[01:50:32] SPEAKER_03: There was only really one book.
[01:50:33] SPEAKER_03: Read that book.
[01:50:34] SPEAKER_03: Salt Price is autobiography.
[01:50:35] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:50:36] SPEAKER_03: Read that.
[01:50:37] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:50:38] SPEAKER_03: Use that as the main source.
[01:50:39] SPEAKER_03: You got maybe one of the best primary source.
[01:50:41] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[01:50:42] SPEAKER_03: It was ever.
[01:50:43] SPEAKER_03: The CFO of Costco gave you a one one presentation.
[01:50:46] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, just come over to the office and I'll sit you down and give you the entire white board
[01:50:50] SPEAKER_01: and PowerPoint on how the Costco business model works.
[01:50:53] SPEAKER_01: Uh-huh.
[01:50:54] SPEAKER_01: And we spent the whole afternoon together.
[01:50:55] SPEAKER_01: And it was.
[01:50:56] SPEAKER_01: And between those two things.
[01:50:57] SPEAKER_03: And that time that you, you spent the whole episode.
[01:50:59] SPEAKER_03: That was the, that was, that was, that was the, and we didn't need to do more than that.
[01:51:02] SPEAKER_03: Were you in into it?
[01:51:03] SPEAKER_03: Did you know anything?
[01:51:04] Yes.
[01:51:05] What, what did you know?
[01:51:06] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:51:07] SPEAKER_03: When we went into starting work on Costco, we, we do nothing.
[01:51:10] SPEAKER_01: Correct.
[01:51:11] SPEAKER_01: But I knew a lot going into the literature meeting.
[01:51:13] SPEAKER_01: Going into that.
[01:51:14] SPEAKER_01: I wanted to be able to hear the things he was saying that were different than common wisdom.
[01:51:19] SPEAKER_01: When you, there's a lot of think pieces out there about Costco.
[01:51:22] SPEAKER_01: The Wall Street Journal loves to write about it.
[01:51:25] SPEAKER_01: Investors love to write about the stock.
[01:51:26] SPEAKER_01: So you can, what's Charlie Munger's favorite company?
[01:51:28] SPEAKER_01: You know, there's lots of stuff up.
[01:51:30] SPEAKER_03: And I, I wanted to hear, this was actually one of the last pieces of research because I
[01:51:34] SPEAKER_01: wanted to be really prepped.
[01:51:37] SPEAKER_02: What did you know you were talking about when you're working on an episode and you're going
[01:51:42] SPEAKER_02: for a run and you, and it, and it, you make some connection or some insight occurs to
[01:51:47] SPEAKER_02: you.
[01:51:48] SPEAKER_02: You stop and you write it down.
[01:51:49] SPEAKER_02: What, give me a few of the ones about Costco.
[01:51:52] SPEAKER_01: Low-squeue count drives everything.
[01:51:53] SPEAKER_01: Oh.
[01:51:54] All right.
[01:51:55] That's the, like, the story of things they have on the, you know, do you want the Charlie
[01:51:59] SPEAKER_03: Munger talk?
[01:52:00] SPEAKER_01: This is the, you know, things they have on the shelf.
[01:52:03] SPEAKER_02: So I want Walmart, there's billions of things.
[01:52:06] SPEAKER_02: Walmart has, has a hundred, two hundred thousand.
[01:52:08] SPEAKER_02: You get what you get.
[01:52:09] SPEAKER_02: You know, pitch fit.
[01:52:10] SPEAKER_02: Whatever's there is there.
[01:52:11] SPEAKER_01: Four thousand things.
[01:52:12] SPEAKER_01: Yep.
[01:52:13] SPEAKER_03: Walmart is a hundred to two hundred thousand.
[01:52:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:52:15] SPEAKER_01: And here's like all the knock on effects of that.
[01:52:17] SPEAKER_01: If you only sell four thousand things, it doesn't take a lot of volume before very quickly.
[01:52:23] SPEAKER_01: You are a meaningful seller to every single one of those products, those vendors.
[01:52:29] SPEAKER_01: Suddenly, you become really important to that vendor.
[01:52:32] SPEAKER_01: Your merchandisers, since you only have four thousand.
[01:52:35] SPEAKER_01: So your incentives start to in line.
[01:52:37] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[01:52:38] SPEAKER_01: The merchandisers have a very small portfolio.
[01:52:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:52:41] SPEAKER_01: You're not dealing with 100 vendors.
[01:52:42] SPEAKER_01: If you're a 100 buyer, you're dealing with hundreds of vendors.
[01:52:44] SPEAKER_03: You're dealing with seven.
[01:52:45] SPEAKER_01: And you would know the absolute crap out of their product line.
[01:52:48] SPEAKER_01: If you sell chocolate, you monitor the price in the cocoa commodities markets.
[01:52:52] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:52:53] SPEAKER_01: And if it takes someone who's managing a very small portfolio to stay that attuned to
[01:52:58] SPEAKER_01: each one of the things, small skew count means that any given thing on the shelf flies
[01:53:04] SPEAKER_01: off the shelf pretty quick.
[01:53:06] So there's not, yeah.
[01:53:07] SPEAKER_02: So the turn of the price is more flow.
[01:53:09] SPEAKER_03: They're getting paid.
[01:53:10] SPEAKER_03: In some cases, they're getting multiple turns of cash flow before they pay the first
[01:53:13] SPEAKER_03: time.
[01:53:14] SPEAKER_03: On average, it takes them 27 days to sell through their entire inventory, which means that's
[01:53:21] SPEAKER_01: on net 30 terms, three days of grace, where the inventory is actually financed by the vendors
[01:53:28] SPEAKER_01: and then some.
[01:53:29] SPEAKER_01: And I think on average, it's 27.
[01:53:31] SPEAKER_03: So some skews are selling in two days that they're turning.
[01:53:35] SPEAKER_03: They're turning at 10 times a month.
[01:53:36] SPEAKER_03: There's no working capital in this business, other than building more cascows.
[01:53:39] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:53:40] Low skew count for cascows is like low, low episode volume for you.
[01:53:45] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:46] SPEAKER_01: 100%.
[01:53:47] SPEAKER_01: We like, yes.
[01:53:48] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:53:49] SPEAKER_02: We have no number of partners so we can put like all of our energy behind the very
[01:53:53] SPEAKER_01: beginning.
[01:53:54] SPEAKER_02: You know, it's not normal.
[01:53:55] SPEAKER_02: It's not really natural for a business to sell less of things, sell fewer things when
[01:53:58] SPEAKER_02: you could sell more things.
[01:53:59] SPEAKER_02: And everything.
[01:54:00] SPEAKER_02: And when you walk into, it is the odd experience when you walk into Costco is the absence
[01:54:04] SPEAKER_02: of choice.
[01:54:05] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:54:06] SPEAKER_02: And in fact, consumers kind of like not having too much choice.
[01:54:10] SPEAKER_02: This is the tradition.
[01:54:11] SPEAKER_02: There's all this research showing that if you sell 30 different kinds of jams in the
[01:54:15] SPEAKER_02: supermarket, you will sell less jam than if you sell three kinds of jam.
[01:54:18] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:54:19] SPEAKER_02: Because the people just be paralyzed by the choice.
[01:54:21] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:54:22] SPEAKER_02: And you smell, you feel like cascows.
[01:54:23] SPEAKER_02: Someone has made all these decisions for me.
[01:54:25] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:54:26] SPEAKER_02: And they're good decisions.
[01:54:27] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[01:54:28] SPEAKER_02: You're curated.
[01:54:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[01:54:30] SPEAKER_01: You can't just run this strategy willy nilly.
[01:54:31] SPEAKER_01: If you're only going to sell very few things, you're only going to make very few episodes,
[01:54:34] SPEAKER_01: it puts a lot of onus on making exceptional choices on the things that you do choose to
[01:54:40] SPEAKER_01: carry.
[01:54:41] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[01:54:42] SPEAKER_01: So it's like a very high leveraged strategy.
[01:54:43] SPEAKER_01: But you didn't know any about, hey, this one used to go into the episode.
[01:54:46] SPEAKER_02: No.
[01:54:48] SPEAKER_03: The only reason we did the episode was it was Charlie Munger's favorite company.
[01:54:51] SPEAKER_03: Give me another lesson.
[01:54:52] SPEAKER_02: Give me another lesson.
[01:54:54] How are we doing?
[01:54:55] SPEAKER_02: Is this the last?
[01:54:56] This is a quiet Michael.
[01:54:57] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[01:54:58] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[01:54:59] I know.
[01:55:00] SPEAKER_03: You said you didn't have any plans tonight.
[01:55:03] We were sitting down with Morris Chang and he was talking about TSMC and he told us that
[01:55:07] SPEAKER_01: one of the ways that they aired was trying to exit the integrated circuit market or
[01:55:13] SPEAKER_01: diversify from that market and go into solar memory.
[01:55:17] SPEAKER_01: It was memories and there was one other thing too.
[01:55:21] And none of those were as good of a business.
[01:55:23] SPEAKER_01: And the key insight was you're already in the best business.
[01:55:28] Integrated circuits are the future and will be for a long time and you're already the
[01:55:31] SPEAKER_01: best at them.
[01:55:32] SPEAKER_01: So stop trying to do other things and just do that really well.
[01:55:38] Probably to a fault and with a bias, we believe that about acquired.
[01:55:42] SPEAKER_01: Every time we look at anything else.
[01:55:43] SPEAKER_01: We're doing the thing we should be doing.
[01:55:45] SPEAKER_02: We're doing this.
[01:55:46] SPEAKER_02: We're doing something that we're less good at.
[01:55:47] SPEAKER_02: It's going to be less fun or right.
[01:55:49] SPEAKER_02: We should always just make another effort.
[01:55:51] SPEAKER_02: You have decided to become venture capitalist again.
[01:55:55] SPEAKER_02: So here's a quick question.
[01:55:56] SPEAKER_02: I'm curious.
[01:55:57] SPEAKER_02: What's the difference between what you do and what a normal Silicon Valley venture capitalist
[01:56:01] SPEAKER_02: does before they put money in a company?
[01:56:03] SPEAKER_02: Do you think you know more?
[01:56:04] SPEAKER_02: I think there's a top level misconception about what the venture capital industry is.
[01:56:11] SPEAKER_03: All right.
[01:56:14] SPEAKER_03: I think a lot of people think it is a analytical industry.
[01:56:18] SPEAKER_03: You're learning all about the company you're doing diligence.
[01:56:19] SPEAKER_03: It's not that you're not.
[01:56:21] You are doing that.
[01:56:23] SPEAKER_03: But that's the commodity.
[01:56:24] SPEAKER_03: It's an access business.
[01:56:26] SPEAKER_03: Especially at the growth stage.
[01:56:27] SPEAKER_03: Early stage, there's more picking involved.
[01:56:30] But that picking is like a super art.
[01:56:34] SPEAKER_03: It's not a early stage picking is not a, you know, understanding a company.
[01:56:39] SPEAKER_03: Early it's a whole different thing.
[01:56:41] SPEAKER_03: But the entire bet that we've made in this chapter of our venture capital careers is
[01:56:47] SPEAKER_01: a bet that getting into the best companies is just an access thing.
[01:56:50] SPEAKER_01: The growth stage, private companies, you can tell what the good ones are.
[01:56:55] SPEAKER_01: Most people can't get in if you can, you should.
[01:56:57] SPEAKER_01: Sorry.
[01:56:58] SPEAKER_01: You know, I mean, with the way we do the work in choosing our sponsors.
[01:57:02] SPEAKER_03: And then we do like, okay, great.
[01:57:03] SPEAKER_03: That box checked, our sponsors are not non-obvious companies that all growth stage investors
[01:57:09] SPEAKER_03: don't want to get into.
[01:57:10] SPEAKER_03: But the kind of work that you do to do a podcast episode about a company, does it bear
[01:57:17] SPEAKER_02: any resemblance to the kind of work of VC does about a company before they invest in it?
[01:57:24] I don't think so.
[01:57:25] SPEAKER_01: I wrote a lot of investment memos in my early stage career.
[01:57:28] SPEAKER_01: They're all about how big could this thing be if it goes right?
[01:57:34] SPEAKER_01: But you're almost always investing, at least I was at the napkin stage.
[01:57:37] SPEAKER_01: And so you're mostly making stuff up.
[01:57:40] You're dreaming what this market could look like when it materializes.
[01:57:44] SPEAKER_01: But you don't know.
[01:57:46] SPEAKER_01: You're really just making a founder bet.
[01:57:47] SPEAKER_01: And then you're trying to support it with all this structural information that is a very
[01:57:54] SPEAKER_01: imprecise.
[01:57:55] SPEAKER_01: You're acting like you know the third or fourth decimal place.
[01:57:57] SPEAKER_01: When in reality, you barely know the first one.
[01:57:59] SPEAKER_01: Answer my question was, are these two things similar and you're saying basically not
[01:58:03] SPEAKER_02: so much?
[01:58:04] SPEAKER_02: That means that being a venture capitalist in no way really prepared you to create these
[01:58:10] SPEAKER_02: podcast episodes because they're very different things.
[01:58:12] SPEAKER_02: Well, I think it prepared us to create the business that we created for sure.
[01:58:16] SPEAKER_03: But what have you learned?
[01:58:18] SPEAKER_02: Put a question in another way.
[01:58:19] SPEAKER_02: What have you learned about telling a story?
[01:58:21] SPEAKER_02: No, I think you didn't know what to do.
[01:58:24] SPEAKER_03: Reading your books and you know being a liberal arts major at Princeton for me.
[01:58:29] SPEAKER_03: Reading the businesses that we studied for acquired helps me make acquired far more than
[01:58:35] SPEAKER_01: any investment memo I ever wrote.
[01:58:37] SPEAKER_01: In fact, I remember in one of my last few years of being a venture capitalist, one of my
[01:58:42] SPEAKER_01: partners asked me how I learned so much so quickly about different industry dynamics.
[01:58:50] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, it's not because I'm talking all these early stage companies, none of which
[01:58:53] SPEAKER_01: know what the future looks like.
[01:58:55] SPEAKER_01: It's studying these mature businesses and understanding what markets can look like at maturity.
[01:58:59] SPEAKER_01: Acquired helped me be an investor much better than the other way around.
[01:59:04] Gotcha.
[01:59:05] SPEAKER_02: What can you do now as storytellers that you couldn't do 10 years ago?
[01:59:09] I think we think about narrative structure and acts and what a story is.
[01:59:16] SPEAKER_03: When we're reading books sometimes, a lot of books, especially corporate history books,
[01:59:20] SPEAKER_03: are this happened and then this happened and then this happened and then this happened.
[01:59:25] That's fine for cataloging history.
[01:59:27] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:59:28] SPEAKER_03: That is not a story.
[01:59:30] SPEAKER_03: And at a certain point we realized like, you can't do and this happened.
[01:59:33] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[01:59:34] SPEAKER_02: It's the why of it.
[01:59:35] SPEAKER_02: It's the story flow.
[01:59:37] SPEAKER_02: The queen died and then the king died is not a story.
[01:59:39] SPEAKER_02: The queen died and the king died of heartbreak is.
[01:59:42] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:59:43] SPEAKER_02: If someone just told you, he told me 10 years ago, the two guys without any previous really
[01:59:50] SPEAKER_02: literary podcasting, any kind of experience, we're going to create this four hour conversation
[01:59:56] SPEAKER_02: about an individual company and people are going to be mesmerized by it.
[02:00:00] SPEAKER_02: People are going to listen to the whole thing and want even more.
[02:00:04] I said that doesn't sound like very promising.
[02:00:06] SPEAKER_02: Like I wouldn't put money into that.
[02:00:07] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:00:08] SPEAKER_03: As you've heard in early stages, it's like why it works is a really good question because
[02:00:12] SPEAKER_02: it's not obvious.
[02:00:13] SPEAKER_02: It's counter to much of what's going on in the culture like tension spans, supposedly
[02:00:17] SPEAKER_02: getting shorter blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:19] SPEAKER_02: But it does work.
[02:00:22] SPEAKER_02: It clearly works.
[02:00:23] SPEAKER_02: Work as a business, but also works as just a creative thing.
[02:00:27] SPEAKER_02: And the why of it is like, I'm, you must think about this all the time.
[02:00:31] The why of it.
[02:00:32] Yeah.
[02:00:33] SPEAKER_01: There's a bunch of different answers to this.
[02:00:34] SPEAKER_01: One giant tailwind for us is a year after we started the podcast, AirPods came out.
[02:00:39] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[02:00:40] SPEAKER_01: And it became slightly acceptable to just listen to stuff while you're moving about the
[02:00:45] SPEAKER_01: world.
[02:00:46] SPEAKER_01: Why are you talking to your mother?
[02:00:47] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[02:00:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[02:00:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[02:00:51] SPEAKER_01: Things all got two input channels, like we used to only focus on one thing at a time.
[02:00:56] SPEAKER_01: Everyone now focuses on two things at a time.
[02:00:59] You can't do the same thing, like you can't read and listen at the same time, but you
[02:01:02] SPEAKER_01: can drive and listen, you can run and listen, you can do the dishes and listen.
[02:01:06] SPEAKER_01: And so we have this massive tailwind of people have like a large number of minutes throughout
[02:01:12] SPEAKER_01: the day where they're doing stuff that they can also listen.
[02:01:15] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:01:16] SPEAKER_01: Which that's true for all podcasts, but like, there are a couple of things that are true
[02:01:19] SPEAKER_03: for all podcasts.
[02:01:20] SPEAKER_03: One is AirPods.
[02:01:21] SPEAKER_03: It's basically all the platform stuff that happened over the last 10 years and we started
[02:01:25] SPEAKER_03: at the right time to advance.
[02:01:27] SPEAKER_03: So AirPods, Spotify, Spotify didn't enter podcasts until 2018 and now is I think over
[02:01:34] SPEAKER_03: half of the market, brought hundreds of millions of people into podcasting.
[02:01:38] SPEAKER_03: Apple Podcasts not becoming YouTube was actually great for us that it's a place to, to, when
[02:01:44] SPEAKER_01: you get a listener, you really get a listener.
[02:01:46] SPEAKER_01: And it's like this durable, incredibly valuable place to accumulate listeners.
[02:01:49] SPEAKER_01: Spotify is too, but YouTube, but it's own way too.
[02:01:53] SPEAKER_01: But there are millions of podcasts and not many are doing what you're doing.
[02:01:56] SPEAKER_02: So, so they all have the, we're not asking the question.
[02:02:00] SPEAKER_01: Corporate America becomes ever more important.
[02:02:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's, that's completely right.
[02:02:04] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:02:05] SPEAKER_02: It's like that what is going on in the economy is mysterious to people.
[02:02:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:02:10] SPEAKER_02: The financial crisis.
[02:02:11] SPEAKER_02: These companies, a lot of your episodes have been about these companies, but Tesla and
[02:02:14] SPEAKER_02: Nvidia and, and, and, and Microsoft and Google and, they, people don't really get them
[02:02:19] SPEAKER_02: explained to them.
[02:02:20] SPEAKER_02: So that's, that's a big part of it.
[02:02:23] SPEAKER_01: If I had pitched you on acquired in 2015, there's no way I would have said acquired helps
[02:02:29] SPEAKER_01: you understand why the world is arranged the way it is.
[02:02:32] SPEAKER_01: But now I think that is absolutely the promise that we come through on.
[02:02:35] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:02:37] I think the biggest reason acquired works is is kind of how you started off the conversation.
[02:02:41] SPEAKER_03: It's just did, it's our partnership.
[02:02:43] SPEAKER_03: Like it's, it's, it's, if just one of us were making acquired, it would be a shadow of
[02:02:48] SPEAKER_03: itself.
[02:02:49] SPEAKER_03: Like the magic exists between us and there's so many, there's, there's a million times
[02:02:53] SPEAKER_03: over the last 10 years where like, if we hadn't just been, you know, so that burn cigarettes
[02:02:59] SPEAKER_03: on our arms aligned that like it wasn't even a conversation.
[02:03:02] SPEAKER_03: But like had our partnership been slightly different, like it would have fractured, that's
[02:03:07] SPEAKER_03: why we're still here.
[02:03:08] SPEAKER_03: So I know, I want to do, I want to conclude this conversation.
[02:03:10] SPEAKER_02: Because we don't want to go three hours.
[02:03:12] SPEAKER_02: But I, but I want to do it by doing the seven powers and apply it.
[02:03:17] SPEAKER_02: I want you to, I want you to, I want you to, I want you to, I want you to, I want you to,
[02:03:19] SPEAKER_02: hold on to our most requested seven powers for acquired.
[02:03:22] SPEAKER_02: Apply it to a quad.
[02:03:23] SPEAKER_02: Great.
[02:03:24] And then I can learn what these seven powers are.
[02:03:26] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[02:03:27] SPEAKER_01: So we are definitely a scale economies business.
[02:03:30] SPEAKER_01: The fact that there's a large number of listeners to amortize all the inputs across makes it
[02:03:37] so that we can do an unreasonable amount of things for each episode.
[02:03:42] SPEAKER_01: I mean, if you were going to try to compete with acquired today, you couldn't do all the
[02:03:47] SPEAKER_01: stuff that we do.
[02:03:48] SPEAKER_01: We don't have a job in the million listeners.
[02:03:49] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:03:50] SPEAKER_03: Or the access or the, and you could do it for one or two or three episodes.
[02:03:52] SPEAKER_01: But if it didn't grow quickly, at some point, you'd be like, it's not even about the
[02:03:56] SPEAKER_01: money.
[02:03:57] SPEAKER_01: It's about like, why am I doing all this work when no one is listening to it?
[02:04:00] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:04:01] SPEAKER_01: And it would feel like that.
[02:04:02] SPEAKER_01: So there was this path dependent thing of, we always had the right product for the
[02:04:07] SPEAKER_01: current amount of value that it created in the world, which you can use at listener base
[02:04:12] SPEAKER_01: as a proxy for.
[02:04:13] SPEAKER_01: And now because the listener base is large, we can afford to do things other people can't
[02:04:18] SPEAKER_01: or just sort of the, definitely scale.
[02:04:20] SPEAKER_01: I think it puts us even much more simply.
[02:04:21] SPEAKER_03: Let's say we, and another podcast, made the exact same episode.
[02:04:26] SPEAKER_03: We've got a million and a half subscribers.
[02:04:28] SPEAKER_03: They have zero.
[02:04:29] SPEAKER_03: Our episode is a lot more valuable.
[02:04:31] SPEAKER_03: Even if we said the exact same words in the exact same way.
[02:04:34] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:04:35] Yeah.
[02:04:36] SPEAKER_03: And we're just, yes.
[02:04:37] SPEAKER_03: Oh.
[02:04:38] SPEAKER_01: Counterpositioning everywhere.
[02:04:39] SPEAKER_01: Counterpositioning everywhere.
[02:04:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[02:04:41] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[02:04:42] SPEAKER_03: Can we do a little meta thing and also explain these patterns?
[02:04:43] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[02:04:44] SPEAKER_03: Explain these patterns.
[02:04:45] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[02:04:46] SPEAKER_03: Counterpositioning is when you do something that your competitors just cannot respond to.
[02:04:52] Give me an example outside of the podcasting.
[02:04:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:04:55] SPEAKER_03: So what's a great example of this?
[02:04:57] Southwest Airlines launches.
[02:04:58] SPEAKER_01: They only use 737s.
[02:05:01] SPEAKER_01: Everyone else who already has fleets of other planes can't do all the streamlined operations
[02:05:05] SPEAKER_01: that Southwest is going to do because they have all these other areas, sunk costs in
[02:05:10] SPEAKER_01: this diversified fleet.
[02:05:11] SPEAKER_01: Yep.
[02:05:12] SPEAKER_03: We're counterpositioning.
[02:05:13] SPEAKER_03: We're not volume drilling.
[02:05:15] SPEAKER_03: Most podcasts sell their ads on a CPM basis and they are incentivized to make as many
[02:05:21] SPEAKER_03: episodes as possible, with as many ads as possible.
[02:05:24] SPEAKER_03: Our business is entirely structurally different.
[02:05:26] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:05:27] SPEAKER_01: We also know your benefit.
[02:05:28] SPEAKER_01: Don't have shareholders.
[02:05:29] SPEAKER_01: So we can do all these like non-economic things because the thing we're solving for the
[02:05:34] SPEAKER_01: quotient is actually like our lives.
[02:05:36] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:05:37] SPEAKER_02: Which is not as opposed to six or eight or one.
[02:05:41] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[02:05:42] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[02:05:43] SPEAKER_02: It's a being just one episode.
[02:05:44] SPEAKER_02: This is David's journey.
[02:05:45] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:05:46] SPEAKER_02: That's my nightmare.
[02:05:47] SPEAKER_03: It's that we actually, we can't end up.
[02:05:50] SPEAKER_03: If we end up at one episode a year, we're one episode a season where it's time to hang
[02:05:54] SPEAKER_03: it up.
[02:05:55] SPEAKER_03: We don't work with agencies.
[02:05:57] SPEAKER_01: If an agency reaches out and says we want to place ads on your podcast, we write them
[02:06:00] SPEAKER_01: a very nice note.
[02:06:01] SPEAKER_01: If we're able to get to the email and say, oh, we don't work with agencies, but thank
[02:06:04] SPEAKER_01: you so much for your interest.
[02:06:05] SPEAKER_01: Can you imagine working at a podcast network where there's a revenue opportunity and you're
[02:06:11] SPEAKER_01: saying, sorry, we just don't, you're a middle of a transaction and so therefore we won't
[02:06:16] SPEAKER_01: take your dollars.
[02:06:17] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:06:18] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:06:19] SPEAKER_02: So you're counting positions and get all of them.
[02:06:20] SPEAKER_02: Count of positions is that in the number of shows you do.
[02:06:23] SPEAKER_02: So the kind of shows you do.
[02:06:24] SPEAKER_02: That's how to express it itself, but the because our business is structurally different
[02:06:28] SPEAKER_03: from others.
[02:06:29] SPEAKER_03: Others can't do what we're doing.
[02:06:31] Network economy is not really, but there's some water cooler effect of people talk about
[02:06:37] SPEAKER_03: acquired episodes, especially within companies.
[02:06:39] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[02:06:40] SPEAKER_03: So we release an episode.
[02:06:42] SPEAKER_03: It becomes a topic of discussion.
[02:06:44] SPEAKER_03: This is really a weak power, but it exists to a small extent.
[02:06:48] SPEAKER_01: If you like acquired, more people liking acquired is valuable because you get to talk about
[02:06:51] SPEAKER_01: it with more people.
[02:06:52] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:06:53] SPEAKER_03: No switching costs.
[02:06:54] SPEAKER_03: So switching costs is a power of the super easy to explain switching costs.
[02:06:58] SPEAKER_03: Sales force.
[02:06:59] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[02:07:00] SPEAKER_01: You get to see our Amazon sales force.
[02:07:02] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[02:07:03] SPEAKER_03: And to switch to another CRM is just a huge amount of cost associated with that.
[02:07:09] Even though, you know, let's say on a day-to-day basis, it's the same price, we're cheaper.
[02:07:15] SPEAKER_01: It's just such a pain and an economic tax to do a new implementation of something.
[02:07:20] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:07:21] Yep.
[02:07:22] SPEAKER_01: We don't have that.
[02:07:23] SPEAKER_01: No.
[02:07:24] SPEAKER_01: People can, that's an answer to switch.
[02:07:25] SPEAKER_01: An answer to switch.
[02:07:26] SPEAKER_02: An answer to switch.
[02:07:27] SPEAKER_02: How to acquire it into whatever might come along with no cost.
[02:07:30] SPEAKER_02: What's your replace acquired?
[02:07:32] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[02:07:33] SPEAKER_01: Don't have that.
[02:07:34] SPEAKER_01: Can I just also say this is so weird and uncomfortable for me?
[02:07:38] Because while I think we've created this beautiful gem and I love thinking about it and talking
[02:07:43] SPEAKER_01: about it with you, it is terrifying to talk about it with everyone and also feel so self-aggrandizing
[02:07:52] SPEAKER_01: to talk about what a great painting I've made.
[02:07:55] SPEAKER_01: No, no, no.
[02:07:56] SPEAKER_02: But it's very useful to think about this in this way.
[02:07:58] SPEAKER_02: You've got a framework, let's think about your framework.
[02:08:01] SPEAKER_02: What's the next power?
[02:08:03] SPEAKER_03: Branding.
[02:08:04] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[02:08:05] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[02:08:06] SPEAKER_03: Again, thought exercise, same product released by a different podcast and I called acquired,
[02:08:09] SPEAKER_03: people just acquired.
[02:08:10] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[02:08:11] Yep.
[02:08:12] SPEAKER_03: And that's just growing.
[02:08:14] Yeah.
[02:08:15] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:08:16] SPEAKER_03: Cornered resource.
[02:08:17] SPEAKER_02: The business owns us.
[02:08:19] SPEAKER_02: Explain cornered resource.
[02:08:21] SPEAKER_01: Give me an example.
[02:08:22] SPEAKER_03: Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal.
[02:08:23] SPEAKER_03: Intellectual property.
[02:08:24] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[02:08:25] SPEAKER_01: And the patent.
[02:08:26] SPEAKER_01: Disney owns the likeness of Mickey Mouse.
[02:08:28] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[02:08:29] SPEAKER_01: You don't get to build a business that benefits from the economic value driven by Mickey Mouse.
[02:08:34] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:08:35] Now we're assuming that you're a cornered resource.
[02:08:39] SPEAKER_02: That the reason that people are tuning in is that you're lovely voices and the way you
[02:08:43] SPEAKER_02: enthuse over this stuff.
[02:08:45] SPEAKER_02: It could be that you've just actually found a thing that everybody wants and that if
[02:08:51] SPEAKER_02: two other people came in, they do it even better.
[02:08:53] SPEAKER_02: And there are people who create, it's early, they're small, but things that resemble acquired
[02:08:58] SPEAKER_01: a lot, the step change podcast by our friend Ben Eidelsen is one of them where like it's
[02:09:02] SPEAKER_01: doing really well for a podcast.
[02:09:04] SPEAKER_01: It has three episodes because there's magic in the format.
[02:09:07] SPEAKER_01: Even if it's not us.
[02:09:08] SPEAKER_01: Yep.
[02:09:09] SPEAKER_02: That is if there is a cornered resource that you or your editor or yeah, or your name
[02:09:13] SPEAKER_02: you won't be able to suggest the process.
[02:09:16] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:09:17] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:09:18] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[02:09:19] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[02:09:20] SPEAKER_03: And then the last one is process power.
[02:09:22] SPEAKER_03: Which almost always businesses don't have.
[02:09:25] SPEAKER_03: We have in space.
[02:09:26] SPEAKER_03: It's the same thing you have.
[02:09:28] SPEAKER_01: Because we kind of fail to articulate how an episode comes together.
[02:09:31] SPEAKER_01: We tried on this conversation three times.
[02:09:34] SPEAKER_01: And we didn't really explain to you exactly mechanically how an episode comes together.
[02:09:39] SPEAKER_01: Except I can understand the iterations, but you vomit out eight hours.
[02:09:44] SPEAKER_02: Your editor decides which the best five that comes back to you and you cut and cut.
[02:09:49] SPEAKER_02: But what you could do I show up with on recording day.
[02:09:52] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I see.
[02:09:53] SPEAKER_02: So we should maybe do this a little bit here process.
[02:09:56] SPEAKER_02: Can I guess?
[02:09:57] SPEAKER_02: Sure.
[02:09:58] SPEAKER_02: Because I actually don't know what you show up with the recording.
[02:09:59] SPEAKER_02: You both, I assume you each take a kind of part of the story like either the history or
[02:10:07] SPEAKER_02: current analysis of the business and you're responsible for that and you go learn about
[02:10:11] SPEAKER_02: it.
[02:10:12] SPEAKER_02: And but there's got to be some improvisation here so that you don't tell each other
[02:10:16] SPEAKER_02: exactly what you've learned.
[02:10:18] SPEAKER_02: More or less, I'm responsible for the story with we carve out a one or multiple chunks
[02:10:23] SPEAKER_03: that Ben'll take and then Ben is responsible for the analysis.
[02:10:26] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[02:10:27] SPEAKER_02: And then you probably have some blinds you want to say that you know you want to say,
[02:10:33] SPEAKER_02: but you want to say them naturally.
[02:10:35] SPEAKER_02: So you kind of have them stored in the back of your head and you wait for the moment where
[02:10:37] SPEAKER_02: you can drop it where it sounds casual.
[02:10:39] SPEAKER_02: Like, but if you don't, if that doesn't happen, you set it up.
[02:10:42] SPEAKER_02: Like Ben's point like skew is everything in Costco.
[02:10:47] SPEAKER_02: That kind of insight, you can reduce it to something you want to get across in a line
[02:10:53] SPEAKER_02: or two.
[02:10:54] What's hard about improv is disposing of all the things you imagined that were going to
[02:11:00] SPEAKER_02: happen in a conversation before they happen and nobody does it perfectly.
[02:11:04] SPEAKER_02: And so there's this tension between the script and what's happening organically between
[02:11:09] SPEAKER_02: the two of you.
[02:11:10] SPEAKER_02: The truth is it's both.
[02:11:12] SPEAKER_03: It's both.
[02:11:13] SPEAKER_03: So I write a script.
[02:11:14] SPEAKER_03: I write 10 to 20,000 words.
[02:11:16] SPEAKER_03: You do.
[02:11:17] SPEAKER_03: Incentens form.
[02:11:18] SPEAKER_03: Do you read it?
[02:11:19] No.
[02:11:20] SPEAKER_03: Well, well, I mean, I read it.
[02:11:21] SPEAKER_03: It doesn't come out of my mouth.
[02:11:23] SPEAKER_03: It comes out as a natural conversation.
[02:11:25] SPEAKER_03: So you write it, but then you put it to one side.
[02:11:26] SPEAKER_03: You have three screens in front of it.
[02:11:28] SPEAKER_03: You're kind of reading it.
[02:11:29] SPEAKER_03: I'm kind of reading it.
[02:11:30] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:31] SPEAKER_03: But Ben and your Jackson, it doesn't come out exactly as I wrote it.
[02:11:34] SPEAKER_03: It doesn't sound like a script.
[02:11:35] SPEAKER_03: That's good.
[02:11:36] SPEAKER_03: But part of my process is I need to write a script to know what you think.
[02:11:40] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:11:41] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it makes complete sense.
[02:11:43] SPEAKER_03: It's also to have it as a crutch there when we're performing.
[02:11:46] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[02:11:47] SPEAKER_03: We can't keep all this in our heads.
[02:11:48] SPEAKER_03: But the real crutch you have is you can do it for nine hours and it's only going to
[02:11:51] SPEAKER_02: be four.
[02:11:52] SPEAKER_02: So you can make any, you know, you don't have to be perfect.
[02:11:55] SPEAKER_02: You can screw it up every which way.
[02:11:57] SPEAKER_02: And you have a real time feedback agent.
[02:11:59] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, where are you?
[02:12:00] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, this is dragging.
[02:12:01] SPEAKER_01: I don't care about any of this.
[02:12:02] SPEAKER_01: Shut up.
[02:12:03] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, this is dragging.
[02:12:04] SPEAKER_02: I don't care about any of this.
[02:12:05] SPEAKER_02: Shut up.
[02:12:06] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, shut up.
[02:12:07] SPEAKER_02: Cut, cut, cut.
[02:12:08] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:12:09] SPEAKER_02: And then yet, all we hear, the audience hears is, that's amazing.
[02:12:11] SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's so interesting.
[02:12:12] It's incredible.
[02:12:13] SPEAKER_02: I never thought of it that way.
[02:12:15] SPEAKER_02: You're the best.
[02:12:16] SPEAKER_02: I love you.
[02:12:17] SPEAKER_02: So we don't see any of the other stuff.
[02:12:20] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no.
[02:12:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's in there.
[02:12:22] SPEAKER_02: It's in there somewhere.
[02:12:23] SPEAKER_02: OK.
[02:12:24] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[02:12:25] SPEAKER_02: So take me further into the process.
[02:12:27] SPEAKER_02: So you have, you have a script and you don't, Ben, you don't have a script.
[02:12:30] I have a giant text edit document with like just a whole bunch of mechanical points I
[02:12:37] SPEAKER_01: want to get across.
[02:12:39] SPEAKER_01: I have some story points in there that I know I want to interject in David's story, but
[02:12:46] SPEAKER_01: I know the things that I'm going to bring to the episode that I really care deeply about
[02:12:49] SPEAKER_01: or explaining how something works.
[02:12:51] SPEAKER_01: So I have like written out bullet point by bullet point by bullet point.
[02:12:54] SPEAKER_01: And then we usually have to have weird.
[02:12:56] SPEAKER_01: That's going to enter in.
[02:12:58] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[02:12:59] Yeah.
[02:13:00] SPEAKER_02: But all of this thing works because it doesn't sound like you're reading anything.
[02:13:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:13:04] SPEAKER_02: It sounds like it really is.
[02:13:05] SPEAKER_03: It's hybrid.
[02:13:06] SPEAKER_02: OK.
[02:13:07] SPEAKER_02: Reality is hybrid.
[02:13:08] There's all sorts of stuff in there that like we are sort of looking at about six hours
[02:13:12] SPEAKER_01: into recording.
[02:13:13] SPEAKER_01: We're like, that's not going to make it in.
[02:13:15] SPEAKER_01: And that's OK.
[02:13:16] SPEAKER_01: That turned out it was not a salient point.
[02:13:18] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:13:19] SPEAKER_03: But the point of process power, there's like, we can describe all this.
[02:13:22] SPEAKER_03: You could probably, I'm sure you have described in painstaking detail.
[02:13:26] SPEAKER_03: How I do it.
[02:13:27] SPEAKER_03: How you do it.
[02:13:28] SPEAKER_03: But that doesn't mean anybody else can write a Michael Lewis book.
[02:13:30] The process, but your point is you have the process power.
[02:13:33] SPEAKER_02: But the point of process power is you could tell them.
[02:13:36] SPEAKER_02: It's obvious.
[02:13:37] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:13:38] SPEAKER_02: I see.
[02:13:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:13:40] SPEAKER_02: That's interesting.
[02:13:41] SPEAKER_02: And you have a process that can't be replicated even if you explain it.
[02:13:42] SPEAKER_02: Even if we're explaining, excruciating detail, exactly what it is.
[02:13:45] What pops to my mind is that the magic, the pixie dusk in a process is trust.
[02:13:52] SPEAKER_02: And it's like something that you get when you trust a process.
[02:13:58] Here, trust the process.
[02:14:00] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:14:01] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:14:02] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:14:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:14:04] SPEAKER_02: The first thing I think about the philosophy of the 76 is they didn't trust the process.
[02:14:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:14:07] SPEAKER_02: They wanted the process.
[02:14:08] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:14:09] SPEAKER_02: They wanted to replicate what they had been doing in Houston, but they didn't trust it.
[02:14:13] SPEAKER_02: We'll just trust show up for years.
[02:14:15] SPEAKER_02: For your ears.
[02:14:16] SPEAKER_02: It's about to say that I think I trust my process.
[02:14:19] SPEAKER_02: And it's self trust, but that's a form of trust.
[02:14:22] SPEAKER_02: And I know if I just told it to someone and they went and tried to do it, they'd be thinking
[02:14:27] SPEAKER_02: they'd make them, they'd wig out.
[02:14:29] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:14:30] SPEAKER_02: I got to record the things.
[02:14:31] SPEAKER_02: I got to do this.
[02:14:32] SPEAKER_02: And in fact, doing it my way would be a kind of weird handicap for them.
[02:14:36] SPEAKER_02: That's the process, Fred.
[02:14:37] SPEAKER_03: Like if you were to copy paste the process, it wouldn't have the same results and it might
[02:14:43] SPEAKER_03: in fact be a handicap.
[02:14:44] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[02:14:45] SPEAKER_02: But there's something emotional going on there.
[02:14:47] SPEAKER_02: The difficulty in replicating it.
[02:14:49] SPEAKER_02: I also think it's because when you describe your process, it is lossy compression.
[02:14:58] The way compression works in computing is you're taking a large amount of data and you're
[02:15:02] SPEAKER_01: compressing it down into a smaller amount of data, a different file format.
[02:15:07] SPEAKER_01: And if it's lossy, it means that you can never fully recreate the original work.
[02:15:10] SPEAKER_01: This is a MP3 codec.
[02:15:12] SPEAKER_03: OK.
[02:15:13] SPEAKER_03: Learn a JPEG.
[02:15:14] SPEAKER_01: A JPEG doesn't actually contain all the RGB values from the original photo, but like a
[02:15:19] SPEAKER_01: human can't tell most of the time.
[02:15:21] SPEAKER_01: And so it's fine.
[02:15:23] Right.
[02:15:24] SPEAKER_01: Explaining a process is a lossy compression of the actual process.
[02:15:27] SPEAKER_01: That's true.
[02:15:28] SPEAKER_02: You're actually not giving in everything.
[02:15:30] SPEAKER_02: And you're not doing it intentionally.
[02:15:31] SPEAKER_01: No, it's just a lossy compression.
[02:15:32] SPEAKER_01: Languages a lossy compression of thought.
[02:15:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:15:35] True.
[02:15:36] SPEAKER_02: That's an interesting observation.
[02:15:37] SPEAKER_02: Languages enough, a lossy compression of thought.
[02:15:39] SPEAKER_02: Try to think if the reverse is also true for some people.
[02:15:41] SPEAKER_02: Well, in uncompressing information, it's so funny when you and I are communicating, I
[02:15:45] SPEAKER_01: had a thought.
[02:15:46] SPEAKER_01: I compressed it into a very narrow bandwidth thing of speech.
[02:15:49] SPEAKER_01: I told it to you, you uncompressed it into your brain.
[02:15:52] SPEAKER_01: It might actually mean a pretty different thing to you than it means to me.
[02:15:55] SPEAKER_02: That insight is at the bottom of my creative process.
[02:15:58] SPEAKER_02: I assume when I write a book that what goes into people is something different than came
[02:16:04] SPEAKER_02: out of me, that they are going to take it and reassemble it in a different way.
[02:16:08] SPEAKER_02: And so I have to construct it in a way that there's a hole for the reader to go in and just
[02:16:14] SPEAKER_02: do what they need to do with it.
[02:16:15] SPEAKER_02: That the more I just let the story tell itself, the less I tried to like influence what
[02:16:22] he thought about the story, the more the story landed.
[02:16:26] SPEAKER_02: And then of course, when you do that, you're giving people lots of options in how they
[02:16:31] SPEAKER_02: see the story, how they understand the story.
[02:16:34] SPEAKER_02: It's the risk you take.
[02:16:37] But it's what makes it live.
[02:16:40] SPEAKER_02: And it's why you get this huge range of response to a given story.
[02:16:45] SPEAKER_02: But you got to actually just accept that when you're saying something, the other person
[02:16:50] SPEAKER_02: gets to understand it however they want to understand it.
[02:16:53] SPEAKER_02: And if you don't do that, what you get is something that's dead the next day.
[02:16:57] SPEAKER_02: It's like, yeah, yeah, you made your point, but I didn't hear it.
[02:17:01] SPEAKER_02: I don't want it.
[02:17:02] SPEAKER_03: So fun.
[02:17:03] SPEAKER_03: This is always one of our key goals with every episode.
[02:17:05] SPEAKER_03: It's like no matter what you think about the company.
[02:17:08] SPEAKER_03: Right.
[02:17:09] You're going to enjoy this episode and you're going to learn something from it.
[02:17:12] SPEAKER_03: And then you may come away thinking like, it's about understanding.
[02:17:16] SPEAKER_01: This company is terrible.
[02:17:18] SPEAKER_03: You may come away thinking this company is righteous.
[02:17:20] SPEAKER_03: But like, sometimes we don't nail it.
[02:17:22] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes we don't always nail it.
[02:17:24] SPEAKER_03: But that's the goal.
[02:17:25] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's the creatively fun goal.
[02:17:29] SPEAKER_02: Because that's the challenge rather than just imposing your editorial view on the world.
[02:17:35] SPEAKER_02: Present it in as elegant way as possible and let the reader make with a make of it.
[02:17:39] SPEAKER_02: Once you realize that's the thing to do, it's so much more fun than trying to muscle people
[02:17:44] SPEAKER_02: around.
[02:17:45] SPEAKER_02: It's all of a sudden you're dancing with a reader instead of hurling them all over the dance
[02:17:49] SPEAKER_02: floor.
[02:17:50] SPEAKER_02: It also requires you to learn something new while you're making the creative work.
[02:17:55] SPEAKER_01: If you come in with a point of view and you come in, let's say we tried it, I was so
[02:18:00] SPEAKER_01: afraid we were making Trader Joe's that we were going to remake the Costco episode.
[02:18:03] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, this episode is going to suck because we're not going to have the original
[02:18:07] SPEAKER_01: enthusiasm that we had.
[02:18:08] SPEAKER_01: It's just like Costco, but not as good.
[02:18:10] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:11] SPEAKER_01: Or it's Costco, but it's for furniture.
[02:18:12] SPEAKER_01: We get a guy like, oh, this is totally different.
[02:18:14] SPEAKER_01: You have to have new insights that delight you as you're researching it so that you can
[02:18:19] SPEAKER_01: make something great.
[02:18:20] SPEAKER_01: And I think the reasons acquired will eventually fail.
[02:18:24] I don't think come from like platform disruption.
[02:18:28] SPEAKER_01: Like, oh, tech talks going to make it so people want short form instead of acquired.
[02:18:32] SPEAKER_01: Maybe, but the more likely reason that we eventually fail is we stop being delighted by new things
[02:18:39] SPEAKER_01: we discover.
[02:18:40] SPEAKER_01: So we have nothing new to deliver to listeners.
[02:18:42] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:18:43] SPEAKER_01: I agree with that.
[02:18:44] If you were to ask me how you were going to fail, that's exactly the kind of thing I
[02:18:47] SPEAKER_02: was saying.
[02:18:48] SPEAKER_02: And run out of gas or run out of material that the major socks go up and down.
[02:18:54] Okay, listeners.
[02:18:55] SPEAKER_01: Now is a great time to thank one of our very favorite partners, Shopify.
[02:19:00] And David, we recorded this episode with Michael the week after Thanksgiving.
[02:19:05] SPEAKER_01: And while you and I were nice and festive and coming off of some relaxing time with family,
[02:19:10] SPEAKER_01: the Shopify team had been cranking because Black Friday and Cyber Monday is of course
[02:19:14] SPEAKER_01: the biggest sales weekend of the year for merchants around the world.
[02:19:18] SPEAKER_03: At the very same time as we were recording, Toby was sharing the final stats.
[02:19:22] SPEAKER_03: So Shopify merchants did $14.6 billion in sales over the weekend, which was up 27% from last
[02:19:33] SPEAKER_03: year.
[02:19:34] SPEAKER_03: Over 15,000 entrepreneurs made their first sales and 81 million unique shoppers bought
[02:19:40] SPEAKER_03: from Shopify merchants.
[02:19:42] SPEAKER_03: That is absolutely nuts.
[02:19:44] SPEAKER_01: That four day sales volume number, that's almost twice as much as Shopify's entire annual
[02:19:50] SPEAKER_01: volume when they went public in 2015.
[02:19:53] SPEAKER_01: Of course, as we chronicled on our acquired episode on Shopify back a few years ago, just
[02:19:57] SPEAKER_01: wild.
[02:19:59] SPEAKER_03: And part of that growth was that for the first time this year, a few merchants were able
[02:20:03] SPEAKER_03: to sell on Black Friday directly inside chat GPT, thanks to Shopify's partnership with
[02:20:08] SPEAKER_03: OpenAI.
[02:20:09] SPEAKER_03: Like the links or redirects consumers could ask chat GPT about Black Friday deals for
[02:20:14] SPEAKER_03: products they're interested in.
[02:20:16] SPEAKER_03: And Shopify loaded actual checkout flows directly within their chat GPT conversations.
[02:20:22] SPEAKER_01: This is super cool.
[02:20:23] Glossier, away, Nike strength, majority, spanks and skims were all live on chat GPT on
[02:20:30] SPEAKER_01: Black Friday with Shopify.
[02:20:33] SPEAKER_03: This is just one example of why Shopify is so awesome and one of our very favorite companies
[02:20:37] SPEAKER_03: in the acquired universe.
[02:20:39] SPEAKER_03: Shopify lets anyone sell in seconds online, in store, on mobile, on social, on marketplaces,
[02:20:45] SPEAKER_03: and now with AI agents.
[02:20:46] SPEAKER_03: And it's not just startups, it's general motors, it's esth a lauder, it's Mattel and on
[02:20:51] SPEAKER_01: and on and on.
[02:20:52] SPEAKER_01: So whether you are just starting out or you're operating at global scale, Shopify helps you
[02:20:56] SPEAKER_01: sell anywhere your customers are.
[02:20:58] SPEAKER_01: So get started at Shopify.com slash acquired and just tell them that Ben and David sent you.
[02:21:03] All right, where are we going to?
[02:21:04] SPEAKER_01: This is your show.
[02:21:05] SPEAKER_01: Carvots?
[02:21:06] SPEAKER_03: Carvots.
[02:21:07] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we got to do it.
[02:21:08] SPEAKER_03: I think Carvots.
[02:21:09] SPEAKER_03: What does it seem to me?
[02:21:12] SPEAKER_03: Okay, so you'll appreciate this.
[02:21:14] SPEAKER_03: It was my wife's idea right back towards the beginning of the show.
[02:21:18] SPEAKER_03: She used to listen to Slates, I think it was a culture gap fest.
[02:21:23] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[02:21:24] SPEAKER_03: And they do cocktail chatter at the end of episodes.
[02:21:27] SPEAKER_03: It was just like, hey, something unrelated.
[02:21:30] SPEAKER_03: And she was like, you can't do that.
[02:21:33] SPEAKER_03: That's fun.
[02:21:34] SPEAKER_03: Well, I understand the idea of it.
[02:21:35] SPEAKER_03: Why is it called a carvot?
[02:21:36] SPEAKER_03: Okay, so then we were like, this was in a phase of acquired where we wanted to brand
[02:21:39] SPEAKER_03: everything around.
[02:21:40] SPEAKER_03: Okay, there we go.
[02:21:41] SPEAKER_03: And so we thought, okay, what can we call this?
[02:21:43] SPEAKER_03: We're not going to call it cocktail chatter.
[02:21:46] SPEAKER_03: We came up with the idea of a carvot, like an M&A transaction.
[02:21:49] SPEAKER_03: A carvot is like this piece of the purchase price goes to like this set of shareholders
[02:21:54] SPEAKER_03: for special reason, their employees or whatever.
[02:21:57] SPEAKER_03: So these are the things we're carving out as things that delight us that have nothing
[02:22:00] SPEAKER_01: to do with the rest of the episodes.
[02:22:02] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[02:22:03] SPEAKER_02: And the name is just residual.
[02:22:05] SPEAKER_02: It's just a residue of your former incarnation.
[02:22:07] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we used to brand.
[02:22:08] SPEAKER_02: You wouldn't use that.
[02:22:09] SPEAKER_02: We used to have a thing called the LP show because we had all these little branding cars.
[02:22:13] SPEAKER_03: Playbook is sort of a remnant of a older version.
[02:22:15] SPEAKER_01: So what are we going to do?
[02:22:16] SPEAKER_01: What are carve out?
[02:22:17] SPEAKER_02: What are those specific things?
[02:22:18] SPEAKER_02: We have some categories that we're going to throw out and then you got to tell us and
[02:22:21] SPEAKER_01: we'll tell you things this year that we loved in this category, typically pieces of media
[02:22:26] SPEAKER_01: or products or something like that.
[02:22:27] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[02:22:28] SPEAKER_03: We usually start with books.
[02:22:29] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[02:22:30] That's kind of funny.
[02:22:32] SPEAKER_01: I've been doing it here.
[02:22:33] I mean, so many of your books have been on carve out over the years.
[02:22:36] SPEAKER_01: Really?
[02:22:37] SPEAKER_02: Absolutely.
[02:22:38] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:22:39] SPEAKER_02: So it's books that I've read though in the last year or so.
[02:22:42] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, books this year that, yeah.
[02:22:43] SPEAKER_03: So I got to confess I've had a very weak reading year because I've been really deep in
[02:22:48] SPEAKER_02: two projects where I've been working and when I'm working, I'm often all I'm reading
[02:22:52] SPEAKER_02: is for work.
[02:22:54] SPEAKER_02: But I can think of a couple, one at the beginning of the year and one of the, one I just put
[02:22:58] SPEAKER_02: down.
[02:22:59] SPEAKER_02: The first one I read because my son was in high school at the time, had read it and he
[02:23:03] SPEAKER_02: was enthusing about this 800 page novel.
[02:23:07] SPEAKER_02: And I thought that just didn't happen very often.
[02:23:09] SPEAKER_02: And it's been out a long time.
[02:23:11] SPEAKER_02: It's called the name of the win by Patrick Roffus and it's a fantasy trilogy.
[02:23:17] He never got to the third book.
[02:23:18] SPEAKER_02: I don't know what's happened to him.
[02:23:19] SPEAKER_02: He's like blocked.
[02:23:20] SPEAKER_02: But I'm not fan.
[02:23:21] SPEAKER_02: It's like I'm hoping he's an acquired listener.
[02:23:25] SPEAKER_02: And I would tell him I can come help get you unblocked.
[02:23:28] SPEAKER_02: I know how good lock writers.
[02:23:30] SPEAKER_02: I have a secret power here.
[02:23:32] SPEAKER_02: And so do you have a secret life as a fiction ghost writer?
[02:23:34] SPEAKER_02: I know do not.
[02:23:35] SPEAKER_02: That would be it.
[02:23:36] SPEAKER_02: But I do have a secret life as a coach to writers and other writers.
[02:23:42] SPEAKER_02: And it's, this thing was, it was so compelling.
[02:23:45] SPEAKER_02: I couldn't believe how good it was.
[02:23:47] SPEAKER_02: And I couldn't believe how good it was that he hasn't, he's, he has gotten stalled.
[02:23:50] SPEAKER_02: But the name of the win, Patrick Roffus, right at the beginning of the year, very beginning
[02:23:53] SPEAKER_02: of the year.
[02:23:54] SPEAKER_02: And the end of the thing I just finished, it's not like it's a great book, but I think
[02:23:57] SPEAKER_02: it's like, it's so short.
[02:23:59] SPEAKER_02: And it's of, it's something that is speaking to our moment in our, especially how I govern
[02:24:04] SPEAKER_02: ourselves.
[02:24:05] SPEAKER_02: It's, I always mispronounce his name.
[02:24:07] SPEAKER_02: It's that of our Bush.
[02:24:09] SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:24:10] SPEAKER_03: Who essentially created the American science project.
[02:24:14] And it's a little, it's a, basically I think he started as a memo to FDR and then FDR
[02:24:18] SPEAKER_02: died and then ended up being a memo to Terry Truman about what America could do if the
[02:24:22] SPEAKER_02: government in the right way got behind science.
[02:24:26] SPEAKER_02: He was saying, like, what we did with Manhattan Project, we can do with biology, we can do,
[02:24:30] SPEAKER_02: we can do with the other hard sciences.
[02:24:32] SPEAKER_02: He was describing not a top down approach, not like the government is going to just decide.
[02:24:37] SPEAKER_02: We're going to, we're going to fund it and let the scientists figure out what they need
[02:24:40] SPEAKER_02: to work on.
[02:24:41] SPEAKER_02: And was that was the, that was the big insight.
[02:24:43] SPEAKER_02: So those are two books.
[02:24:44] SPEAKER_02: How about you?
[02:24:46] SPEAKER_02: What books do you, um, similar to you, we've been, it's been a research heavier.
[02:24:51] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we have young kids.
[02:24:52] SPEAKER_03: So fun books are, right.
[02:24:55] SPEAKER_01: And great book I read for research was last man standing to prep for the Jamie Diamond
[02:24:58] SPEAKER_01: interview.
[02:24:59] SPEAKER_01: That was really good.
[02:25:00] SPEAKER_01: Total page turner, um, made it.
[02:25:02] It was a great, it was about going in.
[02:25:04] SPEAKER_01: It's about, yeah, it's about the SNC.
[02:25:05] SPEAKER_01: It's okay.
[02:25:06] SPEAKER_01: Jamie, yeah.
[02:25:07] Uh, and then two is I just love reading Morgan Housel and his new book, The Art of Spending
[02:25:12] SPEAKER_01: Money is, is really fun.
[02:25:14] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's where I get most of my, like, latent ideas of, hey, hey, dummy money is
[02:25:19] SPEAKER_01: not going to make you any happier.
[02:25:20] SPEAKER_01: He's a great explainer.
[02:25:21] SPEAKER_02: Oh, great.
[02:25:22] It's pretty good.
[02:25:23] SPEAKER_03: Uh, my two are, um, first one is a reach back to December of last year at the Mars episode,
[02:25:29] SPEAKER_03: um, Emperors of Chocolate by Joel Glenn Brenner.
[02:25:32] SPEAKER_03: Uh-huh.
[02:25:33] SPEAKER_03: You've read that?
[02:25:34] You know, I once, I had a chocolate related story and I flipped through it and I didn't
[02:25:39] SPEAKER_02: ever have time to read the only, but yes, I know that it's the dual history of Hershey
[02:25:43] SPEAKER_03: and Mars together.
[02:25:44] SPEAKER_03: Yep, yep, yep.
[02:25:45] SPEAKER_03: She, uh, it's the, I believe the only big book she ever wrote.
[02:25:50] SPEAKER_03: And, um, it's just a masterpiece.
[02:25:52] SPEAKER_03: It's so, it's so good.
[02:25:53] SPEAKER_03: Uh, the other one, um, Mars Chang's autobiography.
[02:25:57] SPEAKER_03: Oh, we got to read.
[02:25:59] SPEAKER_03: It is currently only in Chinese, uh, but we got to read an English version of it to prep.
[02:26:03] SPEAKER_03: Uh, it's, it's, I mean, do you get more than you do that who translated for you?
[02:26:07] SPEAKER_03: Uh, this, uh, woman Karina Bale did a translation for us.
[02:26:11] SPEAKER_01: Just for you.
[02:26:12] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:26:13] SPEAKER_03: She was working on it as a, as just a pet project, uh, anyway, uh, uh, accelerated it for
[02:26:17] SPEAKER_03: us.
[02:26:18] SPEAKER_03: Uh, okay, books, um, podcasts.
[02:26:20] SPEAKER_03: Number two.
[02:26:21] Well, this is, this is a layup.
[02:26:22] SPEAKER_02: It, the only, the, uh, your podcast is the big addition to my rotation.
[02:26:26] SPEAKER_02: Well, thank you.
[02:26:27] SPEAKER_02: I started in July and I've listened to, I don't know, ten of them or something.
[02:26:31] SPEAKER_02: Well, thank you.
[02:26:32] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:26:33] SPEAKER_02: But what in your, what is in your rotation with the sides acquired?
[02:26:36] Against the rules, of course.
[02:26:38] Again, well, I don't listen to my own thing.
[02:26:39] SPEAKER_02: Uh, I listened to Malcolm Gladwell's revisionist history.
[02:26:42] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[02:26:43] SPEAKER_01: I listened to, uh, the smartless guys because I like them.
[02:26:46] SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
[02:26:47] SPEAKER_02: Your interview on that was great too.
[02:26:49] SPEAKER_02: It was fun to do it.
[02:26:50] SPEAKER_02: Um, what else will I, listen to the daily sum?
[02:26:55] SPEAKER_02: Uh, every now and then I'll dip into a right wing thing just to hear it.
[02:26:59] SPEAKER_02: Just, no, there is that, that, that any, any recommendations?
[02:27:05] No.
[02:27:06] Uh, not really.
[02:27:09] SPEAKER_02: And, and then kind of, you know, random stuff like every now and then Bill Simmons will
[02:27:13] SPEAKER_02: have something I want to hear.
[02:27:14] SPEAKER_02: I love Bill Simmons.
[02:27:15] SPEAKER_02: I just don't have time like it's, it's, it's prolific.
[02:27:18] SPEAKER_02: You have eaten my podcast.
[02:27:21] SPEAKER_02: You eat a lot of my, no, no, no, and I can, and I can tell you where I was, like
[02:27:25] SPEAKER_02: treadmill in Denmark when I listened to the Indian cricket thing.
[02:27:27] SPEAKER_02: Isn't that the most fun thing about that?
[02:27:29] SPEAKER_01: You remember a place, you do remember a place they, they're very
[02:27:31] SPEAKER_02: place specific and, uh, no, it's the acquired podcast is the new thing.
[02:27:37] SPEAKER_02: I haven't, yeah.
[02:27:38] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[02:27:39] How about you all?
[02:27:40] SPEAKER_01: I listened to an episode of Invest Like the Best about a year ago, which
[02:27:46] SPEAKER_01: was a really, really long interview with Graham Duncan.
[02:27:48] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, that was really good.
[02:27:49] SPEAKER_03: That was really good.
[02:27:50] SPEAKER_03: That was originally, did he Patrick do that as like a private podcast?
[02:27:53] SPEAKER_03: And then, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:54] SPEAKER_03: And then he did a shorter version.
[02:27:56] SPEAKER_01: I didn't listen to the shorter version.
[02:27:57] SPEAKER_01: I only listened to the like super long one.
[02:27:59] SPEAKER_01: But, uh, one of my biggest takeaways from that is about having a, uh,
[02:28:03] SPEAKER_01: the correct grip that you don't want to have to type of a grip on your work,
[02:28:08] SPEAKER_01: but you don't want to have to lose a grip.
[02:28:10] SPEAKER_01: You need to play with an appropriate grip for whatever the task
[02:28:16] SPEAKER_01: is that you're trying to do.
[02:28:17] SPEAKER_01: And you'll, if you're gripping too tight, you know, you're going to pull it or
[02:28:20] SPEAKER_01: you're going to, it's going to feel too mechanical, too unnatural.
[02:28:23] SPEAKER_01: And if it's too loose, like, you're not minding the shop enough, you know,
[02:28:26] SPEAKER_01: you're, you get, you're going to get your head back in the game.
[02:28:28] SPEAKER_01: And there's a, yeah, there's a, I've made my career.
[02:28:30] SPEAKER_02: How, just how useful sports analogies are to, to writing.
[02:28:35] SPEAKER_02: Uh, I'm sure to, everything.
[02:28:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:28:36] SPEAKER_02: But these physical memories translate pre-needly to how the mind,
[02:28:41] SPEAKER_02: with the mind is doing too.
[02:28:42] SPEAKER_02: And that, uh, like when I write a book, I'm on a picture's map.
[02:28:46] SPEAKER_02: It takes me back to pitching in high school.
[02:28:48] SPEAKER_02: And I know, and I'm thinking of the, of the reader as the hitter.
[02:28:51] SPEAKER_02: Getting meaning across to a reader is, is tricky in a way that fully
[02:28:57] SPEAKER_02: a hitter is tricky.
[02:28:58] SPEAKER_02: And, and it's just, I can feel that connection.
[02:29:01] SPEAKER_02: And so these physical analogies are really useful, even if they're sometimes
[02:29:04] SPEAKER_02: a stretch.
[02:29:05] SPEAKER_02: Speaking of sports, mine is, uh, the glue guys podcast, which I think we both went
[02:29:09] SPEAKER_03: on this year.
[02:29:10] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:29:10] SPEAKER_03: Uh, it was actually an origin of us, of us, uh, meeting.
[02:29:13] SPEAKER_03: Um, there's got a great.
[02:29:15] SPEAKER_03: They are great.
[02:29:16] SPEAKER_03: I think we told them on the episode, I tell them, um, like, you guys got it.
[02:29:20] SPEAKER_03: Like, you guys got some magic here.
[02:29:21] SPEAKER_03: You got to, uh, got to keep doing this.
[02:29:23] SPEAKER_03: Uh, you keep telling everybody that they run their, their podcast business
[02:29:26] SPEAKER_02: in the wrong way.
[02:29:27] SPEAKER_02: And you're right.
[02:29:28] SPEAKER_02: Uh, you, and you, and you, and you, you depressed everybody else, uh, you
[02:29:31] SPEAKER_02: figured out how to do it.
[02:29:32] SPEAKER_02: Nobody else.
[02:29:33] SPEAKER_02: Well, I thought they, they just, they just, they've got magic.
[02:29:36] SPEAKER_03: Like, and they just like, they just, they are taking it seriously and keeping
[02:29:39] SPEAKER_03: doing it.
[02:29:40] SPEAKER_03: But like, I think it's a really, really, they have the, really rare dynamic
[02:29:44] SPEAKER_03: of like just the three of them together, regardless of they have a guest,
[02:29:49] SPEAKER_03: don't have a guest.
[02:29:49] SPEAKER_03: Like it's, they're, they're equally good.
[02:29:51] SPEAKER_03: They're very different personalities.
[02:29:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:29:53] SPEAKER_01: It helps.
[02:29:53] SPEAKER_01: Can I just say that I'm so, uh, like something inside me feels so crunchy.
[02:29:58] SPEAKER_01: I don't think we've figured out a better way to do it.
[02:30:00] SPEAKER_01: Like I don't think we figured out the way to do it.
[02:30:01] SPEAKER_01: And everybody else should just snap to our way.
[02:30:03] SPEAKER_01: It's like, we have an enormous amount of privilege that we can run a business
[02:30:10] SPEAKER_01: in this way.
[02:30:10] SPEAKER_01: And most people have constraints that prevent.
[02:30:13] SPEAKER_01: I'm just doing this.
[02:30:15] It's not that we're writing everybody else is wrong.
[02:30:16] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[02:30:17] SPEAKER_01: It's that we have like set up a particular system that works for us.
[02:30:20] SPEAKER_01: But it is like you're writing.
[02:30:21] SPEAKER_02: I'm wrong that it really is a way of running a business that we could have done
[02:30:25] SPEAKER_02: with against the rules.
[02:30:27] SPEAKER_02: And it, and I'm going to go think about it.
[02:30:29] SPEAKER_02: Uh, but anyway, so what's our next car?
[02:30:32] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[02:30:32] SPEAKER_02: Next category is, um, videos, movies, movies, movies, movies, TV shows.
[02:30:39] So I just saw a movie two days ago.
[02:30:40] SPEAKER_02: I go two nights ago.
[02:30:41] SPEAKER_02: We went to the theater.
[02:30:42] SPEAKER_02: Whole family went to the theater.
[02:30:43] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[02:30:44] SPEAKER_03: And Jay Kelly.
[02:30:46] It's new.
[02:30:47] SPEAKER_02: Noah Bombak.
[02:30:48] SPEAKER_02: It's new movie.
[02:30:49] SPEAKER_02: And it is, it's George Clooney.
[02:30:51] I guess you'd say he's playing, he's playing George Clooney with a midlife crisis
[02:30:55] SPEAKER_02: that he, that it's, it's, it's a, it's a fame.
[02:30:57] SPEAKER_02: He's playing a famous actor who's kind of sort out, uh, the meaning of his life.
[02:31:03] It's just magical.
[02:31:04] SPEAKER_02: It's a beautiful movie.
[02:31:05] SPEAKER_02: And, and, and I am really ambitious movie in that I was, I've been thinking about it
[02:31:10] kind of since I saw it.
[02:31:11] SPEAKER_02: Like what exactly it was getting across and what was getting across, I think being
[02:31:17] SPEAKER_02: famous like a movie star is, puts you at a certain distance to the world around you.
[02:31:22] SPEAKER_02: And that distance has a price.
[02:31:24] SPEAKER_02: And it was sort of taking the measure of that price.
[02:31:27] But, and, and what makes that more general is that I think everybody has to make
[02:31:33] SPEAKER_02: some decisions about the distance that they keep the world at.
[02:31:37] SPEAKER_02: And, uh, this was a, this was a way of having that conversation and entertaining
[02:31:43] SPEAKER_02: with that distance should be.
[02:31:45] Gotta see it.
[02:31:46] SPEAKER_01: I have so many, but there's one that's like, you're, you're like a TV.
[02:31:50] SPEAKER_01: I love movies and I love television.
[02:31:52] SPEAKER_01: The, um, like I have no video games to recommend, but I have lots of these.
[02:31:55] SPEAKER_01: The one that's just head and shoulders back to everything else.
[02:31:57] SPEAKER_01: And as the greatest performance art I've ever seen in my entire life is the rehearsal season
[02:32:02] SPEAKER_01: two.
[02:32:02] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[02:32:04] SPEAKER_01: Nathan Fielder and Eric Natarnacola, who we actually got to work with.
[02:32:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[02:32:09] SPEAKER_01: Eric and A24 films shot the sort of concert film part of our radio city show.
[02:32:17] SPEAKER_01: And collaborating with Eric was unbelievable, but he's so great.
[02:32:19] SPEAKER_01: But before any of that, I saw the rehearsal season two and my jaw is just on the
[02:32:24] SPEAKER_01: four with the level you were talking about this for months ambition.
[02:32:28] SPEAKER_01: Uh, they're, the
[02:32:31] SPEAKER_01: Nathan's a complete psycho.
[02:32:32] SPEAKER_01: And it's the highest commitment to the bed I've ever seen in any form of media.
[02:32:35] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I, I don't want to spoil anything, but have you seen it?
[02:32:39] SPEAKER_01: I've not seen it.
[02:32:39] SPEAKER_01: I will now go see it.
[02:32:41] SPEAKER_01: It is, uh, uh, I was shaking.
[02:32:44] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[02:32:46] All right.
[02:32:47] SPEAKER_03: I'm a, I'm a lighter video guy.
[02:32:48] SPEAKER_03: I'm a YouTube guy mostly.
[02:32:49] SPEAKER_03: Um, my, my YouTube, uh, uh, for the years is, is when I've recommended before a past
[02:32:55] SPEAKER_03: collab, uh, Doug Demiro is still like killing it.
[02:32:58] SPEAKER_03: I just like, I think Doug is probably my favorite YouTuber.
[02:33:00] SPEAKER_03: Like he's just, uh, what does he do?
[02:33:02] SPEAKER_02: Cause I don't know.
[02:33:03] SPEAKER_02: He is, uh, he's the biggest car reviewer.

[02:35:01] SPEAKER_03: Just me.
[02:35:02] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:35:02] SPEAKER_03: So one of the greatest moments in my parenting journey, thus far, my older daughter is for,
[02:35:07] SPEAKER_03: is I got her in the video games.
[02:35:10] SPEAKER_03: We play video games together now.
[02:35:11] SPEAKER_03: Every night is just like it's the best.
[02:35:12] SPEAKER_03: And like, this is what I have been waiting for.
[02:35:16] But I need to give a shout out again to Sea of Stars, which is an indie throwback RPG,
[02:35:22] SPEAKER_03: which I bought just for me on my steam deck.
[02:35:24] SPEAKER_03: And we were on vacation in Santa Barbara.
[02:35:26] SPEAKER_03: And she was like, Dad, what are you doing?
[02:35:28] SPEAKER_03: And that, like, that was it.
[02:35:29] SPEAKER_03: Like, I wasn't trying.
[02:35:31] SPEAKER_03: It was like, she came up to me as I'm playing, you know, this, like, indie RPG.
[02:35:36] SPEAKER_03: And like, she started playing it.
[02:35:38] SPEAKER_03: Like, that was like, I never would have guessed that this was my daughter's entry into video games.

[02:35:51] It's great for her.
[02:35:52] SPEAKER_03: It's awesome.
[02:35:53] So your daughter is an age where she'll do anything you want to do.
[02:35:56] SPEAKER_02: No.
[02:35:56] SPEAKER_02: Because she wants to be with you.
[02:35:58] SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't know my daughter.
[02:36:01] It's extremely independent.
[02:36:03] SPEAKER_01: It's anomalous and awesome.

[02:36:05] SPEAKER_01: This is a rare occurrence.

[02:36:14] SPEAKER_01: What are some products that you have come to own in the last year that you
[02:36:17] SPEAKER_01: have just thought are awesome or improved quality in life?
[02:36:20] SPEAKER_01: I found a new pen.
[02:36:20] SPEAKER_01: I got it here.
[02:36:21] SPEAKER_02: Let's see what it is.
[02:36:22] SPEAKER_02: And it's just like, I need a pen that had just the right sort of fine point.
[02:36:27] SPEAKER_02: And then it, that it's kind of generous with the ink,
[02:36:31] but it doesn't explode on an airplane.
[02:36:33] And doesn't smear.
[02:36:34] SPEAKER_02: I imagine.
[02:36:34] SPEAKER_02: Doesn't smear it.
[02:36:35] SPEAKER_02: I'm looking at it now.
[02:36:36] SPEAKER_02: The R is Tekka roller ball pen.
[02:36:38] SPEAKER_02: 0.7 fine.
[02:36:40] SPEAKER_02: And I just ordered a whole case of them because it's fine.

[02:36:49] SPEAKER_01: That company is going to have a spying lot of process.
[02:36:52] SPEAKER_01: So that pen is a thing.
[02:36:54] SPEAKER_01: And what else other products this year?
[02:36:57] The Fuji Film X100VI.
[02:36:59] SPEAKER_01: I previously specifically did not carve it out and carve it out a different camera.
[02:37:03] SPEAKER_01: I've started carrying the Fuji Film and now love it.

[02:37:15] SPEAKER_02: Like, camera here.
[02:37:16] SPEAKER_02: So, I think the X-Efficio, that's that's it.
[02:37:18] SPEAKER_03: No, it's not weird, but we're not going to target those.
[02:37:20] SPEAKER_02: That wasn't this year.
[02:37:21] SPEAKER_02: That wasn't.
[02:37:22] SPEAKER_02: We're only talking about a bunch of like, not until I get the rules.
[02:37:24] SPEAKER_02: But anyway, that wasn't this year.
[02:37:26] SPEAKER_02: But this year, actually, on my feet, these are things.
[02:37:30] SPEAKER_02: These socks, I ran out of white socks in London.
[02:37:33] SPEAKER_02: I went over to, is it uniclo?
[02:37:35] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:37:36] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:36] SPEAKER_03: And they didn't have any.
[02:37:37] SPEAKER_02: I was just looking for athletic socks, right?
[02:37:39] SPEAKER_02: And they have these other things instead.
[02:37:41] SPEAKER_02: They've turned out to be so much better than the athletic socks.
[02:37:44] SPEAKER_02: And they come in different colors.
[02:37:46] SPEAKER_02: So you can, like, a light gray.
[02:37:48] SPEAKER_02: You can wear them as dress socks.
[02:37:49] SPEAKER_02: You can wear them as athletic socks.
[02:37:51] SPEAKER_02: And they, like, whatever I, I don't know about you.
[02:37:54] SPEAKER_02: Whenever I find something I love,
[02:37:56] SPEAKER_02: what's about to happen is it's about to be discontinued.
[02:37:58] SPEAKER_02: So you need to buy all of them.
[02:37:59] SPEAKER_02: You need to buy all of them, yes.
[02:38:00] SPEAKER_02: Right, so I, I'm, I got, I didn't get quite all of them
[02:38:03] SPEAKER_02: because I was flying, I got them in London.
[02:38:04] SPEAKER_02: I was going to have to fly back with them.
[02:38:05] SPEAKER_02: But I bought, I bought, basically, what was in the store at the moment.
[02:38:09] SPEAKER_02: And these shoes.
[02:38:10] SPEAKER_02: So, those ons?
[02:38:12] SPEAKER_02: These are ons.
[02:38:13] SPEAKER_02: And oddly, I spent a couple days with Roger Federer this summer.
[02:38:17] SPEAKER_02: And I, and I just discovered them.
[02:38:19] SPEAKER_02: So I, we had the, the on conversation
[02:38:22] SPEAKER_02: and made me kind of like acceptable to him.
[02:38:25] SPEAKER_02: But it was, but the, I think these, these ons, I was a Hoka guy.
[02:38:28] SPEAKER_02: Oh.
[02:38:29] SPEAKER_02: Also great.
[02:38:30] SPEAKER_01: Also great.

[02:38:33] SPEAKER_02: They let, they let you, they let you, they let, they got rid of their stores.
[02:38:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:38:37] SPEAKER_02: They thought it's all going to be online and on and Hoka roll in.
[02:38:40] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[02:38:40] SPEAKER_02: And I'm a little torn, but not that torn.
[02:38:43] SPEAKER_02: I'm kind of, these ons are just like, un, there.
[02:38:45] SPEAKER_02: And I don't know where it is.
[02:38:47] SPEAKER_02: It's, it's, uh, especially the white ones.
[02:38:49] I get, I'm getting criticized for it because I start wearing them instead of
[02:38:53] SPEAKER_02: even dress shoes and like on, I went on the cold bear with, with these.
[02:38:58] SPEAKER_02: And like, I got eight calls and you can't do that again.
[02:39:01] SPEAKER_02: Really?
[02:39:01] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[02:39:02] SPEAKER_02: Like it looks, it's just,
[02:39:03] SPEAKER_02: I see you get wearing ons all the time.
[02:39:04] SPEAKER_03: I guess.
[02:39:04] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, they just don't look good on TV or whatever.
[02:39:06] SPEAKER_02: So, but I've been, I've been overwearing both the unit close socks and the,
[02:39:10] SPEAKER_02: but the, but I've been at the sign of enthusiasm.

[02:39:23] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I don't know.

[02:42:53] SPEAKER_03: It's a big claim.
[02:42:54] SPEAKER_02: It's this guy in Australia in Brisbane and he made it.
[02:42:59] SPEAKER_03: He was, I think, an animator for Peppa Pig and then made this blend.
[02:43:02] SPEAKER_03: It's like-
[02:43:03] SPEAKER_03: But the claim isn't that crazy.
[02:43:04] SPEAKER_01: The pair's like, I love Bluey.
[02:43:05] SPEAKER_03: Like, it's just so-
[02:43:06] SPEAKER_03: Disney agrees with David.
[02:43:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[02:43:08] SPEAKER_03: Disney has been trying to buy Bluey for years.
[02:43:11] SPEAKER_03: Oh.
[02:43:12] SPEAKER_03: For ever escalating amounts of money.
[02:43:14] SPEAKER_03: And they just did a deal which I think is the first of its kind
[02:43:17] SPEAKER_01: to use Bluey IP in the Disney universe without owning it.
[02:43:22] SPEAKER_01: I think news just came out today that Bluey is coming to Animal Kingdom
[02:43:26] SPEAKER_03: in Disney World in 2026.
[02:43:29] SPEAKER_03: It's basically like-
[02:43:30] SPEAKER_03: Who owns Bluey?
[02:43:31] SPEAKER_03: It's think of it as Pixar of this generation.
[02:43:32] SPEAKER_03: Just Bluey owned by his creator?
[02:43:34] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[02:43:34] SPEAKER_03: Who is it?
[02:43:35] SPEAKER_03: Joe Brown.
[02:43:35] SPEAKER_03: This is Guy.
[02:43:36] SPEAKER_03: It's like the Muppets.
[02:43:38] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:38] SPEAKER_03: It's like Jim Henson and the Muppets.
[02:43:40] SPEAKER_03: So in New York, in New York City,
[02:43:43] SPEAKER_03: you can buy tickets.
[02:43:44] SPEAKER_03: You get like a 45-minute window.
[02:43:45] SPEAKER_03: You can take your family, you can take your kids
[02:43:47] SPEAKER_03: to Bluey's house, a recreation of Bluey's house,
[02:43:51] SPEAKER_03: inside a building in Union Square.
[02:43:53] SPEAKER_03: And that's like great.
[02:43:54] SPEAKER_03: If you've got kids in the Bluey,
[02:43:56] SPEAKER_03: go to New York, take them to Bluey at the camp.
[02:43:58] SPEAKER_01: My kids would find that a little strange.
[02:43:59] SPEAKER_01: Okay?
[02:44:01] It's true.
[02:44:01] We keep saying kids, kids up here.
[02:44:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:03] SPEAKER_01: You know, kids up here.
