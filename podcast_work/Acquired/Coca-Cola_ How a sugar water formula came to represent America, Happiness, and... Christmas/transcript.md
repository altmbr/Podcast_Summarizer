[00:00:00] David, I cannot believe we're about to do a four-hour podcast on syrup sugar and water.
[00:00:06] Ben Gilbert: I mean, that's the entire business.
[00:00:08] Ben Gilbert: It's just syrup sugar and water combined and it's a $300 billion company.
[00:00:12] Ben Gilbert: Well, babe, you know what I'm going to say to you in response to that.
[00:00:16] David Rezenthal: Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life?
[00:00:19] David Rezenthal: Or do you want to come with me and change the world?
[00:00:20] David Rezenthal: Ooh, save it, David.
[00:00:22] Ben Gilbert: Save it.
[00:00:23] Ben Gilbert: Who got the truth?
[00:00:25] David Rezenthal: Is it you, is it you, is it you?
[00:00:29] David Rezenthal: Who got the truth now?
[00:00:31] David Rezenthal: Is it you, is it you, is it you?
[00:00:34] David Rezenthal: Sit me down, say it straight.
[00:00:36] David Rezenthal: Another story on the way.
[00:00:39] David Rezenthal: Who got the truth?
[00:00:40] David Rezenthal: Welcome to the Fall 2025 season of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories
[00:00:46] Ben Gilbert: and playbooks behind them.
[00:00:47] Ben Gilbert: I'm Ben Gilbert.
[00:00:48] Ben Gilbert: I'm David Rezenthal.
[00:00:50] David Rezenthal: And we are your hosts.
[00:00:52] Ben Gilbert: Charlie Munger has a famous thought experiment.
[00:00:55] Ben Gilbert: It's the 1880s.
[00:00:57] Ben Gilbert: You want to build a company from scratch that eventually becomes worth $2 trillion starting
[00:01:03] Ben Gilbert: with just $2 million.
[00:01:04] Ben Gilbert: So you're looking for a $1 million ex-return or as Charlie puts it, a Lala Paloza outcome.
[00:01:09] Ben Gilbert: Of course he does.
[00:01:10] David Rezenthal: Very Charlie.
[00:01:11] Ben Gilbert: Very Charlie.
[00:01:12] David Rezenthal: The constraint is it must be a non-alcoholic beverage business.
[00:01:18] David Rezenthal: And another constraint, it must throw off many billions of dollars in dividends along
[00:01:23] Ben Gilbert: the way to your shareholders.
[00:01:24] Ben Gilbert: Okay.
[00:01:25] Ben Gilbert: This sounds almost impossible.
[00:01:27] Ben Gilbert: But what ideas could you possibly dream up to give it your best shot?
[00:01:32] Well, I think the first question I would have is whether I could include any now illegal
[00:01:38] David Rezenthal: drugs in my product.
[00:01:43] That certainly helps.
[00:01:45] Ben Gilbert: So to build this giant valuable company, the first thing you need to know is you're not
[00:01:49] Ben Gilbert: going to get there with something generic.
[00:01:50] Ben Gilbert: So you have to build a brand that grows into a strong protected trademark.
[00:01:55] Ben Gilbert: And to reach that scale, it must be global.
[00:01:57] Ben Gilbert: So it has to have a taste that's universal in all countries.
[00:02:01] Ben Gilbert: Now conveniently for you, all humans do require large amounts of water every day to live.
[00:02:06] Ben Gilbert: So it is a giant market.
[00:02:08] Ben Gilbert: Yes.
[00:02:09] Ben Gilbert: But you're not going to fully replace water.
[00:02:11] Ben Gilbert: It's just going to be kind of a small fraction of the time.
[00:02:14] Ben Gilbert: So under the beverage itself, you're going to want to optimize it to maximize the rewards
[00:02:19] Ben Gilbert: of ingesting it as refreshing as possible in any climate.
[00:02:25] Ben Gilbert: Now you're going to want to do a bunch of other stuff too.
[00:02:27] Ben Gilbert: You want to fill it with calories to give energy.
[00:02:30] Ben Gilbert: You want the flavor, texture and aroma that makes it pleasurable to consume.
[00:02:35] Ben Gilbert: And you should throw in some brain stimulants like caffeine and sugar.
[00:02:39] Ben Gilbert: That's sort of the ideal product mix among other things.
[00:02:42] Ben Gilbert: Yeah.
[00:02:44] Ben Gilbert: You've got the kind of competitors to swoop in for a free ride on the market you just created.
[00:02:47] Ben Gilbert: So you should make sure your product, the real thing is available everywhere anytime someone
[00:02:53] Ben Gilbert: asks for it.
[00:02:54] David Rezenthal: I see what you did there at a very low price.
[00:02:56] Ben Gilbert: So there's really not an opportunity for competitors to ever fill the vacuum.
[00:03:00] Ben Gilbert: There's never a reason for anyone to reach for anything other than your product always,
[00:03:05] always David.
[00:03:07] Ben Gilbert: And since everyone is not thinking about beverages all the time like you probably are as the
[00:03:11] Ben Gilbert: the proprietor of this business,
[00:03:13] Ben Gilbert: you're gonna wanna associate your beverage
[00:03:15] Ben Gilbert: with all the things that they are thinking about,
[00:03:17] Ben Gilbert: the good life, family, your sports heroes,
[00:03:21] Ben Gilbert: beautiful people, Christmas.
[00:03:24] Ben Gilbert: I mean, happiness generally,
[00:03:25] Ben Gilbert: you are gonna wanna have a Pavlovian association
[00:03:28] Ben Gilbert: between your drink and happiness,
[00:03:31] Ben Gilbert: and you're gonna wanna spend huge amounts of money
[00:03:33] Ben Gilbert: blanketing the entire world with this messaging.
[00:03:37] Ben Gilbert: Now to build something this valuable,
[00:03:39] Ben Gilbert: you also can't have a big expensive,
[00:03:41] Ben Gilbert: bottling and distribution operation,
[00:03:43] Ben Gilbert: so you're gonna need to figure out some clever way
[00:03:45] Ben Gilbert: to get someone else's capital and employees for that,
[00:03:48] Ben Gilbert: while still maintaining the control
[00:03:50] Ben Gilbert: that your brand requires.
[00:03:52] Ben Gilbert: I mean, ideally it would be great
[00:03:54] Ben Gilbert: if you could serve the entire world
[00:03:55] Ben Gilbert: with just a few of your own production facilities.
[00:03:58] Ben Gilbert: That would be pretty great.
[00:04:00] Yes, and the last thing,
[00:04:02] Ben Gilbert: you must never, under any circumstances,
[00:04:05] Ben Gilbert: change the formula or flavor.
[00:04:09] David Rezenthal: We were doing great there.
[00:04:12] We were doing great.
[00:04:13] Ben Gilbert: But this might be why Coca-Cola
[00:04:16] David Rezenthal: is not a two trillion dollar company today.
[00:04:18] David Rezenthal: Well, I'll debate that at the end of the episode.
[00:04:21] Ben Gilbert: Listeners, of course, this playbook
[00:04:23] Ben Gilbert: is almost exactly what the Coca-Cola company has done,
[00:04:26] Ben Gilbert: and they've done it over the course of 140 years.
[00:04:31] Ben Gilbert: It has its roots all the way back in the Civil War.
[00:04:33] Ben Gilbert: It grew up through the rise of the automobile,
[00:04:35] Ben Gilbert: through the Great Depression, through two world wars.
[00:04:38] Ben Gilbert: It seamlessly and shamelessly integrated
[00:04:41] Ben Gilbert: into the hippie culture of the 70s,
[00:04:43] Ben Gilbert: and then of course,
[00:04:44] Ben Gilbert: it had the epic Cola Wars of the 80s and onward.
[00:04:48] Ben Gilbert: And David, I would say this episode,
[00:04:50] Ben Gilbert: perhaps more than any other that we've covered,
[00:04:52] Ben Gilbert: is about America.
[00:04:54] Well, it's about America,
[00:04:56] David Rezenthal: and then America,
[00:04:57] David Rezenthal: inserting itself everywhere else in the rest of the world.
[00:05:01] Can't wait to dive into it.
[00:05:03] Ben Gilbert: Well, listeners, this episode was selected
[00:05:05] Ben Gilbert: by you.
[00:05:06] Ben Gilbert: Last month, we asked our email subscribers
[00:05:08] Ben Gilbert: to vote on what company we should cover next,
[00:05:10] Ben Gilbert: and Coca-Cola was the overwhelming favorite.
[00:05:13] Ben Gilbert: So thank you to all of you who participated.
[00:05:15] Ben Gilbert: You can join that email list at acquired.fm-slash-email
[00:05:18] Ben Gilbert: to get in on the next round of voting,
[00:05:20] Ben Gilbert: and that same email list is getting a lot better.
[00:05:23] Ben Gilbert: We just did a big overhaul,
[00:05:25] Ben Gilbert: so each monthly email will now have episode summaries,
[00:05:28] Ben Gilbert: our big takeaways from the company after studying it,
[00:05:31] Ben Gilbert: and exclusive photos from our research process.
[00:05:34] Ben Gilbert: So never miss an episode drop by signing up
[00:05:36] Ben Gilbert: at acquired.fm-slash-email
[00:05:39] Ben Gilbert: or clicking the link in the show notes.
[00:05:41] Ben Gilbert: Before we dive in,
[00:05:42] Ben Gilbert: we want to briefly thank our presenting partner,
[00:05:44] Ben Gilbert: JP Morgan Payments.
[00:05:46] Ben Gilbert: Yes, just like how we say,
[00:05:48] David Rezenthal: every company has a story,
[00:05:49] David Rezenthal: every company's story is powered by payments,
[00:05:52] David Rezenthal: and JP Morgan Payments
[00:05:53] David Rezenthal: is a part of so many of their journeys
[00:05:54] David Rezenthal: from seed to IPO and beyond.
[00:05:57] So with that, this show is not investment advice.
[00:05:59] Ben Gilbert: David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss,
[00:06:01] Ben Gilbert: and this show is for informational
[00:06:03] Ben Gilbert: and entertainment purposes only.
[00:06:05] Ben Gilbert: David, where do we start our story?
[00:06:08] Well, Ben, as you so aptly set up there,
[00:06:11] David Rezenthal: the story of the birth of Coca-Cola
[00:06:14] David Rezenthal: starts arguably with the birth of America,
[00:06:17] David Rezenthal: as we know it today,
[00:06:18] David Rezenthal: in a newly re-unified United States of America,
[00:06:23] David Rezenthal: following the Civil War.
[00:06:25] David Rezenthal: Mark Pendergrass, in his great book for God, Country,
[00:06:29] David Rezenthal: and Coca-Cola,
[00:06:30] David Rezenthal: that was a main source for this episode,
[00:06:31] David Rezenthal: has a great quote.
[00:06:33] David Rezenthal: He says,
[00:06:34] David Rezenthal: Coca-Cola remains emblematic of the best and worst of America.
[00:06:39] David Rezenthal: It is a microcosm of American history.
[00:06:41] David Rezenthal: Coca-Cola grew up with the country,
[00:06:43] David Rezenthal: shaping and shaped by the times.
[00:06:45] David Rezenthal: The drink helped to alter not only consumption patterns,
[00:06:48] David Rezenthal: but attitudes towards leisure, work, advertising,
[00:06:51] David Rezenthal: sex, family, life, and patriotism.
[00:06:54] David Rezenthal: You know, just a few small things.
[00:06:56] David Rezenthal: So if you remember,
[00:06:58] David Rezenthal: back to our Standard Oil series a couple of years ago,
[00:07:02] David Rezenthal: one of the biggest industries in post-Civil War America
[00:07:06] David Rezenthal: was oil of a certain kind,
[00:07:09] David Rezenthal: but it wasn't the same kind of oil as Standard Oil.
[00:07:12] David Rezenthal: It was snake oil.
[00:07:13] David Rezenthal: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, good hook.
[00:07:16] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, or as it gave to me known after the war,
[00:07:19] David Rezenthal: patent medicines,
[00:07:21] David Rezenthal: before this industry,
[00:07:23] David Rezenthal: there were no national brands in America or anywhere else.
[00:07:28] David Rezenthal: There were railroads,
[00:07:30] David Rezenthal: and there were big national industrial companies,
[00:07:32] David Rezenthal: but there weren't any national consumer product companies.
[00:07:36] David Rezenthal: Everything was local.
[00:07:37] David Rezenthal: There weren't any CPG companies,
[00:07:39] David Rezenthal: there weren't any supermarkets,
[00:07:40] David Rezenthal: there weren't any car companies,
[00:07:42] David Rezenthal: there weren't gas stations,
[00:07:43] David Rezenthal: and there weren't advertising agencies to go along with them.
[00:07:48] David Rezenthal: Patent medicines were sort of like this seed crystal
[00:07:51] David Rezenthal: that created the modern American consumer business.
[00:07:55] David Rezenthal: And what were patent medicines?
[00:07:57] Ben Gilbert: So going back again to our Standard Oil series,
[00:08:01] David Rezenthal: John D. Rockefeller's dad, if you remember,
[00:08:04] David Rezenthal: was a traveling snake oil salesman.
[00:08:07] David Rezenthal: Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:08] David Rezenthal: In his days back before the Civil War,
[00:08:11] David Rezenthal: these were medicines that promised like a cure
[00:08:15] David Rezenthal: to all sorts of ailments,
[00:08:17] David Rezenthal: nausea, indigestion, headaches, cancer, tuberculosis,
[00:08:22] David Rezenthal: skull fractures, paralysis, and impotence.
[00:08:26] David Rezenthal: All based on zero research, zero studies,
[00:08:29] Ben Gilbert: zero science, nothing.
[00:08:31] Ben Gilbert: The Civil War changed all that,
[00:08:34] David Rezenthal: not necessarily for the better.
[00:08:37] David Rezenthal: So after the war,
[00:08:39] David Rezenthal: there were so many wounded soldiers in America
[00:08:42] David Rezenthal: that were in such chronic pain
[00:08:45] David Rezenthal: that the market for medicines like this
[00:08:48] David Rezenthal: from these snake oil salesmen just exploded,
[00:08:52] David Rezenthal: a huge, huge percentage of veterans
[00:08:56] David Rezenthal: from the Civil War developed what is called Army disease,
[00:08:59] David Rezenthal: quote unquote, i.e. they were addicted to morphine
[00:09:03] David Rezenthal: for the rest of their lives as a pain killer,
[00:09:05] which actually did work.
[00:09:06] Ben Gilbert: Yes, that actually did work very well at killing pain.
[00:09:11] David Rezenthal: And it wasn't just physical injuries from the war
[00:09:13] David Rezenthal: and the soldiers who fought in it.
[00:09:14] David Rezenthal: The Civil War ripped America apart.
[00:09:17] David Rezenthal: I mean, these guys and their families
[00:09:19] David Rezenthal: had just gone through this devastating trauma.
[00:09:22] David Rezenthal: I mean, there were so many deaths, so many wounded,
[00:09:24] David Rezenthal: it was families fighting against one another,
[00:09:27] David Rezenthal: it was truly arguably the worst moment
[00:09:29] David Rezenthal: in our nation's history.
[00:09:30] David Rezenthal: Yep, so naturally,
[00:09:32] David Rezenthal: whenever there's a big problem,
[00:09:35] David Rezenthal: American capitalism sees a big opportunity.
[00:09:38] David Rezenthal: So some of these enterprising, traveling snake oil salesmen
[00:09:42] David Rezenthal: started scaling up the medicines that they were making
[00:09:45] David Rezenthal: to meet all this new demand.
[00:09:48] David Rezenthal: And as they scale up and they start to standardize
[00:09:50] David Rezenthal: the products that they are offering,
[00:09:53] David Rezenthal: this industry comes to be known as patent medicines.
[00:09:57] David Rezenthal: Now, most of these medicines were not actually patented,
[00:10:00] David Rezenthal: but as the producer of them, you wanted customers
[00:10:03] David Rezenthal: and would be competitors to think that they were,
[00:10:06] David Rezenthal: that there was some sort of barrier to entry, yes.
[00:10:09] Ben Gilbert: So pretty quickly, these newly scaling patent medicine guys
[00:10:14] David Rezenthal: discover that the best way to reinforce that message
[00:10:17] David Rezenthal: with consumers and to stimulate demand was advertising,
[00:10:22] David Rezenthal: especially in newspapers.
[00:10:23] David Rezenthal: And this is the birth of the advertising industry in America.
[00:10:27] David Rezenthal: Really?
[00:10:28] David Rezenthal: It's these patent medicines that start spending
[00:10:30] David Rezenthal: the first real scale dollars in newspapers,
[00:10:33] David Rezenthal: which are also coming up an industrializing post-civil war
[00:10:37] David Rezenthal: and building the business model of the media industry
[00:10:40] David Rezenthal: as we know it today,
[00:10:42] David Rezenthal: because just like you were talking about
[00:10:44] David Rezenthal: in your great Charlie Thought experiment from the intro,
[00:10:47] David Rezenthal: what are these patent medicines?
[00:10:50] David Rezenthal: It's just commodities like leaves and like nuts
[00:10:53] David Rezenthal: and water and stuff that go into these things.
[00:10:55] David Rezenthal: I mean, extracts, extracts, right?
[00:10:57] Ben Gilbert: Okay.
[00:10:59] David Rezenthal: It's super cheap commodities that are very easy to obtain
[00:11:04] David Rezenthal: in great quantities, very easy to then produce
[00:11:08] David Rezenthal: into your product and transform.
[00:11:10] David Rezenthal: And then pretty small relative to other products,
[00:11:14] David Rezenthal: easy to transport around the country,
[00:11:16] David Rezenthal: you do start to get some of these patent medicines
[00:11:19] David Rezenthal: that scale up and build early national brands in this day.
[00:11:23] David Rezenthal: So you might think that all this is like ancient history,
[00:11:26] David Rezenthal: a whole bunch of products that we still buy today
[00:11:31] David Rezenthal: started as patent medicines,
[00:11:33] David Rezenthal: Lutin's cough drops, Vix vapor rub,
[00:11:36] David Rezenthal: Vaseline, Listery, the mouth watch, all patent medicines.
[00:11:41] David Rezenthal: Those are patent medicines that are still used
[00:11:42] David Rezenthal: for sort of a health purpose today.
[00:11:45] David Rezenthal: Plenty of products that we still use in consume today
[00:11:49] David Rezenthal: started as patent medicines,
[00:11:50] David Rezenthal: but are no longer marketed as medicines.
[00:11:53] David Rezenthal: Graham crackers started as a patent medicine.
[00:11:56] David Rezenthal: Really?
[00:11:57] David Rezenthal: Grape nuts, the cereal.
[00:11:59] Neither grape nor nuts.
[00:12:00] Ben Gilbert: Angostura bitters.
[00:12:02] David Rezenthal: You know the bitters that you didn't like old fastens stuff.
[00:12:04] David Rezenthal: That was a patent medicine.
[00:12:05] David Rezenthal: Okay, that makes sense.
[00:12:06] Ben Gilbert: That's squarely what I believe a patent medicine is.
[00:12:09] David Rezenthal: Yep.
[00:12:09] David Rezenthal: And then a couple things you might be familiar with.
[00:12:13] David Rezenthal: Dr. Pepper.
[00:12:14] David Rezenthal: Really?
[00:12:15] Ben Gilbert: I didn't know Dr. Pepper was that old.
[00:12:17] Ben Gilbert: Yep.
[00:12:18] David Rezenthal: Dr. Pepper predates Coca-Cola.
[00:12:20] David Rezenthal: Huh.
[00:12:21] David Rezenthal: And of course, Coca-Cola started just the same way
[00:12:26] David Rezenthal: as a patent medicine,
[00:12:28] David Rezenthal: which brings us to Dr. John Pemberton,
[00:12:32] David Rezenthal: a Confederate war veteran who had not only been stabbed,
[00:12:36] David Rezenthal: he had also been shot during the war
[00:12:39] David Rezenthal: and got army disease just like all these other soldiers
[00:12:42] David Rezenthal: and was addicted to morphine for the rest of his life.
[00:12:46] David Rezenthal: So after the war, he moves to Atlanta
[00:12:48] David Rezenthal: and as part of his sort of entrepreneurial aspirations
[00:12:53] David Rezenthal: in this new patent medicine consumer economy
[00:12:56] David Rezenthal: and also to probably solve his own problem,
[00:12:59] David Rezenthal: he starts casting about for other drugs
[00:13:01] David Rezenthal: that could cure him and others of army disease.
[00:13:05] David Rezenthal: And that is how in the mid 1880s,
[00:13:07] David Rezenthal: he learns about a new miracle drug
[00:13:10] David Rezenthal: sweeping America, promising to cure all ills,
[00:13:14] David Rezenthal: including army disease, cocaine.
[00:13:18] David Rezenthal: Cocaine was really, really in America in the 1880s.
[00:13:25] David Rezenthal: Perhaps foreshadowing a little bit the 1980s in America
[00:13:28] David Rezenthal: as we will get to you later in the episode.
[00:13:30] David Rezenthal: Except in the 1880s, it's really legal
[00:13:33] Ben Gilbert: and really broadly encouraged.
[00:13:35] Ben Gilbert: Certainly there's no FDA or anything to make it illegal,
[00:13:38] Ben Gilbert: but society's posture toward cocaine wasn't bad.
[00:13:42] It was like caffeine today.
[00:13:43] David Rezenthal: Right, they did not really discover the addictive nature of it
[00:13:47] Ben Gilbert: or demonize the addictive nature of it yet.
[00:13:49] Ben Gilbert: Yep, or the side effects, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:13:52] David Rezenthal: So pretty quickly cocaine becomes the most popular
[00:13:57] David Rezenthal: patent medicine ingredient out there.
[00:14:00] It's probably the only ingredient that actually did anything.
[00:14:02] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:03] David Rezenthal: And there is a product on the market,
[00:14:05] David Rezenthal: an imported product from France.
[00:14:08] David Rezenthal: You can't make this up that quickly becomes
[00:14:11] David Rezenthal: the most popular delivery vehicle for cocaine.
[00:14:14] David Rezenthal: A cocaine fortified wine from Bordeaux in France
[00:14:19] David Rezenthal: called Vin Mariani.
[00:14:21] David Rezenthal: It's like the most extreme forloco you could ever dream of.
[00:14:23] Ben Gilbert: Exactly, exactly.
[00:14:25] David Rezenthal: Yes.
[00:14:26] David Rezenthal: So this sounds utterly ridiculous today,
[00:14:29] David Rezenthal: but let me read you the list of public endorsers
[00:14:34] David Rezenthal: of Vin Mariani.
[00:14:35] David Rezenthal: Like testimonies in the Rolex parlance.
[00:14:39] David Rezenthal: Thomas Edison, Buffalo Bill Cody,
[00:14:43] David Rezenthal: United States president William McKinley,
[00:14:46] David Rezenthal: gets even better, Queen Victoria of England,
[00:14:50] David Rezenthal: and not one, but three consecutive popes in the Vatican.
[00:14:56] David Rezenthal: All swore by Vin Mariani.
[00:14:59] David Rezenthal: It feels like a thing I would be swearing by and endorsing too.
[00:15:02] Ben Gilbert: I imagine once you start, it's the best thing ever.
[00:15:04] Ben Gilbert: So entrepreneurial Pemberton in Atlanta
[00:15:08] David Rezenthal: sees Vin Mariani's success and is like,
[00:15:10] David Rezenthal: hmm, why wonder if there's a way that I could copy
[00:15:13] David Rezenthal: and improve on that?
[00:15:15] David Rezenthal: And the way he comes up to improve upon it
[00:15:18] David Rezenthal: is to add caffeine to the mix.
[00:15:21] David Rezenthal: Why not?
[00:15:22] David Rezenthal: Yeah, why not?
[00:15:23] David Rezenthal: He decides that he's going to get the caffeine
[00:15:25] David Rezenthal: from African colunuts, K-O-L-A, colunuts,
[00:15:30] David Rezenthal: which we should say is the first introduction
[00:15:32] Ben Gilbert: of the word cola period in the American lexicon.
[00:15:37] Ben Gilbert: Cola drinks were not a thing.
[00:15:39] Ben Gilbert: Yep, and it's very bitter,
[00:15:40] David Rezenthal: but the reason he chooses it is it has
[00:15:43] David Rezenthal: an even greater caffeine concentration than coffee beans.
[00:15:48] David Rezenthal: He really wants this product to work.
[00:15:50] David Rezenthal: So Pemberton starts selling Pemberton's French wine coca,
[00:15:55] David Rezenthal: which is still wine,
[00:15:57] David Rezenthal: but is now infused both with coca leaves for the cocaine
[00:16:01] David Rezenthal: and colunuts for the caffeine.
[00:16:04] David Rezenthal: And it's a hit.
[00:16:06] David Rezenthal: This could not have tasted good.
[00:16:08] No, I can't imagine what it tasted.
[00:16:10] David Rezenthal: Like, President Eulissie's S grant becomes a fan
[00:16:14] David Rezenthal: and Pemberton starts selling like thousands
[00:16:16] David Rezenthal: and thousands of bottles in and around Atlanta.
[00:16:19] David Rezenthal: Which makes sense.
[00:16:20] David Rezenthal: People are drinking it for its drug-like medicinal qualities,
[00:16:23] Ben Gilbert: not that it's in any way refreshing.
[00:16:26] Yep.
[00:16:27] David Rezenthal: Now, I say bottles, keep that in mind here.
[00:16:31] David Rezenthal: Boddling technology in the 1880s is not what it is today.
[00:16:36] David Rezenthal: Not very good at preserving liquids or foods.
[00:16:41] David Rezenthal: Certainly not good at preserving carbonation.
[00:16:43] David Rezenthal: However, because this is a wine at this point in time,
[00:16:47] David Rezenthal: wine has natural preservatives in it.
[00:16:49] David Rezenthal: So it's self-stable so you can sell bottles of wine.
[00:16:52] David Rezenthal: If people have been selling bottles of wine
[00:16:53] David Rezenthal: for centuries at this point in time.
[00:16:55] David Rezenthal: So then prohibition hits.
[00:16:57] Ben Gilbert: Parties over.
[00:16:58] Ben Gilbert: Yep, fall of 1885, Atlanta,
[00:17:01] David Rezenthal: I think might have been the first major city in America
[00:17:06] David Rezenthal: that institutes prohibition and becomes a dry town.
[00:17:09] David Rezenthal: No alcohol.
[00:17:10] David Rezenthal: So Pemberton's now like, well, shoot,
[00:17:12] David Rezenthal: I've got this hit product.
[00:17:13] David Rezenthal: I need to scramble and come up with a soft version
[00:17:17] David Rezenthal: of a soft drink.
[00:17:18] David Rezenthal: Oh.
[00:17:18] David Rezenthal: And this is the origin of soft drinks.
[00:17:20] David Rezenthal: They're not hard as in alcoholic drinks.
[00:17:22] David Rezenthal: They're soft.
[00:17:23] David Rezenthal: Here you go.
[00:17:24] David Rezenthal: So he starts madly experimenting with all sorts of flavors
[00:17:26] David Rezenthal: and ingredients.
[00:17:27] David Rezenthal: And after six months or so in April of 1886,
[00:17:31] David Rezenthal: he nails a formula.
[00:17:34] Yes.
[00:17:34] And so the question is, how does he arrive at this formula?
[00:17:37] Ben Gilbert: The book I was reading, which is called Secret Formula.
[00:17:40] Ben Gilbert: It's a great book on the history of Coca-Cola
[00:17:41] Ben Gilbert: that had access to all the corporate archives,
[00:17:44] Ben Gilbert: really describes Pemberton in this phase
[00:17:47] Ben Gilbert: as finding his capitalist streak, as sort of realizing,
[00:17:51] Ben Gilbert: okay, take a step back.
[00:17:53] Ben Gilbert: Patent medicines are sold for $0.75 a dollar.
[00:17:58] Ben Gilbert: It serves a crowd of people when they're looking
[00:18:02] Ben Gilbert: to recover from some ailment,
[00:18:04] Ben Gilbert: or really at this point, probably serve an addiction.
[00:18:06] Ben Gilbert: We're now 20 years from the Civil War.
[00:18:08] David Rezenthal: So a new generation is coming up.
[00:18:10] David Rezenthal: Yes.
[00:18:11] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, that doesn't have army disease.
[00:18:13] Is there a product that I can make
[00:18:15] Ben Gilbert: that people can afford anytime they want
[00:18:18] Ben Gilbert: that's not a medicine that's just a refreshment
[00:18:21] Ben Gilbert: and has all these other great properties.
[00:18:23] Ben Gilbert: Using some of the ingredients that we've been using.
[00:18:26] Ben Gilbert: So he kind of comes up with this idea of a five cent again,
[00:18:30] Ben Gilbert: because the ingredients cost so little, these extracts.
[00:18:33] Ben Gilbert: It's a super high margin product.
[00:18:35] Ben Gilbert: A five cent thing that anybody can have
[00:18:37] Ben Gilbert: just to have a little pick me up, a little treat
[00:18:39] Ben Gilbert: when they're at the soda fountain.
[00:18:40] Ben Gilbert: Don't pick me up.
[00:18:41] Ben Gilbert: When they're sitting down in the social gathering space,
[00:18:45] Ben Gilbert: because drug stores at that time were sort of the Starbucks
[00:18:48] Ben Gilbert: of this time, it really was this gathering place
[00:18:50] Ben Gilbert: to go and spend time.
[00:18:52] And so he says, I'm going to serve this other market
[00:18:55] Ben Gilbert: of any time refreshment.
[00:18:57] Ben Gilbert: And so he's playing around with these ingredients.
[00:18:59] Ben Gilbert: And he's got the cola seed that's got this natural caffeine in it.
[00:19:02] Ben Gilbert: Fun story in the original Coca Cola for the first,
[00:19:05] Ben Gilbert: I don't know, a couple decades.
[00:19:07] Ben Gilbert: It actually had four times the amount of caffeine
[00:19:10] Ben Gilbert: that Coke does today.
[00:19:11] Ben Gilbert: So it was effectively an energy drink,
[00:19:13] Ben Gilbert: even leaving the cocaine aside.
[00:19:16] Ben Gilbert: However, the cola seed, it tastes really bitter.
[00:19:20] Ben Gilbert: It's absolutely horrible, which was not a big deal previously,
[00:19:23] Ben Gilbert: because he was mixing it with wine.
[00:19:25] Ben Gilbert: People were drinking it from medicinal purposes,
[00:19:27] Ben Gilbert: just kind of slugging it down.
[00:19:28] Ben Gilbert: But he's trying to create a refreshing beverage here.
[00:19:31] Ben Gilbert: And so I did not know that this was possible way back in 1886.
[00:19:36] Ben Gilbert: But what he does is he uses synthetic caffeine.
[00:19:39] Ben Gilbert: Merck, the pharmaceutical company,
[00:19:41] Ben Gilbert: had already been extracting pure caffeine from cola seeds.
[00:19:47] Ben Gilbert: So Pemberton just got a hold of Merck
[00:19:49] Ben Gilbert: and bought a bunch of the powder.
[00:19:51] Ben Gilbert: And so the first version of Coca Cola is a little tiny bit of the cola seed,
[00:19:56] Ben Gilbert: just kind of to say that it's in there,
[00:19:58] Ben Gilbert: he's going to call this thing Coca Cola.
[00:20:00] Ben Gilbert: But the caffeine actually comes from a synthetic extract.
[00:20:03] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, interesting.
[00:20:04] David Rezenthal: It's always been synthetic, huh?
[00:20:06] David Rezenthal: That's right.
[00:20:07] David Rezenthal: I didn't know that.
[00:20:08] David Rezenthal: That's amazing.
[00:20:09] Ben Gilbert: So it was a great excerpt from the book Secret Formula.
[00:20:12] Ben Gilbert: At last, he stood on the verge of inventing Coca Cola.
[00:20:16] Ben Gilbert: Down in the basement, Pemberton filled his 40 gallon kettle
[00:20:19] Ben Gilbert: with plain water, which he then heated to a boil over an open fire,
[00:20:23] Ben Gilbert: using a wooden paddle to stir the solution he melted in sugar and caffeine.
[00:20:27] Ben Gilbert: Right sugar because of the extreme bitterness of the cola nut.
[00:20:30] David Rezenthal: Yes.
[00:20:31] Ben Gilbert: And actually the Coca plant was also bitter.
[00:20:34] Ben Gilbert: So sugar was to offset it.
[00:20:35] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:37] Next, he added caramel for coloring,
[00:20:39] Ben Gilbert: giving the syrup its dark, distinctive, port wine color.
[00:20:43] Ben Gilbert: To balance the sweetness of the sugar and give the syrup its tang,
[00:20:46] Ben Gilbert: he added lime juice, citric acid, and phosphoric acid.
[00:20:50] Ben Gilbert: Then as the basic blend cooled, Pemberton turned to the question of flavor,
[00:20:54] Ben Gilbert: into the mix went vanilla extract,
[00:20:56] Ben Gilbert: elixir of orange, and several pungent oils,
[00:20:59] Ben Gilbert: refined from various fruits, herbs, and trees.
[00:21:02] Ben Gilbert: Lemon, nutmeg, spice brush, coriander, and neroli.
[00:21:05] Ben Gilbert: The last ingredient in perfumes distilled from a flower of the orange tree.
[00:21:10] Ben Gilbert: The most exotic was oil of cassia,
[00:21:13] Ben Gilbert: also known as Chinese cinnamon,
[00:21:15] Ben Gilbert: made from the bark of a tree found in the tropical regions of Asia.
[00:21:19] Ben Gilbert: And of course, Pemberton added this brew to the fluid extract of Coca leaves.
[00:21:24] Ben Gilbert: Exactly how much cocaine went into the inaugural batch of Doc Pemberton's
[00:21:28] Ben Gilbert: new soft drinks syrup is impossible to calculate more than a century later.
[00:21:31] Ben Gilbert: But with even a touch of the drug,
[00:21:33] Ben Gilbert: in combination with the sugar and caffeine,
[00:21:35] Ben Gilbert: four times the amount in today's coke made Pemberton's concoction
[00:21:39] Ben Gilbert: quite a stimulating beverage.
[00:21:41] Yes, yes indeed.
[00:21:43] David Rezenthal: As best as I was able to read from a few different sources,
[00:21:47] David Rezenthal: I think roughly once Coca Cola starts being produced in that first decade,
[00:21:52] David Rezenthal: call it four or five classes of Coca Cola would be about the equivalent of a line of cocaine today.
[00:21:59] Okay, so it would take a lot of Coca Cola.
[00:22:01] Ben Gilbert: If you're drinking that much of that formula,
[00:22:04] Ben Gilbert: you're having the equivalent of 16 Cokesworth of caffeine.
[00:22:09] Ben Gilbert: It's an absolute crap ton of caffeine and sugar.
[00:22:11] Ben Gilbert: By that description, the cocaine probably would affect you less than the sugar and caffeine in the mix.
[00:22:17] Ben Gilbert: That's a good point.
[00:22:19] David Rezenthal: Regardless, you're getting get hype when you drink this.
[00:22:22] David Rezenthal: And this amount of cocaine really was only a part of the formula for those early first few years.
[00:22:28] Yes, but it lends the first half of the name,
[00:22:32] David Rezenthal: which Pemberton's business partner at the time,
[00:22:35] David Rezenthal: like I named Frank Robinson, comes up with a simple descriptive, perfect name for this new brew, Coca Cola,
[00:22:44] David Rezenthal: which is funny because it neither contains much cola since the caffeine is actually an extract.
[00:22:51] Ben Gilbert: And it's just a tiny little drop from the cola seed.
[00:22:54] Ben Gilbert: And very soon they would strip out almost all the cocaine.
[00:22:57] Ben Gilbert: And so you have a product that for the next 140 years would be called Coca Cola
[00:23:01] Ben Gilbert: that contains really not very much Coca and really not very much Cola.
[00:23:05] Ben Gilbert: Yes, indeed.
[00:23:07] David Rezenthal: So they go about getting the new product installed and distributed in drugstore soda founds around Atlanta.
[00:23:15] David Rezenthal: But Ben, you were saying a minute ago about, oh, drugstores were this gathering place at the time.
[00:23:20] David Rezenthal: Remember I said about bottling technology.
[00:23:22] David Rezenthal: If you weren't selling alcohol, which had natural preservatives,
[00:23:26] David Rezenthal: the only way that you could buy and consume a drink that really wasn't like water or milk or something was fresh.
[00:23:34] David Rezenthal: And so that's how soda founds come to be installed in these drugstores.
[00:23:37] David Rezenthal: They're selling the patent medicines, many of which are liquids.
[00:23:41] David Rezenthal: And that's also how carbonated water comes to the drugstores because mineral water, carbonated water is thought to be a health tonic.
[00:23:48] David Rezenthal: And so it all mixes together and then over the years, these morph into social places.
[00:23:54] David Rezenthal: Thanks in large part to Coca Cola makes total sense.
[00:23:58] Ben Gilbert: And I'm pretty sure what actually happens is Pemberton lets his formula settle and it's kind of this thick syrup-y thing,
[00:24:05] Ben Gilbert: brings it down the street to the first drugstore and that drugst, that proprietor is the one who actually combines that syrup with the carbonated water
[00:24:13] Ben Gilbert: and makes the choice, which I think could have gone either way, is it a steel ore sparkling beverage to give it that champagne sparkle to create the Coca Cola that would endure from there.
[00:24:23] Ben Gilbert: Well, thank goodness they do use the carbonated water.
[00:24:26] David Rezenthal: Could you imagine Coke if it were still? That wouldn't be very good.
[00:24:30] David Rezenthal: No, it wouldn't be successful. I mean, there was probably hundreds of things like Coke that were still that did not succeed.
[00:24:36] Ben Gilbert: So pretty quickly, Coca Cola gets into a market with these drugstores and soda founds and people love it.
[00:24:43] David Rezenthal: This is great. It's a dual benefit product.
[00:24:46] David Rezenthal: It has all the medicinal benefits of cocaine and caffeine in the cola that they've been marketing.
[00:24:52] David Rezenthal: And it's actually really enjoyable to drink and it tastes great.
[00:24:55] David Rezenthal: So the next year in 1887, Frank Robinson, the business partner who also named the drink, he also introduces the script logo.
[00:25:04] David Rezenthal: Like he writes out the Coca Cola script logo that we still use to this day.
[00:25:08] David Rezenthal: This is unbelievable. I read that this guy was Pemberton's bookkeeper and yet he's the one who came up with the name Coca Cola and the Spenserian script, the logo Coca Cola, which has been unchanged other than just tightening it up a little bit since he created it in 1887.
[00:25:23] Ben Gilbert: Yes, it is true that he was his bookkeeper, but he was also his business partner. It was like, it's like I'm your bookkeeper type thing.
[00:25:32] David Rezenthal: So the two of them come up with a pretty ingenious advertising and distribution method because in the early days, they don't yet have a ton of capital to start spending on advertisements like all the other patent medicines out there.
[00:25:46] David Rezenthal: They decide that they are going to offer tickets to consumers, redeemable at their local Atlanta soda fountains for free glasses of coke.
[00:26:00] David Rezenthal: And they start mailing out these free coke tickets or coupons, you might say, to every address in the Atlanta city directory.
[00:26:11] David Rezenthal: And then they also give them to traveling door to door salesman to go hand out on the routes, not Coca Cola salesman, but salesman that are selling a variety of different products.
[00:26:21] David Rezenthal: And this is the very first manufacturer's coupon redeemable at a retailer.
[00:26:27] Ben Gilbert: Yes, there's an image on Wikipedia of one of these tickets from 1888, that is the oldest known coupon used in America.
[00:26:38] David Rezenthal: And it is actually beautiful. It kind of looks like a dollar bill. We'll put a photo of it in the email. It's incredible.
[00:26:45] David Rezenthal: This becomes absolutely huge for Coca Cola and integral to its success.
[00:26:54] David Rezenthal: Well, yeah, it's a high gross margin product where you can give out giant amounts where if you mail someone a little ticket that says you can come and redeem a free drink that tastes good.
[00:27:05] Ben Gilbert: And that's full of sugar, caffeine and cocaine. I'm pretty sure they're going to buy more from you. It's a high gross margin products. You have lots of dollars to play with.
[00:27:13] Ben Gilbert: And on top of all this, this is kind of a new product category, this notion of a soft drink that's not a patent medicine that's much cheaper than traditional patent medicines.
[00:27:23] Ben Gilbert: And so you do actually need to do some category creation marketing where you make people aware that this cool new thing exists.
[00:27:33] Ben Gilbert: All of that is true. And even more so, this couponing strategy aligns incentives for everybody in the value chain in a way that had never been done before.
[00:27:46] David Rezenthal: Consumers, they love it. They get free drinks of this great tasting beverage.
[00:27:51] David Rezenthal: Yep.
[00:27:52] David Rezenthal: Drug stores in soda fountains, they super love it because now they're getting more foot traffic. And then once consumers come back and start buying their second and third for, you know, for hundreds drinks is a highly profitable drink for them to sell.
[00:28:07] David Rezenthal: They have gross retail margins on this.
[00:28:10] David Rezenthal: And then three, the traveling salesman who, Pemberton and his associates are giving these tickets out to, well, they love it too. This is like, oh, wow, now a great new free benefit.
[00:28:22] David Rezenthal: I can offer my customers. Why wouldn't I want to do this? It's this incredible invention that completely incentivizes rapid extreme growth in distribution of the product.
[00:28:36] David Rezenthal: So to further illustrate how awesome this is for the soda fountains, Coke, when they were selling gallons of syrup to the soda fountains, they sold them for about a dollar and 30 cents per gallon.
[00:28:50] David Rezenthal: The soda fountains then sold drinks to customers at five cents a drink. They're 120 drinks per gallon. They're making six dollars and 40 cents a revenue for a product that costs them a buck 30 to buy.
[00:29:05] David Rezenthal: I'm not a retailer, but I'm pretty sure those are good margins.
[00:29:09] David Rezenthal: Pretty sweet deal. If you can get it then and pretty sweet deal to be McDonald's today, offering my large Coke with a meal.
[00:29:18] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, man. Pretty sweet deal indeed. Okay. So all of this happens within the first year, year and a half of Coca-Cola being on the market pretty quickly.
[00:29:32] David Rezenthal: Pemberton, who wasn't really doing much anyway after inventing the drink because we said Frank Robinson named it, made the logo is doing a lot of the distribution work.
[00:29:43] David Rezenthal: Pemberton becomes convinced that he's dying, which he generally was slowly over all these years. Yes. And he secretly decides that he is going to sell off the rights to the formula without telling Robinson.
[00:30:00] Ben Gilbert: Without really telling anybody this kicks off a whole mess of very questionably legitimate transactions that results by mid 1888 early 1889 in Frank Robinson discovering what's going on and seeking out a wealthy Atlanta businessman named Aisa Candler to come in and be his new partner to reunite all these various claims to ownership of
[00:30:29] David Rezenthal: the formula and the company that they can then grow and scale and manifest its destiny across America and the world.
[00:30:37] David Rezenthal: And Aisa Candler is really the person who creates the modern Coca-Cola company with Frank Robinson's help in 1892, which he incorporates as the definitive Coca-Cola company.
[00:30:53] David Rezenthal: But before we tell the story of the Coca-Cola company, now is a great time to thank our presenting partner, JP Morgan payments. Yes, who wants to wish all of you a happy holidays, happy holidays and to share some stats on how their infrastructure kicks off its holiday season.
[00:31:12] Ben Gilbert: So last year they processed over $53 billion during Thanksgiving week. That is insane scale. At one point on Black Friday last year they were processing over 6000 transactions per second, and that is actually 17% higher than the previous year.
[00:31:27] Ben Gilbert: Wow. Yes, that is insane scale.
[00:31:30] David Rezenthal: On our history of credit cards a few years ago, we told the story of how in the early 90s, customers behind you in line used to get mad if you pulled out a credit card because it was actually slower than cash.
[00:31:41] Ben Gilbert: It's hard to fathom today that payment processing was measured in seconds and in minutes, not in milliseconds like today.
[00:31:48] Ben Gilbert: Oh, yeah, I won't even do any holiday shopping in person anymore. It's just not worth the hassle. I do everything online.
[00:31:54] David Rezenthal: Well, that's where I was going. Our friends at JP Morgan told us that 50% of the top 10 online transaction days now occurred during the Black Friday to cyber Monday period.
[00:32:03] Ben Gilbert: But that means that the payment landscape has gotten enormously more complicated with all the different ways to pay.
[00:32:10] Ben Gilbert: This is awesome for consumers like you David, but it creates a ton of data for merchants that causes complexity, especially with holiday shopping.
[00:32:18] Ben Gilbert: Enter JP Morgan payments commerce solutions. They manage the complexity for you and they've built a customer insights platform to turn payment data into actionable insights.
[00:32:28] Ben Gilbert: You can make custom reports of things like revenue and different geographies each day, demographic shifts in your customers, benchmark against peers or even purchase patterns for repeat customers.
[00:32:38] Ben Gilbert: And this is huge for businesses during the holiday season because while I do my shopping online, JP Morgan actually found that the next generation of shoppers are going back to stores.
[00:32:47] David Rezenthal: Which is wild over 55% of Gen Z's holiday spend is through omnichannel experiences, far surpassing other age groups.
[00:32:55] David Rezenthal: So listeners, if you're looking to do more with your payments data with invaluable customer insights and meet your customers where they are, visit JP Morgan dot com slash acquired to learn how commerce solutions can grow your business.
[00:33:08] Ben Gilbert: All right. So David, this is the first professionally run version of the Coca Cola company.
[00:33:15] Ben Gilbert: Yes, but to give you a sense of just how much of a hit this product becomes how quickly, even in the couple years before the professionalization and the founding of the Coca Cola company in 1887.
[00:33:28] David Rezenthal: So the first year that coke the product is on the market, Pamberton and Robinson sells 600 gallons of Coca Cola syrup to soda.
[00:33:36] David Rezenthal: Which equates to about 75,000 glasses of coke served by 1889, two years later, that is quadrupled to over 2000 gallons.
[00:33:46] David Rezenthal: And by 1890, it's almost 10,000 gallons. So what's that three years into the business with no professional management.
[00:33:55] David Rezenthal: They grow the business 10x without even really trying.
[00:33:59] David Rezenthal: It's amazing. And in that next year 1891, when Asa Candler buys the last piece to fully own Coca Cola, he got an incredible deal.
[00:34:09] Ben Gilbert: Even with all that growth having already happened, he only paid $2,300 to buy it all. That is the base of the company that he builds.
[00:34:18] David Rezenthal: And that's just buying all the various rights and claims from the people that Pamberton sold it off to.
[00:34:24] David Rezenthal: No capital needs to be invested in this business ever unbelievable. It is a cash flow, but nanza since like day one. It's crazy.
[00:34:33] Ben Gilbert: So in 1892, the first official year of operation of the Coca Cola company, we have the books. We know just how profitable they were.
[00:34:42] David Rezenthal: They spent just over $20,000 on ingredients and production costs. And I think that includes all like operations and stuff.
[00:34:49] David Rezenthal: They only like three people working in the business here. They spend just over $10,000 on advertising.
[00:34:56] David Rezenthal: Okay. And with those costs, they sell 35,360 gallons of syrup at an average price of a buck 30 gallons.
[00:35:06] David Rezenthal: So that is $46,000 in revenue and $12,000 in profit. Now for reference, the average household income in 1892 was about $500.
[00:35:18] David Rezenthal: There are three people working in this business, including Candler, the owner.
[00:35:23] David Rezenthal: They made $12,000 in annual profit in the first year of the business. So they are crushing it.
[00:35:31] David Rezenthal: So that's each person at the company if they were paid equally is making 8x the average household income.
[00:35:36] Ben Gilbert: They are in a promising business. And that's just for the Coca Cola company.
[00:35:42] David Rezenthal: Remember the soda fountains are selling to consumers at $6.40 a gallon.
[00:35:49] David Rezenthal: So the actual gross revenue of Coca Cola in the marketplace in that first year is close to a quarter million dollars.
[00:35:57] David Rezenthal: That's a quarter million dollars on, what do you say a little over $20,000 of ingredients and manufacturing?
[00:36:04] Ben Gilbert: Yes. And then another $10,000 in advertising.
[00:36:08] David Rezenthal: So that's crazy. It's only a tenth of the ultimate sale price of the beverages is there in the costs of the ingredients, the manufacturing and the advertising when you fully load it.
[00:36:19] Ben Gilbert: Yes.
[00:36:20] Ben Gilbert: So there's a lot of margin to go around. So speaking of advertising costs in the next few years, they invest heavily into advertising.
[00:36:32] David Rezenthal: And of course, the Coca Cola company does still right up through to this day.
[00:36:36] David Rezenthal: The advertising they were doing on the one hand is very different than Coca Cola advertising today.
[00:36:41] David Rezenthal: And specifically it's different in that it's all purely intrinsic advertising.
[00:36:47] David Rezenthal: It's about the nature of the product itself. Remember, they're still sort of positioning Coca Cola as this dual use, refreshing beverage, non-alcoholic, so-so drink, but also patent medicine.
[00:36:59] David Rezenthal: So here's some of the early ad copy during this period. Coca Cola is the ideal brain tonic and sovereign remedy for headache and nervousness.
[00:37:08] David Rezenthal: It makes the sad, glad, and the weak strong.
[00:37:12] David Rezenthal: Yeah, I feel patent medicine.
[00:37:14] Ben Gilbert: It feels bad, but it's not a pause that is refreshing just yet.
[00:37:19] David Rezenthal: But what Robinson and Candler do do that is very much still on brand for Coke today is they are all about outdoor and point of sale, signage and presence.
[00:37:32] David Rezenthal: So they put the script Coca Cola logo everywhere across Atlanta. They make oil cloth signs, they paint murals on walls of buildings, they do billboards, they put it in street cars, they print posters for all the soda fountains to display.
[00:37:47] David Rezenthal: Then they're like, why stop at posters? Let's make calendars. Let's make cabinets. Let's make serving trees. Let's make glasses. Let's make clocks all with the big Coca Cola logo.
[00:37:57] David Rezenthal: They would go on to paint 20,000 murals on the signs of barns and walls across the countryside starting in 1894. Unbelievable.
[00:38:07] Ben Gilbert: Incredible.
[00:38:08] David Rezenthal: What you're talking about, David, is this great use of all these extra margin dollars. They would do all this for free for drugstores. And they would say, hey, don't you wish you had like a big bright, beautiful sign to bring customers into their store.
[00:38:23] Ben Gilbert: And Coca Cola would design pay for fabricate and deliver signs for drugstores that had the store name and big letters and Coca Cola's name just as big.
[00:38:33] Ben Gilbert: And they did this for thousands of drugstores across the South. And so you see all these great old pictures of these stores that effectively look like Coca Cola stores.
[00:38:42] Ben Gilbert: Oh, they're beautiful. Yeah. It almost looks like they're franchising Coca Cola rather than Coca Cola just being a thing that sold at the drugstores.
[00:38:49] Ben Gilbert: It's so beautiful because like you said, it seems like they're franchising Coca Cola with no capital investment. And the drugstores freaking love it because they're making 80% retail margins on this Coca Cola.
[00:39:02] David Rezenthal: Of course they wanted to be their number one product. They want a big advertisement says we have Coke. Yes. So by 1898 Coca Cola is distributing over one million branded promotional items per year.
[00:39:17] David Rezenthal: This is before the year 1900. Yeah.
[00:39:20] David Rezenthal: That's they also start expanding geographically because we talked about syrup earlier. All the Coca Cola company is doing here is selling this concentrated syrup.
[00:39:33] David Rezenthal: It's the drugstore soda founds that are then mixing it with carbonated water and making it a drink. The syrup is small, compact, it's shelf stable, it's easy to transport.
[00:39:45] David Rezenthal: Combined with the couponing strategy, they've got this killer national growth strategy. So by 1895 Coca Cola is being sold in at least one soda found in every single state and territory in the United States at this time wild.
[00:40:04] David Rezenthal: Well, yeah. And if you look at old pictures of this time, they had landed on what you were talking about the intrinsic advertising slogan that most people will know delicious and refreshing that you see on all the old Coca Cola memorabilia.
[00:40:17] Ben Gilbert: That's coming into view. They're not yet talking about the lifestyle you could have if you associate with coke. They're talking about quality and they're also talking about price. They're advertising as many places as they can. Hey, this is five cents.
[00:40:30] Ben Gilbert: They also start for the first time working with celebrities and athletes in some of these advertisements that they're doing. And of course, as you would expect in 1895, they trademark the Coca Cola script for the first time they are granted that unbelievably valuable trademark.
[00:40:47] Ben Gilbert: Yes, the delicious and refreshing slogan. That actually evolves during these years and it's Frank Robinson who starts to lean more towards delicious and refreshing and the social benefit.
[00:40:59] David Rezenthal: And away from the patent medicine, brain tonic slogans, there's actually a great quote on this from him in for God country and Coca Cola. He said, we found that we were advertising to the few people who needed a brain tonic when we ought to advertise to the masses.
[00:41:18] David Rezenthal: And so he starts dropping all this. Oh, sovereign remedy for headaches and nervousness stuff and then starts really emphasizing the drink Coca Cola delicious refreshing.
[00:41:28] David Rezenthal: This is really important because he's hitting on like, hey, Coca Cola is for everyone. It's not only for people who have something wrong with them that they need a medicine to fix. It's not a niche. It's not a demographic. It's for everybody.
[00:41:41] David Rezenthal: Yep.
[00:41:42] And to just instinctually he understood, hey, we don't want to associate our product with negative things with problems.
[00:41:50] David Rezenthal: We want to associate our product only with positive things, delicious, refreshing, friendship, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:41:59] David Rezenthal: Yep, but just so funny at this point, all the cocaine is not gone yet. We still have.
[00:42:05] Ben Gilbert: It's being marketed as this unabated good. Well, at the same time, the company's like, we should probably do our best to start moving away from cocaine because it doesn't actually seem to be the value proposition that people are here for.
[00:42:16] Ben Gilbert: Yes. And the anti cocaine sentiment is coming.
[00:42:19] Ben Gilbert: Yep. Before they fix the cocaine issue though, Candler in 1899 makes what is maybe simultaneously the best and the worst business deal in history.
[00:42:32] David Rezenthal: He gives away the right to bottle and sell Coca Cola for free.
[00:42:40] David Rezenthal: Yes, definitely one of the dumbest deals ever. If you just look at it as it was in that moment, but would be sort of Coca Cola's second great business model innovation after couponing.
[00:42:52] Ben Gilbert: So in 1889, two guys from Chattanooga, Tennessee, named Benjamin Thomas and Joseph Whitehead come to Candler with a proposal.
[00:43:03] David Rezenthal: They want to bottle Coca Cola. They're convinced that bottling technology has matured enough at this point that they can now bottle fully mixed Coca Cola beverages.
[00:43:17] David Rezenthal: And not only will they not go bad, they'll keep the carbonated fizz. It will still be delicious when opened and consumed at a later date.
[00:43:26] David Rezenthal: And Candler's like very anti bottling, right? Yes, he is extremely skeptical.
[00:43:31] David Rezenthal: He's like, yeah, we've tried this before. I really don't think the technology is there. I'm not sure about this. Thomas and Whitehead though, they're very persistent. They say, well, totally get that. Understand that.
[00:43:44] David Rezenthal: What if we do it at no risk to you? You let us buy Coca Cola syrup from you, same as all the soda fountains are doing.
[00:43:54] David Rezenthal: We will bottle it and sell it at our own expense. And if the product isn't up to your standards, you can just pull our license and we'll stop selling it.
[00:44:04] David Rezenthal: Candler thinks it over and he's like, that's pretty good deal. I've got nothing to lose here. Why not? I'll let you two young bucks have a go at this.
[00:44:12] David Rezenthal: So in July of 1899, the three of them sign a contract that includes the following terms for a token contract price of $1, which Candler never collects.
[00:44:25] David Rezenthal: The Coca Cola company will sell syrup to Thomas and Whitehead at a volume discount price of $1 per gallon.
[00:44:34] David Rezenthal: So even less than they are selling to the individual soda fountains out there because it's going to be a higher volume business.
[00:44:41] David Rezenthal: Thomas and Whitehead will have the exclusive assignable right to market and sell bottled Coca Cola for $0.05 per bottle, same prices at the soda fountains across practically the entire United States.
[00:44:58] David Rezenthal: But this five cents per bottle operating a bottle or is a tougher business than operating the soda fountain in this respect because there is one meaningful additional cost the bottle itself. Yeah, the bottle.
[00:45:09] David Rezenthal: You can see why Candler was reluctant to get into this business. Thomas and Whitehead must use only Coca Cola syrup. They can never use any substitutes or competitors as the syrup for the products that they are selling.
[00:45:22] David Rezenthal: They cannot sell to soda fountains. That channel will remain directly sold by the Coca Cola company.
[00:45:29] David Rezenthal: And if they fail to supply enough product to meet the demand for bottled Coke in the territories that they have rights over, the contract will be forfeit.
[00:45:40] David Rezenthal: The Coca Cola company will provide all advertising needs for the product and maintain all control over advertising.
[00:45:51] David Rezenthal: And that's it. There is no term length on the contract.
[00:45:55] David Rezenthal: And gosh, there's got to be something in there about how that $1 per gallon could change over time, right?
[00:46:03] Ben Gilbert: Nope. No, there is not. So the Coca Cola company, as long as this bottler continues to satisfy the demand and doesn't violate any of the other terms, is obligated to keep selling syrup at $1 per gallon.
[00:46:20] Ben Gilbert: Yes, to the bottler. Yes.
[00:46:22] Ben Gilbert: And the bottlers are obligated to keep selling bottles to the public at $0.5 retail cost. Fascinating.
[00:46:29] Ben Gilbert: So let it be written.
[00:46:31] Ben Gilbert: Obviously there are so many things wrong with this.
[00:46:34] David Rezenthal: But also so many things right with this.
[00:46:40] David Rezenthal: This lets the Coca Cola company enter and scale the bottle business completely capital and investment free.
[00:46:50] David Rezenthal: They don't have to do anything besides advertising, which they are already doing for their growing national business.
[00:46:57] In fact, they're not doing any different advertising. They're just amortizing the cost of the same advertising against one more touch point that they could have with the customer.
[00:47:05] Ben Gilbert: They're still paying the same barns. They're still putting up the same signs.
[00:47:09] Ben Gilbert: Yep. So Thomas and Whitehead go back up to chat, Nuka.
[00:47:13] David Rezenthal: They set up the Coca Cola bottling company and they start selling bottled coke for the first time to groceries, stands and saloons as they put it.
[00:47:25] David Rezenthal: And lastly, all three of those are pretty big markets for Coca Cola today, especially the groceries and stands,
[00:47:34] David Rezenthal: gas stations, convenience stores, etc.
[00:47:37] David Rezenthal: And at this point in history in 1900, the Coca Cola company is still just 20 employees.
[00:47:43] Ben Gilbert: So they're about to get ridiculous leverage on just a handful of people that work at the parent company.
[00:47:49] Ben Gilbert: And that includes making the syrup. It's a small head office.
[00:47:53] Ben Gilbert: Hi margin product, baby. Yep. So pretty quickly two things happen with young Thomas and Whitehead here. One, they didn't actually know each other very well before going into business together.
[00:48:03] David Rezenthal: They end up getting into a fight and splitting into two separate companies.
[00:48:07] David Rezenthal: Remember, the contract is assignable. They can do whatever they want with it. So they split up the territory across America.
[00:48:14] David Rezenthal: And they say, great, we're going to assign the rights we have in this contract with the Coca Cola company to our two separate companies.
[00:48:20] David Rezenthal: And then they both independently decide, you know, man, actually owning and operating these bottling operations and dealing with the capital investment of both setting up the production lines and then buying the bottles and recycling them and returning them and cleaning them, etc.
[00:48:37] David Rezenthal: It's a kind of low margin, very upfront capital intensive thing to bottle Coca Cola and operationally very intensive to of course, we've realized we can just assign the rights that we have here.
[00:48:49] David Rezenthal: Well, why don't we keep assigning the rights? They start subcontracting out little subterritories to other entrepreneurs and small bottling operations across the country.
[00:49:01] David Rezenthal: And so basically overnight first dozens and then hundreds of local Coca Cola bottling operations pop up in these entrepreneurial endeavors in basically every town and countryside across America.
[00:49:17] David Rezenthal: So that have no contractual relationship with the Coca Cola company. They have a relationship with this quote unquote parent bottler either Thomas or whitehead. Yes.
[00:49:28] David Rezenthal: So Thomas and whiteheads companies come to be known as the parent bottlers and then all the guys doing the actual work come to be known as the actual bottlers or the first line bottlers.
[00:49:41] David Rezenthal: And then ultimately rent seeker I mean Thomas and whitehead just have like a little toll booth setup in between the Coca Cola company that owns the intellectual property and makes the syrup and markets it and the bottlers who are actually doing the work and they're just clipping little coupons as the money flies by on the way over to the bottles and the Coca Cola company.
[00:50:01] Ben Gilbert: But hey, Candler and Robinson work going to do this so like more power to him. Right. That is the argument here is that there is economic value from Thomas and whitehead and actually spurring bottling to happen at all. Yes. And they need to go find the local bottlers and set up these entrepreneurs and teach them how to do it. Eventually they're doing nothing. But in the early days they're not doing nothing.
[00:50:22] David Rezenthal: That's true. Within 10 years they managed to find 400 proprietors of bottling operations get them to stand it up. And by 1925 there was 1200. So it is a busy busy 25 years finding all these child bottles.
[00:50:39] Ben Gilbert: So basically this creates a second wave of blitz scaling if you will for the Coca Cola company across America because they'd already nationally expanded to soda fountains.
[00:50:51] David Rezenthal: But soda fountains are only in towns large enough to have a soda fountain. What about all the rural areas of the countryside not to mention just the simple market expansion of letting people drink at home or wherever restaurants anywhere else. Huge deal.
[00:51:06] Ben Gilbert: The net of this is that within a few years basically every single man, woman and child in the United States becomes intimately aware of and familiar with Coca Cola.
[00:51:19] David Rezenthal: And the company doesn't have to lift a single finger to do it.
[00:51:23] David Rezenthal: This reminds me a lot of our visa episode where we were talking about the difference between if you're visa and you're scaling as a network of networks versus if you're mx as a closed loop system and we were talking about how visa achieved tremendous scale relative to their head office size their employee head count.
[00:51:42] Ben Gilbert: And they did it in a very short period of time. Coca Cola sort of in the same thing here where they can scale so fast because of the bottles where they're not actually having to do all this work themselves.
[00:51:53] Ben Gilbert: I don't think Coca Cola is the ubiquitous international product that it is today where they just created and then won the market without this bottle or scale thing.
[00:52:05] Ben Gilbert: No, absolutely not. If they had taken the mx approach and Candler had decided, you know, we're going to enter the bottling business ourselves and we're going to go market by market and invest the capital in the production lines and the bottles.
[00:52:21] David Rezenthal: Absolutely no way would they have reached the critical scale that they did in the country and then internationally to they use the same model to go around the world.
[00:52:31] David Rezenthal: Yep. And Coca Cola would start referring to this as the Coca Cola system. I don't think we've ever studied a business before that has a system like this where you can look at the Coca Cola company, which is ostensibly what we're doing on this episode.
[00:52:44] Ben Gilbert: But actually to understand the scale and impact and reach of the product, you sort of have to look at the system holistically the sum of the Coca Cola company and all the bottleers.
[00:52:55] Ben Gilbert: The crazy thing is this is still the system today. Coca Cola still doesn't bottle. I mean, we can talk about the exceptions to that. But in large part, and their desired end state is there's all these bottles around the world that they just sell syrup to.
[00:53:10] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, it's kind of like Microsoft and Intel in the PC era except even more closely tied. It'd be like if Microsoft had contracts with Intel where they got to stipulate what the processes we're going to look like and what the machines were going to look like.
[00:53:24] David Rezenthal: It's funny. The thing that it may be think of as it's kind of like our Rolex episode where Rolex. You don't want to be in the authorized dealer business. It's operationally expensive. The trainings hard, but you do want the control over the retail experience and Rolex managed to have their cake and eat it to like we talk about that on that episode where they can kind of say, hey, it's a privilege to be able to sell our watches. And so you're going to make your store conform to our exact standard. Coca Cola does the exact same thing with the bottles and they say, hey, you have a license to sell.
[00:53:53] Ben Gilbert: Hey, you have a license to print money. It's not as much money as we're going to print, but you can print some money and you know it's going to be a good business more than some money. The local Coca Cola bottleers usually become the wealthiest family and any given town across America.
[00:54:07] David Rezenthal: Very true. But just to make sure we're super clear. Coca Cola versus their bottles. The Coca Cola company has higher gross margins, much better returns on invested capital requires less invested capital.
[00:54:19] Ben Gilbert: They get to focus on just making syrup and marketing. They don't have to do any of the undifferentiated stuff. You'd much rather be Coca Cola than the bottles, but it's a good business to be the bottle or two.
[00:54:28] Ben Gilbert: Especially if you're a small town entrepreneur and you know turn of the century America like hell, yeah.
[00:54:34] David Rezenthal: And if the Coca Cola company is going to dictate terms to me and tell me exactly how red my truck needs to be and that it must say Coca Cola in this particular way and the bottles must come off exactly like this. That is fine. I will agree to all of this because I know.
[00:54:48] David Rezenthal: I'm going to make money. Yes.
[00:54:52] David Rezenthal: So once things turbocharged with the bottleers and scaling across America, a lot of imitators and copycats start popping up trying to make another cola drink, use the same model, go to other bottleers or maybe other aspiring entrepreneurs who didn't get the Coca Cola franchise might want to open a competitive franchise in their local town, etc.
[00:55:16] David Rezenthal: By the mid 1900s, there are hundreds of Coca Cola competitors out there. There's Africa, Char Cola, Carbocola, Coca and Cola, Fig Cola, Coca Cola, King Cola, Standard Cola, on and on and on and on.
[00:55:32] David Rezenthal: And by the way, a Cola, like what I'm holding up right now, David, this brown flavored fizzy drink wasn't a thing before Coca Cola. Coca Cola was insistent that we aren't the Coca variant of Cola. Coca Cola is one thing that means our formula, our secret formula with this mystery merchandise seven X, which is the real crux of the formula.
[00:55:54] Ben Gilbert: And there's no other things that can be colas because we created the concept of Coca Cola and we are one.
[00:56:01] Ben Gilbert: So in 1905, Congress passes the Federal Trade Market in the United States and the federalized trademark protection in the country previously it was just done state by state, which I think is probably how Coca Cola trademark the script logo earlier than that might have just been in Georgia.
[00:56:21] David Rezenthal: Of course, the Coca Cola company is one of the first registrants for their trademark and they start using this new law to sue the crap out of all the competitors out there.
[00:56:33] David Rezenthal: And really winning on these grounds that like Cola isn't a category, you can't be a something Cola. It's not a general term we own Coca Cola as a lock up.
[00:56:42] Ben Gilbert: Yes, and they succeed. So over the next like 15, 20 years by the mid 20s, it's estimated that Coca Cola sues and shuts down over 7,000 copycat Cola brands.
[00:56:56] David Rezenthal: In a very, very busy legal department. And this becomes the next critically important pillar of building Coke. Only Coke is the real thing.
[00:57:06] David Rezenthal: Coke is real. Everything else is an imitator that is a copycat. It should not exist.
[00:57:14] David Rezenthal: Yep. And there is a famous 1920 case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. There was a company called the Coke company, K-O-K-E, that was insisting.
[00:57:25] Ben Gilbert: Actually, it's worth a side here to say, at this point in time, Coca Cola did not embrace the nickname Coke. One because of the affiliation with the drug. And we should say by 1905, cocaine is pretty much entirely gone. There's no more Coke in Coca Cola.
[00:57:41] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, it's actually an amazing story. In 1903, they contract with a company called the Schaeffer Alkaloid Works of Maywood, New Jersey that has developed a process to decocheneize coca leaves.
[00:57:55] David Rezenthal: And this company, which still exists today and is still the sole supplier of decocheneized coca leaves Coca Cola today, is granted a federal exemption by the US government from the DEA.
[00:58:08] David Rezenthal: They're the only commercial entity in the United States that is allowed to import coca leaves.
[00:58:14] David Rezenthal: Because they imported with cocaine and it's still right? Yes. And then they have a process to take the cocaine out of the coca leaves. They sell the decocheneized coca leaves to Coca Cola.
[00:58:23] David Rezenthal: And I'm pretty sure the way that this ended up happening was the Hoover administration said if federal agents are present on site and can supervise the destruction of the cocaine byproduct, then you can do this on American soil.
[00:58:36] Ben Gilbert: And import the coca leaves do this create a giant pile of cocaine and then we will watch you destroy it. And that's still how they produce Coca Cola.
[00:58:44] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, which is also another piece of protecting Coca Cola. Nobody else has access to coca leaves. You want that taste? You ain't going to get it.
[00:58:53] David Rezenthal: Because the coca leaves as much as the cocaine has gone, the coca leaf is still an important part of the formula. So anyway, there's this 1920 case where Coke, K, K, E is sort of tongue in cheek saying, what do you mean?
[00:59:05] Ben Gilbert: You guys aren't saying your Coke. So certainly we can be coke. And the other point they were making is Coca Cola. You guys can't actually even use your trademark. It's unprotectable.
[00:59:16] Ben Gilbert: Since there's not really much coca in it and all the cocaine's been removed. So it's actually misleading false advertising. You're misleading the public by saying that you are coca or cola. You're not.
[00:59:28] Ben Gilbert: As Supreme Court says, we are ruling in favor of Coca Cola. It is a phrase that has transcended being a descriptive name and it is now just a brand and the official ruling, which is the stuff of legend contains this phrase.
[00:59:43] Ben Gilbert: Coca Cola means a single thing coming from a single source and well known to the community. And that is the new description of what the Coca Cola brand is and why it is a trade marketable thing that has nothing to do with Coca or Cola.
[00:59:58] Ben Gilbert: So this is the first biggest front of the war that Coca Cola wages on the Amatators through the courts.
[01:00:08] David Rezenthal: It goes to the Supreme Court to the Supreme Court amazing. The second most important front of the battle against the Amatators is the bottle. So Coca Cola realizes, hey, we're not actually in the bottling business ourselves.
[01:00:25] David Rezenthal: But we have full control over it. If we really want to drive home to consumers that Coca Cola is the real thing and have it be immediately identifiable what the real thing is, we actually can force our bottles to develop and invest in a proprietary bottle that will become instantly visually known to all consumers.
[01:00:54] David Rezenthal: In America and then around the world. And this results in 1916 in the famous proprietary bottle that you all know today that Ben you are drinking out of right now.
[01:01:06] David Rezenthal: The contour bottle as it is officially called or as it is then known in the vernacular the May West bottle. Yes, because its proportions look like the famous actress may west.
[01:01:19] David Rezenthal: Yes, and the story of how the contour bottle came to be is awesome. But first we want to tell you about a friend of the show that we are very excited about work OS.
[01:01:31] Ben Gilbert: And if we've learned anything from Coca Cola, it is that if you have a great marketing message, you should just keep reinforcing it. So I called the founder of work OS and said, what are we going with? We're happy to brainstorm. Let's figure out the right message and his comment back to me was, we've got the right message.
[01:01:48] Ben Gilbert: Yes, we've gotten some insane feedback on work OS from our last episode. Somebody even called the read that we did that you really mastermind had been the best podcast ad they've ever heard. So we're rolling with it again.
[01:02:01] David Rezenthal: If you're building software that's used in enterprises, you've probably felt the pain of integrating things like SSO, skim permissions audit logs and other features required by big customers.
[01:02:12] David Rezenthal: Work OS turns those potential deal blockers into simple drop in APIs, letting you scale revenue earlier in the life of your company or simplify your internal code base if you're already a larger company.
[01:02:22] Ben Gilbert: Yep, the founder, Michael Greenwich pointed out to us that it's not just about scaling revenue. It's about landing a customer so your competitors don't. It's like Coca Cola here. Enterprise readiness has become table stakes for companies no matter what their stage.
[01:02:36] David Rezenthal: And work OS is the go to choice for the best software companies to shortcut this process and get back to focusing on what makes their beer tastes better building the product itself.
[01:02:45] David Rezenthal: So interestingly, this has accelerated in the AI era. There are hundreds of AI companies that rely on work OS as their off solution, including open AI, anthropic cursor, perplexity, Sierra, replete, versel, the list goes on.
[01:03:01] Ben Gilbert: So why have all of them jumped on the work OS train?
[01:03:04] Ben Gilbert: What we learn from Michael is it's basically two things. One, AI companies are just scaling so much faster that they need things like authorization authentication and SSO to quickly become enterprise ready early on.
[01:03:17] David Rezenthal: And to unlike the old world of bring your own SaaS product for your little team, these AI products reach really deep into your customer systems and data to be the most effective.
[01:03:26] David Rezenthal: So IT departments are scrutinizing more than ever to make sure new products are compliant before they can adopt them.
[01:03:32] David Rezenthal: So if you're ready to get started with just a few lines of code for Sammels, skim, RBAC, SSO, authorization authentication and everything else to please IT admins and their checklists.
[01:03:43] Ben Gilbert: Check out work OS that's work OS dot com or click the link in the show notes and just tell them that Ben and David sent you.
[01:03:51] Ben Gilbert: Okay, David.
[01:03:53] Ben Gilbert: So the bottle the me West bottle.
[01:03:57] So in 1912, the Coca-Cola bottling company sent a note to all of its members that Coca-Cola company has this great distinctive logo.
[01:04:06] Ben Gilbert: It's highly protected in the courts.
[01:04:08] Ben Gilbert: We've got the trademark on it, but we don't have a way to protect our business as the bottleers.
[01:04:15] Ben Gilbert: So the proposal is that the members all join together to create a distinctive package for the products.
[01:04:22] Ben Gilbert: And so in April of 1915, trustees of Coca-Cola bottling association vote to develop such a distinctive bottle.
[01:04:30] Ben Gilbert: Yes, and this is great at the convention of the bottles where I think they approve this.
[01:04:36] David Rezenthal: The Coca-Cola companies head of legal again, Howard Hirsch, who is doing all these lawsuits of the Amitators across the country.
[01:04:43] David Rezenthal: He comes with the mission of trying to convince these bottleers that spending this great capital expenditure is going to be in their interest.
[01:04:51] David Rezenthal: And this is what he says to them.
[01:04:53] David Rezenthal: We are not building Coca-Cola alone for today.
[01:04:56] David Rezenthal: We are building Coca-Cola forever.
[01:04:59] David Rezenthal: And it is our hope that Coca-Cola will remain the national drink to the end of time.
[01:05:04] David Rezenthal: The heads of your companies are doing everything in their power, a considerable expense to bring about a bottle that we can adopt and call our own child.
[01:05:14] David Rezenthal: And when that bottle is adopted, I ask each and every member of this convention to not consider the immediate expense that would be involved with changing your bottle.
[01:05:23] David Rezenthal: But to remember this, that it bringing about that bottle, the parent companies are bringing about an establishment of your own rights.
[01:05:33] David Rezenthal: It is exactly what you are saying, Ben.
[01:05:35] David Rezenthal: Wow! Isn't that amazing? What an orador!
[01:05:38] David Rezenthal: Help us help you.
[01:05:41] Ben Gilbert: Wow.
[01:05:42] So they create this design brief and they send it around to 10 different glass companies around the country that says,
[01:05:49] Ben Gilbert: we want to develop a bottle so distinct that you would recognize it by feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground.
[01:05:58] Ben Gilbert: So simple. It's like what do you really want the product to be?
[01:06:03] Ben Gilbert: And so the root glass company of Terry Hote, Indiana, designs the bottle that goes on to win the contest.
[01:06:10] Ben Gilbert: You all know what it looks like, the contour bottle.
[01:06:13] Ben Gilbert: So it's got this sort of wide top and then sort of a, as one of the books put it, a snatched waste, which is why they call it the May West bottle.
[01:06:23] Ben Gilbert: It's this Georgia green color.
[01:06:26] Ben Gilbert: That's right.
[01:06:27] David Rezenthal: But hilariously, the first version of it was actually much more round.
[01:06:31] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, it was almost like a cartoon version of the bottle today.
[01:06:34] David Rezenthal: Yes.
[01:06:35] David Rezenthal: And you might wonder why this sort of like striated, striped, super round pod.
[01:06:41] Ben Gilbert: Something got lost in translation and the bottle was designed to look like the cocoa plant.
[01:06:50] Ben Gilbert: The cocoa pod that you smash open to get out cocoa beans.
[01:06:54] Ben Gilbert: This is a whole different thing called the cocoa plant, not the cocoa plant, COCA versus COCOA.
[01:07:01] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, I read about this too.
[01:07:03] David Rezenthal: But ultimately, it satisfied the design brief.
[01:07:06] Ben Gilbert: You definitely recognize it.
[01:07:08] Ben Gilbert: It's super distinct.
[01:07:09] Ben Gilbert: It's kind of beautiful with the sort of rounded.
[01:07:11] Ben Gilbert: We'll put it in the email all based on a misinterpretation of what the plant actually is, but very distinctive.
[01:07:18] Ben Gilbert: Ultimately, in 1915, the patent for the contour bottle gets granted.
[01:07:23] Ben Gilbert: Actually, not referencing cocoa cola at all, because they wanted the whole thing to be a surprise when it hits the market.
[01:07:30] Ben Gilbert: They would then, this is some classic cocoa cola, layering, get additional patents for iterations on the design that effectively renewed the patent all the way from 1915 until the final one expired in 1951.
[01:07:44] Ben Gilbert: The company then went to the patent office and made the case that the bottle shape was so distinctive and so well known in 1951 that it should be granted trademark status, which they got.
[01:07:56] Ben Gilbert: It is highly unusual for packaging to be granted a trademark and their rationale was look in 1949.
[01:08:03] Ben Gilbert: We conducted a study that showed that less than 1% of Americans could not identify the bottle of coke by shape alone.
[01:08:12] Ben Gilbert: It's an integral part of the product.
[01:08:14] David Rezenthal: Yes, there you go.
[01:08:15] David Rezenthal: Talk about a successful accomplishment of that creative brief that all those years later, 99% of America could look at it and say that's a coke bottle.
[01:08:25] Ben Gilbert: Amazing.
[01:08:26] So by the next year, when you're after everybody in the extended cocoa cola family system is prospering and nobody more so than the cocoa cola company at the top.
[01:08:41] David Rezenthal: Yes, and they had gotten a variety of monkeys off their back at this point.
[01:08:45] Ben Gilbert: The cocaine has gone. They've really started defending the trademark. They've got this bottle thing.
[01:08:50] Ben Gilbert: They had another issue where there was a federal regulator who thought caffeine was evil.
[01:08:55] Ben Gilbert: So they appeased him by cutting the caffeine content down by two thirds.
[01:08:59] Ben Gilbert: Yep.
[01:09:00] Ben Gilbert: And by this point in time, the Coca-Cola brand and what it stands for in the beverage delicious refreshing.
[01:09:07] David Rezenthal: It's such an integral part of America that taking out the cocaine, cutting the caffeine by two thirds or by three quarters doesn't really impact things.
[01:09:17] David Rezenthal: The country is still hooked on Coca-Cola.
[01:09:19] David Rezenthal: In fact, it probably helps.
[01:09:20] David Rezenthal: It probably helps. Yes.
[01:09:21] Ben Gilbert: Makes it more of a wholesome beverage.
[01:09:23] David Rezenthal: It makes it so you consume a lot more Coca-Cola.
[01:09:26] Ben Gilbert: Okay.
[01:09:27] Ben Gilbert: So 1916 everybody's doing great.
[01:09:30] David Rezenthal: Nobody's doing better than the Coca-Cola company.
[01:09:32] David Rezenthal: Asa Canler is a big man about town in Atlanta, probably the most important person in town.
[01:09:40] David Rezenthal: So much so that a group of other Atlanta citizens convinced him to run for mayor, which he does.
[01:09:48] David Rezenthal: And he wins and becomes the mayor of Atlanta in 1916.
[01:09:53] David Rezenthal: And so he retires from Coca-Cola and gives his coke shares to all of his children.
[01:09:59] David Rezenthal: And then a couple of years later in 1919, a local banker named Ernest Woodruff puts together an investor syndicate and basically stages a takeover of the company and buys out the family members for $25 million.
[01:10:18] David Rezenthal: This also effectively serves as the IPO of the company because it's a syndicate of investors and shares start trading hands and the company becomes publicly traded.
[01:10:28] David Rezenthal: And certainly they didn't need to raise capital by going public.
[01:10:33] David Rezenthal: Right. And it was a complicated little period because some of the kids did want to have this happen.
[01:10:37] Ben Gilbert: Other ones didn't want to have it happen.
[01:10:39] Ben Gilbert: They're sort of family infighting.
[01:10:41] Ben Gilbert: But ultimately, after a few years, Ernest Woodruff and his syndicate of investors do own and control the company.
[01:10:49] Ben Gilbert: In fact, there was some clever financial engineering that had to happen to buy this company, like $25 million in 1919 is a huge amount of money.
[01:11:00] Ben Gilbert: And so as a result, this is actually the first time the secret formula for Coca-Cola gets written down.
[01:11:07] Ben Gilbert: It had been sort of this cool secret before, but as collateral for the loan that Woodruff took out to complete this transaction, they wrote down the formula and placed it in a vault at the guarantee bank of New York.
[01:11:24] Because that's where they got the capital from.
[01:11:26] Ben Gilbert: And so they get to hold the formula as collateral.
[01:11:28] Ben Gilbert: Prior to this, it had always been verbal.
[01:11:32] Ben Gilbert: The system, Asa Candler set up was insane.
[01:11:35] Ben Gilbert: So this is from the book secret formula about Asa and his son Howard Candler.
[01:11:40] Ben Gilbert: Asa made his son memorize the contents of the various containers that were stored carefully in a locked room with their labels peeled or scratched off.
[01:11:50] Ben Gilbert: For days with his father standing watch over his shoulder, Howard practiced making the ultra secret flavoring compound, merchandise number seven X,
[01:11:59] Ben Gilbert: learning to recognize the pungent fruit and vegetable oils by sight, smell, and remembering each was put on the shelf when it came in from the supplier until he knew by heart the proper amounts and the exact order in which to mix them.
[01:12:14] Ben Gilbert: This is crazy.
[01:12:16] Ben Gilbert: The way in which this giant mass produced thing is created.
[01:12:21] Ben Gilbert: It's like only stored. I believe in two people's head at any given time.
[01:12:26] Ben Gilbert: And they deliberately kept this a trade secret and didn't patent it because if you patent something, eventually it does become the property of the public and anyone can use it to further innovate.
[01:12:37] Ben Gilbert: But Coca-Cola has kept this secret all these years.
[01:12:40] Ben Gilbert: Yeah. And it's still part of the law of the company to this day that oh, there's two people that know the formula.
[01:12:45] David Rezenthal: They can't travel together. Well, the formula is out there like you can find it on the internet.
[01:12:52] David Rezenthal: Really? The Coca-Cola company would maintain that is absolutely not true.
[01:12:55] Ben Gilbert: Well, the original formula is out of its in the appendix of For God country in Coca-Cola, which I think they also maintain is not the right formula.
[01:13:03] Ben Gilbert: I mean, I would swear up and down to, but yes, this is like the best example ever, though, of someone electing to use a trade secret instead of a patent.
[01:13:11] Ben Gilbert: And then creating all this lore and secrecy and myth around it. But for six years, as collateral, the first written version of the formula was in the guarantee bank of New York vault.
[01:13:24] David Rezenthal: So Ernest, when he takes over, he's a banker. He's an investor. This is like a crown jewel investment that he could get his hands on in Atlanta.
[01:13:35] David Rezenthal: He doesn't really have any interest in running it. So the company plots along for a couple of years with the existing management team.
[01:13:43] David Rezenthal: Ernest really doesn't like this perpetual contract thing with the parent bottle. He's like, where are you two guys do it?
[01:13:49] David Rezenthal: As far as I can tell, you're not doing anything. He tries to get rid of that. This leads to all sorts of lawsuits.
[01:13:56] David Rezenthal: And then the parent bottleers win Ernest is frustrated. Finally, in 1923, he's had enough. He decides that he's going to recruit a new company president to come in.
[01:14:07] David Rezenthal: This is just four years after he buys it. And almost against his will, he has to consider his son, Robert, as a candidate.
[01:14:19] David Rezenthal: He's the protagonist of this story. I mean, for all the John Pemberton lore and all the Aisa candler lore. Cocoa Cola, as we know it today, is Robert Woodruff's Coca Cola.
[01:14:36] Ben Gilbert: The boss, as he would come to be known. Yes. So Robert is 33 at this point in time. He has left Atlanta to seek his fortune away from his father's influence.
[01:14:48] David Rezenthal: And he has become the vice president of the white motor company in Ohio, in Cleveland, Ohio, which I think was one of if not the largest truck manufacturer in the US at the time.
[01:15:02] David Rezenthal: And Robert is a star there. He's widely regarded as one of the most talented young executives in new burgeoning corporate America here in the 20s.
[01:15:13] David Rezenthal: He's best friends with the Major League Baseball star Ty Cobb, they go hunting together. He's like a man about town. And standard oil of New Jersey is trying to hire him as an heir apparent to come in and potentially be the next CEO of standard oil of New Jersey.
[01:15:31] David Rezenthal: And David, do you know what standard oil of New Jersey is today?
[01:15:36] So right. Exxon. Exxon mobile. Oh, Exxon. That's right. That's right. Yeah. I can never keep track of which breakup company became which. So yeah, there's an alternative future where instead of CEO of Coke,
[01:15:48] David Rezenthal: Robert would have became CEO of Exxon. Yeah. And Robert through his own devices, again, almost against his father's will, had been an original investor in the syndicate that bought out Coke from the Candlers.
[01:16:03] David Rezenthal: So the board of coke makes Ernest consider his son. Ernest finally says, all right, fine. His first offer to Robert to come be the new president of Coca Cola is a salary less than half of what he's making at white motor company.
[01:16:22] David Rezenthal: Robert rejects that they negotiate back and forth. And finally, they reach a deal with Robert saying one condition that I absolutely must have is you dad, you are out. You are going to fully exit the business. Everything gets handed over to me.
[01:16:37] David Rezenthal: And I'm going to have full control and run this company. Ernest is frustrated enough. He says, okay. So in 1923, Robert takes over as president of the Coca Cola company becoming the youngest president of any major
[01:16:50] David Rezenthal: corporation in America at that time, he would run the company for the next 32 years as president and then control the company as chairman of the board for another 30 years after that until his death in 1985 wild.
[01:17:08] So one of the first moves that Robert makes when he comes in is to become close with the head ad man at coax ad agency at the time a firm in St. Louis called the Darcy ad agency and Coca Cola's main creative account man there.
[01:17:26] David Rezenthal: It's a guy named Archie Lee. Lee had already created a hit slogan for Coca Cola in Christmas of 1922 with his thirst knows no season campaign, which is a great phrase with a great ring to it, but was particularly good because coke had a legacy of primarily being enjoyed in the summer.
[01:17:46] David Rezenthal: Yeah, you drink it in the hot southern summers of Georgia. Yeah. So they're like wintertime is a big opportunity for us. And this was part of moving in on Christmas more to come on Christmas in a sec.
[01:17:57] David Rezenthal: And together, Archie Lee and Robert Woodruff make a pretty massive leap forward for Coca Cola advertising. And it's really the last critical piece of the brand.
[01:18:12] David Rezenthal: They embrace maybe I might even say create lifestyle advertising. This is everything that we talked about in the Rolex episode, but that was much later when Rolex did that in the 50s and 60s.
[01:18:26] David Rezenthal: This is in the 1920s Coca Cola is inventing this idea that through advertising, we can associate our products with feelings.
[01:18:38] Yes, this is the sort of opposite of the intrinsic advertising that we were talking about earlier. This is extrinsic advertising advertising that really has nothing to do with the features of the product.
[01:18:49] Ben Gilbert: It's about the life you will live if you associate with our brand. Yes, Coca Cola isn't a carbonated sweetened soft drink with unique flavor manufactured by the Coca Cola company. Coca Cola is happiness.
[01:19:03] David Rezenthal: Coca Cola is friendship. It's romance. It brings you closer with the people you love.
[01:19:10] David Rezenthal: Coca Cola is summertime. Coca Cola is holidays. Coca Cola is Christmas. And whether you are in America or not in America, Coca Cola is America.
[01:19:22] Yes. And boy, to the two of them just turn out some bangers. So our key eliminates basically all verbiage from Coca Cola advertising, except for one simple slogan.
[01:19:37] David Rezenthal: This is radical. Think back to those original ad copies that we were reading a minute ago. So many words. In this day and age in the 20s, there's so many words. Everything is so descriptive in 1923 when Robert takes the helm of the company. They come out with Coca Cola always delightful.
[01:19:56] David Rezenthal: Period. Four words. That's the campaign. The next year in 1924, they do better. Refresh yourself.
[01:20:04] David Rezenthal: That's it. You don't need to say anything more. And that was simplified from Archie Lee's original idea for the theme that your pause and refresh yourself.
[01:20:15] David Rezenthal: You would come back to that a couple years later in 1929 with the Grand Slam mother of them all, the pause that refreshes Coca Cola.
[01:20:27] David Rezenthal: Which is so funny because I know this is the winner. The pause that refreshes is the most successful campaign of this era. I actually didn't hear about that at all until doing this research. I associate all these other campaigns.
[01:20:40] Ben Gilbert: Delicious, refreshing or always delightful, but God did that take off. I mean, this idea that in your life, you just need a pause and everybody experiences that problem of needing a pause. And we are the thing that you do during that pause.
[01:20:57] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, genius. But by today's standards of language, it's a little bit clujy, I think.
[01:21:02] David Rezenthal: I think there was an element of the context of the time that came out in 1929, same years, the stock market crash. And so all through the 30s of the depression, this idea that Coke is a pause away from the harsh realities of your day to day existence in the depression, a simple luxury that you can take a pause and refresh with for only five cents when everything around you is going to shit.
[01:21:28] David Rezenthal: I think it really resonated. Yeah. So the slogans are revolutionary, cutting out all the verbiates, all the descriptive language. The other half of what Archie Lee and Bob Woodruff do with the brand is the imagery. So Lee goes out and he contracts with all these famous American artists and illustrators of the day to create these like American lifestyle tabloes for the visual aspects.
[01:21:57] David Rezenthal: Visual aspects of the coca ads. Yeah, it should be like a Coca Cola advertisement that says, idyllic as a Norman Rockwell painting, you might say yes, yes, because they actually go get Norman Rockwell along with NC Wyatt and had in some bloom and like some of the greatest American artists of the day to create what you think of as the idyllic Americana family life.
[01:22:23] David Rezenthal: It's all coming out of the Coca Cola ad department and they're partnering with the most looked up to athletes and celebrities, you know, these athletes promoting health that must be part of why they're so great at athletics.
[01:22:38] Ben Gilbert: They have carried grand Jean Harlow just associating with wholesomeness in Americana. Archie Lee would describe the function of the imagery aspect of the campaigns says the idea in an illustration must hit the viewer like a shot.
[01:22:52] David Rezenthal: It ought to force the exclamation from them. What a peach of an idea. Not only that, but they must remember that it was Coca Cola that was refreshing and good to drink in the image.
[01:23:05] David Rezenthal: And so he and the Darcy agency come up with a list of commandments for the Coca Cola account. Some of them are never split the trademark Coca Cola on two lines. Coca Cola must always be together on one line.
[01:23:19] David Rezenthal: The circular sign should always carry the phrase delicious and refreshing. You should never refer to Coca Cola as it is not an impersonal pronoun. It is Coca Cola.
[01:23:31] David Rezenthal: And you should never use Coca Cola in the personal sense such as Coca Cola invites you to lunch or Coca Cola invites you to enjoy Coca Cola is above that.
[01:23:42] David Rezenthal: The other thing that happens in this era is billboards by 1930 there are now 29 million cars on the road. So billboards sort of became this really valuable way to promote the brand and lifestyle of Coca Cola.
[01:23:56] Ben Gilbert: And Woodruff his lieutenants would often go around saying that what Woodruff wants to do is make Coca Cola the most American thing in America.
[01:24:05] Well, speaking of the most American of things, how about the commercialization of Christmas and Santa Claus?
[01:24:16] David Rezenthal: Because in 1931 Lee and Woodruff and the Coca Cola crew create what I think is unquestionably the greatest lifestyle advertising success in human history where they manage to associate Santa Claus.
[01:24:34] David Rezenthal: Santa Claus with Coca Cola. It's amazing and really bring the modern Santa Claus into existence period. They sort of standardized the concept of Santa. The one that we see today is pretty much Coca Cola Santa.
[01:24:49] Ben Gilbert: Yes, okay. So what happens? Coke does not invent Santa as a common urban legend. Right. First let's bust that myth.
[01:24:57] David Rezenthal: Santa Claus existed long before 1931 and Coke. The famous night before Christmas poem was written in 1823. So it's been around for a long time. And of course there was Saint Nicholas goes back many, many hundreds of years.
[01:25:10] David Rezenthal: And there was a very popular Santa which was Thomas Nass Santa, who is this sort of shorter elf like Santa, will link to it in the email that is on its way to becoming Santa but is not the big smiley approachable sort of red face cheery jolly Santa.
[01:25:29] Ben Gilbert: Big fat dude. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing. You read the night before Christmas poem. Santa's an elf. He's little.
[01:25:36] Or he was before Coca Cola. So in 1931, Coke commissions the artist had in sun bloom to create Christmas ad imagery for Coca Cola featuring Santa Claus. And so this being a coke ad sun bloom is like, well, I'm going to make Santa as red as possible in Coca Cola red. And then I'm going to make him as big as possible to get as much Coca Cola red in the picture.
[01:26:04] David Rezenthal: And it creates the first of his Coca Cola Santa campaigns that he would make for the next 33 years until 1964. And it debuts at Christmas time in a full color advertisement in the Saturday evening post.
[01:26:25] David Rezenthal: People absolutely love it. You got to remember this 1931. So this is before television and magazines had only just started to be commonly printed in color. So before this point in time, you couldn't really get mass produced color images out to the public.
[01:26:47] David Rezenthal: So Santa didn't have a color like nobody really thought about what color Santa was. That's right. Because sometimes Santa was red. Sometimes Santa was green. Yep. Blue, yellow. The point is there was no standardization. All of a sudden now, Coke's got this huge industrial imagery machine of not only advertisements in the Saturday evening post, but all the billboards and the signs and the point of sale merchandise, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:27:13] David Rezenthal: Plastering America with this big beautiful color version of Santa, which is funny because Pepsi also did do some Santa illustrations, but Coke kind of ran away with it. And it became clear pretty early. Coke is just going to own Santa. Yep.
[01:27:30] Ben Gilbert: David, do you know who hadn't sunblem also created or the most famous illustration of? I don't I should know.
[01:27:39] David Rezenthal: There's two one is Quaker Oats. The Quaker Oats man. Oh, yes, I did read that, which interestingly is owned by Pepsi today. Oh, we will get into Quaker Oats.
[01:27:50] David Rezenthal: And the other is Aunt Jramima. I did not know that as discussed on our Mars episode. And this was really the day on the coffin for Coke being a summer drink. I've heard that the most Coke is now sold during the holidays, which is amazing since it was a refreshing thing serve for the hot Atlanta summer.
[01:28:09] David Rezenthal: Yeah, unbelievable. They also during this time period get into partnerships, big giant landmark brand partnerships, the first of which is the Olympics. Coca-Cola was a sponsor of the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, which makes them the longest running Olympic sponsor. And at the LA 28 games that will make 100 years of Coca-Cola partnering with the Olympics.
[01:28:38] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, I was going to say the 1928 games in Amsterdam were there any other sponsors like the Olympics probably weren't a commercial thing yet. I think that's right. I think it was really innovative. Yeah, man, no Coca-Cola, no visa.
[01:28:51] David Rezenthal: Right. And this predates all the stuff that Coca-Cola did with the world's fair and with World Cup and with all these other big sort of global brand stage events.
[01:29:00] Interesting. The other big pillar in the ground that Woodruff puts in in these first 10 years is around standardization. This is when he really throws his arms up and says we're going to stop changing the formula.
[01:29:10] Ben Gilbert: And my understanding is from that point on in 1920-ish all the way until 1985, there was no changes to the Coca-Cola formula. Woodruff's Coca-Cola was that 65 year unchanged formula.
[01:29:28] Ben Gilbert: Oh, geez, what happened in 1985 besides Robert Woodruff dying, which is directly related to what else happened in 1985?
[01:29:35] David Rezenthal: We will get there. But it's this notion of everything should be standardized. It should be the formula. It should be the marketing. It should be the packaging. They were already in this ballpark, but it was his idea that wherever you are when you reach for a Coke, it should feel the same. It should taste the same. It should have the same temperature.
[01:29:52] Ben Gilbert: And so the spiritual thing that he does to sort of illustrate this is he goes to the bank in New York and says we are repaying the loan. We are taking our formula, the canonical one of one formula. We are moving it to our bank, the Trust Company Bank in Atlanta, which would become Sun Trust.
[01:30:11] Ben Gilbert: And it would sit there for the next 86 years.
[01:30:14] Ben Gilbert: And it is now in world of Coca-Cola, right?
[01:30:17] David Rezenthal: Yes. And the reason it is there, they made this whole big parade of we're taking it out of the bank and we're putting it in world of Coca-Cola.
[01:30:25] Ben Gilbert: Theme park for lack of a better phrase.
[01:30:27] David Rezenthal: The Coca-Cola version of Hershey Park.
[01:30:28] David Rezenthal: Yes. That is a vault that is very meant to be gazed upon because when they did move it there about a decade and a half ago, they kind of realized,
[01:30:37] Ben Gilbert: for a long time to many generations, we made a big deal of we have this secret formula and you need to know about it. We're going to be really loud about it, but it's super secret. So you can't see it.
[01:30:47] Ben Gilbert: And that worked and it really lived in the public's consciousness and it had sort of fallen out.
[01:30:52] Ben Gilbert: It was an effort in 2011 to kind of shake the public and especially the younger generations and say we are Coca-Cola and we have the one secret formula.
[01:31:01] Ben Gilbert: And we want to bring it back to your attention that we have something that is super secret and worth protecting.
[01:31:06] Ben Gilbert: The other thing Woodruff does in these early years is he creates the company's first statistical department to do market research and study the business and customers sort of quantitatively.
[01:31:17] David Rezenthal: They realize that by this point, they've basically saturated the market of every man, woman, child in America.
[01:31:24] David Rezenthal: Population growth is only going to get them so far in terms of growth in the business.
[01:31:28] David Rezenthal: So what they need to do is they need to find ways for existing Coca-Cola drinkers to access and drink Coca-Cola more often.
[01:31:37] David Rezenthal: Now remember what was Woodruff doing before he negotiated with his dad to come to Coca-Cola.
[01:31:43] David Rezenthal: He was at the white motor company and he was being recruited by standard oil of New Jersey.
[01:31:50] David Rezenthal: He's like, guys, we need to get Coca-Cola into gas stations.
[01:31:56] David Rezenthal: So he decrees that gas stations is the next major growth opportunity for the company.
[01:32:02] David Rezenthal: We need to take that opportunity to put a Coke in their hands.
[01:32:04] David Rezenthal: So they contract out a design for a cooler because if you're going to keep Coke's ice cold at 34 degrees in gas stations, they need to be in a cooler.
[01:32:16] David Rezenthal: They get a company in a manufacturer and they go around the country and install 32,000 Coca-Cola coolers in gas stations around the country just in the first year.
[01:32:28] And giant signs, right, that say Coca-Cola sold here or drink Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola always refreshing.
[01:32:34] Ben Gilbert: Yep. In the gas stations. This is the precursor to coin-operated bending machines which they introduced in 1937 and Coke is the first company to do that.
[01:32:45] David Rezenthal: And someone told me in the research that the gas station owners absolutely loved this because A, the signs told people you can come get a Coke here,
[01:32:56] Ben Gilbert: which was a value proposition for people. But B, just like we're talking about, there's so much margin to go around being the retailer of soft drinks, especially at this time that they were making more money on Coke than gas.
[01:33:10] Ben Gilbert: Yep. So of course you want this. The gas is a pure commodity. You're selling against other gas stations in the area. This is where you can actually make some real margin dollars.
[01:33:19] Ben Gilbert: Totally. You don't make money on the gas. You make money on the convenience store.
[01:33:23] David Rezenthal: Starting with Coke. The other big change in operations that Robert brings to the company is the relationship with the bottlers.
[01:33:34] David Rezenthal: This is part of his standardization push. A whole bunch of bottlers are great. And a whole bunch are not, you know, there's 1200 independent businesses out there.
[01:33:43] David Rezenthal: And so he goes around and at first he starts trying to like bully and intimidate the shall we say less standardized bottlers into, you know, meeting his maniacal quality standards.
[01:33:55] David Rezenthal: After a while, he realizes, wait a minute. Why am I wasting my time trying to convince these small town entrepreneurs to do what I want. I'll just buy him out.
[01:34:03] David Rezenthal: And so he changes course for the Coca-Cola company and says, I'm now willing to buy and own and operate bottlers.
[01:34:11] David Rezenthal: Not because I want to, but as a way to like forced standardization and clean up underperforming bottlers. I'll buy him out, fix him up, and then I'll resell him to local entrepreneurs.
[01:34:22] David Rezenthal: I didn't realize that started that early. Yeah, he started that in the 20s. Wow. He also realizes, wait a minute.
[01:34:29] David Rezenthal: This bottling, franchising operation works pretty well here in America. Pretty sure we can do it overseas too.
[01:34:37] David Rezenthal: So during the 20s and 30s, he goes to Europe, he goes to South America, starts setting up international bottlers there. Same model, local entrepreneurs, locally owned businesses with every incentive in the world to push. Coca-Cola.
[01:34:52] Yep. Now there is still that one term of the deal that was we will always sell a gallon for a dollar.
[01:35:02] Ben Gilbert: That starts to become problematic with inflation. You want the ability to change the price at some point over several decades.
[01:35:11] Ben Gilbert: And so it's pretty interesting to think about the two sides of the coin of having to sell it at one dollar in perpetuity.
[01:35:21] Ben Gilbert: The con is obviously, well, inflation's going to happen. And so our margins are going to get squeezed where it's just going to cost more and more and more to make Coca-Cola.
[01:35:31] Ben Gilbert: The bet that they basically were making is, well, since we can't raise prices at all, we need to scale to amortize all of our fixed costs and get greater and greater economies of scale on manufacturing.
[01:35:45] Ben Gilbert: And so it sort of forced them into this massive scale mentality that they were already sort of in. They wanted to be the one Coca-Cola for the world.
[01:35:54] Ben Gilbert: But this really backed them into that strategy as you don't have another strategy. Your economies of scale in manufacturing need to outpace inflation. So get going.
[01:36:06] Yep. And the flip side of it is it was also in the contract that the bottlers had to sell to retailers at the enforced retail price of five cents a cook.
[01:36:17] Ben Gilbert: And as we get into the depression, that becomes a huge lever against potential competitors.
[01:36:25] David Rezenthal: How's that?
[01:36:26] Ben Gilbert: Because all the other competitors who are at much smaller scale than Coke as the depression hits and inflation starts running rampant, they need to raise their prices.
[01:36:37] David Rezenthal: But here's Coke, which is arguably a superior product. It's certainly superior in that it's brand recognition is much wider than any competing cola.
[01:36:46] David Rezenthal: And Coke is cheaper.
[01:36:50] David Rezenthal: So it's this amazing leverage that they have over the market. So between the trademark litigation, the proprietary bottle, and now the pricing power across the market.
[01:37:04] David Rezenthal: Coke is just steam rolling all existing and potential competition out there, which is so funny. You say pricing power, because it's not more expensive. In fact, it's most often far less expensive than the competition.
[01:37:17] Yes, but I think the competition was having to hit the nickel price to try and compete with Coke and their margins because they were sub scale would be much, much, much worse.
[01:37:25] David Rezenthal: Yeah. Coke can be profitable at way lower and consumer prices than the other sub scale companies.
[01:37:33] Ben Gilbert: Yes.
[01:37:34] David Rezenthal: It's like they actually have pricing power that they're not using.
[01:37:37] Yes, they have a latent pricing power.
[01:37:39] It's like more strategic to them to not raise prices.
[01:37:42] Ben Gilbert: Yes.
[01:37:43] David Rezenthal: So not good news for any competitors out there and they basically all except for a small handful get steamrolled except for one Pepsi, which amazingly started way back when Coke started.
[01:38:01] Yep. 1894.
[01:38:03] David Rezenthal: And for many years, it was just one of the other colas out there, you know, would be competitors. Actually, I had no idea about this till doing the research.
[01:38:12] David Rezenthal: Pepsi tried to sell itself to Coca-Cola like sell its operations to Coca-Cola three separate times over the years.
[01:38:21] David Rezenthal: Three? I didn't know that.
[01:38:23] Ben Gilbert: Three times.
[01:38:24] David Rezenthal: Wow.
[01:38:25] David Rezenthal: And Coca-Cola, you know, the various owners over the years turned it down three times.
[01:38:31] David Rezenthal: Amazing.
[01:38:32] Ben Gilbert: Until the depression.
[01:38:35] David Rezenthal: And that is what changes Pepsi's fortunes.
[01:38:39] David Rezenthal: So Coke, like we've just been saying, is selling for a nickel and it's super hard for anybody else to match it.
[01:38:46] David Rezenthal: But they had one week spot that they didn't quite think through.
[01:38:52] David Rezenthal: And it was actually the proprietary Maywest contour bottle.
[01:38:58] David Rezenthal: It was six and a half ounces.
[01:39:00] David Rezenthal: That's not a lot of drink in that bottle, especially by today's standards.
[01:39:04] David Rezenthal: It's smaller than a mini can. I think the mini cans are seven and a half ounces today.
[01:39:08] David Rezenthal: Let's see. I got one right here.
[01:39:10] Ben Gilbert: The mini cans very popular today.
[01:39:12] Ben Gilbert: That's been a shift seven and a half.
[01:39:14] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:39:15] Ben Gilbert: The original bottles were smaller than this.
[01:39:18] Six and a half ounces. Very small.
[01:39:20] David Rezenthal: So even though they were a nickel, you weren't getting a lot of refreshment in that bottle.
[01:39:27] David Rezenthal: In 1934 Pepsi in almost a last ditch effort to try and just do something to stay alive and save the
[01:39:36] David Rezenthal: company tests using recycled beer bottles, which are 12 ounce bottles to sell Pepsi.
[01:39:46] David Rezenthal: Also for a nickel.
[01:39:48] David Rezenthal: And when you say save the company just before you go on, this is not new to Pepsi.
[01:39:52] Ben Gilbert: The Pepsi that exists today is like four Pepsi's later from the Pepsi that was started around
[01:40:00] Ben Gilbert: the same time Coca-Cola was. Coca-Cola has been approximately one company all the way through.
[01:40:04] Ben Gilbert: Pepsi's been bankrupt two, three times and sold to new owners and completely new companies
[01:40:10] Ben Gilbert: started with the word Pepsi in it. This has been a rocky road for them.
[01:40:13] Ben Gilbert: Yes, but this is when its fortunes turn.
[01:40:17] David Rezenthal: So in 1934 they start selling Pepsi in 12 ounce recycled beer bottles.
[01:40:24] David Rezenthal: Now they still have the same pricing pressure, you know, and margin pressure from Coke selling
[01:40:30] David Rezenthal: at a nickel. But it turns out if you look at the unit drivers of margins on beverages.
[01:40:35] David Rezenthal: Oh, there's two expenses. There's sugar and there's the bottle and then everything else is
[01:40:39] Ben Gilbert: approximately free. So the amount of liquid in the bottle, like you said,
[01:40:44] David Rezenthal: that is approximately free, whether you're serving six ounces of liquid per bottle or 12 ounces of
[01:40:50] David Rezenthal: liquid per bottle or later 64 ounces of liquid per bottle. Yep. Not going to impact your margins that
[01:40:55] David Rezenthal: much. And hey, oh, by the way, there's a lot of existing 12 ounce beer bottles out there that we
[01:41:02] David Rezenthal: can buy up super cheap and put our Pepsi in. Pepsi start selling 12 ounce bottles also for a nickel.
[01:41:11] David Rezenthal: Their cost structure just declined because they can get their recycled beer bottles.
[01:41:15] David Rezenthal: Didn't impact their margins by putting more liquid in there. And now they've got a really
[01:41:20] David Rezenthal: compelling consumer value proposition during the depression twice as much cola for the same price.
[01:41:28] Yep. And that is the first real punch that anyone's been able to land on Coca-Cola.
[01:41:35] Ben Gilbert: Yep. This is textbook counter positioning. Coca-Cola cannot respond because they and their
[01:41:43] David Rezenthal: bottleers have just invested all of this capital and all of this IP into the six and a half ounce
[01:41:50] David Rezenthal: contour bottle. They can't react. Yeah. Genius. Truly genius. I mean, it was like back against
[01:41:57] David Rezenthal: the wall genius, but genius. Now it doesn't do much for Pepsi's brand. They're very obviously saying
[01:42:02] Ben Gilbert: like pick us because of quantity, not because we are the more delicious or better or more prestigious
[01:42:07] Ben Gilbert: beverage. And I think this decision, while it kept them alive, was sort of a hangover that they
[01:42:14] Ben Gilbert: would have for the next 80 years of this like, yeah, we're not as good. We're not the best flavor,
[01:42:20] Ben Gilbert: but like we're also here and you can get a lot of us for cheap. Well, are they the best flavor?
[01:42:26] David Rezenthal: Are they not? Oh, come back to that. Well, that's all subjective. There's a discount promise to the
[01:42:30] David Rezenthal: brand. Yes. Which in 1934 is kind of all that matters with consumers. Went over real well. Yeah.
[01:42:38] Ben Gilbert: So Coke can't fight them on the amount of liquid in the bottle because they're locked into the
[01:42:42] David Rezenthal: six and a half ounce and they don't want to cheap in their brand. So instead they pull out another,
[01:42:48] David Rezenthal: you know, arrow in their quiver to fire against competitors. They sue Pepsi for trademark infringement.
[01:42:56] David Rezenthal: Pepsi Cola. You can't use the word Cola. We have trademarked the word Cola. So in this court process,
[01:43:03] David Rezenthal: the president of Pepsi at the time, a guy named Walter Mac ends up discovering that Coca Cola had
[01:43:11] David Rezenthal: illegally bribed and intimidated another Cola competitor out there into shutting down. They paid a
[01:43:19] David Rezenthal: bribe to the company owner to just shut down rather than going through a litigation. Mac brings
[01:43:28] David Rezenthal: this evidence to the court where Coca Cola is suing Pepsi for trademark infringement. Bob Woodruff
[01:43:34] David Rezenthal: immediately calls him up and requests a meeting. Bob comes up to New York, sits down with Mac
[01:43:40] David Rezenthal: and he's like, Hey, this is all a big misunderstanding. I'm a good Southern gentleman. I don't
[01:43:49] David Rezenthal: know what do you think about this. But you know what? Why don't we just settle all of this trademark
[01:43:56] David Rezenthal: stuff? You can still use the word Cola. Is that what he's offering him? Yeah. The outcome of this
[01:44:02] David Rezenthal: is that Pepsi Cola becomes the only Coke competitor that is allowed to use the word Cola legally at this
[01:44:09] David Rezenthal: plane time, which destroys any precedent of Coca Cola protecting Cola. It means they are forever
[01:44:16] Ben Gilbert: giving up their argument in the courts that we own Cola as a part of our trademark. Woodruff
[01:44:22] David Rezenthal: apparently despite this conciliation hadn't learned his lesson and was still not above trying to
[01:44:27] David Rezenthal: bribe his competitors. He tries to bribe Mac by saying like, you know, do you really want to be
[01:44:33] David Rezenthal: running this Pepsi thing? I'm still great buddies with the white motor folks. I think you would make
[01:44:39] David Rezenthal: a great president of white motors. I would really love to recommend you for that job. And Walter
[01:44:44] David Rezenthal: Maxx like, absolutely not. I'm keeping Pepsi. Thank you for settling the trademark litigation.
[01:44:50] It doesn't Coca Cola's general counsel quit over this too. Yes. Yes. That's right. I think the idea
[01:44:55] David Rezenthal: is like, come on, we got to fight this. We can't just like be giving up our trademarks. Yes.
[01:45:00] Ben Gilbert: But Woodruff, this is one of the few times where I feel like he put an idealistic approach aside and
[01:45:06] Ben Gilbert: said, we got to be pragmatic here. We got to settle with these guys. So the result of this is that
[01:45:10] David Rezenthal: Pepsi becomes Coke's first real legitimate competitor. And by August 1941. So it's at six, seven
[01:45:18] David Rezenthal: years later. Colas that are not Coca Cola have 14% of the US soft drink market share. The majority of
[01:45:28] David Rezenthal: which is Pepsi. There's a major chicken. The arm is basically 100% Coke before this happened.
[01:45:37] David Rezenthal: And Pepsi establishes a pretty meaningful foothold. Yep. So on the one hand, this is a real bad
[01:45:46] David Rezenthal: thing for the Coca Cola company. They went from having essentially a monopoly on the market to
[01:45:52] David Rezenthal: letting a real legitimate competitor get established in the US. But a really, really good thing
[01:46:02] David Rezenthal: is also about to happen to the Coca Cola company. That makes the US market itself one of many,
[01:46:10] David Rezenthal: shall we say. And that is World War Two. But before we tell that story, now is a great time to think.
[01:46:18] Ben Gilbert: One of our favorite partners Shopify. Okay. So last time, David, I took you on a tour of my house
[01:46:24] Ben Gilbert: and all the brands I own that have built their businesses on Shopify. Today, I'm going to take you on
[01:46:29] Ben Gilbert: a tour of all the places or all the channels that you can sell with Shopify. Great. I love it. Let's do
[01:46:35] David Rezenthal: it. All right. So starting with the most obvious direct to consumer websites, glossier.com,
[01:46:41] Ben Gilbert: Warby Parker.com, Mattel.com, all built on Shopify. Next, a lot of people don't realize this. But
[01:46:47] Ben Gilbert: Shopify also powers a lot of physical retail with Shopify point of sale. So brands like all birds
[01:46:54] Ben Gilbert: and parachute and aloe. When you buy in store, you're often checking out on Shopify hardware with
[01:47:00] Ben Gilbert: Shopify software. Hmm. Interesting. Got it. Okay. Then there's social commerce. So Instagram,
[01:47:07] Ben Gilbert: TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube, and even Roblox brands can connect their Shopify store and enable
[01:47:12] Ben Gilbert: shopping directly where the customers are and all the selling and fulfillment actually happens
[01:47:17] Ben Gilbert: on Shopify behind the scenes. Another big one that surprises people. Get this David Amazon.
[01:47:23] Ben Gilbert: Whoa. Amazon. Yeah. Walmart target plus Shopify makes it easy to expand into these marketplaces.
[01:47:32] Ben Gilbert: So merchants can sync their products and manage sales all from one unified platform. And of course,
[01:47:37] Ben Gilbert: there's the shop app, which now has over a hundred million users. Lastly, the big recent one AI.
[01:47:43] Ben Gilbert: Toby has talked about how all in the company is on AI. I'm sure you saw recently, David,
[01:47:47] Ben Gilbert: that open AI launched instant checkout. So when you see buy links and chat Gbt, there's a good
[01:47:52] Ben Gilbert: chance Shopify is powering those. And on top of that, Shopify just launched what they call an AI
[01:47:57] Ben Gilbert: co-founder called sidekick, which can help answer business questions, create marketing slogans,
[01:48:02] Ben Gilbert: edit product images, and even design and code your store all within Shopify.
[01:48:06] Ben Gilbert: The innovation coming out of Shopify is just awesome. And some of the biggest brands in the world
[01:48:11] David Rezenthal: are now on board, including General Motors, Estee Lauder, and AirOne are all using Shopify to sell
[01:48:16] David Rezenthal: directly to their customers. So whether you're just starting out or you're at global scale, Shopify
[01:48:21] Ben Gilbert: lets you sell anywhere your customers are. Get started at Shopify.com slash acquired and be sure
[01:48:26] Ben Gilbert: to tell them that Ben and David sent you. Okay, David. World War two. All right. G how did Coke end up
[01:48:34] Ben Gilbert: all over the world? So remember, we said a minute ago that Woodruff had set up international
[01:48:41] David Rezenthal: bottleers in the 20s and 30s before World War two. But none of it was very big yet. By the time
[01:48:47] David Rezenthal: America enters World War two in 1941, Coke at this point has already been around for 55 years,
[01:48:55] David Rezenthal: and has already established itself as like a quintessential part of America. So the military and
[01:49:01] David Rezenthal: the US government realize, hey, Coke may actually be one of America's best weapons in this war.
[01:49:09] David Rezenthal: I mean, one, it's a symbol of home and something for the troops morale. They can keep fighting for
[01:49:16] David Rezenthal: abroad all across the world. And two, what greater symbol of American prosperity to bring and plant
[01:49:23] David Rezenthal: seeds of all around the world than Coca-Cola. It's our perfect, you know, cultural ambassador product
[01:49:30] David Rezenthal: yeah, whether the rest of the world looked it at that way, TBD, but I'm sure the US government
[01:49:34] Ben Gilbert: looked at it as like a great ambassador of our values. And however, people around the world saw
[01:49:39] David Rezenthal: at the time, one way or another, they ended up drinking Coca-Cola. Yep. So first at the outside of
[01:49:45] David Rezenthal: the war, the US introduces sugar rationing Coca-Cola immediately lobbies the government for an
[01:49:52] David Rezenthal: exemption. And they produce supporting evidence like this letter from a military supply officer.
[01:49:59] David Rezenthal: Very few people have ever stopped to consider the great part that Coca-Cola plays in the
[01:50:03] David Rezenthal: building and maintaining of morale among military personnel. Frankly speaking, we would be at a
[01:50:09] David Rezenthal: loss to find anything as satisfying and refreshing a beverage to replace Coca-Cola. In our opinion,
[01:50:15] David Rezenthal: Coca-Cola could be classified as one of the essential morale building products for the boys
[01:50:21] David Rezenthal: in the service, which is interesting because what Coke doesn't win is an exemption on the sugar
[01:50:26] Ben Gilbert: rationing. What they do win is they get to supply Coca-Cola free of rations to the military.
[01:50:33] Ben Gilbert: And they just get to take a really broad lens on what to the military means.
[01:50:38] Ben Gilbert: I believe the way it ends up coming down is technically yes what you said Ben, but it applies to
[01:50:47] David Rezenthal: any bottler that serves retailers that are located near a military base. Regardless of whether
[01:50:55] David Rezenthal: that bottler also serves civilian customers. So for large portions of the US,
[01:51:02] David Rezenthal: yeah, they can still get full sugar Coca-Cola during the war. Wow. None of Coca-Cola's competitors,
[01:51:08] David Rezenthal: including Pepsi, get anything like this. This was a big legal battle. Pepsi was basically saying,
[01:51:13] Ben Gilbert: hey, you can't just say this supplier gets an exemption by name. You have to say like,
[01:51:17] Ben Gilbert: Cola's due and the response back from the government is basically like, sorry Coca-Cola is about
[01:51:22] Ben Gilbert: as American as it gets. And that's what we need right now. And that's what our our boys are requesting,
[01:51:27] Ben Gilbert: including general soon to be president Eisenhower. Oh, yeah, he's a Coke man. So the military under
[01:51:36] David Rezenthal: Eisenhower grants Coca-Cola employees, quote unquote, technical observer status, meaning that they can
[01:51:44] David Rezenthal: participate in the supply and infrastructure buildout of the military around the world. Just the same
[01:51:51] David Rezenthal: is military infrastructure people. This is unbelievable. So as the American military is like
[01:51:57] David Rezenthal: advancing in the global theater all around the world, Coca-Cola is right there with them,
[01:52:02] David Rezenthal: setting up bottling playhunts and production lines to supply the troops and documenting the absolute
[01:52:09] Ben Gilbert: crap out of it to use in their advertising. Yes. So Robert Woodruff, 1941 comes right out and pledges
[01:52:17] Ben Gilbert: that anywhere where an American soldier is fighting the war, they will be able to get a Coca-Cola
[01:52:24] Ben Gilbert: and they'll be able to get that for five cents. Yep. There are these just unbelievable quotes from
[01:52:31] David Rezenthal: American GIs during the war that are in for God country and Coca-Cola. There's two of them I picked
[01:52:36] David Rezenthal: out here. One, I always thought Coca-Cola was a wonderful drink, but on an island where few Americans
[01:52:42] David Rezenthal: have ever set foot, it is a godsend. I can truthfully say that I haven't seen smiles spread over
[01:52:48] David Rezenthal: a bunch of boys faces as they did when they saw Coca-Cola in this God forsaken place. Wow. And then
[01:52:55] David Rezenthal: if anyone were to ask us what we are fighting for, we think half of us would answer the right to
[01:53:01] David Rezenthal: buy Coca-Cola again. These are actual quotes from letters from American GIs during the war.
[01:53:07] David Rezenthal: Unbelievable. And supply them they did. 1941 to 1945, 64 portable bottling plants were sent to Asia,
[01:53:16] Ben Gilbert: Europe, and North Africa. And the best estimates are that more than five billion bottles were
[01:53:21] Ben Gilbert: distributed to troops during the war. Wow. I saw an estimate that it was 10 billion. Wow.
[01:53:27] Which of course the US government loves just as much as it loved it during the war because
[01:53:33] David Rezenthal: what better symbol of America to have left behind in all these countries around the world than
[01:53:39] David Rezenthal: Coca-Cola. So Coca-Cola internally ends up calling the war effort the greatest sampling program
[01:53:48] David Rezenthal: in the history of the world. And they estimate that the war effort opened up markets abroad for
[01:53:55] David Rezenthal: Coca-Cola that otherwise would have taken 25 years and untold millions of dollars of investment to open.
[01:54:02] David Rezenthal: Wow. To say it accelerated, Coke's international rollout is like understatement of the century.
[01:54:08] That's international, but then back home it really cemented Coke as this is an apple pie in a bottle.
[01:54:14] Ben Gilbert: All the servicemen coming home, Coke was the treat that you could get when you were at war.
[01:54:18] Ben Gilbert: You better believe they're Coke drinkers for life now. They're not switching brands.
[01:54:22] So after the war in 1950, a third of Coke's profits are already coming from abroad from all these
[01:54:29] David Rezenthal: things that they got set up. And Time Magazine features Coca-Cola on the cover of Time Magazine.
[01:54:37] David Rezenthal: Have you seen this? Oh, wasn't it the first product ever on the cover of the magazine?
[01:54:41] Ben Gilbert: It might have been. I'm not sure about that, but have you seen what the image is?
[01:54:44] David Rezenthal: No. It's a painting, like an oil painting, of an anthropomorphized red Coca-Cola disc with arms
[01:54:51] David Rezenthal: in a face. And it is larger than the earth. And it is sitting behind the earth, reaching around
[01:54:59] David Rezenthal: and feeding the smiling earth a bottle of Coca-Cola. And the caption on the cover of Time Magazine says
[01:55:07] David Rezenthal: world and friend. The implication being that Coca-Cola is a friend to the world.
[01:55:13] David Rezenthal: Wow. Crazy, right? So it's funny before World War II, there was a presence for Coca-Cola
[01:55:21] Ben Gilbert: and pre-Nazi Germany. Oh, yes, I know what story you're about to tell.
[01:55:25] David Rezenthal: As you can imagine, it became difficult to supply Nazi Germany with American Coca-Cola during the war,
[01:55:31] Ben Gilbert: since those factories, German Coca-Cola factories lost touch with the mothership and all the
[01:55:38] Ben Gilbert: ingredients that they would need to source. They found alternate ingredients and made kind of like
[01:55:44] Ben Gilbert: a crappier knockoff drink that they could make with the supplies they had. Yep. That drink is phanta.
[01:55:52] Ben Gilbert: Yep. Yeah. Phanta, owned by Coca-Cola, was the brainchild of Nazi Germany Coca-Cola
[01:56:03] David Rezenthal: bottling entrepreneurs who lost access temporarily to the real thing and did that instead.
[01:56:09] Ben Gilbert: They would change the formula on. They would launch it in the US later in 1960, but phanta has its
[01:56:13] Ben Gilbert: origins as we can't get real Coca-Cola in Germany during World War II. So this is what we're making.
[01:56:19] Ben Gilbert: Name and all. Phanta is the name they came up with. Yeah. Parts of history that most people don't know.
[01:56:24] David Rezenthal: Don't you want to phanta phanta? Yeah. The thing that happens post-war just because we've
[01:56:31] Ben Gilbert: planted this seed elsewhere and to follow it through 1945 is the year that Coca-Cola officially embraces
[01:56:37] Ben Gilbert: Coke and trademarks it. And from here on out, they actually do start referring to it as Coke
[01:56:42] Ben Gilbert: in the advertising. Yep. So coming out of the war, Coca-Cola's business at least had never been
[01:56:50] David Rezenthal: better. The brand domestically has regained any of the ground that it lost to Pepsi during the
[01:56:55] David Rezenthal: Depression. Internationally, they've just accelerated 25 years worth of market development into four.
[01:57:04] David Rezenthal: And are basically like part of US government policy during the Cold War to keep Coca-Cola flowing
[01:57:11] David Rezenthal: into countries around the world. For Pepsi, things are not as bright after the war. They didn't have
[01:57:19] David Rezenthal: any of the benefits that Coke had. And so once again, they find themselves in a position of
[01:57:25] David Rezenthal: backs against the wall need to do something different here. So right at the end of the 1940s,
[01:57:32] David Rezenthal: they poached a Coca-Cola executive named Alfred Steele. He does the unthinkable for a Coke man.
[01:57:41] David Rezenthal: He defects to Pepsi, the inferior imitator. That's how they refer to it in internal
[01:57:48] Ben Gilbert: communications. They don't write Pepsi. They say the imitator. The imitator. So Steele had been an
[01:57:54] David Rezenthal: ad man at the Darcy agency and then he moved to Coke and joined Coke in house. Basically,
[01:58:01] David Rezenthal: as soon as he gets to Pepsi, Steele stages a coup and kicks out Walter Mack who had been running
[01:58:07] David Rezenthal: Pepsi for like the last 20 years. He shoves him out and Steele becomes the new president of Pepsi.
[01:58:13] David Rezenthal: He's quite the maverick, shall we say. There are just some hilarious quotes from him about his
[01:58:20] David Rezenthal: management philosophy. One example quote, the whole trick in hiring executives is to find a good man
[01:58:27] David Rezenthal: and turn him into a prick. A good man will be able to stand the course. But if the guy was a prick
[01:58:33] David Rezenthal: to begin with, he'll crumble along the way. And then I don't care if the consumer wants carbonated
[01:58:40] David Rezenthal: sweat in a goat skin pouch. If so, this side of the room go looking for goats and that side start
[01:58:46] David Rezenthal: running fiercely in place. This is Alfred Steele. And not only does he turn around Pepsi's
[01:58:59] David Rezenthal: fortunes, I think Pepsi really becomes the more interesting company than Coke for at least the
[01:59:07] David Rezenthal: next call it 30, 40 years here after World War II. Coke has had this incredible success on the back
[01:59:16] David Rezenthal: of the war, but they're also pretty fat and happy. They're not interested in rocking the boat,
[01:59:21] David Rezenthal: shall we say. Steele clearly doesn't give a crap about tradition or history or anything.
[01:59:27] David Rezenthal: Nothing to lose. So Steele when he gets to Pepsi says, all right, we're going to do three radical
[01:59:35] David Rezenthal: things. So one, this was started by Walter Mack before Steele got there, but he continues it.
[01:59:43] David Rezenthal: We are going to market our product to black Americans. This was radical probably for any major
[01:59:52] David Rezenthal: consumer industry at the time. We are going to hire an all black sales team that is going to
[01:59:57] David Rezenthal: target black retail outlets for Pepsi. We are going to run marketing campaigns specifically targeted
[02:00:04] David Rezenthal: at the black community with black celebrities. Not only was this radical for any brand at the time,
[02:00:10] David Rezenthal: it was especially radical for the soft drink industry because Coke was not doing anything close to
[02:00:16] David Rezenthal: this. In fact, Robert Woodruff was openly supporting segregationist politicians during this time.
[02:00:22] David Rezenthal: So this is a huge opportunity for Pepsi. And Woodruff would later radically flip on that, right?
[02:00:28] Ben Gilbert: Yes. Wasn't he a big part of with Mayer Hart's field of desegregating a lot of stuff in Atlanta?
[02:00:36] Ben Gilbert: He eventually really came around. During the 40s, definitely not. This was a big area for Pepsi to
[02:00:43] David Rezenthal: make inroads. There's also an element of geography here too. I mean, Coca-Cola is a
[02:00:49] David Rezenthal: Atlanta's biggest company, a traditional southern company, whereas Pepsi is based in New York.
[02:00:55] David Rezenthal: Okay, so that's one. Two steel decides we're going to start appealing to this early trend that I see
[02:01:04] David Rezenthal: happening in post-war 1950s America of diet fats. We're going to position Pepsi as the lighter drink
[02:01:14] David Rezenthal: versus Coca-Cola. It will refresh without filling. Now, how much of this is actually true in terms of
[02:01:21] David Rezenthal: calories? Which is funny because I think it's actually even sweeter, may have even more sugar than
[02:01:26] Ben Gilbert: Coke does. Well, this is back in the days before sugar is vilified. Sugar is okay, fat is bad,
[02:01:32] David Rezenthal: calories are bad. But I mean, the only calories in soda come from the carbohydrate macronutrient
[02:01:41] Ben Gilbert: and specifically from sugar. And so there's a direct relationship between sugar and calories.
[02:01:48] You're assuming that consumers back in the 40s and 50s or not fall about such things?
[02:01:53] David Rezenthal: That's true. It's a great point. Yeah. Regardless of any veracity to it, they start directly
[02:02:00] David Rezenthal: trying to appeal to the light market. And then third, and maybe most importantly, we are going to
[02:02:07] David Rezenthal: wholeheartedly embrace a revolutionary new advertising medium and technology
[02:02:16] David Rezenthal: television. And we're going to use it to target the youth of America. So this is crazy. Pepsi
[02:02:25] David Rezenthal: discovers James Dean. You know, like the actor James Dean really? Yep. His very first acting job
[02:02:33] David Rezenthal: is in a 19, either 49 or 50 Pepsi commercial. Wow, I had no idea. This ultimately would morph into
[02:02:41] David Rezenthal: like the Pepsi generation, and then the choice of a new generation generation next. All the Pepsi
[02:02:46] David Rezenthal: marketing for the next 30, 40, 50 years of like we are for the young people were for the next generation.
[02:02:53] David Rezenthal: It all starts with TV and Alfred Steele in the 1950s. So all three of these things work
[02:03:00] David Rezenthal: pretty fantastically well. In addition to Steele also bringing over just generally better operational
[02:03:07] David Rezenthal: practices to Pepsi from Coke. He knows what a real professional operation is like he brings
[02:03:12] David Rezenthal: standardization and tighter controls over the bottleers. Because Pepsi had a similar or today
[02:03:18] Ben Gilbert: even still has a similar bottling system, right? Where they have bottleers outside the company.
[02:03:23] Yes, but Pepsi, at least until this point in time, never had anywhere near the same kind of
[02:03:29] David Rezenthal: operational excellence you would call it today as Coca-Cola. I mean, remember back to the 12-ounce
[02:03:33] David Rezenthal: bottles. They were using recycled beer bottles. They're putting Pepsi in beer bottles.
[02:03:39] That's what Steele's working with here. So on the back of this Pepsi's US market share
[02:03:49] David Rezenthal: jumps pretty astronomically. It's in the low 20s in the early 1950s. By 1955, it's 35% of domestic
[02:03:59] David Rezenthal: market share in America. And basically all of that is coming at the expense of Coke. I mean,
[02:04:04] David Rezenthal: Coke is still this beloved American brand. But with these three things that Steele is doing, like
[02:04:12] David Rezenthal: he starts getting a significant amount of the market. I mean, Coke's not targeting black people.
[02:04:16] David Rezenthal: Coke hasn't embraced television yet. And Coke hasn't even thought hasn't even crossed their
[02:04:22] David Rezenthal: minds about anything diet yet. That's true. And they're starting to be thought of a little,
[02:04:26] Ben Gilbert: I mean, this would happen much more in the 70s and 80s. But they're starting to be thought of
[02:04:30] Ben Gilbert: a little bit as the soda for your parents, not our soda, the cool new soda. Not the choice of a
[02:04:36] David Rezenthal: new generation band. That's right. So by the mid 50s, Woodruff, back at Coke is fine. All right.
[02:04:43] David Rezenthal: Gotta respond. We need to make a radical move of our own. He switches Coke's ad agency from Darcy,
[02:04:52] David Rezenthal: Archie Lee, the whole legacy of everything that they built from the 20s, 30s through the war
[02:04:58] David Rezenthal: to McCann Erickson, the most premium ad agency in America. Yep. And one of the first things
[02:05:06] David Rezenthal: is incredible. I found in the research that McCann does when it comes on board with the Coke account
[02:05:12] David Rezenthal: is it starts conducting scientific market research. And one of the first things they do is they run
[02:05:20] David Rezenthal: a blind taste test between Coke and Pepsi. No way. Coke runs this first internally. Coke runs
[02:05:28] David Rezenthal: this first in the late 1950s or McCann does for Coke. And guess what they find? That people prefer
[02:05:34] Ben Gilbert: Pepsi? Consumers, when presented with the two drinks, Coke and Pepsi in a blind taste test,
[02:05:42] David Rezenthal: a statistically significant number of people prefer the taste of Pepsi. Wow. I'm pretty sure Pepsi
[02:05:50] David Rezenthal: doesn't even know this yet. So McCann comes in. They've just won the account. They think this is
[02:05:55] David Rezenthal: all we found this is like a really, really important thing. They come. They present it to Woodruff.
[02:06:00] David Rezenthal: They present the findings. And his responses do not ever share this with anyone and do not ever
[02:06:08] David Rezenthal: run this test again. For Coke and Bob Woodruff, would that that would have stayed the case?
[02:06:22] It's crazy that it really doesn't bite them for 30 years. Yeah, another well, 20 years after this.
[02:06:28] David Rezenthal: For the moment, McCann does a bunch of things. One, right away, they respond to Pepsi in television.
[02:06:35] David Rezenthal: They say, hey, we got to take TV way more seriously. This is not just the future. This is the
[02:06:40] David Rezenthal: present. Is this things go bad or with Coke? Yep, they start doing TV campaigns, Jingles,
[02:06:47] David Rezenthal: Coke starts sponsoring the Mickey Mouse Club show starting in 1955. Ultimately, what McCann
[02:06:55] David Rezenthal: decides, they say, we need to unify our marketing, collateral and messaging across all of Coca-Cola's
[02:07:03] David Rezenthal: channels. We can't be having different messaging and different imagery for a TV and for point of
[02:07:10] David Rezenthal: sale and for newspapers and magazines or for radio ads. The idea is we need to have one Coca-Cola
[02:07:18] David Rezenthal: site sound and cell. It's all the same integrated campaigns. The first of which is the things go
[02:07:24] David Rezenthal: better with Coke campaign in the early 60s. I see. And then two, as we get into the back half
[02:07:29] David Rezenthal: of the 50s and the early 60s, we're now in the civil rights movement. They convince Woodruff
[02:07:33] David Rezenthal: and the company like, hey, you can't ignore the black America market. You need to market to black
[02:07:40] David Rezenthal: Americans too. So they start running ads with prominent black athletes like Jesse Owens and
[02:07:45] David Rezenthal: the Satchel page. And this is fun. Remember, we learned from Jesse Cole and our Savannah Banana
[02:07:50] David Rezenthal: conversation that the Harlem Globe Troutters should have become the MBA. At this point in time,
[02:07:55] David Rezenthal: they were like the big basketball product in America. So yeah, Coke sponsors, the Globe Troutters.
[02:08:00] David Rezenthal: And they had started a little bit before that with Willie Mays in 1952 too.
[02:08:03] Ben Gilbert: And then the last thing McCann convinces Woodruff of is, we need to take this diet thing seriously.
[02:08:11] David Rezenthal: So in 1962, they finally appealed to the diet market by launching Tab.
[02:08:18] David Rezenthal: Which is their new diet drink product that they had considered naming diet Coke. But
[02:08:28] David Rezenthal: Bob Woodruff rejected it. The given reason is supposedly he says, if God had wanted Coca-Cola to
[02:08:33] David Rezenthal: have saccharin in it, he would have made it that way in the first place. There is one Coke.
[02:08:39] Ben Gilbert: You don't want to mess with the one and only Coca-Cola. That is the state of reason.
[02:08:44] David Rezenthal: I heard rumors in the research. I couldn't confirm this, but I heard rumors that apparently
[02:08:49] David Rezenthal: the Thomas company, which is one of the two parent-bottler organizations, remember back to the
[02:08:55] David Rezenthal: perpetual contract and the parent-bottlers and all that. Supposedly, they ended up with the rights
[02:09:03] David Rezenthal: to have a 10 cent royalty per beverage on any other products that the Coca-Cola company launched
[02:09:13] David Rezenthal: that carried the Coca-Cola name. Supposedly, that is actually the real reason why they didn't
[02:09:19] David Rezenthal: call Tab Diet Coke. Whatever the reason, they launched Tab in 1962.
[02:09:24] David Rezenthal: They wanted to dip their toe in the water. They're not willing to go all in yet.
[02:09:27] Ben Gilbert: They're not willing to lend the brand that's been built over the last 80 years to a
[02:09:33] David Rezenthal: FAD diet product. Yes, exactly. Meanwhile, by that point in time, Pepsi had launched Diet Pepsi.
[02:09:40] David Rezenthal: We're doing quite well with that. Also, I got a listener's, we'll put a link in the show notes
[02:09:45] Ben Gilbert: to this. There is an astonishing ad for Tab. Oh, man, you said this to me this morning and I was like,
[02:09:53] David Rezenthal: I cannot believe this is for real. The entire ad is a man leering down kind of creepily
[02:10:01] Ben Gilbert: at this woman practicing tennis in a tennis skirt. It's this jolly sort of almost haunting
[02:10:10] Ben Gilbert: jingle. The words are, have a shape he can't forget. Tab is a taste to remember for a shape he
[02:10:17] Ben Gilbert: can't forget. When you can't be with him, be in his mind. Be a mind sticker. Don't you want to
[02:10:23] Ben Gilbert: have a good shape? He wants you to have a good shape. Why don't you keep your shape in shape?
[02:10:28] Ben Gilbert: It's great to have a good shape. Enjoy Tab and keep your shape in shape.
[02:10:33] Ben Gilbert: The 1960s. Yeah, but dude, they knew in the 1960s, 40 years before obesity sort of started
[02:10:42] Ben Gilbert: becoming a conversation that full sugar sodas were not good for your shape.
[02:10:51] David Rezenthal: Well, leave it at that. Yes. Yeah. So, you know, they do enter the diet market.
[02:10:57] Ben Gilbert: But the diet market becomes real and enduring from this point forward. Tab quickly becomes the
[02:11:02] Ben Gilbert: best selling diet soda in America. I think in the world and stays that way all the way up until
[02:11:08] Ben Gilbert: they release Diet Coke, which we'll talk about in a little bit. Yep. Tab. Recently killed actually.
[02:11:16] Ben Gilbert: Yeah. It was one of the brands that they sunset a couple of years ago. Oh, did they only kill it
[02:11:20] David Rezenthal: in 2020? I thought it was before then. Yeah. When they winnowed from like 600 brands to 200 and 2020,
[02:11:26] Ben Gilbert: that was one of the ones that caught the axe. Interesting. There's one more thing though that
[02:11:32] David Rezenthal: Coca-Cola does in response to this insurgent Pepsi challenge, shall we say, in the 50s and 60s.
[02:11:39] David Rezenthal: McDonald's. Yes. I know you have the story on this one. Yeah. So, this is actually something more
[02:11:45] Ben Gilbert: that McDonald's does and less something that Coca-Cola does. But boy, does it become important to
[02:11:49] Ben Gilbert: Coca-Cola fast to illustrate it. If we flash all the way forward today, there's a Coca-Cola
[02:11:55] Ben Gilbert: executive on the website whose entire job is the McDonald's division of the Coca-Cola company.
[02:12:03] Ben Gilbert: There is no other division dedicated to a company like this. So, what happens is Ray Crock in 1955,
[02:12:12] Ben Gilbert: one of the first things he does when he gets the expansion rights to expand McDonald's is to look
[02:12:18] Ben Gilbert: for a beverage supplier for this new Illinois location that he is opening. And he calls up Coca-Cola
[02:12:25] Ben Gilbert: and does a handshake deal that meets in person and does a handshake deal with Wadi Pratt who ran
[02:12:32] Ben Gilbert: Coke's fountain division. And from that point forward, for like 40 years, they built this deeply
[02:12:40] Ben Gilbert: entrenched relationship purely on a handshake deal. Wow. There's no contract, no turn. No. And I'm
[02:12:47] David Rezenthal: sure there is today, but for a long time, it was McDonald's isn't going to bid it out like everyone
[02:12:52] Ben Gilbert: else always does. And they're going to get like amazing preferential treatment. And here's some of
[02:12:57] Ben Gilbert: the preferential treatment that they get. Have you ever heard, David, that Coke tastes better when you
[02:13:04] Ben Gilbert: get it from McDonald's? No, but I would believe it. This is like a big thing. People like insist that
[02:13:11] Ben Gilbert: I prefer to swing by McDonald's to get a Coke versus getting it somewhere else. And if you press,
[02:13:16] Ben Gilbert: it's just that it's a fountain and you like fountain versus bottle or no, like now it's actually
[02:13:20] Ben Gilbert: better at McDonald's. It is better at McDonald's. No way. Here are a variety of things that I've heard
[02:13:27] Ben Gilbert: from somewhat credible sources and that show up in articles that may contribute to the taste actually
[02:13:34] Ben Gilbert: being better. The thing that is definitely true is Coca-Cola ships the formula to McDonald's
[02:13:40] Ben Gilbert: in stainless steel tanks instead of being delivered in bags. Normally it's bags wrapped in
[02:13:48] Ben Gilbert: cardboard. And it's actually delivered through the bottles, even though the bottles have nothing to
[02:13:52] Ben Gilbert: do with it, they are the delivery arm. Oh, yeah, because this is the fountain business. Yeah. Coke
[02:13:59] Ben Gilbert: doesn't actually deliver the surrups to all these restaurants. The bottles do it on behalf of them.
[02:14:05] Ben Gilbert: No, there's no bottles involved. So, Coca's quote unquote selling directly when they sell surrups to
[02:14:11] Ben Gilbert: fountain owners, but the bottle is doing the delivery. Yes. With McDonald's, this different. It comes
[02:14:15] Ben Gilbert: in these stainless steel tanks. McDonald's does some stuff. They pre-chill the water and they make
[02:14:21] Ben Gilbert: sure that the hoses are chilled all the way up in the dispenser. McDonald's apparently actually
[02:14:27] Ben Gilbert: has a different surrups to water ratio that accounts for ice melt. They add a little bit more surrups
[02:14:33] Ben Gilbert: than the standard recipe, which sounds like it would be heresy. Wow. And Coca-Cola lets them do it
[02:14:40] David Rezenthal: because Coca-Cola wouldn't let anybody else change the mixture. Yes. They developed custom straws
[02:14:47] Ben Gilbert: that are a little bit wider to let a little bit more Coca-Cola hate the taste buds on your mouth.
[02:14:53] Ben Gilbert: And this is sort of just incidental, but because of the volume that's done at McDonald's of selling
[02:14:58] Ben Gilbert: Coke products, the surrups a little bit fresher because the surrups actually does kind of get worse
[02:15:03] Ben Gilbert: over time if you leave it in the back room. Wow. Well, it is a beautiful partnership for both sides,
[02:15:10] David Rezenthal: shall we say? Here's something crazy. I think a lot of people associate McDonald's and Coca-Cola,
[02:15:16] Ben Gilbert: both big American companies, both historically American and a lot of Americana in each.
[02:15:21] Ben Gilbert: Until listening to this episode, I didn't really think about the fact that Coke has a 60-year
[02:15:27] Ben Gilbert: head start on McDonald's in going global. And so I read in a couple places that when McDonald's
[02:15:34] Ben Gilbert: was opening in new countries, the employees would camp in Coca-Cola offices and use Coca-Cola's
[02:15:43] Ben Gilbert: relationships to get a foothold in the country when they were opening. It's like this unofficial
[02:15:49] Ben Gilbert: partnership that they have. Well, it's good for both sides. Yeah. And lastly, Coke sales teams
[02:15:55] Ben Gilbert: are prohibited from selling surrups to restaurants for less than McDonald's pays, even if it means
[02:16:00] Ben Gilbert: they're going to lose the business to Pepsi. It is sort of this rule at Coca-Cola that no one gets
[02:16:05] Ben Gilbert: a lower price per unit volume than McDonald's. Wow. Big customer. So back to the 60s. In 1960, if
[02:16:13] Ben Gilbert: you other things happen, the first 12 ounce aluminum cans are introduced of Coca-Cola in the United
[02:16:18] Ben Gilbert: States. They also buy minute-made, right? Coca-Cola buys minute-made. Yes. A little precursor to what
[02:16:24] Ben Gilbert: was to come four decades later with non-Soda drinks. But this is sort of weirdly the only thing
[02:16:29] Ben Gilbert: that they have other than soda for a long time. Yep. Speaking of acquisitions, in 1965, Pepsi buys
[02:16:40] David Rezenthal: the Frito Lay Company. Famously. Where they're still one company today at PepsiCo. Yep. Ben, you found
[02:16:47] David Rezenthal: out Coke had the chance to buy it, right? Yes, they did. Made a giant mistake not buying it. The
[02:16:54] Ben Gilbert: company's headquarters, I think the original Lay Company, is an Atlanta company. So in many ways,
[02:17:00] Ben Gilbert: Coca-Cola is sort of the preferred buyer. And Coke turns it down. Wow. The wild thing is today,
[02:17:07] Ben Gilbert: if you look at the health of Pepsi's beverages business and their food business with Frito Lay
[02:17:12] Ben Gilbert: products, Frito Lay is a much, much better business. Well, the revenues are a little bit smaller than
[02:17:19] Ben Gilbert: the Pepsi business by revenue. Frito Lay generates twice as much profit inside the parent company,
[02:17:25] Ben Gilbert: PepsiCo. That's a good one to own. Yeah. Big mess from Coke. Yep. On the opposite end of the
[02:17:32] David Rezenthal: spectrum, toward the end of the 60s, McCann and Coke really start hitting their stride. Ben,
[02:17:40] David Rezenthal: you mentioned in the intro about co-opting the hippie and counterculture movement. Oh, yeah. In 1968,
[02:17:49] David Rezenthal: McCann and Coke launched their latest unified marketing campaign, the real thing, which is
[02:17:59] David Rezenthal: an enormous success. And at first, subtly tries to co-op the counterculture movement. It's
[02:18:06] David Rezenthal: real. The hippies. Right. I mean, it doesn't have high Frito's corn syrup yet. So ostensibly,
[02:18:11] Ben Gilbert: it is the real thing. If Coke is a real American thing, then it's the real thing. This is capped off
[02:18:17] David Rezenthal: in 1971 by the series finale of Mad Men. Yes. And Don Draper's greatest work. I was so
[02:18:27] David Rezenthal: funny. Like, I know this ad from Mad Men. Yes. Even though it's considered one of if not the greatest
[02:18:32] David Rezenthal: television commercial of all time. Yes. I didn't know anything about it until the Mad Men series
[02:18:37] David Rezenthal: finale. So listeners, if you don't know the hilltop ad. Yes. The hilltop ad to the song I'd like to
[02:18:43] Ben Gilbert: buy the world, a Coke is fictionally created or alluded to be created by Don Draper in the finale
[02:18:51] Ben Gilbert: of Mad Men. But of course, is a real ad 40 years before Mad Men came out. It's so cool. Doing the
[02:18:57] David Rezenthal: research for this episode, I always thought that Mad Men was one of the greatest works of media
[02:19:04] David Rezenthal: ever created. I have even more appreciation. They set the whole thing up all the way back in
[02:19:10] David Rezenthal: the first season of really show by introducing Mechan Ericsson. Like Mechan Ericsson comes in as a
[02:19:17] David Rezenthal: foil to Sterling Cooper in the beginning and then they're running throughout the whole series.
[02:19:22] David Rezenthal: I didn't realize that Mechan Ericsson, the reason they're so big and the reason that it's such a
[02:19:27] David Rezenthal: big thing is the Coke account. Pretty amazing. And then it all pays off in the hilltop ad.
[02:19:32] David Rezenthal: I think it's going on a little bit too much credit. If you're going to do a show about advertising
[02:19:37] Ben Gilbert: in this era, you kind of have to do Mechan Ericsson. But I didn't realize the deep connection between
[02:19:42] David Rezenthal: Mechan and Coke and how like integral that was. And so now understanding this makes me appreciate
[02:19:49] David Rezenthal: this finale just even more. It gets so great. For sure. So the story behind this ad is awesome.
[02:19:54] Ben Gilbert: So Bill Backer at Mechan Ericsson, who was sort of the big partner of Coca-Cola's there.
[02:19:58] Ben Gilbert: The Archie Lee of his day. Yes, for a long time. He said that he was on a flight that was grounded
[02:20:05] Ben Gilbert: at an airport in Ireland. And he noticed a diverse crowd of passengers and everyone's upset that
[02:20:10] Ben Gilbert: this flight isn't happening. And they're chatting and they're joking with each other. And it's
[02:20:16] Ben Gilbert: overbottles of Coca-Cola. And he's like, man, Coca-Cola really brings people together across
[02:20:21] Ben Gilbert: borders, across languages. And he jots down on an Appkin. I'd like to buy the world a Coke.
[02:20:28] Ben Gilbert: And they conceptualize this ad. And there's this whole great story of finding the songwriters
[02:20:33] Ben Gilbert: and the musicians who performed it and all this stuff. And they want to film it at the cliffs of
[02:20:38] Ben Gilbert: Dover in the UK. They got the budget greenlit from the head of advertising of Coca-Cola
[02:20:44] Ben Gilbert: to do the most expensive ad of all time, a hundred thousand dollar budget.
[02:20:50] How cool it. And they're going to film it over the course of three days. And they got there
[02:20:57] Ben Gilbert: with the full cast who were going to stand on the hillside and sing.
[02:21:01] Ben Gilbert: They wanted to have 200 people from all countries around the world. And the point is that
[02:21:06] David Rezenthal: Coca-Cola brings everybody together. It's a hard cast to assemble because you need people
[02:21:11] Ben Gilbert: representing all these different ethnicities and nationalities. And they have three straight days
[02:21:16] Ben Gilbert: of rain. I was going to say like cliffs at Dover rains a lot there. They burn through the entire
[02:21:22] Ben Gilbert: budget. And so they're like, where are we going to go? They don't rain. Let's go to Rome. And so
[02:21:27] Ben Gilbert: they get approval to go all the way up to $250,000. It rains in Rome. No. In the hills outside of
[02:21:36] Ben Gilbert: Rome. And so they actually have no usable footage from everything they shot because by the time
[02:21:41] Ben Gilbert: they actually caught the actors, they were also covered in rain and looked like crap and no one
[02:21:46] Ben Gilbert: looked happy. And so it's this hilariously cobbled together thing where the third times the charm,
[02:21:52] Ben Gilbert: they have to go wander around Rome looking for new actors. They find a new leading lady.
[02:21:57] Ben Gilbert: That woman that the commercial opens on. They actually have to film it in two separate locations.
[02:22:02] Ben Gilbert: The hillside is different from the close-ups. But they ultimately release it. It becomes
[02:22:08] Ben Gilbert: absolutely beloved. It's the catchiest tune. I've had it in my head the entire time doing research.
[02:22:14] Ben Gilbert: They start getting calls at radio stations to play the Coca-Cola ad song. So then the band goes
[02:22:21] Ben Gilbert: and re-records it as a real song to release on an album that has different lyrics than I'd like to
[02:22:26] Ben Gilbert: buy the world a coke. And it turns out to become a best-selling song also. So great.
[02:22:31] The lyrics are just great. They're great. And it's so 1971 and Coca-Cola.
[02:22:37] David Rezenthal: It's the real thing. Yeah. I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I'd like to buy
[02:22:43] David Rezenthal: the world a coke and keep it company. That's the real thing what the world wants today. Is it the
[02:22:49] David Rezenthal: real thing? And you're watching it and it does actually stir up emotions. You're like, this is
[02:22:54] Ben Gilbert: really beautiful. Look at this. There's all these people that are all here together. They're all
[02:22:58] Ben Gilbert: getting along. And then you realize this is a giant corporation selling sugar water. And they managed
[02:23:06] Ben Gilbert: to borrow the hippie movement to create one of the most successful commercials of all time. Oh my god.
[02:23:12] David Rezenthal: It's madman. Unbelievable. Don Draper, baby. Yeah. So great. Well, so the end of the 60s and the
[02:23:23] David Rezenthal: early 70s going pretty well for Coca-Cola. And then in 1975 that deep, dark, deeply embarrassing
[02:23:35] David Rezenthal: secret that McCann had discovered 20 years earlier in 1955 and Robert Woodruff had tried to
[02:23:43] David Rezenthal: bury as far down as he possibly could comes out the Pepsi challenge. But before we tell that story,
[02:23:53] David Rezenthal: now is a great time to thank one of our favorite partners, Century. Yes. That's S-E-N-T-R-Y,
[02:24:01] Ben Gilbert: like someone's standing guard. So Century, as you know by now, does application performance
[02:24:06] David Rezenthal: monitoring, helping developers debug everything from errors to latency to performance issues,
[02:24:11] David Rezenthal: basically any software problem. And they do it excellently. Over 150,000 teams use it every day
[02:24:18] David Rezenthal: from Disney to Anthropic to Epic Games. Today, though, we want to talk about the Century
[02:24:23] Ben Gilbert: community, which is awesome. We just did an event with them last month in San Francisco. And it was
[02:24:28] Ben Gilbert: so cool to see how many great folks use Century and how much they love this company. Yep. Michael
[02:24:34] David Rezenthal: Truel, the CEO of cursor, was there. He did a great fireside chat with centuries founder David Kramer.
[02:24:39] David Rezenthal: And mentioned to me that his favorite acquired episode is PowerPoint. So Michael, thank you for
[02:24:45] Ben Gilbert: listening to the old stuff. The only person we've ever met who told us that their favorite
[02:24:50] David Rezenthal: episodes PowerPoint. Yes. A bunch of our friends from Anthropic were there in Sierra and Versel.
[02:24:57] David Rezenthal: All of those are Century customers, by the way. And then my favorite part of the night was we got
[02:25:01] David Rezenthal: to interview Jess Smith, the president of the Golden State Valkyries, the new WMBA team here in San
[02:25:07] David Rezenthal: Francisco, which in just one season has gone from zero to the most valuable women's sport franchise
[02:25:14] David Rezenthal: in the world. Jess and the Valkyries are just awesome. It was so fun. Yeah. And Claire Vaux,
[02:25:19] Ben Gilbert: with a founder of chat PRD interviewed David and I on stage. The whole night was awesome and just
[02:25:24] Ben Gilbert: showed how wide centuries world really is from startups to AI giants to pro sports teams to indie
[02:25:30] Ben Gilbert: developers. Century just rocks were very happy to be partners with them. Speaking of rocks,
[02:25:36] David Rezenthal: Century created perhaps the most awesome acquired swag ever for this event. These guys get it.
[02:25:42] Ben Gilbert: These guys totally get it. They made custom 1980s Walkman style cassette players throw back to
[02:25:50] David Rezenthal: our Sony episode. Yep. That's right. Acquired branded complete with an actual cassette containing some
[02:25:58] David Rezenthal: of our favorite acquired moments from the show over the years. They made a hundred extras just
[02:26:06] David Rezenthal: for the rest of the acquired community. So go grab one right now from the link in the show notes.
[02:26:13] David Rezenthal: I think these are going to last about five minutes, but there's a link in the show notes
[02:26:17] David Rezenthal: to go get one of these Walkman style cassette players. They're awesome. Yeah.
[02:26:21] David Rezenthal: So our huge thanks to Century for being such great partners and hosting really an incredible night.
[02:26:26] Ben Gilbert: If you want to join the hundred and fifty thousand teams including linear Cloudflare GitHub,
[02:26:32] Ben Gilbert: Instacart and Atlassian who rely on Century to keep their software running smoothly,
[02:26:36] Ben Gilbert: head on over to century.io slash acquired. That's scntry.io slash acquired and just tell them
[02:26:43] Ben Gilbert: that Ben and David sent you. All right, David, the Pepsi challenge. I've been so stoked all
[02:26:50] David Rezenthal: episodes just to get to this and to start it off. Are you about to do a Pepsi challenge?
[02:26:55] Ben Gilbert: I am going to do a Pepsi challenge right here on air. Of course, it's not really a challenge because
[02:27:01] David Rezenthal: I didn't hide the containers that I would administer it to myself. So it wouldn't work.
[02:27:05] David Rezenthal: What temperature are they though? Because I hear that plays a big role. It does, but they are
[02:27:10] David Rezenthal: the same temperature. I took both of them out of the fridge right after like World War Two or so.
[02:27:15] David Rezenthal: So however long ago that was because at warmer temperatures, the Coke people will insist that Pepsi
[02:27:21] Ben Gilbert: has the edge because sweeter tastes better in warmer temperatures. But Coke at that just above
[02:27:26] Ben Gilbert: freezing, perfect temperature is the best. Well, let's see. All right, that's the real thing.
[02:27:33] Ben Gilbert: See you right now. All right, the real thing. It's good.
[02:27:38] David Rezenthal: Oh, Pepsi home. Oh, it's got that lemony little zest to it. Pepsi's a little little lemony, a little
[02:27:44] Ben Gilbert: sweeter. I think I'm with the majority on this one. That Pepsi is better. I think Pepsi tastes a little
[02:27:54] David Rezenthal: better. Wow. David Rosenthal right here on the Coca-Cola episode declaring that Pepsi is your
[02:28:00] Ben Gilbert: pick. Well, over Coca-Cola classic, but I'm mostly a Diet Coke guy these days, but we'll get to
[02:28:06] David Rezenthal: that in a minute, which one could argue was formulated to better compete with Pepsi. Indeed.
[02:28:13] David Rezenthal: All right, the Pepsi challenge. So back in 1967, a young,
[02:28:22] David Rezenthal: Wharton MBA graduate joins Pepsi after a few years of working at IPG, the big ad agency which
[02:28:33] David Rezenthal: owned and I believe still owns Mechanarexan, parent company and Mechan. Yep, they do.
[02:28:37] Ben Gilbert: Inter-public group. Now Ben, I know you know who we're talking about here, but listeners,
[02:28:44] David Rezenthal: you all are in for a real fun surprise when we reveal who this person is in a minute.
[02:28:50] David Rezenthal: So Pepsi, as we've discussed, up until Alfred Steele came in, had always been kind of a
[02:28:58] David Rezenthal: seat of the pants school of hard-knock's management type company. This person who joins I think
[02:29:04] David Rezenthal: might have been the first MBA to join the company and he was one of the very few even like college
[02:29:09] David Rezenthal: graduates. So he comes in as the director of new product development and the first new product
[02:29:17] David Rezenthal: that he develops and hits the market isn't a new drink, but rather a new bottle, a really,
[02:29:25] David Rezenthal: really big bottle. 64 ounces. He realizes in doing market research that, hey, supermarkets are
[02:29:31] David Rezenthal: becoming more and more of a thing. We're now in the late 60s, early 70s here. There's a really
[02:29:37] David Rezenthal: underserved part of the soft drink market, which is large families and parties for at-home
[02:29:46] David Rezenthal: consumption, buying a whole bunch of pretty heavy, breakable glass bottles and lugging them home
[02:29:52] David Rezenthal: for your large family or a party that you're throwing. Or even cans who wants to open a single
[02:29:57] Ben Gilbert: can for each person around the dinner table. Totally. And again, remember what we talked about,
[02:30:02] David Rezenthal: the cost-scaling element of soda is not volume of soda. So it doesn't actually cost that much to
[02:30:12] David Rezenthal: go from six and a half ounces to 12 ounces to a whole lot of ounces. This is why basically anyone
[02:30:18] Ben Gilbert: is willing to sell you free refills on your fountain drink. Yep. So he and Pepsi start working on a
[02:30:25] David Rezenthal: big bottle. And they pretty quickly realize like, oh, glass is not going to work.
[02:30:31] David Rezenthal: That would be a really heavy bottle and really breakable as you're pouring around this big bottle.
[02:30:37] David Rezenthal: So they go to DuPont. Hmm. I had no idea. And say, hey, can you guys engineer us something that
[02:30:46] David Rezenthal: would work here? And DuPont says, oh, well, actually, you have found us at the perfect
[02:30:50] David Rezenthal: point in time. We have a new type of plastic that we have engineered polyethylene
[02:30:55] David Rezenthal: terapithylate or PET that we think would be great for this application. It's lightweight. It's super
[02:31:04] David Rezenthal: strong. It's really cheap to produce. And here's the kicker for Pepsi. We can send it pre-molded
[02:31:13] David Rezenthal: to all of your bottles. And so rather than your bottleers having to set up really expensive new
[02:31:18] David Rezenthal: production lines for these new bottles, all they have to do is just inflate the molds with air
[02:31:23] David Rezenthal: and then fill them up. Have you ever seen them inflate? It's like the coolest thing ever watching
[02:31:27] Ben Gilbert: a two-liter bottle inflate. The 64 ounce or now two-liter bottle is born. Pepsi gets a big jump on
[02:31:34] David Rezenthal: this against Coke. It takes Coke another three and a half years to come out with their own big
[02:31:39] David Rezenthal: party bottle. So on the back of this success for this young executive. And you talk to him,
[02:31:45] Ben Gilbert: right? This person you're talking about? Oh yes. All these stories are first hand. Okay.
[02:31:49] David Rezenthal: So on the back of this success, Don Kendall, the density of Pepsi is like, all right,
[02:31:54] David Rezenthal: you passed the test. You're ready for your next big job. And this is the first time that plastic
[02:32:00] Ben Gilbert: is used right in soft drinks. Oh yes. I missed the punchline there. This is the first plastic bottle.
[02:32:06] David Rezenthal: That's crazy. And good for Pepsi to log this win. Pretty bad for the world to start this
[02:32:12] Ben Gilbert: single-use plastics treadmill that we're all on now. Like just to get that out of the way,
[02:32:17] Ben Gilbert: I was looking up studies recently. And the Coca-Cola company is the number one polluter globally
[02:32:23] Ben Gilbert: of crap in the ocean. Pepsi's very close behind all the big drink companies. Everyone is always
[02:32:29] Ben Gilbert: saying we're trying to do a better job at this. We're trying to do a better job creating
[02:32:32] Ben Gilbert: recyclable stuff using recycle, but like the world is full of a crap ton of single-use plastics.
[02:32:38] Ben Gilbert: 100%. Man, I had not focused on this issue at all until doing the research. I am going to only
[02:32:47] David Rezenthal: buy can and glass bottles going forward. Like there's no reason not to buy cans and glass.
[02:32:54] David Rezenthal: They're actually recyclable. It's funny. I've accidentally started doing that anyway,
[02:32:58] Ben Gilbert: because whenever I travel, now I use those path water bottles that they sell in airports and you can
[02:33:04] Ben Gilbert: refill them. I'm not like going out of my way to be like, oh my gosh, I need the metal over the
[02:33:09] Ben Gilbert: plastic, but like it now it just feels weird to buy plastic bottles. Now that I'm so much more
[02:33:15] Ben Gilbert: attuned to microplastics, I'm also never going to drink fluid that was sitting in a plastic bottle
[02:33:21] Ben Gilbert: for a long time after I opened it or like refill it. I used to refill plastic water bottles. And now I'm
[02:33:25] Ben Gilbert: like, uh, who knows what's degrading in my beverage. So, but yeah, this is the start of the
[02:33:30] Ben Gilbert: classification. Yes. So back to the timeline. Don Kendall, the CEO is like, okay, you pass the test.
[02:33:39] David Rezenthal: You are now going to take over all of marketing for Pepsi. And I want you to figure out how we're going
[02:33:45] David Rezenthal: to dethrone Coke. So the executive takes over marketing. He's getting settled in. He's surveying
[02:33:51] David Rezenthal: the current state of things. And he notices that the local Pepsi bottleer down in Dallas, Texas
[02:33:59] David Rezenthal: is doing something really interesting. The local ad agency for the bottleer there
[02:34:04] David Rezenthal: had accidentally discovered the secret that Coke and McCann has known for 20 years
[02:34:11] David Rezenthal: that consumers prefer Pepsi to Coke. And the way they figure it out is that they're doing research
[02:34:18] David Rezenthal: for 7-11 in Dallas. No way. And 7-11 is selling a generic cola at the time. And they were on a
[02:34:26] David Rezenthal: taste test with both Coke and Pepsi as the controls for the 7-11 in their cola. And so this local
[02:34:35] David Rezenthal: agency happens to also be the agency of the Pepsi bottleer in Dallas. And so they go to the Pepsi
[02:34:40] David Rezenthal: bottle and they're like, hey, guess what we discovered? Wow. So locally in the Dallas market,
[02:34:48] David Rezenthal: they start running these commercials there of people taking the quote unquote Pepsi challenge.
[02:34:55] David Rezenthal: They roll up to a supermarket in Dallas. They plunk down a card table and they have Coke and Pepsi
[02:35:02] David Rezenthal: behind like a cardboard screen. And then they give the consumers a glass. They say, which do you
[02:35:07] David Rezenthal: prefer? And statistically significant number of people say Pepsi. And they did this at malls
[02:35:14] Ben Gilbert: all across America. They then really expanded this. Well, we'll get to that. Now, yeah, at first,
[02:35:19] David Rezenthal: this is just the local Dallas bottleer that's doing it. It's a huge success. Pepsi's market share
[02:35:25] David Rezenthal: in Dallas jumps by 14% thanks to these ads. Like it really, really resonates with consumers.
[02:35:34] David Rezenthal: So the new VP of marketing sees this. And he's like, oh, okay, we got to blow this out. But
[02:35:40] David Rezenthal: we're not going to do what Coke would do. We're not going to turn this into like a big corporate one
[02:35:47] David Rezenthal: site one sound one cell national campaign. We got to keep this grassroots. We got to go market
[02:35:54] David Rezenthal: by market. This is working so well in Dallas because it's grassroots because it's real people
[02:35:59] David Rezenthal: who are living in Dallas taking this challenge. And the technology that can enable this has just come
[02:36:07] David Rezenthal: out. VCRs have come out and early home video camcorders are just starting to hit the market.
[02:36:15] David Rezenthal: So he says, okay, here's what we're going to do. We're going to go buy a ton of home video camcorders.
[02:36:23] David Rezenthal: Oh, that's awesome. And card tables. We're going to distribute them to all of Pepsi's local
[02:36:29] David Rezenthal: bottles all around the country. We're going to inform them about the Pepsi challenge. And we're
[02:36:35] David Rezenthal: going to say go run your own versions of the Pepsi challenge. Oh, wow. Film them with the camcorders
[02:36:42] David Rezenthal: of real people in your markets taking the Pepsi challenge and put them on local television.
[02:36:49] David Rezenthal: Like local ad spots on local TV channels. And this is like maybe the most successful grassroots
[02:36:56] David Rezenthal: marketing campaign in history. I didn't even realize it was grassroots. I mean, everyone knows
[02:37:01] Ben Gilbert: the Pepsi challenge is almost like a descriptive way to describe a form of marketing. Like,
[02:37:06] Ben Gilbert: do you remember when Microsoft did bang it on? It was like, Oh, I see the Pepsi challenge for
[02:37:10] Ben Gilbert: search. I had no idea until talking to him and doing the research. This was all shot with camcorders.
[02:37:17] David Rezenthal: We'll link to YouTube footage of these old videos. It's all just malls and supermarkets and beaches
[02:37:24] David Rezenthal: and fire stations around the country. And it's then local ads running on local TVs. Incredible.
[02:37:31] David Rezenthal: Which is funny. Being our age, David, I knew what the Pepsi challenge was. But of course,
[02:37:36] Ben Gilbert: I've never actually seen it. Right. I hadn't seen it either. And it's funny to now actually go
[02:37:40] Ben Gilbert: watch it and see how that meets my expectations of what I thought it was going to be.
[02:37:43] Ben Gilbert: Yes. Same as you. I had the same expectations of, oh, this must have been like a BBO national campaign,
[02:37:50] David Rezenthal: you know, blah, blah, blah, total opposite. This is probably the first quote unquote reality
[02:37:58] David Rezenthal: television commercial that's ever produced. Like nobody was doing this back in the day.
[02:38:03] David Rezenthal: So it just hits all these local markets around the country like a bomb. And Coke is so
[02:38:09] David Rezenthal: poorly set up to react to this. Their whole marketing and ad strategy with McCann,
[02:38:14] David Rezenthal: they're all national. One site, one sound, you know, one cell, they're not set up to go by local
[02:38:22] David Rezenthal: TV ads slots. It's good counter-positioning. But the punch line of the whole thing is
[02:38:27] Ben Gilbert: it wouldn't have worked if it wasn't true, but it was true that people did prefer the taste of
[02:38:32] Ben Gilbert: Pepsi. And I think it also wouldn't have worked if it had been a big national, you know,
[02:38:38] David Rezenthal: sort of corporate rollout because people wouldn't have believed that it's true. I think it's really
[02:38:42] David Rezenthal: critical that it was real people that were doing the Pepsi challenge instead of actors. Yes.
[02:38:48] Ben Gilbert: Oh, absolutely. I agree. And I think it was also important. It's happening in my community.
[02:38:53] Right. So they blow this out like all across the country. In 1977, Pepsi outspends Coke
[02:39:00] David Rezenthal: in advertising for the first time in history. And Pepsi actually passes Coke in market share
[02:39:09] David Rezenthal: in the bottled market. So Coke still has an overall market share lead in the country
[02:39:15] David Rezenthal: because of the fountain business and like McDonald's. Right. Pepsi basically never was able to
[02:39:19] Ben Gilbert: break into the fountain business and the volumes that even today Coke kind of ran away with the
[02:39:25] Ben Gilbert: restaurant serving soft drinks out of fountains business. So it's actually in the late 70s Pepsi
[02:39:30] David Rezenthal: does try to break in they buy Taco Bell and Pizza Hut and KFC and then install Pepsi. But yeah,
[02:39:37] David Rezenthal: I'd never approach his Coke, which actually kind of backfires because then Coke uses it to counter
[02:39:42] Ben Gilbert: sell and they start going around to everyone else that is considering Coke or Pepsi and saying Pepsi
[02:39:47] Ben Gilbert: owns these restaurants that are competing with you. Why do you want to give them more profit dollars?
[02:39:51] Ben Gilbert: And so then Coke is able to win sales on that, which is I think it's part of why Pepsi then
[02:39:55] Ben Gilbert: spun that all out as young brands, but also just kind of because I think it was a drag on their
[02:39:59] Ben Gilbert: business. Yep. So on the back of this huge nationally known obvious success with the Pepsi
[02:40:10] David Rezenthal: challenge, the young marketing executive starts to become pretty known in the business community.
[02:40:15] David Rezenthal: And David, we should say who it is now. His name is John Scully. Yep. And for some of you,
[02:40:23] Ben Gilbert: that will mean a lot. And for most of you, that will mean a lot in about 30 seconds.
[02:40:28] Ben Gilbert: John starts getting a bunch of CEO offers coming in from recruiters on the back of his success.
[02:40:37] David Rezenthal: And he loves Pepsi. He's built his career there. But finally, in 1983, he gets an offer that he can't
[02:40:46] David Rezenthal: refuse. Steve Jobs comes to pitch him and says, do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your
[02:40:55] David Rezenthal: life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world? And he goes with Steve and joins Apple
[02:41:04] David Rezenthal: computer as CEO in 1983. Yeah. And finish the story, David. What would then happen after John
[02:41:13] Ben Gilbert: became CEO of Apple? Well, I think the narrative that a lot of people know of to save this for our
[02:41:19] David Rezenthal: Apple episode someday is things did not go well. Steve Jobs got kicked out of the company.
[02:41:25] David Rezenthal: Apple floundered jobs had to come back. Scully actually grew Apple's revenue from under 1 billion when
[02:41:32] David Rezenthal: he joined to almost 8 billion when he left. Tim Cook before Tim Cook. And then there would be
[02:41:39] David Rezenthal: two more CEOs, I think, before jobs came back. Gil Emileo and Michael Spindler. That's right.
[02:41:46] David Rezenthal: But yeah, John is awesome. By the way, he's 87 years old. He's a huge acquired fan. He's listened
[02:41:53] David Rezenthal: to every single episode that we've done. Also, thank you to Arvind Navarot. Now I'm in front of the
[02:41:58] Ben Gilbert: show for introducing us. That was a fun email to get. I'm like, wait, John Scully listens to
[02:42:03] Ben Gilbert: acquired. Yeah. So cool. He's currently on the board of three different companies that he's helped
[02:42:07] David Rezenthal: start over the last couple of years. And he's responsible for the Pepsi challenge. So obviously,
[02:42:15] David Rezenthal: Coke eventually after years and years of bleeding, thanks to the Pepsi challenge, decides that they
[02:42:22] David Rezenthal: need to respond. And the response ends up happening a full decade later. The response comes in 1985.
[02:42:31] Ben Gilbert: And the Pepsi challenge was in 75. And Pepsi had already been taking share from Coke starting in
[02:42:37] Ben Gilbert: like 1970, meaningful chunks. Yeah. So why is Coke so slow to respond to the Pepsi challenge? Well,
[02:42:46] David Rezenthal: in addition to just plain getting their ass kicked, they have another problem. So Woodruff is still
[02:42:53] David Rezenthal: the ultimate decision maker and chairman of the board. But he's getting pretty old at this point
[02:43:00] David Rezenthal: in time. He's already in his 80s, approaching his 90s. He has strong opinions about what Coca-Cola
[02:43:06] Ben Gilbert: isn't. But there's also another management problem at Coca-Cola, which is that the CEO, Paul
[02:43:15] David Rezenthal: Austin, has gotten Alzheimer's and stays in the CEO position. And so Coke for the back half of the 70s
[02:43:26] David Rezenthal: is just paralyzed. Like basically, no decisions can get through between Woodruff being set in his
[02:43:33] David Rezenthal: ways. And it's hard for him to see, read here. I mean, it's hard to communicate with in addition
[02:43:42] Ben Gilbert: with having strong opinions and control of the company. Yep. And then you have a CEO suffering
[02:43:47] David Rezenthal: from Alzheimer's. And Woodruff probably doesn't recognize what's happening. It's a real mess. Yep.
[02:43:53] Ben Gilbert: All of this finally resolves in May of 1980 when the board appoints a young chemical engineer named
[02:44:03] David Rezenthal: Roberto Gosweta as CEO. So Gosweta was a Cuban immigrant who had worked his way up to become
[02:44:12] David Rezenthal: head of technical research at age 35. And he was one of the mythical two people who knew the secret
[02:44:19] David Rezenthal: formula. That's right. Because he was a chemical engineer. I mean, he was on the product formulation
[02:44:26] Ben Gilbert: side of things. Yep. And he had just had a huge win within the company when he replaced sugar
[02:44:35] David Rezenthal: in the US with high fructose corn syrup. He's the one who brought corn syrup in. So starting in 1980,
[02:44:41] Ben Gilbert: he got 50% and then by 1984, they were replaced at 100%. But basically because sugar kept getting
[02:44:48] Ben Gilbert: more expensive and farm subsidies for corn kept making half rucos corn syrup less expensive,
[02:44:53] Ben Gilbert: it became like all as long as customers are willing to do it. And it doesn't seem to be worse for
[02:44:58] Ben Gilbert: people's health economically. It became a no brainer to do it. Yep. So he's a real dark horse candidate
[02:45:06] David Rezenthal: to be CEO. The person who everybody thinks is going to get the job is Don Kio, the famous longtime
[02:45:13] David Rezenthal: president and COO of Coca-Cola. And so what Roberto does when he becomes CEO is he says, Don,
[02:45:19] David Rezenthal: you are my partner in crime. We are going to run this company as a team. You'll be my president
[02:45:24] David Rezenthal: and COO. You are great externally. I'm great with the product and in the strategy internally,
[02:45:31] David Rezenthal: we're going to be a dynamic duo here. And ultimately, it goes what I got it because he was
[02:45:37] Ben Gilbert: Woodruff's protege. I would say, go sweat at least as it comes across in the book secret formula,
[02:45:43] Ben Gilbert: did a very good job of sort of managing up and making sure that Woodruff felt taken care of and
[02:45:48] Ben Gilbert: informed. I could see that. Yep. So they go on to have a great run. One of the early things they do
[02:45:55] David Rezenthal: is they buy Columbia Pictures, the movie studio, which I always thought this was stupid. Like,
[02:46:03] Ben Gilbert: whenever you hear stories of, oh, and at one point in the, cooked out 1980s where everyone was
[02:46:10] Ben Gilbert: doing crazy stuff, Coke even went and bought Columbia Pictures. A movie studio. But financially,
[02:46:17] Ben Gilbert: it actually was great for them, even though no business is as good as Coca-Cola's core business.
[02:46:23] Ben Gilbert: Everything pales in comparison unless it's Visa or a software company or something like that.
[02:46:28] Ben Gilbert: Well, not only was it financially pretty good for them when they ultimately sold the business to
[02:46:34] David Rezenthal: Sony a few years later, it leads to a lot of really good stuff for Coca-Cola. Because this is how
[02:46:42] David Rezenthal: they get to know Herbal and Junior and Allen and Company, who was one of the principal
[02:46:48] David Rezenthal: shareholders of Columbia Pictures before Coke bought it. And so he ends up joining the board of Coca-Cola
[02:46:55] David Rezenthal: after the transaction. And actually, this relationship continues right through to this day. Herbal
[02:47:00] David Rezenthal: and the third who in the early 2000s took over for Herb Junior running Allen and Company is still
[02:47:07] David Rezenthal: on the board of Coca-Cola. Amazing. So this is how Coca-Cola executives start going to
[02:47:15] David Rezenthal: Sun Valley, where Dan Kio reconnects from his old neighbor from his early young professional days
[02:47:25] David Rezenthal: when he was working in his first job in Omaha, Nebraska, living on Farnham Street in Omaha,
[02:47:35] David Rezenthal: where he was neighbors with Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett is like this real life
[02:47:42] Ben Gilbert: forest gump. I mean, the number of things that he invested in that would become these
[02:47:48] Ben Gilbert: unbelievable bananza investments, like greatest of all time investments, always a guy who lived
[02:47:53] Ben Gilbert: in my street. Oh, was the woman that ran the furniture store in my town growing up?
[02:47:58] Ben Gilbert: I like it happens over and over and over again. Are you kidding me? Dan Kio was Warren Buffett's
[02:48:04] Ben Gilbert: old neighbor? Dan's first job out of college. He worked for, I believe, a coffee company that ended
[02:48:12] David Rezenthal: up getting acquired by Coca-Cola. And that's how he came into Coca-Cola. But yeah, he was just
[02:48:17] David Rezenthal: living in Omaha, on Farnham Street. Crazy. And so this is how the Berkshire Coca-Cola relationship
[02:48:24] Ben Gilbert: starts. Well, so Warren, at this point in time, as we covered on our Berkshire series,
[02:48:32] David Rezenthal: is a Pepsi guy. He's part of the new generation. He took the Pepsi challenge. Kio converts him
[02:48:41] David Rezenthal: to Coke by telling him about this new product that they're going to launch,
[02:48:45] David Rezenthal: Cherry Coke, because Buffett loved Cherry's here up in his Pepsi. And so he converts Warren
[02:48:50] David Rezenthal: to a Coke guy before Warren ever invests a dollar in the Coca-Cola company. And Warren reportedly
[02:48:56] Ben Gilbert: drinks five cherry Cokes a day. Yeah. He is perhaps single-handedly supporting his investment.
[02:49:04] David Rezenthal: Later on at Sun Valley Bill Gates lets it slip on a panel with Warren and Roberto and Dan Kio,
[02:49:14] David Rezenthal: that Warren has always told Bill that Coca-Cola could be run by a ham sandwich.
[02:49:21] Ben Gilbert: While Roberto is sitting right there, yeah, Roberto gets very offended and apparently never talks to
[02:49:26] David Rezenthal: Bill Gates again. Now, given what's about to happen here, it's actually highly debatable whether
[02:49:32] David Rezenthal: Roberto was a ham sandwich or not. My opinion has always been that Coca-Cola is the type of business
[02:49:39] Ben Gilbert: that can be run. But maybe let's save this for the quintessence. Like we should finish the
[02:49:43] Ben Gilbert: episode deciding if that is true about the Coca-Cola company or not. Yes. Well,
[02:49:50] David Rezenthal: Roberto is about to become responsible for both the company's greatest success since Coca-Cola
[02:49:58] David Rezenthal: and its worst disaster of all time. Yes. Okay. So first, the success. Of course, we're talking about
[02:50:06] David Rezenthal: the most successful diet drink in the history of humankind. Basically the only soda that I drink
[02:50:12] David Rezenthal: today, Diet Coke. You're a Diet Coke man, not a Coke Zero man. I'm a Diet Coke guy. Yeah, I know
[02:50:18] David Rezenthal: Coke Zero was sort of marketed as the Diet Coke for men, but like that Coke. And not just for men,
[02:50:26] Ben Gilbert: but also the one that's closer to the original Coca-Cola formula. Diet Coke is sort of meant to be
[02:50:31] Ben Gilbert: its own thing. Yeah, they did those great ads of the Taste Infringement ads. Do you remember those?
[02:50:36] David Rezenthal: Oh, I don't remember them. Oh, yeah, yeah. When Coke Zero launched, they did all this series of ads
[02:50:41] David Rezenthal: of Coca-Cola lawyers going around suing Coke Zero for Taste Infringement. Great premise.
[02:50:48] David Rezenthal: Great sort of self-reflective advertising from Coca-Cola there. So Diet Coke is fascinating because
[02:50:57] Ben Gilbert: they did start work on it earlier in the 70s. It didn't come out till 1982, but they're kind of in
[02:51:03] Ben Gilbert: the lab tinkering with the flavor because the Pepsi challenge has basically thrown down the
[02:51:08] Ben Gilbert: continent that Americans prefer the taste of Pepsi. And they're starting to play with this idea of like,
[02:51:13] Ben Gilbert: okay, obviously we're not going to replace Coke, but like, is there a way that we can make
[02:51:19] Ben Gilbert: something that does compete with Pepsi that tastes a little bit more like Pepsi that tastes
[02:51:24] Ben Gilbert: lighter or sweeter or they're in the lab. They're working on it. And eventually they do land on
[02:51:31] Ben Gilbert: this formula that they think is great. And it's artificially sweetened as you're talking about.
[02:51:36] Ben Gilbert: It is a huge risk in two ways to release Diet Coke. One is because of everything we talked
[02:51:44] Ben Gilbert: about earlier, you got to be really careful with the Coca-Cola brand. It's the sacred cow.
[02:51:50] Ben Gilbert: But two, tab is currently in 1982 the best selling Diet drink in the world. So why would you
[02:51:58] Ben Gilbert: release another Diet drink that risks dethroning the one that you have that is the clear winner?
[02:52:04] And the answer is you need a win. A, you need a win. B, it is so clear that Diet is going to be a
[02:52:11] Ben Gilbert: gigantic market. And that's the way the world is going. And we're just holding ourselves back
[02:52:15] Ben Gilbert: from competing with our best foot forward by not using our big brand. Yep.
[02:52:21] David Rezenthal: There was one other reason why they finally decided in the late 70s to start work on Diet Coke.
[02:52:29] Ben Gilbert: In 1975, the Coca-Cola company acquired the Thomas company.
[02:52:37] David Rezenthal: So to the extent that the Thomas company and the parent bottlers, if it is true that they had a
[02:52:43] David Rezenthal: right to a tense and royalty on other Coca-Cola drinks, that is no longer a problem. Fascinating.
[02:52:49] Ben Gilbert: So David, do you know about how they announced Diet Coke?
[02:52:53] David Rezenthal: I was going to ask you the same thing. I thought I was going to get you. Of course I do.
[02:52:58] David Rezenthal: I'd be surprised if any listeners know, but listeners, you are going to delight in learning this
[02:53:04] Ben Gilbert: with us. They announced Diet Coke in the summer of 1982. In July of 1982. The same month.
[02:53:12] Ben Gilbert: That's right. 43 years before? 43 years before us. A very special location in the acquired
[02:53:21] David Rezenthal: cinematic universe, Radio City musical. That's right. Diet Coke was announced on stage with
[02:53:29] Ben Gilbert: the Rockets performing to celebrate the New Beverage. That's right. To say it works is quite the
[02:53:36] David Rezenthal: understatement. By the end of 1983, the first full year on the market, Diet Coke is the number one
[02:53:43] David Rezenthal: Diet Drink in America. Unlike Tab, which clearly from that commercial that you talked about
[02:53:51] David Rezenthal: earlier, was exclusively marketed to women. 30% of Diet Coke drinkers, even in the early days,
[02:53:59] David Rezenthal: are men. By 1984, Diet Coke becomes the third best-selling soft drink in America, period
[02:54:09] David Rezenthal: behind Coke and Pepsi. Diet Coke costs significantly less for a coke to produce because it
[02:54:16] David Rezenthal: doesn't have sugar. You know what's not as expensive? Artificial sweeteners. Yes. Diet Coke
[02:54:23] David Rezenthal: goes to sweat as huge, huge grand slam win. The way they market it is not apologetic. The campaign
[02:54:31] Ben Gilbert: is just for the taste of it. They are full on marketing that this tastes great. It also happens to
[02:54:38] Ben Gilbert: have no calories. This is Coca-Cola playing offense. Win-win. It works incredibly well. You can
[02:54:46] David Rezenthal: have your Coke and drink it too. That's right. And then, goes sweat as decides to play
[02:54:55] David Rezenthal: defense. Yeah. With New Coke. So, despite all the success of Diet Coke, and it was a huge success,
[02:55:06] David Rezenthal: even in 1982, 83, 84, 10-ish years into the Pepsi challenge, it's still kicking Coca-Cola's ass.
[02:55:20] David Rezenthal: Coke in 1982 brought in Bill Cosby as their main celebrity indoor sereness, right? And we'll also
[02:55:28] David Rezenthal: link to these in the show notes. The spots that they have him do in 82, 83, 84 are direct
[02:55:35] David Rezenthal: addressing the Pepsi challenge. It's unbelievable. Coca-Cola is a singular and of one product. Coca-Cola
[02:55:41] David Rezenthal: does not exist in a universe with other competitors. And here's Bill Cosby directly talking about Pepsi
[02:55:49] David Rezenthal: and the challenge. It's the worst thing that Coca-Cola could possibly do. They were in bad shape.
[02:55:54] Ben Gilbert: They are bleeding. And Pepsi, of course, in typical Pepsi fashion, says, oh, you just signed Bill Cosby
[02:56:01] David Rezenthal: and you're talking about the Pepsi challenge in your spots. We're going to sign Michael Jackson.
[02:56:07] Just brutal. Obviously, both of those men, the world would later find out, or deeply problematic. But
[02:56:16] David Rezenthal: at the time, I think they had among, if not the highest curatings of any celebrity in the world,
[02:56:24] David Rezenthal: a curating being percentage of people surveyed who are familiar with the person and think highly of
[02:56:29] David Rezenthal: them. Yeah. But from the time that Pepsi launched the Pepsi challenge in 1975 until the new Coke
[02:56:37] David Rezenthal: disaster in 1985, the share of Pepsi grew every single year in America while the share of Coca-Cola
[02:56:44] David Rezenthal: declined every single year. And so the question is, if you're Coca-Cola, what do you do here?
[02:56:49] Ben Gilbert: What they decided to do was after 99 years, with the same formula, carefully building a brand
[02:56:57] Ben Gilbert: around that logo that tastes the secret formula and defining this cultural object to the world,
[02:57:06] Ben Gilbert: stupidity struck. And yes, we can't downplay how stupid this really was. But somewhat in their
[02:57:15] David Rezenthal: defense, if you're going to introduce a new taste to try and counter the Pepsi taste, which you
[02:57:24] David Rezenthal: believe is the reason why you're losing market share, it has to be a full replacement.
[02:57:30] David Rezenthal: There actually is no logical path to adding a new flavor. So a bunch of people are like, well,
[02:57:35] David Rezenthal: why didn't they just release Coke too or something like that? Remember Coke is a singular product.
[02:57:41] David Rezenthal: There cannot be two coaks. It would destroy the brand. I mean, this destroys the brand too. But
[02:57:47] David Rezenthal: I don't know, David, there's Coke zero, there's Diet Coke, there's...
[02:57:50] Ben Gilbert: Now there is. But you got to put yourself in the mindset pack. Then the other more practical problem
[02:57:57] David Rezenthal: was if they introduced a secondary flavor and kept original Coke on the market, they would
[02:58:05] David Rezenthal: bifurcate the base. And Pepsi would become number one. So they were paranoid about that. They'll,
[02:58:11] David Rezenthal: oh, we're pretty sure if we have multiple coaks on the market...
[02:58:15] David Rezenthal: But who cares? What was the base? It's just pure bragging rights.
[02:58:20] Ben Gilbert: Coca-Cola cared a lot. Coca-Cola, it's number one. Pepsi's the imitator. How could they ever
[02:58:26] David Rezenthal: stand and let Pepsi become number one? So what did they actually do? There's a lot of people that
[02:58:31] Ben Gilbert: probably aren't terribly familiar with new Coke and what actually happened. So Christmas of 1984,
[02:58:37] David Rezenthal: the executive team makes the decision. They're going to do it. They're going to replace
[02:58:43] David Rezenthal: the original Coca-Cola formula with new Coke. And they've all tasted it. As has 200,000 people?
[02:58:52] Ben Gilbert: Yep. They've done tons of taste tests. Not only does it beat Pepsi in taste tests, it beats
[02:58:59] David Rezenthal: original Coke. People prefer the taste of new Coke. Robert Woodruff is still alive at this point.
[02:59:06] David Rezenthal: He's 95 years old. So they're like, all right, before we do this,
[02:59:12] David Rezenthal: somebody's got to go have a conversation with Robert and tell him what we're doing. And
[02:59:18] David Rezenthal: Roberto, this one is on you. So New Year's Day, 1985, Roberto goes to see Robert Woodruff at his
[02:59:29] David Rezenthal: home. Robert can barely hear, barely speak. And according to Roberto, who is the only other person
[02:59:35] David Rezenthal: present in the room with, it was just the two of them in the room, Woodruff gives his blessing
[02:59:42] David Rezenthal: to change the formula. However, the very next morning, Woodruff stops eating. He's hospitalized
[02:59:51] David Rezenthal: a few days later and he ends up passing away on March 7, 1985, one month before the new Coke
[03:00:02] David Rezenthal: announcement. So poetic. The formula was never changed while Robert was alive.
[03:00:07] Nope, no, it was not. So six weeks later, Friday, April 19th, Coca-Cola sends out a press
[03:00:17] David Rezenthal: invitation for the, quote, most significant development in the company's nearly 100-year history
[03:00:24] David Rezenthal: they are going to hold the following Tuesday. Well, news of what is about to happen leaks
[03:00:33] David Rezenthal: over the weekend. And Pepsi takes out a full-page ad in newspapers across the country
[03:00:41] David Rezenthal: on Monday morning with the announcement reading, the other guy just blinked.
[03:00:47] David Rezenthal: After 87 years of going at it, eyeball to eyeball, the other guy just blinked. And they gave
[03:00:55] Ben Gilbert: all their employees the day off to celebrate. Which by the way, this couldn't have been sequenced
[03:01:03] Ben Gilbert: any worse because Pepsi does that. Pepsi starts giving interviews to everyone they can in the press
[03:01:08] Ben Gilbert: before the announcement actually happens. And so the press all comes in. No one's tried it yet.
[03:01:14] Ben Gilbert: So the executives can't even get their message out about it because everyone's just preloaded
[03:01:19] Ben Gilbert: with like, how bad are you losing that this is the case? Does it taste like Pepsi? Because Pepsi sort
[03:01:26] Ben Gilbert: of seated, hey, you should ask them like, is it meant to copy Pepsi? And the message that the
[03:01:31] Ben Gilbert: Coke executives have is that they're trying not to say too much. They're trying not to describe
[03:01:36] Ben Gilbert: the flavor. They're trying not to compare it to Pepsi. So they're up there just looking like
[03:01:41] Ben Gilbert: complete idiots with no answers that are substantive. Well, everyone is just attacking them.
[03:01:46] Ben Gilbert: It is a unmitigated disaster. So at one point, the questioning gets so tough that Don Kio says,
[03:01:55] David Rezenthal: quote, there's a lot of things I'd rather be doing than being here right now.
[03:01:59] David Rezenthal: This is at a press conference at a new product launch launching the biggest product of the company's
[03:02:06] David Rezenthal: history. And then the final question of the day, a reporter asks whether assuming this new Coke
[03:02:14] David Rezenthal: thing is a success, if Diet Coke will also be reformulated and Roberto responds, no, and I don't
[03:02:22] David Rezenthal: assume that this is a success. It is a success. The two crazy quotes to double down on that.
[03:02:29] Ben Gilbert: Gosweta says some choose to call this the boldest single marketing move in the history of the
[03:02:34] Ben Gilbert: package goods business. We simply call it the surest move ever made. Oh, then Don Kio follows up,
[03:02:42] Ben Gilbert: I've never been as confident about a decision as I am about the one we're announcing today. Wow.
[03:02:50] David Rezenthal: This is so bad, which I don't think either of those things are true. That can't be true. No,
[03:02:56] Ben Gilbert: just based on how timid they were in the messaging. So it turns out that in all the research that
[03:03:02] David Rezenthal: they conducted for new Coke, all 200,000 people that they did the taste test with. They never
[03:03:11] David Rezenthal: asked them how they would feel if this new beverage replaced the old Coca-Cola.
[03:03:19] David Rezenthal: And Gosweta's response to this in later years is you can't ask a question like that because people
[03:03:24] Ben Gilbert: don't know, like you can't get real data on emotional questions like that. You can only actually
[03:03:29] Ben Gilbert: test, do you like this taste better or not? And so like sure, you can run that experiment,
[03:03:35] Ben Gilbert: but ultimately how much faith are you going to put in the data? They want to learn something
[03:03:39] David Rezenthal: if they'd ask that question. Yeah. So the company immediately starts getting thousands of letters
[03:03:46] David Rezenthal: and phone calls every single day. One of my favorites is a letter that reads, my dearest Coke,
[03:03:54] David Rezenthal: you have betrayed me. We went out just last week as we had so often. And when we kissed,
[03:04:00] David Rezenthal: I knew our love affair was over. I remember walks across campus with you discussing life and love
[03:04:06] David Rezenthal: and all that matters. I remember the southern summer nights we shared with breezes leaving
[03:04:11] David Rezenthal: beads of water hanging delicately from your body. But last week I tasted betrayal on your lips.
[03:04:18] David Rezenthal: You had the smooth, seductive, sweet taste of a lie. You have become corrupted by money
[03:04:25] David Rezenthal: denying your ideals. Oh, man, or this story in Mary at a Georgia, a woman assaulted a Coke
[03:04:34] David Rezenthal: delivery man with her umbrella as he tried to stock a supermarket shelf with new Coke. You bastard
[03:04:41] David Rezenthal: she screamed, you ruined it. It tastes like shit. And I think they just didn't realize that what
[03:04:52] Ben Gilbert: they were taking away was people's childhood. Yes, they're taking away America. It's not about what
[03:04:57] Ben Gilbert: tastes better. It's what they were used to and it's what they had built an entire lifestyle brand
[03:05:03] Ben Gilbert: around believing that America meant to people. Yes. So for a couple months from April to July,
[03:05:10] David Rezenthal: they stick with it. Well, because here's the craziest thing is they were prepared for a vocal
[03:05:15] Ben Gilbert: minority to be very mad. So you're sort of in denial about all the feedback at first. You're like,
[03:05:20] Ben Gilbert: yep, this is just what we thought. And then like you get a couple months in and you're like, wait,
[03:05:24] Ben Gilbert: this is an ending. Yeah. Does everyone hate this? Yes, the answer is yes. So I thought this lasted
[03:05:33] Ben Gilbert: a year or two. And I asked family members. I asked people who were like, yeah, I think that was
[03:05:37] Ben Gilbert: like a two or three year period. There was 79 days between when they released New Coke and when
[03:05:44] Ben Gilbert: Coca-Cola classic made its return. Yep. So when they finally decide they got to bring it back,
[03:05:50] David Rezenthal: there's a question of what do they call it and what do they do with New Coke? And Coke and their
[03:05:59] David Rezenthal: lawyers ultimately decide that if they keep New Coke on the market as the official Coke and they
[03:06:06] David Rezenthal: call the old Coke, Coca-Cola classic, they can make an argument to all the bottleers. The Coca-Cola
[03:06:14] David Rezenthal: classic is a new drink. Really? Yeah, this is part of why they bring it back in this way.
[03:06:21] David Rezenthal: Because there was an opportunity to like renegotiate, hey, actually the rights that you own are to
[03:06:27] Ben Gilbert: New Coke and then more advantageous deal that we're going to cut is Coca-Cola classic. Yeah.
[03:06:32] David Rezenthal: Interesting. So on July 10th, 1985, they announced that old Coke is coming back as Coca-Cola classic
[03:06:38] David Rezenthal: and New Coke will remain on the market. And in the press conference, Don Kio says some critics
[03:06:44] David Rezenthal: will say the Coca-Cola made a marketing mistake. Some cynic will say that we plan the whole thing.
[03:06:51] David Rezenthal: The truth is we are not that dumb and we are not that smart. I don't know, it all seems pretty dumb
[03:06:59] David Rezenthal: to me. The crazy thing is they thought when they introduced Coca-Cola classic that that would be
[03:07:04] Ben Gilbert: the product for the die-hards, for this vocal minority that was really upset about it. And in practice,
[03:07:10] Ben Gilbert: what happened is everyone went back to Coca-Cola classic and nobody stayed on New Coke. I mean,
[03:07:16] Ben Gilbert: its market share was 3%. Yeah, it plummeted. And I think this completely surprised the executives
[03:07:23] Ben Gilbert: of Coca-Cola who were like, it's better. We were going to make small quantities of this Coca-Cola
[03:07:28] Ben Gilbert: classic just to appease the people who need it. But it's crazy. People just went back to the worst
[03:07:33] Ben Gilbert: tasting one. So there's a delicious one might say, Koda, to this whole thing. Wait, we didn't say
[03:07:40] Ben Gilbert: the best part of how this ends. Within a year, Coca-Cola classic surged past the heights of where
[03:07:47] Ben Gilbert: Coca-Cola was before the whole debacle started. So the whole thing worked as an accidental publicity
[03:07:53] Ben Gilbert: stunt. No advertising campaign could have ever gotten people to pay this much attention to Coke.
[03:08:00] Ben Gilbert: In many ways, this actually did save Coca-Cola. After this, they started building back share.
[03:08:07] Ben Gilbert: What's the song? You don't know what you got till it's gone. This made people realize, oh my god,
[03:08:13] Ben Gilbert: I do love Coca-Cola. Yes, that is the most important day away from this. This is what finally
[03:08:19] David Rezenthal: stop the Pepsi challenge is Pepsi one. And then after Pepsi winning and Coke losing, Coke was able
[03:08:28] David Rezenthal: to come back. But yes, they had to literally kill Coca-Cola in order to resurrect from the ashes
[03:08:35] David Rezenthal: and survive the Pepsi challenge. The little fun trivia is, David, do you know what new Coke
[03:08:41] Ben Gilbert: became after they removed the name new Coke but left the product on the market? Oh, no, I don't.
[03:08:51] They renamed it Coke 2. And it was not fully abandoned until 2002. Wow, that's how long they stuck
[03:09:02] David Rezenthal: with it. Yep. So I don't know who the Coke 2 fans were, but it was available for you at some point.
[03:09:07] Ben Gilbert: For a while. Somebody has horded a whole stat of Coke 2 somewhere. It's in some bunker,
[03:09:14] David Rezenthal: somewhere. Yes. All right. So the delicious soda to this whole thing. Please remember how I set
[03:09:21] David Rezenthal: up the Warren Buffett ham sandwich thing. And I think this whole episode is probably where he decides
[03:09:28] David Rezenthal: Jesus Coca-Cola could be run by a ham sandwich. Would have been better off. But actually not, right?
[03:09:33] Ben Gilbert: This whole thing was so stupid that it was actually amazing. What's the Bernard Arnau quote,
[03:09:38] David Rezenthal: even when he loses he wins. Yes. So after this whole new Coke disaster,
[03:09:46] David Rezenthal: Coca-Cola companies stock is in the dumps. And who comes in? But Warren Buffett, perfect.
[03:09:54] David Rezenthal: Berkshire Hathaway and buys a roughly $1.3 billion equity stake in the company over the next
[03:10:04] David Rezenthal: few years and joins the Coca-Cola board turns out to be a well-adabatable investment.
[03:10:12] David Rezenthal: He owns about 9.5% of Coca-Cola today. Yep. Berkshire owns about 9.5% of Coca-Cola today. That
[03:10:19] David Rezenthal: stake is worth about $28 billion, which is a 22 23x gross return on the $1.3 billion investment
[03:10:30] David Rezenthal: over the course of 40 years, which equates to only just over about a 8% IRR. But Coca-Cola stock
[03:10:40] David Rezenthal: kicks off these days about a billion dollars a year in dividends to Berkshire. So in total,
[03:10:46] David Rezenthal: Berkshire has received about $12 billion in Coca-Cola dividends. So a $40 billion total return
[03:10:54] David Rezenthal: on $1.3 billion invested. Good. But again, this is over 40 years. So that only bumps it up to about
[03:11:02] David Rezenthal: a 10% IRR on the investment, which I imagine he would have been better buying Berkshire Hathaway stock.
[03:11:09] Ben Gilbert: He would have been better off buying the S&P 500 over that same time period. That's brutal.
[03:11:16] Ben Gilbert: Including dividends over that same time period. The S&P 500 is up about 11% annually.
[03:11:24] David Rezenthal: So the famous Berkshire Hathaway Coca-Cola investment today is actually under performing the market.
[03:11:32] David Rezenthal: Crazy, right? When I did some math on this, my first glance at it was this has been an
[03:11:37] Ben Gilbert: unbelievable investment because even though the equity value is, you know, it's gone up, would you say,
[03:11:41] Ben Gilbert: 20 something X, but over a long period of time, it's been fine. 22, 23. The dividend yield is insane.
[03:11:48] Ben Gilbert: They get 800 million to a billion out every year and their principle was 1.3 billion. That's like 60 to
[03:11:54] Ben Gilbert: 80% dividend yield on their original investment. I'd love to park a dollar somewhere so that I could
[03:12:01] Ben Gilbert: pull out 60, 70, 80 cents every single year on that dollar. That's amazing. But when you frame it
[03:12:07] Ben Gilbert: the way you did, but 40 years is a long time. Right. Over a long period of time, you better have
[03:12:12] Ben Gilbert: insane multiples to justify locking capital up for 40 years. Yep. And you know, the thing about the
[03:12:19] David Rezenthal: S&P 500, right, is it's a rotating set. Right. That's not really fair. And over the last few years,
[03:12:24] David Rezenthal: of course, the tech companies have rotated in and yeah, the returns from, you know, the Magnificent
[03:12:29] David Rezenthal: Seven over the last 10 years dwarf anything else. But I'm sure buying Berkshire in 1988 to 1994,
[03:12:37] Ben Gilbert: which was the stretch that he bought Coca-Cola and holding it to today, it would have been a far
[03:12:41] Ben Gilbert: better investment that buying Coca-Cola stock. And that is a fair comparison unlike an index,
[03:12:45] Ben Gilbert: which has companies that rotate in and out. Yep. By the way, this is the fault of Coca-Cola over
[03:12:52] Ben Gilbert: the last 20 years. It had a ridiculous run right after Warren invested. We'll cover it at the very
[03:12:58] Ben Gilbert: end of the episode, but revenue and earnings growth over the last 20 years on a annualized basis
[03:13:04] Ben Gilbert: has not been great. Yep. Well, speaking of the good initial few years of the run there,
[03:13:11] David Rezenthal: there's one more fruit shall we say to be harvested of the Columbia Pictures acquisition.
[03:13:19] David Rezenthal: That goes out and Kio did in the early 80s. The relationship with CAA. Yes. And super agent
[03:13:27] David Rezenthal: Michael Ovitz. Past acquired guest. Indeed. Part of the acquired cinematic universe. So when Coca-Cola
[03:13:35] David Rezenthal: sells Columbia to Sony, Ovitz and CAA are official advisors on the deal. That's right. When
[03:13:43] Ovitz tried to take it from a talent agency and movie packaging into also doing investment banking.
[03:13:49] Ben Gilbert: Yes. And on the back of that success expanding CAA into investment banking, Ovitz is like
[03:13:57] David Rezenthal: why stop there? Why don't we expand become an ad agency into ad agency land too. So he comes back
[03:14:05] David Rezenthal: to go Zeta and Kio and says, Hey, I want to pitch you guys on taking over as your ad agency from
[03:14:14] David Rezenthal: McCann Ericsson, which is crazy. This is Coca-Cola. But Ovitz's pitch is pretty good. He's like, Hey,
[03:14:21] David Rezenthal: McCann Ericsson has been great for you guys. And of course, you know, there's the hilltop ad and the
[03:14:26] David Rezenthal: real thing and everything over the past set of years. But hey, this one site, one sound, one cell thing
[03:14:34] David Rezenthal: is not going to work in the new media landscape. I mean, look at how badly you got your butt
[03:14:39] David Rezenthal: kicked by the Pepsi challenge in grassroots marketing. What you need are different messages
[03:14:46] David Rezenthal: that are going to resonate on different mediums. You know, we've got the cable network landscape
[03:14:50] David Rezenthal: these days. We've got ESPN. We've got sitcoms. We've got kids shows. We've got all this different
[03:14:55] David Rezenthal: media. It's not just the whole family watching. I love Lucy anymore. You need a whole new approach
[03:15:01] David Rezenthal: for the new media landscape. And so you shouldn't have just one television ad. You should have a whole
[03:15:06] David Rezenthal: suite of different television ads for different audiences in different times of the year.
[03:15:11] David Rezenthal: And there should be a democratic approach to this where it's not just one creative director at one
[03:15:15] Ben Gilbert: agency. You want the best ideas that can come from anywhere. And we have all the talent relationships
[03:15:21] Ben Gilbert: with all these different writers, directors, actors. You just give us a creative brief. We'll come
[03:15:27] Ben Gilbert: back with 30 great ideas for you from 30 different sources. So he pitches Coke that CAA can make 40 ads
[03:15:36] David Rezenthal: a year for them for the same cost that Mechanarexin is making seven. And they can all stay unified
[03:15:43] David Rezenthal: under the new Coke slogan of always Coca-Cola. So in 1992, CAA wins the business,
[03:15:52] David Rezenthal: dethrones Mechanarexin. And among the many ads that they create for Coke is a new
[03:16:00] David Rezenthal: Christmas Coca-Cola motif, not featuring Santa Claus, but instead the polar bears. Yep.
[03:16:09] David Rezenthal: Oh, it makes the polar bears amazing. Well, yeah, I mean, he didn't make the polar bears. But
[03:16:15] David Rezenthal: Oh, it's found the talent through the CAA network to make the polar bears. So I think this is basically
[03:16:23] Ben Gilbert: the climax of our story. New Coke, what happens afterwards, the polar bear is these beloved ads,
[03:16:29] Ben Gilbert: the rest of the 90s and 2000s. There's a lot of company building that happens, but it's just not
[03:16:38] Ben Gilbert: that romantic of a story as much as Coca-Cola's first century was. Well, the thing that really started
[03:16:47] David Rezenthal: to happen in the 90s and then accelerated in the 2000s is the beverage market just moved away
[03:16:55] David Rezenthal: from Colas and towards a whole variety of other drinks. The first battleground for this
[03:17:03] David Rezenthal: is sports drinks and Gatorade. Yep. So in the 80s, Gatorade really came on the scene and
[03:17:11] David Rezenthal: established the market for sports drinks and Gatorade was part of Quaker Oats. That's right. I
[03:17:17] Ben Gilbert: forgot Quaker Oats ended up owning it. Yeah, way back in the day. So Coca-Cola in response to
[03:17:23] David Rezenthal: Gatorade's success launches power aid in 1988. Power aid is a homegrown product at Coca-Cola.
[03:17:32] David Rezenthal: It never achieves anywhere near the same success as Gatorade. I think it maxes out market share
[03:17:38] David Rezenthal: in like the teens and low 20s. Finally, in the year 2000, this is crazy. The then CEO of Coca-Cola
[03:17:46] David Rezenthal: goes at a tragically died of lung cancer in 1997. In 2000, the CEO of Coke announces publicly
[03:17:55] David Rezenthal: a $16 billion deal to acquire Quaker Oats and Gatorade. This would have been a great deal for the
[03:18:03] David Rezenthal: company. Whoa. Yeah. That didn't happen. So he announced it without board approval. The board
[03:18:11] David Rezenthal: rejected it after the public announcement. The deal falls through and the next year Pepsi ends up
[03:18:19] David Rezenthal: swooping in buying Quaker Oats and Gatorade and Gatorade is like a home run for Pepsi ever since.
[03:18:26] I had no idea. Wow. Wild, right? It's total echoes of the Frida-lay disaster. Coke could have
[03:18:33] David Rezenthal: owned Frida-lay's and Gatorade. Wow. Yeah. And that is a little illustration of the CEO at the time.
[03:18:45] Ben Gilbert: There have been five CEOs since Gosweta, 1998, onward. And the first three only lasted three to four
[03:18:53] Ben Gilbert: years each. Very different than the Woodruff dynasty in the long run that Gosweta had also.
[03:18:58] Ben Gilbert: Yeah. The thing that is extremely clear that David you touched on is they had to diversify into what
[03:19:06] Ben Gilbert: they call a total beverage company really prompted by this backlash against soft drinks. The world
[03:19:12] Ben Gilbert: sort of lost interest in first Fulshogger Colas and then Colas and the thing that was kind of
[03:19:20] Ben Gilbert: driving it not really in the 90s but in the 2000s and certainly the 2010s obesity. It was clear
[03:19:27] Ben Gilbert: that America was only going in one direction and sugar and processed foods coupled with the sedentary
[03:19:32] Ben Gilbert: lifestyle that a lot of Americans live is a giant culprit of obesity. And so Coke sort of trapped
[03:19:39] Ben Gilbert: figuring out what to do about this. The American Heart Association comes out and says the recommended
[03:19:45] Ben Gilbert: daily limit of sugar for men is 36 grams and women is 25 grams per day. The recommended limit per day.
[03:19:54] Ben Gilbert: A 12 ounce can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of sugar. Yeah, 39 grams. So you've got this sort of
[03:20:01] Ben Gilbert: hard problem where Coca-Cola itself just that one product that one product line is this unbelievable
[03:20:09] Ben Gilbert: business. Super high margin, low capital investment. Brand is built and established all over the world.
[03:20:16] Ben Gilbert: Like it's hard to want to invest to anything else when that's your current business. And at the same
[03:20:23] Ben Gilbert: time, they need to. It's existential. This product is probably going to only go downhill from here.
[03:20:29] Ben Gilbert: Maybe it's got a few more years. Maybe another decade of success. But 50 years from now, will this
[03:20:33] Ben Gilbert: be your cash cow? No. And so how do you start diversifying without admitting that your current
[03:20:39] Ben Gilbert: main product that is the company's namesake is bad for you? It's just bad for you. Yep.
[03:20:46] David Rezenthal: Tough spot to be in. Not an enviable position to be in. And you can sort of see how that
[03:20:51] Ben Gilbert: churned CEOs pretty quickly. Now the interesting thing though, back to Pepsi,
[03:20:56] David Rezenthal: they've managed this at least from a business standpoint. Pretty well over the past set of
[03:21:02] David Rezenthal: decades, you know, first with free to lay, then with Quaker Oats and Gatorade, then in the bottled
[03:21:07] David Rezenthal: water market. So Pepsi launches Aquafina, Coke launches to Sony. Yeah, they were pretty late to the
[03:21:14] Ben Gilbert: game in waters. I mean, I think the story of the last 25 years is they sit there in a privileged
[03:21:21] Ben Gilbert: position and look around and wait and see. And then when something really starts happening, then they
[03:21:26] Ben Gilbert: go become active in it. And they just have to sort of hope that all the assets they have,
[03:21:31] Ben Gilbert: including the Coke distribution system, makes it okay that they're not first to market on some of
[03:21:35] Ben Gilbert: these things. But I don't know, sometimes it's really costum. And the biggest, most interesting
[03:21:40] Ben Gilbert: one is monster energy. Do you know the story behind monster energy? Well, I know what happened,
[03:21:46] David Rezenthal: but I don't know the story. I mean, they started acquiring and investing in a lot of other
[03:21:51] David Rezenthal: beverage companies through the 2000s. There was adwala, there was vitamin water, there was fuse,
[03:21:59] David Rezenthal: and then I know monster comes along. Yep. So monster started. Do you remember Hanson's juice?
[03:22:07] Ben Gilbert: Yes. That is monster. Oh, I think I've actually did know this. This is a wild story.
[03:22:13] David Rezenthal: I don't have the entire story because this is the Coke episode, not the monster episode, but
[03:22:17] Ben Gilbert: at some point the Hanson leadership realized that they did want to get into energy drinks,
[03:22:21] Ben Gilbert: but their current brand was not going to be effective in doing so. And so they came up with this
[03:22:25] Ben Gilbert: really crazy brand that felt dark and dangerous to counter position the cleaner aesthetic of Red Bull.
[03:22:31] Ben Gilbert: And ends up going great, better than they ever could have imagined. So there were various times
[03:22:37] Ben Gilbert: early in the transition from Hanson's natural to monster where Coke could have bought it,
[03:22:43] Ben Gilbert: but it was subscale and then there were sort of lulls and growth and it was sort of
[03:22:48] Ben Gilbert: false starts in it becoming the big giant thing that it became. And also energy drinks as a
[03:22:53] Ben Gilbert: category, people weren't sure how durable it was. You know, is this really going to be the thing
[03:22:58] Ben Gilbert: that it became or is it a fad? So in 2012, monster reached out to potential buyers,
[03:23:04] Ben Gilbert: including Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but Coke decided against pursuing it because the price was high.
[03:23:10] Ben Gilbert: Monsters market cap was $11 billion at the time. Oh goodness. Wow. And what is monster's market cap
[03:23:19] David Rezenthal: today? $70 billion. Yeah. I'd say these energy drinks are not a fad. Yeah. So what ended up
[03:23:28] Ben Gilbert: actually happening much later on? Coca-Cola was like, ah crap. We should have done that.
[03:23:32] Ben Gilbert: They do sign a deal with them. So it's a pretty interesting deal. Coke decided we're going to walk
[03:23:37] Ben Gilbert: away from being in the energy drink business. So as a part of this deal, we're going to do a business
[03:23:42] Ben Gilbert: swap where Coke gives its energy drink brands, Nas, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother and Relentless to
[03:23:50] Ben Gilbert: monster. Monster transfers, it's non energy business, including the original Hanson's natural sodas.
[03:23:58] Amazing. Over to Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola becomes monster's preferred global distribution partner.
[03:24:04] Ben Gilbert: And monster becomes Coca-Cola's exclusive energy drink play. And Coca-Cola gets a 20% stake in
[03:24:12] David Rezenthal: the company, right? Well, yeah, but Coke had to buy it. So Coke had the privilege of investing in
[03:24:17] Ben Gilbert: monster. In 2015, Coke puts in over $2 billion, at least they're getting on the train. So Coke is
[03:24:26] Ben Gilbert: the largest shareholder now in monster energy. And you know, that deal looks pretty good. That
[03:24:32] Ben Gilbert: two-ish billion that they put in is worth almost $12 billion today. So nice investment, but gosh,
[03:24:39] Ben Gilbert: if you're the global total beverage company, what has the trend been of the last 15 years in beverages?
[03:24:46] Ben Gilbert: I bet they sure wish they owned monster. Yeah. It is funny though. Like I'm talking
[03:24:52] Ben Gilbert: at both sides of my mouth here, if you think that Coca-Cola is bad for you,
[03:24:58] Ben Gilbert: wait till you see the energy drink. So it's not just the obesity thing. There's a trend
[03:25:03] Ben Gilbert: into energy drinks that has nothing to do with health. Yeah, it's interesting. The energy drinks
[03:25:08] David Rezenthal: are almost a call back to the original like Pat and Edison. Yeah, this is really bad for you,
[03:25:16] David Rezenthal: but you're going in eyes wide open to that. Yes, that's exactly right. It is serving a function
[03:25:22] David Rezenthal: for you. Yeah. The other funny thing that happens is Coca-Cola buys glass O, which makes vitamin
[03:25:30] Ben Gilbert: water and smart water in sort of yet another. Oh, we should also be in water play. They pay about
[03:25:36] Ben Gilbert: $4 billion for that. The founder then goes on to leave Coca-Cola and starts body armor,
[03:25:44] Ben Gilbert: sports drink that I think is coconut water based, a little bit more sugary, turns around sells
[03:25:49] Ben Gilbert: that back to Coca-Cola for $5 billion. For a startup, body armor did great. Gatorade still has
[03:25:57] David Rezenthal: 60% plus of the market share of sports drinks. Doesn't make a dent in PepsiCo's number one position
[03:26:05] David Rezenthal: in sports drinks. Yeah. If you're going to look at Coca-Cola as a total beverage company and say
[03:26:11] Ben Gilbert: what beverages have really been killing it the last 20 years that you've managed to bet correctly
[03:26:17] Ben Gilbert: on our incubator and house. And the answer is Diet Coke and Coke Zero. Yep. Coke Zero, 2005.
[03:26:26] David Rezenthal: Taste infringement. For a few years, it was growing at 10% a year, which is really fast considering
[03:26:32] Ben Gilbert: it launched like 20 years ago. And it was already very large. Yeah, it is sort of ironic that the last
[03:26:38] David Rezenthal: 20 years have been about a metamorphosis into a total beverage company. And it's Coca-Cola,
[03:26:46] David Rezenthal: Diet Coke and Coke Zero that are leading the way. Yes. So that was a lot of stuff that happened
[03:26:52] Ben Gilbert: in the 2000s. The 2010s, they did acquire more brands. They continue to grow the total beverage
[03:26:58] Ben Gilbert: companies portfolio. They did a whole bunch of stuff that we're not going to spend too much time
[03:27:03] Ben Gilbert: on in this episode, rehabbing their bottler operations, bringing a lot of it back in house,
[03:27:10] Ben Gilbert: making sure the quality and the efficiency was up to where they wanted to have it and then
[03:27:14] Ben Gilbert: spinning it back out. And so a lot of these bottlers came on balance sheet, then went back off
[03:27:18] Ben Gilbert: balance sheet to new owners. They encouraged consolidation among their bottlers. They finally got
[03:27:24] Ben Gilbert: rid of the last little element of the parent bottlers. And so the story for people who follow Coke
[03:27:32] Ben Gilbert: as a company or a stock is a lot around how good of a job are they doing restructuring all the
[03:27:37] Ben Gilbert: bottlers. And it seems like they're they're mostly through this whole refranchising thing that
[03:27:42] Ben Gilbert: they're doing. So that brings us to the business today. Yeah. And the business today, the biggest
[03:27:50] David Rezenthal: piece is a part of the story that we basically haven't talked about since World War II is international.
[03:27:57] David Rezenthal: Coke is a global company. Yeah. Most of the revenue and profits do not come from the United States,
[03:28:03] David Rezenthal: even though all the storylines that we've been talking about are the United States.
[03:28:07] David Rezenthal: But I think when people look at the Coca-Cola that they're holding, they think about the United
[03:28:12] Ben Gilbert: States. Right. Maybe that's not true. Maybe I'm I live here and so I'm ethnocentric about that. But
[03:28:17] Ben Gilbert: I'd be curious if Coke feels like America to you if you're a listener and you don't live here.
[03:28:23] Ben Gilbert: Yep. You know, the other part of it is Coca-Cola did set up the bottlers as independent,
[03:28:30] David Rezenthal: locally owned entrepreneurial businesses in all the countries that they went into.
[03:28:34] David Rezenthal: Produces a lot of profits locally. Yep. So yeah, it is a local business wherever it is.
[03:28:41] All right. So let's walk through that. Here's Coca-Cola by the numbers today. So first of all,
[03:28:46] Ben Gilbert: brands. For a long time, the thought was just build the total beverage company and more brands
[03:28:52] Ben Gilbert: is better. So let's just keep going. They got over 500. Around 2020, they did a big swimming and
[03:28:58] Ben Gilbert: went down to about 200. And ones that they got rid of were tab, Zico, Adwala, Honestee, Vault.
[03:29:07] Ben Gilbert: Those are probably some of the ones you'd know that they got rid of. They do have 30 brands that
[03:29:12] Ben Gilbert: do over a billion dollars in revenue. That's not crazy. That's a house of brands that has that many
[03:29:19] Ben Gilbert: billion dollar brands. 15 of them were created organically like Fanta and Sprite that we didn't
[03:29:24] Ben Gilbert: talk about in this episode. That's right. We didn't talk about Sprite. Do you know the history
[03:29:29] David Rezenthal: behind Sprite? Do you know what Sprite really is? No, not really. So Sprite, as we all know it today,
[03:29:38] David Rezenthal: is not Sprite. Sprite is Fanta clear lemon from Germany. Really? Yep. That they brought over to
[03:29:47] David Rezenthal: America and rebranded it to Sprite. No way. And they stole the name from, they had a character named
[03:29:53] Ben Gilbert: Sprite boy, who was a part of the Coca-Cola Santa Claus universe. Yep. That's right.
[03:29:59] David Rezenthal: All right. Those are two of the 15 that were created organically in house. Three of them, they bought
[03:30:04] Ben Gilbert: that were already doing over a billion in acquisition. And then the remaining 12 of the 30
[03:30:08] Ben Gilbert: billion dollar brands that they have were small and Coke grew them to over a billion in revenue
[03:30:13] Ben Gilbert: underneath their umbrella. So think minute made fair life and vitamin water. And just to share
[03:30:18] Ben Gilbert: some of the other brands, they do own Powerade, Minute Made, Dessani, Vitamin Water, Coke Zero,
[03:30:26] Ben Gilbert: Shwebs, Smart Water, Ciel, which is another water brand and Crystal, which is yet a third water
[03:30:34] Ben Gilbert: brand. They recently bought Topo Chico. They're actually playing around in alcoholic beverages a
[03:30:39] Ben Gilbert: little bit with Topo Chico with a hard celtzer. And I think they're also doing a jack-and-coke
[03:30:44] Ben Gilbert: and Sprite that is alcoholics. They're starting to dip their toe into that a little bit.
[03:30:50] Ben Gilbert: Mmm. The Fantic Clear Lemon alcoholic. All right. That's right. That's a really ring to it.
[03:30:55] Fresca, Body Armor, Fair Life, and Core Power, the dairy products, and Fuse Tea. And here's one that
[03:31:06] Ben Gilbert: is a little bit of a head scratcher, Coasta Coffee. Yes, that they bought for quite a few billion
[03:31:12] David Rezenthal: dollars a couple of years ago, right? And it's a physical retail. It's a coffee house in the UK.
[03:31:18] Ben Gilbert: Yeah, it's like a Starbucks competitor. Yeah. So that's interesting that they operate a coffee
[03:31:22] Ben Gilbert: house. By the way, speaking of coffee, someone told me that the relationship with McDonald's runs so
[03:31:26] Ben Gilbert: deep that Coca-Cola sources the coffee beans for McDonald's. Wow. And if it's actually this
[03:31:35] Ben Gilbert: whole source of McDonald's, that is a giant number of coffee beans. Well, it's interesting with both
[03:31:40] David Rezenthal: the cost of coffee and the McDonald's coffee. I'm pretty sure we talked about with Howard on our
[03:31:45] David Rezenthal: Starbucks episode, the Starbucks Pepsi partnership with Frappuccino, right? That's right. The Pepsi was
[03:31:50] Ben Gilbert: the bottler that made the CPG version of the Frappuccino. Yep. Huge success for both companies.
[03:31:56] Yep. So those are the 30 billion dollar brands that they have. Coca-Cola serves 2.2 billion
[03:32:04] Ben Gilbert: servings of their beverages to the world every day. Wild. That is what like a quarter of the world's
[03:32:12] David Rezenthal: population, if everybody were having just one. Isn't that crazy? Definitely not even least bread.
[03:32:18] David Rezenthal: Yes. There are a lot of power users of Coke products out there. Yes. But Coca-Cola's estimate is
[03:32:24] Ben Gilbert: that there are 65 billion servings of beverages consumed every day. Is that include water or no?
[03:32:31] David Rezenthal: Yeah. Human race takes 65 billion drinks a day of something. So what's that? I guess that's
[03:32:38] David Rezenthal: eight drinks per person per day? Yes. So by that calculation, that got a lot long way to go. Huge
[03:32:45] Ben Gilbert: market ahead of them, even if they stayed just in beverages. There you go. They have 200 bottling
[03:32:50] Ben Gilbert: partners around the world with 950 unique facilities. Pretty awesome that they don't have to own
[03:32:56] Ben Gilbert: the vast majority of that. From a revenue perspective, this is where you were starting to get into
[03:33:01] Ben Gilbert: and how is the revenue breakdown. The Coca-Cola company itself does 47 billion dollars in revenue.
[03:33:08] Ben Gilbert: And how much is North America versus rest of the world? 40% of revenue is in the US and 60% is
[03:33:15] Ben Gilbert: international. That's actually bigger than I would have thought in the US. Yeah. Still very meaningful.
[03:33:22] David Rezenthal: A bit for the core of Cola products. It's less than 40% in the US. Yep. I bet that's totally right.
[03:33:28] Ben Gilbert: Okay. So the interesting thing is if you start to look at employees. So revenue,
[03:33:33] Ben Gilbert: 47 billion dollars at Coca-Cola company out of 175 billion dollars in total revenue by the system.
[03:33:39] Ben Gilbert: And this is as reported by Coca-Cola in their proxy statement. There are 70,000 employees of Coca-Cola.
[03:33:47] Ben Gilbert: But again, if you look at the system, there are 700,000 employees.
[03:33:52] Ben Gilbert: So let's look at those last two numbers together because that's a 10x difference in employee
[03:33:57] Ben Gilbert: account. A full 47 of the 175 billion dollars in revenue goes to the Coca-Cola company. 27% of
[03:34:04] Ben Gilbert: the revenue with just 10% of the total employees. I mean, the Coca-Cola company gets a tremendous
[03:34:11] Ben Gilbert: amount of leverage out of the bottling system. This is just employees. This doesn't even think about
[03:34:17] Ben Gilbert: the margin profile. This doesn't think about return on invested capital, which again is all much
[03:34:23] Ben Gilbert: better if you're the Coca-Cola company versus if you're the bottlers. Yep. And then there's the
[03:34:29] David Rezenthal: fountain customers, the retail partners, the McDonald's of the world. Definitely Coca-Cola is
[03:34:35] David Rezenthal: it a better return on invested capital standpoint than running restaurants.
[03:34:40] David Rezenthal: The Coca-Cola company just needs to sell syrup and spend marketing dollars to sell the dream.
[03:34:46] Ben Gilbert: The beautiful position to be in. Yes it is.
[03:34:50] David Rezenthal: Earnings on that 47 billion dollars, they generate 10.6 billion dollars of net income.
[03:34:57] Ben Gilbert: The net income margins tend to average around 23% gross margins average about 60%.
[03:35:04] Ben Gilbert: Historically, it was as high as 70%. So almost as good as a software business but not quite.
[03:35:09] Ben Gilbert: But for a physical goods business, kind of unbelievable that they have 60% gross margins.
[03:35:16] Ben Gilbert: Then when you look at the revenue mix on products, this kind of gets to like what is the company today?
[03:35:22] Ben Gilbert: 69% of revenue comes from sparkling soft drinks. So as much as they are in water and milk and tea
[03:35:30] Ben Gilbert: and juice and sports drinks, the bulk of this business is selling soda. 40% of all volume
[03:35:37] Ben Gilbert: is trademark Coca-Cola, which is just Coke Diet Coke Coke Zero and the like caffeine-free and
[03:35:43] Ben Gilbert: flavored variants. 47% of the volume is the Coke family. Wow. So I kind of continue to maintain
[03:35:53] Ben Gilbert: this mentality of they keep trying to get into other stuff. But then there are always a little bit
[03:35:59] Ben Gilbert: like geez, I know we should be getting into this other stuff, but it's not as good as our original
[03:36:03] Ben Gilbert: thing. It's not as good as a business. It's not as unique of a brand. And I also think they're kind of
[03:36:09] Ben Gilbert: like limping into a lot of these other categories. They're not making a giant early bet on things
[03:36:17] Ben Gilbert: that become the next big beverage fad. They're trying to watch and see how it plays out and then
[03:36:22] Ben Gilbert: jump in. Yeah, whether it's sports drinks or energy drinks. Exactly. Market cap is 300 billion
[03:36:29] Ben Gilbert: dollars. So huge company, not by Mag 7 tech standards, but massive, very valuable company.
[03:36:35] Ben Gilbert: You'll note, David, they did not achieve Charlie Munger's thought experiment of two trillion
[03:36:40] Ben Gilbert: dollars. And they are very unlikely to get there by the 150th birthday in 2036, which is the
[03:36:46] Ben Gilbert: time frame that Charlie used. Indeed. Growth is only three or four percent a year. If you look
[03:36:52] Ben Gilbert: since 1998, in the post-Gosweta years, it averages out to about three to four percent growth. So
[03:36:59] Ben Gilbert: I think fair to say anemic when you're describing their growth in recent years. Yeah, I think that's
[03:37:04] Ben Gilbert: why we focused the bulk of the episode on the pre-1998 Coca-Cola. That's really where they built
[03:37:10] Ben Gilbert: this unbelievable thing that frankly saturated the world. Yeah, this incredible business with all
[03:37:16] David Rezenthal: these innovations and pillars of what became one of, if not the greatest, brand in American history.
[03:37:24] David Rezenthal: But yeah, as we said, back starting at the Pepsi Challenge days, I think there's a strong argument
[03:37:30] David Rezenthal: that Pepsi was the more interesting company. And over the last 50 years, soft drinks as a category
[03:37:35] Ben Gilbert: have just gotten a lot more competitive. The stat that I saw was back in 1948, Coca-Cola said that
[03:37:41] Ben Gilbert: they had 60% market share of US soft drinks. 60% in post-World War II America. In soft drinks,
[03:37:50] Ben Gilbert: today they have 21%. Pepsi has 10%. And I think there's a lot of things in soft drinks. If you just
[03:37:56] Ben Gilbert: look at carbonated, Coca-Cola does have 47% market share. And Pepsi has 19%. But in soft drinks, I mean,
[03:38:03] Ben Gilbert: the category has just gotten a lot more competitive and Coke has lost share. Yeah. All right, should we move
[03:38:08] Ben Gilbert: into analysis? Yes, let's do it. All right. So instead of playbook this time, because I had just
[03:38:15] Ben Gilbert: something kind of funny written down for playbook, which is this company really only does two things,
[03:38:19] Ben Gilbert: manufacture syrup out of some unique intellectual property that they own and spend money on marketing.
[03:38:27] Correct. I think the more interesting playbook this time is a brief review of why Coca-Cola worked.
[03:38:33] Ben Gilbert: Yes. Love it. Let's do it. Well, first, you were talking about it a minute ago with the 64
[03:38:41] David Rezenthal: billion daily thirst quenching occasions around the globe. Nice market to get to play in. Yeah,
[03:38:48] Ben Gilbert: they're just in a giant market. Everybody in the world gets thirsty. And everybody in the world
[03:38:55] David Rezenthal: likes to have some variety in what they drink besides just water. Yep. Full stop. Full stop.
[03:39:01] Ben Gilbert: And in that category, they built something that for many years, the better part of a century,
[03:39:06] Ben Gilbert: people felt was n of one. Yes. They were the original. They were the real thing. And it took a long time
[03:39:14] Ben Gilbert: for that to get eroded. And honestly, if I'm looking at sodas, it's still the real thing. It's just
[03:39:19] Ben Gilbert: that there's a lot of other things too. And that's due to both a multi-decade 100-year-plus investment
[03:39:27] David Rezenthal: in building the brand and some of the greatest brand marketing of all time. Yep.
[03:39:33] Three, World War Two, and having a unbelievably paved path for them to expand globally,
[03:39:40] Ben Gilbert: and then also kind of shut the door behind them on global expansion. Yep. And I really do think
[03:39:46] David Rezenthal: continuing the second party locally, entrepreneurially owned franchise bottling system internationally
[03:39:55] David Rezenthal: was a huge contributor to that. Yeah. So much of coke success. I mean, I keep going back to that
[03:40:00] Ben Gilbert: moment earlier where bottlers enabled them to scale so much faster than not having bottlers. And even
[03:40:07] Ben Gilbert: if you look at all the beautiful business dynamics of you don't have to deal with that lower margin
[03:40:11] Ben Gilbert: stuff, you don't have to deal with the high-head count stuff, the high complexity stuff, the high overhead,
[03:40:15] Ben Gilbert: the lower returns on invested capital, even if it's just about speed to market. Yes.
[03:40:21] David Rezenthal: They got to blanket America and then blanket the world very quickly before anyone else with the
[03:40:27] Ben Gilbert: thing that people pick a supplier once, whether the restaurants picking the supplier or people are
[03:40:32] Ben Gilbert: picking their favorite beverage, they pick it and then it's over. And they sort of had this
[03:40:37] Ben Gilbert: unbelievably fast way to saturate in something that was a race. It turned out soft drinks were a
[03:40:44] Ben Gilbert: category that was a race and who's going to get to global scale first. Yes. And it was all figured
[03:40:50] David Rezenthal: out by accident because of the worst business deal in history. As Steve Jobs always says, you can
[03:40:55] Ben Gilbert: only connect the dots looking backwards. That's right. The $1 contract. Of course, it is a highly
[03:41:01] Ben Gilbert: addictive substance that is also super enjoyable to drink and triggers every reward center you have,
[03:41:07] Ben Gilbert: not nearly as much as when it had cocaine in it, but plenty of reward centers from the bubbles,
[03:41:12] Ben Gilbert: the sugar, the caffeine, the cold refreshment, everything about it. I've been fired up doing this
[03:41:18] David Rezenthal: episode. The extrinsic marketing capability of associating it with everything good in your life,
[03:41:24] Ben Gilbert: with happiness, with Christmas, with your family, with your favorite athletes. It's just amazing
[03:41:30] Ben Gilbert: lifestyle marketing. Yep. And then lastly, I will say new Coke. It taught us to love again. I mean,
[03:41:39] Ben Gilbert: it made us fall back in love with Coca-Cola. I think Coca-Cola would be worse off today if they
[03:41:44] Ben Gilbert: didn't go through the new Coke moment, which is crazy to say. But I guess we don't have the
[03:41:48] Ben Gilbert: counterfactual. But if you just look at the data on the resurgence in Coke afterwards,
[03:41:52] Ben Gilbert: you couldn't have come up with a better marketing stunt. Totally agree. I disagree with both
[03:41:58] David Rezenthal: sides of the Don Kio statement that we weren't that dumb and we weren't that smart. They absolutely
[03:42:03] David Rezenthal: were that dumb and they absolutely were that smart. Yep. Yep. I've got two more that I would add.
[03:42:10] David Rezenthal: Great. One, I think Pepsi was great for Coke. I think neither Pepsi nor Coke would be what they
[03:42:17] David Rezenthal: are today or be as great a product and company as they are today if it weren't for the other one.
[03:42:23] David Rezenthal: Definitely. I mean, the Pepsi challenge is what made Pepsi because there was a challenge to Coke
[03:42:29] David Rezenthal: and then all of Coke's response, they made each other better. Yep. And then the last one I would add
[03:42:35] David Rezenthal: is that other than software and technology products, this is the first real physical product. I
[03:42:46] David Rezenthal: think we've ever studied on acquired where you can have both a low selling price and high margins.
[03:42:54] David Rezenthal: Oh, that's interesting. And that's super important when it's also a game of scale and global scale
[03:43:02] David Rezenthal: because it lets you sell this affordable luxury or pause that refreshes to everybody in the world.
[03:43:11] David Rezenthal: More or less everybody in the world can afford a Coca-Cola. And also the Coca-Cola company makes
[03:43:18] David Rezenthal: great margins on those selling prices. That's a lot of volume. And that's incredibly cheap
[03:43:24] Ben Gilbert: ingredients. That's the other. Yes. That's our why Coke worked. That's our tablo of why Coke worked so
[03:43:32] David Rezenthal: well. Yes. All right. Powers for new listeners to the show. And there are many of you. Thank you so
[03:43:38] Ben Gilbert: much to all of you who share the Trader Joe's episode with friends and family. We saw tens of
[03:43:43] Ben Gilbert: thousands of new listeners come and join us. So welcome to the party. This section power is
[03:43:49] Ben Gilbert: gleefully ripped from a book called Seven Powers by our friend Hamilton Helmer. And in it, he examines
[03:43:57] Ben Gilbert: what of these seven possible powers is it that enables a business to achieve persistent differential
[03:44:03] Ben Gilbert: returns or put another way to become more profitable than their nearest competitor and do so on a
[03:44:09] Ben Gilbert: durable sustainable basis. And the seven are counter positioning scale economies switching costs,
[03:44:15] Ben Gilbert: network economies, process power branding and cornered resource. Well, it definitely wasn't counter
[03:44:22] David Rezenthal: positioning because Coke is the real thing. Was the first Pepsi master of counter positioning. Coke
[03:44:29] David Rezenthal: is the incumbent. Yeah. Coke was mostly getting counter positioned. Yes. So this is a business of
[03:44:35] Ben Gilbert: scale economies. Everything about this business is scale economies. The amount that they can
[03:44:39] Ben Gilbert: amortize their advertising over. It's just an amortization scale economies business period. They can
[03:44:46] Ben Gilbert: manufacture and distribute things cheaper than you can to weigh more people than you can and good
[03:44:51] Ben Gilbert: luck catching up. And like they're going to have another hundred years in them because of that
[03:44:56] Ben Gilbert: advantage that they've built up. Yep. All of the things. Yep. And perhaps the most important might
[03:45:02] David Rezenthal: be the first thing you said of amortizing their advertising spend over the life of the company.
[03:45:07] David Rezenthal: They can afford to just pour massive, massive, massive sums into marketing. This is why it was
[03:45:12] David Rezenthal: such a big deal when in the 70s with the Pepsi challenge Pepsi started outspending coke in marketing.
[03:45:19] David Rezenthal: If you are really astutely paying attention to the dynamic, that should have tipped you off of like
[03:45:24] David Rezenthal: oh, coke is in big trouble relative to Pepsi. Like if Pepsi can afford now to make the investment
[03:45:30] David Rezenthal: to spend the same or more in marketing dollars, they're going to catch up.
[03:45:35] David Rezenthal: All right. So while we're there, let's do branding because I think this is so interesting.
[03:45:39] Ben Gilbert: Normally brand power is measured by the amount. If you provide someone with two identical
[03:45:46] Ben Gilbert: of things, how much more are they willing to pay you and that delta, you know, the Tiffany over
[03:45:51] Ben Gilbert: the generic piece of jewelry is how you quantify their brand power. Coke doesn't sell things in
[03:45:57] Ben Gilbert: general that are more expensive. Pricing power isn't really a thing that's exercised in this industry
[03:46:03] Ben Gilbert: if it exists at all. Coke clearly has branding power, but rather than taking price, they keep price
[03:46:12] Ben Gilbert: low and use their latent brand power in other ways. Yeah. I mean, the funny thing is when they sell
[03:46:20] Ben Gilbert: a coke, they're selling a billboard. And so there's this flywheel element too where they want to
[03:46:25] Ben Gilbert: sell as much coke as possible, not just to keep their manufacturing costs low because it's an
[03:46:30] Ben Gilbert: economies of scale thing, but also because one more Coca-Cola floating around in the world just
[03:46:36] Ben Gilbert: reinforces the brand. Yeah. I would say, not that I disagree with anything you're saying, this
[03:46:42] David Rezenthal: just reinforces for me. This business is all about scale economies. It's all the pursuit of scale.
[03:46:49] David Rezenthal: I think this is the best interplay we've ever seen between branding power and scale economies,
[03:46:56] Ben Gilbert: where the way that they've built a lot of the brand that they have is through their scale economies
[03:47:00] Ben Gilbert: and they sort of go back and forth. I'll tell you, you can't measure their brand power through
[03:47:07] Ben Gilbert: how much more expensive it is than Pepsi because that doesn't exist. You can sure measure it though
[03:47:12] Ben Gilbert: with the outcry against new coke. Yes. That was a one-time experiment that most brands never run
[03:47:21] David Rezenthal: with good reason. Switching costs? I don't think I have any real switching costs. Sometimes I do have
[03:47:27] Ben Gilbert: to drink a diet Pepsi or a Pepsi Max and like, it's fine. It's not my preferred drink, but it's fine.
[03:47:33] Ben Gilbert: Yeah. Network economies, none. No. Process power. Maybe, but it's hard to discern from the outside.
[03:47:42] And then the last one, cornered resource. Okay. What's your opinion? Of course. It's the formula.
[03:47:51] You really think yes. But I'll tell you, it's not the formula itself. It is all of the meaning
[03:47:58] Ben Gilbert: imbued into the formula that is actually a part of their branding power. Yeah. But if Pepsi said we
[03:48:05] Ben Gilbert: broken into the vault and we got the Coca-Cola formula and we're releasing something called Pepsi C
[03:48:10] Ben Gilbert: and that is identical to Coke, something would go with it. There would be some amount of value
[03:48:16] Ben Gilbert: transferred from Coke to Pepsi. Okay. Yes. The public gives meaning to the formula even if you can
[03:48:23] Ben Gilbert: synthetically create something that tastes exactly the same as Coca-Cola. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to
[03:48:29] David Rezenthal: take the exact opposite position on this argument. I know. You've been texting me all week that you
[03:48:34] Ben Gilbert: think that the whole secret formula thing is a red herring. Yeah. I think there is today absolutely
[03:48:40] David Rezenthal: no value to the formula. There's not just a thought exercise. There's an actual conversation
[03:48:45] David Rezenthal: in the appendix of for God country and Coca-Cola. Mark Pendergrass in his research found John
[03:48:53] David Rezenthal: Pemberton's original formula from 1886 for Coca-Cola. He found it and he took it to his contacts
[03:48:59] David Rezenthal: at the Coca-Cola company and said, I've got it. What do you guys think? And they said, well,
[03:49:06] David Rezenthal: okay, you publish it. Let's say somebody gets a hold of this formula. What are they going to do with it?
[03:49:13] David Rezenthal: Make a drink. Okay. Great. How are you going to distribute it? Okay. We'll be, let's see.
[03:49:18] David Rezenthal: You can figure out distribution. What are you going to call it? You're going to call it Coca-Cola?
[03:49:22] David Rezenthal: Well, of course, we'll see you for that. How are you going to brand it? How are you going to invest
[03:49:26] David Rezenthal: in marketing? Basically, how are you going to get the scale of companies to do what we do?
[03:49:31] David Rezenthal: And the answer is you're not going to. And to your point about Pepsi, Pepsi's got a better formula.
[03:49:39] David Rezenthal: Well, Pepsi is a better formula one, but there actually was a case, somebody, a former Coca-Cola
[03:49:44] David Rezenthal: employee stole the formula and tried to sell it to Pepsi. This actually happened and Pepsi turned
[03:49:51] David Rezenthal: them into the FBI. What is Pepsi going to do with the formula? Pepsi's not going to market the Coca-Cola
[03:49:57] David Rezenthal: formula. These are big multinational corporations. Yep. If anything, what you've convinced me of
[03:50:02] Ben Gilbert: is that the bottlers are actually a cornered resource. Those bottlers have great distribution and
[03:50:08] Ben Gilbert: they're not bottling for anyone else. Yep. Great point. Coke handed them a license to print money
[03:50:13] Ben Gilbert: and they're doing it. Yep. I actually, I'm very curious. Can you switch teams as a bottler?
[03:50:18] Ben Gilbert: Probably not. I guess it's probably legal, but I bet nobody does. Yeah. Fascinating.
[03:50:24] Ben Gilbert: All right. Quintessence. So listeners, this is something we added earlier this year where we really
[03:50:30] Ben Gilbert: try to come up with something to land the plane. What does our takeaway from the episode? And we
[03:50:36] Ben Gilbert: already laid out why did Coca-Cola work? So this is just David in my opportunity to kind of come
[03:50:41] Ben Gilbert: up with a quippy sentence or three that is the thing that's on our mind as we're leaving the episode.
[03:50:47] Ben Gilbert: But first, David, we have to come back to the question. Could Coca-Cola be run by a ham sandwich?
[03:50:54] I think after studying all this history, I have to agree with Warren. Whoa, really?
[03:51:05] And Bill, I think it could be. Now, there have been great incredible CEOs in Coca-Cola's history,
[03:51:14] David Rezenthal: Candler, Woodruff, Gosweta. All of them have added on to what the Coca-Cola company is, I think.
[03:51:23] David Rezenthal: But if you took just Coca-Cola, yeah, I have sandwich, could run it. And in fact, it's proven by the
[03:51:30] David Rezenthal: new Coke, Devacl. All right. So I disagree. I think there were definitely periods in history, yes.
[03:51:37] Ben Gilbert: But in 1985, no. I mean, Coke had been losing share to Pepsi for 15 straight years. They did
[03:51:43] Ben Gilbert: actually need active management to do something and sort of the same thing with the obesity
[03:51:47] Ben Gilbert: crisis in the 2000s. I mean, Coke effectively bumped up against the edge of the market of humans
[03:51:55] Ben Gilbert: that it could possibly expand to. And they did actually need a different company strategy.
[03:52:00] Ben Gilbert: Now, whether that has been executed well is a different thing. I mean, it's only grown 3, 4% over
[03:52:06] Ben Gilbert: whatever the last 27 years. So if the criteria is run a high growth, successful, great place to put
[03:52:13] Ben Gilbert: money versus all the other places you could put money company, no, they haven't succeeded in doing
[03:52:18] Ben Gilbert: that. But I mean, you do have to do something rather than just be flat to anemic growth or decline.
[03:52:24] Ben Gilbert: Those are very fair points. Points taken. I would still pose the question to you. What is the single
[03:52:31] David Rezenthal: biggest revenue driver within the Coca-Cola company today? Trademark Coca-Cola. The real thing, baby.
[03:52:40] Ben Gilbert: Okay, but on to quintessence. I have two. One is it's a system, not a company. That's new for us.
[03:52:49] Ben Gilbert: I know franchises exist, but this is sort of a different thing. And I'm interested in studying
[03:52:55] Ben Gilbert: more sort of systems where it's multiple companies in a related. And two is if you really boil down
[03:53:02] Ben Gilbert: the Coca-Cola company in a nutshell, it is figuring out how to incentivize partners to sell your
[03:53:09] Ben Gilbert: product. And everyone is incentivized. The bottlers are massively incentivized. The retailers,
[03:53:16] Ben Gilbert: there's great margin there for you. The soda fountain operators, the restaurant, the billboard
[03:53:23] Ben Gilbert: owners. We didn't talk about this, but in the Great Depression, when no one was buying billboard
[03:53:27] Ben Gilbert: space, the billboard owners didn't want empty blank, sad billboards. So for free, they put Coca-Cola
[03:53:34] Ben Gilbert: ads up on it. They were the preferred thing to a white wall to have there. I mean, just everyone in
[03:53:42] Ben Gilbert: the entire ecosystem is incentivized to sell Coca-Cola on behalf of the Coca-Cola company. And that
[03:53:50] Ben Gilbert: is durable. Yes, Robert Woodruff had a mantra, an official motto within the company during his
[03:53:57] David Rezenthal: reign as company boss, that everyone who has anything to do with Coca-Cola should make money.
[03:54:05] David Rezenthal: And there you go. That is a great quintessence. Yep. Mine that I would add, repetition works.
[03:54:13] Ben Gilbert: We've studied a lot of brands on acquired. It's become a core part of what we do, especially with
[03:54:19] David Rezenthal: the luxury industry. But in the luxury industry, they're always looking for the new spin.
[03:54:27] David Rezenthal: And changing. And there are elements of repetition. Our mes is always our mes, but it's always
[03:54:34] David Rezenthal: whimsical. It's always something new. Peralexie always has a new theme every year. With Coke, it's
[03:54:40] David Rezenthal: a story of 150 years of always delicious, always refreshing. And yes, they change it up. But it's
[03:54:48] David Rezenthal: the same core thing. It's a core human need. You want something delicious and refreshing, no
[03:54:53] Ben Gilbert: matter who you are or when you are. Yep. That's my quintessence. It's great. All right. Well, cheers.
[03:55:01] David Rezenthal: It's a sugar water company, David. They make a drink of sugar water that's not good for you.
[03:55:07] Ben Gilbert: And they built with the most incredible brands of all time. But it's always delicious and always
[03:55:12] David Rezenthal: refreshing. It's not good for us. It's not good for the planet. And it's delicious and refreshing.
[03:55:17] Ben Gilbert: Are you trying to tell me that I could sell sugar water for the rest of my life or I could come
[03:55:24] David Rezenthal: with you and change the world? I promise no world changing. But I do have some trivia. Great.
[03:55:31] A thing we didn't cover on the episode. In addition to rising to the Supreme Court and generals
[03:55:36] Ben Gilbert: soon to be presidents, you know, helping the success of the company. In 1980, the government
[03:55:42] Ben Gilbert: passed an amendment to federal antitrust law that exempted the soft drink industry.
[03:55:48] Ben Gilbert: So, Coke and Pepsi could actually grant exclusive territories to their bottlers, which you might
[03:55:53] Ben Gilbert: have been wondering, how do you get this local monopoly? Oh, yeah. How is this legal? It's like, I get
[03:55:57] David Rezenthal: to serve all of New York and all of New Jersey or whatever. Yeah. They actually have a federal
[03:56:02] Ben Gilbert: exemption from antitrust law to be able to grant monopolies. Wow. trivia number two, the
[03:56:09] Ben Gilbert: Hartzfield Jackson airport in Atlanta. Yep. Huge airport for anyone who's ever been there.
[03:56:16] Ben Gilbert: That land was once owned by the Coca-Cola company. Same actually with the Atlanta Zoo.
[03:56:21] Ben Gilbert: I mean, the Coca-Cola company does a lot of international business. So they need a big airport there.
[03:56:27] David Rezenthal: Yes. Very true. And here's my last fun piece of trivia. Around 1930, when they were really freaked
[03:56:32] Ben Gilbert: out about whether or not they'd have the ability to import the Coca-Leaves to the United States to
[03:56:37] Ben Gilbert: do the refining here. They actually leased a secret cocaine refining facility in Peru.
[03:56:43] Ben Gilbert: Yes. In Peru. They spun the factory up. It was working. The employee manufactured Coca-Cola there
[03:56:49] Ben Gilbert: and the extracted cocaine that came off as a byproduct. They had a big amount of it and they were
[03:56:54] Ben Gilbert: trying to be a good employee to the company and earn some money with it. So they sold 42 pounds of
[03:57:00] Ben Gilbert: cocaine to a narcotics broker in Paris. And the sale proceeds went in the Coca-Cola bank account.
[03:57:07] Ben Gilbert: And so there's this crazy period where Coca-Cola is freaking out. We got to hide this.
[03:57:13] David Rezenthal: So this employee wasn't trying to steal cocaine and sell it on the black market and make money.
[03:57:19] David Rezenthal: He was trying to be a good employee and increase profits for the company.
[03:57:24] That's right. And the Hoover administration would eventually grant that exception so they could
[03:57:29] Ben Gilbert: refine the Coca-Leaves here in the US. But that was just before.
[03:57:33] Wow. I have one piece of trivia. Do you know what other very large American company Coca-Cola
[03:57:41] David Rezenthal: helped put into business and was their primary and I think sole customer for the first few years
[03:57:49] David Rezenthal: of their life? No. Monsanto. Really? So Monsanto started as a saccharin manufacturer.
[03:57:59] David Rezenthal: And Coca-Cola was their first major customer and bought their entire saccharin supply. Was
[03:58:06] David Rezenthal: tab saccharin sweetened? No. This is way before. I think it was just that Coca-Cola was probably
[03:58:12] David Rezenthal: experimenting with saccharin. I don't know that they actually used it, which is odd. But yeah,
[03:58:17] David Rezenthal: this is right around the turn of the century, early 1900s. Coca-Cola was Monsanto's very first
[03:58:24] David Rezenthal: customer. Trying to create some mine stickers out there. All right. Carvouts? All right.
[03:58:34] David Rezenthal: Carvouts. Great. Oh boy. Well, on that theme, I guess, of diets, I recently redid my home gym
[03:58:45] David Rezenthal: and I got a new piece of workout gear that I'm really enjoying. Have you ever heard of a ski
[03:58:53] David Rezenthal: Erg? Oh, yeah. This thing is great. I'm neither a skier nor a roer, but it is a vertical rowing machine
[03:59:01] David Rezenthal: made by Concept 2, which is the main rowing Erg machine manufacturer, but it's vertical. It's
[03:59:08] David Rezenthal: attached to your wall. It takes up no space. And the movement that you do is cross country skiing.
[03:59:13] David Rezenthal: You reach above you, you grab the handles, and then you pull down your cross country skiing.
[03:59:17] David Rezenthal: It's great because my primary form of exercise these days is running. And on my off days, I've been
[03:59:22] David Rezenthal: looking for like, okay, one another thing I can do that's not my lower body. So I was looking at a
[03:59:28] David Rezenthal: rowing machine, but like, it takes up a lot of space. I don't have a lot of space down in my gym.
[03:59:32] David Rezenthal: I went with the ski. I'm very happy with it. I'm with you for multiple days ahead of the super
[03:59:37] Ben Gilbert: bulls. So I'll have to give it a shot when I'm staying at your house. And then one more bonus carve
[03:59:42] David Rezenthal: out in my ongoing video gaming saga with my older daughter. I downloaded Smash Brothers Ultimate
[03:59:48] David Rezenthal: to her switch. And so we've been playing that. She really likes to be a princess, of course,
[03:59:55] David Rezenthal: and to quote unquote, fight the bunny. She calls Pikachu the bunny. So she's always like, I want to
[04:00:01] David Rezenthal: fight the bunny. Pikachu is bouncy. He kind of looks like a bunny. You know, I get it.
[04:00:08] Ben Gilbert: Awesome. I've got three friend of the show Claude for reading leases. Oh nice.
[04:00:16] David Rezenthal: I just signed a lease on acquired North, moving out of the basement and getting a studio next year.
[04:00:23] Ben Gilbert: And big news. It didn't warrant real lawyers looking at it. And so I gave it a pass. And I
[04:00:30] Ben Gilbert: asked Claude, is there anything that's wrong in here? And it flagged a few things for me that I
[04:00:34] Ben Gilbert: found quite helpful. So I don't know if anyone's told you this yet, but I think AI is the future.
[04:00:38] Ben Gilbert: And it was quite helpful for me. Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life? Or do you
[04:00:43] David Rezenthal: want to? That's right. Two is my current favorite running shoes are the Nike Vomero Plus,
[04:00:49] Ben Gilbert: which seems to be the replacement for my previous favorite, the invincible line. So big fan of the
[04:00:55] Ben Gilbert: Vomero Plus. And then the music I'm digging right now is an artist called Hermannos Gutierrez.
[04:01:03] Ben Gilbert: My good friend Andy Sparks recently stayed at my house and put this on. Oh, we were hanging out
[04:01:07] Ben Gilbert: one morning and it is a fantastic chill music. So I highly recommend it. Excellent.

[04:02:12] Ben Gilbert: he is the one who brought up that thought experiment that I did not know about or I guess remember
[04:02:17] Ben Gilbert: from the first time I read poor Charlie's all maniac. Yeah, when you brought it up, I remembered it,
[04:02:22] David Rezenthal: but I had completely forgotten. Same to Bill Combs, who is the past president of the Coca Cola
[04:02:28] Ben Gilbert: collectors club, the largest collectors club in the world. But it's great. I talked to Bill and he had
