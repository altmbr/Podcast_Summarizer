[00:00:00] You need to vision cast.
[00:00:02] Jen Abel: You need to sell to a gap.
[00:00:03] Jen Abel: Don't sell to a problem.
[00:00:04] Jen Abel: When you're selling to a leader,
[00:00:06] Jen Abel: you need to be selling an opportunity.
[00:00:09] Jen Abel: The market doesn't want to be sold to.
[00:00:11] Jen Abel: They want to buy.
[00:00:11] Jen Abel: Most founders would rather get 10, 10 K deals
[00:00:14] Lenny (Host): than lose nine and get one 100 K deal.
[00:00:17] Lenny (Host): In the very early days,
[00:00:18] Lenny (Host): people will discount till the cows come home
[00:00:21] Jen Abel: because they think that's the way to get a deal done.
[00:00:24] Jen Abel: The best clients are not going to do that to you.
[00:00:27] Jen Abel: If they're sitting there nickel and diamond,
[00:00:29] Jen Abel: they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.
[00:00:31] Jen Abel: It might be giving you a false sense of success
[00:00:33] Lenny (Host): and product market fit.
[00:00:34] Jen Abel: As soon as you become a comparison,
[00:00:36] Jen Abel: as soon as you become one of three
[00:00:38] Jen Abel: that they're testing out,
[00:00:39] Jen Abel: you've already sort of lost.
[00:00:41] Jen Abel: It's all about differentiation.
[00:00:43] Jen Abel: Here's what you will be able to do tomorrow
[00:00:46] Jen Abel: because of how we're going to serve you today.
[00:00:48] Lenny (Host): Something else that you talk about
[00:00:50] Lenny (Host): is that enterprise sales is very creative.
[00:00:51] Lenny (Host): It's more of an art.
[00:00:52] Jen Abel: It's all about deal crafting.
[00:00:54] Jen Abel: It is a relationship you're building with someone.
[00:00:57] Jen Abel: If they know they can call on you,
[00:00:59] Jen Abel: people will turn over rocks for you.
[00:01:02] Jen Abel: I have a client at a Fortune 10 company
[00:01:05] Jen Abel: where I was like,
[00:01:05] Jen Abel: it's so important we get the deal done this year.
[00:01:07] Jen Abel: Is that possible?
[00:01:08] Jen Abel: And she's like, it's a tall order,
[00:01:10] Jen Abel: but like, if it's going to help you, let's do it.
[00:01:11] Jen Abel: These are how enterprise deals get done.
[00:01:13] Jen Abel: It's relationships.
[00:01:15] Jen Abel: What's kind of like the state of the art
[00:01:16] Lenny (Host): on go-to-market outbound tooling?
[00:01:18] Lenny (Host): I don't use a tool.
[00:01:19] Jen Abel: The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling
[00:01:22] Jen Abel: from the same databases.
[00:01:24] Jen Abel: I want to email someone not in the database
[00:01:26] Jen Abel: that's getting hit by a million folks.
[00:01:28] Jen Abel: I want to take a back door in,
[00:01:29] Jen Abel: not the front door where everyone else is, trick or treating.
[00:01:33] Today, my guest is Jen Able, co-founder of Jellyfish
[00:01:36] Lenny (Host): where she and her team help early-state founders learn
[00:01:39] Lenny (Host): how to sell and how GMF enterprise at state affairs.

[00:01:52] Lenny (Host): Our first conversation was focused
[00:01:54] Lenny (Host): around getting from zero to one million ARR,
[00:01:57] Lenny (Host): essentially founder-led sales.
[00:01:59] Lenny (Host): This conversation is part two,
[00:02:00] Lenny (Host): going from around one million in ARR to around 10 million.
[00:02:04] Lenny (Host): This is the most tactical and in the weeds discussion,
[00:02:08] Lenny (Host): you will find anywhere for free
[00:02:09] Lenny (Host): on how to actually become more effective

[00:02:47] Here's a puzzle for you.
[00:02:48] Lenny (Host): What do open AI, cursor, perplexity,
[00:02:51] Lenny (Host): versel, plat, and hundreds of other
[00:02:53] Lenny (Host): winning companies have in common?
[00:02:55] Lenny (Host): The answer is they're all powered by today's sponsor,
[00:02:58] Lenny (Host): Work OS.
[00:02:59] Lenny (Host): If you're building software for enterprises,
[00:03:01] Lenny (Host): you've probably felt the pain
[00:03:02] Lenny (Host): of integrating single sign-on, skim,
[00:03:05] Lenny (Host): R-Back, audit logs, and other features
[00:03:07] Lenny (Host): required by big customers.
[00:03:09] Lenny (Host): Work OS turns those deal blockers into drop-in APIs
[00:03:12] Lenny (Host): with a modern developer platform
[00:03:14] Lenny (Host): built specifically for B2B SaaS.
[00:03:16] Lenny (Host): Whether you're a seed stage start-up

[00:04:42] Lenny (Host): Jen, thank you so much for being here.
[00:04:43] Lenny (Host): Welcome to the podcast.
[00:04:45] Lenny (Host): Lenny, it's starting to feel familiar and I like it.
[00:04:48] Lenny (Host): I should have said welcome back to the podcast.
[00:04:50] Lenny (Host): So I actually shared on Twitter that you're coming back.
[00:04:53] Lenny (Host): And I had so many people ask so many questions.
[00:04:56] Lenny (Host): Clearly, there is a lot of confusion and a lot of need
[00:04:59] Lenny (Host): for learning how to get better.
[00:05:00] Lenny (Host): The stuff we're going to talk about, sales, enterprise sales.
[00:05:04] Lenny (Host): To frame the discussion, our first chat,
[00:05:06] Lenny (Host): which we're going to point people to,
[00:05:07] Lenny (Host): if they want to start there, we focused on
[00:05:10] Lenny (Host): Fenderlet sales, which is essentially the beginning phases
[00:05:13] Lenny (Host): of a startup kind of going from zero to about 100 million
[00:05:16] Lenny (Host): ARR.
[00:05:17] Lenny (Host): This discussion is on the next phase, which
[00:05:19] Lenny (Host): is going from about a million AR to about 10 million ARR
[00:05:22] Lenny (Host): in enterprise sales, not like PLG or anything like that.
[00:05:25] You have a bunch of really strong and counter-intuitive
[00:05:29] Lenny (Host): opinions and piece of advice on how to be successful at this.
[00:05:32] Lenny (Host): So I'm just going to go through a bunch of these things.
[00:05:34] Lenny (Host): We'll see where it goes.
[00:05:36] Lenny (Host): Before I get into the first one, is there anything broadly?
[00:05:37] Lenny (Host): I don't know.
[00:05:38] Lenny (Host): Is there anything broadly you want to share
[00:05:39] Lenny (Host): or anything you want to say before we dive in?
[00:05:41] No, let's dive right in.
[00:05:42] Jen Abel: OK.
[00:05:43] OK.
[00:05:43] So the first thing that I haven't heard anyone
[00:05:44] Lenny (Host): talk about before is this point that you often
[00:05:48] Lenny (Host): make that the mid-market does not exist.
[00:05:51] Lenny (Host): People often hear about enterprise companies.
[00:05:54] Lenny (Host): There's obviously SMBs and startups.
[00:05:55] Lenny (Host): There's also people just like, oh, I'm
[00:05:57] Lenny (Host): going to go after the mid-market somewhere between.
[00:05:59] Lenny (Host): You don't think that's real.
[00:06:00] Lenny (Host): Talk about your experience there, what people should know.
[00:06:03] Lenny (Host): It's fascinating because you have, if you ask someone
[00:06:05] Jen Abel: to describe the mid-market, actually,
[00:06:08] Jen Abel: if you ask someone to describe the enterprise,
[00:06:09] Jen Abel: every single person has a different answer, right?
[00:06:12] Jen Abel: It's either based off of revenue.
[00:06:14] Jen Abel: It's either based off of market cap.
[00:06:16] Jen Abel: It's based off of employee size.
[00:06:18] Jen Abel: And I think a lot of people can get lost
[00:06:22] Jen Abel: because selling to a 100 person organization
[00:06:26] Jen Abel: is a radically different game than selling
[00:06:28] Jen Abel: to a 1,000 person organization.
[00:06:31] And there's no hybrid approach.
[00:06:35] So the best way to think about it
[00:06:37] Jen Abel: is you have small business, which
[00:06:39] Jen Abel: is typically can be really powered by marketing.
[00:06:43] Jen Abel: And then you have enterprise, which
[00:06:45] Jen Abel: is typically going to be sales led.
[00:06:47] Jen Abel: If you bucket them into these two very specific silos,
[00:06:52] Jen Abel: it makes it much, much easier to understand what game you're
[00:06:55] Jen Abel: playing.
[00:06:56] Jen Abel: Now, when we talk about mid-market,
[00:06:58] Jen Abel: I usually will say, are we talking about the upper end
[00:07:01] Jen Abel: of small business?
[00:07:02] Jen Abel: Are we talking about the lower end of enterprise?
[00:07:04] Jen Abel: And most people are usually seeing the lower end of enterprise.
[00:07:07] Jen Abel: And I say, great, know your playing the enterprise game.
[00:07:10] Jen Abel: Know the type of people you need to hire.
[00:07:12] Jen Abel: Know the type of ACV they need, because it makes it
[00:07:14] Jen Abel: a lot easier than trying to have this middle ground that
[00:07:18] Jen Abel: catches everything that doesn't distinctly define
[00:07:20] Jen Abel: SMB in enterprise.
[00:07:22] So I say the mid-market doesn't exist,
[00:07:23] Jen Abel: because what is a mid-market hire?
[00:07:26] Jen Abel: It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB.
[00:07:29] Jen Abel: And if you bleed those two games, you're going to lose.
[00:07:32] Jen Abel: They're so distinctly different.
[00:07:34] Jen Abel: So that's kind of my theory on it.
[00:07:36] Jen Abel: You have this chart that you shared with me that will link
[00:07:38] Lenny (Host): people to where you kind of show the number of companies
[00:07:41] Lenny (Host): within each of these segments.
[00:07:42] Lenny (Host): And there's basically nobody in this middle segment
[00:07:45] Lenny (Host): talking about that a bit.
[00:07:46] Lenny (Host): That's right.
[00:07:47] Jen Abel: And just the power laws, I mean, if you look at the fortune
[00:07:51] Jen Abel: 1,000 and then the lower end enterprise from there,
[00:07:59] Jen Abel: it trails off so fast.
[00:08:01] Jen Abel: Power laws totally exist in these large corporations.
[00:08:05] Jen Abel: And we can't be treating everyone the same.
[00:08:08] Jen Abel: This begs the question, where do you
[00:08:10] Lenny (Host): suggest companies start?
[00:08:13] Lenny (Host): There's obviously startups classically or just like innovators
[00:08:16] Lenny (Host): move fast, can make quick decisions,
[00:08:18] Lenny (Host): enterprises have all the money.
[00:08:20] Lenny (Host): Usually the advice I hear is just don't go
[00:08:22] Lenny (Host): after the fancy companies to start
[00:08:24] Lenny (Host): because they take a long time.
[00:08:26] Lenny (Host): You don't want to screw it up.
[00:08:27] Lenny (Host): What's your advice on where to start for most companies?
[00:08:30] The exact opposite.
[00:08:32] Early adopters are those logos, because they
[00:08:38] Jen Abel: have to continue to stay at the number one spot.
[00:08:41] Jen Abel: So they'll take tons of swings to continue to stay
[00:08:47] Jen Abel: in the number one spot, the hardest part.
[00:08:50] Jen Abel: So those number one logos are like,
[00:08:52] Jen Abel: if you can give me just a slight bit of alpha,
[00:08:55] Jen Abel: just a tiny bit, that's where I get promoted.
[00:08:59] Jen Abel: That's where I get the pat on the back,
[00:09:00] Jen Abel: because we are the world's leader in our industry,
[00:09:03] Jen Abel: and we cannot be disrupted there.
[00:09:05] Jen Abel: So there's this running joke,
[00:09:07] Jen Abel: where not running joke, there's this running statement
[00:09:10] Jen Abel: where a lot of VCs will say,
[00:09:12] Jen Abel: don't go after tier one logos, go learn down market,
[00:09:15] Jen Abel: or go learn from like logos
[00:09:17] Jen Abel: that don't necessarily carry a lot of weight.
[00:09:20] The ones that carry all the weight of the ones
[00:09:22] Jen Abel: that are willing to take a shot and want to help, right?
[00:09:25] Because they also want to be a part of it.
[00:09:28] Jen Abel: They also want to be able to dictate the roadmap.
[00:09:30] Jen Abel: Now it's the founders job to decide what can be done
[00:09:34] Jen Abel: and what shouldn't be done,
[00:09:35] Jen Abel: but their voice takes you $100,000 deal
[00:09:39] Jen Abel: into a million dollar deal in a very short period of time.
[00:09:43] Jen Abel: It will literally guide you there.
[00:09:45] Jen Abel: So when someone says, hey, go after startups
[00:09:49] Jen Abel: such as short sale cycle, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:09:52] Jen Abel: I totally get that.
[00:09:53] Jen Abel: It's a very easy to decide, define the decision maker.
[00:09:56] Jen Abel: It's very easy, you don't have to go through procurement.
[00:09:59] Jen Abel: But in the age of AI, where it's all about
[00:10:01] Jen Abel: sucking the oxygen out of the room
[00:10:03] Jen Abel: and winning the deal and getting your foot in the door
[00:10:05] Jen Abel: as quickly as humanly possible,
[00:10:07] Jen Abel: before someone else tries to take that,
[00:10:09] Jen Abel: you want to get to the enterprises
[00:10:10] Jen Abel: fastest humanly possible.
[00:10:12] Just so folks understand what we're talking about here.
[00:10:14] Lenny (Host): When you say to your one,
[00:10:15] Lenny (Host): what's a good way to think about what's your one love is?
[00:10:17] Lenny (Host): Your one is like your Walmart, your McDonald,
[00:10:19] Jen Abel: your Nivitya, your Tesla, your Exxon mobile,
[00:10:24] Jen Abel: your United Healthcare.
[00:10:27] Jen Abel: The logos that are the leader in their space,
[00:10:31] Jen Abel: and their job is to stay in the number one spot.
[00:10:35] Jen Abel: Wow, so your advice is,
[00:10:36] Lenny (Host): because this is very counterintuitive,
[00:10:38] Lenny (Host): this is exactly what you're here not to do,
[00:10:40] Lenny (Host): your advice is go after like the Chevrons
[00:10:42] Lenny (Host): and the Moldos and the Wal-Mart as a startup.
[00:10:46] Jen Abel: Because if you can get them, that's all the proof you need.
[00:10:50] Lenny (Host): How do you approach finding someone?
[00:10:51] Lenny (Host): Let's just get tactical there.
[00:10:53] Lenny (Host): Just like say you're going after Walmart.
[00:10:54] Lenny (Host): I know this is like not like a five second answer,
[00:10:57] Lenny (Host): but just how would someone approach
[00:10:58] Lenny (Host): finding someone at Walmart to sell to?
[00:11:01] First of all, make sure the founder's involved.
[00:11:04] Jen Abel: They love, everyone loves talking to a founder.
[00:11:06] Jen Abel: So like don't, and there's,
[00:11:09] Jen Abel: we'll start with let's get the founder
[00:11:11] Jen Abel: involved as fast as soon as possible.
[00:11:12] Jen Abel: The second is you need to vision cast.
[00:11:15] Jen Abel: You need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem.
[00:11:19] There's a very big difference between problem selling
[00:11:21] Jen Abel: and gap selling.
[00:11:23] Problem selling is highly specific, more technical than not,
[00:11:27] Jen Abel: and it's the way that every salesperson
[00:11:29] Jen Abel: is going to go about it.
[00:11:30] Jen Abel: Find the problem and anchor to it.
[00:11:33] When you're selling to a leader,
[00:11:34] Jen Abel: you need to be vision casting
[00:11:36] Jen Abel: and you need to be selling an opportunity, right?
[00:11:40] Jen Abel: Which is they are here, here's where we can take you.
[00:11:44] You know that image where it's like a Mario,
[00:11:47] Jen Abel: or Mario, Mario, Mario.
[00:11:49] Jen Abel: And then there's like the mushroom
[00:11:50] Jen Abel: and then there's like Mario on blast.
[00:11:52] Jen Abel: And everyone's like, don't sell the mushroom,
[00:11:54] Jen Abel: sell Mario on blast.
[00:11:55] Jen Abel: Well, that's exactly what it's saying.
[00:11:57] Jen Abel: It's about selling the opportunity.
[00:11:59] Jen Abel: That's what gets the tier one logo's excited.
[00:12:02] Jen Abel: And that is the best thing for a founder to sell,
[00:12:05] Jen Abel: selling the vision versus the problem.
[00:12:07] Jen Abel: And also it's what gets them to want to take a swing.
[00:12:13] Jen Abel: Who wants to take a swing
[00:12:14] Jen Abel: because you can do some small problem.
[00:12:15] Jen Abel: They're not going to go to bat for that.
[00:12:17] What's an example of a vision cast
[00:12:19] Lenny (Host): in a company fork with just to make this real?
[00:12:21] Lenny (Host): What does it look like when you've done a great job?
[00:12:23] We have an ability to deliver alpha,
[00:12:25] Jen Abel: meaning we have information, we have data,
[00:12:28] Jen Abel: we have a way of working that no one else can do
[00:12:32] Jen Abel: or is going to unlock a new way of thinking for you
[00:12:36] Jen Abel: or an ability to deliver to a customer
[00:12:38] Jen Abel: or an ability to solve a problem.
[00:12:40] Jen Abel: Right now, you have an ability to access
[00:12:43] Jen Abel: this level of information.
[00:12:45] Jen Abel: I have an opportunity through our resources
[00:12:49] Jen Abel: or through this like gated data we have access to
[00:12:52] Jen Abel: to get you much further upstream
[00:12:54] Jen Abel: so that you can get information faster sooner.
[00:12:57] It's kind of like the high frequency trading
[00:12:59] Jen Abel: that one second, that one second,
[00:13:01] Jen Abel: they didn't sell all, we're doing fiber cable
[00:13:05] Jen Abel: connect connectivity, we're giving you one second
[00:13:08] Jen Abel: and alpha before everyone else.
[00:13:10] It's more of that ability and that's not problem selling,
[00:13:13] Jen Abel: that's opportunity selling.
[00:13:14] Jen Abel: I like this phrasing of just giving them alpha.
[00:13:16] Lenny (Host): That's such a simple way to imagine what this should feel like.
[00:13:19] Lenny (Host): We'll link to that image you're talking about
[00:13:21] Lenny (Host): with the Mario and you know that image?
[00:13:23] Lenny (Host): Yeah, the person that made that image,
[00:13:26] Lenny (Host): originally is Kathy Sierra, if you remember her, do you remember?
[00:13:29] Lenny (Host): So there's this person Kathy Sierra,
[00:13:30] Lenny (Host): she's from back in the day, this was a big,
[00:13:33] Lenny (Host): I don't know, the lesson she taught is you want to not
[00:13:36] Lenny (Host): sell your people on like a feature or product,
[00:13:39] Lenny (Host): you want to sell them on them becoming a superhero.
[00:13:42] Yeah, that's right.
[00:13:43] Lenny (Host): They are now a superhero because of the thing
[00:13:44] Lenny (Host): you've built for them.
[00:13:45] Lenny (Host): And so the vision here is here's how you become a superhero,
[00:13:48] Lenny (Host): and how this alpha will help you become more successful.
[00:13:50] Lenny (Host): And that's why founders are so good at selling
[00:13:53] Jen Abel: because they naturally go to vision selling and vision casting
[00:13:56] Jen Abel: versus a typical train sales person is find the problem.
[00:14:03] Jen Abel: Ask these questions and it just kills the vibe.
[00:14:05] Jen Abel: It just feels like you're talking to a sales person.
[00:14:08] Right, it's like what's your script?
[00:14:09] Jen Abel: And it's like that's not vision selling.
[00:14:11] Jen Abel: That's like playbook selling.
[00:14:12] Jen Abel: And in the age of AI,
[00:14:14] Jen Abel: it's all a lot of it is about alpha.
[00:14:17] Jen Abel: It's about speed, it's about getting access to information,
[00:14:19] Jen Abel: it's about training data.
[00:14:22] Jen Abel: And look at them, look at how the market's reacting to it.
[00:14:25] Right, it's all it's all opportunity and it's all,
[00:14:28] Jen Abel: yeah, it's all about the alpha.
[00:14:30] Jen Abel: So just to make it more concrete for people,
[00:14:33] Lenny (Host): say I'm like sales person at cursor.
[00:14:37] What would be an example of vision casting,
[00:14:39] Lenny (Host): like the obvious idea there is your team will be more productive,
[00:14:42] Lenny (Host): you'll get more dyno move faster than everybody else.
[00:14:44] Lenny (Host): Is that the big enough vision to cast?
[00:14:47] Lenny (Host): I think it may be more of like you will be able
[00:14:49] Jen Abel: to actually hire the 10x engineers
[00:14:52] Jen Abel: that you don't necessarily have access to
[00:14:54] Jen Abel: because they want to be able to use this type of tool.
[00:14:58] It's about letting them get better,
[00:15:00] Jen Abel: letting them get differentiated talent.
[00:15:04] Right, or that's probably more of what I would anchor to
[00:15:07] Jen Abel: of like this is the 10x engineers use cursor.
[00:15:12] Jen Abel: You don't, do you want access to 10x engineers?
[00:15:16] Lenny (Host): Like they won't even join your company
[00:15:17] Lenny (Host): if you're not using cursor.
[00:15:18] Lenny (Host): Yeah, like think about there's so many,
[00:15:20] Jen Abel: so many people are so specific about what they're able to,
[00:15:23] Jen Abel: especially I think especially technical folks,
[00:15:25] Jen Abel: like I'm not a technical person,
[00:15:26] Jen Abel: but I would imagine that they're not gonna go to,
[00:15:29] Jen Abel: you know, they don't like to go to these corporations
[00:15:30] Jen Abel: because we're forced to use some like incumbent tools.
[00:15:35] Lenny (Host): Going back to the,
[00:15:36] Lenny (Host): going after these larger companies,
[00:15:39] Lenny (Host): I asked your colleague Justin,
[00:15:41] Lenny (Host): what he, what he sees you do that most impacts the success
[00:15:45] Lenny (Host): that teams have with their sales process.
[00:15:47] Lenny (Host): And there's a bunch of, we're gonna touch on,
[00:15:49] Lenny (Host): but one is most founders are insecure about asking
[00:15:52] Lenny (Host): for large ACVs for charging,
[00:15:55] Lenny (Host): or they, the way he put it as most founders would rather
[00:15:57] Lenny (Host): get 10 10k deals, then lose nine and get 1 100k deal.
[00:16:02] Talk about your advice there and what you see.
[00:16:04] Lenny (Host): There are in the very early days,
[00:16:08] people will discount till the cows come home
[00:16:10] Jen Abel: because they think that's the way to get a deal done, right?
[00:16:14] Jen Abel: The best, the best clients are not going to do that to you
[00:16:19] Jen Abel: because they, they, they, they like,
[00:16:20] Jen Abel: that's a qualification criteria, right?
[00:16:22] Jen Abel: Which is like, if they're sitting there
[00:16:23] Jen Abel: nickel and diamond, you'd be like,
[00:16:25] Jen Abel: no, I don't, I don't, I don't believe it's worth this,
[00:16:28] Jen Abel: I don't believe it's worth that.
[00:16:29] Jen Abel: They're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.
[00:16:32] So when, when, when I say I'd rather get 100,000 dollar,
[00:16:37] Jen Abel: they'll then 10,000 dollar deals,
[00:16:39] Jen Abel: I'd rather have one rock star client
[00:16:42] Jen Abel: that's going to help me figure out the next stage
[00:16:44] Jen Abel: of where this is going, then 10,
[00:16:47] Jen Abel: or maybe five that are a good fit, five that are not,
[00:16:50] Jen Abel: and I still have to serve those five that are not a good fit
[00:16:52] Jen Abel: and that's going to distract me.
[00:16:55] So this is why I love enterprise sales is
[00:17:00] they're not going to do the hard work of bringing you in
[00:17:03] Jen Abel: if it's not critical, or if it's not,
[00:17:07] Jen Abel: when I say critical, it's, it's not going to,
[00:17:09] Jen Abel: it's going to impact them in a way
[00:17:11] Jen Abel: that they're going to make it successful.
[00:17:13] Jen Abel: That's what I love about enterprise sales.
[00:17:14] Jen Abel: They have the resources to ensure that it gets implemented
[00:17:19] Jen Abel: because most, and today's day and age,
[00:17:21] Jen Abel: if people are not using the tool, you just get rid of the tool.
[00:17:24] Right, so they're going to want to make sure
[00:17:25] Jen Abel: whatever they bring in what they go to bat for.
[00:17:28] Remember, they get, they go to bat once every two years,
[00:17:33] maybe once every three years,
[00:17:35] Jen Abel: you've got to make it feel incredible.
[00:17:38] Jen Abel: You've got to make it feel like they're going to be a superhero
[00:17:41] Jen Abel: going back to it.
[00:17:42] Jen Abel: Otherwise, what's the point?
[00:17:43] Jen Abel: Because the way enterprises are structured,
[00:17:47] Jen Abel: is it is designed today to make it hard to buy
[00:17:52] Jen Abel: because they want to make sure whatever you're bringing
[00:17:54] Jen Abel: and you really, really want.
[00:17:57] It gets rid of the mediocre, you know,
[00:18:00] Jen Abel: I think this would be good, and it gets to,
[00:18:03] Jen Abel: this is going to change the way we work.
[00:18:05] Jen Abel: It's going to, it's going to impact our ability
[00:18:08] Jen Abel: to capture some form of alpha.
[00:18:10] Jen Abel: However, you want to define that for them.
[00:18:12] And it's sticky because of that.
[00:18:16] So your advice here broadly is,
[00:18:18] Lenny (Host): don't pay attention to the smaller 10k-ish kind of opportunities
[00:18:22] Lenny (Host): for a bunch of reasons.
[00:18:23] Lenny (Host): One is it might be giving you a false sense of success
[00:18:26] Lenny (Host): in product market fit.
[00:18:28] Lenny (Host): Two, those companies are maybe not as innovative
[00:18:31] Lenny (Host): and won't lead you in the right direction.
[00:18:33] Lenny (Host): Three is probably discounts,
[00:18:34] Lenny (Host): just like your product and your pricing
[00:18:36] Lenny (Host): and it just gets thrown off.
[00:18:38] Yep. And also like,
[00:18:39] Jen Abel: you don't really get taken seriously for 10k.
[00:18:43] You get way more taken seriously for 100k's
[00:18:45] Jen Abel: is much harder to get 100k deal done.
[00:18:47] And like an executive use needs to be involved.
[00:18:49] Jen Abel: I'd much rather have an executive sign off on something
[00:18:52] Jen Abel: and spend two more months getting the deal done
[00:18:56] because you know that they are bought in.
[00:19:00] You know that you can now ensure
[00:19:02] Jen Abel: what kind of value do they want in one mock?
[00:19:05] Jen Abel: And maybe you have an opportunity to turn them into a user
[00:19:07] Jen Abel: which to me in today's day and age
[00:19:10] with our generation being the ones that are now the executives
[00:19:12] Jen Abel: at these corporations.
[00:19:14] Jen Abel: This is native to them.
[00:19:15] Jen Abel: Who is this true for?
[00:19:17] Lenny (Host): Is this is the advice here basically
[00:19:19] Lenny (Host): if you're trying to build a successful B2B company,
[00:19:22] Lenny (Host): everybody should be aiming towards these 100k sort of deals.
[00:19:26] Lenny (Host): Is there a world where you can be successful
[00:19:28] Lenny (Host): with 10k's for a long time?
[00:19:30] If you have a super high win rate and a massive market
[00:19:33] Jen Abel: because all you have to do is reverse engineer the math.
[00:19:35] Jen Abel: If you need to generate $100 million in revenue,
[00:19:38] Jen Abel: how many 10k deals do you need?
[00:19:41] And the expansion on a 10k deal is in parallel to that, right?
[00:19:46] Where can you go? 10 to 15?
[00:19:48] Jen Abel: If you're, that's a 50% growth, right?
[00:19:52] Jen Abel: Much easier to go to 100k to 500k
[00:19:54] Jen Abel: because they want more bodies
[00:19:56] Jen Abel: or they want more value out of you.
[00:19:58] Jen Abel: For an enterprise, they'd love to get more out
[00:20:00] Jen Abel: of an existing customer.
[00:20:01] Jen Abel: You're already trusted.
[00:20:02] Jen Abel: So it's also about the type of company
[00:20:05] Jen Abel: or if you're a venture backed,
[00:20:07] Jen Abel: you can't be selling $10,000 deals to the enterprise.
[00:20:09] Jen Abel: You'll get killed.
[00:20:10] Or you've already lost the game
[00:20:14] Jen Abel: because you're playing a small business game
[00:20:15] Jen Abel: in the wrong sector.
[00:20:17] Jen Abel: Have you seen startups you've worked with succeed
[00:20:19] Lenny (Host): in that 10k, 20k bucket?
[00:20:21] Lenny (Host): Or is it really, really rare?
[00:20:23] If they're going after the enterprise?
[00:20:25] Yeah.
[00:20:26] Jen Abel: Yes, if it's the first three months
[00:20:27] Jen Abel: and then after three months,
[00:20:29] Jen Abel: it turns into a 50k and then a 100k
[00:20:31] Jen Abel: and it ramps up quickly.
[00:20:32] Jen Abel: Sure. That makes sense because it got your foot in the door
[00:20:34] Jen Abel: and you can expand it exponentially in a healthy manner.
[00:20:38] Jen Abel: I think that that's fine.
[00:20:40] $10,000 a year, then going to 12,
[00:20:43] Jen Abel: then going to 15, the math will break.
[00:20:45] This is great.
[00:20:46] Lenny (Host): I feel like most founders listening to this
[00:20:47] Lenny (Host): are like, no, no, we're kind of in that exception.
[00:20:48] Lenny (Host): We'll be all right.
[00:20:49] Lenny (Host): 10k, we'll do 20k.
[00:20:50] Lenny (Host): That's crazy to consider 100k.
[00:20:52] Lenny (Host): Yeah, the math will break
[00:20:54] Jen Abel: and also the really good salesperson,
[00:20:58] Jen Abel: your commission on a 10k deal.
[00:21:02] You're not going to get a great salesperson.
[00:21:04] Jen Abel: They're going to want to be anchored to like,
[00:21:06] Jen Abel: how can I sell $250,000?
[00:21:08] Jen Abel: How can I sell a half a million dollar deal?
[00:21:09] Jen Abel: That's the type of person you want.
[00:21:11] Jen Abel: And this is like a big part of this
[00:21:13] Lenny (Host): is this is a good lens to force you
[00:21:15] Lenny (Host): to build the product that you can sell for 100k, 500k.
[00:21:19] Lenny (Host): Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:20] Jen Abel: And again, this is about playing that enterprise game.
[00:21:23] Jen Abel: If you're trying to sell,
[00:21:25] Jen Abel: if you know you're a small business,
[00:21:27] Jen Abel: if you're in the small business place
[00:21:29] Jen Abel: and an enterprise company comes to you
[00:21:30] Jen Abel: and is like, I like this.
[00:21:32] Jen Abel: Ensure that you structure it for an enterprise.
[00:21:35] Jen Abel: Don't play the small business game
[00:21:36] Jen Abel: with an enterprise company.
[00:21:38] Jen Abel: Talk more about that.
[00:21:39] Jen Abel: What does that mean?
[00:21:40] Jen Abel: Let's say you're PLJ
[00:21:41] and an big company like Walmart comes to
[00:21:44] Jen Abel: and is like, hey, can we get access for three of our users?
[00:21:49] Jen Abel: And they're like, this is so exciting.
[00:21:51] Jen Abel: And then they sell them the small business pricing
[00:21:54] Jen Abel: for three users to Walmart.
[00:21:57] Very, very hard now to go from those three users
[00:21:59] Jen Abel: that you just priced them at a small business way
[00:22:03] Jen Abel: to turn that into 100k
[00:22:04] Jen Abel: because now it's documented
[00:22:05] Jen Abel: what they're actually paying for this.
[00:22:07] Jen Abel: So you're stuck.
[00:22:08] Jen Abel: You've kind of like anchored yourself to this price.
[00:22:11] Jen Abel: Not to mention like, how are you gonna unlock
[00:22:15] Jen Abel: the executives high level value
[00:22:19] Jen Abel: so that you can get that
[00:22:20] Jen Abel: so you can get someone,
[00:22:22] you can get that senior executive to buy in
[00:22:24] Jen Abel: and stamp this as well.
[00:22:26] Jen Abel: Otherwise, it's just gonna be throwing it
[00:22:28] Jen Abel: on the credit card.
[00:22:29] Jen Abel: But like, again, you've just ruined your enterprise game
[00:22:32] Jen Abel: because you're anchoring to a small business price.
[00:22:34] Jen Abel: So this is why like when you bleed these two games,
[00:22:37] Jen Abel: it's very, very, very dangerous
[00:22:39] Jen Abel: because these are really smart companies.
[00:22:42] Jen Abel: They're gonna say, well, wait a second.
[00:22:44] I just paid $9,000 last year
[00:22:46] Jen Abel: and now you wanna charge me $90,000.
[00:22:48] Jen Abel: Well, what's the step change in value?
[00:22:50] Jen Abel: What's the different, what's the 10x value
[00:22:51] Jen Abel: I'm now getting?
[00:22:52] Jen Abel: That's super hard to prove.
[00:22:54] Lenny (Host): So the tip here is your initial price
[00:22:56] Lenny (Host): will really screw you if you get it wrong.
[00:23:00] Lenny (Host): And so obviously we're not gonna give people
[00:23:02] Lenny (Host): the answer and their pricing strategy fully,
[00:23:05] Lenny (Host): but just, is the advice just charged more?
[00:23:07] Lenny (Host): Or like, what would you recommend?
[00:23:08] Lenny (Host): It is enterprise companies are very used to a land
[00:23:12] Jen Abel: when I say like the first initial contract
[00:23:15] Jen Abel: to assist someone between 75K and 150K.
[00:23:19] Very used to that.
[00:23:21] Jen Abel: In fact, that's probably where you wanna start
[00:23:22] Jen Abel: because you also wanna understand where can you grow from this?
[00:23:25] Jen Abel: Start contained, don't say 150K and sell the farm.
[00:23:29] Jen Abel: Say it's 150K, here's who's gets access,
[00:23:32] Jen Abel: here's the value we're gonna deliver
[00:23:34] Jen Abel: and here's where we're going over time.
[00:23:38] You also want them to know, here's what,
[00:23:39] Jen Abel: here's what we plan to do roughly in year two, year three.
[00:23:42] Jen Abel: I know it's hard to look that far out,
[00:23:44] Jen Abel: but like plant the seed with them
[00:23:46] Jen Abel: in terms of where this is going.
[00:23:48] If you come in at $10,000,
[00:23:52] Jen Abel: it's so, even if they want to bring you in
[00:23:54] Jen Abel: and wanna spend $100K with you,
[00:23:56] they have to be able to defend that.
[00:23:58] Jen Abel: And now they see a $10,000, it can get really messy,
[00:24:03] especially because a lot of them are using AI now
[00:24:04] Jen Abel: to understand like contracts.
[00:24:06] Jen Abel: So they're gonna quickly say, oh wait,
[00:24:09] you spend $1,000 with Lenny,
[00:24:10] Jen Abel: and now Lenny's asking you for $100K,
[00:24:11] Jen Abel: great, just help me understand why or defend it.
[00:24:15] Jen Abel: I could totally see Chad GVT being like,
[00:24:17] Lenny (Host): this is interesting, you still do.
[00:24:19] Lenny (Host): Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:20] Lenny (Host): Okay, now it's $100K, what might be going on here?
[00:24:22] Lenny (Host): Totally.
[00:24:23] Jen Abel: But people don't realize how, again,
[00:24:29] Jen Abel: know the game you're playing and don't be sloppy about it.
[00:24:34] So your advice here is really interesting,
[00:24:36] Lenny (Host): there's the land they expand, expand is very important,
[00:24:40] Lenny (Host): but the landing may screw your expanding
[00:24:43] Lenny (Host): because it sets the wrong reference point.
[00:24:44] Lenny (Host): 100,000% that's exactly right,
[00:24:46] Jen Abel: you said it better than I did.
[00:24:48] And so you may see like Matt,
[00:24:49] Lenny (Host): like in theory, if you land a 10K, go to 100K,
[00:24:52] Lenny (Host): that's like an amazing NRR,
[00:24:53] Lenny (Host): everyone's gonna be really impressed.
[00:24:55] Lenny (Host): But you're saying people won't buy into that.
[00:24:58] Lenny (Host): It's gonna feel absurd and wrong and something.
[00:24:59] Lenny (Host): Unless it's defendable, all in these days defendable,
[00:25:02] Jen Abel: but who can really defend,
[00:25:03] Jen Abel: that's very hard to defend a 10X jump,
[00:25:07] Jen Abel: they're gonna wanna see 15X value.
[00:25:11] Lenny (Host): Let's talk about design partners.
[00:25:12] Lenny (Host): Oh yeah, this is something most founders try to do,
[00:25:15] Lenny (Host): they find a few folks to work with
[00:25:17] Lenny (Host): to help them build the thing.
[00:25:19] Lenny (Host): What's your advice on when to start finding
[00:25:21] Lenny (Host): to design partners, how to find design partners,
[00:25:23] Lenny (Host): what a good relationship looks like.
[00:25:24] Lenny (Host): Design partners are incredible.
[00:25:27] Jen Abel: They are the hardest logos to upsell,
[00:25:30] Jen Abel: meaning go from design partner to full rollout customer.
[00:25:33] Jen Abel: So like don't expect these people to be
[00:25:36] Jen Abel: your million dollar pipeline.
[00:25:38] Jen Abel: Expect these people to be the guide
[00:25:40] Jen Abel: to help you understand.
[00:25:43] Jen Abel: Maybe design partners could be a technology company
[00:25:48] Jen Abel: in the Fortune 1000, so they're used to experimenting,
[00:25:52] Jen Abel: they're used to technology, they're used to,
[00:25:54] Jen Abel: they were once a startup so they get it.
[00:25:56] Jen Abel: Those make really good design partners.
[00:25:57] Jen Abel: Most of the design partners that I've closed
[00:25:59] Jen Abel: are usually like technology based, right?
[00:26:03] Jen Abel: They get it.
[00:26:05] Jen Abel: And they also are excited about advancing the org
[00:26:08] Jen Abel: and also giving the team an ability
[00:26:10] Jen Abel: to have that startup feel.
[00:26:12] Jen Abel: So like, if you're a large massive corporation,
[00:26:15] Jen Abel: like Stripe, right?
[00:26:19] Jen Abel: Stripe doesn't get that startup vibe
[00:26:21] Jen Abel: as much like that 50 person startup vibe,
[00:26:23] Jen Abel: but like this can be a gift to give them that lens
[00:26:26] Jen Abel: and give them that voice and give them that excitement
[00:26:28] Jen Abel: that they don't get as a larger company.
[00:26:31] Jen Abel: But those are great types of logos
[00:26:34] Jen Abel: to be early design partners,
[00:26:36] Jen Abel: because one, they wanna make sure
[00:26:37] Jen Abel: they continue to stay on the cutting edge.
[00:26:42] Jen Abel: But two is they are to try and build something
[00:26:49] Jen Abel: without that guidance is really, really, really hard
[00:26:52] Jen Abel: because they're not using it.
[00:26:54] Jen Abel: So you need that user feedback
[00:26:58] Jen Abel: and you also need to tie that to the executive value, right?
[00:27:01] Jen Abel: So it's actually a lot, it's very hard to do.
[00:27:04] But if you can come out of it and upsell
[00:27:07] Jen Abel: a design partner to a full rollout customer,
[00:27:10] Jen Abel: such a huge win for the market,
[00:27:17] Jen Abel: for you, for your team and also for your investors,
[00:27:19] Jen Abel: because it's the hardest customer
[00:27:22] Jen Abel: to actually truly convert.
[00:27:23] Jen Abel: They've been it when it was messy.
[00:27:25] Jen Abel: They got a really, they usually got a low price point,
[00:27:27] Jen Abel: but if you again frame it, say, listen,
[00:27:30] I would love for you to be a design partner.
[00:27:31] Jen Abel: I want a little scan in the game to get you to pwn it.
[00:27:33] Jen Abel: Here's where we want to go and you'll get a discount
[00:27:37] Jen Abel: because you were in the beginning,
[00:27:39] Jen Abel: but I'm sitting the framing.
[00:27:40] Jen Abel: Here's where we wanna go with pricing.
[00:27:42] Jen Abel: Here's where we are today.
[00:27:43] Jen Abel: You'll always have 30% concession and perpetuity
[00:27:46] Jen Abel: because you were there with us on day one.
[00:27:49] So again, it's not about asking for $10,000
[00:27:53] Jen Abel: and then not expecting that design partner to upsell
[00:27:55] Jen Abel: and keep it flat because there's no growth there.
[00:27:57] Jen Abel: It's a flat, it's about getting that early design partner
[00:28:01] Jen Abel: set the framing, own the framing,
[00:28:03] Jen Abel: and let them know where you're going.
[00:28:05] Jen Abel: Again, $100,000 to these large logos,
[00:28:09] Jen Abel: if they want it, it's very easy for them to get it done.
[00:28:11] Jen Abel: There's this really interesting underlying piece of advice
[00:28:14] Lenny (Host): of finding a company that pulls you in the direction
[00:28:17] Lenny (Host): that leads to success.
[00:28:19] Lenny (Host): A company that's kind of a visionary.
[00:28:21] Lenny (Host): There's like the obvious companies
[00:28:23] Lenny (Host): that everyone's always trying to get these days open AI
[00:28:25] Lenny (Host): and then throw up and strike, I think is one.
[00:28:28] Lenny (Host): Any advice for just like picking the right early,
[00:28:30] Lenny (Host): what are signs that this is a company
[00:28:32] Lenny (Host): that will point you in the right direction?
[00:28:34] Lenny (Host): I think they have to be part of the logo that is deemed,
[00:28:40] start up friendly or in that world.
[00:28:44] Jen Abel: And then I think it's the person, right?
[00:28:47] Jen Abel: Is this person excited to give feedback?
[00:28:49] Jen Abel: Does this person buy in to where we're going?
[00:28:52] Jen Abel: Do they see this world differently with like us?
[00:28:55] Jen Abel: Do they buy, are they in locks up with the founder vision?
[00:28:57] Jen Abel: Are they excited to use a tool that's janky?
[00:29:02] Jen Abel: Because it is janky in the beginning,
[00:29:04] but they know that where this can go can be incredible.
[00:29:10] So I think it's really about the person
[00:29:12] Jen Abel: and making sure that they're aligned
[00:29:13] Jen Abel: for what they're getting into.
[00:29:15] Jen Abel: And I think a lot of people,
[00:29:18] I think a lot of sales people oversell it.
[00:29:22] Jen Abel: I think that's a common thing that happens, right?
[00:29:24] Jen Abel: And that leads to churn, that leads to frustration,
[00:29:28] Jen Abel: that leads to sometimes just canceling the contract.
[00:29:30] Jen Abel: They oversell the initial kind of design partner
[00:29:33] Lenny (Host): or state of the project.
[00:29:34] Lenny (Host): They oversell everything, yeah, design partner
[00:29:35] Jen Abel: or even full rollout.
[00:29:36] Jen Abel: And it's so, so important to tell them,
[00:29:38] Jen Abel: here's where we are today, here's what we cannot do,
[00:29:42] Jen Abel: which is just as important, it builds trust.
[00:29:44] Jen Abel: Here's what we will allow you to do in the next six months,
[00:29:47] Jen Abel: do you want to be on this journey with us?
[00:29:48] Jen Abel: And it's really ugly right now, right?
[00:29:51] Barely anything exists,
[00:29:53] Jen Abel: but like we would love your voice to be a part of it.
[00:29:55] Jen Abel: One of the biggest fears I think founders have
[00:29:58] Lenny (Host): is having a company pull,
[00:29:59] Lenny (Host): basically build just for their use case
[00:30:02] Lenny (Host): and then it ends up not being used by a lot of people.
[00:30:04] Lenny (Host): And so like how far do you go,
[00:30:05] Lenny (Host): feels like fixing their specific problems,
[00:30:07] Lenny (Host): any advice on just how far to go with one company?
[00:30:10] Lenny (Host): That is the founders job.
[00:30:12] Jen Abel: The founders job is to have a clear vision
[00:30:16] Jen Abel: and do not let anything delineate from that.
[00:30:19] Jen Abel: It's important to take feedback
[00:30:21] Jen Abel: in terms of what is the market's reality,
[00:30:24] but like it is the found,
[00:30:25] Jen Abel: and this is why being a founder is so hard,
[00:30:27] Jen Abel: it is the founders job to interpret that
[00:30:29] Jen Abel: because a lot of feedback you get is this is the old way,
[00:30:33] Jen Abel: this is the responding this way
[00:30:34] Jen Abel: because it's the old way of working.
[00:30:37] They want you to build this because it's the old,
[00:30:39] Jen Abel: that's how they're traditionally expecting to do that.
[00:30:42] It is not, here's where we're going,
[00:30:45] Jen Abel: this is why we're not doing that.
[00:30:46] Jen Abel: I hear you, but here's why we're not gonna do that
[00:30:48] Jen Abel: because we're gonna completely change the way you do this.
[00:30:51] Jen Abel: That is the founders job,
[00:30:53] Jen Abel: and I think we did a bunch of design partnerships
[00:31:00] Jen Abel: late last year,
[00:31:01] Jen Abel: and there was a lot of feedback given,
[00:31:06] Jen Abel: a lot of feedback given,
[00:31:08] Jen Abel: but the founder had such clarity with where he wanted to go,
[00:31:13] Jen Abel: that he was like 80% noise, 20% had I not asked this question,
[00:31:17] Jen Abel: like I wouldn't have gotten that cold
[00:31:19] Jen Abel: in terms of where they are today.
[00:31:21] Jen Abel: And like it's that 80, 20 rule,
[00:31:23] Jen Abel: where 80% of what they're gonna tell you
[00:31:24] Jen Abel: is probably going to be not related to where you wanna go
[00:31:28] Jen Abel: or based off of the old way,
[00:31:29] Jen Abel: but that 20% of like,
[00:31:32] Jen Abel: oh, I did not think about it that way,
[00:31:34] Jen Abel: that drives everything.
[00:31:35] Jen Abel: Have you seen a design partner pull a company
[00:31:37] Lenny (Host): in the wrong direction,
[00:31:38] Lenny (Host): just gonna screw their path?
[00:31:40] Lenny (Host): Have you seen that or is that pretty rare?
[00:31:42] No, I think that,
[00:31:43] Jen Abel: I don't think it's that rare
[00:31:45] Jen Abel: because we hear people complain about it all the time.
[00:31:47] Jen Abel: But I think it's more of an excuse.
[00:31:49] Jen Abel: Coming back to this question of going after the enterprise
[00:31:52] Lenny (Host): versus SMBs, and again, early advice we gave is,
[00:31:56] Lenny (Host): there's no, don't go in between,
[00:31:58] Lenny (Host): either pick SMB small company,
[00:32:00] Lenny (Host): which I know you said there's a million ways
[00:32:02] Lenny (Host): to kind of differentiate what this means,
[00:32:04] Lenny (Host): but I guess I think of employee numbers,
[00:32:07] Lenny (Host): like under some number over 1,000 is maybe enterprise.
[00:32:11] Lenny (Host): Is that like a good way to think about just like?
[00:32:13] Lenny (Host): Yeah, I mean, it depends.
[00:32:14] Lenny (Host): Are you selling proceeds or are you selling
[00:32:18] based off of usage or are you selling off of,
[00:32:21] Jen Abel: like I think it also depends on the pricey model a little bit.
[00:32:24] Jen Abel: I look at headcount too,
[00:32:26] Jen Abel: because it's just like,
[00:32:27] Jen Abel: it's just such an easy way to think about it,
[00:32:29] Jen Abel: because you can also gauge usage off that
[00:32:31] Jen Abel: and a bunch of other things.
[00:32:33] Jen Abel: But sometimes like the small companies,
[00:32:35] Jen Abel: like I think we're gonna see a lot more,
[00:32:38] Jen Abel: like a lot more larger companies become smaller
[00:32:43] Jen Abel: because of AI, not like significantly smaller,
[00:32:46] Jen Abel: but also like high margins allow them to experiment more too.
[00:32:50] That's such an interesting point you're making there
[00:32:51] Lenny (Host): that like the way we designate enterprise versus SMB,
[00:32:54] Lenny (Host): like base shift because number of employees
[00:32:56] Lenny (Host): may go down with AI.
[00:32:57] Lenny (Host): Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:32:59] Lenny (Host): So interesting.
[00:33:00] Lenny (Host): So going, so where I was gonna go with this question is,
[00:33:02] Lenny (Host): when people are deciding I'm gonna go enterprise versus
[00:33:05] Lenny (Host): I'm gonna sell to startups,
[00:33:07] Lenny (Host): like YC companies are the typical example they sell
[00:33:10] Lenny (Host): to their own YC batches,
[00:33:12] Lenny (Host): and you just brought advice of picking,
[00:33:14] Lenny (Host): okay, we go enterprise versus no,
[00:33:15] Lenny (Host): let's actually go startup.
[00:33:16] Lenny (Host): I think it's about,
[00:33:18] Jen Abel: and I read this somewhere,
[00:33:19] Jen Abel: and I whole hardly agree with it,
[00:33:21] Jen Abel: because I've seen it live.
[00:33:22] Jen Abel: I think it's about like what game does the founder best understand?
[00:33:27] Jen Abel: Are they like an incredible marketer
[00:33:29] Jen Abel: and have some like competitive edge
[00:33:31] Jen Abel: for how they can like win a massive audience?
[00:33:34] Jen Abel: I would say go SMB a marketing lead.
[00:33:37] Jen Abel: Or are they a bit more,
[00:33:40] really understand how large corporations work
[00:33:44] Jen Abel: and really excited to deliver on $100,000
[00:33:48] Jen Abel: plus type of opportunities,
[00:33:50] Jen Abel: or the value that they are building for
[00:33:53] Jen Abel: is way more relatable to an enterprise
[00:33:56] Jen Abel: versus a small business.
[00:33:57] Jen Abel: That is really interesting.
[00:33:58] Lenny (Host): I've never heard of it described that way.
[00:34:00] Lenny (Host): I think about linear,
[00:34:02] Lenny (Host): which started very startup E,
[00:34:05] Lenny (Host): and my take is they did that because
[00:34:08] Lenny (Host): changing the way it worked is really hard,
[00:34:10] Lenny (Host): and their bet was like,
[00:34:11] Lenny (Host): let's start with companies and grow with them
[00:34:13] Lenny (Host): over time, and that becomes the default
[00:34:15] Lenny (Host): in any reaction to that.
[00:34:16] Lenny (Host): I think that it sounds like that's a great way to work,
[00:34:21] Jen Abel: because that's a technical tool, right?
[00:34:22] Jen Abel: So you also need to have the right infrastructure to sell,
[00:34:27] Jen Abel: right? I think Slack,
[00:34:29] I mean, look, Slack and Microsoft Teams
[00:34:31] Jen Abel: are still battling it out at the enterprise.
[00:34:33] Jen Abel: I think it's also like how you plug in and how you integrate,
[00:34:36] Jen Abel: and do they even have the right systems to support you?
[00:34:40] Jen Abel: The thing with OpenAI,
[00:34:41] Jen Abel: and is like they didn't have to connect to anything.
[00:34:45] Lenny (Host): Say more about that.
[00:34:46] So like the value people were bringing their own use cases
[00:34:52] Jen Abel: to it, right?
[00:34:53] And it's not like they,
[00:34:55] Jen Abel: well, they can ingest and they've built that.
[00:34:58] It's a brain of thing.
[00:34:59] Jen Abel: And they started, they started, I think,
[00:35:03] Jen Abel: this is someone told me this,
[00:35:05] Jen Abel: so this could be hearsay,
[00:35:07] Jen Abel: but I believe that they had,
[00:35:09] Jen Abel: they were already speaking to CTOs,
[00:35:11] Jen Abel: even well before they released to help them explain
[00:35:14] Jen Abel: where this is all going and get their buy-in.
[00:35:17] Jen Abel: And it's much easier to get into the enterprise
[00:35:19] Jen Abel: when you're like, we won't even touch your data.
[00:35:21] We won't even touch it.
[00:35:22] Jen Abel: Just use it to solve problems.
[00:35:26] And then we can build trust and then start to integrate
[00:35:29] Jen Abel: and connect the pipes.
[00:35:32] Jen Abel: But like part of the challenge is with selling the enterprise,
[00:35:34] Jen Abel: they're like, all right, well,
[00:35:36] Jen Abel: let's connect all your consumer data and like,
[00:35:38] Jen Abel: whoa, that's extremely risky.
[00:35:41] Jen Abel: So you have to start small and low risk,
[00:35:43] Jen Abel: which is like, hey, here's,
[00:35:45] Jen Abel: what is the subset of consumers that churned?
[00:35:50] Jen Abel: Let's figure out how we could have made them happier,
[00:35:52] Jen Abel: whatever it may.
[00:35:53] Jen Abel: So that data is lower risk.
[00:35:56] Jen Abel: So again, it's also understanding your market
[00:35:59] Jen Abel: and understanding what their ability to experiment is.
[00:36:03] Jen Abel: It's interesting this distinction between opening eye right now
[00:36:06] Lenny (Host): and anthropic.
[00:36:07] Lenny (Host): I don't know if you've been seeing kind of their growth.
[00:36:09] Lenny (Host): Feels like opening eye is a very consumer.
[00:36:11] Lenny (Host): First, an anthropic is more and more winning on B2B.
[00:36:15] Lenny (Host): I saw this chart recently where they're like overtaking
[00:36:17] Lenny (Host): opening eye now on B2B.
[00:36:20] Lenny (Host): I don't know any reaction there
[00:36:21] Lenny (Host): of just like these two different approaches.
[00:36:23] Lenny (Host): I don't because most enterprises
[00:36:25] Jen Abel: I'm talking to mentioned Gemini.
[00:36:27] Jen Abel: Oh, interesting.
[00:36:28] Lenny (Host): Yeah, or Microsoft Co-Pilot.
[00:36:33] So I don't hear much about anthropic, to be honest.
[00:36:36] Jen Abel: So that might be more of like a small business startup B.
[00:36:40] Jen Abel: I don't know.
[00:36:41] Jen Abel: Or it's a different part of the organization that's using it.
[00:36:45] Jen Abel: Yeah, that's a whole discussion of bundling right there
[00:36:48] Lenny (Host): of like Slack and Teams and then just yeah,
[00:36:50] Lenny (Host): and Gemini just kind of coming in automatically.
[00:36:52] Lenny (Host): People don't have to adopt anything new.
[00:36:54] Lenny (Host): Yeah, totally.
[00:36:55] Lenny (Host): There's something else that you talk about
[00:36:57] Lenny (Host): that I love that I don't think people talk much about,
[00:37:00] Lenny (Host): which is that enterprise sales is very creative.
[00:37:03] Oh, yes.
[00:37:04] Jen Abel: Talk about that.
[00:37:06] So I personally believe that small business sales
[00:37:11] Jen Abel: is really a, I usually think it was more science than art, right?
[00:37:16] Jen Abel: It was more like figuring out what
[00:37:19] Jen Abel: didn't work, running experiments, testing and validating,
[00:37:25] Jen Abel: which I do believe.
[00:37:26] Jen Abel: That's to get to like foundations.
[00:37:29] Jen Abel: Like where do we play?
[00:37:30] Jen Abel: What do we want to do?
[00:37:31] Jen Abel: Like that early, early, early zero to one.
[00:37:33] Jen Abel: From one to 10, I think it's more of an art, right?
[00:37:38] Jen Abel: Which is how do I take my learning
[00:37:40] Jen Abel: and how do I package it up
[00:37:42] Jen Abel: where I own the framing?
[00:37:44] I can speak to very specific alpha.
[00:37:47] Jen Abel: I can vision cast and where I better understand
[00:37:54] Jen Abel: the problem over time better than the market does.
[00:37:58] And it's all about deal crafting.
[00:38:00] Jen Abel: They just need to feel like the value
[00:38:03] Jen Abel: they're getting out of it is way more than the cost.
[00:38:08] And it's sometimes about giving away things
[00:38:12] Jen Abel: that don't really cost much to you,
[00:38:14] Jen Abel: but are super expensive for them.
[00:38:15] Jen Abel: For example, hey, we're selling X tool.
[00:38:19] Jen Abel: We can build out this, we can build out Y specifically
[00:38:24] Jen Abel: for you over the next year and integrate it.
[00:38:27] Jen Abel: Because I know that you would have spent X number of dollars
[00:38:30] Jen Abel: on engineering resources
[00:38:31] Jen Abel: or you wouldn't have gotten an engineering head
[00:38:32] Jen Abel: internally to do this.
[00:38:34] Jen Abel: But we're just gonna leave it to you.
[00:38:35] Jen Abel: You gotta give us a year to build it out.
[00:38:37] Jen Abel: Again, you're not letting them sidetrack you too much.
[00:38:40] Jen Abel: You're kind of containing it.
[00:38:42] Jen Abel: We'll do that for you at no additional cost.
[00:38:44] Jen Abel: That's huge value, right?
[00:38:47] Jen Abel: Or hey, we're gonna run an event
[00:38:51] Jen Abel: and we want you at the forefront of it.
[00:38:52] Jen Abel: We want you to be a speaker, huge value, right?
[00:38:56] Jen Abel: So it's like all of these additional things
[00:38:58] Jen Abel: that add value beyond just the product,
[00:39:00] Jen Abel: but are all part of the product and the vision, right?
[00:39:04] You know, everyone keeps thinking the product
[00:39:05] Jen Abel: is just what goes into their hand.
[00:39:07] Jen Abel: The product is pricing.
[00:39:09] The product is the opportunity, the framing,
[00:39:14] Jen Abel: and not letting them compare you to something else.
[00:39:17] Jen Abel: And I know we talked that on our first call,
[00:39:18] Jen Abel: which is as soon as you become a comparison,
[00:39:21] Jen Abel: as soon as you become one of three
[00:39:23] Jen Abel: that they're testing out, you've already sort of lost.
[00:39:27] It's all about differentiation, right?
[00:39:30] And it's all about, here's what you will be able to do
[00:39:34] Jen Abel: tomorrow because of how we're gonna serve you today.
[00:39:39] So along those lines that reminds me in our first chat,
[00:39:41] Lenny (Host): you actually made this point that I've never heard anyone else make,
[00:39:44] Lenny (Host): which is that services are a really good way to start
[00:39:47] Lenny (Host): getting into the companies that were most founders here,
[00:39:50] Lenny (Host): like no, don't just like, don't do manual stuff for the company.
[00:39:54] Lenny (Host): Build a product that you can scale.
[00:39:55] Lenny (Host): Your advice to the opposite actually start with sell services.
[00:39:57] Lenny (Host): Talk about that.
[00:39:59] Enterprises the number one thing they buy services.
[00:40:02] Jen Abel: That's they know how to do it.
[00:40:03] Jen Abel: It's super easy.
[00:40:04] Jen Abel: It's they like they do it all of the time.
[00:40:06] Jen Abel: It's like the most consistent thing they do.
[00:40:08] Jen Abel: It's the largest budget item, right?
[00:40:10] Jen Abel: External resources, consultants, whatever.
[00:40:13] If they have a very immature way of understanding the problem,
[00:40:18] Jen Abel: or they've never purchased technology to solve it,
[00:40:21] Jen Abel: to some extent, right?
[00:40:24] Either one, you are doing something that's never been done before,
[00:40:28] Jen Abel: which is like, rare in today's day and age,
[00:40:32] Jen Abel: or they might just be like laggards on the journey.
[00:40:37] Jen Abel: So you have to decide, is this someone you really want to be working with?
[00:40:41] Jen Abel: And if so, selling them at service,
[00:40:44] Jen Abel: even though the technology is powering it on the back end,
[00:40:47] Jen Abel: is the fastest way to get your foot in the door.
[00:40:49] Jen Abel: It's what they know how to buy.
[00:40:52] Now, the idea is that once you sell that service,
[00:40:55] Jen Abel: once you get that foot in the door,
[00:40:56] Jen Abel: then it's to guide them towards the product.
[00:40:58] Jen Abel: Hey, you're spending so much here,
[00:41:00] Jen Abel: why don't we move it?
[00:41:01] Jen Abel: Why don't we get you to come in and leverage the tool
[00:41:04] Jen Abel: that's been powering this the whole time,
[00:41:07] and move this more into technology serving you versus the human?
[00:41:12] Well, I think this will blow a lot of people's minds.
[00:41:14] Lenny (Host): How did you, how did you, this forward deployed engineer,
[00:41:17] Jen Abel: that's exactly what they're doing, right?
[00:41:19] Like, you know, there's a lot of companies out,
[00:41:22] Jen Abel: like I'm sure open AI, and this is what someone told me,
[00:41:25] Jen Abel: they were in and talking to CTOs
[00:41:27] Jen Abel: and helping them better understand how AI
[00:41:29] Jen Abel: and their organization can better work together,
[00:41:31] Jen Abel: and it was them coaching them and educating them,
[00:41:33] Jen Abel: whether they did it for free or not, I don't know,
[00:41:35] Jen Abel: but they got their foot in the door,
[00:41:37] Jen Abel: they started to build trust,
[00:41:38] Jen Abel: and then it gets adopted.
[00:41:40] Jen Abel: This is the epitome of doing things I don't scale.
[00:41:43] Lenny (Host): That advice we always hear,
[00:41:44] Lenny (Host): this is like, okay, this is what that looks like.
[00:41:46] Lenny (Host): Like, we will solve this problem for you.
[00:41:48] Lenny (Host): We are using software to do it, and then over time,
[00:41:50] Lenny (Host): oh, you could just do this yourself.
[00:41:51] Lenny (Host): You know, it'll cost you less, you can scale this.
[00:41:53] Lenny (Host): Yeah, that's right.
[00:41:55] Jen Abel: And they don't even need to know at first,
[00:41:56] Jen Abel: that software is doing it.
[00:41:58] That could be the magic part,
[00:42:00] Jen Abel: which is like, guys, we literally,
[00:42:02] Jen Abel: we are literally doing this with our technology.
[00:42:04] Jen Abel: Today's episode is brought to you by Coda.
[00:42:07] Lenny (Host): I personally use Coda every single day
[00:42:09] Lenny (Host): to manage my podcast and also to manage my community.
[00:42:12] Lenny (Host): So I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest
[00:42:15] Lenny (Host): that's coming on the podcast.
[00:42:16] Lenny (Host): So I put my community resources,
[00:42:18] Lenny (Host): it's how I manage my workflows.
[00:42:20] Lenny (Host): Here's how Coda can help you.
[00:42:22] Lenny (Host): Imagine starting a project that works,
[00:42:24] Lenny (Host): and your vision is clear,
[00:42:25] Lenny (Host): you know exactly who's doing what,
[00:42:27] Lenny (Host): and where to find the data that you need to do your part.
[00:42:29] Lenny (Host): In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything,
[00:42:32] Lenny (Host): because everything your team needs from project trackers and OCRs
[00:42:35] Lenny (Host): to documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab,
[00:42:38] Lenny (Host): all in Coda.
[00:42:39] Lenny (Host): With Coda's collaborative all-in-one workspace,
[00:42:42] Lenny (Host): you get the flexibility of docs,
[00:42:43] Lenny (Host): the structure of spreadsheets,
[00:42:45] Lenny (Host): the power of applications,
[00:42:47] Lenny (Host): and the intelligence of AI,
[00:42:49] Lenny (Host): all in one easy to organize tab.
[00:42:52] Lenny (Host): Like I mentioned earlier,
[00:42:53] Lenny (Host): I use Coda every single day,
[00:42:54] Lenny (Host): and more than 50,000 teams trust Coda
[00:42:57] Lenny (Host): to keep them more aligned and focused.
[00:42:59] Lenny (Host): If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility,
[00:43:02] Lenny (Host): Coda can help you move from planning
[00:43:04] Lenny (Host): to execution in record time.
[00:43:06] Lenny (Host): To try it for yourself,
[00:43:07] Lenny (Host): go to Coda.io slashlennie today,
[00:43:09] Lenny (Host): and get six months free of the team plan for startups.
[00:43:12] Lenny (Host): That's c-o-d-a.io slashlennie.
[00:43:15] Lenny (Host): To get started for free and get six months of the team plan,
[00:43:19] Lenny (Host): Coda.io slashlennie.
[00:43:21] There's a lot of talk these days about this idea
[00:43:24] Lenny (Host): forward-to-played engineer,
[00:43:25] Lenny (Host): something talented,
[00:43:26] Lenny (Host): who was really famous for just essentially an engineer
[00:43:29] Lenny (Host): sitting in your office,
[00:43:31] Lenny (Host): solving problems with you,
[00:43:32] Lenny (Host): like basically as an employee,
[00:43:33] Lenny (Host): and then through that,
[00:43:34] Lenny (Host): they learn what software to build.
[00:43:36] Lenny (Host): Is that something you're seeing too?
[00:43:37] Lenny (Host): Oh, yeah.
[00:43:38] Jen Abel: I think that that,
[00:43:40] Jen Abel: a lot of companies,
[00:43:43] Jen Abel: a lot, sorry, a lot of folks that serve the enterprise,
[00:43:46] Jen Abel: they have a button, a seat in their office.
[00:43:49] Jen Abel: Like you look at these large consultancies,
[00:43:50] Jen Abel: like McKinsey,
[00:43:51] Jen Abel: they're not in their headquarters,
[00:43:52] Jen Abel: they're in their clients office all the time.
[00:43:53] Jen Abel: And the other thing interesting thing,
[00:43:55] Jen Abel: and a proof of this is,
[00:43:56] Jen Abel: how many people go to a deloitte or an accenture
[00:43:59] Jen Abel: and expect them to be a channel partner?
[00:44:02] This is exactly what this is all about,
[00:44:03] Jen Abel: which is they sell the service,
[00:44:05] Jen Abel: they come in,
[00:44:06] Jen Abel: and then they introduce,
[00:44:07] Jen Abel: hey, look at what this startup is doing over here,
[00:44:10] Jen Abel: you might want to give them a shot.
[00:44:11] Jen Abel: The problem with channel partnerships and why I don't believe them them,
[00:44:14] Jen Abel: is there are a hundred of you on this list.
[00:44:18] And you're expecting them to sell it on your behalf.
[00:44:21] Jen Abel: Biggest no-no, they're not vision casters,
[00:44:23] Jen Abel: they're not visionaries, they're consultants.
[00:44:26] But this is,
[00:44:27] that goes all towards like,
[00:44:29] Jen Abel: go find, you know,
[00:44:30] Jen Abel: I remember the startup saying,
[00:44:31] Jen Abel: oh, I'm going to go,
[00:44:32] Jen Abel: you know,
[00:44:33] Jen Abel: win over Accenture and then have them disseminate
[00:44:36] Jen Abel: into their clients and I'm like,
[00:44:38] Jen Abel: as if that's a workable strap.
[00:44:41] Okay, you know what I mean?
[00:44:42] Lenny (Host): Be helpful is let me try to summarize some of the best pieces of advice you've shared so far.
[00:44:47] Lenny (Host): And this is specifically for folks trying to go from about a million AR to about 10 million AR.
[00:44:53] Lenny (Host): And then I want to ask you just what's most different about these two stages,
[00:44:55] Lenny (Host): but let me share this first.
[00:44:57] Lenny (Host): So,
[00:44:58] Lenny (Host): advice one is,
[00:45:00] Lenny (Host): go for tier one logos earlier than you think you should,
[00:45:03] Lenny (Host): because they're early adopters,
[00:45:05] Lenny (Host): they can move fast,
[00:45:07] Lenny (Host): they can pull you in the right direction.
[00:45:08] Lenny (Host): And they're exciting esters too.
[00:45:11] Lenny (Host): Yeah, for sure.
[00:45:12] Lenny (Host): And other,
[00:45:13] Lenny (Host): and other leads are early on.
[00:45:14] Lenny (Host): And yet,
[00:45:15] Lenny (Host): and other, and other, you know, talent,
[00:45:18] Jen Abel: future employees.
[00:45:19] Jen Abel: Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:20] Jen Abel: So the counterintuitive insight here is,
[00:45:22] Lenny (Host): you think they will move slow and be too busy,
[00:45:25] Lenny (Host): but in they are actually the early adopters.
[00:45:27] Lenny (Host): That's right.
[00:45:28] Jen Abel: They have to maintain that number one spot.
[00:45:31] And also, all of the people that are in the number two, number three,
[00:45:34] Jen Abel: number four spot, all want to do what number one is doing.
[00:45:37] So it's also like tier reference ability too.
[00:45:39] Jen Abel: And the point about them being the early adopters,
[00:45:41] Lenny (Host): like the people that join the stripes and open the eyes
[00:45:44] Lenny (Host): and and throttpicks are like the like they individually love technology
[00:45:48] Lenny (Host): and love the latest stuff.
[00:45:49] Lenny (Host): So like as a human, they're like, oh, this is cool.
[00:45:52] Lenny (Host): That's exactly right.
[00:45:53] Jen Abel: I mean, with myself, aren't I?
[00:45:55] Jen Abel: That's kind of funny.
[00:45:56] Jen Abel: Oh, yeah.
[00:45:56] Jen Abel: That's a good sign.
[00:45:58] So two is, ideally, try to price closer to about 100K,
[00:46:03] Lenny (Host): like 75 to 150ish K is what you said, most enterprises are used to buying.
[00:46:08] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[00:46:08] Lenny (Host): So instead of starting or even sticking with 10K for 20K for too long,
[00:46:14] Lenny (Host): you need to make yourself go towards 75 to 150K.
[00:46:17] Lenny (Host): That's right.
[00:46:18] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[00:46:19] Jen Abel: And if you were to sell a service,
[00:46:20] Jen Abel: because I know we're talking about selling services first,
[00:46:22] Jen Abel: pro weight that over time.
[00:46:23] Jen Abel: So maybe it's 10K a month.
[00:46:25] Jen Abel: So they start to get used to what that pricing looks like.
[00:46:28] Jen Abel: So this is a way to make it feel.
[00:46:30] Lenny (Host): This is like how you get to 75 to 150K is there's a service attached to it.
[00:46:35] Lenny (Host): It's not just here's my SaaS product.
[00:46:37] Lenny (Host): It's we will solve this problem for you.
[00:46:39] Lenny (Host): Our person will be sitting there doing this for you.
[00:46:41] Lenny (Host): Yeah, or it's a technology too.
[00:46:43] Jen Abel: I mean, you can add the services.
[00:46:45] Jen Abel: I always, well, let me take that back.
[00:46:47] Jen Abel: The service, whether the services is bundled into it or not,
[00:46:51] Jen Abel: some people will unbundle it.
[00:46:52] Jen Abel: Other people will say the services is a part of it.
[00:46:54] Jen Abel: But yeah, it nets out to 75 to 150K.
[00:46:56] Jen Abel: That's right.
[00:46:57] Jen Abel: Okay.
[00:46:57] Jen Abel: And you said that it's okay to start lower
[00:46:59] Lenny (Host): on ACVs and deals, but you need to push fast towards 100K.
[00:47:04] Lenny (Host): It's going to go over a few months.
[00:47:05] Lenny (Host): Yeah, that's right.
[00:47:06] Jen Abel: Like if you can get into, if you can get into an enterprise for 10K
[00:47:09] Jen Abel: in a month, which is not doable.
[00:47:12] Jen Abel: But if you could, and you could go from 10K to 50K in four months
[00:47:16] Jen Abel: through an expansion strategy, all gained.
[00:47:19] Jen Abel: That makes sense.
[00:47:20] Jen Abel: But it's really rare and very hard to do.
[00:47:22] Jen Abel: And so there's two different paths there.
[00:47:24] Lenny (Host): One is land cheap and grow quickly.
[00:47:26] Lenny (Host): The other is move your ACV average up quickly.
[00:47:30] Lenny (Host): That's right.
[00:47:30] Lenny (Host): That's what's like both.
[00:47:31] Lenny (Host): That's the latter is probably the more common strategy.
[00:47:33] Lenny (Host): It's just keeping increasing.
[00:47:34] Lenny (Host): Yeah, because the former, you can get tripped up
[00:47:37] Jen Abel: because they could say, okay, now give me an economical price
[00:47:40] Jen Abel: for doing this for 100 people.
[00:47:42] Jen Abel: And then it all kind of evens out.
[00:47:43] Jen Abel: Because now you're at the 100K deal anyway.
[00:47:46] You know, but it's hard.
[00:47:47] Jen Abel: It's much, there's more room for error,
[00:47:49] Jen Abel: which is why I say go in and try to land 100K.
[00:47:52] Jen Abel: By the way, in our first chat,
[00:47:54] Lenny (Host): we talked a lot about the procurement process,
[00:47:57] Lenny (Host): which is what trips a lot of people up and is really painful.
[00:48:00] Lenny (Host): And I vividly remember that conversation still.
[00:48:04] Lenny (Host): So if people are having issues getting through
[00:48:06] Lenny (Host): the sales process and procurement,
[00:48:08] Lenny (Host): a lot of good advice there.
[00:48:09] Lenny (Host): And getting stuck in procurement is usually
[00:48:12] Jen Abel: because you're not speaking to a senior enough person.
[00:48:14] Jen Abel: And they don't know how to navigate it,
[00:48:16] Jen Abel: which is why I like that executive needs to be involved.
[00:48:19] Jen Abel: Because as soon as the executive picks up a phone
[00:48:21] Jen Abel: and tries to get a hold of like their buying group,
[00:48:25] things move.
[00:48:27] Right? Like when people say, oh, I'm stuck in procurement,
[00:48:29] Jen Abel: I'm like, oh, that's a, that could just be a qualification error
[00:48:32] Jen Abel: and you never get out of it because you sold to someone to junior.
[00:48:35] So that's why the 100K is such a safe zone.
[00:48:38] Jen Abel: Because even for 10K, you might have to go through procurement.
[00:48:42] So this is like the surest way to make sure that like,
[00:48:47] Jen Abel: you don't, um,
[00:48:48] Jen Abel: listen, I've seen 10K take nine months to close.
[00:48:52] Jen Abel: No way. No. Yeah. So.
[00:48:54] Jen Abel: Okay.
[00:48:55] Next piece of advice is this idea of vision casting
[00:48:59] Lenny (Host): instead of problem solving.
[00:49:00] Lenny (Host): So the advice here is instead of here's your problem.
[00:49:02] Lenny (Host): Here's how our product solves it is.
[00:49:04] Lenny (Host): Here's how you will achieve alpha in the market
[00:49:07] Lenny (Host): by adopting the software.
[00:49:08] Lenny (Host): We talked about the example of cursor where if you adopt cursor,
[00:49:11] Lenny (Host): you're going to draw the 10X engineers
[00:49:13] Lenny (Host): that are joining other companies right now.
[00:49:14] Lenny (Host): This will give you a big advantage.
[00:49:16] That's right. And yeah, it's pain versus
[00:49:18] Jen Abel: opportunity, um, especially in the age of AI.
[00:49:21] Jen Abel: And I know that that's we're moving into the next dimension.
[00:49:25] Jen Abel: It's all about solving for a gap.
[00:49:28] Jen Abel: It's seldom about, you know,
[00:49:30] Jen Abel: solving for a very, very specific problem
[00:49:33] Jen Abel: because people are trying to figure out
[00:49:34] Jen Abel: what's our AI strategy?
[00:49:35] Jen Abel: Where are we going to go with this?
[00:49:36] Jen Abel: What is the world going to look like?
[00:49:38] Jen Abel: I want to be a part of that new world.
[00:49:40] Jen Abel: So it's a great time to be doing that.
[00:49:42] Jen Abel: And then there's a bunch of advice we shared
[00:49:44] Lenny (Host): that you talked you shared about design partners.
[00:49:47] Lenny (Host): I've just had to select them.
[00:49:49] Lenny (Host): Your advice is definitely have design partners
[00:49:51] Lenny (Host): because they will help you build the right thing.
[00:49:53] Lenny (Host): But as a founder, you need to have a clear
[00:49:56] Lenny (Host): vision and sense of where you want to go
[00:49:58] Lenny (Host): and not just build everything.
[00:49:59] Lenny (Host): And they're asking you to build.
[00:50:00] Lenny (Host): That's right.
[00:50:00] Lenny (Host): Because it's important to say no, right?
[00:50:02] Jen Abel: Like, um, and that's all part of the framing,
[00:50:06] Jen Abel: right? Which is like, here's, here's,
[00:50:08] Jen Abel: we want a little skin in the game.
[00:50:09] Jen Abel: Like you set the price.
[00:50:11] Jen Abel: But here's where, here's what we're marching towards
[00:50:14] Jen Abel: in the next six to 12 months.
[00:50:16] Jen Abel: Like, are we aligned there?
[00:50:18] If we prove, if we deliver on what we say,
[00:50:21] Jen Abel: we're going to deliver our we align there
[00:50:22] Jen Abel: and do that kind of handshake.
[00:50:24] Jen Abel: Is there anything else that I missed
[00:50:26] Lenny (Host): that you think is really important for this stage?
[00:50:29] So one to 10 is no longer the founder.
[00:50:32] Maybe the founder comes in in very strategic points
[00:50:35] Jen Abel: but you need a really good enterprise sales people.
[00:50:38] Jen Abel: Right?
[00:50:40] Taking someone from small business
[00:50:42] Jen Abel: and expecting them to do enterprise sales big no no.
[00:50:45] Jen Abel: It's a different game, right?
[00:50:46] Jen Abel: That's a different game.
[00:50:47] Jen Abel: You need to understand how corporations buy.
[00:50:49] Jen Abel: You need to understand how executives think.
[00:50:51] Jen Abel: You need to better understand simply just like what
[00:50:54] Jen Abel: the enterprise business models all about
[00:50:56] Jen Abel: and like their ability to take on risk.
[00:50:59] People will bring in like super junior enterprise sales reps.
[00:51:02] Jen Abel: And I'm like, you're looking to sell to an executive
[00:51:05] Jen Abel: and you have this tent like this person
[00:51:07] Jen Abel: that's five years out of school with no corporate experience
[00:51:12] doing it.
[00:51:12] Again, where unless they have like some extremely
[00:51:18] deep experience in the industry
[00:51:20] Jen Abel: or are just like a unicorn in terms of like,
[00:51:23] Jen Abel: wow, this person can sell ice to an Eskimo kind of thing.
[00:51:27] A junior person converting an executive.
[00:51:30] Jen Abel: Again, the founders involved.
[00:51:32] Jen Abel: Maybe that's doable.
[00:51:34] Jen Abel: But usually the founder can't be involved in every deal.
[00:51:37] Jen Abel: And you need you need people that can I always say
[00:51:41] Jen Abel: you need people that can cosplay a founder.
[00:51:45] Right?
[00:51:46] Jen Abel: Which is like selling the vision,
[00:51:48] Jen Abel: getting them excited,
[00:51:50] Jen Abel: like running through a wall to get the deal done
[00:51:53] Jen Abel: and getting creative on how none of my deals look exactly the same.
[00:51:57] Jen Abel: Every deal looks different.
[00:52:00] And that's okay because every organization has
[00:52:04] Jen Abel: slightly different
[00:52:08] opportunities of where they want to go.
[00:52:09] Jen Abel: And you have to kind of build towards that.
[00:52:12] And the framing may change.
[00:52:13] Jen Abel: So it's this ability to like adapt
[00:52:16] Jen Abel: from what you're hearing and like let that compound over time.
[00:52:19] Jen Abel: But like I always say like can this person cosplay the founder?
[00:52:24] I think that that's the the best type of sales person
[00:52:26] Jen Abel: because it doesn't feel like sales.
[00:52:28] Jen Abel: It's more of the art.
[00:52:30] Lenny (Host): This is amazing advice.
[00:52:31] Lenny (Host): What is a common profile that you've seen be successful?
[00:52:34] Lenny (Host): Like what level of seniority?
[00:52:36] Lenny (Host): What kind of personality and he's traits to the core?
[00:52:38] Lenny (Host): Maybe a former founder.
[00:52:40] So you can get that.
[00:52:42] Jen Abel: Because they're used to selling, right?
[00:52:43] Jen Abel: They sold investors and they've sold employees.
[00:52:47] Jen Abel: Two is someone with no sales experience.
[00:52:49] Jen Abel: But has deep product experience or an engineer and can like
[00:52:54] Jen Abel: think about things in a unique way where you can
[00:52:57] Jen Abel: where the market's like, oh, this is so interesting.
[00:53:00] Taking a typical salesperson and putting them into a sales role
[00:53:06] Jen Abel: almost always is where people get frustrated.
[00:53:08] Jen Abel: The market, it feels salesy.
[00:53:11] Jen Abel: Like the market doesn't want to be sold too.
[00:53:13] Jen Abel: They want to buy.
[00:53:15] And I know that this is like this.
[00:53:17] Jen Abel: It's very hard to hire a really good enterprise salesperson.
[00:53:21] Jen Abel: I mean, the number of people that I've interviewed,
[00:53:23] Jen Abel: I can count on my hand the ones that I'm like,
[00:53:25] Jen Abel: I get really, really excited by.
[00:53:27] Jen Abel: It's a it's a it's almost like, you know,
[00:53:30] Jen Abel: coming across a great founder.
[00:53:32] Jen Abel: Right?
[00:53:32] Jen Abel: It's it's like, you know, it's not as it's not as common as
[00:53:35] Jen Abel: everyone expects.
[00:53:37] And I think that that's true for engineering.
[00:53:39] Jen Abel: I think that that's true for sales.
[00:53:41] Jen Abel: And I think a lot of people
[00:53:44] Jen Abel: sales is like, oh, just throw a body into it.
[00:53:46] Jen Abel: The product will do the work.
[00:53:48] Advice I often hear is don't hire kind of a senior VP of salesperson
[00:53:51] Lenny (Host): from a bigger company.
[00:53:52] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[00:53:53] Lenny (Host): You agree with that?
[00:53:54] Lenny (Host): How what's like to senior?
[00:53:55] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[00:53:56] So the bigger company thing, the brand was doing all of the work.
[00:54:01] Jen Abel: The brand built the trust.
[00:54:02] Jen Abel: You need this person to be able to build the trust.
[00:54:05] Jen Abel: They're usually the product is still so new.
[00:54:08] Jen Abel: The product is the founder in the zero to one stage.
[00:54:11] Jen Abel: The product is just starting to get like a case study.
[00:54:15] Jen Abel: You probably have maybe a few references,
[00:54:17] Jen Abel: but it's still very, very early days.
[00:54:20] Jen Abel: You need the market to believe the salesperson.
[00:54:22] Jen Abel: And you need that market to know that they're trustworthy.
[00:54:25] Jen Abel: A VP of sales at a large company, I would say,
[00:54:28] they're best suited for a large company because one to 10,
[00:54:31] Jen Abel: you're running through walls.
[00:54:32] Jen Abel: Right?
[00:54:33] Jen Abel: You have to figure out
[00:54:34] Jen Abel: you're doing a lot of convincing.
[00:54:36] Jen Abel: You're doing a lot of educating.
[00:54:38] Jen Abel: You're doing a lot of creative deocrafting.
[00:54:40] Jen Abel: A lot of owning the frame.
[00:54:42] It's not necessarily selling a product.
[00:54:43] Jen Abel: It's selling that future value.
[00:54:46] Jen Abel: Which of VP of sales at a large companies,
[00:54:48] Jen Abel: it's a very different.
[00:54:50] Jen Abel: It's a different game.
[00:54:51] Jen Abel: It's kind of like the SMB enterprise.
[00:54:52] Jen Abel: It's interesting you said when you described the profile of a great hire here,
[00:54:56] Lenny (Host): you said they don't need to have done sales.
[00:54:59] Lenny (Host): If they have done sales, what's like a number of years
[00:55:02] Lenny (Host): or kind of like what do you look for that tells you,
[00:55:04] Lenny (Host): okay, this is good fit for the first hire.
[00:55:06] Lenny (Host): I actually think it's less about experience and more about the person.
[00:55:09] Jen Abel: Like does this person make you feel good?
[00:55:10] Jen Abel: Do you want to buy from this person?
[00:55:12] Jen Abel: I think Jason Lemkin said that best.
[00:55:14] Jen Abel: Like would you want to buy from this person?
[00:55:15] Jen Abel: Can I sell you a pen?
[00:55:16] Jen Abel: The class.
[00:55:17] Jen Abel: Exactly.
[00:55:19] Do they mimic or mirror the market they're selling to?
[00:55:26] Jen Abel: It's much easier to buy from someone that looks and feels like you.
[00:55:29] Jen Abel: Then it does from somebody that's like, you know,
[00:55:33] Jen Abel: been a totally different realm.
[00:55:36] Jen Abel: And also like an executive wants to talk to another senior person.
[00:55:41] Jen Abel: Right, they don't want to talk to someone that just graduated from college
[00:55:44] Jen Abel: and it's selling them the new way of working.
[00:55:45] Jen Abel: Like what do they know?
[00:55:46] Jen Abel: So I think it's tricky.
[00:55:48] Jen Abel: I would say like,
[00:55:49] Jen Abel: you know, someone with no sales experience makes it feel different and special.
[00:55:54] Jen Abel: That's what I like about it.
[00:55:56] Jen Abel: Someone with sales experience knows how to navigate and probably qualify better.
[00:56:01] Jen Abel: But it's almost like the blend of those two things.
[00:56:05] And that's like go back to like cost playing the founder, which is like, could this person,
[00:56:10] you know, could this person like close a future employee?
[00:56:13] Right, like do they get excited about the problems they're solving internally
[00:56:17] Jen Abel: and the vision that they get to sell to?
[00:56:19] Jen Abel: This actually was a reader question.
[00:56:22] Lenny (Host): Listen to your question from Twitter.
[00:56:24] Lenny (Host): So Peter, the DNA asked, how do you make this first sales person as enthusiastic about the
[00:56:31] Lenny (Host): product as you? Is there something you can do?
[00:56:33] Lenny (Host): Is it more just they already are and you just leverage that?
[00:56:36] Lenny (Host): Incentives.
[00:56:38] Sales people love to make money.
[00:56:42] So if they know it's possible, if they know it's possible, you'll be shocked what people can get
[00:56:48] Jen Abel: done.
[00:56:49] Jen Abel: If they see how much they could make.
[00:56:52] Amazing.
[00:56:53] Lenny (Host): Right.
[00:56:54] Lenny (Host): I imagine there's still also has to be an innate excitement about the product.
[00:56:57] Lenny (Host): It's they have to believe in it.
[00:56:59] Jen Abel: They have to believe in the founder, but like incentives usually make the world go round.
[00:57:03] Jen Abel: But yeah, is this person, are they asking the right questions to the founder?
[00:57:09] Jen Abel: Are they, you know, I always, the best thing to do is have the founder join the first
[00:57:16] Jen Abel: five calls.
[00:57:17] Jen Abel: You know, after five calls, if this person has what it takes.
[00:57:20] Jen Abel: And don't be afraid to fight like one in every two sales people usually are fired.
[00:57:26] It's a very, yeah, it's like it's it's a very high failure rate.
[00:57:32] Jen Abel: Because you can tell pretty quickly how it's good.
[00:57:35] Jen Abel: You can tell or the division of the founders is just very wrong.
[00:57:39] Jen Abel: Speaking of incentives, do you have any quick advice on how to structure their comp
[00:57:43] Lenny (Host): and just like how much they earn?
[00:57:45] Lenny (Host): It's usually 50, 50.
[00:57:46] Jen Abel: So it's 50% OTE 50% so it's 50% base salary 50% OTE.
[00:57:53] Jen Abel: And then how much of the sale do they typically get?
[00:57:56] Lenny (Host): Let's say the first sales higher.
[00:57:57] Lenny (Host): It depends on the price set the size of the deal.
[00:58:00] Jen Abel: But in technology, it could be anywhere between like eight and 12%.
[00:58:05] Jen Abel: So rounds out around 10% okay.
[00:58:07] Also, when do you hire the first sales person as a round the one million error?
[00:58:12] Lenny (Host): Mark usually.
[00:58:13] Lenny (Host): Yeah, it's around that one million error.
[00:58:15] Jen Abel: Mark and I and it's it's usually when you have your first seven to 10 customers and there's some
[00:58:23] there's some pattern recognition around it that you can that you can share with somebody else.
[00:58:29] Jen Abel: It's can there's some consistencies.
[00:58:31] Jen Abel: Otherwise, it's just like that would be very hard.
[00:58:34] Jen Abel: Basically, as a founder, you have to figure out how to sell enough times
[00:58:37] Lenny (Host): so that you can show someone here's what's working.
[00:58:40] Lenny (Host): And this is the common thing I hear.
[00:58:41] Jen Abel: Well, I'm a 10 million dollar business.
[00:58:44] Jen Abel: I'm like in this small business space, you're $0 in enterprise.
[00:58:49] It's a zero to one right now in enterprise.
[00:58:51] Jen Abel: It's a totally different game.
[00:58:53] Jen Abel: It's a different value proposition.
[00:58:54] Jen Abel: It's a different deal structuring.
[00:58:56] Jen Abel: It's a different target market.
[00:58:58] It's a different risk tolerance.
[00:59:00] Jen Abel: It's it's totally different.
[00:59:01] Jen Abel: So don't don't be blindsided when it doesn't work.
[00:59:08] There's a lot of unlearning that needs to happen when you move into a new market.
[00:59:12] So the advice here is make yourself sell up until around a million error.
[00:59:17] Lenny (Host): Especially if you're trying to go enterprise selling to enterprises yourself as a founder,
[00:59:22] Lenny (Host): which is really hard.
[00:59:23] Lenny (Host): You have so much to do and you have to be selling this thing for a long time.
[00:59:25] Lenny (Host): Yep.
[00:59:26] Jen Abel: And then try and find someone that you get excited by.
[00:59:32] Jen Abel: I think it's funny.
[00:59:33] Jen Abel: If you ask the founder, are you excited by your salesperson?
[00:59:36] Jen Abel: I'm curious what the real answer is.
[00:59:38] Jen Abel: It's like, well, it's a button to see it in.
[00:59:39] Jen Abel: It was hard to hire.
[00:59:40] Jen Abel: So interesting.
[00:59:41] Yeah.
[00:59:42] Lenny (Host): I remember I think it was Jason's advice was to hire two people immediately.
[00:59:45] Lenny (Host): That's right.
[00:59:45] Lenny (Host): So you can compare them.
[00:59:46] Lenny (Host): Do you hear that?
[00:59:47] Lenny (Host): No, I've heard that.
[00:59:47] Lenny (Host): Yeah, because of the 50% failure rate.
[00:59:49] Jen Abel: I think that's exactly right.
[00:59:51] Jen Abel: So yeah, even a taller order go find two people that are good.
[00:59:58] But yeah, I think that that's right.
[00:59:59] Jen Abel: Because one and two will fail.
[01:00:01] Jen Abel: Okay, let me ask you another reader question from Hang Huang.
[01:00:06] This is kind of a different direction.
[01:00:08] Lenny (Host): So he says the biggest challenge is always cutting through the noise
[01:00:11] Lenny (Host): to get that initial meeting with the right decision maker.
[01:00:13] Lenny (Host): I'd even get their attention.
[01:00:15] Lenny (Host): It's the vision.
[01:00:16] Lenny (Host): What is the opportunity that you're selling?
[01:00:20] That if they are excited by that, they will take a call.
[01:00:25] Jen Abel: I see it all the time.
[01:00:27] And don't give away the farm.
[01:00:28] Jen Abel: Like keep to three sentences.
[01:00:31] Right?
[01:00:31] Like, and this is I know I said this on our first call,
[01:00:33] Jen Abel: but like say something counterintuitive.
[01:00:35] Jen Abel: They could feel different.
[01:00:37] Make it feel like they can learn from you by taking a 15 minute call.
[01:00:41] Right?
[01:00:43] You know, you see the standards of like, oh, I came across your LinkedIn.
[01:00:46] Jen Abel: And you know, are you looking to grow your business by 15%.
[01:00:51] Jen Abel: It's like, what kind of statement is that?
[01:00:53] Jen Abel: And this is in the in the cold email they get.
[01:00:55] Lenny (Host): Yes, it is.
[01:00:56] Lenny (Host): Awesome.
[01:00:58] Lenny (Host): So this is a good segue to another reader question from Hugo Alves,
[01:01:01] Lenny (Host): co-founder of synthetic users.
[01:01:03] Lenny (Host): Yes, what's the best advice for going from healthy inbound to targeted outbound?
[01:01:07] Lenny (Host): Healthy inbound usually is a marketing lead initiative.
[01:01:12] So that's a marketing game.
[01:01:15] It depends like what deal value you're selling or you're selling a $5,000 deal.
[01:01:18] Jen Abel: It's got to be market in lead to make that to make the engine work.
[01:01:22] Jen Abel: If you're selling a $100,000 deal, you're doing app on day one.
[01:01:26] So again, it breaks it into those.
[01:01:27] Jen Abel: This is like that blending of the, I see a blending of that question.
[01:01:30] Jen Abel: This is where you're doing small business, you know, marketing lead activities
[01:01:35] Jen Abel: or US sales lead organization selling a $100,000 deal.
[01:01:40] And the reason this important just in case it's not obvious is you're not going to make money
[01:01:43] Lenny (Host): if you're selling people are spending time closing deals that are making 10, 20K.
[01:01:48] Lenny (Host): Just the ROI on that won't work for your business model.
[01:01:51] Lenny (Host): That's right.
[01:01:51] Lenny (Host): Yep.
[01:01:51] Lenny (Host): Awesome.
[01:01:53] Lenny (Host): By the way, let me just say, Jen, this is like an incredible conversation already.
[01:01:56] Lenny (Host): We've got, oh, you saw some.
[01:01:58] Lenny (Host): Through so much, this is like exactly what I was hoping to get through.
[01:02:01] Lenny (Host): We've done, we've done through so much advice that I think is going to be so helpful to so many people.
[01:02:07] There's a, there's a few things that your partner Justin also suggested I ask you about
[01:02:11] Lenny (Host): and that I want to touch on.
[01:02:13] Lenny (Host): One is you have this question, you ask founders a lot that opens up their mind.
[01:02:18] Lenny (Host): You ask them, if you give your product away for free, would people even use this?
[01:02:23] Lenny (Host): And every founder is like, of course.
[01:02:24] Lenny (Host): And then you ask a customer this and they're like, nah,
[01:02:27] Lenny (Host): we wouldn't use this and that just blows their mind.
[01:02:29] Lenny (Host): Talk about just the power of that and how you recommend people approach this.
[01:02:33] Lenny (Host): I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer
[01:02:38] Jen Abel: and closer to the answer.
[01:02:39] Jen Abel: So I'll ask a client straight up on a call.
[01:02:42] Jen Abel: I'll say, honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year?
[01:02:46] Jen Abel: Like, is it possible?
[01:02:48] They'll give you the real answer.
[01:02:50] Jen Abel: Like, and people are afraid to ask.
[01:02:53] Jen Abel: But like, the other side is sort of, you know, if they're in it with you,
[01:02:57] Jen Abel: they don't care about that question.
[01:03:00] Right.
[01:03:00] Can't ask that question on day one.
[01:03:02] Jen Abel: But like, if you are, and we didn't talk about this, but maybe this is important.
[01:03:08] Every single enterprise deal I have done.
[01:03:13] The deal is done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text.
[01:03:18] Jen Abel: So I don't email anymore.
[01:03:20] It is a relationship you're building with someone where if my,
[01:03:24] Jen Abel: if my enterprise client called me, I'm picking up that phone immediately or I'm responding
[01:03:28] Jen Abel: them to immediately because that builds so much trust.
[01:03:31] Jen Abel: If they know they can call on you, they're going to get you to pick up and they know that
[01:03:36] Jen Abel: you're going to do everything humanly possible to make sure that this is successful.
[01:03:40] Jen Abel: People will, people will, you know, turn over rocks for you.
[01:03:46] Jen Abel: Like, I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, it's so important.
[01:03:51] Jen Abel: We get the deal done this year.
[01:03:52] Jen Abel: Like, is that possible?
[01:03:53] Jen Abel: And she's like, it's a tall order.
[01:03:55] Jen Abel: But like, if it's going to help you, let's do it.
[01:03:59] Jen Abel: Like, these are how enterprise deals get done.
[01:04:01] Jen Abel: It's relationships.
[01:04:03] Jen Abel: And it's, it's this like, and this is why I'm saying like structuring the deal.
[01:04:07] Jen Abel: Make it feel like you went to bat for them.
[01:04:09] Jen Abel: And in often, in often cases, you are going to bat for them.
[01:04:13] And structuring in a way that makes sense for them.
[01:04:16] Jen Abel: You everyone kind of just tries and page in hole,
[01:04:18] Jen Abel: page in hole in and deal structuring consistency is important for a $10,000 sub $10,000 deal.
[01:04:26] A $100,000 deal, it could, it, it very commonly will look different every time.
[01:04:32] April done.
[01:04:32] Ferdos on the podcast and she shared this really interesting insight that the reason
[01:04:36] Lenny (Host): people behave this way is the person at the company buying this thing.
[01:04:40] Lenny (Host): Their asses on the line also.
[01:04:41] Lenny (Host): Like, their reputation is on the line for this thing to work out.
[01:04:44] Lenny (Host): So they want it to go really well.
[01:04:45] Lenny (Host): That's right.
[01:04:46] Jen Abel: They have, again, it's that what they do this one in every three years.
[01:04:49] Jen Abel: One in every two years, maybe one in every five years.
[01:04:51] Jen Abel: Hell, I don't know.
[01:04:52] Jen Abel: It is not it.
[01:04:53] Jen Abel: They don't do this every year.
[01:04:55] Jen Abel: It's very rare.
[01:04:57] It's no one likes a new tool.
[01:05:00] No one.
[01:05:01] Jen Abel: Not you, not me.
[01:05:01] Jen Abel: Unless it, unless it changes everything.
[01:05:05] Jen Abel: Yeah.
[01:05:05] Jen Abel: Figma, Figma is a great example.
[01:05:07] Lenny (Host): That's lack.
[01:05:08] Lenny (Host): Everything you've touched.
[01:05:10] Lenny (Host): Everything that worked out.
[01:05:13] You said that you asked these questions that people are afraid to ask.
[01:05:15] Lenny (Host): What are some other examples of questions you often ask that people are afraid to ask?
[01:05:19] Lenny (Host): I will say, listen, this, this is a $150,000 engagement.
[01:05:25] I will co-author it with you where we can make this a little bit bigger if you need something else.
[01:05:31] Jen Abel: We can make it a little bit smaller in year one, but in year two it, it steps up.
[01:05:36] Jen Abel: Like, how do we get this done?
[01:05:38] Jen Abel: So when you go to bat, it's a win.
[01:05:41] Jen Abel: They sell them.
[01:05:43] Jen Abel: Sell them.
[01:05:43] Jen Abel: Do they like take it to the wrong side and like try and discount you?
[01:05:48] Jen Abel: I've actually never seen that because at that point you have a relationship.
[01:05:51] Jen Abel: So I, the co-authoring, the pricing is so important because they need to know that they go to
[01:05:58] Jen Abel: bat. They can say, I got this out of them if we get this deal done.
[01:06:04] Jen Abel: Right? So this is why when I say every deal looks the same.
[01:06:08] Jen Abel: You're asking great questions because it's explaining why I meant that.
[01:06:11] Jen Abel: But this is another example of why every deal in the enterprise sort of looks somewhat different
[01:06:17] Jen Abel: because a lot of it is co-authored.
[01:06:19] Jen Abel: So again, if someone wants a slightly lower price, give it to them, but maybe them lock them in a
[01:06:24] Jen Abel: little bit longer.
[01:06:25] Jen Abel: There's another point that Justin makes that you've touched on a bit, but it's when you
[01:06:30] Lenny (Host): you're no. The way he phrased it is, Jen always talks about how no is the best answer to guess
[01:06:34] Lenny (Host): because no is data that you can use. Talk about that.
[01:06:38] I am a qualification crazy person. I will not get a none another call with someone
[01:06:44] Jen Abel: because on the first call it's either a yes or a no. There's no in between.
[01:06:48] Like it is, people, humans are like we're so different and we're so unpredictable. We're
[01:06:54] Jen Abel: also so predictable at the same time. Right? Like it's very obvious if someone is excited and
[01:07:01] Jen Abel: wants to do something. It is so obvious when someone is just trying to be nice.
[01:07:06] So I will say to them on that call like I'm sort of getting the vibe that this might not be a
[01:07:11] Jen Abel: good fit or might not be good timing. Like did I miss interpret that? And they will usually say,
[01:07:16] Jen Abel: yeah, you're right. It's probably not a good and then immediate. Great. I would love to
[01:07:20] Jen Abel: stay in touch. You've just saved a relationship and you just saved yourself a ton of time.
[01:07:24] And the implication here is just to your point, you're limited on time. You don't want to be
[01:07:27] Lenny (Host): spending time going down or rather one. Yeah, exactly. I'm going to take a quick tangent on tools.
[01:07:34] Lenny (Host): What's kind of like the state of the art on go-to-market outbound tooling? I don't use a tool.
[01:07:41] Lenny (Host): Because I believe in the manual, okay, and I'll explain why. Every single note I send is
[01:07:46] Jen Abel: slightly different because like I see a picture of them and I'm like, oh, I don't know if that's
[01:07:50] Jen Abel: going to land. I'm like, oh, they actually might appreciate this. It's weird. Like visual cues
[01:07:56] Jen Abel: are so helpful. A picture is a visual cue. You know, looking at how long they've done, they've
[01:08:01] Jen Abel: been in the role, looking how long they've been at the company. I use all of these little things
[01:08:07] Jen Abel: and I don't. I sell them customized a note in a way that like people expect, which is like that
[01:08:15] Jen Abel: first like customized sentence because AI does that and everyone's doing that. So I go the opposite
[01:08:20] Jen Abel: extreme, which is like remove it. And I customize it with how I frame it or the subject line.
[01:08:29] Yeah. So it's like, I give I'm talking to someone like, like, here I might be, I might say like
[01:08:34] Jen Abel: quick question like, QQ. If I'm talking to someone that, you know, has a bit more experience,
[01:08:40] Jen Abel: I might write a little bit of a tighter note, not all low case. So like it just depends on who
[01:08:45] Jen Abel: you're speaking to. And again, this is why it's okay to spend a little bit of time on this because
[01:08:52] it's a hundred thousand dollar. It's actually a million dollars at the end of the day because a
[01:08:56] Jen Abel: hundred thousand dollar deal if you play your cards, right? Turns into a million dollar deal over three
[01:09:02] Jen Abel: to five years. I love how much you enjoy this is so fun to. So essentially, what are you doing?
[01:09:07] Lenny (Host): You're sitting on LinkedIn, finding folks to ping and then you call them one individually manually.
[01:09:13] It's so weird. Lenny, like, I have no process. I kind of just go with like, the vibe. Like, I'll read
[01:09:20] Jen Abel: an article about Tesla. And I'm like, huh, they could be interested in this. Not because that
[01:09:28] Jen Abel: article had anything to do with the problem I'm solving, but because I'm like, this feels like a good
[01:09:33] Jen Abel: Tesla day. Like it's like it's hard to describe. Like it's a very emotional thing for me. And
[01:09:40] Jen Abel: you know, not to not to my own horn, obviously, but like, I've been successful in sales.
[01:09:46] Jen Abel: And the most successful sales people can't explain why they're good at it. It just comes to them
[01:09:52] Jen Abel: naturally. It's just like an emotional thing. It's like the world's best founders. How do you be a
[01:09:58] Jen Abel: good founder? It's very, very hard to define. How do you become a good engineer? Very, very hard to
[01:10:05] Jen Abel: define. So like, I don't believe in, I don't believe in like playbooks. I don't, I like, I believe that
[01:10:14] Jen Abel: there's like a feel to it. Like I emailed, like the chief legal officer at a hedge fund once.
[01:10:20] Jen Abel: And he responded to me because I wrote to him on Saturday. I knew it wasn't going to be dizzy.
[01:10:24] Jen Abel: I made it one sentence. And it was like tweaked for him. Do you feel like this is going to be the
[01:10:31] Lenny (Host): the way as AI as DRs just kind of take over and everyone's getting billions of emails that feel
[01:10:36] Lenny (Host): AI's yes. So I guess maybe speak more there just like the is the alpha essentially just become
[01:10:46] Lenny (Host): human. Don't automate. Yeah. And the other thing you should be the thing about AI tools is they're
[01:10:51] Jen Abel: all pulling from the same databases. So I'm like, I want to email someone not in the database that's
[01:10:56] Jen Abel: getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a backdoor in not the front door where everyone
[01:11:02] Jen Abel: else is trick-or-treating, you know. And this is effective for very large deal, which is what you
[01:11:08] Lenny (Host): need to be doing anyway because it's taking takes a lot of time to do this to do it this way. Yeah.
[01:11:12] Lenny (Host): Interesting. So you're not like sitting in clay. You're not like Apollo. I don't know all those tools.
[01:11:17] Lenny (Host): You're just like finding people yourself. Yeah. Do you start with a target prospect list at least
[01:11:23] Lenny (Host): just like here's the companies that are the perfect fit for this. And let's work here.
[01:11:27] Lenny (Host): Paul in my brain because I've been doing this for so long. I like I have in my brain. I'm like
[01:11:30] Jen Abel: these are my early adopters. These are I'm going to go to after I close those logos because they
[01:11:34] Jen Abel: get excited by those logos. So it's just like experience of like, you know, you land, I don't know,
[01:11:40] Jen Abel: you you land a Walmart. You're going to go to, you know, the rest of the industry and say, hey,
[01:11:47] Jen Abel: we're working with Walmart, you know, versus like you go to, you know, some, you know,
[01:11:55] Laura and Enterprise company and they're like, wait, what do you do? What? Like I can't even comprehend.
[01:12:01] Jen Abel: Like they're also the most strategic people. Some of the most strategic is entities are out
[01:12:05] Jen Abel: these tier one logos. That's why they're tier one because they've got like super smart, like really
[01:12:10] Jen Abel: capable folks. They also extract the best talent. The best talent likes to experiment and continue
[01:12:16] Jen Abel: to improve. So it's like it's this, it's like this compound thing for someone that isn't Jen and
[01:12:21] Lenny (Host): has all this experience, say like they're founder, they're hit a millionaire are they're just like,
[01:12:25] Lenny (Host): okay, where do we find our customers? Give me advice for coming up with a, just coming,
[01:12:29] Lenny (Host): coming up with who we should go after. Yeah. So they'd be using these tools so they'd be
[01:12:33] Lenny (Host): hiring someone like a Jen. Like I know this is what you do for companies. So, you know,
[01:12:37] Lenny (Host): when proud is go hire jellyfish to help them through this but founder, the founder, I would say
[01:12:43] the the founder, this is sort of in tune with them in a way. They just have to like find it.
[01:12:51] They like it's all it's so weird to say it's all va and I hate saying it because it's like
[01:12:56] Jen Abel: it's like a commonplace thing to say but it's like there's this thing about like flow and it's like
[01:13:02] Jen Abel: some of these brands are in flow with you right now, right? Like you you you you you found this
[01:13:12] Jen Abel: insight from somewhere. Who else what's the next adjacent ring of people that like would buy into
[01:13:20] Jen Abel: that? And so what I'm hearing is just like pay attention to what's happening. What companies are
[01:13:24] Lenny (Host): and the news of companies are doing interesting things. We're the kind of the early adopters in
[01:13:28] Lenny (Host): the market. If it was just a database list and it was just about figuring out the right messaging
[01:13:33] Jen Abel: and then you know emailing folks, we would have known by that by now. That's so interesting.
[01:13:39] Lenny (Host): Okay, maybe one more question. This again is from Justin. He shares that when you hit resistance,
[01:13:45] Lenny (Host): you never argue, you reframe. If someone says we already have X solution, you'll agree and pivot
[01:13:51] Lenny (Host): and totally X is great for this thing but here's what we can do. This is why it's sell to the alpha.
[01:13:57] Jen Abel: Hey, I know I listen, that problem you just described your right. You have a tool for that.
[01:14:01] Jen Abel: We're taking you much further upstream with value. This is the opportunity I want you guys to have
[01:14:07] Jen Abel: access to. I love it. Jen, I've gone through everything I was hoping to get through. On the other
[01:14:13] Lenny (Host): hand, I feel like we could do another hour on all these things. I feel like we need to do three.
[01:14:18] Jen Abel: Yeah, we need around three on the next phase and all the things that people want to do further
[01:14:23] Lenny (Host): before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Is there anything else that you want
[01:14:28] Lenny (Host): to touch on or share? This stuff is really hard. It's very hard. Sales is also all about learning
[01:14:36] Jen Abel: very, very quickly from the rejection. The rejection is good because it's a forced learning and
[01:14:41] Jen Abel: you never want to go through that again. I don't like to use the word cringe. You can't be afraid to
[01:14:50] Jen Abel: bring you cringes like bringing your AI recorder into a call. That's cringy. But sending 15
[01:15:02] Jen Abel: notes to people that you can deliver serious value to, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid to ask the
[01:15:08] Jen Abel: hard questions. Be different. The whole game is about, this feels different. That's what people
[01:15:15] Jen Abel: want access to. Everyone commoditizes themselves. They try mimic a forward deployed engineer.
[01:15:24] Jen Abel: Just rename it. You don't have to use the same nomenclature. Everyone gets excited by the new
[01:15:31] because the new could be the next thing. The thing that changes it all. That's why I'm always like,
[01:15:38] Jen Abel: don't be better. Be different. Amazing way to end it. With that, Jen, we've reached our very
[01:15:44] Lenny (Host): exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready? Yeah.
[01:15:48] Lenny (Host): First question. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
[01:15:54] I do Twitter accounts. Oh, Twitter accounts to follow. Yeah. Okay. Like, Lenny, the day I have time to
[01:16:02] Jen Abel: read a book. Period. Period. I would love to be reading books. Cool. Twitter accounts to follow.
[01:16:11] Lenny (Host): Yeah. Obviously you. You produce some of the best content. Truthfully.
[01:16:16] Jen Abel: I appreciate it. You get into the minds of people that they're not even giving this insight on Twitter.
[01:16:25] Who else do I absolutely love? Jason Lemkin. For sales, Jason Lemkin is awesome. Awesome follow
[01:16:33] Jen Abel: for sales. Also, he had a great recording with you. So linked to that because that was a great
[01:16:40] Jen Abel: piece. I actually learned a ton from it. I love Gavin Baker. Super nuanced takes like,
[01:16:47] Jen Abel: takes a lot of like obvious statements, but like shares a lot of the non-obvious insight. He's great.
[01:16:54] Jason Cohen. Have you ever had Jason Cohen on the cast? Just in Cohen, a smart bear.
[01:16:58] Lenny (Host): Jason Cohen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's coming on the bike. Yes.
[01:17:01] Lenny (Host): Yes. At the end of the year. Oh, that's awesome. What a great plug for him right there.
[01:17:05] Jen Abel: Yeah. Those three would be great. I know they're all met, but great tips. Yeah.
[01:17:12] Lenny (Host): Next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
[01:17:16] Lenny (Host): And I said you have time to read. This is going to be embarrassing. Baywatch. Baywatch. Yeah.
[01:17:24] Jen Abel: Baywatch channel. It just is so numby. And it's like, kind of, classic.
[01:17:29] Watch. Wow. I've never heard that one before. So this is original Baywatch with this is
[01:17:34] Lenny (Host): original Hasselhoff David Hasselhoff. Yeah. Pamela Anderson. Pamela Anderson. The original cast.
[01:17:40] Jen Abel: Amazing. Yeah. Okay. Deep cut. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?
[01:17:47] So the number one thing for me right now is an app called Playground,
[01:17:52] Jen Abel: which is the pictures of my toddler that they upload into the preschool.
[01:17:58] So I can get like the daily updates on like what's going on in preschool when he's not amazing.
[01:18:04] Lenny (Host): Any that we get like emails and and Google photos. I would really. There's another one called
[01:18:10] Jen Abel: Clasco Joe. There's a few of them, but Playground's the one that this preschool's on.
[01:18:14] Jen Abel: Love Clasco Joe. I'm a small investor. Are you really? I am. That's awesome. How about that?
[01:18:20] Lenny (Host): Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to find
[01:18:24] Lenny (Host): useful in work or in life? Yeah. Be direct. Like cut the fluff. Like give me the one cent. Give
[01:18:30] Jen Abel: me the bullet. Not the paragraph. Final question. I was told that by Justin, you've never read a
[01:18:37] Lenny (Host): sales book. You've just learned to do this. If you were to read a sales book, if there was someone
[01:18:45] Lenny (Host): else out there that you look up to learn from. Is there anyone else out there in the world of sales
[01:18:49] Lenny (Host): that you most respect? I think Jason Lemkin has the strongest understanding of sales.
[01:18:56] Jen Abel: His content is unbelievable. He speaks about it clearly and cleanly. I would say he like and
[01:19:02] Jen Abel: as I mentioned, like unbelievable Twitter follow. I'm a big fan of his. I'm actually here to
[01:19:06] Jen Abel: laugh from him too. Like the 50 50 thing or a higher two sales people. He's spot on.
[01:19:12] Jen Abel: Failure rates actually probably higher than 50%. I love that guy. And he's so he's so like AI
[01:19:17] Lenny (Host): for these days. He's just building. You almost took down Repplet with his complaints. There's a whole
[01:19:23] Lenny (Host): new cycle. Yeah. He's correct. Like sometimes he says things that are like harsh, but you're like he's
[01:19:29] Jen Abel: not wrong. Love it. I got to get him back on the podcast. Yeah. Jen, this was incredible. This was
[01:19:35] Lenny (Host): everything I wanted to be. I feel like we just leveled up all the founders that have listened to
[01:19:38] Lenny (Host): this in their ability to close. We're going to just create all the economic value. And a lot of
[01:19:44] Lenny (Host): happy VCs from all the sales that will be closed as a result of the advice you shared.
[01:19:48] Two final questions where can folks find you if they want to either work with you or or follow
[01:19:52] Lenny (Host): you online? And how can listeners be useful to you? Twitter. I every new learning or
[01:20:00] Jen Abel: mishap I put right on Twitter. So it's like my personal diary and super responsive on Twitter.
[01:20:06] Jen Abel: What's your Twitter handle? Twitter handle. It's double j double j so j j e n underscore
[01:20:13] Jen Abel: a b e l. You did not make that easy for people to find you. But we were. I know. I know. I didn't.
[01:20:19] Jen Abel: In the j's that from jellyfishes that were the extra. Yeah, the double j's and then also,
[01:20:23] Lenny (Host): well, someone else had the handle. So I was like I need my name. You gotta. By the way, just tell
[01:20:27] Lenny (Host): people jellyfishes in case that might be helpful to them. Yeah. So it's a consultancy that helps folks
[01:20:34] Jen Abel: in the zero to one stage. And now I'm at general manager of enterprise at state affairs, which is
[01:20:40] Jen Abel: basically giving giving citizens and corporations and insight peek into like what's actually going
[01:20:47] Jen Abel: on inside state capital building. State policy is way more impact than on you than federal policy.
[01:20:52] Jen Abel: Federal policy is written more about incredible. I only recently learned that that's what you're
[01:20:57] Lenny (Host): doing these days and that is super impactful and important. So thank you for your work there.
[01:21:01] Lenny (Host): Steven democracy. I hope you're doing it. Jen, thank you so much for being here.
[01:21:06] Lenny (Host): Thank you so much. I need to see you in the next episode.
