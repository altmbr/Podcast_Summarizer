# [Enterprise Sales Insights: From $1M to $10M ARR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA)

## 1. Key Themes

### Theme 1: Go After Tier-One Logos Early (Counter to Conventional Wisdom)

Start with the biggest, most prestigious companies in your industry earlier than you think you should. These market leaders are actually early adopters because they need to maintain their #1 position and will take swings on innovation to preserve competitive advantage.

**Substantiation:**
- "Early adopters are those logos, because they have to continue to stay at the number one spot. So they'll take tons of swings to continue to stay in the number one spot...those number one logos are like, if you can give me just a slight bit of alpha, just a tiny bit, that's where I get promoted." - Jen Abel [[00:00:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=22s)
- "All of the people that are in the number two, number three, number four spot, all want to do what number one is doing. So it's also like tier reference ability too." - Jen Abel [[00:12:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=12m23s)

The best talent at these companies is naturally interested in cutting-edge technology, making them receptive to new solutions. Additionally, landing a Walmart or Nvidia becomes your best proof point for other enterprises.

### Theme 2: Price at $75-150K from the Start (Not $10K)

Enterprise companies expect and are comfortable with initial contracts between $75-150K. Starting too low creates anchoring problems that make expansion nearly impossible, and you won't attract quality salespeople with small deal sizes.

**Substantiation:**
- "In the very early days, people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done, right? The best clients are not going to do that to you...If they're sitting there nickel and diamond, they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them." - Jen Abel [[00:16:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=15m58s)
- "I've seen 10K take nine months to close...The landing may screw your expanding because it sets the wrong reference point." - Jen Abel [[00:24:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=24m36s)
- "If you come in at $10,000, even if they want to bring you in and wanna spend $100K with you, they have to be able to defend that. And now they see a $10,000, it can get really messy." - Jen Abel [[00:23:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=23m26s)

The math simply doesn't work for venture-backed companies selling $10K deals to enterprises - you need exponential expansion capability that only comes from starting with substantial initial contracts.

### Theme 3: Vision Cast to Alpha, Don't Problem Solve

Sell to the opportunity gap and deliver alpha (competitive advantage), not to specific problems. When selling to executives, you need to vision cast - show them how they'll achieve superiority in their market, not just solve a pain point.

**Substantiation:**
- "You need to vision cast. You need to sell to a gap. Don't sell to a problem...When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity." - Jen Abel [[00:00:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=0s)
- "It's about letting them get better, letting them get differentiated talent...this is the 10x engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10x engineers? Like they won't even join your company if you're not using cursor." - Jen Abel [[00:14:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m39s)
- "In the age of AI, it's all about alpha. It's about speed, it's about getting access to information, it's about training data." - Jen Abel [[00:14:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m7s)

This is fundamentally different from traditional sales training which focuses on finding and solving specific problems - that approach feels transactional and "salesy" in today's market.

### Theme 4: Enterprise Sales is Creative Deal Crafting, Not Playbook Execution

Every enterprise deal should look different because it's about relationships and creative structuring, not following a standard process. This is an art form requiring co-authoring deals with clients, not applying the same template.

**Substantiation:**
- "It's all about deal crafting. It is a relationship you're building with someone...Every single enterprise deal I have done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text." - Jen Abel [[00:52:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=52m44s)
- "If they know they can call on you, people will turn over rocks for you. I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, it's so important we get the deal done this year. Is that possible? And she's like, it's a tall order, but like, if it's going to help you, let's do it. These are how enterprise deals get done. It's relationships." - Jen Abel [[01:03:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h3m36s)
- "It's sometimes about giving away things that don't really cost much to you, but are super expensive for them...We can build out this, we can build out Y specifically for you over the next year and integrate it...we're just gonna leave it to you." - Jen Abel [[00:38:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=37m58s)

Success comes from making the buyer feel like you went to bat for them specifically, structuring deals uniquely for their situation while maintaining your overall pricing strategy.

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### 1. The Mid-Market Doesn't Exist

Most people segment customers into SMB, mid-market, and enterprise, but this creates confusion. There are only two games: small business (marketing-led) and enterprise (sales-led). Trying to play a hybrid "mid-market" game causes you to lose at both.

**Facts/Experience:**
- "If you bucket them into these two very specific silos, it makes it much, much easier to understand what game you're playing...When we talk about mid-market, I usually will say, are we talking about the upper end of small business? Are we talking about the lower end of enterprise?" - Jen Abel [[00:06:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=6m27s)
- "What is a mid-market hire? It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB. And if you bleed those two games, you're going to lose. They're so distinctly different." - Jen Abel [[00:07:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=7m16s)

Each segment requires completely different hiring profiles, pricing strategies, sales motions, and value propositions. Power laws mean company distribution doesn't support a meaningful middle category anyway.

### 2. Start with Services, Not Just SaaS Product

Unlike the standard advice to avoid services and focus purely on scalable SaaS, enterprises are most comfortable buying services. Selling services powered by your technology is often the fastest way to get your foot in the door.

**Facts/Experience:**
- "Enterprises the number one thing they buy services. That's they know how to do it. It's super easy...It's the largest budget item, right? External resources, consultants, whatever." - Jen Abel [[00:40:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=39m52s)
- "The idea is that once you sell that service, once you get that foot in the door, then it's to guide them towards the product. Hey, you're spending so much here, why don't we move it?" - Jen Abel [[00:40:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=40m42s)
- "Forward deployed engineer, that's exactly what they're doing, right? Like...they were in and talking to CTOs and helping them better understand how AI and their organization can better work together." - Jen Abel [[00:41:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=41m7s)

This is the epitome of "do things that don't scale" - you solve their problem with humans + software, build trust, then transition them to self-service over time.

### 3. Don't Use Outbound Sales Tools - Go Manual

While the market is flooded with AI-powered outbound tools (Clay, Apollo, etc.), the alpha comes from completely manual, customized outreach. AI tools pull from the same databases, meaning everyone is hitting the same people with similar messaging.

**Facts/Experience:**
- "I don't use a tool...The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is, trick or treating." - Jen Abel [[00:18:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=18m8s)
- "Every single note I send is slightly different because like I see a picture of them...Visual cues are so helpful. A picture is a visual cue. You know, looking at how long they've done, they've been in the role, looking how long they've been at the company." - Jen Abel [[01:07:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h7m36s)
- "I emailed, like the chief legal officer at a hedge fund once. And he responded to me because I wrote to him on Saturday. I knew it wasn't going to be dizzy. I made it one sentence." - Jen Abel [[01:10:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h10m8s)

For $100K+ deals, spending significant time per prospect is justified - these deals can become $1M+ relationships over 3-5 years, so the ROI on manual effort is massive.

### 4. Design Partners Are the Hardest to Convert (Not Your Pipeline)

Contrary to expecting design partners to become major customers, they're actually the hardest logos to upsell to full rollout customers. They've seen you at your messiest and often got significant discounts. Their value is in guiding product direction, not revenue.

**Facts/Experience:**
- "Design partners are incredible. They are the hardest logos to upsell, meaning go from design partner to full rollout customer. So like don't expect these people to be your million dollar pipeline. Expect these people to be the guide to help you understand." - Jen Abel [[00:25:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=25m17s)
- "If you can come out of it and upsell a design partner to a full rollout customer, such a huge win for the market...it's the hardest customer to actually truly convert. They've been it when it was messy." - Jen Abel [[00:27:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=26m54s)

Set clear expectations upfront about pricing trajectories with design partners, making it explicit where you're headed so the eventual upsell doesn't feel like a bait-and-switch.

### 5. Hire Former Founders or Non-Salespeople, Not Traditional Sales Reps

The best enterprise salespeople aren't trained sales professionals - they're former founders who can vision cast, or people with deep product/engineering experience who think differently. Traditional salespeople feel "salesy" to the market.

**Facts/Experience:**
- "The best type of sales person...can this person cosplay the founder? Because it doesn't feel like sales. It's more of the art." - Jen Abel [[00:52:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=52m16s)
- "Maybe a former founder. Because they're used to selling, right? They sold investors and they've sold employees. Two is someone with no sales experience. But has deep product experience or an engineer." - Jen Abel [[00:52:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=52m30s)
- "The market doesn't want to be sold too. They want to buy...Taking a typical salesperson and putting them into a sales role almost always is where people get frustrated." - Jen Abel [[00:53:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=52m58s)

One in two sales hires typically fail, so don't be afraid to fire quickly - you can tell within the first five calls if someone has what it takes.

## 3. Companies Identified

### 1. **Stripe**
- **Description:** Payment processing and financial infrastructure company, frequently cited as having technology-forward culture that makes good design partners
- **Quote:** "If you're a large massive corporation, like Stripe, right? Stripe doesn't get that startup vibe as much like that 50 person startup vibe, but like this can be a gift to give them that lens and give them that voice" - Jen Abel [[00:26:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=26m5s)

### 2. **Cursor**
- **Description:** AI-powered code editor that's become essential for top engineering talent
- **Quote:** "This is the 10x engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10x engineers? Like they won't even join your company if you're not using cursor." - Jen Abel [[00:14:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=14m39s)
- The example illustrates vision casting - you're not selling productivity, you're selling access to elite talent that won't work without these tools

### 3. **OpenAI**
- **Description:** AI research company that successfully penetrated enterprises early despite typical enterprise resistance to new technology
- **Quote:** "They didn't have to connect to anything...they were already speaking to CTOs, even well before they released to help them explain where this is all going and get their buy-in." - Jen Abel [[00:35:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=34m53s)
- Demonstrates the power of education-as-sales and starting with low-risk entry points before deeper integration

### 4. **WorkOS**
- **Description:** Developer platform for enterprise features (SSO, SCIM, etc.) - mentioned as podcast sponsor
- **Quote:** "Work OS turns those deal blockers into drop-in APIs with a modern developer platform built specifically for B2B SaaS." - Lenny (Host) [[00:02:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=2m48s)

### 5. **Figma**
- **Description:** Design collaboration tool that fundamentally changed workflows
- **Quote:** "Figma, Figma is a great example...Everything that worked out." - Jen Abel/Lenny [[01:05:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h4m57s)
- Cited as an example of a tool that actually "changes everything" - the threshold for getting enterprises to adopt new tools

## 4. Operating Insights

### 1. The "Can You Call Me" Test for Relationship Quality

True enterprise relationships are measured by whether deals get done via text message and whether you can call each other directly. If procurement is blocking you, you're talking to someone too junior.

**Quote:** "Every single enterprise deal I have done. The deal is done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text...It is a relationship you're building with someone where if my enterprise client called me, I'm picking up that phone immediately." - Jen Abel [[01:03:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h3m3s)

This is radically different from email-based, process-driven sales. When someone will "turn over rocks for you" to make a deal happen, that's when you know the relationship is real.

### 2. Ask Questions You're Afraid to Ask

Direct, almost uncomfortable questions build trust faster than dancing around issues. Ask "Are we actually going to close this year?" or "I'm sensing this isn't a good fit - did I misread that?"

**Quote:** "I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer and closer to the answer. So I'll ask a client straight up on a call. I'll say, honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year?" - Jen Abel [[01:02:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h2m23s)

No is actually the best answer because it's data you can use. Qualification should happen aggressively on the first call - if someone isn't excited, help them say no and preserve the relationship.

### 3. Co-Author Pricing with Clients

Don't present fixed pricing - collaborate on deal structure with the buyer so they feel they got something special while you hit your targets. Make them your champion by giving them wins to take back internally.

**Quote:** "I will say, listen, this is a $150,000 engagement. I will co-author it with you where we can make this a little bit bigger if you need something else. We can make it a little bit smaller in year one, but in year two it steps up. Like, how do we get this done? So when you go to bat, it's a win." - Jen Abel [[01:05:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h5m15s)

This is why every deal looks different - you're flexibly structuring around their specific constraints while maintaining overall economics.

### 4. Founder Involvement is Non-Negotiable Until $1M ARR

Don't hire your first salesperson until you've closed 7-10 customers yourself and see pattern recognition. The founder must sell until they can clearly articulate what's working.

**Quote:** "It's around that one million error mark and it's usually when you have your first seven to 10 customers and there's some pattern recognition around it that you can that you can share with somebody else." - Jen Abel [[00:58:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=58m13s)

Even after hiring, founders should join the first five sales calls to assess if the hire has what it takes. Enterprise buyers want to talk to founders anyway - "everyone loves talking to a founder."

### 5. Visual Cues Matter in Personalization

When doing manual outreach, look at profile pictures, tenure in role, and company longevity to customize not just content but tone, format, and timing of outreach.

**Quote:** "Every single note I send is slightly different because like I see a picture of them and I'm like, oh, I don't know if that's going to land. I'm like, oh, they actually might appreciate this. It's weird. Like visual cues are so helpful." - Jen Abel [[01:07:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=1h7m40s)

For example, emailing a chief legal officer on Saturday in one sentence got a response because it showed understanding of their work patterns. This level of thoughtfulness is impossible to automate.

## 5. Overlooked Insights

### 1. AI Will Actually Decrease Company Headcount, Reshaping Enterprise Definitions

There was a brief but significant comment about how enterprise company classifications will need to shift because AI will enable large companies to operate with smaller teams while maintaining high margins.

**Quote:** "Sometimes like the small companies, like I think we're gonna see a lot more, like a lot more larger companies become smaller because of AI...high margins allow them to experiment more too." - Jen Abel [[00:32:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=32m33s)

**Why This Matters:** This could fundamentally reshape B2B sales strategies. If "enterprise" stops meaning "thousands of employees," then seat-based pricing models collapse, deal qualification criteria change, and the whole distinction between SMB and enterprise pricing becomes murky. Companies building for 2025+ need to anticipate that a 100-person company might have enterprise-level budget and complexity, while a traditional 1000-person company might start looking more like SMB in their buying behavior.

### 2. Procurement Friction is a Feature, Not a Bug

Jen made a passing comment that enterprises are deliberately structured to make buying hard, which filters for only the most important solutions.

**Quote:** "The way enterprises are structured, is it is designed today to make it hard to buy because they want to make sure whatever you're bringing and you really, really want. It gets rid of the mediocre, you know, I think this would be good, and it gets to, this is going to change the way we work." - Jen Abel [[00:17:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37fKFWdrMyA&t=17m37s)

**Why This Matters:** Most founders view procurement as an annoying obstacle to overcome. But reframing it as an intentional filter that validates you're solving a critical problem changes your psychology. If procurement is easy, you're probably not solving something important enough. This suggests leaning into the difficulty - if an executive won't push through procurement friction for you, you haven't achieved true buy-in and should disqualify the deal earlier. This insight could save founders months of chasing deals that were never real opportunities.
