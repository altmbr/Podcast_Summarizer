[00:00:00] A lot of people call you the godmother of AI.
[00:00:02] Lenny (Host): The work you did actually was the spark
[00:00:04] Lenny (Host): that brought us out of AI winter.
[00:00:05] Lenny (Host): In the middle of 2015, middle of 2016,
[00:00:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: some tech companies avoid using the word AI
[00:00:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because they were not sure if AI was a dirty word.
[00:00:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: 2017-ish was the beginning of companies
[00:00:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: calling themselves AI companies.
[00:00:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: There's this line, I think this was when you're
[00:00:24] Lenny (Host): presenting to Congress.
[00:00:25] Lenny (Host): There's nothing artificial about AI.
[00:00:26] Lenny (Host): It's inspired by people, it's created by people
[00:00:28] Lenny (Host): and most importantly, it impacts people.
[00:00:30] Lenny (Host): It's not like I think AI will have no impact on jobs
[00:00:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or people.
[00:00:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: In fact, I believe that whatever AI does,
[00:00:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: currently or in the future, is up to us.
[00:00:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's up to the people.
[00:00:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I do believe technology is a net positive for humanity,
[00:00:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but I think every technology is a double-edged sword.
[00:00:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: If we're not doing the right thing
[00:00:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: as a society, as individuals, we can screw this up as well.
[00:00:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You had this breakthrough inside of just,
[00:00:57] Lenny (Host): OK, we can train machines to think like humans,
[00:01:00] Lenny (Host): but it's just missing the data that humans have
[00:01:02] Lenny (Host): to learn as a child.
[00:01:03] Lenny (Host): I chose to look at artificial intelligence
[00:01:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: through the lens of visual intelligence
[00:01:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because humans are deeply visual animals.
[00:01:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We need to train machines with as much information
[00:01:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: as possible on images of objects.
[00:01:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But objects are very, very difficult to learn.
[00:01:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: A single object can have infinite possibilities
[00:01:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that is shown on an image, in order
[00:01:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to train computers with tens and thousands of object concepts.
[00:01:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You really need to show it millions of examples.
[00:01:36] Today, my guest is Dr. Fei-Fei Li,
[00:01:38] Lenny (Host): who's known as the godmother of AI.
[00:01:41] Lenny (Host): Fei-Fei has been responsible for and at the center
[00:01:43] Lenny (Host): of many of the biggest breakthroughs
[00:01:45] Lenny (Host): that sparked the AI revolution they were currently living through.
[00:01:48] Lenny (Host): She spearheaded the creation of ImageNet, which was basically
[00:01:51] Lenny (Host): her realizing that AI needed a ton of clean label data
[00:01:55] Lenny (Host): to get smarter.
[00:01:56] Lenny (Host): And that data said became deep breakthrough
[00:01:58] Lenny (Host): that led to the current approach to building and scaling AI models.
[00:02:01] Lenny (Host): She was chief AI scientist at Google Cloud,
[00:02:04] Lenny (Host): which is where some of the biggest early technology
[00:02:06] Lenny (Host): breakthroughs emerged from.
[00:02:07] Lenny (Host): She was director at SAIL, Stanford's artificial intelligence
[00:02:10] Lenny (Host): lab, where many of the biggest AI minds came out of.
[00:02:13] Lenny (Host): She's also a curator of Stanford Human-centered AI
[00:02:16] Lenny (Host): Institute, which is playing a vital role in a direction
[00:02:19] Lenny (Host): that AI is taking.
[00:02:20] Lenny (Host): She's also been on the board of Twitter.
[00:02:22] Lenny (Host): She was named one of times 100 most influential people in AI.
[00:02:26] Lenny (Host): She's also the United Nations Advisory Board I could go on.
[00:02:29] Lenny (Host): In her conversation, Fei-Fei shares a brief history
[00:02:32] Lenny (Host): of how we got to today in the world of AI,
[00:02:35] Lenny (Host): including this mind-blowing reminder
[00:02:37] Lenny (Host): that nine to 10 years ago, calling yourself an AI company
[00:02:40] Lenny (Host): was basically a death knell for your brand.
[00:02:43] Lenny (Host): Because no one believed that AI was actually going to work.
[00:02:45] Lenny (Host): Today, it's completely different.
[00:02:47] Lenny (Host): Every company is an AI company.
[00:02:49] Lenny (Host): We also chat about her take on how she sees
[00:02:52] Lenny (Host): AI impacting humanity in the future.
[00:02:54] Lenny (Host): How far current technologies will take us?
[00:02:56] Lenny (Host): Why is she so passionate about building a world model?
[00:02:59] Lenny (Host): And what exactly world models are?
[00:03:01] Lenny (Host): And most exciting of all, the launch of the world's first
[00:03:04] Lenny (Host): large world model, Marble, which just came out
[00:03:07] Lenny (Host): as this podcast comes out.
[00:03:08] Lenny (Host): Anyone can go play with this at marble.worldlabs.ai.
[00:03:12] Lenny (Host): It's insane.
[00:03:13] Lenny (Host): Definitely check it out.
[00:03:14] Lenny (Host): Fei-Fei is incredible and way to enter the radar
[00:03:16] Lenny (Host): for the impact that she's had on the world.
[00:03:18] Lenny (Host): So I am really excited to have her on
[00:03:20] Lenny (Host): and to spread her wisdom with more people.
[00:03:22] Lenny (Host): A huge thank you to Ben Horowitz and Condoleezza Rice
[00:03:25] Lenny (Host): for suggesting topics for this conversation.
[00:03:27] Lenny (Host): If you enjoyed this podcast, don't forget
[00:03:29] Lenny (Host): to subscribe and follow it in your favorite
[00:03:30] Lenny (Host): podcasting app or YouTube.
[00:03:32] Lenny (Host): With that, I bring you Dr. Fei-Fei Lee
[00:03:34] Lenny (Host): after a short work from our sponsors.
[00:03:37] This episode is brought to you by Figma,
[00:03:39] Lenny (Host): makers of Figma Make.
[00:03:41] Lenny (Host): When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember
[00:03:43] Lenny (Host): when Figma came out and how much it improved
[00:03:45] Lenny (Host): how we operated as a team.
[00:03:47] Lenny (Host): Suddenly, I could involve my whole team
[00:03:49] Lenny (Host): in the design process, dip feedback on design concepts
[00:03:52] Lenny (Host): really quickly, and it just made
[00:03:53] Lenny (Host): the whole product development process so much more fun.
[00:03:56] Lenny (Host): But Figma never felt like it was for me.
[00:03:58] Lenny (Host): It was great for giving feedback and designs,
[00:04:01] Lenny (Host): but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff.
[00:04:03] Lenny (Host): That's why Figma built Figma Make.
[00:04:06] Lenny (Host): With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design
[00:04:09] Lenny (Host): into a fully functional prototype or app
[00:04:12] Lenny (Host): that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers.
[00:04:15] Lenny (Host): Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool.
[00:04:17] Lenny (Host): Because it's all in Figma, you can use your team's
[00:04:20] Lenny (Host): existing design building blocks, making it easy to create
[00:04:23] Lenny (Host): outputs that look good and feel real and are connected
[00:04:26] Lenny (Host): to how your team builds.
[00:04:28] Lenny (Host): Stop spending so much time telling people about your
[00:04:30] Lenny (Host): product vision and instead show it to them.
[00:04:33] Lenny (Host): Make code back prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make.
[00:04:37] Lenny (Host): Check it out at figma.com slash running.
[00:04:40] Lenny (Host): Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me with
[00:04:42] Lenny (Host): my podcast and with my newsletter?
[00:04:44] Lenny (Host): I want everyone on my team to be super happy and thrive
[00:04:47] Lenny (Host): in their roles.
[00:04:48] Lenny (Host): JustWorks knows that your employees are more than
[00:04:50] Lenny (Host): just your employees.
[00:04:51] Lenny (Host): They're your people.
[00:04:53] Lenny (Host): My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia,
[00:04:55] Lenny (Host): and Nepal, West Africa, and San Francisco.
[00:04:58] Lenny (Host): My life would be so incredibly complicated to hire people
[00:05:01] Lenny (Host): internationally to pay people on time and in their
[00:05:03] Lenny (Host): local currencies and to answer their HR questions 24-7.
[00:05:07] Lenny (Host): But with justworks, it's super easy.
[00:05:10] Lenny (Host): Whether you're setting up your own automated payroll,
[00:05:12] Lenny (Host): offering premium benefits, or hiring internationally,
[00:05:15] Lenny (Host): justworks offer simple software and 24-7 human support
[00:05:19] Lenny (Host): from small business experts for you and your people.
[00:05:21] Lenny (Host): They do your human resources right so that you can do
[00:05:24] Lenny (Host): right by your people.
[00:05:25] Lenny (Host): Justworks for your people.
[00:05:31] Hey, hey, thank you so much for being here and welcome
[00:05:33] Lenny (Host): to the podcast.
[00:05:34] Lenny (Host): I'm excited to be here, Lenny.
[00:05:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I'm even more excited to have you here.
[00:05:38] Lenny (Host): It is such a treat to get to chat with you.
[00:05:40] Lenny (Host): There's so much that I want to talk about.
[00:05:42] Lenny (Host): You've been at the center of this AI explosion that we're
[00:05:45] Lenny (Host): seeing right now for so long.
[00:05:47] Lenny (Host): We're going to talk about a bunch of the history that I think
[00:05:49] Lenny (Host): a lot of people don't even know about how this whole thing
[00:05:52] Lenny (Host): started.
[00:05:52] Lenny (Host): But let me first read a quote from Wired
[00:05:54] Lenny (Host): about you, just so people get a sense.
[00:05:56] Lenny (Host): And in the intro, I'll share all of the other epic things
[00:05:58] Lenny (Host): you've done.
[00:05:58] Lenny (Host): But I think this is a good way to just set context.
[00:06:01] Lenny (Host): Fei-Fei is one of a tiny group of scientists, a group
[00:06:03] Lenny (Host): perhaps small enough to fit around a kitchen table who
[00:06:06] Lenny (Host): are responsible for AI's recent remarkable advances.
[00:06:10] Lenny (Host): A lot of people call you the godmother of AI.
[00:06:13] Lenny (Host): And unlike a lot of AI leaders, you're an AI optimist.
[00:06:17] Lenny (Host): You don't think AI is going to replace us.
[00:06:20] Lenny (Host): You don't think it's going to take all our jobs.
[00:06:21] Lenny (Host): You don't think it's going to kill us.
[00:06:22] Lenny (Host): So I thought it'd be fun to start there.
[00:06:24] Lenny (Host): Just what's your perspective on how AI is going
[00:06:27] Lenny (Host): to impact humanity over time?
[00:06:29] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[00:06:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: OK.
[00:06:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So Lenny, let me be very clear.
[00:06:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I'm not a utopian.
[00:06:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So it's not like I think AI will have no impact on jobs
[00:06:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or people.
[00:06:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: In fact, I'm a humanist.
[00:06:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I believe that whatever AI does, currently
[00:06:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or in the future, is up to us.
[00:06:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's up to the people.
[00:06:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I do believe technology is a net positive for humanity.
[00:06:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: If you look at the long course of civilization,
[00:06:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think we are an fundamentally
[00:07:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we're an innovative species that we,
[00:07:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: if you look at from written records thousands of years ago
[00:07:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to now, humans just kept innovating ourselves
[00:07:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and innovating our tools.
[00:07:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And with that, we make lives better.
[00:07:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We make work better.
[00:07:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We build civilization.
[00:07:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I do believe AI is part of that.
[00:07:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So that's where the optimism comes from.
[00:07:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But I think every technology is a double-edged sword.
[00:07:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And if we're not doing the right thing
[00:07:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: as a species, as a society, as communities, as individuals,
[00:07:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we can screw this up as well.
[00:07:47] Lenny (Host): There's this line.
[00:07:47] Lenny (Host): I think this was when you were presenting to Congress.
[00:07:50] Lenny (Host): There's nothing artificial about AI.
[00:07:51] Lenny (Host): It's inspired by people.
[00:07:52] Lenny (Host): It's created by people and most importantly, it impacts people.
[00:07:56] I don't have a question there, but what are great lines?
[00:07:59] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[00:08:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I feel pretty deeply.
[00:08:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I started working AI two and a half decades ago,
[00:08:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and I've been having students for the past two decades.
[00:08:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And almost every student who graduates,
[00:08:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I remind them when they graduate from my lab
[00:08:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that your field is called artificial intelligence,
[00:08:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but there's nothing artificial about it.
[00:08:23] Coming back to the point, just made about how it's kind
[00:08:25] Lenny (Host): of up to us, about where this all goes.
[00:08:27] Lenny (Host): What is it you think we need to get right?
[00:08:28] Lenny (Host): How do we set things on a path?
[00:08:30] Lenny (Host): I know this is a very difficult question to answer,
[00:08:33] Lenny (Host): but just what's your advice?
[00:08:35] Lenny (Host): What do you think we should be in mind?
[00:08:36] Lenny (Host): Yeah, like how many hours do we have?
[00:08:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: How do we align AI?
[00:08:40] Lenny (Host): There we go, let's solve it.
[00:08:41] Lenny (Host): Yeah, so I think people should be responsible individuals,
[00:08:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: no matter what we do.
[00:08:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: This is what we teach our children,
[00:08:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and this is what we need to do as grownups as well,
[00:08:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: no matter which part of the AI development or AI deployment
[00:08:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or AI application you are participating in.
[00:09:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And most likely many of us, especially as technologists,
[00:09:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: were in multiple points,
[00:09:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we should act like responsible individuals
[00:09:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and care about us, actually care a lot about us.
[00:09:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think everybody today should care about AI
[00:09:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because it is going to impact your individual life,
[00:09:23] it is going to impact your community,
[00:09:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: it's going to impact the society and the future generation,
[00:09:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and caring about it as a responsible person
[00:09:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is the first but also the most important step.
[00:09:37] Okay, so let me actually take a step back
[00:09:39] Lenny (Host): and kind of go to the beginning of AI.
[00:09:42] Most people started hearing and caring about AI
[00:09:45] Lenny (Host): is what it's called today, just like, I don't know,
[00:09:48] Lenny (Host): a few years ago when Chatshey PT came out,
[00:09:49] Lenny (Host): maybe it was like three years ago.
[00:09:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Three years ago, almost one more month, three years ago.
[00:09:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Wow, okay, that was Chatshey PT coming out,
[00:09:56] Lenny (Host): is that the milestone?
[00:09:57] Lenny (Host): Yeah, mine, okay, cool.
[00:09:58] Lenny (Host): That's exactly how I saw it.
[00:10:00] Lenny (Host): But very few people know there was a long, long history
[00:10:02] Lenny (Host): of people working on, it was called machine learning back then
[00:10:05] Lenny (Host): and there's other terms and now it's just everything's AI.
[00:10:07] Lenny (Host): And there was kind of like a long period
[00:10:09] Lenny (Host): of just a lot of people working on it
[00:10:11] Lenny (Host): and then there's what people were first used to the AI winter
[00:10:13] Lenny (Host): where people just gave up, almost most people did
[00:10:15] Lenny (Host): and just, okay, this idea isn't going anywhere.
[00:10:19] Lenny (Host): And then the work you did actually was essentially the spark
[00:10:21] Lenny (Host): that brought us out of AI winter
[00:10:23] Lenny (Host): and is directly responsible for the world
[00:10:26] Lenny (Host): where now just AI is all we talk about as you just said,
[00:10:28] Lenny (Host): it's gonna impact everything we do.
[00:10:31] Lenny (Host): So that would be really interesting to hear from you,
[00:10:32] Lenny (Host): just kind of like the brief history
[00:10:34] Lenny (Host): of what the world was like before ImageNet,
[00:10:38] Lenny (Host): then just the work you did to create ImageNet,
[00:10:41] Lenny (Host): why that was so important
[00:10:42] Lenny (Host): and then just what happened after?
[00:10:44] It is for me hard to keep in mind that AI is so new
[00:10:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: for everybody.
[00:10:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: When I lived my entire professional life in AI,
[00:10:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: it's there's a part of me that it's just,
[00:10:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: it's so satisfying to see a personal curiosity
[00:11:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that I started barely out of teenage hood
[00:11:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and now has become a transformative force
[00:11:11] of our civilization.
[00:11:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It generally is a civilization level technology.
[00:11:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So that journey is about about 30 years
[00:11:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or 20 something, 20 plus years
[00:11:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and it's just very satisfying.
[00:11:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So where did I all start?
[00:11:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Well, I'm not even the first generation AI researcher.
[00:11:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: The first generation really date back to the 50s and 60s
[00:11:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and Alan Turing was ahead of his time by in the 40s
[00:11:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: by asking daring humanity with the question,
[00:11:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: can we is there thinking machines?
[00:11:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And of course, he has a specific way
[00:11:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of testing this concept of thinking machine
[00:11:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: which is a conversational chapot,
[00:11:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: which to his standard, we now have a thinking machine
[00:12:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but that was just a more anecdotal inspiration.
[00:12:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: The field really began in the 50s
[00:12:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: when computer scientists came together
[00:12:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and look at how we can use computer programs
[00:12:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and algorithms to build these programs
[00:12:22] that can do things that have been only capable
[00:12:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: by human cognition.
[00:12:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So and that was the beginning and the founding fathers,
[00:12:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the Dartmouth, the workshop in the 1956.
[00:12:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You know, we have Professor John McCarthy
[00:12:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: who later came to Stanford
[00:12:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: who coined the term artificial intelligence.
[00:12:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And between the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s,
[00:12:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: it was the early days of AI exploration
[00:12:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and we had logic systems, we had expert systems,
[00:12:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we also had early exploration of neural network.
[00:13:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then it came to around the late 80s, the 90s
[00:13:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and the very beginning of the 21st century.
[00:13:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That stretch about 20 years
[00:13:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is actually the beginning of machine learning.
[00:13:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's the marriage between computer programming
[00:13:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and statistical learning.
[00:13:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And that marriage brought a very, very critical concept
[00:13:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: into AI, which is that purely rule-based program
[00:13:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is not gonna account for the vast amount
[00:13:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of cognitive capabilities that we imagine computers can do.
[00:13:46] So we have to use machines to learn the patterns.
[00:13:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Once the machines can learn the patterns,
[00:13:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: it has the hope to do more things.
[00:13:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: For example, if you give it three cats,
[00:13:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the hope is not just for the machines
[00:14:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to recognize these three cats,
[00:14:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the hope is the machines can recognize the fourth cat,
[00:14:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the fifth cat, the sixth cat and all the other cats.
[00:14:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And that's a learning ability
[00:14:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that is fundamental to humans and the many animals.
[00:14:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we as a field realize we need machine learning.
[00:14:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So that was up till the beginning of the 21st century.
[00:14:26] I enter the field of AI literally in the year of 2000.
[00:14:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's when my PhD began at Caltech.
[00:14:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And so I was one of the first generation
[00:14:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: machine learning researchers.
[00:14:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we were already studying this concept of machine learning
[00:14:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: especially in your network.
[00:14:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I remember that was one of my first courses
[00:14:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in the at Caltech is called your network.
[00:14:49] But it was very painful.
[00:14:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It was still smack in the middle of the so-called AI winter,
[00:14:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: meaning the public didn't look at this too much.
[00:14:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: There wasn't that much funding.
[00:14:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But there was also a lot of ideas flowing around.
[00:15:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I think two things happened to myself
[00:15:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that brought my own career so close to the birth of modern AI
[00:15:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is that I chose to look at artificial intelligence
[00:15:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: through the lens of visual intelligence.
[00:15:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Because humans are deeply visual animals.
[00:15:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We can talk a little more later,
[00:15:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but so much of our intelligence is built upon visual,
[00:15:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: perceptual, spatial understanding,
[00:15:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: not just language per se.
[00:15:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think they're complementary.
[00:15:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I chose to look at visual intelligence.
[00:15:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And my PhD and my early professor years,
[00:15:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I, my students and I are very committed to a North Star
[00:15:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: problem, which is solving the problem of object recognition.
[00:15:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Because it's a building block for the perceptual world,
[00:15:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: right? We go around the world,
[00:15:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: interpreting, reasoning, and interacting with it,
[00:16:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: more or less at the object level.
[00:16:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We don't interact with the world at the molecular level.
[00:16:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We don't interact with the world as we sometimes do,
[00:16:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but we rarely, for example, if you wanna lift a teapot,
[00:16:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: you don't say, okay, the teapot is made of 100 pieces of porcelain.
[00:16:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And let me work on these 100 pieces.
[00:16:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You look at this as one object and interact with it.
[00:16:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So object is really important.
[00:16:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I was among the first researchers to identify this
[00:16:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: as a North Star problem.
[00:16:35] But I think what happened is that as a student of AI,
[00:16:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and then a researcher of AI, I was working on all kinds
[00:16:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of mathematical models, including your network,
[00:16:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: including Bayesian network, including many models,
[00:16:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and there was one singular pain point,
[00:16:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is that these models don't have data to be trained up.
[00:16:59] And as a field, we were so focusing on these models,
[00:17:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but it don't down me that human learning,
[00:17:09] as well as evolution, is actually a big data learning process.
[00:17:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Humans learn with so much experience constantly
[00:17:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and evolution, if you look at time,
[00:17:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: animals evolved with just experiencing the world.
[00:17:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I think my student and I conjectured
[00:17:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that very critically overlooked ingredient
[00:17:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of bringing AI to life is big data.
[00:17:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then we began this image data project in 2006, 2007.
[00:17:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We were very ambitious.
[00:17:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We wanna get the entire internet's image data on objects.
[00:17:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Now granted, internet was a lot smaller than today.
[00:17:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I feel like that emission was at least not too crazy.
[00:17:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Now it's totally delusional to think
[00:18:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: a couple of grander students and the professor can do this.
[00:18:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But and that's what we did.
[00:18:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We curated very carefully 15 million images
[00:18:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: on the internet, created a taxonomy of 22,000 concepts,
[00:18:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: borrowing other researchers work like linguists work on wordnet.
[00:18:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it's a particular way of dictionary words.
[00:18:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we combine that into image data.
[00:18:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we open source that to the research community,
[00:18:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we held an annual image that challenged to encourage
[00:18:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: everybody to participate in this.
[00:18:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We continue to do our own research.
[00:18:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But 2012 was the moment that many people think
[00:18:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: was the beginning of the deep learning
[00:18:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or birth of modern AI because a group of Toronto researchers
[00:18:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: led by Professor Jeff Hinton participated in image
[00:18:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that challenge, used the image that big data
[00:19:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and two GPUs from Nvidia and created successfully
[00:19:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the first neural network algorithm that can,
[00:19:11] it didn't totally solve a major huge progress
[00:19:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: towards solving the problem of object recognition.
[00:19:20] And that combination of the TREAL technology,
[00:19:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: big data neural network and GPU was kind of the golden recipe
[00:19:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: for modern AI.
[00:19:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then fast forward the public moment of AI,
[00:19:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: which is the chat GPD moment,
[00:19:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: if you look at the ingredients of what brought chat GPD
[00:19:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to the world, technically is still use these three ingredients.
[00:19:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Now it's internet scale data, mostly texts,
[00:19:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is a much more complex neural network architecture than 2012
[00:20:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but it's still neural network.
[00:20:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And a lot more GPUs but it's still GPUs.
[00:20:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So these three ingredients are still at the core of modern AI.
[00:20:16] Incredible.
[00:20:17] Lenny (Host): I have never heard that full story before.
[00:20:19] Lenny (Host): I love that it was two GPUs was the first,
[00:20:23] I love that, just kidding.
[00:20:25] And now it's like I don't know, hundreds of thousands, right?
[00:20:27] Lenny (Host): That are orders of magnitudes more powerful.
[00:20:31] Lenny (Host): And those two GPUs where they were like gaming GPUs,
[00:20:34] Lenny (Host): they just went to the like the game star, right?
[00:20:35] Lenny (Host): They were people used for playing games.
[00:20:37] Lenny (Host): As you said, this continues to be in a large way
[00:20:39] Lenny (Host): the way models get smarter.
[00:20:41] Lenny (Host): Some of the fastest growing companies in the world right now
[00:20:43] Lenny (Host): I've had them all mostly on the podcast,
[00:20:45] Lenny (Host): Merchord, Surgeon, Scale.
[00:20:46] Lenny (Host): Like they do this, they continue to do this for labs,
[00:20:49] Lenny (Host): just give them more and more label data
[00:20:51] Lenny (Host): of the things they're most excited about.
[00:20:52] Lenny (Host): Oh yeah, I remember Alex Wang from Scale very early days,
[00:20:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I probably still has his emails when he was starting scale.
[00:21:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: He was very kind.
[00:21:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: He keeps sending me emails about how you match that inspired scale.
[00:21:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I was very pleased to see that.
[00:21:09] One of my other favorite takeaways from what you just shared
[00:21:11] Lenny (Host): is just such an example of high agency
[00:21:13] Lenny (Host): and just doing things.
[00:21:15] Lenny (Host): That's kind of a me-month Twitter.
[00:21:16] Lenny (Host): Just you can just do things.
[00:21:17] Lenny (Host): You're just like, okay, this is probably necessary to move AI.
[00:21:21] Lenny (Host): And it's called machine learning back then, right?
[00:21:23] Lenny (Host): Was that the term most people used?
[00:21:25] I think it was interchangeably.
[00:21:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's true.
[00:21:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Like I do remember the companies, the tech companies,
[00:21:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I'm not going to name names,
[00:21:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but I was in a conversation in one of the early days.
[00:21:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think it is in the middle of 2015, middle of 2016.
[00:21:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Some tech companies avoid using the word AI
[00:21:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because they were not sure if AI was a dirty word.
[00:21:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I remember I was actually encouraging everybody
[00:21:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to use the word AI because to me,
[00:21:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that is one of the most audacious question humanity
[00:22:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: has ever asked in our quest for science and technology.
[00:22:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I feel very proud of this term.
[00:22:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But yes, at the beginning,
[00:22:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: some people were not sure.
[00:22:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: What year was that roughly when AI was already working?
[00:22:14] Lenny (Host): 2016.
[00:22:15] Lenny (Host): I think it was less than 10 years ago.
[00:22:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That was the changing.
[00:22:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Like some people start calling it AI.
[00:22:23] But I think if you look at the Silicon Valley tech company,
[00:22:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: if you trace their marketing term,
[00:22:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think 2017-ish was the beginning of companies
[00:22:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: calling themselves AI companies.
[00:22:40] That's incredible.
[00:22:41] Lenny (Host): Just how the world has changed.
[00:22:43] Lenny (Host): Now you can't not call yourself an AI company.
[00:22:46] Lenny (Host): I know.
[00:22:47] Lenny (Host): Just nine-ish years later.
[00:22:48] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[00:22:49] Lenny (Host): Oh, man.
[00:22:50] Lenny (Host): Okay.
[00:22:51] Lenny (Host): Is there anything else around the history,
[00:22:52] Lenny (Host): that early history that you think people don't know?
[00:22:54] Lenny (Host): They think it's important before we chat about
[00:22:57] Lenny (Host): where things are going and the work that you're doing.
[00:23:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think as all histories, I'm keenly aware
[00:23:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that I am recognized for being part of the history,
[00:23:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but there are so many heroes and so many researchers.
[00:23:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We're talking about generations of researchers.
[00:23:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: They're in my own world.
[00:23:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: There are so many people who have inspired me,
[00:23:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: which I talked about in my book.
[00:23:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But I do feel our culture,
[00:23:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: especially the Silicon Valley,
[00:23:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: tends to assign achievements to a single person.
[00:23:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: While I think it has value,
[00:23:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but it's just to be remembered,
[00:23:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: AI is a field of at this point, 70 years old,
[00:23:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and we have gone through many generations.
[00:23:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Nobody, no one,
[00:23:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: could have gotten here by themselves.
[00:23:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Okay.
[00:23:54] Lenny (Host): Let me ask you this question.
[00:23:56] Lenny (Host): It feels like we're always on this precipice of AI,
[00:23:58] Lenny (Host): this kind of vague term, people throw around,
[00:24:00] Lenny (Host): AI is coming, it's gonna take over everything.
[00:24:03] Lenny (Host): How, what's your take on?
[00:24:05] Lenny (Host): How far you think we might be from AI?
[00:24:06] Lenny (Host): Do you think we're gonna get there on the current trajectory?
[00:24:09] Lenny (Host): Or on do you think we need more break views?
[00:24:10] Lenny (Host): Do you think the current approach will get us there?
[00:24:13] Yeah, this is a very interesting term, Lenny.
[00:24:17] I don't know if anyone has ever defined AI.
[00:24:22] You know, there are many different definitions,
[00:24:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: including some kind of superpower for machines,
[00:24:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: all the way to can,
[00:24:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: machines can become economically viable agents
[00:24:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in the society.
[00:24:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: In other words, making salaries to live.
[00:24:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Is that a definition of AI?
[00:24:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: As a scientist, I take science very seriously,
[00:24:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and I enter the field because I was inspired
[00:24:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: by this audacious question of chemistings,
[00:24:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: think and do things in the way that human can do.
[00:25:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: For me, that's always the North start of AI.
[00:25:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And from that point of view,
[00:25:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I don't know what's the difference between AI and AI.
[00:25:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think we've done very well in achieving parts of the goal,
[00:25:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: including conversational AI,
[00:25:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but I don't think we have completely conquered all the goals of AI.
[00:25:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I think our founding fathers, the Alan Turing,
[00:25:27] I wonder if Alan Turing is around today,
[00:25:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and you ask him to contrast the AI versus AI.
[00:25:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Team I just shrugged and said,
[00:25:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: well, I asked the same question back in 1940s.
[00:25:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I don't want to get on to a rabbit hole
[00:25:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of defining AI versus AI.
[00:25:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I feel AI is more a marketing term than a scientific term.
[00:25:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: As a scientist and technologist,
[00:25:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: AI is my North star, is my field's North star,
[00:25:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and I'm happy people call it whatever name they want to call it.
[00:26:05] So let me ask you, maybe this way,
[00:26:07] Lenny (Host): like you described, there's kind of these components
[00:26:09] Lenny (Host): that from ImageNet and AlexNet kind of took us to where we're today,
[00:26:13] Lenny (Host): GPUs, essentially data, label data,
[00:26:17] Lenny (Host): just like the algorithm of the model.
[00:26:19] Lenny (Host): There is also just a transformer,
[00:26:21] Lenny (Host): feels like an important step in that trajectory.
[00:26:24] Lenny (Host): Do you feel like those are the same components that'll get us to,
[00:26:27] Lenny (Host): I don't know, 10 times smarter model,
[00:26:29] Lenny (Host): something that's like life changing for the entire world?
[00:26:32] Lenny (Host): Or do you think we need more breakthroughs?
[00:26:34] Lenny (Host): I know we're going to talk about world models,
[00:26:35] Lenny (Host): which I think is a component of this,
[00:26:37] Lenny (Host): but is there anything else that you think is like,
[00:26:39] Lenny (Host): oh, this is a plateau, or okay, this will take us,
[00:26:42] Lenny (Host): just need more data, more compute, more GPUs.
[00:26:44] Oh no, I definitely think we need more innovations.
[00:26:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think scaling loss of more data, more GPUs,
[00:26:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and bigger current model architecture,
[00:26:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is there's still a lot to be done there,
[00:26:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but I absolutely think we need to innovate more.
[00:27:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: There's not a single deeply scientific discipline
[00:27:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in human history that has arrived at a place that says,
[00:27:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we're done, we're done innovating.
[00:27:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And AI is one of the,
[00:27:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: if not the youngest discipline in human civilization
[00:27:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in terms of science and technology,
[00:27:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we're still scratching the surface.
[00:27:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: For example, like I said, we're going to segue into world models.
[00:27:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Today you take a model and run it through a video
[00:27:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of a couple of office rooms
[00:27:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and ask the model to count the number of chairs.
[00:27:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And this is something a toddler could do,
[00:27:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or maybe an elementary school kid could do,
[00:27:48] and AI could not do that, right?
[00:27:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So there's just so much AI today could not do.
[00:27:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Then let alone thinking about how did you know,
[00:27:59] someone like Isaac Newton look at the movements
[00:28:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of the celestial bodies and derive an equation
[00:28:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or a set of equations that governs the movement
[00:28:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of all bodies, that level of creativity, extrapolation,
[00:28:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: abstraction, we have no way of enabling AI to do that today.
[00:28:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then let's look at emotional intelligence.
[00:28:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: If you look at a student coming to a teacher's office
[00:28:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and have a conversation about motivation, passion,
[00:28:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: what to learn, what's the problem that's really bothering you,
[00:28:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that conversation as powerful as today's conversational bots
[00:28:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: are you don't get that level of emotional cognitive intelligence
[00:28:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: from today's AI.
[00:28:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So there's a lot we can do better.
[00:28:57] And I do not believe we're done innovating.
[00:29:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Demis had this really interesting interview recently
[00:29:02] Lenny (Host): from DeepMind and Sasha Google,
[00:29:03] Lenny (Host): where someone asked him just like,
[00:29:04] Lenny (Host): what do you think, how far away from AGI,
[00:29:07] Lenny (Host): what does it look like, we're through there.
[00:29:08] Lenny (Host): He had a really interesting way of approaching it
[00:29:10] Lenny (Host): is if we were to give them the most cutting edge model,
[00:29:13] Lenny (Host): all the information until the end of the 20th century,
[00:29:17] Lenny (Host): see if it could come up with all the breakthroughs Einstein had,
[00:29:20] Lenny (Host): and so far we're never near that.
[00:29:21] Lenny (Host): But they can see.
[00:29:22] Lenny (Host): No, we're not.
[00:29:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: In fact, it's even worse.
[00:29:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Let's give AI all the data,
[00:29:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: including modern instruments data of celestial bodies,
[00:29:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: which Newton did not have, and give it to that,
[00:29:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and just ask AI to create the 17th century set of equations
[00:29:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: on the laws of bodily movements.
[00:29:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Today's AI can all do that.
[00:29:49] Lenny (Host): All right, we're away the way.
[00:29:50] Lenny (Host): So what I mean here.
[00:29:51] Okay, so let's talk about world models.
[00:29:52] Lenny (Host): This is, to me, this is just another really amazing example
[00:29:56] Lenny (Host): of you being ahead of where people end up.
[00:30:00] Lenny (Host): So you were way ahead on, okay,
[00:30:02] Lenny (Host): we just need a lot of clean data for AI
[00:30:05] Lenny (Host): and neural networks to learn.
[00:30:07] Lenny (Host): You've been talking about this idea of world models
[00:30:08] Lenny (Host): for a long time, you started a company to build.
[00:30:11] Lenny (Host): Essentially, there's language models.
[00:30:12] Lenny (Host): This is a different thing.
[00:30:13] Lenny (Host): This is a world model.
[00:30:14] Lenny (Host): We'll talk about that is.
[00:30:15] Lenny (Host): And now, as I was preparing for this,
[00:30:17] Lenny (Host): Elon's like talking about world models,
[00:30:19] Lenny (Host): Jensen's talking about world models.
[00:30:21] Lenny (Host): I know Google's working on this stuff.
[00:30:22] Lenny (Host): You've been at this for a long time,
[00:30:24] Lenny (Host): and you're actually just launching something that's gonna,
[00:30:26] Lenny (Host): we're gonna talk about right before the spot cast errors.
[00:30:31] Lenny (Host): Talk about what is a world model?
[00:30:32] Lenny (Host): Why is it so important?
[00:30:33] Lenny (Host): I'm very excited to see that more and more people
[00:30:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: are talking about world models like Elon, like Jensen.
[00:30:43] I have been thinking about really how to push AI forward
[00:30:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: all my life, right?
[00:30:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And the large language models that came out
[00:30:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of the research world and then open AI and all this.
[00:31:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: For the past few years,
[00:31:02] were extremely inspiring,
[00:31:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: even for a researcher like me.
[00:31:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I remembered when GPT2 came out,
[00:31:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and that was in, I think late 2020,
[00:31:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I was co-director, I still am,
[00:31:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but I was at that time full-time co-director
[00:31:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of Stanford's Human Center AI Institute.
[00:31:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I remember it was,
[00:31:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the public was not aware of the power
[00:31:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of the large language model yet,
[00:31:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but as researchers, we were seeing it,
[00:31:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we're seeing the future.
[00:31:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I had pretty long conversations
[00:31:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: with my natural language processing colleagues,
[00:31:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: like Percy Liang and Chris Madding,
[00:31:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we were talking about how critical this technology
[00:31:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is gonna be,
[00:31:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and Stanford AI Institute,
[00:31:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Human Center AI Institute,
[00:31:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: HAI was the first one to establish a full research center
[00:31:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: on foundation model.
[00:31:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We were Percy Liang and many researchers
[00:32:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: led the first academic paper foundation model.
[00:32:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So it was just very inspiring for me.
[00:32:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So of course, I come from the world of visual intelligence,
[00:32:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and I was just thinking there's so much we can push forward
[00:32:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: on beyond language, because humans have,
[00:32:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: use our sense of spatial intelligence,
[00:32:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: a world understanding to do so many things,
[00:32:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and they are beyond language.
[00:32:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Think about a very chaotic first responder scene,
[00:32:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: whether it's fire or some traffic accident
[00:32:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or some natural disaster.
[00:32:47] And if you immerse yourself in a scene
[00:32:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and think about how people organize themselves
[00:32:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to rescue people, to stop further disasters,
[00:32:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to put down fires,
[00:33:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to a lot of that is movements,
[00:33:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is spontaneous understanding of objects worlds,
[00:33:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: human situation awareness, language is part of that,
[00:33:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but a lot of those situations,
[00:33:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: language cannot get you to put down the fire.
[00:33:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So that is what is that?
[00:33:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I was thinking a lot,
[00:33:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and in the meantime, I was doing a lot of robotics research,
[00:33:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and it dawned on me that the linchpin of connecting
[00:33:37] the additional intelligence,
[00:33:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in addition to language,
[00:33:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and connecting embodied AI, which are robotics,
[00:33:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: connecting visual intelligence,
[00:33:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is the sense of spatial intelligence
[00:33:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: about understanding the world.
[00:33:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And that's when, I think I, it was 2024,
[00:33:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I gave a TED Talk about spatial intelligence
[00:34:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: at world models,
[00:34:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and I start formulating this idea back in 2022,
[00:34:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: based on my robotics and computer vision research.
[00:34:14] And then one thing that was really clear to me,
[00:34:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is that I really wanna work with the brightest technologist
[00:34:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and move as fast as possible to bring this technology to life,
[00:34:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and that's when we found it,
[00:34:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: this company called World Labs.
[00:34:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And you can see the world is in the title of our company,
[00:34:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because we believe so much in world modeling
[00:34:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and spatial intelligence.
[00:34:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: People are so used to just chat bots,
[00:34:43] Lenny (Host): and that's a large language model.
[00:34:44] Lenny (Host): The simple way to understand a world model is you,
[00:34:46] Lenny (Host): basically describe a scene,
[00:34:48] Lenny (Host): and it generates an infinitely,
[00:34:50] Lenny (Host): a explorer world.
[00:34:52] Lenny (Host): We'll link to the thing you'll launch,
[00:34:54] Lenny (Host): which we'll talk about,
[00:34:54] Lenny (Host): but just as that is simple way to understand it.
[00:34:56] Lenny (Host): That's part of it, Lenny.
[00:34:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think a simple way to understand a world model,
[00:35:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is that this model can allow anyone to create
[00:35:07] any world in their mind's eye,
[00:35:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: by prompting whether it's an image or sentence,
[00:35:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and also be able to interact in this world,
[00:35:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: whether you're browsing and walking
[00:35:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or picking objects up or changing things,
[00:35:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: as well as to reason within this world.
[00:35:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: For example, if the person consuming,
[00:35:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: if the agent consuming this output of the world model
[00:35:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is a robot, it should be able to plan its path
[00:35:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and help to tidy the kitchen, for example.
[00:35:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So world model is a foundation
[00:35:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that you can use to reason, to interact,
[00:35:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and to create worlds.
[00:35:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Great, yeah.
[00:36:00] Lenny (Host): So robots feels like that's potentially
[00:36:04] Lenny (Host): the next big focus for AI researchers
[00:36:07] Lenny (Host): and just like the impact on the world,
[00:36:08] Lenny (Host): and what you're saying here is,
[00:36:11] Lenny (Host): this is a key missing piece of making robots
[00:36:14] Lenny (Host): actually work in the real world,
[00:36:16] Lenny (Host): understanding how the world works.
[00:36:17] Lenny (Host): Yeah, well, first of all,
[00:36:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I do think there's more than robots that's exciting.
[00:36:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But I agree with everything you just said.
[00:36:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think world modeling and spatial intelligence
[00:36:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is a key missing piece of body AI.
[00:36:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I also think let's not underestimate
[00:36:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that humans are embodied agents,
[00:36:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and humans can be augmented by AI's intelligence.
[00:36:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Just like today, humans are language animals,
[00:36:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but we're very much augmented by AI
[00:36:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: when helping us to do language tasks,
[00:36:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: including software engineering.
[00:36:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think that we shouldn't underestimate,
[00:36:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or maybe it's, we tend not to talk about
[00:37:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: how humans as an embodied agents
[00:37:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: can actually benefit so much from world models
[00:37:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and spatial intelligent models,
[00:37:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: as well as robots can.
[00:37:15] So the big onlocks here are robots,
[00:37:17] Lenny (Host): which a huge deal.
[00:37:19] Lenny (Host): If this works out, imagine each of us has robots
[00:37:21] Lenny (Host): doing a bunch of stuff for us,
[00:37:22] Lenny (Host): goes into, you know,
[00:37:23] Lenny (Host): they help us with disasters, things like games.
[00:37:26] Lenny (Host): Obviously is a really cool example,
[00:37:27] Lenny (Host): just like infinitely playable games
[00:37:30] Lenny (Host): that you just invent at your head.
[00:37:31] Lenny (Host): And then creativity feels like just like being fun,
[00:37:34] Lenny (Host): having fun, being creative, thinking of,
[00:37:35] Lenny (Host): imagine, wild new world and environments.
[00:37:39] And also design, humans design from machines
[00:37:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to buildings to homes,
[00:37:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and also scientific discovery, right?
[00:37:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: There is so much, I like to use the example
[00:37:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of the discovery of the structure of DNA.
[00:37:55] If you look at one of the most important
[00:37:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: piece in DNA's discovery history
[00:38:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is the X-ray diffraction photo
[00:38:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that was captured by Rosalind Franklin.
[00:38:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it was a flat 2D photo of a structure
[00:38:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that looks like, it looks like a cross with diffractions.
[00:38:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You can Google those photos.
[00:38:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But with that, 2D-flat photo,
[00:38:23] humans, especially two important humans,
[00:38:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: James Watson and Francis Crick,
[00:38:29] in addition to their other information,
[00:38:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: was able to reason in 3D space and deduce
[00:38:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: a highly three-dimensional double helix structure
[00:38:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of the DNA.
[00:38:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And that structure cannot possibly be 2D.
[00:38:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You cannot think in 2D and deduce that structure.
[00:38:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You have to think in 3D spatial,
[00:38:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: use the human spatial intelligence.
[00:38:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I think even the scientific discovery,
[00:39:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: spatial intelligence or AI assisted spatial intelligence
[00:39:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is critical.
[00:39:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: This is such an example of, I think it was critics
[00:39:10] Lenny (Host): in the head of this line that the next big thing
[00:39:12] Lenny (Host): is gonna start off feeling like a toy.
[00:39:15] Lenny (Host): When Chad G.P.C. just came out,
[00:39:17] Lenny (Host): if like, I remember Sam Wampin just tweeted,
[00:39:18] Lenny (Host): like, here's a cool thing we're playing with,
[00:39:20] Lenny (Host): check it out.
[00:39:21] Lenny (Host): Now it's the fastest growing product
[00:39:22] Lenny (Host): in all of history, change the world.
[00:39:24] Lenny (Host): And it's oftentimes the things that just look like,
[00:39:27] Lenny (Host): okay, this is cool, that it's a fun to play with
[00:39:30] Lenny (Host): and end up changing the world most.
[00:39:32] Yeah.
[00:39:33] Lenny (Host): This episode is brought to you by SINCH,
[00:39:35] Lenny (Host): the customer communications cloud.
[00:39:37] Lenny (Host): Here's the thing about digital customer communications,
[00:39:40] Lenny (Host): whether you're sending marketing campaigns,
[00:39:42] Lenny (Host): verification codes or account alerts,
[00:39:44] Lenny (Host): you need them to reach users reliably.
[00:39:46] Lenny (Host): That's where SINCH comes in.
[00:39:48] Lenny (Host): Over 150,000 businesses,
[00:39:51] Lenny (Host): including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies
[00:39:53] Lenny (Host): globally, use SINCH's API to build messaging, email,
[00:39:57] Lenny (Host): and calling into their products.
[00:39:58] Lenny (Host): And there's something big happening in messaging
[00:40:00] Lenny (Host): that product teams need to know about,
[00:40:02] Lenny (Host): rich communication services or RCS.
[00:40:06] Lenny (Host): Think of RCS as SMS 2.0.
[00:40:08] Lenny (Host): Instead of getting text from a random number,
[00:40:11] Lenny (Host): your users will see your verified company name and logo
[00:40:13] Lenny (Host): without needing to download anything new.
[00:40:16] Lenny (Host): It's a more secure and branded experience.
[00:40:18] Lenny (Host): Plus you get features like interactive carousels
[00:40:21] Lenny (Host): and suggested replies.
[00:40:22] Lenny (Host): And here's why this matters.
[00:40:24] Lenny (Host): US carriers are starting to adopt RCS.
[00:40:27] Lenny (Host): SINCH is already helping major brands
[00:40:29] Lenny (Host): send RCS messages around the world.
[00:40:31] Lenny (Host): And they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners
[00:40:33] Lenny (Host): get registered first before the rush hits the US market.
[00:40:36] Lenny (Host): Learn more at get started at cinch.com slash Lenny.
[00:40:40] Lenny (Host): That's s-i-n-c-h.com slash Lenny.
[00:40:45] I reached out to Ben Horowitz, who loves what you're doing,
[00:40:47] Lenny (Host): a big fan of yours, their investors, I believe in.
[00:40:50] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[00:40:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We've known each other for many years.
[00:40:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But yes, right now they are investors of War Labs.
[00:40:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Amazing.
[00:40:58] Lenny (Host): OK.
[00:40:58] Lenny (Host): So I asked him what I should ask you about.
[00:41:00] Lenny (Host): And he suggested ask you, why is the bitter lessen alone,
[00:41:04] Lenny (Host): not likely to work for robots?
[00:41:08] Lenny (Host): So first of all, just explain what the bitter lesson was
[00:41:11] Lenny (Host): in the history of AI.
[00:41:12] Lenny (Host): And then just why that won't get us to where
[00:41:14] Lenny (Host): we want to be with robots.
[00:41:16] So first of all, there are many bitter lessons.
[00:41:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But the bitter lessons everybody refers to is a paper written
[00:41:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: by Richard Sutton, who won the Turing Award recently.
[00:41:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And he does a lot of reinforcement learning.
[00:41:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And Richard has said, if you look at the history,
[00:41:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: especially the algorithmic development of AI,
[00:41:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: it turns out simpler model with a ton of data always
[00:41:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: win at the end of the day, instead of the more complex model
[00:41:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: with less data.
[00:41:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I mean, that was actually, this paper came years
[00:41:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: after ImageNet.
[00:41:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That, to me, was not bitter.
[00:42:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It was a sweet lesson.
[00:42:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's why I built ImageNet because I believe
[00:42:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that big data plays that role.
[00:42:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So why can bitter lesson work in robotics alone?
[00:42:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Well, first of all, I think we need to give credit
[00:42:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to where we are today.
[00:42:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Robotics is very much in the early days of experimentation.
[00:42:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's not the research is not nearly as mature as, say,
[00:42:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: language models.
[00:42:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So many people are still experimenting
[00:42:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: with different algorithms.
[00:42:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And some of those algorithms are driven by big data.
[00:42:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I do think big data will continue to play a role
[00:42:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in robotics.
[00:42:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And, but what is hard for robotics,
[00:42:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: there are a couple of things.
[00:42:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: One is that it's harder to get data.
[00:42:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's a lot harder to get data.
[00:42:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You can say, well, there is web data.
[00:43:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: This is where the latest robotics research
[00:43:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is using web videos.
[00:43:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I think web videos do play a role.
[00:43:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But if you think about what made language model worth
[00:43:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: a very, as someone who does computer vision
[00:43:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and spatial intelligence and robotics,
[00:43:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I'm very jealous of my colleagues in language
[00:43:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because they had this perfect setup
[00:43:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: where their training data are in words, eventually tokens.
[00:43:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then the producer model that outputs words.
[00:43:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So you have this perfect alignment between what you hope
[00:43:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to get, which we call objective function
[00:43:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and what your training data looks like.
[00:43:47] But robotics is different.
[00:43:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Even spatial intelligence is different.
[00:43:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You hope to get actions out of robots.
[00:43:56] But your training data lacks actions
[00:44:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in 3D worlds.
[00:44:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And that's what robots have to do, right?
[00:44:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Actions in 3D worlds.
[00:44:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So you have to find different ways to fit a,
[00:44:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: what do they call a square in a round hole.
[00:44:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That what we have is tons of web videos.
[00:44:23] So then we have to start talking about adding,
[00:44:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: supplementing data such as teleoperation data
[00:44:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or synthetic data so that the robots are trained
[00:44:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: with this hypothesis of bitter lesson,
[00:44:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: which is large amount of data.
[00:44:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think there's still hope
[00:44:44] because even what we are doing in world modeling
[00:44:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: will really unlock a lot of this information for robots.
[00:44:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But I think we have to be careful
[00:44:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because we're at the early days of this.
[00:44:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And bitter lesson is still to be tested
[00:45:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because we haven't fully figured out the data for.
[00:45:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Another part of the bitter lesson of robotics,
[00:45:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think we should be so realistic about is,
[00:45:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: again, compared to language models or even spatial models,
[00:45:19] robots are physical systems.
[00:45:22] So robots are closer to self-driving cars
[00:45:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: than a large language model.
[00:45:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And that's very important to recognize.
[00:45:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That means that in order for robots to work,
[00:45:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we not only need brains,
[00:45:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we also need the physical body,
[00:45:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we also need applications and scenarios.
[00:45:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: If you look at the history of self-driving car,
[00:45:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: my colleague Sebastian Thrum took Stanford's car
[00:45:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to win the first DARPA challenge in 2006 or 2005.
[00:46:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's 20 years since that prototype of a self-driving car,
[00:46:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: being able to drive 130 miles in the Nevada desert
[00:46:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to today's Weymill and on the street of San Francisco.
[00:46:17] And we're not even done yet, there's still a lot.
[00:46:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So that's a 20 year journey.
[00:46:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And self-driving cars are much simpler robots.
[00:46:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: They're just metal boxes running on 2D surfaces,
[00:46:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and the goal is not to touch anything.
[00:46:32] Robot is 3D things running in 3D world
[00:46:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and the goal is to touch things.
[00:46:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So the journey is gonna be,
[00:46:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: you know, there's many aspects, elements.
[00:46:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And of course one could say,
[00:46:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: well, the self-driving car early algorithm
[00:46:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: were pre-deplurning era.
[00:46:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So deplurning is accelerating the brains.
[00:46:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I think that's true.
[00:46:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's why I'm in robotics,
[00:46:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that's why I'm in spatial intelligence
[00:47:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and I'm excited by it.
[00:47:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But in the meantime, the car industry is very mature.
[00:47:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And productizing also involves the mature use cases,
[00:47:12] use cases, supply chains, the hardware.
[00:47:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I think it's a very interesting time
[00:47:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to work in these problems,
[00:47:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but it's true, but it's right.
[00:47:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We might still be subject to a number of better lessons.
[00:47:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Doing this work, do you ever just feel off
[00:47:31] Lenny (Host): for the way the brain works
[00:47:32] Lenny (Host): and is able to do all of this for us?
[00:47:35] Lenny (Host): Just the complexity, just to get a machine
[00:47:38] Lenny (Host): to just walk around and not hit things and fall.
[00:47:41] Lenny (Host): Does it just give you more respect
[00:47:42] Lenny (Host): for what we've already got?
[00:47:44] Lenny (Host): Totally.
[00:47:44] Lenny (Host): We operate on about 20 watts.
[00:47:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's dimmer than any light bulb in the room I'm in right now.
[00:47:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And yet we can do so much.
[00:47:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I think actually the more I work in AI,
[00:48:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the more I respect humans.
[00:48:03] Let's talk about this product you just launched
[00:48:05] Lenny (Host): called Marble, a very cute name.
[00:48:08] Lenny (Host): Talk about what this is, why this important,
[00:48:09] Lenny (Host): I've been playing with it, it's incredible.
[00:48:10] Lenny (Host): I'll link to it for folks to check it out.
[00:48:13] Lenny (Host): What is Marble?
[00:48:14] Yeah, I'm very excited.
[00:48:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So first of all, Marble is one of the first product
[00:48:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that World Labs has rolled out.
[00:48:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: World Labs is a foundation frontier model company.
[00:48:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We are funded by four co-founders
[00:48:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: who have deep technical history.
[00:48:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: My co-founders Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner
[00:48:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and Ben Mildenhall, we all come from the research field
[00:48:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of AI, computer graphics, computer vision.
[00:48:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we believe that spatial intelligence
[00:48:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and world modeling is as important,
[00:48:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: if not more, to language models and complementary
[00:48:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to language models.
[00:48:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we wanted to seize this opportunity
[00:48:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to create deep tech research lab
[00:49:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that can connect the dots between frontier models with products.
[00:49:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So Marble is an app that's built upon our frontier models.
[00:49:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We've spent a year and plus building
[00:49:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the world's first generative model that can output
[00:49:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: genuinely 3D worlds.
[00:49:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's a very, very hard problem.
[00:49:29] And it was a very hard process.
[00:49:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We have a team of incredible,
[00:49:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: founding team of incredible technologists
[00:49:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: from incredible teams.
[00:49:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then around a month or two ago,
[00:49:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we saw the first time that we can just prompt
[00:49:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: with a sentence and an image and multiple images
[00:49:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and create worlds that we can just navigate in.
[00:50:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: If you put it on cargo, which we have an option
[00:50:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to let you do that,
[00:50:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: you can even walk around it, right?
[00:50:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So it was, even though we've been building this for quite a while,
[00:50:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: it was still just awe inspiring.
[00:50:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we wanted to get into the hands of people who needed.
[00:50:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then we know that so many creators, designers,
[00:50:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: people who are thinking about robotic simulation,
[00:50:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: people who are thinking about different use cases
[00:50:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of navigable, interactable, immersive worlds,
[00:50:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: game developers will find this useful.
[00:50:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we developed Marble as a first step.
[00:50:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's again, still very early,
[00:50:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but it's the world's first model doing this
[00:50:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and it's the world's first product
[00:50:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that allows people to just prompt, we call it prompt to worlds.
[00:51:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Well, I've been playing around it.
[00:51:02] Lenny (Host): It is insane.
[00:51:02] Lenny (Host): You could just have a little shire world
[00:51:04] Lenny (Host): where you just infinitely walk around middle earth,
[00:51:07] Lenny (Host): basically, and there's no one there yet.
[00:51:09] Lenny (Host): But it's insane.
[00:51:10] Lenny (Host): You just go anywhere.
[00:51:11] Lenny (Host): There's dystopian world.
[00:51:12] Lenny (Host): I'm just looking at all these examples.
[00:51:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Yes.
[00:51:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And my favorite part actually, I don't know.
[00:51:16] Lenny (Host): I don't know if there's a feature bug.
[00:51:17] Lenny (Host): You can see the dots of the world
[00:51:20] Lenny (Host): before it actually renders with all the textures.
[00:51:22] Lenny (Host): And I just love to, like, you get a glimpse
[00:51:24] Lenny (Host): into what is going on with this model.
[00:51:26] Lenny (Host): Basically great.
[00:51:27] Lenny (Host): That is so cool to hear.
[00:51:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Because this is where, as a researcher, I'm learning
[00:51:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because the dots that lead you into the world
[00:51:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: was an intentional feature visualization.
[00:51:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It is not part of the model.
[00:51:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's the model actually just generates the world.
[00:51:50] Lenny (Host): But we were trying to find a way
[00:51:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to guide people into the world
[00:51:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and a number of engineers work on different versions.
[00:51:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But we converge to the DAW.
[00:51:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And so many people, you're the only one
[00:52:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: told us how delightful that experience is.
[00:52:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it was really satisfying for us
[00:52:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to hear that this intentional visualization feature,
[00:52:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that's not just a big hardcore model, actually,
[00:52:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: has delighted our users.
[00:52:19] Wow.
[00:52:19] So you add that to make it more like to have humans understand
[00:52:24] Lenny (Host): what's going on more.
[00:52:24] Lenny (Host): It's more delightful.
[00:52:25] Lenny (Host): Wow.
[00:52:26] Lenny (Host): That is hilarious.
[00:52:27] Lenny (Host): It makes me think about a lens in the way
[00:52:29] Lenny (Host): they it's not the same thing, but they talk about what
[00:52:31] Lenny (Host): they're thinking and what they're doing.
[00:52:32] Lenny (Host): Yes, it is.
[00:52:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It is.
[00:52:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It also makes me think about just the matrix.
[00:52:36] Lenny (Host): It's exactly the matrix experience.
[00:52:39] Lenny (Host): I don't know if that was your inspiration.
[00:52:41] Well, like I said, a number of engineers
[00:52:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: worked on that.
[00:52:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It could be their inspiration.
[00:52:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's in their subconscious.
[00:52:50] Lenny (Host): OK, so just for folks that may be on a play around with us,
[00:52:53] Lenny (Host): maybe use a what's like, what are some applications today
[00:52:55] Lenny (Host): that folks can start using today?
[00:52:57] Lenny (Host): What's your goal with this launch?
[00:52:59] Yeah, so we do believe that world modeling is very horizontal,
[00:53:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but we're already seeing some really exciting use cases,
[00:53:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: virtual production for movies, because what they need
[00:53:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: are 3D worlds that they can align with the camera.
[00:53:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So when the actors are acting on it,
[00:53:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: they can position the camera and shoot the segments really well.
[00:53:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we're already seeing incredible use.
[00:53:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: In fact, I don't know if you have seen our launch video
[00:53:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: showing marble.
[00:53:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It was produced by a virtual production company.
[00:53:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We collaborated with Sony.
[00:53:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And they use marble scenes to shoot those videos.
[00:53:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we were collaborating with those technical artists
[00:53:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and directors, and they were saying this has cut our production
[00:53:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: time by 40X.
[00:53:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: In fact, it has to be.
[00:53:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Yes, in fact, it has to, because we only had one month
[00:54:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to work on this project.
[00:54:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And there were so many scenes they were trying to shoot.
[00:54:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So using marble really, really significantly
[00:54:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: accelerated the production of virtual production
[00:54:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: for VFX and movies.
[00:54:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's one use cases.
[00:54:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We are already seeing our users taking our marble
[00:54:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: scene and taking the mesh export and putting games,
[00:54:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: whether it's games on VR or games just fun games
[00:54:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that they have developed.
[00:54:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We were showing an example of robotic simulation,
[00:54:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because when I was still a researcher
[00:54:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: doing robotic training, one of the biggest pain
[00:54:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: point is to create synthetic data for training robots.
[00:54:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And these synthetic data needs to be very diverse.
[00:54:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: They need to come from different environments
[00:55:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: with different objects to manipulate.
[00:55:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And one path to it is to ask computers to simulate.
[00:55:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Otherwise, humans have to build every single asset for robots.
[00:55:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's just going to take a lot longer.
[00:55:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we already have researchers reaching out
[00:55:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and wanting to use marble to create those synthetic environments.
[00:55:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We also have unexpected user outreach
[00:55:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in terms of how they want to use marble.
[00:55:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: For example, a psychologist team called us
[00:55:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to use marble to do psychology research.
[00:55:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It turned out some of the psychiatric patients they study,
[00:55:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: they need to understand how their brain responds
[00:55:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to different immersive scenes of different features.
[00:55:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: For example, messy scenes or clean scenes
[00:55:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or whatever you name it.
[00:56:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it's very hard for researchers to get their hands
[00:56:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: on these kind of immersive scenes.
[00:56:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it will take them too long and too much budget
[00:56:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to create.
[00:56:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And marble is a really almost instantaneous way
[00:56:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of getting so many of these experimental environments
[00:56:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: into their hands.
[00:56:25] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we're seeing multiple use cases at this point.
[00:56:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But the VFX, the game developers, the simulation developers,
[00:56:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: as well as designers are very excited.
[00:56:39] This is very much the way things work in AI
[00:56:41] Lenny (Host): have had other AI leaders on the podcast.
[00:56:43] Lenny (Host): And it's always like put things out there early
[00:56:45] Lenny (Host): as soon as you can to discover where the big use cases are.
[00:56:48] Lenny (Host): The head of JGPT told me how, when they first put out JGPT,
[00:56:52] Lenny (Host): he was just scanning TikTok to see how people were using it
[00:56:55] Lenny (Host): and all the things they were talking about.
[00:56:56] Lenny (Host): And that's what convinced them where to lean in
[00:56:59] Lenny (Host): and helped them see how people actually want to use it.
[00:57:02] Lenny (Host): I love this last use case of like for therapy.
[00:57:04] Lenny (Host): I'm just imagining like heights,
[00:57:07] Lenny (Host): people seeing, dealing with heights or snakes or spiders,
[00:57:11] Lenny (Host): which.
[00:57:11] Lenny (Host): It's amazing.
[00:57:12] Lenny (Host): A friend of mine last night literally called me
[00:57:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and talked about his height scare
[00:57:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and asked me if marble should be used.
[00:57:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's amazing.
[00:57:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You went straight there.
[00:57:23] That's, you know, because I'm imagining all the exposure
[00:57:25] Lenny (Host): therapy stuff.
[00:57:27] Lenny (Host): Like this could be so good for that.
[00:57:29] Lenny (Host): That is so cool.
[00:57:31] Lenny (Host): OK, so let me, I should have asked you this before,
[00:57:32] Lenny (Host): but I think there's going to be a question of just,
[00:57:35] Lenny (Host): how does this differ from things like VO3
[00:57:37] Lenny (Host): and other video generation models?
[00:57:40] Lenny (Host): It's pretty clear to me, but I think it might be helpful
[00:57:42] Lenny (Host): just to explain how this is different from all the video AI
[00:57:44] Lenny (Host): tools people have seen.
[00:57:46] Lenny (Host): Worro apps thesis is that spatial intelligence
[00:57:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is fundamentally very important.
[00:57:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And spatial intelligence is not just, it's not just about videos.
[00:57:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: In fact, the world is not passively watching videos passing
[00:58:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: by, right?
[00:58:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I love Plato has the allegory of the cave analogy
[00:58:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to describe vision.
[00:58:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: He said that imagine a prisoner tied on his chair, not very
[00:58:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: humane, but in a cave watching a full life theater
[00:58:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: on the in front of him.
[00:58:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But the actual life theater that actors are acting
[00:58:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is behind his back.
[00:58:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It was just lit so that the projection of the action
[00:58:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is on a wall of the cave.
[00:58:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then the goal, the task of this prisoner
[00:58:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is to figure out what's going on.
[00:58:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's a pretty extreme example, but it really
[00:58:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: shows, it describes what vision is about,
[00:58:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is that to make sense of the 3D world or 4D world
[00:59:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: out of 2D.
[00:59:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So spatial intelligence to me is deeper
[00:59:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: than only creating that flat 2D world.
[00:59:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Spatial intelligence to me is the ability
[00:59:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to create reason, interact, make sense
[00:59:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of deeply spatial world, whether it's 2D or 3D or 4D,
[00:59:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: including dynamics and all that.
[00:59:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So world lab is focusing on that.
[00:59:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And of course, the ability to create videos per se
[00:59:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: could be part of this.
[00:59:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And in fact, just a couple of weeks ago,
[00:59:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we rolled out the world's first real-time demoable, real-time
[00:59:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: video generation on a single H100 GPU.
[00:59:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we part of our technology includes that.
[00:59:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But I think Marbo is very different
[01:00:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because we really want creators, designers, developers
[01:00:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to having their hands a model that can give them worlds
[01:00:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: with 3D structures so they can use it for their work.
[01:00:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And that's why Marbo is so different.
[01:00:21] The way you see it is, it's a platform for a ton of opportunity
[01:00:25] Lenny (Host): to do stuff.
[01:00:26] Lenny (Host): As you describe videos, here's a one-off video
[01:00:29] Lenny (Host): that's very fun and cool.
[01:00:30] Lenny (Host): And you could, and that's it, and you move on.
[01:00:33] Lenny (Host): By the way, in Marbo, we could allow people
[01:00:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to explore in video forms.
[01:00:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So you could actually, like you said,
[01:00:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: you go into a world.
[01:00:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So let's say it's a Hobbit cave.
[01:00:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You can actually, especially as a creator,
[01:00:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: you have such a specific way of moving the camera
[01:00:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in a trajectory in the director's mind.
[01:00:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then you can export that from Marbo into a video.
[01:01:02] What does it take to create something like this?
[01:01:03] Lenny (Host): Just like how big is the team, how many GPUs you work in?
[01:01:07] Lenny (Host): Like anything you can share there.
[01:01:08] Lenny (Host): I don't know how much of this is private information,
[01:01:09] Lenny (Host): but just what does it take to create something like this
[01:01:11] Lenny (Host): that you've launched here?
[01:01:12] Lenny (Host): It takes a lot of brain power.
[01:01:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we just talk about 20 watts per brain.
[01:01:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's so from that point of view, it's a small number,
[01:01:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but it's actually incredible.
[01:01:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's a half billion years of evolution
[01:01:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to give us those power.
[01:01:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We have a team of 30-ish people now,
[01:01:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and we are predominantly researchers,
[01:01:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or research engineers.
[01:01:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But we also have designers and product.
[01:01:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We actually really believe that we
[01:01:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: want to create a company that's anchored
[01:01:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in the deep tech of spatial intelligence,
[01:01:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but we are actually building serious products.
[01:02:04] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we have this integration of R&D and productization.
[01:02:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And of course, we use a ton of GPUs.
[01:02:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's a techie too.
[01:02:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's a techie too.
[01:02:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's a techie too.
[01:02:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That's a techie too.
[01:02:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Well, congrats on the launch.
[01:02:21] Lenny (Host): I know there's a huge milestone.
[01:02:22] Lenny (Host): I know this took a ton of work.
[01:02:23] Lenny (Host): I just want to say congrats to you and your team.
[01:02:26] Let me talk about your founder journey for a moment.
[01:02:29] Lenny (Host): So your founder, this company, started how many years ago?
[01:02:31] Lenny (Host): A couple of years ago?
[01:02:32] Lenny (Host): Two, three years ago?
[01:02:33] Lenny (Host): Oh, a year ago.
[01:02:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: A year ago.
[01:02:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: A year ago.
[01:02:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: A year?
[01:02:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: OK.
[01:02:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Probably 18 months, yeah.
[01:02:38] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: OK.
[01:02:39] Lenny (Host): What's something you wish you knew before you started this,
[01:02:42] Lenny (Host): that you wish you could whisper into the ear
[01:02:43] Lenny (Host): faith of 18 months ago?
[01:02:46] Well, I continue to wish I know the future of technology.
[01:02:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think actually that's one of our founding advantage
[01:02:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is that we see the future earlier in general
[01:03:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: than most people.
[01:03:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But still, man, this is so exciting.
[01:03:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And so amazing that what's unknown and what's coming.
[01:03:09] But I know the reason you're asking me this question
[01:03:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is a lot about the future of technology.
[01:03:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You're probably more, look, I did not
[01:03:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: start a company of this scale at 20-year-old.
[01:03:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I started a dry cleaner when I was 19,
[01:03:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but that's a little smaller scale.
[01:03:30] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We got a tablet.
[01:03:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And then I funded Google Cloud AI,
[01:03:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and then I funded an InstituS network.
[01:03:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But those are different beasts.
[01:03:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I did feel I was a little more prepared
[01:03:43] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: as a founder of the grinding journey
[01:03:49] that I compared to maybe the 20-year-old founders.
[01:03:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But I'm still surprised.
[01:04:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it puts me into paranoia sometimes
[01:04:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that how intensely competitive AI landscape
[01:04:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is from the model, the technology itself, as well as talents.
[01:04:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And when I founded the company,
[01:04:23] we did not have these incredible stories
[01:04:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of how much certain talents would cost.
[01:04:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So these are things that continue to surprise me.
[01:04:36] And I have to be very alert about.
[01:04:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: The competition you're talking about is, yeah,
[01:04:41] Lenny (Host): the competition for talent, the speed,
[01:04:44] Lenny (Host): which is how things are moving.
[01:04:45] Lenny (Host): Yeah.
[01:04:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Yeah.
[01:04:47] Lenny (Host): You mentioned this point that I want to come back to that.
[01:04:51] Lenny (Host): If you just look over the course of your career,
[01:04:53] Lenny (Host): you're at all of the major collections of humans
[01:04:57] Lenny (Host): that led to so many of the breakthroughs that are happening
[01:05:01] Lenny (Host): today.
[01:05:01] Lenny (Host): Obviously, we talk about ImageNet, also, just sale at Stanford
[01:05:04] Lenny (Host): is where a lot of the work happened.
[01:05:06] Lenny (Host): Google Cloud, which a lot of the breakthroughs
[01:05:08] Lenny (Host): happened, would brought you to those places.
[01:05:12] Lenny (Host): For people looking for how to advance in their career,
[01:05:16] Lenny (Host): be at the center of the future, just like,
[01:05:18] Lenny (Host): is there a through line there of just what
[01:05:20] Lenny (Host): pulled you from place to place and pulled you
[01:05:22] Lenny (Host): into those groups that might be helpful for people to hear?
[01:05:25] Yeah, this is actually a great question, Lenny,
[01:05:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because I do think about it.
[01:05:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And obviously, we talked about its curiosity
[01:05:35] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and passion that brought me to AI.
[01:05:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: That is more a scientific nor start.
[01:05:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I did not care if AI was a thing or not.
[01:05:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So that was one part.
[01:05:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But how did I end up choosing in the particular places
[01:05:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I work in, including starting world labs?
[01:05:55] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I think I'm very grateful to myself,
[01:06:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or maybe to my parents' genes.
[01:06:04] I'm an intellectually very fearless person.
[01:06:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I have to say, when I hire young people,
[01:06:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I look for that, because I think that's
[01:06:16] a very important quality if one wants to make a difference.
[01:06:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Is that when you want to make a difference,
[01:06:25] you have to accept that you're creating something new,
[01:06:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or you're diving into something new.
[01:06:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: People haven't done that.
[01:06:32] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And if you have that self-awareness,
[01:06:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: you almost have to allow yourself to be fearless
[01:06:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and to be courageous.
[01:06:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So when I, for example, came to Stanford,
[01:06:49] in the world of academia, I was very close to this thing
[01:06:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: called tenure, which is, have the job forever at Princeton.
[01:07:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But I choose to come to Stanford,
[01:07:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because I love Princeton, it's my alma mater.
[01:07:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It's just at that moment, there are people
[01:07:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: who are so amazing at Stanford, and the Silicon Valley ecosystem
[01:07:17] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: was so amazing that I was OK to take a risk of restarting
[01:07:23] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: my tenure clock.
[01:07:26] Going to becoming the first female director of sale,
[01:07:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I was actually relatively speaking of a very young faculty
[01:07:36] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: at that time.
[01:07:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I wanted to do that because I care about that community.
[01:07:41] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I didn't spend too much time thinking about all the failure
[01:07:44] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: cases.
[01:07:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Obviously, I was very lucky that the more senior faculty
[01:07:50] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: supported me, but I just wanted to make a difference.
[01:07:54] And then going to Google was similar.
[01:07:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I wanted to work with people like Jeff Dean, Jeff Hinton,
[01:08:02] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and all these incredible demos, the incredible people.
[01:08:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So the same with world labs.
[01:08:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I have this passion, and I also believe
[01:08:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that people with the same mission can do incredible things.
[01:08:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So that's how I guided my through life.
[01:08:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I don't overthink of all possible things that can go wrong,
[01:08:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because that's too many.
[01:08:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I feel like that's an important element.
[01:08:35] Lenny (Host): This is not focusing on the downside,
[01:08:37] Lenny (Host): focusing more on the people, the mission, what
[01:08:40] Lenny (Host): gets you excited, what do you think?
[01:08:42] Lenny (Host): I do.
[01:08:43] Lenny (Host): Yeah, I do want to say one thing to all the young talents
[01:08:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: in AI, the engineers, the researchers out there,
[01:08:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because some of you apply to world labs.
[01:08:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I feel very privileged.
[01:08:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: You consider world labs.
[01:08:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I do find many of the young people today
[01:09:00] think about every single aspect of an equation
[01:09:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: when they decide on jobs.
[01:09:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: At some point, maybe that's the way they want to do it.
[01:09:12] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But sometimes I do want to encourage young people
[01:09:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to focus on what's important, because I
[01:09:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: find myself constantly in mentoring mode
[01:09:24] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: when I talk to job candidates.
[01:09:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Not necessarily recruiting or not recruiting,
[01:09:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but just in mentoring mode when I see an incredible young talent
[01:09:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: who is over-focusing now, every minute dimension
[01:09:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and aspect of considering a job when maybe the most important
[01:09:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: thing is, where's your passion?
[01:09:50] Do you align with the mission?
[01:09:52] Do you believe it have faith in this team?
[01:09:55] And just focus on the impact and you can make
[01:10:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and the kind of work and team you can work with.
[01:10:05] Yeah, it's tough.
[01:10:05] It's tougher people in the AI space.
[01:10:07] Lenny (Host): Now there's so much at them, so much new,
[01:10:09] Lenny (Host): so much happening, so much FOMO.
[01:10:11] Lenny (Host): That's true.
[01:10:11] Lenny (Host): I could see the stress.
[01:10:13] Lenny (Host): And so I think that advice is really important, just like,
[01:10:15] Lenny (Host): what will actually make you feel fulfilled
[01:10:18] Lenny (Host): in what you're doing, not just where's the fastest
[01:10:20] Lenny (Host): growing company, or who's going to win, I don't know.
[01:10:23] Lenny (Host): I want to make sure I ask you about the work
[01:10:25] Lenny (Host): you're doing today at Stanford at the HCI.
[01:10:28] Lenny (Host): HCI.
[01:10:29] Lenny (Host): HCI Human Centered AI Institute.
[01:10:32] Lenny (Host): What are you doing there?
[01:10:33] Lenny (Host): I know this is the thing you do on the site still.
[01:10:36] So yes, HCI Human Centered AI Institute was co-founded
[01:10:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: by me and the group of faculty like Professor John H. Mendey,
[01:10:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Professor James Landey, Professor Chris Manning back in 2018.
[01:10:52] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I was actually finishing my last, the last,
[01:10:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: the sabbatical at Google.
[01:10:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it was a very, very important decision for me
[01:11:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because I could have stayed in the industry,
[01:11:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but my time at Google taught me one thing
[01:11:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is AI is going to be a civilizational technology.
[01:11:13] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it's, it don't know me how important this is to humanity,
[01:11:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to the point that I actually wrote a piece in New York Times
[01:11:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that year 2018 to talk about the need for a guiding framework
[01:11:28] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to develop and to apply AI.
[01:11:33] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And that framework has to be anchored in human benevolence
[01:11:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: is human centeredness.
[01:11:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I felt as Stanford, one of the world's top university
[01:11:45] in the heart of Silicon Valley, that gave birth
[01:11:48] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to important companies from Nvidia to Google,
[01:11:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: should be a thought leader to create this human centered AI framework
[01:12:00] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and to actually embody that in our research education
[01:12:06] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and policy and ecosystem work.
[01:12:09] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So I founded HAI, it, you know, after, fast forward,
[01:12:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: after six, seven years, it has become the world's largest AI
[01:12:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: institute that does human centered research education,
[01:12:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: ecosystem outreach and policy impact.
[01:12:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It involves hundreds of faculty across all eight schools,
[01:12:40] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Stanford, from medicine to education,
[01:12:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to sustainability, to business, to engineering,
[01:12:46] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to humanities, to more.
[01:12:49] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we, we support researchers, especially
[01:12:54] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: at the interdisciplinary area from digital economy
[01:12:58] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to legal studies, to political science,
[01:13:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to discovery of new drugs, to new algorithms,
[01:13:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to let's be young transformers.
[01:13:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: We also actually put a very strong focus on policy
[01:13:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because when we started HAI, I realized
[01:13:19] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: that Silicon Valley did not talk to Washington DC
[01:13:23] and or Brussels or other parts of the world.
[01:13:27] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And it's given how important this,
[01:13:31] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: this technology is, we need to bring everybody on board.
[01:13:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So we created multiple programs from congressional bootcamp
[01:13:39] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: to AI index report, to policy briefing.
[01:13:45] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And we especially participated in policy making,
[01:13:51] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: including advocating for a national AI research cloud
[01:13:57] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: bill that was passed in the first Trump administration
[01:14:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: and participating in state level regulatory AI discussions.
[01:14:08] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: So there's a lot we did.
[01:14:10] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I continue to be one of the leaders,
[01:14:15] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: even though I'm much less involved operationally,
[01:14:18] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: because I care not only we create this technology,
[01:14:22] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but we use it in the right way.
[01:14:24] Wow, I was not aware of all that other work you were doing.
[01:14:27] Lenny (Host): As you're talking, I was reminded Charlie Munger
[01:14:30] Lenny (Host): had this quote, take a simple idea and take it very seriously.
[01:14:35] Lenny (Host): I feel like you've done that in so many different ways
[01:14:37] Lenny (Host): and stayed with it.
[01:14:39] Lenny (Host): And it's unbelievable the impact that you've had
[01:14:41] Lenny (Host): in so many ways over the years.
[01:14:44] Lenny (Host): I'm going to skip the lightning round.
[01:14:45] Lenny (Host): And I'm just going to ask you one last question.
[01:14:47] Lenny (Host): Is there anything else that you wanted to share
[01:14:49] Lenny (Host): anything else you want to leave a list niche with?
[01:14:52] I'm very excited by AI Lenny.
[01:14:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: I want to answer one question that when I travel around the world,
[01:15:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: everybody asks me is that if I'm a musician,
[01:15:05] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: if I'm a teacher, middle school teacher, if I'm a nurse,
[01:15:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: if I'm a accountant, if I'm a farmer,
[01:15:14] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: do I have a role in AI?
[01:15:16] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Or is AI just going to take over my life or my work?
[01:15:21] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I think this is the most important question of AI.
[01:15:26] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And I find that in Silicon Valley,
[01:15:29] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: we tend not to speak hard to hard with people.
[01:15:34] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: With people like us, and not like us in Silicon Valley,
[01:15:37] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: but like all of us, we tend to just toss around words
[01:15:42] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: like infinite productivity or infinite leisure time
[01:15:47] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: or infinite power or whatever.
[01:15:53] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But at the end of the day, AI is about people.
[01:15:56] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And when people ask me that question,
[01:15:59] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: it's a resounding yes.
[01:16:01] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: Everybody has a role in AI.
[01:16:03] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: It depends on what you do and what you want.
[01:16:07] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: But no technology should take away human dignity.
[01:16:11] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: And the human dignity and agency should be at the heart of
[01:16:16] the development, the deployment, as well as the governance
[01:16:20] Dr. Fei-Fei Li: of every technology.
