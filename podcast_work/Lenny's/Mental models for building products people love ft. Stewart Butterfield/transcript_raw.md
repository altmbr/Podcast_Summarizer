[00:00:00] This is 2014.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_01: That was the year that Slack actually launched.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_01: I was interviewed by MIT Technology Review and asked
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_01: if we were working to improve Slack.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_01: I said, I feel like what we have right now
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_01: is just a giant piece of shit.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_01: It's just terrible and we should be humiliated
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_01: that we offered this to the public.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_01: To me, that was like, you should be embarrassed.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_01: If you can't see almost limitless opportunities
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_01: to improve, then you shouldn't be deciding.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_01: Slack was famous for being one of the early consumerized
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: B2B SaaS products.
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_01: At more than one company all-hands,
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_01: I made everyone in the company repeat this as a chant.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: In the long run, the measure of our success
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: will be the amount of value that we create for customers.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_01: And you can put effort into demonstrating
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_01: that you have created this value and stuff like that.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_01: But there's no substitute for actually having created it.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_01: Something else I heard that you often espouse
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_00: is friction in the product experience
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_00: is actually often a good thing.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_00: It became an assumption that you should always be trying
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_01: to remove friction when the challenge is really comprehension.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_01: If your software kind of stops me
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: and asks me to make a decision,
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_01: and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_01: If people could get over the idea of reducing friction
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_01: as a number of goals, reducing the number of plexer tabs,
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_01: and do something, and instead focus on,
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_01: how can I make this simple?
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_01: How do I prevent people from having to think
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_01: in order to use my software?
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: You started two companies both famously pivoted.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_00: I imagine many people come to you for advice on pivoting.
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: The decision is about like, have you exhaust the possibilities,
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_01: creating the distance so that you can make an intellectual,
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_01: rational decision about it,
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: rather than an emotional decision, this is essential.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_01: And the reason I say you have to be coldly rational
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: about it is because it's fucking humiliating.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_00: Today, my guest is Stuart Butterfield,
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_00: a founder and product legend who rarely does podcasts.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_00: Stuart founded Flickr and then Slack,
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_00: which he sold to Salesforce in one of the biggest acquisitions
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_00: in tech history at the time.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: There is so much product and leadership wisdom
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: locked away in his head.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_00: I feel like our conversation just scratched the surface,
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_00: which had about utility curves,
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_00: something he calls the owner's delusion,
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_00: a hilarious pattern.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_00: He sees a company's, he calls hyper realistic work like activities.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_00: What he's learned about product and craft and taste
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_00: and Parkinson's law, why you need to obsess
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_00: with not making your users think.
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: The backstory on his legendary We Don't Sell Saddles here,
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: memo, and so much more, a huge thank you to Noah Weiss,
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: Chris Cordell, Allie Rail, and Johnny Rogers
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_00: This is a really special one,
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_00: and I really hope to have Stuart back to delve even deeper.

[00:02:54] SPEAKER_00: after a short word from our sponsors.
[00:02:57] Here's a puzzle for you.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: What do open AI, cursor, perplexity,
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_00: versel, plat, and hundreds of other winning companies
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_00: haven't common?
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: The answer is they're all powered by today's sponsor,
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_00: Work OS.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: If you're building software for enterprises,
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: you've probably felt the pain of integrating single sign-on,
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_00: skim, hardback, audit logs,
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: and other features required by big customers.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: Work OS turns those deal blockers
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: into drop-in APIs with a modern developer platform
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: built specifically for B2B SaaS.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: Whether you're a seed-stage startup
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: trying to land your first enterprise customer,
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_00: or a unicorn expanding globally,
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: Work OS is the fastest path to becoming enterprise-ready
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: and unlocking growth.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: They're essentially striked for enterprise features.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_00: Visit WorkOS.com to get started,
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_00: or just hit up their slack support
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: where they have real engineers in there
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: who answer your questions super fast.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: Work OS allows you to build like the best
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: with delightful APIs, comprehensive docs,
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_00: and a smooth developer experience.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_00: Go to WorkOS.com to make your app enterprise-ready today.
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_00: This episode is brought to you by Metronome.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: You just launched your new shiny AI product.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_00: The new pricing page looks awesome,
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: but behind it, last minute glue code, messy spreadsheets,
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_00: and running ad hoc queries to figure out what to build.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_00: Customers get invoices they can't understand,
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_00: engineers are chasing billing bugs,
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: finance can't close the books.
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_00: With Metronome, you hand it all off
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: to the real-time billing infrastructure
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: that just works, reliable, flexible,
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_00: and built to grow with you.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_00: Metronome turns raw usage events into accurate invoices,
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: gives customers bills they actually understand,
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: and keeps every team in sync in real-time.
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: Whether you're launching usage-based pricing,
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: managing enterprise contracts,
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_00: or rolling out new AI services,
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: Metronome does the heavy lifting
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_00: so that you can focus on your product, not your billing.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_00: That's why some of the fastest growing companies
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: in the world, like OpenAI and Anthropic,
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_00: run their billing on Metronome.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: Visit metronome.com to learn more.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: That's metronome.com.
[00:04:56] !
[00:04:59] Stuart, thank you so much for being here
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: and welcome to the podcast.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: Thank you for having me.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_01: I'm excited.
[00:05:05] I'm even more excited.
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_00: I'm so honored to have you here.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: I never told you this, but you've been
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_00: towards the very top of my wish list of guests
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: I have on this podcast ever since I started
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_00: this podcast a few years ago.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_00: So I'm very excited.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: They're finally making this happen.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: I have so many questions for you.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_00: My first question is just what the heck
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_00: are you up to these days?
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_00: I feel like ever since you left Slack,
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: we haven't heard much from Stuart.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_00: I'm curious which up to you.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: Hopefully you're just chilling.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm mostly just chilling.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_01: I left Salesforce two and a half years ago,
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_01: and I have a two and a half year old.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_01: So she was actually born three days after my last day.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_01: So a lot of time with family
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_01: and it's like an enormous privilege
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_01: to be able to spend time with young kids
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_01: while they're young.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_01: No new company to announce or anything like that.
[00:05:51] I do get a lot of emails and texts.
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_01: Beats me like every three to six weeks.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_01: There's this cycle because
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_01: Kyle Henderson was a CTO Slack
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_01: and who also we work together on Flickr
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_01: so I've worked together now for 23 years.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_01: I've been talking about what we wanna do next
[00:06:09] if there is something.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_01: But you know, honestly, the big challenge has been,
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_01: I think these things are kind of destroying the world.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: And what we're good at is making software.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_01: So you can find some way to make software
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_01: that helped people use their phones less often
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_01: than that would be a big winner
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_01: but haven't come up with anything good.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_01: A lot of philanthropic work, nothing to an outsider yet,
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: but there's like some cool projects
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_01: that I'm working on and a lot of
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_01: just personal creative art projects
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_01: and supporting other artists and stuff like that.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: To prep for this chat,
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_01: I talk to so many people that have worked with you
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: over the years to try to figure out what you taught them
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: about building product, building teams, building companies
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: that most stuck with them,
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: that most helped them build amazing products.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: The first is a concept called utility curves.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: This game of a bunch across so many people
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_00: that have worked with you.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: Talk about what is utility curve
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: how you think use that to build better products.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: This is pretty easy because it's a very familiar
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_01: has curve where you have it's flat,
[00:07:12] it starts arcing up and then there's a really steep part
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: and then it levels off again.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_01: And on the horizontal access,
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_01: you can think of cost or effort.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_01: And on the vertical access, it's value or convenience.
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_01: It kind of depends exactly what you're talking about.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_01: But the idea is the first bit of effort
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_01: you put into something doesn't result
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_01: in a huge amount of value.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_01: And then there's some magic threshold where it produces
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_01: an enormous amount of value and then continued investment.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_01: Doesn't really pay off.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_01: The most basic example I can think of is
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_01: let's say you're making a hammer.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_01: And on that bottom access, it's now quality.
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_01: And if the hammer has a handle that breaks with any impact
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: then it's totally useless.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_01: And if you make it a little bit stronger,
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_01: it's still pretty useless.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_01: And it's kind of like junk, junk, junk, junk, junk.
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_01: OK, good, great.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_01: Then it doesn't matter anymore.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: If you're making an app OK, is that
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: it's going to have users?
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_01: And so let's make a user's table on a database.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_01: And so far, you have generated no value.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_01: The reason I felt like this was so important
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_01: is because we would talk about a feature.
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_01: And usually features are thought of as binary.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_01: Like you either have this feature or you go.
[00:08:28] And so the argument I guess was, have we just not invested
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_01: enough in this?
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_01: Or have we got all the value or convenience or quality
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_01: or whatever that we could get out of this?
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_01: And we get the point of dimension returns
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_01: and it just doesn't matter.
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_01: And I think in many cases, people
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_01: will add a feature.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_01: It's not good enough.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: And so people don't use it or appreciate it.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_01: But now you've added some complexity to the app.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_01: And then people give up or take it back.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_01: Or they try something in casting
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: and they don't get the results they want.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_01: And so they decide that this is the thing you were doing.
[00:09:04] And so we would try to really investigate
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_01: and decide whether we were on the first child
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_01: part of the curve, the second child part of the curve,
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_01: or we were just coming up to it.
[00:09:15] So I think it's a lot easier to understand the value
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_01: of this when you're talking about a specific app
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_01: and a specific feature.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_01: But I think it was ultimately helpful in getting people
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: to understand whether something was worth it or not.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_01: OK, so just to mirror back what I'm hearing,
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: there's kind of this, if you visualize this curve
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_00: at the bottom, it's like, I don't even know what this is.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_00: And then up the curve is like, OK, I sort of get it.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_00: And then at the top is, OK, I can't live without this.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_00: Now that I understand what this is for,
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_00: it feels like it's like a really,
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: it's a different way of thinking about getting
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_00: to the aha moment for someone where they see, OK, save
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_00: items, I get it.
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: I need to use this constantly.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_00: So it feels like this works both for a specific feature
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: and also just for Slack, like getting people
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: to even understand.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: Here's what Slack can do for you.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_00: And then now I can't live without Slack.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_00: And essentially, this is a lens you use
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: to figure out where to spend product resources.
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_00: Because if you don't get up that curve
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_00: to, I get it and I can't live without it, nothing else
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_00: matters.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_00: Is that the way, is that the framework?
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_01: And I think then you layer on another concept,
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_01: like the basis used the term, divine discontent.
[00:10:24] The line actually moves because once people are familiar,
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: with a piece of software or the way a feature is implemented
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: or something like that, their standards go up.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_01: And so there's like this competition.
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_01: And again, this access can be, utility
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_01: is the best general term for it, but it can be quality,
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_01: convenience, speed, it could be any number of things.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_01: But as you improve your search capability,
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_01: or as you improve your login experience,
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_01: or your password experience, or your checkout
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_01: or whatever, everyone else is as well.
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_01: And so there's this continued investment.
[00:11:04] And when you forget about thinking about a new feature,
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_01: you're looking at how the product works overall.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: And usually things get kind of implemented once.
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_01: And then if they're lucky, they get improved upon
[00:11:16] periodically.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_01: Most things get improved upon very infrequently.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_01: And something's getting improved upon never.
[00:11:23] And you know, I just want to give an example
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_01: at the absolute extreme.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: I actually don't know how long this has been,
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_01: but I try not to criticize other people's software so much
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: because I'm very familiar with the trade-offs
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_01: and prioritization and how hard it can be and blah, blah, blah.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_01: But OK, so most people have the Gmail calendar app
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: on their phone.
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_01: I travel a fair bit.
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_01: I'm mostly in the Eastern time zone, sometimes in mountain times,
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_01: sometimes in specifics, sometimes in English time,
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_01: sometimes in Japan, Central Europe.
[00:11:58] There's like maybe 10 time zones, 12 time zones
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_01: that I would ever choose.
[00:12:06] When you hit the option to set the time zone on an event
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: in Google Calendar on the iOS app,
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: it presents all the time zones in the world
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_01: in alphabetical order.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_01: And that's like the, I mean, there's probably worse orderings,
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_01: but there's no value.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_01: And even when you start searching,
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_01: it still presents in an alphabetical order
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_01: by country with that turn.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_01: So I'm in California, and I'm trying
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_01: to send it away with my next week when I'm back in New York.
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_01: And I type in EAST.
[00:12:39] That I get a bunch of garbage.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_01: OK, East urn, ERN.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_01: And then the first one is Eastern Australia, New South Wales.
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_01: And then Eastern Australia, Queensland.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_01: And then Eastern Australia, Daylight Sagaans,
[00:12:51] and Eastern Australia, Standard Time.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_01: And then you're like, well, fuck, what?
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_01: I can't remember which one is Daily Sagaans
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_01: and which one is Standard Time.
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_01: And I could keep going like this for a while.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_01: This is an app that's used by at least hundreds
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_01: and millions of people, presumably every single Google
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_01: employee.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_01: It's bananas how bad it is.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_01: There's so many, like there's all these clever things
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_01: you could do.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_01: Like you know me, I'm on the West Coast.
[00:13:18] First option should be the East Coast and vice versa.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: But it definitely shouldn't be that every time zone
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_01: is presented with equal value.
[00:13:27] There's a couple hundred time zones.
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_01: I grew up in Canada.
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_01: There's a Newfoundland has its own time zone, which
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_01: is offset by half an hour.
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_01: The population of Newfoundland is about half a million people.
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_01: Not that many people got it.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_01: Is it Newfoundland?
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_01: Maybe a million people in all of history.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_01: So I'm like a million and a half out of eight billion people.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: And there's Newfoundland, you know, like the same
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_01: with China time, which is like 25% of the world's population
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_01: in this country.
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_01: Anyway, and those a little bit longer
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_01: than I intended to go on this example.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_01: But it is, it's crazy because no one's
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_01: going to switch to Gmail or to G Suite, Google Calendar,
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_01: from Outlook Exchange because of the time zone
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_01: picker is good.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_01: So maybe in some sense, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_01: But at the same time, there's a real value
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_01: in in delighting customers.
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_01: And there's an emotional connection
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_01: that they form or don't form.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_01: And in some cases, that could be really positive,
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_01: like they would recommend it.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_01: And when they switch companies or decide
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_01: to start their own company, they're
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_01: going to choose to use this product or advocate for it
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_01: because of that emotional connection.
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_01: And vice versa, they'll also be like,
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_01: hate this thing that drives me.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_01: Banana is really like we should stop using it
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_01: or advocate for the alternative.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_01: And I think people just don't appreciate or come back
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_01: to those things for enough.
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_01: And then there's this category of really
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_01: essential parts of the app.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_01: Again, like a camp creation, sign up, forgot password,
[00:14:56] things like that.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_01: But for most organizations, very inforquently
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_01: get a lot of love and an iteration and improvement,
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_01: despite the fact that the quality bar has gone up
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_01: across the board and continue to lay us up.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_01: Let's go down that rabbit hole
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_00: a little bit more around delight and craft.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_00: Slack was famous for being one of the early,
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: let's say, a consumerized B2B SaaS products
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_00: slack leaned into delight and experience
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: and craft and a great experience.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_00: And you just as a product leader, I'd say,
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: are known as very taste-forward, very craft-oriented
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: leader, which is pretty rare.
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_00: And I think continues to be rare.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_00: So there's a few things I want to talk about here.
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_00: When is a taste?
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_00: I heard of a talk you get of a really unique,
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_00: you give a talk on taste and you have a really unique
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_00: perspective on just what taste is,
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_00: what product taste looks like.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_00: Can you share that?
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_01: There is a lot of, you're going back to the utility curves
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_01: again, people who are obsessed with this one little thing
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_01: and keep on adding more detail improvements beyond the
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_01: point where it makes much of a difference.
[00:16:01] But I guess a couple of things about taste.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: So one is, can you learn to develop it?
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: I think so because the word literally comes from
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: experiencing food and putting stuff in your mouth.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: And can people become better chefs with training?
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_01: Yes, absolutely.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: Undoubtedly, some people have a natural advantage
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: and are born with this ability to make discernments
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_01: that are difficult for other people to make.
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_01: But you can definitely practice and you can definitely
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_01: get better.
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_01: The second thing I'd say is you can create a real advantage
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_01: for yourself, for your product, for your company,
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_01: by leaning into it because most people don't have good taste
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_01: and don't invest.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_01: And so you're probably familiar with, again, Jeff Pezos
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_01: line, your margin is my opportunity.
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_01: And pretty obvious, he meant by that.
[00:16:54] I would tell the story at Slack over and over again,
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_01: and actually made it part of the new hire welcome.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_01: So I'm going, I'm in Vancouver at our Vancouver office
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_01: and I'm going for a walk with Brandon Velostok,
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_01: who's at the time creative director for product development.
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_01: I think that was his title.
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_01: And we're in the Yale town neighborhood in Vancouver.
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_01: So there's like really narrow sidewalks
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_01: because it used to be a warehouse district.
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_01: And now it's like fancy restaurants and nail salons
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: and cheeks and stuff.
[00:17:22] And as it does in Vancouver, it starts to rain.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_01: We don't have umbrellas.
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_01: We're walking back to the office.
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_01: And most people have umbrellas.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_01: And we're on these narrow sidewalks
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_01: with people coming towards us with umbrellas.
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_01: And we noticed how few people would move their umbrella out
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_01: of the way.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_01: And of course, the other person, their umbrella,
[00:17:42] the Pokebits are exactly at eye level for people walking
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: towards them.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: And we would get forced off the sidewalk
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_01: or having to duck down or whatever.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_01: And it became a game.
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_01: We were guessing, is this person going to tell their umbrella
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_01: out of the way so we can pass or not?
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_01: And something like one third of the people would do it.
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_01: And we had this conversation about it
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_01: where it's like, OK, I can think of three reasons
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_01: why people wouldn't do it.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_01: What is?
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_01: They have very few avenues in their life
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_01: to exercise power.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_01: And this is one of them.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_01: And they're just like want to get out there
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_01: and dominate people and cause suffering.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_01: So we shouldn't describe to malice
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_01: that which can be a sign to ignorance.
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: So that's probably is the explanation
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_01: for a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of people.
[00:18:34] But the other two explanations aren't that great either.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_01: One is that they see it's happening.
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_01: They see they're pushing other people off the sidewalk
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_01: or poking them in the eye or whatever.
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_01: And they're just like, fuck, that's too bad.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_01: I wish there was something I could do about that.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_01: But I can't think of anything.
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_01: And the last reason is they just don't notice at all.
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_01: They're just oblivious to their impact on other people.
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_01: And they're so in their head.
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_01: And I can't really think of any other explanations
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_01: for it besides that.
[00:19:03] And so we would say, it's not like tilting your umbrella
[00:19:07] is our opportunity.
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_01: That's not a great rephrase of your margin
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_01: as my opportunity.
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_01: But your failure to really be considerate
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_01: and exercises courtesy and really be empathic
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_01: about other people's experience is an advantage.
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_01: You can create a critical advantage.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: And I think that there's many reasons
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_01: why thought was successful at the moment.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_01: It was successful.
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_01: And I think we had a bunch of really wonderful tailwinds
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_01: and all of that stuff.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: But it wouldn't have grown the way it did
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_01: without those little conveniences which
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_01: caused people to form an emotional connection
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_01: because a lot of our growth came from, you know,
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_01: start up A, use a slack.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_01: And then someone leaves start up A for start up B.
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_01: And should I be doesn't use slack yet?
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_01: And they would be like, oh my God, you guys,
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_01: we really get this is so good.
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_01: We got to try it.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_01: And the spread was driven by that cross-pollination
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_01: and people really genuinely advocating for it.
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_01: That is an amazing metaphor.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_00: I love that one moment became like a value
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_00: of product craftsmanship.
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_00: It's like, tilting your umbrella was a very common
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_01: you'd say and bend on a company's lag
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_01: and stuff like that.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_01: Is there an example?
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_00: I imagine there are many.
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_00: But from the time of building Slack, especially in the early days
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_00: where you chose to go big on craftsmanship
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_00: and experience and delight versus speed,
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_00: where you thought looking back that was a really great idea
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_00: and it worth really courtship success.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: Here's a bunch of little examples.
[00:20:39] So someone else came up with this idea.
[00:20:43] And I'm trying to remember who it was.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_01: I'd say maybe Andrea Torres, maybe Ben Brown, some like that.
[00:20:52] Well, I was like, why do you ask people for email address
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_01: and password if they, their ownership of the email address
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_01: was the thing that allowed them to create the account
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_01: in the first place?
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_01: Why don't we just ask them for their email address
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_01: and then send them a link?
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_01: And so when Slack's first version of the mobile app came out,
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_01: we're like typing your password on your phone
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_01: if you have any minimal threshold of password hygiene
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_01: is a terrible experience, say your capital H,
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_01: your lowercase Q, sex, correct period.
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_01: But so let's just have them enter the email address.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_01: We'll send them a link, the link will automatically open
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_01: the app and authenticate them.
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_01: And so there's one, a little example.
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_01: Well, so you guys invented the magic link experience.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_00: Well, someone else in Vano want to be clear there.
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_01: I had seen that idea somewhere else,
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_01: like someone else a blog post about it or something like that.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_01: We were the first ones to my knowledge
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_01: that really kind of like scaled that and made it a standard.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_01: There is another one which we, you know,
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_01: we really puzzle about in the very early days
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_01: where people have a long history of using messaging apps
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_01: from like AOL and instant messenger to SMS
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_01: to WhatsApp where their expectation is,
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_01: they get a notification for every message that's received.
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_01: And in the case of Slack,
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_01: it doesn't make as much sense
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_01: because you're a member of many channels
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_01: and the messages may not be for you.
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_01: And so that's why we have that at-tacking people.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, we certainly didn't invent that.
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_01: I was Twitter.
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_01: But what we realized was people were signing up for Slack.
[00:22:27] You know, and it's like one engineer on this team
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_01: inside of this larger organization,
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_01: inside this larger company.
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_01: And they would pull in the person next to them
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_01: and they would say, let's try it out.
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_01: And then they would send a message
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_01: and then, well, personally, be like,
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_01: I didn't get a notification.
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_01: This is bullshit.
[00:22:43] So we reluctantly decided that we had to send notifications
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_01: for every single message as the default for new accounts.
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_01: But once you had, I don't remember
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_01: with the threshold to where that was.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_01: I think it's once you had received 10 messages,
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_01: we would pop up this little thing that says,
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_01: hey, you have our default settings for notifications.
[00:23:01] We don't want Slack to be noisy for you.
[00:23:02] SPEAKER_01: Would you like to switch to our recommended settings?
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_01: And then they would just click link
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_01: and it would have what should be the default,
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_01: which is you only get a notification if it's a DM
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_01: or someone tags you.
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_01: But we realized it was worth that investment
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_01: to get people over the hub.
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_01: A much more,
[00:23:20] well, here's one more simple one,
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_01: and then one could have more complex one.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_01: People would just like the,
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_01: a humor if it's called urgent or important,
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_01: but the flag in Outlook,
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_01: that would like, you know,
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_01: set the priority of a message for the recipients,
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_01: always got it used inside of every company.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_01: As soon as someone does it,
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_01: like everyone's like,
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_01: okay, I'm gonna do that too for my message.
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_01: And so all of your messages have the little flag
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_01: and it becomes useless.
[00:23:45] We have at everyone,
[00:23:46] SPEAKER_01: which causes the notification to be sent
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: to every member of the channel
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_01: when the message is sent and people would start,
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_01: you know,
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_01: someone would find the feature inside of a organization.
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_01: They would at everyone,
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_01: everyone would get a notification.
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_01: And then the next person to send a message
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_01: was like, well, my thing's more important than Bob saying,
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna also at everyone.
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_01: And it became really obnoxious
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_01: if people complain about it,
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_01: but it was said,
[00:24:09] I don't know,
[00:24:10] I guess tragedy of the comments,
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_01: it's not quite exactly the same thing,
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_01: but it was a real dynamic that happened over and over again.
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_01: So we came up with what was called the shout-e-ruster.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_01: And internally we said, don't be a cock.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_01: But we didn't obviously say that publicly.
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_01: When you at everyone,
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_01: a little rooster would pop up
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_01: and it would have like,
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_01: you sound waves coming out of its mouth
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_01: and being early obnoxious and say,
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_01: hey, this is gonna cause a notification
[00:24:34] for 147 people in eight different time zones.
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_01: Are you sure you want to send this message
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_01: with that at everyone?
[00:24:42] And of course that worked amazingly and it dropped off.
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_01: And again,
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_01: it was really trying to shape people's behavior
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_01: so that they use,
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_01: we want us not to be very flexible,
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_01: but we knew that there was ways to use it
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_01: that would be annoying and difficult for everyone.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_01: And so trying to shape the communication culture
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_01: inside the organization
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_01: to take best advantage on it.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_01: Now features still exist.
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_00: I see that rooster all the time.
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_00: Or no, I don't see it all.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_00: Well, actually I do at channel
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: because I've run a big Slack.
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_00: So I see that rooster in the,
[00:25:09] SPEAKER_00: that survived.
[00:25:11] Yeah.
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that survived and good.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_01: Because it was a truly easy thing
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_01: to comment and made a really big difference.
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: But I also taught people how the product worked
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_01: because people probably didn't know
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_01: that at everyone or at channel.
[00:25:27] Well, didn't think about the cost at least.
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_01: Here's, here's one more.
[00:25:36] So we decided we're going to do,
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_01: do not disturb as a future.
[00:25:41] And we had this,
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_01: not conundrum,
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_01: but we're trying to take into account all the,
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_01: all the different uses of Slack.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_01: It was a good time we'd be influenced to this.
[00:25:51] Like 2017, there was,
[00:25:54] you know,
[00:25:55] tens of thousands of,
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_01: of paying customers,
[00:25:58] the organizations,
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_01: hundreds of the millions of users,
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_01: maybe hundreds of thousands of organizations
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_01: that don't remember how many.
[00:26:05] And everyone had set up stuff the way that they liked it,
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_01: including things like
[00:26:09] ops alerts going into channels for,
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_01: on call engineers for,
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_01: for, you know, some of the biggest
[00:26:16] systems and apps in the world.
[00:26:19] And so we couldn't just like deploy it right away.
[00:26:22] We realized that some of the decision makers,
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_01: the owners of the organizations,
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_01: we're going to have really strong opinions about this.
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_01: We also realized that some of the end users
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_01: can have strong opinions.
[00:26:31] SPEAKER_01: And we wanted to figure out a way to kind of balance
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_01: the concerns and give people appropriate means of control.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_01: So we came up with this really elaborate system
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_01: for the rollout, which was,
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: we told everyone,
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry, every,
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_01: every Slack administrator that this was coming weeks before it came.
[00:26:49] And we told them that we were going to set a default
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_01: for their organization,
[00:26:54] which I believe was,
[00:26:56] either 7 PM to 7 AM in their local time zone
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_01: or 8 AM to 8 PM in a camera,
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_01: which was,
[00:27:02] but also that they could override that default.
[00:27:05] And also that the individual end users could override
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_01: that system owner default.
[00:27:12] And finally, that the system owner could,
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_01: if they changed the default again,
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_01: would override all of the end users' preferences.
[00:27:20] SPEAKER_01: And then the end users could
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_01: override them again.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_01: And it wasn't to create this dynamic where people were at war,
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_01: but so that you could change a policy
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_01: and that people could still customize and stuff like that.
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_01: But this was,
[00:27:33] you know, a much longer and more convoluted process,
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_01: but it allowed the millions of people who were using Slack
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_01: to get the feature without creating a bunch of conflict
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_01: and without people turning it off automatically.
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_01: And I think critically,
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_01: with setting a bunch of defaults,
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_01: because if we didn't set the default,
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_01: most people wouldn't turn it on at all.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_01: You look, if we didn't default you to do that disturbed
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_01: from an 8 PM to 8 AM,
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_01: you probably,
[00:28:02] if you're the average person,
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_01: it wouldn't ever do it yourself.
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_01: So that's another elaborate example
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_01: where I think that investment made sense,
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_01: because it was a critical feature for a lot of people.
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_01: And if we hadn't done it that way,
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_01: I think it would have caused a lot of complaints
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_01: and conflict and stuff like that.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_01: Those are amazing examples.
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_00: I very much appreciate that you did not disturb feature
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_00: when you guys launched that.
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_00: I still remember that coming out.
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure a lot of people are very thankful for that.
[00:28:30] Yeah.
[00:28:31] Something else I heard that you often espouse,
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_00: which is counterintuitive to a lot of people,
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_00: is about friction,
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_00: friction and the product experience.
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_00: That friction is actually often a good thing.
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_00: You actually, it's a feature,
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_00: not a bug a lot of times.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_00: If you use it well,
[00:28:44] SPEAKER_00: talk about your experience there.
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, so yes.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_01: And there's also another issue around friction,
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_01: which is it became like a mantra,
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_01: or just like an assumption
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_01: that you should always be trying to remove friction.
[00:29:03] And in some cases, that's true.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_01: We would talk about it slack.
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_01: It was hard to market.
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_01: It was hard to explain what it was
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_01: if you had never used it before.
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_01: You could say a messaging app for businesses or whatever.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_01: But a critical disadvantage to slack
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_01: doing out of home advertising,
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_01: putting up a billboard versus beer or cars
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_01: is no one needs to be explained
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_01: why they would want a car or beer.
[00:29:26] But everyone looked after being explained one day
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_01: but they want slack.
[00:29:30] And so the problem there is comprehension.
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_01: And this will come up an enormous amount.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_01: So now imagine you want to get tickets
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_01: to the Taylor Swift concert in San Francisco.
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_01: And you go to the ticket master website.
[00:29:43] If you think about both your comprehension,
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_01: it's perfect to this case.
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_01: And that translates into the specificity of your intent.
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_01: And the degree of your intent is also kind of maxed out.
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_01: So I really want to get these tickets.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_01: And I know exactly what they are.
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_01: They're Taylor Swift tickets for this day at this venue.
[00:30:03] And so in that scenario, it doesn't really matter
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_01: if ticket master's website is slow.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't really matter if the payments page airs out.
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_01: Like you're going to persist and get through it.
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_01: So obviously, they're better to reduce friction.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_01: But in some sense, it doesn't.
[00:30:18] It's not a huge amount of value in doing that.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_01: For most creators of products, there
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_01: are a handful of cases where that really is true for you
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_01: as well.
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_01: And they include things like user registration, authentication,
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_01: check out flows for e-commerce.
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_01: I am significantly more likely to buy something
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_01: if there's Apple Pay or Shop Pay or something like that.
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_01: I'm significantly less likely to carry through
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_01: the purchase of something if I have to manually
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: enter all of the fields of my address one of the time
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_01: rather than having one of those address pickers.
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: It's crazy.
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_01: But the issue is my intent isn't always 100%
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_01: and the specificity of my intent isn't always 100%.
[00:31:03] So if your thing is direct to consumer t-shirts
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_01: and you acquire customers through Instagram ads,
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_01: all of them know what t-shirts are.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_01: This looks like a good t-shirt to me.
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_01: But I'm rarely 100% intent.
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_01: I might have a very specific intent,
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_01: but it tends like 70%.
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_01: So if your, the amount of friction is above that,
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to do it.
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_01: But now people coming to Slack.com,
[00:31:30] they had some friend had mentioned Slack
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_01: and kind of talk their ear off at some point months ago.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: And then they saw a news article, and then they saw someone's tweet.
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_01: And then they saw an ad on a website, they were really thinking,
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_01: and they finally said, OK, I'm going to go to this website.
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_01: So their intent is like at the absolute minimum threshold.
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_01: Like it's just, it was before that last event happened,
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_01: they were below and now they're above.
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_01: But they're just above the specificity of their intent.
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_01: Like I need to get Taylor Swift concerts for this date
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_01: of this venue is also very low, because they're like,
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_01: it's a work thing.
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure.
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_01: It's a spreadsheet or like a calendar
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_01: or do you look exactly what it is.
[00:32:14] So they were coming in at 0.1% over these critical thresholds.
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_01: What was the challenge?
[00:32:23] SPEAKER_01: It wasn't friction, right?
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_01: Because it's not like they worked aiming for something
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_01: and they knew what they were aiming for.
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_01: And they were just trying to get themselves to that point.
[00:32:33] What we had to worry about was creating comprehension.
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_01: And in two senses, what is this thing?
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_01: And what am I supposed to do next?
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_01: And that creation of comprehension, in the sense of explaining
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_01: stuff, that creation of comprehension,
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_01: in the sense of the design of the UI, of the screen,
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_01: of the page, or whatever, and the visual hierarchy,
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: and the affordances that are there, and the indication
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_01: of things to interact with, and which thing should be
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_01: the next thing to do.
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_01: And all of that, that becomes really critical.
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_01: I think very, very few people recognize that.
[00:33:11] SPEAKER_01: They're like, I want to get people who come to my web page
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_01: to decide up for them as quickly as possible.
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_01: But if they don't know what they're signing up for,
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_01: and they don't know what it's going to do after,
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_01: he's going to spam them, they don't know what they're going
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_01: to have to pay on the next step or what,
[00:33:27] SPEAKER_01: then they're just going to back out.
[00:33:29] And this was like a lifelong battle,
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_01: because the remove friction kind of orientation
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_01: is so deep in people.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_01: Again, it really makes a difference in, in those cases,
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_01: where people do have an intent, and they do know what they're
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_01: trying to do, it is a poor approach
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_01: when the challenge is really comprehension.
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_01: And I think the secret is, most 70%, 80%,
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_01: or whatever of a product design is in that comprehension
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_01: step, because people, if they do ever open the Preferences
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_01: tab and look at all the options,
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_01: rarely have an idea.
[00:34:09] And if you can't teach them, or make it possible for them
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_01: to discover what the capabilities are,
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_01: then they're not going to take advantage of them,
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_01: and they're not going to get as much on it.
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_01: And I think that the trick is, for most of the unique parts
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_01: of any application, most of the specific things
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_01: that your product, your software does,
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_01: are areas where the challenge is going
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_01: to be comprehension in set-of-fiction.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_01: It really could be anything.
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_01: Shopify, the purpose of the service for its end users,
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_01: is generally going to be kind to clear.
[00:34:44] SPEAKER_01: But most people, most first-time store openers,
[00:34:49] don't know that they can get reports,
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_01: or if they know that they can get reports,
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_01: they don't know what kinds of reports,
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_01: and if they know what kinds of reports they can get,
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_01: they don't know how they can tweak them,
[00:34:57] SPEAKER_01: and how they can, you know, at the time,
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_01: you should be in which things that are more important
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_01: to display, and I could go on and on and on and on.
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_01: And people just don't recognize that.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_01: So I want to see if this is still true.
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_01: I'm just not going to open my iPhone, and a clock app,
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_01: and they had the most, the craziest description
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_01: for alarms.
[00:35:20] SPEAKER_01: Okay, it's still, it's a little bit different,
[00:35:24] but people didn't look at their own phone.
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_01: So I have, it says alarms, and I says sleep,
[00:35:31] and a vertical bar wake up, and says no alarm,
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_01: and a button that says change.
[00:35:37] And then if you hit it, it says sleep is off.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: In order to automatically turn on sleep features
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_01: and add to your schedule, you need to turn sleep on.
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_01: So obviously, sleep was a good name for this thing.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_01: If you already had a way of getting people to understand it,
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_01: if you don't, it's like ungrammatical and incomprehensible,
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_01: and why would you ever do it?
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_01: And I got a guess, it's been like this for years,
[00:36:02] 90 plus percent, and maybe 98% of people just do what I do,
[00:36:07] which is that you just create a, like I want the alarm on,
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_01: and I'm going to set the time for it.
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_01: And I don't know what turning sleep on does,
[00:36:15] but it's just like the lack of comprehension
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_01: prevents people from getting the value,
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_01: and I'm sure that there's a bunch of value
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_01: behind turning sleep on whatever that means,
[00:36:25] SPEAKER_01: and people spend a lot of time on those features,
[00:36:27] SPEAKER_01: and that integrates with biometrics and your watch,
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_01: or who knows?
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_01: Again, I still don't know, because turning sleep on
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_01: is like, what does that do, and what is it going to cost me,
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: and what impact it's going to have?
[00:36:41] Those examples are just, to me, all over the place,
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_01: and the reason I don't use most software,
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_01: where there was a natural choice point,
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_01: or the reason I don't use most features,
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_01: where there was a choice point for me,
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_01: is because I didn't understand what they were going to do,
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_01: and I don't give a shit.
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_01: And if there is one mantra that I would use to replace that,
[00:36:59] SPEAKER_01: it's don't make me think.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_01: And I don't know if you remember that book.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_01: Absolutely.
[00:37:04] Yeah, and honestly, it's been many more than 10 years
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_01: since I read it, so I don't know if you remember
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_01: all the examples in the book,
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_01: but as a mantra, that was like up there with utility curves,
[00:37:14] SPEAKER_01: because for two reasons.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_01: One is it's just like, it's expensive to make a decision,
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_01: like you literally burn glucose,
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_01: like there's a metabolic action.
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_01: There's ATP created in the mitochondria,
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_01: and your neurons and a bunch of stuff is happening,
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_01: and people do get decision fatigue,
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_01: and there is a cognitive cost of all these things.
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_01: But also, there's an emotional aspect,
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_01: which is if your software kind of stops me
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_01: and asks me to make a decision,
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_01: and I don't really understand it,
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_01: you make me feel stupid, right?
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_01: I don't understand this.
[00:37:49] Some people are, maybe there are mutations,
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_01: but the software is stupid,
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_01: I think most people are like, oh, I'm done.
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_01: And if you ever talk to him who aren't
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_01: especially technologically savvy,
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_01: the canonical example is like people
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_01: who are under 50 talking to their parents
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_01: about using some pieces of software
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_01: and what they're supposed to do,
[00:38:08] SPEAKER_01: the parents always always feel stupid.
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_01: They're the ones that are wrong.
[00:38:13] And so if you're causing people to think,
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_01: in the best case, it's like unnecessary use of their
[00:38:22] biological resources.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_01: And in the worst case, you've now made them feel
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_01: like emotionally bad,
[00:38:28] SPEAKER_01: and they're going to associate that with a product forever.
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_01: And these are things are just kind of rolling
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_01: one into the other, so I'm going to keep going
[00:38:37] with one last thing, because they just kind of come together,
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_01: which is along with reduced friction,
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_01: it's like reduce the number of clicks or taps,
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_01: it takes for someone to accomplish something,
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_01: which is almost always exactly the wrong thing.
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_01: Like it's the easiest way,
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_01: like you could make any action in your app,
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_01: a single click or tap by just exposing
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_01: every single possibility on one screen
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_01: that scrolls for thousands and thousands
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_01: and thousands and thousands of pages.
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_01: And obviously that's terrible.
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_01: So why do people think that a little bit of that is good?
[00:39:12] And here's an example, the open menu,
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_01: there's 14 things that people might want to do.
[00:39:20] Okay, level one is group them into like items
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_01: and put a vertical, sorry, horizontal divider between them.
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_01: So at least people can kind of chunk and see what there is.
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_01: Step two is present the two or three most common things
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_01: or the five most common things wherever
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_01: and then have some form of other,
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_01: and then you go to a sub menu that has more items.
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_01: And the decision of like how to tune that
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_01: becomes incredibly important.
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna pick on Google again,
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_01: just because it is, I feel like a Donald Trump here,
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_01: but I mean interrupt myself again with a story.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_01: It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_01: some, some conference or event in our road was,
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_01: and this is probably eight years ago,
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_01: and it's, we're in the bar after the session is ended
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_01: and the thing and John Callsson from Stripe is there.
[00:40:12] And Sundar CEO of Google is there
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_01: and John, he's, Patrick goes up to Sundar,
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_01: and they can talk about anything, right?
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_01: Like, yeah, Stripe wasn't the he myth it was now
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_01: at that point, but it's still like a, you know,
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_01: a significant company was up and humming.
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_01: And what does Patrick want to talk to Sundar about?
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_01: It's in the Gmail at the dragging of people,
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_01: like when you reply all to a message,
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_01: you often want to change the two recipient to the CC
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_01: and move someone from CC to two or something like that.
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_01: And just how physically, like the degree of dexterity
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_01: that's required to do that inside of the Gmail is very high,
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_01: it still hasn't been fixed, but it really struck me
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_01: that like, you know, Patrick, the asked for anything,
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_01: like it had been any top, he could have been a partnership,
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_01: it was like, it was so irritating to him
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_01: that it worked like this and couldn't, couldn't click it over it.
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_01: So anyway, back to bashing on Google,
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_01: who in many respects do an incredible job
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_01: and there's all kinds of amazing stuff they do in Bago.
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_01: But the Gmail actions on an individual email
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_01: are broken into two very long menu items that are different.
[00:41:29] And one of them doesn't exist on either menu.
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_01: There's an unlabeled icon is the only way to do it.
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_01: And that's not to mark something as unread once it's read.
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_01: I have no idea why some of the actions are in one menu
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_01: and some of the actions are in another menu.
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_01: I think it's because some of them have to do
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_01: with that individual email, some of them have to do
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_01: with the whole thread, but it doesn't seem very consistent.
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_01: Every possible thing is listed there in one place.
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_01: And so it becomes incredibly difficult to use
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_01: because sometimes you have to tap in both,
[00:42:04] tap with me is read all of the options and say,
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_01: okay, I've used the process of the elimination
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_01: and it's not here so it must be there.
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_01: Uber doesn't work like this anymore,
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_01: but when I first brought this up to people inside of Slack,
[00:42:17] there was a moment when the Uber app,
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_01: when you opened it was just,
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_01: where would you like to go and other?
[00:42:24] And other was everything.
[00:42:26] Like change your payment method,
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_01: say your location, anything you could do in Uber.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_01: And that was perfect because almost all the time
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_01: people just wanted to choose where they wanted to go.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes you wanted to change where your pickup was
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_01: because you weren't there yet or whatever.
[00:42:42] And that was just like, what could be simpler than,
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna tell you where I wanna go
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_01: or I'm gonna choose something else.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_01: I really tried to push people to what is the thing that people,
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: or what is the two things,
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_01: or what is maybe three things that people could want to do here.
[00:42:55] SPEAKER_01: And then put everything behind other.
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_01: And then if it takes then eight clicks for taps
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_01: to do something, but every single one is trivial easy,
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_01: that's great.
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_01: If it, you know, you reduce that to two clicks or taps,
[00:43:11] SPEAKER_01: but every part of it is this fraught decision
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_01: where I'm opening all of them in here
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_01: and trying to figure out like which thing is the right thing.
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_01: And like the more comparing three things to each other
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_01: is this difficult, four things.
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_01: It's kind of like geometrically more expensive
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_01: to compare 15 different options all to the other
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_01: to see if this is the one that you might want.
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_01: That you know, just becomes impossibly expensive.
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_01: So to me those are all really connected.
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_01: And if people could get over the idea of reducing friction
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_01: as a number of goals or reducing the number of clicks or taps
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_01: and do something and instead focus on how can I make this simple?
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_01: How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software?
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_01: How can I make this trivial easy?
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_01: One last example, because this was really influential for me.
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_01: So I was going back and forth in Vancouver in San Francisco
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_01: at the time when we were talking about all this inside of Slack.
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_01: And it was behind a teenager in line to board the plane.
[00:44:03] SPEAKER_01: And it was like, you know, we're on the jet wave.
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_01: It took a long time.
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_01: And I was watching her use Snapchat and it was insane.
[00:44:10] Like she was tapping at least four times a second,
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_01: sometimes like six or seven times a second.
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_01: It was like dismissing stories and do stuff.
[00:44:19] But there was a fluidity to it because everything was like
[00:44:22] SPEAKER_01: at dead, the drama, see this again.
[00:44:23] SPEAKER_01: Do I want to see the next story from this person to around?
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_01: So it showed a different person to I'm like, instead she,
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_01: she, um, an notification came up.
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_01: She answered someone's thing.
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_01: She took her selfie ever so everything was just like,
[00:44:33] SPEAKER_01: she was tapping four times a second for six minutes.
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_01: I mean, probably there were some breaks in there.
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_01: And that was like the highest and best use of Snapchat
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_01: for a 15 year old girl in 2016 or whenever that was.
[00:44:53] And imagine if the goal was to try to make her cap less,
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_01: you know, like how, how much of an impediment
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_01: would have been to the experience that both her and Snapchat
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_01: wanted to create?
[00:45:06] It's so fun to listen to this.
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_00: And the examples you gave of it gives us a lot of insight
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_00: into the way your mind works of just constantly unsatisfied
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_00: with the way other products work with your products.
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's core like Patrick is a good example
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_00: of striper.
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_00: I feel like that's a recurring theme with very successful product
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_00: leaders is just constantly unsatisfied and unhappy
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_00: with how things work.
[00:45:27] Yeah.
[00:45:27] I love just even the way you summarize this.
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_00: It's just like a really good reframing of instead of obsessing
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_00: with reducing friction and reducing steps instead
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_00: think, how do I reduce the amount of thinking the user
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_00: has to do?
[00:45:43] SPEAKER_00: I've never heard of it described as like,
[00:45:44] SPEAKER_00: you have to think about the ATP and glucose being
[00:45:46] SPEAKER_00: used to actually think in your goal is to reduce that
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_00: versus let's just reduce friction, reduce clicks.
[00:45:52] Yeah.
[00:45:52] I think in my more cynical examples,
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_01: I would say to people like stop.
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_01: Stop what you're doing for a second.
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_01: Close your eyes, take a couple of deep breaths,
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_01: and then pretend that you're an actual human being
[00:46:08] and open their eyes again and then look at this thing
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_01: and see can you figure out what it's supposed to do
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_01: or say or what action you're in, it's supposed to take
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_01: or what the impact will be if you take that action.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_01: There's a whole nother related cycle.
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_01: But before I get into it because I know that I'm for both,
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: I want to wrap up your last example of people being
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_01: unsatisfied.
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_01: So here's the quote that I was trying to find.
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_01: This is 2014.
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_01: So like that was the year that Slack actually launched
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_01: officially in February and this is now near the end of the year.
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_01: I was interviewed by MIT Technology Review and asked
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_01: if we were working to improve Slack.
[00:46:51] I said, oh God, yeah.
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_01: I try to instill this into the rest of the team,
[00:46:55] SPEAKER_01: but certainly I feel like what we have right now
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_01: is just a giant piece of shit.
[00:46:59] Like it's just terrible and we should be humiliated
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_01: that we offer this to the public.
[00:47:03] Not everyone finds that motivational though.
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_01: So I came into the office the next day
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_01: and people had printed out on like 40 pieces of eight
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_01: and a half by 11 paper of that quote and like
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_01: and paced it on the wall.
[00:47:15] SPEAKER_01: But to me that was like, you should be embarrassed by it.
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_01: Like it should be a perpetual desire to produce
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_01: that would be like, oh, this is great.
[00:47:26] SPEAKER_01: And you could be proud of individual pieces of work.
[00:47:29] SPEAKER_01: But in the aggregate, if you can't see
[00:47:32] almost limitless opportunities to improve,
[00:47:35] SPEAKER_01: then you shouldn't be deciding the product
[00:47:38] SPEAKER_01: where you shouldn't be in charge of the company.
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_01: Or you shouldn't, yeah.
[00:47:43] Almost nothing.
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_01: You know, again, you could reduce it down
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_01: to a tiny feature.
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_01: Is anywhere close to perfect?
[00:47:50] And if A, that's acknowledged freely
[00:47:53] SPEAKER_01: inside the organization,
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_01: the people think about like continually improving
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_01: as the goal and that could be like six sigmatoiota, kaisen,
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_01: like that kind of side of thing.
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_01: Or it could be that story that,
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_01: I can't remember.
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_01: I started Bridgewater,
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_01: tells about Michael Dahlio.
[00:48:12] Yeah, right, Dahlio in his book talks about
[00:48:15] Michael Jordan learning to ski.
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_01: Every time he messed up,
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_01: he wanted to ski as art or to tell him
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_01: exactly what he was doing wrong.
[00:48:23] Because to him, every one of those was like a gem
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_01: that he could collect and he could actually
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_01: become a good skier.
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_01: And what he wanted to do was become a good skier.
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_01: That requires a lot of trust inside the organization.
[00:48:35] SPEAKER_01: But if you can get to the point where like,
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_01: hey, we're trying to find improvements,
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_01: we're trying to be critical because you're trying
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_01: to make this as great as it can possibly be.
[00:48:46] Not always, not with every person,
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_01: but most of the time with most people,
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_01: you can get them to the point
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_01: where that like really direct criticism
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_01: is actually motivational.
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: It is like, you know, people are
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_01: grateful to have like the feedback
[00:49:01] SPEAKER_01: whether that's coming from their peers
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_01: inside the company or from end users of the product.
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_01: Because you realize, oh yeah, that is bad.
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_01: And we should fix it.
[00:49:10] This episode is brought to you by Lovable.

[00:49:58] SPEAKER_00: That's lovable.dev.
[00:50:01] This makes me think about, let's call it a rant
[00:50:03] SPEAKER_00: that you have about how it takes a lot of work
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_00: to make anything work at all.
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_00: That just the default state is not working.
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_00: You just share what you share there.
[00:50:13] Yeah.
[00:50:14] SPEAKER_01: This is a lot to do with.
[00:50:19] And maybe this is more recent,
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_01: another shows up in politics a lot for me.
[00:50:24] But by the way, if anyone listening to this
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_01: can help me find this tweet store
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_01: from somewhere between 2016 and 2020,
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_01: I don't have a precise idea.
[00:50:34] SPEAKER_01: And this guy's thread about how hard it was
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_01: to get a stop sign setup.
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_01: I believe it was in response to someone claiming
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_01: that Bitcoin is going to replace US dollars.
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_01: There's something about crypto.
[00:50:48] SPEAKER_01: And his point was like, here's what happened
[00:50:50] SPEAKER_01: when we tried to get a stop sign put up
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_01: on a residential street in my neighborhood.
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_01: And the literal years it took
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_01: and the numbered agencies that were involved
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_01: like the engineering department, traffic planners,
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_01: the H.A. way, I don't remember all of the organizations
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_01: because I did that I could search better
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_01: and find this again, because it was truly a masterpiece
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_01: of how difficult it is to get a stop sign
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_01: put up in most places.
[00:51:16] The message that I hear from most politicians
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_01: and unfortunately this works really well is,
[00:51:22] SPEAKER_01: things should be good, but they're not
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_01: because someone is doing something bad
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_01: which is preventing the goodness.
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_01: So billionaires are making things enough affordable
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_01: or immigrants are taking your jobs
[00:51:37] SPEAKER_01: or lazy free loaders are sucking off a government team
[00:51:42] SPEAKER_01: and causing us all have to pay more taxes or something like that.
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_01: The reality is almost nothing works.
[00:51:48] SPEAKER_01: It's actually another cost in this case.
[00:51:51] SPEAKER_01: John has a great encapsulation of this.
[00:51:53] SPEAKER_01: I'm sure you've been familiar with it
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_01: like that it ends with the world is a museum
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_01: of passion projects because for anything to get that
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: at all requires like not just the resources
[00:52:06] SPEAKER_01: and effort required to instantiate that thing
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_01: in the real world, but all of the politicking
[00:52:13] SPEAKER_01: and the sociology and the convincing
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_01: and there's a book called Why Nothing Works recently
[00:52:19] SPEAKER_01: which is like it's not an I'm sorry to the author
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_01: if they're out there listening,
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_01: but just it's not like an amazingly written book.
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_01: I found it like a little bit repetitive
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_01: but the content was really incredible
[00:52:35] SPEAKER_01: which is explaining why it's so hard
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_01: and how there's this progressive increase
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: in the number of of vetoes that are available
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_01: for any kind of course of action
[00:52:46] SPEAKER_01: and how difficult it is and this shows up
[00:52:48] SPEAKER_01: in permitting for new construction and stuff like that
[00:52:52] SPEAKER_01: but it also shows up obviously inside of organizations
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_01: and the challenge is that people A,
[00:52:59] SPEAKER_01: I think this is evolutionary biological,
[00:53:03] it's hard for us to understand the world.
[00:53:05] SPEAKER_01: Except by anthropomorphizing it and so it like
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_01: if it didn't rain this year, it's because a God is mad
[00:53:13] SPEAKER_01: and probably because we didn't sacrifice enough goats
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_01: which I've been last year.
[00:53:18] SPEAKER_01: It's hard for people to challenge just that
[00:53:21] while weather is incredibly complex and chaotic
[00:53:24] SPEAKER_01: and ecosystems and climatology,
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_01: but it's the same thing with the world.
[00:53:28] SPEAKER_01: If I am struggling to pay all of my bells
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_01: and be able to afford a little bit of luxury
[00:53:37] in the sense of a complication or a present for my kids
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_01: or whatever, it's gotta be somebody's fault
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_01: like grassy need a decision that's made somewhere
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_01: and the reality is everything is so complicated.
[00:53:49] SPEAKER_01: Everything is so multivariate.
[00:53:52] It's not satisfying, it's a terrible political message.
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_01: It's much easier to say that there is like,
[00:53:59] SPEAKER_01: oh, we understand why things are bad
[00:54:01] SPEAKER_01: in the way that you're concerned about
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_01: and it turns out that it's someone's decision
[00:54:06] SPEAKER_01: and because of them, it's bad.
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_01: And so if we got rid of them or we're able
[00:54:12] SPEAKER_01: to overcome their decision, overturn it
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_01: and institute our own thing,
[00:54:17] SPEAKER_01: then films would be good for you.
[00:54:19] SPEAKER_01: And this really, to me, shows up inside
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_01: of those organizations as well.
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_01: I'll pause there.
[00:54:25] I know kind of along those lines,
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_00: you're a big believer in something called Parkinson's law.
[00:54:31] Yeah, so the original of that is,
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_01: I think it's in 1956,
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_01: it's an article in the Economist by Parkinson.
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_01: And the Maxim is work expands to fill
[00:54:44] SPEAKER_01: the time available for its completion.
[00:54:47] And the way that it shows up, this is a little bit subtle.
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_01: So one of the things I found,
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_01: since I don't have a job is there's much less time pressure
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_01: and that max and like a few lots of mean
[00:55:01] SPEAKER_01: don't give it to a busy person.
[00:55:02] SPEAKER_01: The inverse is also true that like,
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_01: if you're not that busy,
[00:55:06] SPEAKER_01: wow, basic things take a really long time.
[00:55:09] SPEAKER_01: And so Parkinson actually starts off with his example
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_01: of like writing and posting a letter
[00:55:14] SPEAKER_01: and it might not remember who he used
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_01: with a first example,
[00:55:17] SPEAKER_01: but someone who's like incredibly busy
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_01: and has all these things they have to respond to
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_01: and then another case like a retired robot
[00:55:21] who has all the time in the room
[00:55:22] SPEAKER_01: that takes her a long time to write the letter,
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_01: takes her a long time to put it in the envelope
[00:55:26] SPEAKER_01: and then go to the post office and post it.
[00:55:28] But the real meat of it is,
[00:55:33] for me later what he talks about,
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_01: the size of the organization.
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_01: And he uses a bunch of examples.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: This is again 1950s, so he's British,
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_01: sorry, he's looking at the Royal Navy
[00:55:45] SPEAKER_01: and specifically he's looking at a chart
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_01: that shows the relationship between the number of capital ships
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_01: in the Navy, the number of sailors
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_01: and the number of administrators.
[00:55:54] SPEAKER_01: And very familiar graph for people looking at like,
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_01: any part of government,
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_01: any part of the relationship between the number of administrators
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_01: at a university and the number of students and faculty
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_01: teaching faculty, where it's like, okay,
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_01: the number of ships goes like this
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_01: and the number of sailors is looking right along with it
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_01: and the number of administrators goes like this.
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_01: And the reason this ties into the work expands
[00:56:17] SPEAKER_01: to fill the time available for its completion
[00:56:20] SPEAKER_01: is people hire and the train.
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_01: And here's the kind of sad truth
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_01: for anyone running a company is there are exceptions,
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_01: there's like certain types of engineers
[00:56:35] SPEAKER_01: that are accepting to this,
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_01: but the overwhelming majority of people you hire
[00:56:40] SPEAKER_01: want to hire more people who report to that.
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_01: And it's not because they're evil
[00:56:45] SPEAKER_01: and it's not because they're stupid,
[00:56:46] SPEAKER_01: in fact they're smart because everyone knows
[00:56:48] SPEAKER_01: that the number of people who report to you correlates
[00:56:49] SPEAKER_01: with like your career trajectory,
[00:56:52] SPEAKER_01: your amount of money that you're paid,
[00:56:54] SPEAKER_01: amount of authority you have inside your organization
[00:56:56] SPEAKER_01: and on and on and on.
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_01: So we would hire 27-doral product managers
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_01: and Slack who immediately want to hire someone.
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_01: It's like, what the hell, what would that person do?
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_01: And they articulate it this way,
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_01: but essentially it's like,
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_01: well that person would do the product management
[00:57:09] SPEAKER_01: and then I would do strategy.
[00:57:11] Classic.
[00:57:12] SPEAKER_01: It's really, I think the essential thing to understand
[00:57:16] SPEAKER_01: about this is it's not because people are evil
[00:57:19] SPEAKER_01: and it's not because they're stupid.
[00:57:20] SPEAKER_01: And it's to me very related to the everything is complex.
[00:57:25] And if you, maybe this is my
[00:57:30] Butterfield's live and thought about this before,
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_01: but I tweeted this a very, very long time ago,
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_01: like if you,
[00:57:37] everything is simple,
[00:57:38] SPEAKER_01: if you have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_01: So the other sign of that is like,
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_01: if something seems simple,
[00:57:46] SPEAKER_01: probably you don't understand.
[00:57:49] And you know, there's a lot of exceptions to that.
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_01: But for anything that involves a large organization
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_01: or a lot of human beings,
[00:57:57] SPEAKER_01: if the problem seems simple, you don't get it.
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_01: So every budget process,
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_01: no head of engineering, no head of sales, no CFO, no GC,
[00:58:09] SPEAKER_01: is ever gonna come back and say like,
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_01: oh, I've actually think like next year
[00:58:12] SPEAKER_01: we can just hire fewer people
[00:58:13] SPEAKER_01: or we're gonna keep it for more,
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_01: we're gonna like shrink through attrition
[00:58:17] SPEAKER_01: because we don't need anywhere people to do what we're doing.
[00:58:19] SPEAKER_01: Because they're evil, not because they're stupid.
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_01: But it's an almost overpowering impulse
[00:58:25] SPEAKER_01: inside the organization that often leads
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_01: to disastrous recefals.
[00:58:29] SPEAKER_01: And so there's a,
[00:58:30] SPEAKER_01: I'll give one example from Slack's history.
[00:58:32] SPEAKER_01: And I, you know, I have tried in the past
[00:58:35] SPEAKER_01: to disguise this example so that no one feels bad about it.
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_01: But I,
[00:58:40] fortunately the specifics are so important to the example
[00:58:43] SPEAKER_01: that it's not disguised as how,
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_01: just we animate that,
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_01: if people involved aren't stupid or evil.
[00:58:49] SPEAKER_01: And one example that's,
[00:58:52] that's from the outside.
[00:58:53] SPEAKER_01: So the example inside of Slack was,
[00:58:57] we introduced threads,
[00:58:59] SPEAKER_01: which is the ability to reply to a message inside of a channel.
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_01: And let's say you, Lenny, post a message,
[00:59:05] SPEAKER_01: I, Stuart, reply to it,
[00:59:07] SPEAKER_01: you will automatically get an notification.
[00:59:10] SPEAKER_01: And now Sarah,
[00:59:11] SPEAKER_01: later on replies to the same message,
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_01: both you and I,
[00:59:16] SPEAKER_01: as people who have posted a message will receive a notification
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_01: that there's been more activity.
[00:59:19] SPEAKER_01: And so what?
[00:59:20] SPEAKER_01: So like, you know,
[00:59:21] SPEAKER_01: every single time anyone replies to it.
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_01: So when the feature first was released
[00:59:27] SPEAKER_01: or like when we did the final product review before it was released,
[00:59:30] the input box was pre-populated
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_01: with app,
[00:59:34] SPEAKER_01: the person before you and the thread.
[00:59:37] And I, you know,
[00:59:39] SPEAKER_01: I was using feature and I would like,
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_01: put the insertion point there,
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_01: select all delete and then start writing my message.
[00:59:45] And it's even if I wanted to add someone specifically,
[00:59:50] SPEAKER_01: I almost never wanted to start my sentence with at,
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_01: because it just made it hard to,
[00:59:55] you know, reference what they were saying before.
[00:59:57] SPEAKER_01: So I said, get rid of this because,
[00:59:59] SPEAKER_01: I think most people won't use it or if they,
[01:00:03] if you did want to add someone,
[01:00:05] SPEAKER_01: they're not going to want to do it to begin the sentence.
[01:00:07] SPEAKER_01: And by the way,
[01:00:08] SPEAKER_01: you're teaching them to use the product prompt
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_01: because it's important that everyone understand
[01:00:13] SPEAKER_01: that every previous poster in this thread
[01:00:15] SPEAKER_01: will automatically receive a notification
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_01: unless they've either done.
[01:00:19] So okay, we released it.
[01:00:21] SPEAKER_01: Six months goes by and suddenly the hat thing comes back.
[01:00:25] SPEAKER_01: And so I messaged someone on the team,
[01:00:26] SPEAKER_01: I said, hey, there's been a regression at this super weird
[01:00:29] SPEAKER_01: and that would happen, but like the,
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_01: the hat thing came back.
[01:00:32] SPEAKER_01: And they said, oh no, this is some purpose.
[01:00:34] SPEAKER_01: We did a bunch of research and so I was like, what?
[01:00:38] And I went through this and it was,
[01:00:41] if I recall correctly, it wasn't even like P95,
[01:00:45] SPEAKER_01: certainty on this analysis, but it was something like,
[01:00:50] when we do this,
[01:00:51] SPEAKER_01: threads are 2.17 messages long versus 2.14 messages long
[01:00:57] SPEAKER_01: on average for when we talk to it.
[01:00:59] SPEAKER_01: And so first of all,
[01:01:02] why is a longer thread better?
[01:01:04] SPEAKER_01: Like maybe a shorter thread is better
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_01: than like if it be fewer messages
[01:01:08] SPEAKER_01: that people have to go out back and forth.
[01:01:10] Also, that's such a tiny difference.
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_01: Also, again, I don't remember the actual statistical analysis,
[01:01:17] SPEAKER_01: so I'm not gonna claim that it was,
[01:01:19] incorrect, I appreciate it.
[01:01:20] SPEAKER_01: This was outside the bounds.
[01:01:22] SPEAKER_01: It's certainly that they can have.
[01:01:24] SPEAKER_01: But the real thing was, oh my God.
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_01: So you guys put flags into the product, you A, B tested it,
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_01: you did the instrumentation, you created tables
[01:01:34] SPEAKER_01: in the database or whatever we were using,
[01:01:37] SPEAKER_01: to record all of that, you wrote queries to pull that,
[01:01:41] SPEAKER_01: you created charts based on that data,
[01:01:43] SPEAKER_01: you had meetings to discuss it.
[01:01:45] And just like kind of unpacking all of the things
[01:01:48] SPEAKER_01: that would have had to happen for this to come back.
[01:01:50] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, you know, thousands of person hours
[01:01:53] SPEAKER_01: kind of added minimum,
[01:01:54] SPEAKER_01: because any feature change at that scale of organization
[01:01:58] SPEAKER_01: is involving like a dozen people, engineering, QA,
[01:02:03] SPEAKER_01: analytics teams, product managers, user research and stuff.
[01:02:07] SPEAKER_01: Like the problem with that,
[01:02:10] SPEAKER_01: so I think it was a matter of idea, right?
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_01: But the problem with that was the difference
[01:02:16] SPEAKER_01: that you could possibly achieve
[01:02:18] SPEAKER_01: between having this feature and not having this feature
[01:02:21] SPEAKER_01: is like this much, whatever units you want.
[01:02:24] SPEAKER_01: The cost of doing the analysis was this much.
[01:02:27] SPEAKER_01: So it's guaranteed to be a loser.
[01:02:29] SPEAKER_01: Like there's just, there's no world in which
[01:02:32] SPEAKER_01: anyone could imagine putting that at previous responding
[01:02:36] SPEAKER_01: in the thread at the beginning of the message
[01:02:38] SPEAKER_01: could possibly make that much of a difference
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_01: to the quality of Slack and how much utility
[01:02:44] SPEAKER_01: it provides to people and all that.
[01:02:46] But you know that to put the feature flags in,
[01:02:50] SPEAKER_01: to ship new versions of the product,
[01:02:52] SPEAKER_01: to put the instrumentation in,
[01:02:54] SPEAKER_01: to have it all the API calls,
[01:02:56] SPEAKER_01: to record every action that people take,
[01:02:58] SPEAKER_01: to do all the analytics, to create the dashboard,
[01:03:01] SPEAKER_01: to put that, you know, paste the screenshot of that
[01:03:03] SPEAKER_01: into a Google Slides presentation,
[01:03:06] SPEAKER_01: to send the invitations to the meeting,
[01:03:07] SPEAKER_01: to be scheduled to meet,
[01:03:08] SPEAKER_01: because someone could make it to have everyone sit down
[01:03:11] SPEAKER_01: and look at the things, like, you know, guaranteed loser.
[01:03:14] SPEAKER_01: And I know that that Farid told you to ask me about this
[01:03:19] SPEAKER_01: hyper realistic work like activities.
[01:03:22] SPEAKER_01: And so here's my grand theory.
[01:03:27] SPEAKER_01: Hyper realistic work like activities
[01:03:29] SPEAKER_01: is goes along with this other concept
[01:03:31] SPEAKER_01: called known valuable work to do.
[01:03:34] SPEAKER_01: And when I say known, I mean, both you know what it is
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_01: and you know that it's valuable.
[01:03:40] SPEAKER_01: And that problem with almost every organization,
[01:03:43] SPEAKER_01: at the very beginning, you have an enormous amount of work
[01:03:46] SPEAKER_01: that you know what to do
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_01: and you know that it's gonna be valuable.
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_01: So like starting a business, open a bank account
[01:03:52] SPEAKER_01: because like there's almost infinite general value
[01:03:56] SPEAKER_01: of opening a bank account,
[01:03:57] SPEAKER_01: you have to do it.
[01:03:59] It's very simple to do.
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_01: And so at the very beginning of any startup,
[01:04:03] SPEAKER_01: they're like, I'm like creating a user's table
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_01: and I'm like doing salty passwords
[01:04:09] SPEAKER_01: and like, you're doing all the things
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_01: that are kind of absolutely necessary
[01:04:12] SPEAKER_01: and everyone knows exactly what they are.
[01:04:14] SPEAKER_01: And so like, everyone's going to work in the morning.
[01:04:16] SPEAKER_01: They're like, right on and like, I have 10 things to do.
[01:04:19] SPEAKER_01: And every single one of them is like,
[01:04:20] SPEAKER_01: somebody I know how to do and it's like,
[01:04:22] SPEAKER_01: definitely gonna be valuable.
[01:04:23] SPEAKER_01: Time goes on and the relationship
[01:04:26] SPEAKER_01: between the supply of work to do
[01:04:28] SPEAKER_01: and the demand for doing work just starts to change.
[01:04:32] SPEAKER_01: More and more people get hired.
[01:04:34] SPEAKER_01: Every part of manager wants to hire junior product manager.
[01:04:36] SPEAKER_01: Every new person, the first person you bring
[01:04:39] SPEAKER_01: on the risk and compliance team is like,
[01:04:41] SPEAKER_01: oh my God, we have so many risks
[01:04:43] SPEAKER_01: and things we have to be compliant with.
[01:04:45] SPEAKER_01: We better hire more people on my team
[01:04:46] SPEAKER_01: to do more risk and compliance work,
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_01: which probably to some degree is right.
[01:04:50] SPEAKER_01: But we're gonna have more and more of those people
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_01: and they're gonna call meetings with each other.
[01:04:54] SPEAKER_01: And now suddenly you have all these people with work to do
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_01: and you've done all the easy, obvious stuff.
[01:04:58] SPEAKER_01: And now your questions are like,
[01:05:00] SPEAKER_01: God, should we do FedRAMP high and make a Gov Slack version,
[01:05:04] SPEAKER_01: which is gonna require us to have
[01:05:06] SPEAKER_01: a wholly separate physical infrastructure
[01:05:08] SPEAKER_01: for the hardware that runs the software
[01:05:12] SPEAKER_01: and also a whole different operations team
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_01: which has only US citizens on it.
[01:05:16] SPEAKER_01: What is the possible number of dollars
[01:05:19] SPEAKER_01: that we could make doing this
[01:05:20] SPEAKER_01: and how much complexity is gonna be
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_01: when we wanna do updates to the software
[01:05:24] SPEAKER_01: to be up in two totally separate independent systems.
[01:05:26] SPEAKER_01: And it just gets out of whack.
[01:05:29] SPEAKER_01: And so people end up like if you hire 17 product marketers,
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_01: you're gonna have 17 product marketers
[01:05:35] SPEAKER_01: worth of demand for work to do.
[01:05:37] SPEAKER_01: And if you don't have sufficient supply
[01:05:39] SPEAKER_01: of product marketing work to do,
[01:05:41] SPEAKER_01: they're just gonna do other stuff.
[01:05:42] SPEAKER_01: Again, very important, not because they're stupid,
[01:05:46] SPEAKER_01: not because they're evil, but because they're like,
[01:05:48] SPEAKER_01: I'm a product marketer
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_01: and I wanna be recognized for my work
[01:05:52] SPEAKER_01: and my spouses like has criticized me
[01:05:56] SPEAKER_01: because they take like,
[01:05:57] SPEAKER_01: I should have already got promoted in the last cycle
[01:05:59] SPEAKER_01: and I really gotta demonstrate some wins here
[01:06:01] SPEAKER_01: and whatever it is.
[01:06:02] SPEAKER_01: And so people are like calling meetings with their colleagues
[01:06:05] SPEAKER_01: to preview the deck that they're gonna show
[01:06:07] SPEAKER_01: and the big meeting to get feedback
[01:06:08] SPEAKER_01: on whether they should improve some of the slides.
[01:06:11] And that hyper realistic work like activity
[01:06:14] SPEAKER_01: is superficially identical to work.
[01:06:17] SPEAKER_01: We are sitting in a conference room
[01:06:20] SPEAKER_01: and there's something being projected up there
[01:06:23] SPEAKER_01: and we're all talking about it
[01:06:24] SPEAKER_01: and that's exactly what work is.
[01:06:28] SPEAKER_01: Hopefully not all of work for everyone
[01:06:30] SPEAKER_01: inside of your company,
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_01: but that's exactly what we do when we're working
[01:06:34] SPEAKER_01: but this is actually a fake minute work
[01:06:36] SPEAKER_01: and it's so subtle that I'll do it.
[01:06:41] Our board members will do it, every exact one.
[01:06:43] SPEAKER_01: And the further you are from having
[01:06:46] SPEAKER_01: all of the context and all of the information
[01:06:48] SPEAKER_01: and the decision making authority and stuff like that.
[01:06:52] SPEAKER_01: The easier it is to get trapped in the stuff
[01:06:54] SPEAKER_01: and people will just perform
[01:06:56] SPEAKER_01: enormous amounts of hyper realistic work like activities
[01:06:58] SPEAKER_01: and have no idea that that's what they're doing.
[01:07:00] SPEAKER_01: And the result of that I guess is that
[01:07:04] SPEAKER_01: if you are a leader, if you're managing a director
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_01: and I'm an executive, if you're the CEO,
[01:07:09] SPEAKER_01: it's on you to ensure that there is sufficient supply
[01:07:12] SPEAKER_01: of known valuable work to do.
[01:07:15] SPEAKER_01: And they're almost what we say is,
[01:07:17] SPEAKER_01: but it's creating the clarity around that,
[01:07:20] SPEAKER_01: creating the alignment,
[01:07:21] SPEAKER_01: making sure everyone understands it,
[01:07:23] SPEAKER_01: that's what they're supposed to be doing
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_01: and then obviously doing it.
[01:07:26] SPEAKER_01: Amazing, I could listen to a store of ranz all day.
[01:07:29] SPEAKER_00: Hyper realistic work like activities.
[01:07:32] SPEAKER_00: We eat a coin this.
[01:07:34] SPEAKER_00: And then, of course,
[01:07:34] SPEAKER_00: they doesn't make a good acronym,
[01:07:35] SPEAKER_01: that's pretty ugly.
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's try.
[01:07:38] And just to close the loop on that,
[01:07:40] SPEAKER_00: the solution is the leader recognizing this is happening
[01:07:43] SPEAKER_00: and stopping it,
[01:07:44] SPEAKER_00: telling people, why are we spending time
[01:07:46] SPEAKER_00: on this thing that is not going to get us anywhere?
[01:07:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and that,
[01:07:50] what you just said probably isn't the best way
[01:07:52] SPEAKER_01: because that sounds like you're,
[01:07:54] SPEAKER_01: you're chiding them and they're dumb.
[01:07:55] SPEAKER_01: What is actually your responsibility to make sure
[01:07:57] SPEAKER_01: that there's sufficient clarity around what the priorities are
[01:08:02] SPEAKER_01: and, you know,
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_01: explicitly say no to things up front and stuff like that.
[01:08:06] SPEAKER_01: Rather than words you,
[01:08:07] SPEAKER_01: hey, you guys are much audience wasting your time
[01:08:10] SPEAKER_01: on this thing that doesn't matter.
[01:08:11] SPEAKER_01: Whose fault is it?
[01:08:13] SPEAKER_01: It's an enders fault.
[01:08:14] SPEAKER_01: It's the VP of whatever's fault.
[01:08:16] SPEAKER_01: It's the CX, whatever.
[01:08:19] SPEAKER_01: It's the C, ultimately,
[01:08:20] SPEAKER_01: it's like,
[01:08:20] SPEAKER_01: it's the leader of the organization
[01:08:22] SPEAKER_01: that has the responsibility to make sure
[01:08:24] SPEAKER_01: that there is sufficient,
[01:08:26] SPEAKER_01: known valuable work to do
[01:08:29] SPEAKER_01: and that's actually harder than it might appear.
[01:08:32] SPEAKER_01: Okay, before we run out of time,
[01:08:34] SPEAKER_00: I want to touch on two other topics.
[01:08:36] SPEAKER_00: One is when people think of Sturd Butterfield,
[01:08:39] SPEAKER_00: I think a lot of people think of,
[01:08:41] SPEAKER_00: we don't sell saddles here.
[01:08:42] SPEAKER_00: Your legendary medium posts that is just sad
[01:08:46] SPEAKER_00: and I was become a historic piece of literature
[01:08:48] SPEAKER_00: in the, in the annals of product building and startups.
[01:08:52] SPEAKER_00: I haven't heard people ask you much about this recently.
[01:08:54] SPEAKER_00: So let me just ask a couple questions.
[01:08:55] SPEAKER_00: One is just, what was the,
[01:08:57] SPEAKER_00: what was the reason you put that out?
[01:08:58] SPEAKER_00: Why, what was the backstory on writing that memo?
[01:09:00] SPEAKER_00: Why was it necessary?
[01:09:01] SPEAKER_00: Well, it really was an internal memo
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_01: and there's a bit of a digression.
[01:09:09] One of the crappy things about Slack
[01:09:12] is if all your corporate communication is an email,
[01:09:16] SPEAKER_01: depending on exactly how,
[01:09:17] SPEAKER_01: it's worse than what's this need to use,
[01:09:19] SPEAKER_01: you probably walk away with an archive of everything
[01:09:21] SPEAKER_01: you said at company X.
[01:09:23] SPEAKER_01: If it's Slack, once you're turned off,
[01:09:25] SPEAKER_01: you lose access to all that history
[01:09:27] SPEAKER_01: and so it's kind of like,
[01:09:28] SPEAKER_01: oh man, if I had only exported all of my messages
[01:09:32] SPEAKER_01: before I left, I would have all this stuff.
[01:09:34] SPEAKER_01: But that was, it was absolutely verbatim.
[01:09:36] I did not change a word of what I said inside the company.
[01:09:40] SPEAKER_01: What I think we were still eight people, maybe,
[01:09:43] you know, I had most 10,
[01:09:44] SPEAKER_01: but I think it was eight people.
[01:09:45] SPEAKER_01: It was before Slack launched even.
[01:09:47] Yeah, it was before Slack launched.
[01:09:48] SPEAKER_01: It was like when we were doing a privatea
[01:09:50] SPEAKER_01: and the point of it was to like to start to instill those ideas
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_01: as early as possible
[01:09:57] SPEAKER_01: and really create this alignment inside of that small team
[01:10:01] SPEAKER_01: so that it could process to survive as we grew and scaled.
[01:10:08] And yeah, that was the idea.
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_01: And the just, just for people that aren't super familiar
[01:10:13] SPEAKER_00: with it, but willing to it is just,
[01:10:15] SPEAKER_00: it's not enough just to build a great product.
[01:10:18] SPEAKER_00: You just as much have to put effort into communicating
[01:10:21] SPEAKER_00: what this does for them, the problem this is solving for them.
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_00: The outcome, this is gonna achieve for them.
[01:10:26] SPEAKER_00: Is that a good way to think about it?
[01:10:27] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and again, you know, comparing it to beer or cars,
[01:10:34] beer goes back to pre-civilization cars were obviously mad,
[01:10:37] SPEAKER_01: didn't, but at some point you had to convince people
[01:10:40] SPEAKER_01: that I they would win a car instead of a horse.
[01:10:43] For your new AI based recruiting tool
[01:10:50] SPEAKER_01: or your calendar app or whatever,
[01:10:53] SPEAKER_01: there's some reason why people, you think that people should use
[01:10:56] SPEAKER_01: the doors instead of the thing that they're using now,
[01:10:58] SPEAKER_01: which might be like a wholesale one-for-one replacement
[01:11:00] SPEAKER_01: or more often is like a change in the way that you're working
[01:11:04] SPEAKER_01: that has a bunch of other adjacencies
[01:11:05] SPEAKER_01: and you want to expand into these other categories.
[01:11:07] SPEAKER_01: But you're not just responsible for creating the product,
[01:11:11] SPEAKER_01: but also to sort of creating the market
[01:11:13] SPEAKER_01: and creating, you know, this is book, Position,
[01:11:17] SPEAKER_01: which is an absolute classic.
[01:11:18] SPEAKER_01: It's very short, I would recommend everyone read it
[01:11:20] SPEAKER_01: where the point of it is, from my perspective,
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_01: it's almost impossible to create a new idea
[01:11:28] SPEAKER_01: in someone's head, it's much easier to take a couple
[01:11:31] SPEAKER_01: of existing ideas and put them together.
[01:11:34] SPEAKER_01: So it's much easier to say, it's like,
[01:11:36] SPEAKER_01: jaws meet starwares, so it's Uber for pets
[01:11:39] SPEAKER_01: or something like that, then to come up with like an actual
[01:11:42] SPEAKER_01: new idea, but you have to do that.
[01:11:45] SPEAKER_01: Because if your thing is different
[01:11:49] in any significant way from the alternatives,
[01:11:52] SPEAKER_01: you're not just creating the product,
[01:11:53] SPEAKER_01: you're creating the market.
[01:11:54] SPEAKER_01: You're really kind of one in the same.
[01:11:56] The reason I wanted to touch on it is I think still,
[01:11:58] SPEAKER_00: people continue to not listen to this advice
[01:12:01] SPEAKER_00: and continue to over invest in more features,
[01:12:04] SPEAKER_00: more products, things like that.
[01:12:06] SPEAKER_00: Just the specific example of we don't sell saddles here,
[01:12:09] SPEAKER_00: just to quickly communicate this to folks
[01:12:11] SPEAKER_00: and correct me if I'm missing anything is just instead of,
[01:12:13] SPEAKER_00: hey, look at this amazing saddle we've bought,
[01:12:15] SPEAKER_00: which we want to communicate is here,
[01:12:16] SPEAKER_00: go horseback riding, look at this incredible experience
[01:12:19] SPEAKER_00: you can have and they decide, oh, should I need
[01:12:22] SPEAKER_00: a go buy saddle to do that?
[01:12:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and 100% that aspect of it is not a bad joke
[01:12:29] SPEAKER_01: because I think that's something that workers
[01:12:30] SPEAKER_01: have done for a long time,
[01:12:31] SPEAKER_01: truly in the Marcom and advertising,
[01:12:34] SPEAKER_01: like if you want to sell Harley Davidson's,
[01:12:35] SPEAKER_01: there are people who are going to geek out on the engines
[01:12:38] SPEAKER_01: and stuff like that and like the quality
[01:12:39] SPEAKER_01: that leather and stuff like that.
[01:12:40] SPEAKER_01: But what you're selling is on the motorcycle,
[01:12:42] SPEAKER_01: you're selling like the open road and freedom
[01:12:44] SPEAKER_01: and the wind in your hair.
[01:12:45] SPEAKER_01: And if you're Louis Lehmann, you are obviously selling
[01:12:48] SPEAKER_01: in yoga pants, but you're also selling like health
[01:12:50] SPEAKER_01: and aspiration and being the best version of yourself.
[01:12:54] SPEAKER_01: And a bunch of other stuff.
[01:12:55] SPEAKER_01: So selling that, oh my God,
[01:12:57] I forgot the classic version of it, you know, like,
[01:13:00] there's the ship.
[01:13:00] That's selling this,
[01:13:01] SPEAKER_00: the sort of the screwdriver.
[01:13:03] SPEAKER_01: Oh, oh yeah, the nail.
[01:13:05] SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, the nail.
[01:13:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the nail.
[01:13:06] SPEAKER_01: Anyway.
[01:13:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, what is that one?
[01:13:09] There's the one I think about is instead
[01:13:11] SPEAKER_00: of trying to convince men to build a ship,
[01:13:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm still a yearning for the sea.
[01:13:15] SPEAKER_00: Yes, exactly.
[01:13:17] SPEAKER_01: That's the way that goes back in history.
[01:13:21] Okay, let me ask you about pivoting.
[01:13:23] SPEAKER_00: You are potentially the king of pivots.
[01:13:26] SPEAKER_00: You started two companies, both famously pivoted,
[01:13:28] SPEAKER_00: both from video games, which is why I asked you about that
[01:13:30] SPEAKER_00: at the beginning, into very successful companies.
[01:13:34] SPEAKER_00: I imagine many people come to you for advice on pivoting.
[01:13:36] SPEAKER_00: Let me just ask, when folks come to you asking,
[01:13:39] SPEAKER_00: should I stick with my idea?
[01:13:40] SPEAKER_00: Should I pivot?
[01:13:41] SPEAKER_00: What sort of advice do you find most helps them?
[01:13:43] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I think it's partly,
[01:13:51] an intuition because obviously the decision is about
[01:13:54] SPEAKER_01: like, have you exhausted the possibilities?
[01:13:57] And in the case where we are working on glitch,
[01:14:00] SPEAKER_01: this game where we used IRC for internal communication
[01:14:03] SPEAKER_01: and we added a bunch of IRC, which became the proto-slack.
[01:14:06] SPEAKER_01: And I think Slack had an enormous advantage
[01:14:10] SPEAKER_01: in the fact that we are working on this for several years
[01:14:12] SPEAKER_01: without actually explicitly working on it
[01:14:14] SPEAKER_01: and only doing the minimum number of features
[01:14:18] SPEAKER_01: that were absolutely guaranteed to be successful
[01:14:22] SPEAKER_01: in the sense that it was so irritating,
[01:14:24] SPEAKER_01: we couldn't stand it anymore
[01:14:25] SPEAKER_01: or such an obvious improvement
[01:14:26] SPEAKER_01: that we couldn't help but take advantage of.
[01:14:29] SPEAKER_01: We still had like $9 million left
[01:14:31] SPEAKER_01: and everyone still liked the game
[01:14:33] SPEAKER_01: and we were all happy working on it.
[01:14:34] SPEAKER_01: But I think by that point, I had exhausted every non-brediculous,
[01:14:41] SPEAKER_01: long shot idea to make it commercially successful.
[01:14:47] And so decided to abandon it.
[01:14:52] But the default advice for anyone in anything is persevere
[01:14:59] SPEAKER_01: is like, you know, kitten hanging off the branch
[01:15:00] SPEAKER_01: and the poster says, hang in there.
[01:15:02] SPEAKER_01: And I think there's an idea that you just like,
[01:15:06] and then there's so many stories of like,
[01:15:09] so and so started out going door to door
[01:15:11] SPEAKER_01: and was rejected by everyone
[01:15:13] SPEAKER_01: and then suddenly there was Nike or something like that.
[01:15:16] SPEAKER_01: And then just if you stick out,
[01:15:17] SPEAKER_01: stick it with it long enough,
[01:15:18] SPEAKER_01: you'll eventually be successful.
[01:15:20] SPEAKER_01: I think you have to really be coldly rational
[01:15:24] SPEAKER_01: and now some of this shows up in the book,
[01:15:28] SPEAKER_01: thinking about some of it's in any second book,
[01:15:32] SPEAKER_01: the title of which I'm forgetting right now
[01:15:33] SPEAKER_01: but in someone will know it.
[01:15:35] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, she actually uses it.
[01:15:36] SPEAKER_01: And then it was the last second I forget.
[01:15:39] She actually uses glitch and slack as an example
[01:15:42] SPEAKER_01: of like a smart fold basically.
[01:15:46] SPEAKER_01: My expected value here has diminished to the point
[01:15:50] SPEAKER_01: where this alternative looks more attractive.
[01:15:54] SPEAKER_01: And the reason I say you have to be coldly rational
[01:15:56] SPEAKER_01: about it is because it's fucking humiliating.
[01:15:58] SPEAKER_01: You know, like we, I convinced so many,
[01:16:02] SPEAKER_01: and you have to convince somebody to be able to get
[01:16:04] SPEAKER_01: a company out there, you have to go to investors,
[01:16:06] SPEAKER_01: you have to go to early employees
[01:16:08] SPEAKER_01: and say like, you should leave her other job
[01:16:09] SPEAKER_01: and come work for this because, you know,
[01:16:11] here's the incredible feature we're imagining.
[01:16:14] SPEAKER_01: I've figured it out and you have to make all these promises
[01:16:16] SPEAKER_01: and you have users and you feel like committed things
[01:16:17] SPEAKER_01: to the users and you've convinced them
[01:16:19] SPEAKER_01: to give up their time for this thing.
[01:16:21] SPEAKER_01: And so it's, I think for a lot of people,
[01:16:24] SPEAKER_01: it feels better to just keep doing it until it dies
[01:16:30] SPEAKER_01: of suffocation due to lack of capital
[01:16:33] SPEAKER_01: or something like that.
[01:16:36] SPEAKER_01: Then to admit like, okay, I was wrong,
[01:16:39] SPEAKER_01: this didn't work and it's, it's humiliating,
[01:16:42] SPEAKER_01: it's painful, it's like, it's wrenching,
[01:16:45] SPEAKER_01: it hasn't met impact, you know,
[01:16:46] SPEAKER_01: like when we shut down glitch,
[01:16:47] SPEAKER_01: there's a lot of people who loved it
[01:16:49] SPEAKER_01: and would spend all of their free time
[01:16:50] SPEAKER_01: and couldn't wait to get home from work to go play it more
[01:16:53] SPEAKER_01: and that was their community
[01:16:54] SPEAKER_01: and the community just like disappeared
[01:16:55] SPEAKER_01: all these people and all these identities have been created
[01:16:58] SPEAKER_01: and obviously people lost their jobs
[01:17:00] SPEAKER_01: and people who had like moved their families
[01:17:03] SPEAKER_01: to a different city in order to take this job.
[01:17:05] SPEAKER_01: Now we're gonna have a job anymore.
[01:17:07] SPEAKER_01: So Piff, that's something I take lightly
[01:17:09] SPEAKER_01: and you shouldn't be home.
[01:17:13] I think it's very different to be like,
[01:17:16] there's three of us and we started making this app
[01:17:18] SPEAKER_01: and then we pivoted to a different app.
[01:17:21] SPEAKER_01: That doesn't even really count.
[01:17:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like if you're six months into something,
[01:17:25] you're just, you're still messing around
[01:17:26] SPEAKER_01: and you try to figure out what it is that you're building.
[01:17:28] SPEAKER_01: It's not really a pivot.
[01:17:30] Obviously in this case, it worked out great
[01:17:33] SPEAKER_01: and there's survivorship bias
[01:17:35] SPEAKER_01: and that doesn't mean that everyone should pivot all the time.
[01:17:38] SPEAKER_01: But I think it is creating the distance
[01:17:41] SPEAKER_01: so that you can make an intellectual
[01:17:45] rational decision about it
[01:17:47] SPEAKER_01: rather than a much more efficient is essential.
[01:17:50] I love all-serial piece of advice I've just exhausted.
[01:17:52] SPEAKER_00: Once you've exhausted all the ideas,
[01:17:53] SPEAKER_00: that's a really good time to see what else is out there.
[01:17:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's just all the good ideas.
[01:17:59] SPEAKER_01: All the good ideas.
[01:18:00] SPEAKER_00: All the realistic, yeah.
[01:18:01] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the point you made about just kind of persevering,
[01:18:05] SPEAKER_00: I just had Melanie Perkins,
[01:18:06] SPEAKER_00: you have Canva in the podcast.
[01:18:08] SPEAKER_00: They went through a hundred investors rejected her
[01:18:10] SPEAKER_00: before somebody finally decided to invest
[01:18:13] SPEAKER_00: and she'd just kept pushing.
[01:18:14] Yeah, I think that's a slightly different example, Rick,
[01:18:16] SPEAKER_01: is to look at the, she believed in the,
[01:18:19] yeah, then she then she believed in the,
[01:18:21] SPEAKER_01: in the concept of the, in the product
[01:18:23] SPEAKER_01: and like in the, in the vision,
[01:18:24] SPEAKER_01: I was just trying to figure out the right articulation
[01:18:26] SPEAKER_01: to get investors who,
[01:18:28] SPEAKER_01: and let me obviously, very, very happy.
[01:18:30] SPEAKER_01: Extremely happy, oh geez.
[01:18:33] SPEAKER_00: Okay, maybe a final topic depending on how time goes.
[01:18:36] SPEAKER_00: I want to talk about generosity.
[01:18:39] I talked to a bunch of people, as I said,
[01:18:41] SPEAKER_00: that have worked with you.
[01:18:42] SPEAKER_00: And the number one theme that came up again
[01:18:44] SPEAKER_00: and again and again, when I asked them about you
[01:18:46] SPEAKER_00: and what they, what they have stuck most with them
[01:18:48] SPEAKER_00: is, is just generosity.
[01:18:51] SPEAKER_00: So I'm going to read a few examples that I heard from folks
[01:18:53] SPEAKER_00: that are examples of your generosity over the years.
[01:18:57] SPEAKER_00: So one person shared that he needed a little money
[01:19:00] SPEAKER_00: before Christmas and you said,
[01:19:02] SPEAKER_00: Stuart literally walked me out of the building,
[01:19:04] SPEAKER_00: went to the cash machine, handed me $500,
[01:19:08] SPEAKER_00: told me to go home to my family.
[01:19:10] Other folks shared that when you,
[01:19:12] SPEAKER_00: you talked about glitch just recently,
[01:19:13] SPEAKER_00: when you had to lay people off that you cried real tears
[01:19:16] SPEAKER_00: when you were laying people off
[01:19:17] SPEAKER_00: and then you spent an incredible amount of time
[01:19:19] SPEAKER_00: helping them find new jobs
[01:19:21] SPEAKER_00: and extending their severance pay
[01:19:22] SPEAKER_00: and just taking it extremely, extremely seriously
[01:19:25] SPEAKER_00: much more than I think most people,
[01:19:27] SPEAKER_00: you like to do.
[01:19:29] SPEAKER_00: So when I'll share that you paid 100% of employees' health insurance
[01:19:32] SPEAKER_00: to give them just fewer things to think about,
[01:19:35] SPEAKER_00: when you went public, you did a,
[01:19:36] SPEAKER_00: you basically created the best possible situation
[01:19:39] SPEAKER_00: for employees, no lock up, direct listing.
[01:19:42] SPEAKER_00: Also with the structure of the Slack deal,
[01:19:44] SPEAKER_00: people said that acquisition is very employee friendly.
[01:19:48] SPEAKER_00: There's also just a bunch of, that's employees.
[01:19:49] SPEAKER_00: There's also just the way you thought about customers,
[01:19:51] SPEAKER_00: a few examples, you gave free credits to businesses
[01:19:54] SPEAKER_00: who were struggling to pay the bills during COVID,
[01:19:56] SPEAKER_00: you released this fair billing,
[01:19:58] SPEAKER_00: which I think was very innovative at the time
[01:20:00] SPEAKER_00: where you didn't charge,
[01:20:01] SPEAKER_00: you stopped charging people for seats they weren't using,
[01:20:03] SPEAKER_00: even though they signed the deal to charge for the seats.
[01:20:06] SPEAKER_00: A lot of times just you slipped release schedules
[01:20:09] SPEAKER_00: because you just wanted to make features better
[01:20:11] SPEAKER_00: and better for people.
[01:20:12] SPEAKER_00: And I'll end with this quote,
[01:20:14] SPEAKER_00: Stuart is a leader who takes the responsibility
[01:20:16] SPEAKER_00: he feels for his employees personally
[01:20:18] SPEAKER_00: and to which he extends the most generous circumstances
[01:20:21] SPEAKER_00: he could muster, that feels worth celebrating.
[01:20:25] So first of all, I just want to celebrate you.
[01:20:28] SPEAKER_00: I think it's really rare and inspiring
[01:20:29] SPEAKER_00: to meet a leader like that.
[01:20:32] SPEAKER_00: Clearly, you've had a lot of impact on a lot of people.
[01:20:35] I don't know exactly the question I want to ask,
[01:20:36] SPEAKER_00: but I guess was this, is this like an,
[01:20:39] SPEAKER_00: in what part is this intentional?
[01:20:40] SPEAKER_00: Just like this is how we win.
[01:20:41] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to be very generous and help people
[01:20:44] SPEAKER_00: because I know this will help long-term.
[01:20:46] SPEAKER_00: How much is this just a day
[01:20:47] SPEAKER_00: and this is just the way you are as a person?
[01:20:49] I think a lot of it is just the way I am as a person
[01:20:52] SPEAKER_01: and I had wonderful parents who raised me right,
[01:20:55] SPEAKER_01: but I think there's also,
[01:20:58] there is a little bit of a lesson there
[01:21:00] SPEAKER_01: and I'm just going to assume people's familiarity
[01:21:02] SPEAKER_01: with the prisoners to lemma.
[01:21:05] SPEAKER_01: The acts of generosity to me are a way of demonstrating
[01:21:10] SPEAKER_01: that I am going to cooperate as we iterate in the same.
[01:21:14] SPEAKER_01: And if you do that, then people will also cooperate
[01:21:17] SPEAKER_01: and you both benefit.
[01:21:19] SPEAKER_01: Whereas if you never really know
[01:21:20] SPEAKER_01: if the other person is going to defect
[01:21:22] SPEAKER_01: at the first opportunity,
[01:21:24] SPEAKER_01: then your best bet is to defect.
[01:21:27] SPEAKER_01: There's a game theoretic aspect,
[01:21:30] SPEAKER_01: usually in games that are much, much, much more complicated
[01:21:32] SPEAKER_01: than the prisoners to lemma.
[01:21:36] I think another thing,
[01:21:37] SPEAKER_01: one thing I didn't touch on before,
[01:21:41] SPEAKER_01: but Tene was important enough
[01:21:43] SPEAKER_01: that had more than one company all hands,
[01:21:46] SPEAKER_01: I made everyone in the company like repeat this as a chant.
[01:21:51] It was in the long run,
[01:21:53] SPEAKER_01: the measure of our success will be the amount of value
[01:21:56] SPEAKER_01: that we create for customers.
[01:21:59] SPEAKER_01: And I wanted to be super clear and explicit about that
[01:22:02] SPEAKER_01: because it should be,
[01:22:04] SPEAKER_01: if anything you're doing feels like a little bit shady,
[01:22:07] SPEAKER_01: a little bit cheating, a little bit like,
[01:22:11] maximizing,
[01:22:15] in the wrong moment or taking advantage of a customer
[01:22:19] SPEAKER_01: or anything like that,
[01:22:20] SPEAKER_01: we definitely shouldn't do it
[01:22:21] SPEAKER_01: because to me it was just like,
[01:22:22] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I think it's literally true.
[01:22:26] SPEAKER_01: But it's also like an ethical way to run a business
[01:22:31] SPEAKER_01: and it's not just that the ethics are good,
[01:22:35] SPEAKER_01: it's like there's advantages for you.
[01:22:36] SPEAKER_01: Like you're able to attract a better class of employee.
[01:22:38] SPEAKER_01: If all your employees are ethical,
[01:22:40] SPEAKER_01: then it's gonna be a better place for everyone to work
[01:22:42] SPEAKER_01: and you're gonna be happy
[01:22:43] SPEAKER_01: and you're gonna have fewer internal problems
[01:22:45] SPEAKER_01: and all that stuff.
[01:22:48] But I think it really is true that there's no,
[01:22:51] SPEAKER_01: especially in the long run,
[01:22:54] you can't like destroy value for your customers
[01:22:57] SPEAKER_01: and expect to be successful.
[01:22:59] SPEAKER_01: You have to actually make their lives better
[01:23:03] and you can put effort into like pointing out to them
[01:23:05] SPEAKER_01: and demonstrating that you have created this value
[01:23:08] SPEAKER_01: and stuff like that.
[01:23:09] SPEAKER_01: But there's no substitute for actually having created it.
[01:23:11] SPEAKER_01: And I think that is incredibly important
[01:23:15] SPEAKER_01: and that implies a real generosity
[01:23:18] SPEAKER_01: whether that's in negotiating terms
[01:23:22] SPEAKER_01: with an enterprise deal or that's like policy decisions.
[01:23:27] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes I'll say one time that had blew up in our face
[01:23:31] SPEAKER_01: was our SLA was like for any downtime,
[01:23:34] SPEAKER_01: you get a hundred times your money back.
[01:23:37] Which was like, because for Microsoft,
[01:23:39] SPEAKER_01: it's like, you know, if we're down for two minutes,
[01:23:41] SPEAKER_01: it doesn't, it's like pennies.
[01:23:43] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't really make any difference.
[01:23:44] SPEAKER_01: If we're down for like 10 hours or something like that,
[01:23:46] SPEAKER_01: then we have bigger problems than paying back people.
[01:23:50] Okay, fast forward, we now have hundreds of millions
[01:23:54] SPEAKER_01: of dollars in revenue and we've gone public
[01:23:56] SPEAKER_01: and like shortly after we go public,
[01:23:58] SPEAKER_01: we have one of the biggest outages we ever had.
[01:24:00] SPEAKER_01: I don't remember how long it was,
[01:24:01] SPEAKER_01: but it was like many hours.
[01:24:03] SPEAKER_01: But by the time we got that scale,
[01:24:05] SPEAKER_01: a hundred times the money back for like the third of a day
[01:24:09] SPEAKER_01: that we were down was like eight million dollars
[01:24:14] SPEAKER_01: or something like that, which had to be,
[01:24:19] it didn't cost us any money because we just gave it
[01:24:21] SPEAKER_01: to people before we're credits,
[01:24:22] SPEAKER_01: but it meant that a bunch of revenue
[01:24:24] SPEAKER_01: that we had already anticipated for the next quarter
[01:24:27] SPEAKER_01: wasn't going to show up because people's credits
[01:24:29] SPEAKER_01: were going to offset what they would have otherwise pay us.
[01:24:32] SPEAKER_01: And so we definitely changed the terms of service after that
[01:24:36] SPEAKER_01: because being a public company is a little bit different.
[01:24:39] But in every other respect,
[01:24:40] SPEAKER_01: I think that we're all really important decisions
[01:24:42] SPEAKER_01: that were helpful in us becoming successful.
[01:24:47] Was that policy, it was automatic,
[01:24:49] SPEAKER_00: like you didn't even have to claim it,
[01:24:50] SPEAKER_00: it was just automatically get this credit.
[01:24:52] SPEAKER_00: And then the default is you don't have to pay
[01:24:54] SPEAKER_01: if you let us know.
[01:24:55] SPEAKER_01: This was we will automatically like proactively,
[01:24:58] SPEAKER_01: preemptively without any input from you.
[01:25:00] SPEAKER_01: Apply this credit to your account
[01:25:02] SPEAKER_01: and just like send you a message that would happen.
[01:25:04] SPEAKER_01: And by the way, we will do it on the aggregate for downtime,
[01:25:09] SPEAKER_01: even if the issue didn't affect you as a customer.
[01:25:12] SPEAKER_01: Who, generous, you found the edge over here.
[01:25:15] SPEAKER_00: What was that mantra again that you had the company chant?
[01:25:20] SPEAKER_00: I think this is a really nice way to end it.
[01:25:22] SPEAKER_00: In the long run, the measure of our success
[01:25:25] SPEAKER_01: would be the amount of value we create for customers.
[01:25:28] Incredible.
[01:25:29] SPEAKER_00: I'm just trying to picture the entire team.
[01:25:30] SPEAKER_00: It's like, I'm just trying to say,
[01:25:32] SPEAKER_00: I'm just trying to say,
[01:25:33] SPEAKER_00: it felt very like,
[01:25:34] SPEAKER_01: Tingellong or like Stalin or something like that.
[01:25:37] SPEAKER_01: Well, on that note,
[01:25:39] SPEAKER_00: most people don't know this about you,
[01:25:40] SPEAKER_00: but your actual name when you were born is not Stuart.
[01:25:44] SPEAKER_00: It was Dharma.
[01:25:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[01:25:46] SPEAKER_00: And this all makes sense as you learn that.
[01:25:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[01:25:50] SPEAKER_01: It's like, my name is Dharma Jammy Butterfell.
[01:25:52] SPEAKER_01: So they parents named me.
[01:25:53] SPEAKER_01: And when I was 12,
[01:25:54] SPEAKER_01: they changed it because I just like,
[01:25:55] SPEAKER_01: they wanted to be normal.
[01:25:56] SPEAKER_01: And for some reason, I thought Stuart was a normal name.
[01:25:58] SPEAKER_01: And by the way, you'll notice this now that I said it.
[01:26:01] SPEAKER_01: Any character except for Stuart Little, the mouse,
[01:26:05] SPEAKER_01: anytime you see a character in a movie,
[01:26:07] SPEAKER_01: a novel, TV show, whatever,
[01:26:10] SPEAKER_01: there's only the loser Stuart and the asshole Stuart.
[01:26:14] SPEAKER_01: It's like, it's obviously in the collective consciousness,
[01:26:18] SPEAKER_01: a terrible name.
[01:26:18] SPEAKER_01: And I shouldn't have chosen it and I regret it.
[01:26:20] SPEAKER_01: By the time I realized that Dharma and Greg had already come out,
[01:26:24] SPEAKER_01: I would have seemed like I was like,
[01:26:26] you know, bandwagon jumping and people thought it was a girl's name
[01:26:29] SPEAKER_01: even though in India, it's obviously only a boy's name.
[01:26:32] I'm going to add just one last little tidbit
[01:26:34] SPEAKER_01: because I forgot about this for earlier on.
[01:26:36] SPEAKER_01: And I think it helps tie things together.
[01:26:38] SPEAKER_01: It's true.
[01:26:39] SPEAKER_01: And it's called the owner's solution.
[01:26:40] SPEAKER_01: And this is based on something that I post on Twitter.
[01:26:43] SPEAKER_01: The person who came up with the name later deleted their account.
[01:26:46] SPEAKER_01: And so I have no idea who it was,
[01:26:48] SPEAKER_01: if who to credit for this.
[01:26:49] SPEAKER_01: But what I had posted was, and this is a long time ago,
[01:26:53] SPEAKER_01: when restaurant websites got better and it doesn't really matter
[01:26:56] SPEAKER_01: because Google local was taken over everything.
[01:26:58] But this is like, let's say 10 years ago,
[01:27:00] SPEAKER_01: there's five things you could possibly want
[01:27:02] SPEAKER_01: when you go to a restaurant's website.
[01:27:04] SPEAKER_01: And is their street address, their phone number, the menu,
[01:27:09] SPEAKER_01: that hours of operation, oh my god,
[01:27:11] SPEAKER_01: or if I get into the fifth thing?
[01:27:13] Oh, and make any reservation.
[01:27:15] SPEAKER_01: How do you make your reservation?
[01:27:18] And again, this problem has, like to some extent,
[01:27:21] SPEAKER_01: taken care of, it's all for at least a brute.
[01:27:23] SPEAKER_01: But what you would get was like the super slow loading photo,
[01:27:27] SPEAKER_01: the Ken Burns effect as in class.
[01:27:30] SPEAKER_01: And like, and then like fading in.
[01:27:32] SPEAKER_01: And then some music starts playing.
[01:27:34] SPEAKER_01: And then if they show you the phone number,
[01:27:35] SPEAKER_01: it's not a clickable, and it's trying to add not even text
[01:27:39] SPEAKER_01: that you can copy because it's yes, it's an image.
[01:27:42] And they don't have the hours, they don't put the address
[01:27:44] SPEAKER_01: or whatever.
[01:27:45] SPEAKER_01: And it's just like, oh my god, what?
[01:27:47] For sure, whoever made this website for the restaurant owner
[01:27:50] SPEAKER_01: and the restaurant owner themselves
[01:27:51] SPEAKER_01: have definitely been in the position
[01:27:53] SPEAKER_01: where they went to somebody else's restaurant website
[01:27:55] SPEAKER_01: because they wanted to get the address
[01:27:57] SPEAKER_01: or that opening hours of the phone number or whatever.
[01:27:59] SPEAKER_01: So why does it end up like this?
[01:28:00] SPEAKER_01: And what should we call this?
[01:28:01] SPEAKER_01: And whoever replied to the tweet, she said,
[01:28:05] we should call the owner's delusion.
[01:28:06] SPEAKER_01: And I said, oh my god, that's perfect.
[01:28:08] SPEAKER_01: And I think that is incredibly powerful.
[01:28:13] SPEAKER_01: And what ends up with the result, like Apple naming
[01:28:17] SPEAKER_01: whatever that feature is called, sleep, which is like,
[01:28:20] SPEAKER_01: it's too hard to understand what could that
[01:28:22] SPEAKER_01: can possibly mean.
[01:28:23] SPEAKER_01: And that's why people anticipate, despite the fact
[01:28:27] SPEAKER_01: that when they get to their website for the first time,
[01:28:31] SPEAKER_01: their intent is absolutely the minimum number
[01:28:36] SPEAKER_01: of micropoints above the threshold required
[01:28:39] SPEAKER_01: from their actually take that action.
[01:28:41] SPEAKER_01: You're like, all right, like, welcome to my website.
[01:28:44] SPEAKER_01: And there's a bunch of like BS.
[01:28:48] SPEAKER_01: And there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't make any sense.
[01:28:51] SPEAKER_01: And the buttons are inspeedable.
[01:28:52] SPEAKER_01: And it's unclear what to do next because I think
[01:28:54] SPEAKER_01: my thing is so important.
[01:28:56] SPEAKER_01: And I don't recognize that you are at work
[01:29:00] SPEAKER_01: and you were late this morning and you have to go to the bathroom.
[01:29:02] SPEAKER_01: And you're just like a regular human being
[01:29:05] SPEAKER_01: who has stuff going on.
[01:29:08] SPEAKER_01: You're concerned that your kids have fuck up
[01:29:10] SPEAKER_01: and they can't even trouble at school, it's like that.
[01:29:14] They're not like subjects who paid money to go to your play
[01:29:17] SPEAKER_01: and are sitting in the audience and waiting for that curtain
[01:29:20] SPEAKER_01: to go out.
[01:29:21] SPEAKER_01: They're like, people who are going to bounce
[01:29:22] SPEAKER_01: in a fraction of a second.
[01:29:24] SPEAKER_01: And so everyone should always be conscious
[01:29:26] SPEAKER_01: of the other solution.
[01:29:27] SPEAKER_01: I love that.
[01:29:28] SPEAKER_00: What's the solution?
[01:29:29] SPEAKER_00: Is it have other people like adding to be feedback?
[01:29:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[01:29:31] SPEAKER_00: And recognize it.
[01:29:33] SPEAKER_01: And unfortunately, it's one of those things, like Murphy's Law,
[01:29:35] SPEAKER_01: even if you go wrong when you take into a camera
[01:29:38] SPEAKER_01: of Murphy's Law.
[01:29:39] SPEAKER_01: It's fine.
[01:29:40] SPEAKER_01: But if you don't name it and recognize it and discuss it
[01:29:44] SPEAKER_01: and train yourself to think in that way,
[01:29:47] SPEAKER_01: that you have to take a breath, pretend you're a regular person,
[01:29:50] SPEAKER_01: and then look at this again and see if it makes sense.
[01:29:53] SPEAKER_01: Then you're screwed.
[01:29:54] SPEAKER_01: I love that.
[01:29:55] You're screwed.
[01:29:56] SPEAKER_00: I love that you threw this in here.
[01:29:57] SPEAKER_00: Billion other questions I'm going to ask you in part two
[01:29:59] SPEAKER_00: when we do this someday.
[01:30:01] SPEAKER_00: Stuart, thank you so much for doing this.
