# Podcast Summary: Stewart Butterfield on Product Craft, Taste, and Building Slack

## 1. Key Themes

### Focus on Comprehension Over Friction Reduction

The overwhelming focus in product development on "reducing friction" is often misguided. The real challenge for most products is **comprehension** - helping users understand what the product does and what to do next. Stewart explains: "It became an assumption that you should always be trying to remove friction when the challenge is really comprehension. If your software kind of stops me and asks me to make a decision, and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid" [[00:54:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=53m50s). He advocates for the mantra "don't make me think" over reducing clicks, arguing that making someone think burns glucose and creates negative emotional associations with your product. The key insight: users arriving at your product often have minimal intent and unclear understanding - your job is to create clarity, not just speed.

### Utility Curves: The Framework for Feature Investment

Stewart introduced the concept of utility curves as a lens for product prioritization. He describes an S-curve where initial effort produces little value, then there's a steep section where investment pays off dramatically, followed by diminishing returns [[00:07:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=7m0s). The critical question teams must ask: "Have we just not invested enough in this? Or have we got all the value or convenience or quality or whatever that we could get out of this?" [[00:08:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=8m30s). This prevents two common mistakes: (1) shipping features that don't reach the threshold where users find them valuable, and (2) over-investing in features past the point of meaningful returns. Stewart notes the curve constantly shifts as competitors improve and user expectations rise, requiring continuous reinvestment in seemingly "finished" features.

### The Long-Term Measure of Success is Customer Value Creation

At multiple company all-hands, Stewart made employees chant: "In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers" [[00:31:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=30m50s). This wasn't just rhetoric - it shaped critical decisions like their generous SLA (100x money back for downtime), fair billing practices, and product quality standards. Stewart emphasizes: "There's no substitute for actually having created it. You can put effort into demonstrating that you have created this value and stuff like that. But there's no substitute for actually having created it" [[00:43:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=42m50s). This customer-centric philosophy extended to employees too - his generosity with severance, health insurance, and equity structure wasn't just ethical, it was strategic: "There's advantages for you. Like you're able to attract a better class of employee."

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Most Work in Organizations is "Hyper-Realistic Work-Like Activities"

Stewart introduces a devastating concept: as organizations grow, the supply of "known valuable work to do" shrinks while the demand for doing work (from all the people hired) increases dramatically. The result is "hyper-realistic work-like activities" - actions that superficially look like work but create no value [[01:13:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=1h12m50s). He describes meetings to preview decks for bigger meetings, elaborate A/B tests on trivial features, and endless analysis that costs more than any possible benefit. "That hyper realistic work like activity is superficially identical to work. We are sitting in a conference room and there's something being projected up there and we're all talking about it and that's exactly what work is... but this is actually a fake minute work" [[01:16:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=1h15m50s). Most people, including board members, fall into this trap. The solution isn't chiding employees - it's leadership's responsibility to ensure sufficient supply of genuinely valuable work.

### Reducing Clicks/Taps is Usually the Wrong Goal

Counter to conventional product wisdom, Stewart argues that minimizing clicks is often counterproductive: "You could make any action in your app a single click or tap by just exposing every single possibility on one screen... And obviously that's terrible. So why do people think that a little bit of that is good?" [[00:48:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=48m30s). He advocates for exposing only the 2-3 most common actions, with everything else behind "other." "If it takes then eight clicks or taps to do something, but every single one is trivial easy, that's great. If you reduce that to two clicks or taps, but every part of it is this fraught decision... that's impossibly expensive" [[00:43:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=42m50s). The real goal is making each step obvious and effortless, not minimizing the number of steps.

### Pivoting Requires Cold Rationality, Not Perseverance

Against the cultural narrative of perseverance-at-all-costs, Stewart argues for "cold rationality" about when to pivot: "The reason I say you have to be coldly rational about it is because it's fucking humiliating" [[00:27:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=26m50s). The key question is whether you've exhausted all non-ridiculous ideas. When Glitch had $9 million left and a team that liked the product, Stewart still pivoted to Slack because he'd "exhausted every non-brediculous, long shot idea to make it commercially successful" [[01:14:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=1h14m37s). This contrasts with the common advice to just "hang in there" - Stewart acknowledges the pain of disappointing investors, users, and employees who relocated for jobs, but argues rational assessment of expected value must override emotional attachment.

## 3. Companies Identified

### Uber (Product Design Excellence)

**Why mentioned:** Stewart highlighted Uber's original app design as nearly perfect in its simplicity - opening to just "where would you like to go?" and "other" for everything else [[00:42:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=42m14s).

**Quote:** "That was perfect because almost all the time people just wanted to choose where they wanted to go. Sometimes you wanted to change where your pickup was because you weren't there yet or whatever. And that was just like, what could be simpler than, I'm gonna tell you where I wanna go or I'm gonna choose something else."

### Snapchat (Interaction Design)

**Why mentioned:** As an example of prioritizing effortless interaction over minimizing taps - a teenager used it by tapping 4-7 times per second for six minutes straight [[00:44:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=43m50s).

**Quote:** "She was tapping at least four times a second, sometimes like six or seven times a second... But there was a fluidity to it because everything was like at dead... And imagine if the goal was to try to make her cap less, you know, like how much of an impediment would have been to the experience that both her and Snapchat wanted to create?"

## 4. People Identified

### Patrick Collison (Stripe Co-founder)

**Why mentioned:** As an example of someone obsessed with product details - at a conference, instead of discussing strategy or partnerships, he complained to Google's CEO about Gmail's clunky recipient dragging UX [[00:40:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=39m50s).

**Quote:** "Patrick goes up to Sundar, and they can talk about anything, right? Like, yeah, Stripe wasn't the he myth it was now at that point, but it's still like a significant company was up and humming. And what does Patrick want to talk to Sundar about? It's in the Gmail at the dragging of people, like when you reply all to a message..."

### Jeff Bezos (Amazon Founder)

**Why mentioned:** Stewart adapted Bezos's famous "your margin is my opportunity" to "your failure to really be considerate and exercises courtesy and really be empathic about other people's experience is an advantage" [[00:19:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=18m50s).

**Quote:** "I would tell the story at Slack over and over again, and actually made it part of the new hire welcome... your failure to really be considerate and exercises courtesy and really be empathic about other people's experience is an advantage. You can create a critical advantage."

## 5. Operating Insights

### The "Shouting Rooster" Pattern for Behavior Shaping

When Slack users abused the @everyone feature (notifying entire channels), rather than removing it, they created a "shout-e-rooster" - a popup warning "this is gonna cause a notification for 147 people in eight different time zones. Are you sure you want to send this message?" [[00:24:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=24m20s). This preserved flexibility while shaping communication culture and educating users about the product's mechanics. The feature still exists today and dramatically reduced @everyone abuse while teaching users how notifications work.

### Elaborate Rollout Strategy for Contentious Features

For the Do Not Disturb feature, Slack faced competing concerns: operations teams with critical alerts, individual users wanting boundaries, and system administrators wanting control. Their solution: tell administrators weeks in advance, set organization defaults (7 PM to 7 AM), allow admin override of defaults, allow individual override of admin settings, and allow admins to override individual preferences again (creating a negotiation cycle, not war) [[00:50:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=49m50s). This prevented conflict and ensured adoption while respecting everyone's legitimate concerns.

### Product Marketing Work Can Be Rathole

Stewart shared an example where the team spent thousands of person-hours A/B testing whether pre-populating "@[previous poster]" in thread replies increased thread length from 2.14 to 2.17 messages [[01:00:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=59m50s). The lesson: "The difference that you could possibly achieve between having this feature and not having this feature is like this much... The cost of doing the analysis was this much. So it's guaranteed to be a loser." Leaders must recognize when analysis costs exceed any possible benefit from the feature change.

### Fair Billing as Competitive Advantage

Slack introduced "fair billing" - stopping charges for inactive users even when customers had contractually agreed to pay for those seats [[01:20:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=1h19m50s). During COVID, they gave free credits to struggling businesses. Their original SLA offered 100x money back for any downtime (though this backfired when an outage cost $8M in credits). Stewart's philosophy: acts of generosity demonstrate you'll cooperate in iterated games, creating trust and loyalty that competitors focused on extraction can't match.

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The "Owner's Delusion" Explains Most Product Failures

Stewart describes the "owner's delusion" - restaurant websites with slow-loading photos, music, and hidden contact information, created by owners who've certainly experienced frustration with other restaurant sites [[01:27:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=1h26m50s). The profound insight: "Everyone should always be conscious of the owner's delusion... you have to take a breath, pretend you're a regular person, and then look at this again and see if it makes sense." This applies universally - product creators forget that users aren't sitting in an audience waiting for the curtain to rise. They're distracted humans at work, running late, needing the bathroom, worried about their kids, ready to bounce in a fraction of a second. The solution isn't just user testing - it's training yourself to recognize this cognitive bias and actively counteract it.

### Parkinson's Law Drives Organizational Bloat Through Individual Rationality

Stewart connects Parkinson's Law ("work expands to fill the time available") to organizational structure: everyone hired wants to hire reports because span of control correlates with pay, authority, and career progression [[00:56:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLe-zy5r0Mk&t=55m50s). "It's not because they're evil and it's not because they're stupid. In fact they're smart because everyone knows that the number of people who report to you correlates with... your career trajectory, your amount of money that you're paid." The subtle insight: this happens even with junior hires - "We would hire 27-year-old product managers at Slack who immediately want to hire someone... well that person would do the product management and then I would do strategy." The implication is profound: unless actively managed, organizations naturally grow beyond optimal size through individually rational decisions that collectively destroy value.
