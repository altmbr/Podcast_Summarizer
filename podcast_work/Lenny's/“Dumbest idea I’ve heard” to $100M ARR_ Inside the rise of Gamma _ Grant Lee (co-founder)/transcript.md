[00:00:00] I'm in my third pitch in.
[00:00:01] Grant Lee: I get to the very end of the pitch feeling pretty good about myself.
[00:00:03] Grant Lee: The investor pauses a little bit and then just says,
[00:00:06] Grant Lee: that has to be the worst pitch.
[00:00:08] Grant Lee: Worst idea I have ever heard.
[00:00:10] Grant Lee: Not only are you trying to go against incumbents,
[00:00:13] Grant Lee: you're going against incumbents have massive distribution.
[00:00:16] Grant Lee: You are never going to succeed.
[00:00:17] Grant Lee: You guys are over 100 million AR now, worth over $2 billion.
[00:00:21] Lenny Rachitsky: One of the most interesting ways you guys grew early on was influencer marketing.
[00:00:25] Lenny Rachitsky: All the initial influencers I onboarded manually myself.
[00:00:28] Grant Lee: I always jump on a call with each one of them so that they understood what Gamma represented,
[00:00:33] Grant Lee: how to use the product.
[00:00:34] Grant Lee: You want to be able to have them tell your story, but in their voice.
[00:00:38] Grant Lee: I think a lot of people think influencer marketing and they'll think these big, trendy creators,
[00:00:42] Grant Lee: people that have a million followers.
[00:00:43] Grant Lee: This is the wrong approach.
[00:00:45] Grant Lee: You basically give them a script to read and immediately feels like an ad.
[00:00:48] Grant Lee: That product is not connected to them in any way.
[00:00:51] Grant Lee: You're much better doing the hard thing, which is hard to scale,
[00:00:53] Grant Lee: finding the thousands of micro influencers that have an audience where your product
[00:00:57] Grant Lee: maybe is actually useful.
[00:00:59] Grant Lee: People really trust what they say.
[00:01:01] Grant Lee: That ends up becoming this wildfire that can spread really, really fast.
[00:01:03] Grant Lee: Something you talk about, there is actually a lot of ways to think experimentally even in the early stages.
[00:01:08] Lenny Rachitsky: We would have an idea in the morning, come up with some sort of functional prototype.
[00:01:12] Grant Lee: We recruit a bunch of people that are legitimately good prospective users,
[00:01:16] Grant Lee: that have zero skin in the game.
[00:01:17] Grant Lee: Ship that so people can start playing.
[00:01:19] Grant Lee: In the afternoon, we're already running pretty full-scale experiment.
[00:01:22] Grant Lee: You start actually hearing other people describe their usage of the product.
[00:01:25] Grant Lee: We can also watch them struggle by the evening or by the next day.
[00:01:28] Grant Lee: We can actually go through all of it together and say,
[00:01:30] Grant Lee: okay, we're going back and we have to fix this.
[00:01:31] Grant Lee: This is like not usable.
[00:01:33] Grant Lee: And we've done that for everything.
[00:01:35] Today, my guest is Grant Lee, C-owned co-founder of Gamma.
[00:01:39] Lenny Rachitsky: This is a really unique and inspiring and very tactically useful conversation
[00:01:44] Lenny Rachitsky: because Grant is building something that is essentially the dream for most founders.
[00:01:48] Lenny Rachitsky: A massive AI startup that's profitable and has been for a long time
[00:01:52] Lenny Rachitsky: that didn't raise a lot of money for a long time.
[00:01:55] Lenny Rachitsky: And as a small team, it's just around 30 people,
[00:01:58] Lenny Rachitsky: all who can fit in a small restaurant,
[00:02:00] Lenny Rachitsky: serving over 50 million users globally.
[00:02:02] Lenny Rachitsky: If you're not familiar with Gamma,
[00:02:03] Lenny Rachitsky: they're an AI-powered presentation and website design tool.
[00:02:06] Lenny Rachitsky: They just hit 100 million ARR in just over two years.
[00:02:11] Lenny Rachitsky: They're valued at over $2 billion.
[00:02:14] Lenny Rachitsky: And unlike a lot of the fast growing AI startups that you hear about,
[00:02:17] Lenny Rachitsky: they're growing profitably and sustainably.
[00:02:20] Lenny Rachitsky: And in a category that most people did not believe had a huge business opportunity.
[00:02:24] Lenny Rachitsky: As you'll hear in the conversation,
[00:02:25] Lenny Rachitsky: one investor told Grant,
[00:02:26] Lenny Rachitsky: this is the dumbest idea that he has ever heard.
[00:02:29] Lenny Rachitsky: In this conversation, Grant shares the very counterintuitive lessons
[00:02:32] Lenny Rachitsky: that he's learned finding product market fit,
[00:02:35] Lenny Rachitsky: how he knew that product market fit,
[00:02:37] Lenny Rachitsky: the specific tactics that helped them grow,
[00:02:39] Lenny Rachitsky: including a deep dive into influencer marketing, which blew my mind.
[00:02:42] Lenny Rachitsky: Also, how they figured out their price,
[00:02:44] Lenny Rachitsky: his thoughts on building a GPT wrapper company that is durable,
[00:02:48] Lenny Rachitsky: a ton of hiring advice, and so much more.
[00:02:50] Lenny Rachitsky: This could honestly have been another two hours of conversation.
[00:02:53] Lenny Rachitsky: I suspect we'll do another follow-up conversation next year.

[00:03:33] Lenny Rachitsky: and agency and product market fit.
[00:03:35] Lenny Rachitsky: You know what we don't love talking about?
[00:03:37] Lenny Rachitsky: Sock too.
[00:03:38] Lenny Rachitsky: That's where Vanta comes in.
[00:03:40] Lenny Rachitsky: Vanta helps companies of all sizes get compliant fast

[00:04:08] Lenny Rachitsky: Vanta customers slashed over $500,000 a year
[00:04:12] Lenny Rachitsky: and are three times more productive.

[00:04:24] Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me

[00:04:28] Lenny Rachitsky: I want everyone on that team to be super happy
[00:04:30] Lenny Rachitsky: and thrive in the roles.
[00:04:32] Lenny Rachitsky: Just work snows that your employees are more than just
[00:04:34] Lenny Rachitsky: your employees.
[00:04:35] Lenny Rachitsky: They're your people.
[00:04:36] Lenny Rachitsky: My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia, Nepal,
[00:04:39] Lenny Rachitsky: West Africa, and San Francisco.
[00:04:42] Lenny Rachitsky: My life would be so incredibly complicated
[00:04:44] Lenny Rachitsky: to hire people internationally to pay people on time
[00:04:47] Lenny Rachitsky: and in their local currencies and to answer their HR
[00:04:49] Lenny Rachitsky: questions 24-7.
[00:04:51] Lenny Rachitsky: But with just works, it's super easy.
[00:04:53] Lenny Rachitsky: Whether you're setting up your own automated payroll,
[00:04:56] Lenny Rachitsky: offering premium benefits, or hiring internationally,
[00:04:58] Lenny Rachitsky: just works offered simple software and 24-7 human support
[00:05:02] Lenny Rachitsky: from small business experts for you and your people.
[00:05:05] Lenny Rachitsky: They do your human resources right
[00:05:07] Lenny Rachitsky: so that you can do right by your people.
[00:05:09] Lenny Rachitsky: Just works for your people.
[00:05:12] So,
[00:05:13] thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
[00:05:19] Lenny Rachitsky: Lani, so great to be here.
[00:05:20] Grant Lee: Thank you for having me.
[00:05:21] Grant Lee: I see your face all the time in my LinkedIn feed.
[00:05:24] Lenny Rachitsky: I don't know if you know this thing
[00:05:25] Lenny Rachitsky: on these JP Morgan Chase heads.
[00:05:27] Lenny Rachitsky: I'm so curious if other people see this.
[00:05:29] Lenny Rachitsky: There's just me.
[00:05:30] Lenny Rachitsky: Did you know this was a thing?
[00:05:31] Lenny Rachitsky: I think it's maybe once a day.
[00:05:32] Grant Lee: Now I get a text message and just no message.
[00:05:35] Grant Lee: It's just a screenshot or an image of me,
[00:05:38] Grant Lee: doing something in San Francisco
[00:05:40] Grant Lee: on one of these ads ever saying.
[00:05:43] Grant Lee: And so yeah, kind of embarrassing,
[00:05:44] Grant Lee: but also, you know, we're happy customers
[00:05:46] Grant Lee: of JP Morgan Chase, so trying to represent.
[00:05:49] Lenny Rachitsky: Oh my God.
[00:05:49] Lenny Rachitsky: I hope you love them because it's like,
[00:05:51] Lenny Rachitsky: it's always you.
[00:05:52] Lenny Rachitsky: There's no one else that's like, grants.
[00:05:54] Lenny Rachitsky: And if I tagged you, you gotta stop somebody out.
[00:05:56] Grant Lee: I mean, that would be great.
[00:05:57] Grant Lee: I'm totally fine with that.
[00:05:59] Okay, so to get serious,
[00:06:00] Lenny Rachitsky: the reason I'm really excited to have you here
[00:06:02] Lenny Rachitsky: is unlike a lot of super fast growing AI startups,
[00:06:07] Lenny Rachitsky: you are both growing like crazy.
[00:06:09] Lenny Rachitsky: You are growing very profitably.
[00:06:11] Lenny Rachitsky: We're gonna talk about this.
[00:06:13] Lenny Rachitsky: You did not raise a ton of money when you started.
[00:06:15] Lenny Rachitsky: You waited a long time to raise a bunch of money.
[00:06:17] Lenny Rachitsky: You also built a business and a category
[00:06:19] Lenny Rachitsky: that I think most people never imagined
[00:06:22] Lenny Rachitsky: there was this big of an opportunity.
[00:06:24] Lenny Rachitsky: And you're basically, you've achieved the dream
[00:06:26] Lenny Rachitsky: of a lot of founders these days,
[00:06:28] Lenny Rachitsky: especially people building AI startups.
[00:06:31] Lenny Rachitsky: So my goal with this conversation is essentially
[00:06:33] Lenny Rachitsky: do an anthropological study of a really successful AI startup.
[00:06:38] Lenny Rachitsky: AI startup, talk about how you found product market fit,
[00:06:41] Lenny Rachitsky: how you grew, all the lessons you've learned
[00:06:43] Lenny Rachitsky: along the journey.
[00:06:45] Lenny Rachitsky: And I'm gonna break this conversation up
[00:06:46] Lenny Rachitsky: kind of along the different milestones of the journey
[00:06:49] Lenny Rachitsky: before we get into the first piece.
[00:06:51] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there anything that you think is important
[00:06:53] Lenny Rachitsky: for people to hear kind of broadly about the story of Gamma?
[00:06:56] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, maybe I'll just start with the quick story
[00:06:59] Grant Lee: if that's okay.
[00:07:00] Grant Lee: And it's really just a founding story.
[00:07:02] Grant Lee: So, you know, we started the company back in 2020.
[00:07:05] Grant Lee: This is peak pandemic.
[00:07:07] Grant Lee: And, you know, fundraising, even fundraising was just so different.
[00:07:10] Grant Lee: So all of the fundraising was done over Zoom.
[00:07:13] Grant Lee: You were kind of, you know,
[00:07:14] Grant Lee: sitting in these Zoom meetings trying to pitch
[00:07:16] Grant Lee: many investors you never met in person.
[00:07:18] Grant Lee: So just a different error, right?
[00:07:19] Grant Lee: And so for us, you know, our first time founders,
[00:07:21] Grant Lee: I was actually living in London at the time.
[00:07:23] Grant Lee: And so, you know, a different time zone.
[00:07:25] Grant Lee: I had to do all of my pitches at night.
[00:07:28] Grant Lee: And, you know, I have two little kids.
[00:07:29] Grant Lee: So wait for them to go to bed, 8 p.m.
[00:07:32] Grant Lee: We had a pretty modest flat.
[00:07:33] Grant Lee: So nothing big.
[00:07:35] I would basically find this little corner
[00:07:38] Grant Lee: between the kitchenette and the laundry room.
[00:07:40] Grant Lee: They're kind of set up shot far enough from the kids
[00:07:42] Grant Lee: so they wouldn't, you know, be woken up.
[00:07:45] In between 8 p.m. like 2 a.m. I'm just pitching.
[00:07:47] Grant Lee: You know, trying my best, I'd like the fake Zoom background
[00:07:49] Grant Lee: so people didn't know where I was and just pitching.
[00:07:52] Grant Lee: And so, you know, really the first day, kind of,
[00:07:54] Grant Lee: I'm in my third pitch in trying to tell the story of Gamma.
[00:07:58] Grant Lee: Obviously, just starting to get the hang of the pitch.
[00:08:00] Grant Lee: And, you know, I get to the very end of the pitch
[00:08:02] Grant Lee: feeling pretty good about myself.
[00:08:04] Grant Lee: And the investor pauses a little bit
[00:08:07] and then just says,
[00:08:08] Grant Lee: that has to be the worst pitch, worst idea I have ever heard.
[00:08:13] Grant Lee: Not only are you trying to go against incumbents,
[00:08:17] Grant Lee: you're going against incumbents have massive distribution.
[00:08:20] You are never going to succeed.
[00:08:22] And so like in my head, I'm already kind of shell shocked
[00:08:25] Grant Lee: in thinking, you know, what am I going to,
[00:08:27] Grant Lee: what's my rebuttal?
[00:08:28] And before I could even respond, he hangs up.
[00:08:32] And so I'm there sitting, you know,
[00:08:34] Grant Lee: they're thinking about it.
[00:08:35] Grant Lee: And, you know, before I could really get down on myself
[00:08:37] Grant Lee: because I had to prepare for the next pitch,
[00:08:39] Grant Lee: I kind of just internalize this feeling that, you know,
[00:08:42] maybe he's right, you know, maybe something
[00:08:44] Grant Lee: about what he's saying is actually correct.
[00:08:46] Grant Lee: And so for me, I started thinking about,
[00:08:49] if we're going to succeed in this category,
[00:08:51] Grant Lee: we're going to really have to think about growth
[00:08:53] Grant Lee: from the very beginning.
[00:08:54] Grant Lee: This category is going to be really, really hard to break into.
[00:08:57] Grant Lee: And so we really kind of made this sort of,
[00:09:00] Grant Lee: kind of promise to ourselves that as we continue
[00:09:02] Grant Lee: to build growth is going to be critically important.
[00:09:05] And so my thing to kind of, you know, your audience is that,
[00:09:08] Grant Lee: you know, I don't come from a growth background.
[00:09:10] Grant Lee: So if I can learn growth, anybody can learn growth.
[00:09:13] Grant Lee: And I think especially in this sort of market,
[00:09:15] Grant Lee: hypercompetitive, oftentimes very crowded,
[00:09:17] Grant Lee: it's going to be essential.
[00:09:19] That is such a fun story.
[00:09:21] Lenny Rachitsky: Oh my God.
[00:09:22] Lenny Rachitsky: How bad does the most does investor feel at this point?
[00:09:25] Lenny Rachitsky: We're going to have names.
[00:09:26] Lenny Rachitsky: Just to share some stats, I know this is going to be,
[00:09:28] Lenny Rachitsky: by the time this launches, this will be out.
[00:09:31] Lenny Rachitsky: But you guys are over 100 million ARR now,
[00:09:34] Lenny Rachitsky: worth over $2 billion, a business that, again,
[00:09:37] Lenny Rachitsky: most people did not think was going to work in this category.
[00:09:41] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, thank you.
[00:09:42] Grant Lee: Yeah, we feel super proud to have accomplished that.
[00:09:44] Grant Lee: And again, yeah, I'm excited to share some of the, you know,
[00:09:47] Grant Lee: the growth tactics and things that worked for us.
[00:09:49] Grant Lee: Because I think, you know, hopefully it will help others
[00:09:51] Grant Lee: kind of on their journey as well.
[00:09:52] Grant Lee: Okay, so let's dive into it.
[00:09:54] Lenny Rachitsky: Let's talk about product market fit.
[00:09:57] Tell us the story of just how you found product market fit
[00:09:59] Lenny Rachitsky: and how you knew you found product market fit.
[00:10:02] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, I'll start by telling kind of the moment
[00:10:04] Grant Lee: where we thought we maybe had product market fit.
[00:10:06] Grant Lee: And I think a lot of founders, you know,
[00:10:08] Grant Lee: asked themselves, do we have it or are we not?
[00:10:10] Grant Lee: And I think there's often this sort of temptation
[00:10:12] Grant Lee: to go almost full yourself into thinking you have it.
[00:10:14] Grant Lee: And so we sort of did our first public beta launch.
[00:10:18] Grant Lee: This is back in August of 2022.
[00:10:20] Grant Lee: We launched on product time and, you know,
[00:10:23] Grant Lee: felt really good.
[00:10:24] Grant Lee: You know, what we felt like was a great launch
[00:10:26] Grant Lee: ended up winning product of the day,
[00:10:27] Grant Lee: product of the week, product of the month.
[00:10:29] Grant Lee: And I was like, wow, we, you know,
[00:10:30] Grant Lee: I think we have something here.
[00:10:32] Grant Lee: And then we'd look at signups and you'd get that initial spike
[00:10:35] Grant Lee: and signups and then they sort of like flatten out.
[00:10:38] Grant Lee: You were still getting new users every day,
[00:10:40] but it was clear we didn't have strong word of mouth.
[00:10:42] Grant Lee: There wasn't strong organic virology.
[00:10:45] Grant Lee: And so if we just kind of played things out,
[00:10:47] you know, we knew that the product
[00:10:48] Grant Lee: wasn't going to grow on its own.
[00:10:50] Grant Lee: Like something was missing there.
[00:10:51] Grant Lee: We didn't have that strong word of mouth
[00:10:53] Grant Lee: so that the product could just continue growing.
[00:10:55] Grant Lee: And so we really kind of asked ourselves,
[00:10:57] Grant Lee: like, okay, what do we need to change?
[00:10:59] Grant Lee: And the answer is like, we need to fundamentally change everything.
[00:11:02] Grant Lee: It for us almost became the sort of bet the company sort of moment
[00:11:05] Grant Lee: because at that point we were running low on runway.
[00:11:08] Grant Lee: You know, we knew we needed to make progress
[00:11:10] Grant Lee: and we didn't really know, you know, what could be done.
[00:11:13] Grant Lee: And so we got everyone together at this point.
[00:11:16] Grant Lee: The team was just over 12 people and we said,
[00:11:19] okay, we're it's going to be all hands on deck.
[00:11:22] We are going to do everything we possibly can
[00:11:24] Grant Lee: to make the first 30 seconds of the product feel magical.
[00:11:28] Grant Lee: The moment you land into the product, it has to be great.
[00:11:31] Grant Lee: And it has to be so great that someone
[00:11:33] Grant Lee: that goes through that onboarding
[00:11:35] Grant Lee: is going to tell all their friends.
[00:11:37] And if we can get that right,
[00:11:38] Grant Lee: then maybe we have a chance of actually, you know,
[00:11:40] Grant Lee: doing something in this space.
[00:11:41] Grant Lee: And so we spent three, four months actually, you know,
[00:11:43] Grant Lee: after the product launch, we like felt great,
[00:11:45] Grant Lee: but we knew we had to go back to the drawing board.
[00:11:47] Grant Lee: We spent the next like three, four months actually
[00:11:50] Grant Lee: revamping the entire onboarding experience.
[00:11:52] Grant Lee: And of course, this is also where, you know,
[00:11:54] Grant Lee: AI for us kind of played a big role.
[00:11:56] Grant Lee: We actually rebuilt it so that AI was part of the
[00:11:59] Grant Lee: back to the onboarding.
[00:12:00] Grant Lee: So every single new user would experience the sort of magic
[00:12:03] Grant Lee: in the first 30 seconds.
[00:12:04] Grant Lee: And so we re-launched, this is end of March 2023.
[00:12:09] In all of a sudden, you know, we'd go from a few hundred
[00:12:12] Grant Lee: signups a day to now, first day, it was like a couple thousand.
[00:12:15] And then the next day would be like 5,000 signups.
[00:12:17] Grant Lee: And then 10,000 signups a day.
[00:12:19] Grant Lee: And then 20,000 signups a day.
[00:12:20] Grant Lee: And then it just kept going up.
[00:12:22] Grant Lee: And we weren't doing any sort of marketing, no advertising.
[00:12:24] Grant Lee: It was all sort of organic word of mouth,
[00:12:27] Grant Lee: virality of the product, people using the product
[00:12:29] Grant Lee: and sharing with others, where we for the first time
[00:12:32] Grant Lee: really felt this pull.
[00:12:33] Grant Lee: Like we didn't have to do anything.
[00:12:34] Grant Lee: Product was just growing.
[00:12:36] And it was just such a distinct difference between that
[00:12:39] Grant Lee: feeling and like coming out of the product launch
[00:12:41] Grant Lee: where we could have fooled ourselves in the thinking
[00:12:43] Grant Lee: we had a product market fit.
[00:12:44] Grant Lee: I think the temptation would have been,
[00:12:45] Grant Lee: hey, let's just spend more on ads or spend more on marketing.
[00:12:48] Grant Lee: Because like, you know, we'll just fuel, you know,
[00:12:50] Grant Lee: fuel the top of the funnel and everything else
[00:12:52] Grant Lee: will work at self-out.
[00:12:53] Grant Lee: I think that would have been a trap.
[00:12:54] Grant Lee: I think that would have let us down to like this path
[00:12:56] Grant Lee: of trying to brute force our way into product market fit.
[00:13:00] Grant Lee: And it would just always be sort of a fleeting sort
[00:13:02] Grant Lee: of destination, never actually arrive.
[00:13:04] Grant Lee: And so I think we made the tough call, the right call.
[00:13:06] Grant Lee: It was a sort of about the company moment.
[00:13:08] Grant Lee: And I think on the other side, it just felt so different.
[00:13:11] Grant Lee: Grant, this is exactly what I want
[00:13:13] Lenny Rachitsky: on this conversation to be.
[00:13:14] Lenny Rachitsky: I'm so excited.
[00:13:15] Lenny Rachitsky: I have so many questions I have to follow up
[00:13:17] Lenny Rachitsky: on the stuff you shared before we even get to the rest
[00:13:18] Lenny Rachitsky: of the journey.
[00:13:19] Lenny Rachitsky: So one is essentially what you're describing
[00:13:22] Lenny Rachitsky: as product market fit to you was when organic growth started
[00:13:26] Lenny Rachitsky: to really take off.
[00:13:27] Lenny Rachitsky: And it was just growing through word of mouth.
[00:13:29] Lenny Rachitsky: You weren't doing much because it was so awesome.
[00:13:31] Lenny Rachitsky: People are telling my friends about it.
[00:13:32] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there anything more there that might be helpful for people
[00:13:34] Lenny Rachitsky: to share just to hear about just like,
[00:13:36] Lenny Rachitsky: okay, here's what it actually looks like.
[00:13:38] Yeah, I mean, I'm one piece of advice
[00:13:40] Grant Lee: is that when you're early on, your mindset should almost be
[00:13:43] Grant Lee: like you're trying to create a word of mouth machine, right?
[00:13:46] Grant Lee: Like if you can get that part right,
[00:13:47] Grant Lee: everything else becomes significantly easier.
[00:13:51] Grant Lee: And if you have any,
[00:13:52] Grant Lee: and I think this applies to both like prosumer,
[00:13:55] Grant Lee: B2C, as well as even B2B products.
[00:13:57] Grant Lee: Like if you have a B2B product,
[00:13:59] Grant Lee: even if you're not telling all of your friends,
[00:14:01] Grant Lee: you should be telling colleagues
[00:14:03] Grant Lee: where like that product is relevant.
[00:14:05] You should probably be telling, you know,
[00:14:07] Grant Lee: former co-workers where, hey, you've discovered something
[00:14:09] Grant Lee: like, oh, I wish we had this in our prior lives.
[00:14:13] Grant Lee: And like that should even be magical.
[00:14:14] Grant Lee: And then you should see that in all the leads
[00:14:16] Grant Lee: that are coming through,
[00:14:16] Grant Lee: people coming through through your prospects
[00:14:19] Grant Lee: and your existing customers.
[00:14:20] Grant Lee: If you're not seeing a healthy chunk of those leads
[00:14:22] Grant Lee: come through that way, I would go back.
[00:14:24] Grant Lee: I'm like, why?
[00:14:24] Grant Lee: Why is that not happening?
[00:14:26] Grant Lee: And because again, that's like the massive tailwind you need
[00:14:28] Grant Lee: where every single thing you do on top of that,
[00:14:31] Grant Lee: all the marketing, all the sales, all the advertising,
[00:14:34] Grant Lee: you're just gonna have, like it becomes way, way easier.
[00:14:36] Grant Lee: How much of this was, you just grab it as a word
[00:14:38] Lenny Rachitsky: of mouth machine.
[00:14:39] Lenny Rachitsky: How much of this was like word amount loops
[00:14:41] Lenny Rachitsky: and virality features versus just the product itself.
[00:14:45] Lenny Rachitsky: One was awesome and two is kind of neatly shareable
[00:14:48] Lenny Rachitsky: because it's presentations people share with each other.
[00:14:50] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, totally.
[00:14:51] Grant Lee: I think for us, we do benefit from being in a category
[00:14:53] Grant Lee: where by nature of it, if you like gamma,
[00:14:55] Grant Lee: you're sharing it, presenting it to the others.
[00:14:57] Grant Lee: So I think for us, it's a combination of both.
[00:15:00] Grant Lee: And ideally, you have other ways
[00:15:02] Grant Lee: where word of mouth or organic virality
[00:15:05] Grant Lee: can happen in your product.
[00:15:06] Grant Lee: So by nature of usage, like it's being shared,
[00:15:09] Grant Lee: we basically had an internal mantra that we go back
[00:15:11] Grant Lee: to the first 30 seconds.
[00:15:13] Grant Lee: We wanted to be dead simple for someone to create content.
[00:15:15] Grant Lee: We want to be dead simple for them to share it.
[00:15:18] Grant Lee: And everything we did, kind of for that first 30 seconds
[00:15:21] Grant Lee: or call the first few minutes is remove friction
[00:15:23] Grant Lee: so that they can do both of those things create and share.
[00:15:26] Grant Lee: And I think other people, when you look at your own product,
[00:15:29] Grant Lee: you think about, okay, what is it about my product
[00:15:32] Grant Lee: and how it gets used?
[00:15:33] Grant Lee: Can you remove friction such that it can actually spread?
[00:15:36] Grant Lee: And even if it's locally within an organization
[00:15:38] Grant Lee: or within a workspace, just be able to enable that
[00:15:41] Grant Lee: as much as you possibly can.
[00:15:43] The other really profound point you're making here
[00:15:45] Lenny Rachitsky: is the story of you want product of the day on product and
[00:15:48] Lenny Rachitsky: which alone is so hard.
[00:15:50] Lenny Rachitsky: So many people try to win and don't.
[00:15:52] Lenny Rachitsky: Most of those people don't, like I've tried
[00:15:55] Lenny Rachitsky: to help companies win.
[00:15:56] Lenny Rachitsky: And it's like a really hard thing to achieve.
[00:15:58] Lenny Rachitsky: And then you want product of the week
[00:16:00] Lenny Rachitsky: and product of the month.
[00:16:02] Lenny Rachitsky: And still you're like, no, this isn't working.
[00:16:04] Lenny Rachitsky: Most people that achieve that are like, no, we got this
[00:16:08] Lenny Rachitsky: and they would not have to bet the company.
[00:16:10] Lenny Rachitsky: There was no feeling, there wouldn't be a feeling
[00:16:12] Lenny Rachitsky: we have to rethink everything.
[00:16:14] Lenny Rachitsky: What is it, just, what is it there that you just like,
[00:16:16] Lenny Rachitsky: no, we need, this isn't going to work as much
[00:16:17] Lenny Rachitsky: as exciting as this is, this isn't it?
[00:16:20] Grant Lee: Yeah, I mean, part of being a founder is being,
[00:16:22] Grant Lee: as self-aware as you can and be your own worst critic, right?
[00:16:26] Grant Lee: And so oftentimes you want to have these vanity metrics
[00:16:29] Grant Lee: that feel good to celebrate and you should celebrate,
[00:16:32] Grant Lee: but you should know when it's a vanity metric
[00:16:33] Grant Lee: versus is this core to our growth engine?
[00:16:36] Grant Lee: Like if this number goes up, does it mean
[00:16:38] Grant Lee: the product is working?
[00:16:39] Grant Lee: And I think that's where we looked at it like, okay,
[00:16:41] Grant Lee: if I'll go to Windows things, we've kind of put ourselves
[00:16:44] Grant Lee: at least on the map, but it wasn't good enough
[00:16:47] Grant Lee: to actually have this sort of feeling
[00:16:49] Grant Lee: that we had a core growth engine,
[00:16:50] Grant Lee: we could just invest in and get better and better.
[00:16:52] Grant Lee: That wasn't there yet.
[00:16:53] Grant Lee: So essentially it kind of started to just plateau
[00:16:55] Lenny Rachitsky: and slow, it wasn't like this rocket ship
[00:16:58] Lenny Rachitsky: that took off from that.
[00:16:59] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, it was still like, we were still getting signups,
[00:17:00] Grant Lee: like they're coming through, but you could just tell
[00:17:02] Grant Lee: there wasn't like, there wasn't this like building momentum,
[00:17:05] Grant Lee: you know, and I think that's, that's where it's always
[00:17:07] Grant Lee: hard to tell, you kind of have to, you know,
[00:17:10] Grant Lee: me and my co-founder, we sat down,
[00:17:11] Grant Lee: we're just, we're trying to be honest with ourselves,
[00:17:13] Grant Lee: like, okay, is this gonna be enough?
[00:17:15] Grant Lee: And it just really felt like it wasn't going to be good.
[00:17:17] Grant Lee: The other point here is the power of onboarding,
[00:17:20] Lenny Rachitsky: which comes up a bunch on this podcast
[00:17:22] Lenny Rachitsky: when you talk about driving retention.
[00:17:25] Lenny Rachitsky: So you launch product and then start it kind of petering out.
[00:17:29] Lenny Rachitsky: How much did the product change after
[00:17:31] Lenny Rachitsky: if things started to work versus onboarding?
[00:17:34] Lenny Rachitsky: Just like how important was onboarding?
[00:17:37] Lenny Rachitsky: And then just tell us why the first 30 seconds
[00:17:39] Lenny Rachitsky: where did you come up with that number?
[00:17:41] Yeah, so for us, you know, the onboarding
[00:17:43] Grant Lee: and the product experience for us, that's intertwined, right?
[00:17:46] Grant Lee: The analogy I always think about is, you know,
[00:17:49] Grant Lee: if you go into, you know, a restaurant and, you know,
[00:17:51] Grant Lee: maybe the food is good, but when you really think
[00:17:53] Grant Lee: about the user experience, it's like the moment
[00:17:55] Grant Lee: you walk into the door, you get seated,
[00:17:57] Grant Lee: the waitress waiter comes by, creates you, you get order.
[00:18:01] Grant Lee: And of course, the food has to taste good.
[00:18:03] Grant Lee: But if that entire, like, and then you finally get the bill
[00:18:05] Grant Lee: and you leave, like is that entire experience
[00:18:07] Grant Lee: something that feels delightful?
[00:18:08] Grant Lee: Is it good enough for you to tell your friends about it?
[00:18:10] Grant Lee: If someone just came by and dropped the food on your plate,
[00:18:12] Grant Lee: you know, on the table and was like, just left
[00:18:14] Grant Lee: and never came with the bill,
[00:18:15] Grant Lee: I'm like, okay, man, I'm not going to recommend this
[00:18:17] Grant Lee: to somebody else.
[00:18:18] Grant Lee: And so for us, like we thought about, okay,
[00:18:20] Grant Lee: the first moment someone walks through our door,
[00:18:22] Grant Lee: where, you know, dropping into the product,
[00:18:24] what is, what is something we can give them?
[00:18:25] Grant Lee: Can we shorten that time to value as much as possible?
[00:18:28] Grant Lee: A lot of this is inspired by, you know, like Scott Belsky,
[00:18:31] Grant Lee: he talks about kind of that first mile,
[00:18:33] Grant Lee: the first 15 minutes.
[00:18:34] Grant Lee: And I think that's totally right.
[00:18:36] Grant Lee: And I think one approach is you think about new users
[00:18:39] Grant Lee: as you almost have like a cynical view of them.
[00:18:41] Grant Lee: You have to think about them being selfish, vain, and lazy.
[00:18:44] Grant Lee: Right? Like they're coming in.
[00:18:46] They have no desire to learn a new tool.
[00:18:48] And so what can you give them in that first 30 seconds
[00:18:50] Grant Lee: that earns you the next 30 seconds
[00:18:52] Grant Lee: and then the next 30 seconds.
[00:18:53] Grant Lee: And so for us, we knew that if we can't, you know,
[00:18:55] Grant Lee: people's attention span is even shorter today
[00:18:58] Grant Lee: than maybe 10 years ago.
[00:18:59] Grant Lee: And so what is it in that first 30 seconds?
[00:19:01] Grant Lee: We actually show you something and earn the right
[00:19:05] Grant Lee: to kind of keep kind of building that relationship with you.
[00:19:07] Grant Lee: We really thought a lot about that.
[00:19:09] Grant Lee: And certainly that's, that's, that's all we could really
[00:19:11] Grant Lee: afford at that time.
[00:19:12] Grant Lee: We only had 12 people building.
[00:19:13] Grant Lee: And so like we couldn't make entirely, you know,
[00:19:16] Grant Lee: revamped entire product.
[00:19:17] Grant Lee: We knew that we had to at least put all of our energy
[00:19:20] Grant Lee: into one spot.
[00:19:21] Grant Lee: And so we made that coming into the door,
[00:19:23] Grant Lee: come through the door, make that feel,
[00:19:24] Grant Lee: not more than feel magical so that we can do
[00:19:26] Grant Lee: a little bit more over time.
[00:19:27] Grant Lee: I love your point about how, you know,
[00:19:28] Lenny Rachitsky: you could think of it as like, okay,
[00:19:30] Lenny Rachitsky: it's onboarding versus the product.
[00:19:31] Lenny Rachitsky: The lens of how do we make this incredibly valuable
[00:19:34] Lenny Rachitsky: and a hawish for the first 30 seconds,
[00:19:37] Lenny Rachitsky: almost informs what the product should be?
[00:19:39] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, it really helps you, you know,
[00:19:41] Grant Lee: pull forward what is the most magical thing
[00:19:44] Grant Lee: about your product, right?
[00:19:45] Grant Lee: Sometimes founders will think about like the five,
[00:19:47] Grant Lee: 10 features.
[00:19:48] Grant Lee: Well, maybe there's only like one thing
[00:19:50] Grant Lee: that kind of differentiates you.
[00:19:51] Grant Lee: You know, I try to learn a lot from, you know,
[00:19:53] Grant Lee: well, we'll get into some of the marketing pieces of this.
[00:19:56] Grant Lee: But even just having this sort of founder led marketing lens
[00:19:59] Grant Lee: of like, what can I do to help a new user just understand?
[00:20:03] Grant Lee: There's this thing from like consumer advertising,
[00:20:05] Grant Lee: which is you through a consumer one egg,
[00:20:08] they can probably catch it.
[00:20:09] Grant Lee: You throw them four or five eggs,
[00:20:11] Grant Lee: they're probably gonna drop all of them.
[00:20:12] Grant Lee: And like oftentimes founders want to talk about
[00:20:14] Grant Lee: the four or five features they have, maybe 10 features.
[00:20:17] Grant Lee: And then the consumer is totally confused.
[00:20:18] Grant Lee: Like, why do I need this thing?
[00:20:20] Grant Lee: We try to just give them that one egg,
[00:20:22] Grant Lee: that one, you know, like first experience,
[00:20:24] Grant Lee: we're like, okay, you know, create a slide in seconds.
[00:20:27] Grant Lee: That's the egg.
[00:20:28] Grant Lee: I'm gonna throw you this egg.
[00:20:29] Grant Lee: Is that compelling to you?
[00:20:30] Grant Lee: Some people are still gonna opt out,
[00:20:32] Grant Lee: but for the people that catch that,
[00:20:33] Grant Lee: you're solving like a real problem for them.
[00:20:35] Grant Lee: And then you can continue kind of building on that over time.
[00:20:38] Grant Lee: Like you've given them enough so that they'll sit around
[00:20:40] Grant Lee: and like keep playing with your product.
[00:20:41] Grant Lee: That is a hilarious metaphor I've never heard for onboarding
[00:20:45] Lenny Rachitsky: time to value.
[00:20:46] Lenny Rachitsky: Just focus on one egg at a time.
[00:20:48] Lenny Rachitsky: Just going even further back.
[00:20:49] Lenny Rachitsky: What was the original insight that you had
[00:20:52] Lenny Rachitsky: that led to gamma and what YAMAs today?
[00:20:54] Lenny Rachitsky: After the last startup I was at was acquired.
[00:20:57] Grant Lee: I went back into kind of my roots, which is consulting.
[00:20:59] Grant Lee: I was advising early stage startups.
[00:21:02] Grant Lee: And the sort of medium I was using was Google slides.
[00:21:05] Grant Lee: So I just remember this late night trying to prepare
[00:21:08] Grant Lee: for next day's meeting, trying to format and figure out
[00:21:11] Grant Lee: the right layout and spending hours just trying to get
[00:21:14] Grant Lee: the sort of look and feel right rather than the content
[00:21:16] Grant Lee: itself.
[00:21:17] Grant Lee: And for me that just felt completely backwards.
[00:21:19] Grant Lee: You know, I should be spending 90% all the time
[00:21:21] Grant Lee: on the content, 10% maybe on the design formatting.
[00:21:24] Grant Lee: And so the question just was, you know,
[00:21:26] Grant Lee: what if there's a better way?
[00:21:28] Grant Lee: What if we could reimagine this format from the ground up?
[00:21:30] Grant Lee: Slides have been around for almost 40 years as the default,
[00:21:33] Grant Lee: you know, medium of choice for a lot of this.
[00:21:35] Grant Lee: And so we thought about, OK, if we had different building blocks,
[00:21:38] Grant Lee: different primitives, so you're not locked into the fixed 16 by 9,
[00:21:42] Grant Lee: you know, slide, what could you, you know,
[00:21:43] Grant Lee: what could we offer to new users?
[00:21:45] Grant Lee: And so that was really the start of one of all this.
[00:21:48] Like hearing this, I could see why investors would be like,
[00:21:50] Lenny Rachitsky: yeah, you know, like I guess so.
[00:21:52] Lenny Rachitsky: But slides has been around.
[00:21:53] Lenny Rachitsky: PowerPoint has been around 40 years.
[00:21:55] Lenny Rachitsky: Like I get it, you know, I get why people would be.
[00:21:57] Lenny Rachitsky: And specifically AI, was that a part of the vision initially
[00:22:00] Lenny Rachitsky: or did AI start to come up and then while great timing?
[00:22:04] Great timing.
[00:22:04] It wasn't part of the original vision,
[00:22:06] Grant Lee: although the spirit was there, which is we
[00:22:08] Grant Lee: want to make it incredibly fast and effortless
[00:22:11] Grant Lee: for people to create content.
[00:22:12] Grant Lee: So it just so happened that AI was a magical gift that
[00:22:15] Grant Lee: allowed us to do all those things along the same sort
[00:22:18] Grant Lee: of ambition or vision that we had.
[00:22:20] Grant Lee: And so we integrated it core to kind of all the building
[00:22:23] Grant Lee: blocks we were already building while before AI was part
[00:22:26] Grant Lee: of the picture.
[00:22:26] Grant Lee: It's such a cool other example.
[00:22:28] Lenny Rachitsky: There's so many examples of ideas that were not possible
[00:22:31] Lenny Rachitsky: before are now very possible with AI.
[00:22:33] Lenny Rachitsky: And it's a great opportunity for people to come after as you
[00:22:35] Lenny Rachitsky: like places, categories, people think is an impossible place
[00:22:39] Lenny Rachitsky: to build a big business AI now allows it.
[00:22:42] Awesome.
[00:22:43] Lenny Rachitsky: Speaking of that, let's talk about the growth journey
[00:22:45] Lenny Rachitsky: and how you actually grew from nothing
[00:22:47] Lenny Rachitsky: to 100 million ARR in just over two years.
[00:22:51] Lenny Rachitsky: I'm thinking we break it up.
[00:22:52] Lenny Rachitsky: I know these milestones aren't that clear,
[00:22:54] Lenny Rachitsky: but kind of like zero to 100 million ARR, one to 10 to 100,
[00:23:00] Lenny Rachitsky: something like that.
[00:23:02] Lenny Rachitsky: And let's just kind of see how it goes.
[00:23:05] Lenny Rachitsky: How did you get your first set of users?
[00:23:06] Lenny Rachitsky: How did you get your say 100 first 100 users?
[00:23:08] Lenny Rachitsky: How did you get to 100 million ARR from zero?
[00:23:10] Lenny Rachitsky: Our first 100 looks very different, I'd say,
[00:23:12] Grant Lee: so this was even pre this sort of AI laundry
[00:23:15] Grant Lee: had.
[00:23:16] Grant Lee: The first 100 users for a product like ours,
[00:23:18] Grant Lee: you're trying to convince all your friends.
[00:23:19] Grant Lee: He used the product.
[00:23:20] Grant Lee: Anybody that's ever made a slide deck,
[00:23:22] Grant Lee: you're trying to talk to.
[00:23:23] And I think early on, your friends
[00:23:26] Grant Lee: wanted to do your favor so they could try the product.
[00:23:28] Grant Lee: They're also going to lie to you.
[00:23:29] Grant Lee: They're going to tell you how great it is.
[00:23:31] Grant Lee: And then you look at the usage and nobody's coming back.
[00:23:33] Grant Lee: And so I think our first 100 was sort of like gradually
[00:23:35] Grant Lee: hard-earned post sort of the product
[00:23:37] Grant Lee: comp launch, people learning like, OK,
[00:23:39] Grant Lee: this is kind of becoming a little bit more useful.
[00:23:41] Grant Lee: Usage was still pretty episodic.
[00:23:43] Grant Lee: So they weren't coming back every week.
[00:23:45] Grant Lee: And then I think, do think, the moment post sort
[00:23:47] Grant Lee: of the AI launch is where all of a sudden,
[00:23:50] Grant Lee: we saw that sort of organic growth happening,
[00:23:51] Grant Lee: people coming back to the product regularly.
[00:23:54] Grant Lee: And so that's where it wasn't even the first 100
[00:23:55] Grant Lee: was like the first 10,000 users all came within a pretty short
[00:24:00] Grant Lee: time period after that initial launch.
[00:24:02] Grant Lee: Awesome.
[00:24:03] Lenny Rachitsky: We're going to talk about monetization pricing later,
[00:24:05] Lenny Rachitsky: which is obviously an important part of actual getting
[00:24:07] Lenny Rachitsky: 2 million error and 10 million error.
[00:24:09] So what I'm hearing essentially is the product cut launch
[00:24:11] Lenny Rachitsky: was a big part of just the first 10,000-ish users.
[00:24:16] Lenny Rachitsky: I know there was also a tweet when you first,
[00:24:19] Lenny Rachitsky: when you relaunched that helped in a big way, talk about that.
[00:24:24] Yeah, so when we did our AI launch,
[00:24:27] Grant Lee: we didn't do our AI launch on product
[00:24:28] Grant Lee: tongue.
[00:24:29] Grant Lee: We just basically said, hey, let's just
[00:24:30] Grant Lee: put it out on Twitter, see if we can get some virality.
[00:24:34] Grant Lee: And honestly, we kind of came up with kind of a click
[00:24:36] Grant Lee: baity sort of tweet.
[00:24:38] Grant Lee: It was like the most valuable skill in business
[00:24:41] Grant Lee: is about to become obsolete.
[00:24:43] And so it was intentional on that.
[00:24:46] Grant Lee: We wanted to create a little bit of engagement.
[00:24:48] Grant Lee: We knew that having sort of a more provocative in a tweet
[00:24:51] Grant Lee: would allow people to engage with it.
[00:24:54] Grant Lee: And so after a couple of days, all of a sudden
[00:24:56] Grant Lee: it started getting a little bit more viral and a lot more
[00:24:59] Grant Lee: engagement.
[00:25:00] Grant Lee: And we looked, and it was basically because Paul Graham
[00:25:02] Grant Lee: had commented and saying something like, surely the thing
[00:25:06] Grant Lee: that the slide deck is describing
[00:25:07] Grant Lee: is more valuable than the slide itself, right?
[00:25:10] Grant Lee: And obviously, it was fun just to see that comment.
[00:25:13] Grant Lee: I think once that comment came through,
[00:25:15] Grant Lee: like even more engagement on the post.
[00:25:16] Grant Lee: And that was really the whole intent of that post
[00:25:18] Grant Lee: was just to be able to have that level of engagement
[00:25:21] Grant Lee: so that people, we have some level of reach.
[00:25:24] Grant Lee: And so for me, it was almost like my first learning
[00:25:27] Grant Lee: moment going back to what does founder let marketing even
[00:25:30] Grant Lee: mean?
[00:25:31] Grant Lee: It means how do you actually break through the noise?
[00:25:32] Grant Lee: How do you get a chance to have people even engage
[00:25:35] Grant Lee: with a post like that?
[00:25:36] Grant Lee: Part of that is copyrighting.
[00:25:37] Grant Lee: Part of that is storytelling.
[00:25:39] Grant Lee: Part of that is just having even the right visuals
[00:25:41] Grant Lee: to share.
[00:25:42] Grant Lee: And so for me, kind of a moment just understanding, hey,
[00:25:46] Grant Lee: they kind of do this right?
[00:25:47] Grant Lee: You kind of have to do things that maybe you're not
[00:25:49] Grant Lee: super comfortable with, but it makes a difference.
[00:25:52] Such a fun story.
[00:25:53] Lenny Rachitsky: So you intentionally set that announcement up
[00:25:56] Lenny Rachitsky: to be controversial is what I'm hearing.
[00:25:58] Totally.
[00:25:58] Yeah.
[00:25:59] Grant Lee: I'd say provocative little spicy.
[00:26:00] Grant Lee: That is so cool.
[00:26:01] Lenny Rachitsky: So essentially, you got to 10,000 users
[00:26:04] Lenny Rachitsky: through product hunt.
[00:26:05] Lenny Rachitsky: And then essentially one controversial tweet
[00:26:08] Lenny Rachitsky: that ended up baiting Paul Graham to comment.
[00:26:11] It's amazing.
[00:26:12] Lenny Rachitsky: And was it a comment?
[00:26:13] Lenny Rachitsky: It was just a comment.
[00:26:14] Lenny Rachitsky: Was it even him retweeting it?
[00:26:16] Not just a comment.
[00:26:17] Grant Lee: Yeah.
[00:26:18] Grant Lee: And then others were, you know, pal on.
[00:26:19] Grant Lee: Yeah.
[00:26:20] Lenny Rachitsky: It's interesting.
[00:26:21] Lenny Rachitsky: I want you to comment can increase the distribution
[00:26:23] Lenny Rachitsky: of a tweet versus them retweeting it or quote, tweeting it.
[00:26:26] Lenny Rachitsky: Totally.
[00:26:27] Grant Lee: And of course, the algorithm changed all the time.
[00:26:28] Grant Lee: So part of which is long-paced on when it happened,
[00:26:30] Grant Lee: how it happened, who posted?
[00:26:32] Grant Lee: And you let use this term founder, let marketing,
[00:26:35] Lenny Rachitsky: which I love.
[00:26:35] Lenny Rachitsky: And I'm already seeing it in action here.
[00:26:37] Lenny Rachitsky: This is you thinking about.
[00:26:38] Lenny Rachitsky: It's not like delegating to someone in marketing.
[00:26:40] Lenny Rachitsky: It's not hiring an agency.
[00:26:42] Lenny Rachitsky: It's like, how do I tell a story that I think
[00:26:45] Lenny Rachitsky: will break through the noise based on you building
[00:26:47] Lenny Rachitsky: this company, having me insight to build this product?
[00:26:50] Lenny Rachitsky: And I guess there's anything more there.
[00:26:52] Lenny Rachitsky: You think it's important for people to hear,
[00:26:53] Lenny Rachitsky: but the importance of the founder thinking through this stuff.
[00:26:56] Yeah.
[00:26:57] Grant Lee: I think most people today are probably
[00:26:59] Grant Lee: familiar with founder-led sales, which
[00:27:00] Grant Lee: is still very, very important.
[00:27:01] Grant Lee: I think before you hire your first sales person or sales,
[00:27:05] Grant Lee: it's great for the founder to understand what it takes.
[00:27:08] Grant Lee: And they're going to craft the right narrative, the right
[00:27:10] Grant Lee: story.
[00:27:11] Grant Lee: At my previous role, I was the COO at a startup
[00:27:14] Grant Lee: where I was doing a lot of, I was unfounder,
[00:27:16] Grant Lee: but I was early.
[00:27:17] Grant Lee: And so I was helping the founders go through this
[00:27:19] Grant Lee: and really helping go into meetings with a client or prospect
[00:27:22] Grant Lee: and saying, hey, this is why our product is interesting.
[00:27:26] Grant Lee: And I think today, there's so many AI startups
[00:27:29] Grant Lee: that are much more either B2C or Per Sumer.
[00:27:32] Grant Lee: And so you're not necessarily talking
[00:27:33] Grant Lee: to individual prospects, but the idea
[00:27:36] Grant Lee: that you can be really in control of the narrative
[00:27:39] Grant Lee: on the marketing side is really, really important.
[00:27:41] Grant Lee: And I think I'll describe a few things where over time,
[00:27:44] Grant Lee: I think that skill set just really, really helps you.
[00:27:48] Grant Lee: One is, you have a chance to be a creator yourself these days.
[00:27:51] Grant Lee: I think a lot of founders are trying
[00:27:53] Grant Lee: to be more active on social media.
[00:27:55] Grant Lee: And I think if you can overcome the initial cringe factor
[00:27:59] Grant Lee: of seeing yourself and posting, this doesn't feel authentic,
[00:28:03] Grant Lee: if you can overcome that initial feeling,
[00:28:05] Grant Lee: you start investing into, how do I become a better copywriter?
[00:28:09] Grant Lee: How do I articulate something that is clear, not just clever?
[00:28:14] Grant Lee: I think there's that saying where, obviously,
[00:28:16] Grant Lee: if you can have that clarity, that's super important.
[00:28:17] Grant Lee: And most people will try to get super creative
[00:28:21] Grant Lee: with their copywriting, but that's not usually
[00:28:22] Grant Lee: the right way to break through and communicate something.
[00:28:25] Grant Lee: So how do you improve your own copywriting?
[00:28:27] Grant Lee: And then that allows you to actually have a higher bar
[00:28:30] when you start working with other marketers,
[00:28:32] Grant Lee: or in this case, for us, working with influencers.
[00:28:35] Grant Lee: If you're working with influencers and creators,
[00:28:38] Grant Lee: and you can totally empathize with how they approach that work,
[00:28:41] Grant Lee: and you know what a good hook looks like,
[00:28:43] Grant Lee: or you know how a structure a good post,
[00:28:46] Grant Lee: you can only do that if you've gone through it a little bit
[00:28:48] Grant Lee: yourself, and you know how hard it is.
[00:28:50] Grant Lee: And I think too many founders will then just say,
[00:28:52] Grant Lee: they'll write something that just feels so much like an ad,
[00:28:56] Grant Lee: and then they'll give it to a creator to help amplify,
[00:28:58] Grant Lee: and that just never works.
[00:28:59] Grant Lee: And so I do think part of the founder-led marketing
[00:29:02] Grant Lee: is going through this yourself, using your own platform,
[00:29:05] Grant Lee: in the beginning, it's probably going to be super small,
[00:29:07] Grant Lee: but as you get bigger, you have a platform
[00:29:09] Grant Lee: that you have a voice, and people listen,
[00:29:11] Grant Lee: and you're going to get better and better
[00:29:13] Grant Lee: in your own storytelling.
[00:29:14] Grant Lee: I think these are all skills you should invest in
[00:29:15] Grant Lee: as early as possible, because you know you're going to have
[00:29:18] Grant Lee: to get better and better, it's like practice.
[00:29:19] Grant Lee: You got to practice over and over.
[00:29:21] I definitely want to pull on this thread more,
[00:29:22] Lenny Rachitsky: because you tweeting the lessons you learned building gamma
[00:29:26] Lenny Rachitsky: is what led to this conversation.
[00:29:28] Lenny Rachitsky: I was reading and I'm like, okay, he's sharing a bunch of stuff,
[00:29:31] Lenny Rachitsky: but there's so much more I want to hear,
[00:29:33] Lenny Rachitsky: and we're going to talk through this and go a lot,
[00:29:35] Lenny Rachitsky: and a lot more depth than what you've shared on Twitter,
[00:29:37] Lenny Rachitsky: but I love that that's example of that working,
[00:29:39] Lenny Rachitsky: and having this conversation.
[00:29:41] Lenny Rachitsky: So let me ask a couple of questions here.
[00:29:43] Lenny Rachitsky: One is just how do you find time as a founder or CEO
[00:29:46] Lenny Rachitsky: of a very fast growing, tactic, crazy startup?
[00:29:49] Lenny Rachitsky: We have so much to do.
[00:29:50] Lenny Rachitsky: How do you just like allocate the time to do this?
[00:29:52] Lenny Rachitsky: And then any just key lessons you've learned
[00:29:54] Lenny Rachitsky: about doing this well beyond what you've already shared
[00:29:56] Lenny Rachitsky: for people that are not wanting to try
[00:29:58] Lenny Rachitsky: to start sharing things on LinkedIn and Twitter.
[00:30:00] Lenny Rachitsky: My advice is definitely just to try to start small.
[00:30:02] Grant Lee: Don't let it become so intimidating
[00:30:05] Grant Lee: that you just don't get started.
[00:30:06] Grant Lee: For me, it was like just having a no pad or Google doc
[00:30:10] Grant Lee: around in the beginning where I would just constantly jot down,
[00:30:13] Grant Lee: okay, this is something I learned
[00:30:14] Grant Lee: or something I observed or something that worked well,
[00:30:17] Grant Lee: something that was unintuitive but worked,
[00:30:19] Grant Lee: and just start creating a log of that.
[00:30:22] Grant Lee: And then once I had enough of those,
[00:30:23] Grant Lee: and I would spend basically every week,
[00:30:25] Grant Lee: I'd block off a few hours to go a little bit deeper.
[00:30:28] Grant Lee: I take a lot of those bullet points and try to say,
[00:30:30] Grant Lee: is there enough here to turn this into maybe a post
[00:30:33] Grant Lee: or something that can be shared broadly?
[00:30:36] Grant Lee: And in the beginning, I didn't have enough.
[00:30:38] Grant Lee: It was all sort of scattered thoughts,
[00:30:40] Grant Lee: but over time, you started accumulating some interesting themes
[00:30:43] Grant Lee: and then I would start stress testing that some of that.
[00:30:45] Grant Lee: So I would tell my teammates,
[00:30:47] Grant Lee: okay, this is something interesting,
[00:30:48] Grant Lee: like, do you find this interesting?
[00:30:50] Grant Lee: And if there were enough, like, oh yeah,
[00:30:52] Grant Lee: that's, I would not have expected that
[00:30:54] Grant Lee: or that's not something I've never heard before,
[00:30:56] Grant Lee: then I'd actually start crafting the initial post
[00:30:59] Grant Lee: and then you actually just put it out there.
[00:31:01] Grant Lee: I think what I've learned is,
[00:31:02] Grant Lee: even for LinkedIn versus Twitter,
[00:31:04] the audiences want different things.
[00:31:05] Grant Lee: And so you almost have to then have different tones of voices
[00:31:08] Grant Lee: or like, you know, even nuggets are sharing.
[00:31:10] Grant Lee: For me, I invested much more in LinkedIn early on
[00:31:12] Grant Lee: just because it felt a little bit more natural for me.
[00:31:15] Grant Lee: And then over time, I said, okay,
[00:31:16] Grant Lee: well, I'm gonna start packaging certain content for Twitter.
[00:31:19] Grant Lee: That's actually different than what I would post on LinkedIn.
[00:31:21] Grant Lee: Sometimes on Twitter, you get even more tactical
[00:31:24] Grant Lee: or even more into the weeds.
[00:31:25] Grant Lee: And so I found that to be helpful,
[00:31:27] Grant Lee: but honestly, I'm still learning.
[00:31:28] Grant Lee: And so like every time you post, you go back,
[00:31:31] Grant Lee: you know, I have a couple of weeks to go and say,
[00:31:32] Grant Lee: okay, what things are actually being engaged with?
[00:31:34] Grant Lee: Like are things actually creating,
[00:31:36] Grant Lee: like ideally you're creating enough value
[00:31:38] Grant Lee: where people are either bookmarking it,
[00:31:40] Grant Lee: sharing it, retweeting it, you know,
[00:31:42] Grant Lee: these things that are signals for,
[00:31:44] Grant Lee: there's something valuable there.
[00:31:46] Grant Lee: And then you just go back and you start collecting
[00:31:48] Grant Lee: your own sort of, you know,
[00:31:49] Grant Lee: these are my all-star posts.
[00:31:50] Grant Lee: Like these are the ones that I've actually,
[00:31:52] Grant Lee: you know, broken through.
[00:31:53] Grant Lee: And then you go back and try to understand,
[00:31:54] Grant Lee: okay, what about that post?
[00:31:56] Grant Lee: So I think it was actually useful.
[00:31:57] Grant Lee: Is it the actual content?
[00:31:58] Grant Lee: Was it the structure of the content?
[00:32:00] Grant Lee: Was it some sort of contrarian advice?
[00:32:02] Grant Lee: And you start thematically bunching that together
[00:32:04] Grant Lee: such that as your brainstorming every week,
[00:32:06] Grant Lee: you just have a good sort of body of work to work off.
[00:32:10] This is so interesting and valuable.
[00:32:12] Lenny Rachitsky: So let me mirror back a few of the lessons
[00:32:14] Lenny Rachitsky: that I heard here that I think is easy for people to miss.
[00:32:16] Lenny Rachitsky: So one is just what to share.
[00:32:19] Lenny Rachitsky: What I heard here and I completely agree with this
[00:32:21] Lenny Rachitsky: and this is what I try to do is pay attention
[00:32:23] Lenny Rachitsky: to things you've learned, things that you find interesting,
[00:32:27] Lenny Rachitsky: things that are unintuitive to you,
[00:32:29] Lenny Rachitsky: just like have a doc and just put these there.
[00:32:32] Lenny Rachitsky: Any time you learn something, find something interesting,
[00:32:34] Lenny Rachitsky: just add it to the doc.
[00:32:36] Or yeah, I haven't heard before is a good one too.
[00:32:39] Lenny Rachitsky: So essentially just like if you find it interesting,
[00:32:41] Lenny Rachitsky: people on social media will also find it interesting.
[00:32:44] Lenny Rachitsky: And one approach is to share it as it's happening,
[00:32:47] Lenny Rachitsky: which is what I try to do, just like,
[00:32:48] Lenny Rachitsky: oh, I just learned this thing with Clockcode,
[00:32:50] Lenny Rachitsky: check it out, or save it up for a big long post.
[00:32:54] The other interesting, I've never heard this before,
[00:32:56] Lenny Rachitsky: is like post different things to LinkedIn and Twitter.
[00:32:59] Lenny Rachitsky: I just copy and paste the same thing.
[00:33:01] Lenny Rachitsky: I love that you do something different
[00:33:03] Lenny Rachitsky: for the two platforms.
[00:33:05] I think we all kind of have intuition
[00:33:07] Grant Lee: that there's different audiences, right?
[00:33:09] Grant Lee: And so if you know that kind of fundamentally,
[00:33:11] Grant Lee: then the question is, how do you package up the story
[00:33:14] Grant Lee: the right way so that the audience is ready to receive it?
[00:33:19] Grant Lee: And I think it's getting differed by the type of creator
[00:33:23] Grant Lee: or the founder whoever's posting it.
[00:33:25] Grant Lee: And of course the actual content itself.
[00:33:27] Grant Lee: So for me, I'm still tweaking,
[00:33:28] Grant Lee: but I do find that just copying and pasting,
[00:33:31] Grant Lee: from one to the other, doesn't usually work.
[00:33:34] Grant Lee: It really, like you almost need to be in the right mindset
[00:33:37] Grant Lee: of like, what do I think will be more engaging on Twitter?
[00:33:40] Grant Lee: And then what do I think will be more engaging on LinkedIn?
[00:33:43] Grant Lee: And then kind of test a bunch,
[00:33:45] Grant Lee: see what actually works, go back and iterate a little bit.
[00:33:49] So if you had like one bullet point tip
[00:33:50] Lenny Rachitsky: for what works on Twitter versus LinkedIn,
[00:33:52] Lenny Rachitsky: you shared maybe more tactical on Twitter,
[00:33:54] Lenny Rachitsky: is there anything more there you can share?
[00:33:56] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, that's what I found is like tactical,
[00:33:58] Grant Lee: oftentimes more contrarian on Twitter.
[00:34:01] Grant Lee: And also, I would say technical too.
[00:34:04] Grant Lee: People really like to know, again, going back to like,
[00:34:09] Grant Lee: getting into the weeds, like, is this something
[00:34:10] Grant Lee: I feel like I could replicate?
[00:34:12] Grant Lee: And I'm not going to give you, like,
[00:34:13] Grant Lee: there's no credibility if you just give like a blanket statement
[00:34:15] Grant Lee: or something that feels generic.
[00:34:17] Grant Lee: Like I really need to know,
[00:34:18] Grant Lee: if you could show me the metrics even better,
[00:34:20] Grant Lee: I feel like that.
[00:34:22] Grant Lee: Versus like LinkedIn, it's more, oftentimes more even,
[00:34:25] Grant Lee: just, you know, either more aspirational or aspirational
[00:34:29] Grant Lee: or like a topic or a theme that just feels like relevant
[00:34:33] Grant Lee: at that point in time.
[00:34:35] And you can just kind of make it more of a,
[00:34:37] Grant Lee: you know, broader statement.
[00:34:38] Grant Lee: It doesn't need to be as tactical.
[00:34:39] Grant Lee: It's more like inspirational.
[00:34:40] Grant Lee: It's like, oh, okay, now I need to go and learn a little bit
[00:34:42] Grant Lee: more about pricing and packaging, for instance.
[00:34:44] Grant Lee: And that could be the sort of spark that somebody needs.
[00:34:47] Grant Lee: And you don't need to, you know, spell it completely out.
[00:34:49] Grant Lee: Part of it is also that on LinkedIn,
[00:34:51] Grant Lee: you can't really do threads.
[00:34:52] Grant Lee: And so, you know, doing like a super long form post
[00:34:55] Grant Lee: isn't as practical.
[00:34:56] Grant Lee: Maybe that changes in the future where maybe the tactical pieces,
[00:34:59] Grant Lee: you know, that element might actually change.
[00:35:01] Grant Lee: And the last piece is you said you just block off time.
[00:35:03] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there like a specific time of the week you do this?
[00:35:05] Lenny Rachitsky: How do you actually, because everyone's like,
[00:35:06] Lenny Rachitsky: oh, sure, I'll block off time and then,
[00:35:08] Lenny Rachitsky: I don't know, okay, but I actually got to do all this other
[00:35:09] Lenny Rachitsky: stuff. So I'm not gonna use it this time.
[00:35:11] Lenny Rachitsky: Oh, maybe next week.
[00:35:12] Lenny Rachitsky: For me, it's usually two times of the day.
[00:35:14] Grant Lee: Very first thing in the morning and lasting at night.
[00:35:18] Grant Lee: And partly is because of kids.
[00:35:20] Grant Lee: It's almost like I need time,
[00:35:21] Grant Lee: but there's just zero distraction.
[00:35:24] Grant Lee: And there's no noise in the house.
[00:35:25] Grant Lee: And so I can actually think.
[00:35:27] And then, you know, I think in the mornings,
[00:35:29] Grant Lee: it's about where are you finding inspiration?
[00:35:31] Grant Lee: Like, where are you energy?
[00:35:33] Grant Lee: Like, what are topics you're energized by?
[00:35:35] Grant Lee: And then I think at night, it's about reflection.
[00:35:37] Grant Lee: Like, what are the things you actually went through that day?
[00:35:39] Grant Lee: You could almost pull up your calendar and be like,
[00:35:41] Grant Lee: okay, I talked to X, Y and Z people.
[00:35:43] Grant Lee: And was there anything from those conversations
[00:35:45] Grant Lee: that might be relevant?
[00:35:46] Grant Lee: That's where, you know, write some of those things.
[00:35:48] Grant Lee: It's more of a recap of asher what happened.
[00:35:50] Grant Lee: And what helps me to not feel like this is some
[00:35:52] Lenny Rachitsky: cringy self-promote, egotistical stuff is just,
[00:35:56] Lenny Rachitsky: it's useful stuff that I've learned
[00:35:58] Lenny Rachitsky: that ends up being helpful to people
[00:35:59] Lenny Rachitsky: and people in the comments.
[00:36:00] Lenny Rachitsky: Or is just like, oh, that is really cool and useful.
[00:36:02] Lenny Rachitsky: Thank you.
[00:36:03] Lenny Rachitsky: It's not like self-promotion.
[00:36:05] Lenny Rachitsky: It's not just like, look how amazing I am.
[00:36:06] Lenny Rachitsky: Look, check out my amazing products.
[00:36:08] Lenny Rachitsky: Like, here's the thing I learned.
[00:36:09] Lenny Rachitsky: You might find it useful.
[00:36:11] That's exactly right.
[00:36:12] Grant Lee: I think, you know, one way of thinking about it,
[00:36:14] Grant Lee: you know, with like founder-led sales,
[00:36:16] Grant Lee: it's always about like exchange of value, right?
[00:36:18] Grant Lee: You want to be able to give them the customer,
[00:36:21] Grant Lee: this feeling that they're getting an amazing product
[00:36:24] Grant Lee: and exchange they're gonna pay you money for it.
[00:36:26] Grant Lee: I think with like founder-led marketing,
[00:36:28] Grant Lee: it's almost as mindset of, you wanna give people
[00:36:31] Grant Lee: ton of content, maybe it's like, you know,
[00:36:33] Grant Lee: a value in the contents,
[00:36:34] Grant Lee: or you're sharing something, maybe some, you know,
[00:36:36] Grant Lee: some secret tactic, or, you know,
[00:36:38] Grant Lee: you're giving them something where they, you know,
[00:36:40] Grant Lee: then, apparently there's value in it.
[00:36:42] Grant Lee: And in exchange, you sort of get good will back.
[00:36:44] Grant Lee: You're not necessarily getting money back.
[00:36:46] Grant Lee: You get good will.
[00:36:47] Grant Lee: They're gonna follow you.
[00:36:47] Grant Lee: They're gonna engage with their posts.
[00:36:49] Grant Lee: They're gonna tell others about it.
[00:36:50] Grant Lee: And then over time, you can exchange,
[00:36:52] maybe some of that good will for like,
[00:36:54] Grant Lee: actually talking about my product and like announcing it.
[00:36:56] Grant Lee: And they're gonna help amplify the news.
[00:36:58] Grant Lee: And I think that's magic,
[00:36:59] Grant Lee: where you kind of kind of bank the good will
[00:37:00] Grant Lee: for a long period of time
[00:37:02] Grant Lee: by providing just a ton of value
[00:37:03] Grant Lee: with no expectation of anything immediately in return.
[00:37:06] The book I always point people to when they're,
[00:37:07] Lenny Rachitsky: when they're struggling with this sort of thing.
[00:37:09] Lenny Rachitsky: And like, yeah, I did this and no one,
[00:37:11] Lenny Rachitsky: like, no one cared, didn't do any good.
[00:37:13] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there's a book by Scott Pressfield,
[00:37:16] Lenny Rachitsky: I think is his name called,
[00:37:17] Lenny Rachitsky: Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.
[00:37:20] Which is exactly what is right.
[00:37:22] Lenny Rachitsky: Nobody wants to read it.
[00:37:24] Lenny Rachitsky: The bar for people to care is very high.
[00:37:26] Lenny Rachitsky: There's so much stuff to read in process.
[00:37:28] Lenny Rachitsky: And so this book gives you a really good lens
[00:37:30] Lenny Rachitsky: of just like, okay, the bar is very high
[00:37:33] Lenny Rachitsky: and nobody wants to read your shit.
[00:37:35] Lenny Rachitsky: So you have to try really hard to make it really good.
[00:37:38] Great reminder.
[00:37:39] Grant Lee: We'll look to that in the show notes.
[00:37:40] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay, let's get into,
[00:37:42] Lenny Rachitsky: let's come back to the growth of Gamma.
[00:37:44] Lenny Rachitsky: So we've talked about how you got your first
[00:37:46] Lenny Rachitsky: tens of thousands of users.
[00:37:47] Lenny Rachitsky: Essentially product hunts,
[00:37:49] Lenny Rachitsky: rethinking onboarding, making it really magical.
[00:37:52] Lenny Rachitsky: And then this very controversial tweet
[00:37:55] Lenny Rachitsky: that Paul Graham commented created some buzz.
[00:37:57] Lenny Rachitsky: Let's talk about the next phase
[00:37:59] Lenny Rachitsky: and maybe I don't know,
[00:38:00] Lenny Rachitsky: tell us kind of the ARR at that point
[00:38:02] Lenny Rachitsky: through 100 million,
[00:38:04] Lenny Rachitsky: just like broadly, what should we know?
[00:38:07] So when we got to about 10 million in ARR,
[00:38:09] Grant Lee: I think there's this feeling for me,
[00:38:12] Grant Lee: which is we knew we needed ways to help
[00:38:14] Grant Lee: just continue to amplify and spread the word about Gamma.
[00:38:17] Grant Lee: I think it was already working
[00:38:19] Grant Lee: in terms of the organic virality was there.
[00:38:22] Grant Lee: And so we did feel like it was time
[00:38:23] Grant Lee: to start amplifying some of this.
[00:38:26] Grant Lee: And I think the main blocker of my mind
[00:38:28] Grant Lee: that I started feeling was that
[00:38:29] Grant Lee: our initial brand was sort of holding us back.
[00:38:32] Grant Lee: And I think a lot of people discount,
[00:38:34] Grant Lee: whether or not a rebrand is valuable.
[00:38:36] Grant Lee: And I think sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.
[00:38:39] Grant Lee: For us, there's a few different things we looked at.
[00:38:41] Grant Lee: So one, our initial brand was almost more of a placeholder brand
[00:38:45] Grant Lee: because we created it,
[00:38:46] Grant Lee: the moment we sort of incorporated the company,
[00:38:49] Grant Lee: which is again, like late 2020, beginning of 2021,
[00:38:52] Grant Lee: where we needed something so that as we built,
[00:38:55] Grant Lee: we could at least share it with people,
[00:38:56] Grant Lee: we could put up a landing page
[00:38:57] Grant Lee: and just feel like, okay, there's something here,
[00:39:00] but we didn't invest a whole lot into it.
[00:39:02] Grant Lee: And so it was pretty limited in sort of what I call,
[00:39:04] Grant Lee: the DNA of the brand.
[00:39:05] Grant Lee: There wasn't that many,
[00:39:06] Grant Lee: the art direction was very limited in scope.
[00:39:09] Grant Lee: There wasn't much when it came to like, voice and tone.
[00:39:12] Grant Lee: And so it was something that we knew was good enough to start,
[00:39:17] Grant Lee: but it wasn't scalable.
[00:39:18] Grant Lee: And when I think about something that could be scalable,
[00:39:20] Grant Lee: it's almost like you can take the ingredients of a brand
[00:39:23] Grant Lee: and replicate it a ton.
[00:39:24] Grant Lee: Like you're kind of,
[00:39:25] Grant Lee: this DNA is something where you can imagine creating tons
[00:39:28] Grant Lee: of content around and all feeling pretty cohesive.
[00:39:31] Grant Lee: And I don't, I think that needs to be done by design.
[00:39:33] Grant Lee: Like you're really being thoughtful about every single element.
[00:39:36] Grant Lee: Like what is the art direction you wanna go with?
[00:39:38] Grant Lee: What is the voice and tone such that as you're creating,
[00:39:41] Grant Lee: thousands of pieces of copy,
[00:39:43] Grant Lee: it all feels pretty cohesive.
[00:39:45] Grant Lee: And so we kind of went back to the drawing board
[00:39:46] Grant Lee: and we spent many months kind of rethinking
[00:39:49] Grant Lee: what would be the brand.
[00:39:51] Grant Lee: What is this vision that we have longer term?
[00:39:54] Grant Lee: Our creative doctor internally partnered with Smith Indiction
[00:39:57] Grant Lee: and amazing agency that has helped,
[00:40:00] Grant Lee: you know, folks like Problexity also do their rebrand
[00:40:02] Grant Lee: or their initial brand.
[00:40:04] Grant Lee: And we were, we were some many months just like,
[00:40:06] Grant Lee: really trying to craft kind of what we think
[00:40:08] Grant Lee: is like the core DNA of the brand.
[00:40:10] And doing so in a way that we could replicate it
[00:40:13] Grant Lee: as much as possible.
[00:40:14] Grant Lee: Replication piece of it comes into play
[00:40:16] Grant Lee: because as you start scaling,
[00:40:18] Grant Lee: you're gonna have to create a ton of content.
[00:40:20] Grant Lee: Your own content on social media,
[00:40:22] Grant Lee: ads on, you know, for performance marketing,
[00:40:25] assets for influencers to be able to use
[00:40:27] Grant Lee: and showcase in their content.
[00:40:29] Grant Lee: And so you're going from like, you know,
[00:40:31] tiny pieces of content to all of a sudden,
[00:40:33] Grant Lee: every week we're testing thousands of pieces of creative.
[00:40:36] Grant Lee: And you cannot do that if you don't feel confident
[00:40:39] Grant Lee: that as you're replicating,
[00:40:40] Grant Lee: like you have that sort of cohesive feel.
[00:40:42] So for us that we realize it was going to be necessary
[00:40:44] Grant Lee: and it's why we invested so much.
[00:40:45] Grant Lee: And end up being, I mean way more expensive,
[00:40:47] Grant Lee: way more time consuming that I would have imagined.
[00:40:50] Grant Lee: But I think coming, you know,
[00:40:51] Grant Lee: on the other side of it being the right investment,
[00:40:53] Grant Lee: feeling that that was the right time to do.
[00:40:55] Grant Lee: I love how many things you did that feel like this one,
[00:40:58] Lenny Rachitsky: this would, we'll not work out.
[00:41:01] Lenny Rachitsky: Building a startup within the presentation space,
[00:41:03] Lenny Rachitsky: doing a whole rebrand
[00:41:05] Lenny Rachitsky: in the middle of scaling.
[00:41:08] Lenny Rachitsky: Also just reworking the entire product after you launched
[00:41:10] Lenny Rachitsky: and just like rethinking the whole thing.
[00:41:12] Lenny Rachitsky: Like all these things and everyone's always like,
[00:41:13] Lenny Rachitsky: no, this is not how we went.
[00:41:15] Lenny Rachitsky: And interestingly worked out for you guys.
[00:41:19] I want to come back to the brand stuff.
[00:41:21] Lenny Rachitsky: But one of the most interesting ways you guys grew early on
[00:41:24] Lenny Rachitsky: was influencer marketing,
[00:41:26] which a lot of people hear about and talk about,
[00:41:29] Lenny Rachitsky: I haven't heard a much of like had actually do this
[00:41:32] Lenny Rachitsky: and what actually works.
[00:41:34] Lenny Rachitsky: Talk about that as a broad growth lever for you guys.
[00:41:37] Lenny Rachitsky: And then I want to get into just like,
[00:41:39] Lenny Rachitsky: what tools did you use?
[00:41:40] Lenny Rachitsky: Who actually was really helpful there?
[00:41:41] Lenny Rachitsky: So I think that's exactly that.
[00:41:42] Lenny Rachitsky: So yeah, just give us the big picture.
[00:41:44] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, I think a lot of founders assume that
[00:41:47] Grant Lee: with influencer marketing, it's almost like turnkey.
[00:41:50] Grant Lee: You set aside a budget, you find some creators,
[00:41:53] you figure out the right campaign
[00:41:54] Grant Lee: or the right moment of time to do it.
[00:41:56] Grant Lee: And it's all done.
[00:41:57] Grant Lee: You're ready to go.
[00:41:58] Grant Lee: And I think the reality is like going back to like this
[00:42:01] Grant Lee: founder led marketing mindset is like,
[00:42:03] Grant Lee: well, you're going to set yourself up for success
[00:42:06] Grant Lee: if you actually are super involved in that entire process.
[00:42:10] Grant Lee: So for us, what this meant was like,
[00:42:11] Grant Lee: all the initial influencers,
[00:42:13] Grant Lee: I onboarded manually myself.
[00:42:15] We would find I would spend time,
[00:42:17] Grant Lee: I would jump on a call with each one of them
[00:42:20] Grant Lee: so that they understood what gamma represented,
[00:42:23] Grant Lee: how to use the product.
[00:42:24] Grant Lee: You want to be able to have them tell your story
[00:42:27] Grant Lee: but in their voice, right?
[00:42:29] Grant Lee: And they can't do that if you're not willing
[00:42:30] Grant Lee: to put in that investment.
[00:42:32] Grant Lee: And so we would spend a lot of time like going through,
[00:42:34] Grant Lee: it wasn't my job to tell them how to pitch gamma
[00:42:37] Grant Lee: but it was my job to make sure that they understood
[00:42:39] Grant Lee: what gamma was as a product.
[00:42:40] Grant Lee: And so we would spend a lot of time like me
[00:42:42] Grant Lee: just walking through the product,
[00:42:43] Grant Lee: then asking questions, us like just kind of brainstorming
[00:42:46] Grant Lee: what could the hooks be and me just giving them
[00:42:48] Grant Lee: some initial feedback and like saying,
[00:42:50] Grant Lee: oh yeah, this one, I love that.
[00:42:51] Grant Lee: I think it's gonna work great for your audience
[00:42:53] Grant Lee: but not trying to be super prescriptive.
[00:42:55] Grant Lee: And working with a ton of micro influencers,
[00:42:58] Grant Lee: people that don't have massive followings
[00:43:00] Grant Lee: but are committed to giving, going back to giving value
[00:43:03] Grant Lee: to your audience, like they're committed
[00:43:05] Grant Lee: to giving value to their audiences.
[00:43:06] Grant Lee: They want to be able to showcase tools
[00:43:08] Grant Lee: that actually they would use or they are using.
[00:43:11] And how do you do that in an authentic way?
[00:43:13] Grant Lee: Like you can't really fake that.
[00:43:14] Grant Lee: You really need to spend the time doing that.
[00:43:16] Grant Lee: And just like you would onboard a customer,
[00:43:19] you onboard an influencer the same way.
[00:43:20] Grant Lee: You want them to be an extension of your team.
[00:43:23] Grant Lee: And I think they can feel whether or not
[00:43:25] Grant Lee: you're willing to put in the work.
[00:43:27] Grant Lee: And if you're not, then they're just gonna treat it like a,
[00:43:29] Grant Lee: if you have any other project, ship it and be done with it.
[00:43:32] Grant Lee: If you invest in that relationship, you know,
[00:43:34] Grant Lee: guess what, they'll be back to actually post about you again.
[00:43:36] Grant Lee: And like you're all of a sudden having this sort of,
[00:43:39] Grant Lee: you know, this relationship actually can build over time.
[00:43:42] Grant Lee: I think that's really where the magic is.
[00:43:44] Grant Lee: Like too many people discount that initial piece.
[00:43:46] Grant Lee: This is awesome.
[00:43:47] Lenny Rachitsky: To be clear, influencer marketing,
[00:43:49] Lenny Rachitsky: essentially a person with a following answer,
[00:43:52] Lenny Rachitsky: TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn,
[00:43:53] Lenny Rachitsky: whatever gets paid in some way to promote your product.
[00:43:56] Lenny Rachitsky: That's how you describe it.
[00:43:57] Lenny Rachitsky: That's the simple way to understand influencer marketing.
[00:44:00] Grant Lee: Yeah, so that's definitely the simple way.
[00:44:01] Grant Lee: And I'd say, you know, there's definitely different,
[00:44:03] Grant Lee: you know, levels.
[00:44:04] Grant Lee: I think a lot of people think influencer marketing
[00:44:06] Grant Lee: and they'll think, you know, these big trendy creators,
[00:44:09] Grant Lee: people that have like a million followers, for instance.
[00:44:12] Grant Lee: And there are the ideas that, okay,
[00:44:14] Grant Lee: we're gonna carve out a really big budget.
[00:44:16] Grant Lee: We're gonna, you know, choose like five or six
[00:44:18] Grant Lee: that we feel like a really thick
[00:44:19] Grant Lee: that tastemakers in the space and put all of our money
[00:44:22] Grant Lee: into like just helping, you know,
[00:44:23] Grant Lee: having them talk about our products.
[00:44:26] Grant Lee: And I think usually this is kind of the wrong approach.
[00:44:29] Grant Lee: Because many of them, you know, they do have massive audiences.
[00:44:33] Grant Lee: And for you, you're basically, you're basically
[00:44:36] Grant Lee: give them a script to read and it immediately feels like an ad,
[00:44:40] Grant Lee: right? Like they don't feel, like that product
[00:44:42] Grant Lee: is not connected really to them in any way.
[00:44:44] Grant Lee: It's just something that they're, you know,
[00:44:46] Grant Lee: for this week, they happen to be working with you
[00:44:48] Grant Lee: and then they move on with their life.
[00:44:49] Grant Lee: And it never feels organic or authentic.
[00:44:53] And you wasted a ton of money doing so.
[00:44:55] Grant Lee: I think you're much better doing the hard thing,
[00:44:57] Grant Lee: which is hard to scale, but it's like finding
[00:44:59] Grant Lee: the thousands of micro influencers that have an audience
[00:45:02] Grant Lee: where your product maybe is actually useful.
[00:45:05] Grant Lee: And for instance, you know, for us, like early on
[00:45:07] Grant Lee: it'd be, you know, educators, people that for them,
[00:45:10] Grant Lee: part of their job is creating slides every day
[00:45:12] Grant Lee: because they need to engage their students.
[00:45:14] Grant Lee: And so like for them, you know, having a tool
[00:45:16] Grant Lee: that actually saved them a ton of time
[00:45:19] Grant Lee: was something they love talking about.
[00:45:20] Grant Lee: And if you can find some of these pockets,
[00:45:23] Grant Lee: we call them echo chambers,
[00:45:24] Grant Lee: where if you find a pocket like educators,
[00:45:27] teachers love telling other teachers about products
[00:45:29] Grant Lee: they love using.
[00:45:30] Grant Lee: During summer break, they all come together
[00:45:32] Grant Lee: and talk about, okay, what are the things
[00:45:33] Grant Lee: that we're going to actually improve, you know,
[00:45:35] Grant Lee: my job next school season.
[00:45:37] Grant Lee: And, you know, obviously during this AI wave,
[00:45:39] Grant Lee: a lot of those have been, okay, what are the AI tools?
[00:45:41] Grant Lee: I've just saved me a ton of time.
[00:45:43] Grant Lee: And so if you can start actually tapping
[00:45:44] Grant Lee: into these pockets of like echo chambers,
[00:45:46] Grant Lee: that's even better.
[00:45:47] Grant Lee: Like that, it doesn't have to be this flashy,
[00:45:49] Grant Lee: you know, like well-known influencer.
[00:45:52] Grant Lee: It's actually just this person that has an audience
[00:45:54] Grant Lee: that people really trust what they say.
[00:45:56] Grant Lee: And that's amazing.
[00:45:58] Grant Lee: That ends up becoming this sort of, you know,
[00:46:00] Grant Lee: wildfire that can spread real, really really fast.
[00:46:03] And what's like the dollar amount these folks get?
[00:46:04] Lenny Rachitsky: It's like a few hundred bucks, a few thousand bucks,
[00:46:06] Lenny Rachitsky: something like that.
[00:46:07] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, a few hundred to low thousands,
[00:46:09] Grant Lee: a single digit thousands.
[00:46:10] Grant Lee: What are, how do you find these folks?
[00:46:12] Lenny Rachitsky: Are there tools they use?
[00:46:13] Lenny Rachitsky: Is it just like a bunch of manual searching and looking?
[00:46:17] Yeah, in the very beginning it was all manual,
[00:46:20] Grant Lee: a lot of cold outreach.
[00:46:21] Grant Lee: And then we ended up finding
[00:46:23] Grant Lee: a couple of different things.
[00:46:24] Grant Lee: One is a platform, a YC company called First Collab.
[00:46:28] Grant Lee: That has been amazing.
[00:46:28] Grant Lee: They basically do all of the automated outbound for you.
[00:46:31] Grant Lee: Plus you can help them, you know,
[00:46:34] Grant Lee: actually create profiles or personas of different creators.
[00:46:37] Grant Lee: So like for instance, educators being one,
[00:46:39] Grant Lee: and then they'll go out and actually, you know,
[00:46:41] Grant Lee: based on that profile, find all the right creators for you.
[00:46:43] Grant Lee: So they've been amazing, really great to work with.
[00:46:45] Grant Lee: And then we've also found small agencies
[00:46:49] Grant Lee: to also help kind of augment that.
[00:46:50] Grant Lee: Like I look for, you know, agencies that are super young
[00:46:54] Grant Lee: and hungry, these are people that, you know,
[00:46:56] Grant Lee: are social, they're native to social media.
[00:46:59] Grant Lee: And so, you know, they really understand it.
[00:47:01] Grant Lee: And they can really be able to bring in creators that, you know,
[00:47:05] Grant Lee: are great to work with.
[00:47:06] Grant Lee: And I think part of it is like if you find creators
[00:47:08] Grant Lee: are great to work with everything else becomes easy.
[00:47:10] Grant Lee: So we've had a few, one is AKG media,
[00:47:13] Grant Lee: actually on the UK, and they've been fantastic
[00:47:16] Grant Lee: to work with as well.
[00:47:17] Grant Lee: So you kind of find a few different things.
[00:47:19] Grant Lee: Maybe their agencies or platforms
[00:47:20] Grant Lee: that can help you actually scale the signal.
[00:47:22] Grant Lee: And these, when they post, they're generally transparent
[00:47:25] Lenny Rachitsky: about this was a paid promotion, right?
[00:47:27] Lenny Rachitsky: They're not just pretending, I found this tool,
[00:47:29] Lenny Rachitsky: and I love it.
[00:47:31] Cool.
[00:47:31] Yeah, exactly right.
[00:47:32] Grant Lee: Okay.
[00:47:33] Lenny Rachitsky: And so how much impacted this lever of influencer marketing
[00:47:37] Lenny Rachitsky: have on your growth, say from 10 to 100?
[00:47:39] Lenny Rachitsky: Like is this the biggest lever of growth
[00:47:41] Lenny Rachitsky: other than just word of mouth?
[00:47:42] Lenny Rachitsky: People continue to share it.
[00:47:43] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah.
[00:47:44] Grant Lee: So word of mouth has definitely been the biggest.
[00:47:46] Grant Lee: So we look at kind of all kind of new subscriber growth.
[00:47:50] Grant Lee: Over 50% of this is word of mouth.
[00:47:52] Grant Lee: It's either people searching direct,
[00:47:54] Grant Lee: coming direct entering gamma.op,
[00:47:56] Grant Lee: or going through search and typing in gamma
[00:47:59] Grant Lee: like a branded keyword search,
[00:48:01] Grant Lee: where they're looking for gamma, they've heard about gamma.
[00:48:04] Grant Lee: But I think for us, social media
[00:48:06] Grant Lee: and influencers specifically has always been an amplifier.
[00:48:09] Grant Lee: So every time we invest in influencer marketing,
[00:48:13] Grant Lee: we actually see word of mouth increase even more.
[00:48:15] Grant Lee: And it's always like you can just see it.
[00:48:18] Grant Lee: Basically, anytime you spend a little bit of money,
[00:48:20] Grant Lee: you start seeing people come through influencer,
[00:48:22] Grant Lee: the word of mouth factor is actually one point,
[00:48:24] Grant Lee: we'll get another 1.5 additional users on top of that,
[00:48:27] Grant Lee: which has been really interesting to see.
[00:48:29] Grant Lee: And I think part of this is just recognizing that,
[00:48:32] and I think we kind of understand it,
[00:48:34] Grant Lee: but like with influencer marketing,
[00:48:35] Grant Lee: because it's so effective,
[00:48:37] Grant Lee: we all know, you know, dumb bars number,
[00:48:39] Grant Lee: which is, you know, have this number like 150 people,
[00:48:41] Grant Lee: you call kind of your network.
[00:48:43] Grant Lee: And your network, you trust more than the average stranger
[00:48:45] Grant Lee: down the street.
[00:48:46] Grant Lee: Like if they tell you something, you know,
[00:48:48] Grant Lee: they recommend something, there is a sort of halo effect.
[00:48:50] Grant Lee: Right? You learn to trust them.
[00:48:52] Grant Lee: There are a lot of these influencers.
[00:48:54] Grant Lee: The reason why they share so much about their lives
[00:48:57] Grant Lee: is because they want to be in your network.
[00:48:58] Grant Lee: They want you to feel super close.
[00:49:00] Grant Lee: And once you feel super close, you trust them to actually,
[00:49:04] Grant Lee: you know, share things are going to be useful.
[00:49:05] Grant Lee: And so when they recommend a tool,
[00:49:06] Grant Lee: there is this sort of halo effect,
[00:49:08] Grant Lee: where it doesn't feel like it's coming from a stranger,
[00:49:10] Grant Lee: it feels like it's coming from a friend.
[00:49:12] Grant Lee: And that's where every time we've spent money there,
[00:49:14] Grant Lee: you actually see this amplification.
[00:49:16] Grant Lee: Like, okay, that's kind of interesting.
[00:49:17] Grant Lee: You wouldn't necessarily expect that,
[00:49:19] Grant Lee: but for us, it's been this sort of amplifier
[00:49:21] Grant Lee: from, yeah, the very beginning.
[00:49:24] This is so fun to hear about.
[00:49:25] Lenny Rachitsky: I've not heard this level of detail
[00:49:26] Lenny Rachitsky: on how influencer marketing works
[00:49:28] Lenny Rachitsky: and how to make it work.
[00:49:29] A few more questions here.
[00:49:31] Lenny Rachitsky: So you said there's maybe a few thousand people
[00:49:32] Lenny Rachitsky: you ended up working with, roughly influencers.
[00:49:35] Lenny Rachitsky: Over the course of, yeah, like a year,
[00:49:37] Grant Lee: it wasn't all in the same time.
[00:49:38] Grant Lee: It was like, you know, you find basically the beginning,
[00:49:40] Grant Lee: you do in the very, very beginning,
[00:49:42] Grant Lee: you know, the small budget was like, you know,
[00:49:43] Grant Lee: 20 creators a month.
[00:49:45] And then you start increasing that to like 50, then 100.
[00:49:48] Grant Lee: And then, you know, we're still not,
[00:49:50] Grant Lee: we're not definitely not fully scaled at this point,
[00:49:52] Grant Lee: but I could easily see a point where, you know,
[00:49:53] Grant Lee: you're working with many, many creators every single month.
[00:49:56] Grant Lee: And that gives you a chance to actually test
[00:49:58] Grant Lee: a variety of, you know, again, content hooks,
[00:50:00] Grant Lee: ways to talk about the product, value props.
[00:50:03] Grant Lee: Amazing.
[00:50:04] Lenny Rachitsky: And you said the key here is you spend time with every one
[00:50:07] Lenny Rachitsky: of these creators influencers early on
[00:50:10] Lenny Rachitsky: to help make sure they understand what you're doing.
[00:50:13] Lenny Rachitsky: I get excited about it.
[00:50:14] Lenny Rachitsky: Isn't just like a thing you outsource.
[00:50:16] Lenny Rachitsky: I think there's a lot of value there.
[00:50:17] Grant Lee: It's hard to, again, hard to quantify.
[00:50:19] Grant Lee: And most creators feel like the,
[00:50:22] Grant Lee: most founders probably feel like they're too busy
[00:50:24] Grant Lee: to allocate that time.
[00:50:26] But I think it was a good investment
[00:50:27] Grant Lee: because going back to, you want them to feel
[00:50:29] Grant Lee: like an extension of your team.
[00:50:31] They're not going to feel like an extension of your team.
[00:50:33] Grant Lee: If, if one, they've never met you.
[00:50:34] Grant Lee: And two, you've never even told them really
[00:50:37] Grant Lee: how the product works.
[00:50:38] Grant Lee: They're forced to kind of go to your website
[00:50:39] Grant Lee: to figure it all out.
[00:50:40] Grant Lee: Those are going to be, you know,
[00:50:42] Grant Lee: not a whole lot of love that they're feeling
[00:50:45] Grant Lee: from, from the outset.
[00:50:46] Grant Lee: So I'm hearing is quality over quantity,
[00:50:49] Lenny Rachitsky: especially when you're getting started.
[00:50:51] Lenny Rachitsky: And then there's this other piece of niche,
[00:50:52] Lenny Rachitsky: which I think is very counterintuitive
[00:50:54] Lenny Rachitsky: instead of going to large influencers
[00:50:57] Lenny Rachitsky: or the huge audience.
[00:50:57] Lenny Rachitsky: It's good if folks that are small.
[00:50:59] Lenny Rachitsky: What's like an audience size roughly
[00:51:01] Lenny Rachitsky: that you think is ideal for this sort of,
[00:51:03] Lenny Rachitsky: what niche just means?
[00:51:05] Lenny Rachitsky: Honestly, I don't think there's a minimum
[00:51:06] Grant Lee: because even with platforms like TikTok,
[00:51:09] Grant Lee: they oftentimes are giving you credit
[00:51:11] Grant Lee: for a brand new account.
[00:51:12] Grant Lee: They want to help amplify that new account
[00:51:14] Grant Lee: because, you know, obviously, you know,
[00:51:16] Grant Lee: if they're thinking from a creator perspective,
[00:51:18] Grant Lee: you know, if that new creator feels like,
[00:51:20] Grant Lee: oh, coming to TikTok is like a massive win for me,
[00:51:23] Grant Lee: they're going to be more invested in it.
[00:51:25] Grant Lee: And so there really is in the minimum.
[00:51:27] Grant Lee: A lot of these platforms are trying to shift
[00:51:28] Grant Lee: to kind of the same thing
[00:51:30] Grant Lee: where they really reward new creators on the platform.
[00:51:33] Grant Lee: And so you could have a small audience,
[00:51:35] Grant Lee: it doesn't really matter.
[00:51:36] Grant Lee: You can have 10,000 followers, that's also good.
[00:51:38] Grant Lee: I think as long as the content feels, you know,
[00:51:40] Grant Lee: again, engaging, authentic to that,
[00:51:42] Grant Lee: to the people you're talking to,
[00:51:44] Grant Lee: I think that's a really good chance of actually taking off.
[00:51:46] That's such a good point when we take talk
[00:51:47] Lenny Rachitsky: where it's not follower related.
[00:51:49] Lenny Rachitsky: It's if it's useful and people find it clickable,
[00:51:53] Lenny Rachitsky: whatever likeable, viewable,
[00:51:55] Lenny Rachitsky: it'll algorithm will spread it to a lot of people.
[00:51:58] Lenny Rachitsky: Such a good point.
[00:52:00] Okay, there's a couple more points you made in the tweet
[00:52:01] Lenny Rachitsky: that I want to make sure we highlight.
[00:52:02] Lenny Rachitsky: So one is you made this point that 90% of your reach
[00:52:05] Lenny Rachitsky: in influencer marketing comes from less than 10% of people.
[00:52:09] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there anything there that you think is important
[00:52:10] Lenny Rachitsky: for people to hear?
[00:52:11] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, I mean, this just goes back to,
[00:52:13] Grant Lee: it's hard to know where that 10% is going to come from.
[00:52:16] Grant Lee: So you've got to just have to cast the super wide net, right?
[00:52:18] Grant Lee: You can sort of, I think, try to again,
[00:52:22] Grant Lee: trick yourself into thinking your great-up picking creators
[00:52:24] Grant Lee: or your great at telling them how to like post about your stuff.
[00:52:27] Grant Lee: Whether reality is like, even for me,
[00:52:29] Grant Lee: I could never guess.
[00:52:30] Grant Lee: Like I kind of had some idea,
[00:52:32] Grant Lee: but I just had to make sure that I was meeting enough creators
[00:52:35] Grant Lee: broadly such that when you meet enough, they're all posting.
[00:52:38] Grant Lee: There's some pocket that end up just taking off.
[00:52:40] Grant Lee: And I was not a good predictor of that.
[00:52:43] Grant Lee: I was not smart enough to actually know
[00:52:44] Grant Lee: which ones to take off.
[00:52:45] Grant Lee: I just knew that we had to play this sort of numbers game
[00:52:48] Grant Lee: to make it work.
[00:52:49] So when your tips here is, is people fail often in this
[00:52:52] Lenny Rachitsky: because they start too small
[00:52:53] Lenny Rachitsky: or they're by just a little too small?
[00:52:55] Lenny Rachitsky: You recommend 10 to 20,000 a month over six months
[00:53:00] Lenny Rachitsky: and just trying this.
[00:53:00] Lenny Rachitsky: It sounds like you were doing like 20 to 30 creators a month.
[00:53:04] Lenny Rachitsky: Is that the right framework for how to just start this thing
[00:53:06] Lenny Rachitsky: and explore?
[00:53:07] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, totally.
[00:53:08] Grant Lee: And I'd say it's not just that the budget's too small.
[00:53:10] Grant Lee: It would be that they put all their eggs in one basket.
[00:53:12] Grant Lee: So you can also easily blow that 20k on just one bigger influencer.
[00:53:17] Grant Lee: And then be like, oh, that didn't work.
[00:53:18] Grant Lee: So I'm going to try it again.
[00:53:19] Grant Lee: That didn't work.
[00:53:20] Grant Lee: I give up.
[00:53:21] And I think rather than doing that,
[00:53:22] Grant Lee: you should be like, OK, that 20k,
[00:53:24] Grant Lee: I could actually probably work with 40 different influencers
[00:53:28] Grant Lee: and see what actually works.
[00:53:29] Grant Lee: And well, across the 40, I'm going to try to find a variety
[00:53:32] Grant Lee: of personas, a variety of use cases,
[00:53:35] Grant Lee: spend a lot of time with them, and then actually see
[00:53:37] Grant Lee: what's working, what's not.
[00:53:39] Grant Lee: And then next month, take those learnings and double down.
[00:53:42] Grant Lee: If educators are working, go with educators.
[00:53:45] Grant Lee: If consultants are working, go with consultant,
[00:53:47] Grant Lee: fine board consultants, because they're going to be more there.
[00:53:49] Grant Lee: I think that's where the app, putting all your eggs in one basket
[00:53:51] Grant Lee: is just the surest way to fail, because you're going to miss a ton.
[00:53:55] Grant Lee: And it's going to take you way too long to learn.
[00:53:57] Grant Lee: And you're going to come to the conclusion
[00:53:58] Grant Lee: that it's a waste of time.
[00:54:00] I feel like this whole podcast conversation
[00:54:02] Lenny Rachitsky: could be just about this one lever, so much I want to be talking about.
[00:54:05] Lenny Rachitsky: But there's more questions here, because this is so useful and interesting.
[00:54:08] Lenny Rachitsky: You have this line in your tweet about how
[00:54:09] Lenny Rachitsky: a reality is not an accident.
[00:54:12] Lenny Rachitsky: And at this approach is how you figure out what actually works.
[00:54:15] Lenny Rachitsky: And then once you do that, then you start leading into that messaging.
[00:54:19] Lenny Rachitsky: Talk about that.
[00:54:20] Lenny Rachitsky: This goes back to, obviously, if you're testing a bunch,
[00:54:23] Grant Lee: you'll finally find that sort of post or set a post
[00:54:26] Grant Lee: to actually go viral.
[00:54:28] Grant Lee: Going back to just the fundamentals,
[00:54:30] Grant Lee: make it easy for your influencers to be able to tell your story in their voice.
[00:54:34] Grant Lee: One thing we did, we open sourced our basic entire brand.
[00:54:38] Grant Lee: We have brand.gamma.app, which is everything about our brand, our voice and tone,
[00:54:42] Grant Lee: our art direction, what we use in mid-journey to create
[00:54:45] Grant Lee: the sort of art direction that we have so that our creator can do the same.
[00:54:49] Grant Lee: And they can actually just copy all of that so that they don't have to reinvent
[00:54:53] Grant Lee: the wheel every time they're trying to post about gamma, the have all of that.
[00:54:56] Grant Lee: And I think that going back to this notion of just make a dead simple
[00:55:00] Grant Lee: for them, remove friction.
[00:55:01] Grant Lee: They already have enough to, like, on their plate that to figure out,
[00:55:04] Grant Lee: don't make it any harder than it is.
[00:55:06] Grant Lee: And if you remove friction, then it's like, oh, you get into this rhythm of adding
[00:55:10] Grant Lee: creators is easy, having them post as crazy, easy, reviewing what's working,
[00:55:14] Grant Lee: what's not as easy.
[00:55:15] Grant Lee: And if you're able to do that relentlessly over many, many months,
[00:55:18] Grant Lee: then all of a sudden, like, hitting the sort of viral post is easy,
[00:55:21] Grant Lee: because you're going to have enough at bats there, where some are going to,
[00:55:24] Grant Lee: you know, some are actually going to pop off.
[00:55:26] Grant Lee: But you can get there after you've, like, done all the hard work before that
[00:55:31] Grant Lee: to make, you know, kind of remove friction from the process and feeling like
[00:55:35] Grant Lee: it's almost like a well-oiled machine at that point.
[00:55:38] Is there a platform you find most helpful for the stuff you guys are doing?
[00:55:41] Lenny Rachitsky: Is it like TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, something else?
[00:55:45] Grant Lee: Yeah, I mean, this is one where, you know, for us, we cast a pretty wide net too,
[00:55:48] Grant Lee: but it's very clear, you know, LinkedIn, the conversion rates are just substantially higher.
[00:55:54] Grant Lee: They're 4x, maybe 5x higher than other platforms.
[00:55:58] Grant Lee: And I think a lot of people are probably still sleeping on LinkedIn, frankly.
[00:56:01] Grant Lee: And so it's one where, you know, some of the influencers there are creators
[00:56:05] Grant Lee: that can be a little bit more costly, but if you can be highly, you know,
[00:56:08] Grant Lee: eventually be more targeted knowing that, hey, this type of creator is pretty impactful
[00:56:13] Grant Lee: for, you know, our product, then working with them, it's just like, oh, that's great.
[00:56:17] Grant Lee: Like, the conversion rates are just so strong.
[00:56:20] Grant Lee: And it really feels like we're, like, just getting started there.
[00:56:22] Grant Lee: So, you know, in the beginning, you're not sure.
[00:56:24] Grant Lee: It's always helpful to cast a pretty wide net and then, you know,
[00:56:26] Grant Lee: similar to sort of just the influencer strategy, like test and iterate.
[00:56:30] Grant Lee: You'll figure out many of these things will fall the power, a power loss.
[00:56:33] Grant Lee: It was like, you know, one or two channels are going to be the most important for you.
[00:56:37] For instance, Twitter for us hasn't been that impactful.
[00:56:39] Grant Lee: And I think for tools like Notion, they've been really, really impactful.
[00:56:42] Grant Lee: You're not going to really know.
[00:56:43] Grant Lee: And so just test and then double down on the ones that really move the needle for your product.
[00:56:48] I think that many people are sitting now or like, wait, LinkedIn post or sponsored sometimes.
[00:56:51] Lenny Rachitsky: I didn't know that.
[00:56:53] Lenny Rachitsky: What's like, how do you know if it's a sponsored post?
[00:56:54] Lenny Rachitsky: Is it like a hashtag sponsored or something like that?
[00:56:56] Lenny Rachitsky: How do they communicate this?
[00:56:57] Lenny Rachitsky: Usually they'll say, you know, they're a partner or, you know,
[00:57:00] Grant Lee: basically, it is sponsored in some form or, you know, they'll, the hashtag, you know,
[00:57:05] Grant Lee: ad or, you know, something along those lines.
[00:57:08] Grant Lee: So that's probably the way you'll, you'll see it the most.
[00:57:11] Grant Lee: Cool. By the way, I don't do this sort of stuff.
[00:57:13] Lenny Rachitsky: If you ever see me on LinkedIn, I'm not doing any paid stuff.
[00:57:16] Lenny Rachitsky: It's just some people know.
[00:57:17] Lenny Rachitsky: And I don't plan to do that.
[00:57:19] This episode is brought to you by Miro.
[00:57:21] Lenny Rachitsky: Every day new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs,
[00:57:25] Lenny Rachitsky: creating a lot of anxiety and fear.
[00:57:27] Lenny Rachitsky: But a recent survey for Miro tells a different story.
[00:57:30] Lenny Rachitsky: 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role.
[00:57:34] Lenny Rachitsky: But over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it.

[00:58:30] Let's come back to this brand point.
[00:58:32] Lenny Rachitsky: So one of your big lessons is invest in brand before you go heavy into hit ads and performance
[00:58:38] Lenny Rachitsky: marketing.
[00:58:39] Lenny Rachitsky: I imagine you do some ads at this point in Facebook and Google and things like that.
[00:58:42] Grant Lee: Yeah, we run ads, performance marketing.
[00:58:45] Grant Lee: I think there's this stigma that brand marketing and performance marketing are at odds with
[00:58:52] Grant Lee: each other.
[00:58:53] I very much follow the thought that brand marketing is performance marketing.
[00:59:00] Grant Lee: Everything is some form of performance marketing.
[00:59:02] Grant Lee: It just might not be as attributable.
[00:59:04] Grant Lee: So the ability to actually map back to every single dollar spent is a little bit harder,
[00:59:09] Grant Lee: but it doesn't mean that it's not impactful.
[00:59:12] Grant Lee: I think as a company scale, you have to invest in both.
[00:59:15] Grant Lee: Ideally, they work really, really well together.
[00:59:17] Grant Lee: The more you invest in brand marketing, it strengthens your performance marketing.
[00:59:21] Grant Lee: This goes back to having enough creative to even test.
[00:59:24] Grant Lee: If you're too limited in scope and you don't have a brand, you feel like you can actually amplify.
[00:59:29] Grant Lee: You're handicapping your ability to actually have a good performance marketing program.
[00:59:32] Grant Lee: I love that heuristic of how do you know if you are under invested in brand is if you're
[00:59:38] Lenny Rachitsky: limited in the number of ideas you can try in performance marketing.
[00:59:43] Lenny Rachitsky: Is your design system just like is everyone having to redesign things from scratch and
[00:59:48] Lenny Rachitsky: come up with all these frameworks every time they run an ad?
[00:59:52] Grant Lee: Exactly.
[00:59:53] Grant Lee: Yeah.
[00:59:54] Grant Lee: Basically, you have a feeling for if I were to scale this up to a thousand pieces of creative,
[00:59:58] Grant Lee: would it still feel cohesive or is it all over the place?
[01:00:01] Grant Lee: It feels like it's all over the place and you have to go back to the drawing board.
[01:00:04] Grant Lee: You said when you talked about the rebrand that it took a lot longer than you expected,
[01:00:08] Lenny Rachitsky: that it was more expensive than you expected.
[01:00:09] Lenny Rachitsky: That's like the fear I think everyone has when they hear this, like, oh, I don't know
[01:00:12] Lenny Rachitsky: if that's a rebrand.
[01:00:15] I also imagine because your product is so visual that it makes more sense to invest there
[01:00:20] Lenny Rachitsky: and to spend the time and money for the typical founder.
[01:00:24] Lenny Rachitsky: Do you have any just set up thoughts of just like, here's when it makes sense.
[01:00:27] Lenny Rachitsky: Here's a sign you really need to invest here, heavily versus like, and it'll probably
[01:00:31] Lenny Rachitsky: be all right.
[01:00:32] Lenny Rachitsky: I mean, I do think it's probably more geared to anything that's a little bit more pro-stumer
[01:00:37] Grant Lee: or consumer because so much of your product, you're trying to create this feeling for a user.
[01:00:44] Grant Lee: What are they experiencing?
[01:00:46] Grant Lee: The experience happens way before they even drop into your product.
[01:00:49] Grant Lee: It might be they see an ad or they see a billboard or they see something, it's like, okay,
[01:00:54] Grant Lee: that piqued my interest a little bit.
[01:00:56] Grant Lee: You need some sort of like symmetric messaging and that they see that there's some symmetry
[01:01:00] Grant Lee: and that they see that ad, then they drop into the product and land on your website.
[01:01:05] Grant Lee: It feels cohesive and it feels like, okay, this is interesting.
[01:01:08] Grant Lee: I'm going to go all the way through to sign up and then maybe actually start using the
[01:01:11] Grant Lee: product.
[01:01:12] That's a little bit different when it's like a B2B product or where there isn't as much
[01:01:17] Grant Lee: for lines on that initial moment.
[01:01:19] Grant Lee: They might just hear about it through colleague and then sign up for it and then go through
[01:01:23] Grant Lee: a huge procurement process.
[01:01:26] Grant Lee: It's like, okay, maybe it matters, but probably not so much as like for a product where the
[01:01:31] Grant Lee: brand can have so many different touch points.
[01:01:33] I want to talk about some kind of broader things that have worked to help you grow.
[01:01:37] Lenny Rachitsky: But before we do that, I just want to visualize the pie chart of how Gamark rose, say, post
[01:01:42] Lenny Rachitsky: 10 million ARR.
[01:01:44] Lenny Rachitsky: If I have it correctly in my head, it's over 50% just word of mouth, organic people sharing
[01:01:49] Lenny Rachitsky: it, doing presentations for each other, oh, it's gamma, just go check it out.
[01:01:53] Then it feels like the second biggest bucket is influencer marketing, social stuff.
[01:01:59] Lenny Rachitsky: Then is the third performance slash paid marketing?
[01:02:02] Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:04] Cool.
[01:02:05] Lenny Rachitsky: On the last piece, is there anything else there for people that are starting to explore
[01:02:09] Lenny Rachitsky: performance marketing, essentially Facebook ads, Google ads, all these other platforms?
[01:02:13] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there anything else that you think might be helpful for people to hear or learn just
[01:02:17] Lenny Rachitsky: to get started down this road?
[01:02:18] Lenny Rachitsky: I would just have two recommendations.
[01:02:21] Grant Lee: Then going back to my initial piece of advice, which is don't invest until you have word
[01:02:25] Grant Lee: of mouth.
[01:02:27] Grant Lee: Don't fool yourself into thinking that you'll solve other problems by just starting to ramp
[01:02:30] Grant Lee: up a performance marketing program.
[01:02:32] Grant Lee: Just get the word of mouthpiece first so that you have, you're coming into this program
[01:02:36] Grant Lee: with some tailwinds and then start ramping it up.
[01:02:40] The second piece is like set some constraints.
[01:02:43] Grant Lee: You don't want your product to be at a point where more than 50% of your acquisitions are
[01:02:48] Grant Lee: coming through paid acquisition.
[01:02:50] Grant Lee: I think if that is happening, your core growth engine is broken and feeds right back to
[01:02:56] Grant Lee: point number one, which is if your core growth engine is broken, you just have this leaky
[01:03:02] Grant Lee: bucket.
[01:03:03] Grant Lee: You're trying to spend so much money building top of the funnel.
[01:03:06] Grant Lee: People are not making it all the way through.
[01:03:08] Something else should be fixed before you really try to dial it up and it doesn't mean like
[01:03:12] Grant Lee: you don't spend a little bit of money but just don't dial it up until you feel like
[01:03:15] Grant Lee: your core growth engine is actually working.
[01:03:17] You said the first point about wait until you have word of mouth before investing in
[01:03:22] Lenny Rachitsky: performance marketing.
[01:03:23] Lenny Rachitsky: Is that essentially like a large chunk of your growth should be coming from word of mouth,
[01:03:27] Lenny Rachitsky: direct, organic?
[01:03:28] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah.
[01:03:29] For us, even at scale, again, going back to more than 50% of new sign ups still come
[01:03:34] Grant Lee: through word of mouth.
[01:03:36] Grant Lee: For us as a sign, look, okay, something is still working.
[01:03:39] Grant Lee: People are using the product telling other people and you want that feeling before you
[01:03:43] Grant Lee: really start dialing anything else out.
[01:03:44] Grant Lee: Is there like a percentage that you think is helpful for people to think about just
[01:03:47] Lenny Rachitsky: like 25% or more, something like that of just word of mouth for you to feel like, okay,
[01:03:53] Lenny Rachitsky: we actually have organic growth as a major growth engine.
[01:03:55] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah.
[01:03:56] Grant Lee: I think this comes back to maybe just how aggressive you want to be.
[01:03:59] Grant Lee: I think just rough, you know, erasic as the more the better.
[01:04:03] Grant Lee: If it's over 50%, I think that's great.
[01:04:05] Grant Lee: If it's approaching that good and just going back to like don't fool yourself into thinking
[01:04:10] Grant Lee: just ads is going to be the way you grow because you can do that but everything else becomes
[01:04:15] Grant Lee: harder and harder.
[01:04:16] Grant Lee: If you rely on paid acquisition to be the main growth engine, you should be prepared for
[01:04:21] Grant Lee: things like CAC, like customer acquisition costs to keep going up.
[01:04:25] Grant Lee: And the more you're trying to reach like a new audience, it gets more and more expensive.
[01:04:29] Grant Lee: So don't assume it's going to be flat.
[01:04:31] Grant Lee: And then all of a sudden you're running on this treadmill that's actually running faster
[01:04:33] Grant Lee: and faster.
[01:04:35] Grant Lee: And so that's where it's easy to get hooked on that early on when you're just investing
[01:04:40] Grant Lee: a small amount of money and then it's almost impossible to get off that treadmill when
[01:04:43] Grant Lee: you're too far into it.
[01:04:45] Grant Lee: Anticipate that and give yourself a better chance at actually be able to sustain that
[01:04:49] Grant Lee: growth long term.
[01:04:50] Lenny Rachitsky: Mm.
[01:04:51] Lenny Rachitsky: Important advice.
[01:04:52] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay.
[01:04:53] Lenny Rachitsky: There's a couple more elements you've shared that were key to Gamma's growth.
[01:04:57] Lenny Rachitsky: One is sharing prototypes with users before you ship.
[01:05:01] Lenny Rachitsky: What does that look like?
[01:05:02] Lenny Rachitsky: What does that mean?
[01:05:03] Lenny Rachitsky: Why is that so powerful?
[01:05:04] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah.
[01:05:05] Grant Lee: I mean this for us was a huge unlock.
[01:05:07] Grant Lee: You know, going back to like early days when you're just trying to get your product into
[01:05:10] Grant Lee: anybody's hands.
[01:05:11] Grant Lee: You're good into your friends trying to use it.
[01:05:14] Grant Lee: And again, they're going to lie to you, tell you how great it is and then never come back
[01:05:17] Grant Lee: to using the product.
[01:05:19] Grant Lee: I think what you want to be able to do, you know, the ideal situation is you recruit a
[01:05:23] Grant Lee: bunch of people that could, you know, they're legitimately good prospective users or customers
[01:05:28] Grant Lee: of your product, but have zero skin in the game.
[01:05:32] Grant Lee: They do not care at all whether or not your product succeeds.
[01:05:35] Grant Lee: They're just in it to test it.
[01:05:37] Grant Lee: And you, you know, for us, it was like people to have made slide decks or make slide decks
[01:05:41] Grant Lee: regularly.
[01:05:42] Grant Lee: Let's drop them into Gamma, give them very little context.
[01:05:44] Grant Lee: We just tell you, hey, this is an alternative to PowerPoint.
[01:05:47] Grant Lee: Go ahead and try it.
[01:05:48] And then as you're going through the onboarding flow and testing the product, just tell
[01:05:51] Grant Lee: us everything that's going on in your head.
[01:05:54] Grant Lee: Like describe what you're seeing.
[01:05:56] Grant Lee: Tell us what you're trying to do.
[01:05:58] Grant Lee: We'll give you maybe a few different tasks.
[01:06:00] Grant Lee: Like, oh, create, you know, create a piece of content.
[01:06:03] Grant Lee: When you watch them do that and also hear what they're saying, you just immediately feel
[01:06:08] Grant Lee: the pain.
[01:06:10] Like all the places they're struggling and all the places they're so confused by like
[01:06:15] Grant Lee: what they're seeing.
[01:06:17] Grant Lee: And you sort of then can internalize that pain and say, okay, we're going back and we
[01:06:20] Grant Lee: have to fix this.
[01:06:21] Grant Lee: This is like not usable.
[01:06:22] Grant Lee: Like, we, you know, we oftentimes are dog fooding everything.
[01:06:25] Grant Lee: And so you can get to the point where you're so familiar with your own product.
[01:06:28] Grant Lee: Everything kind of feels kind of easy and you know where things are.
[01:06:31] Grant Lee: But when you start actually hearing other people describe their usage of the product,
[01:06:35] Grant Lee: that's like a gift.
[01:06:36] Grant Lee: Like you're all of a sudden you're like, okay, now I know we're to actually spend the
[01:06:39] Grant Lee: time.
[01:06:40] Grant Lee: People aren't even getting to the third screen.
[01:06:41] Grant Lee: They're stuck on the first screen because they can't even find the button that we think
[01:06:45] Grant Lee: is like so dead obvious.
[01:06:46] Grant Lee: And so let's go back and actually re-engineer, re-architect that piece of it.
[01:06:50] And we've done that for everything.
[01:06:52] Grant Lee: Landing pages, onboarding experience, new feature launches, you know, export, sharing,
[01:06:57] Grant Lee: every single piece of that such that, you know, we can actually see where things are
[01:07:01] Grant Lee: working or not.
[01:07:02] Grant Lee: And then every time we'll learn something that's kind of painful, but obviously we need
[01:07:06] Grant Lee: to fix and we go back and fix it.
[01:07:08] How do you scale the sort of thing?
[01:07:09] Lenny Rachitsky: How do you run every new big idea and you feature change by people?
[01:07:14] Lenny Rachitsky: Do you have like closed beta, grew, do you use some platform?
[01:07:18] Lenny Rachitsky: How do you actually do this?
[01:07:19] Lenny Rachitsky: There's a couple great platforms.
[01:07:20] Grant Lee: So voice panel, which is also YC company, full disclosure, angel investor.
[01:07:26] Grant Lee: And then there's also platforms like user testing that really help you source and find
[01:07:32] Grant Lee: these people that fit again, that persona or profile you're looking for.
[01:07:36] Grant Lee: So in our case, like people that are in a specific job function or create decks regularly.
[01:07:41] Grant Lee: And so you can use those platforms to really scale up these programs pretty fast.
[01:07:45] Grant Lee: And then once your team knows how to use those platforms, we would have an idea in the
[01:07:49] Grant Lee: morning and in the afternoon, we're already running a pretty full-scale experiment or
[01:07:54] Grant Lee: like a research study.
[01:07:56] Grant Lee: And by the evening or by the next day, we can actually go through all of it together.
[01:08:00] Grant Lee: So it's pretty fast once you have it set up.
[01:08:02] Grant Lee: It's more about like how do you get the program onboarded the right way?
[01:08:06] Grant Lee: I think the other sort of mechanism we did early on was once we had some repeat users,
[01:08:11] we created a sort of a program for our power users.
[01:08:14] Grant Lee: We called it the Gambaster program, which is we put them to a separate Slack workspace.
[01:08:21] Grant Lee: That was a place for us to kind of share very, very early prototypes, like wireframe,
[01:08:25] Grant Lee: rireframe, sometimes there are functional prototypes and get them to get some initial feedback
[01:08:30] Grant Lee: as well.
[01:08:31] Grant Lee: This definitely helps with more sort of later stage or like features or things that aren't
[01:08:36] Grant Lee: going to be necessarily important with support of onboarding.
[01:08:39] Grant Lee: But like once you understand GAMMA, like, oh, how do you share it, for instance?
[01:08:42] Grant Lee: This was a great way to start testing some of that because they already understand GAMMA,
[01:08:45] Grant Lee: but now you're adding net new functionality.
[01:08:47] Grant Lee: And then we can also watch them struggle and hear how they're struggling with the product.
[01:08:51] Grant Lee: So that was been a great way, just to have a separate Slack workspace.
[01:08:54] Grant Lee: Anytime we're thinking about something, they're the first to hear about it, give us some
[01:08:57] Grant Lee: early indication if we're on the right track or not.
[01:09:00] I love this workflow that you shared.
[01:09:01] Lenny Rachitsky: You have an idea in the morning, you built a prototype, do you build it with like AI
[01:09:07] Lenny Rachitsky: prototype tools like cursor, lovable something like that?
[01:09:11] Yeah, yeah, that or it could be, yeah, I mean, we're lucky a lot of our designers also
[01:09:16] Grant Lee: know how to code.
[01:09:17] Grant Lee: So you're going to do it for the recent tools, like, you know, kind of come up with some sort
[01:09:19] Grant Lee: of functional prototype and then and then be able to ship that so people can start playing
[01:09:23] Grant Lee: with it.
[01:09:24] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, so you you have an idea in the morning, you build a prototype using various tools,
[01:09:30] Lenny Rachitsky: you buy the end of the day, you are getting feedback from real people using one of these
[01:09:34] Lenny Rachitsky: platforms, voice panel or user testing.
[01:09:37] Lenny Rachitsky: And just like that loop saves you, I imagine potentially months of just building the thing
[01:09:42] Lenny Rachitsky: nobody wants and shipping it, launching it and then just failing totally.
[01:09:46] Yeah, I mean, I think this is even more probably helpful for, you know, certainly a lot of
[01:09:51] Grant Lee: folks that are starting to do much with vibe coded apps, like, yeah, that's great.
[01:09:55] Grant Lee: Like you've lowered the, you know, amount of time to get something out there.
[01:09:58] Grant Lee: Now prove that it's useful to like some sort of users.
[01:10:01] Grant Lee: And this should be again, like every day, every week, you should be able to go through
[01:10:04] Grant Lee: a ton of these and and then build on the things that seem to be working.
[01:10:08] Grant Lee: I feel like that's like, it's almost like a way to speed run a lot of that early sort
[01:10:13] Grant Lee: of your idea maze.
[01:10:14] Grant Lee: You think you have something that could kind of work.
[01:10:16] Grant Lee: How do you actually break through so that, you know, people are actually finding value
[01:10:19] Grant Lee: in what you're building?
[01:10:20] Grant Lee: Yeah, I love it because so many people hear this idea of just like run your stuff by users
[01:10:25] Lenny Rachitsky: before you ship, you know, do the user research.
[01:10:27] Lenny Rachitsky: It sounds so hard and heavy lift.
[01:10:30] Lenny Rachitsky: E and in the way you're describing it is like very automated, very, very quick to do.
[01:10:36] Lenny Rachitsky: You don't have to go think about finding random people to the coffee shop.
[01:10:39] Lenny Rachitsky: It's just like these platforms exist where you can go plug in your thing, get feedback
[01:10:43] Lenny Rachitsky: by the end of the day.
[01:10:44] Totally.
[01:10:45] Grant Lee: Yeah.
[01:10:46] Grant Lee: And that helps you just move way faster.
[01:10:48] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there a feature that you were super excited about that you built and ran through this
[01:10:51] Lenny Rachitsky: and just like, okay, that was a huge failure?
[01:10:53] Lenny Rachitsky: I don't think any of the ones where we, you know, we always try to kind of chunk it down.
[01:10:59] Grant Lee: So like none of the things we're testing earlier on are like these massive features.
[01:11:02] Grant Lee: They're always like an inception or like a starting point of like this could be something
[01:11:06] Grant Lee: interesting.
[01:11:07] Grant Lee: And then we take that initial learning and actually then build the product around it.
[01:11:10] Grant Lee: It's never like, oh, we spent like four months working on this thing.
[01:11:13] Grant Lee: Let's see if anybody actually wants it.
[01:11:15] It's almost like we always start super early and a bunch of ideas die right away, but
[01:11:18] Grant Lee: there's still pretty small ideas.
[01:11:20] Grant Lee: And then the ones that kind of passed initial test, you start building towards something
[01:11:23] Grant Lee: that could be hopefully more game changing or much more value add.
[01:11:27] Grant Lee: And by the time you're actually shipping, like you've gone through, you know, 10 different
[01:11:30] layers of actually testing and iteration before it actually sees the light of day.
[01:11:34] Grant Lee: It's really interesting about you and the way you company operates.
[01:11:36] Lenny Rachitsky: You guys are optimizally people say you're very versed in experimentation.
[01:11:42] Lenny Rachitsky: A lot of people talk about a be testing experimentation is something that doesn't make sense for a start-up
[01:11:47] Lenny Rachitsky: because the scale is so low.
[01:11:49] Lenny Rachitsky: What I'm hearing here and I know this is something you talk about is just the there is actually
[01:11:53] Lenny Rachitsky: a lot of way to a lot of ways to think experimentally even in the early stages.
[01:11:57] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there something more there you think is important for people to hear?
[01:12:01] Yeah, I mean, I really think it's more, you know, the mindset you go into to almost any
[01:12:06] Grant Lee: problem or opportunity is, you know, the saying of, you know, strong opinions, weekly held.
[01:12:11] Grant Lee: I think it's totally fine to have like some of these assumptions or like hypotheses going
[01:12:14] Grant Lee: into a lot of these things.
[01:12:16] Grant Lee: But you should always know that there's a way to start trying to validate some of this.
[01:12:19] Grant Lee: You know, as a founder, you're always trying to build conviction.
[01:12:23] Grant Lee: And so you build conviction by, you know, not, you know, having it all live in your head
[01:12:26] Grant Lee: but getting it out there and sort of testing this with users, prospect customers, and starting
[01:12:31] Grant Lee: to see like what are the things that actually feel right.
[01:12:35] Grant Lee: And sometimes you have enough data to be statistically significant.
[01:12:38] Grant Lee: Sometimes it's more of a, hey, we at least were able to gut check this a little bit and
[01:12:41] Grant Lee: get some qualitative feedback.
[01:12:42] Grant Lee: I think that's still valuable.
[01:12:43] Grant Lee: It shouldn't be this sort of like all or nothing like our has to be that safe for it
[01:12:47] Grant Lee: to be useful.
[01:12:48] Grant Lee: I don't think that's true.
[01:12:49] Grant Lee: In fact, I'll just share kind of the very early story of, you know, when we first started
[01:12:53] Grant Lee: gamma, we knew we wanted to help change the way people communicate.
[01:12:57] And we actually had two different ideas.
[01:12:59] Grant Lee: We were parallel, patting kind of at the same time.
[01:13:03] Grant Lee: So of course we had, you know, presentations reimagining how people were creating presentations.
[01:13:07] Grant Lee: And we also actually had the separate idea, which we called the lobby, which is a virtual
[01:13:12] Grant Lee: office.
[01:13:14] Grant Lee: This is a place where, you know, this is again, peak pandemic, much more hybrid work, much
[01:13:18] Grant Lee: for virtual work.
[01:13:19] Grant Lee: And so this was a place where everybody on the team, whether you're in the same office
[01:13:22] Grant Lee: or not, could gather, collaborate, it would feel pretty magical.
[01:13:26] Grant Lee: And we worked on both for six months.
[01:13:28] Grant Lee: We worked on both the virtual office and the presentation product for six months.
[01:13:33] Grant Lee: We would dog food both.
[01:13:35] Grant Lee: So like oftentimes we'd be in the virtual office presenting the presentation tool and
[01:13:39] Grant Lee: kind of use both.
[01:13:41] Grant Lee: And after six months, we came to this conclusion that we wanted to go all in on the presentation
[01:13:46] Grant Lee: tool.
[01:13:47] Grant Lee: And the reason was when we looked at the virtual office tool, we were sort of always competing
[01:13:52] Grant Lee: against what we thought was something we'd never be able to surpass, which is in real
[01:13:57] Grant Lee: life experience, like actually being able to work shoulders shoulder with our colleagues
[01:14:01] Grant Lee: and having this environment where, you know, you really feel like you're building together.
[01:14:05] Grant Lee: Like virtual office could get pretty good, but we would never beat that.
[01:14:08] Grant Lee: And so we were almost like limited in our own imagination about how good could this product
[01:14:13] Grant Lee: be versus the presentation product.
[01:14:16] Grant Lee: We ended that with like a million more ideas we thought we could actually introduce that
[01:14:20] Grant Lee: could be better than how you work in PowerPoint today.
[01:14:22] Grant Lee: And we were just so, so energized by it.
[01:14:25] Grant Lee: And so for us, that was like, you know, this sort of AP test of like testing these two
[01:14:28] Grant Lee: things that we invested equally amount of equal amount of time into and coming out at
[01:14:33] Grant Lee: the other end, realizing that one was going to be the product we were poor sort of, you
[01:14:38] Grant Lee: know, all of our blood sweat and tears into making it great because we saw the potential
[01:14:42] Grant Lee: in it.
[01:14:43] Lenny Rachitsky: I didn't know that about you guys that you explored that other idea that there's so many
[01:14:46] Lenny Rachitsky: startups that did that during COVID times.
[01:14:48] Lenny Rachitsky: I'm like, okay, this is the future.
[01:14:49] Lenny Rachitsky: We're all going to be remote and let's work remotely and virtual offices.
[01:14:53] Lenny Rachitsky: There's a startup and I'm a tiny investor in Lindy that is now a big AI agent company.
[01:14:58] Lenny Rachitsky: They did the same thing.
[01:14:59] Lenny Rachitsky: I imagine, you know, that was their whole first concept.
[01:15:01] Lenny Rachitsky: There was just like these little avatars.
[01:15:03] Lenny Rachitsky: There's like a little game where you walk around and go to the little virtual.
[01:15:06] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, yeah, we had some, yeah, it was a fun product to work on.
[01:15:09] Grant Lee: So, but yeah.
[01:15:11] Grant Lee: Yeah, it's interesting how we just reverted to the base back to like the mean of just
[01:15:15] Lenny Rachitsky: lay people in offices again.
[01:15:16] Lenny Rachitsky: That was a fun, fun experience.
[01:15:18] Lenny Rachitsky: Although things have changed.
[01:15:20] Lenny Rachitsky: So just to highlight to this point you made that I think is really powerful.
[01:15:24] Lenny Rachitsky: I haven't heard it describe this way before.
[01:15:27] Lenny Rachitsky: Just the power of testing prototypes very, very, very early using these platforms that
[01:15:33] Lenny Rachitsky: make it super easy.
[01:15:34] Lenny Rachitsky: We always hear, okay, you have a mock, you have a prototype.
[01:15:38] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, it's always feels like this heavy thing.
[01:15:41] Lenny Rachitsky: You gotta have a user research team.
[01:15:42] Lenny Rachitsky: Go do interviews, do one-on-ones.
[01:15:45] Lenny Rachitsky: Like what you're describing is something I don't know why everyone's not doing this.
[01:15:48] Lenny Rachitsky: And with AI tools, it's so easy now.
[01:15:50] Lenny Rachitsky: Have an idea, build the prototype, test it with, I don't know, is it like dozens of people,
[01:15:55] Lenny Rachitsky: how many people actually run through a prototype on average?
[01:15:58] 20.
[01:15:59] Grant Lee: 20 people.
[01:16:00] Lenny Rachitsky: So 20 people, look at this thing, give you a bunch of feedback, you realize this was very
[01:16:03] Lenny Rachitsky: down, or here's the nugget that we want to lean into.
[01:16:06] Lenny Rachitsky: And instead of building the thing, instead of doing all these user research sessions,
[01:16:09] Lenny Rachitsky: things like that, super cool.
[01:16:12] Okay.
[01:16:14] Is there any other big lesson or lever that has helped you grow to, today is 100 million
[01:16:22] Lenny Rachitsky: ARR, $2 billion company.
[01:16:24] Lenny Rachitsky: We talked about influencer marketing.
[01:16:26] Lenny Rachitsky: We talked about testing prototypes, investing in brand, and a little bit of paid growth,
[01:16:31] Lenny Rachitsky: anything else.
[01:16:32] Lenny Rachitsky: Certainly for us, the ability to sort of adapt and move fast in this environment, I attribute
[01:16:38] Grant Lee: a lot of, what we've been able to accomplish a few things.
[01:16:42] Grant Lee: We do have a small team and a lean team, one that's able to move really fast.
[01:16:46] Grant Lee: I think that means by default, we have to look for a lot of levers where a small team
[01:16:52] Grant Lee: can do a lot of different things.
[01:16:53] Grant Lee: So we can talk one, obviously about how do you construct a team like ours and what
[01:16:59] Grant Lee: I think has worked.
[01:17:00] Grant Lee: And then two, going back to experimentation being this sort of thing where, for us, it's
[01:17:05] Grant Lee: been a huge unlock, right?
[01:17:07] It allows you to not only test things and iterate a ton, it allows you to build much
[01:17:13] Grant Lee: more efficiently.
[01:17:14] Grant Lee: And so we've been a startup where we've had great economics from the very beginning.
[01:17:19] Grant Lee: We run profitably, we have really strong margins.
[01:17:22] Grant Lee: I don't think that would be possible if experimentation was a core infrastructure to
[01:17:26] Grant Lee: us because the temptation would be you just throw the most expensive model at every job
[01:17:30] Grant Lee: and assume that's going to work.
[01:17:32] Grant Lee: And the reality is that never is the case.
[01:17:34] Grant Lee: And so for us to be able to actually test across 20 different models in production today,
[01:17:39] always trying to align value we're delivering to our customers with our ability to actually
[01:17:44] Grant Lee: scale this operation.
[01:17:46] Grant Lee: That's been at the background and not always things that are easily quantifiable or things
[01:17:52] Grant Lee: that you share broadly, but it is core to our DNA.
[01:17:55] Grant Lee: And again, going back to the team that came from Optimize, probably not surprising, but
[01:17:59] Grant Lee: I do think that's been part of our ability to actually execute at this level.
[01:18:03] Grant Lee: I love that the product is so beautiful and such a great experience.
[01:18:07] Lenny Rachitsky: It's such a good example of experimentation and being really obsessed with any experiment
[01:18:11] Lenny Rachitsky: that you test like you have the data can create really beautiful products and experiences
[01:18:15] Lenny Rachitsky: that aren't just feeling like some kind of micro optimized flow.
[01:18:18] Lenny Rachitsky: Totally, yeah.
[01:18:19] And just going back to like one part of the team, part of the plays a huge role, which
[01:18:23] Grant Lee: is you want to build a product, you know, people talk about taste and brand and all these
[01:18:28] Grant Lee: things.
[01:18:29] Grant Lee: Are they a mode?
[01:18:30] I'm not going to kind of throw in whether or not, yes or no, but I do think it makes
[01:18:35] Grant Lee: a difference.
[01:18:36] Grant Lee: And for us at some point, you know, more than a quarter of a team or about a quarter
[01:18:40] Grant Lee: of our team was product designers.
[01:18:43] Grant Lee: And I think that's like an un sort of unintuitive level of investment or at least that's not common.
[01:18:49] Grant Lee: You don't see many startups like on our stage or early stage, you know, where we're a quarter
[01:18:53] Grant Lee: of the team's product designers.
[01:18:55] Grant Lee: And I think that was an important investment for us because when you think about, you know,
[01:18:59] with AI companies, so many companies are trying to invent new surface areas or, you know,
[01:19:03] Grant Lee: new user experiences.
[01:19:04] Grant Lee: And that's not possible if you're not really getting the foundation, right?
[01:19:08] Grant Lee: Really thinking deeply about, you know, user problems and how can you solve them in a
[01:19:12] Grant Lee: novel way?
[01:19:14] Grant Lee: And so for us, like we made that investment in the very beginning, even if it was counter
[01:19:17] Grant Lee: to what other startups would do because we actually felt like it was the right thing.
[01:19:21] Okay.
[01:19:22] Lenny Rachitsky: I definitely want to spend more time on hiring before we get to that.
[01:19:25] Lenny Rachitsky: You've touched on this kind of concept that you guys are with many describe a GPT
[01:19:31] Lenny Rachitsky: wrapper company.
[01:19:32] Lenny Rachitsky: You essentially sit on top of other models, do some cool stuff, charge for that.
[01:19:38] Lenny Rachitsky: There's historically, and there's been a big shift here, historically, there's a sense
[01:19:41] Lenny Rachitsky: that, okay, you're just this thin layer on top of the model.
[01:19:46] Lenny Rachitsky: How is there any sort of motor leverage or long term business model here when it's just
[01:19:51] Lenny Rachitsky: the model that is doing the thing and charging you guys to do all this AI work?
[01:19:56] Lenny Rachitsky: It feels like people have started to realize maybe that is where the all that is the only
[01:20:00] Lenny Rachitsky: place money will be made because the models are just so hard to compete with and that's
[01:20:04] Lenny Rachitsky: not a place you can build a business anymore.
[01:20:07] Lenny Rachitsky: Talk about just what you've learned about this concept of being a GPT wrapper and how
[01:20:11] Lenny Rachitsky: maybe what people may not be understanding about the business opportunity there.
[01:20:14] Lenny Rachitsky: You know, when you think about maybe just literally only being a wrapper on like, you know,
[01:20:19] Grant Lee: one model or, you know, one provider, yeah, maybe there's only, you know, limited amount
[01:20:23] Grant Lee: of utility or value add.
[01:20:26] But then when you start thinking about, okay, I'm going to go really deep into this one
[01:20:29] Grant Lee: workflow.
[01:20:30] Grant Lee: And it's not just one model, it's maybe 20 plus models powering all different parts
[01:20:34] Grant Lee: of the product.
[01:20:35] Grant Lee: And then you think about the orchestration that's required.
[01:20:38] Grant Lee: And you're thinking about obviously if you're experimenting like constantly being able
[01:20:42] Grant Lee: to test across the newest models versus, you know, models that have been around that are
[01:20:46] Grant Lee: cheaper, like you're doing a lot to really, you know, your job is to again, like align value,
[01:20:52] Grant Lee: you know, maximize the value you're delivering to the end user in a way that's sustainable
[01:20:57] Grant Lee: for you as a business.
[01:20:59] Grant Lee: And so there's a lot more to that.
[01:21:00] Grant Lee: And so for us, you know, we've always been passionate about being very close to our customers,
[01:21:05] Grant Lee: our users who for them, their job to be done is, you know, visual communication, visual
[01:21:10] Grant Lee: storytelling.
[01:21:11] Grant Lee: And the default tool today is going into like a PowerPoint or a Google Slice where the
[01:21:16] Grant Lee: amount of effort to create something, you know, we've all been there later now trying
[01:21:20] Grant Lee: to format a deck, trying to find the right layout, all this manual and tedious work.
[01:21:23] Grant Lee: Well, what if you could abstract all that away and give them something that feels a little
[01:21:28] Grant Lee: bit more delightful, a little bit easier, much more effortless?
[01:21:31] Grant Lee: What would that earn you in terms of a customer that wants to come back to your product?
[01:21:35] Grant Lee: And so that's everything that we focus on is like, you need to go deep into the workflow,
[01:21:40] Grant Lee: be empathetic to the user and their job that you're trying to solve.
[01:21:43] Grant Lee: And of course, apply the best technology possible so that you're delivering on that promise
[01:21:48] Grant Lee: of a product experience as way better than the status quo.
[01:21:51] Grant Lee: And I think if you can be laser focused on it, it doesn't matter if you're a rapper or
[01:21:54] Grant Lee: not like, what is the technology you're doing in applying that makes a real difference?
[01:21:59] Grant Lee: So that's the ultimate goal.
[01:22:01] This is a really cool framework for how to think about what it takes to build a successful
[01:22:05] Lenny Rachitsky: rapper company that is, I don't know, let's just, I'll keep using that term.
[01:22:08] Lenny Rachitsky: I don't know if it's truck or not.
[01:22:10] Lenny Rachitsky: But just like, you know, some ideas don't work because these model companies are launching
[01:22:14] Lenny Rachitsky: their own products here and there.
[01:22:16] Lenny Rachitsky: So what I love about you're describing here is kind of like the almost like a heuristic
[01:22:21] Lenny Rachitsky: that'll tell you if there's, if there's an opportunity slash how to be successful as
[01:22:25] Lenny Rachitsky: a GPT rapper company, I'm putting in air quotes.
[01:22:28] Lenny Rachitsky: It sounded like maybe there's three here, but talk about just like if you think about
[01:22:31] Lenny Rachitsky: the bullet points of what you need to do to build a successful business on top of existing
[01:22:36] Lenny Rachitsky: models.
[01:22:37] Lenny Rachitsky: I mean, I think the most important thing is, you know, before we even talk about the technology,
[01:22:42] Grant Lee: so we're we're skipping to the part where you're trying to, you know, apply the most interesting
[01:22:46] Grant Lee: models or technology to solve some problem.
[01:22:49] Grant Lee: Start with solving the problem you actually care about.
[01:22:52] Grant Lee: You know, I think it's very tempting right now to chase shiny objects like a founder might
[01:22:56] Grant Lee: be able to gain some initial traction by literally being that GPT rapper and like solving
[01:23:01] Grant Lee: any sort of problem and like you start and see some traction and then you just go with
[01:23:04] Grant Lee: that.
[01:23:05] Grant Lee: Before you do that, you should think about is this a problem I can invest five to 10 years
[01:23:09] Grant Lee: in it's actually solving, do I care deeply enough about it?
[01:23:13] Grant Lee: Because if you can, you're never going to go sort of actually think about like overcoming
[01:23:18] Grant Lee: the variety of different hurdles, whether it's other startups or other, you know, incumbent
[01:23:21] Grant Lee: tools that are trying to start doing the same thing.
[01:23:24] Grant Lee: And so for us, like we go back to like, you know, we've started this company because we
[01:23:28] Grant Lee: really care about helping change the way people communicate their ideas.
[01:23:32] Grant Lee: We really feel like this idea of like visual communication, visual storytelling matters.
[01:23:36] Grant Lee: It helps elevate everybody and it gives people much more opportunity to do the things that,
[01:23:41] Grant Lee: you know, in the past, if you weren't great at making slides, your ideas might have died.
[01:23:45] Grant Lee: And someone else that was able to actually articulate their ideas better and to end up winning,
[01:23:49] Grant Lee: you know, the deal or winning the, you know, the favor of their manager or their boss.
[01:23:53] Grant Lee: And so we felt like that was the wrong, you know, that didn't feel right.
[01:23:57] And so could we help democratize visual storytelling, visual communication?
[01:24:01] Grant Lee: That was sort of our North Star.
[01:24:03] Grant Lee: And then you go back into thinking, okay, every step of the way, what are the tools and
[01:24:07] Grant Lee: technology I can apply to help solve that and actually move the average person closer
[01:24:11] Grant Lee: to that long term vision of ours.
[01:24:14] Grant Lee: And of course, AI's been, again, like this gift where yes, you can apply that to solving
[01:24:18] Grant Lee: this job.
[01:24:19] Grant Lee: You can also apply that, you know, AI to many different jobs, figure out what is the
[01:24:23] Grant Lee: problem you care deeply enough to go deep because going back to this sort of idea, like
[01:24:27] Grant Lee: you need to own the sort of end to end workflow.
[01:24:29] Grant Lee: A customer needs to have you, like you want you to live, you want your product to live
[01:24:34] Grant Lee: in their brain somewhere where when they think about, hey, I have to create a presentation,
[01:24:38] Grant Lee: they come to you as a default tool.
[01:24:40] Grant Lee: And the moment they start creating it to the moment they ship it and send it to, you
[01:24:44] Grant Lee: know, their boss, that end to end experience needs to feel magical needs to feel great.
[01:24:49] Grant Lee: And I don't think you can really do that unless it's actually a workflow.
[01:24:51] Grant Lee: You either know deeply yourself or you care deeply to actually help solve for somebody
[01:24:55] Grant Lee: else.
[01:24:56] Grant Lee: So some of the elements I'm hearing here is one is just like care, actually really
[01:25:01] Lenny Rachitsky: care about solving this problem, not come from, oh, wow, this cool thing happened in
[01:25:05] Lenny Rachitsky: a work.
[01:25:06] Lenny Rachitsky: Wow, maybe I could sell this thing to people because you may end up having to work
[01:25:09] Lenny Rachitsky: on this thing for 10, 20 years.
[01:25:11] Lenny Rachitsky: Totally.
[01:25:12] Grant Lee: Two is understand the problem really, really deeply and have real empathy for the people
[01:25:17] Lenny Rachitsky: trying to solve this problem.
[01:25:18] Lenny Rachitsky: You have this problem that you creating presentations of your previous jobs, you understood
[01:25:22] Lenny Rachitsky: it.
[01:25:24] Lenny Rachitsky: Understand it even more deeply now that you work on this.
[01:25:27] Lenny Rachitsky: So essentially, like care really deeply, go really deep on the problem, have real empathy
[01:25:32] Lenny Rachitsky: for the people facing this problem.
[01:25:34] Lenny Rachitsky: And then there's this like actually be able to solve this problem using the technology
[01:25:38] Lenny Rachitsky: out there.
[01:25:39] Lenny Rachitsky: And you made this point about how you guys use 20 different models to do what you do.
[01:25:43] Lenny Rachitsky: Talk a little bit more about that just because you know, people may think, oh, okay,
[01:25:47] Lenny Rachitsky: like I could just go to open to chat to pts or cloud and it'll create an awesome presentation
[01:25:50] Lenny Rachitsky: for me.
[01:25:51] Lenny Rachitsky: So you could take 20 different models, why is that such a big part of the success here?
[01:25:55] Yeah, so going back to the workflow, you know, you're trying to go and break down every
[01:25:59] Grant Lee: step of the creation process for a user.
[01:26:02] Grant Lee: So the moment of the initial idea to maybe creating an outline of what you want to, you
[01:26:08] Grant Lee: know, present or articulate to creating the first draft.
[01:26:11] Grant Lee: Like what do we show you there to editing the content?
[01:26:14] Grant Lee: Like, okay, I have a first draft, but it's only 60% of the way there.
[01:26:17] Grant Lee: How do I get to 100% of the way there?
[01:26:19] Grant Lee: Those are all things that might require different models.
[01:26:22] Grant Lee: Like the initial outline might be better served by something that's purpose built for actually
[01:26:26] Grant Lee: creating, you know, the best outline, the best narrative, the best story arc versus one
[01:26:31] Grant Lee: where you're actually going back and saying, you know, gamma or agent can actually go and
[01:26:35] Grant Lee: review your entire deck and say, actually, if I were to add suggestions, I would say,
[01:26:39] Grant Lee: you know, you may want to change the visual layout on these set of cards and you may want
[01:26:44] Grant Lee: to actually change the imagery or the visuals for these cards to match, you know, everything
[01:26:49] Grant Lee: else.
[01:26:50] Grant Lee: These are things out again, like every model might be better served for different things.
[01:26:53] Grant Lee: And so knowing how that actually breaks down into the end user sitting down, working
[01:26:57] Grant Lee: on the product, working on, working on, you know, their presentation, how do you help
[01:27:01] Grant Lee: them?
[01:27:02] Grant Lee: I mean, you can only do that by understanding that workflow and then breaking that down into
[01:27:05] Grant Lee: finding the right tool for the right job.
[01:27:07] Grant Lee: That is super interesting.
[01:27:08] Lenny Rachitsky: Essentially, there's like, here's the things that AI has to do for us.
[01:27:11] Lenny Rachitsky: I don't know, imagining some kind of storyboard and then it's figure out the model and level
[01:27:17] Lenny Rachitsky: of model and prompt for that model to achieve each of these steps as best as possible.
[01:27:23] Totally.
[01:27:24] Grant Lee: And it applies to, you know, even on the visual side, finding the right image, I think certain
[01:27:27] Grant Lee: models of great photo realistic output versus others, you know, want more of the artistic
[01:27:32] Grant Lee: vibe or like, you know, something that feels more abstract.
[01:27:36] Grant Lee: And so again, you can choose the right model for the right job.
[01:27:38] Grant Lee: It doesn't mean that you'll never use other models.
[01:27:41] Grant Lee: It's just like as you're going through that workflow, the content might dictate, you know,
[01:27:46] Grant Lee: that's the best use case.
[01:27:47] Grant Lee: So in that particular, you know, particular use case.
[01:27:49] Grant Lee: And so you're always trying to map to that.
[01:27:51] Grant Lee: What is the end user trying to accomplish in that certain moment?
[01:27:55] Which models are you finding most useful in the work?
[01:27:59] Lenny Rachitsky: Like, I don't know.
[01:28:00] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there anything surprising about, oh, wow, this model is actually really good at this.
[01:28:02] Lenny Rachitsky: And this is really bad at that.
[01:28:04] Yeah.
[01:28:05] Grant Lee: I think surprising or not surprising, the leaderboard is constantly changing.
[01:28:08] Grant Lee: And so this is where you almost, you have to have the mindset that you can be adaptable.
[01:28:14] Grant Lee: So we're just going to the point where there's going to be more personalization to is going
[01:28:17] Grant Lee: back to like, you know, a consultant is going to have different needs in an educator.
[01:28:21] Grant Lee: If an educator is trying to engage their students, they may want to have, you know, language
[01:28:25] Grant Lee: or visuals are more animated.
[01:28:26] Grant Lee: And that makes sense.
[01:28:28] Grant Lee: Consultant can't get away with that.
[01:28:29] Grant Lee: They may need something that is much more structured or information dense.
[01:28:33] Grant Lee: And so again, like, how do we actually be the same tool that can serve both of those
[01:28:37] Grant Lee: needs?
[01:28:38] Grant Lee: I think that's where it becomes interesting.
[01:28:39] Grant Lee: And it's almost like there isn't necessarily even a quote-unquote best model.
[01:28:43] It's like, what's the right model for that right and for that particular user?
[01:28:46] Grant Lee: That's not too much harder problem to solve.
[01:28:48] Grant Lee: And we're just starting to, you know, try to embrace some of that now.
[01:28:50] Grant Lee: Is there one that's just like, oh, that's actually really cool for some, that way you
[01:28:53] Lenny Rachitsky: didn't expect?
[01:28:54] Lenny Rachitsky: Early on, things like creating the outline perplexity was actually great.
[01:28:58] Grant Lee: You know, not one that people talk about is often, but creating the outline and doing
[01:29:01] Grant Lee: web search and, you know, actually integrating some of those elements together for us was
[01:29:05] Grant Lee: pretty powerful.
[01:29:06] Grant Lee: They're okay.
[01:29:07] Lenny Rachitsky: There's two more things I want to talk about.
[01:29:08] Lenny Rachitsky: One is pricing.
[01:29:09] Lenny Rachitsky: You're approaching to pricing.
[01:29:11] Lenny Rachitsky: You guys started monetizing really early.
[01:29:13] Lenny Rachitsky: And I feel like such an important piece to AI startups because you're spending real money
[01:29:18] Lenny Rachitsky: on inference and other things.
[01:29:21] Lenny Rachitsky: And then I want to talk about hiring.
[01:29:23] Lenny Rachitsky: So in terms of pricing, when did you decide it was time to really start charging and then
[01:29:27] Lenny Rachitsky: how did you pick your approach to pricing, your actual price?
[01:29:31] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah.
[01:29:32] Grant Lee: So we kind of stumbled into having to do pricing and packaging.
[01:29:36] Grant Lee: I mentioned our big AI launch in March 2023.
[01:29:39] Grant Lee: This is pre-revenue.
[01:29:40] Grant Lee: So we wanted just to get the, you know, we focused all of our effort on the first 30 seconds.
[01:29:46] Grant Lee: Literally, all hands on deck just trying to get that right.
[01:29:49] Grant Lee: And we spent zero time on actually monetization.
[01:29:52] Grant Lee: So we, you know, we had a credit system on the users get 400 credits.
[01:29:57] Grant Lee: Once they burn through those credits, there was actually nothing more you could do with
[01:30:00] Grant Lee: AI.
[01:30:01] Grant Lee: It kind of just cut off.
[01:30:02] Grant Lee: And so Intercom for us was just blowing up with people saying, how do I purchase more
[01:30:06] Grant Lee: credits?
[01:30:07] Grant Lee: I want to keep using this thing in a very fair question.
[01:30:10] Grant Lee: So basically all of April, we ended up having to do a quick, you know, sort of pricing and
[01:30:15] Grant Lee: packaging exercise.
[01:30:17] Grant Lee: We did a couple of different things.
[01:30:19] Grant Lee: We did run a form of Van Westendorp, which is just understanding what is the overall
[01:30:23] Grant Lee: will miss the play and what will nest to pay.
[01:30:26] Grant Lee: And so we did, we did use that.
[01:30:28] Grant Lee: We did kind of integrate some forms of like conjoined analysis, which is just like trying
[01:30:32] Grant Lee: to understand, you know, what are the features or things that people actually value in your
[01:30:35] Grant Lee: product.
[01:30:36] Grant Lee: And so we'd survey a lot of our early users and and can it ended up coming to a price
[01:30:41] Grant Lee: point that was in the beginning, we only had one plan type was roughly like 20 bucks a
[01:30:44] Grant Lee: month.
[01:30:45] Grant Lee: Part of this was also just realizing we almost need to overthink it too much because this
[01:30:50] Grant Lee: is one of the initial wave of like AI companies and startups are coming out and products are
[01:30:54] Grant Lee: coming out.
[01:30:55] Grant Lee: And you're almost end up becoming anchored by what is chat to be T charge because everyone
[01:31:00] Grant Lee: becomes familiar with that price point.
[01:31:02] Grant Lee: And so we asked ourselves like, how complicated do we want to make it?
[01:31:05] Grant Lee: We always default to remove friction, make it as easy as possible for a user to understand.
[01:31:09] Grant Lee: And so we end up coming up with like a similar price point and kind of ship that as the
[01:31:13] Grant Lee: V1 basically end of May 2023.
[01:31:17] And for us, we wanted to see a couple things like, okay, we have the initial price point.
[01:31:21] Is it economical for us like at the price point, or we actually making money and we'd
[01:31:25] Grant Lee: monitor there for that for many, many months realizing that yes, like actually at that price
[01:31:30] Grant Lee: point, we could still generate pretty good margins.
[01:31:34] And that would allow us to reinvest that profit back into growing the business, continue
[01:31:37] Grant Lee: to add, obviously headcount, but then also investing even more into inference costs, whatever
[01:31:42] Grant Lee: we wanted to do to experiment broadly with AI.
[01:31:45] And so we've always had that like pricing and packaging is not only, it doesn't not only
[01:31:50] Grant Lee: need to be easy to understand for a user.
[01:31:52] Grant Lee: And obviously you have to have like strong conversion rates, but it should be something
[01:31:56] Grant Lee: where you feel like you could build an enduring durable business off of.
[01:32:00] Grant Lee: It's not right.
[01:32:01] Grant Lee: Then you can always go back and try to tweak things, but it's something you should be
[01:32:03] Grant Lee: monitoring as early as possible.
[01:32:05] Grant Lee: What's interesting, we have the head of ChatGPT on the podcast and he shared the way they
[01:32:09] Lenny Rachitsky: picked ChatGPT's prices of the Vand West and Dorp survey that they ran in Google Forms.
[01:32:14] Lenny Rachitsky: Oh, yeah, yeah, I listened to that one.
[01:32:15] Grant Lee: Yeah, it was a great one.
[01:32:16] Grant Lee: Oh, what a, that survey, man, what a, and not only just that survey being the, it's like
[01:32:22] Lenny Rachitsky: I'm imagining that XKCD comic with like the open source little, I don't know, block
[01:32:28] Lenny Rachitsky: holding up the entire world like this one little piece of code.
[01:32:33] Lenny Rachitsky: That's like the survey, just like behind everything.
[01:32:36] Lenny Rachitsky: But it's interesting how that one decision just created this ripple effect on all AI startups
[01:32:39] Lenny Rachitsky: 20 bucks a month, of course, that's what everyone's doing.
[01:32:42] Totally.
[01:32:43] Grant Lee: Who knows what would happen if they chose a different number, but here we are.
[01:32:46] Grant Lee: Right.
[01:32:47] Lenny Rachitsky: Everyone be so much more rich.
[01:32:48] Lenny Rachitsky: It's just like 25 bucks.
[01:32:49] Lenny Rachitsky: And imagine the GDP growth from that.
[01:32:53] Lenny Rachitsky: Oh, man.
[01:32:54] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay.
[01:32:55] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay.
[01:32:56] Lenny Rachitsky: And then the way so is Vand West and Dorp helped you pick a price point.
[01:32:59] Lenny Rachitsky: And then you said this, uh, conjoined analysis.
[01:33:01] Lenny Rachitsky: We actually have a guest post that I think describes how to do this well.
[01:33:04] Lenny Rachitsky: And if not, we'll find people to actually approach this.
[01:33:07] Lenny Rachitsky: And you started charging.
[01:33:09] Lenny Rachitsky: So it was post product cut launch, you launch with no paid features.
[01:33:14] Lenny Rachitsky: People were just like, I want to pay.
[01:33:15] Lenny Rachitsky: I want to keep using this.
[01:33:16] Lenny Rachitsky: You're like, okay, I guess we got to start charging.
[01:33:18] That's right.
[01:33:19] Grant Lee: Yep.
[01:33:20] Lenny Rachitsky: Is there anything looking back?
[01:33:21] Lenny Rachitsky: I guess just like you wish you'd known.
[01:33:23] Lenny Rachitsky: And you were approaching pricing for folks that are doing this now.
[01:33:25] Lenny Rachitsky: Like, oh, we should have done this differently or should have thought about this.
[01:33:28] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah.
[01:33:29] Grant Lee: I mean, that's well, that one's hard.
[01:33:30] Grant Lee: I think, you know, you never want to obviously just throw something together without giving
[01:33:34] Grant Lee: a much thought.
[01:33:35] Grant Lee: But for us, you know, we, we, with limited resources, we focused on the only thing we thought
[01:33:40] Grant Lee: mattered, which was like getting some initial users and having that organic growth.
[01:33:44] Grant Lee: And I think there's, there's maybe like two checkpoints of thinking about whether or
[01:33:48] Grant Lee: not you feel like you have product market fit.
[01:33:50] Grant Lee: I think one checkpoint is organic growth.
[01:33:52] Grant Lee: The second is our people willing to pay for the product.
[01:33:54] Grant Lee: And I think if you pass both those, you feel like you've, you've, you've at least within
[01:33:58] Grant Lee: some pocket of the market, you have some PMF.
[01:34:00] Grant Lee: So I think, you know, those are both important questions to ask, depending on your resources.
[01:34:06] Grant Lee: Ideally, you can do kind of both an experiment a little bit along, you know, at the same time.
[01:34:11] Grant Lee: And then by the time you actually have paying users, you've, you sort of check some of those
[01:34:14] Grant Lee: boxes for yourself.
[01:34:15] Grant Lee: By the way, I love the Jews.
[01:34:16] Lenny Rachitsky: Like you launch pricing.
[01:34:17] Lenny Rachitsky: You're like, okay, let's figure out if I actually make you money or not.
[01:34:20] Lenny Rachitsky: It's not obvious.
[01:34:21] Lenny Rachitsky: I would invite companies.
[01:34:22] I'm telling you.
[01:34:23] Well, we also didn't have a choice because at that point runway was also low, you know,
[01:34:27] Grant Lee: so it's like if we weren't making money, well, you know, we would actually be in a tough
[01:34:29] Grant Lee: spot.
[01:34:30] Grant Lee: That's such a good point that you did not have a huge amount of money sitting around
[01:34:34] Lenny Rachitsky: and to spend on like the way a lot of companies in the I would just, we would deal with it
[01:34:38] Lenny Rachitsky: and would figure out I would make money later.
[01:34:40] Lenny Rachitsky: Totally.
[01:34:41] Grant Lee: Yeah.
[01:34:42] Grant Lee: Within a couple months, we had hit a million an ARR and became profitable.
[01:34:45] Grant Lee: And so those were both two exciting milestones for a company that months prior were, you know,
[01:34:50] Grant Lee: heads down figuring out how we even survive.
[01:34:53] What a story.
[01:34:54] Lenny Rachitsky: I'm so excited to be telling the story.
[01:34:56] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay, final topic.
[01:34:58] Lenny Rachitsky: I want to talk about is hiring?
[01:34:59] Lenny Rachitsky: You have some really hot takes on hiring.
[01:35:01] Lenny Rachitsky: Clearly it's worked out for you guys.
[01:35:03] Lenny Rachitsky: What are some things you've learned about hiring well?
[01:35:06] Lenny Rachitsky: What is your approach to hiring?
[01:35:08] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, so we had this mantra internally,
[01:35:11] Grant Lee: I mean, even before the sort of AI launch for us,
[01:35:14] Grant Lee: which was higher painfully, slowly.
[01:35:17] Grant Lee: And I think the temptation is,
[01:35:19] Grant Lee: you know, things start working, you just start
[01:35:22] Grant Lee: let's scaling this thing and start adding more and more
[01:35:24] Grant Lee: head count.
[01:35:25] Grant Lee: And for us, that always, I don't know, they didn't feel right.
[01:35:28] Grant Lee: We wanted to build the team very thoughtfully,
[01:35:31] Grant Lee: be lean, but also be a team that every individual feels
[01:35:34] Grant Lee: like they have high amount of impact that they can,
[01:35:37] Grant Lee: that they have on a daily basis.
[01:35:39] Grant Lee: And so for us, yeah, that was from sort of the very beginning.
[01:35:41] Grant Lee: And so even, you know, as we've scaled up,
[01:35:43] Grant Lee: I think we've been super efficient by nature
[01:35:45] Grant Lee: of just being a very lean team.
[01:35:47] So I think a lot of people here,
[01:35:48] Lenny Rachitsky: this advice of a staleean, be efficient,
[01:35:50] Lenny Rachitsky: you have some even more concrete pieces of advice here,
[01:35:52] Lenny Rachitsky: just like what that looks like.
[01:35:54] Lenny Rachitsky: You have a huge, I don't know, philosophy
[01:35:57] Lenny Rachitsky: of just like huge leverage per person,
[01:35:59] Lenny Rachitsky: you focus a lot on it, revenue per employee, talk about that.
[01:36:03] So actually, I mean, we obviously,
[01:36:05] Grant Lee: we look at things like revenue per employee,
[01:36:06] Grant Lee: but we never let that be the sort of North Star.
[01:36:09] Grant Lee: It's not something that dictates our strategy per se.
[01:36:11] Grant Lee: Same thing with like profitability,
[01:36:13] Grant Lee: I think by being efficient, like that,
[01:36:15] Grant Lee: ends up becoming like a side effect of,
[01:36:17] Grant Lee: yeah, we are profitable and growing.
[01:36:19] Grant Lee: But I think for us, more of us,
[01:36:21] Grant Lee: like we care a ton about, you know,
[01:36:23] Grant Lee: adding the right team members.
[01:36:24] Grant Lee: So, you know, it's easy,
[01:36:26] Grant Lee: you can almost sort of shoot yourself
[01:36:28] Grant Lee: on the foot as a founder by just setting the wrong goals.
[01:36:30] Grant Lee: If your goal is to double and head count
[01:36:32] Grant Lee: and like add 100 people to the company,
[01:36:34] Grant Lee: then that becomes the goal, right?
[01:36:36] Grant Lee: The goal is no longer to add the best people,
[01:36:38] Grant Lee: there's no longer to maintain a high quality bar.
[01:36:40] Grant Lee: The goal is to hit 100 people
[01:36:42] Grant Lee: and that's everything everyone's focused on.
[01:36:44] Grant Lee: So then guess what, if that's the goal,
[01:36:45] Grant Lee: then the thing that ends up dropping is,
[01:36:46] Grant Lee: okay, maybe we'll settle for employees that are good enough.
[01:36:50] And we're gonna make sure we get to that 100
[01:36:52] Grant Lee: because 100 is gonna help us get to the next phase of growth
[01:36:54] Grant Lee: and the next phase of growth.
[01:36:56] Grant Lee: And I think we've tried to resist that temptation,
[01:36:58] Grant Lee: which is we want everybody that comes through the door
[01:37:01] Grant Lee: and joins our team to really be, you know,
[01:37:06] Grant Lee: the type of person that represents Gamma.
[01:37:09] Grant Lee: Our first 10 to 12 employees,
[01:37:10] Grant Lee: we spent so much time like really getting the DNA, right?
[01:37:14] I think Brian Chesky talks about this,
[01:37:15] Grant Lee: like your goal is like you get that first 10
[01:37:18] and you want to be able to then replicate the next 10
[01:37:21] Grant Lee: and then replicate the next 10.
[01:37:22] Grant Lee: But that 10 needs to be all super cohesive.
[01:37:24] Grant Lee: You need to have the shared, same shared values,
[01:37:27] Grant Lee: same principles, same ambitions, same vision.
[01:37:30] And if you don't, then like what are you even replicating, right?
[01:37:32] Grant Lee: At that point, you're just adding headcount
[01:37:33] Grant Lee: and you know, you can easily just be adding headcount
[01:37:36] Grant Lee: because they're chasing the next shiny startup to join.
[01:37:38] Grant Lee: And so for us, we really focused on that first 10,
[01:37:41] Grant Lee: that allows us to really have this, you know,
[01:37:45] this sort of community of, like a team mates
[01:37:49] Grant Lee: that basically, you know, want to stick around.
[01:37:52] A lot of founders think about, you know,
[01:37:54] Grant Lee: not wanting to have a leaky bucket on the product side,
[01:37:57] Grant Lee: but the same thing applies on the team side, right?
[01:37:59] Grant Lee: If you have a leaky bucket,
[01:38:00] Grant Lee: people are just constantly leaving, revolving door,
[01:38:02] Grant Lee: that's a huge amount of cost.
[01:38:04] Grant Lee: The continuity cost is massive
[01:38:06] Grant Lee: and it's really hard to quantify.
[01:38:08] Grant Lee: And that, I mentioned our first 10 employees,
[01:38:10] Grant Lee: all 10 of them are still here today,
[01:38:11] Grant Lee: five years later, right?
[01:38:12] Grant Lee: And so that sort of continuity
[01:38:13] Grant Lee: and means that you have this tribal knowledge
[01:38:15] Grant Lee: that sticks with you and means that people can continue building
[01:38:19] Grant Lee: and having that sort of cohesive feeling.
[01:38:20] Grant Lee: So I think that's one piece of just like,
[01:38:23] Grant Lee: it's hard to quantify, but I do think, you know,
[01:38:25] Grant Lee: startups, I would advise just to really be thoughtful
[01:38:28] Grant Lee: about that, like get that to a point
[01:38:29] Grant Lee: where you really feel confident that as you're adding
[01:38:32] Grant Lee: the next 10 and next 100,
[01:38:34] Grant Lee: you're actually replicating the same DNA
[01:38:36] Grant Lee: and not actually just adding a bunch of random people
[01:38:38] Grant Lee: to the company.
[01:38:39] One of your very specific pieces of advice
[01:38:41] Lenny Rachitsky: is hired generalists versus someone
[01:38:43] Lenny Rachitsky: that's just like really deep in one thing.
[01:38:45] Lenny Rachitsky: Why is that so important?
[01:38:46] Lenny Rachitsky: What does that look like?
[01:38:47] This very much feels like the age of the generalist
[01:38:49] Grant Lee: or the rise of the generalist right now.
[01:38:51] Grant Lee: When we think about, you know,
[01:38:53] Grant Lee: a team that can be really flat,
[01:38:55] Grant Lee: you want people that can,
[01:38:57] Grant Lee: you still want people that can be very spiky
[01:38:59] Grant Lee: in certain areas.
[01:39:00] Grant Lee: So for instance, you know, a product designer
[01:39:02] Grant Lee: that knows how to code, that's great.
[01:39:04] It allows you to actually span
[01:39:06] Grant Lee: across many different domains.
[01:39:08] Grant Lee: And again, a organization that's super flat
[01:39:11] Grant Lee: when you're wearing a lot of different hats,
[01:39:12] Grant Lee: that means every individual,
[01:39:13] Grant Lee: if you're a generalist, you can wear
[01:39:15] Grant Lee: by default a lot of different hats.
[01:39:17] Grant Lee: And that's helped us like just maintain this idea
[01:39:19] Grant Lee: that the work, you know, the opportunity in front of us,
[01:39:22] Grant Lee: it can easily expand.
[01:39:23] Grant Lee: Each person plays a huge role.
[01:39:24] Grant Lee: They don't need to wait and ask for permission.
[01:39:27] Grant Lee: They can go after and pick up a piece of work
[01:39:29] Grant Lee: because it's there and they can at least get it started,
[01:39:31] Grant Lee: even if they're not the one that always sees it through.
[01:39:34] And so for us, I do think this rise of the generalist
[01:39:36] Grant Lee: is going to be important.
[01:39:37] Grant Lee: You can always augment that by working
[01:39:39] Grant Lee: with contractors or agencies that are hyper-specialized
[01:39:42] Grant Lee: in certain areas.
[01:39:43] And this is where, like, for instance,
[01:39:44] Grant Lee: going back to influencer marketing,
[01:39:46] Grant Lee: you might work with an agency rather than kind of scale
[01:39:49] Grant Lee: up your own influencer marketing team.
[01:39:52] You work with like a hyper-specialized team there.
[01:39:54] Grant Lee: But my marketing team is all generalists.
[01:39:57] Grant Lee: You know, we are head of marketing,
[01:39:59] more recently launched this cool drone show.
[01:40:01] Grant Lee: In San Francisco, we have like 4,000 people
[01:40:04] Grant Lee: in San Francisco, calm the mayor came by.
[01:40:06] She created that entire project,
[01:40:08] Grant Lee: a managed entire project, end-to-hand or herself, right?
[01:40:11] Grant Lee: While also managing the entire marketing team.
[01:40:14] Grant Lee: And so it's like this idea that a generalist
[01:40:16] Grant Lee: is able to play all these different roles
[01:40:18] Grant Lee: can still be super high impact.
[01:40:21] Grant Lee: For us, it also goes hand in hand with,
[01:40:23] Grant Lee: I mentioned sort of this other role, which
[01:40:26] Grant Lee: is the player coach.
[01:40:27] Grant Lee: Traditional management layer is like a manager
[01:40:29] Grant Lee: manages a ton of people, and that's kind of their core focus.
[01:40:33] Grant Lee: All of our people leaders are player coaches,
[01:40:36] Grant Lee: in that they still do the end work themselves,
[01:40:39] Grant Lee: and they can like mentor and coach those around them.
[01:40:42] Grant Lee: This analogy came from, or this mindset came from something
[01:40:45] Grant Lee: I bought from just the sports world in general,
[01:40:48] Grant Lee: because there's a lot of sports that just move incredibly fast,
[01:40:50] Grant Lee: like football, for instance, and moves really, really fast.
[01:40:52] Grant Lee: And so you might have a coach that has,
[01:40:54] Grant Lee: it's calling in a play, but the quarterback
[01:40:56] Grant Lee: can actually make a last minute adjustment
[01:40:58] Grant Lee: based on what he's seeing the defense do, right?
[01:41:00] Grant Lee: And so you want a player that is on the field
[01:41:02] Grant Lee: that can adapt as needed.
[01:41:04] Grant Lee: And that way the coach doesn't have to call every single thing
[01:41:07] Grant Lee: in.
[01:41:08] Grant Lee: He's just kind of giving you the general intent
[01:41:09] Grant Lee: of what you want to run as the play.
[01:41:11] Grant Lee: And then the quarterback can still make the adjustments.
[01:41:13] Grant Lee: And so all of our people leaders, our management layer,
[01:41:17] Grant Lee: is all folks that actually can make those adjustments.
[01:41:19] Grant Lee: If they're seeing something that doesn't feel right,
[01:41:22] Grant Lee: on a daily or weekly basis, there are kind
[01:41:24] Grant Lee: of adjusting priorities for that team,
[01:41:26] and they're still doing the work themselves too.
[01:41:28] Grant Lee: They're so close to it that they understand,
[01:41:30] Grant Lee: what is the relative prioritization at all times.
[01:41:32] Grant Lee: So both of those, I think I've been,
[01:41:35] when I think about founders, they oftentimes think
[01:41:38] Grant Lee: about innovation in the sense, like we're
[01:41:40] Grant Lee: going to innovate on products or innovate on technology.
[01:41:43] Grant Lee: I think every founder today has a chance
[01:41:46] Grant Lee: to innovate on org design.
[01:41:47] Grant Lee: And that starts by just thinking about,
[01:41:49] Grant Lee: what is the type of company we want to build today?
[01:41:52] What does it mean when it comes to the management later,
[01:41:55] Grant Lee: what are the sort of leaders to rehire?
[01:41:57] Grant Lee: What does it mean when it comes to hiring specific roles
[01:41:59] Grant Lee: and specific functions?
[01:42:00] Grant Lee: All that is a chance for you to be very thoughtful
[01:42:03] Grant Lee: and build a company that you're excited to be at
[01:42:05] Grant Lee: for hopefully many, many years to come.
[01:42:07] Grant Lee: So what I'm hearing here is, there's no peer managers again,
[01:42:11] Lenny Rachitsky: when your plan is to not have people that are just managing,
[01:42:14] Lenny Rachitsky: the ideas everyone, even a manager, is doing their own
[01:42:16] Lenny Rachitsky: I.C. work.
[01:42:18] Yes.
[01:42:19] Grant Lee: And then the other piece of advice here is,
[01:42:21] Lenny Rachitsky: is generalists, people that can do a lot of stuff.
[01:42:23] Lenny Rachitsky: And I hear this a lot on this podcast, just like everyone,
[01:42:26] Lenny Rachitsky: there's no more just like you're a designer,
[01:42:28] Lenny Rachitsky: that's all you're going to do.
[01:42:29] Lenny Rachitsky: Designers need to build stuff, market stuff,
[01:42:31] Lenny Rachitsky: write some BRDs probably.
[01:42:33] Lenny Rachitsky: And I think, I mean, just one thing to add is like,
[01:42:36] Grant Lee: that's for where we are at today.
[01:42:39] Grant Lee: I think being adaptable means that certain things
[01:42:42] Grant Lee: may evolve and change and like how the player coach model
[01:42:45] Grant Lee: evolves, and maybe in certain functions or as a team
[01:42:48] Grant Lee: scales, that's not going to be practical everywhere.
[01:42:51] Grant Lee: I think the reality is you just have to know and be willing
[01:42:54] Grant Lee: to kind of adopt different frameworks over time
[01:42:56] Grant Lee: and like being honest with yourself with what's working
[01:42:59] Grant Lee: what's not.
[01:43:00] Grant Lee: We're constantly trying to learn and evolve ourselves
[01:43:03] Grant Lee: because I think we're doing it in a way that we don't believe
[01:43:05] it really has been done before.
[01:43:07] Grant Lee: And so we have to kind of pave our own path over time.
[01:43:09] Grant Lee: I love that.
[01:43:10] Lenny Rachitsky: Giving yourself an out when the time comes,
[01:43:12] Lenny Rachitsky: when you need to just hire managers.
[01:43:14] Lenny Rachitsky: A year later, when you invite me back,
[01:43:15] Grant Lee: I'll say, yeah, this will be learning.
[01:43:16] Grant Lee: Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:43:18] Lenny Rachitsky: That's probably going to happen.
[01:43:19] Lenny Rachitsky: It's like people are like, we don't need product managers
[01:43:20] Lenny Rachitsky: and then, I see, maybe we do.
[01:43:23] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:43:25] Lenny Rachitsky: One last piece I want to talk about
[01:43:27] Lenny Rachitsky: is you have this really cool quote that you shared on Twitter.
[01:43:30] Lenny Rachitsky: When you find someone exceptional, bed big on them.
[01:43:33] Lenny Rachitsky: This is a big part of your philosophy is just like bed big
[01:43:35] Lenny Rachitsky: on the people that are doing super well.
[01:43:37] Lenny Rachitsky: Just talk about what that looks like
[01:43:38] Lenny Rachitsky: and why that's so important.
[01:43:40] Yeah, I mean, this starts top of the funnel,
[01:43:42] Grant Lee: which is like you meet candidates,
[01:43:44] Grant Lee: you decide who, you know, you actually hire.
[01:43:47] Grant Lee: And so if you don't start with a high bar there,
[01:43:49] Grant Lee: you know, going back to what is the goal?
[01:43:51] Grant Lee: The goal is to hit a hiring target
[01:43:53] Grant Lee: versus like, you know, maintaining super high quality,
[01:43:55] Grant Lee: you know, hiring bar.
[01:43:57] Grant Lee: Those are different goals.
[01:43:58] Grant Lee: And I don't think we've ever kind of dropped our bar.
[01:44:01] Grant Lee: And so then you bring somebody in
[01:44:02] Grant Lee: that you think is exceptional,
[01:44:03] Grant Lee: that brings something unique to the table,
[01:44:05] Grant Lee: that can be a good teammate when they're thriving.
[01:44:08] Grant Lee: You just give them more and more resources.
[01:44:11] I think what you realize, you know,
[01:44:12] Grant Lee: another sports analogy is like, you know,
[01:44:14] Grant Lee: when you're on a, you know, an A team, for instance,
[01:44:17] Grant Lee: or a team that you feel like is exceptional,
[01:44:19] Grant Lee: you know, A players want actually more playing time.
[01:44:22] Grant Lee: Like you never see a star player that says,
[01:44:24] Grant Lee: actually want less playing time,
[01:44:26] they want more time on the field.
[01:44:27] Grant Lee: They want to actually go after the hardest problems.
[01:44:29] Grant Lee: They want to be able to feel like they're making a huge impact.
[01:44:32] Grant Lee: And so if you have fewer, you know, exceptional teammates,
[01:44:36] Grant Lee: where you can just throw almost anything at them
[01:44:38] Grant Lee: and they'll figure it out.
[01:44:39] Grant Lee: That feels that for, you know,
[01:44:40] Grant Lee: you as a team just feels great
[01:44:42] Grant Lee: because then they, they get what they find rewarding,
[01:44:44] Grant Lee: which is the ability to go after hard, hairy problems
[01:44:47] Grant Lee: and to be able to come out through the other end,
[01:44:49] Grant Lee: feeling like they've accomplished something.
[01:44:51] Grant Lee: And I think that for us has always been something
[01:44:52] Grant Lee: that goes beyond just, you know, almost everything else.
[01:44:56] Grant Lee: Like we give people a chance to really thrive
[01:44:58] Grant Lee: in this environment and we try to nurture that
[01:45:01] Grant Lee: as much as humanly possible every step of the way.
[01:45:03] Grant Lee: Is there anything else around hiring
[01:45:05] Lenny Rachitsky: that you think is really important or big lesson
[01:45:08] Lenny Rachitsky: you've learned or less than you share
[01:45:10] Lenny Rachitsky: that we haven't talked about yet?
[01:45:12] Lenny Rachitsky: I mean, there's some of these intangibles,
[01:45:14] Grant Lee: which is, you know, for the founding team,
[01:45:17] Grant Lee: does this feel like this could be your life's work, right?
[01:45:19] Grant Lee: Like when you're pitching a, when you're pitching
[01:45:22] Grant Lee: a potential candidate, like this is feel like something
[01:45:24] Grant Lee: where you're actually committed.
[01:45:27] Grant Lee: The unfortunate side of a lot of the, you know,
[01:45:29] Grant Lee: what's happening in the AI world broadly is,
[01:45:31] Grant Lee: I think you're coming to learn which founders
[01:45:33] Grant Lee: are sort of missionaries versus mercenaries.
[01:45:36] Grant Lee: And many that were just chasing maybe just a big outcome
[01:45:38] Grant Lee: where like something shiny
[01:45:40] Grant Lee: or like something to feel good about themselves,
[01:45:41] Grant Lee: they'll go off and then the company, you know,
[01:45:43] Grant Lee: I guess doesn't live on or maybe has to find
[01:45:45] Grant Lee: a different way or different path.
[01:45:47] Grant Lee: And so, you know, something I admire is like,
[01:45:50] Grant Lee: you look at some of the founders, obviously,
[01:45:51] Grant Lee: before this sort of AI era, you know,
[01:45:54] Grant Lee: folks like Dylan or Melanie, Figma, Canva,
[01:45:56] Grant Lee: you know, Ivan at Notion,
[01:45:59] they've been doing this for over a decade now.
[01:46:01] Grant Lee: They had many chances of just, you leave and, you know,
[01:46:03] Grant Lee: sunset off into doing whatever they wanted to do,
[01:46:06] Grant Lee: but they care so much about the mission,
[01:46:08] Grant Lee: they've stuck it through.
[01:46:10] And I think when you're talking to candidates,
[01:46:11] Grant Lee: Candace can kind of tell, like is this something
[01:46:13] Grant Lee: like the founders even care about?
[01:46:15] Grant Lee: And I think you're gonna have a better chance of attracting,
[01:46:18] Grant Lee: you know, true missionaries,
[01:46:19] Grant Lee: people that want to build with you for the long haul,
[01:46:21] Grant Lee: if it's authentic and it's something you actually care about.
[01:46:24] Oh man, I feel like, I keep saying this,
[01:46:26] Lenny Rachitsky: I feel like we could have at least five more hours
[01:46:28] Lenny Rachitsky: of stuff to talk about.
[01:46:30] Lenny Rachitsky: That'll be good content for when you come back
[01:46:32] Lenny Rachitsky: and you're making $1 billion a year.
[01:46:36] Lenny Rachitsky: Before we get to our very exciting lightning round,
[01:46:39] Lenny Rachitsky: Grant, is there anything else that you think
[01:46:42] Lenny Rachitsky: is important for people to hear and he'd last,
[01:46:44] Lenny Rachitsky: I don't know, less than you want to double down on anything
[01:46:46] Lenny Rachitsky: you want to leave with his ears with.
[01:46:48] Yeah, I mean, just going back to the original story of,
[01:46:51] Grant Lee: that was probably the ultimate low point,
[01:46:52] Grant Lee: you know, having an investor that spent 20 minutes listening
[01:46:55] Grant Lee: to my pitch, telling me that it was the worst thing,
[01:46:57] Grant Lee: worst idea in the world.
[01:46:59] You know, I think throughout the journey,
[01:47:00] Grant Lee: there's gonna be those low moments.
[01:47:03] Grant Lee: And when I think about, you know, being a founder
[01:47:06] Grant Lee: and working on a startup,
[01:47:08] you're honestly just trying to increase
[01:47:09] Grant Lee: your luck surface area as much as possible.
[01:47:11] Grant Lee: And for me, luck surface area has two dimensions.
[01:47:15] The first dimension is people.
[01:47:18] Who are you surrounding yourself with
[01:47:20] Grant Lee: that share your same ambition, share the same values,
[01:47:24] Grant Lee: same principles and find those people
[01:47:27] Grant Lee: and then give yourself enough time to prove
[01:47:30] Grant Lee: that you guys can, you know, accomplish great things.
[01:47:33] Grant Lee: I'm lucky to have two amazing co-founders.
[01:47:35] Grant Lee: We've been working on this thing for five years.
[01:47:36] Grant Lee: There's zero percent chance we'd be where we are
[01:47:38] Grant Lee: if I didn't have them.
[01:47:40] Grant Lee: And we've had to overcome a lot,
[01:47:41] Grant Lee: but I guess for us, it's like creating that own luck
[01:47:44] Grant Lee: over a long time horizon has been the only way
[01:47:46] Grant Lee: that, you know, it's been possible.
[01:47:48] Well, it's clearly showing
[01:47:49] Lenny Rachitsky: and the success you guys are having grant.
[01:47:52] Lenny Rachitsky: With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning ground.
[01:47:55] Lenny Rachitsky: Are you ready?
[01:47:56] Yep.
[01:47:57] Grant Lee: Yes.
[01:47:57] Grant Lee: All right, I've got five questions for you.
[01:47:59] Lenny Rachitsky: First question, what are two or three books
[01:48:02] Lenny Rachitsky: that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
[01:48:06] Yeah, so I'll give one that's for pre-product market fit,
[01:48:10] Grant Lee: folks, and the one post product.
[01:48:12] Grant Lee: Perfect.
[01:48:13] Grant Lee: Pre-product market fit, I would say, is Shudonc,
[01:48:15] Grant Lee: which is written by Phil Knight, founder of Nike.
[01:48:18] Grant Lee: And, you know, he talks about two things.
[01:48:21] Grant Lee: Like one, you should chase your sort of crazy ideas.
[01:48:24] Grant Lee: But these are, these should be ideas you're passionate about.
[01:48:27] Grant Lee: Like he was an athlete.
[01:48:28] Grant Lee: And so not surprisingly, he focused a lot
[01:48:30] Grant Lee: on about, you know, creating tools or, you know,
[01:48:33] Grant Lee: shoes in this case for other athletes
[01:48:35] Grant Lee: and was passionate about that.
[01:48:37] And the second thing he taught me was going back
[01:48:39] Grant Lee: to the team thing.
[01:48:40] Grant Lee: He surrounded himself with other people
[01:48:41] Grant Lee: that were super passionate about athletics and shoes as well.
[01:48:45] And so the folks that he had as his initial startup crew
[01:48:48] Grant Lee: were all that.
[01:48:49] Grant Lee: And I think that gives you a chance of like overcoming a ton
[01:48:52] Grant Lee: where you're focused on problems you actually care
[01:48:54] Grant Lee: about solving and you're doing with a team
[01:48:56] Grant Lee: that shares the same ambition as you.
[01:48:58] Post product market fit, there's a book called Seven Powers
[01:49:01] Grant Lee: by Hamilton Helmer, where I think when you think about how
[01:49:04] Grant Lee: to build a durable business, there's so much in there.
[01:49:07] Grant Lee: I think there's a lot that you can kind of read
[01:49:09] Grant Lee: and reread as you kind of evolve and kind of hit new milestones
[01:49:12] Grant Lee: yourself.
[01:49:13] Grant Lee: And so much of that can be both tactical,
[01:49:14] Grant Lee: but also like zooming out and thinking about what are the big
[01:49:17] Grant Lee: picture strategic questions you as a founding team
[01:49:19] Grant Lee: you'd be thinking about.
[01:49:20] Grant Lee: So both are great.
[01:49:21] Hamilton was on the podcast,
[01:49:22] Lenny Rachitsky: willing to that episode.
[01:49:24] Lenny Rachitsky: I also love that book.
[01:49:25] Lenny Rachitsky: Many people mentioned it.
[01:49:26] Lenny Rachitsky: Next question.
[01:49:27] Lenny Rachitsky: Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show
[01:49:29] Lenny Rachitsky: you've really enjoyed?
[01:49:31] Yeah.
[01:49:31] The Lazarus project is one, I'm a huge sucker for time travel
[01:49:37] Grant Lee: and sci-fi.
[01:49:38] Grant Lee: So this is one I just started watching.
[01:49:40] Grant Lee: And for me, it has like all the right ingredients
[01:49:42] Grant Lee: for a fun show.
[01:49:44] Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?
[01:49:47] Grant Lee: Yeah, I mentioned this already voice panel.
[01:49:49] Grant Lee: So again, a full disclosure, angel investor.
[01:49:52] Grant Lee: But we've been using it and going back to kind of being
[01:49:55] Grant Lee: a cheat code for folks that are, you know,
[01:49:57] Grant Lee: starting to experiment a ton with different ideas,
[01:50:00] Grant Lee: vibe coding, maybe some of these.
[01:50:02] Like get the sense of the hands of users,
[01:50:03] Grant Lee: share what they think about it.
[01:50:04] Grant Lee: I think an honest, it can help speed up a lot of things
[01:50:07] Grant Lee: and save you time from wasting time on kind of the wrong ideas
[01:50:11] Grant Lee: or ideas where there's no market.
[01:50:13] Grant Lee: Is there a life motto that you often find yourself
[01:50:16] Lenny Rachitsky: going back to and work or in life?
[01:50:18] Yeah.
[01:50:19] Grant Lee: So there is this Chinese idiom that my mom used to say.
[01:50:21] Grant Lee: It's Jean-Deads, which the translation is frog
[01:50:26] Grant Lee: at the bottom of a well.
[01:50:28] Grant Lee: And the story is like there's a frog at the bottom of the well.
[01:50:31] Grant Lee: He looks up every night and he sees the world.
[01:50:33] Grant Lee: And he imagines, he knows everything about the world.
[01:50:37] And then one day a bird comes along and describes
[01:50:39] Grant Lee: all the things that he sees, the ocean, the mountains.
[01:50:44] Grant Lee: And the frog realizes that what he sees
[01:50:46] Grant Lee: is just such a limited part of the world.
[01:50:48] Grant Lee: And you know, the bird asks, like, do you
[01:50:50] Grant Lee: want to come join me and kind of see the rest of it?
[01:50:52] Grant Lee: And so frog goes along.
[01:50:54] Grant Lee: And so for me, you know, I came from, you know,
[01:50:56] Grant Lee: pretty modest childhood, you know, my parents,
[01:50:59] Grant Lee: we didn't have a whole lot.
[01:51:01] Grant Lee: And I think it would have been very easy to kind of have
[01:51:03] Grant Lee: a very narrow kind of lens on the world and be like,
[01:51:05] Grant Lee: oh, this is what it is.
[01:51:07] But my mom never allowed me to do that.
[01:51:09] Grant Lee: She always pulled me to dream much bigger,
[01:51:12] Grant Lee: to say, hey, the world is vast.
[01:51:14] Grant Lee: It's your opportunity to seize it.
[01:51:15] Grant Lee: Like, you have to go out there.
[01:51:17] Grant Lee: Don't have a narrow, you know, view of what's possible.
[01:51:20] Grant Lee: Always dream bigger.
[01:51:21] Grant Lee: And so for me, that's always carried through.
[01:51:24] Grant Lee: And every time I feel like I'm thinking too little
[01:51:25] Grant Lee: or too small, I try to zoom out and remind myself
[01:51:28] Grant Lee: that there's much more out there to go after.
[01:51:30] Grant Lee: That is so good and so important.
[01:51:32] Lenny Rachitsky: And so valuable.
[01:51:33] Lenny Rachitsky: Today's world were so much more as possible.
[01:51:35] Lenny Rachitsky: Just like most of what limits people feels like now
[01:51:38] Lenny Rachitsky: is just, I don't know what the idea I have.
[01:51:40] Lenny Rachitsky: Like, I don't know what to do.
[01:51:41] Lenny Rachitsky: Now you could get things done so much quicker
[01:51:43] Lenny Rachitsky: and so much more as possible.
[01:51:44] Lenny Rachitsky: So that's such valuable thinking.
[01:51:46] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay, final question.
[01:51:48] Lenny Rachitsky: You help people present better.
[01:51:51] Lenny Rachitsky: You know, your tools basically help people
[01:51:52] Lenny Rachitsky: become better presenters.
[01:51:54] Lenny Rachitsky: What's like one tip you've learned
[01:51:55] Lenny Rachitsky: or one tip you teach people to become better presenters?
[01:51:58] Lenny Rachitsky: That might be helpful to listeners.
[01:51:59] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, I mean, we'll go back to the consumer advertising
[01:52:02] Grant Lee: concept, which is, you know, one idea at a time.
[01:52:06] Grant Lee: So, you know, this notion of, you give them one egg,
[01:52:09] Grant Lee: someone can catch it, you give them too many eggs,
[01:52:11] Grant Lee: they're gonna drop it.
[01:52:12] Grant Lee: So don't try to, you throw too many concepts all at once.
[01:52:16] Grant Lee: Keep it simple.
[01:52:17] Grant Lee: People will appreciate it.
[01:52:19] Grant Lee: And so with every sort of presentation,
[01:52:21] Grant Lee: like break it down into the core concepts,
[01:52:23] Grant Lee: try to make sure you're covering one at a time.
[01:52:25] Grant Lee: And I think once you sort of see the through line there,
[01:52:28] Grant Lee: then it becomes easy for a package up
[01:52:30] Grant Lee: and some of that feels more cohesive.
[01:52:32] Lenny Rachitsky: Less is more, as they say.
[01:52:35] Probably.
[01:52:35] Grand two final questions.
[01:52:37] Lenny Rachitsky: Working folks, finding online,
[01:52:38] Lenny Rachitsky: working they find gamma,
[01:52:39] Lenny Rachitsky: what should they know?
[01:52:40] Lenny Rachitsky: That's just like plug anything you want.
[01:52:41] Lenny Rachitsky: And then how can listeners be useful to you?
[01:52:44] Yeah, so you can find me on both Twitter and LinkedIn,
[01:52:46] Grant Lee: DM's open.
[01:52:48] Grant Lee: I honestly hear just knowing how hard the journey is
[01:52:52] Grant Lee: in general, whether just thinking about a startup idea
[01:52:54] Grant Lee: or you're deep into startup land,
[01:52:56] Grant Lee: I wanna be hopefully helpful.
[01:52:58] Grant Lee: I'm giving it a B, hopefully your biggest cheerleader.
[01:53:01] Grant Lee: So let me know I can help.
[01:53:02] Grant Lee: And then for us, we're always looking for feedback.
[01:53:05] Grant Lee: So if you're trying gamma,
[01:53:07] Grant Lee: it's falling short of your expectations.
[01:53:09] Grant Lee: Let us know, we'd love to help
[01:53:10] Grant Lee: in terms of just trying to make it better.
[01:53:12] Grant Lee: And yeah, really appreciate all the feedback
[01:53:14] Grant Lee: and support along the way.
[01:53:16] Grand, this was awesome.
[01:53:17] Lenny Rachitsky: I really appreciate you making time.
[01:53:19] Lenny Rachitsky: I know you're trying to build a crazy fast growing startup
[01:53:21] Lenny Rachitsky: with a lot of going on,
[01:53:22] Lenny Rachitsky: so I really appreciate you making time for this.
[01:53:24] Thanks Lenny, it's been a blast.
[01:53:25] Grant Lee: It's been a blast for me too, bye, everyone.
