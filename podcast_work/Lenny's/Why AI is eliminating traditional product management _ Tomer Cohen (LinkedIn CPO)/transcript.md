[00:00:00] When we look at the skills required to do your job, by 2030, it will change by 70%.
[00:00:05] Tomer Cohen: So whether or not you're looking to change your job, your job is changing.
[00:00:08] Tomer Cohen: In order to stay competitive, you actually have to go back to some first principles,
[00:00:12] Tomer Cohen: go back to the drawing board and reimagine what it means to be building.
[00:00:15] Tomer Cohen: You're experimenting with a very different way of building product at LinkedIn that
[00:00:22] Lenny Rachitsky: full embraces what AI and locks.
[00:00:24] Lenny Rachitsky: We call it the full stack builder model.
[00:00:26] Tomer Cohen: The goal itself is to empower great builders to take their idea and to take it to market,
[00:00:31] Tomer Cohen: regardless of their role in the stack and which team they're on.
[00:00:34] Tomer Cohen: It's really a fluid interaction between human and machine.
[00:00:37] Tomer Cohen: This feels like this could be a model for how a lot of companies operate and how product
[00:00:40] Lenny Rachitsky: ends up being built in the future.
[00:00:42] Lenny Rachitsky: Change management here is going to be a critical part,
[00:00:44] Tomer Cohen: but it's done enough to give them the tools.
[00:00:46] Tomer Cohen: You have to build the incentive programs, the motivation, the examples to how you do it.
[00:00:51] Tomer Cohen: I see a lot of companies roll out their agents and just expecting companies to adapt.
[00:00:55] Tomer Cohen: Doesn't work this way.
[00:00:56] Tomer Cohen: There's always been this question.
[00:00:56] Tomer Cohen: Is AI going to just make people better, not amazing, more amazing, or is it going to make amazing people even more amazing?
[00:01:01] Lenny Rachitsky: Top talent has the tendency of continuously trying to get better at their craft.
[00:01:05] Tomer Cohen: The key traits that I'm emphasizing for builders is
[00:01:11] Today my guest is Tomor Cohen, longtime chief product officer at LinkedIn,
[00:01:16] Lenny Rachitsky: who is piloting a new way of building that I think will become a model for how companies operate in the future.
[00:01:22] Lenny Rachitsky: It's called the full stack builder program.
[00:01:24] Lenny Rachitsky: And essentially the idea is to enable anyone, no matter their function, to take products from idea to launch.
[00:01:31] Lenny Rachitsky: They've scrapped their APM program and replaced it with an associate full stack builder program.
[00:01:37] Lenny Rachitsky: They've introduced a new career path with the title full stack builder that anyone from any function can become.
[00:01:43] Lenny Rachitsky: And as you'll hear in the conversation, they've built a bunch of internal tools and agents and processes
[00:01:48] Lenny Rachitsky: to basically build a human plus AI product team that can move really fast,
[00:01:52] Lenny Rachitsky: adjust to change quickly, and do a lot more with a lot less.
[00:01:56] Lenny Rachitsky: If you're looking for inspiration for how to rethink how your team operates,
[00:02:00] Lenny Rachitsky: and to lean into what AI is unlocking for teams and companies, this episode is for you.

[00:02:48] Lenny Rachitsky: You know what we don't love talking about?
[00:02:50] Lenny Rachitsky: Sock 2.
[00:02:51] Lenny Rachitsky: That's where Vanta comes in.
[00:02:52] Lenny Rachitsky: Vanta helps companies of all sizes get compliant fast and stay that way

[00:03:17] Lenny Rachitsky: The result?
[00:03:18] Lenny Rachitsky: According to a recent IDC study,
[00:03:20] Lenny Rachitsky: Vanta customers slashed over 500,000 dollars a year
[00:03:25] Lenny Rachitsky: and are three times more productive.

[00:03:36] This episode is brought to you by Figma,
[00:03:38] Lenny Rachitsky: Makers of Figma Make.
[00:03:40] Lenny Rachitsky: When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out
[00:03:44] Lenny Rachitsky: and how much it improved how we operated as a team.
[00:03:47] Lenny Rachitsky: Suddenly, I could involve my whole team in the design process,
[00:03:50] Lenny Rachitsky: give feedback on design concepts really quickly,
[00:03:52] Lenny Rachitsky: and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun.
[00:03:55] Lenny Rachitsky: But Figma never felt like it was for me.
[00:03:58] Lenny Rachitsky: It was great for giving feedback and designs,
[00:04:00] Lenny Rachitsky: but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff.
[00:04:03] Lenny Rachitsky: That's why Figma built Figma Make.
[00:04:05] Lenny Rachitsky: With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design
[00:04:09] Lenny Rachitsky: into a fully functional prototype or app
[00:04:11] Lenny Rachitsky: that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers.
[00:04:14] Lenny Rachitsky: Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool.
[00:04:17] Lenny Rachitsky: Because it's all in Figma,
[00:04:18] Lenny Rachitsky: you can use your team's existing design building blocks,
[00:04:21] Lenny Rachitsky: making it easy to create outputs that look good
[00:04:24] Lenny Rachitsky: and feel real and are connected to how your team builds.
[00:04:27] Lenny Rachitsky: Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision
[00:04:31] Lenny Rachitsky: and instead show it to them.
[00:04:32] Lenny Rachitsky: Make code back prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make.

[00:04:42] Tomor, thank you so much for being here.
[00:04:43] Lenny Rachitsky: Welcome to the podcast.
[00:04:45] Lenny Rachitsky: Thank you. It's great to be back.
[00:04:46] Lenny Rachitsky: It's great to have you back.
[00:04:48] Lenny Rachitsky: I'm really excited to be chatting because
[00:04:51] Lenny Rachitsky: you're experimenting with a very different way of building product at LinkedIn
[00:04:57] Lenny Rachitsky: that fully embraces what AI and locks
[00:05:00] Lenny Rachitsky: kind of leans into what is now possible.
[00:05:03] Lenny Rachitsky: To me, this can be a model for how a lot of companies operate
[00:05:06] Lenny Rachitsky: and how product ends up being built in the future.
[00:05:09] Lenny Rachitsky: There's a lot of product leaders that are talking about AI,
[00:05:11] Lenny Rachitsky: what they can do.
[00:05:12] Lenny Rachitsky: It feels like you're actually doing this in a really,
[00:05:14] Lenny Rachitsky: really radical way.
[00:05:15] Lenny Rachitsky: I'm excited to learn from you to hear about this for listeners
[00:05:19] Lenny Rachitsky: to understand what you're seeing,
[00:05:21] Lenny Rachitsky: what you've learned.
[00:05:23] Lenny Rachitsky: Let me start with just why did you decide this was necessary?
[00:05:26] Lenny Rachitsky: Why are you rethinking all of these things
[00:05:28] Lenny Rachitsky: about how product is built for a long time?
[00:05:30] Lenny Rachitsky: AKA why do people need to pay attention to what we're about to be talking about?
[00:05:34] Lenny Rachitsky: It really starts with kind of the basics.
[00:05:36] Tomer Cohen: For me, technology has always been about empowerment.
[00:05:39] Tomer Cohen: It's not about what it does for us,
[00:05:41] Tomer Cohen: it's about what it enables us to do.
[00:05:43] Tomer Cohen: And now we have this amazing opportunity in my mind
[00:05:45] Tomer Cohen: to make it about the retocracy.
[00:05:47] Tomer Cohen: And I think it's an opportunity,
[00:05:49] Tomer Cohen: but it's also an necessity right now.
[00:05:50] Tomer Cohen: And I want to put this in context where we're entering this phase
[00:05:54] Tomer Cohen: where the time constant of change is far greater
[00:05:58] Tomer Cohen: than the time constant of response.
[00:06:00] Tomer Cohen: Basically means that change is happening faster
[00:06:02] Tomer Cohen: than we're able to respond to it.
[00:06:04] Tomer Cohen: Now, you know, LinkedIn has this unique view of the world of work.
[00:06:08] Tomer Cohen: So we actually have some pretty, in my mind,
[00:06:10] Tomer Cohen: bind blowing stats to kind of put this in perspective.
[00:06:13] Tomer Cohen: When we look at like the skills required to do your job,
[00:06:17] by 2030, which is literally four years from now,
[00:06:20] Tomer Cohen: it sounds a long time, but 40 years from now,
[00:06:22] Tomer Cohen: it will change by 70%.
[00:06:25] So whether or not you're looking to change your job,
[00:06:28] Tomer Cohen: your job is changing.
[00:06:29] Tomer Cohen: The only question is, do you keep it?
[00:06:31] Tomer Cohen: And then we look at the organizationally,
[00:06:33] Tomer Cohen: the fastest growing jobs right now,
[00:06:36] Tomer Cohen: the most in demand jobs in the market are growing by north of 70%
[00:06:40] Tomer Cohen: from last year's fastest growing jobs.
[00:06:42] Tomer Cohen: So there's a new kind of iteration
[00:06:45] Tomer Cohen: of what you need an organization to thrive.
[00:06:47] Tomer Cohen: And then you apply that to building products.
[00:06:49] Tomer Cohen: And you realize that in order to stay competitive,
[00:06:52] Tomer Cohen: you actually have to go back to some first principles,
[00:06:55] Tomer Cohen: go back to the drawing board and reimagine what it means to be building.
[00:06:58] Tomer Cohen: And what I love about this is when you think about the role of a builder,
[00:07:02] Tomer Cohen: which the builders are the heart of the company,
[00:07:05] the goal is actually quite simple.
[00:07:07] Tomer Cohen: The builder takes an A.D. and she brings it to life.
[00:07:10] Tomer Cohen: That's really the process, right?
[00:07:11] Tomer Cohen: And we all build those, let's call them like best practices.
[00:07:14] Tomer Cohen: You research the problem really well,
[00:07:16] Tomer Cohen: you speak it out, you design it, you code it,
[00:07:18] Tomer Cohen: you launch it and you iterate.
[00:07:20] Tomer Cohen: That's kind of, that's basically it.
[00:07:22] Tomer Cohen: But what happens at many at-scale companies,
[00:07:25] Tomer Cohen: LinkedIn included in many other companies,
[00:07:28] Tomer Cohen: over time that process became very complex very quickly.
[00:07:32] So what happened?
[00:07:32] We took every step and we expanded it to a lot of sub-steps.
[00:07:37] Tomer Cohen: Researching, the problem became looking at for us,
[00:07:40] Tomer Cohen: 10 to 15 sources of information.
[00:07:43] Tomer Cohen: Obviously talking to customers by doing data pools,
[00:07:45] Tomer Cohen: looking at feedback tickets,
[00:07:47] Tomer Cohen: in multiple sources, social media,
[00:07:50] Tomer Cohen: interactions with customers.
[00:07:51] Tomer Cohen: We probably have 10 to 15 sources of information we go for
[00:07:54] Tomer Cohen: before we kind of feel like we have research department really, really well.
[00:07:58] Think about reviews for product.
[00:07:59] Tomer Cohen: There is design reviews, privacy reviews,
[00:08:01] Tomer Cohen: security reviews, I can go on and on and on.
[00:08:04] Tomer Cohen: And each one of those sub-steps actually has a valid reason to exist.
[00:08:07] Tomer Cohen: But when you add a whole thing together, you're like,
[00:08:09] Tomer Cohen: oh my god, this is why it takes to build a small feature,
[00:08:13] Tomer Cohen: multiple teams, multiple code bases, multiple sprints,
[00:08:16] Tomer Cohen: just to get it out to launch and not talk about iterating,
[00:08:19] Tomer Cohen: which is actually where you're sick success.
[00:08:20] Tomer Cohen: You never see success in the launch itself.
[00:08:23] So really, the work itself is not complex,
[00:08:25] Tomer Cohen: but the process we made very complex.
[00:08:27] Tomer Cohen: And when I was digging in, I found it doesn't end there.
[00:08:31] Tomer Cohen: Because somebody has to do all those sub-steps.
[00:08:34] Tomer Cohen: So what happened is you actually move from process complexity
[00:08:38] Tomer Cohen: to organizational complexity as well.
[00:08:41] And then you actually led to micro-specialization.
[00:08:43] Tomer Cohen: All those sub-steps are dying by doing by somebody specific.
[00:08:47] Tomer Cohen: So from one build there, we have multiple functions.
[00:08:50] Tomer Cohen: Obviously we have engineering, product and design.
[00:08:52] Tomer Cohen: And you can start questioning those lines.
[00:08:55] At least I am internally.
[00:08:57] Tomer Cohen: And from there, we have a lot of sub-specialties.
[00:09:01] Tomer Cohen: It happens in every one of those functions.
[00:09:02] Tomer Cohen: But imagine design, we have interaction, design and animation,
[00:09:05] Tomer Cohen: design, content design, research,
[00:09:06] Tomer Cohen: there's so many aspects to that.
[00:09:08] Tomer Cohen: So they're all valid, but they all have people.
[00:09:12] Tomer Cohen: And that entire process basically means a lot of,
[00:09:16] Tomer Cohen: it's basically bloating, it's complexity.
[00:09:18] Tomer Cohen: And then without noticing, you end up with this massively complex.
[00:09:21] Tomer Cohen: We actually have this diagram that basically shows the process complexity,
[00:09:24] Tomer Cohen: organizational complexity together.
[00:09:26] And usually people are like mind blown because they're working on one thing very specific,
[00:09:30] Tomer Cohen: but when you zoom out, you have this overwhelming experience you're kind of thinking about.
[00:09:36] Tomer Cohen: And now we have this real opportunity to collapse the stack backup,
[00:09:39] Tomer Cohen: go back to craftmanship, rethink the product development lifecycle,
[00:09:44] Tomer Cohen: which is where the full stack builder model comes to life.
[00:09:47] Wow, okay, there's so much here.
[00:09:49] Lenny Rachitsky: We're going to be showing the visuals as you talk to,
[00:09:52] Lenny Rachitsky: help people see what you're explaining here.
[00:09:54] Lenny Rachitsky: And all of this is very rational.
[00:09:56] Lenny Rachitsky: Like if you have 15 sources of information,
[00:09:58] Lenny Rachitsky: like why not pull from it?
[00:10:00] Lenny Rachitsky: Like why miss out on that stuff?
[00:10:02] Lenny Rachitsky: And what you're describing here is as you get more power and more special,
[00:10:06] Lenny Rachitsky: like it all makes sense rationally,
[00:10:07] Lenny Rachitsky: but when you start to step back and look at this,
[00:10:09] Lenny Rachitsky: like holy shit, it takes six months to launch one feature.
[00:10:13] Lenny Rachitsky: I want to ask about the stat you shared.
[00:10:14] Lenny Rachitsky: I think this is an incredibly powerful stat,
[00:10:16] Lenny Rachitsky: and you have very unique data here to tell you this sort of stuff.
[00:10:21] Lenny Rachitsky: So you said that's something like 70% of the skills
[00:10:24] Lenny Rachitsky: that people will need in the future are going to change.
[00:10:28] Lenny Rachitsky: To do their current job.
[00:10:29] Lenny Rachitsky: To do their current job.
[00:10:31] Lenny Rachitsky: And what is this looking at?
[00:10:32] Lenny Rachitsky: Is this just like based on historical data?
[00:10:34] Lenny Rachitsky: Or how do you how do you find that?
[00:10:36] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, to be fair, there was always a change, right?
[00:10:38] Tomer Cohen: So it was never about just, you know,
[00:10:40] Tomer Cohen: just keep the skills you have today.
[00:10:42] Tomer Cohen: But we've never seen such a traumatic part of,
[00:10:45] Tomer Cohen: of, you know, of your world today.
[00:10:48] Tomer Cohen: So, you know, whether you are a marketer right now,
[00:10:51] Tomer Cohen: or a seller or a recruiter and engineer, you know,
[00:10:53] Tomer Cohen: engineering is where a lot of the investment is going in right now,
[00:10:57] Tomer Cohen: in terms of agents.
[00:10:59] Tomer Cohen: Those, those jobs will change dramatically.
[00:11:02] You know, I remember I said my role, my life as an engineer,
[00:11:05] Tomer Cohen: and you know, even then it's changed material after 10 years.
[00:11:09] Tomer Cohen: And then the change we're seeing right now,
[00:11:10] Tomer Cohen: just thinking about in four years,
[00:11:12] Tomer Cohen: what do they take to actually engineer really, really well,
[00:11:14] Tomer Cohen: would be dramatically different,
[00:11:16] Tomer Cohen: or to build software, to build an artifact of some sort.
[00:11:18] Tomer Cohen: But it's true for almost every function.
[00:11:20] Tomer Cohen: It's not equal, you know, some job like nurses will see less impact,
[00:11:25] Tomer Cohen: but some jobs will see 90, 95% impact.
[00:11:28] Tomer Cohen: There's also a stat that I don't think you mentioned here
[00:11:30] Lenny Rachitsky: that I saw on the post when you first talked about this program,
[00:11:33] Lenny Rachitsky: is that 70% of today's fastest growing jobs
[00:11:35] Lenny Rachitsky: were not even on the list of jobs a year ago.
[00:11:39] Yeah, it was, it was, no, so that, yes,
[00:11:41] Tomer Cohen: so this is the fastest growing job on the list were not there a year ago.
[00:11:44] Tomer Cohen: And then many of them not even exist,
[00:11:47] Tomer Cohen: you know, a decade or two ago.
[00:11:50] There's actually some pretty amazing stats across the board.
[00:11:52] Tomer Cohen: Okay, so let's talk about this program that you built.
[00:11:56] Lenny Rachitsky: Tell us the name, and then tell us the kind of a gist of what it is today
[00:12:00] Lenny Rachitsky: and the vision of where you want it to be.
[00:12:02] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, so we call it the full stack builder model.
[00:12:06] Tomer Cohen: And the goal always started, the goal,
[00:12:09] Tomer Cohen: the goal itself is to empower great builders,
[00:12:11] Tomer Cohen: to take their idea and to take it to market,
[00:12:14] Tomer Cohen: regardless of their role and the stack and, you know,
[00:12:17] Tomer Cohen: specifically which team they're on.
[00:12:19] Tomer Cohen: And the kind of the idea ultimately is to be able for that builder
[00:12:25] Tomer Cohen: is to develop experiences and to end,
[00:12:27] Tomer Cohen: to combine skills and expertise of what,
[00:12:30] Tomer Cohen: across what was traditional distinct domains,
[00:12:32] Tomer Cohen: to bring it all together.
[00:12:34] Tomer Cohen: And it's not a sequence of steps.
[00:12:35] Tomer Cohen: It's really a fluid interaction between human and machine.
[00:12:38] Tomer Cohen: That's how the way I see it.
[00:12:39] Tomer Cohen: And then when you look back at that product development lifecycle
[00:12:42] Tomer Cohen: from the idea, the insight all the way to launch,
[00:12:46] Tomer Cohen: the key trait that I'm emphasizing for builders is
[00:12:51] Tomer Cohen: where I want them to spend their time is where I think great builders should shine in.
[00:12:54] Tomer Cohen: So the idea of vision coming up with a compelling stance about the future,
[00:12:59] empathy, super critical, having a profound understanding of an admet need.
[00:13:04] Tomer Cohen: Communication is critical.
[00:13:06] Tomer Cohen: And we see this a lot in job descriptions right now for almost every wall.
[00:13:09] Tomer Cohen: But the ability for you to align and rally adders others around an idea.
[00:13:14] Tomer Cohen: Creativity, which for me is about coming up with possibilities beyond the obvious.
[00:13:20] Tomer Cohen: For example, I don't think AI yet is a great of creativity.
[00:13:23] Tomer Cohen: I think it's kind of in many ways brings back the things you might not know about.
[00:13:27] Tomer Cohen: But it's not the kind of next level creativity,
[00:13:30] Tomer Cohen: which I think still humans are much better at.
[00:13:33] Tomer Cohen: And then ultimately, what I think is the most important trait for a builder is judgment.
[00:13:38] Tomer Cohen: That's some people call it test making.
[00:13:40] Tomer Cohen: But it's making high quality decisions in what is complex,
[00:13:44] Tomer Cohen: ambiguous situations.
[00:13:45] Tomer Cohen: Everything else, I'm working really hard to automate.
[00:13:48] Tomer Cohen: Really, really hard.
[00:13:49] Tomer Cohen: And then when you think about the outcome,
[00:13:52] Tomer Cohen: it's not just about having more shots of the goal,
[00:13:54] Tomer Cohen: which I think people go like the iterations speed is going to be very high.
[00:13:57] Tomer Cohen: Yes.
[00:13:58] Tomer Cohen: But what you're really doing to an organization,
[00:14:01] Tomer Cohen: the scale of an ad-scale organization,
[00:14:03] Tomer Cohen: is there a lot more nimble, a lot more adaptive,
[00:14:06] Tomer Cohen: a lot more resilient.
[00:14:08] Tomer Cohen: They can navigate the future.
[00:14:09] Tomer Cohen: They can actually match the pace of change to the pace of response.
[00:14:13] Tomer Cohen: And the knowledge I have in mind is kind of Navy SEALs.
[00:14:16] Tomer Cohen: You come to training,
[00:14:18] Tomer Cohen: they're all kind of learning their cross-trained,
[00:14:20] Tomer Cohen: across multiple areas.
[00:14:22] Tomer Cohen: What they specialize in is the mission.
[00:14:26] And they operate in small parts.
[00:14:28] Tomer Cohen: And they're very nimble.
[00:14:29] Tomer Cohen: And you can assemble them very quickly.
[00:14:30] Tomer Cohen: And I think that's going to be the organization that will win in the future.
[00:14:33] Okay.
[00:14:34] Lenny Rachitsky: So the kind of simple idea,
[00:14:36] Lenny Rachitsky: if you're just a boiler down to a sentence,
[00:14:38] Lenny Rachitsky: the idea here is there's a builder who goes through the entire product development process,
[00:14:42] Lenny Rachitsky: essentially on their own.
[00:14:43] Lenny Rachitsky: They have an idea, they research the data,
[00:14:45] Lenny Rachitsky: they prototype design,
[00:14:47] Lenny Rachitsky: ship, that's kind of like the vision of where this goes.
[00:14:50] Lenny Rachitsky: Yes, but there's have to be on their own.
[00:14:52] Tomer Cohen: It's not like it's not, I still believe in teams.
[00:14:54] Tomer Cohen: It's just smaller teams.
[00:14:56] Lenny Rachitsky: Smaller teams and much more focus on the problem,
[00:14:59] Tomer Cohen: the mission per se versus,
[00:15:02] Tomer Cohen: actually one of the things we've done,
[00:15:03] Tomer Cohen: as an example, we kind of started to do the idea of pods.
[00:15:07] Tomer Cohen: We're no longer large teams.
[00:15:08] Tomer Cohen: We assemble a team,
[00:15:10] Tomer Cohen: ideally a full stack builder is coming together.
[00:15:13] Tomer Cohen: And you know, it's less about,
[00:15:15] Tomer Cohen: can I have an engineer design,
[00:15:16] Tomer Cohen: PM working together and trying to combine this trio,
[00:15:19] Tomer Cohen: rooting a focus can flex across.
[00:15:21] Tomer Cohen: And then they tackle something for a quarter or so.
[00:15:24] Tomer Cohen: And then we kind of reassemble those two different pods.
[00:15:27] Tomer Cohen: That's like one example of an event manifestation we're doing right now.
[00:15:30] Tomer Cohen: And seeing actually some great success.
[00:15:32] Tomer Cohen: And both in terms of velocity,
[00:15:34] Tomer Cohen: but also in terms of that focus and nimbleness of that team.
[00:15:36] Tomer Cohen: And it feels like the goal here,
[00:15:38] Lenny Rachitsky: in which you're trying to adjust and that broke
[00:15:41] Lenny Rachitsky: as teams bloated as speed and adaptability and flexibility,
[00:15:46] Lenny Rachitsky: because going back to your original point,
[00:15:49] Lenny Rachitsky: that change is happening so much more quickly now,
[00:15:52] Lenny Rachitsky: that companies that have been building in this traditional way,
[00:15:54] Lenny Rachitsky: just can't compete.
[00:15:56] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, it's not that you have to break the model.
[00:15:58] Tomer Cohen: I think the model is broken.
[00:15:59] Tomer Cohen: It's just this pace of change is helping us
[00:16:02] Tomer Cohen: realize it.
[00:16:03] Tomer Cohen: Okay, so then going back to the things that these builders still do
[00:16:07] Lenny Rachitsky: versus what you want to automate.
[00:16:08] Lenny Rachitsky: So the list you shared is they're responsible for the vision,
[00:16:12] Lenny Rachitsky: empathy, communication, creativity and judgment.
[00:16:16] Lenny Rachitsky: Yes.
[00:16:16] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, and I would put a lot of the focus on the latter.
[00:16:19] Tomer Cohen: I think the kind of if you ask me at the end of the day,
[00:16:23] Tomer Cohen: what's the kind of most important trait that would say it's that judgment
[00:16:25] Tomer Cohen: testmaking ability?
[00:16:27] Tomer Cohen: And then in terms of what you're automating,
[00:16:29] Lenny Rachitsky: what are some of the areas you've seen a lot of success
[00:16:32] Lenny Rachitsky: in actually automating and where do you think this goes?
[00:16:35] Yeah, so I think just to kind of break it to pieces,
[00:16:38] Tomer Cohen: and I think this is, you know, if you were a startup right now,
[00:16:41] Tomer Cohen: you know, in many ways you can start this way, right?
[00:16:44] Tomer Cohen: You can, there's no legacy code, there's no legacy structure.
[00:16:48] Tomer Cohen: You run and in fact, a lot of the startups I talk to
[00:16:51] Tomer Cohen: that are built a, a natively, they're they don't,
[00:16:54] Tomer Cohen: they're just working at full stock builders.
[00:16:56] Tomer Cohen: That's the way they start.
[00:16:58] If you're at a company at the scale of hours and many others
[00:17:02] Tomer Cohen: in the market, in the market, you're like,
[00:17:04] Tomer Cohen: this is the most like a new production function and mindset
[00:17:08] Tomer Cohen: that you have to do.
[00:17:09] Tomer Cohen: And there's really three components that we're working on.
[00:17:12] Tomer Cohen: One is platform, the second one is the tools and the agents.
[00:17:15] Tomer Cohen: And lastly is the culture.
[00:17:18] The platform one, this is the kind of level of investment you have to do before,
[00:17:22] Tomer Cohen: to before this actually starts, you start to see all the benefits come accrue.
[00:17:26] Tomer Cohen: But the platform for us as an example is re-architecting all of our core platform,
[00:17:30] Tomer Cohen: so AI can reason over it.
[00:17:32] Tomer Cohen: So we're building kind of this composable UI components
[00:17:36] Tomer Cohen: with server side that we actually build.
[00:17:38] Tomer Cohen: We're basically building for AI to be ready to bring it in.
[00:17:41] Tomer Cohen: So you can't just go and bring a third party tool
[00:17:44] Tomer Cohen: and have it work on the LinkedIn stack.
[00:17:46] Tomer Cohen: In fact, that's one of our biggest learnings.
[00:17:48] Tomer Cohen: It never works.
[00:17:49] Tomer Cohen: Never works.
[00:17:50] Tomer Cohen: You have to bring it in and customize a lot of it,
[00:17:54] Tomer Cohen: working almost in alpha mode with those companies to make it work internally.
[00:17:58] Tomer Cohen: So this is essentially re-architecting your code base
[00:18:01] Lenny Rachitsky: to work more efficiently with AI.
[00:18:03] Lenny Rachitsky: Is that one way to think about it?
[00:18:04] Lenny Rachitsky: Yes.
[00:18:04] Lenny Rachitsky: And in many ways, working with those companies to adjust something in their stack
[00:18:10] Tomer Cohen: to work with our stack as well.
[00:18:11] Tomer Cohen: So that's how we say those companies, meaning like the development agents,
[00:18:14] Lenny Rachitsky: like cursors and depends and such.
[00:18:16] Lenny Rachitsky: Yes, and like, or Figma on design.
[00:18:18] Tomer Cohen: We can figure out the design systems is another example of that.
[00:18:22] Tomer Cohen: But you have to have that back and forth because they're not.
[00:18:25] In many ways, we haven't seen anybody be able to work off the shelf.
[00:18:28] Tomer Cohen: Immediately on our code base design systems and unique
[00:18:32] Tomer Cohen: context we have.
[00:18:33] Tomer Cohen: Just to follow that thread briefly, so there's Figma, that's interesting.
[00:18:36] Lenny Rachitsky: So basically, the way Figma exports and keeps your design system
[00:18:39] Lenny Rachitsky: that has to change to work better with AI is what I'm saying.
[00:18:41] Lenny Rachitsky: They first need to know how to work with our design systems,
[00:18:44] Tomer Cohen: which is something there's, there are, you know,
[00:18:46] Tomer Cohen: in many ways a lot of those companies are working on.
[00:18:48] Tomer Cohen: Same with coding.
[00:18:48] Tomer Cohen: You need, you can't, it doesn't work that you just bring it in
[00:18:52] Tomer Cohen: and it just reasons over your code base.
[00:18:54] Tomer Cohen: Really, but we tried.
[00:18:55] Tomer Cohen: You have to build, we are building that layer that basically allows it to do.
[00:18:58] Tomer Cohen: So whether it's co-pilot or cursor, Windsor, and so on.
[00:19:02] Tomer Cohen: Got it.
[00:19:03] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay, oh yeah, co-pilot, Microsoft, I get it, I get it.
[00:19:06] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay.
[00:19:07] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay, so that's the platform.
[00:19:10] Lenny Rachitsky: So that's an investment that you guys have to make to make AI effective
[00:19:14] Lenny Rachitsky: at building and doing all these things.
[00:19:16] Lenny Rachitsky: And then you have tools.
[00:19:17] Tomer Cohen: So tools is where you really build the agents.
[00:19:20] Tomer Cohen: I mentioned I want to automate everything outside of those five traits
[00:19:22] Tomer Cohen: that we talked about and then we're building a tool for that.
[00:19:25] Tomer Cohen: And then for that, actually very similarly, I can't just bring a tool
[00:19:28] Tomer Cohen: from the outside and work.
[00:19:29] Tomer Cohen: So give you an example.
[00:19:30] Tomer Cohen: We're building one of our biggest things is building a trust agent.
[00:19:34] Tomer Cohen: We trust is really important for us at LinkedIn.
[00:19:38] Tomer Cohen: There's a lot of unique vectors which trust plays at LinkedIn,
[00:19:42] Tomer Cohen: doesn't play at anywhere else.
[00:19:43] Tomer Cohen: So we need to bring all of that know-how and context and
[00:19:48] Tomer Cohen: information base into that agent.
[00:19:50] Tomer Cohen: So we ended up building our own trust agent at LinkedIn.
[00:19:53] Tomer Cohen: And so what is this trust agent doing?
[00:19:55] Lenny Rachitsky: Telling you when you may be exposing information.
[00:19:57] Lenny Rachitsky: When you build a spec, you build an idea,
[00:19:59] Tomer Cohen: you walk through the trust agents and they'll basically tell you
[00:20:01] Tomer Cohen: what are your vulnerabilities, what harm vectors potentially you're
[00:20:07] Tomer Cohen: introducing or will be introduced as a result of that.
[00:20:09] Tomer Cohen: And I had our head of trust build it.
[00:20:11] Tomer Cohen: So the head of craft for every area is building their own agent.
[00:20:16] Tomer Cohen: As an example, we took, we have one of our features for job seekers
[00:20:20] Tomer Cohen: is called Open to Work.
[00:20:21] Tomer Cohen: If you're looking for a job, you can put an open to work.
[00:20:23] Tomer Cohen: Yeah, a little green, exactly.
[00:20:25] Lenny Rachitsky: And actually it's a great signal.
[00:20:27] Tomer Cohen: I've seen some great success from it.
[00:20:28] Tomer Cohen: People are helping each other to community really thrive around
[00:20:31] Tomer Cohen: helping each other.
[00:20:32] Tomer Cohen: But at the same time, it introduces a trust vector for bad actors.
[00:20:37] Tomer Cohen: Because they're open to work.
[00:20:39] Tomer Cohen: People are looking for a job are potentially more vulnerable
[00:20:43] Tomer Cohen: to scams than other folks.
[00:20:45] Tomer Cohen: So being able to think about how do we prevent all of those ahead of time.
[00:20:48] Tomer Cohen: So we walked that spec from a couple of years ago through the Chast
[00:20:52] Tomer Cohen: agent.
[00:20:53] Tomer Cohen: Not only was it able to find all the stuff we initiated at the beginning,
[00:20:56] Tomer Cohen: but all the holes that we did not catch until later.
[00:21:00] Tomer Cohen: So let's take a great example of something that actually worked really well.
[00:21:03] Tomer Cohen: That's one.
[00:21:04] Tomer Cohen: The other one is a growth agent as an example.
[00:21:07] Tomer Cohen: Again, LinkedIn has a very unique,
[00:21:10] Tomer Cohen: actually one of our, we have an incredible growth team,
[00:21:12] Tomer Cohen: growth process.
[00:21:14] Tomer Cohen: We've kind of funneled all of our unique loops,
[00:21:17] Tomer Cohen: our funnels, our tests of the fast, everything into this growth agent.
[00:21:20] Tomer Cohen: And now you can basically rock your respect for it, your idea for it.
[00:21:24] Tomer Cohen: And it will not just allow you to do it better,
[00:21:27] Tomer Cohen: it will actually critique how good is your idea.
[00:21:30] Tomer Cohen: This is something we cannot bring off the shelf.
[00:21:32] Tomer Cohen: It's very unique to LinkedIn.
[00:21:34] So we had to invest dramatically in it.
[00:21:37] Tomer Cohen: And one team which is using it right now,
[00:21:40] Tomer Cohen: which is almost,
[00:21:43] Tomer Cohen: I wasn't thinking about at the beginning,
[00:21:45] Tomer Cohen: but our UXR team, our UER team,
[00:21:47] Tomer Cohen: the user research team is usually using that growth agent to understand
[00:21:52] Tomer Cohen: out of all the things they're basically surfacing for members,
[00:21:54] Tomer Cohen: which one has the biggest growth opportunities to have the biggest impact.
[00:21:59] Tomer Cohen: That was not in the cards when we thought about that idea,
[00:22:01] Tomer Cohen: but teams are basically funneling those ideas into this one.
[00:22:05] Tomer Cohen: An example is a research agent.
[00:22:07] Tomer Cohen: So research agent basically is trained on the personas of our members.
[00:22:13] Tomer Cohen: You can think about a small business owner, a job seeker, and so on.
[00:22:17] Tomer Cohen: And it's not just world knowledge, it's using all the research that I've done in the past,
[00:22:23] Tomer Cohen: all the support tickets coming in.
[00:22:26] Tomer Cohen: It's pretty good at understanding that persona at LinkedIn.
[00:22:29] Tomer Cohen: So one example we had is a team came back with a spec,
[00:22:33] with a warrant aware we had the research agent yet.
[00:22:35] Tomer Cohen: I asked the research agent for a small business owner,
[00:22:39] Tomer Cohen: what did you think about the marketing spec we had?
[00:22:42] Tomer Cohen: And it predicted it's really well actually in many ways shifted the direction of the team to
[00:22:46] Tomer Cohen: focus on other integration tools we can focus on.
[00:22:50] Tomer Cohen: But it's very hard to have that visibility all to all that corpus of knowledge inside of the
[00:22:54] Tomer Cohen: company. That's another example. We have an analyst agent trained on all like how you basically
[00:22:59] Tomer Cohen: can query the entire LinkedIn graph, which is enormous.
[00:23:03] Tomer Cohen: Instead of relying on your SQL queries or data science teams,
[00:23:07] Tomer Cohen: you can use the analyst agent.
[00:23:09] Tomer Cohen: All of those I would say are I would call them still MVP plus plus.
[00:23:13] Tomer Cohen: The goal for us in the next couple of months to basically world them out externally.
[00:23:17] Tomer Cohen: So we are in internal at LinkedIn.
[00:23:19] Tomer Cohen: Yeah, not as the new product lines.
[00:23:22] Lenny Rachitsky: Okay, so many questions.
[00:23:23] Lenny Rachitsky: When is just how are you building this like is there a platform for
[00:23:25] Lenny Rachitsky: be using? What does it take to build an agent at LinkedIn?
[00:23:28] Lenny Rachitsky: Is it all internal tools or is there third party use?
[00:23:31] Lenny Rachitsky: It's a great call. So I think we've been experimenting with a lot of tools.
[00:23:34] Tomer Cohen: And I would say for a lot of those kind of knowledge corpus agents,
[00:23:38] Tomer Cohen: we're using everything from co-pilot enterprise to
[00:23:41] Tomer Cohen: Chachi PT enterprise by far though, the most important part was basically
[00:23:46] Tomer Cohen: our own customization of it. That's been where we saw the biggest gains.
[00:23:50] Tomer Cohen: Even like building the orchestrator across those because you don't want to use
[00:23:53] Tomer Cohen: you want the agents to start falling to each other.
[00:23:55] Tomer Cohen: The trust is you should kind of work with a role agent and go out do a back and forth
[00:24:00] Tomer Cohen: versus doing what more sequentially.
[00:24:02] Tomer Cohen: So we've done a lot of work internally to make it happen.
[00:24:05] Tomer Cohen: This is why I think it does require that level of investment.
[00:24:09] Tomer Cohen: And then in some cases, let's talk about the design agent that we're working with.
[00:24:12] Tomer Cohen: We're working with multiple companies to try and understand which product works best for us.
[00:24:18] Tomer Cohen: And interestingly enough, and this is another learning, different teams gravitate to different
[00:24:24] Tomer Cohen: products. So that's like something we'll have to resolve and think about how we do this really
[00:24:30] Tomer Cohen: well because ultimately we were trying to kind of simplify the process as much as possible.
[00:24:35] Tomer Cohen: That was a big learning for us and which tools we use and how we basically integrate them in.
[00:24:39] Tomer Cohen: You might have an amazing Figma agent but some teams want to use a different design tool.
[00:24:43] Lenny Rachitsky: Yeah, so we've kind of experimented with Figma and subframe and magic patterns and so on
[00:24:49] Tomer Cohen: and we saw people gravitating depending on the function, their level of visibility there.
[00:24:54] Tomer Cohen: They know how of the tool before or gravitating to different tools.
[00:24:59] Tomer Cohen: Ultimately, I don't want to have eight design agents in the company.
[00:25:02] Tomer Cohen: So we have to like converge into at least a few.
[00:25:06] Tomer Cohen: And I think it's similar across many areas because a lot of those agents are trying to solve
[00:25:13] Tomer Cohen: similar end goal but they're doing it very differently.
[00:25:17] Tomer Cohen: And what you'll see that ultimately, I don't think there's going to be a winner takes all
[00:25:20] Tomer Cohen: because the starting point of the customer or the user will dictate a lot how simple they are
[00:25:27] Tomer Cohen: for that use case. Super interesting. The other interesting takeaway here is you're designing
[00:25:31] Lenny Rachitsky: very specific agents that are one job to be done. Is that a very intentional decision?
[00:25:37] Lenny Rachitsky: Did you try an agent that just is super intelligent on all these things?
[00:25:40] Lenny Rachitsky: We're ultimately, we'll do an orchestrator. We're going to be orchestrator across but we did
[00:25:45] Tomer Cohen: want to be able to rate and grade those agents really well on how they're doing.
[00:25:51] Tomer Cohen: And I think there is a level of expertise. Now, we're kind of building this as an
[00:25:57] Tomer Cohen: way where you'll be able to mask a lot of those. You might not know that there's a trust
[00:26:01] Tomer Cohen: agent. You know, you might have, we call this internally, the product jam or agent that basically
[00:26:06] Tomer Cohen: does your product jam, which is a process we do internally. You might just use the product jam
[00:26:11] Tomer Cohen: engine and that product jam end will work with all the other agents. But now we're starting with
[00:26:16] Tomer Cohen: that building blocks until we build the orchestrating layer across.
[00:26:19] Tomer Cohen: Another interesting takeaway from what you've been sharing is that so much of the work has gone
[00:26:25] Lenny Rachitsky: into the beginning of the product demo process, just like helping you craft the right
[00:26:29] Lenny Rachitsky: requirements, clarify trust. And then here's product jam and here's research we've done.
[00:26:34] Lenny Rachitsky: And I imagine it's because coding has already been accelerated with all these IE tools.
[00:26:38] Lenny Rachitsky: Talk about just like why that's maybe where most of the investments gone and where you've
[00:26:42] Lenny Rachitsky: seen the most impacts so far. 100% according investment has gone started a while back and those
[00:26:48] Tomer Cohen: are full into place. We have our coding agent. In fact, we've kind of staged it into two parts of
[00:26:54] Tomer Cohen: there is the idea to design part and then there's the code to launch part. The code to launch part
[00:27:01] Tomer Cohen: has gone a lot of attention and we're making something inroads there. Everything from the coding
[00:27:06] Tomer Cohen: agent to what we call the maintenance agent when you have a failed build. It will do it for you.
[00:27:13] Tomer Cohen: In fact, I think we're close to 50% of all those builds being done by the maintenance agent
[00:27:17] Tomer Cohen: in a QA agent. Wow. So this is when a break builds instead of engineers hopping on
[00:27:22] Lenny Rachitsky: the issues. You can still go and finish your coffee before you have to go and
[00:27:26] Tomer Cohen: and do the build against. But we haven't had much investment until we kind of launched this
[00:27:31] Tomer Cohen: program in the idea to design area. And that's a material part of work. It's also where the
[00:27:38] Tomer Cohen: quality a lot of the work comes from. At least before you start to go into the coding phase,
[00:27:43] Tomer Cohen: the idea is to empower everybody. So if you're an engineer, you can basically use all those tools
[00:27:47] Tomer Cohen: of the front of the process and be able to be a full stack builder. How long did it take to get
[00:27:52] Lenny Rachitsky: this kind of in place for you to actually form your first team to build these initial agents
[00:27:56] Lenny Rachitsky: and some of this back end, redo the code base sort of thing? I announced this internally
[00:28:03] Tomer Cohen: end of last year. We really kind of started working, but it was more setting up the teams and
[00:28:08] Tomer Cohen: the processes internally. We had our first MVP of those agents. I think like 45 months after it
[00:28:14] Tomer Cohen: was like really trained, I would say, but really the work itself has been kind of a couple of
[00:28:19] Tomer Cohen: months of dedicated work. A lot of it has been getting all the corpus of data together,
[00:28:22] Tomer Cohen: cleaning it up. And that's actually a good learning as well. Like it's not great to just give it
[00:28:27] Tomer Cohen: access to your drive and say reason all of this knowledge base. It actually does a very poor job
[00:28:32] Tomer Cohen: understanding importance of the past and putting weights on stuff. You actually want to think
[00:28:38] Tomer Cohen: about specifically what the context window you want to give it to and what's the knowledge
[00:28:42] Tomer Cohen: base that you want to have it focus on. So even cleaning up, let's call them gold examples or
[00:28:48] Tomer Cohen: golden examples to learn from has been one of the biggest learnings. Just reasoning over your entire
[00:28:52] Tomer Cohen: knowledge base does not work. Yeah, that makes sense. There may be just like a researcher with
[00:28:57] Lenny Rachitsky: a strong opinion about something that you disagree with and it would know it's like, of course,
[00:29:02] Lenny Rachitsky: this is data, this is fact. Exactly. And then it doesn't always understand like, you know,
[00:29:06] Tomer Cohen: ties to original specs to success, right? You have to actually build, this is a really
[00:29:11] Tomer Cohen: interesting way. When you think about how you bring those tools in, you can't just bring their
[00:29:16] Tomer Cohen: man. You have to know what you feed them with. And what you feed them with is not just access.
[00:29:21] Tomer Cohen: I see a lot of focus just focus on the connectivity and integration. And it reminds me of the,
[00:29:26] Tomer Cohen: this is almost like it's actually more than 10 years ago when I was, you know,
[00:29:31] Tomer Cohen: co rebuilding the team, co rebuilding the feed that linked in and we started from scratch.
[00:29:37] Tomer Cohen: I had to like, just sit down and filter through examples of what is a good professional
[00:29:43] Tomer Cohen: post on LinkedIn and what is not. And that was, I'm not, this was like weeks of work,
[00:29:49] Tomer Cohen: getting up with that golden sample of examples, but the first and most important part was fitting
[00:29:54] Tomer Cohen: at the right data, not all the data. So it requires work. This is where I would say like for many
[00:30:01] Tomer Cohen: companies who are thinking about this phase and I do a lot of sessions today with CPO's and COs
[00:30:06] Tomer Cohen: on this process, you have to put this initial work to get the gains after. And I think,
[00:30:11] Tomer Cohen: I think this is a, I think there's a takeaway there in generally with AI, even if you're learning
[00:30:17] Tomer Cohen: it for the first time and so on, whether it's cursor or whether it's design and with Figma or
[00:30:22] Tomer Cohen: other tools or lovable, you should be ready to invest those hours before you start seeing yourself
[00:30:29] Tomer Cohen: pick up in velocity and quality, which will come up, but you have to invest that time.
[00:30:35] This episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day new headlines are scaring us about all the ways
[00:30:40] Lenny Rachitsky: that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear. But a recent survey for Miro
[00:30:45] Lenny Rachitsky: tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role, but over 50% of people
[00:30:52] Lenny Rachitsky: struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's innovation workspace, an intelligent platform that
[00:30:57] Lenny Rachitsky: brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done. Miro has been empowering
[00:31:03] Lenny Rachitsky: teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today,
[00:31:08] Lenny Rachitsky: there's a forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power
[00:31:12] Lenny Rachitsky: of AI and human potential. Guests of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time
[00:31:18] Lenny Rachitsky: to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn to unstructured data,
[00:31:24] Lenny Rachitsky: like sticky notes or screenshots into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables and prototypes
[00:31:29] Lenny Rachitsky: in minutes. You don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already
[00:31:35] Lenny Rachitsky: doing in Miro's canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out
[00:31:40] Lenny Rachitsky: at miro.com slash Lenny. That's m-i-r-o.com slash Lenny. What's the current state of the pilot? How
[00:31:48] Lenny Rachitsky: large is it? How many teams are doing it? What kind of stuff have you shipped? Just give us a
[00:31:53] Lenny Rachitsky: sense of today's world. Yeah, so we are, I wouldn't say we are yet at a very high simple rate where
[00:31:58] Tomer Cohen: it's kind of a high percentage of the organization, but we have a substantial part of the organization
[00:32:03] Tomer Cohen: already using it to provide a lot of the feedback. We're seeing a lot of great examples. So the way
[00:32:08] Tomer Cohen: I think about the benefits is a function of experimentation volume multiplied by quality,
[00:32:15] Tomer Cohen: how good are those experiments divided by the time it takes to actually pull them out, like idea
[00:32:23] Tomer Cohen: to launch. So on saving times, we're seeing whether it's PMs, designs, engineers, saving hours of
[00:32:30] Tomer Cohen: work a week right now, whether it's the analyst agent we talked about or prototyping really quickly
[00:32:36] Tomer Cohen: or the product jamming experience has been a big part of that. On the quality side, we're seeing
[00:32:42] Tomer Cohen: insights, discussions just being much, much better. In other, quality and time sometimes they help
[00:32:48] Tomer Cohen: each other because it's high quality to have to spend a lot as much time on something. So we're
[00:32:52] Tomer Cohen: seeing that applied in and the volume, I wouldn't say we had a rate where I'm seeing a high
[00:32:58] Tomer Cohen: percentage of organization doing it yet, but this will come once we, we haven't GA this internally
[00:33:03] Tomer Cohen: that will come in the next couple of months because we have all the stuff in place. But we're seeing
[00:33:08] Tomer Cohen: designers and PMs picking up bugs directly from the, you know, from the, from the jury tickets,
[00:33:15] Tomer Cohen: pushing them in, something we haven't seen before. And there's just an appetite for everybody
[00:33:20] Tomer Cohen: to just join. So in fact, the biggest thing right now is everybody wants access. Everybody wants
[00:33:25] Tomer Cohen: access with the tools to be able to do it together. And we just want to make sure it's good enough
[00:33:30] Tomer Cohen: to make sure their whole organization can do it really well. So how is it that you're piling it?
[00:33:33] Lenny Rachitsky: Is it, there's a, some number of people have access to these agents and they just work the way they've
[00:33:38] Lenny Rachitsky: worked with access to these tools? Or is there like a team dedicated? This is the way you work now
[00:33:43] Lenny Rachitsky: and this is it. And we'll see what happens. So it's a very cool. So basically we have a team building.
[00:33:50] Tomer Cohen: It's the core team building kind of the FSB track across all of our ND, FSB full stack builder.
[00:33:56] Tomer Cohen: And then there are pockets and pods of teams using it. So basically we are looking at specific areas
[00:34:02] Tomer Cohen: that we were basically giving you to the condition there is they give feedback. As a response
[00:34:08] Tomer Cohen: for that, they make the tool better. So it's not just access. People who will use it,
[00:34:11] Tomer Cohen: so if you want to your earlier adopters would be the ones who help you shove the product really well.
[00:34:16] So we're doing this in the pod model right now. It's like a pod within a larger team like
[00:34:20] Lenny Rachitsky: like a designer PM engineer kind of group within. Is there an example you have like a part of
[00:34:25] Lenny Rachitsky: LinkedIn that's trying us out? Yeah. So you know, if I think about some of our teams, whether it's
[00:34:32] Tomer Cohen: actually we just launched a semantic people search and the semantic job search as well,
[00:34:37] Tomer Cohen: that team was using part of those tools to actually help build it. So that team actually
[00:34:41] Tomer Cohen: this was PM is building their own dashboards with those tools without waiting for design
[00:34:46] Tomer Cohen: resources to come in. Then we have a design team who is now already you know, this started really
[00:34:53] Tomer Cohen: from the manager kind of rolling this out. And in many ways what I tell this team is don't wait
[00:34:57] Tomer Cohen: for the official GA you know start start doing it start kind of leaning in. We're seeing designers
[00:35:05] Tomer Cohen: on that team starting to push kind of PR which never happened before. And now other teams
[00:35:11] Tomer Cohen: they want to do this as well. So it's starting with this kind of grassroot experience. There is
[00:35:17] Tomer Cohen: I would say there's the places have been very formal. I would say the beginning has been the top.
[00:35:22] The product executive teams basically removed from functional leaders design PM BD and so on to
[00:35:28] Tomer Cohen: product areas leaders and they basically rock across the stack. And they also go for 360 with all
[00:35:34] Tomer Cohen: of those functions to see if they're if they're really able to do a full stack building experience.
[00:35:39] Tomer Cohen: Then we're also launching at kind of like the junior side a new program called the associate
[00:35:44] Tomer Cohen: product builder program where basically we used to have our APM program which this is about
[00:35:50] Tomer Cohen: it's ending this year. And then starting January we're going to start having our APB program.
[00:35:57] Tomer Cohen: And they're going to come into LinkedIn. We're going to teach them how to code design and PM
[00:36:00] Tomer Cohen: at LinkedIn. They're going to go through a pretty rigorous training process and then they're
[00:36:07] Tomer Cohen: going to join those pods. And gradually we're going to grow that program to be a material part of
[00:36:12] Tomer Cohen: LinkedIn as well. Wow. So this might be the future of the APM program is this full stack builder
[00:36:20] Lenny Rachitsky: APM-ish program. In many ways we're taking we've built some pretty amazing. I'm really excited for
[00:36:24] Tomer Cohen: that group. I wish I could join it. We build amazing training for them. And in many ways we're
[00:36:30] Tomer Cohen: going to use that training to think about how we roll out the quest organization. We're kind of
[00:36:34] Tomer Cohen: using the lens of you know you you have great technical skills but you're not you know an engineer
[00:36:40] Tomer Cohen: at a company ad or you have great design taste but you have a design at skill and company ad. And
[00:36:45] Tomer Cohen: we're going to teach you how to do it at LinkedIn. But the training we're going to use a lot to kind
[00:36:50] Tomer Cohen: of extend across the company as well. Okay. So you have these programs these pilots and these pods
[00:36:54] Lenny Rachitsky: and you said what you're looking at to see if this is something you roll out is experiment velocity
[00:36:59] Lenny Rachitsky: times quality times time divided by time divided by time okay got it. And I guess I know it's
[00:37:05] Lenny Rachitsky: early but just you said it's you're seeing that it's saving teams a few hours a week at this point
[00:37:10] Lenny Rachitsky: something like that. Yeah and I think the feedback has been the most important part right when you
[00:37:14] Tomer Cohen: kind of the way to think about this is just like you build a product so rebuilding this product
[00:37:18] Tomer Cohen: internally and you want to experiment with some kind of early adopters who will give you feedback
[00:37:24] Tomer Cohen: and the feedback has been amazing. In fact, our top talent are the ones who are using this the most
[00:37:32] Tomer Cohen: at LinkedIn. And the feedback from them has been incredible in terms because they're also
[00:37:38] Tomer Cohen: willing to spend the time and give the feedback as well and the response from them has been
[00:37:44] Tomer Cohen: incredible in terms of like the quality of their output the time they're spending on this to get
[00:37:50] Tomer Cohen: the value back. They're desire to kind of be part of this and actually scale this and make this
[00:37:56] Tomer Cohen: even better. So that's where I you know a lot of the excitement has been from how they're using it
[00:38:02] Tomer Cohen: and the quality we've seen there. I would say in six months or so we'll be able to see a lot more
[00:38:07] Tomer Cohen: of the organization use it and you'll start seeing kind of those top line numbers will be as well.
[00:38:11] Tomer Cohen: That is a really interesting insight that the top performers are finding the most success
[00:38:16] Lenny Rachitsky: because there's always been this question is they I can just make people that are not amazing
[00:38:19] Lenny Rachitsky: more amazing or is it going to make amazing people even more amazing and it sounds like it's
[00:38:23] Lenny Rachitsky: likely the latter. Yes and it's it's in many ways it's surprising it's not surprising I've seen this
[00:38:29] Tomer Cohen: also when we were it's surprising because you would want everybody else to be part of this and lean
[00:38:35] Tomer Cohen: in. I think top talent has the tendency of continuously trying to get better at their craft and
[00:38:43] Tomer Cohen: this innate need to be at the cutting edge of how you build and I think we're seeing this here as
[00:38:48] Tomer Cohen: well. This is why you know I've had a spray I say with the team that you know if you if we build all
[00:38:55] Tomer Cohen: those tools will they use it and I know I know the answer is no it's not enough to give them the tools
[00:39:01] Tomer Cohen: to use it. You have to build the incentive programs the motivation the examples to how you do it
[00:39:08] Tomer Cohen: they need to see other people being successful as well and I've seen this also when we're shifting
[00:39:13] Tomer Cohen: LinkedIn from a desktop company into a mobile company it was a very similar process it's very
[00:39:18] Tomer Cohen: hard change management here it's going to be a critical part I think I see a lot of companies roll
[00:39:23] Tomer Cohen: out their agents and just expecting companies to adopt. It doesn't work this way some will adopt
[00:39:29] Tomer Cohen: that tends to be kind of your cutting edge 5% of talent that just wants new tools and they have a
[00:39:34] Tomer Cohen: dice for change but the vast majority needs to work for change management in how they do it and
[00:39:41] Tomer Cohen: that requires being a lot more thoughtful about the cultural aspect of it which is by far for me the
[00:39:45] Tomer Cohen: biggest and most important thing to do. Yeah I want to spend time there and it's very like it makes
[00:39:51] Lenny Rachitsky: a lot of sense why people don't spend time here because they have so much to do they got to ship
[00:39:56] Lenny Rachitsky: things they got their days are already busy after now carve out time to learn this new tool that'll
[00:40:01] Lenny Rachitsky: not pay off for a while so I get why people are like okay okay I'll get there I'll use it someday
[00:40:07] Lenny Rachitsky: but you know they don't this idea of culture this is when I saw you kind of share this initially
[00:40:12] Lenny Rachitsky: this is the third piece of making the successful so there's like the platform of getting the code
[00:40:17] Lenny Rachitsky: base ready for people for AI to work with then there's the the tool like the agents you've talked
[00:40:23] Lenny Rachitsky: about and then there's the culture is there more there that you can share just like what is actually
[00:40:28] Lenny Rachitsky: worked and helping get people on board one thing I heard is like creating a little bit of film of
[00:40:32] Lenny Rachitsky: like okay only a few people can use this and you have to sign up to get access what's working
[00:40:37] Lenny Rachitsky: getting people to get on board yeah I think this is where I emphasize to people that
[00:40:44] Tomer Cohen: getting everything down the platforms the tools is not going to be sufficient it's a prerequisite
[00:40:50] Tomer Cohen: for this to work but not sufficient for this to work because it really requires you to invest a lot
[00:40:55] Tomer Cohen: in the cultural aspects of how do you get people to lean into this one and this one might feel
[00:41:02] Tomer Cohen: slow at first but I've seen this before with our transformation of things from desktop to mobile
[00:41:07] Tomer Cohen: and and once it picks up it actually maintains very high velocity one you know people are really
[00:41:13] Tomer Cohen: incentivized by how you define expectations for them so to think about what is the expectation
[00:41:18] Tomer Cohen: of somebody in the role whatever changing performance review sort of things very much so so
[00:41:24] Tomer Cohen: everything from how you hire to you know calibration and evaluation and one thing I want to see
[00:41:32] Tomer Cohen: there early is this kind of AI agency and fluency like I mentioned the tools are there the question is
[00:41:37] Tomer Cohen: would you use them because the tools will be good enough but not great at the beginning right that's
[00:41:42] Tomer Cohen: the classic thing of every good MVP tool they're good enough but they're not great and then you
[00:41:48] Tomer Cohen: kind of want to build that agency to make the tool better like we're in this kind of notion of
[00:41:53] Tomer Cohen: we're going to make this better for LinkedIn together to is piloting success inside of your
[00:41:58] Tomer Cohen: organization that's the pod model where you're showing that you know not only this could work it's
[00:42:03] Tomer Cohen: actually having success so we have even our partnership team our BD team being able to kind of go
[00:42:09] Tomer Cohen: instead of like relying on waiting for an engineer to help build the developer portal and build kind
[00:42:15] Tomer Cohen: of the connectors there literally they the you know one of our head of partnerships just went and did
[00:42:20] Tomer Cohen: it himself didn't even delegate to his team and the goal is to say like hey I can do it you can do
[00:42:25] Tomer Cohen: it as well those examples are really really powerful I talked about the associate product builder
[00:42:32] Tomer Cohen: program where we are going to be very focused on training I think that will send a really strong
[00:42:38] Tomer Cohen: message across the organization people will see this data then what they can do and I think
[00:42:42] Tomer Cohen: that will create that movement but celebrating wins in all hands highlighting people and showing
[00:42:48] Tomer Cohen: those examples you know one example we've seen recently people really looked at it in a surprise
[00:42:54] Tomer Cohen: lens but then it kind of I think really opened up a lens for them we had somebody in our user research
[00:42:59] Tomer Cohen: team that we had an opening for a PM on the growth team and we kind of that role was open for a while
[00:43:08] Tomer Cohen: and she said I feel I can do it and she used all those tools this is a user researcher becoming a
[00:43:15] Tomer Cohen: growth PM not usually the career path you see but she was excited about the area she used all those
[00:43:21] Tomer Cohen: tools and she's now a growth PM on the team so and really you can start thinking about her more as
[00:43:28] Tomer Cohen: a full stack builder ultimately but seeing those openings and then highlighting those people actually
[00:43:34] Tomer Cohen: people are doing this have been a great example of it and then just making sure that those tools are
[00:43:40] Tomer Cohen: accessible people can provide feedback you share a lot has been an incredible part of this it's not
[00:43:46] Tomer Cohen: enough to be top down directive that this is how we want to work people want to feel like there
[00:43:51] Tomer Cohen: are success stories they feel like it's worth their time it feels it's a movement that want to be
[00:43:56] Tomer Cohen: part of and then ultimately they can see successes in how they do it I love this kind of comparison
[00:44:03] Lenny Rachitsky: to the shift in mobile that seems like we all went through that and there's all these stories of
[00:44:08] Lenny Rachitsky: companies requiring you to show mobile mocks that's like the only way we're going to operate now
[00:44:11] Lenny Rachitsky: everything you have to ship has to be a mobile and it's interesting how similar this is to them
[00:44:16] Lenny Rachitsky: to that experience and so a few things you just shared here just to kind of summarize some of the
[00:44:20] Lenny Rachitsky: things that have worked for you showing wind celebrating winds showing people what other folks are
[00:44:24] Lenny Rachitsky: doing with AI tools creating a program that people enroll into and make it a little bit exclusive
[00:44:31] Lenny Rachitsky: this performance or a piece is really interesting because that really will change
[00:44:34] Lenny Rachitsky: if you folks be hit or serious how we get promoted have you actually already made that change to the
[00:44:39] Lenny Rachitsky: PM I guess it's every track I imagine not just product management have you already made that
[00:44:43] Lenny Rachitsky: change or is it kind of like a working progress so there was two aspects to it once once I moved
[00:44:48] Tomer Cohen: kind of the my team my directs wouldn't 360 for them so their 360 was you know if you came from PM
[00:44:55] Tomer Cohen: you had the designers on your team right you so that kind of that was that's it had its own and then
[00:45:02] Tomer Cohen: we shared those with them and that had its own kind of motivation but then we broadly took it
[00:45:06] Tomer Cohen: across so when we hire right now we look for those and then this upcoming cycle we do a buy annual
[00:45:12] Tomer Cohen: it's that's kind of a part of the performance evaluation piece and we announced it to everybody and
[00:45:16] Tomer Cohen: for what it's for people are excited to show and and they excited to know how they're going to be
[00:45:22] Tomer Cohen: it's always about like I just I want to know how I'm being rated or evaluated so just being able to
[00:45:27] Tomer Cohen: show those examples has been a big part of it the other thing would say like it takes time for this
[00:45:33] Tomer Cohen: program in its formality to roll out across the entire organization and I was I was you know
[00:45:42] intentionally not trying to be quick at rolling this out to everybody because I think that's a
[00:45:48] that just dilutes the value of it really quickly because it's not about I could care less about
[00:45:52] Tomer Cohen: your title I care about how you work so calling your full stack builder is not when I'm looking for
[00:45:58] Tomer Cohen: changing your mindset to a full stack mindset is what I'm looking for you thinking you can do the
[00:46:03] Tomer Cohen: whole thing you're you're looking at those tools and looking at how to do it so one of the things
[00:46:07] Tomer Cohen: I've said is like if you're looking for a formal reorg or declaration to start building differently
[00:46:14] you're waiting too long like like my biggest thing is here's a permission for me to just not wait
[00:46:18] Tomer Cohen: and just go so whether or not like you have the right tools or not go build the tool like use a tool
[00:46:24] Tomer Cohen: from the outside bring it in shoulders examples in many ways like prove that you are full stack
[00:46:31] Tomer Cohen: builder in mindset before anything else come to mind that just naturally will happen and that's
[00:46:37] Tomer Cohen: also where we've seen some of our best out and just goes and lends a lot into I love that I was
[00:46:42] Lenny Rachitsky: going to actually mention that quote so when you shared you work with told me exactly that quote
[00:46:46] Lenny Rachitsky: you just shared some glad you brought it up of just if you're waiting for a reorg you're not
[00:46:50] Lenny Rachitsky: thinking about it the right way how do you encourage people to actually play with these tools on
[00:46:55] Lenny Rachitsky: their own are you just like go take a few days to play with the I is it just try it or is there
[00:46:59] Lenny Rachitsky: anything formal you've seen of just like getting people to more try this on our own without joining
[00:47:04] Lenny Rachitsky: this program a lot of the tools we've made we've been sharing them regularly we've done all like a
[00:47:08] Tomer Cohen: few of my all hands have been all about how to use those tools but then at the same time we're kind
[00:47:13] Tomer Cohen: of inviting heavy fun a new tool that works really well for you like share it show it again it could
[00:47:19] Tomer Cohen: be slack could be messages teams and so on how you do it but like the idea is really to start
[00:47:24] Tomer Cohen: getting that investment and how things work actually think in general you can feel overwhelmed
[00:47:30] by tools right now by recipes and how to do things like you know what's what's your prompt and
[00:47:35] Tomer Cohen: what's my prompt but really it's finding some that kind of works really well that can grab it around
[00:47:40] Tomer Cohen: and kind of really invest in that's been those areas but I think we've had this invitation to go
[00:47:46] Tomer Cohen: and explore and and go and bring in stuff that you think are great and in many ways like you know
[00:47:52] Tomer Cohen: bring others along in the journey it's one of one good way to kind of make the influence much
[00:47:57] Tomer Cohen: bigger than a few folks who are doing really well with this are there any surprises on the negative
[00:48:02] Lenny Rachitsky: side that have come out of this of PRD is just feeling like AI driven people slowing down and
[00:48:08] Lenny Rachitsky: expect to leave is there anything that surprised you just like okay this is actually not great
[00:48:12] Lenny Rachitsky: yeah we mentioned a few of them like we I was hoping for some tools to work off the shelf really
[00:48:16] Tomer Cohen: well was never the case because we had to invest quite a lot never the case never the case we had
[00:48:22] Tomer Cohen: invest quite a lot in making it part of it is we just have a lot of legacy information and code
[00:48:28] Tomer Cohen: based knowledge and designs and so on so if you know a lot of the companies we work with are seeing
[00:48:33] Tomer Cohen: this is a great growth opportunity for them as well to invest but I do think it's it's a big
[00:48:37] Tomer Cohen: area of investment as well we talked about not just giving access to Oliver context which we started
[00:48:44] Tomer Cohen: with and like we were like oh here's access to all the drive on information
[00:48:47] Tomer Cohen: failed miserably and hallucinates like crazy people gravitating towards different tools like our
[00:48:53] Tomer Cohen: goal was to converge on tools but that was pretty hard and then I think in terms of
[00:49:01] Tomer Cohen: you know in terms of quality we've just seen better quality but I think it's because again
[00:49:05] Tomer Cohen: where we are in the stage is still the early adopters and they're doing a few iterations
[00:49:11] Tomer Cohen: in terms of how to do it but I would say like the tooling adoption is hard and then I think for
[00:49:18] Tomer Cohen: some people this is important for me to kind of stay some people do not want to be full-stack
[00:49:22] Tomer Cohen: builders and that's completely okay some people see themselves in specialization and I think
[00:49:26] Tomer Cohen: specialization has a place and a role so I don't I didn't want to admit the message to be across
[00:49:32] Tomer Cohen: the organization I expect everybody to be a full-stack builder I do not I think they're system
[00:49:36] Tomer Cohen: builders that power full-stack builders and then you have people who are specialized but I don't
[00:49:42] Tomer Cohen: think we need as many specialized people as we did in the past I didn't actually realize this
[00:49:47] Lenny Rachitsky: until just now so this is is this like their title now instead of product manager engineer
[00:49:50] Lenny Rachitsky: they're full-stack builder we have a full-stack builder title formal inside the organization and
[00:49:56] Tomer Cohen: we are gradually putting people in that bucket so there's a whole career ladder that's forming
[00:50:01] Lenny Rachitsky: okay that's a that's a bigger deal than I even thought so where are you finding these folks
[00:50:07] Lenny Rachitsky: mostly coming from like product engineering design I imagine it's a mix but just is there
[00:50:11] Lenny Rachitsky: kind of most common trend it's a mix we I would just kind of people listening I would just think
[00:50:16] Tomer Cohen: about like just go over your org and imagine who can do it who can right now flex across those
[00:50:23] Tomer Cohen: functions whether it's engineering design product even BD and what you'll find is there's
[00:50:30] Tomer Cohen: already quite a few it can fix across interesting are there any functions you think are especially
[00:50:38] Lenny Rachitsky: successful at this not to play any favorites but I don't know are you finding like okay or you could
[00:50:42] Lenny Rachitsky: also not highlight any specific now I think it's like I think it's a mental model of how you do it
[00:50:49] Tomer Cohen: I think you know if I were to play like what's the hardest craft to potentially learn I think design
[00:50:56] Tomer Cohen: has a lot more work to get the design agents to be really really good so I think designers have
[00:51:01] Tomer Cohen: a little bit of a leg up in terms of others learning their craft and then the vice vice versa but I
[00:51:08] Tomer Cohen: honestly think it's a mindset I've seen I've seen designers code I've seen PMs kind of design and
[00:51:14] Tomer Cohen: do well and this is why I think like when you kind of step back and you think about people in
[00:51:18] Tomer Cohen: the organization and who can flex I think you'll see them show up in many areas and I think you'll
[00:51:24] Tomer Cohen: find there is they have the agency they leaning into new things they have the fluency like they were
[00:51:31] Tomer Cohen: already building new experiences and they have that growth mindset that they just want to get
[00:51:37] Tomer Cohen: better so there it doesn't matter by the learn at school or what's their what label somebody put
[00:51:42] Tomer Cohen: in them when they join the company when I love about a lot of this is this is the it's the easiest
[00:51:47] Lenny Rachitsky: time to transition between different product roles than it's ever been designs moving to PM or
[00:51:52] Lenny Rachitsky: just moving to this new role it's like it makes it so much easier to like you said that researcher
[00:51:56] Lenny Rachitsky: became a growth PM and this is probably my biggest advice less motivation I give to the team because
[00:52:02] Tomer Cohen: what I tell them is ultimately whatever this is for me as well like I think about it in the same way
[00:52:08] Tomer Cohen: it's the it's the incentives for your soil line with your organization what we're asking for
[00:52:14] Tomer Cohen: right because this is the we need you to change we want to be a more agile
[00:52:19] Tomer Cohen: adaptive resilient organization that can deal with the pace of change but you want as well for your
[00:52:26] Tomer Cohen: own career you want to be at the cutting edge of how you build so the incentives are really
[00:52:33] Tomer Cohen: aligned between what you need for your own career and what your organization needs you to do so there's
[00:52:37] Tomer Cohen: that that permission to go and do it for me is ideally kind of a tailwind in what they want to do
[00:52:44] Tomer Cohen: well than anything else maybe a last question for people that are inspired and like okay this is
[00:52:50] Lenny Rachitsky: what we need to be doing and he just tips for someone starting down this road to be successful at
[00:52:56] Lenny Rachitsky: trying something like this at their company I would say like I would start with the I would start
[00:53:01] Tomer Cohen: with the notion of like how do you want to bring like this is structure I would think about the
[00:53:06] Tomer Cohen: the platform you need to build the tools you want to bring and then I would spend a lot of
[00:53:10] Tomer Cohen: time on the culture platform and tools I think would be again a prerequisite but not sufficient and
[00:53:15] Tomer Cohen: the culture aspect is really important important I would think a lot about how you bring people along
[00:53:20] Tomer Cohen: so for example for one of the learnings we had that probably I will do differently right now if
[00:53:24] Tomer Cohen: I were to redo this program was for a while I was working very closely with my core team on it the
[00:53:29] Tomer Cohen: core kind of full stack building team that we're in charge of building all this material but the
[00:53:33] Tomer Cohen: organization was always asking questions what's going on who is doing it what are the tools and in
[00:53:39] Tomer Cohen: retrospect we could have done a lot more in the flow to just show them and get them
[00:53:45] Tomer Cohen: to already use early tools or be be aware of it versus doing a small team on the site so it's okay
[00:53:50] Tomer Cohen: to start with a small team I think it's really important but at the same time just making
[00:53:53] Tomer Cohen: sure there's like visibility across the whole thing is really powerful being patient and being
[00:53:59] Tomer Cohen: willing to invest I always give this example of like you know we always give this example of like
[00:54:03] Tomer Cohen: oh look at this startup they built this in a week yes you can be a lot of start in a week right now
[00:54:07] Tomer Cohen: if you start from scratch it's actually not hard but when you are trying to transform a large
[00:54:13] Tomer Cohen: organization you want to have this impatient about the goal and you have to have an high ambition
[00:54:21] Tomer Cohen: but being very thoughtful and patient about how you bring it to life and the key things you have
[00:54:25] Tomer Cohen: to invest in if you don't invest in your platform I just don't see how this could be a successful
[00:54:30] Tomer Cohen: outcome if you don't invest in customizing the tools for you then you're just going to get vanilla
[00:54:36] Tomer Cohen: generic agents from the outside so being aware of the investment and making sure you actually
[00:54:42] Tomer Cohen: allocate resource to it this is kind of the classic be willing to invest up front you can reap the
[00:54:48] Tomer Cohen: benefit after versus saying hey you know why am I not seeing us moving into two extra productivity
[00:54:55] Tomer Cohen: in a week that's not going to be this way you can see it with some people but starting to collect
[00:55:01] Tomer Cohen: those examples and starting to really think about the transformation is really key this is so
[00:55:06] Lenny Rachitsky: incredibly cool I know that a lot of CPO's and heads of product and all kinds of leaders are
[00:55:10] Lenny Rachitsky: reaching out to you trying to figure out what you learned how to do this so I love that we
[00:55:14] Lenny Rachitsky: went deep on all these things just file questions are anything else that we haven't shared
[00:55:19] Lenny Rachitsky: that you think might be helpful for listeners to hear or maybe just to double down on before we
[00:55:23] Lenny Rachitsky: get to our very exciting lightning round what are you in an organization you're waiting for your
[00:55:28] Tomer Cohen: leader to roll this out or you're a leader trying to roll this out I would not wait like the the
[00:55:34] Tomer Cohen: first thing I've done which I thought in retrospect was very hopeful is I did not I did announce this
[00:55:39] Tomer Cohen: at front we are going to this mode like we're starting in pockets we're starting in pods we're
[00:55:45] Tomer Cohen: building the tools but we're going to this is this is the mountain we're going to go after and in
[00:55:50] Tomer Cohen: many ways we're going to make it great I also announced that this is not just an end state it's a
[00:55:55] Tomer Cohen: kind of continuous progress there's no state we're going to get to as much as continuously just trying
[00:56:01] Tomer Cohen: to be better in many ways to compete you just want to be better than others in how you build
[00:56:07] because the for the version of building will look completely just for oneself every few years or so
[00:56:12] Tomer Cohen: so do not wait really focus on the progress you're making over communicate with your team not
[00:56:19] Tomer Cohen: just the vision but also the progress you're making almost like holding yourself responsible
[00:56:24] if you'll either give yourself KPIs you share with your own teams or okay ours and if you're in
[00:56:29] some organization and I would say whether or not or not your CPO or your CEO is announcing this
[00:56:35] Tomer Cohen: type of program go do it or join an organization that does it so you can be at the cutting edge of
[00:56:41] Tomer Cohen: how you build in the future tell them or with that we reached our very exciting lightning round I've
[00:56:46] Lenny Rachitsky: got five questions for you are you ready I'm ready first question what are two or three books you
[00:56:51] Lenny Rachitsky: find yourself recommending most to other people I love to gift trios of books that I really like
[00:56:57] Tomer Cohen: so my current trio is the very diverse in topics so apologies if it's not falling all into tech but
[00:57:05] Tomer Cohen: the first one it's called why nations fail it's a book I read a decade ago even more and the
[00:57:12] Tomer Cohen: offers of it just won the Nobel Prize last year and it basically talks about why does some nations
[00:57:17] Tomer Cohen: succeed in some fail and it's not the usual explanations we go for which is oh it's culture it's
[00:57:24] Tomer Cohen: natural resources it's the it's the kind of religion this is you know it's a lot of those kind of
[00:57:30] Tomer Cohen: tends to be the kind of immediate excuse that people have it kind of falls into two camps are they
[00:57:36] Tomer Cohen: extractive or inclusive institutions can people participate broadly an opportunity is shared or
[00:57:43] Tomer Cohen: there are institutions that basically are supposed to be attracting from many and give to some
[00:57:48] so it's just an incredible way to just think about how you build a nation and for us at length
[00:57:53] Tomer Cohen: then we think a lot about the idea of opportunities so how you build the product as well
[00:57:58] Tomer Cohen: and it's just a good way to kind of move away from easy explanations into like what really makes a
[00:58:03] Tomer Cohen: country really successful as well second book it's called outlive it's really about kind of the idea
[00:58:12] Tomer Cohen: it's kind of like you know the offer Peter I talked about the idea of medicine 30 which is really
[00:58:16] Tomer Cohen: the notion of like building personalized medicine which I think in the world of AI will become
[00:58:21] Tomer Cohen: incredible in the future but it's all those it's called as categories that you should think about
[00:58:27] Tomer Cohen: for your life so you can just optimize your health as much as possible and goes for everything through
[00:58:33] Tomer Cohen: you know fitness to diet to kind of the biggest health factors you should think about but it's a
[00:58:38] Tomer Cohen: it's a great long book and lastly in my bookshelf behind me here you go it's up top you can't
[00:58:44] Lenny Rachitsky: actually see it I think and lastly it's a book that also came out many years ago but it's called
[00:58:50] Tomer Cohen: the beginning of infinity which I really like by Deutsche it's it's it's it wasn't an easy read
[00:58:58] Tomer Cohen: for it's easy read for me but I love the idea in fact especially in products I love the idea of
[00:59:04] Tomer Cohen: cause and effect like really finding great explanations for our things happen and then building on top
[00:59:08] Tomer Cohen: of that your next iterations and this book really pushes on the idea of explanations that only once we
[00:59:16] Tomer Cohen: have a clear understanding of what things happen then we can have breakthroughs on top of that
[00:59:21] Tomer Cohen: but until we get to a point of clear scientific breakthroughs we are not going to make significant
[00:59:27] Tomer Cohen: progress but when you do that it's really almost like infinite progress you can make on top of that
[00:59:33] and of all the ways talking about that last book I think I bought it and I just it was it's not an easy
[00:59:38] Lenny Rachitsky: read for me wasn't an easy read it's a very powerful read awesome is there a favorite recent movie or
[00:59:44] Lenny Rachitsky: TV show you really enjoyed can I do a podcast absolutely so there's a podcast in it's in Hebrew it's
[00:59:53] Tomer Cohen: called one song and it takes a song that you know generally is ideally popular and then it goes
[00:59:59] Tomer Cohen: really deep on the origin and the history of the song and I love it I just I love music and just
[01:00:06] Tomer Cohen: a sex songs so well there's a great job also in kind of bring to life the story behind it so for
[01:00:14] Tomer Cohen: me just goes back to like you thought the song was about something but then it goes really deep into
[01:00:18] Tomer Cohen: the actors behind the song and sometimes it's the words chosen or it's the how the lyrics match the
[01:00:26] Tomer Cohen: the music itself and I just really enjoyed that one there's a podcast podcast called song
[01:00:32] Lenny Rachitsky: exploder I believe that is a similar concept that's not in Hebrew in English that all point people
[01:00:38] Lenny Rachitsky: to if you love that one it's awesome is there a product you've recently discovered the really love
[01:00:43] Lenny Rachitsky: could be an app could be some clothing could be kitchen gadget take gadget uh can I can be an
[01:00:49] Tomer Cohen: can be a product I want to have to think is actually really easy to do I love that this is a
[01:00:54] Lenny Rachitsky: product thinking 101 and just the vision of what you want to see so in my car right now there's
[01:01:00] Tomer Cohen: Alexa built in which is great because the kids can ask for songs all day long and it's it's a
[01:01:06] Tomer Cohen: it's a whole show inside of the car but one of my favorite things to do when I this has been
[01:01:11] Tomer Cohen: doing everything for well over two years is I go in and I going to voice mode or chat GPT yeah
[01:01:18] chat GPT and then we just have a conversation and that's just friction I would love to have all my
[01:01:24] Tomer Cohen: steering wheel a button that invokes my AI friend that can sit next to me in the passenger seat
[01:01:32] Tomer Cohen: and I you know I just think that would be such a I actually think it's what is form
[01:01:37] Tomer Cohen: rights for people just that movement that's just like elimination of friction which was from
[01:01:42] Tomer Cohen: the experience for me on that note I recently discovered Teslas actually do this now if you hold
[01:01:48] Lenny Rachitsky: the right wheel grok appears and you could talk to grok huh so it's here the AI has arrived yeah it's
[01:01:58] Lenny Rachitsky: just like did it by accident then it's okay so for me if you if anybody from Rivian is listening
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_01: please bring us a car Rivian is falling behind yeah and it's like and you have to use grok it'd be
[01:02:11] Lenny Rachitsky: cool if you could switch to different the eyes just because it's like a personality like I just give
[01:02:18] Lenny Rachitsky: me information I don't need you laugh and give you did you did you need to spend some time with it
[01:02:23] SPEAKER_01: before did you have any memory from did you bring any memory into it there's a logged out version
[01:02:29] Lenny Rachitsky: and then you could just log in and it connects to your account yeah it's extremely cool no one's
[01:02:34] Lenny Rachitsky: talking about it's crazy because I don't know if they launched it fully but it just appeared
[01:02:38] Lenny Rachitsky: do you talk in the car a lot to it I I don't use it that much to be honest but I like I should my wife
[01:02:44] Lenny Rachitsky: just doesn't love grok I think the brand of grok is like a specific brand and so she's she's like
[01:02:51] Lenny Rachitsky: don't talk to grok here with me I I love voicemail so I use it all the time yeah I love voicemail too
[01:02:56] Lenny Rachitsky: it just interrupts too often that's the issue you're there right it's just you can buy the way you can
[01:02:59] Lenny Rachitsky: set it up you can basically say okay just yeah like let me finish I'm learning so much okay two more
[01:03:05] Lenny Rachitsky: questions do you have a life motto that you often find useful in work or in life I think last time
[01:03:12] Tomer Cohen: I talked about that I most associated here with I might be wrong when I'm not confused although I
[01:03:17] Tomer Cohen: don't say it this much anymore but I've been the one I love you know growth mindset is like a second
[01:03:22] Tomer Cohen: religions for us at home and one thing I love about is like a phrase there that is becoming is
[01:03:27] Tomer Cohen: better than being which I think ties into the FSB mode a little bit which is you're always in you
[01:03:34] Tomer Cohen: know progress mode iteration mode it's not about getting reaching a state it's about the journey the
[01:03:40] Tomer Cohen: process that's what you should fall in love with it's about continuously growing and evolving without
[01:03:48] the negativity of it or there's no sense of formal there it's just this continuous thing if I look
[01:03:52] Tomer Cohen: back a year from now and I look back how much did I grow like how much do I know let's
[01:03:58] Tomer Cohen: kill us to do that again like where are you becoming better like how do I feel like you know version
[01:04:05] Tomer Cohen: tumor version 2026 versus 2025 what's the delta there and I kind of love that as a as a whale
[01:04:11] Tomer Cohen: thinking a great segue to our final question by the time this episode comes out it won't be a secret
[01:04:18] Lenny Rachitsky: that you're leaving LinkedIn after 14 years legendary run you joined way before the acquisition
[01:04:24] Lenny Rachitsky: you helped them integrate you just like the way LinkedIn was perceived 14 years ago is so radically
[01:04:31] Lenny Rachitsky: different from the way it is today like it's actually really fun and interesting to be there versus
[01:04:36] Lenny Rachitsky: how people for a long time felt about LinkedIn so I guess the question just how you feeling and
[01:04:42] Lenny Rachitsky: what's next what I imagine you're gonna get a lot of calls from a lot of people but what are you
[01:04:47] planning yeah so I feel I feel proud it's been an incredible ride at LinkedIn I've you know the way
[01:04:57] Tomer Cohen: I've got to know about LinkedIn deeply the first time was when I moved to the valley and I you
[01:05:03] Tomer Cohen: know went to a lecture at Stanford about social networks in 2008 and and a read was there and he
[01:05:09] Tomer Cohen: talked about the power of being a professional communities online and I was very nerdy about it and
[01:05:15] Tomer Cohen: thought it was incredible vision had no plans to join and actually started my own company after
[01:05:20] Tomer Cohen: but as like would have it fun myself joining a few years after and just thought the mission was
[01:05:25] Tomer Cohen: incredible so in many ways it aligned with my purpose and and just was an incredible ride to be
[01:05:32] Tomer Cohen: here and I also feel very grateful I shared this with the company recently I was starting to take
[01:05:37] Tomer Cohen: learnings from my experiences here allow me from where from tough situations we had a lot of you
[01:05:43] Tomer Cohen: tough situations at LinkedIn and you know hard calls and late nights but you learned so much from
[01:05:48] Tomer Cohen: those and I just incredibly grateful and I'm excited I'm excited I love I have a bias for change I
[01:05:54] Tomer Cohen: have a bias for kind of positioning myself in a position in a place where I can learn the most
[01:05:59] Tomer Cohen: and learn a lot and it's it's incredible it's an incredible time to build so I'm just excited to be
[01:06:06] Tomer Cohen: thinking of new problem sets and new areas where I can go deep on and invest the next decade in
[01:06:13] I think it's going to take a long time for you to not feel like you're working in and to like
[01:06:16] Lenny Rachitsky: forget about all the things that you've been worrying about for so many years you know after you
[01:06:21] Tomer Cohen: build something for such a long time and I think you and I talked about it at one point that like
[01:06:26] Tomer Cohen: I think one of the best traits for a builder is to become very passionate with but they're building
[01:06:33] Tomer Cohen: really care not about the job it's really care about the product when you feel the pain when
[01:06:38] Tomer Cohen: somebody complains and and you kind of have this continuous this content and it's like for me it's
[01:06:43] Tomer Cohen: the notion of like you know raising a baby so yeah it's hard it would be hard I will always think of
[01:06:49] Tomer Cohen: LinkedIn as as one of the babies I helped grow well I'm excited to have you back some day when you
[01:06:55] Lenny Rachitsky: figure out which one to do next or and or start whatever you're doing I love that this was an excuse
[01:07:00] Lenny Rachitsky: to get to know you tell them or thank you so much for being here it was great to be here thanks
