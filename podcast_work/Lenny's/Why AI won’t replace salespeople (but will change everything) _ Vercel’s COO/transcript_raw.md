[00:00:00] I've been getting so many asks for good a market help with AI.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_00: It's just intensified because you have 10 players pursuing the
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_02: same market opportunity.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_02: And so your ability to actually bring the product to market to
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_02: differentiate yourself from the competition has become more
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_02: strategically important than it was previously.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_02: The agenda able on the podcast recently, one of her tips is you
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: don't want to be focusing on here's the pain and problem we're
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_00: solving and instead focus on here's how you will be better
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_00: than your competitors.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: 80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed to
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_02: increase upside, which is a good thing for startup founders to
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_02: understand.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_02: We all love to talk about the art of the possible.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_02: Everything we're going to enable in the future, but that's often
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_02: really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_02: or anybody else, particularly enterprises.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_02: You're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue target
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_02: next quarter.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_02: I've heard a lot about how you think about go to market as a
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_00: product.
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_00: We buy a lot of things because of how we feel about them.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_02: The experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_02: products are only different at the merger.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_02: And so then you really want to create a customer buying
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_02: journey that feels like very unique experiences.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_02: Something I've heard from so many people you work with is that
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: you're superpowers building a sales or even doesn't feel like a
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: sales or art engineers.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_00: The litmus test I have always given my sales team is if you are
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_02: an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_02: engineers are our company, it should take them 10 minutes to
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_02: figure out you aren't a product manager.

[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: This episode is brought to you by DataDog now home to
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: Epo, the leading experimentation and feature flaking platform,
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: product managers at the world's best companies use DataDog,
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: the same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: product insights to product issues like bugs, UX friction and
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: business impact.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_00: It starts with product analytics where PMs can watch replays,
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: review funnels, dive into retention and explore their growth
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_00: metrics where other tools stop DataDog goes even further.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: off and bugs and UX friction.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: Once you know where to focus, experiments prove what works.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_00: I saw this firsthand when I was at Airbnb where our
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_00: experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: work and where things went wrong.
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_00: And the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: built Epo.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: DataDog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_00: replay.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: Watch exactly how users interact with heat maps and scroll
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: maps to truly understand their behavior.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_00: And all of this is powered by feature flags that are tight
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: to real time data so that you can roll out safely, target
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_00: precisely and learn continuously.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: DataDog is more than engineering metrics.

[00:05:29] Gene, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for having me, Lenny.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_02: What I want to get out of this conversation by the end of it is to
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_00: basically have this conversation be the thing that we send people
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: when they're like, I want to get better, go to market.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to figure out what to do and get a market.
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: We send them this versus having to hire someone for a lot of money.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: And usually they can't find amazing people because they're all
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: snatched up.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: Yep.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_00: So let me start with just the basics.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: When people are here at the term, go to market.
[00:05:55] What does that mean?
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: What does that encompass?
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_00: I think there are two answers to this.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_02: Often what people think of is sort of the tip of the spear of what drives
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_02: revenue, which is marketing and sales.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_02: For me, I think of it as any function that is going to touch a
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_02: customer or make a dollar.
[00:06:13] And actually my remit at Versailles is that.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_02: So that includes marketing, sales, all of your technical sales
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_02: roles like sales engineers or post sales platform architects is
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_02: what we call them at Versailles.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_02: It's customer success.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_02: It's support.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_02: It's partnerships.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_02: And the reason I say that is my experience here at my career has
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_02: been that those functions often have this bend diagram strategy.
[00:06:41] Where marketing is pursuing one thing, it overlaps with what sales is
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_02: pursuing, but not perfectly, which also overlaps with what support is
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_02: pursuing, but not perfectly examples of this would be slightly
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_02: different, slightly differing segmentation frameworks, etc.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_02: And so one of the things I think you're going to want to see more in
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_02: this particular moment is that that become a really integrated life cycle.
[00:07:06] In particular, because I think we're going to see a lot of the functions
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_02: of go-to-market get redefined.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_02: So we've gone through a period of like hyper specialization and go-to-market,
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_02: you know, depending on how you count them, there are, you know, I think
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_02: somebody quoted like 17 different roles within go-to-market these days.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_02: And I hypothesize that a lot of those are going to start to collapse.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_02: And so if you think of go-to-market more holistically, I think you can kind
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_02: of go back to what are the jobs to be done from making a customer
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_02: prospect aware of your product all the way through to, you know,
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_02: high LTV five years on the platform fully wall to wall.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_02: And you're going to want to map that out and orchestrate it the way you
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_02: would think about that within your own product.
[00:07:54] Awesome. We're going to go through that whole cycle of go-to-market.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: But so is it safe to say just for most companies that are especially
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: starting out when they say go-to-market that mostly is sales?
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_00: And then there's marketing as a maybe a smaller fraction of that.
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_00: And then as you become more advanced and grow customer success plays into a
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_00: tech sales, things like that.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's probably where most start, you know, is getting sales or
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_02: frankly, just because a lot of companies also start PLG, you might actually
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_02: start with marketing and then you're layering in sales when it's time to do
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_02: the sales assisted and ultimately sales led portions.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_02: So I think it can, depending on your product and your initial target market,
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_02: it can either mean in marketing or sales or a combination of those two.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_02: Awesome. So essentially it's like the term go-to-market tells you what we're
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: talking about. It's how do you take your product to market?
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: Do people aware of it using it sticking with it?
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: Yep, absolutely.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_02: What has most changed in the world of go-to-market over the last few years?
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_00: You've done this for a long time at Google.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: It's stripey built for sales team.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_00: They are doing that over sales.
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_00: What's changed most in the skill and art of go-to-market?
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_00: There are a number of things.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_02: So when consumption-based business models started, I think you saw go-to-market
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_02: shift into being meaningfully more consultative because often that first
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_02: land was the very beginning of the journey and represented a very small
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_02: percent of what you were ultimately going to do with that customer.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_02: And so you had to go from being transactional to a lot more relationship-based.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_02: You had to more deeply understand what that customer was trying to do.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_02: So you could align that ultimately to your product.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_02: I think that has played out that much more with an AI.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_02: Because right now, everyone knows they need to change,
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_02: but they don't necessarily know exactly what they need to change to.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_02: Whether that's their customer facing product or their internal productivity and
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_02: workflows.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_02: And so I think you're seeing a lot more of go-to-market orgs leaning into the
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_02: art of the possible best practices, helping you actually think things through
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_02: as if they were a consultant.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_02: And so one of the things you see more of right now is for a deployed engineering,
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_02: which on some level is kind of a rebrand professional services,
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_02: but kind of not.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_02: And a big part of that is, hey, how do I actually get into your environment,
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_02: ride alongside you, better understand what you're trying to do,
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_02: and then help you actually bring the technology to life and learn a lot along
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_02: the way.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_02: Often you're not only making that customer successful, but you're then taking
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_02: all of that back to your product and engineering organization to figure out,
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_02: okay, what was generalizable that we ought to build into our offering versus what
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_02: is something that ultimately is going to be more of a professional service in the
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_02: fullness of time.
[00:10:34] So I think that has been a biggie is actually just like really getting embedded
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_02: with your customer.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_02: And then unsurprisingly, I think bringing AI to bear on the sales process is another
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_02: big one.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_02: And so you've seen the rise in probably last like 18 to 24 months of the go-to-market
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_02: engineer, which, you know, different, different folks define slightly differently,
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_02: but it's kind of bringing one technical prowess to bear on go-to-market in general.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_02: So you can have a lot better tooling, data use, et cetera, and then to increasingly
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_02: bringing AI to bear as well to rearchitect your workflows and also make it so
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_02: that it's easier to have a personalized experience with customers, but do so at
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_02: scale.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_02: Amazing.
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's follow this thread on this go-to-market engineer.
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_00: Yep.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_02: So what was it like before and what are these engineers doing at companies?
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: So I think maybe like an interesting story to tell when I, when I was at
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_02: Straype, we went to launch an outbound SDR function.
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_02: So outbound prospecting and Straype always ran lean the company at that time,
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_02: had an operating principle, which was efficiency is leverage.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_02: And so if you looked at the sales organization, I was running most companies
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_02: out there probably would have had 30 SDRs and I was going to get four.
[00:12:03] So, you know, there's no way I was going to do the typical SDR, you know, approach
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_02: and be successful.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_02: And so we thought to ourselves, okay, what can we do?
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_02: We'll be super data driven.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_02: And so we went and we started building project Rosland.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_02: Rosland is the scientist who originally mapped DNA.
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_02: And what this was was effectively a company universe.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_02: So you can think of this as like a massive database.
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_02: Every row was a different company on the planet.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_02: And every column was an attribute about that company that would help you
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_02: sell to them in a more targeted fashion.
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_02: So at Straype, an example would be like knowing that their, their business model
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_02: was a marketplace was super helpful because that would mean you wanted to sell
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_02: Straype Connect versus vanilla payments.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_02: And so the goal was basically, hey, can we create a madlibs, you know, where I will
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_02: come up with sort of a predefined email template, but 80% of it will be
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_02: fill in the blank based on the different attributes of that, that customer, right?
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_02: So if they're this industry or this business model, then pull this customer
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_02: reference, this value prop, you know, send it to this persona, not that.
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_02: And we were trying to do this in 2017.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_02: And it was very hard and didn't actually totally work.
[00:13:24] Our ability to like the false positive rate when, and we worked deeply with
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_02: data science, like just, it just never really got there.
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_02: And now that we're literally redoing here at Vercela as we speak and it actually
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_02: works. And that's because you can bring AI to bear on it.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_02: And so what's different is we now, I have a data scientist,
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_02: just like I did back in 2017, but I have a go to market engineer,
[00:13:50] whereas before I just had someone in systems that was helping me configure
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_02: outreach or sales loft.
[00:13:56] And my go to market engineer is helping me build an agent where we're coming
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_02: up with, okay, well, what's the human workflow that you would have done?
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_02: And then how do you encode that using Vercela workflows as an example,
[00:14:09] you know, in actual code, that's both deterministic and less so.
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_02: We're an agent's going out and trying to replicate what a human might have
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_02: done to produce that fill in the blank mad lives.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_02: I love the ambition of that project.
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_00: What is this like eight years ago?
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: Yes, it's such a, I love the big thinking there.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: We're going to map the entire universe of companies.
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: And then here's how we sell to them.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_00: And then just I'm trying to picture doing that without AI.
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: It's like crazy to imagine trying that without AI.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_00: And that's like so much simpler.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: Well, the thing that's amazing about that, just to geek out on it.
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_02: So I was working on that with a bunch of folks at Stripe on my team,
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_02: obviously, at a gentleman named Ben Salisman, who went on to go to Zoom info
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_02: and actually recently just founded a go to market startup that is basically
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_02: sort of productizing that concept of a company universe and then layering AI
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_02: on it on top of it.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_02: And ultimately his view is actually AI will get to the point that you won't
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_02: have to do outbound prospecting because it will just sort of company and
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_02: product match.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_02: So it's fun to sort of see back in 2017.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_02: Some of the folks doing that now work at OpenAI, the working in
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_02: Thropic, they're also doing GTM and you've got him starting, you know, a
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_02: totally AI native GTM company.
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_02: And then, you know, here I am at a resell trying to do the same.
[00:15:29] Okay.
[00:15:29] So what's cool is this is an emerging role and emerging skill that I think
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: a lot of people have recognized as something that is happening.
[00:15:37] Yeah.
[00:15:37] So one example I'm hearing of what this role does is they automate
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_00: outbound emails, essentially an outbound outreach.
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_00: They figure out they write work flows and agents that figure out here's the
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_00: company to go after.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_00: Here's how we message them.
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_00: Does that end up being kind of like an email that's custom designed and
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: written for this prospect?
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_00: That's one version.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_02: So so it's it's broader than that really.
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_02: Basically the full remit of GTM and will be to go through each of the
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_02: different functions within go to market and break down all the different
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_02: work flows that they do and then turn those into agents where, you know, AI is
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_02: better placed than the human to do that task.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_02: So right now we started with actually inbound and are now moving to
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_02: outbound because that workflow is most legible and by legible, I mean,
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_02: you can basically write it down.
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_02: It's relatively replicable, mostly deterministic.
[00:16:38] SPEAKER_02: So it's more likely that AI will do it well.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_02: And we actually built the agent and then we keep a human in the loop.
[00:16:45] But from there, we're starting to look at outbound and with an outbound,
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_02: we're starting more at the lower end of the market where you tend to, you know,
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_02: have slightly less customization because there's a single decision maker at
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_02: the company, but I think it will take a while before we're able to really do
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_02: that in a very large enterprise.
[00:17:01] There we might use an agent for research, but maybe not all the way to actually
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_02: send a message.
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_02: And that's just within the prospecting function.
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_02: So other places that we're looking at this would be for install base sales.
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_02: So again, there it's a little bit more deterministic because you've got awesome
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_02: internal data on what a customer is and isn't using what's the next best
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_02: action, what's the thing they should get most value from.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_02: So that's where we're starting to map, hey, what does that ideal workflow look
[00:17:29] like? But basically, you want to get to a state where as long as I've been in
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_02: sales, they release these annual reports that help us all benchmark ourselves
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_02: relative to one another.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_02: And one of the stats is what percent of time do your sellers actually spend
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_02: in front of customers?
[00:17:44] And you know, for the 20 years, I've been in sales.
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_02: It's always been somewhere around three to 40%.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_02: So the minority of time is actually talking to other humans.
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_02: And I think we're getting to a point where with layering in agents,
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_02: ideally, we finally get sales people to a point where they're actually spending
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_02: 70% of their time interacting with humans.
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_02: And we can get the research, the follow up, the things that are a little bit
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_02: more, you know, wrote and don't use the entirety of your human capacity
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_02: done by an agent and then sort of unleash you to go deeper with your customers.
[00:18:18] I love that this is such a great example of our AI is contributing in a very
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_00: meaningful high ROI way, taking on all this work that people, like you have to hire
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_00: say 50 SDRs as you described to do.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_00: And now you could do it a lot more.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: So it's a really cool example of leverage that AI gives you.
[00:18:36] One thing that I know a lot of people think about when they hear this is,
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_00: okay, I'm going to get more of these really bad emails trying to pitch me on
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_00: stuff and just like, this isn't going to work.
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_00: I can tell this is AI.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_00: What have you learned about how to do this where people actually receive
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_00: emails that actually convert and do our processes all always have human in the
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_02: loop. And so basically where we'll start is we take it to go to market engineer
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_02: and we have them shadow the highest performing individual in that function.
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_02: And so you can go and you shadow an SDR and you can see, oh wow, they've got
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_02: seven tabs open.
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_02: They're looking up the, you know, a person on LinkedIn, they're reading about
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_02: the company, they're doing chat, you be on this, they're, you know,
[00:19:20] looking in this database to get these sets of attributes.
[00:19:24] And so that's how you sort of inform the initial workflow.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_02: And then what we do is we let that agent make a call.
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_02: So in the specific example with, with inbound, right, you have to determine
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_02: whether or not you think the lead is likely to be qualified.
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_02: And then you have to determine what to say to it.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_02: And so we'll let the agent make those two calls.
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_02: It ultimately then does some deep research, pulls in a bunch of information
[00:19:48] SPEAKER_02: from our databases and crafts or response.
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_02: But we have a human review, all of those and actually hit send.
[00:19:55] Now for us, we had 10 SDRs doing this inbound workflow.
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_02: And now we just have one that is effectively queuing the agent, the other
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_02: nine we deployed on outbound.
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_02: So we got to move them up the value chain.
[00:20:08] At some point, I think we'll get to a place where we feel like, hey, you know,
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_02: the human reviewer is saying yes, enough of the time that we feel confident
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_02: that these will be on brand, targeted, et cetera.
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_02: But right now, we're still trying to train the agent in it, you know,
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_02: it incorporates feedback on what we choose to reject, edit, et cetera.
[00:20:31] And you sure that it's already having a lot of impact.
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_00: Like you said, you had, you said 10 SDRs and out one can do the job of 10.
[00:20:37] Yes.
[00:20:37] Well, yeah.
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_00: And we, so before we did that move, I mean, the other thing that's just
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_02: incredible about this is the person who built the lead agent was a single
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_02: GTM engineer.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_02: He spent maybe 25, 30% on his time of his time on this.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_02: It was six weeks before we felt confident going from 10 to one.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_02: So it wasn't like this was a multi quarter process.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_02: It actually moved super quickly.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_02: So and then again, now we just sort of keep that agent manager and sort of
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_02: working with the agent to get it to a point where we say, hey, we're ready to roll.
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_02: And actually throughout the process, we also tracked all of the KPIs that you
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_02: typically would hold an SDR accountable to.
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_02: So we were looking at our lead to opportunity conversion rate.
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_02: We're looking at the number of touches it takes the time to convert.
[00:21:27] And basically what we were able to do is hold that lead to opportunity conversion
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_02: rate flat.
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_02: So the agent is as good as our humans were, but it's actually condensed the number
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: of touches it takes to convert because it's so much quicker.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_02: At responding relative to leads inevitably sitting in the queue or coming at night
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_02: time and no one can get to it, that type of deal.
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_02: So that's sort of when we knew it was ready to pull nine people off and
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_02: shift them into outbound.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_02: That's incredible.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_00: That's interesting.
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_00: So you shift them to outbound.
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_00: What I love about this is this SDR that is now doing this is as you said,
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_00: doing the things they enjoy more, they're talking to customers more.
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_00: They're not doing all this kind of top of funnel, wrote work.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: I don't want to get into a whole like jobs AI discussion, but there's always
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_00: been this talk about a I SDR's basically replacing SDR's.
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_00: It feels like that's one thing where everyone's like, this is 100% going to be
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: AI in the future.
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_00: What I'm hearing here is it gives one a stair a lot more leverage and obviously
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_00: still need people running the show.
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_00: Tate, thoughts there, just like you think AI will replace all this at some point.
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_00: And then you, I don't know, you don't need sales people.
[00:22:32] I think on prospecting, it can replace a fair amount because
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_02: the average SDR wasn't doing overly sophisticated research in the first place.
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_02: So where I think the last part to go, as I mentioned, will be in deep enterprise
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_02: prospecting where you know, you can get multiple layers in an orange chart.
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_02: You've got to pick between business lines.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_02: You got to train you like those.
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_02: But I do think for the things that are more repetitive that often don't take
[00:23:07] SPEAKER_02: that much time to learn and get ramped.
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_02: AI will be good at that.
[00:23:12] And in my view, no one like graduated from college and was like, yes,
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_02: I just went to college for four years to become an SDR.
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_02: It was more, okay, that's where you are forced to start.
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_02: But I think the average SDR could have gone straight into outbound or straight
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_02: into an SMB closing role.
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_02: And so basically what we're just doing is shifting folks into something that
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_02: uses more of their full capacity right out of the gates, rather than sort of the,
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_02: you know, the forcing function of working your way up the totem pole.
[00:23:48] Awesome.
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_00: Since a lot of people listening to this orange sales people don't have a lot of background
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: and sales.
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: We've used this term SDR.
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_00: There's also the term AE.
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_00: Can you just help people understand what is SDR?
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_00: What do they do?
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: What's an AE and then what's kind of the role above?
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_02: So SDR is typically in charge of generating pipeline.
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_02: So they're meant to talk to prospective customers and get them to a point
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_02: where it is worth investing time to run them through a sales process.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_02: So you typically have two types of an SDR.
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_02: You have an inbound one.
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_02: So this is where people come to your website, they fill out contact sales.
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_02: They'll be the first call to make sure that it's actually worth a more
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_02: expensive account executive to go and run a sales process.
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_02: Or you then have outbound.
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_02: So this is where when you want to grow faster than your inbound demand,
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_02: they will go out and at this point you probably have a point of view on where
[00:24:45] SPEAKER_02: you think you have product market fit.
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_02: And so they will target that part of the market and try to drum up interest
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_02: from folks who weren't otherwise raising their hands saying I'd like to talk to you.
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_02: So that's sales development, basically pipeline generation.
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_02: Account executives are closers.
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_02: So it's their job to take somebody from, okay,
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_02: hey, I'm interested in learning about your solution.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_02: I have a legitimate problem.
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_02: I potentially could make a decision to I now believe that your product is the best
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_02: in the market and for me and I'm willing to pay for it.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_02: And then account executives, depending on the segments that your company
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_02: sells into eG small business, mid market enterprise, et cetera,
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_02: they may work their way up the food chain from selling to a smaller company,
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_02: like an SMB or a startup,
[00:25:32] those tend to be a little bit more of a transactional sale.
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_02: You often have a single decision maker to then going into a mid market or commercial
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_02: role where now maybe you have an economic buyer like somebody in finance
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_02: and a technical buyer like somebody in engineering to getting into enterprise
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_02: where you know, you know, you have procurement and you have committees
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_02: and 10 people have to weigh in and, you know, you've got to help them figure
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_02: out how to de-risk the fact that they're probably migrating from something
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_02: so much more complicated coordination effort to sell.
[00:26:05] That was extremely helpful.
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_00: So SDR pipeline generation AE closer, such a simple way of thinking about it.
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_00: Okay, this is great.
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: Going back to the GDM engineer, a few questions for people that may want to
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_00: try this at their company.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_00: What scale do you think it makes sense to start hiring for this role,
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_00: having someone automate in the go-to market process?
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_00: What's interesting about this is it will force companies to be more rigorous
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_02: about their sales process early.
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_02: So often startups when they go from founder led sales to say,
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to have my first sales person, whether that's an actual, you know,
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_02: accounting executive who has prior sales experience or your general athlete,
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_02: Wiccan Smart, who's going to go figure it out.
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_02: You know, often founders will just say, okay, sales is showing up and talking to people.
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_02: Isn't that what I just did for the last couple of years?
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_02: But actually sales is more than that.
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_02: It's a skill just like writing code as a skill or building a financial model as a skill.
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_02: It's about discovery.
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_02: So asking all the right questions that help you identify challenges in pain,
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_02: willingness to pay, etc.
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_02: And then going through a process to handle those objections and showcase where you add
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_02: enough value, such that somebody ultimately wants to hand over some money.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_02: So often, you know, startups will get, particularly ones with strong product market fit,
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_02: to pretty significant scale without really having a replicable process.
[00:27:34] And you can't really apply go-to-market engineering unless you actually have a point of view
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_02: on what best practice should look like.
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_02: And so I think basically this is going to force folks to have more of a playbook out of the
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_02: gates. What's working? What's not? Can I document it? Do I have content for the different parts of
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_02: the sales process? And then, you know, once you do that, which, you know, maybe 10 people is a good
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_02: size and skill for that. Ostensibly, you know, a GTM engineer can come in and turn that into an agent.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_02: You could also argue that if, you know, you're a founder who wants to bring in a general athlete profile,
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_02: and that person is technically minded, that you could have a hybrid AE GTM engineer
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_02: who figures out what their best practice is and then tries to turn that into an agent, you know,
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_02: that's riding alongside them and making them more effective as well. So, you know, I, I don't know
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_02: that I have a point of view yet on what's the optimal size and scale, but I forever have given
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_02: founders the advice that it's, you often want to bring in revenue operations, which is basically
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_02: the analytical arm of sales earlier than you think, because having data, having process is actually
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_02: what gives you insights as a founder into what isn't isn't working. And so I would argue just like
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_02: it's a good idea to have that sooner than later, increasingly, it'll probably be a good idea to
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_02: have GTM engine and be looking to bring agents to bear on your process at the outset.
[00:29:05] Well, we're on this topic just a quick tangent. The advice for hiring your first salesperson that I
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_00: usually hear is wait until you're around a million in ARR when you have a repeatable process you
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_00: can teach someone. Anything there is that does that seem right? What would you recommend?
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think that seems about right. I do think as a founder, you want to stay deeply connected
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_02: to customers and get it to a scale and get it to a point where you use the word, there's some
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_02: repeatability there. I think that's one of the things that not all founders get right is founders
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_02: are incredible sales people, right? They convinced a VC angel investors to fork over a bunch of money,
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_02: so clearly they're going to inspire people to buy. But if you're getting to a million in ARR and
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_02: the set of customers you have, look nothing like one another, you still have very much like an evangelist
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_02: sale, very much founder-led sale, versus if you can say, hey, I now have an ICP here or ideal customer
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_02: profile, eG something you can write down. We are good. Our product fits with startups with less than
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_02: a hundred employees who are typically building SaaS applications, right? Something like that.
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_02: Then you're probably ready to hand over the reins. Then what founders have to remember is to
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_02: actually hand over the reins. You've got to enable the person who comes in. What is it that you're
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_02: doing effectively? What's your content? What are the discovery questions you're asking? How are you
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_02: handling objections? You can transition that knowledge. Also, don't hand them over entirely. You
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_02: want to stay connected to the customer because you still have a fair amount of R&D to do to figure out
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_02: where you are. Where is the product next going to resonate? Where are you getting stock, as you
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_02: scale, etc? It's a close loop on the Go-to-Market Engineer. What's the profile of the ideal Go-to-Market
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_00: Engineer? Maybe you're first. What we have found works really well is somebody who does have Go-to-Market
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_02: experience. At Versal, our first three Go-to-Market engineers were actually sales engineers. Versal
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_02: hires very technical. Sales engineers, all of them were front-end developers before they decided
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_02: they wanted to get into sales. We just said, hey, three of you congrats here to how founding
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_02: members of our GTM-N team. In a thing that works well there is you do understand aspects of what is
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_02: good GTM, what does a process look like. It's been really interesting actually. The gentleman who runs
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_02: GTM-N for me, we were going through this lead agent and QAing it. I'm going and I'm looking at
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_02: some of the responses that we've ultimately had lead agent send and realized, oh, I wouldn't
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_02: have sent that. That's because I have 20 years of sales experience and we modeled the lead agent
[00:32:02] SPEAKER_02: off our best person but our best person who has two years of sales experience. It actually is
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_02: important to understand the art and the science of sales and how you bring best practice to bear.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_02: Either you've done it and so you know some best practice or you're going to geek out on sales,
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_02: read a bunch of books, learn a thing or two and try to incorporate some of those into your
[00:32:27] SPEAKER_02: agent development. That is really interesting. So come from the sales side, not from the engineering
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_00: side. I imagine this is such a cool opportunity for sales people to do something completely different
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_00: and move closer to engineering. Yeah, I mean we're having a lot of fun with it at Rersel in particular,
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_02: we basically get to be customers zero. So everything that we're building with agents, we're building on
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_02: Rersel's AI Cloud. So these agents are now have multiple steps that they go through so we're using
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_02: Rersel's workflow SDK and workflow offering. We use the AI gateway to call the different models that
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_02: we use to do deep research or other enrichment that we do. So for us it's great because we basically
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_02: sort of bang on everything the engineering team is building and get to go be a discerning customer
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_02: before we actually get it out the door to real customers. What a fun time to be alive.
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_00: Yes, I could tell the fun because they're having just fun. We describe it.
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_00: Stripe handles the massive scale and complexity of many of the world's fastest-scrolling enterprises,
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_00: including 78% of the Forbes AI 50 and more than half of the Fortune 100.
[00:33:40] SPEAKER_00: Enterprises like Atlassian, Figma and Urban Outfitters use Stripe to create fully branded and
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_00: customized checkout pages with access to more than 125 global payment methods. There's a reason I've
[00:33:51] SPEAKER_00: had more leaders from Stripe on this podcast than any other company. They know how to build great
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_00: products that scale and that people love. And Stripe is a lot more than payments. They've also
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_00: got a category leading billing solution and a highly optimized checkout experience built specifically
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_00: to increase your checkout conversion. Join the ranks of industry leaders like Salesforce, Open AI
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_00: and Pepsi that are using Stripe to grow faster and to grow the world's GDP. Learn how Stripe can help
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_00: your business grow at Stripe.com.
[00:34:23] Zoom me out a little bit in terms of your mentioned tools and tools that you use. I'm curious
[00:34:27] SPEAKER_00: just what are kind of the state-of-the-art tools within the go-to-market stack that you love,
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_00: that you recommend? Well, so I mean, I have an interesting answer to this. So I'll give you one,
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_02: and it's not state-of-the-art per se, although I don't mean that disparagingly. It's just that
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_02: it's been around for a while now and a lot of folks use it. But I think Gong has gotten just
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_02: meaningfully more interesting in the last year. And then second half of my question, I will get into,
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_02: I think, the calculus on build versus buy is changing. So, all right, Gong. Gong is incredible
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_02: because you can run agents against it now. So we take all of our Gong tree and scripts and we
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_02: dump them into an agent called the dealbot. And that dealbot then can do a bunch of things.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_02: So the first thing we had it do was lost opportunity review. So we had just finished Q2. We had,
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_02: you know, a list of our top losses for the quarter sorted by deal size. And we ran it against that.
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_02: And it was incredibly interesting. So the biggest loss that quarter, according to the account
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_02: executive, was lost on price. And when you ran the agent over every slack interaction, every email,
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_02: every gong call, it said, actually, you lost because you never really got in touch with economic
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_02: buyer. And when you talked to somebody about ROI and total cost of ownership, it was clear from their
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_02: reaction that they didn't really buy your math. And so really the reason we lost was an
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_02: inability to demonstrate value, which, you know, upon reflection, I've got work to do to build out
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_02: how we quantify the value of herself, which actually is very easily quantifiable. It's one of
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_02: the things I love about selling this product, but we got to codify that for the go-to-market team.
[00:36:28] So that was incredibly interesting. And now we run it against all of our lost opportunities and
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_02: actually do a much better job of categorizing why it was we really, really lost. And then either
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_02: feeding that back into the engineering team or back into marketing sales leadership on, hey,
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_02: where are we falling short in the sales process? And so that was awesome. But then we're like, well,
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_02: it's not very fun to lose. So why don't we pull that forward? And so we went from lost bot to
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_02: deal bot. And now the deal bot is running in real time. And we basically feed insights into Slack.
[00:37:04] SPEAKER_02: Versal is incredibly heavy users of Slack. So we have a channel for every single customer,
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_02: either opportunity or existing one. And so now we're feeding insights into that Slack channel,
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_02: which is, you know, hey, you're this far into the sales process and you haven't talked to an
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_02: economic buyer, you should think about that. Or hey, you just got off that call with an economic
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_02: buyer. It didn't sound like it went that well. You know, here's some things to consider and how
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_02: you might follow up. And last thing before I pause, the other thing that's really interesting and how
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_02: we're using this too is, you know, we are in this moment, right? We're like, I have never seen
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_02: an iteration velocity like exists now in my career, in my 20 plus career career has all been in tech.
[00:37:52] And so for go to market teams, that's really hard. If you were launching something every other day,
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_02: the ability to be enabled on that is actually quite challenging. And so this bot agent is now also
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_02: letting us where we're starting to go with it is we'll release something, we'll do our best to
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_02: enable the team, then we'll go run the agent across calls interactions, and we'll diagnose where we
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_02: did a bad job of objection handling where we're getting stuck. And then at the end of the week,
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_02: we can have a huddle and say, okay, what are all the places that our agent would suggest we aren't
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_02: selling effectively? And then almost like an engineering team will now run sprints, which is like
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_02: those are just bugs. They're bugs and you're going to market process. So you should not have them.
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_02: And you know, by the next week, we're going to add content to our objection handling to guide,
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_02: we're going to add content to a discovery guide. We're going to figure out something we need to
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_02: change about our demo, so on and so forth. So that's early. That's a little bit of a preview. But
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_02: but that's where we're talking about taking things right now within our our go-to-market orgs.
[00:39:00] Gene, you're blowing my mind. It's no many ways. It's just sounds so fun and just like you guys
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_00: are going to win this, what I'm feeling when I hear all this. Incredible. What I love about this is
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_00: this AI tool, this agent you built, sees things that humans were not seeing. The fact that you were
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_00: surprised of just like this is a completely different conclusion is such a big deal. This is the
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: whole promise of the AI. It's going to do things we aren't even thinking about are capable of.
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_00: It is. We had a really interesting one of things we're doing at ourselves. So, you know, we have
[00:39:31] SPEAKER_02: any AI clouds, so people use that to put AI native features into their customer facing applications,
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_02: but they're also using it to build internal applications to improve productivity or outcomes.
[00:39:42] SPEAKER_02: And we are talking to a very large airline. And that airline obviously gets tons and tons of
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_02: support queries. So of course, they would want to go apply AI to, hey, how can we have AI answer
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_02: these so that our cost to support goes down? Sort of the obvious thing. But the more interesting
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_02: conversation was actually with one of the sea level executives who said, we also actually
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_02: transcribe every single one of those support calls. And so, what I really want to know is why are
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_02: they calling and how do I make it so that fewer people call the next week? And so, again, this is
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_02: now with AI, you can rapidly go through all of that content and actually be able to much more
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_02: quickly than having a human, you know, in your CRM sort of pick some status. Why it was that
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_02: folks were calling the airline this week and what if anything you can do to make it less the case
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_02: next week? I imagine many people hearing this are like, I need one of these deal bots and last
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_00: bots. These are all internal products that you all built. Yes. Is there anything that you've learned
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_00: about making them does good? Any tips you can share of here is that I make a really good bot for sales?
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_00: Yes. So actually, that's the second half of my answer that I forgot to,
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_02: forgot, which is sort of like build versus biocalculus. So I think one of our learnings is that it's not
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_02: that hard to build these agents and they aren't that expensive either. So, you know, I mentioned the
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_02: lead agent that was a six week process with one human a third of his time. That deal bot, the
[00:41:20] SPEAKER_02: last bot version was like two days. Like basically, we rift on it, he had it 40 hours later.
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_02: You know, now we're continuing to refine it for the other things I mentioned. And what's also
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_02: interesting about them is they, you know, for better for worse for brissel, but that lead agent,
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_02: which runs full stack on brissel, will cost us about a thousand dollars to run for the entire year.
[00:41:48] So if you remember, I told you we had 10 people in the SDR function. So I'm paying well over a million
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_02: dollars for that from a salary perspective. I got that down to one and then behind that, I have a
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_02: lead agent that costs a thousand bucks. So that's like a, you know, 90 plus percent reduction in total
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_02: cost there. So, and you know, there are a lot, there's lots of software for agents on out there right
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_02: now. And I think one of things we're learning is because this whole space is so nascent often your own
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_02: esoteric context, you know, your content, your workflow is really key to unlocking the power of the
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_02: agent. And so I think there's real value in experimenting with your own internal agent development.
[00:42:38] We may ultimately end up on, you know, better integrated agent platforms in the fullness of time.
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_02: Or we may find that the CIO increasingly goes from a procure of software to a builder of software
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_02: and you'll have an AI internal platform with a thousand agents running across your org. I'm not
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_02: really sure yet. But I certainly think there's value in trying it yourself because you may find
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_02: that it's meaningful easier than you think. And you get returns pretty quickly.
[00:43:10] So what I'm hearing here is that you're finding that there are not tools out there to plug in play.
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_00: The alpha is essentially in building your own stuff. I think that's partially true. And I think
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_02: because you also have all these tools proliferating right now, you get into the perennial problem where
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_02: you wind up with 20 of them to do, you know, the 20 jobs to be done basically. Rather than an
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_02: integrated platform that's doing all of them, I'm hearing this a lot actually when I'm talking
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_02: to customers right now where their biggest issue in deploying AI is actually just getting through
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_02: procurement. And it's sort of because everyone's got an AI mandate, you kind of have a blank check.
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_02: I recently heard the term of instead of ARR, it's ERR, which is experimental run rate revenue,
[00:44:01] which is to say, you know, everyone's out there sort of, hey, we're going to give this thing a go
[00:44:05] SPEAKER_02: for a year and then TVD on whether or not, you know, we keep it. But, you know, basically you're having
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_02: to procure 20 different things because most things are getting off the ground. And so, you know,
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_02: they're solving something relatively narrow and that'll change in the fullness of time. But I do
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_02: think there's an opportunity to figure out, hey, where do I likely have a more specific workflow,
[00:44:25] SPEAKER_02: you know, internally for that, it might be worth building your own agent. And then maybe for
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_02: the things that are a little bit more generalizable, you go get something off the shelf.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_02: Are there any platforms or tools that you want to shut out that allow you to build these agents
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_00: so quickly? I know they sit on for sale, so shut out for sale. But just anything that you point
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_00: people to you to like are these SDR, these GTI engineers, they're former salespeople. Are they
[00:44:48] SPEAKER_00: learning to code or they buy coding these agents? Well, so our sales engineers all have
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_02: a C-S degrees. So they were engineers in a sales capacity. So they're writing code. And actually,
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_02: these agents, they're building directly on Versaul. So you get the AI gateway that lets you,
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_02: you know, call different models. You have a sandbox. If you're running on trusted code, you've got
[00:45:13] SPEAKER_02: workflows that let you build the process. You got fluid compute, which lets you really efficiently
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_02: use compute when you only need it. So we're just sort of building it from the ground up here,
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_02: because again, it's not that hard now. You do need to write code for that. Certainly, there are
[00:45:32] SPEAKER_02: a lot of vibe coding tools out there that also give you more kind of workflow builders that are
[00:45:39] SPEAKER_02: somewhere between fully wizzy wig, almost like drag and drop. And a little bit more code forward.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_02: So you got a bunch out there along those lines. But, you know, I do think we've sort of found like
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_02: one of the reasons actually the GTM end team at Versaul can build these agents so easily is because
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_02: the Versaul platform is making it that easy to use our framework to find infrastructure and get
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_02: that agent onto into production really very rapidly. What a neat unfair advantage you all have to do
[00:46:13] SPEAKER_00: this. Yes, it is fun to like, I mean, I do think this company is better than any I've seen at
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_02: eating its own dog food. And just everyone is constantly, we say, Versaul builds Versaul with Versaul.
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_02: So you're just always looking for ways to, hey, how can we use our product to go do what we need to do?
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_02: And as a result, either understand then what a customer would want or what's missing from our product
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_02: that we could go make better. Along these lines, something that's already come across a lot in the
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_00: way that you described this stuff is I've heard a lot about how you think about Go-to-Market as a
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_00: product. A lot of people are saying this as I've said, a product builder. So I think this is a really
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_00: nice way of thinking about Go-to-Market. I'm guessing you've already talked about elements of this,
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_00: but just what's a way to think about Go-to-Market as a product?
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I've always, so I had this realization probably a little over a decade ago in my career.
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_02: So my first job out of college was working on Gmail in 2004. So Gmail launched on April 1st,
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_02: I joined on June 1st. And as I'm sure you'll remember as well, Gmail was this incredible
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_02: innovation, massive JavaScript application that didn't really exist at the time,
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_02: and it had this gig of storage. It was a full year before Yahoo Mail caught up and even
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_02: longer before Hotmail and others did. So that was the level of technical differentiation between Gmail
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_02: and the next best. And a decade later, you had cloud computing, enabling folks to do stuff that you
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_02: never would have been able to do previously. And so I felt like software is starting to
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_02: commoditize a little bit. And so when that happens, when technical differentiation narrows,
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_02: what are other things that will differentiate you? And thinking outside of tech, we buy a lot
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_02: of things because of how we feel about them. And so I started to develop this thesis that actually
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_02: the experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_02: and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the margin.
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_02: And so if you believe that, then you really want to create a customer buying journey that
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_02: feels like very unique experiences. And so we did a lot of this at Stripe, and now we're looking
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_02: to replicate this here. But an example of one of the things I think we did really nicely at Stripe
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_02: was a lot of companies sales, sort of the first call after you're qualified, we've decided
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_02: you're worth engaging sales processes discovery, which is basically let me ask you a lot of questions
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_02: to try to under uncover pain, figure out where buying power lies, etc. And so that is kind of
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_02: boring sometimes for a customer, you're basically being quizzed often on the phone. And so what we
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_02: started to do at Stripe was that first session was a white boarding session. And we would actually
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_02: get together and have you draw your architecture for payments and all the other things that were
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_02: under the hood to enable you to take money and drive customer outcomes. And through that, we would
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_02: learn a ton about what was in your stack, what we were going to have to compete with, displays were
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_02: value lied. But the customer also learned a lot themselves because in many cases they'd never
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_02: drawn their architecture diagram. And so they left that meeting with an asset and a sense of like,
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_02: wow, this is a really collaborative person who's like deeply interested in helping me like, you
[00:49:53] SPEAKER_02: know, develop a mental model for how to think about this. And then we had other things that we
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_02: would do. So that's sort of how I think about building go to market like a product is basically
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_02: you need to go through from the first time you become aware of that the company exists to again,
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_02: that sort of five year heavily retained wall to wall customer a set of experiences. And those
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_02: experiences can feel transactional, flat boring, or they can feel very human, personalized and unique.
[00:50:26] And so, you know, we try to go map those out and figure out how do you, you know, bring the product
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_02: to bear, make it really human. And hopefully that creates a customer for life in the end.
[00:50:37] SPEAKER_02: I love that whiteboarding example. Are there any other examples of what you've done to make it
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_00: actually work really well in this way? Yeah, another principle we really developed this at
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_02: Stripe 2 and I brought it to to Versailles was just the idea of adding value at any touch point
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_02: regardless of whether or not that customer bought. Because even if customers don't buy, you often
[00:51:01] find that if you miss them on that buying cycle three or four years later when they're in another
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_02: buying cycle, they do come back. You know, I was at Stripe for nine years and so I saw the number
[00:51:11] SPEAKER_02: of customers that we lost and then half a decade later here they are and they bought. So that
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_02: was sort of another one. So, you know, examples of this that we're doing at Versailles is we,
[00:51:25] SPEAKER_02: you can, there's great data on the internet that helps people understand the performance of their
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_02: website and how fast your website is. Actually, impacts SEO and SEO impacts,
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_02: and everybody's thinking about a.o right now. And so, you know, one of the things we try to do when
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_02: we reach out is actually give folks insight immediately into how they're performing on an absolute
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_02: basis, how they're performing relative to peers. So, ideally, you know, that peaks are interest
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_02: and you want to learn more from us. But even if it doesn't, you still have insights that you may or
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_02: may not have been aware of that may be make you contemplate whether or not you've got the optimal setup.
[00:52:07] SPEAKER_02: Awesome. So, what I'm hearing here is when you say think of it like a product that's basically a
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_00: product person thinks about the experience of their product that every step of the journey,
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_00: here's the flow step one two three four five, how do we make every step awesome keep them going along
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_00: that journey. And so, what you think about is just from the prospects perspective, how do we make
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_00: every step of that journey awesome continue them down that journey. Yeah. Yeah. How do you make it be an
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_02: experience rather than a transaction? We're just like feel like sales coming at you trying to sell
[00:52:37] SPEAKER_00: you stuff. Yeah. Okay. Staying along this track of being staying tactical. I want to go even further
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_00: there. So, what are just some go to market tactics that you find really effective these days for
[00:52:50] SPEAKER_00: people trying to just to be more successful in getting people to pay attention to their stuff to
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_00: buy their stuff? I mean, one, I would sort of say dub tails with where I just ended, but is
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_02: what are the unique insights that you can bring to bear about your product or, you know, how that
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_02: that customer may be in a sub optimal state. So, I do think investing in data to tease that out is
[00:53:18] SPEAKER_02: is one thing. I think the other thing this is straightforward, but often not done in IF is like
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_02: a lot of good companies invest in docs, you know, good thing to do. And, but they, they stop there.
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_02: And particularly if you're selling into a slightly larger company doing things like, you know,
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_02: AWS calls it well-architected guides or blueprints. A lot of customers particularly larger ones,
[00:53:48] SPEAKER_02: really want to know the best practice for how exactly to implement your product in with their
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_02: particular setup. A great example of this, which is from Stripe was, you know, Stripe was excellent
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_02: at marketplaces, most, you know, lift, Instacart, DoorDash. They were all on Stripe. And so Stripe
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_02: definitely knew the best way to set up payments for a marketplace because we'd seen them all. And so
[00:54:13] when you then would go and sell a marketplace and, you know, say, oh, yeah, we've got docs go check
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_02: them out. They didn't like that, right? Because they're like, hey, every marketplace runs on Stripe. I
[00:54:22] SPEAKER_02: don't want to look at generic docs. I want you to tell me what's the best way to set up payments for
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_02: a marketplace. And so I think that's another key thing to be doing, particularly as you move past
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_02: that sort of solo developer startup founder as potentially a target audience. And then I know this
[00:54:40] SPEAKER_02: is a tactic per se. But I do think just a good reminder for founders in particular who are still
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_02: in that maybe founder led sales moment is just the value of really good discovery. I often find
[00:54:57] SPEAKER_02: founders are so in, you know, so excited about talking about their product or, you know, you ask
[00:55:04] SPEAKER_02: one question and now they've got a hook of like, oh, I can fix that for you. But excellent sales
[00:55:10] SPEAKER_02: people typically will talk well under half the time in a conversation because they're out asking
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_02: questions, probing, often helping a customer arrive at conclusions on their own. And so learning how
[00:55:27] SPEAKER_02: to do five y's go deep rather than immediately going into problem solving mode, you know, if they
[00:55:34] SPEAKER_02: ask a question, you respond often if they ask a question, you should ask a question about the
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_02: question and then respond, right? So learning to be great at that, I think differentiates people.
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_02: So the last tip, I think there's something a lot of I bet everyone could learn and just listen more
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_00: and talk less. Yep. On that first piece of advice, this kind of sharing unique insights and how
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_00: you're suboptimal, is there an example you could share how you did that? Maybe a story of just how
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_00: you convince someone you're selling Striper, Versailles, like care or something you're missing. Here's
[00:56:02] SPEAKER_00: how this could help you become much better. So with Versailles, the sort of is giving an example,
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_02: but I'll make it more specific. So, you know, the performance point, you can go and look at core
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_02: web titles. And so we can actually see the different things within their site that are fast,
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_02: or, you know, load correctly, etc. So that we then, so anyone can go look that up, but what we can do
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_02: is actually then help with benchmarking relative to peers. So that's been a big one that we've
[00:56:37] SPEAKER_02: gone out and done. The other one that we've spent some good time on is just around helping
[00:56:44] customers understand MCP servers and when it would make sense to use one. So I think, you know,
[00:56:52] SPEAKER_02: those are all the rage, but often people don't know how to contemplate them within their own
[00:56:56] SPEAKER_02: product. So that was another one that we've gone pretty deep on. And then related to the first one
[00:57:02] SPEAKER_02: is AEO, Answer Engine Optimization, it's actually, you know, somewhat tangential to Versailles,
[00:57:09] SPEAKER_02: right? So we drive performance, performance drives SEO, SEO is an input into AEO, but we have
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_02: spent a ton of time sharing insights on AEO because we ourselves focus deeply on it and think we
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_02: understand it better than many. And so again, as part of just building a trusted relationship,
[00:57:27] SPEAKER_02: you know, folks may go from those AMAs or that content into, okay, great, you taught me a lot,
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_02: and therefore I want Versailles to help me with performance. But in many cases, they actually now
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_02: are just like, this is a company that seems insightful, seems like one I can learn from,
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_02: and now I'm going to pay a little bit more attention to them. And over the fullness of time,
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_02: maybe, you know, they see something that triggers them to decide now is the time I want to go
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_02: investigate that aspect of Versailles. Awesome. So what I'm hearing here in many ways in this
[00:57:57] SPEAKER_00: resonates a gin able on the podcast recently and it was all about sales skills and how to sell.
[00:58:02] SPEAKER_00: Nice. And one of her tips is you don't want to be focusing on here's the pain and problem we're
[00:58:07] SPEAKER_00: solving and instead focus on here's how you will be better than your competitors. Here's a big gap
[00:58:12] SPEAKER_00: and alpha that you can achieve if you use say, Versailles. So here's like you, you're missing out
[00:58:18] SPEAKER_00: on speed and you're going to get screwed in AEO and all these things. Here's like how you can
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_00: architect your entire payments art system to be top tier. Does that resonate? Yeah, it uh there's,
[00:58:29] SPEAKER_02: I was told this stat, it's round number. So I can't imagine it's entirely accurate, but um,
[00:58:36] SPEAKER_02: you know, basically that um customers 80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed
[00:58:46] SPEAKER_02: to the other one out of five to increase upside, which is a good thing again for startup founders
[00:58:52] SPEAKER_02: to understand. So, you know, we all love to talk about the art of the possible, you know, uh everything
[00:58:58] SPEAKER_02: we're going to enable in the future. It's very exciting. Everyone's visionaries, right? But um,
[00:59:04] SPEAKER_02: that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder. Um, and for everybody else,
[00:59:10] SPEAKER_02: uh, you know, it particularly enterprises, you're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_02: target next quarter, uh, the risk of having a comp, you know, being outdone by the competition,
[00:59:25] SPEAKER_02: the risk of having brand damage, etc. And so it's really hard actually for many startups to make
[00:59:33] SPEAKER_02: that pivot because it feels off brand, but it does actually drive more buying behavior is setting up
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_02: a little bit of that concern that either I might not be well positioned or again through good
[00:59:47] SPEAKER_02: question asking, I know exactly where I'm not well positioned and you can help me de-risk that.
[00:59:52] SPEAKER_02: That is such an important stat you share. This has come up actually on before in this podcast that
[00:59:58] SPEAKER_00: buying people are buying in large part to reduce risks. It basically not hurt themselves in their
[01:00:05] SPEAKER_00: career, not her company. Like that's a bigger factor in the buying decision than I have this problem
[01:00:09] SPEAKER_00: when you just solve it. Okay, thank you for solving. And the way April done for Kim and the podcast
[01:00:13] SPEAKER_00: and talking about this have just like, like it's such a massive career bet. We are going to bring in
[01:00:19] SPEAKER_00: product X and it's going to become like Stripe. Let's say, let's not talk about yourself.
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_00: Well, let's say Stripe, we're going to adopt Stripe. That's like a huge decision. If it doesn't go
[01:00:27] SPEAKER_00: well, your career has hurt, your manager's going to be mad at you. It's going to set your company
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_00: back. Yeah. So a lot of the buying decision, as you've said, is I just don't want to screw this up.
[01:00:35] SPEAKER_00: Right. Absolutely. Okay. Along the line of tactics, something that I know you're a big fan of and
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_00: help people think about is segmentation. Yes. This is something a lot of founders struggle with. They
[01:00:47] SPEAKER_00: know, okay, I need to figure out my segmentation strategy and hero go and after. Can you just kind of
[01:00:51] SPEAKER_00: give us a primer on segmentation? What people should know about why this is important and then how
[01:00:56] SPEAKER_00: they might approach this? Yeah. So segmentation is basically how do you carve up the world of
[01:01:03] SPEAKER_02: companies that exist on the planet? To reason about them, where are they buy differently?
[01:01:11] So I'll give examples from Stripe and Versailles to bring this home. So a very typical company
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_02: segmentation is small, medium, large. That's a rational way to do things. Small, you often have
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_02: a single decision maker, medium, you know, a small team and large. It's complex as a committee, etc.
[01:01:33] SPEAKER_02: So the buying process does change across SMB mid-market enterprise. But if you stop there,
[01:01:41] SPEAKER_02: you are likely missing. Okay. But what are the things within your offering that also change the
[01:01:47] SPEAKER_02: way something gets sold? So at Stripe, there were two ways we further cut the business.
[01:01:56] Way one was, so think of segmentation as a graph. So x-axis was size, so small, medium, large.
[01:02:04] SPEAKER_02: Y-axis was growth potential. And that was important for Stripe because it was a consumption-based
[01:02:09] SPEAKER_02: business. So if you were going to grow at 200% year on year, you were more valuable to Stripe than
[01:02:14] SPEAKER_02: if you were going to grow at 8% year on year. And so we wanted to spend more time, spend more money
[01:02:20] SPEAKER_02: going after the 200% rowers than the 8%. So that was one that informed your strategy on who you
[01:02:26] SPEAKER_02: targeted. And then for Stripe, the other thing that we cut it was business model. So are you a B2B?
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_02: Are you B2C? Are you B2B, EGIA platform, or B2B2C, EG market place? And why is that relevant? Well,
[01:02:42] SPEAKER_02: if you're B2B, you were going to need business payments, right? Credit card was useful for a PLG
[01:02:47] SPEAKER_02: function, PLG sale, but you were going to need ACH wires, etc. And you probably had a recurring
[01:02:55] SPEAKER_02: business. So you were going to want Stripe billing. If you were B2C, that's consumer. So you're
[01:03:00] SPEAKER_02: going to want consumer payments. Apple pay is super important. If you were in the platform or
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_02: the marketplace, you were going to buy or connect product. So it helped us basically then craft
[01:03:11] SPEAKER_02: a more targeted and replicable sales for sale, sort of similar deals. So small, medium, large,
[01:03:17] SPEAKER_02: buying complexity. We also do the same thing on growth potential because we are similarly a
[01:03:22] SPEAKER_02: consumption-based business. But for us, a couple other things on the X-axis, we layer in promote,
[01:03:32] SPEAKER_02: which is one of the things that is observable is site traffic on the internet. So Google publishes
[01:03:40] SPEAKER_02: a crux score, which is basically they have a bunch of data in Chrome. And so they know that Lenny's
[01:03:46] SPEAKER_02: site gets a million XC amount. That gene site does. And so basically, if you're a small company,
[01:03:56] SPEAKER_02: but you have super high traffic, that's going to be more complex. Versals going to make more money.
[01:04:00] SPEAKER_02: And so we want to promote you. So great example of this would be opening eye. Opening eye, I forget
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_02: these days, how many employees it has. Let's say it's 3,000. It's probably more than that at this
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_02: point. But so that's going to put it in the mid-market at most companies. But they are top 25
[01:04:18] SPEAKER_02: traffic site on the internet. So for us, that's going to push them in our enterprise because we need
[01:04:23] SPEAKER_02: to go lean in with a much more in-depth sales process. And then the other thing we layer on is
[01:04:33] SPEAKER_02: workload type. So if you are an e-commerce company, that's going to be a very different sale.
[01:04:39] SPEAKER_02: We're going to have to you actually use different language. You talk about
[01:04:43] listing pages and product description pages. And you've got an order management system as the back end.
[01:04:50] SPEAKER_02: Super different from a crypto company where you might be running souped and that's on AWS.
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_02: And so again, that helps us start to then have a really different buying content for you.
[01:05:03] SPEAKER_02: Okay, this is awesome. So essentially what you do is you break up this universe going back to
[01:05:08] SPEAKER_00: your original story. It's right into helping sort essentially which companies are most likely to
[01:05:14] SPEAKER_00: buy your product. And what you're coming up with is these attributes that are correlated with. They
[01:05:19] SPEAKER_00: are likely to be great potential customers. Do you recommend using this XY axis as the approach versus
[01:05:27] SPEAKER_00: something else? Like a spreadsheet with like five columns. Like I don't know. How do you start?
[01:05:31] SPEAKER_00: There's probably something to be said for XY. Like I do think size is going to play into
[01:05:35] SPEAKER_02: most buying decisions. And then these days there is a fair amount of consumption happening. So
[01:05:42] SPEAKER_02: they'll be aspects of this that I think are somewhat universal. But I think basically like when I
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_02: came to Priscilla's new product product offering for me, it's a new market. I had a lot to learn.
[01:05:53] SPEAKER_02: But this is one of the first things I did in the first 30 days. And so basically I sat down
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_02: with the gentleman, Abby, who leads data science here. And you know, said, okay, what what drives
[01:06:07] SPEAKER_02: revenue? So what are what are the things that you can look at X and T about a customer to know
[01:06:13] SPEAKER_02: this person's likely to pay us $100,000 versus a million? Those that's probably going to be part of
[01:06:19] SPEAKER_02: a segmentation framework. And then similarly, okay, where can we how how what attributes would we look
[01:06:26] SPEAKER_02: for to cluster where we seem to be winning repeatedly? And that was how we ultimately got at,
[01:06:33] SPEAKER_02: okay, Crux rank is going to be super important. Because what you pay, Risselle is correlated with
[01:06:38] SPEAKER_02: your traffic. And then workload type was super important as well. So you know, and for for
[01:06:46] SPEAKER_02: Risselle, when we did that, it was really interesting. Because you know, we saw wow, like we have a
[01:06:53] SPEAKER_02: lot of penetration and Ecom, not not that surprising actually given that we drive highly performant
[01:07:01] SPEAKER_02: sites and Ecom having a super fast performance say really matters. But you know, at the time,
[01:07:08] SPEAKER_02: if you looked at as an example, an enterprise SaaS companies, we didn't have a lot of penetration.
[01:07:15] SPEAKER_02: Even though you would have thought, okay, front end cloud, very developer oriented, of course,
[01:07:18] SPEAKER_02: software companies would be honest. But in enterprise, most of those companies built that SaaS
[01:07:23] SPEAKER_02: offering before Risselle existed. And so, you know, migrating to underline or two million lines of code,
[01:07:30] SPEAKER_02: you know, to sell that's a big lift, right? So it helped us really understand where are we winning,
[01:07:35] SPEAKER_02: where are we not? You know, and now as an example, like in within SaaS companies in enterprise,
[01:07:41] SPEAKER_02: we're actually seeing a lot of interest in AI cloud. Because those are some of the earlier adopters
[01:07:47] SPEAKER_02: of, hey, let's add AI native functionality to our existing SaaS app. And so again, it helps us figure
[01:07:53] SPEAKER_02: out what to turn it where. Okay. So essentially doing kind of this regression analysis on what's
[01:07:58] SPEAKER_00: working. And then here's the attributes that are most correlated with success. Something I always
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_00: recommend when founders ask me for, how do I figure out my SAP, how do I figure out where to focus?
[01:08:07] SPEAKER_00: My heuristic is just think of three attributes that narrow them down. So it's like series A company
[01:08:12] SPEAKER_00: with that's angel ed that's a marketplace. So I feel like a good like just rule of thumb just to
[01:08:18] SPEAKER_00: start. Yeah, I think like beyond three, like, you know, it's that's getting pretty detailed. And
[01:08:23] SPEAKER_02: reasonably speaking, you're not going to cut like you have five sellers. So you're, what are you
[01:08:27] SPEAKER_02: going to put one seller in five different segments? So I do think three is something you can reason
[01:08:33] SPEAKER_02: about. The other thing I'll say on this topic that I think is really important is a lot of times
[01:08:37] SPEAKER_02: folks think segmentation is a go-to-market thing. I really think it's a company thing. So when you
[01:08:42] join Versel, I actually deliver in every new hires first week of one of our company values is KYC,
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_02: or your customer. And I deliver the KYC section. And you know, talk through our segmentation framework,
[01:08:59] SPEAKER_02: how our customer base maps into those segments. Because it's really important as, you know,
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_02: those new product managers leave the room that when they're building something, they think to
[01:09:07] SPEAKER_02: themselves, okay, I'm building a new backend product. Who is this targeted at? Is it targeted at
[01:09:12] SPEAKER_02: an enterprise or a startup? You know, basically, do I have a point of view on where I'm trying to win
[01:09:19] SPEAKER_02: and why? And if you're doing that out of the gates, then it's much easier to then go speak the
[01:09:24] SPEAKER_02: same language with a go-to-market org and figure out, okay, how are we going to take that to market
[01:09:28] SPEAKER_02: in line with the other motions that we have in play? Okay, this is a great segue to, there's a
[01:09:33] SPEAKER_00: couple other things I want to talk about. One is something I've heard from so many people you work
[01:09:37] SPEAKER_00: with is that you're amazing at building a go-to-market org that works really well with product and
[01:09:43] SPEAKER_00: engineering. So I'll read this quote from your former colleague Kate Jensen. She said that you're
[01:09:48] SPEAKER_00: superpowers building a sales org that doesn't feel like a sales org to engineers. So the question
[01:09:53] SPEAKER_00: she suggested asked just like, what does it take to do that? What are the ingredients to building
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_00: a sales org that engineers and product teams really like working with? The litmus test I have
[01:10:00] SPEAKER_02: always given my sales team is if you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front
[01:10:08] SPEAKER_02: of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product
[01:10:14] SPEAKER_02: manager. And what I'm trying to get across is you need to have incredible product depth.
[01:10:20] SPEAKER_02: And the reason for that is twofold. One, it gives you credibility with the product and engineering
[01:10:27] SPEAKER_02: org. And two, I also believe that the best go-to-market orgs on the planet are equal parts
[01:10:34] SPEAKER_02: revenue driving and R&D. And the reason I emphasize the latter is if you think about a product
[01:10:42] SPEAKER_02: management organization, you know, you may have a UXR team, you know, I'm doing research, product
[01:10:47] SPEAKER_02: managers certainly should be out talking to customers. Well, if I have a 20% sales team, think of
[01:10:54] the number of customers that we talk to in a week. And so if we can do an excellent job of
[01:11:00] SPEAKER_02: translating all of that feedback into signal and then feeding that into the roadmap, you know,
[01:11:08] SPEAKER_02: we can be actually an extension of the product management org. But that takes being really good
[01:11:15] SPEAKER_02: at discerning signal from noise, understanding when something is an objection that should be
[01:11:19] SPEAKER_02: overcome versus, you know, a market, an opportunity in the market. So I think I think those things
[01:11:26] SPEAKER_02: have helped. I just love this as a product manager, maybe for product manager, I don't know what
[01:11:31] SPEAKER_00: the hell I am these days. I just love the idea of the salesperson, like you not knowing the difference
[01:11:36] SPEAKER_00: between a product manager and a salesperson. The most classic challenge is sales orgs,
[01:11:41] SPEAKER_00: I'll ask for all these features. Yes. And PMs are constantly having to push back and think about
[01:11:45] SPEAKER_00: this as a fit into everything. So it feels like that's a big part of this is to understand that
[01:11:50] SPEAKER_00: deeply. Yeah, you want a sales, you want a sales org that can think like a general manager. So,
[01:11:58] SPEAKER_02: you know, that's not just trying to get deals done, but is trying to help build a business. And so,
[01:12:04] SPEAKER_02: again, nose, wind to say no, nose, wind to objection handle versus nose. Hey, I've actually heard this
[01:12:09] SPEAKER_02: on last three calls. And I do think this would be a really big unlock that would make us more
[01:12:15] SPEAKER_02: competitive, you know, would be something that knew that nobody's doing. So, you know, I think
[01:12:21] SPEAKER_02: that takes looking for a profile that both has sales skills, but also is going to think with,
[01:12:27] SPEAKER_02: you know, that product mindset. I love that. Okay. So another quote from Claire Hughes Johnson
[01:12:33] SPEAKER_00: former podcast guest, amazing sales leader worked with you at Stripe. She said something along these
[01:12:39] SPEAKER_00: lines, but a little different. Agenis probably the best good a market person at connecting with product
[01:12:43] SPEAKER_00: and engineering, deeply understanding the product and providing the most valuable input to her
[01:12:48] SPEAKER_00: counterparts of any I've ever seen. It sounds like just another ingredient here is just sales feeling
[01:12:54] SPEAKER_00: like a real partner to product and engineering. Actually, not just being like, hey, do these things
[01:12:58] SPEAKER_00: for me, but actually feeling like a partner. You know, ultimately, company strategy is basically
[01:13:06] SPEAKER_02: product strategy meets go to market strategy, right? And so I spend, I guess as a go to market leader,
[01:13:14] SPEAKER_02: I'm constantly trying to figure out, you know, how do I make more money more efficiently? And you
[01:13:21] SPEAKER_02: typically do that by having a winning product in the market that is well commercialized. And so that
[01:13:27] SPEAKER_02: means that I, I really lean into thinking about product strategy and thinking about pricing strategy.
[01:13:34] SPEAKER_02: Because if those two things are optimal, you're, you know, you're going to win more often,
[01:13:38] SPEAKER_02: and they'll be less friction in it. And so that's sort of where you've got to put as a revenue
[01:13:44] SPEAKER_02: leader like a GM hat on and not just think, how do I sell? But actually, how do I, how do I
[01:13:52] SPEAKER_02: enable the insights I'm getting from talking to customers constantly to have the company strategy be
[01:13:59] SPEAKER_02: more effective? Speaking of product, going in a slightly different direction, PLG product-like
[01:14:04] SPEAKER_00: growth was, it felt like it was very hot for a while where everyone's like, you got to go PLG,
[01:14:09] SPEAKER_00: that's the only way to win now. It's impossible to do sales. There's no features PLG. It feels like
[01:14:15] SPEAKER_00: that's gone away in, in large part, obviously, still companies grow through PLG and work through PLG.
[01:14:20] SPEAKER_00: Let's just kind of your thoughts on PLG and when does it make sense for a company these days to
[01:14:24] SPEAKER_00: actually think this is how they will grow for a while? I think a lot, PLG makes sense for a lot
[01:14:30] SPEAKER_02: of companies at the outset, unless you are very explicitly building a product for enterprise.
[01:14:38] SPEAKER_02: So, Sierra as an example, right? Like they are very clearly going after global 2000 or, you know,
[01:14:45] SPEAKER_02: something close to that. So PLG is not going to be overly useful to them because they are trying
[01:14:49] SPEAKER_02: to win eight figure deals from day one. But for a lot of products, folks are targeting a startup,
[01:14:56] SPEAKER_02: our audience at the outset, and then they're adding more functionality so that they can ultimately
[01:15:00] SPEAKER_02: continue to scale up market. So, I think PLG is still super relevant. It's a major driver of
[01:15:06] SPEAKER_02: results growth. It was a big driver of straits growth. The thing that folks get wrong is,
[01:15:13] SPEAKER_02: it does typically have a ceiling. So, people are generally not going to, you know,
[01:15:20] SPEAKER_02: give you a million dollars via self-serve flow. So, at some point, if you want to sustain growth rates,
[01:15:29] SPEAKER_02: you're going to have to have your deal sizes get bigger and bigger. And where I think folks get
[01:15:35] SPEAKER_02: stock is waiting too long on PLG because it does take a while to build a replicable sales process
[01:15:43] SPEAKER_02: and a sales process, which often you're getting fed by inbound at the beginning. And then you
[01:15:48] SPEAKER_02: got to add outbound. It takes a while actually to turn outbound into a predictable engine. So,
[01:15:54] SPEAKER_02: I think where you see companies hit walls is just when they don't add the sales portion of it soon
[01:15:59] SPEAKER_02: enough. So, essentially, every company ends up having to build a sales org, some start product
[01:16:05] SPEAKER_00: led and then add sales. So, I'm just start sales and have it from the beginning.
[01:16:09] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I would agree. There are probably some good examples of large vertical SaaS platforms that
[01:16:17] SPEAKER_02: are SMB, but even they wind up with a velocity sales team. So, yeah, I don't know that I can think of
[01:16:26] SPEAKER_02: like a hundred billion dollar company. That's PLG only.
[01:16:29] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like you just feel like you're losing money on a table, even if you are growing really fast.
[01:16:34] SPEAKER_00: I know that last year was a long time PLG company, but eventually succumbed.
[01:16:42] SPEAKER_00: You mentioned pricing. I know you have strong opinions on pricing and pricing strategy.
[01:16:47] SPEAKER_00: It's just like a couple of tips you might share with someone thinking about how to price their product.
[01:16:52] Yeah, so I kind of got a theme, but I think the first thing is like you got to think about pricing
[01:17:00] SPEAKER_02: like a product. So, it's another one where it actually really matters how you choose to price a
[01:17:08] SPEAKER_02: product. Do you really understand where customers are going to drive value? Do you really understand
[01:17:17] SPEAKER_02: where you incur costs? And are you doing a smart job of aligning those things? You know, you've got
[01:17:23] SPEAKER_02: lots of examples of companies grossly underpricing because you're sort of afraid to charge
[01:17:30] SPEAKER_02: for the value that you actually provide. I think there are a lot of examples where people default
[01:17:35] SPEAKER_02: to including a premium strategy without that actually being a strategy. Like a good example at
[01:17:42] SPEAKER_02: shape, we launched strike billing years ago. It had a premium strategy because that's what you do.
[01:17:48] And then we sort of looked at it and we're like, you know, actually integrating strike billing takes
[01:17:52] SPEAKER_02: a little bit of work. So, if you do that, you're probably going to stay. And so we killed that,
[01:17:58] SPEAKER_02: killed the free trial to zero downside. So, you know, that's another one. At Versailles,
[01:18:06] SPEAKER_02: we've been going through that transition where we're a consumption-based business model ultimately.
[01:18:13] SPEAKER_02: But for at the outset, we basically kind of bundled that into what looked like a SaaS-like
[01:18:19] SPEAKER_02: price. And, you know, as we've added a lot more functionality, that wasn't working anymore.
[01:18:25] SPEAKER_02: And so we did an unbundling. And right now, actually, we did a pretty substantial price
[01:18:30] SPEAKER_02: in change in August where we have an enterprise at a proscue. And if you looked at the enterprise
[01:18:38] SPEAKER_02: queue, it's called enterprise for a reason. It's meant to be sold to an enterprise. And actually,
[01:18:45] about half of the folks on enterprise queue were startups, which suggests that their stuff in
[01:18:51] SPEAKER_02: an enterprise queue that a startup really wants. So we kicked a lot of that stuff out of the
[01:18:56] SPEAKER_02: enterprise queue and made it so you could buy it self-service online. And what do you know? People are.
[01:19:01] SPEAKER_02: So, you know, so now that's like really driven a lot of growth in our PLG funnel, which is
[01:19:07] SPEAKER_02: awesome for startups because it's super efficient. They can just buy things. They want that. It's
[01:19:12] SPEAKER_02: awesome for us because you don't have to have a human intermediate that. So, you know, getting all
[01:19:16] SPEAKER_02: of these knobs really tuned is a key to both a great customer experience and optimal revenue outcomes.
[01:19:24] SPEAKER_02: Maybe just one more question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Let's give you a combo
[01:19:28] SPEAKER_00: question. I hear you have a hot take on kind of sales comp. How to comp sales people. That's
[01:19:34] SPEAKER_00: different from other people. And also who to hire when you're hiring folks in sales. You can just
[01:19:39] SPEAKER_00: talk about your takes there. I struggle with sales comp because, you know, it's all about pay for
[01:19:47] SPEAKER_02: performance, which I'm obviously a fan of. But it is, it makes your organization less flexible.
[01:19:58] SPEAKER_02: Because you basically have to decide 12 months in advance. These are things I value. And particularly
[01:20:04] SPEAKER_02: in this moment, that could be different. As a great example of this, when we wrote the sales plans
[01:20:13] SPEAKER_02: for this year at Versailles, the AI cloud did not exist. We were selling our front end cloud and
[01:20:19] SPEAKER_02: we were selling V0 and, you know, introduced the AI cloud halfway through the year. Now, we had
[01:20:25] SPEAKER_02: all sorts of good ways to still incentivize that. But, you know, I think you want to be able to
[01:20:32] SPEAKER_02: be innovative and pivot. And, you know, when you have a well designed sales plan, or, you know,
[01:20:40] SPEAKER_02: a very structured sales plan, that can be challenging. So that's a little bit of my hot take is just
[01:20:49] SPEAKER_02: I'm trying to figure out how do you have the upside of sales of, you know, motivates people. It's
[01:20:55] SPEAKER_02: a quantitative function, which is great. But also the flexibility to change your mind. Because
[01:21:01] SPEAKER_02: I think a lot of companies right now are having a hard time doing annual planning. So, so that's one.
[01:21:07] SPEAKER_02: On profiles, I have always valued what I just sort of diversified portfolio. So I strongly believe
[01:21:16] SPEAKER_02: that sales is a skill. And so you want sales people with actual sales experience in your organization.
[01:21:23] But I think there's value in pairing them with more non-traditional backgrounds, in particular,
[01:21:30] SPEAKER_02: consulting or banking, you know, background. Those folks are really good at, you know, more
[01:21:38] SPEAKER_02: quantitative and analyst, political aspects of sales. So getting into that consultative, you know,
[01:21:43] SPEAKER_02: part, which I think we talked about at the, at the outset. And so I find that when you mix these
[01:21:49] SPEAKER_02: together, this sort of, you know, consultant banker profile realizes, oh, wait a minute, sales
[01:21:56] SPEAKER_02: is a skill and I didn't really have it. And so they go learn from, you know, your, your account
[01:22:03] SPEAKER_02: executives with that background. And then their AEs learn more about, okay, how do I think about a
[01:22:09] SPEAKER_02: P&L? How can I talk to a CFO? You know, how do I present a TCO analysis more effectively? And so just
[01:22:17] SPEAKER_02: creates a much richer learning environment where people are bouncing ideas off each other.
[01:22:22] SPEAKER_02: That is awesome. I love that strategy. Okay. Final question. Just, is there anything else you
[01:22:27] SPEAKER_00: wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting
[01:22:30] SPEAKER_00: lightning round? Oh, man. I feel like we've been very thorough. All right. Thanks, sir.
[01:22:35] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I'm going to, you stumped me on that one. Okay. That's the goal. With that gene, we reached
[01:22:40] SPEAKER_00: our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to make it very quick because I know you got to run.
[01:22:44] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to ask you just two questions. Okay. One is, I'm going to skip to your life motto. Do you
[01:22:50] SPEAKER_00: have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in worker and lay? I do. I actually
[01:22:56] SPEAKER_02: found that I'm known for saying a handful of things that I didn't necessarily realize it, but when
[01:23:01] SPEAKER_02: you leave an organization, people tend to tell you what stuck with them. But there is one that I think
[01:23:07] SPEAKER_02: I'm known for saying, growing up my mom always said to me when the going gets tough, the tough
[01:23:13] SPEAKER_02: get going. And I, you know, in sales, you're always going to have a quarter when you're not on pace.
[01:23:21] SPEAKER_02: And so that's one that I feel like I pull on not infrequently because, you know, there's, in my view,
[01:23:31] SPEAKER_02: there's another version of this, my mom also always says was where there's a will, there's a way.
[01:23:37] So, you know, I think you can always choose to find a path forward even when that's not super clear.
[01:23:45] SPEAKER_00: I love these. Okay. Last question. I read that you were a very competitive diver in college early on.
[01:23:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm just curious if there's something you learned from that experience that you brought with you that
[01:23:56] SPEAKER_00: helps you be as successful as you've become. Well, I mean, first of all, I should say I was, I was
[01:24:01] SPEAKER_02: generally coming in like third place out of three on my team. So,
[01:24:05] SPEAKER_02: I managed to manage to do it in college, but that that was the scent of that career.
[01:24:12] SPEAKER_02: So I do think so diving is a precision sport and it is a repetitive sport. And it is also a sport where
[01:24:19] SPEAKER_02: when you land flat on your back and literally as you are swimming to decide the pool like welts
[01:24:25] SPEAKER_02: are for being on it, you always 100% of the time will be forced to immediately get back on the diving
[01:24:34] SPEAKER_02: board and do that exact same dive again. And so I think that has a lot of stuff that's transferable
[01:24:41] SPEAKER_02: to to work and to sales. So, you know, for me, I just have an obsession with excellence
[01:24:49] and within sales. Sales is about reflectability. How do you drive predictable outcomes?
[01:24:55] SPEAKER_02: You know, how excellent are you at your ability to forecast? And so I think I bring that to bear
[01:25:01] SPEAKER_02: within sales a lot. And then similarly, like you get a lot of nose and sales. And so, you know,
[01:25:08] SPEAKER_02: I another phrase that a sales guru said to me once or in a training was yeses are great,
[01:25:16] SPEAKER_02: nose are great, maybe they'll kill you. And so how do you get really comfortable that nose
[01:25:21] SPEAKER_02: is a great thing. And that just gave you data. And now you can go do something with it.
[01:25:25] SPEAKER_02: This is a really inspiring and empowering way to end the conversation.
