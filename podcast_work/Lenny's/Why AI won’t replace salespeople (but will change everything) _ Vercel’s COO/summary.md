# Podcast Summary: Gene Grocer on Go-to-Market Excellence

## 1. Key Themes

### The Rise of the Go-to-Market Engineer and AI-Driven Sales Automation

AI is fundamentally transforming how sales organizations operate, with the emergence of the "go-to-market engineer" role that brings technical expertise to sales workflows. Gene Grocer describes how Versailles reduced their SDR team from 10 people to 1 by implementing an AI agent that handles inbound lead qualification. "The person who built the lead agent was a single GTM engineer. He spent maybe 25, 30% of his time on this. It was six weeks before we felt confident going from 10 to one" [[00:40:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=40m32s). The agent maintained the same lead-to-opportunity conversion rate while condensing the number of touches needed due to faster response times. What's remarkable is the cost efficiency: "That lead agent, which runs full stack on Versailles, will cost us about a thousand dollars to run for the entire year. So I'm paying well over a million dollars for that from a salary perspective" [[00:41:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=41m38s). This represents a 90%+ reduction in cost while maintaining quality.

### Go-to-Market Must Be Built Like a Product with Obsessive Attention to Customer Experience

Gene emphasizes that the buying journey itself has become a critical differentiator as products commoditize. "When technical differentiation narrows, what are other things that will differentiate you? We buy a lot of things because of how we feel about them. The experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the margin" [[00:48:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=47m54s). She provides a concrete example from Stripe: instead of traditional discovery calls that feel like interrogations, they conducted whiteboarding sessions where prospects drew their payment architecture. "Through that, we would learn a ton about what was in your stack, what we were going to have to compete with. But the customer also learned a lot themselves because in many cases they'd never drawn their architecture diagram. And so they left that meeting with an asset and a sense of like, wow, this is a really collaborative person" [[00:49:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=49m33s).

### Sales Organizations Must Function as R&D Partners, Not Just Revenue Drivers

The best go-to-market teams serve dual functions: driving revenue and conducting continuous customer research that informs product strategy. Gene explains: "The best go-to-market orgs on the planet are equal parts revenue driving and R&D. If I have a 200 person sales team, think of the number of customers that we talk to in a week. If we can do an excellent job of translating all of that feedback into signal and then feeding that into the roadmap, we can be actually an extension of the product management org" [[01:10:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h10m32s). This requires sales people who can distinguish between objections to handle versus genuine market opportunities, and who think like general managers rather than just quota-carriers. Her litmus test: "If you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager" [[01:10:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h9m58s).

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Most Companies Should Build Their Own Sales Agents Rather Than Buy Off-the-Shelf Solutions

While the market is flooded with AI sales tools, Gene argues there's significant alpha in building custom agents internally. "Because this whole space is so nascent, often your own esoteric context, your content, your workflow is really key to unlocking the power of the agent. So I think there's real value in experimenting with your own internal agent development" [[00:42:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=42m6s). She notes that their "deal bot" agent that analyzes sales calls and provides insights took just "two days" to build [[00:41:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=41m10s). The calculus has changed because agents are now easy and cheap to build: building is faster than procurement cycles for multiple point solutions, and custom agents incorporate company-specific knowledge that generic tools cannot.

### Selling to Pain Avoidance Trumps Selling to Upside (80/20 Rule)

Contrary to the typical startup narrative focused on transformation and possibility, Gene shares a critical insight: "80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed to the other one out of five to increase upside, which is a good thing for startup founders to understand. We all love to talk about the art of the possible, everything we're going to enable in the future. But that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder. For everybody else, particularly enterprises, you're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue target next quarter, the risk of having brand damage, etc." [[00:58:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=58m36s). This directly contradicts the common founder instinct to lead with vision and transformation rather than risk mitigation.

### Sales Compensation Plans May Reduce Organizational Agility More Than They Help

Gene expresses skepticism about traditional sales comp structures: "I struggle with sales comp because it's all about pay for performance, which I'm obviously a fan of. But it makes your organization less flexible. Because you basically have to decide 12 months in advance, these are things I value. And particularly in this moment, that could be different" [[01:19:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h19m37s). She uses the example of Versailles launching AI Cloud mid-year when it didn't exist in annual planning: "We had all sorts of good ways to still incentivize that. But I think you want to be able to be innovative and pivot. When you have a well designed sales plan, or a very structured sales plan, that can be challenging" [[01:20:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h20m15s). This challenges the conventional wisdom that complex comp plans drive optimal behavior.

## 3. Companies Identified

**Stripe**
- **Description**: Payment processing and financial infrastructure platform for internet businesses
- **Why mentioned**: Gene was Chief Revenue Officer at Stripe where she built their early sales team and developed many of her go-to-market frameworks. Stripe exemplified product-led growth that successfully transitioned to enterprise sales, becoming a model for consumption-based business models. Known for exceptional product depth in sales teams and innovative approaches like whiteboarding sessions instead of traditional discovery calls.
- **Quote**: "Gmail was this incredible innovation, massive JavaScript application that didn't really exist at the time, and it had this gig of storage. It was a full year before Yahoo Mail caught up. So that was the level of technical differentiation between Gmail and the next best" [[00:47:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=47m1s) (context for why technical differentiation has narrowed, leading to focus on sales experience)

**Versailles (Vercel)**
- **Description**: AI Cloud and front-end cloud platform for building and deploying web applications
- **Why mentioned**: Gene's current company where she serves as COO. Versailles is pioneering the use of AI agents in go-to-market, building internal agents for lead qualification, deal analysis, and sales enablement. They exemplify "eating your own dog food" by building everything on their own platform.
- **Quote**: "Everyone is constantly, we say, Versailles builds Versailles with Versailles. So you're just always looking for ways to, hey, how can we use our product to go do what we need to do?" [[00:46:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=46m15s)

**Gong**
- **Description**: Revenue intelligence platform that records and analyzes sales conversations
- **Why mentioned**: Highlighted as a tool that has become "meaningfully more interesting in the last year" because you can now run AI agents against the conversation transcripts to gain deeper insights into why deals are won or lost.
- **Quote**: "The biggest loss that quarter, according to the account executive, was lost on price. And when you ran the agent over every slack interaction, every email, every gong call, it said, actually, you lost because you never really got in touch with economic buyer" [[00:35:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=35m33s)

**OpenAI**
- **Description**: AI research and deployment company
- **Why mentioned**: Used as an example of how traditional segmentation frameworks can be misleading. Despite having around 3,000 employees (mid-market by typical standards), they're a top 25 traffic site, requiring enterprise-level sales engagement.
- **Quote**: "Opening eye, I forget these days, how many employees it has. Let's say it's 3,000. So that's going to put it in the mid-market at most companies. But they are top 25 traffic site on the internet. So for us, that's going to push them in our enterprise" [[01:04:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h3m57s)

## 5. Operating Insights

### Shadow Your Top Performers to Build Effective AI Agents

When building AI agents for sales workflows, the process starts with deep observation of your best people. "We take a go-to-market engineer and we have them shadow the highest performing individual in that function. You can go and you shadow an SDR and you can see, oh wow, they've got seven tabs open. They're looking up the person on LinkedIn, they're reading about the company, they're doing ChatGPT on this" [[01:19:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h18m52s). This human workflow becomes the blueprint for agent development, ensuring the AI replicates proven excellence rather than average performance.

### Treat Lost Deal Analysis as Product Debugging

Gene's team runs AI agents against all lost opportunities to diagnose real failure patterns versus stated reasons. They track the same KPIs for agents as humans: "We were looking at our lead to opportunity conversion rate. We're looking at the number of touches it takes, the time to convert" [[00:27:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=27m7s). When patterns emerge, they treat them like engineering bugs: "We're going to run sprints, which is like those are just bugs. They're bugs in your go-to-market process. So you should not have them. And by the next week, we're going to add content to our objection handling guide" [[00:38:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=38m28s).

### Hire Diverse Sales Profiles: Mix Traditional Sellers with Consultants/Bankers

Rather than hiring only experienced sales people, Gene advocates for a "diversified portfolio" approach. "I strongly believe that sales is a skill. And so you want sales people with actual sales experience. But I think there's value in pairing them with more non-traditional backgrounds, in particular, consulting or banking background. Those folks are really good at more quantitative and analytical aspects" [[01:21:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h21m6s). This creates a richer learning environment where each group learns from the other.

### Conduct Segmentation Analysis in First 30 Days at Any New Company

Gene's immediate playbook when joining Versailles: "I sat down with the gentleman who leads data science here and said, okay, what drives revenue? What are the things that you can look at about a customer to know this person's likely to pay us $100,000 versus a million?" [[01:06:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h5m57s). This rapid data-driven segmentation analysis reveals where you're winning, where you're not, and informs everything from pricing to product strategy. She emphasizes segmentation should be company-wide, not just go-to-market: "I really think it's a company thing. When you join Versel, I actually deliver in every new hire's first week...our segmentation framework" [[01:08:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=1h8m32s).

### Add Value at Every Touchpoint Regardless of Purchase Decision

A core Stripe principle Gene brought to Versailles: provide insights and value even if the prospect doesn't buy. "Even if customers don't buy, you often find that if you miss them on that buying cycle three or four years later when they're in another buying cycle, they do come back. I was at Stripe for nine years and so I saw the number of customers that we lost and then half a decade later here they are and they bought" [[00:51:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=50m51s). Example: "One of the things we try to do when we reach out is actually give folks insight immediately into how they're performing on an absolute basis, how they're performing relative to peers" [[00:51:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=51m36s).

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The Thousand-Dollar Agent Replacing Million-Dollar Headcount Creates New Build vs. Buy Calculus

While Gene discusses AI agents extensively, she briefly mentions an extraordinary economic insight that deserves more attention: "That lead agent, which runs full stack on Versailles, will cost us about a thousand dollars to run for the entire year" [[00:41:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=41m38s). This isn't just about efficiency—it fundamentally changes the economics of software procurement. If agents can be built in 6 weeks by a single engineer working 25% time and cost $1,000/year to run while replacing $1M+ in headcount, the traditional "build vs. buy" decision framework is obsolete. Companies should be building most workflow automation internally rather than subscribing to dozens of SaaS tools, each with their own point solutions. This has massive implications for the entire B2B software market that Gene only touches on briefly.

### Sales People Spending Only 30-40% of Time with Customers Has Been Unchanged for 20 Years

Gene mentions in passing a statistic that reveals a stunning indictment of sales productivity: "As long as I've been in sales, they release these annual reports that help us all benchmark ourselves relative to one another. And one of the stats is what percent of time do your sellers actually spend in front of customers? For the 20 years I've been in sales, it's always been somewhere around 30 to 40%" [[00:17:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=17m32s). This means for two decades, across all the CRM innovations, sales enablement platforms, and productivity tools, the core metric of sales effectiveness hasn't moved. The implication: previous waves of sales technology failed to solve the real problem. This makes the AI agent opportunity even more significant—Gene believes they can finally get salespeople to "70% of their time interacting with humans" [[00:18:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnWHz8HD74&t=17m51s). This would represent the first meaningful productivity breakthrough in sales in a generation.
