[00:00:00] I recently had a CRO effort for years.
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_02: The deepest respect, reach out to me,
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_02: in an almost panicked email, I need to learn AI, right?
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_02: I'll do anything, I'll intern for you,
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_02: I'll hang out with the meal in his office,
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_02: I'll do whatever.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_02: And I hear this all the time, I need to learn AI.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_02: We hear all, I need to learn AI, Craig.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_02: It supports my job.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_02: It's the simplest advice, tying all this.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_02: Like no, you need to do AI.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_02: Don't learn it.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_02: Buying a subscription to Claude does not count.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_02: It's learning AI.
[00:00:28] The way you're gonna do it is pick an agent
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_02: in an agentic product.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_02: Pick the simplest possible one use case.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_02: And I know it can be scary for some people.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_02: Deploy yourself, buy it, set it up.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_02: If you need a little bit of help connecting it
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_02: to your CRM or your marketing, okay, that's okay.
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_02: You don't have to do the connectors.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_02: Own the deployment.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_02: You don't know what training is.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_02: It's okay, take your time.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_02: Do something simple.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_02: If you deploy an agent yourself, train it,
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_02: QA it, test it.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_02: You will be ahead of 90% of the world.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_02: Hands on.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yourself.

[00:02:25] SPEAKER_02: My name is Craig Swinsor, the founder and CEO of Qualified.
[00:02:28] And I'm joined today in Qualified Studios
[00:02:30] by two very special guests.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_01: Of course, we have Jason Lemkin,
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_01: who's originally the founder and CEO of EchoSign,
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_01: sold to Adobe.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 20 left.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_01: And of course, everybody knows him today
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: as the founder and CEO of Saster
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_01: and also a new CEO of the company.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_01: And I'm going to be a big fan of the company
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_01: of Saster and also Emilio Lerute,
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_01: who is the chief AI officer of Saster,
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_01: which is totally awesome.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: Thank you so much for being with us today.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_01: Thanks so much.
[00:03:01] All right, so what does everybody want to know about
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_01: in today's day and age agents?
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_01: What's going on out there in the real world with agents?
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_01: And Jason, something I read that you post on LinkedIn was,
[00:03:13] people are wondering there's a ton of agent platforms,
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_01: agent solutions, AI this, AI that are on the market right now.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_01: Like, where do I actually start?
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_01: And then I think somebody wrote, you know, what's better?
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_01: Replit or lovable?
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: Which AI SDR platform is the best?
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_01: What AI tools the best for RevOps?
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_01: And you had a killer answer to that.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: Can you share that with us?
[00:03:33] Yeah, it was learning because, you know, we started,
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_02: we started 2025 behind.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_02: We had a lot AI speakers at Saster,
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_02: but we were pretty AI lean here.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_02: We started with one general tool
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_02: and now we've expanded to 20 agents.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_02: And we used qualified and 20 tools that are sort of maybe 12
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_02: of our part of our core architecture,
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_02: which Amelia can talk about.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_02: But it took me a while to know the answer to that question
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_02: or to know the answer between Replit and Lovable,
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: they're related, we can talk about it.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_02: But listen, today the world's going to keep changing.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_02: This stuff is new, right?
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_02: In fact, most of these products, I don't know about Qualify,
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_02: but certainly Replit and Lovable didn't even work before,
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_02: like, Cloud4, okay?
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_02: Didn't even work before the start of 2025.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_02: The Replit, Lovable didn't even exist.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_02: Replit existed for a decade, but the AI just wasn't good enough.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_02: So everything's changed.
[00:04:20] And what I learned is, pick a leading vendor, for sure,
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_02: it does matter, but you training is more important.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_02: Training is more important.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_02: There are very few agentic products,
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_02: at least that have some of a complexity,
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_02: where you wanted to do something like a qualified,
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_02: interact with customers, speak with authority,
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: close deals, right?
[00:04:41] I mean, Amelia was telling me last week,
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_02: qualified set up seven appointments for us, right?
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_02: On its own.
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_02: Now that sounds great, and it is great.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_02: Like, put that as a case study,
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_02: but it wouldn't happen if we put zero minutes of training into it.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_02: So I would rather listen, you know,
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_02: we're on the Qualify podcast by Qualified, we are super fans.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_02: But more important is just in any space,
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_02: support, marketing, sales, coding, just pick a leader,
[00:05:03] and go deep, train it, train it up front for 30 days,
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_02: commit the time, and every day for the next 30 days,
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_02: train it, and then every week.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_02: And it's, first of all, most people don't know how to do it.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_02: And the other thing is, you think, I mean,
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_02: you were at Salesforce, think about how people bought
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_02: enterprise software before AI.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_02: You would buy it from a sales rep,
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: then you might hire an Accenture or a Blue Wolf
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_02: to deploy it over like a year,
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_02: and you would hope and pray at work,
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: like the sales rep told you.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_02: You got it.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_02: No one will tolerate that in AI this year.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_02: No one will tolerate it.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_02: Time to value actually often has to be
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_02: even before you get a contract signed, right?
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_02: And so, and training is this key piece to it.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_02: You've got to train it.
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_02: So that's, I mean, you know, we love Qualified.
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_02: I'm deep on Repplet versus Lovable.
[00:05:50] But in Repplet versus Lovable, they are different.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_02: But most importantly, just knowing the goddamn thing,
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_02: spending a hundred, I'm a, you know,
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_02: I've only a hundred days into Repplet,
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_02: but I'm probably 200 hours expert now to make it great.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_02: And so that's, that is just a sea change in how
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_02: you software, where you used to buying from a people person.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_02: And then scaling it up over time and having humans do all the work,
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_02: put the leads in in the context, those days are behind us.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_02: But remember the old adage, which was like,
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_01: no one got fired for buying IBM.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_01: So, in like the old days, people would wait to see like,
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: who's the emerging leader?
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_01: So they would wait, wait, wait until there was like the IBM,
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_01: and then they would go, but you're just saying,
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_01: you don't have to pick the leader, just pick a leader.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: Like pick somebody and go and go and go.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_01: And, and invest the time in training it.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: And we're also at a weird time where in many categories,
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_02: there is no billion dollar AR company.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there is no, you can say you're a leader.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_02: Maybe qualified's the leader, but it's greatest qualified
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_02: is it's not a billionaire, or yet, I don't think, right?
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_02: I haven't seen that before yet.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_02: Not yet.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_02: So, so we are seeing leaders emerge, but it's early.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_02: But at the same time, what is different from the old days,
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_02: not only are leaders emerging,
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_02: but we've never seen so many folks looking for new vendors.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_02: They're either looking for new vendors because they have AI budget.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_02: They're looking for vendors because they're under pressure from their boss
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_02: to show AI innovation.
[00:07:08] And it's for, in, it's in many cases, it's the only,
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_02: only incremental budget.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_02: No one is putting more budget into their old SaaS software.
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_02: It's all going into AI.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_02: And so everyone's in market, it used to be, I don't know what,
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_02: what you learned as a marketer Salesforce,
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_02: but the traditionally you'd hoped a prospect
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_02: would be in market every five to six years, right, for a big buy, right?
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_02: Because it would take like a year to, to get it going,
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_02: the second year to scale up, the third year to get frustrated,
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_02: and the fourth year to start looking at a new solution.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_02: You got it.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_02: You got it.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_02: You got it.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_02: You got it.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_02: And a fifth year, right?
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_02: Now everything's in market again.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_02: This has never happened in, maybe when the web started, right?
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_02: But everything's in market, it's in total flux.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_02: It means a lot of things for different players,
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_02: but if you're a buyer, just get going.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_02: It's the right parallel, right?
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_01: In 1999, 2000, everything was in flux.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_01: And nobody knew, is people soft going to lead me to the future of HR?
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_01: Is Sebel going to lead me to the future of CRM?
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_01: And it's kind of like that same thing right now.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_01: Who's going to lead me to the future of, in our case,
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_01: go to market, but in all these other markets.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: But even there, as cloud got bigger,
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_02: the only time, I think at our lifetimes,
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_02: we saw intense pressure to go to the cloud was 2020.
[00:08:20] Okay, and that was an exogenous situation where people,
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_02: I literally saw it investments I made.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_02: We saw it in these signatures, but I saw it in companies
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_02: I invested in like, talk tests for cloud context center.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_02: Like, you could wait 20 years to decide if you really wanted
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_02: to go to the cloud.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_02: And then in March 2020, these businesses went 10x.
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_02: Like, because I have no choice, right?
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_02: But that was the only time when people felt like they had
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_02: to go to the cloud instantly.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_02: But now, yes, it is a small subset of tech and innovation.
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_02: But there's so much money and I need to go AI today.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_02: Right. Right?
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_02: And you've got to be part of that if you want to win.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_01: For most companies, it's coming tops down from their board.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_01: It's like a board to the CEO to everybody else move, move, move.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_01: And so, of course, not toward the incremental budget is coming from.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_01: You guys are a unique company because of who you are and what you do.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_01: But you said, at the beginning of this year,
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_01: I had zero agents.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_01: And now I've got 20 agents that are in production doing various things.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_01: And Amelia, you're the chief AI officer of the company.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_01: What have you got and kind of how have you done it?
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_01: And what have you learned?
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we started with a platform for advice, right?
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_00: So, Saster that Jason started was for giving founders advice,
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_00: giving them, you know, how to hire my next VP of sales.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: What should their comp plan be?
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: How should I hire the next CRO?
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_00: When to hire a CRO?
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_00: Don't hire a marketer who's only going to give you blue pens.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_00: Like, fate now famously classic advice, right?
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_00: Per Saster.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_00: And so, we started the year with no agents.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: And we're like, okay, what's the number one problem we have is like outside of Saster annual
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: or like Saster London, all these events we do, people always want to ask Jason a question, right?
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: Like, think about to him, even here at Dreamforce, people come out to him and ask him a question.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: And you can't really scale that.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_00: And so, we started with a platform that's called Delphi and it's a clone of Jason.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: So, it is all of your advice, your social media, everything on Saster for the last 12, 13 years in the clone.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_00: And so...
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_00: By the way, it's incredible for the founders and entrepreneurs that are out there.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_01: It is incredible.
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_01: Go to Saster.com and do the bottom right hand corner.
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we were blown away at first how good it was.
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_02: With training.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_02: With training.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_02: Because it ingested all the Saster, which is, I mean, now I'm like, oh, a lot of the tools do that.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_00: But like at the beginning of the year, I was like, that's impressive.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_00: Like, it's a lot of, it's like what, 20 million words of content, a thousand YouTube's, all the tweets, all the LinkedIn's.
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_02: It did break the ingestion engine.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_02: But once it did, it was pretty good ones, we tried to do it.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm like, okay, that's pretty magical.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: So you started, you call that Jason AI?
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_01: That's the Jason AI.
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so you started with the Jason AI and then where did you go from there?
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_01: So that was before our big event this year, which was in May.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: And so in the run-up to that, famously, we both were like, okay, this is pretty cool.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_00: And people are starting to use it more often.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: They like it for advice, again, classic like.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_00: But now it's like, how do I hire VP of sales?
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_00: They have the conversation with the AI.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: And the AI can have follow-up conversations.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_00: So now we'll see people use it as like a code pilot of, oh, hey, I'm thinking about hiring this.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_00: Person for my VP of sales.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_00: What do you think of their resume or I asked them this in real and they asked me for this comp.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_00: Should I push back on that?
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_00: Like, what would what would real Jason do?
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: And so that piece was cool and it's really good at that.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: And it still is to your point.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_00: But where I kind of saw some failings that we both saw, I was like, it's not as good at answering our actual like saster needs of.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_00: Okay, we have this event coming up.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: That's a specific use case of basically trying to clone Jason.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: Jason.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_01: But the interesting part, for sure, we it's a horizontal, you know, the talked or dream force say about horizontal versus vertical agents, right?
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_02: Delphi is as horizontal as it gets.
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_02: There's almost no workflow.
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_02: There's maybe a couple little triggers.
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_02: They can't do things that qualified can, but it can do it a little bit of everything.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_02: And so it was supposed to just be digital Jason.
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_02: And what was interesting is, and this is an issue with a lot of agents, people would start using it for support.
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_02: Hey, I got a booth at Saster Angel.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_02: Can I have popcorn?
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_02: And we didn't expect that.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_02: And this isn't an issue so many while with the agents, and it will keep if it's any, if it's good, if it's bad, you'll have no ROI.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_02: If it's good, people will start using it.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_02: We hear this again.
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_02: I'm sure you hear it all the time.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_02: People will use it for things you do not envision.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_02: If they trust it.
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_02: You got it.
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_02: So instantly people wanted it for for issues with attending our events and for sponsors.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_02: And we're like, oh, what then a start to hallucinate.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_02: It was pretty good on my content.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_02: And so we had a magical moment, which is we upload in our perspectives.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_02: And it only took a certain amount of context and training, but then it started to get good.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_02: So then it was pretty good at doing maybe 20% of what qualified good.
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_02: But here's the thing.
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_02: And the people get this wrong.
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_02: 20% is a lot better than zero.
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_02: Like if we never used qualified and only used this general agent, we wouldn't have the seven point because it can't set meetings.
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_02: But even 20% is better than zero if it's good.
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_02: Sure.
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_02: Just the fact that instead of it being dope, like we used to use inner common, it would be a weak response time.
[00:13:01] Okay.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_02: So we switched to our agent and it could instantly tell you about 90% right.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_02: You're your customer question.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_02: And so sometimes 20% is enough.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_02: That's as far as we got.
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_02: And then we had time after annual.
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_02: We're like, okay, let's do better.
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_02: Let's go from horizontal to vertical as a phase two.
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_02: And I don't think that's a bad approach for some folks.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_02: Like get one thing working that's horizontal gets confident and then go.
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_02: Now let's do SGR, BDR, marketing dedicated.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_02: So we went from horizontal to, you know, 12 verticalized agents in the set.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_02: But we do in that process, it set us up for for where we are now, like successfully with multiple agents, because I think otherwise if it failed or if we expected too much out of it, I don't know.
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_00: We probably would have stayed on the one or something or dumped it, right.
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_00: So I think that's where we're like, okay, post annual and we have more time.
[00:13:50] I started to look for vendors like a qualified and artisan and a Delphi that we could bring on.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_00: That would make sense for us, right.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: So Sassar has big scale, but internally, very small.
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_00: So it's okay.
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_00: The number one thing that was driving me crazy was two full, like two things were driving me crazy.
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: The first being that when you came to the website to become a sponsor or buy a ticket is very antiquated.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: Like fill out this contact form, which I hate it.
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_00: I was like, not only is this the worst of failure to contact for.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: It's very dated and also half the time I ran Robin at towards Hills team, they don't follow up.
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:14:23] So that at least half the time.
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: I at least half the time.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: So like, I'm like half the time.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: I know if I'm giving it to like one of the better reps, it's going to get followed up with instantly.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_00: But I give it to the other rep because it's their day on round Robin.
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, they're either getting a response half the time or not at all.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_00: So if you blown all that up and you just do it all with agents now.
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_01: And who manages the agents right now?
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_00: I do.
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_00: This is why we changed my title.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_00: It's an issue.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_00: It's an issue, right.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_02: Just briefly, like we can talk about that.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_02: The learning for folks that watch.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_02: I didn't know this at the time.
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_02: Stairstep it.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_02: I learned this for our agents and I learned it on rap wit.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_02: So the fact that we went from Delphi, a horizontal agent, which basically can self-injust your
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_02: content with no training.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_02: Like you do need to enter it, but it's the least amount of training of the tools in our
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_02: stack.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_02: Start easy, start broad, get a few, get a win under your belt.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_02: Even if you started with say qualified, I might not totally qualified.
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_02: Start for the simplest use case.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_02: Because if you fail with your first agentic thing, you not only will it, is it frustrating,
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_02: you won't know.
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_02: You just won't know because we had the early win that was better than expected.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_02: Like our general digital Jason could do some sales.
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_02: I could do some qualification.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_02: And it would start to say, you know what, Craig, you're not big enough for Cesar Annual
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_02: this year.
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_02: Don't come.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_02: That was like great for us.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_02: Like it would do it on its own.
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_02: And so we gained confidence.
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_02: And then I know we used different nomically from you, but going from that to SDR to BDR.
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_02: So going from outbound to inbound.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_02: For us, different people are different.
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_02: For us, outbound was easier than inbound.
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_02: We didn't, it was less risky to send a better email than a mediocre human than to trust
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_02: an agent with a, with, with, with the precious lead.
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_02: You got it.
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_02: Tell right?
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:16:01] So if you want to go to the most complex part, at least somehow learn first, because it's
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_02: just too risky.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_02: But if you can stair step this stuff, you will build confidence by your second third
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_02: agent or deployment.
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_02: And we didn't intend, but that's what we ended up doing.
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_02: And that's how even as we're successful, we stair step.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_02: I think every company is probably a little bit different.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_01: But like the stair step, we were talking about, you got to,
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: you got to crawl walk run.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_01: Everybody like sees the prize of like, I'm going to be sprinting and you're like,
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_01: whoa, you know, where do I start?
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_01: And you got to get the quick win.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: You got to build the confidence internally.
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_01: You got to kind of learn the tool.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_01: You got to invest the time.
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_01: And like, you have to invest the time.
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_01: But it doesn't take that long.
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_01: You guys had zero agents at the beginning of this year.
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_01: And now you have 20.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_01: So it's not like we're talking about crawl walk run in three years.
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_01: We're talking about in months, right?
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_02: But I don't want to hear Amelia starts.
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_02: I would say there's different ways you could count.
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_02: Because I think there's there's agents that are simplistic and there's rich agents
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_02: and there's agents that take more of your time than others.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_02: For sure.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_02: But we think of us as maybe having 12 prime agents.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_02: I don't, without another human, this is about the most we can do.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_02: I don't, we, it was fun.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_02: Now like the bar is so high for us to add a 13th core tool.
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_02: It better, we will.
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_02: There's some stuff that is not automated, but it is, you know, the,
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_02: because you wake up, Amelia wakes up in the morning.
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_02: It used to be me when I trained her, I mean, it's an hour of work in the morning,
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_02: dealing with the outputs and you're thinking about it all day.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_02: You're thinking about it a couple of times.
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_02: I can't remember what show was on, but you said you put in an hour in a day,
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_01: and you'll reap the rewards for doing that.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_01: We'll never go back.
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to go.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_00: No, for sure.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_00: Like, well, I do think stair stepping was very important, like to both of your,
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_00: both of your points there.
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_00: But I think part of it too is like when I spend that hour in the morning,
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: it's an hour you spend with people, like, okay, when we at, we had human SDRs and human
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_00: BDRs that again would maybe half the time follow up with an ML lead or half the time,
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_00: maybe a quarter of the time set an outbound, right?
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_00: Like, maybe even worse.
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: Like, this is an hour I would spend with those people either doing one on ones or going
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_00: through accounts or just, you know, going through accounts they should be following
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_00: up with or again, like, hey, here's a lead.
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_00: Here's what they did with Saster, like giving them a context of what people have done
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_00: with Saster.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: So instead of that, we're going to that.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_00: Now I just spent an hour with the agent.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, okay, the agent I wake up in the morning, I'm like, okay, the qualified agent
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_00: has booked already, you know, whatever, a couple of meetings with David.
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_00: I can see the conversation.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: I can give him any context.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_00: I can be like, hey, David, you know, just for, because we use momentum too, I'll be like,
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_00: okay, read the pre read and momentum.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: So you can see what they did with us before.
[00:18:33] Make sure you just open it off so it'll move the stage for you and then like, done.
[00:18:37] And then I'll check on, like, I literally go agent to agent, like I'll go qualified,
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_00: I'll go artisan, I'll go Delphi.
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_00: Now I go agent force, like I just go through all of our agents and I just check on them
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_00: for that hour.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_00: But let me get your perspective on this.
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_01: You said that same hour you used to spend with people with people, right?
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_01: And inevitably some of those people would move on from your organization or you'd find
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_01: that maybe they weren't the best and like, you'd part ways in some way, but that hour
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_01: you spend with the agent.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_01: Is so much more productive.
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_00: Over time, have you found that?
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's so much more productive.
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_00: I would say in the early days for any platform you get, that's a gen tick, right?
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_00: Most of your time it's going to be more than an hour and it's going to be sending it up.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: Like all these at the forefront required a lot more set up time, right?
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_00: Like, it just does because either you have to fix your data or it needs to talk to something
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: else, it needs to talk to something else or like us.
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: I was like, you know, I thought we had okay data quality in Salesforce and I was like,
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_00: no, it's terrible.
[00:19:31] But it exposes that.
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_01: It exposes that, right?
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_00: Or like famously, when we hooked up momentum, which is like a bit of a recorder and a
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_00: complementary go-to-market tool to qualified, we had somebody leave our team that day because
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_00: what it does is it will slack you a summary.
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_00: It does a lot of stuff, but it'll slack you the summary after each sales call and it'll
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: also slack me anytime like a new opportunity is opened or meetings, but you're like whatever.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_00: And this wrap was like, I have no activity.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_00: So like it literally exposes that like what are you going to do?
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_00: You have to quit that day.
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_00: You like you can't hide.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: You're going to be found out instantly.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_00: So yeah, instead of my hour now being with those people, I thought, I'm going to be
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_00: spent an hour with all of our agents in the morning.
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_00: Again, it used to be set up now.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_00: I check on all of them.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_00: I see if there's any follow ups we need to do.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_00: And then I do more things now, right?
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_00: Like, it used to be okay.
[00:20:21] I'm going to set up all the platforms to do their core things.
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to set up inbound, outbound, support, ticket information, event support, like
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_00: whatever we need.
[00:20:29] SPEAKER_00: We have that all set up now with our agents.
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_00: Then I was like, oh, now I can do email.
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_00: Like I can de-anonimize some of our website traffic.
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_00: I can send them a follow-up campaign if they didn't actually buy a ticket.
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_00: Maybe it doesn't matter if they were on the website or not.
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_00: Like, now we have all these different use cases that I've started to compound itself.
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_00: Because I'm like, now I can just do a lot more in that one hour with like my five core
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: agents than talking to two humans 30 minutes each.
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_00: And more.
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_02: But it is more like this is as a society we're going to figure it out.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_02: It is because you can do more work.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_02: It is a higher cognitive level.
[00:21:01] SPEAKER_02: You have to think more.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_02: You don't spend time arguing with people.
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_02: As I say with Amelia, the agents don't cry.
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_02: And that is exhausting, right?
[00:21:11] SPEAKER_02: But it's exhausting in a different way, right?
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_02: You know if someone's going to cry meeting with you, Craig, you just have to sit there
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_02: for an hour.
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_02: But you don't have to think, you don't have to use all your brain cells for an hour to
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_02: you with your agents.
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_02: That's the list that you have.
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_02: It's so many brain cells.
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_02: And that's what that's.
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_02: And so I just think that, you know, even if you think about coding, you know, everyone,
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_02: I just wrote this up.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_02: Everyone brags at 50% of our code of qualifuds written by cursor or, but it doesn't
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_02: mean your engineers only work three hours a day.
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_02: Does it?
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_02: No, not at all.
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_02: And so I haven't seen a lot of engineers complain about, but I do think for the best
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_02: engineers, there's more cognitive load.
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_02: Because you can do more.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_02: It's not as simple as doing more releases.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_02: That's more you have to think.
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_02: You know, engineering is very creative.
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_02: And so the more the road stuff that's done, it's fun, but it's exhausting.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_02: You know, you might have to think about how to make that agent work better.
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_02: Eight hours a day instead of three hours a day.
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_02: It's much better, but it's, but I don't know that everyone can make the jump.
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:22:06] What do people start?
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_01: You did a post that was about the layup roles.
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_01: And can you define like, what are these layup roles?
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_01: If somebody's like, you have now almost a year's worth of experience.
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:22:18] SPEAKER_01: And getting agents into production, you've seen what works.
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_01: You've seen what doesn't work.
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_01: What are these layup roles?
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_01: Where should people start?
[00:22:26] I think the layup, maybe it's Captain Obvious, the layup are the things where there is
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_02: a tool that exists that is trustworthy, where it's just not getting done in your work.
[00:22:37] Right.
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_02: And there are a lot of reasons that my neck is done in your org.
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_02: It might be an area that's tough to hire in.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_02: You might be in a geography that's tough to hire in.
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_02: It might just be your DNA, right?
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_02: There are companies that are very sales-centric organizations.
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_02: There's companies that are very product-centric.
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_02: If you like hate sales people and you like product, maybe you should start with agentic sales,
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_02: right?
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_02: If you love sales and that's your superpower, right, maybe get an AI to help you as an
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_02: SE, right?
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_02: Or to help you to support you as sales as a superpower.
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_02: So don't try to replace the stuff that's sort of working.
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_02: Look at where there's literally no one doing the work, right?
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_02: And so there's a lot of them, but at a basic level, the two areas that have to took off
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_02: the most quickly were support and programming engineering, right?
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_02: A lot of us have terrible support.
[00:23:22] Terrible support.
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_02: So that's still the easiest layup of all.
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_02: Go try your own support yourself as a founder, executive.
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_02: I bet nine times ten you're going to cry.
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_02: How bad your support is.
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_02: Not all of you, but the people are often in tears when they do it.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_02: 100%.
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_02: I'd yeah.
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_02: A recent.
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_02: How was I treated this way?
[00:23:41] Pretend quality.
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_02: You just had a huge issue with qualified.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_02: I know qualified never goes down and does any problems, but go to go to your own.
[00:23:47] SPEAKER_02: Go to go to say, listen, I have a P1 issue.
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_02: This is broken.
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_02: And it'll say we get back to you in a week or I don't understand the problem, right?
[00:23:55] SPEAKER_02: Or you know, you just just want to start there, right?
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_02: And that's where we've seen the adoption of agents like customer support, even internal
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_01: IT help desk coding.
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_01: And then you get like go to market in sales and marketing.
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_01: But I would say for us like so we our order is ours.
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_02: So the generalist was easy outbound.
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_02: We couldn't get our SDRs to do outbound.
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_02: So that was the lowest hanging fruit.
[00:24:19] SPEAKER_02: But our qualification was terrible.
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_02: That process of going to a website, clicking on something and hoping over the next week
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_02: a human would get back to you.
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_02: That was like when we deployed qualified, didn't have to be that good.
[00:24:32] Yeah.
[00:24:33] Now listen, it's great.
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_02: But it's not like we had a great team of qualified, of 10 people where we had an SLA or every
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_02: every product, if every prospect got back to in five minutes with a hundred percent
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_02: time bias by a product expert, we might have waited a year, right?
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_02: But that was, it wasn't, it was close to broken, but none of our SDRs being willing to
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_02: send an email was more broken.
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_02: Well, of course, I mean, you guys are a unique company, but I think every single go-to-market
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_01: organization has some flavor of what you just said, which is you got high turnover of
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_01: the people.
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_01: You got people that are three months on the job.
[00:25:05] SPEAKER_01: How could they know your products?
[00:25:07] SPEAKER_01: How could they know your competitors?
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_01: How could they know your market?
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_01: How could they know all this stuff?
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_01: And then they'll only work a certain number of hours a day and some don't like the job
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_01: and they don't put in the effort.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_01: And like everybody has some flavor of this with these types of roles.
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: And that's when you look at AI and you're like, oh my gosh, like I could just do so much
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_01: better.
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_01: So, I think the failure that I see, especially CMOs make, is they're looking for a hero
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_02: purchase.
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_02: They want to go to their boss to the CEO or whoever and say, I bought AI.
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think everybody right now wants that hero purchase.
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_01: And listen, I'm not saying you shouldn't save your job, but I guarantee it's probably going
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_02: to fail because that hero purchase is probably going to be aligned with something you're
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_02: decent at.
[00:25:47] The bar is so high and you're not going to know how to train it because it's your first
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_02: agent.
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_02: So you're looking for, you're solving medium-high hanging fruit because it's already
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_02: working and you've never done it before and you don't know how to train it on board
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_02: it.
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_02: Like I know you're going to get that there are a bunch of apps we know that have done
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_02: really well is the hero apps and maybe buy it's just a little bit of money, but I would
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_02: not deploy it first.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_02: I'll leave it on the shelf and deploy something where your org is just isn't doing it.
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_02: It's not happening, right?
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_02: And then you get a win, right?
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_02: But I just, you know, some of these hair apps that we just watched them fail again and
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_02: again.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_02: I hadn't fully reflected into one of the reasons is that it's not necessarily the most broken
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_02: problem in their org, right?
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_02: Just making, if AI is only going to make something 20% better, maybe 2025 is not the year.
[00:26:33] Maybe that's a 2026 project.
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_02: So this is about picking, everybody I think has started.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_01: I think like we're sitting here in the fall of 2025.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: Very few people are like, I haven't even thought about this.
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_01: There's probably been some experimentation like there has in your organization throughout
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_01: the course of the year.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_01: But as all of this is coming together, you said something on a recent interview that was
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_01: about, you know, what's happening to SAS?
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_01: That's what people are kind of wondering.
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_01: Is SAS dead is like kind of the mega theme of the moment right now.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_01: And how are AI agents changing all that?
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_01: But you've got a long history, Jason, in the SAS industry.
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_01: In fact, you created a company called SASTER.
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_01: So you run a massive conference called SASTER.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_01: It's true.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_01: You know, what do you see going on in the world of SAS and how is that transforming in the
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_01: age of AI?
[00:27:19] Well, look, some of this is marketing in hysteria.
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_02: Right, SAS is dead.
[00:27:25] But there's a lot of truth in it.
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_02: Let's step back.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_02: I mean, two things.
[00:27:32] One, AI is putting more CIO budget and probably more S&B budget into business software than
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_02: ever before.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_02: In its own way, it's like the title wave of 2020, because we needed all of a sudden
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_02: budgets went up because everyone was at home, right?
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_02: So budgets for e-signatures, for context.
[00:27:49] SPEAKER_02: There was no limits, right?
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_02: We're not like that today.
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_02: But a traditional, here's a stressor.
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_02: Traditional budgets are frozen.
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_02: In fact, CIOs are still going around the table at the end of the year and telling every
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_02: functional head to cut some SAS apps, right?
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_02: We had CAS who just took over a CEO of Open Door.
[00:28:05] SPEAKER_02: He told them they had to get rid of 20 or 30% of their SAS apps or they're gone the
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_02: first week.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_02: That still seems to be a layup.
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_02: Like, we want you to cut the number of apps.
[00:28:14] SPEAKER_02: We have app below.
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_02: And worse, half of our incremental budgets go into price increases.
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_02: Salesforce raises prices 8%.
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_02: This year, 6%.
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_02: That compounds.
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_02: So if I'm growing my IT budget 6%, and my core vendors are all raising prices 78%.
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_02: How much room is there for another business process workflow app?
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_02: Like, I'm sorry, the cap of the vendor, cutting the vendors and all the incremental
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_02: budget going to price increases is tough.
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_02: That's also why even the leaders are struggling with upsell, right?
[00:28:43] If all that budget went into my price increase, it sells worse.
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_02: It's probably harder to buy another cloud, isn't it, at the margin, right?
[00:28:51] But there's so much AI budget.
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_02: And when you add it together, business software is growing faster than it has ever before.
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_02: But if you don't tap into that AI budget, it's tough.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_02: There just isn't budget.
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_02: It's just not there.
[00:29:04] SPEAKER_02: So if you're selling the way you sold in 2021, this is one of 50 reasons it's dead.
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_02: There's not the budget's harder.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_02: It's all going to exist investors.
[00:29:12] SPEAKER_02: Inflation and price increases are doing all.
[00:29:14] SPEAKER_02: And all the energy is in AI for solutions.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_02: So if that's you, it feels dead.
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_02: It feels like these are all the people on LinkedIn that playbook doesn't work.
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_02: Outbound's dead.
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_02: Nothing works.
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_02: Events don't work.
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_02: Tell it to anyone that's on fire.
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_02: It all works, meaning with your customers' works.
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_02: Outbound works if anyone wants to buy your product, right?
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_02: You said something like class success is, in fact, dead or it's geriatric or something
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_01: like that.
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_01: Geriatric.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_01: But be software right now is exploding.
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_01: And that's something that is...
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_01: I think maybe it's kind of obvious if you live here in Silicon Valley, but when you
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_01: look at the software industry from the outside in, it's like a tale to cities.
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_01: Tale of tenies.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_02: But the simple question I ask founders who are struggling, right, is if you haven't
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_02: figured it out yet, what can you do in...
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_02: You already have a thousand customers, 5,000, 10,000.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_02: What can you do in AI that couldn't be done before that's magical.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_02: That's 10 times better.
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_02: Let's take a pause and figure this out in your space.
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_02: 10 times better.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but usually there is an idea.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_02: Usually there's an idea, right?
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_02: I mean, even we're here at Dreamforce.
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_02: If Agent Force were fully deployed at Mark's vision, like if everyone was live with Agent
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_02: Force, everyone had all this automated across a million workflows, it would be magical,
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_02: wouldn't it?
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_02: It would be.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we magical.
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_02: So you maybe Mark's not...
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it's so much business process change, right?
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_02: I mean, you work there, right?
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_02: But at least that's the answer, I think.
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_02: I think it's the right answer.
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_02: But if you're running a company, if you don't have that answer today, you get an F.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_02: So let's talk...
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_01: We're here at Dreamforce.
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_01: About the Agentic Enterprise, which is kind of the vision that Salesforce is talking
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_01: about at this conference.
[00:30:42] How long does a company have, do you think, to get on board the train before they just
[00:30:48] SPEAKER_01: miss the train?
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_01: How fast do people need to be?
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: They need to be right now.
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_01: That's the Halloween, which is like...
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_00: For a start up, I said Halloween.
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_02: Halloween is the very latest.
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_02: Halloween is for a start, for a start up.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because you're going to get out competed if you're a start up, right?
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_02: Okay, so you're already behind.
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_01: Maybe a few weeks.
[00:31:01] Maybe a few weeks, yeah.
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, two weeks.
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_02: Or you're already behind.
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_01: I tell you, maybe it's me, every VC I know, every investor I know, where the start up
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_02: hasn't made the jump yet, they've given up.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_02: Now they've lost hope.
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_02: Okay, tell me more about it.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_02: They've all lost hope.
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_02: Because it's not...
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_02: I mean, you could make...
[00:31:16] SPEAKER_02: When Chatsheapity came out, we could all make fun of it, right?
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I honestly didn't get it at first.
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_02: There were so many hallucinations, right?
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_02: But if you didn't pay attention to how everything changed, at least at the start of 2025 and
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_02: didn't have a plan, there's no excuse.
[00:31:30] SPEAKER_02: Everything's great now.
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_02: In fact, even mediocre software just got better when you put the fours in, right?
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_02: Cloud four, you take the same...
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_02: I don't know how qualified change, but I bet you it's a five times better product just
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_02: changing the LLM.
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_02: I tell this story about qualified, I don't know if it's true, but I know it's true.
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, the reason they're having to go up, because they've been doing this for a while.
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_02: They have a great team, but you stick a better LLM.
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_02: And it was...
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_02: I mean, Repplet took 10 years to get to a million, right?
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_02: They add...
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_02: They add Cloud four, now they're almost 200 million in one year, but it's the same IDE,
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_02: right?
[00:32:00] SPEAKER_02: It's the same software, right?
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_02: The point is everyone that sees other companies know, okay, we'll give you 2023, if you didn't
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_02: figure it out, totally cool.
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_02: We get it, right?
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_02: 2024, you could be a critic.
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_02: You might start losing deals to the Ollie's Hadei companies, but at least you could have
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_02: a principled position.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_02: The stuff wasn't going to work.
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_02: There's no excuse in 2025.
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_02: No excuse.
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_02: So, Halloween, you've had 10 months.
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_02: You don't have anything in production that is disruptive, but you're not working at an
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_02: acceptable speed to the age of AI.
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_02: You have already lost.
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_02: You may not be over, but you've got to get rid of most of your team at a minimum and
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_02: start over.
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_02: You have to reboot your time.
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_02: If you're not in market with a disruptive AI agent as a startup on Halloween, you need
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_02: a brand new team, a brand new team.
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_02: Maybe even 80% of them got to go.
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_02: And you give them a nice Thanksgiving bonus in a turkey and tell them they got to go, because
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_02: you've had 10 months.
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_02: How about on the flip side, not for the technology vendors, but for businesses out there.
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_01: In our case, marketing sales organizations that are out there, even at 1000 plus person
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_01: companies, Fortune 500 enterprises, how fast do they need to be adopting relative to what
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_01: you see going on in the technology ecosystem?
[00:33:12] SPEAKER_01: Well, I don't know what I mean.
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_02: Honestly, I know this annoying thing to say, but it really does vary.
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_02: If literally your business is fine.
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_02: If your business has not changed since a year ago, if your growth is as good as better
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_02: as it was 12 months ago, you're in a traditional industry.
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_02: Things working, you can be a late adopter.
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_02: Not everyone has to, there's a lot of pressure to be an early adopter from a lot of companies.
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_02: And there's a lot of reasons there's that pressure.
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_02: But if it's not external, if it doesn't exist, be a late adopter.
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_02: You know, qualified's going to be a better tool in a year.
[00:33:45] SPEAKER_02: It's a much better tool in a year ago, you just said, right?
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_02: It's a much better tool, right?
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_02: I know you want them today.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_02: But here's the thing about like, I know Repplet.
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_02: So I can't tell you in a hundred days how much better Repplet is than I started.
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_02: It's not a little bit better.
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_02: It's typically better.
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_02: So there is, there are early adopter advantages in AI.
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_02: But if you can wait as a customer, as a deployer, there are late adopter advantages too, right?
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_02: Maybe if qualified can't do what I want to do in a year, rather than classic SaaS by
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_02: any way, brute force it, I'm not dropping out of your pipeline.
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_02: I'm not buying another vendor, but kitten me up in the summer.
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_02: Because we used to, we've all been in the old SaaS days when a customer would come in
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_02: and say, I need this and you would promise it in the contract and it didn't exist.
[00:34:27] SPEAKER_02: I think those days are dying in AI.
[00:34:29] SPEAKER_02: Don't promise me it'll be here in a year like we used to do to close a bit.
[00:34:33] Now with AI, we just show me the agent that it works and if it's not ready, I don't blame
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_02: you.
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_02: I get it early.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_02: Come back to me when it works.
[00:34:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_02: So for example, we're doing on your website, we're doing Amelia AI and we're turning
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_01: you into your face, right?
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_01: And you're super excited about that and we're going to have you in our studio and film
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_01: a hole behind the scenes episode on it.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_01: And you know, some people are going, ah, you know, it's not quite right and the voice
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_01: interrupt detection is not everyone is very quick to point out all the little flaws.
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_01: And like my message back to them is just like, just wait nine months.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_01: And all those things that you are nitpicking about right now, those are going to be gone.
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_01: But even at that point, right?
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_00: It's like, okay, talking to the Jason out AI or now the Amelia AI more so like on our
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_00: event sites for like support or sales tickets, sponsorships, whatever it is, like half
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_00: the time right now or next events in London.
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_00: So half the time I wake up and I spend this hour with our agents, mostly conversations
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_00: for London have already happened because when we wake up in Pacific time, it's their afternoon,
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_00: it's their evening.
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_00: And at first, I was nervous.
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_00: I was like, okay, we're going to deploy the qualify.
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_00: But like, what if it does answer things wrong and I'm not there to like catch it because
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_00: I'm not awake?
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_00: And so I got over that with, you know, training and help from your team and we got it.
[00:35:46] SPEAKER_00: I was like, okay, never mind.
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_00: It's pretty good.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_00: It's good.
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_00: Like it knows enough and it knows when to escalate, which is nice of like, okay, it'll say,
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: like, oh, it's better than when you started with the ball.
[00:35:53] SPEAKER_02: It's better than when I started.
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for sure.
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_00: So like that part has been really nice.
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_00: I've gotten a lot of comfortability around it.
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_00: But I am excited to add the voice and video portion to it because I'm like, it could,
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_00: now I trust it to do more overnight, right?
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_00: Like, I trust it fully now on chat to like answer people's questions.
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_00: It's, it's a seller.
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_00: Like literally, it's been selling tickets to our events.
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_00: Like I can, it's done.
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_00: I was just looking out this morning.
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_00: It's probably done a hundred tickets to our London event.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_00: I don't know how long we've been on call via in six weeks.
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_00: Definitely helps for at least eight weeks.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:36:25] SPEAKER_00: A hundred out of like 2000 is not nothing.
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_00: Like that's a pretty good percentage of people.
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_00: Pretty awesome.
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_00: Pretty awesome.
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_00: And so now I'm like, oh, let it do more.
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_00: Like let it, you know, have let's do the voice and video.
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_00: Like let it can sell tickets.
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_00: But it can also start to be a copilot.
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_00: Like the Amelia AI, I'm actually the Jason AI can turn into our agent like event copilot
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_00: of, oh, hey, I saw you're coming to London.
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_00: You already bought the ticket because I got you to buy the ticket as the agent.
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_00: But now let me tell you about like the networking because you didn't sign in for like your networking
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_00: yet or you haven't booked your sessions yet.
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_00: Like let me tell you what sessions to book like, well, let me just talk to you because like
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_00: real Amelia is asleep, but Amelia AI is awake and can answer your questions.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_00: Like half the time I see how qualified it is current like take a hold or response.
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_00: Asking it questions like we used to get for annual of like, hey, I forgot it was the
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: first or hey, I forgot the link for the hotel block or remind me what hotel.
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_00: The venue is and it will just answer all these things again overnight while I'm sleeping,
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_00: which is kind of crazy and cool because that's what it should do, right?
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_00: Like it should empower you to talk to your customers whenever 24 seven because the AI
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_00: doesn't sleep, but real Amelia has to and then let it do more.
[00:37:33] SPEAKER_00: Like I just have all these edge cases now of like how I want to use it because we've
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_00: built trust in our agent and now also people people will walk up to me and they'll be like,
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_00: you're that Amelia AI.
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, yeah, I'm I'm Amelia's.
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_00: That's my that's my AI that you talk to.
[00:37:51] And so that's why I know Blake has had the same experience because she's your
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_00: a Piper.
[00:37:56] But that and that's a little funky because I'm like, okay, now when we get to London,
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_00: people are going to be like, oh, I have this whole conversation with you.
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_00: And I'll have to either say it was my AI or fess up.
[00:38:07] It happens on outbound to like I get the question all the time on outbound like, hey, is
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_00: this really Amelia or is this an agent of Amelia?
[00:38:15] SPEAKER_00: And it's but it's always after a purchase.
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_00: So I'm like, it already doesn't matter.
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_00: Like it doesn't matter if it was real me or AI me or one of my agents because you got
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_00: the value.
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_00: And people are getting so comfortable with this.
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_00: You guys are so awesome for stopping by our studio today.
[00:38:31] Just one final question.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_01: Do you have any words of advice for the listeners of this podcast or primarily go to market
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_01: executives, marketing leadership, people kind of in the revenue line, B2B companies.
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_01: And they're probably like tuning into this and they're like, what's your advice?
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_01: What do you know?
[00:38:50] SPEAKER_01: You don't speak on behalf of any specific vendor, but you see it all in a way that nobody
[00:38:55] SPEAKER_01: else does.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_01: I'll tell you mine for you to settle in the lab.
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_02: Sure.
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_02: I recently had a CRO effort for years.
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_02: The deepest respect.
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_02: Reach out to me in an almost panicked email.
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_02: I need to learn AI, right?
[00:39:07] SPEAKER_02: I'll do anything.
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_02: I'll intern for you.
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_02: I'll hang out with Amelia's office.
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_02: I'll do whatever.
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_02: And I hear this all the time.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_02: I need to learn AI.
[00:39:14] SPEAKER_02: I need to learn AI, Craig.
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_02: It's a great job.
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_02: It's the simplest advice.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_02: Tindallas.
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_02: Like, no, you need to do AI.
[00:39:22] Don't do it.
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_02: Don't learn it.
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_02: Buying a subscription to cloud does not count as learning AI.
[00:39:28] The way you're going to do it is pick an agent and an agent product.
[00:39:31] SPEAKER_02: Pick the simplest possible one use case.
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_02: And I know it can be scary for some people.
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_02: Deploy yourself.
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_02: Buy it.
[00:39:38] Set it up.
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_02: If you need a little bit of help connecting it to your CRM or your marketing, okay, that's
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_02: okay.
[00:39:44] SPEAKER_02: Do the connectors.
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_02: Own the deployment.
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_02: You don't know what training is.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_02: It's okay.
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_02: Take your time.
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_02: Do something simple.
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_02: If you deploy an agent yourself, train it, QA it, test it.
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_02: You will be ahead of 90% of the world.
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_02: Hands on.
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yourself.
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_02: It's up to you.
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_02: It's up to you.
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_02: And don't learn it.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_02: Don't learn it.
[00:40:04] SPEAKER_02: You know, we do so many workshops Wednesdays with CMOs.
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_02: They're like, oh, we encourage our team to use any AI tool they want.
[00:40:08] SPEAKER_02: Like, we allow them to try perplexity if they want.
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_02: And we encourage them to learn recipes online.
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, you will never learn a go-to motion in today's.
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_02: You got to do it, right?
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_02: And it can be scary to some people that don't want to do it.
[00:40:23] SPEAKER_02: It is different.
[00:40:25] It is different learning how to deploy and train an agent.
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_02: It's not what we were taught five years ago.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_02: And it is scary to people.
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_02: But it is not impossible.
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_02: But if you don't do it hands on keyboard, you will not have a job.
[00:40:37] SPEAKER_02: And literally, I'll give you another example.
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_02: And then I'll win here.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_02: For example, one of the, another CMO I love.
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_02: I've gotten her her last two jobs.
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_02: Obviously, I recommend it.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_02: Just reached out after many issues ready for her third.
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, I don't mean to me.
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_02: And I got nothing for you.
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_02: I was really drunk.
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, can I be honest with you?
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_02: It's like, yeah, I always trust you just.
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_02: I got nothing for you.
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_02: I gave you five ideas.
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_02: I got nothing for you.
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_02: You don't know this stuff yet.
[00:41:01] SPEAKER_02: You don't know this stuff yet.
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_02: You go out and deploy an agent.
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_02: Tell me how it worked.
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_02: Tell me how the training went.
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_02: I don't know the issues.
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_02: Come back to me.
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_02: I'll get you two jobs.
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_02: I got nothing.
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_02: I got nothing for her.
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_02: And honestly, because I get a lot of folks.
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_02: I know it's stressful to be a CMO,
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_02: but I'll tell you it's a weird thing.
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_02: There is much more demand than CMOS think.
[00:41:18] SPEAKER_02: If you, I know 100 CEOs today that for a great marketer,
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_02: they're desperate.
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_02: Okay, they'll do anything for a great marketer,
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_02: but they do not want someone running the Marquetto,
[00:41:30] you know, 2019 playbook.
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_02: Then there's just no interest in hiring that person.
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_02: So you got to do it.
[00:41:35] SPEAKER_02: You got to suck it up.
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_02: You got to do it.
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_02: It is scary.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_02: So do something simple, but if you don't,
[00:41:42] that's my best advice.
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_00: I would say I'll take the founder perspective,
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_00: which is like I was just talking to founder this week
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_00: because we're a dream force on, she was asking me
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_00: about all of our agents.
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_00: She's like, how's it going?
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_00: What do I need to know?
[00:41:55] SPEAKER_00: I have some agents, but I'm worried about,
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_00: I'm next worried about rolling this out to our sales team.
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm worried about sales specifically
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_00: for go to market AI, because I don't know how our 50 sellers
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_00: are going to react.
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_00: I think they might revolt or some of them might quit.
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_00: And I said, that's okay.
[00:42:13] Let them like, it's okay.
[00:42:15] It's almost Halloween.
[00:42:17] It's okay.
[00:42:17] Like it's nearing the end of 2025.
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_00: I think if your team can't get there over the hurdle,
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_00: some of them may quietly leave.
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_00: And that is okay.
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_00: But I was like, you can't forsake the future of your company
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_00: and how much faster could grow with AI booking meetings,
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_00: doing outbound for you to not hurt people's feelings.
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_00: I was like, you have to just go for it.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_00: Like rip the bandaid.
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_00: Like you got to go for it.
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_00: Obviously try and do it in the right way
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_00: where you can show them that they can be empowered
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_00: with the AI.
[00:42:44] SPEAKER_00: They can have more use cases.
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_00: They should actually be excited to do it
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_00: because they can crush their quota with AI.
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_00: Like they should be roaring to get the AI go
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_00: and not like scared of it, right?
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_00: So I'm like, if you see those people
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_00: that start to hide in the corner,
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_00: maybe it's okay if they quiet, you give them a turkey
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_00: and you let them weed themselves out, right?
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_00: But the other folks will want it
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_00: because they can do more.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_00: They can sell more.
[00:43:06] SPEAKER_00: They can buy another purse or whatever it is
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_00: for the holidays, right?
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_00: Because they'll crush their quota with AI.
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_00: Like they can book more meetings.
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_00: They can have better conversations.
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_00: They can get more inbound meetings.
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_00: Like they could just 10x themselves
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_00: as like eighties and sellers once they get over that fear
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_00: and I think a lot of people, the best ones will.
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_00: But I was like, you just gotta do it.
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_00: Like you just gotta go for it and not worry.
[00:43:27] SPEAKER_00: I was like, I know you're the founders.
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_00: So sometimes you do have to talk to people
[00:43:31] SPEAKER_00: and have therapy in your one-on-ones
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_00: but I was like, this is not one of those times.
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_00: Like just go for it.
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_01: That's actually a perfect way to end this podcast.
[00:43:38] SPEAKER_01: Rip the bandaid off because we gotta go.
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_01: We gotta go, guys.
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_00: It's almost 2026.
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_00: Well, Jason and Amelia, thank you so much
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_01: for being on the podcast here today
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_01: in qualified studios.
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, thanks for the time.
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_01: Thanks so much.
