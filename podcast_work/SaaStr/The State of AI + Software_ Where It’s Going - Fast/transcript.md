[00:00:00] So think about that for a minute. I mean, in the old days at 50 million, you'd probably have at
[00:00:05] Harry Stebbings: least 100 sales reps in the old days because at 50 million, you want to go to 100 million. So that's
[00:00:09] Harry Stebbings: net 50 million of bookings. 500K net for wrap with scaling and turnover. And turn that's pretty good.
[00:00:16] Harry Stebbings: So you would need 100 sales reps at 50 million. He's going to have five in a team of AIs.
[00:00:22] Harry Stebbings: It's not that he doesn't need sales reps. It's not even that he's not selling. He's actually a
[00:00:25] Harry Stebbings: classic sat guy turned AI guy. He's just doing it not only is it with less humans, but for
[00:00:30] Harry Stebbings: purpose, this he's doing it so much more efficiently. And he has 10,000 plus inbound leads a month.
[00:00:39] Hey, everybody at SAST or Connect Data, automate, busy work, and empower teams like nobody's business
[00:00:45] Harry Stebbings: with the one platform that grows with you every step of the way. Learn how Salesforce works for
[00:00:49] Harry Stebbings: startups at Salesforce.com slash SMB that Salesforce.com slash SMB.
[00:01:00] Hey, everybody at SAST or Finn is the number one AI agent for resolving complex queries like
[00:01:06] Harry Stebbings: refunds, transaction disputes, and technical troubleshooting, all with speed and reliability.
[00:01:11] Harry Stebbings: See how Finn can deliver the highest resolution rates and highest quality customer experience
[00:01:17] Harry Stebbings: at fin.ai slash saster. That's fi n dot AI slash saster.
[00:01:23] Hey, everybody. Get excited. Saster AI London is this December, December 1st and 2nd,
[00:01:29] Harry Stebbings: and we're on track to completely sell out what the playbooks for AI and B2B.
[00:01:34] Harry Stebbings: Join 2,000 plus BI and AI leaders for two days, two days of practical advice on scaling in
[00:01:40] Harry Stebbings: the new year. We'll have speakers flying in from open AI, whiz, clay, intercom, fin, and all your
[00:01:45] Harry Stebbings: favorite B2B companies, including yours truly with Harry Stebans and more doing our live 20VC podcast.
[00:01:50] Harry Stebbings: It'll be fun all in the heart of London. Don't miss out. Get your tickets. You can still go.
[00:01:56] Harry Stebbings: Go to podcast.sasterlundin.com. That's podcast.sasterlundin.com for special discount just for you.
[00:02:07] Welcome, everybody. Thanks for coming. We have a full day lined up. I think this is the
[00:02:13] Harry Stebbings: second AI day we've done this year. Amelia, does that sound right? Yeah.
[00:02:17] Harry Stebbings: Yeah, we will try to, well, I think we will do essentially, we'll try to do this every quarter
[00:02:23] Harry Stebbings: one or another. In May, it'll be live. It's saster annual. So we probably won't do a digital one.
[00:02:28] Harry Stebbings: Although that will all be streamed with 10,000 folks. But there is just so much going on in AI and
[00:02:34] Harry Stebbings: go to market in particular that that's what we're going to focus on. It's saster. I'm going to talk
[00:02:39] Harry Stebbings: to a deep dive on everything that I'm seeing in AI and software and go to market. We're going to do
[00:02:44] Harry Stebbings: an even better version of it live in London on December 1st and 2nd. If you want to come and learn
[00:02:49] Harry Stebbings: how to do AI and GDM together, please come to London. It's cheap by your ticket now. But this is a
[00:02:54] Harry Stebbings: theme we're going to do for the next 12 months. But the space is changing so much. I mean, just on our
[00:03:00] Harry Stebbings: little team, you know, at the end of Q1, we had no AI agents in production. We had nothing. Then
[00:03:05] Harry Stebbings: we added a general agent for support. And now we've got almost 20 AI agents. We've got
[00:03:12] Harry Stebbings: four different AISDRs running. We just rolled out Salesforce agent for us. We'll talk about that.
[00:03:16] Harry Stebbings: It just started the yesterday. So we need a little bit of time. We'll share all the data.
[00:03:20] Harry Stebbings: We've got an AI BDR from Qualified. The team from Qualified is going to share that really works
[00:03:24] Harry Stebbings: later today. We've got a slew of AI agents. And it is so much different even on our little team
[00:03:30] Harry Stebbings: the 90s ago. And it's going to keep changing. And I think we even little team Sastras probably a
[00:03:36] Harry Stebbings: little behind the curve at the start of the year. Now we're kind of at the bleeding edge. And so we
[00:03:40] Harry Stebbings: want to drag everybody along with us because everything's changing. The models are changing. The
[00:03:44] Harry Stebbings: tools are changing. Things that didn't work last year can work really well now. I mean, everyone
[00:03:49] Harry Stebbings: complained about how crummy AI AISDRs were last year. And there still are a lot of issues. But now we
[00:03:54] Harry Stebbings: know how to train them. Now we know how to iterate with them. Now we know how to make work. There's
[00:03:56] Harry Stebbings: so much more coming and marketing in some ways is even further behind sales. But it won't be.
[00:04:01] Harry Stebbings: And this whole space is going to radically change in the next 12 months. And to be honest, I think to
[00:04:06] Harry Stebbings: succeed for many folks in GTM in general, you're going to have to become an expert. It doesn't mean
[00:04:12] Harry Stebbings: you have to be a vibe coder like I've become. It doesn't mean you even need to play with things.
[00:04:19] Harry Stebbings: What it really means if you really want to if you feel behind an AI and go to market, if you feel
[00:04:23] Harry Stebbings: behind at anything, the real answer is be a part of a deployment. Go by any tool. Go by any tool
[00:04:29] Harry Stebbings: that comes and talks today. Go by any leading tool in the space. It's some level. It doesn't matter.
[00:04:35] Harry Stebbings: But don't just buy it. Be part of the deployment. Train it yourself. Be part of the onboarding. Be
[00:04:40] Harry Stebbings: part of the errors and the issues and the daily iterations that you have to do to get it going.
[00:04:45] Harry Stebbings: Don't just don't just set and forget and buy you will learn nothing. You will learn absolutely
[00:04:49] Harry Stebbings: nothing. Be part of a deployment to see how it really works. Otherwise, you'll never really learn.
[00:04:54] Harry Stebbings: So my med advice and we'll dig into that all day today and then live and London in December.
[00:04:59] But what I wanted to do today was iconic growth, which is one of the top, the leading
[00:05:06] Harry Stebbings: late stage B2B growth funds forever. From the early days when I managed Mark Zuckerberg's family
[00:05:11] Harry Stebbings: money to be in so many leaders from Canva and in Thropic and on down, they put out this great
[00:05:18] Harry Stebbings: report. I wrote it up on Saster and I linked it to the right. It's almost a hundred pages and
[00:05:25] Harry Stebbings: there's a lot of detail here and stuff. A lot of you don't really care about about public companies
[00:05:29] Harry Stebbings: and nuances. But I picked out I thought the 10 most relevant things to Saster folks for B2B that
[00:05:37] Harry Stebbings: showed just how much the world is changing. I think a lot of folks are behind here. A lot of folks
[00:05:42] Harry Stebbings: and it's okay. It's not necessarily fatal. We're not all being killed by chat GPT and
[00:05:47] on Thropic. But the world is changing. I thought this was a great set of data. There's all data
[00:05:52] Harry Stebbings: to show you just how it's changing and how we all have to adapt. And this first one
[00:05:58] Harry Stebbings: it kind of explains a lot of things that are just really confusing on social media. We're like,
[00:06:02] Harry Stebbings: oh, these AI native companies, they're burning all these tokens, their gross margins are low,
[00:06:07] Harry Stebbings: their revenues not sustainable. It's not real ARR and all that stuff's true. We will have a little
[00:06:13] Harry Stebbings: bit of time for Q&A at the end. We can talk about that. Here's the non-obvious thing. Yes, a lot
[00:06:18] Harry Stebbings: of AI companies, but not all. A lot of them have huge token costs. Certainly like Repplet that I
[00:06:23] Harry Stebbings: use a lot of loveable. ARR with the Xtremen, they use a lot of AI. There's other folks that you
[00:06:27] Harry Stebbings: would think use a lot of AI and don't. There's folks like Higgsfield and Opus Pro in video that
[00:06:34] Harry Stebbings: are pretty cash efficient. It's all over the place. But no matter what, whether the cogs are high or not,
[00:06:41] Harry Stebbings: the thing is these AI companies grow so fast that they're burned multiple is much better. It is
[00:06:48] Harry Stebbings: much better. Or at least not worse. So if you look here that you show that what's happening is
[00:06:57] Harry Stebbings: yes, they have higher cost of mitigators, but they're growing so quickly. They're growing so quickly
[00:07:04] Harry Stebbings: that that is outpacing the costs of AI. So it doesn't necessarily mean that they are less efficient.
[00:07:12] Harry Stebbings: And this is one of the many reasons VC money is all in AI. There's just no interest in traditional
[00:07:19] Harry Stebbings: slower growing software because yes, the costs are higher, but the costs for that incremental
[00:07:24] Harry Stebbings: dollar of ARR is often lower. And you can see at 100 million ARR, the burn multiple falls to
[00:07:30] Harry Stebbings: 0.4x for AI native companies versus 1.6 for classic SaaS companies. They're four times more efficient,
[00:07:37] Harry Stebbings: four times more efficient in adding ARR. Well, all that ARR stick, you know, I think if we look back
[00:07:45] Harry Stebbings: at our over the last two years, a lot of the pre-chatch.gbt stuff didn't stick, right? A lot of the
[00:07:50] Harry Stebbings: early apps that were that let you before before before chatch.gbt was really strong. There were sales
[00:07:56] Harry Stebbings: apps that just used to open AI API and he kind of helped SDRs write emails. A lot of that stuff died,
[00:08:02] Harry Stebbings: but I'm not I'm seeing NRR is not what it used to be. It has a looser definition, but most of the
[00:08:09] Harry Stebbings: high-growing AI companies I'm involved with have triple digit NRR. They have triple digit NRR.
[00:08:14] Harry Stebbings: And even when they don't, I think churning through some of your low-value customers, but keeping
[00:08:19] Harry Stebbings: your high-value customers will mean a lot of this revenue is pretty enduring. I'll give you a
[00:08:24] Harry Stebbings: personal example. If you follow me, you know, we've launched eight applications on Repplet,
[00:08:28] Harry Stebbings: even though our first failed somewhat spectacularly on social media. We've launched eight and there's
[00:08:34] Harry Stebbings: a lot of there's a lot of posts recently showing how a lot of the vibe coding apps are seen
[00:08:38] Harry Stebbings: some plateau and growth, not revenue growth, but in searches like and and maybe, but maybe that's
[00:08:43] Harry Stebbings: good because folks like us, we will never turn from my butt. I had eight apps in production. I'm not
[00:08:48] Harry Stebbings: taking them down. Our AI valuation calculator has been used almost half a million times. Okay,
[00:08:54] Harry Stebbings: we're not we're not going to take that down. Now, other folks, Amelia tried to do something different
[00:08:59] Harry Stebbings: on Lovelable in the early days. landing page didn't work, right? We ultimately moved it to Repplet.
[00:09:04] Harry Stebbings: Both are great. We moved it. That account probably churned, right? So there is a certain
[00:09:09] Harry Stebbings: try churn level, but once you get through those triers, the core audience can is often triple
[00:09:16] Harry Stebbings: digit revenue attention. So the thing is, yes, token cost or an issue, yes, AI is in cheap,
[00:09:21] Harry Stebbings: yes, in some ways, the only person making real money on AI is in video, but they grow just so fast
[00:09:27] Harry Stebbings: relative to the amount of capital that this is where this is why all the money's going there.
[00:09:31] Okay, and related to this, this is related to the prior point.
[00:09:35] This is super important. Magic number, when when do AI companies get profitable on sales and
[00:09:42] Harry Stebbings: marketing expense? And this is one of the reasons they're more efficient than you think. And
[00:09:45] Harry Stebbings: you probably intuitively know this, but this helps in the numbers. The reality is the best AI
[00:09:51] Harry Stebbings: need to be companies just have insane demand. Okay, they have insane demand. And it's because
[00:09:58] Harry Stebbings: they do something that's not like a little bit better, like a little bit better way to look at your
[00:10:02] Harry Stebbings: leads and context and opportunities or a slightly better way to do analytics. The reason they have
[00:10:07] Harry Stebbings: insane demand is they can do things you could never do before. Like look at Sora that just came out.
[00:10:11] Harry Stebbings: It's a number one iOS app. You can now do stuff on video you literally couldn't do a year ago.
[00:10:16] Harry Stebbings: You can't do it to air. Let's do a more practical B2B example. Like we talk a lot about gamma. We
[00:10:21] Harry Stebbings: use gamma to create all our sales collateral. A lot of the use of gamma is B2C, but gamma makes
[00:10:26] Harry Stebbings: slides with AI and you can just tell it what slides you want and it can pull data from all different
[00:10:30] Harry Stebbings: data sources. And we use it so that every saster sponsor gets a custom-deck made in minutes. It's
[00:10:36] Harry Stebbings: super cool. But gamma's ROI is so high to us. We found it and we paid for it. They didn't have,
[00:10:42] Harry Stebbings: they don't need a legion of endless marketing spend and endless sales spend. We found them and
[00:10:49] Harry Stebbings: the ROI is so high that they don't have to spend as much. So if you look at this chart, what's
[00:10:54] Harry Stebbings: happening is remembering, you know, a magic number better than one means you're making your money
[00:10:59] Harry Stebbings: back on sales and marketing in less than a year. And look at the ones that are rocketing at 100
[00:11:04] Harry Stebbings: million an ARR or rather above one. They're at 1.6. They're going profitable in six months.
[00:11:10] Versus, look at what happens traditionally at scale and SaaS, 0.5X. That means traditionally
[00:11:15] Harry Stebbings: at scale and SaaS. And this is true across almost all public SaaS and B2B companies. It takes you
[00:11:20] Harry Stebbings: two years to go profitable in a customer, two years. Now, to some extent, when you're big, when
[00:11:26] Harry Stebbings: you're public and you're doing 500 million, it's okay because your base doesn't cost that much. So
[00:11:30] Harry Stebbings: yes, your cost, your acquisition costs actually in traditional SaaS go up as you scale,
[00:11:35] Harry Stebbings: but it's tolerable because you have higher NRR and so much of your existing base stays with you. But
[00:11:41] the reason everyone is so it's not just that these AI companies are growing so quickly. It's
[00:11:45] Harry Stebbings: that they don't have to spend much in sales and marketing to get there. And I'll give you like
[00:11:50] Harry Stebbings: another personal example. I was talking with one of my old team who's now head of sales at an
[00:11:55] Harry Stebbings: AIB company that just crossed 50 million. Amelia talked to them too. I think yes, two people on
[00:12:00] Harry Stebbings: a sales team, Amelia at 50 million, two. Two. And what did he say was going to hire three or four
[00:12:05] Harry Stebbings: this year? Five, maybe you'd have a five person sales team. Yeah, but one to manage the AI.
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_00: So one managed all the AI and like three human sales people, right? Yep. So think about that for
[00:12:16] Harry Stebbings: a minute. I mean, in the old days at 50 million, you'd probably have at least 100 sales reps in
[00:12:21] Harry Stebbings: the old days because at 50 million, you want to go to 100 million. So that's net 50 million of
[00:12:26] Harry Stebbings: bookings, 500 K net per rep with scaling and turnover and turn that's pretty good. So you would need
[00:12:32] Harry Stebbings: 100 sales reps at 50 million. He's going to have five in a team of AI's. It's not that he doesn't
[00:12:37] Harry Stebbings: need sales reps. It's not even that he's not selling. He's actually a classic sat guy turned AI guy.
[00:12:42] Harry Stebbings: He's just doing it not only is it with less humans, but for purposes, he's doing it so much more
[00:12:47] Harry Stebbings: efficiently. And he has 10,000 plus inbound leads a month, 10,000 plus inbound leads a month.
[00:12:53] Harry Stebbings: Now listen, they have cogs and they have token costs and you can knock them and they have competition.
[00:12:57] Harry Stebbings: But that massive amount of inbound and the ability to close with so few headcount just makes these
[00:13:02] Harry Stebbings: companies at least from a sales and marketing perspective. And this is not intuitive.
[00:13:07] Harry Stebbings: Often radically more efficient than the traditional B2B motion. We're honestly in some ways,
[00:13:11] Harry Stebbings: you're trying to jam a slightly differentiated product down people's throats, a slightly better
[00:13:16] Harry Stebbings: marketing automation tool, slightly better drip marketing, slightly better cadence tool.
[00:13:22] Harry Stebbings: The best of the best, and this is what I would challenge everybody to do. You're like,
[00:13:26] Harry Stebbings: oh, I launched a co-pilot. Oh, I launched an AI chat. My revenue hasn't grown. Have you done
[00:13:31] Harry Stebbings: something that is so disruptive with AI? It couldn't be done before. That's where the massive pull is.
[00:13:37] Harry Stebbings: That's where the massive pull is. And yes, have I had a few bumps with Repplet? Yes, but
[00:13:42] Harry Stebbings: have I been able without an engineer to put eight apps into production that have been used
[00:13:46] Harry Stebbings: half a million times? Like that is so disruptive. Or the fact that we can now, instead of having
[00:13:51] Harry Stebbings: to send the same boring debt to every single sponsor, it's after everyone gets a real-time deck
[00:13:56] Harry Stebbings: that's customized for them with almost no work. This is just so disruptive that that's what you
[00:14:02] Harry Stebbings: need to find in AI. And if you find that today, and eventually, I guess this will all get mature,
[00:14:07] Harry Stebbings: if you can do something with AI that is utterly disruptive with instantly perceived ROI that has
[00:14:13] Harry Stebbings: never been done before. The demand is insane. It is just insane. It is off the charts. And even a
[00:14:20] Harry Stebbings: lot of the folks that are going to speak today, a lot of vendors and others that will talk during
[00:14:25] Harry Stebbings: the day, actually, many of them have more demand than they can service, more demand, and they're
[00:14:29] Harry Stebbings: turning away customers that aren't the ideal ICP or that they think will turn over. Or in many
[00:14:34] Harry Stebbings: cases, they just don't have enough forward-deployed engineers to roll everybody out. They're literally
[00:14:39] Harry Stebbings: turning away customers, which is in traditional SaaS, right or wrong, you take every deal that comes
[00:14:47] Harry Stebbings: in the door. So radically more efficient for now, not obvious. This one's really interesting for
[00:14:53] Harry Stebbings: my iconic. Now, it ties to the strong market pull. But another reason you can do more with less and
[00:15:01] Harry Stebbings: go to market is more deals are closing. So if you just, there's a lot going on in this chart,
[00:15:07] Harry Stebbings: but they're basically showing you classic funnels. And if you look here, it's especially
[00:15:13] Harry Stebbings: prominent scale, north of 100 million AI native B2B companies close, turn 56% of their free trials
[00:15:20] Harry Stebbings: to paid versus 32 of non-AI. Now, look, not all free trials are the same. Some AI companies make
[00:15:26] Harry Stebbings: you pay almost immediately. I tried to use an AI geo, like not SEO company, but for a geo,
[00:15:33] Harry Stebbings: to see how your AI SEO works. I couldn't even get any results without putting in my credit card.
[00:15:39] Harry Stebbings: I bounced others might pay. But other AI apps are incredibly free for a long time. Like,
[00:15:45] Harry Stebbings: you can do so much on hopeless clip for free. Make free clips for your B2B content for social media.
[00:15:50] Harry Stebbings: You can do more than you think if you're careful on rep litter level for free. You can't do
[00:15:54] Harry Stebbings: good. You can't do that much. But you can actually do quite a little bit. There are many apps out there
[00:15:59] Harry Stebbings: that are surprisingly free in AI. So I think on the blend, they're probably comparable. But think,
[00:16:04] Harry Stebbings: 56% of your free trials closing versus 32%. That's radically different. That's radically different.
[00:16:13] So this is another reason they're more efficient. There's just so much more demand and people will
[00:16:16] Harry Stebbings: convert. Okay, this chart, again, this is a theme and then we'll move on to another theme. But
[00:16:24] this one is really interesting what you're seeing. It ties a little bit. It's the other side of the
[00:16:28] Harry Stebbings: story we just told of someone on my old team that's at 50 million with with four folks and sales.
[00:16:34] Harry Stebbings: Gonna add a few more in AI's. It's not that we have no humans in overall.
[00:16:42] The overall sort of sales and post sales. It's just reporting much more energy into
[00:16:47] Harry Stebbings: forward deployed engineers, which we'll talk about next and into post sales. In other words,
[00:16:51] Harry Stebbings: we're putting a lot more effort overall in AI B2B to getting folks trained and onboarded.
[00:16:56] And it's a massive change. So if you look at this in this chart,
[00:17:04] Harry Stebbings: post sales is 31% of AI native companies versus as low as 22% in traditional SaaS.
[00:17:11] Harry Stebbings: Traditional SaaS. And it's probably even more than that because if you think about what's
[00:17:14] Harry Stebbings: traditional SaaS? Well, I'll say you this product. It'll take you like three months to pilot it.
[00:17:20] Harry Stebbings: The rest of the year to roll it out to the rest of your team. And then two years to get ROI.
[00:17:24] Harry Stebbings: Maybe even I'll have an agency at HubSpotter Shopify or Salesforce that will help you deploy.
[00:17:29] Harry Stebbings: That's just not flying here. What customers are expecting or they will turn with AI B2B
[00:17:36] Harry Stebbings: companies and is required to train them is that when we go, we go. It works. It works. So
[00:17:43] Harry Stebbings: Amelia's talked about this. We've done a lot on our SaaS stuff with our three AISDRs and AIS
[00:17:49] Harry Stebbings: five AISDRs and BDRs in total. They all took about three to four weeks to train.
[00:17:55] And then iteration daily after that. And that training, that onboarding,
[00:18:01] we did it all. Even us and we're pretty AI savvy. Amelia is about the best that there is. We still
[00:18:06] Harry Stebbings: did it together with the vendor for weeks. And so you need if you, if so many of this horror stories,
[00:18:12] Harry Stebbings: you hear about an AISDR failing, I asked the folks, how much time did you spend training it?
[00:18:17] Harry Stebbings: How much information did you? How much iterations did you? How much none? Well, of course,
[00:18:21] Harry Stebbings: it doesn't work. If you don't train an agent with a lot of data, especially in GTM, it just doesn't
[00:18:26] Harry Stebbings: work. And so we all figured this out. And so as we'll see on the next slide, the biggest hiring in D2B
[00:18:33] Harry Stebbings: is in forward deployed engineers. And if you haven't been through it on the other side,
[00:18:38] Harry Stebbings: forward deployed engineers, the terms started at Palantir where they would do these
[00:18:42] Harry Stebbings: these eight figure nine figure contracts and everything was semi-custom. And so they would have
[00:18:47] Harry Stebbings: forward deployed engineers. Instead of having a business person that barely knew the product,
[00:18:51] Harry Stebbings: they would put recently technical people sitting in their customers offices getting Palantir to work
[00:18:56] Harry Stebbings: before they went live. And in some cases before they charged them, this has sort of become
[00:19:01] Harry Stebbings: productized, not for these huge deals, but for 50 K deals. It's hard to do it for for five K deal,
[00:19:06] Harry Stebbings: but if 50 A-T yield, the vendor will help take ownership of the fact that all of your data is in
[00:19:11] Harry Stebbings: the AI and tuned and trained it and working. If you don't do this, you're going to fail in these
[00:19:16] Harry Stebbings: products. It's not going to work. They do not work out of the box. This is one of the biggest lies
[00:19:21] Harry Stebbings: in a lot of AIB to be applications that they magically work out of the box without training. They
[00:19:25] Harry Stebbings: don't. So people, the smart vendors that are succeeding are putting less efforts into sales
[00:19:31] Harry Stebbings: resources that frequently don't know the product whatsoever. And they're putting those efforts into
[00:19:35] Harry Stebbings: folks that can make sure the customers they do have because there's higher demand.
[00:19:39] Harry Stebbings: Are trained and onboarded extremely well. In a way, we've never done in SaaS. We've never done in
[00:19:45] Harry Stebbings: SaaS. We've almost, frankly, most of SaaS, we've forced the customer to do it all themselves.
[00:19:50] Harry Stebbings: They just fails in AI. So it doesn't work. So if you look at this next slide, it's just interesting.
[00:19:56] Harry Stebbings: The forward deployed engineer is by far the strongest hiring trend in the last 12 months.
[00:20:01] Harry Stebbings: It's off the charts. Everyone has figured this out. Look, if you have a very simple low-end AI
[00:20:06] Harry Stebbings: product, you don't need any forward deployed engineers. But for probably most people on this or
[00:20:11] Harry Stebbings: watching now or later, you have a workload product. If you have a product with workload,
[00:20:16] Harry Stebbings: a classic SaaS product, and you want it to work in AI, it is going to require training that
[00:20:22] Harry Stebbings: agent. We're not yet at the point in B2B where AI's can train AI's or we're so-called
[00:20:27] Harry Stebbings: evaluations can do it all for you. No. Even on our own AI agents at SaaS, we have 10 years of
[00:20:33] Harry Stebbings: data on 50,000 people that have attended our event and 500,000 people in our database. All that data
[00:20:38] Harry Stebbings: has to be ingested. It has to be QA'd. It has to be tested. There are still hallucinations or
[00:20:44] Harry Stebbings: hallucination-related issues that all has to be iterated. Also that when an email goes out,
[00:20:48] Harry Stebbings: it doesn't say crazy things. If all you do is buy an AI SDR tool and don't train it,
[00:20:54] Harry Stebbings: you will just have sales after outreach from seven years ago. That's all you're going to get.
[00:20:58] Harry Stebbings: It's going to be marginally better. You will think it doesn't work. You have to train these tools.
[00:21:04] Harry Stebbings: The answer is this huge trend of forward deployed engineers. It was funny. We did a 20VC
[00:21:11] Harry Stebbings: with Harry, me, and Rory. Maybe a month ago with Mark Benioff. It's a good one if you want to watch it.
[00:21:16] He said this is the number one thing he was jealous of. Palantir was one of it was how
[00:21:21] Harry Stebbings: how L.A. charged their customers. It was most jealous of what they've done in forward deployed
[00:21:25] Harry Stebbings: engineers. He said, what I would love at Salesforce is that everybody's Salesforce AI works before
[00:21:30] Harry Stebbings: they even pay us. It works before they even say go. Mark said this. That's what he wants. It is
[00:21:35] Harry Stebbings: so radically different from the way we've bought B2B software. When I was back when I was a VP
[00:21:39] Harry Stebbings: to Adobe, it took us almost five years to go live on Salesforce. Five years, a lot of business
[00:21:45] Harry Stebbings: process change. A lot of this, a lot of that. Business process change is still a big deal in the
[00:21:50] Harry Stebbings: enterprise, but people with AI, the expectation bars have gone way up. They want something that is a
[00:21:54] Harry Stebbings: step function. You've got to help them train these AI so that when they go live, it's
[00:21:59] Harry Stebbings: matchable. Mark Benioff wants it. You should want it too. A couple more points. This one's just
[00:22:07] Harry Stebbings: captain obvious. I won't spend a lot of time on this. It's still early in the AI journey. To
[00:22:14] Harry Stebbings: some extent, I would not be surprised if when a lot of the leaders go public, they start to have
[00:22:20] Harry Stebbings: roughly similar headcount to what we're seeing in classic B2B companies. Because there's a little
[00:22:25] Harry Stebbings: bit of convergence, B2B companies got the fattest and least efficient ever going into 2021.
[00:22:32] Harry Stebbings: Like public SaaS companies often had less than 200,000 in revenue per employees because the markets
[00:22:38] Harry Stebbings: didn't care. If you're one of the folks that still want to go back in time to 2021, it's never
[00:22:43] Harry Stebbings: going to happen. It's never going to happen. Not only is AI changed the world, but we're never
[00:22:48] Harry Stebbings: going to live in a world where $200,000 per employee is tolerable when you're public. It's now
[00:22:53] Harry Stebbings: $400,000 and up, $400,000 to $500,000. But the pre-AI companies have figured that out. They've
[00:22:58] Harry Stebbings: gotten lean one way or the other. But the AI companies are often hyper lean. I mean, hyper lean.
[00:23:04] Harry Stebbings: Not all of them, lean a thousand employees at 100 million. Maybe that's a more more classic look,
[00:23:10] Harry Stebbings: but lovable getting to $100,000,000 with 45 employees.
[00:23:14] Cursor, I don't know if they really had 20, but certainly less than $100,000 to $150,000,000,
[00:23:19] Harry Stebbings: $11,000 labs the same. We're getting there with radically fewer employees in the beginning.
[00:23:25] There's often really just, it seems crazy and it is crazy, but there's really just two root causes,
[00:23:30] Harry Stebbings: two reasons if you look at it. One is, they're often essentially single products, so that certainly
[00:23:36] Harry Stebbings: helps. If pre-AI, the demand was lower, so you often had to have two or three products to get
[00:23:43] Harry Stebbings: 200 million in revenue. So you need two to three teams and two to three different sales teams,
[00:23:47] Harry Stebbings: and often two to three different engineering teams. That alone takes up a lot of people. These are
[00:23:51] Harry Stebbings: often, not that they don't have different features, but these are still mostly single product
[00:23:55] Harry Stebbings: companies. And also, a lot of them have very, very lean sales to marketing teams. So traditionally,
[00:24:01] Harry Stebbings: half your head count or more is in sales and marketing. Traditionally, 30 to 40% of your
[00:24:06] Harry Stebbings: companies just sales people. You're just not seeing that. So being single product and having
[00:24:11] Harry Stebbings: almost having a much smaller sales and marketing team enables these companies to be smaller.
[00:24:19] Okay, next point that I thought this was really interesting from the iconic data.
[00:24:24] And it's a reminder that AI washing don't work. Putting AI in your website, don't make,
[00:24:30] Harry Stebbings: don't make you a rocket ship. 94% of public B2B companies now mention AI and say they have AI agents.
[00:24:40] Adobe on its last earnings call. Adobe is, I mean, it has some AI tools in creative, but it's not
[00:24:47] Harry Stebbings: ahead of a lot of the competition. I think it said it had a five billion of AI influenced revenue.
[00:24:54] Harry Stebbings: AI influenced revenue. What more? But my point is everyone is either is an AI company or
[00:25:01] Harry Stebbings: there's sort of an AI company. Everyone has a co-pilot. A lot of co-pilots are terrible. A lot of
[00:25:05] Harry Stebbings: them don't work, but everyone's got a little AI, a little clippy 3.0 waving at you to help you.
[00:25:10] Harry Stebbings: Everyone's got some AI. It's not enough. It's not, it's not, was this, could you AI wash late a year,
[00:25:17] Harry Stebbings: 14 months ago? Maybe, maybe you've got people's attention. Today, everyone's an AI company. So
[00:25:22] Harry Stebbings: what really matters is, again, have you built something that is so disruptive with AI that it will
[00:25:27] Harry Stebbings: generate massive market pull because it wasn't done before because if it's just saying that you have
[00:25:31] Harry Stebbings: everyone's got an AI agent, it's just not a chain. 94% of public companies are a claim their AI
[00:25:36] Harry Stebbings: companies now. Okay, maybe just four more points and then we'll open it up to questions. I think
[00:25:46] Harry Stebbings: we mostly hit this one on headcount, but this sort of summarizes it. Startups are going as they
[00:25:55] Harry Stebbings: scale up have have error per FD has gone from 182 to 237. Again, it, once your public, it's more like
[00:26:01] Harry Stebbings: 400 to 500, but this is this is materially more significant while operating expenses has remained
[00:26:09] Harry Stebbings: flat, even with inflation. So we're spending less overall per employee and their 20, at least
[00:26:17] Harry Stebbings: they're, we're at least getting 20 to 30% more error per employee than before. So
[00:26:23] and we're not paying them more net net doesn't mean that there's not salary inflation,
[00:26:28] Harry Stebbings: but net net we're not paying them more. So if you're not working 20 at least 20 to 30% harder than you
[00:26:33] Harry Stebbings: were 25 months ago, you're behind the curve. And if you feel like you're working 20 to 30% harder
[00:26:40] Harry Stebbings: than 24 months ago, good because that is the minimum required to be successful in today's world.
[00:26:48] Okay, just two more than I'll share where I think it's going and this one is minor, I think compared
[00:26:54] Harry Stebbings: to the others, but I still thought it was interesting. I'm not sure I like this term off-shored. I
[00:27:00] Harry Stebbings: think we all have distributed teams now and most of us have globally distributed teams. So
[00:27:04] Harry Stebbings: iconic use this term, not me, but it is interesting to see that going into 2026, we have far far
[00:27:13] Harry Stebbings: more employees that are what they call off-shored, right? And it's mostly within engineering as it
[00:27:19] Harry Stebbings: been, but this trend is increasing. This trend is increasing from 24% of headcount so-called off-shored
[00:27:26] outside of your primary location and country, international headcount up to 30. So just sort of
[00:27:33] Harry Stebbings: interesting that it's almost two counterveiling trends. The whole world in AI is coming to SF.
[00:27:39] Harry Stebbings: I put together, I should have put it to this slide. SF, almost all the hiring and net hiring
[00:27:45] Harry Stebbings: and tech is in SF. It's twice New York and basically after SF in New York there is no net hiring.
[00:27:50] Harry Stebbings: It's net negative in Austin. It's net negative in Miami, all of it because everyone there is
[00:27:55] Harry Stebbings: flocking. But at the same time, we're using distributed and international folks of our team even
[00:28:00] Harry Stebbings: more than ever before. So both are happening. We're getting more San Francisco-E and we're getting
[00:28:05] Harry Stebbings: more global at the same time, which is somewhat interesting. So think local, go, global. Think local,
[00:28:10] Harry Stebbings: go, global. Okay, final one is Captain Obvious. We've written on this on SAS for multiple times.
[00:28:17] Harry Stebbings: It's been on multiple workshop Wednesdays, but I felt I had to pull this slide one more time so
[00:28:22] Harry Stebbings: that you, so that especially founders and executives know this and D2B. I know it's Captain Obvious,
[00:28:28] Harry Stebbings: but all the venture money is into high growth AI companies, high growth AI companies. Last year
[00:28:35] Harry Stebbings: was 363 billion, which was a massive jump from 2023 as you can see. But already this year,
[00:28:42] Harry Stebbings: it succeeded all of last year just in the first six months alone, 377 billion in the first six
[00:28:47] Harry Stebbings: months. So the amount of capital into AI will be off the charts this year. You can see it on Twitter,
[00:28:53] Harry Stebbings: you can smell it, you can feel it walking in the streets of San Francisco. But here are the
[00:28:57] Harry Stebbings: Rod Nowers. It's crazy as last year was off the charts. It's already more than doubled. And it
[00:29:02] Harry Stebbings: is 70, 80% of all venture capital. It's not going in just adding the co-pilot is not enough. 97%
[00:29:10] Harry Stebbings: of public companies have an AI co-pilot or an AI agent. It's not enough. VCs are looking for what
[00:29:16] Harry Stebbings: we've seen in this slide. They're looking for faster growth with better sales and marketing
[00:29:21] Harry Stebbings: efficiency and huge inbound demand, huge demand from the markets. And this is one that I, again,
[00:29:28] Harry Stebbings: I think a lot of folks are struggling with because many folks in B2B have had to generate a lot of
[00:29:34] Harry Stebbings: that demand. And that still works. That's still important. The leaders in AI B2B are doing events.
[00:29:41] Harry Stebbings: The 11 labs is doing a huge event. I think in a couple weeks open AI has done, done one just the
[00:29:47] Harry Stebbings: other day. Everyone's doing events. Everyone's doing webinars. Everyone's at the best events like
[00:29:51] Harry Stebbings: Saster Annual and A. Subbit and Saster One. They're all doing this stuff. But I've top of it,
[00:29:55] Harry Stebbings: they have massive inbound demand. And this is just what VCs want or what is on this fair or not.
[00:30:01] Harry Stebbings: If you just look at some of these charts, ask yourself, if you had a lot of money to invest,
[00:30:05] Harry Stebbings: where would you invest? You would invest here too. Even if there's risk, even if there's risk
[00:30:10] Harry Stebbings: that this revenue is in that state. Okay, so just to kind of summarize before we take questions,
[00:30:14] Harry Stebbings: what are we seeing at Saster? We're up to, again, adding agent force this week, depending how you
[00:30:21] Harry Stebbings: count is either our 12th or 21st AI agent at Saster. And it's our sixth sort of AI SDR BDR that we've
[00:30:28] Harry Stebbings: added. It's just starting, guys. This is just, I think we're at the bleeding edge. We have other
[00:30:32] Harry Stebbings: webinars and presentation up with all of our data, all the vendors are use everything. But it's just
[00:30:37] Harry Stebbings: getting going. It's going to be so much better in six and 12 months and we're so early that
[00:30:43] Harry Stebbings: if you were a skeptic six months ago, please don't be a skeptic today. Please embrace the future.
[00:30:48] Harry Stebbings: It's okay if you're in a conservative industry. It's okay if you hit your number without any help.
[00:30:53] Harry Stebbings: I was just this week with VP of support at a very, very fast growing D2B company and I asked
[00:31:02] Harry Stebbings: him what AI agent used for support. He's like, now we don't need anybody. Honestly, our product,
[00:31:07] Harry Stebbings: we don't, we do a million interactions a day. We only get about 200 tickets. We have a team of
[00:31:12] Harry Stebbings: 15 global and they can pretty much cover that. I'm like, maybe you're the one B2B startup, I know
[00:31:18] Harry Stebbings: that doesn't need an agent is like, can you answer every single customer query in real time?
[00:31:23] Harry Stebbings: Well, actually, you're right. We can't. I mean, then at least have an agent do that. We're just
[00:31:27] Harry Stebbings: getting going. We're just getting going. It's so early. And the second point, and this is one
[00:31:31] Harry Stebbings: Mark Benioff made when we did this session with him. Sales force does have a lot of challenges
[00:31:37] Harry Stebbings: today. It's a $42 billion business and there's a lot to do. But this point is so many of their
[00:31:42] Harry Stebbings: customers have just started with AI. They're so early compared to what a lot of us are doing.
[00:31:47] Harry Stebbings: What it means is the good times are still to come. I mean, the penetration rate,
[00:31:52] Harry Stebbings: from the first two points, the penetration rate is so low that just as we saw on the
[00:31:57] Harry Stebbings: prior site for VC, 2025 is the first half already clips 2024 for agents and B2B AI, like 2026
[00:32:05] Harry Stebbings: is going to be an order of map. Maybe it might be an order of magnitude bigger than this year.
[00:32:09] Harry Stebbings: It should be an order of magnitude, just gotten going. And so the third point,
[00:32:13] Harry Stebbings: I've tried to kick everybody's arse. If you came to Sasser annual in AI summit this year,
[00:32:19] Harry Stebbings: I told everyone you got to get working much harder. I've told people if you didn't get your AI
[00:32:25] Harry Stebbings: product out by June 30, you were too late, you were behind, there's no excuse. I believe in all that
[00:32:29] Harry Stebbings: stuff. There's no like this AI stuff ain't new. If you're not in market today, it's pretty embarrassing.
[00:32:35] Harry Stebbings: Your team isn't good enough. They're too slow. Having said all of that, and I stand behind all of that,
[00:32:42] when I look at where we're just getting going on agents and enterprises, it's not too late for
[00:32:46] Harry Stebbings: anybody. No matter how it feels with loveable and versel and clay and all of this stuff,
[00:32:54] Harry Stebbings: it's great that these folks have exploded and shown us the way. For most of you, your customers
[00:32:59] Harry Stebbings: are still early. Most restaurants and beauty slons and regulated industries and big enterprises,
[00:33:07] Harry Stebbings: they've barely started. If you're behind, it's not as bad as I thought, but it's time to catch up,
[00:33:13] Harry Stebbings: because 2026 is going to be 10x larger for AIB to be than it is this year, at least 10x larger.
[00:33:22] The last point on this for the skeptics. If you still don't think AI works, if you don't think it
[00:33:29] Harry Stebbings: works for support or sales or marketing or anything, try a well-trained one. If nothing else,
[00:33:36] Harry Stebbings: go to sassar.com, click on the bottom right where we have our general AI agent from Delphi and talk
[00:33:42] Harry Stebbings: to it, share your B2B issues. Talk about a candidate you want to hire. Talk, share a sales script,
[00:33:51] Harry Stebbings: do whatever and interact with it. It might be great. It might be decent. I don't think you're
[00:33:57] Harry Stebbings: going to think it's terrible. In fact, if you have a sales marketing go-to-market customer success
[00:34:02] Harry Stebbings: conversation with Sassar's AI, which is trained on 20 million words of content. It's trained on
[00:34:07] Harry Stebbings: every tweet of ever written. It will be trained tomorrow on this video automatically. Everything I say
[00:34:11] Harry Stebbings: will be ingested into that AI tomorrow. That is going to be better than probably 95% of the
[00:34:20] Harry Stebbings: customer support you reach out to and see today, but it can show you that you can do the same.
[00:34:24] Harry Stebbings: You can do this. Stop saying that this crap doesn't work and go try one that does work and
[00:34:29] Harry Stebbings: start with us. It's free. Go to sassar.com or sassar.ai or go to sassar.ai. It's really the same
[00:34:34] Harry Stebbings: thing and click on AI mentor at the top. It will bring it up. Ask any of your questions.
[00:34:39] Harry Stebbings: Pretty sure you can think it's you may think it's we have folks that are on this all day long. It's
[00:34:43] Harry Stebbings: a little it's a lot. Okay, asking questions all day long about their teams. We have folks that come
[00:34:47] Harry Stebbings: and go 95% of folks say it's pretty good. So try one that works before being such a such a
[00:34:54] Harry Stebbings: Debbie downer and a skeptic. And then a couple last points here. And I think the second one is
[00:35:03] Harry Stebbings: the most important. And a lot of a lot of sales folks are either struggling with this at one
[00:35:10] Harry Stebbings: way or the other or adapting or just starting to adapt to it. But the reality is almost every
[00:35:14] Harry Stebbings: VP of sales and CRO I work with once a leaner team now. Now last year you could see this with COs.
[00:35:20] Harry Stebbings: It started it started pre AI people thought Elon Musk was crazy when he bought Twitter and laid
[00:35:26] Harry Stebbings: off two thirds of the company. He probably had no choice because it stretched him financially at
[00:35:30] Harry Stebbings: the time and Twitter was pretty unleamed just like everybody was everyone was unleamed in 2021.
[00:35:35] Harry Stebbings: Everyone at twice as many employees for a dollar of revenue in the app today people are twice as
[00:35:39] Harry Stebbings: efficient as they were in 2021 and people thought Elon was crazy. Maybe Elon is crazy. I'm not
[00:35:43] Harry Stebbings: I'm not here to talk about politics or other things. The guy is pretty successful, but he might be
[00:35:46] Harry Stebbings: crazy. Maybe we all are maybe everyone in tech that successful is crazy. But at pre stage what was
[00:35:53] Harry Stebbings: happening in last year every you know then the public markets put pressure on folks so folks had
[00:35:57] Harry Stebbings: to get leaner right. And at first COs on some cases were reluctant to to do layoffs that they
[00:36:03] Harry Stebbings: didn't want to do or to shrink teams because they wanted the kumbaya days of 2021 to last forever.
[00:36:08] Harry Stebbings: But going into 2021 for every CEO I know to want to be a leaner team. No one wanted be folks anymore.
[00:36:14] Harry Stebbings: No one wanted complainers or folks that took three weeks to get something done just
[00:36:19] Harry Stebbings: COs were done. But I didn't but I found sales leaders were the most reluctant to have small
[00:36:25] Harry Stebbings: teams and marketing leaders. A lot of CMOs still needed 10 folks to run a campaign and they needed
[00:36:30] Harry Stebbings: all of their agencies and a lot of CROs were still were stressed that without enough capacity they
[00:36:37] Harry Stebbings: could not hit the number in other words to go from 50 to 100 million I need at least 100 sales reps.
[00:36:42] Harry Stebbings: That's the math 500 can capacity for reps and you better have 100 reps or I'm not taking this job
[00:36:47] Harry Stebbings: right you better go raise some more money. Even now I'm I think everyone has gotten religion
[00:36:52] Harry Stebbings: here that they want leaner teams they are tired of folks that don't crush themselves and sales
[00:36:57] Harry Stebbings: jobs are harder. So just be aware if you if you if you're still looking back on the good old days
[00:37:03] Harry Stebbings: of these massive teams and not really knowing the product working that no one wants this anymore
[00:37:10] Harry Stebbings: not even VP sales heroes. Okay this next point is probably the the most important one I want to say
[00:37:17] Harry Stebbings: to GGM leaders and then we'll then we'll open up to questions. It's calm down a little bit but if
[00:37:26] Harry Stebbings: but certainly the first half of this year and late last year the vibe on LinkedIn was it's now
[00:37:33] Harry Stebbings: working outbound doesn't work anymore everything's harder SEO doesn't work nothing nothing's working
[00:37:37] Harry Stebbings: guys what do you guys know that's working because nothing works for us. Our terrible text messages
[00:37:42] Harry Stebbings: to folks aren't responded to anymore are generic emails with 11 fonts and four colors with with
[00:37:49] Harry Stebbings: the talk about customers that aren't even in your industry don't work anymore it does it doesn't work
[00:37:53] Harry Stebbings: higher in the night the 20 year old SDR with zero training sending a thousand emails doesn't work
[00:37:59] Harry Stebbings: what was me nothing works it all works again look at the leaders in AI and AAB2B they're doing webinars
[00:38:09] Harry Stebbings: they have sales teams they have they may have one SDR human and nine SDR AIs but they're doing
[00:38:17] Harry Stebbings: they're doing outbound okay they're doing outbound they're doing events they're doing field marketing
[00:38:21] Harry Stebbings: they're doing demand gen they're doing multi touch they are doing S content they're doing content
[00:38:26] Harry Stebbings: marketing they're doing video they're doing all of it because all the old plays work just the playbooks
[00:38:33] Harry Stebbings: don't the playbooks don't and so especially as CEOs you've got to be just more it's always been the
[00:38:41] Harry Stebbings: number one risk hiring a sales or marketing or customer success or any GTM leader of hiring someone
[00:38:47] Harry Stebbings: that just wants to bring the playbook from their last company it's almost never work especially if
[00:38:51] Harry Stebbings: they work somewhere much bigger but it works even less good today even less good today I know less
[00:38:56] Harry Stebbings: well less good today because those playbooks are just stale the plays work but they have to be run
[00:39:01] Harry Stebbings: differently they have to be run more intelligent they have to be run with AI they have to be run
[00:39:04] Harry Stebbings: at scale they everything has to be trained and so don't stop running the plays folks don't stop
[00:39:12] Harry Stebbings: showing up at the end of the day you have to one way or another you have to build awareness for
[00:39:18] Harry Stebbings: and even if your app has massive viral poll or word of mouth poll like a lot of apps you need multiple
[00:39:23] Harry Stebbings: touches you need to remind things why are the Sam Altman everywhere that dude is everywhere okay and
[00:39:28] Harry Stebbings: open AI is the most successful start up of all times it there's at many levels it's because
[00:39:33] Harry Stebbings: multi touch works you've got to it really helps to show up and a lot of the most successfuls and
[00:39:38] Harry Stebbings: anthropic open AI these folks look they're there one way and the other or they're all over
[00:39:46] Harry Stebbings: the place they are present because it works and they are doing events and they are doing webinars
[00:39:50] Harry Stebbings: and they are doing marketing and go to the hottest AI companies and you're gonna and look then
[00:39:54] Harry Stebbings: just calmly look at their marketing site you're gonna see all the old plays just often done really
[00:39:59] Harry Stebbings: well for the age so make don't use the old playbook but don't not use the plays they all work
[00:40:06] Harry Stebbings: and finally we hit this one but I know I've said this too much but it's just not enough
[00:40:13] Harry Stebbings: folks listen there is no interest in classic SaaS companies from vcs growing at pretty good rates
[00:40:20] Harry Stebbings: if you're growing 80% at 20 million or 70% at 50 million it's it's not cool dude but there
[00:40:29] Harry Stebbings: no one's gonna fund you nobody and and actually it's worse than that and maybe I'll end on this
[00:40:34] Harry Stebbings: it's worse than that and this one took me a little while to figure out we we talked about it a lot
[00:40:37] Harry Stebbings: on 20 vc this week but um not only our vcs not interested in a company at 20 million growing 80
[00:40:44] Harry Stebbings: percent there's something much worse and this is just I wish it wasn't the case because I don't have
[00:40:48] Harry Stebbings: any silver lining here private equity firms aren't aren't interested either and there used to be
[00:40:53] Harry Stebbings: from 2012 2013 until 2023 so there was a decade where if your growth was decent but not great in SaaS
[00:41:01] Harry Stebbings: but your burn rate was low and your NRR was high maybe DCs wouldn't touch you but a private equity
[00:41:05] Harry Stebbings: firm would come in and buy you for six to sometimes ten times revenue you get to 20 million revenue
[00:41:11] Harry Stebbings: growing say 50 percent 60 percent and cash flow neutral look no vc was gonna fund you there but a
[00:41:18] Harry Stebbings: private equity firm might buy you for 150 or even 200 million dollars sometimes I don't see any
[00:41:24] Harry Stebbings: of those deals they've disappeared because private equity isn't immune to the fact that public
[00:41:29] Harry Stebbings: SaaS companies have seen growth decay that NRR is in sticky that AI new AI vendors are putting
[00:41:35] Harry Stebbings: the old guys at risk so PE has disappeared and DCs are flocked to hyper growth AI companies and
[00:41:43] Harry Stebbings: this may or may not change but at least don't live in a dream world where the next round you think
[00:41:49] Harry Stebbings: the next round is gonna come close growth is pretty good it won't if you have any doubt
[00:41:53] we got the numbers go to saster AI dot AI and click AI vc at the top and we and literally we added
[00:41:59] Harry Stebbings: a new benchmarking it's our third tool there upload your latest investor update or board deck or
[00:42:05] Harry Stebbings: vc pitch we will tell you the exact odds you get funded the exact odds and if you don't like it don't
[00:42:10] Harry Stebbings: shoot the messenger it's based on all the recent data 5,000 rounds and more and I talked to way too
[00:42:16] Harry Stebbings: many founders that think they're gonna get funded and b2b and they ain't so just at least find out
[00:42:20] Harry Stebbings: we built the tool it's benchmarking it's cool and thanks everybody and Amelia do we have any
[00:42:26] Harry Stebbings: questions we want to get to I know you got to run in a minute yeah I got to run in a minute to go
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_00: talk to snowflake but what's your opinion on how do you start to thoughtfully introduce AI SDR
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_00: to the sales team without scaring off the existing SDR slash sales team yeah and literally I
[00:42:45] Harry Stebbings: was funny I was at um it's fun I had I was dealing with this yesterday so I was at the company
[00:42:50] Harry Stebbings: meeting for company invested in called mangle mint that is um sass for slawons and spas and doctors
[00:42:56] Harry Stebbings: offices great company great great CEO great culture people were just so excited at their all hands
[00:43:02] Harry Stebbings: and this see see see oh and I are really close he said and I had to do a presentation it wasn't
[00:43:06] Harry Stebbings: like this but it was kind of where agents going and he asked me just do me one favor don't scare the SDRs
[00:43:12] it's sad don't don't scare them with all this stuff I'm like okay I won't
[00:43:17] but I actually I'd already had lunch I sat down at tables with all the SDRs so I'd already actually
[00:43:21] Harry Stebbings: had the conversation with SDRs they understood that the the best this is the best have as more
[00:43:30] Harry Stebbings: a partner role as as the rest and the others don't and the the vps sales sat down with me and she
[00:43:35] Harry Stebbings: gave the same message she's like we're we're aggressively in on all these tools and we are growing
[00:43:40] Harry Stebbings: we're growing triple digits at at at eight figures in revenue and this is the future we have to
[00:43:45] Harry Stebbings: embrace it so look if you're if your SDRs are going to quit because of AI they're going to quit
[00:43:51] Harry Stebbings: anyway and the tenure of an a an SDR is very short just be clear we need everybody that can perform
[00:43:57] Harry Stebbings: and it was funny we were sitting there at lunch and with with the SDRs and one of them was one of
[00:44:02] Harry Stebbings: the best ones on on on Marshall's team on sitting next to her she's already got her laptop up she's
[00:44:06] Harry Stebbings: she's scanning a salon that she's doing outbound to during lunch okay she's literally doing
[00:44:11] Harry Stebbings: true outbound research during lunch she's got a job forever the SDRs that just want to run random
[00:44:19] Harry Stebbings: emails and never learn the product don't so I think this is not we're past the point where you've
[00:44:24] Harry Stebbings: got to worry about sharing the team be kind make sure that everyone that crushes it be clear to
[00:44:30] Harry Stebbings: the tip folks that everyone that crushes it has a role this is the thing you need everyone that
[00:44:34] Harry Stebbings: is a tier on your team that hasn't changed and it's even harder to find the a tier folks but if
[00:44:39] Harry Stebbings: folks don't want to adapt they won't have a future and I think you're better off being being
[00:44:43] Harry Stebbings: straightforward with them so just do it bite it off and here's the other thing so many folks have
[00:44:48] Harry Stebbings: learned we've learned it it here's the other thing it reads and it doesn't matter as soon as you
[00:44:51] Harry Stebbings: actually roll out the tool someone's going to quit this is with every company I've invested in
[00:44:57] Harry Stebbings: has had the same story even at Sassar on our little team we rolled out a tool called momentum for
[00:45:04] Harry Stebbings: AI or from attention they're great too even our little team the day we rolled it out someone on
[00:45:09] Harry Stebbings: our sales team quit the day we rolled it out why because now all all his actions all his data we're
[00:45:15] Harry Stebbings: going to show up in real time in a report and in Salesforce you couldn't hide you couldn't pretend
[00:45:19] Harry Stebbings: you were did five calls this day when you didn't you couldn't pretend you did I many many stories
[00:45:24] Harry Stebbings: when you were all this tool somebody quits it's all for the best it's the truth is it's all for the
[00:45:28] Harry Stebbings: best we got to get out of kumbaya land because this is a world this is a new high growth world you
[00:45:34] Harry Stebbings: got to be a part of it yeah really a question how much should we be estimating for cost to invest
[00:45:43] SPEAKER_00: per year in AI to get started it's a good question yeah okay what's the cost listen it's a great
[00:45:50] Harry Stebbings: question and I think it's even better than it sounds I've written this up we Sassar is tiny but here's
[00:45:59] Harry Stebbings: here's kind of a I'm gonna write a longer article on this next week we spend maybe $10,000 a year
[00:46:04] Harry Stebbings: on Salesforce because we're a tiny team maybe maybe we spend a little more and I've been a Salesforce
[00:46:07] Harry Stebbings: customer good God for 20 years guys since I was 16 I've been a Salesforce customer for 20 years
[00:46:15] first first piece of sass app I ever purchased for real I never paid for anything before Salesforce
[00:46:21] and but we spend maybe 10 grand notionally notionally we spend $500,000 on our AI agents across these
[00:46:29] Harry Stebbings: these 21 agents 500,000 think about that ratio for a minute there's so many learnings in that ratio
[00:46:36] Harry Stebbings: there's so many learnings in that ratio it's why Salesforce has to own agent force they have to win
[00:46:41] Harry Stebbings: it's why HubSpot has to win here okay but we are spending far more on agents than we are on CRM so
[00:46:47] Harry Stebbings: that's that's a meta thing to think about the second thing to think about is these apps that
[00:46:52] Harry Stebbings: need to be trained with forward deployed engineers and work I don't think very many of them are less
[00:46:58] Harry Stebbings: than 30 or $50,000 a year and a lot of them actually try to kind of have a price point that's
[00:47:04] Harry Stebbings: approaching a hundred K like 60K a year base base and then 20 or 30K they want you to pay for the
[00:47:11] Harry Stebbings: forward deploy engineer and the training sometimes they include it sometimes they charge for it it's
[00:47:15] Harry Stebbings: whether they do or don't it ain't free to do it right for me I would certainly subsidize it if
[00:47:20] Harry Stebbings: I were a vendor but it costs that amount like having a really great technical resource help you
[00:47:25] Harry Stebbings: train your AI for a couple weeks that ain't free it's pretty pretty damn expensive so and this
[00:47:32] Harry Stebbings: relates the meta issue you've got to invest the time and there's a reason these apps cost 50 to
[00:47:37] Harry Stebbings: 100K they are a lot of money for you be wary of super cheap apps be wary of super cheap stuff it's
[00:47:43] Harry Stebbings: not that we're not getting there it's not that everything isn't going to get better but it's
[00:47:47] Harry Stebbings: you can't cut the corner on training so if instead of 50 grand a year you're buying a solution that's
[00:47:53] Harry Stebbings: that's $500 a month they're $50 a month I'm not saying it's not going to work but you're going
[00:47:58] Harry Stebbings: to have to do even more training you're like you better take on a massive amount of burden to train
[00:48:02] Harry Stebbings: this app because you're not getting the benefit of the forward deployed engineers and all the training
[00:48:07] Harry Stebbings: the tuning the warming and everything the vendor does there's no shortcut here there is no shortcut
[00:48:11] Harry Stebbings: here so it is it is an existential issue that this will change over time but right now the agents
[00:48:17] Harry Stebbings: just can't train the agents themselves the way an FDE does so it's it's tough to get away for
[00:48:22] Harry Stebbings: less than 30 40 50K for any of these tools really when a month of training is required at least several weeks
[00:48:31] all right so thanks everybody and we'll we'll keep this conversation going and let's go learn from
[00:48:36] Harry Stebbings: snowflake thanks guys
