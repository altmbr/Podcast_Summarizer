[00:00:00] Welcome to the official Saster Podcast where you can hear some of the best Saster speakers.
[00:00:06] Jason Lemkin: This is Or the Cloud Means.
[00:00:08] Up today on the Saster Podcast, all these agents are getting better. We have 20 in production.
[00:00:14] Here's the thing. This includes Repplet, this includes Opus, this includes Agent Force,
[00:00:20] Jason Lemkin: and Artisan, and qualified all the tools we love to death.
[00:00:24] They automate a lot of stuff. Like they might even automate 95% of what you used to need a team to do.
[00:00:31] Jason Lemkin: They don't automate everything. Here's the problem.
[00:00:35] As great as these tools are, they do not enable lazy marketing.
[00:00:39] Jason Lemkin: What they enable is better marketing and much more of it.
[00:00:45] Jason Lemkin: Everyone wants an autopilot. Everyone wants to buy a tool and disappear. It does not work that way.
[00:00:51] No, you can have crappy output. You can have crappy LinkedIn posts.
[00:00:58] Everybody at Saster connect data, automate, busy work, and empower teams like nobody's business with the one platform that grows with you.
[00:01:06] Jason Lemkin: Every step of the way. Learn how Salesforce works for startups at Salesforce.com slash SMB. That's Salesforce.com slash SMB.
[00:01:19] Hey, Saster, imagine having agents for every support tab. One that triage is tickets. Another that catches duplicates. One that spots churn risk.
[00:01:27] Unknown Host: That'd be pretty maithly right? Happy Fox just made it real with autopilot. These pre-built AI agents deploying about 60 seconds and run for as low as 2 cents per successful action.
[00:01:37] Unknown Host: All of it sits inside the Happy Fox Omnichannel AI First supports tech. Chatbot, CoPilot, and autopilot working as one.
[00:01:45] Unknown Host: Check them out at happy Fox.com slash Saster.
[00:01:53] So thanks all for joining us here. We thought we would do a part two to what we started last week.
[00:02:00] If you didn't see it last week, that's okay. We'll cover some of it here and do a refresher.
[00:02:05] We primarily focused on sales and specifically outbound all of our AISDR agents.
[00:02:11] Unknown Host: So what I thought we would do today is start with marketing and then we'll kind of circle back to a few things we didn't get to and broader go to market.
[00:02:19] Unknown Host: Just in what's working now for us at least as our AIS running our go to market teams and we have more agents than people here at Saster.
[00:02:30] Unknown Host: So thought we would go through that sort there. One thing all breakfast for everyone.
[00:02:36] If you haven't seen this yet or you missed this last time, if you do go on saster.ai slash agents, this will reference a lot of the things we talked about last week.
[00:02:47] In the two parts for go to market. So this is our each and arsenal as it says a lot of these tools are, you know, third party tools.
[00:02:55] Unknown Host: Some of them have a little bit of proprietary stuff in them. There's the proprietary absolute vibe coated.
[00:03:01] Unknown Host: And this has the whole guide there. So if you're looking for like certain tools we message or drop in or show screenshots of.
[00:03:08] Unknown Host: And you are for back to them. They're all there just to make it easy for you. So with that.
[00:03:14] Unknown Host: Let's type into marketing a bit just because we didn't get to it. And I feel like it's a.
[00:03:22] Unknown Host: It's an important topic and before we get more tactical with it, since we have a little bit of time, Jason, want to get your thoughts on what you're seeing here as well.
[00:03:30] I. This is a study I referenced last week as well. This is from.
[00:03:36] Unknown Host: Rory and skill venture partners is a state of AI go to market.
[00:03:41] Study that just came out. It's pretty good one. I wanted to call it a few things in marketing. I think they're interesting to me slash us.
[00:03:48] Because I feel like for marketing in particular.
[00:03:51] Unknown Host: Folks seem to be more behind than they are in sales or support.
[00:03:55] Unknown Host: I actually anecdotally don't know why that is. I don't think it's because they're the lack of tools, which a lot of folks will point to.
[00:04:03] Unknown Host: I don't think that as you'll see in our next few slides, there's plenty of tools we're using in marketing and that are working well.
[00:04:09] Unknown Host: So I think it's just a little bit interesting here to see the data that most folks are just using AI in marketing.
[00:04:16] Unknown Host: I think that's the first thing is messaging. Okay, fine, but that's everyone's done that right.
[00:04:22] Unknown Host: To be tea during research. I feel like that's a little bit more in the week. Maybe a little bit more specialized.
[00:04:29] Unknown Host: But most people have not done these face what they're calling phase two use cases, which is actually analyzing marketing, campaign data and spend.
[00:04:38] Unknown Host: Whether it's in house or with third party agencies, actually using it to be creative.
[00:04:44] Unknown Host: I don't know where this stigma has come from, but that the AI is not that creative or that all the AI content comes out the same.
[00:04:52] Unknown Host: I feel like those are also two schools of thoughts that we've kind of myth busted on.
[00:04:58] Unknown Host: And then for things like enriching and scoring. So as we talked about a lot last week and just how we're running some of our go to market through these agents with sales in particular, a lot of that is still relevant to marketing.
[00:05:09] Unknown Host: I think that's maybe a conversation we can have at the end of what does this all mean for the two separately and then together, but I think it's something where so many of these platforms and AI, maybe they were built for sales, but you can actually use for marketing, which I'll show.
[00:05:25] Unknown Host: So let me show you guys a few things of what we mean and then we can dive into it a bit more on what this might mean for you all.
[00:05:34] Unknown Host: I would say right now in marketing, we have the most specialized stack and what I mean by that is that we have the most amount of tools in marketing, maybe that we have for sales.
[00:05:43] Unknown Host: A lot of our agents that we deployed in sales, I'm able to deploy multiple agents on single platforms. And so that's up the lock in terms of like how we train into all the agents has been different in each of those platforms and each of those single instances.
[00:05:58] Unknown Host: But I'd say for marketing, we probably have the most specialized stack right now, we have hyper focus tools that do one thing really well.
[00:06:08] Unknown Host: And so in this, it's been a little bit of trial and error of us trying to find, you know, what are the very best ones out there.
[00:06:17] And then not only which ones are the very best ones out there, but which ones will we actually stick with using and also use for actual go to market rail.
[00:06:27] Unknown Host: Which ones are just okay, we kind of have fun later on for the weekend on and then never used again, which ones do we actually do now in our day today.
[00:06:36] So there's two, I think that had become core for us.
[00:06:40] It's both from a, this one's both a sales and marketing perspective, but I've used it for both these cases.
[00:06:46] Unknown Host: This is a really great one at making collateral. So just go to market collateral, whether that sales collateral, marketing collateral, the two apps we use them most right now are going to be gamma and weave.
[00:06:58] Unknown Host: I think the next slide is Higgs field. We use those a lot heavily.
[00:07:03] I put these this slide here.
[00:07:06] This is an actual thigh. I sent it.
[00:07:09] But this is a custom. You'll see died picked this like as I have a few custom photos on it.
[00:07:16] Unknown Host: The photos were made by reef. So where you see these guys like live coding outside. I told read, you know, hey, I'm thinking about doing like a vibe, putting camp or something by putting land.
[00:07:27] Unknown Host: It also came up with that name for me.
[00:07:29] Unknown Host: I'm a vibe coding lab at Sassar annual next year. This is basically a pitch. I wanted to do with our marketing team.
[00:07:35] I gave it actual photos of Sassar annual is like, here's what our setup looks like. Here's what the tents look like outside.
[00:07:41] Unknown Host: Here's what people, you know, kind of look like in Sassar. So just see you have the a grounding, I would say for the agent to know what to.
[00:07:50] Output on that also will help it not be as generic. I feel like we're reed kind of kicks butt over nano banana or some of the other or, you know, chat, LGBT or Sora is.
[00:08:03] Unknown Host: You can upload an image to those and I feel like most people are just deeply themselves or maybe a picture version of themselves.
[00:08:09] Unknown Host: Reva is really good at doing mockups. Like it. I don't think it was intended to be a superpower. It's really good at doing stuff like this where like I used to have to have to have a desire.
[00:08:20] Unknown Host: Can you do a quick mock up of, you know, the rep let logo in its head kind of make it look real like people are sitting in it.
[00:08:27] Unknown Host: One that takes really long on a manual desire to do it too because I gave it reference images. Reva's part like this was a first shot image.
[00:08:35] Unknown Host: Like that one's pretty good. I was like, I like that one. It looks like our tent that we have outside. There's people but they're vied coating on the screens. I told it make sure they're vied coating on the screen.
[00:08:46] Unknown Host: And so that's pretty cool. And so I had it do a couple more. Is it okay. What are other things I want to conceptualize for this potential space that replicas going to do it Sassar.
[00:08:54] Unknown Host: I wanted to be an exclusive footprint. So it came up with this, you know, here's a rest of the outdoor tent with the rep let logo.
[00:09:01] Unknown Host: I did orange umbrella's because it pitched that from their brand colors. That's prevalent in the logo. Is it okay. Now the last thing I want is I want to include some sort of like outdoor stage and space.
[00:09:11] Unknown Host: I gave it photos of past out for stages we had with speakers on it and came up with this and I was like, cool. I actually think it kind of crushed it on these mocks.
[00:09:21] Unknown Host: I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. And it's just such a way in which like when I started presenting this to the replete and they're like, that's cool. Like they can visualize that they can see it.
[00:09:32] Yeah. Yeah. Just add the inside tip for guys that might not, you know, for Reeve.art. It is a team that built their own image LLM's. It's not the same stuff. Everyone else uses, you know, there's a variety that they might use.
[00:09:46] Jason Lemkin: So when you know, when you build, when you build a lot of images and they all look like cartoons or they look silly or they look goofy. It's not your only asset for B2B. Try Reeve uploads something that's similar what you want in plain English tell what you want.
[00:09:59] Jason Lemkin: I think for B2B use cases for real business. The 95% chance is going to be much better than what you get at a chat.
[00:10:05] Jason Lemkin: I started using this. I told them you'll use it. She didn't. And then it's just this is the kind of real stuff that you want not goofy cartoon looking stuff or I mean that as its place if you want to be fun.
[00:10:17] Jason Lemkin: But for B2B use this and it's going to crush like this looks real. It looks great. There's no excuse for those for that goofy cartoon stuff unless that's what you wanted. I don't think.
[00:10:26] The world is move past that for B2B. You don't have to settle for crappy text which we'll talk to you and you don't have to settle for cartoon images.
[00:10:34] You in fact should create great pitches for your prospects. Yeah.
[00:10:39] Yeah, so I held this one came out in this use case was I.
[00:10:44] Unknown Host: Yeah, we've obviously had this journey with reflect but then I started to get another marketing team to do on the marketing.
[00:10:50] Unknown Host: And so they're a sponsor for a little bit of that already but we wanted to they were like we want to do something bigger probably something custom at staff's to annual.
[00:10:58] Unknown Host: And so we started thinking of this vibe coding lab thing.
[00:11:02] Unknown Host: I would say Reeve also is best at you can this logo I gave it that logo right like sometimes when you put it in the other generators or LLM.
[00:11:10] Unknown Host: It will come up with a logo or it will change their logo.
[00:11:14] Unknown Host: Reeve I think kind of quietly crushes it at the text being at a few upload logos it keeps the logos.
[00:11:22] So that's one where I to Jason's part I really like the professional list of them of it it looks polished right.
[00:11:29] So this is something that I think is tendable to folks.
[00:11:33] I like it for that use case another one is which is related to marketing you know we're doing all these assets first after London in a 10 days or whatever.
[00:11:43] And I put in to read like my original concepts of OK here's what I'm kind of thinking for all the stages you know we need like some backdrops we need a bunch of signage.
[00:11:53] And I had re give me all these different outputs are like now that one looks to try that one is too over done that was too boring.
[00:12:00] Unknown Host: It's really good for storyboarding which I feel like it's a good superpower of it too because it's going to generate all these really realistic images.
[00:12:07] Unknown Host: I give it images of past London events like I gave it the venue I give photos of the venue like it can actually help you picture and visualize and storyboard what you want.
[00:12:16] Unknown Host: And so when I started going through that process and made this really cool like portal looking bang out like what like that like that plus the soundstray I live a pretty second.
[00:12:25] Unknown Host: So then we actually we ended up I have skilled it in.
[00:12:29] Unknown Host: I don't we photoshop as a little bit of AI so you can take it out of rive if it's you know it's fine enough digital quality but if you're doing anything print you do need to have usually higher quality higher dpi.
[00:12:42] And so I put it into photoshop upcyled it gave it to our designer as a 4k asset all generated in rive and I was like this is the portal you know clean it up add sounds to AI and we got a pretty sick look in brand.
[00:12:56] That is also another great use case more specifically for marketing kind of related to events but you guys might even if you have a small band this is a good way to kind of quietly you know up level it as well and make it look more polished and better.
[00:13:08] You can use it I've used it in emails right obviously image generation for emails that were sending out.
[00:13:14] Unknown Host: But just go to market if you want to be more you know tactical we're using it here for both sales and marketing collateral that we're using to drive revenue so it is something that works really well I then plug to the group images into gamma.
[00:13:28] Gamma if you don't know it is a it's a I want to say newer if stole that does.
[00:13:36] Content creation specifically presentations so like you might say I can do a presentation can but yeah you can and like I've done both I run test and both side by side usually the gammas are just a bit better especially for beta.
[00:13:49] Unknown Host: To see yeah sorry for beta b rather than be to see like canva is.
[00:13:54] The decks come out a little bit better you can give it things like again like I gave it replettes or in gigantic.
[00:14:00] There I was like.
[00:14:03] Unknown Host: Check their website for funds that you should use also look at how they talk about themselves because you can give it the content you want but you can also prompt it usually they output is pretty good.
[00:14:14] And so I like gamma a lot because we use it now to send all of our like sales collateral sales deck support decks with gamma.
[00:14:23] It's easy they're also easily shareable so between the two tools together you know you'll have to still customize the two like I use all the investigations out of gamma.
[00:14:35] I prefer like gamma has built in immigration and I obviously still prefer like the rev images or ones that we have.
[00:14:43] That are actually like real images like she's like we still pick and choose which one for better so that's what I mean like our marketing stack is probably the most specialized.
[00:14:52] Unknown Host: But it does help eliminate a lot of bottleneck and deals like goals right you're getting them something polish you're not waiting.
[00:14:58] Unknown Host: You know a week for your designer to come in and do this.
[00:15:02] Personalized acts like feel like just a list it a much better conversation or response from folks like this also not only can this kind of up level your deck so you can also send them to more people is what I found like we started sending these to pretty much everyone really we used to not do that we used to be like here's one set deck we have.
[00:15:20] Unknown Host: Or faster you're interested in sponsoring here's the one deck sometimes you know that's the best thing for teams to pass around when they like it we're considering opting into this or if you're trying to go to market with something.
[00:15:33] More so on the marketing side it's again it's not clean it's on spolished to sure like one am said that's more generalized obviously versus something that type of personalized to that you've obviously that you've listened to their names but using the AI you can kind of scale that up a bit more so that you can have.
[00:15:49] Unknown Host: This sounds across it looked a lot better you don't even agency to do this and then they can share it internally so I if you use it directly in the Amazon versus exporting it to the PDF or Google slides it'll tell you whatever you will be it so I'll get things all the time you know random explain to the person at that spicy company.
[00:16:07] Unknown Host: Do this deck I'm like yeah I didn't send it to them but they're at the company and they're always like sharing the surround.
[00:16:12] Unknown Host: So I think that's what you want is you want to use this to not only improve your current processes of having these things but also just to unlock me one so that you can do it a more hyper personalized.
[00:16:24] Unknown Host: And for folks that I mean gamma got a lot of we've been using it for a long time to got a lot of press recently they just said they crossed a hundred million air this year.
[00:16:32] Jason Lemkin: And raise around it to billion so a lot of press but I've actually found I we've been promoting gamma for a long time because we use it a lot of folks they may even talk about it they've never used it literally.
[00:16:42] Jason Lemkin: I was at the other day at an event with the CEO of a public SAS company say I gamma it's just PowerPoint and no one will ever use that I'm like you know they're going to get a hundred million my friend there's something there but here's the tip okay.
[00:16:56] Jason Lemkin: Most of you haven't used reef dot art for images it's all on sass or diatons go.
[00:17:01] Jason Lemkin: Upload something that you use and just ask it to make it better I bet you're going to find this is your best tool for gamma if you haven't used it don't over complicate this literally go into Google Doc right five bullets of what you want to deck to be okay take those five bullets put it in the free version of gamma and watch it build the deck for you I bet it's the best thing you've seen okay you can use it you can make a template you use again and again which amulet.
[00:17:25] Jason Lemkin: And then upload it dynamically with data become an agent expert but that could be intimidating for folks if you haven't used it don't over complicated take five bullets on anything that you're doing give it to gamma and watch the agent build a deck for you it's pretty awesome and then if you get excited about that go deeper like we have and then you can make dynamic decks for everybody for real not the same crappy static decks everyone else get but you can start really simple with these tools they don't have to be intimidating and I think your job will drop for both if you invest like five minutes.
[00:17:54] Jason Lemkin: Keep it simple invest five minutes yeah.
[00:17:59] Okay let me go to the next one in terms of content add automation so we have a lot of the choice tool in this bucket you saw one of the previous
[00:18:14] Unknown Host: is where most folks are using AI in their marketing stack I would say I don't think it's necessarily bad thing that these are all specialized again like the way that I use gamma and reaped together it's like it only takes I would say six seconds for
[00:18:33] Unknown Host: to generate an image and reaped versus during a native brain gamma that a lot better my opinion comes out a bit more customized and I ported over so I don't
[00:18:43] Unknown Host: I don't think you should be scared by the amount of tools on this one slide we do picking shoes like the very best things and outputs and also a lot of these are off the shelf so I would say for particularly in marketing and how we're using the sex so far I think the next one is
[00:19:00] Unknown Host: what are more like enterprise tools and solutions is you know these are all off the shelf to like cloud repplet repexfield recall which we use for all for content opus we're adding was a video like these are ones where they're like you know user
[00:19:15] Unknown Host: subscription like anybody on your team slash yourself could just go set up you know whatever 20 to 30 bucks a month or 10 to 30 bucks a month and try these tools and see which ones work for you.
[00:19:27] So I think what's working well for us now is yes obviously we do use it for over a lot of content that's after and prior to this that was a lot of Jason and my day was writing content it's so large face and say it's still a lot of our time but now the agents.
[00:19:46] Unknown Host: I don't want me to speak for you Jason but I do feel like with this agent makes you have specifically in content creation you get there a lot faster so you're able to post like more advice to folks.
[00:19:57] Yeah I would say what we've been able to do is triple our content output with AI I think that and I think the mistake a lot of folks make is they use a lot of crappy social media tools that regurgitate content again so they want thought leadership so they spool up a tool.
[00:20:15] Jason Lemkin: It examines someone else's feed it off an examines my feed I see folks be writing my content and it sort of works because LLM's are good at copying and regurgitating so if you just want views I guess if you think that's going to move the needle for your business then generic AI tools are fine okay but what we do which is the real powerful thing is mid as you architect the content you create the content our videos our sessions our posts our ideas.
[00:20:45] Jason Lemkin: And use AI to turbo charge it to do more research for you to go deep dive you know we used to that's what you really want to do is to is for AI to be your steroids for content creation not to create the core nucleus that becomes right and boring but that's how we've tripled it.
[00:21:02] Jason Lemkin: I I write all that if you've read saster for a long time I've written most of the content for more than a decade okay but if you compare an article today this year versus two years ago.
[00:21:13] Jason Lemkin: You'll see that it's pretty similar but there's a lot more data I can do a lot more research I can call it it's not just asking cloud to do the research I can take multiple articles three or four articles off the internet.
[00:21:24] Jason Lemkin: For example today just before this I wrote an article on how venture capital has changed for funds I took two different data sources one from crunch race and one from an LP an investor in top funds called venrock the analyze 1900 funds and I added that data to my post okay I added that data with AI.
[00:21:42] Jason Lemkin: And it makes it so much better you've got to check the work it does take a few minutes but I can let you take great ideas and make them 10 times better that's where you get get the leverage.
[00:21:53] Yep.
[00:21:55] I would say you just want to say we do use a few different tools here they'll work fairly well but yet to to that point right we are using it to amplify existing content that we have or or even build up on that content like one thing I did for
[00:22:10] Unknown Host: this webinar actually for last six and this week is I gave it the last three or four sessions that we had done on the topic of AI our agents up and into cloud because I thought it's not better.
[00:22:24] Unknown Host: I was like hey, even what we've already covered I don't want to keep regurgitating things like I want to show data and plan did not have my data and I would like these are screenshots I took I put these slides together but it gave me a pretty good outline it was like okay based on the data.
[00:22:40] Unknown Host: The last few talks you guys have done based on what you have coming up based on where you're at the six month mark or why think you should cover that is like sass or style actionable content so give me a really good outline.
[00:22:52] It gave me this out like this format of you should go into each of the different segments of go to market we should talk about what's working on what's on on each line you should call out the tools.
[00:23:04] Unknown Host: It gave me ideas on like okay here maybe some answer like it would ask me like hey is this what's working as well as working like then maybe show this like that like and so it gave me a really good it was like a really good co pilot for me on like just putting my thoughts together because obviously now that we're doing a part two I think I have a lot we could cover and go on.
[00:23:24] Unknown Host: About AI and go to market but I want to try and make it super tactical it's for folks so that it's helpful and useful and it was really good for holding that and it was like I was like what about this top it was like no like that could be a throw coffee don't go to my dross the engines.
[00:23:39] Unknown Host: And so yeah it's gone I would say really good at that so I'll do this outline and then I obviously did I you know I still wrote all the slides and so the I did use the end of it and then I pulled all of our screenshots in of our data.
[00:23:54] And but now I'm also using it for the some of the stuff we're going to do and London just again I'm going to give it this one after today I give it laughing I'm like okay now build on it again knowing that you know some people I audience would have seen these two.
[00:24:07] Unknown Host: Tastra AI lives and some people wouldn't have.
[00:24:10] But also make it shorter because now we're together this will be like the two hour mark him.
[00:24:15] Unknown Host: I think the opener at London's a late 45 minutes of what are the most friable point I should hit on and it's gone pretty good at that so I.
[00:24:24] I think it's great for that to because that saved me a lot of time like it's still took me a while to obviously make this act and put all the points together for you guys and put all screenshots and the data like that that still takes work.
[00:24:36] Unknown Host: But I did help me organize my thoughts a lot more.
[00:24:39] Yep.
[00:24:41] On the content repurposing not to spend.
[00:24:45] Jason Lemkin: I know you hit it a lot of folks especially founders and marketers that are watching or we'll watch later I find we're all generating so much more content these days especially video there's so much more pods there's so much more everything going on and people are not using AI to extend the life of that content there's a lot discussed on it but I see a lot of lazy approaches.
[00:25:08] And let me tell you what we do it's pretty simple Amelia has it on this bullet point opus pro get recall and described.
[00:25:15] Jason Lemkin: I don't think we touched on the first two did we Amelia.
[00:25:19] But okay so you just did you just did a great interview and then you stick it on your YouTube and it disappears okay great I hope it performs.
[00:25:30] Just a few the first ones a little you probably know or you might not the second ones a little more subtle but let me tell you we can do with this content the first one is stick your.
[00:25:39] Jason Lemkin: If you having used opus pro it's on our list on Sasterage and so there's a lot of tools but it's the leading tool for turning your video into clips and listen it can't take boring content it make it great but what opus pros really good is take the YouTube URL.
[00:25:52] Jason Lemkin: Stick give it to opus clip and it will force rank the most compelling content out of that and find you some clips and then it will just actually automatically schedule it for you on your social media accounts on LinkedIn on X on Facebook whatever you want.
[00:26:06] It's pretty good it will take the if you just did a 40 minute webinar it will take the best 60 seconds or 120 seconds clip it and let you put it right on LinkedIn rear customers are you should be doing this and you can queue up five six eight ten of those over the course of the month you should be doing this.
[00:26:22] Jason Lemkin: You're doing that with your best content or you're kind of wasting it how does it great it uses AI it's pretty amazing and it is there's a free version like trot this is another one you can literally try in five minutes take your you take your YouTube URL and stick it in opus pro and see it it extracts the text which is actually very easy to do you actually YouTube gives you the tax to the API it's not that complicated and then it just runs that text through some LLM I don't even know what it is and says find me the best parts when opus first launched.
[00:26:50] Free I don't know we were using it in sass or London a year to have to go like magical like how does it do this how does it find the best clips this seemed like the most magical to actually invest in the company it was so magical it still is magical but it's let now that I understand how I works better today with our agents is less magical and I thought extract text it's not much like these videos the even if it's two hours it's not a lot of text it's not much for the LMS to process give it to the LLM and say break it up into the best two minute chunks it works really well.
[00:27:18] And then just it then it just says hook in your LinkedIn account, hooking your Twitter account and it just does it all for you it's magical so you're wasting your content if you don't do this.
[00:27:28] You can also ask it to make three minute clips which we do to if you have a little more energy you can put those three minute clips on accident linked in like the best ones for deeper dives you'll see saster do that all the time you'll see these three or four minute clips.
[00:27:40] Jason Lemkin: I don't have time to make it opus makes it for us like it's really good okay so what's the next so that's how you turn your video into clips in short thing just do.
[00:27:48] Jason Lemkin: It opus is like there's a free version or it's 20 bucks a month or five bucks a month for the paid but you can try it free then we use an app very few people use called get recall there's actually two apps called recall one does like transcription I don't know what one is an API tons of folks use the set founders it's
[00:28:04] Jason Lemkin: aster and you'll got a ton of customers out of it's an API get recall actually just transcribes your whole internet world with AI like everyone should be using this it's just a niche app it'll do everything I use it for one thing I give it that
[00:28:16] Jason Lemkin: you're off of the YouTube and it instantly gives me great summarized text and then instead of opus doing its own thing I take that text and I put it into
[00:28:26] Jason Lemkin: quad and I tell it the type of article I want to write out of the content this is really powerful okay so literally we're doing this hour long
[00:28:33] Jason Lemkin: when but are right now okay when it's done I will grab the YouTube URL and I'll go to get recall and give it to it and I'll get the
[00:28:41] Jason Lemkin: text and I'll put it in quad and let's say I only want to write a saster post on content repurposing I will take the transcript of this
[00:28:49] Jason Lemkin: session and say quad write me a saster post just on what a million I said on content repurposing and then it can write an article just
[00:28:57] Jason Lemkin: on that now of course you've got to edit it a little bit but it's going to be pretty good this is and literally if we wanted to we
[00:29:03] Jason Lemkin: could take this session and turn it into five or six articles by getting the text from it from get recall and YouTube and then just
[00:29:10] Jason Lemkin: asking cloud to write five or six great articles out of it this will be better than the crummy agency you asked to write a bunch of crappy
[00:29:17] Jason Lemkin: articles take your own content we watch that if you have something great from your own events digital events were old events find the three or four
[00:29:25] Jason Lemkin: great things from it and write articles just about those three or four things with the extracted text and clawed it will be great like it will be
[00:29:33] Jason Lemkin: great and this will turn you can get 10 great clips out of your content but actually you can get five or six great articles if it's
[00:29:40] Jason Lemkin: a really good piece of content don't waste that great interview don't waste that the best keynote you had don't waste the best session from
[00:29:50] from an event you just had it's just a waste right I mean no like criticism no criticism I just did this great digital day with G2 we
[00:29:57] Jason Lemkin: did it got her and I did it with the sea of Zendesk okay it was so good now they've decided to hide it behind some
[00:30:05] Jason Lemkin: wisdom we do love with the its asterisans ourselves would hide it behind a
[00:30:09] link wall to capture email addresses I guess maybe that's the right thing to do but because I know so much about AI for support I asked the
[00:30:19] Jason Lemkin: sea of Zendesk so many great things I could write five articles out of that piece of content we talked about pricing for AI for support we talked
[00:30:27] Jason Lemkin: about how difficult it is to train AI agents and so how to simplify that that could be like four different articles that G2 and I if
[00:30:34] Jason Lemkin: anyone from G2 wants to help what we'll do the work we could create five great pieces out of that interview instead of it like just disappear into the ether
[00:30:47] the other thing I think I was good I was you were chatting through all this was the a few bucks are asking questions related to if there's a way to do this more
[00:30:58] Unknown Host: programmatically in the chat I think you guys mean if we're using you know all like Jason for this list of choices content example you just get is there a way you can do that
[00:31:09] Unknown Host: automatically or are you doing that manually now do which part man you know are you is there there's no way right now to automate like opus grabbing or
[00:31:19] Unknown Host: recall gravity to automatically it's a great question all these agents are getting better we have 20 in production here's the thing this includes
[00:31:28] Jason Lemkin: wrap it this includes opus this includes agent force and artisan and qualified all the tools we love to death
[00:31:36] they automate a lot of stuff like they might even automate 95% of what you used to need a team to do they don't automate everything here's the problem
[00:31:47] as great as these tools are they do not enable lazy marketing what they enable is better marketing and much more of it everyone wants an autopilot everyone wants to buy a tool and disappear it does not work that way
[00:32:03] Jason Lemkin: you know you can have crappy output you can have crappy linked in post again where I started none of this is full automation you can automate 95% but even me listen I'm not like you know I'm though I didn't found a lovable or
[00:32:16] Jason Lemkin: cursor but I'm a somewhat successful founder I'm still doing this myself at this point of my career I'm not I'm getting lots of help so much more productive but I still have you know I this term
[00:32:28] Jason Lemkin: maybe is overused I'm still orchestrating these agents and Amelia still orchestrating her agents so if you can't put in 20 or 30 minutes a day to do this don't start the project okay if you want to do nothing we can't help you
[00:32:42] Jason Lemkin: if you want to invest 20 or 30 minutes of actually kind of fun stuff I mean the stuff is fun these tools are magical if you want to invest 20 30 minutes a day so that you could have massive output use this playbook but there's nothing you can just click and forget
[00:32:56] there is but it's not going to be good enough if you're not going to read the text if you're not going to decide how to take that interview with the CEO of Zendesk and turn it into five posts it's not going to be great it's going to be generic
[00:33:09] yeah there's a few questions may on on how we're using it and maybe more so for things like market and automation style email so I'll go to the next slide
[00:33:18] Unknown Host: when it comes to email marketing I am full disclosure using sales goals to check the books if I'm marketing
[00:33:27] Unknown Host: in our TTM now in November of 2025 or whenever you're listening to this once there is a truly great all-in-one AI marketing platform I will try it I will use it but it doesn't exist yet so I have just come up the existing sales tool to use them for marketing but with fairly good result now what we're not able to automate yet but we actually are starting to get there and start
[00:33:57] Unknown Host: starting to kind of like the likely prototype things and reflet is I haven't solved for automating our newsletter like we do these four to five newsletters a week on you know it aggregates all the sassure content it's all this really great original content that you're seeing us out putting here we put it the newsletter all of
[00:34:15] Unknown Host: all of you can start a full everything we're writing up on AI you know our to our agents page everything in Marcos of those newsletters we're still doing that manually for all of us purposes so even in today six months down our AI journey I haven't found something truly great to automate that process I don't think it exists yet but if you don't one we should try drop it there's still a gap there's still a gap yeah there's a lot of
[00:34:42] Jason Lemkin: automating making those emails the our newsletter is great isn't yet AI a bowl completely we can come back to that it's not we'll come back to this the next time we do this yeah so we it's like early we on saster dot AI our new platform you can
[00:35:03] Jason Lemkin: actually sign up for a different newsletter an automated newsletter that shows you stock quotes and news all across AI and the web and everything that one is fully automated and custom.
[00:35:13] Jason Lemkin: So I can see into the future like it can do things our tools can't for example it extracts the latest saster video like the minute we're off this one it will go into that automated newsletter with no work that's so cool and it will figure out what the best articles are on saster today which AI is good at and customize it to the newsletter
[00:35:33] Jason Lemkin: but the full voice that immediately does the newsletter where we exerted and we talk about those learnings that we make a personal AI is not there yet today but I wouldn't be surprised we I think we'll find a tool sometime in the next three or four months.
[00:35:47] That is somewhere in the middle that it can extract enough stuff that if you're not doing good newsletters it's much better than nothing right because we do have these automated ones on the side.
[00:35:57] But it's not there yet it is what is interesting on marketing as you dig in as you'll find so much of the energy and AI is that we see is in coding tools obviously sales tools.
[00:36:11] And like social media tools but a lot of marketing it's still early you think there would be replacements for a lot of things I think there will be next year and there's a lot of startups but as soon as we find something great we'll do the next we'll do the next one with even more tools but right now we're using to in any case these are point tools right and they don't do as much as we'd love them to do and we'll we'll check in 90 days.
[00:36:36] Yep.
[00:36:37] Specifically when it comes to email what I'm doing right now is kind of hacking existing sales tools.
[00:36:45] While we haven't found a way yet to automate the newsletters but where I have found you know some success is actually just hacking the existing AI I'll call them go to market tools even though they're able to sell school to send marketing emails and so that's what I started you know the whatever the practice of you know I think some of them are not there.
[00:37:05] Unknown Host: This is starting to converge and maybe we'll see more of that but also I think we may start to see change and how people interact with emails altogether so it may not matter in the end that it's all kind of undergo to market versus sales e-mails and marketing email I'm already starting to see that.
[00:37:23] I don't actually care anymore that some of these emails that I'm sending for marketing are in sales.
[00:37:28] Unknown Host: I don't care I just think of them as good a market told now and this is where actually this these go to market tools have are pretty good at this because they were built for sales and because they're built to re engage people.
[00:37:41] Because sequences is basically marketing drip campaign so just think about that.
[00:37:46] Unknown Host: If you're doing sequences on an AI tool you can probably do a marketing drip campaign those are the same fundamentals in like how the AI is set up and how you want to set up that incentive.
[00:37:57] Unknown Host: You giving it just you know sales products that you want it to keep sequencing you give it a subset of your marketing contacts and say hey okay these are specific folks maybe I have narrowed them down to you know you can't do everybody in our database now it doesn't really work well.
[00:38:14] And it can't output that quickly depending on how big your database is so ours is really big I can't email and the day that everybody in the database even our 28 today.
[00:38:22] Unknown Host: But what I can do is I can will down some of the folks what I'll do now is like this one that's here this is a screenshot I think from qualified which again qualified is wrong to his purposes sales school.
[00:38:35] But I've been using it for marketing so I'll see in Marquetto because it's also hooked up it's hooked up to our market and it's hooked up to our sales force it will see when people are opening emails and if they reach a certain threshold right now for.
[00:38:49] They've opened a bunch of blood and emails but haven't bought a ticket it will send them this one to one email now i'm also still sending them like you know the email blast of hey sasher London's about to sell out i'm still doing that but i'm using the agent to actually do one to one personalized marketing evil to this person.
[00:39:06] Unknown Host: I don't know where Matthew works I think it says here actually.
[00:39:10] Unknown Host: But this was yeah this kind of called some of that up but okay I noticed you've been exploring content it actually pulled up content that they were reading on sasher.com i didn't tell it to do that it just did that like it contextualized it based on his heart interactions saw what he was reading on sasher.com related to back to his company knew that he was in this campaign where he was opening our London emails but hadn't taken an action and offered him a discount code to sasher.
[00:39:37] This is where I feel like there is a somewhat of a evolution in marketing and a convergence and go to market that why can't you have more specialized emails in marketing like this.
[00:39:49] Unknown Host: Not to replace newsletters not to replace email blast necessarily but to be an added layer because you can get leverage out of AI to have a more customized email to this person once they need a certain criteria and basically I treat these marketing emails again as trip campaigns.
[00:40:06] Unknown Host: And so far they've been working really well this is fairly early days i've put a screen shot here this was like 3000 email that sent.
[00:40:14] In this one campaign just on.
[00:40:18] Qualified that's not counting any of the you know that's not counting them the inbound conversations that had or inbound people it's following up with this is just for this specific campaign of people who met the square area you'll see here open rates fairly high right this is.
[00:40:33] On par with what we've seen in like our agent for some of these people also go into agent for some doing on can a b test right i'm split testing i'm just to see which one works better right now about the same which is great like it's high since they're about the same.
[00:40:47] But we're getting fairly good open rates and then the click through rates will be you know obviously a little bit lower that's fine it's.
[00:40:55] Unknown Host: I don't expect that many replies also on the email it's giving them a link there don't really need to reply if they buy a ticket they have been cool that don't.
[00:41:05] Unknown Host: If they don't talk to me in this interaction we'll talk to my agent that is a okay.
[00:41:11] You know bounce right fairly low so early days on this one because we've just started to add this into the next but.
[00:41:17] This is just such an interesting thing just for all the backbone things of you know it being this is technically a sales tool but you know sales tools can do.
[00:41:27] Really good sequences so why I was like why couldn't it do a really good job campaign if it has all right inputs.
[00:41:33] And so this is where I found kind of a way to fill that gap that Jason was talking about in the meantime in the interim this is what i'm doing right now to.
[00:41:41] Unknown Host: Still get good output and marketing and kind of feel like for them.
[00:41:46] Yeah it is just I want to keep getting through the content for a lot of time but.
[00:41:51] The you're you we hear a lot of folks when we talk about our asterisk saying oh no that's those are marketing tools right.
[00:42:00] The AI is leading to convergence between sales of marketing.
[00:42:04] Jason Lemkin: But in fact it is even leading at some level to convergence between sales marketing and support as the agents can do more.
[00:42:12] Jason Lemkin: They the lines get blurry so today that means Amelia is hacking what
[00:42:18] Jason Lemkin: is nominally a sales tool I guess right to do marketing emails to do personalized marketing emails.
[00:42:24] Jason Lemkin: Instead of a marketing tool that we to the market or HubSpot right that's a hack today.
[00:42:29] Jason Lemkin: It feels like a hack but it won't be a hack next year these will converge and like I do know i've done a lot of investments in the sass side of e-commerce.
[00:42:38] Jason Lemkin: Where there's high volume and already tons of AI and already there there is no difference between sales marketing and support for a variety of reasons.
[00:42:45] Jason Lemkin: So we're going to see the same thing because imagine you want to go buy a necklace and you go to a website.
[00:42:50] Jason Lemkin: You don't want to talk to support versus sales and you and marketing might need to market to you instantly so you get a discount so you don't leave.
[00:42:58] Jason Lemkin: And so these are all blending your skills are going to need to blend and your tools are going to blend so that's a for right now hack the tools that you buy.
[00:43:07] Don't and if it's a sales tool and you think it's marketing or it's marketing you think it's sales that's a new world.
[00:43:14] These lines are kind of get blurry.
[00:43:17] I'll say the interesting thing is to is because it's blurry it's almost better.
[00:43:23] Unknown Host: For the output of it it's actually better for me that some of this is in a what I'm put sales tool now I just call it a market goal.
[00:43:32] Because it already knows all these things right i'm like okay our qualified is there on the website it already knows that like I don't have to be like okay.
[00:43:41] Unknown Host: I have to you know back in the day you took the market a bunch of things on everything to see if they went to your website i'm like.
[00:43:47] Qualifying already goes the origin does that too like.
[00:43:49] Unknown Host: The sales force knows you know an agent force knows everything yourself force knows like you already have all this really great data and you're kind of using these code of market tools that already have again they are built for sales but really can be easily hacked and applied to go to market.
[00:44:07] I actually think it's better i don't mind that it's merging and grudging i think it's leading us to send better marketing emails.
[00:44:15] Again because we're sending so many hyper personalized ones we all have like higher quality conversations with folks to like even when they do reply this one's low obviously artists like art is entire agent work entire our replies.
[00:44:29] Unknown Host: But this one also has a link right so i'm not comparing apples to apples directly because those two are more where we've programmed them where we want them to reply this one gives them a link so they don't necessarily need to reply.
[00:44:40] Unknown Host: But the replies i do get just across the board are just somewhere i repersonalize hyper custom the thing i run into actress and issues i sometimes can't reply to everyone like directly like someone is a little bit like hey i already bought my ticket but what do you think about xvv tool you guys mentioned on the webinar or this or that and like i'll answer one for them they ask you which follow questions i'm like oh no.
[00:44:59] Unknown Host: The real Amelia cannot keep up with all of Amelia's agents and so that's where actually my biggest football is not being able to keep up with all our agents it's not you know again finding the right tools aside and maybe hacking tools for now not the biggest problem we have.
[00:45:18] So that's an interesting nuance too but i don't i actually don't mind if these are converging i think it's for the best i think we'll see it lead to maybe go changes with the marketing where.
[00:45:29] Unknown Host: You mentioned newsletters i would love a really great tool for that, but i also see where you know i'd love a tool actually that.
[00:45:35] In a you know in a six month day I can see this happening of.
[00:45:39] It's a newsletter but it's hyper customized right like why can't a newsletter be one one in the same way that this signals want to one.
[00:45:47] The issue yeah it should be right like the way Jason was actually millions of emails but we should they should be customers.
[00:45:54] They should be yeah okay if you're reading sashtradcom and I see you already read that article i'm not going to put it in your next newsletter like you already saw it i'm going to put something else related to it that's like a follow up one like.
[00:46:04] Unknown Host: That's where I see this all kind of converging and going doesn't quite exist there yet.
[00:46:09] But i'm actually excited for it to get there because I feel like actually will be better to you're truly adding value I feel like this is a good thing.
[00:46:18] Yeah i mean when we have AI for both newsletters and drip marketing that's what you deserve marketing so.
[00:46:24] Jason Lemkin: If we know whatever types of content you've interacted with it's not very difficult for AI to customize the further content of the further campaigns you get.
[00:46:32] Jason Lemkin: Well they there may be tools out there that do it or claim it.
[00:46:35] Jason Lemkin: But the capabilities are limited but it's not hard this should be there soon is your every journey should be customized by AI there's no reason for it not to be in every newsletter should.
[00:46:45] Jason Lemkin: I mean we forget about your drip no one should be sending the same drips even a segment of drip no one should be sending like two or three segments of drips there should be a million drips that draw from all of your content like.
[00:46:56] Jason Lemkin: dynamically and our newsletters we should be sending a million different newsletters not a mill not three different newsletters.
[00:47:03] We know what you like if you're a sales professional maybe you don't want to read about Jason's vibe coding anymore maybe it's driving you nuts.
[00:47:09] Jason Lemkin: If you're really into our AI content maybe you don't want to hear about all the headaches higher into vps cells you just don't care but everyone's getting this mix of content of go to market AI VC funding and we should be smart enough to change all that and then we're all going to see our response rates go way up.
[00:47:27] We're all going to see it go way up.
[00:47:30] We're looking for that one we're in the hunt we're in the hunt for that we're in the hunt for that all there quick.
[00:47:35] i'll do a quick closing thought and then Jason let's hit anything you miss and then we can do some q on a hurt you minutes over.
[00:47:43] This is interesting I was at like a salesperson event yesterday.
[00:47:47] i've been Oakland and just with folks that I was talking to you is you know well and because folks know we have multiple ages down I kind of talked about the story they're like.
[00:47:58] Unknown Host: Are you ever worried that like your agents don't talk to each other and I was like no because even though our stand is hyper personalized and specialized like you just saw like I use qualified for some things artists and brothers are marketing staff we just showed is so disparate of 10 different rule.
[00:48:17] Unknown Host: We have a Jason AI that's still fine we have an Amelia AI that's qualified.
[00:48:24] Unknown Host: i'm literally doing a poison video test with them later I have a London agent i'm rolling out on agent force where you can call it and ask it with sessions to go to that's freaking cool.
[00:48:35] Unknown Host: And so I'm like aren't you worry about these agents won't talk to each other i'm like okay let me give you an example of a shoe example where I had a worse interaction than talking to maybe one to three agents like I had a question.
[00:48:47] Unknown Host: Call Verizon the other day because the life I had the opposite down and the.
[00:48:53] Experience was so horrible.
[00:48:57] I had one I had a call this number there was no chat there was no like AI trouble shooting of hey I saw your you know.
[00:49:06] Unknown Host: Internet's down and I'm logged into my account you should know my internet the are you down by the time I get there.
[00:49:11] And so I got routed to five different people because we had a Verizon for business account and it was specialized and it was.
[00:49:18] I don't know if they help files or whatever and it was you know whatever it was specialized and so I kept getting down to all these different departments and finally I think the screenshot on my phone was like 45 minutes later.
[00:49:31] The guy who eventually came on said but you're there's just an outage in your area so your internet's down I go.
[00:49:38] Unknown Host: Perfect you could have used AI to tell me this one I logged in you could have made the eat on me that there was a shit in my area would have waited 45 minutes on the phone but by putting all that I talked to five different humans and it was a much worse experience than somebody who has bounced between maybe one or two of our agents or at the max maybe three or four of our agents.
[00:50:01] And I will I'll say I know that because in our agents they do point to each other so if you ask our Amelia AI right now for us to ask advice or like how to hire a VP of sales it will kick you back over the.
[00:50:13] Unknown Host: Then if you come back and you're like hey I actually had a question about London she'll remember like Amelia AI or remember that she could you ask the Jameson agent and like just pick up on that conversation.
[00:50:23] Unknown Host: You know it equated to at least I wasn't transferred to a new customer service rep if you go back to if you're kicked back to any of our agent they remember everything like they remember your whole conversation contacts they can see what you're doing and actually get you to the right answer.
[00:50:41] Versus you know being bounced around by humans that's still worse right.

[00:51:09] Let me just tie it together you know the if we're talking about GGM right we don't talk a lot about support but if support is pretty good it can be a great lead capture an opportunity capture tool.
[00:51:23] Jason Lemkin: Qualified you said for example it I mean it does a limited amount of support when you're using that agent it captures leads when it does the same thing right it does the whole thing and so.
[00:51:32] Jason Lemkin: The these agents you know I had to bumps myself I had one with mercury which I love which is a banking product.
[00:51:39] And I did it the other day and it said it would take them a day to respond to my issue now you could criticize that you say why the hell can't you just have.
[00:51:47] Jason Lemkin: An AI agent do the support but that when you have that experience you're missing a chance to capture that leading get someone into your journey.
[00:51:56] If mercury or brex which we both use and appreciate and love if they all take don't really have AI support or can't get back to you add a basic agent like we started with.
