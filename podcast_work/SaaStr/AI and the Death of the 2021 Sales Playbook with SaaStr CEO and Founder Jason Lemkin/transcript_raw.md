[00:00:00] Welcome to the official Saster Podcast where you can hear some of the best Saster speakers.
[00:00:06] This is one of the cloud meets.
[00:00:08] Up today on the Saster Podcast, but the biggest real difference with a lot of AI leaders is
[00:00:16] there's just so much demand, right?
[00:00:19] Because what's happening in a lot of AI tools is everyone is in market simultaneously.
[00:00:24] The tools are either so disruptive like a cursor or a replica or a level of 11 labs will go from almost nothing to 300 million this year.
[00:00:32] And so of course if you have insane demand sometimes with virality it is going to change the playbook because you're going to be servicing it, right?
[00:00:40] And I know, you know, that bolt which is one of the leaders in vibe coding, the head of sales there was one of our old sales team, like the old is new.
[00:00:51] And even there and I know it's true at lovable and replete just as three examples, they have so much inbound they can't service it.
[00:00:59] They have insane demand and servicing but it's the same playbook, it's the same demos, it's the same everything.
[00:01:07] Hey Saster, imagine having agents for every support tab.
[00:01:10] One that triage is tickets, another that catches duplicates, one that spots churn risk.
[00:01:15] That'd be pretty amazing, right? Happy Flash just made it real with Autobiilit.
[00:01:19] These pre-built AI agents deploying about 60 seconds and run for as low as 2 cents per successful action.
[00:01:25] All of it sits inside the Happy Fox Omnichannel AI first support stack, chatbot, co-pilot and Autobiilit working as one.
[00:01:33] Check them out at happybox.com slash saster.
[00:01:39] Hey everybody, Saster Annual will be back May 2026, the world's largest SaaS and AI gathering for executives.
[00:01:47] Just as last May we hosted 10,000 attendees with 68 VP level and above attendees, 36% CEOs and founders and 25% were AI first professionals.
[00:01:57] It's the very best of S tier attendees and decision makers that come to Saster, Annual and AI Summit each and every year.
[00:02:04] But here's the reality folks, the longer you wait the higher ticket prices get, they're cheap now. They're cheap so just get them early.

[00:02:20] See you there, Saster Annual and AI Summit 2026, it will rock.
[00:02:28] All right everybody, welcome back to London. Thanks for coming out.
[00:02:31] Appreciate everybody.
[00:02:34] If you got who's been to a Saster event before anybody here. All right, thank you.
[00:02:41] We have a tradition we're usually at the end of these events.
[00:02:46] Can you send it any wants to hear from me? We do an AMA until we till I pass out.
[00:02:50] But it's inverted this year because of the timing we want to everyone.
[00:02:54] I don't know if you've noticed on your teams, people have shorter attention span sees you at these days.
[00:02:58] Have you noticed it's like keeps getting shorter and shorter.
[00:03:01] So tried to compress everything this year.
[00:03:04] We this is just an AMA we can talk about anything will will take questions in a moment.
[00:03:10] Just for fun.
[00:03:12] We if on the the general topic of like software, cheese and vibe coding.
[00:03:19] Let's see if you're curious. I built a game for this event.
[00:03:24] It's vapor cell dot AI you can play it now.
[00:03:28] The year is 2049 you're an account executive attending Saster AI London.
[00:03:32] The product doesn't exist but the quota is real. You got to play this game.
[00:03:36] I'll take you if you play it. It's just for fun because we can it's kind of a prop for vibe coding.
[00:03:42] But actually if you play it and you win, you get an extra 50% off coming to Saster Annual in May.
[00:03:47] So it's 50% off 50% off. It's the cheapest tickets we've ever had.
[00:03:52] You just have to win.
[00:03:54] You just have to win this game.
[00:03:57] And it's actually you could try it if the fact that I was able to build it in like an hour and a half on rep.
[00:04:04] It is pretty telling it only goes so far it only does so much other things wouldn't work but.
[00:04:11] It's kind of a reminder that if you if you want to rebuild something revive with yourself for your team and it's been built before.
[00:04:18] It does get easier so that's just for fun but but if you if you're bored you can do it here and you get an extra 50% off annual or if you win one person or maybe it's three three people to win it.
[00:04:30] Not that it's such a great prize but I think either one or three people get a one on one with me afterwards too.
[00:04:35] So all you have to do is win the game.
[00:04:38] Trick this trick five prospects and divine from you with some jargon AI jargon and then it'll tell you one and there's a leaderboard so it's vapor cell dot dot AI.
[00:04:50] So that's the agenda for today I got I got nothing for now other than general MA but if anybody wants to kick it off with a general question.
[00:04:59] Therapy whatever you need let me know if anyone's got got something or I can make something up but anyone got a burning question wants to kick us off go ahead.
[00:05:10] So the question is is inbound dead your traffic's down 50% in the last 12 months.
[00:05:17] It's a good question let me step back for for what it's worth I really think this is a part of a a woe is me narrative that I think began toward the end of 23.
[00:05:28] Cell and is accelerated what was you your your SEOs harder what was you you don't have as many leads as you had during a lockdown during the global pandemic for you.
[00:05:38] And it leads to a narrative and then I'll be more specific with the answer it leads to a narrative which I think is quite dangerous which is that the go to market playbook is broken it doesn't work anymore you hear this it's just not true now all that here's how I think about it.
[00:05:53] The playbook that some folks are running from 2021 of course does not work jayers not work as well but here's what I say the plays all work.
[00:06:02] Webinars inbound outbound left bound right bound it all still works and.
[00:06:08] The interesting thing is if you look at a lot of the hottest AI companies like look at verse sell they just raise it 10 billion who's this she was the chief business officer it's stripe okay look at wrap up where we just did a whole SK with them there's zero to 250 million already this.
[00:06:23] Here vibe coding who's there zero zoom info okay if you go through all of the hot AI companies right now that are vaguely and B2B you will see a cast a characters from the is at the odds is always safe no no from the tens.
[00:06:38] You will see B2B leaders that you all know from saster 2018 and 2017 running the a companies that wouldn't be possible if the plays don't work now are they using different tools are the using more a ask air things we can chat about for sure right but.
[00:06:52] The biggest real difference with a lot of a I leaders is.
[00:06:56] There's just so much demand right because what's happening in a lot of AI tools is everyone is in market simultaneously the tools are either so disruptive like a cursor or rep but or loveable or 11 labs will go from like almost nothing to 300 million this year we just I mean Amelia just literally spuld up.
[00:07:15] 11 labs to do all the intro for all our speakers okay we did it in like she didn't in 10 minutes we start to pay an agency that would take weeks and complain about it and they'd be terrible and they argue of the pronunciation of people's names know it it's limpkin it's Jason limkin we have to argue and they get angry we literally did it today in the green room in like 20 minutes right that is so disruptive the this demand and so of course if you have.
[00:07:40] insane in demand sometimes with forality is going to change the playbook because you're going to be servicing it right.
[00:07:47] And I know you know that bolt which is one of the leaders in vibe coding what the head of sales there was was one of our old sales team like the oldest new.
[00:07:57] And even there and I know it's true loveable and rap just as three examples they have so much in down they can't service it they have to look at the list each day and so I mean I think Brian who runs it a bolt is it.
[00:08:10] Sixty nine I think it's three people on the sales team or something.
[00:08:12] For okay so how many leads can they follow up with thousands right so that is different.
[00:08:20] But they're all classic B to B sales reps just instead of calling every lead and trying to convince them their fungible product is the exact same as another product they have insane demand and servicing but it's the same playbook it's the same demos it's the same everything so.
[00:08:34] And that's not quite the question you're asking but I do think it's important to understand that the playbooks may not work as well but the plays are the same and in any cases it's the same players so it's just it's just a lot of folks in market looking for radically better solutions.
[00:08:50] And at the same time CIOs and others are cutting budgets for old solutions there is this it's not a paradox but it can feel like it.
[00:08:59] If you I've written a lot about it on sastra just wrote it up with a bunch of gardener day to this year gardener said.
[00:09:05] Overall enterprise software is going to grow the fastest it ever has at 15% a year at this scale right it I mean it 400 billion it hasn't grown this fast ever.
[00:09:16] But of that 15% almost half is taken up by price increases from existing best everyone's raising prices and about half of the remaining half is new AI budget.
[00:09:25] So that means if you're not one of the ones that they're focused on for price increases or buying or you're not adding agent force or you're not an AI tool they want to add to everyone else has to get cut so vendor the vendor count is getting stable or shrunk.
[00:09:39] To make room for new offerings and price increases from the select vendors and the new AI guy so can feel like there's forces that are either.
[00:09:47] Hope that are punishing you in a way that didn't use to or or their tailwinds their tailwinds and the reality is if you talked to any vendor this year that's a sponsor the reason they're sponsors because they got tailwinds.
[00:09:59] The headwind ones aren't sponsoring anymore it probably should be the opposite the ones that have to headwind should probably be here hustling for customers and the ones that are tailwinds should be just back in the office wondering what to do with the surplus of leads.
[00:10:12] But this is the this is the odd odd thing about marketing.
[00:10:16] So that's the world we're in.
[00:10:19] And we can chat more about it folks follow up questions specifically on is inbound so no inbound isn't dead the the art is like art is in sits here on qualified we know them pretty well we're just talking with the head of S and be a sales force Asian force all of them have more demand and they can service.
[00:10:37] All of them it's actually interesting they all have the same kind of issue is there's just not enough forward deployed engineers not enough solution are done enough folks to get the agents going they're all turning away customers because they have too much demand for an agent they can do everything for them.
[00:10:52] So inbound isn't dead.
[00:10:54] Is SEO dead if you're writing the classic playbook right I'll tell you our SEO it's aster here's it looks we sassers a lot of things we do events we do a podcast we do multiple podcasts with Harry we got two YouTube's we got tweets.
[00:11:09] But our blog if you've been with us for while our blog is like our core it's like home base okay and our blog traffic was fairly flat from about four years.
[00:11:17] Going into this year our SEO is down 8% not not 50 but eight for real we can track it but our traffic's up 50.
[00:11:26] Traffic is up 15 going up our viewership we will end this year sassers calm twice as many readers as last year even though our SEO is down.
[00:11:34] Now our SEO is down 8% and I think folks like G2 have said there's is down like 30 or 40% or more so.
[00:11:41] If that's your only play and you got no ideas and you haven't changed your product or your GGM since 2021 you're it's probably going to fill it to 50% harder.
[00:11:50] But for us like actually don't I mean most of our team is AI agents now so we don't really have anyone to tell me why our our viewership is up but I can tell you want to look at the content it's because people all want to read about AI GGM content okay they don't want to read about.
[00:12:04] Classic saster themes about CS teams and zeros turns out unless there's an AI thing that don't want to read it but because we have some of the best.
[00:12:12] AI GGM agent content out there people are just devouring it okay and if we can sell that content.
[00:12:17] I mean a million I would buy islands okay if we can sell because the demand for that content is so high so my point to everything is you got to find that this is like my other talk tomorrow you got to find the tailwinds and lean into it.
[00:12:28] There is AI budget there is AI budget for new vendors at the CIO level.
[00:12:34] And if you're an existing in that cost if you have existing customers and you have something that truly changes the game for efficiency it truly changes you can.
[00:12:42] Replace lots of humans for your agent your customers are going to want to meet with you and they're going to want to buy it right sales for us is at 42 billion growing like 9% and I know their public company but I'm pretty convinced if they could deploy agent force overnight for every customer they could grow twice as fast right.
[00:12:59] So find that tailwind that's your job right now for your teams figure out what it's not building a copial that are putting AI in your home page it doesn't pray budget and it doesn't change it doesn't change.
[00:13:11] How your customers do business right what can you do with AI to make your product 10 times better.
[00:13:17] And it's probably replacing humans from any of you even though people think that's a tough topic that's the reality it's replacing humans in some fashion that's why customer success took off I mean support took off so quickly.
[00:13:29] Because you if you train a support AI pretty well it you a lot of folks really have replaced 20 to 50% of their support even Mark Binyoff I think we deploy three or 5,000 folks in support even there at Salesforce we all know tons of folks that have done it Sierra just said they went from one to 100 million in a year.
[00:13:48] Retailer X you know X CTO of Facebook CCO Salesforce just going out to people and saying you can replace a lot of your support teams with AI so you got to find your version of that your your tailwind to grow but if you're running the exact same playbook is 2022 nothing's changed yeah that in bounce going to be harder.
[00:14:07] SEOs down and vendor can solid the odd thing.
[00:14:12] And it will take another question it's just such an odd thing.
[00:14:15] When overall B2B software budgets are at a record size and accelerating plus 15% it hundreds of billions are of an accorded cartooner.
[00:14:24] And folks that have product market fit with a I B2B are growing like crazy but at the same time it's not free people think that CIOs have infinite budget they don't there's a little bit of elasticity but in the day companies only have so much revenue and they only have so much profits and they can only a portion so much of that to software and IT.
[00:14:44] And so it's not all free and when they're giving this money to eight.
[00:14:47] These hot AI companies they're cutting it from everybody else they're cutting it from everybody else and if they're not and if they're not arguing with you on renewals and a lot of folks have felt it it's worse they're calling up vendors and saying we're just cutting back this year.
[00:15:03] We're just and if you guys haven't ever been at it at my brief 10 years of EP to doby it was pre AI but I lived it as a VP to doby and you go around the room and you'd say.
[00:15:14] There were human layoffs and there were app layoffs okay and everyone at the boom of cloud wanted more apps and they say fine but everyone go every single VP room the room give me one or two to cut.
[00:15:25] You'd have to cut one or two and it's still happening it's just done more from the top down to CIO level so if you're on the bubble if you're an attachment to a CRM that you don't quite need right this is where you know so many foot you know outreach and sells off struggled and gone took a lot of this market because gone build everything and.
[00:15:43] But one of the things gone good is they stole budget from sells off to now reach another folks right they stole it and see it going it's already happened for this calendar but CIOs and others are going around the room and say give me an add give up an app.
[00:15:56] Or give me to if you want to add one next year you want to add a couple of apps i'll find you budget you got to give up to you got to give up to you have a hundred like marketing tools you need a hundred.
[00:16:05] Maybe 96 is enough and and and I find even in my own investing portfolio I just got investor update yesterday of a pretty successful company that's partly through it say I transition they're at.
[00:16:22] Mid eight figures in revenue they had a million and a half of trim less month a million and a half of trim less month from happy customers that you know no C sad issues no other issues they literally said just we were cut they're cutting apps.
[00:16:34] Next year word attachment we're an attachment to see her and we got cut and the CEO who I love to death fail they failed as a team because they didn't get above the cut line they now they didn't lose all our customers.
[00:16:47] But they lost to that's a 1.5 million last month not because it didn't work or wasn't great and not because they didn't have AI in it but because this two CIOs just went around the room and that was the one that got cut it was great to have.
[00:17:00] But not mission critical and it got cut to make room for another AI app.
[00:17:04] In fact one that's also speaking at this event.
[00:17:07] All right anybody else got another question.
[00:17:12] Hi I'm Patrick quite a specific one in a podcast day you said something along the lines that AIS yours didn't work but then sonnet 4 and now it works can you elaborate a little on that it's a rich question two different threads.
[00:17:28] One really none of these products these SDR products I think worked before.
[00:17:36] Cloud for dot one sonner of cloud 4 this year right.
[00:17:40] Rapid didn't work loveable didn't work.
[00:17:43] Base 44 didn't work nothing I mean they were out there they weren't very good until the magical moment when cloud 4 came out and everything was kind of magical.
[00:17:51] Gamma didn't gamma was around since 20 root out gamma we love gamma for for AI presentations one to 80 million will do this year.
[00:17:59] But it was kind of in 2020 so it was five years to one and then one to 80 this year it's not a coincidence that all of these apps took off January February March of this year that's when the LMS got better.
[00:18:10] Okay.
[00:18:11] So it away doesn't matter but if you bought a lot of over hiked go to market SDR tools before February March or April of this year.
[00:18:23] They just didn't work well right and I mean literally we were a million I.
[00:18:27] It's on our saster dot a kind slash agents website we're at this company qualified that does AI inbound and outbound we use it on a website and we were with the CEO.
[00:18:37] That they've been around for like five years he was the XMO sales force okay they've been doing this for trying to use AI to qualify inbound leads since like 2019 or something okay.
[00:18:46] Repeat founder great guy I'm like I don't have any numbers but this really took off around February March this year right it's like yeah like that's what your product actually work is like yeah that's when it finally actually worked after five years right same with gamma.
[00:18:59] Rapid was founded almost 10 years ago right and blew up it'll go it was 10 years to a million and then one to 250 million.
[00:19:05] So so you kind of almost after if you had it's let it's less an issue for this room then maybe the maybe the less techie of the world but if you had a bad experience with almost any AI LM GTM.
[00:19:20] Other product before March of this year right it off it was a different time it was different alums different world okay that's a base point.
[00:19:29] The second point.
[00:19:31] Which is not the same question but it's related.
[00:19:34] Many of folks whether they tried to deploy an AI sales agent before or after Q1 of this year.
[00:19:41] So many folks.
[00:19:44] Just told someone on their team to do it or hired agency that didn't know what they're doing.
[00:19:48] Okay literally a million I were on a call with.
[00:19:52] Global technology leader we all know and love we've all heard that's pretty AI forward okay pretty impressive company and said we're we're thinking about buying our first a ISTR we're just going to buy it at hand it to our
[00:20:03] SDRs and have them figured out.
[00:20:06] Have them figured out it's not going to work you got to train it you got to train it for a month you got to train it every day you've got to iterate and onboarding so that's another failure mode that I already heard like 10 times since I've been here today folks like
[00:20:18] Well if I did I just buy one of these tools and turn it on and walk away you can't we've said this in every workshop Wednesday the million I've done with every other speaker.
[00:20:25] It still doesn't work so one failure mode was like pre the fours pre pre you know.
[00:20:31] Cloud for and GPT for pre the four is a step did just the alums weren't good enough and the other one was we bought it and just turned it on and we didn't
[00:20:39] actually get millions of revenue don't work that way right and the real way if I to summarize it and we'll talk a lot about it at this event here's the other mistake folks make if you want and really makes this a lot of times on our on our live webinars or work the I workshop ones in Wednesday.
[00:20:53] Here's the captain obvious thing for any a ISDR BDR even a ease as we do more of them CSM's first you got to have it work in the real world with humans then you tell the AI what worked that you
[00:21:06] the there's no magical prompt okay the prompt is here's the script that I use with a customer that I closed then you iterate that prompt and then you hook it up to data like sales
[00:21:17] for sir hub spot or other sources of data or snowflake and then you have it in just the data to keep working with that prompt and make about it's not that complicated.
[00:21:25] Okay somebody folks are like oh well sasters AI SDR works because you have inbound leads like well everyone has some inbound leads or it's just
[00:21:36] you you've got the only is on as you closed any customers you can train the AI to be almost as good as you and work 24 seven it's that simple but folks think that like I'm going to buy I have no inbound leads at all I have no inbound I've never done outbound so I've no inbound leads I've never done outbound by a tool and turn it on I'm a
[00:21:55] millions like how the F would that work just this is to the sales rep that got a commission at that vendor but you know it doesn't work and you can lap but I would say 80% of the conversations
[00:22:08] Amelia do you agree that we have our a version of that I bought a tool.
[00:22:13] I bought a tool and I have no leads I bought a tool and I have a lot of leads but I didn't connect it to my leads it didn't
[00:22:16] magically work and like so you just figure out what works in the real world and then train the AI to just do it again and again and again with more and more and more data and then read every email it's
[00:22:28] attends read every response it ingest and some of them will be dumb and some of them will be wrong and all these tools have some bit of training and you say hey that was wrong.
[00:22:37] You know saster saster AI London is not December 4th okay or whatever mistake it makes and you do it every day for that a month and then the mistakes start to go away and they become
[00:22:45] more current and it gets trained on better more more it's not that complicated but it's you've got to sell it just like anything going back to
[00:22:52] the disaster if you can't sell it yourself the AI can't sell it for you it's that some we can't sell yourself the AI can't sell thanks for the big answer but thanks to the question.
[00:23:03] So for Legion for a reason yeah what do you think what kind of skills skills skills skills should we upload in 2026 and what's the like the golden
[00:23:13] I get to channel or the main channel which one do you think that it's well I'll give you two answers first of all
[00:23:23] for mark for marketers in general for B2B marketers I talk to I talked to a great
[00:23:31] marketer when I came in at an AI focused company saying she's pretty confident about her job things are going well but she
[00:23:38] was nervous the world's changing so much was worried for her job and I said you should be everyone should be
[00:23:43] worried for their job every zero or CMO should be worried for their job on the one and it's the same people in
[00:23:48] the same place but there's so much change and you gotta get ahead of it right if you don't get ahead of it and build
[00:23:53] skills it's going to be hard so the advice I gave there and then I'll I'll give a second piece of
[00:24:01] the number one business advice is become proficient like a couple tools here or otherwise a couple
[00:24:07] leaders okay right now today if you are world class at agent force or clay or qualified or artisan
[00:24:15] or any of the tools here really doesn't matter which one pick two or three leaders that that have
[00:24:21] decent revenue that people have heard of and it and and you go through the deployment yourself you
[00:24:26] do the training we talked about you onboard you get it working in your company and you can point
[00:24:30] to the metrics just like Amelia is going to do tomorrow here's highway at 7.2% open rating years
[00:24:34] how long it took and years out if you have those skills you will be infinitely higherable for the
[00:24:39] next 18 months because only like 2% of marketers have those skills so become the expert in deploying
[00:24:45] agents and it doesn't need to mean you know every agent or even needs to be technical but you need
[00:24:49] to pick a few leaders and deploy them yourself not not tell someone your team to do it which is
[00:24:55] what we see do it yourself do it watch it iterate it train it iterate every day spend a week non-stop
[00:25:02] deploying it and then work on it every single day for a month you will learn so much and you will
[00:25:06] become infinitely deployable that's sort of at the agent level you know I think I'm on and just
[00:25:16] sort of generic demand playbook I don't I I'm still learning I don't have all the magic ideas
[00:25:22] but I think if you think like like buying geo vendors and just figuring out how to automate
[00:25:28] LinkedIn posts is going to save your job it's not I think you just like always we got to be
[00:25:32] careful of LinkedIn bullshit and charlatans because even if it's like a little bit better it's
[00:25:37] not going to it's not going to save you if the CIO's canceling your app that they like it's not
[00:25:42] going to save you I don't know all the answers but you need to it's it's it's harder and harder to
[00:25:49] sell fungible products that don't show massive instant ROI and I think back a lot the first
[00:25:57] podcast that Mark Benioff did with us earlier the year I asked what he thought of Palantir obviously
[00:26:05] one you know one of the biggest successes in AIB2B you know he he he said he went on to say this a
[00:26:10] lot other time he's like I'm jealous of how much they charge huh pretty funny you know they
[00:26:14] charge more than he does but I really love the thing he said next he said I'm I'm
[00:26:19] jealous in a way I wish I love what they're doing for forward to put engineers and what Mark said
[00:26:24] was I wish everyone at Salesforce could go lie even before they pay they could go lie before they
[00:26:30] even paid this think about this and this is a marketing in sales weapon the way we used to buy
[00:26:38] B2B software for years was I I need a CRM I need a marketing automation your friends would use it
[00:26:45] you saw your last company you talked to a sales rep that could answer six questions you'd buy it
[00:26:50] and if you're lucky by the end of the year you might deploy it I mean in the old days if we've been
[00:26:54] if you've been around for a while you might have customers that were new for year two then
[00:26:57] ever even deploying your one okay that don't fly today it flies a little bit but I don't find much
[00:27:03] okay what Mark's point was at key said I know I can't deliver this today it's not it's not feasible
[00:27:08] but the technology is there I wish every single customer would be live on an adit on an agent
[00:27:13] force or whatever a gentick sales force before they gave me a dollar think about that this is my
[00:27:18] best advice get as close to that today as you can for your customer when you look at the ones that
[00:27:23] explode the cursor is the gammas think about go back and use them again think about how much value
[00:27:29] you get in the free program think about how much value you get in the first month what can you do
[00:27:34] with AI to provide that much value to customers before they even pay you if you provide insane value
[00:27:40] with an agent before they pay you they're going to be kind of happy to pay you rather than the
[00:27:45] sucker bet that we all made for for the better part of two decades a sucker bet I think it works
[00:27:50] I got someone gave me a demo the demo kind of works I can't use it myself but I you know I need that
[00:27:57] and then half the time it's a horror story so my that's my best idea is make your provide insane
[00:28:05] value before you get a check and then the percent of your leads it's going to convert it's going to
[00:28:09] scatter skyrocket it's whatever it is it's going to skyrocket so thanks for the question I'm still
[00:28:14] learning the own part it's a more generic question there are some AI experts that think or say
[00:28:30] that with a GI in two three years sass will be dead because it can literally just talk to
[00:28:36] open AI or so on and say write a code that does that and you don't need to buy software you will
[00:28:41] just do it on the man or look and learn from itself I would love to hear your thoughts on that
[00:28:51] means possible listen listen it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[00:29:00] if you'd if you'd ask me six months ago I'd say the odds that's true is zero that that's like
[00:29:04] chatchy between nonsense right I mean chatchy be very very powerful you know it's very
[00:29:10] extensible it's very open it's still impossible you cannot reproduce the amount of workflows the
[00:29:16] amount of corner cases the amount of complexity that complex B2B software does
[00:29:24] but you can chip away at it you can chip away at it and so I know I can't quite show it on
[00:29:29] screen but like this app we built I mean we built 11 apps I built 11 apps I buy coded 11 apps in
[00:29:37] 90 days that have been used 800 thousand times they're all at saster.iSashAgence 800 thousand times
[00:29:43] in 90 days I haven't we haven't stolen revenue from anybody but that's a bit of an existential
[00:29:49] threat to somebody isn't it so and the other point I'll say for folks
[00:29:55] the since we I built these 12 apps on Replic I can't tell you how much better the agent has
[00:30:06] gone so if any of you follow me closely you'll know the first app I built on Replic like 170 is
[00:30:13] ago it blew up it didn't work it deleted my database those post went viral's on Reddit
[00:30:19] got some like threats some death threats from redditors when crazy millions of views okay and there's
[00:30:24] a lot of reasons that happened and if you want we can talk about it for fun I've learned a lot I
[00:30:28] I intentionally went into I did this it was it was an experiment from like 160 days or whatever
[00:30:35] because everyone Microsoft lovable Replic was all saying just tell us in tell us in a sentence
[00:30:43] lonsar tell us in one prompt what you want to build then you can build it they all say there's
[00:30:47] 180 tell tell us you want Salesforce for building 60 seconds of course I was impossible so I said
[00:30:52] but they're all saying it it not just these startups like lovable and replete and bold so Microsoft
[00:30:57] was saying it Microsoft the sentence like okay I'm going to do a social experiment with all of us
[00:31:01] I'm going to build an app for the disaster community without learning anything I'm not going to study
[00:31:05] these apps I'm not going to understand how they work I'm not going to read anything I'm just going
[00:31:09] to ask Twitter which one I should use and they said by a narrow margin pick replettes I picked it
[00:31:13] by a narrow margin and it went off the rails for the first one okay I can tell you why it deleted
[00:31:18] the database and all these other things but they fixed all of those issues for for real but more
[00:31:23] importantly the agents is like a hundred times better now when I go when I started writing
[00:31:29] apps on replete 170 so I'd be like I want to build a way to connect folks in this room together
[00:31:35] and the code would just be wrong it would hallucinate it would say things that were all wrong
[00:31:40] I couldn't test it I couldn't QA it it was I was never going to finish an app and and almost no
[00:31:45] infinities apps ideas now now I wrote one you know in an hour for this event and
[00:31:54] what I'll give an example of something this change and then I know it's along with an answer
[00:31:57] when rep at launches v3 and I'm sure lovable has it and cloud itself has some of this functionality
[00:32:02] now now in replete v3 which only launched like 45 days ago there's multiple agents that talk to
[00:32:09] each other and check the work okay so when I did the first app and in replete it deleted my
[00:32:14] database now it calls in other agents to help it so before it deleted my days now it has an architect
[00:32:19] and when there's a tough problem it doesn't just do something go off the rails it says hold on I'm
[00:32:22] not sure I'm going to call it another agent the architect and the architect talks to it and if
[00:32:27] there's a security question they bring another up on security and now they have a design specialist
[00:32:32] so there's so much better and so my larts of the rate we're not going to build the classic CRM
[00:32:41] s and the therapies that we all use but don't underestimate the the rate at which this stuff's
[00:32:47] getting better and so where do I think that nets out today and maybe next year I'll have a
[00:32:52] different answer I'm still I mean I know a lot but I'm still learning mode just realize that
[00:32:59] like your competitive edge is shrinking in time shrinking in time when I started in SAS you basically
[00:33:10] had you build something really slick and then you'd have about 18 12 to 18 months until you were
[00:33:15] copied by a startup then you'd have like five years until a big company copied you okay I don't
[00:33:20] really get it myself but for fun when we launched Echo sign Docu sign which is like 18 billion
[00:33:24] dollar company today I'd only worked in Windows and only was partially web based we had like 18
[00:33:30] months before they decided hey we're gonna copy what Lemkin it has team did we needed to get users
[00:33:37] they needed to see traction they had traction and printer drivers for real estate didn't seem
[00:33:42] worth their trouble then it took like five years to six years for Adobe to decide to copy it then
[00:33:46] the copy didn't work and they bought us then like Google just launched a clone like last year like
[00:33:51] decade later like that's the way it used to happen not too recently I invested in a startup that I
[00:33:58] love incredible incredibly powerful startup within two weeks they have like four clones two weeks
[00:34:06] and then I talk with a massive company that's building a clone themselves it'll be out this year
[00:34:11] so the rate at which that this is where I think it's not that we're gonna rebuild work day in sales
[00:34:17] force and Oracle but our competitive edges are gonna be measured in months and when they used to
[00:34:23] be years and that compounds that compounds and if you can't run at that pace I don't see how you're
[00:34:32] gonna you're gonna you're gonna fall to zero percent growth so that's what I worry about is this
[00:34:36] rate of iteration and so it's not exactly the narrative of you can prompt everything in chat GBT
[00:34:43] but our our modes are all weakening our modes are all shallower and the pace of copying and
[00:34:52] improving I mean literally this it's funny this so Google just launched a reputlable clone it's
[00:34:59] had its own it launched it what's Monday so I think it launched it on Friday or Saturday or
[00:35:05] something so I'm like I know these apps I'm gonna try it so I put in this prompt to build vapor
[00:35:09] cell didn't quite work okay just launched okay doesn't have a database it does it's missing a lot
[00:35:13] of things but I just took that work which literally took about 10 minutes and I gave it to
[00:35:18] Repplet and repuclunded in five minutes it worked better it worked better I'll give you another example
[00:35:25] I we talked about this word about a little bit we took we we're running about five AISDRs and BDRs
[00:35:30] asaster now took us a while to do this our most recent one we just took a prompt from one and
[00:35:37] put it into another and it just worked it just worked and then so agents will actually may make
[00:35:44] our modes even weaker and shallower because if the agents can just take if I can take a prompt
[00:35:50] from one app and give it to another app my switching costs have gone out radically haven't they
[00:35:53] it's that two years of business process change in mapping data and the mapping data doesn't work and
[00:35:59] the leads don't map the leads in the context if I can literally take the prompt which is reach out
[00:36:03] to my top 50 attendees from saster lender this year and give them a special poop on for saster
[00:36:08] annual in May and that's my prompt and it works and I can just give it to another agent that does
[00:36:12] the same thing where's my mouth I mean there is switching costs but it's so much lower than it used
[00:36:18] to be so that's the kind of stuff I worry about that the cloning is going to be much faster the agents
[00:36:24] the agents create short the shallower modes the agents can ingest each other's prompts and I just
[00:36:30] feel like everything is on shake your competitive mode foundations and that's the world we got to
[00:36:35] adapt in we don't get five years to wait for big guy to clone us that was the old days we got five
[00:36:40] years five years to wait sometimes like seven or eight years and then a big company would say oh well
[00:36:45] they hit a hundred million because for a lot of big companies you're so big I mean if you're if you're
[00:36:51] doing you know I keep coming back to sales or said forgetting whatever one else is revenues but
[00:36:55] sales was 45 billion okay so one way you're thinking about competitors one way to think about
[00:37:01] competition is it's got to be 10% okay so at the end of the day it's probably not worth sales
[00:37:06] for us doing something that can't make them four to five billion in revenue okay now it's a little
[00:37:10] more atomic than that it might be each business unit is smaller right so maybe maybe CRM is is
[00:37:16] an insurance like six six billion so maybe it's worth them doing getting out of bed for 600
[00:37:20] million or 800 million to revenue etc etc billion dollar competitors the same so it used to take
[00:37:26] everything five seven ten years to get to a hundred millions and no one even bothered to compete now
[00:37:31] when you when when if if replete gets to 250 million one year of course Google is going to clone it
[00:37:36] right so everyone's everyone's aware of this and cloning faster and and you know I don't want to be
[00:37:42] one of these guys on X which is that the only mode is speed and working 996 but there's a lot of
[00:37:47] I think there's a lot of truth in it and and if you don't like it you're going you might you you
[00:37:52] you might go into terminal decay like you'll you'll hang on to your existing base but you won't
[00:37:56] get any I mean it's tough I wrote up today I really tried to be positive and then it got like 500,000
[00:38:02] views on X on LinkedIn I wrote up PagerDuty PagerDuty missed its last quarter PagerDuty's doing just
[00:38:09] cross 500 million in ARR it's worth one billion dollars two times revenue two times revenue
[00:38:16] now there's a bunch of things that happened there the but they their customer count is flat 15,000
[00:38:22] something customers for four years so data dog came out with a clone it last seems product is better
[00:38:28] start ups are better and they just didn't move fat I don't mean to be critical of folks of PagerD
[00:38:32] I'm sure they're doing a great job but objectively they did it move fast enough and I think it's
[00:38:36] only going to accelerate everyone will build will build a clone now they'll build them faster it
[00:38:39] took data dog 15 years to decide to do this or 10 years and might take them eight months to do it
[00:38:44] next time and 90 days to do it with next time and and then I will take another question if you
[00:38:51] guys haven't vibe coded or something whether it's cursor or replete or something there's a lot of
[00:38:57] learnings but one thing that's much much easier is if you already know exactly what you want to
[00:39:02] build so cloning is so much easier like literally I took the prompt from Google and put into
[00:39:07] Repplet and I instantly cloned it because I knew exactly what I wanted to build we built this
[00:39:11] DC founder matchmaking hold suite of apps there if you go to sassard.ai click a i vc
[00:39:17] we've done like that almost a thousand vc founder connections for free we've we've graded
[00:39:23] almost 3000 pitch decks and then 700 thousand startup valuations okay and that took me a couple
[00:39:27] months to figure out now I know how I want to connect founders and vp's through this same workflow
[00:39:33] I didn't know what to do it in my head this isn't going to take me 90 days it's going to take me
[00:39:37] like two weeks to do this one and so my my point is this cloning is going to get even faster because
[00:39:43] once you build it and work smart folks already know what they want to build already see it and know
[00:39:47] that's the easy stuff to build and you can just fly in cursor or replete or whatever when you
[00:39:52] know exactly what you want to build when you hear you'll hear folks say like our teams not
[00:39:56] much more productive with these vibe coding apps there's probably a lot of reasons but one reason
[00:40:00] is they don't know what they want to build but when you talk with the best engine when you talk
[00:40:04] with some of the best engineers and they'll say something crazy like I do 90% of my code with
[00:40:09] five coding tools like like how is that possible well often they're not 90% of the time for the
[00:40:15] 90% they're not building something that's never been done before they're really building something
[00:40:17] that's been done before so they're really know in their head how they want leads contacts and
[00:40:21] opportunities or email automation or whatever they they're thinking through and they go for run
[00:40:25] or they think about it for a couple weeks and they can see it form in their head they get pretty good
[00:40:29] I call it replant replant fluent for me I can already see in my head how I want to write the
[00:40:33] application but there's cursor fluid and everything fluent and so it's just you're just 10 times faster
[00:40:39] when you know what you want to build and so I'm worried about the notes but thank you I think that's
[00:40:44] too much of that anybody else got a question in the go to market world a lot of people talk loosely
[00:40:51] about the importance of ROI and value selling and quantifiable business cases well why is it so hard
[00:40:57] for sales teams to action on is it awareness understanding a process or tools issue what's really
[00:41:03] holding teams back from speaking the language of cfos well listen let's be honest
[00:41:10] gotta be honest in the age of AI most most sales reps have no idea how to sell value
[00:41:15] you can't sell value a mesh or product expert you cannot sell value it most sales folks want to talk
[00:41:23] or with a war sheet a tear sheet they know six things
[00:41:26] you can't sell value if you're not a product expert AI makes it more extreme we try these products we
[00:41:34] know these products we need onboarding we need to trade our agent I was we were with an AI leader
[00:41:41] the other day a million hour there they closed a seven figure deal while we were there
[00:41:49] the solution architect left the sales team behind closed it without them didn't want to talk to
[00:41:55] the sales team sells into the product had no value they had no value so what was the term again
[00:42:01] would we call it solution what was the sorry what do we call it value what what sorry value based
[00:42:08] selling instead in the water value based selling is providing value you cannot provide value in the
[00:42:18] age of AI if you do not know the product cold ideally how to deploy it and how to get it going
[00:42:24] and apply real value not to have evaluation calculate on your website that says 18 months down
[00:42:28] the road the product will work okay so I think a lot of these I these these are just a bunch of lazy
[00:42:36] sales ideas from reading from a script from high demand fungible complex to deploy products where
[00:42:42] they think taking folks out to lunch or knowing four buzzwords is adds any value to a customer
[00:42:48] we and it's always been hard to sell a technical for non technical sales folks to sell a technical
[00:42:55] product to CTOs and VPS and engineering and why has it always been hard they just don't know the
[00:43:01] product well enough and the easiest thing for sales folks is to sell has always been sales products
[00:43:05] sales tools they use them every day just sell the tools you know but I think we're going to see
[00:43:11] AI is not going to replace the AE the way it is already beginning to replace the SDR has already
[00:43:17] replaced support is already replacing customer success but it is going to replace a lot of ease
[00:43:22] that aren't product don't know the product cold and I just got to tell you I really think 70 80
[00:43:29] percent of the sales executives I have worked with over the last five or six years don't know the
[00:43:35] product cold it's always you if you if you look back at any of you if you look back at your sales
[00:43:40] whoever your top couple sales reps are whatever pre AI doesn't matter the top ones
[00:43:46] weren't just good schmuzers or good like they knew the product cold especially for startups right I
[00:43:52] call themselves magicians but they're not magical they just know how every nothing cranny works how
[00:43:56] every how to how to how to get past feature gaps how it all works and we're just not going to
[00:44:02] tolerate mediocre sales reps in the age of AI we're just going to buy from somebody else the mediocre
[00:44:08] the worst one you can't hire today is a sales rep that tells you they're a great people person
[00:44:14] who cares here's what I want I want an AI SDR I want it deployed in 30 days I want it to get me
[00:44:22] this amount of code I want to do this workflow I want to integrate it this way in there and the
[00:44:27] reps like oh sounds good we can do that I mean it's not going to work you're a people person I'm a
[00:44:32] people person I text with all my I close all my deals on text but people I see this one I just
[00:44:38] closed I closed off $50,000 last month on text I don't I don't need to meet anybody I mean those
[00:44:45] that that worked in 2021 when there's infinite demand right it just does I don't see it working today
[00:44:56] I'll tell you I caught up with the sales rep that I've known for years at in lockdown
[00:45:03] made almost a million bucks at a hot cloud company that had infinite demand right it was three to five
[00:45:09] deals at a million bucks then next year made about 600,000 felt felt it was undervalued and quit found
[00:45:16] a new job made about 180 after that that company is struggling now he's back in school no job
[00:45:27] that great people person got to be an expert got to be an expert so I think all that stuff's dead
[00:45:33] and AI is just making us all too smart all too product where again going back to the way we're
[00:45:39] expecting almost infinite infinite value so you really don't need value selling if you're product
[00:45:45] expert they'll leave they just don't want to just don't want to talk to the sales reps it's my
[00:45:49] my strong feeling I know folks a lot of sales folks want to fight this I'm linked in and I
[00:45:55] I but I I know a lot of them they're not crushing it ones that are fighting or fighting the future
[00:45:59] and you got to brace the future you got you got to find your tailwind so thank you
[00:46:13] what you mentioned earlier that the motions are the same in a lot of cases in
[00:46:19] bound is not dead outbound is not dead what are the characteristics that have changed in like a
[00:46:24] successful outbound motion and what stayed the same
[00:46:38] it's a great question I should know the only answer to I can tell you one thing that we learned
[00:46:41] from our outbound AI is geometrically more volume and the same results so our results have not
[00:46:48] gone down in the age of AI by training the AI with the best scripts and ideas that humans did we
[00:46:54] basically saw this same in some cases a little worse in some case a little better but the same
[00:46:58] as humans for the most part with much higher productivity so I mean it's outbound isn't dead and
[00:47:09] if you if to some extent no matter how much sales you've done if you've never been a buyer at a
[00:47:16] big company you don't get outbound okay and then and then I'll do one more one more different
[00:47:22] point of the more wrap up let me step back for a minute I remember you know back in the day when I
[00:47:28] was an early sass founder I was a dream force and we had a we we had a large sass company that SAP
[00:47:36] bought called success factors was on a panel with me and I didn't even know I'm never met him
[00:47:41] at turn to mind is like yeah I bought your product Jason like well great he's like why it's like
[00:47:46] well it was the end of the quarter our facts machines were broken and you said you'd figured out
[00:47:51] e-signatures and I needed the problem that that product today and I bought 300 seats okay so
[00:47:59] one of his top problems at a given time right high ROI immediate value proposition
[00:48:05] red a cold email from a company at two million AR okay now all the other emails you know
[00:48:11] you know we help we can we can enrich your data better we can we can help you do look it just
[00:48:15] it didn't the fact was his team couldn't get the facts machines to work okay or some variant there of
[00:48:21] so my point is and this goes all the way up to the CEO level every CEO I know of at the biggest
[00:48:29] companies I asked Brian Halligan from up the chairman of House of the Sillidae Siamani too
[00:48:34] you I asked you I'm a sastra in your this year do you read your coldly bounce she's like I read
[00:48:38] them every day email is the best even today it's the best thing in the world everyone reads it it's an
[00:48:43] open medium they get it and your job is not just to have your LLM get you the right headline you're
[00:48:50] your job without bound is to solve one of the top three problems of your buyer whether it's CEO
[00:48:56] SVP VP wherever if it's the top three problems you're going to get a meeting okay whether it's a top
[00:49:03] three pain point or a top three initiatives like I don't actually all these a i s d r b d r agent force
[00:49:09] artisan that's here qualified I don't actually know this is a top three problem for a lot of buyers
[00:49:15] but I know it's a top three thing on their mind everyone wants to I want to figure out how to do an
[00:49:18] a s d r so it's either a top three initiative or a top three problem if you're in top three you're
[00:49:24] going to see super high open rates if you have the if you have a differentiated product and crystal
[00:49:28] clear value proposition this is not changed in the age of a i this is not changed and I don't
[00:49:35] know why people thought crummy emails for the 10,000th you know cadence product worked and maybe
[00:49:41] it did work I'm actually I'm actually flabbergasted that those emails worked right and maybe they're
[00:49:47] they're sucker bets but your job is to be in the top three initiatives or top three needs of your
[00:49:54] buyer and then the last captain obvious thing I'll say but this way you have to read your your
[00:50:00] teams emails humans or a i s you have to listen to their calls it's got to be great and has to
[00:50:06] be something you would you buy your own product from email I would challenge everybody to go back
[00:50:10] and read emails from your sales team your revenue team your marketing team read the email they
[00:50:15] sent out about your product and ask yourself would you buy based on this email I'll bet you not
[00:50:20] over 90% you would not buy your own product from it so why would you expect anybody else to
[00:50:25] slow it down read that email you know the next age of AI and sales prospect but why would you buy
[00:50:32] that product slow it down put some data in it even better put it could put it could put it could
[00:50:37] put it could the best you know the best one that works you know if you're if you're reaching out
[00:50:41] to lovable hey replete used us and one five big you know reach out to direct competitors hub
[00:50:47] spot versus sales force whatever you know those ones always work when you have a great case study
[00:50:51] from one competitor you're going to get a meeting but the lazy arse email never never work before
[00:50:55] I guess maybe it worked for it don't work today so I don't know if that totally answers the question
[00:51:00] but outbound works as well as it ever has if you solve a top need and sorry the last I know it's a
[00:51:05] lot what you don't realize I'll tell you how it works in big companies may may may maybe folks have
[00:51:10] worked in there I was just a VP of Adobe for for a little more than a year but
[00:51:18] basically there were you know there were there was unbudgeted discretionary and budgeted right you
[00:51:22] sort of know these words but you might not see them in practice okay getting budgeted money
[00:51:27] it was big dollars but it was really hard okay they're melting million dollar contracts
[00:51:32] these often would take one three five years of discussing and planning until you could close that
[00:51:38] deal okay maybe get a pilot but then I was the most junior VP of all the VPs I don't know how many
[00:51:43] VPs were 40 50 but even I had a 500 case slush budget okay this was a while ago today might be a
[00:51:49] million bucks okay and everyone had more and what was my slush budget for my top three needs that I
[00:51:55] just couldn't get elsewhere in the organization or elsewhere budgeted through the CFO and I needed
[00:52:01] so if you gave me if you solve one of my three needs sitting in my corner tower office
[00:52:06] and it was some fraction of that 500 K to a million I had budget I didn't even care it's
[00:52:10] used to lose it in big companies okay now I didn't have one more dollar than that I didn't have one
[00:52:15] more dollar and I didn't care about my eighth problem I just didn't care but selfishly if you
[00:52:21] solve one of my problems I had half million to a million bucks to buy so those the budgets
[00:52:25] you're fighting for they haven't changed in the age of AI but our priorities have changed
[00:52:29] and know so many folks have their their own problems in their own or but they're also under
[00:52:34] pressure to bring innovation into the enterprise that's the a budget you gotta be being these three
[00:52:39] but I had it was really really hard for me to get a million dollar piece of software and it would
[00:52:44] probably would have taken me years as the new VP but I had a million bucks an adrient almost a million
[00:52:48] bucks to spend on whatever I needed to get the hundreds of folks that worked for me just to solve
[00:52:53] their problems not even that much per person right but I I can I could do that in a week or two that
[00:52:58] was up until that line and then I was tapped out for the year so all right I think we're over for
[00:53:03] now we'll keep going for the rest of the day and bars open thanks everybody conscience it
[00:53:33] you
