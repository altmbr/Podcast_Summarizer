[00:00:00] When they go to meet with the president the only thing they repeat over in their heads over and over is don't forget to swallow
[00:00:05] Scott Galloway: Right, but they get what they want
[00:00:13] Hi everyone. This is pivot from New York magazine in the Vox Media podcast network. I'm Cara swisher and Scott was late for my birthday
[00:00:22] So look this is a big one 73
[00:00:25] Scott Galloway: It's not 73
[00:00:27] Scott Galloway: That's you my friend. I'm much younger than you. Yeah, I'm much younger than you by like two months. I'm much younger than you
[00:00:35] Scott Galloway: In plus plus for men 60 is the new 40 and for women 30 is the new 80
[00:00:42] Scott Galloway: What does that make me happy? Let's talk happy birthday Cara? I
[00:00:47] Scott Galloway: Mean you literally are the longest serving tech journalist
[00:00:52] Scott Galloway: I remember the first interview you did about technology was talking to the guy on vented fire
[00:00:58] That was a good technology that's good. That was a hell of a good technology
[00:01:01] Scott Galloway: I mean we've got a lot to get to G. D. or when you when you interviewed that company the hot of startup that it started the sink
[00:01:09] Scott Galloway: All the electricity right
[00:01:11] Scott Galloway: I got that very what else what else dirt when I invented when I talked to the guy invented
[00:01:17] Kara Swisher: You're so old you interviewed Zuckerberg back when he had human emotions
[00:01:24] Unknown Host: So that's not true anyway, we got a lot to get to today
[00:01:27] Kara Swisher: There is a lot to get to including Trump calling affordability a hoax
[00:01:30] Kara Swisher: Which is not a good idea Australia's new social media ban
[00:01:34] Kara Swisher: So much there's so much going on
[00:01:37] Kara Swisher: But first dizzy just announced a one billion dollar equity investment in open-air and will allow users to make videos with its characters on Sora
[00:01:45] Kara Swisher: Characters available through the deal will include Mickey Mouse and Cinderella as well as frozen
[00:01:50] Kara Swisher: Are the agreements do not include any talent likeness or voices mean the people like the John Cena's whoever did if be able to learn their movies
[00:01:58] Kara Swisher: Scott I don't want to know what you want to make Mickey Mouse do
[00:02:02] Kara Swisher: But what what do you think of this? This is interesting. I actually texted I go look at you mr. Tech and
[00:02:08] Kara Swisher: But it was interesting sort of especially since open air really needs a win right now
[00:02:13] Kara Swisher: Which we'll go into in a minute, but any thoughts on this?
[00:02:16] Kara Swisher: I think it's smart both of them
[00:02:20] I probably would have well
[00:02:22] Scott Galloway: Disney gets to do what it wants, but I probably would have gone with Google but in Gemini, but
[00:02:28] Scott Galloway: I think it's smart. Disney needs some AI tech
[00:02:32] Scott Galloway: Pixie dust over a company that is I mean literally
[00:02:36] Scott Galloway: Iger is the guy that decided to volunteer to go back to Vietnam and he's he's getting you know
[00:02:42] Scott Galloway: He's getting a shot shot up everywhere. Yeah, he's asked for act is the expression
[00:02:48] Kara Swisher: Yeah, instead he could just be sitting on a beach somewhere heckling from the cheap seats about the new CEO facing all this bullshit
[00:02:55] Scott Galloway: But anyways, he's back, but to do to announce this is a great press release or Disney the RP and the characters are really interesting
[00:03:01] Scott Galloway: It'll be interesting to see what they do. I don't know if it amounts to anything
[00:03:04] Scott Galloway: Yeah, I think all these people will be doing these deals right like there's not a media company
[00:03:08] Kara Swisher: I thought Joanna Stern was fun. Asia goes look at this hype is in it need wouldn't you think my bubbles complete
[00:03:14] Kara Swisher: Which was cute. There's so many good jokes. What's weird is they they did sort of their
[00:03:19] Scott Galloway: What I'll call their tired characters. I mean Mickey Mouse and Cinderella. I I sort of get well
[00:03:24] Scott Galloway: Maybe it's because I'm just I've aged out of that shit, but no their old ones my kids
[00:03:29] Kara Swisher: No Mickey Mouse and they do like Cinderella with Clara like Cinderella
[00:03:32] Kara Swisher: But the main characters of the new ones like the frozen characters or
[00:03:37] Kara Swisher: Moana. Yeah, Moana's one they're coming out with live versions of I think
[00:03:43] Kara Swisher: There's a new frozen coming out in 2026 and I think the live version of Moana's coming out. There's there's a trailer for it
[00:03:50] Kara Swisher: Um, but yeah, and I yes, yes, I would agree with you. I don't think they're picking the most recent characters
[00:03:56] Kara Swisher: Um, the kids today like but they're classics, right
[00:03:59] Kara Swisher: Right
[00:04:02] This is this is a this is smart for both of them. I don't know if it's going to mount anything
[00:04:06] Scott Galloway: But it's a good press release
[00:04:09] Scott Galloway: Yeah, it's smart and it the question is or what I would want to know
[00:04:14] Scott Galloway: Is does it end up being?
[00:04:17] some sort of
[00:04:18] Scott Galloway: Supporting evidence for why open AI should not be using other characters and identities when they're willing to pay for these ones
[00:04:25] Scott Galloway: But not others just depends on what I would use all like what's the difference
[00:04:29] Kara Swisher: You're in for a dime you're in for a dollar people are stealing it anyway. I want to have it licensed and get money from it
[00:04:35] Kara Swisher: I don't know it just seems like looking this is inevitable that there be they're either going to steal it and one thing that happened with YouTube is it
[00:04:42] Kara Swisher: As a you know as it took too long right to do what is now very lucrative for everybody right and the question is who is it more lucrative for but it's inevitable
[00:04:51] Kara Swisher: And so I think you know youtube could have done it sooner and the companies instead of member Philly Philly down and did the lawsuit
[00:04:58] Kara Swisher: Um, they were gonna steal it anyway guys. So figure out a way you can do a deal with them
[00:05:03] Kara Swisher: And I think a lot of them including tiktok is open to doing deals with is wanting and open to doing deals with these companies
[00:05:11] Kara Swisher: And they should as long as they're it protects the right it puts you in partnership with them to get rid of
[00:05:16] Kara Swisher: Cheaters I guess
[00:05:18] Kara Swisher: Yeah, I don't know the the whole Disney
[00:05:21] Scott Galloway: I'm not sure it's it's just so unrealistic and
[00:05:24] Scott Galloway: And bias against men like snow white lived in the woods with seven men and somehow none of them were
[00:05:30] Scott Galloway: Somehow none of them were emotionally available and by the way the big moral lesson from Aladdin is that that does wrong
[00:05:36] Scott Galloway: Unless you're hot and have a pet monkey with main character energy
[00:05:41] Do you know when you watch that they still have that this is a really tasteless movie
[00:05:45] Kara Swisher: Warning on it when you watch it which is interesting like you know depictions of air figures and stuff like that
[00:05:51] Kara Swisher: Yeah, same thing on
[00:05:53] Kara Swisher: There's a couple of movies like that when I was just watching
[00:05:56] Kara Swisher: I have to say though one that you put the older ones up
[00:05:59] Kara Swisher: Clara loves mermaid she loves Cinderella she loves snow white she likes the new snow white the old snow white
[00:06:04] Kara Swisher: Anyway um, uh, and you know when he poos the original influencer
[00:06:08] Scott Galloway: He's he's naked addicted to honey and lives at a bunch of deeply dysfunctional woodland friends
[00:06:13] Scott Galloway: Okay, all right and the fragging of poor Bob Iger but speaking of AI speaking of fragging president Trump will allow
[00:06:20] Kara Swisher: Invitiate a sell H 200 ships to China reactions and move are muted actually negative with Nvidia stocks slightly down
[00:06:27] Kara Swisher: Critics warning could advance Chinese AI capabilities
[00:06:31] Kara Swisher: Gosh the Wall Street Journal really took him to town on this thing
[00:06:35] Kara Swisher: Essentially, you know, and everybody did him brammer did a whole bunch of people and the idea is like look
[00:06:41] Kara Swisher: They're getting all the stuff and Nvidia is getting
[00:06:45] Kara Swisher: Getting what it wants that's it the American American public doesn't benefit in any way from there
[00:06:50] Kara Swisher: Yes
[00:06:52] Kara Swisher: So it seems like Jess and Long's you know full core press of wearing his leather jacket and hang your own Donald Trump and praising him
[00:06:58] Kara Swisher: This worked here. This is what he wanted
[00:07:01] Yeah, I'm I'm mixed on this because
[00:07:04] Scott Galloway: When we didn't sell them the hardships it feels to me like they got to work on workarounds
[00:07:10] Um, I think the policy it's like this is why we need georemundo back in charge of the shit because
[00:07:17] This stuff is not black and white and I like the idea
[00:07:20] Scott Galloway: I like the idea of slowballing it and that is giving them enough access to our chips such that they didn't make
[00:07:27] Scott Galloway: A statewide massive investment in innovation of their own
[00:07:31] Scott Galloway: In other words
[00:07:33] Scott Galloway: Like cable companies would pay content companies just enough such that they could
[00:07:38] Scott Galloway: It didn't make sense for them to go to other means of distribution, but not enough
[00:07:43] Scott Galloway: But you know, not enough so to they were more powerful than the distribution players
[00:07:47] Scott Galloway: I would have thought I would have just tried to get every economist in the room and say okay, how
[00:07:51] Scott Galloway: How can we keep the Chinese just enough chip technology that it grows our economy and our champions
[00:07:57] Scott Galloway: But we still maintain a lead because when we did embark there was a very solid argument that all you do when you in bargo
[00:08:05] Scott Galloway: China from doing this is they come up with workarounds that are really innovative
[00:08:09] So the problems I have are autonomous weapons super computing
[00:08:14] Scott Galloway: military simulations and
[00:08:17] Scott Galloway: And the problem is with high-end GPUs
[00:08:20] Scott Galloway: It can dramatically reduce the training time per like combat algorithms and missile targeting and
[00:08:28] Scott Galloway: cyber warfare and drone storms and the reality is I just don't trust
[00:08:33] Scott Galloway: Hegseth
[00:08:35] To get in a room with with our commerce secretary and kind of figure this shit out on a thoughtful level
[00:08:42] Scott Galloway: I think essentially
[00:08:44] Scott Galloway: Jensen Huang has likely said we're very supportive of you your handsome and
[00:08:48] Scott Galloway: Inviteus should get involved in your next renovation and right exactly. So I don't unfortunately I
[00:08:56] I I just like this
[00:08:58] Scott Galloway: Almost as much it's probably more impactful, but no less or more egregious
[00:09:04] Scott Galloway: Than wikofs kids and the trump kids
[00:09:08] Getting money for their shit coin investment in exchange for us agreeing to sell chips to the UAE
[00:09:15] Who has not proven that they don't have a leaky boat in terms of sending chip technology to Russia or China itself
[00:09:23] Good just on a thoughtful people figuring this out. No, well
[00:09:25] Scott Galloway: I have to say the journal was very supposed to president trump so this week you will let Nvidia sell H
[00:09:30] Kara Swisher: Sell its H200 chips to China return for US Treasury getting 25% cut of the sales
[00:09:35] Kara Swisher: The Indians struck a better deal when they sold Manhattan to the Dutch
[00:09:39] Kara Swisher: Why would the president give away one America's cheap technological advantage to an adversary and its chief economic competitor
[00:09:44] Kara Swisher: And they do say they're gonna do it anyway
[00:09:47] Kara Swisher: but
[00:09:48] Kara Swisher: But
[00:09:49] Kara Swisher: He said yet now mr. trump wants to sell the advanced H200 without strings the question is why Nvidia
[00:09:54] Kara Swisher: CEO jensen mong is lobbied for loosening the restrictions the companies friends in the white house arguing it doing so could retard
[00:10:00] Kara Swisher: Uh could retard trying to drive to develop competing chips and make its eight i
[00:10:04] Kara Swisher: Developers dependent on us chips. That's their best argument and and he's did went on to say no
[00:10:10] Kara Swisher: This is this is this is really bad on every and what we get is bob kiss essentially
[00:10:15] Kara Swisher: um, it's a great point
[00:10:16] Kara Swisher: We should have at a minimum. We should have gotten more if you look at
[00:10:20] Scott Galloway: In the last five years it's gone from 17% of exports to the us to 10% they have vastly reduced their dependence on us
[00:10:28] Scott Galloway: I get that
[00:10:29] Scott Galloway: What is asymmetric in the trading relationship with everybody is it China
[00:10:34] Scott Galloway: Since 2019 has increased its exports 40% correct. That's what they were saying we got we got more yeah
[00:10:42] Kara Swisher: Meanwhile has only increased their imports buying other people's products by 1%
[00:10:47] Scott Galloway: So they've decided we'll sell you everything
[00:10:51] Scott Galloway: We at a minimum should have extracted a pound of flesh here that said okay
[00:10:55] Scott Galloway: Where you get need to open your markets for the following things for us
[00:10:59] Scott Galloway: But this is it's in all of that the the the waterfall effect Huawei
[00:11:05] Scott Galloway: Will be a much more competitive product and they make great products and this is the last line
[00:11:09] Kara Swisher: We sure hope mr. Trump is in doing this for the in midias 25% tack payments of treasury
[00:11:14] Kara Swisher: The constitution best taxing power in Congress yet mr. Trump is essentially trading national security for pennies on the dollar
[00:11:21] Kara Swisher: So I would agree he's gotten nothing for this even with the age 20 chips. We got some rare earth minerals
[00:11:26] Kara Swisher: Um, I think at the time they they he said the administration agreed
[00:11:31] Kara Swisher: But they they put more restrictions in october. So it just this is stupid where he's the worst deal maker in
[00:11:39] Kara Swisher: In a in America
[00:11:41] Kara Swisher: Anyway, we gave a strategic competitor AI progress stronger military capability
[00:11:47] um
[00:11:48] Scott Galloway: likely a more kind of self-sufficient or innovative tech ecosystem
[00:11:52] While exposing all of our own firms to regulatory geopolitical
[00:11:56] Scott Galloway: In long-term competitive risk and in exchange, you know what we got was in video stocks gonna go up
[00:12:02] Scott Galloway: Okay, and 25 whatever, you know, it's just with three gents and long is the most
[00:12:08] Kara Swisher: And I mean this
[00:12:09] Kara Swisher: It as a compliment manipulative CEO there is um and he gets what he wants and it's all good for him video
[00:12:15] Kara Swisher: But I hate to say this but jensen
[00:12:19] and Ted sorandos
[00:12:21] and all these guys who
[00:12:24] Scott Galloway: I
[00:12:25] Scott Galloway: When they go to meet with the president the only thing they repeat over in their heads over and over is don't forget to swallow
[00:12:30] Scott Galloway: Right these guys are the most obsequious
[00:12:33] Scott Galloway: But they get what they want and but that's their I hate to say that's their job
[00:12:37] Scott Galloway: They were there yesterday and it's our job to look people
[00:12:41] Scott Galloway: Who are they yesterday that fed head dead head
[00:12:45] Kara Swisher: Fed dead whatever he's losing his mind all right
[00:12:49] Kara Swisher: Speaking of losing your mind Trump says it's imperative that CNN be sold on one of brothers deal
[00:12:54] Kara Swisher: President is not supposed to say things like this, but of course with whatever it's this one
[00:12:57] Kara Swisher: Conveniently David Ellison has reportedly told Trump officials the paramount wins out
[00:13:01] Kara Swisher: He'll make sweeping changes at CNN. What a what a cuck he is
[00:13:05] Kara Swisher: Although Trump got a little testy with the Ellison's this week lashing out on true social after 60 minutes ran in interview with marjorie
[00:13:11] Kara Swisher: Taylor green meanwhile Ellison has been pitching Warner Cheryl just directly you got apparently mario de belly interested
[00:13:18] Kara Swisher: Trying tender their shares
[00:13:20] Kara Swisher: I have I feel like I've talked to a lot of people here all this week and you know money is gonna win out here
[00:13:26] Kara Swisher: But the kind like people would have lost their minds if they're and this was in the Wall Street Journal
[00:13:31] Kara Swisher: So that he is told them he will you know, he will change CNN as part of the deal
[00:13:37] Kara Swisher: When one of the Oliver Darcy told me when he tried and he wrote when he tried to get a comment
[00:13:42] Kara Swisher: They didn't they're like what are you talking about like they didn't even deny it that they were doing that making this paper
[00:13:47] Kara Swisher: You know
[00:13:48] Kara Swisher: We'll we'll stop CNN for being so mean to you mr. President if you give us thing that would have been a four alarm journalistic fire at any other time
[00:13:57] Kara Swisher: Not with these
[00:13:59] Kara Swisher: I said that when Fox was trying to emerge with Disney or whatever well exactly like just it does I'm I'm gonna get
[00:14:05] Kara Swisher: Imagine it. It's bad. It's bad. Now. It's bad then. It's bad all the time. I mean again. It's sort of
[00:14:11] Kara Swisher: Absolutely puts solidifies. I'm walking right out of there the day they get there like I'm walking
[00:14:16] Kara Swisher: I mean, there's no way I'm working for these terrible people, but
[00:14:19] Kara Swisher: And I've said I said that on an interview with Rachel Maddox. She was asking me
[00:14:23] Kara Swisher: But but money let's go to the deal
[00:14:25] Kara Swisher: What regardless of what they do with CNN and what they're doing is heinous with their considering doing his heinous
[00:14:32] Kara Swisher: The money wins out here. It's the it's if they go up to 34. I understand they will get this they will get this
[00:14:39] Yeah, we had I thought we had a really productive conversation around this and the way this is supposed to work
[00:14:45] Scott Galloway: Is that the one with the most money wins at least initially at least initially it's meant to be a compliment
[00:14:51] Scott Galloway: It doesn't fucking matter with the president of things or it shouldn't matter
[00:14:54] Scott Galloway: No, it doesn't incorporate that matter. It doesn't matter what podcast who podcasters think would be quote-unquote better owners
[00:15:00] Scott Galloway: The person that shows up with the biggest check in capitalism in a single-class shareholder company which this is
[00:15:06] Scott Galloway: gets the prize and then subject to the following
[00:15:11] regulators bring an economist and
[00:15:14] Scott Galloway: econometrics experts and consumer behavior experts and they try and discern
[00:15:19] Scott Galloway: Whether or not the very valid argument you made
[00:15:22] Scott Galloway: That this is in fact one big market for eyeballs or if it's a distinct market because it's original content creation and a subscriber model
[00:15:31] Scott Galloway: And they make a call around whether or not this will reduce competition and leak
[00:15:36] Scott Galloway: Value and leverage from consumers and labor to the shareholders of the consolidated ecosystem or not
[00:15:44] Scott Galloway: And then and then it goes through an additional
[00:15:47] Scott Galloway: I think it's called I used to do this for a living and then it goes through something called
[00:15:52] Scott Galloway: I think it's called a syphias review that says all right. They're just under
[00:15:56] Kara Swisher: They just made it so they're just under just so you know, go ahead. They're just under all the many countries in this deal
[00:16:01] Kara Swisher: What they did is they manipulated it so that these numbers that that doesn't have to go through a syphias
[00:16:07] Kara Swisher: Well
[00:16:08] Kara Swisher: The bottom line is there should be a national security review that's not gonna be because the way they designed it
[00:16:13] Kara Swisher: Well, I'm talking about what should happen. I look what what will happen is totally like upper grabs right in a corrupt
[00:16:20] Scott Galloway: ocracy and that is a mix between
[00:16:23] Scott Galloway: Is a mix between 60s east Germany 30s Germany a cleptocracy and a cack a stocker see picker
[00:16:29] Scott Galloway: ocracy that's just fucking stupid or evil
[00:16:32] Scott Galloway: But the way it should work is big as check wins initially then it goes under any trust review by thoughtful people to figure out if it's gonna reduce competition and harm consumers and labor
[00:16:42] Scott Galloway: And then it should go under national security review and let me be
[00:16:45] Scott Galloway: Let me be cut. I actually don't think raising money out of the gulf for an acquisition like this
[00:16:50] Scott Galloway: I don't perceive that as a threat. Oh come on. It's media. They we net we lost our minds when
[00:16:55] Kara Swisher: Okay, I was the largest shareholder
[00:17:00] Scott Galloway: On the board of the New York Times. I got to meet with the editorial board once and couldn't say anything
[00:17:05] Scott Galloway: And had absolutely no influence over the editorial product there and I had two seats on the board
[00:17:10] Scott Galloway: Why so and also we have to keep in mind
[00:17:14] Scott Galloway: That the all the money right now is in the gulf and if we want access to our capital for our companies to create more competition and more tax revenue
[00:17:22] Scott Galloway: At some point we need to access that capital
[00:17:25] Scott Galloway: Having said that I would like a review by people much smarter than me to go
[00:17:29] Scott Galloway: This is why it's a risk to our free speech and they will have undo influence or someone go
[00:17:33] Scott Galloway: You know if you put these safeguards in place
[00:17:36] Scott Galloway: It's just a cheap source of capital
[00:17:38] Scott Galloway: my point is
[00:17:39] Scott Galloway: There are there are people who do this for a living and are really good at this and should be part of a review
[00:17:45] Scott Galloway: Instead it's based on the plug sugar level and the opinion unfortunately of the president who gives him money
[00:17:51] Scott Galloway: And what what TV anchor or podcast he recently listen to most recently this is there
[00:17:57] Scott Galloway: We have institutions and experts and let me use the word which has become a dirty word. We have experts for a reason
[00:18:03] Scott Galloway: All right, let me let me interject here
[00:18:05] Kara Swisher: Sure first of all they're do they're designing it
[00:18:08] Kara Swisher: So they also had 10 cent in here until they were
[00:18:11] Kara Swisher: Tencent was he had come out they knew that I thought I'm sorry about
[00:18:15] Scott Galloway: First of all they hid the idea of the they didn't hide it
[00:18:18] Kara Swisher: But they put it on the let one of the last pages of the Saudis and the others were involved
[00:18:22] Kara Swisher: Secondly, they added Jared Kushner just to put it icing on this shitty cake
[00:18:27] Kara Swisher: Thirdly, they had 10 cent in there and then they didn't I mean this is how they're thinking right and
[00:18:32] Kara Swisher: Honestly, I want to know Larry if you're so fucking rich. Why don't you just pay for it if you believe in this so much
[00:18:37] Kara Swisher: You're an American it's an American media company. Why do you need their money? I get why you would get it
[00:18:43] Kara Swisher: I'm not I'm not unsophisticated, but here's what it does
[00:18:46] Kara Swisher: There's a woman gale slater an antitrust. She's well regarded. He is now put her in such a fucking jam
[00:18:52] Kara Swisher: Like she can't do her job
[00:18:54] Kara Swisher: Because now she's sucked up into politics versus doing a real antitrust look at this right as we talked about which is streaming
[00:19:02] Kara Swisher: Where's the market etc
[00:19:04] Kara Swisher: That's an issue. It is also put the syphias people in in a jam because they can't look at this which is their job
[00:19:10] Kara Swisher: And by the way, I don't even trust them anymore given all the the Yutzes in Yahoo's they put a person in charge of FEMA that was an election denialist like a really severe one
[00:19:19] Kara Swisher: As opposed to just a sort of casual garden variety
[00:19:23] Kara Swisher: Election denier
[00:19:25] Kara Swisher: It's just they're putting incompetence and loyalists in place and nobody's going to be able to do their job here
[00:19:31] Kara Swisher: Because of what Trump is doing and how he has been staffing his administration and how he's with the only thing that I find amusing is that
[00:19:39] Kara Swisher: He's not sort of just giving into the Ellison's he's making them beg for it essentially and by kissing up to Ted Cerandos
[00:19:46] Kara Swisher: Now the question is will Netflix raise its price? Will it say do an all cash deal go to 30 and then have that stub of a company
[00:19:54] Kara Swisher: Which is the CNN and the cable the question is whether Netflix will will
[00:19:59] Kara Swisher: But but but Bill Cohen that talked to me about and he's written about is they go to 30 and then the question is what's the value of that stub
[00:20:06] Kara Swisher: Ellison's are valuing it at a dollar
[00:20:09] Kara Swisher: Uh, or a little more than a dollar and others like pretty well-known analysts are going at anywhere from three to five dollars
[00:20:16] Kara Swisher: And so that makes their deal higher than the Ellisons, but what if the else that just go to 34 cash
[00:20:23] Kara Swisher: There's you know, that's the whole situation. I think most of the arb's just want the money and move along right presumably
[00:20:30] Scott Galloway: They're
[00:20:31] Scott Galloway: This is like the venture capital community whoever comes up with two cents more. I'll make out with my cousin
[00:20:36] Scott Galloway: You didn't make out with your cousin did you I did and you know what he's a very good kisser
[00:20:40] Scott Galloway: Snow White asked her an AI for relationship advice. Yeah, and it responded maybe don't move in with seven dudes from Craigslist next time
[00:20:48] Scott Galloway: Um very fun. Yeah, okay. I don't
[00:20:54] Scott Galloway: This is why this is why two thirds of mergers don't work and it's playing out here
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_01: Will ring our hands but about about any trust about someone in the Gulf having undue influence over CNN around the Ellisons getting their nose so far up
[00:21:09] Scott Galloway: Trump's ass that they'll they'll guarantee that they'll just start filling
[00:21:14] Scott Galloway: CNN with Tucker Carlson on on 24 hour loop or something
[00:21:19] But this is why this acquisition will most likely fail from a shareholder perspective and that is one
[00:21:24] Scott Galloway: You have attended we have a tendency as an acquireer to over estimate synergies underestimate cultural impact and three more than anything
[00:21:33] testosterone gets involved and that is I can guarantee you then when all of these companies were looking at this
[00:21:40] Scott Galloway: This is a company that was trading at nine bucks to share recently seven. I thought it was it down at seven
[00:21:44] Kara Swisher: That all of these guys said okay
[00:21:47] Scare sass at it's one of a kind properties. We don't want this in the hands of competitors
[00:21:53] Wow, this is an opportunity to consolidate the streaming market in Netflix wow
[00:21:57] Scott Galloway: We really need this to bulk up paramount
[00:22:00] Scott Galloway: We could do great things with the cable and the streaming
[00:22:03] Scott Galloway: Comcast and we need something to re-ignite grow they all came up with really strong strategic reasons to stretch to
[00:22:10] Scott Galloway: All right, if we could get this for 19 maybe 20
[00:22:14] Scott Galloway: We can't go any higher than 24 from David Ellison right
[00:22:17] Kara Swisher: We can't go any higher than 24 and this is what happens right testosterone takes over
[00:22:22] Scott Galloway: It is it's like you like oh, we're only a couple bucks away
[00:22:26] Scott Galloway: Yeah from being king and taking the ultimate victory lap and pulling
[00:22:30] Scott Galloway: If Ellison
[00:22:32] Scott Galloway: Mass if he massively overpays for this thing yeah, every business cover will be the winner. Yeah, the winner
[00:22:39] Scott Galloway: Yeah, yeah, I will tie more than with Ted Turner and Steve case. Yeah, be kale
[00:22:43] Kara Swisher: Yeah, the winner what a deal of the century and Steve cases now like oh my god
[00:22:48] Scott Galloway: I just told this guy a bag of shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what David's that's all but these guys have already I can
[00:22:54] Scott Galloway: Promise you they have already blown way beyond a price they were absolutely never ever consider work
[00:23:01] Scott Galloway: They cannot it's just a rich. It's a yacht like it's a yacht. It's leaking and that's what he's bought
[00:23:06] Kara Swisher: I mean the problem is but but if you just on the face of it
[00:23:10] Kara Swisher: In terms of synergies concast or Netflix or the better buyers they have all like Netflix could blow out game of thrones
[00:23:15] Kara Swisher: They could blow out they have a world what you know the worldwide distribution network
[00:23:19] Kara Swisher: They they could do a lot with this and they all and they're shopping with with with with expensive stock
[00:23:25] Scott Galloway: They're credit card is fully loaded exactly right well not as expensive it was but
[00:23:29] Kara Swisher: They were the best owner is between these two by every single metric. They're the better owner
[00:23:34] Kara Swisher: And I know that are you mean in terms of synergy would you
[00:23:36] Scott Galloway: Synergy how it works what they're gonna they're not gonna do as many layoffs
[00:23:40] Kara Swisher: They have the and the only thing CBS this whole gang can do is is put together like
[00:23:47] Kara Swisher: Problematic assets and they don't have a plan for doing anything else. I mean the only thing that's happening is it mean
[00:23:54] Kara Swisher: As I said before
[00:23:56] Kara Swisher: David Ellison is is a very nice guy, but he's monumentally unqualified to do this that hasn't stopped him
[00:24:02] Kara Swisher: But he is the oldest boy with daddy's backing and and and that's the prescription for that
[00:24:09] Kara Swisher: Okay, also I don't think his movies made so much okay and and and and saslobs gonna walk away with a billion dollars
[00:24:16] Scott Galloway: For destroying value winner winner. I mean we can make a big and big can of winner and Netflix is in my view
[00:24:22] Scott Galloway: Who I love is is going to basically
[00:24:26] Scott Galloway: endgame
[00:24:28] Scott Galloway: Streaming and prices are gonna go. I think you can make an but here's the thing it it
[00:24:32] Scott Galloway: We don't get to decide
[00:24:34] Scott Galloway: Who would be qualitatively the best owner of the worst right the guy who runs AT&T is a really smart nice man
[00:24:42] Scott Galloway: I like him a lot he was probably the wrong owner for CNN. Yeah, I agree
[00:24:46] Kara Swisher: But he showed up with the biggest check so Jeff Bukas said congrats. It's yours that guy smart another smart guy
[00:24:53] Kara Swisher: He got out when they're getting good. Okay, hold on just a pause there
[00:24:56] Scott Galloway: But he did call Netflix the Albanians. Let's not let him forget that
[00:25:00] Scott Galloway: He made he made a one sentence stupid remark that's haunted him the rest of his life
[00:25:04] Scott Galloway: It's a really bad one. Let me but okay, but that is dwarfed by
[00:25:08] Scott Galloway: Guess who decided to sell magazines at their peak?
[00:25:10] Scott Galloway: He is guess who decided to sell the cable part of his company at the peak and by the way
[00:25:16] Scott Galloway: Guess who decided to sell the assets of of time of time Warner at their peak?
[00:25:22] Scott Galloway: Jeff fucking be a guess because this is Albanian this is where CEOs
[00:25:27] Yeah, where they're and I'm gonna differentiate between men and what I don't think Ruth Parat
[00:25:31] Scott Galloway: I think women are different than men and it's okay as long as you sanctify women and call on them predators nidia
[00:25:36] Scott Galloway: But I think on a certain level you would have to acknowledge if Ruth Parat was running these companies
[00:25:41] Scott Galloway: There's no fucking way should be at $34 a share
[00:25:44] Scott Galloway: She'd be she'd be like okay. I don't need to have the biggest dick and win this thing
[00:25:48] Scott Galloway: I'm here for shareholders. Yeah, and the thing that CEO's a really
[00:25:53] Scott Galloway: Not good at but they get all Jonesed up about
[00:25:57] Getting bigger and bigger and bigger the guy who ran b of a just kept acquiring everything and destroyed a ton of shareholder value
[00:26:03] Scott Galloway: What CEOs are not good at going back to my I'm gonna pat myself on the back
[00:26:08] Scott Galloway: I remember saying to Arthur Sosberg and then you're like why the fuck aren't we selling about calm?
[00:26:11] Scott Galloway: This is shit. This is shit business. We could sell it for a billion dollars right now
[00:26:15] Scott Galloway: But they wanted to access rise and analog outfit with digitally earrings
[00:26:19] Scott Galloway: CEOs are terrible. Yeah, selling assets of the right time. Why don't you give them David Zaslo at the same hand job?
[00:26:26] Kara Swisher: You're giving Jeff Buches here. Just curious
[00:26:29] Scott Galloway: Oh David David's doing his job, but but but Jeff Buches
[00:26:35] Scott Galloway: You know who probably made a hundred or two hundred million dollars made billions for shareholders. Yeah, Zasloff
[00:26:42] Scott Galloway: Has has basically said you fucked up investing in my company. You should invest in the S&P
[00:26:48] Scott Galloway: I'm barely gonna get your money back, but by the way, I'm gonna walk off with a billion dollars. Yeah, you're right
[00:26:52] Kara Swisher: If you barely get it
[00:26:55] Scott Galloway: If must create seven trillion dollars in incremental shareholder value at Tesla
[00:26:59] Scott Galloway: I've said this on record. I know I know I'm okay with him getting a trillion dollars if Bucha
[00:27:04] Scott Galloway: Mickey trucks. I remember when Mickey Drexel made a billion dollars at the gap and there was all this is in the 90s
[00:27:09] Scott Galloway: There was all this like hullabaloo and I'm like he's added 14 billion in shareholder value
[00:27:14] Scott Galloway: I agree the problem with Zasloff or Marissa Marissa mayor or Adam Newman is they walk off with hundreds of millions or billions
[00:27:22] Scott Galloway: For destroying shareholder value. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, I go. Okay. We'll see where this goes
[00:27:28] Kara Swisher: But I'll tell you cares where she goes out the door. Thank you. That is my speech
[00:27:32] Kara Swisher: By the way, somehow I don't think that's entered the discussion
[00:27:36] Scott Galloway: I'm just gonna loudly insult them the whole time until they fire me
[00:27:39] Kara Swisher: But I think they're gonna fire you. I think I know I'm actually the person they want to keep which is the worst part
[00:27:44] Kara Swisher: But I'm not gonna okay Scott. Let's go on a quick break. We come back the Trump administration's plan to use social media to gatekeep foreign visitors

[00:29:00] Scott we're back with more news this one. I just can't believe this the Trump administration wants to review foreign visitors social media history
[00:29:06] Kara Swisher: This is ahead of the the world cup coming here the plan would apply to citizens of 42 countries that are allowed to visit free travel to the US
[00:29:13] Kara Swisher: The list of countries includes the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Germany the prosal is not yet final in the US customs and border protection
[00:29:19] Kara Swisher: Says it will set 60 days of comments. I mean are you fucking kidding me they in the free speech nation
[00:29:26] Kara Swisher: um and and as you said are the numbers on visitors have declined so precipitously and has sort of hollowed out
[00:29:34] Kara Swisher: I can't believe they're even considering looking at people's social media
[00:29:39] Kara Swisher: Like what you fucking care if you think marker rubio is dickless, which I do and I will say on social media
[00:29:45] Kara Swisher: um this is insane from a business point of view correct
[00:29:50] Like with this obsession with manufacturing
[00:29:54] Where 80% of Americans think we need more manufacturing but only 20% of Americans have any interest in being in manufacturing
[00:30:00] Scott Galloway: You can't take your dog to the factory floor
[00:30:03] Scott Galloway: People don't want the for the most part people don't want to be in manufacturing
[00:30:07] Scott Galloway: This obsession with manufacturing and we do need a certain level of a manufacturing base
[00:30:11] Scott Galloway: But it needs to be advanced manufacturing high margin
[00:30:15] But the obsession is coming at the cost of an even better higher margin industry and that is the tourism business
[00:30:23] Scott Galloway: It's insane
[00:30:23] Scott Galloway: And so and I just so people can fill up our comments with calling me a fascist or a weirdo or whatever
[00:30:30] Scott Galloway: But that's every Tuesday, but go ahead. There you go
[00:30:32] Scott Galloway: I do believe if you are applying to come here and be a citizen or get a
[00:30:37] Scott Galloway: Visa or green card
[00:30:39] Scott Galloway: I think everything is open game
[00:30:41] Scott Galloway: Because what and young people let's be clear
[00:30:44] Scott Galloway: When you get a job at Goldman Sachs before you get the offer you apply for a job you know what they do
[00:30:49] Scott Galloway: They look at your social media
[00:30:52] And if they think you're an idiot that is going to embarrass them
[00:30:56] And you're you're saying misogynistic things or you're out just
[00:31:00] Scott Galloway: Rubbing your wealth and people's face or doing shots or acting like a total asshole. Guess what
[00:31:06] They will not give you a job. They also run credit checks on you
[00:31:10] Scott Galloway: So I there's a difference between not cut a call tourism where we benefit
[00:31:15] Scott Galloway: Vegas is dying and amongst there are two reasons Vegas is dying or a lot of reasons
[00:31:19] Scott Galloway: But one of them is we now moved we put Vegas in everyone's pocket
[00:31:23] Scott Galloway: Online betting Canadians were a huge source of
[00:31:27] Scott Galloway: Of revenue for for Vegas. They're out. They're like fuck you
[00:31:32] Scott Galloway: You're gonna treat us like assholes and take 70% of our exports which go to you and start playing
[00:31:37] Scott Galloway: Being reckless with our economic well-being
[00:31:40] Scott Galloway: We're done. Yeah, so this is yet another reason, but what who would even think of this?
[00:31:45] Kara Swisher: This is like where's by the way?
[00:31:47] Kara Swisher: The first to me which is what we're becoming literally the first fucking amendment
[00:31:52] Kara Swisher: It says you can say whatever you think like you know
[00:31:55] Kara Swisher: He also tweeted that if you said he's apparently in
[00:31:59] Kara Swisher: Candescent over your time. The first amendment though
[00:32:02] Scott Galloway: I'm sorry. They should be able to say anything they want about the United States of America on social media period
[00:32:08] Kara Swisher: Period full stock. Okay, but but do we have an obligation to let them in? I don't I yes
[00:32:13] Kara Swisher: Yes, we do. It's just words. That's just words. They're not like I'm asking this to learn not to make a comment
[00:32:19] Scott Galloway: Does the first amendment apply to people coming in temporarily? I don't care it replies to our whole ethos like if you want it to
[00:32:26] Kara Swisher: Keep people out. I'm I'm coming to New York and then I'm gonna commit a terrorist attack
[00:32:31] Scott Galloway: I'm not talking about committing a terrorist attack saying Donald Trump is an orange not see is fine. Hold on hold on hold on
[00:32:38] I'm high. I'm coming into the US. Why are you here?
[00:32:43] Well, it says on social media that you are a back to activate a terrorist cell and commit acts of terror while you
[00:32:49] Scott Galloway: Were here on US soil. You think that's first amendment free speech? No, that's not what it's about
[00:32:53] Kara Swisher: It's they're gonna review their foreign visitors
[00:32:56] Kara Swisher: So the only reason I'm pairing this together is because he was in Candescent over in New York Times
[00:33:01] Kara Swisher: Peace he is a care according to white house people that I talked to he's like lost his mind
[00:33:05] Kara Swisher: Where the New York Times basically said he's old and probably you know essentially has frontal lobe dementia
[00:33:09] Kara Swisher: Which I think we all can all after the performance of the last two days you're going a bit off script here
[00:33:14] Scott Galloway: But okay, this is what he said anyone who says I'm sick is a traitor
[00:33:19] Kara Swisher: And could be tried for sedition essentially is what he said agree words
[00:33:24] Kara Swisher: Words don't count and I just I look if that's different Kara no no if they come in and they have threatened this on social media
[00:33:32] Kara Swisher: Then we stop them we look through their bags. We say we're gonna follow them all we still let them in
[00:33:37] Kara Swisher: I'm sorry. It's just words. It's like what if it's a teenager doing it. What if it's some angry grandma?
[00:33:43] Kara Swisher: We can make those we can make those judgment calls, but I don't think I don't think everyone
[00:33:48] Scott Galloway: I don't think everyone anyone I don't think Americans have a birthright to live in New York
[00:33:52] Scott Galloway: If it's too expensive you leave
[00:33:54] Scott Galloway: I don't think people have a birthright to just throw up their arm unfortunately and say asylum and gain entry into the US
[00:34:00] Scott Galloway: And I don't think it's people's birthright to come in for whatever reason if they have a history and statements
[00:34:05] Scott Galloway: That's appear to be a threat and are gonna cost us more energy and money to track these people because we perceive there a real threat
[00:34:11] Scott Galloway: Having said that
[00:34:13] Scott Galloway: I think the bar has to be pretty fucking low to gain entry to come in and spend money and if you've said some
[00:34:19] Scott Galloway: anti-American things on your social media
[00:34:21] Scott Galloway: Okay, we should be able to assess how serious a threat it is and the bar needs to be
[00:34:27] Scott Galloway: I don't know really high really low, but if you've said some anti-American things
[00:34:30] Scott Galloway: That's probably 70% of anyone who has a social media account and the economic benefit in the brand America
[00:34:37] Scott Galloway: When people come to America, guess what they have a really good time and they like us and they find out on the whole
[00:34:42] Scott Galloway: People who are Republicans and Democrats are pretty decent people and then they go back and say hey, maybe someday
[00:34:48] Scott Galloway: Let's go back to Disney or if our kid wants to go to college in the US or if a US company comes here
[00:34:54] Scott Galloway: Maybe I'll do business with them. We have a vested economic and strategic and military interest
[00:34:59] Scott Galloway: Best in interest in letting people come and see how wonderful America is but I think what you were doing was a very
[00:35:04] Kara Swisher: Edge case of a thing they already were aware of those we
[00:35:08] Kara Swisher: Someone who calls more and shitler come on in like who cares like who the fuck cares
[00:35:13] Kara Swisher: And they don't need to investigate that person if they don't have a history or record of crime
[00:35:17] Kara Swisher: Which they already know before by the way they know
[00:35:20] Kara Swisher: The bad people that come in for the most part. It's not a secret. It's not some grandma from Germany
[00:35:26] Kara Swisher: Like give me a break. I mean, it's only one step to what he was saying very explicitly if you say I'm old and sick
[00:35:33] Kara Swisher: You're a trader your guess what you're old and you're sick
[00:35:36] Kara Swisher: And I think you have pre- you know frontal
[00:35:39] Kara Swisher: Dimension low dementia. I come and get me. I don't know what else to say
[00:35:43] Kara Swisher: Anyway, speaking of which president Trump kicked off a series of really
[00:35:47] Kara Swisher: unusual speeches for him even because he seemed rather low energy and
[00:35:52] Kara Swisher: Meandering intended to ease the cost of living it's by mocking affordability
[00:35:57] Kara Swisher: Let's listen to a clip of the speech in Pennsylvania this week
[00:36:00] Kara Swisher: But they have a new word, you know, they always have a hoax the new word is affordability
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_00: So they look at the camera and they say this election is all about affordability
[00:36:13] Now they'd ever talk about it
[00:36:15] Yeah, they're talking about it now sir
[00:36:17] Kara Swisher: He got distracted by some of the crowd telling him to run for four more years during the speech also suggested marriage
[00:36:22] Kara Swisher: Missed you by less pencils and dolls from overseas. That's an old trope. He was
[00:36:26] Kara Swisher: Doing um, he was quite I mean
[00:36:29] Kara Swisher: I don't think he has Alzheimer's
[00:36:31] Kara Swisher: I think he has this frontal look because you get more aggressive and more
[00:36:34] Kara Swisher: fanciful with that one
[00:36:36] Kara Swisher: A valetimers is a forgetting disease really
[00:36:39] Kara Swisher: Um, but this idea of you can get your dolls elsewhere
[00:36:43] Kara Swisher: by less pencils
[00:36:46] Kara Swisher: Nobody cares about affordability. They must be
[00:36:48] Kara Swisher: They must be beside themselves in the White House that he's doing this
[00:36:52] He ran on affordability
[00:36:55] Scott Galloway: And 57% of voters
[00:36:57] Scott Galloway: Ability sorry
[00:36:58] Kara Swisher: 57% of voters and uh, uh, agree the Trump was losing the battle against inflation
[00:37:03] Scott Galloway: 68% believe that the economy is poor or very poor and according to a recent political poll
[00:37:09] Um, get this 27% percent of respondents have skipped a medical checkup because of the costs
[00:37:17] Scott Galloway: Because of costs have uh, accelerating in the last two years a quarter have skipped a prescription a third
[00:37:23] Said they could not afford to attend a professional sports event with their family or friends and almost half said
[00:37:28] Scott Galloway: They can't pay for a vacation that involves air travel
[00:37:31] Scott Galloway: I mean, this is the problem neither Democrats or Republicans want to have a serious fucking conversation around affordability
[00:37:37] Scott Galloway: Republicans want to tear off
[00:37:39] Scott Galloway: Democrats want to throw money at people to say we'll we'll short-term solve your problem
[00:37:44] Scott Galloway: The structural the structural answers to inflation and affordability are really boring and America
[00:37:49] Scott Galloway: The American public doesn't seem to want to elect people are willing to have these conversations
[00:37:53] Scott Galloway: The things that drive inflation you you start with the shit that drives the CPI
[00:37:57] Scott Galloway: 40% unfortunately
[00:37:59] Scott Galloway: Of middle-income homes now it's going towards housing
[00:38:01] Scott Galloway: We need and you've said this we need a massive increase in housing
[00:38:05] Scott Galloway: The next biggest cost in terms of acceleration the two and three are education and health care
[00:38:10] Scott Galloway: We need national medicine or socialized medicine and we need tuition caps based on income of the household
[00:38:16] Scott Galloway: But no one wants to talk about and we need massive antitrust
[00:38:20] Scott Galloway: Well, it's also it's also food though Scott. I mean, I was noticing and I have
[00:38:24] Kara Swisher: I I
[00:38:26] Kara Swisher: I've plenty money to buy food, but I was in a store the other day and the the
[00:38:31] The the chicken sandwich was eight dollars and Amanda saw one two eight nine dollars like for just a basic chicken and I was like
[00:38:38] Kara Swisher: That's like less more than minimum wage like everything like even the most basic stuff is more than minimum wage and
[00:38:46] Kara Swisher: I I don't know I don't pay attention prices as much as I should sometimes I do sometimes I don't but
[00:38:51] Kara Swisher: Boy do you notice them now?
[00:38:53] Kara Swisher: Because you're like what the question is I
[00:38:56] Scott Galloway: You're saying what everyone will agree with right and that is the rent is too damn high
[00:39:01] Scott Galloway: You know remember that mayoral candidate. Yeah, we all agree the question is what do we do about it?
[00:39:06] And the answer is in my view if you're talking about a chicken sandwich
[00:39:09] Scott Galloway: There are three companies controlling the majority of the poultry market
[00:39:13] There are two few
[00:39:15] Scott Galloway: grocers and too much regulation
[00:39:17] Scott Galloway: And too in too much red tape that increases the cost of
[00:39:21] Scott Galloway: Of grocery prices you need more competition. There are literally seven food companies responsible
[00:39:28] Scott Galloway: For the vast majority of our food products right now. We need more we need dramatically more but from a marketing point of view him making fun of it
[00:39:36] Kara Swisher: I don't even understand what the theory is here except that he is
[00:39:40] Kara Swisher: Frontal low dementia. I don't know what else he could say. I don't I don't think it's fair to say as dementia or Alzheimer
[00:39:46] Scott Galloway: What I think it's fair to say is he suffers from an ailment that is very obvious and is true. He suffers from 79
[00:39:53] And we just should not have a person with a finger on the button trying to figure out terror policy trying to figure out
[00:39:59] Scott Galloway: You know our relationship with the CCP and what ship should go and the threat they present long term
[00:40:04] Scott Galloway: What do you think of him doing this trying to make it a not a thing?
[00:40:09] It's totally ineffective. It's pilloried for much less by saying it totally totally ineffective
[00:40:14] Scott Galloway: I'm glad he's doing it because I think it plays into our hands
[00:40:16] Scott Galloway: But at some point
[00:40:18] Scott Galloway: The counter to that can't be just what a fucking idiot is okay agreed
[00:40:22] Scott Galloway: It's all right affordability requires an adult conversation and long-term structural solutions
[00:40:27] Scott Galloway: Are we ready for an adult conversation around housing medical care
[00:40:31] Scott Galloway: To wish and cost and antitrust and the democracy. Although I don't think maqeem is about that
[00:40:34] Kara Swisher: We're the Democrats having this conversation outside of Senator Klobuchar who's actually having this conversation
[00:40:39] Scott Galloway: For Democrats who I have on raging moderates. I'll say the same thing
[00:40:43] Scott Galloway: This is an important conversation that we need to have at the right moment, but right now
[00:40:47] Scott Galloway: Let's make sure we get the office you know ACA subsidies. All right. I get it
[00:40:51] Scott Galloway: Well, that's a cost like you're like you don't buy insurance, but mine is gonna go up quite a bit
[00:40:57] Kara Swisher: Like and it was it was remark it was like what could it go up to and he was agree. It's insane
[00:41:03] Scott Galloway: It was like American households have medical or dental debt right but okay, so
[00:41:08] Scott Galloway: We we have a series of band-aid ideas, but no one wants to talk about a structural reform and healthcare because the healthcare industrial complex is the biggest donor
[00:41:19] Scott Galloway: To Pax I just gave a bunch of money to a young woman who just announced her campaign for Senate and her
[00:41:27] Scott Galloway: Well pretty easy to figure out. Okay. Yeah. I saw you online. You like call me Jasmine
[00:41:32] Yeah, I am literally like watching my parents argue
[00:41:35] Scott Galloway: I love
[00:41:37] Scott Galloway: Love Jasmine. Cricket anyways. Yeah, should we invite both of them to South by Southwest beyond stage with us for I would love that
[00:41:43] Kara Swisher: Let's try that. I think James. We'd like to have you both on stage. I think they're both outstanding
[00:41:52] Scott Galloway: Anyways, but I heard from someone on her staff saying we'll try and find time for you to meet with the representative
[00:41:58] Scott Galloway: I'm like no
[00:41:59] Scott Galloway: A people people with my demographic have way too much fucking influence already
[00:42:03] Scott Galloway: I am sending this money with one directive keep
[00:42:07] Scott Galloway: Keep an on girl. Yeah, keep doing what you're doing. I like to see her slap you back to last Sunday
[00:42:13] Kara Swisher: As my own
[00:42:15] Kara Swisher: That's what you're here for it's
[00:42:17] Kara Swisher: Totally take the her announcement video was great. I like him too. I love to announce my video
[00:42:23] Scott Galloway: People are worried about that was for each other. I don't I think that's fine everyone's like oh we blow on the same like no
[00:42:28] Kara Swisher: Young people like how are you?
[00:42:30] Scott Galloway: We need to give follows Instagram models which I love which I love I love a guy who talks about Jesus and then is following
[00:42:37] Scott Galloway: Radikowski did ask about him anyway, let's go on a quick break
[00:42:41] Kara Swisher: You know I expose myself and you jab play with my emotions. I got so much dope
[00:42:47] Scott Galloway: But when you said you know Emily Radikowski and I was waiting for the end to say that she's done
[00:42:51] Scott Galloway: That's about you so when we come back we'll talk about Australia's new social media band for teens
[00:42:57] Kara Swisher: Scott we're back. It might be time for us to move down under Australia's become the first country in the world to ban kids under 16 from using social media
[00:43:04] Kara Swisher: Instagram TikTok snapchat read it and several other platforms face fines of up to $33 million if they don't take reasonable steps to remove underage users
[00:43:12] Kara Swisher: Of course Aussie teens are already finding work runs of course they are creating accounts with fake ages using less popular apps
[00:43:17] Kara Swisher: Needed taking the government to court fine. Well, and good. That's what that's what teens are therefore and here in the US
[00:43:23] Kara Swisher: The Florida law banning social media accounts for kids under 14 is going to affect after surviving a court challenge
[00:43:28] Kara Swisher: I got to say I agree with that idiot remember him down in Florida
[00:43:32] Kara Swisher: To Santa's on this this works. Well the rest of the world follow now just for let me just say we have Facebook and met a hard time
[00:43:39] Kara Swisher: And by the way, they are not keeping young people safe no matter what they say
[00:43:44] Kara Swisher: Tim Cook was on Capitol Hill this week lobbying against legislation that requires platforms to authenticate
[00:43:49] Kara Swisher: Um users age pushing instead
[00:43:52] Kara Swisher: Put the burden on parents
[00:43:54] Kara Swisher: You know that both meta and they are arguing of who's to responsible
[00:43:57] Kara Swisher: I think they're both responsible the whether the phones are or the
[00:44:01] Kara Swisher: social media sites but putting it on parents when they make these products is just not it is just I find
[00:44:09] Kara Swisher: Really shameful for Tim Cook to do, but I know why he's doing it. I just find it shameful. Go ahead
[00:44:14] Kara Swisher: We just gave back in one move or I should say the Australian government their leadership just gave back
[00:44:22] This is the most generous a creative gift to kids likely in Australian history
[00:44:28] Scott Galloway: Uh, they're time with their friends
[00:44:31] Scott Galloway: their self-esteem
[00:44:33] They're time outside their time playing sports their time with their parents their ability to navigate
[00:44:39] Scott Galloway: relationship and parent and person their ability to focus
[00:44:43] Scott Galloway: On their schoolwork their test scores
[00:44:46] The Australian government just gave back more childhood to children than any single legislation
[00:44:52] Scott Galloway: I think passed in the West in the last decade and
[00:44:56] And I just want to call out I think the most influential scholar in the world right now is my colleague Jonathan Hight
[00:45:01] Scott Galloway: I just don't think this what happened without his book the anxious generation it might it might have happened
[00:45:06] Scott Galloway: But it wouldn't have we have happened as soon
[00:45:08] And I hope that it ignites an absolute firestorm of and they say well, it's about parenting. Oh, fuck you Tim Cook
[00:45:16] Scott Galloway: Do you think it's parenting
[00:45:19] That that bars should be able to serve my kid alcohol
[00:45:23] Kara Swisher: And then it's up to me to make sure that he never gets access to alcohol
[00:45:26] Scott Galloway: Some of your responses, otherwise Tim Cook doesn't have children's there are the difficulty of
[00:45:30] Kara Swisher: Okay, and here's the problem parenting. Okay
[00:45:34] Scott Galloway: You don't have children when you say that yeah, you don't that's not that unless it's a collective action unless every 15 year old is off snap
[00:45:42] Scott Galloway: You move in with parenting and you managed to figure out a way to use custodial or custodial and get them off snap and guess what
[00:45:49] Scott Galloway: They're more depressed as my other colleague Adam Ulter did research around this because they're ostracized because they're the only ones not on
[00:45:57] Scott Galloway: Snap so unless this is collective action through legislation and this is my favorite argument from meta
[00:46:03] Scott Galloway: That they're violating the first amendment rights. You know what a 14 year old doesn't need to know
[00:46:06] Scott Galloway: We don't need to know what a 14 year old thinks about mRNA vaccines. I'm sorry
[00:46:11] Scott Galloway: This is such an insane argument that it's that they're worried about the free speech
[00:46:16] Scott Galloway: And they say this is nothing but the following this is Joe camel
[00:46:20] Scott Galloway: It was shown that the tobacco industry had a series of cartoon-like characters to try and incorporate new people into their addiction
[00:46:26] Scott Galloway: Which would continue to kill our sisters
[00:46:29] Scott Galloway: And our brothers and our our mothers and they said sorry
[00:46:33] Scott Galloway: You don't get to feed the pipeline with cartoon-like characters
[00:46:36] Scott Galloway: Nor should social media at a minimum be allowed to spread this depression
[00:46:42] Scott Galloway: This disassociation and the sequestration from life and family my fear. I would love to think this ignites
[00:46:49] Scott Galloway: Similar bands around the world. I'm hopefully does but the problem is
[00:46:53] Scott Galloway: In America we are falling to this delusion that we are democracy. We're not
[00:46:58] Scott Galloway: We have a passive majority that is weaponized and influenced by a very activated sophisticated well-funded
[00:47:05] Scott Galloway: Special interest groups. Yes, and the special interest group around tech
[00:47:09] Kara Swisher: Well, the special interest group around tech is only second to the health industrial complex in terms of money
[00:47:15] Scott Galloway: And maybe number one right now because the entire economy and the Trump administration is making a big bet on AI
[00:47:21] Scott Galloway: So these people have so much fucking
[00:47:24] Scott Galloway: We have minority rural areas that are the worst for Americans health care and social media among the worst
[00:47:30] Kara Swisher: 100 biggest biggest lobbyists that is in there. Let me just say I agree
[00:47:36] Kara Swisher: Parents should get off their phones when they're when front of their kids. They should do won't be more present for kids
[00:47:42] Kara Swisher: Absolutely, they should be more interested in what they're doing online
[00:47:46] Kara Swisher: But it is incredible. It is it's too hard to use and it's not your fault parents. This is made
[00:47:52] Kara Swisher: I have a hard time
[00:47:54] Kara Swisher: Monitoring the I had a hard time monitoring these things
[00:47:57] Kara Swisher: But I did it, but it was very it was very difficult and the tools suck
[00:48:02] Kara Swisher: So this is their responsibility to make it so put warning labels on these things
[00:48:09] Kara Swisher: Explain this to kids and and again, I agree parents should not be on their foot like you have to sort of
[00:48:15] You know
[00:48:16] Kara Swisher: Pattern map for kids on stuff like that ignoring them and looking at your phones is one of those things
[00:48:22] Kara Swisher: And so there is a parental obligation here, but for the most part
[00:48:27] Kara Swisher: That this is that is on them all of them and it's really
[00:48:30] Kara Swisher: Repulsive that all these companies have constantly
[00:48:34] Kara Swisher: Abrogated their responsibilities of their shoddy products no matter how you do it and they are able to do it
[00:48:39] Kara Swisher: And I know they put in all this what if finding people privacy?
[00:48:43] Kara Swisher: I don't care figure it out your smart people
[00:48:45] Kara Swisher: So and you're making a ton of money so I'm sure you could spend some time
[00:48:48] Kara Swisher: Well, just let's start
[00:48:49] Kara Swisher: You
[00:48:51] Kara Swisher: All right, so Instagrammer and $4 billion this year from teens age 13 to 17 they make
[00:48:58] Scott Galloway: Platforms are gonna earn about 13 billion dollars from kids under 18 to 2022 which translates to about
[00:49:04] Scott Galloway: I don't know somewhere between a hundred billion and a quarter of a trillion dollars
[00:49:07] Scott Galloway: So what do you know they're worried about the first amendment rights
[00:49:10] Scott Galloway: 53% of children now own a smartphone by age 11 that has doubled since 2015
[00:49:16] Scott Galloway: 3 quarters of children aged two to five
[00:49:20] Scott Galloway: Engaged with YouTube regularly and teen spend five hours a day on social media
[00:49:25] Scott Galloway: Where do you think that five hours has come from about 35% of their waking hours outside of school and age gating
[00:49:32] Scott Galloway: Guess what folks we age gate bars and restaurants serving alcohol convenient stores gas stations smoke shops tobacco
[00:49:39] Scott Galloway: Cannabis industries can't drive to succino sports books the DMV online gambling sites pornography
[00:49:46] Scott Galloway: Firearm retailers can Australia run the US. Yes, I would like they ban firearms
[00:49:52] Kara Swisher: They have a super return funds and for yeah, they're very tough they go out into the they go out by the way
[00:49:58] Kara Swisher: I'm going there I'm going there. I'm going to holidays. Oh no, he's a lot of Sydney
[00:50:03] Kara Swisher: lizard island great parrots. They are this year. I'm going for my nephews my nephew live that I'm going for his wedding next year

[00:50:15] Kara Swisher: It's a wonderful place. I love us. Right. They've got
[00:50:18] Kara Swisher: Miri to problems, but not other problems
[00:50:20] Kara Swisher: But I got to say this was a winter for these people all right Scott one more quick break. We'll be right back
[00:50:26] Kara Swisher: Okay, Scott. We're new something a little different today time just announced it's person of the year

[00:50:36] Kara Swisher: Sam Altman Johnson Wang faith-fagley and a few others
[00:50:40] Kara Swisher: Um, let me ask you who would you have picked as the time person things slash thing of the year
[00:50:49] And I really I'm thought about I mean, I can tell you what like my
[00:50:53] Scott Galloway: I would have loved if they picked McKenzie Bezos for a new type of giving um excellent choice. There you go
[00:50:59] Scott Galloway: Uh, I like that seven billion dollars. She's given away this year. Yeah. Yeah
[00:51:04] Scott Galloway: There's definitely a different approach to what I'll call feminine giving versus masculine giving though
[00:51:09] Scott Galloway: The I think the woman won the Nobel Peace Prize is gonna play a seminal role. I think Maduro is gonna be
[00:51:15] Scott Galloway: I think we're gonna have regime change in Venezuela. I don't know. Let them do it themselves. That's my feeling. But go ahead 100% 100% but he anyway. We'll I won't go there but
[00:51:24] Scott Galloway: um
[00:51:26] Give me a 30 seconds. Who would you pick? I like McKenzie. I think but can see Scott and Miss Kenzie Scott is earning a full
[00:51:32] Kara Swisher: Maybe she doesn't use Bezos anymore um, I would pick
[00:51:36] Kara Swisher: I'm gonna go pop culture actually
[00:51:39] Kara Swisher: I would pick uh kpop demon hunters because no I would I would here's why because I think
[00:51:45] Kara Swisher: You know, I know you didn't you don't pay attention to cultural things as much as you but
[00:51:50] Kara Swisher: I like culture Cara. I love it. And so
[00:51:52] Kara Swisher: Ks. I buy brand admittables. That's about what happened at the Macy's parade which everybody loved and made everybody feel good
[00:51:58] Kara Swisher: Was a moment and in the center of that was a moment of let's all like stop this hatefulness
[00:52:03] Kara Swisher: Let's be interesting. Let's have all different. There was country people. There was all kinds of people there
[00:52:08] Kara Swisher: Like it wasn't like it wasn't woke. It was just America. I felt really good about it, right?
[00:52:14] Kara Swisher: um
[00:52:15] Kara Swisher: I think they represent a lot of things that I think we have to get back to which is
[00:52:21] Kara Swisher: um
[00:52:22] Kara Swisher: Which is the idea that different the difference is okay. You shouldn't hide yourself
[00:52:27] Kara Swisher: um
[00:52:28] Kara Swisher: The good feeling about this country in this world like feeling good about that we are
[00:52:34] Kara Swisher: um
[00:52:35] Kara Swisher: We can be I'm not a religious person that we can be saved there. There's a grace. There's amazing grace and that's what that the music there and I it's played on
[00:52:44] Kara Swisher: Cont any parent and there's Spotify playlist or whatever the year whatever music it's Kpop demon hunters
[00:52:50] Kara Swisher: Which is amazing because kids are really responding to it and so it's not just it's not just the song gold and it's not just
[00:52:58] Kara Swisher: You know take down and everything else. It's a complex look at how difficult it is
[00:53:03] Kara Swisher: deal with differences and
[00:53:05] Kara Swisher: I just I find it to be one of the most moving
[00:53:09] Kara Swisher: cultural moments this year is and you know
[00:53:11] Kara Swisher: I want to pick tellers with in favor of a feeling which I loved but uh
[00:53:15] Kara Swisher: I think it i think it's a really you can see people as they listen to it
[00:53:20] Kara Swisher: um, and I know it sounds dumb, but you remember Ted and Bill and Ted's excellent adventure when they become the band that brings the
[00:53:26] Kara Swisher: The their whole thing is in the future. They become this band. What was it called horse or whatever
[00:53:32] Kara Swisher: um, which was funny, but that's what I felt like with this movie. It's like this could this unites people in a way
[00:53:39] Kara Swisher: I'd find very lovely and so I would pick Kpop demon hunters. Thank you
[00:53:43] Did you know my big uh, in why you want to bring this back to me?
[00:53:48] Scott Galloway: I know I don't like to talk about you know, I don't like to talk about myself care, but
[00:53:51] Scott Galloway: There was something called why you and I joined one of like 30 years old in San Francisco
[00:53:55] Scott Galloway: Which is supposed to be a feeder into yp. Oh and you get a mentor the best part of it is you get a mentor who's a yp. Oh
[00:54:01] And my mentor was the runner up for or one of the runner-ups for a person of the year
[00:54:07] At times person of the year and it was Bob Swanson do you remember him?
[00:54:10] Scott Galloway: No, no, he was the founder of Genentech. Oh, okay. All right. And he met me. That was great. Whatever you call it
[00:54:17] Kara Swisher: We met and um, the the loveliest guy. I mean, this is a guy very busy, right?
[00:54:24] Scott Galloway: And he said
[00:54:25] Scott Galloway: We met we had lunch and he said and I said I had just started profit this brand
[00:54:29] Scott Galloway: This strategy firm
[00:54:31] Scott Galloway: And he said would you he goes how can I be the most helpful? I'm like, you know, I sort of know what I'm doing
[00:54:36] Scott Galloway: But I really don't he said I have an idea
[00:54:38] Scott Galloway: I'll just I'll just shadow you for a day
[00:54:41] Yeah, he
[00:54:43] Scott Galloway: Met me in my office actually
[00:54:45] Scott Galloway: Met me at the gym. I worked out every day from seven to eight
[00:54:47] Scott Galloway: He met me at the gym pick me up took me him off and he just shadowed me for a full day
[00:54:52] Scott Galloway: meetings client meetings and he's a fairly like
[00:54:55] Scott Galloway: Kind of quiet like not he was sort of like like you know shorter guy
[00:55:00] Scott Galloway: Carried a few extra pounds just sort of kind of I don't think blended in obviously a genius
[00:55:06] Scott Galloway: And he he just shadowed me the whole day and at the end of the day he sat me down and he taken a bunch of notes
[00:55:12] And he said okay great leaders listen more than they talk you are not a great leader yet
[00:55:18] Scott Galloway: You want to impress everybody you're talking too much
[00:55:21] Scott Galloway: He he said he had all these things that have stuck with me my whole life
[00:55:25] Scott Galloway: He said he said you don't understand the difference between being right and being effective
[00:55:30] Scott Galloway: He's like you're right a lot, but you're too aggressive and you're turning off people you got to think about how am I effective here
[00:55:38] Scott Galloway: And he just gave me a series of things
[00:55:40] Scott Galloway: Anyways, that was my my my mentor story. Oh my god. That's a wonderful story
[00:55:46] Oh, you know who I would pick just to stick my finger and Putin's eyes. I'd pick Navalny
[00:55:51] Ah
[00:55:52] That's a great idea
[00:55:54] Yeah, there's all kinds of people. I you know this is sort of an antiquated thing the person of the year
[00:55:57] Kara Swisher: But it's still kind of kind of works because it makes you think about things
[00:56:00] Kara Swisher: Mm-hmm. So anyway, we do not think the architects of AI deserve it
[00:56:05] Kara Swisher: Um, I don't at least I think there's a much more uplifting story about to happen over the next year
[00:56:10] Kara Swisher: Such a snooze
[00:56:12] I'm telling you it is I know architects
[00:56:14] Kara Swisher: It's a pretty not so realistically who it should be what it should probably be Jensen Huang
[00:56:19] Scott Galloway: I hate it when they have multiple people are they don't
[00:56:21] Scott Galloway: No, we're just able to wear his coat and act like a lesbian and kiss up to Trump. No, he's built a pretty important kind of thing
[00:56:28] Scott Galloway: But I'm not I like time will tell as they say anyway
[00:56:32] Kara Swisher: You've got to get going because you arrived late and you've got to leave early, but um
[00:56:37] Kara Swisher: I we want to hear from you send us your questions about business tech or whatever's on your mind go to nmy mag dot com slash pivot
[00:56:42] Kara Swisher: Just met a question for the show we're called 85551
[00:56:45] Kara Swisher: pivot uh, elsewhere in the caron scott universe this week on pro proffede conversation scott spoke with Tristan Harris
[00:56:52] Kara Swisher: former google design ethicist and co-founder of the center for you main technology. I know him well
[00:56:56] Kara Swisher: He's fantastic. Let's listen to a clip the us beat china to the technology of social media
[00:57:02] Did that make us stronger or did that make us weaker?
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_01: If you beat an adversary to a technology, but that you then don't govern in a in a wise way
[00:57:12] SPEAKER_01: And you said like you built this gun you flip it around you blow your own brain off
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_01: Which is what we did the social media we have the worst critical thinking test scores
[00:57:20] SPEAKER_01: You know mental health anxious depressed generation in history
