[00:00:00] When they go to meet with the president the only thing they repeat over in their heads over and over is don't forget to swallow
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_02: Right, but they get what they want
[00:00:13] Hi everyone. This is pivot from New York magazine in the Vox Media podcast network. I'm Cara swisher and Scott was late for my birthday
[00:00:22] So look this is a big one 73
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_02: It's not 73
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_02: That's you my friend. I'm much younger than you. Yeah, I'm much younger than you by like two months. I'm much younger than you
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_02: In plus plus for men 60 is the new 40 and for women 30 is the new 80
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_02: What does that make me happy? Let's talk happy birthday Cara? I
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_02: Mean you literally are the longest serving tech journalist
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_02: I remember the first interview you did about technology was talking to the guy on vented fire
[00:00:58] That was a good technology that's good. That was a hell of a good technology
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_02: I mean we've got a lot to get to G. D. or when you when you interviewed that company the hot of startup that it started the sink
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_02: All the electricity right
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_02: I got that very what else what else dirt when I invented when I talked to the guy invented
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_04: You're so old you interviewed Zuckerberg back when he had human emotions
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_03: So that's not true anyway, we got a lot to get to today
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_04: There is a lot to get to including Trump calling affordability a hoax
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_04: Which is not a good idea Australia's new social media ban
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_04: So much there's so much going on
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_04: But first dizzy just announced a one billion dollar equity investment in open-air and will allow users to make videos with its characters on Sora
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_04: Characters available through the deal will include Mickey Mouse and Cinderella as well as frozen
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_04: Are the agreements do not include any talent likeness or voices mean the people like the John Cena's whoever did if be able to learn their movies
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_04: Scott I don't want to know what you want to make Mickey Mouse do
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_04: But what what do you think of this? This is interesting. I actually texted I go look at you mr. Tech and
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_04: But it was interesting sort of especially since open air really needs a win right now
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_04: Which we'll go into in a minute, but any thoughts on this?
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_04: I think it's smart both of them
[00:02:20] I probably would have well
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_02: Disney gets to do what it wants, but I probably would have gone with Google but in Gemini, but
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_02: I think it's smart. Disney needs some AI tech
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_02: Pixie dust over a company that is I mean literally
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_02: Iger is the guy that decided to volunteer to go back to Vietnam and he's he's getting you know
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_02: He's getting a shot shot up everywhere. Yeah, he's asked for act is the expression
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, instead he could just be sitting on a beach somewhere heckling from the cheap seats about the new CEO facing all this bullshit
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_02: But anyways, he's back, but to do to announce this is a great press release or Disney the RP and the characters are really interesting
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_02: It'll be interesting to see what they do. I don't know if it amounts to anything
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think all these people will be doing these deals right like there's not a media company
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_04: I thought Joanna Stern was fun. Asia goes look at this hype is in it need wouldn't you think my bubbles complete
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_04: Which was cute. There's so many good jokes. What's weird is they they did sort of their
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_02: What I'll call their tired characters. I mean Mickey Mouse and Cinderella. I I sort of get well
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's because I'm just I've aged out of that shit, but no their old ones my kids
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_04: No Mickey Mouse and they do like Cinderella with Clara like Cinderella
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_04: But the main characters of the new ones like the frozen characters or
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_04: Moana. Yeah, Moana's one they're coming out with live versions of I think
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_04: There's a new frozen coming out in 2026 and I think the live version of Moana's coming out. There's there's a trailer for it
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_04: Um, but yeah, and I yes, yes, I would agree with you. I don't think they're picking the most recent characters
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_04: Um, the kids today like but they're classics, right
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_04: Right
[00:04:02] This is this is a this is smart for both of them. I don't know if it's going to mount anything
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_02: But it's a good press release
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's smart and it the question is or what I would want to know
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_02: Is does it end up being?
[00:04:17] some sort of
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_02: Supporting evidence for why open AI should not be using other characters and identities when they're willing to pay for these ones
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_02: But not others just depends on what I would use all like what's the difference
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_04: You're in for a dime you're in for a dollar people are stealing it anyway. I want to have it licensed and get money from it
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_04: I don't know it just seems like looking this is inevitable that there be they're either going to steal it and one thing that happened with YouTube is it
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_04: As a you know as it took too long right to do what is now very lucrative for everybody right and the question is who is it more lucrative for but it's inevitable
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_04: And so I think you know youtube could have done it sooner and the companies instead of member Philly Philly down and did the lawsuit
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_04: Um, they were gonna steal it anyway guys. So figure out a way you can do a deal with them
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_04: And I think a lot of them including tiktok is open to doing deals with is wanting and open to doing deals with these companies
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_04: And they should as long as they're it protects the right it puts you in partnership with them to get rid of
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_04: Cheaters I guess
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I don't know the the whole Disney
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure it's it's just so unrealistic and
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_02: And bias against men like snow white lived in the woods with seven men and somehow none of them were
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_02: Somehow none of them were emotionally available and by the way the big moral lesson from Aladdin is that that does wrong
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_02: Unless you're hot and have a pet monkey with main character energy
[00:05:41] Do you know when you watch that they still have that this is a really tasteless movie
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_04: Warning on it when you watch it which is interesting like you know depictions of air figures and stuff like that
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, same thing on
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_04: There's a couple of movies like that when I was just watching
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_04: I have to say though one that you put the older ones up
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_04: Clara loves mermaid she loves Cinderella she loves snow white she likes the new snow white the old snow white
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_04: Anyway um, uh, and you know when he poos the original influencer
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_02: He's he's naked addicted to honey and lives at a bunch of deeply dysfunctional woodland friends
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_02: Okay, all right and the fragging of poor Bob Iger but speaking of AI speaking of fragging president Trump will allow
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_04: Invitiate a sell H 200 ships to China reactions and move are muted actually negative with Nvidia stocks slightly down
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_04: Critics warning could advance Chinese AI capabilities
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_04: Gosh the Wall Street Journal really took him to town on this thing
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_04: Essentially, you know, and everybody did him brammer did a whole bunch of people and the idea is like look
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_04: They're getting all the stuff and Nvidia is getting
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_04: Getting what it wants that's it the American American public doesn't benefit in any way from there
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_04: Yes
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_04: So it seems like Jess and Long's you know full core press of wearing his leather jacket and hang your own Donald Trump and praising him
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_04: This worked here. This is what he wanted
[00:07:01] Yeah, I'm I'm mixed on this because
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_02: When we didn't sell them the hardships it feels to me like they got to work on workarounds
[00:07:10] Um, I think the policy it's like this is why we need georemundo back in charge of the shit because
[00:07:17] This stuff is not black and white and I like the idea
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_02: I like the idea of slowballing it and that is giving them enough access to our chips such that they didn't make
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_02: A statewide massive investment in innovation of their own
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_02: In other words
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_02: Like cable companies would pay content companies just enough such that they could
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_02: It didn't make sense for them to go to other means of distribution, but not enough
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_02: But you know, not enough so to they were more powerful than the distribution players
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_02: I would have thought I would have just tried to get every economist in the room and say okay, how
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_02: How can we keep the Chinese just enough chip technology that it grows our economy and our champions
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_02: But we still maintain a lead because when we did embark there was a very solid argument that all you do when you in bargo
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_02: China from doing this is they come up with workarounds that are really innovative
[00:08:09] So the problems I have are autonomous weapons super computing
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_02: military simulations and
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_02: And the problem is with high-end GPUs
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_02: It can dramatically reduce the training time per like combat algorithms and missile targeting and
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_02: cyber warfare and drone storms and the reality is I just don't trust
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_02: Hegseth
[00:08:35] To get in a room with with our commerce secretary and kind of figure this shit out on a thoughtful level
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_02: I think essentially
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_02: Jensen Huang has likely said we're very supportive of you your handsome and
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_02: Inviteus should get involved in your next renovation and right exactly. So I don't unfortunately I
[00:08:56] I I just like this
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_02: Almost as much it's probably more impactful, but no less or more egregious
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: Than wikofs kids and the trump kids
[00:09:08] Getting money for their shit coin investment in exchange for us agreeing to sell chips to the UAE
[00:09:15] Who has not proven that they don't have a leaky boat in terms of sending chip technology to Russia or China itself
[00:09:23] Good just on a thoughtful people figuring this out. No, well
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_02: I have to say the journal was very supposed to president trump so this week you will let Nvidia sell H
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_04: Sell its H200 chips to China return for US Treasury getting 25% cut of the sales
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_04: The Indians struck a better deal when they sold Manhattan to the Dutch
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_04: Why would the president give away one America's cheap technological advantage to an adversary and its chief economic competitor
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_04: And they do say they're gonna do it anyway
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_04: but
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_04: But
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_04: He said yet now mr. trump wants to sell the advanced H200 without strings the question is why Nvidia
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_04: CEO jensen mong is lobbied for loosening the restrictions the companies friends in the white house arguing it doing so could retard
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_04: Uh could retard trying to drive to develop competing chips and make its eight i
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_04: Developers dependent on us chips. That's their best argument and and he's did went on to say no
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_04: This is this is this is really bad on every and what we get is bob kiss essentially
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_04: um, it's a great point
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_04: We should have at a minimum. We should have gotten more if you look at
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_02: In the last five years it's gone from 17% of exports to the us to 10% they have vastly reduced their dependence on us
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_02: I get that
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_02: What is asymmetric in the trading relationship with everybody is it China
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_02: Since 2019 has increased its exports 40% correct. That's what they were saying we got we got more yeah
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_04: Meanwhile has only increased their imports buying other people's products by 1%
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_02: So they've decided we'll sell you everything
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_02: We at a minimum should have extracted a pound of flesh here that said okay
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_02: Where you get need to open your markets for the following things for us
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_02: But this is it's in all of that the the the waterfall effect Huawei
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_02: Will be a much more competitive product and they make great products and this is the last line
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_04: We sure hope mr. Trump is in doing this for the in midias 25% tack payments of treasury
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_04: The constitution best taxing power in Congress yet mr. Trump is essentially trading national security for pennies on the dollar
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_04: So I would agree he's gotten nothing for this even with the age 20 chips. We got some rare earth minerals
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_04: Um, I think at the time they they he said the administration agreed
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_04: But they they put more restrictions in october. So it just this is stupid where he's the worst deal maker in
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_04: In a in America
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, we gave a strategic competitor AI progress stronger military capability
[00:11:47] um
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_02: likely a more kind of self-sufficient or innovative tech ecosystem
[00:11:52] While exposing all of our own firms to regulatory geopolitical
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_02: In long-term competitive risk and in exchange, you know what we got was in video stocks gonna go up
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_02: Okay, and 25 whatever, you know, it's just with three gents and long is the most
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_04: And I mean this
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_04: It as a compliment manipulative CEO there is um and he gets what he wants and it's all good for him video
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_04: But I hate to say this but jensen
[00:12:19] and Ted sorandos
[00:12:21] and all these guys who
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_02: I
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_02: When they go to meet with the president the only thing they repeat over in their heads over and over is don't forget to swallow
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_02: Right these guys are the most obsequious
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_02: But they get what they want and but that's their I hate to say that's their job
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_02: They were there yesterday and it's our job to look people
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_02: Who are they yesterday that fed head dead head
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_04: Fed dead whatever he's losing his mind all right
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_04: Speaking of losing your mind Trump says it's imperative that CNN be sold on one of brothers deal
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_04: President is not supposed to say things like this, but of course with whatever it's this one
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_04: Conveniently David Ellison has reportedly told Trump officials the paramount wins out
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_04: He'll make sweeping changes at CNN. What a what a cuck he is
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_04: Although Trump got a little testy with the Ellison's this week lashing out on true social after 60 minutes ran in interview with marjorie
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_04: Taylor green meanwhile Ellison has been pitching Warner Cheryl just directly you got apparently mario de belly interested
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_04: Trying tender their shares
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_04: I have I feel like I've talked to a lot of people here all this week and you know money is gonna win out here
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_04: But the kind like people would have lost their minds if they're and this was in the Wall Street Journal
[00:13:31] SPEAKER_04: So that he is told them he will you know, he will change CNN as part of the deal
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_04: When one of the Oliver Darcy told me when he tried and he wrote when he tried to get a comment
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_04: They didn't they're like what are you talking about like they didn't even deny it that they were doing that making this paper
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_04: You know
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_04: We'll we'll stop CNN for being so mean to you mr. President if you give us thing that would have been a four alarm journalistic fire at any other time
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_04: Not with these
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_04: I said that when Fox was trying to emerge with Disney or whatever well exactly like just it does I'm I'm gonna get
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_04: Imagine it. It's bad. It's bad. Now. It's bad then. It's bad all the time. I mean again. It's sort of
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_04: Absolutely puts solidifies. I'm walking right out of there the day they get there like I'm walking
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_04: I mean, there's no way I'm working for these terrible people, but
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_04: And I've said I said that on an interview with Rachel Maddox. She was asking me
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_04: But but money let's go to the deal
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_04: What regardless of what they do with CNN and what they're doing is heinous with their considering doing his heinous
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_04: The money wins out here. It's the it's if they go up to 34. I understand they will get this they will get this
[00:14:39] Yeah, we had I thought we had a really productive conversation around this and the way this is supposed to work
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_02: Is that the one with the most money wins at least initially at least initially it's meant to be a compliment
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_02: It doesn't fucking matter with the president of things or it shouldn't matter
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_02: No, it doesn't incorporate that matter. It doesn't matter what podcast who podcasters think would be quote-unquote better owners
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_02: The person that shows up with the biggest check in capitalism in a single-class shareholder company which this is
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_02: gets the prize and then subject to the following
[00:15:11] regulators bring an economist and
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_02: econometrics experts and consumer behavior experts and they try and discern
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_02: Whether or not the very valid argument you made
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_02: That this is in fact one big market for eyeballs or if it's a distinct market because it's original content creation and a subscriber model
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_02: And they make a call around whether or not this will reduce competition and leak
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_02: Value and leverage from consumers and labor to the shareholders of the consolidated ecosystem or not
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_02: And then and then it goes through an additional
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_02: I think it's called I used to do this for a living and then it goes through something called
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_02: I think it's called a syphias review that says all right. They're just under
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_04: They just made it so they're just under just so you know, go ahead. They're just under all the many countries in this deal
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_04: What they did is they manipulated it so that these numbers that that doesn't have to go through a syphias
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_04: Well
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_04: The bottom line is there should be a national security review that's not gonna be because the way they designed it
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_04: Well, I'm talking about what should happen. I look what what will happen is totally like upper grabs right in a corrupt
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_02: ocracy and that is a mix between
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_02: Is a mix between 60s east Germany 30s Germany a cleptocracy and a cack a stocker see picker
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_02: ocracy that's just fucking stupid or evil
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_02: But the way it should work is big as check wins initially then it goes under any trust review by thoughtful people to figure out if it's gonna reduce competition and harm consumers and labor
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_02: And then it should go under national security review and let me be
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_02: Let me be cut. I actually don't think raising money out of the gulf for an acquisition like this
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_02: I don't perceive that as a threat. Oh come on. It's media. They we net we lost our minds when
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_04: Okay, I was the largest shareholder
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_02: On the board of the New York Times. I got to meet with the editorial board once and couldn't say anything
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_02: And had absolutely no influence over the editorial product there and I had two seats on the board
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_02: Why so and also we have to keep in mind
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_02: That the all the money right now is in the gulf and if we want access to our capital for our companies to create more competition and more tax revenue
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_02: At some point we need to access that capital
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_02: Having said that I would like a review by people much smarter than me to go
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_02: This is why it's a risk to our free speech and they will have undo influence or someone go
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_02: You know if you put these safeguards in place
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_02: It's just a cheap source of capital
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_02: my point is
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_02: There are there are people who do this for a living and are really good at this and should be part of a review
[00:17:45] SPEAKER_02: Instead it's based on the plug sugar level and the opinion unfortunately of the president who gives him money
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_02: And what what TV anchor or podcast he recently listen to most recently this is there
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_02: We have institutions and experts and let me use the word which has become a dirty word. We have experts for a reason
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_02: All right, let me let me interject here
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_04: Sure first of all they're do they're designing it
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_04: So they also had 10 cent in here until they were
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_04: Tencent was he had come out they knew that I thought I'm sorry about
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_02: First of all they hid the idea of the they didn't hide it
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_04: But they put it on the let one of the last pages of the Saudis and the others were involved
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_04: Secondly, they added Jared Kushner just to put it icing on this shitty cake
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_04: Thirdly, they had 10 cent in there and then they didn't I mean this is how they're thinking right and
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_04: Honestly, I want to know Larry if you're so fucking rich. Why don't you just pay for it if you believe in this so much
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_04: You're an American it's an American media company. Why do you need their money? I get why you would get it
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_04: I'm not I'm not unsophisticated, but here's what it does
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_04: There's a woman gale slater an antitrust. She's well regarded. He is now put her in such a fucking jam
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_04: Like she can't do her job
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_04: Because now she's sucked up into politics versus doing a real antitrust look at this right as we talked about which is streaming
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_04: Where's the market etc
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_04: That's an issue. It is also put the syphias people in in a jam because they can't look at this which is their job
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_04: And by the way, I don't even trust them anymore given all the the Yutzes in Yahoo's they put a person in charge of FEMA that was an election denialist like a really severe one
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_04: As opposed to just a sort of casual garden variety
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_04: Election denier
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_04: It's just they're putting incompetence and loyalists in place and nobody's going to be able to do their job here
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_04: Because of what Trump is doing and how he has been staffing his administration and how he's with the only thing that I find amusing is that
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_04: He's not sort of just giving into the Ellison's he's making them beg for it essentially and by kissing up to Ted Cerandos
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_04: Now the question is will Netflix raise its price? Will it say do an all cash deal go to 30 and then have that stub of a company
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_04: Which is the CNN and the cable the question is whether Netflix will will
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_04: But but but Bill Cohen that talked to me about and he's written about is they go to 30 and then the question is what's the value of that stub
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_04: Ellison's are valuing it at a dollar
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_04: Uh, or a little more than a dollar and others like pretty well-known analysts are going at anywhere from three to five dollars
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_04: And so that makes their deal higher than the Ellisons, but what if the else that just go to 34 cash
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_04: There's you know, that's the whole situation. I think most of the arb's just want the money and move along right presumably
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_02: They're
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_02: This is like the venture capital community whoever comes up with two cents more. I'll make out with my cousin
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_02: You didn't make out with your cousin did you I did and you know what he's a very good kisser
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_02: Snow White asked her an AI for relationship advice. Yeah, and it responded maybe don't move in with seven dudes from Craigslist next time
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_02: Um very fun. Yeah, okay. I don't
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_02: This is why this is why two thirds of mergers don't work and it's playing out here
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_01: Will ring our hands but about about any trust about someone in the Gulf having undue influence over CNN around the Ellisons getting their nose so far up
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_02: Trump's ass that they'll they'll guarantee that they'll just start filling
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_02: CNN with Tucker Carlson on on 24 hour loop or something
[00:21:19] But this is why this acquisition will most likely fail from a shareholder perspective and that is one
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_02: You have attended we have a tendency as an acquireer to over estimate synergies underestimate cultural impact and three more than anything
[00:21:33] testosterone gets involved and that is I can guarantee you then when all of these companies were looking at this
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_02: This is a company that was trading at nine bucks to share recently seven. I thought it was it down at seven
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_04: That all of these guys said okay
[00:21:47] Scare sass at it's one of a kind properties. We don't want this in the hands of competitors
[00:21:53] Wow, this is an opportunity to consolidate the streaming market in Netflix wow
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_02: We really need this to bulk up paramount
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_02: We could do great things with the cable and the streaming
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_02: Comcast and we need something to re-ignite grow they all came up with really strong strategic reasons to stretch to
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_02: All right, if we could get this for 19 maybe 20
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_02: We can't go any higher than 24 from David Ellison right
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_04: We can't go any higher than 24 and this is what happens right testosterone takes over
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_02: It is it's like you like oh, we're only a couple bucks away
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_02: Yeah from being king and taking the ultimate victory lap and pulling
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_02: If Ellison
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_02: Mass if he massively overpays for this thing yeah, every business cover will be the winner. Yeah, the winner
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, I will tie more than with Ted Turner and Steve case. Yeah, be kale
[00:22:43] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, the winner what a deal of the century and Steve cases now like oh my god
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_02: I just told this guy a bag of shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what David's that's all but these guys have already I can
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_02: Promise you they have already blown way beyond a price they were absolutely never ever consider work
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_02: They cannot it's just a rich. It's a yacht like it's a yacht. It's leaking and that's what he's bought
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_04: I mean the problem is but but if you just on the face of it
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_04: In terms of synergies concast or Netflix or the better buyers they have all like Netflix could blow out game of thrones
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_04: They could blow out they have a world what you know the worldwide distribution network
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_04: They they could do a lot with this and they all and they're shopping with with with with expensive stock
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_02: They're credit card is fully loaded exactly right well not as expensive it was but
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_04: They were the best owner is between these two by every single metric. They're the better owner
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_04: And I know that are you mean in terms of synergy would you
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_02: Synergy how it works what they're gonna they're not gonna do as many layoffs
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_04: They have the and the only thing CBS this whole gang can do is is put together like
[00:23:47] SPEAKER_04: Problematic assets and they don't have a plan for doing anything else. I mean the only thing that's happening is it mean
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_04: As I said before
[00:23:56] SPEAKER_04: David Ellison is is a very nice guy, but he's monumentally unqualified to do this that hasn't stopped him
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_04: But he is the oldest boy with daddy's backing and and and that's the prescription for that
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_04: Okay, also I don't think his movies made so much okay and and and and saslobs gonna walk away with a billion dollars
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_02: For destroying value winner winner. I mean we can make a big and big can of winner and Netflix is in my view
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_02: Who I love is is going to basically
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_02: endgame
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_02: Streaming and prices are gonna go. I think you can make an but here's the thing it it
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_02: We don't get to decide
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_02: Who would be qualitatively the best owner of the worst right the guy who runs AT&T is a really smart nice man
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_02: I like him a lot he was probably the wrong owner for CNN. Yeah, I agree
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_04: But he showed up with the biggest check so Jeff Bukas said congrats. It's yours that guy smart another smart guy
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_04: He got out when they're getting good. Okay, hold on just a pause there
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_02: But he did call Netflix the Albanians. Let's not let him forget that
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_02: He made he made a one sentence stupid remark that's haunted him the rest of his life
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_02: It's a really bad one. Let me but okay, but that is dwarfed by
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_02: Guess who decided to sell magazines at their peak?
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_02: He is guess who decided to sell the cable part of his company at the peak and by the way
[00:25:16] SPEAKER_02: Guess who decided to sell the assets of of time of time Warner at their peak?
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_02: Jeff fucking be a guess because this is Albanian this is where CEOs
[00:25:27] Yeah, where they're and I'm gonna differentiate between men and what I don't think Ruth Parat
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_02: I think women are different than men and it's okay as long as you sanctify women and call on them predators nidia
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_02: But I think on a certain level you would have to acknowledge if Ruth Parat was running these companies
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_02: There's no fucking way should be at $34 a share
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_02: She'd be she'd be like okay. I don't need to have the biggest dick and win this thing
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_02: I'm here for shareholders. Yeah, and the thing that CEO's a really
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_02: Not good at but they get all Jonesed up about
[00:25:57] Getting bigger and bigger and bigger the guy who ran b of a just kept acquiring everything and destroyed a ton of shareholder value
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_02: What CEOs are not good at going back to my I'm gonna pat myself on the back
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_02: I remember saying to Arthur Sosberg and then you're like why the fuck aren't we selling about calm?
[00:26:11] SPEAKER_02: This is shit. This is shit business. We could sell it for a billion dollars right now
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_02: But they wanted to access rise and analog outfit with digitally earrings
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_02: CEOs are terrible. Yeah, selling assets of the right time. Why don't you give them David Zaslo at the same hand job?
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_04: You're giving Jeff Buches here. Just curious
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_02: Oh David David's doing his job, but but but Jeff Buches
[00:26:35] SPEAKER_02: You know who probably made a hundred or two hundred million dollars made billions for shareholders. Yeah, Zasloff
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_02: Has has basically said you fucked up investing in my company. You should invest in the S&P
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_02: I'm barely gonna get your money back, but by the way, I'm gonna walk off with a billion dollars. Yeah, you're right
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_04: If you barely get it
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_02: If must create seven trillion dollars in incremental shareholder value at Tesla
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_02: I've said this on record. I know I know I'm okay with him getting a trillion dollars if Bucha
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_02: Mickey trucks. I remember when Mickey Drexel made a billion dollars at the gap and there was all this is in the 90s
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_02: There was all this like hullabaloo and I'm like he's added 14 billion in shareholder value
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_02: I agree the problem with Zasloff or Marissa Marissa mayor or Adam Newman is they walk off with hundreds of millions or billions
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_02: For destroying shareholder value. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, I go. Okay. We'll see where this goes
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_04: But I'll tell you cares where she goes out the door. Thank you. That is my speech
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_04: By the way, somehow I don't think that's entered the discussion
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_02: I'm just gonna loudly insult them the whole time until they fire me
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_04: But I think they're gonna fire you. I think I know I'm actually the person they want to keep which is the worst part
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_04: But I'm not gonna okay Scott. Let's go on a quick break. We come back the Trump administration's plan to use social media to gatekeep foreign visitors

[00:28:07] SPEAKER_03: Quince pretty much has your whole list covered

[00:29:00] Scott we're back with more news this one. I just can't believe this the Trump administration wants to review foreign visitors social media history
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_04: This is ahead of the the world cup coming here the plan would apply to citizens of 42 countries that are allowed to visit free travel to the US
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_04: The list of countries includes the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Germany the prosal is not yet final in the US customs and border protection
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_04: Says it will set 60 days of comments. I mean are you fucking kidding me they in the free speech nation
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_04: um and and as you said are the numbers on visitors have declined so precipitously and has sort of hollowed out
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_04: I can't believe they're even considering looking at people's social media
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_04: Like what you fucking care if you think marker rubio is dickless, which I do and I will say on social media
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_04: um this is insane from a business point of view correct
[00:29:50] Like with this obsession with manufacturing
[00:29:54] Where 80% of Americans think we need more manufacturing but only 20% of Americans have any interest in being in manufacturing
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_02: You can't take your dog to the factory floor
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_02: People don't want the for the most part people don't want to be in manufacturing
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_02: This obsession with manufacturing and we do need a certain level of a manufacturing base
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_02: But it needs to be advanced manufacturing high margin
[00:30:15] But the obsession is coming at the cost of an even better higher margin industry and that is the tourism business
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_02: It's insane
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_02: And so and I just so people can fill up our comments with calling me a fascist or a weirdo or whatever
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_02: But that's every Tuesday, but go ahead. There you go
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_02: I do believe if you are applying to come here and be a citizen or get a
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_02: Visa or green card
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_02: I think everything is open game
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_02: Because what and young people let's be clear
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_02: When you get a job at Goldman Sachs before you get the offer you apply for a job you know what they do
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_02: They look at your social media
[00:30:52] And if they think you're an idiot that is going to embarrass them
[00:30:56] And you're you're saying misogynistic things or you're out just
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_02: Rubbing your wealth and people's face or doing shots or acting like a total asshole. Guess what
[00:31:06] They will not give you a job. They also run credit checks on you
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_02: So I there's a difference between not cut a call tourism where we benefit
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_02: Vegas is dying and amongst there are two reasons Vegas is dying or a lot of reasons
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_02: But one of them is we now moved we put Vegas in everyone's pocket
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_02: Online betting Canadians were a huge source of
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_02: Of revenue for for Vegas. They're out. They're like fuck you
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_02: You're gonna treat us like assholes and take 70% of our exports which go to you and start playing
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_02: Being reckless with our economic well-being
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_02: We're done. Yeah, so this is yet another reason, but what who would even think of this?
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_04: This is like where's by the way?
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_04: The first to me which is what we're becoming literally the first fucking amendment
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_04: It says you can say whatever you think like you know
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_04: He also tweeted that if you said he's apparently in
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_04: Candescent over your time. The first amendment though
[00:32:02] SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry. They should be able to say anything they want about the United States of America on social media period
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_04: Period full stock. Okay, but but do we have an obligation to let them in? I don't I yes
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_04: Yes, we do. It's just words. That's just words. They're not like I'm asking this to learn not to make a comment
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_02: Does the first amendment apply to people coming in temporarily? I don't care it replies to our whole ethos like if you want it to
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_04: Keep people out. I'm I'm coming to New York and then I'm gonna commit a terrorist attack
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_02: I'm not talking about committing a terrorist attack saying Donald Trump is an orange not see is fine. Hold on hold on hold on
[00:32:38] I'm high. I'm coming into the US. Why are you here?
[00:32:43] Well, it says on social media that you are a back to activate a terrorist cell and commit acts of terror while you
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_02: Were here on US soil. You think that's first amendment free speech? No, that's not what it's about
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_04: It's they're gonna review their foreign visitors
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_04: So the only reason I'm pairing this together is because he was in Candescent over in New York Times
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_04: Peace he is a care according to white house people that I talked to he's like lost his mind
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_04: Where the New York Times basically said he's old and probably you know essentially has frontal lobe dementia
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_04: Which I think we all can all after the performance of the last two days you're going a bit off script here
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_02: But okay, this is what he said anyone who says I'm sick is a traitor
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_04: And could be tried for sedition essentially is what he said agree words
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_04: Words don't count and I just I look if that's different Kara no no if they come in and they have threatened this on social media
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_04: Then we stop them we look through their bags. We say we're gonna follow them all we still let them in
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry. It's just words. It's like what if it's a teenager doing it. What if it's some angry grandma?
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_04: We can make those we can make those judgment calls, but I don't think I don't think everyone
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_02: I don't think everyone anyone I don't think Americans have a birthright to live in New York
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_02: If it's too expensive you leave
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_02: I don't think people have a birthright to just throw up their arm unfortunately and say asylum and gain entry into the US
[00:34:00] SPEAKER_02: And I don't think it's people's birthright to come in for whatever reason if they have a history and statements
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_02: That's appear to be a threat and are gonna cost us more energy and money to track these people because we perceive there a real threat
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_02: Having said that
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_02: I think the bar has to be pretty fucking low to gain entry to come in and spend money and if you've said some
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_02: anti-American things on your social media
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_02: Okay, we should be able to assess how serious a threat it is and the bar needs to be
[00:34:27] SPEAKER_02: I don't know really high really low, but if you've said some anti-American things
[00:34:30] SPEAKER_02: That's probably 70% of anyone who has a social media account and the economic benefit in the brand America
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_02: When people come to America, guess what they have a really good time and they like us and they find out on the whole
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_02: People who are Republicans and Democrats are pretty decent people and then they go back and say hey, maybe someday
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_02: Let's go back to Disney or if our kid wants to go to college in the US or if a US company comes here
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_02: Maybe I'll do business with them. We have a vested economic and strategic and military interest
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_02: Best in interest in letting people come and see how wonderful America is but I think what you were doing was a very
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_04: Edge case of a thing they already were aware of those we
[00:35:08] SPEAKER_04: Someone who calls more and shitler come on in like who cares like who the fuck cares
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_04: And they don't need to investigate that person if they don't have a history or record of crime
[00:35:17] SPEAKER_04: Which they already know before by the way they know
[00:35:20] SPEAKER_04: The bad people that come in for the most part. It's not a secret. It's not some grandma from Germany
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_04: Like give me a break. I mean, it's only one step to what he was saying very explicitly if you say I'm old and sick
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_04: You're a trader your guess what you're old and you're sick
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_04: And I think you have pre- you know frontal
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_04: Dimension low dementia. I come and get me. I don't know what else to say
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, speaking of which president Trump kicked off a series of really
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_04: unusual speeches for him even because he seemed rather low energy and
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_04: Meandering intended to ease the cost of living it's by mocking affordability
[00:35:57] SPEAKER_04: Let's listen to a clip of the speech in Pennsylvania this week
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_04: But they have a new word, you know, they always have a hoax the new word is affordability
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_00: So they look at the camera and they say this election is all about affordability
[00:36:13] Now they'd ever talk about it
[00:36:15] Yeah, they're talking about it now sir
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_04: He got distracted by some of the crowd telling him to run for four more years during the speech also suggested marriage
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_04: Missed you by less pencils and dolls from overseas. That's an old trope. He was
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_04: Doing um, he was quite I mean
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_04: I don't think he has Alzheimer's
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_04: I think he has this frontal look because you get more aggressive and more
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_04: fanciful with that one
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_04: A valetimers is a forgetting disease really
[00:36:39] SPEAKER_04: Um, but this idea of you can get your dolls elsewhere
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_04: by less pencils
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_04: Nobody cares about affordability. They must be
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_04: They must be beside themselves in the White House that he's doing this
[00:36:52] He ran on affordability
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_02: And 57% of voters
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_02: Ability sorry
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_04: 57% of voters and uh, uh, agree the Trump was losing the battle against inflation
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_02: 68% believe that the economy is poor or very poor and according to a recent political poll
[00:37:09] Um, get this 27% percent of respondents have skipped a medical checkup because of the costs
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_02: Because of costs have uh, accelerating in the last two years a quarter have skipped a prescription a third
[00:37:23] Said they could not afford to attend a professional sports event with their family or friends and almost half said
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_02: They can't pay for a vacation that involves air travel
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_02: I mean, this is the problem neither Democrats or Republicans want to have a serious fucking conversation around affordability
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_02: Republicans want to tear off
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_02: Democrats want to throw money at people to say we'll we'll short-term solve your problem
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_02: The structural the structural answers to inflation and affordability are really boring and America
[00:37:49] SPEAKER_02: The American public doesn't seem to want to elect people are willing to have these conversations
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_02: The things that drive inflation you you start with the shit that drives the CPI
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_02: 40% unfortunately
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_02: Of middle-income homes now it's going towards housing
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_02: We need and you've said this we need a massive increase in housing
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_02: The next biggest cost in terms of acceleration the two and three are education and health care
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_02: We need national medicine or socialized medicine and we need tuition caps based on income of the household
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_02: But no one wants to talk about and we need massive antitrust
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_02: Well, it's also it's also food though Scott. I mean, I was noticing and I have
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_04: I I
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_04: I've plenty money to buy food, but I was in a store the other day and the the
[00:38:31] The the chicken sandwich was eight dollars and Amanda saw one two eight nine dollars like for just a basic chicken and I was like
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_04: That's like less more than minimum wage like everything like even the most basic stuff is more than minimum wage and
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_04: I I don't know I don't pay attention prices as much as I should sometimes I do sometimes I don't but
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_04: Boy do you notice them now?
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_04: Because you're like what the question is I
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_02: You're saying what everyone will agree with right and that is the rent is too damn high
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_02: You know remember that mayoral candidate. Yeah, we all agree the question is what do we do about it?
[00:39:06] And the answer is in my view if you're talking about a chicken sandwich
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_02: There are three companies controlling the majority of the poultry market
[00:39:13] There are two few
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_02: grocers and too much regulation
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_02: And too in too much red tape that increases the cost of
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_02: Of grocery prices you need more competition. There are literally seven food companies responsible
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_02: For the vast majority of our food products right now. We need more we need dramatically more but from a marketing point of view him making fun of it
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_04: I don't even understand what the theory is here except that he is
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_04: Frontal low dementia. I don't know what else he could say. I don't I don't think it's fair to say as dementia or Alzheimer
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_02: What I think it's fair to say is he suffers from an ailment that is very obvious and is true. He suffers from 79
[00:39:53] And we just should not have a person with a finger on the button trying to figure out terror policy trying to figure out
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_02: You know our relationship with the CCP and what ship should go and the threat they present long term
[00:40:04] SPEAKER_02: What do you think of him doing this trying to make it a not a thing?
[00:40:09] It's totally ineffective. It's pilloried for much less by saying it totally totally ineffective
[00:40:14] SPEAKER_02: I'm glad he's doing it because I think it plays into our hands
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_02: But at some point
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_02: The counter to that can't be just what a fucking idiot is okay agreed
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_02: It's all right affordability requires an adult conversation and long-term structural solutions
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_02: Are we ready for an adult conversation around housing medical care
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_02: To wish and cost and antitrust and the democracy. Although I don't think maqeem is about that
[00:40:34] SPEAKER_04: We're the Democrats having this conversation outside of Senator Klobuchar who's actually having this conversation
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_02: For Democrats who I have on raging moderates. I'll say the same thing
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_02: This is an important conversation that we need to have at the right moment, but right now
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_02: Let's make sure we get the office you know ACA subsidies. All right. I get it
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_02: Well, that's a cost like you're like you don't buy insurance, but mine is gonna go up quite a bit
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_04: Like and it was it was remark it was like what could it go up to and he was agree. It's insane
[00:41:03] SPEAKER_02: It was like American households have medical or dental debt right but okay, so
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_02: We we have a series of band-aid ideas, but no one wants to talk about a structural reform and healthcare because the healthcare industrial complex is the biggest donor
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_02: To Pax I just gave a bunch of money to a young woman who just announced her campaign for Senate and her
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_02: Well pretty easy to figure out. Okay. Yeah. I saw you online. You like call me Jasmine
[00:41:32] Yeah, I am literally like watching my parents argue

[00:41:43] SPEAKER_04: Let's try that. I think James. We'd like to have you both on stage. I think they're both outstanding
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_02: Anyways, but I heard from someone on her staff saying we'll try and find time for you to meet with the representative
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_02: I'm like no
[00:41:59] SPEAKER_02: A people people with my demographic have way too much fucking influence already
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_02: I am sending this money with one directive keep
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_02: Keep an on girl. Yeah, keep doing what you're doing. I like to see her slap you back to last Sunday
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_04: As my own
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_04: That's what you're here for it's
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_04: Totally take the her announcement video was great. I like him too. I love to announce my video
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_02: People are worried about that was for each other. I don't I think that's fine everyone's like oh we blow on the same like no
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_04: Young people like how are you?
[00:42:30] SPEAKER_02: We need to give follows Instagram models which I love which I love I love a guy who talks about Jesus and then is following
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_02: Radikowski did ask about him anyway, let's go on a quick break
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_04: You know I expose myself and you jab play with my emotions. I got so much dope
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_02: But when you said you know Emily Radikowski and I was waiting for the end to say that she's done
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_02: That's about you so when we come back we'll talk about Australia's new social media band for teens
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_04: Scott we're back. It might be time for us to move down under Australia's become the first country in the world to ban kids under 16 from using social media
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_04: Instagram TikTok snapchat read it and several other platforms face fines of up to $33 million if they don't take reasonable steps to remove underage users
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_04: Of course Aussie teens are already finding work runs of course they are creating accounts with fake ages using less popular apps
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_04: Needed taking the government to court fine. Well, and good. That's what that's what teens are therefore and here in the US
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_04: The Florida law banning social media accounts for kids under 14 is going to affect after surviving a court challenge
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_04: I got to say I agree with that idiot remember him down in Florida
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_04: To Santa's on this this works. Well the rest of the world follow now just for let me just say we have Facebook and met a hard time
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_04: And by the way, they are not keeping young people safe no matter what they say
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_04: Tim Cook was on Capitol Hill this week lobbying against legislation that requires platforms to authenticate
[00:43:49] SPEAKER_04: Um users age pushing instead
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_04: Put the burden on parents
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_04: You know that both meta and they are arguing of who's to responsible
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_04: I think they're both responsible the whether the phones are or the
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_04: social media sites but putting it on parents when they make these products is just not it is just I find
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_04: Really shameful for Tim Cook to do, but I know why he's doing it. I just find it shameful. Go ahead
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_04: We just gave back in one move or I should say the Australian government their leadership just gave back
[00:44:22] This is the most generous a creative gift to kids likely in Australian history
[00:44:28] SPEAKER_02: Uh, they're time with their friends
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_02: their self-esteem
[00:44:33] They're time outside their time playing sports their time with their parents their ability to navigate
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_02: relationship and parent and person their ability to focus
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_02: On their schoolwork their test scores
[00:44:46] The Australian government just gave back more childhood to children than any single legislation
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_02: I think passed in the West in the last decade and
[00:44:56] And I just want to call out I think the most influential scholar in the world right now is my colleague Jonathan Hight
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_02: I just don't think this what happened without his book the anxious generation it might it might have happened
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_02: But it wouldn't have we have happened as soon
[00:45:08] And I hope that it ignites an absolute firestorm of and they say well, it's about parenting. Oh, fuck you Tim Cook
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_02: Do you think it's parenting
[00:45:19] That that bars should be able to serve my kid alcohol
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_04: And then it's up to me to make sure that he never gets access to alcohol
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_02: Some of your responses, otherwise Tim Cook doesn't have children's there are the difficulty of
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_04: Okay, and here's the problem parenting. Okay
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_02: You don't have children when you say that yeah, you don't that's not that unless it's a collective action unless every 15 year old is off snap
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_02: You move in with parenting and you managed to figure out a way to use custodial or custodial and get them off snap and guess what
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_02: They're more depressed as my other colleague Adam Ulter did research around this because they're ostracized because they're the only ones not on
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_02: Snap so unless this is collective action through legislation and this is my favorite argument from meta
[00:46:03] SPEAKER_02: That they're violating the first amendment rights. You know what a 14 year old doesn't need to know
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_02: We don't need to know what a 14 year old thinks about mRNA vaccines. I'm sorry
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_02: This is such an insane argument that it's that they're worried about the free speech
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_02: And they say this is nothing but the following this is Joe camel
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_02: It was shown that the tobacco industry had a series of cartoon-like characters to try and incorporate new people into their addiction
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_02: Which would continue to kill our sisters
[00:46:29] SPEAKER_02: And our brothers and our our mothers and they said sorry
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_02: You don't get to feed the pipeline with cartoon-like characters
[00:46:36] SPEAKER_02: Nor should social media at a minimum be allowed to spread this depression
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_02: This disassociation and the sequestration from life and family my fear. I would love to think this ignites
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_02: Similar bands around the world. I'm hopefully does but the problem is
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_02: In America we are falling to this delusion that we are democracy. We're not
[00:46:58] SPEAKER_02: We have a passive majority that is weaponized and influenced by a very activated sophisticated well-funded
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_02: Special interest groups. Yes, and the special interest group around tech
[00:47:09] SPEAKER_04: Well, the special interest group around tech is only second to the health industrial complex in terms of money
[00:47:15] SPEAKER_02: And maybe number one right now because the entire economy and the Trump administration is making a big bet on AI
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_02: So these people have so much fucking
[00:47:24] SPEAKER_02: We have minority rural areas that are the worst for Americans health care and social media among the worst
[00:47:30] SPEAKER_04: 100 biggest biggest lobbyists that is in there. Let me just say I agree
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_04: Parents should get off their phones when they're when front of their kids. They should do won't be more present for kids
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_04: Absolutely, they should be more interested in what they're doing online
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_04: But it is incredible. It is it's too hard to use and it's not your fault parents. This is made
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_04: I have a hard time
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_04: Monitoring the I had a hard time monitoring these things
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_04: But I did it, but it was very it was very difficult and the tools suck
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_04: So this is their responsibility to make it so put warning labels on these things
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_04: Explain this to kids and and again, I agree parents should not be on their foot like you have to sort of
[00:48:15] You know
[00:48:16] SPEAKER_04: Pattern map for kids on stuff like that ignoring them and looking at your phones is one of those things
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_04: And so there is a parental obligation here, but for the most part
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_04: That this is that is on them all of them and it's really
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_04: Repulsive that all these companies have constantly
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_04: Abrogated their responsibilities of their shoddy products no matter how you do it and they are able to do it
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_04: And I know they put in all this what if finding people privacy?
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_04: I don't care figure it out your smart people
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_04: So and you're making a ton of money so I'm sure you could spend some time
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_04: Well, just let's start
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_04: You
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_04: All right, so Instagrammer and $4 billion this year from teens age 13 to 17 they make
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_02: Platforms are gonna earn about 13 billion dollars from kids under 18 to 2022 which translates to about
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_02: I don't know somewhere between a hundred billion and a quarter of a trillion dollars
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_02: So what do you know they're worried about the first amendment rights
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_02: 53% of children now own a smartphone by age 11 that has doubled since 2015
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_02: 3 quarters of children aged two to five
[00:49:20] SPEAKER_02: Engaged with YouTube regularly and teen spend five hours a day on social media
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_02: Where do you think that five hours has come from about 35% of their waking hours outside of school and age gating
[00:49:32] SPEAKER_02: Guess what folks we age gate bars and restaurants serving alcohol convenient stores gas stations smoke shops tobacco
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_02: Cannabis industries can't drive to succino sports books the DMV online gambling sites pornography

[00:55:25] SPEAKER_02: He said he said you don't understand the difference between being right and being effective
[00:55:30] SPEAKER_02: He's like you're right a lot, but you're too aggressive and you're turning off people you got to think about how am I effective here
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_02: And he just gave me a series of things
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_02: Anyways, that was my my my mentor story. Oh my god. That's a wonderful story
[00:55:46] Oh, you know who I would pick just to stick my finger and Putin's eyes. I'd pick Navalny
[00:55:51] Ah
[00:55:52] That's a great idea
[00:55:54] Yeah, there's all kinds of people. I you know this is sort of an antiquated thing the person of the year
