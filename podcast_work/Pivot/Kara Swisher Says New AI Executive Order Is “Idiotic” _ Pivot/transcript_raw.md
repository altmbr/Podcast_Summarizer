[00:00:00] This is the mandatory federal regulation will have.
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_02: Dick, they won't have anything.
[00:00:10] Hi, everyone.
[00:00:10] This is Pivot from New York Magazine in the Vox Media Podcast
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_04: network. I'm Cara Swisher and I'm Scott Galloway.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_02: How you doing?
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_04: Scott, I'm doing great.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_02: Thanks.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_02: Weird weekend of shootings and feelings and pretty horrible
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_04: stuff. We usually banter here.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_04: But I think we we should just get right to it.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_04: Don't you think?
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_04: I think so.
[00:00:29] Yes, we want to briefly acknowledge the horrific events of
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_04: gun violence over the weekend on Saturday.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_04: Two people were killed and nine were injured
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_04: at a shooting at Brown University.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_04: And on Sunday, at least 15 people were killed in a shooting
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_04: at Ahana, Kaselebration in Bondi Beach in Australia.
[00:00:46] At authorities are still looking for the Brown shooter.
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_04: They had a person of interest who they let go, which was
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_04: probably disturbed people around that, you know, usually
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_04: campus.
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_04: The Bondi Beach shooters have been identified as a father and
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_04: a son, what a terrible parent and bystander and a bystander
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_04: whose refugee parents had just arrived from Syria,
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_04: wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers during the
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_04: Bondi Beach shooting.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_04: As if that violence weren't enough, director and actor Rob
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_04: Reiner and his wife Michelle were found dead in their L.A.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_04: home on Sunday, supposedly by apparently according to
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_04: lots of reports, their son, their youngest son is being
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_04: held in this, what it looks like a murder.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_04: Donald Trump, of course, had a weigh-in on this tragedy
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_04: posting on true social and a while ago, Rob Reiner,
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_04: tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_04: and comedy stars passed away together with his wife, Michelle,
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_04: reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_04: unyielding and curable affixes for the mind-ripling disease,
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_04: known as Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_04: I can't believe he wrote this, but once again, of course, I can.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_04: So he said the raging obsession has driven people crazy
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_04: and obviously paranoia is reaching new heights as the
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_04: trough conversations are passed, all goes and expectations with
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_04: greatness and then he said they should rest in peace.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_04: He's a terrible, terrible son of a bitch.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, I just can't wait for the right to be as inflamed by the
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_02: notion that anyone was dancing on Charlie Kirk's grave,
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_04: but this will just be Donald being Donald, right?
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_02: Exactly. I mean, just what a heinous piece of shit.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_04: Let's start with the shootings.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_04: Just for personally, Amanda went to Brown and
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_04: knows the area very well, very open campus.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_04: She was telling me, and it's sort of such a very peaceful.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_04: I've been there a number of times with her in the area where it was taking place.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_04: Nobody knows why this particular, well, because people have guns,
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_04: but why the reason behind the one in Bondi Beach was
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_04: horrific, except for that one bystander who was just,
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_04: there's the video of it, it was astonishing that they,
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_04: this guy had a long gun and this guy, he was a big guy who went after another big guy
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_04: and the father ended up dying.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_04: The son of a bleep is still living.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_04: Again, these people were peacefully getting together on a holiday,
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_04: and which was the first night of Hanukkah, which we celebrated last night.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_04: I don't know what to say, Scott, just the whole thing is just
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_04: the whole violence.
[00:03:22] Yeah, it's the things that strike me about Brown is that
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_02: just as we overprotect our kids offline and underprotect them online,
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_02: I think campuses unfortunately have become, they're supposed to be the state,
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_02: with some of the safest places in the world physically,
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_02: and some of the most dangerous places in the world.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_02: And unfortunately, we flipped a script.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_02: We've decided that words are violence,
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_02: and I think created sort of these very fragile,
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_02: a very fragile youth, not all, but too many.
[00:03:53] And at the same time, guns on campus, and we don't know,
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_02: they don't know who the shooter is, but generally speaking,
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_02: what will happen is they will attempt to politicize it,
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_02: the left and the right, unfortunately.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_02: And chances are, we don't know who it is, chances are,
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_02: there's three dimensions to this type of violence.
[00:04:14] It's usually a young man who's not connecting to work, family or relationships,
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_02: or someone who went online and got radicalized and then had access to guns.
[00:04:24] And then to use that as a bridge to Australia,
[00:04:28] this is the first mass shooting they've had in 27 years.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_02: They have one every 27 years.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_02: We have one every 27 hours.
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_02: And that's not a lie.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_02: We have one point, we have one point to mass shootings a day.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_02: So, and then, you know, I can't help but look, I'm obviously
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_02: think a lot about Israel and the Jewish population.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_02: There are 2.7 billion Christians, 2.1 billion Muslims, 1.4 billion
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: Indians, 1.3 billion Chinese, 355 million Americans.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_02: But the hate towards 15 million Jews, it was 15 million in 1939,
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_02: by 1945 Hitler had taken it out to 9 million, it's taken 80 years to get back to 15 million.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_02: But because of the hatred focused on these 15 million,
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_02: 0.2% of the world's population, Paris is canceling their New Year's events.
[00:05:25] I mean, this is really, this is impacting everyone.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: And the only silver lining here is who you brought up.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_02: Ahmed Al-Ahmad, his name is, I've positive in here.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_02: He's a fruit, he's a fruit.
[00:05:39] Yeah, he owns a fruit store, two sons, and I just think it was so wonderful on so many
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_02: dimensions that it was a Muslim. Because what I find, you know, a lot of debates recently, men,
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_02: people always want to go to this reductive, well, it's men against women or it's Muslims against Jews.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_02: No, it's illiberal, primitive thought versus liberal and lightened thought.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_02: And though that's who the battle is between.
[00:06:05] But I find, and also to personalize this, because I never missed an opportunity to
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_02: talk about myself, I was very upset about what had happened in Australia.
[00:06:16] And I thought about putting a star David in my window and I went out to try and find
[00:06:21] some sort of neon light or an Israeli flag.
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_02: And someone I live with said, are you fucking crazy?
[00:06:27] Are you fucking crazy?
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_02: That was their view. We live in London, we live on a busy street, and this person is like,
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_02: we have kids in our house. You're going to put a symbol of Judaism or Israel in our window.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_02: And I would ask everybody is, in today, and this is going to be somewhat an inflammatory statement,
[00:06:47] people are down with Judaism and Jewishness today because people like to feel sorry for Jews.
[00:06:53] But it'll soon return to what I would call a series of micro-enablin
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_02: enablements around what is going on here.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_02: And what I would ask is, is there any other group in the world that consists of 15 million
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_02: or 0.2% of the population that cannot celebrate their holidays in peace and without fear right now?
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_02: That is what it means to be Jewish right now.
[00:07:15] I'm sorry, go ahead, Cara.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_04: Well, I think you're talking about illiberalism. I think a lot of people have been,
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_04: we don't know what's happening in brown, by the way, we still don't understand what's going on.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but they don't have a suspect.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_04: They don't have a suspect. But most of you said, most of these killings are about illiberalism
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_04: and about not letting people be who they are, right? Whoever they happen to be.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_04: And I think it's really, it's sort of like the gun, I mean, Australian gun violence.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_04: Nephi lives in near Bondi Beach, actually right near it.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_04: And if you've ever been there, and I think you have too, it's a beautiful place.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_04: Well, it has such a nice feel to it.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_04: I would say the more liberal part of Sydney, right?
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_04: I would just kind of everyone is just letting people be who they are,
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_04: essentially. And for some reason, being a father and son is even worse in a lot of ways
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_04: because this father obviously radicalized his child.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_04: And it's just like it's sickening to me that they, that anyone cannot gather, right?
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_04: That, and I agree with you. I mean, the rise in anti-Semitism is just so disturbing and so
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_04: indicative of the rise of this kind of easy hatred kind of thing. And I think, again,
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_04: you don't want to link these things all of them together. But what the president wrote about
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_04: Rob Reiner, who was slashed to death allegedly by his son, who clearly had, if you follow it even
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_04: slightly, I saw that movie many years ago called Being Charlie, which the son wrote and the
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_04: father directed obviously to help his son get along. It was about his addiction and, and really
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_04: isolation, right? It's just like this, this is the answer, the violent, the violent answer. And so,
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_04: you know, you can't, there's sometimes there's nothing you can do about, there's something you
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_04: do about drug addiction, but drug addiction and it seems like schizophrenia of some sort.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_04: But to take, like the, the, the, the ease at which people accept all these things, especially
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_04: around anti-Semitic behavior is really, it's, I think it's where at this inflection,
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_04: we either go one way or the other, the other, I don't know, we have, we, we do have a,
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_04: a minor in our window. My wife is Jewish, my kids, my young kids are Jewish. And we also have a snowman,
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_04: and we have a Christmas tree. And I didn't even think about that, Scott, like we just put it in the
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_04: window. And, you know, I wouldn't think of taking it down, but you made me think of course.
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_04: But it's so disheartening. It's, it's, especially as we move into the holiday season. And again,
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_04: last night was the first night of Hanukkah. They're, you know, and my kids are so excited about Hanukkah
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_04: and everything around it. It's just, it's like, it's stomach churning, actually.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_04: I do think there's a difference between the brown and Australian tragedies and what happened to
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_02: the rhinos. I think my understanding of the rhinos is that it was a, a young man is really struggling.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_02: And it's tragic. But it, you know, and it represents, it's a, it's a, a warrant to discussion about
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_02: drug addiction. But what I find so disturbing disheartening is that all bigotry is hate.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_02: But there are different types of hate. And most bigotry comes in the form of, I don't like these
[00:10:45] people. I don't like the way they live their lives. I don't like their food. I don't like their
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_02: norms and their customs. And I'm going to discriminate against them. I'm going to sequester them
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_02: from jobs. I don't want them in my neighborhood. I don't want them to have the same rights as me.
[00:11:02] The discrimination or the bigotry against Jews, I find especially dangerous because it's not,
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_02: I don't like your food or I don't like the way, you know, I don't like your customs. It's that I
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_02: think you have come together to form a conspiracy that is purposely trying to oppress me.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_02: And that I need to take offensive action. Not to sequester you from opportunities.
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_02: But legitimize and create cloud cover for offensive violence against you no matter where you are.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_02: And also folks on campus, congratulations. When you're chanting globalize the intifada,
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_02: that's what's happened here. The intifada has been global.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_02: That's the humbling of those students for these people.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_04: I think there's, I think it's all connected. I think that when people legitimize this type of hate
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_02: speech and it becomes normalized, I think it creates cloud cover for this type of behavior.
[00:11:55] Perhaps I feel like I'm a semitism has been around for centuries.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_04: Okay. And so it's enablement of it.
[00:12:01] Right. Well, yeah, I mean, people shouldn't be, but you know, this is the problem with all these
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_04: things is talking the way like where does it, what do you do about all this hate speech
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_04: around everywhere around everything? Like it's so, it's so steeped into our world now and so
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_04: available. And again, you know, it's no, it's really interesting, you know, Australia just,
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_04: you know, quashed social media for kids under 16.
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_04: To me, that's what globalizes this. I think these sentiments have been around since the beginning
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_04: of time for some reason. And it creates this this worldwide ability to just hate across anyway.
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_04: There's no, these are all tragedies. I don't mean they're linked together in any way. But in,
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_04: in many ways, they sort of this acceptance of violence against people and especially in this
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_04: country and for Australia to have, as you said, a shooting is really rare, right? And so then you
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_04: worry about that country in that, the thing is, guess what? Like New Zealand, like other where they
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_04: had a terrible shooting, which was I think against a mosque in that case, they're going to do
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_04: something about it and shut it down. They're going to shut down guns. They will actually take action
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_04: as a country while we do not, which is really, that's my guess. Correct. Don't you think? Probably
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_04: there'll be some. They will, I mean, they, they did. They have. For example, it might not have been
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_02: 15 people. It might have been 150. Have they not banned assault rifles? Right. If though, if that
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_02: father's son team had had AR 15s and that single bolt action and shotguns, it might have been 150
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_02: people. Right. Exactly. And the fact that it happens every, this will rattle Australia to its core.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_02: And they'll do something about it. We're going to talk about Brown until tomorrow. And there'll
[00:13:55] be another one. Brown will get more attention because it's, you know, because it's an IV.
[00:14:01] So it, it's more kind of sensational or it'll get more media attention because quite frankly,
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_02: a lot of media went to Brown. But there will be a mass shooting tomorrow in America. So it's,
[00:14:13] SPEAKER_02: it's, it's, it's like that onion headline. America claims that the problem can't be solved in
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_02: the only nation. This problem exists. And this notion that we live in a democracy, we don't. We live,
[00:14:26] we live in a country with a passive majority that is weaponized by a well-funded and organized
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_02: special interest groups. And probably number four or five now, but still very popular is the NRA.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_02: And 90% of Americans now believe in some sort of safe and sane gun regulation.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_02: I do. It's, it's, and we can't get it through. Well, there's got there.
[00:14:48] This is, it's repulsive, it's repulsive. But our, our condolence got to the people in Von
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_04: Dij and at Brown and obviously the Reiner family. I'm going to be in Bondi in two weeks.
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_02: Bondi in two weeks. Oh, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful place. It's a tragedy to be a place.
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, we should move on onto the news. But first, Sam Altman, the more exes such a weird trust. Sorry,
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_04: let me just switch to a code red. Yeah, so weird altitude change. Yeah. Yeah. Which he implemented
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_04: to improve chat GPT against competition after the launch of its GPT five two model. He's going to,
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_04: he's going to exit code red. I don't believe code red. By the way, speaking of which Rob Reiner,
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_04: let me just say, may just one more thing about Rob Reiner. What an incredible artist this guy left behind
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_04: besides being on all in the family. He did a few good men. He did stand by me. He did the princess
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_04: bride. He did one Harry Med Sally. It goes on and on and on and turn. And then personally,
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_04: his impact. The reason we have gay marriage started in California. Rob Reiner was one of the
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_04: major people around it. Same thing with preschool for kids. Just I don't care how much the Trump
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_04: people hate this guy or hated this guy. He what an incredible, the effective progressive he was.
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_04: And also a beautiful filmmaker. Some of my favorite films and code red. Code red is an important
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_04: part of a few good men. Did you call the gold red? You and I were on a call with Rob Reiner.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_02: Just a couple weeks ago. And it's very civic-minded. Yeah. Yeah. They were trying to figure out
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_04: something to do to boycott around immigration. He was focused in on immigrants being abused
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_04: by the Trump administration. He was, you know, he just a classic. The guy he played on all the
[00:16:36] SPEAKER_04: family, Mike Stivitz, he was that guy, right? He was sort of that was him in many ways. Anyway,
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_04: speaking of code red, which that is one of my favorite movies of all time. I love every bit about
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_04: it, but the direction is so critical for the word being so good. It's with Tom Cruise, Demi,
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_04: Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson. He did the sure thing, that was him. Yeah, he's an astonishing artist.
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_04: And also an actor. Oh my God, he did misery. That's an amazing film. Wow. He had a run
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_04: from in the 1980s to the 90s. It was like one friggin' hit after the next. It's crazy and important
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_04: movies that last the test of, you know, that last the test of time. Like that's what it is. It's like,
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_04: I go back to all those movies and they're so expertly directed. The American president, remember that one?
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And then that became the West Wing. The single Michael Douglas is president.
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Then it became the West Wing. This is spinal tap. Oh, spinal tap. Oh, how could I leave that out?
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_04: Plus he just released the second one recently. And just astonishing talent. My favorite was he
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_04: was in, he had a lot of roles over the years in various things, mostly comedies, but he was in
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_04: the Wolf of Wall Street as the accountant. Yeah. And my favorite line. Did he play his father?
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure. He was doing the county and he goes, I'm not sure he was his father. He goes,
[00:17:56] prostitutes, take credit cards. And then the line was, yeah, the expensive ones. It was the way he
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_04: said prostitutes, like he's screaming. And then he goes, prostitutes, take credit cards. And it was
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_04: just fantastic. Man. Anyway, okay, when we want to code red at OpenAI, that's the reference he's
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_04: using there. He implemented it because he evolved a competition, especially from Jim Google's
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_04: Gemini. Almond said the release of the Gemini three models had less of an impact on a company
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_04: than the originally feared. We'll see. In other open AI news, the company will end a compensation
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_04: poly that required employees to work at the company for at least six months before their equity
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_04: fasts. So what's happening here? I don't know. I think they're panicking. I think they heard
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_02: Kuroswischer kept keep keep comparing them to Netscape. No, yeah, I should think I think that
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_02: analogy is becoming more and more apt by the day. And it's an incredible company. The question is
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_02: can they maintain momentum from 500 billion? And the thing that struck me, Cara, was I saw that
[00:18:55] SpaceX leaked a rumor that they're thinking about going public. Yeah. And then pretended they didn't,
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_04: and that they're they threw a number out there. Who knows how real it is? At a trillion and a half
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_02: dollar pricing. Right now, they say they're raising money or selling shares at about 800 billion.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_02: Open AI is at 500 billion. Now, they're both right now about the same revenue level, except SpaceX
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_02: is going much, much slower. SpaceX went from 13 billion last year. They're projected to do
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_02: 15 this year. It's not growing that fast. Yeah. Well, there's only so much space, right? But
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_02: but the difference is in terms of modes and defensibility and sustainability. And that is
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_02: the amazing thing about a digital business is it can scale incredibly fast. The downside is that
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_02: it can be disrupted almost as fast. And that is the reason why SpaceX at a lower growth rate in a
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_02: similar revenue is trading at two to three or 60 to 200 percent more than a company that's
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_02: growing much faster open AI is because it is very unlikely. In two years, someone else is going to
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_02: have 90 percent of space launch market share. The ability and that's why Amazon, I think,
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_02: is value is so enduring. We're also focused on digital. But the reality is if you can put in place
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_02: warehouses, 747s, you know, trucking, space launch vehicles, atoms are more defensible than bits.
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_02: Oh, interesting observation. I like that. Well, it's harder to do. It's harder to scale up,
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_02: but it would make sense. It's more defensible. Yeah. Well, let me just go ahead. Sorry.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_04: Just struck me that SpaceX is trading it more. It's growing much slower, same revenue, and is
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_02: much more valuable than open AI because people realize if you were to say, okay, one of these two
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_02: firms is going to decline by 80 percent share in the next 24 months. Open AI or SpaceX.
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_02: Would you think that happened? Open AI. Yeah. 100 percent. That said, I have to say, I still use
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_04: chat to be more, right? And I, Gemini, just as imposed upon me by Google, because I use Google,
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_04: right? I don't go to get. Did you love Explorer? Did you love Microsoft Explorer? That's
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_02: capable of better browser. I agree, but it's own. Well, right now, I'm using it because of this,
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_04: because Riverside, but I usually Safari. But Google, one of the things it's related,
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_04: speaking of, of defensible businesses, Google has removed videos with Disney characters after
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_04: being hit with a cease and desist letter from the company saying it's AI and fringes on its copy,
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_04: right? To content on a massive scale, the complaint focuses on unauthorized AI generated videos and
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_04: images of Disney characters, particularly on YouTube. The move comes shortly after Disney struck
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_04: a deal with open AI. It picked its winner, right? As we discussed last week. I, I, when and call
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_04: the lot of people after this, because I was sort of, so a lot of people had sort of mixed feelings
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_04: on Disney doing this, like they're giving in essentially. Seems to me, I think they got learned a lot
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_04: from social media and everything else that to stay out of it was a mistake early on. And so they
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_04: wanted to pick one and then fight the others. And so I don't necessarily, everyone's like, oh,
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_04: you're giving away your C-corn, you shouldn't do this. Like, I don't quite know what Disney would do
[00:22:08] SPEAKER_04: otherwise, right? I think making an investment, which they did in OpenAI, gives them a stake in
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_04: the game, right? They're not going to get to make a similar investment in Google. It gives them
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_04: an ability to have some insight into how this is going and how it works the way. Eventually,
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_04: all the companies did on YouTube. If you remember, Philippe Daumann, that really terrible executive
[00:22:32] SPEAKER_04: sued YouTube. And it just didn't work out. It just didn't work out the way they did it.
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_04: But rather, they'd rather find a legal way to have this work out because eventually,
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_04: they're going to have to strike deals with all of them. And I think being both aggressive and
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_04: non-aggressive is probably the right way to go. But I don't feel like Disney had another choice.
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_04: And then it could say to OpenAI, whether it was able to do this, if someone's doing something
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_04: in Hinky with Princess Jasmine and the snowman from Frozen, you better get it done. You better get
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_04: it off kind of thing. So I just feel like they kind of had to do it. And it's the best way to learn
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_04: on this stuff. And using OpenAI, probably they're more cooperative than a Google might be.
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_04: But you know, and it's going to hinder all these every single company is going to have a deal
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_04: like this, presumably. I don't know. But all of them will have them with all of them, like they
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_04: did with YouTube in the end. I think you're exactly right. I think this is a good move for both of them.
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_02: And the key here is there was criticism. There was a lot of criticism. But right now, Disney
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_02: doesn't have the capital, both human, both human or financial capital to build their own LLM.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_02: And they want to experiment. And it's all the proof is in the pudding. And that is I'd love to see
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_02: the terms of this deal. If I were Disney, I'd want to make sure we're going to experiment, but you do
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_02: not have an any way long term rights, AI rights around these characters. It's a 12-month thing. We'll
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_02: say it's working for both of us. But I go back to the same thing. And that is you want the deepest
[00:24:04] pocketed companies in the world that creating the most shareholder value are these AI-centered companies.
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_02: You want as many as possible because you want Disney to have the ability in 12 months to go to
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_02: Gemini or to go to Lama or even to go to one of the Chinese players and say, all right,
[00:24:22] you've seen what OpenAI can do with our characters. Our two or three-year relationship will be up in
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_02: six months. Who's got the biggest check for us? And otherwise, if there's only one, if there's
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_02: only going to be one bit or an AI and the arms race sort of connotes that they all sort of believe
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_02: there might be one player. You want as many as bitters as possible. Otherwise, you're going to further
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_02: leak human capital from the creative community, the Los Angeles community and from Disney shareholders
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_02: and from consumers to the one player and OpenAI. So I'm for I'm for I hope that
[00:24:55] did a lot of the content creators get together and quite frankly partner with the number two and
[00:25:00] SPEAKER_04: just play them off against each other. I know it's make sure that there's a really a really
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_02: healthy, healthy ecosystem. They didn't do it at the YouTube. Do you remember when SNL went on YouTube,
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_04: you know, those movie shorts? It got onto YouTube and YouTube did everything possible to take it down.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_04: And I remember YouTube didn't, the company did. I think SNL did NBC. I remember being with NBC
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_04: executive and like, let it stay there. What are you talking about? Everyone's talking about it now,
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_04: right? And they just were like, we have to take it down. They're stealing our things. I'm like,
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_04: well, make it deal with them. It was, I think the way they handle at the beginning was something
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_04: somewhat evil I did when I was running my all things de conferences. We had Philippe down and when
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_04: he was suing YouTube and also Eric Schmidt on. And I put them back to back with each other on stage.
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_04: And Eric Schmidt, it Philippe Downen wanted to talk to Eric Schmidt and he Eric ran into the bathroom.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_04: He didn't want to talk to him. Eventually they settled. But it just seemed to me the wrong
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_04: approach at the time, even though let me say, I think Google was fast and loose with that content
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_04: in order to build this business. I think they stole it. Google has a compensating anybody back then.
[00:26:04] SPEAKER_02: No, they weren't. I think they were stealing people. I think they were stealing. But then they,
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_04: by the time it was too late and they should have done deals with them. But anyway, we'll move on.
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_04: Okay, Scott, when we come back after break Oracle has its own code red moment.

[00:27:33] Okay, Scott and back since we're talking about red happy Christmas Scott happy holiday.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_04: Can we say Christmas again? Of course.
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, happy Hanukkah. Happy everything. This is my hat. I have so many hats. Look at this.
[00:27:48] What do you think? How do I look? I think you look great. I think it's really cute.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I like it too. I like a Christmas. I have a Grinch hat too by the way. I'll
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_04: send it to you. I've seen these videos. What? I don't know. It makes me so happy and it's so wrong.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_02: Have you seen these videos of grown men dressing up as Grinch and terrorizing old children?
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_02: Oh, no. There was one at the Christmas fair the other day where we used to live and
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_04: kids love the Grinch. Oh no. Was he trying to terrorize kids?
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_02: This is videos of three-year-olds being traumatized for life.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_02: A Grinch character breaking into the house and stealing gifts and children.
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_02: Oh, no. It is so wonderful and it's so wrong. I actually was at a bar in a
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_02: prostitute walked in in order of glass of wine. Yeah.
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_02: And the bartender said, what did you ask Santa for? Santa for? And she said $30, just like everyone else.
[00:28:47] I, that's not even funny. Never mind. You got to, you got to up your Christmas or jokes.
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, as I said, oracles having a soul. He's such an asshole. Santa knows what the naughty girls
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_02: are and he doesn't tell anyone else. That's true. Look at code red, warm at code red.
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_04: The company stock fell 14% last week out, down 45% from a September high, which was far too high.
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, after the latest earnings showed soaring catbacks and rising debt tied to its massive AI
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_04: build out, make it all kinds of bets. There was also a report claiming several Oracle
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_04: data centers tied to its $300 billion open-aid contract have been delayed.
[00:29:24] SPEAKER_04: Really, Oracle denies the delays, said it remains confidence, the ability to meet its
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_04: obligations and future expansion plans. Ooh, Oracle went a little far on this, I thought.
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_04: Didn't you? I don't know. It's also related. There's a paramount factor in this. The host will
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_04: bid for Warner Brothers discoveries back in part by billions from Oracle co-founder, Larry Leriel says.
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_04: But he isn't, he isn't guaranteeing it the way Elon had a guarantee his purchase of Twitter.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_04: Warner Brothers Board is concerned that he didn't do this and plans to contribute equity
[00:29:52] SPEAKER_04: through a trust. It's kind of in a GQA. He's that red. He should just put up the money.
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_04: Paramount is calling concerns about its financing absurd. I mean, obviously, he's rich.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_04: That's true. But he's that red. You should personally guarantee it. If you're Warner Brothers,
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_04: do you write to be concerned about Big Daddy not giving his personal guarantee? I don't know, Scott,
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_04: both of these things. I mean, obviously, the stock is down rather significantly, so he's not
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_04: quite as rich, but he's still massively wealthy. Yeah, I think if it just comes down to money
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_02: and it probably will, I think that Alison probably, I mean, there's a bunch of, there's a bunch of
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_02: play here. One, so first off, the lesson here, and I would tell this to anybody listening,
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_02: and I was told this at a very young age, and I've lived up to this and never signed a personal
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_02: guarantee. Just never. You don't know what'll happen, and it's a way how smart people, it's a way,
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_02: it's how smart rich people go broke. You don't know, you don't know what can happen. Never,
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_02: I have never done this, and I would suggest anyone listening to this podcast, never sign a personal
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_02: guarantee. All right, and just so Pima, no, Elon did this in the Twitter fight, but go ahead.
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_04: I think it's, I think it's just, let Elon do it. Alison has more money personally than anyone
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_02: involved because he's been selling stock and he personally is super wealthy, not only in stock,
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_02: but also Netflix is a bit constrained too because Netflix is debt to evit to ratio. They have,
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_02: and they only have a, they have cash flow, they manage against that 18 billion dollars year.
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_02: So I think if it's pure, if these guys go really crazy, I mean, it's what, Alison can go crazy,
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_02: and all like that, Alison's about to die. He's an old man. So does he really care,
[00:31:35] like it's head surround us? That's not according to him. He has a longevity institute,
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_04: he's going to live forever. Yeah, but head surround us is around for another 40 years. Yeah.
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_04: Larry, Alison is not. Yeah. And so quite frankly, I think Larry, Alison is more likely to do what a
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_02: lot of old men do, and that is make an irrational move. Yeah, interesting. That's interesting. But
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_04: I'm saying, the more important is using it as a concern. What do you think? You're even more.
[00:32:01] They want, of course, when you're, when you're, I have a scarce asset, part of the negotiation is
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_02: the certainty of clothes and the certainty of financing. So whenever I bought a house, what's
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_02: really fun to do is show up with an all cash offer. Right? But most people can't do that. Most people
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_02: have put in contingencies around finding a mortgage. And sometimes, and sometimes, like a really
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_02: weak offer, someone says, I have contingencies. Not all of them, I need to find financing. I need to
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_02: sell the house. I'm in now to buy the house. So if he was willing to show up and say, I'm the
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_02: third wealthiest man in the world, and I'm signing a personal guarantee, then disco, right?
[00:32:35] SPEAKER_02: So they're going to want us, they're going to want you to do as much as possible. But
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_02: yeah, I don't, it just is a general rule. You never sign a person.
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_02: Is that a good excuse for the Warner Brothers more to say, well, I have to be like,
[00:32:47] SPEAKER_04: that's random. So is signing a personal guarantee? No, I get it. But the
[00:32:49] SPEAKER_02: elephants are making a big deal of their Trump affiliations, how rich they are. But you know what I
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_04: mean? Like everybody has their own little move, essentially. But Ted Serendos is not buying it net
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_04: flexes, right? And they've made an offer with stock and cash. That is guaranteed, presumably.
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_04: You know what? I feel like every minute I'm like, Paramount's going to get it. Netflix is going to
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_02: get it. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's what I feel. Yeah. I'm having a tough time handicapping this one.
[00:33:15] SPEAKER_02: And I think it's going to be, I think Paramount has to get it. Netflix does not have to, it's not
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_04: it's a, it's not even, it's an important thing for it to get. But it's not a must have. Yeah,
[00:33:28] we know it got me thinking. What? Cara, I actually think in the next 90 days. Yeah.
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_04: If not maybe not 90, I was going to the time wrong. I think Disney is going to be put in play.
[00:33:39] Oh, yeah. That's what we talked about. And the, the likely buyer there will be Apple. I mean,
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_02: think it, keep in mind, whoever bulks up here, whether it's Paramount bulking up or Netflix bulking up,
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_02: right? Where does that leave Disney? Where does that leave Apple? Where does that leave YouTube?
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_02: It leaves them less bulky. Yes, I brought that up with Disney executives. They're not commenting.
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_04: But I agree. They're not big enough. And by the way, Disney's stock, it would, that would be
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_02: the biggest take private in history. Correct. Disney's like 200. They have to go up to like 300.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_02: But that would be hard to get through the government period and whatever government it happens to be.
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_04: But Disney, do you know where the stock is? The stock is the same place it was 10 years ago. Yeah, I know.
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_02: And talk about IP. You want to see, you want to see people salivate over IP. Right.
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_04: I mean, Darth Vader, Demawana, I mean, Moana live is coming out. Those parks. You want to talk about,
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_02: we were just talking about. Great. Was utopia, by the way. It continues to win in many ways.
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah. And you want to talk about a mode around Adams versus bits, the parks. Jesus Christ.
[00:34:41] SPEAKER_02: If I said to you, if I said to you, okay, one of these things is down by 50% in three years.
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_02: You see the Netflix subscribers or park attendance. What would you pick? Of course, Netflix. Well, I don't know.
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_04: People love their Netflix. They do love them Netflix. And also has the Taylor Swift era's
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_04: documentary on it. So, no, that's one Disney. That's one Disney. I think the parks, I think the parks
[00:35:05] SPEAKER_02: are the literally the crown jewel in the Disney portfolio. Yeah. Well, we'll see. Keep in mind,
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_04: they were buying land in Florida for the better part of decade under false LLCs. Yeah.
[00:35:15] SPEAKER_02: To a mass millions and millions of acres. They're very clever people. But let me go back to the
[00:35:20] SPEAKER_04: Oracle stock. It's really falling. And like this commitments, they have a massive. Okay. But,
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_02: okay, meanwhile though, it's, it's, it's flat over the past year. So, okay, it's back to where it was.
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. In June. So we always talk of it. It's dropped dramatically from a massive spike. And
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_02: the head fake here was Sam Altman and Larry Ellison announcing a quote-unquote framework for a
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_02: $300 billion purchase and compute. I would love to see the terms of that contract. I think that
[00:35:52] was nothing but a joint press release. It's like what famous people date each other. Their
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_02: publicists are really dating each other. This is, it's like, they're not fucking. Their publicists
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_02: are fucking and that would be, I got a great press release to say, you know, Chris Hemsworth is
[00:36:05] SPEAKER_02: dating. Yeah. You know, I'll tell you of all the stocks though, if they get hit, Oracle will be
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_04: the one that gets hit the most. It's already been hit pretty well. It's down 40% in a month or
[00:36:16] SPEAKER_02: some like that. But it has a great core business. Yeah. Um, anyways, the, the, the, I think all
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_02: of media now is in play. And whoever, whoever ends up owning this, the other guys are severely
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_02: diminished. If Paramount doesn't get this, they've got to go shopping. They got to get some.
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_04: And then there's, and then there's keep in mind that the player we're not talking about.
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_02: I think Apple has invested enough in Apple TV Plus that it can't let it just die.
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_02: Right. Yeah. And it's a distant fifth now, but it's owned by a company worth three and a half
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_02: trillion dollars. Well, the, the CEO, the new CEO will have to, this is going to be a Tim Cook one.
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_04: This is going to be the new CEO making a big move, right? Presumably whoever that happens to be.
[00:37:00] Yeah, I could also, and also it'll have to be a different CEO than Bob Igar. He won't do this.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_04: I could see an activist coming in the entire soon. I don't know. There's, there's, it is just going
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_02: to be whoever gets this, it will inspire a lot of just playing by the other players because of
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_02: Paramount. If Netflix isn't, if you want to talk about all of a sudden, the Paramount acquisition
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_02: looks like they dramatically overpaid the day Netflix HBO closes Paramount Plus just looks
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_02: fucked. They look fucked. And they have to, they have to joint mob up with someone and there's no
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_04: mobbing. And because I think Disney either goes to Apple or goes, you know, if Netflix doesn't get this,
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_04: you can see Netflix and app, I mean, Disney coming together to, you can see that. Yeah, that would be
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_04: a merger because I think, I think Netflix is another thing that government probably would probably
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_04: run out of it. And, and Disney said 200. Yeah. But we're now in a point where the unthinkable in
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_02: terms of size of acquisition, Disney used to be too big to acquire. That's no longer true. Yeah,
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_02: no, get ready Elizabeth Warren. You're going to have some stuff. You know who gets, I mean, Christ,
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_02: I want to micr, my mind just blown here that these things, some of the biggest, everything now,
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_02: it's technology in the seven doors, everything's being run and dictated by the wealth or paper loss
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_02: is or who would have thought that the likelihood that paramount would buy Warner Brothers would be
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_02: based on oracle, kid and his daddy. Right. That's just because it's a rich kid in his dad.
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_04: This makes no economic. But oracle, stability, the position themselves as a number two infrastructure
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_02: player is the fallcrumb of the acquisition of Batman. I know. It's crazy. It's going to remember
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_04: many years ago. You don't remind me. My mind is blown. Kara. When I was doing that comcast thing,
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_04: I said they're not still not, they're none of them are going to be big enough years ago. I said
[00:38:49] SPEAKER_04: this. They're not going to be big enough. And so all these anti-trust people are going to have a hard
[00:38:53] SPEAKER_04: time stopping. And don't count the Roberts out. Yeah. You don't become billionaires in Philadelphia,
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_02: unless you have killed a lot of people and are really smart. And you're really nice people too.
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_04: You're very friendly for killers. Anyway, all right. Let's go on a quick break. We come back. Donald
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_04: Trump's new AI executive order. Okay, Scott, we're back after a little ball adjustment, little white balls.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_04: I thought I felt something. I got to say I just maintain eye contact. Is that up against your
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_04: balls? Your Christmas fall on me. Next wise. Next. We're back. We're back. Anyway, President Trump just
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_04: signed an AI executive order to effectively neuter individual state laws regulating artificial
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_04: intelligence. The order directs the DOJ to sue states and overturn laws that do not support
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_04: quote the United States global AI dominance. Trump is also directing federal regulators to withhold
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_04: funds for broadband and other projects of states keep their laws in place. Child,
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_04: safety laws are exempt from this order. At least for now, the order, which is sparked opposition
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_04: on both sides of the aisle, is likely to be challenging. Court on the grounds that it's idiotic
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_04: that only Congress has the authority to override state laws. Trump has been complaining about a
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_04: patchwork of state AI laws. So by by the way, Donald, but do you think he and David Sacks who really
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_04: push this will actually push to get a federal law? No, I do not. This is all about politics and not
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_04: about policies. It's an issue dividing Republicans to Governor Rhonda Sanders called this executive
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_04: a big subsidy to big tech and he's right. Marjorie Taylor Greens against it. They'll pack
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_04: of people on both sides against it. And frankly, it's just it's going to be stopped in courts.
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_04: And that's the problem is that they don't want to pass federal laws that would
[00:40:26] be make sense. And instead, they just want to play politics of power here so that they don't get
[00:40:31] SPEAKER_04: they want to stop all regulation is what they want. But they're not interested in regulation.
[00:40:35] SPEAKER_04: They're interested in stopping all regulation, which is not the same things, which is politics
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_04: and not policy. So this is going to be going to go on a court. And then by in by November,
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_04: Trump's not going to be able to do any of this crap. So that's and and he's on the downward. He'll
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_04: so obviously that none of this is going to work. So sorry, David Sacks. Good try though.
[00:40:56] SPEAKER_04: Good try. So we'll see. Go ahead. You go ahead. Yeah, I think you're right. And that is
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_02: the government is a big fan of state's rights when it comes to gun control or bodily autonomy.
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_02: But all of a sudden they've decided we need mandatory federal legislation around or regulation
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_02: around AI. And this is we don't have. And this is the mandatory federal regulation. They'll have
[00:41:18] SPEAKER_02: dick. They won't have anything. They will have dick. They will have dick. Because effectively,
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_02: the Trump administration's ability to send secret police into cities and the entire economy is
[00:41:29] SPEAKER_02: a giant bet on AI. And so they don't want any regulation. They gets in the way of their thoroughbreds
[00:41:34] SPEAKER_02: running. And you're going to see in my view, in this one of my predictions for 26, you're going
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_02: to see what is positioned as an investment, but effectively will be a bailout of these guys in
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_02: the form of government back debt to continue this this this crazy champagne and cocaine disco
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_02: party of data centers and chip acquisition. But essentially the Trump administration has said,
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_02: I don't care if it means leaking capital from the 490 of the S&P 500 to the 10. He's all in on AI.
[00:42:06] And the last thing they're going to let happen or they're going to try and let happen is any sort
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_02: of regulation. And it's insane that we're not looking at synthetic relationships. It's insane
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_02: that we're not looking at. Well, some states are not our government, but not our federal government.
[00:42:21] SPEAKER_04: Some states are starting to do this. And that's why they want to stop it. Well, that's right. And
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_02: they're claiming that it's it's that we need one unified. Having a unified operating system
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_02: and something is complicated as AI across the 50 states makes sense. The problem is that's just
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_02: a false flag. They just want no regulation. That's right. That is correct. That is correct. These
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_04: people, the remember that bond movie, the world is not enough. That's what they are. I just
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_04: remember the bond girl. She was the bond girl in it. I don't remember. That wasn't on a top.
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_04: Was it on a top on a top on a top? That wasn't that one. I don't remember. It was. Oh, it's Pierce,
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_02: Prozman. Sophie Marceau. Oh, did he? Oh, yeah, no, no, that was later. That's with that's what Daniel
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_04: Craig didn't he? Strictards. No, no, she's in the one with a bomb. Oh, really? Yeah, she's
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_04: remember she's a nuclear physicist. I don't know. Best name ever. Holly Goodhead. She was Christmas.
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_04: She was some Merry Christmas or something like that was her name. So excited about the next bond.
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, yeah, this is what we feel. This is a bullshit, David's ax. Sorry, but good try. Good try.
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_04: It's not going to work. It's going to get sucked up into court and then your big daddy Trump
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_04: is going to be on the downhill slide. So you're trying your best to get something happening before
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_04: that. But you're not going to make that happen. It's going to get stopped in court and it has
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_04: bipartisan support from at some point, they're going to the Congress is going to reach down and
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_04: feel as balls and stop all this nonsense. Anyway, one more quick break will be back for wins and
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_04: fails. Okay, Scott, some wins and fails. Would you like me to go first? You're first. Okay, my fail.
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_04: Was this measles outbreak in South Carolina is accelerating with over a hundred reported cases.
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_04: Even Fox News put up a thing that that measles has gone up. I think it's 14,000 percent in the
[00:44:08] SPEAKER_04: Trump administration, this new Trump administration. The fact that anyone's getting measles at all
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_04: is like to become best friend to measles is astonishing. Many of these diseases are diseases we
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_04: have solved many years ago and decades ago. And and fact that people are getting measles, which
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_04: is very deadly everybody just so you know, it's not just, you know, sometimes it's just spots on
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_04: your face a lot of times. It's incredibly debilitating or fatal. The fact that they're
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_04: accelerating South Carolina and Texas, all these places, will you people get a fucking
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_04: measles vaccine? Like it really is, oh, the efficacy is so great and the the the rarity of any
[00:44:50] SPEAKER_04: problems and as it's showing what's happening is a lot of this data that they're showing where
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_04: COVID is a problem or there were 10 deaths. It's all it's really nonsense data. They're lying
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_04: to you about this in order to pass with the get and Robert Kennedy. He will get a pardon by
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_04: Trump, but he should go to jail for what he's been doing. That's my feeling. As I've said, my when,
[00:45:10] SPEAKER_04: I was going to say the gay hockey show he did rivalry, which I think you'll like. It's hockey
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_04: wives with men. Yeah, it's a really hot gay hot. It's been, Canada has brought us a tale of
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_04: for bin love between hockey players and it is very hot. Let me just say it's very, very hot and
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_04: I am not a big fish in auto of gay porn, but there you have it. It's really as well as it's like
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_04: romance. That's not your genre. It's not my genre, but I like it. But I was going to give it to that,
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_04: but I have to say again, you've got me onto this this episode of pleuribus, the gap was a
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_03: ston- people either don't like it or like it. Nothing happens in this episode, but it does.
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_03: There's no words. They don't. The two characters, this guy coming up from Paraguay and
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_04: Ria C. Horn, who's amazing as Carol, was just, it was so beautiful an episode. He takes so much
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_04: gods, as you said, Vince Gillian, in the middle of your hit season, and by the way, I think this will
[00:46:11] SPEAKER_04: end up being the most important thing Apple's done and possibly on streaming right now.
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_04: In the middle of your season, you pull this shit. I love it. I love every bit of it. It was,
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_04: so I think about it all week, every single aspect of those shows and the things they do. And if I
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_04: were Carol, Alessby, and stuck by myself, I would, I too would golf into a window. I would drive
[00:46:34] SPEAKER_04: golf wigs into a skyscraper window and really enjoy doing it. And I just, I love both characters.
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_04: And I'm excited for them to meet. I assume in the next episode. But I got to say it takes a
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_04: set, speaking of balls again, not pucks, to do this, to do the way they do it. All right, that's my win.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_04: Go ahead. So I'll start with my fail. My fail is face the nations, incredibly odd framing of a
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_02: question to Senator Bill Cassidy this past Sunday. Literally, I love Margaret Brennan. I love
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_02: face the nation. It's one of the many ways I communicate to my sons that I'm 140 fucking years old
[00:47:16] SPEAKER_02: as I love watching face the nation. But I asked the team to just queue up this one question.
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_02: Do we have the question? CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_00: abortion drug, myth of pristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_00: conduct one. And abortion groups want this review to take place. I saw a letter the FDA commissioner
[00:47:41] SPEAKER_00: sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not,
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_00: what are you doing about it? That is nothing. But wide washed Sunday morning,
[00:47:56] Vaseline over wholesale misogyny. The framing of the question. Are there has the FDA
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_02: made conducted investigations? No, they haven't conducted investigations into Advil or
[00:48:13] SPEAKER_02: Arithra, mayas and either. Why? Because this is an FDA approved drug with the American College
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_02: of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other leading medical organizations have stated that
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_02: myth of pristone is in open quote, incredibly safe medication. And that complications are exceedingly
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_02: rare, usually minor and easily treatable as a matter of fact. And there's peer-reviewed research
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_02: on this. The US death rate from childbirth is about 14 times higher than from any legally-induced
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_02: abortion. All methods, including the safest, which is myth, excuse me, which is myth of pristone.
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_02: And to frame it as, oh, there's a concern. They aren't, they aren't looking at this investigating it
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_02: is a such an incredible far right talking point that somehow to claim that you give a flying
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_02: fuck about women's health by undermining women's health, by sowing doubt of which there is no medical
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_02: evidence that lends any veracity to that doubt. Yes, it's called reporting and they're not doing it
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_04: at the current CBS. They're, they're taking a heritage talking point. That is right. And sowing
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_02: doubt from a show and a journalist who never used to do this bullshit. Well, she also has done it
[00:49:53] SPEAKER_04: several times since the purchase by Paramount, which I warned you about. It gives me no pleasure,
[00:49:58] SPEAKER_04: but Margaret, what in the actual fuck are you doing? Go ahead. But the framing of this question
[00:50:03] SPEAKER_02: creates doubt around this drug. Yes, that's the point, which is it is such it is so irresponsible
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_02: and such an abuse of a brand that has taken that has taken decades to just asking questions, Scott,
[00:50:17] SPEAKER_02: just asking that is the attitude towards the people who run CBS news. Asking a conservative senator
[00:50:23] SPEAKER_02: a talking point that somehow frames it as your concern. If she, if they were to say people on
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_02: the far right believe that this is, this is murder and they want it looked into or okay fine. But
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_02: to pretend this is about women's health under the auspice of trying to create doubt around at a very
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_02: effective means of bodily autonomy, which is the definition of women's health is just I mean,
[00:50:55] SPEAKER_02: I'm holding CBS the show and quite frankly, Margaret Brennan, what the fuck are you thinking?
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_02: I might sentence exactly you. Margaret Brennan is a star. You have leverage. You should not be reading
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_02: the talking points from project 2025. This one was repulsive. It really is. I appreciate it. Scott,
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_04: I love you. I love you. I stopped the show and I'm like, did I just hear this correctly? That's correct.
[00:51:23] SPEAKER_02: And I want to I want on YouTube and I'm threads and I'm like, what the fuck? What the actual
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_02: and it's so dis and anyway, I'm going to move on. I'm just saying they had they had the whole the
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_04: whole CBS new pit news page was a nothing burger of an Eric a Kirk interview. So I told you this
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_04: would happen, but go ahead. I was right. I was right. And I was right. The new novel. The new novel
[00:51:49] SPEAKER_02: from from questions. This is my one without any backing. Let's be honest. This isn't about me.
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_02: Okay, I want to win. I want to win. Okay, this really is a one. It's the gay hockey players.
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_02: The gay goki. Oh, that's right. So, um,
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_02: Eric Christmas balls. I didn't know that a lot of balls in that. I didn't know the gay. I didn't
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_02: know there were a lot of gay hockey players. Oh my god. All the people are talking about it. Well,
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_04: I do. I mean, they do start to mean deck. Yeah, I do. That question that took never gets hold.
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Anyways, so my win is care. I'm at that age. I posted on Instagram. Uh, and this isn't
[00:52:24] this isn't a this isn't about me. It's not a big loss for me. The individual I'm about to talk
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_02: about. I hadn't seen in decades, but there was a core group of eight of us in the fraternity and
[00:52:34] SPEAKER_02: one of them is Brad love who passed away this week after a battle with pancreatic cancer.
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_02: And obviously that's not my win. And I want I don't want it's not it's not a big loss for me.
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_02: I'm seeing Brad in 30 years, but my win is the following. My win is a close friend named David
[00:52:50] SPEAKER_02: Kingstale, who was part of our core group. And the last few years, Brad had struggled on a number
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_02: of levels, including in terms of his relationships with his family. And David, who is this he was
[00:53:03] present of our fraternity captain of our football team, just like the ultimate kind of like aspirational
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_02: alpha male and a really decent man, he had spent the better part of the last two years coordinating
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_02: and caring for Brad in terms of his health care. Uh, I would get a call from David. This couldn't
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_02: have been easy for David. I say, do you know anyone at theaters? I'm trying to get him into the
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_02: right physical therapy. Do you know anyone? Do you know what surgeon here? He was there have been
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_02: studies showing that the most important thing in health care is that you have an advocate. And
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_02: that is you have someone who loves you and someone who's looking out for you. And here was David Kingstale
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_02: looking after Brad. Anyways, the, the, you know, I think a lot about happiness. And I just had David
[00:53:47] SPEAKER_02: Brooks on my podcast and the biggest studies of its kind, I'll say that happiness comes down to
[00:53:58] the number of deep and meaningful relationships. That's not a spoiler. Uh, or that seems somewhat
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_02: obvious. But the wrinkle in it that's really interesting is that the happiest people aren't the ones
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_02: who are love the most. It's the ones that have the most people to love, right? They'd find,
[00:54:15] did find relationships where they find people who will love them. William Macy has a great line in
[00:54:20] SPEAKER_02: the film. Magnolia where he says, I have love to give. I just don't know where to give it. And I
[00:54:25] SPEAKER_02: was, I've been thinking a lot about David. He just demonstrated so much character when Brad was so
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_02: vulnerable. Here was a guy, really competent guy who was known for 40 years, calling everyone,
[00:54:37] finding, finding helping raise money for Brad, finding the right doctors. And this is a guy with
[00:54:42] SPEAKER_02: his own life, his own career, his own life and his own kids. And it just got me thinking that the
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_02: happiest people are able to find others where they can put a lot of love. Anyways, my wind is David
[00:54:52] SPEAKER_02: Kingsdale who found a, uh, who placed a lot of love in regard and gave a lot of comfort
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_02: to our friend Brad love at the end of his life. So my wind is David Kingsdale. Well, all that's
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_04: lovely. Scott, that is, it's time. This is the time, especially when we should be thinking about
[00:55:10] SPEAKER_04: so weird. Our friends are dying, Cara. It's so weird. It's true. That's the way it goes.
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_04: But not today, not today, not today. And by the way, Scott, I would take care of you.
[00:55:22] I appreciate all count on that. Just bring, just bring that hat. It's going to be some facelift.
[00:55:28] SPEAKER_04: I need you to do two things. I need you to bring the hat and Emily Rodikowski.
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_02: I will. I will bring her. If you weren't, if you had some facelift gone awry, that's how it's
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_04: a good chance. That's a good chance. Some Joe River's action. Me and George Khan will do everything
[00:55:43] SPEAKER_04: it takes to get Emily Rodikowski at your bedside with this hat. I appreciate that. I'm going to send
[00:55:48] SPEAKER_04: it to you. I appreciate that. Has a single white ball. That's how you operate. Look at this. See?
[00:55:53] SPEAKER_04: Anyway, well, that's a lovely, that's a lovely thing to say. But again, I feel my gay pucks
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_04: are much better. Okay, we want to hear from you. Send us your question about business tech or
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_04: whatever's on your mind. Go to nymag.com slash pivots. Submit a question for the shower called
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_04: 85551 pivot and elsewhere in the Karen Scott universe this week on on with Kara Swisher. I spoke
[00:56:14] SPEAKER_04: with podcaster and neuroscientist Sam Harris. We talked about why so many tech billionaires have
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_04: embraced Trump's authoritarian politics. Of course, we did. Let's listen to a clip. No one ever
[00:56:24] SPEAKER_01: has to give a rational accounting of how their views have changed. I mean, they're, you know, after
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_01: January 6th, some of the guys on the the all-in podcast. I think I think it was Tramath, most
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_01: vocally, you know, in the aftermath of January 6th. I think he said that, you know, Trump should
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_01: be in jail for the rest of his life, right? It's like so how these guys can't went from there
[00:56:47] SPEAKER_01: to where they are now is has never been explained, right? And they feel no burden to explain it
[00:56:52] SPEAKER_01: because they have cultivated audiences that simply don't care about these kinds of ethical
[00:56:58] SPEAKER_01: issues. Now we're doing this. Now we're doing this. Yeah, I think that was great. And he also
[00:57:02] SPEAKER_04: noted that they will go right back and pretend it never happened when things go dark, which they
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_04: are. He's a role model. I mean, a genuine role model. I love him. Yeah, he and I used to be
[00:57:11] SPEAKER_02: all the time. This was so much allies have changed so drastically. I have to say both he and
[00:57:16] SPEAKER_04: you all Harari who were very tight with the tech bros have been courageous to push up against them,
[00:57:21] SPEAKER_04: which Sam has to his detriment, I would suspect. Sam is literally the personification of a
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_02: moral compass. He has these principles and he just never where we're sure him. I find he's the
[00:57:33] SPEAKER_02: least perverted adulterate money has had the least he's very successful. And the guys he's referencing
[00:57:40] SPEAKER_02: are a moral compass gone haywire. Yeah, and he's talking about everything that they love to do.
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_00: In the moment can be reverse engineered to what they believe will make them richer at that moment.
[00:57:49] SPEAKER_02: That's right. Yeah, I have to say we were we I was a really interesting discussion. Okay, that's
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_04: the show. Let me just say this is our last one before 2026 because we have taped two shows.
