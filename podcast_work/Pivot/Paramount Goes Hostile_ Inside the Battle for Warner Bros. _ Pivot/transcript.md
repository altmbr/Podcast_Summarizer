[00:00:00] Let me tell you, Hollywood, buckle the fuck up because this is the beginning of what is a massive change in how Hollywood is made and it has to happen.
[00:00:16] Hi everyone, this is Pivot from New York Magazine in the Vox Media Podcast Network. I'm Cara Swisher.
[00:00:21] Scott Galloway: And I'm Scott Galloway.
[00:00:22] Kara Swisher: Let's get just to news because there's so much going on in Scott.
[00:00:25] Scott Galloway: Paramount is launching a hostile bid to buy Warner Brothers Discovery after it lost out to Netflix.
[00:00:30] Scott Galloway: Paramount is going to Warner Brothers shareholders with then all cash $30 per share,
[00:00:34] Scott Galloway: offer value company at around $108 billion including debt.
[00:00:37] Scott Galloway: That would be for all of Warner Brothers studio streaming and cable networks including CNN.
[00:00:42] Scott Galloway: There's various valuations for the cable networks and CNN that are they they value to the dollar and others value it from three to five dollars.
[00:00:52] Scott Galloway: David Ellison is appeared on CNBC a little while ago with resting white lotus
[00:00:58] Scott Galloway: brofe saying we're really here to finish what we started.
[00:01:03] Scott Galloway: Let's listen to what he said about whether Trump is in his corner.
[00:01:06] Scott Galloway: What I would say is I'm incredibly grateful for the relations that I have with the president
[00:01:09] David Ellison: and I also believe he believes in competition.
[00:01:12] David Ellison: And when you fundamentally look at the marketplace,
[00:01:14] David Ellison: allowing the number one streaming service to combine with the number three streaming service
[00:01:19] David Ellison: is anti-competitive.
[00:01:21] David Ellison: Yeah, the person who's touting his relationship with Trump and has the Saudis and Jared Kushner
[00:01:26] Scott Galloway: and his deal is worried about unfairness.
[00:01:29] Scott Galloway: Meanwhile, before Paramount moved down Trump said Netflix acquisition of Warner Brothers could be a problem.
[00:01:34] Scott Galloway: It's a normal thing to say.
[00:01:36] Scott Galloway: He didn't say anything wrong there given the combined market share.
[00:01:39] Scott Galloway: But not to worry, he plans to be quote, involved in decision.
[00:01:42] Scott Galloway: I know, right?
[00:01:44] Scott Galloway: Like they never presents it ever.
[00:01:46] Scott Galloway: It's not supposed to.
[00:01:47] Scott Galloway: That's all point.
[00:01:47] Scott Galloway: You're not supposed to be involved.
[00:01:49] Scott Galloway: That's right.
[00:01:50] Scott Galloway: Trump also confirmed, of course he is.
[00:01:52] Scott Galloway: Confirmed he can't stay out of this one.
[00:01:53] Scott Galloway: Come on.
[00:01:54] Scott Galloway: Recently, he met with Netflix CEO Ted Cerandos, the White House calling Ted fantastic.
[00:01:59] Scott Galloway: Cerandos said last week he was confident that the deal would be approved because it's a pro-consumer
[00:02:02] Scott Galloway: and pro-innovation.
[00:02:04] Scott Galloway: But politicians on both sides are expressing concern.
[00:02:06] Scott Galloway: Senator Elizabeth Warren called it anti-monopoly nightmare.
[00:02:09] Scott Galloway: We haven't seen what she says about the Ellison did yet.
[00:02:12] Scott Galloway: I'm sure she's just as mad as that about that one.
[00:02:15] Scott Galloway: Hollywood is also up in arms with many warning the deal could negatively impact jobs.
[00:02:19] Scott Galloway: And movie production.
[00:02:20] Scott Galloway: Oh, where do we start?
[00:02:22] Scott Galloway: Let's start with the hostile takeover.
[00:02:23] Scott Galloway: I guess that's some recent news.
[00:02:25] Scott Galloway: Paramount spit is backed, as I said, by Redbird.
[00:02:28] Scott Galloway: That's Jerry Cardinoli, three Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds as well as affinity partners,
[00:02:33] Scott Galloway: which is Jared Kushner's private equity firms.
[00:02:35] Scott Galloway: Nothing to see here, folks.
[00:02:36] Scott Galloway: There's a lot to see here.
[00:02:38] Scott Galloway: The Saudis and Jared Kushner.
[00:02:39] Scott Galloway: That's a nice toxic cocktail of crap.
[00:02:43] Scott Galloway: You know, whether he's going to
[00:02:46] Scott Galloway: weigh in here, of course he is.
[00:02:48] Scott Galloway: There's also a 5.8 billion dollar break-up fee that Netflix will pay if the deal falls apart.
[00:02:54] Scott Galloway: I don't know if they have to pay if they pick another.
[00:02:57] Scott Galloway: I was thinking about that too.
[00:02:58] Scott Galloway: I don't think so.
[00:02:59] Kara Swisher: I think it's, of course not.
[00:03:00] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:03:00] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:03:01] Kara Swisher: So why don't you start?
[00:03:03] Scott Galloway: I've got lots of things to say, but why don't you go for us?
[00:03:05] Scott Galloway: Yeah.
[00:03:06] Scott Galloway: Well, look, it's going to sound strange, but what David Ellison said there,
[00:03:10] Kara Swisher: I actually think it's right.
[00:03:12] Kara Swisher: I don't particularly want the family that's going to potentially control TikTok and is trying to
[00:03:18] Kara Swisher: is engaging at open cronism by saying we can get this approved because my
[00:03:23] Kara Swisher: daddy.
[00:03:24] Scott Galloway: My dad has his finger up the ass of the president.
[00:03:27] Kara Swisher: I just don't.
[00:03:28] That's wrong, but what he's saying on a macro level is I think correct.
[00:03:33] Kara Swisher: Let me walk you through my emotional rollercoaster.
[00:03:35] Kara Swisher: I thought, oh my god.
[00:03:38] Like, I was so dumb to count Ted Sarandas and Netflix out.
[00:03:41] Kara Swisher: I thought the pyramid was going to walk away with it.
[00:03:44] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:03:45] Kara Swisher: And Ted Sarandas.
[00:03:45] Kara Swisher: Do you want to say, care, I was right here?
[00:03:47] Scott Galloway: No, go ahead.
[00:03:48] Did you think that was to do?
[00:03:49] Kara Swisher: I did not think Paramount was going to get it.
[00:03:51] Scott Galloway: I thought it was.
[00:03:52] Scott Galloway: Well, the fallity is not song here.
[00:03:54] Kara Swisher: So anyway, so I mean the first round, but go ahead.
[00:03:57] Scott Galloway: So, but you know, you never want to underestimate Ted Sarandas and ends up to Ted very
[00:04:04] Kara Swisher: definitely flew to Washington and had an hour sit down with the president and Ted,
[00:04:09] Kara Swisher: if anything, is incredibly likeable.
[00:04:13] And he doesn't come across as political.
[00:04:14] Kara Swisher: He comes across as super smart.
[00:04:16] Kara Swisher: You just like the guy.
[00:04:18] And he's also probably one of the most, I don't even say underrated,
[00:04:20] Kara Swisher: but one of the most seminal figures in technology and media in the last 20 years.
[00:04:24] Kara Swisher: What they've done there is just nothing.
[00:04:25] Kara Swisher: Shout out to Mark.
[00:04:26] Kara Swisher: Sort of with him and hate things.
[00:04:27] Scott Galloway: Let's give him credit to.
[00:04:28] Scott Galloway: Well, Reed, I would say Reed is like the visionary,
[00:04:32] Kara Swisher: but Ted and his other co-ceo have been probably the best operators in media.
[00:04:36] Kara Swisher: They just, they're just very good.
[00:04:38] Kara Swisher: And so he pops up and all of a sudden,
[00:04:41] Kara Swisher: he see pictures and I'm like, oh my god, that's life fox.
[00:04:43] Kara Swisher: Just snuck into the snuck into the hen house when no one was looking.
[00:04:47] Kara Swisher: And then Ellison goes hostile.
[00:04:49] Kara Swisher: And actually, I think other than the president saying is going to be very involved
[00:04:53] Kara Swisher: in taking meetings, I think the president's sort of saying the president said
[00:04:57] Kara Swisher: one thing that is absolutely true and correct.
[00:04:59] Kara Swisher: And I hope he sticks to it.
[00:05:00] Kara Swisher: And that is whoever has the highest bid wins.
[00:05:03] Kara Swisher: And that's how it should be.
[00:05:04] Kara Swisher: Whoever shows up with the biggest check should get this.
[00:05:07] Kara Swisher: And if they don't, they should file a lawsuit under the Revlon loss.
[00:05:12] Kara Swisher: But I personally think we talk a lot about affordability.
[00:05:16] The, I mean, there's a few things around affordability,
[00:05:19] Kara Swisher: whether it's lower education, lower healthcare costs,
[00:05:21] Kara Swisher: but also a key component to affordability.
[00:05:23] Kara Swisher: We don't like to talk about it because it's boring.
[00:05:25] Kara Swisher: It's competition.
[00:05:27] And if you let Netflix and HBO combine,
[00:05:32] Kara Swisher: you're basically taking Walmart and putting LVMH on top of it.
[00:05:36] Kara Swisher: And you have 300 million at Netflix, 130 million at HBO.
[00:05:40] Kara Swisher: Now there's some cross over there.
[00:05:42] Kara Swisher: But I think basically the streaming wars,
[00:05:45] Kara Swisher: some people would argue, well, no, it's about YouTube.
[00:05:47] Kara Swisher: But how we traditionally think about streaming,
[00:05:51] Kara Swisher: that war is over if HBO and Netflix are allowed to merge.
[00:05:56] Kara Swisher: So I don't like this.
[00:05:57] Kara Swisher: I'd like to see it go to Comcast or it to be blocked with Netflix.
[00:06:01] Kara Swisher: I actually think parent, I mean,
[00:06:03] Kara Swisher: this is just an antitrust nightmare.
[00:06:05] Kara Swisher: Who will not matter?
[00:06:07] Kara Swisher: And then I'll turn it back to you.
[00:06:08] Kara Swisher: Whatever the fuck, Saga, Avtra or Brian Cranston
[00:06:11] Kara Swisher: or name your star that's going to start virtue signaling
[00:06:14] Kara Swisher: after they get 40 million a year for their shit.
[00:06:17] Kara Swisher: No one cares what they think.
[00:06:19] Kara Swisher: I mean, we'll nod.
[00:06:20] Kara Swisher: But they would call the region if ISIS started a streaming network
[00:06:25] Kara Swisher: if, as Ricky Gervais said.
[00:06:28] Kara Swisher: So they will be a total non-factor here.
[00:06:31] Kara Swisher: I'd like to think it's just going to go to the highest bidder.
[00:06:34] Kara Swisher: I'd also like to think that the economists of the DOJ and the FGC
[00:06:38] Kara Swisher: all right, is Netflix going to be able to
[00:06:42] extract unfair pricing from consumers and,
[00:06:46] Kara Swisher: and if they're the only game in town,
[00:06:49] Kara Swisher: back end revenues are already off the table.
[00:06:51] Kara Swisher: There's no more sign fell deals anymore.
[00:06:53] Kara Swisher: Well, that's what they were doing before.
[00:06:55] Scott Galloway: This is what Holly was mad about.
[00:06:58] Scott Galloway: You go finish it and then I have a lot to say about this.
[00:07:00] Scott Galloway: Well, okay.
[00:07:01] Kara Swisher: My point is when you have consolidation and concentration of power,
[00:07:04] Kara Swisher: it benefits the shareholders of those,
[00:07:06] Kara Swisher: the winners of that concentration.
[00:07:09] Kara Swisher: But A, it reduces, it creates a lack of leverage for the consumer,
[00:07:13] Kara Swisher: surprises go up and B, it leaks strength and leverage and compensation from labor to shareholders.
[00:07:20] Kara Swisher: So to a certain extent, I would like to see anyone but Comcast or potentially,
[00:07:25] Kara Swisher: unfortunately Paramount, because they're sub-scale.
[00:07:27] Kara Swisher: I'd like to see the deal blocked.
[00:07:28] Kara Swisher: And I love Ted Sranos and I love Netflix.
[00:07:31] Okay. Here's what I think.
[00:07:32] Scott Galloway: First of all, it's a bigger market.
[00:07:33] Scott Galloway: Like, look what the two cases, the core cases.
[00:07:35] Scott Galloway: I'm going to start with that that just got lost by the Department of Justice.
[00:07:38] Scott Galloway: Was there's plenty of competition for Facebook and Meta.
[00:07:42] Scott Galloway: And there's plenty of competition for Google, right?
[00:07:47] Scott Galloway: They've lost those because the whole landscape has changed.
[00:07:50] Scott Galloway: You sort of pushed off YouTube.
[00:07:52] Scott Galloway: YouTube is where everybody streams.
[00:07:54] Scott Galloway: I'm sorry, look at the statistic.
[00:07:55] Scott Galloway: If you look at any of the watching data, YouTube is far and away the most important way,
[00:08:01] Scott Galloway: especially young people get their news and information.
[00:08:03] Scott Galloway: So you're leaving out the fact that YouTube is enormous here and is the actual competitor.
[00:08:08] Scott Galloway: Secondly, there's tons of different, you can't like say streaming is its own thing anymore.
[00:08:13] Scott Galloway: Everything is a TikTok is part of that.
[00:08:16] Scott Galloway: So is Instagram.
[00:08:17] Scott Galloway: So the market is so dissipated that nobody gets a thing.
[00:08:22] Scott Galloway: Like, nobody gets control of anything.
[00:08:25] Scott Galloway: There's plenty of competition.
[00:08:27] Scott Galloway: And I think Netflix has a very good case to be made that there's lots of competition.
[00:08:30] Scott Galloway: That's one.
[00:08:31] Scott Galloway: Two, I don't know.
[00:08:33] Scott Galloway: I just got over the weekend.
[00:08:35] Scott Galloway: Some Trump people contacted me and they were like, what do you think?
[00:08:39] Scott Galloway: And I said, I think, you know, backing the winners, what he'll do.
[00:08:44] Scott Galloway: And so you noticed him saying Ted was fantastic.
[00:08:46] Scott Galloway: And he wasn't pro-elison necessarily, right?
[00:08:49] Scott Galloway: He just said competition, which is the right thing to say.
[00:08:52] Scott Galloway: And so, you know, Trump's very interested in Netflix.
[00:08:55] Scott Galloway: He thinks they're winners.
[00:08:56] Scott Galloway: And let me just tell you, Hollywood, I'm so sorry to tell you,
[00:08:59] Scott Galloway: but they have one because many years ago,
[00:09:02] Scott Galloway: 15 years ago, Jeff Beacus called them the Albanian army.
[00:09:04] Scott Galloway: Do you remember that?
[00:09:05] Scott Galloway: Like, who are they?
[00:09:07] Scott Galloway: Hollywood has persisted in backing shitty economics.
[00:09:12] Scott Galloway: Like, really shitty economics for themselves.
[00:09:14] Scott Galloway: They overpay themselves.
[00:09:15] Scott Galloway: They over just everything they do is all about
[00:09:20] Scott Galloway: their feathering their own nests.
[00:09:22] Scott Galloway: And we talk about that with David Zazloff and others.
[00:09:24] Scott Galloway: It's never about figuring out what's next.
[00:09:26] Scott Galloway: Instead, they blame Netflix for inevitable changes
[00:09:30] Scott Galloway: that consumers like.
[00:09:31] Scott Galloway: So the problem wasn't Netflix.
[00:09:33] Scott Galloway: The problem is Hollywood didn't modernize itself fast enough
[00:09:36] Scott Galloway: and stayed in the same old economics, the same old bat,
[00:09:41] you know, padding of the backs, et cetera.
[00:09:44] Scott Galloway: So it just is like, I don't know if,
[00:09:47] Scott Galloway: I think there's much more competition for them than you think.
[00:09:50] Scott Galloway: Secondly, they've changed the game they have,
[00:09:52] Scott Galloway: but Hollywood certainly had every opportunity
[00:09:54] Scott Galloway: to do so and were warned so.
[00:09:56] Scott Galloway: I put up, I'm going to finish my rant in a second,
[00:09:58] Scott Galloway: but I put up an interview I did with Reed Hastings, Jason Kailar,
[00:10:04] Scott Galloway: Reed Hastings, Rand Netflix, Jason Kailar,
[00:10:06] Scott Galloway: and Chad Hurley that I did at Sundance in 2009.
[00:10:09] Scott Galloway: And I was like, these three companies
[00:10:11] Scott Galloway: are going to change everything.
[00:10:12] Scott Galloway: They put us in a basement, Scott, and yelled at us
[00:10:15] Scott Galloway: for saying it was obvious.
[00:10:17] Scott Galloway: This is going to be a streaming environment.
[00:10:18] Scott Galloway: This is going to, all the economics are wrong.
[00:10:21] Scott Galloway: The way you people pay yourselves.
[00:10:23] Scott Galloway: They stuck us in a basement.
[00:10:24] Scott Galloway: And we were like, fine, these are the companies
[00:10:26] Scott Galloway: that are going to take over everything.
[00:10:28] Scott Galloway: So to me, as Hollywood's own fucking fault
[00:10:30] Scott Galloway: for their ridiculous salaries, the way the economics are so,
[00:10:34] Scott Galloway: they're like, it would make, you know,
[00:10:36] Scott Galloway: it would make a third, you know,
[00:10:39] Scott Galloway: an Eastern block country blush in terms of the corruption,
[00:10:42] Scott Galloway: I think, that goes on there.
[00:10:44] Scott Galloway: That said, I like a lot, I think,
[00:10:46] Scott Galloway: but I also think there's lots of different
[00:10:48] Scott Galloway: entertainment happening, like in podcasts and everywhere else.
[00:10:51] Scott Galloway: So there's lots of choices.
[00:10:53] Scott Galloway: The thing about the Paramount bit is,
[00:10:55] Scott Galloway: this is a group of people who's, it's sub small.
[00:10:59] Scott Galloway: It's too small, by the way.
[00:11:00] Scott Galloway: And they have an existential crisis.
[00:11:02] Scott Galloway: It's like a rich kid buying a yacht.
[00:11:05] Scott Galloway: This is a yacht for this kid.
[00:11:07] Scott Galloway: And you would, you would, you know,
[00:11:10] Scott Galloway: think about the track record here.
[00:11:12] Scott Galloway: It's good to know how to run a public entertainment company
[00:11:15] Scott Galloway: before buying a very important one.
[00:11:17] Scott Galloway: I think I'm sorry, David Ellsons, very nice guy,
[00:11:19] Scott Galloway: but he's completely inexperienced and over his skis,
[00:11:22] Scott Galloway: like most of Trump officials, like,
[00:11:25] Scott Galloway: like he has no business running this company.
[00:11:28] Scott Galloway: I'm sorry, he just doesn't.
[00:11:30] Scott Galloway: He got played, he gets in fights, stupid fights with people.
[00:11:34] Scott Galloway: It's just he's, the only qualification is he's friends with Trump
[00:11:38] Scott Galloway: and his daddy has money.
[00:11:40] And he makes bad decisions one after the next.
[00:11:43] Scott Galloway: So that's another thing.
[00:11:44] Scott Galloway: I mean, I don't really care if he wants to blow his fortune,
[00:11:48] Scott Galloway: all power to him.
[00:11:49] Scott Galloway: But he does, he's not the best owner of this.
[00:11:51] Scott Galloway: It's, it's a non-economic thing.
[00:11:53] Scott Galloway: Bringing in the Middle East and sovereign wealth funds.
[00:11:56] Scott Galloway: No, thank you.
[00:11:56] Scott Galloway: I don't think so.
[00:11:57] Scott Galloway: And Jared Kushner, double, no thank you.
[00:12:00] Scott Galloway: And the last thing I would say is that
[00:12:02] Scott Galloway: it contest is the bitter that should get this
[00:12:05] Scott Galloway: because that, you know, they really need to bulk up
[00:12:07] Scott Galloway: and they are really good operators.
[00:12:09] Scott Galloway: It would make perfect sense.
[00:12:12] Scott Galloway: And it would, it would be, you know,
[00:12:14] Scott Galloway: they could spend, a scene and should be spun off
[00:12:16] Scott Galloway: the way Versa was and then let's figure that part out.
[00:12:19] Scott Galloway: But what David Ellison was trying to do here
[00:12:22] Scott Galloway: was try to get this on the cheap and it didn't work.
[00:12:25] Scott Galloway: Right? That's what he was doing.
[00:12:27] Scott Galloway: And Netflix very definitely by someone
[00:12:30] Scott Galloway: who is an experienced operator, came in
[00:12:32] Scott Galloway: and did an N-run around him because
[00:12:34] Scott Galloway: I'm sorry, David, you're not very smart
[00:12:36] Scott Galloway: about any of this stuff.
[00:12:38] Scott Galloway: And you just, you know, the fact that you,
[00:12:41] Scott Galloway: him going on and on about unfairness is,
[00:12:43] Scott Galloway: I'm like, listen, Richie Rich.
[00:12:45] Scott Galloway: It's not happening, you know.
[00:12:47] Scott Galloway: Call Cadbury the Butler and let him explain economics to you.
[00:12:50] Scott Galloway: So I just don't, I don't, I don't see,
[00:12:53] Scott Galloway: I think Netflix has plenty to push back
[00:12:54] Scott Galloway: and I don't think they would have moved forward
[00:12:56] Scott Galloway: if they didn't think they had either a legal chance,
[00:12:59] Scott Galloway: which I think they absolutely do,
[00:13:01] Scott Galloway: or an in with Trump, which from what I can understand
[00:13:04] Scott Galloway: from the Trump people, there's a lot against this.
[00:13:07] Scott Galloway: But there's a lot of people who see that Trump needs
[00:13:09] Scott Galloway: to be a little bit for this too.
[00:13:12] Scott Galloway: So it's not a done deal in that regard.
[00:13:14] Scott Galloway: But they, of course, we're going to do this,
[00:13:16] Scott Galloway: no matter how you slice it,
[00:13:17] Scott Galloway: they were going to try to make it into something.
[00:13:19] Scott Galloway: So that's my rant.
[00:13:21] Scott Galloway: Thank you.
[00:13:22] So I, a lot there.
[00:13:24] Kara Swisher: So let's start with, it doesn't matter whether David Ellison
[00:13:26] Kara Swisher: would be a good owner or a bad owner.
[00:13:28] Kara Swisher: We don't get to decide that.
[00:13:29] Kara Swisher: And that's socialism with all of a sudden,
[00:13:30] Kara Swisher: we start making value judgments on who should own something
[00:13:33] Kara Swisher: or who should not.
[00:13:33] Kara Swisher: I just say he's an experienced, he'll do a terrible job.
[00:13:35] Scott Galloway: But go ahead.
[00:13:36] Scott Galloway: Well, in 18T is allowed to buy time order
[00:13:39] Kara Swisher: and realize it was a stupid idea and sell it.
[00:13:40] Kara Swisher: Oh, great.
[00:13:41] Kara Swisher: I didn't say he couldn't.
[00:13:42] Kara Swisher: I'm just telling you, he would be,
[00:13:44] Scott Galloway: Hollywood will be sorry if it gets him.
[00:13:47] So well, okay.
[00:13:50] Kara Swisher: So I am sympathetic to one argument and not to the other.
[00:13:53] Kara Swisher: The argument that you're making is around market definition.
[00:13:57] Kara Swisher: And what you're saying is, is the way we would define the market
[00:13:59] Kara Swisher: in front of a, if it goes to the Supreme Court,
[00:14:02] Kara Swisher: is that no, it's not the market for streaming.
[00:14:04] Kara Swisher: It's the market for eyeballs and all entertainment and all video.
[00:14:08] I think that's a really good argument.
[00:14:09] Kara Swisher: I personally think that you do what,
[00:14:12] Kara Swisher: I think it's its own category.
[00:14:14] Kara Swisher: I do think that premium streaming where you acquire subscribers
[00:14:18] Kara Swisher: and they pay a monthly subscription fee,
[00:14:20] Kara Swisher: I do think that qualifies as its own market.
[00:14:23] Kara Swisher: And I get the argument and I'm sympathetic to it
[00:14:25] Kara Swisher: that YouTube is the biggest streamer.
[00:14:28] Kara Swisher: I get it.
[00:14:28] Kara Swisher: I've even said that before.
[00:14:30] But saying that, that to a certain extent,
[00:14:34] Kara Swisher: comparing HBO and Netflix to YouTube is a little bit like saying,
[00:14:38] Kara Swisher: well, there are three companies that control all of poultry right now
[00:14:42] Kara Swisher: and prices continue to rise faster than inflation.
[00:14:44] Kara Swisher: So we should break up big chicken, which I think we should do.
[00:14:47] Kara Swisher: And then the chicken people would say,
[00:14:48] Kara Swisher: we're not competing against each other.
[00:14:50] Kara Swisher: We're competing against beef, poultry, kale, granola.
[00:14:55] Kara Swisher: So I do think this, I do think streaming is its own definitive market.
[00:14:59] Kara Swisher: And I think the evidence of that, Cara,
[00:15:01] Kara Swisher: is that as the market has begun to consolidate a few years ago,
[00:15:05] Kara Swisher: pricing has gone way up.
[00:15:06] Kara Swisher: Price, opinion streaming is accelerating.
[00:15:10] Kara Swisher: So I don't look at this as,
[00:15:14] by far the best operator in the nicest guy
[00:15:16] Kara Swisher: and the best American in my view of all of this is Ted Strandos.
[00:15:20] Kara Swisher: I don't think that's how you decide this.
[00:15:21] Kara Swisher: I think you decide who the highest bidder is.
[00:15:23] Kara Swisher: And then the FDC and the DOJ economist go,
[00:15:26] Kara Swisher: will this extract substantial leverage in capital from labor and consumers
[00:15:32] Kara Swisher: to the shareholders of the oligopoly here.
[00:15:35] Kara Swisher: And I believe that there's a very solid case.
[00:15:37] Kara Swisher: As much as I don't, I'm not fond of the elephants
[00:15:40] Kara Swisher: that it would be good to have a bulked up paramount,
[00:15:43] Kara Swisher: a bulked up comcast in a might present a leakage of power
[00:15:48] Kara Swisher: and leverage in capital from labor and consumers to shareholders
[00:15:52] Kara Swisher: if you let the Netflix, Warner Brothers deal go through.
[00:15:55] Kara Swisher: See, I think you cannot leave YouTube out of this.
[00:15:59] Scott Galloway: You just can't.
[00:16:00] Scott Galloway: And I think that's there.
[00:16:02] Scott Galloway: I think that's the race and the whole is showing the,
[00:16:03] Scott Galloway: the, the, the, the, the, no, like, I'm sure you're watching on YouTube.
[00:16:06] Kara Swisher: I'm just telling you usage time.
[00:16:09] Scott Galloway: I get that.
[00:16:09] Scott Galloway: But I think streaming is, is part of the, look,
[00:16:13] Scott Galloway: every decision that's recently been made by judges on this stuff
[00:16:16] Scott Galloway: talks about a broader landscape.
[00:16:17] Scott Galloway: That's why Facebook got out of its jam.
[00:16:20] Scott Galloway: And that's why do you think those are the right decisions?
[00:16:22] Kara Swisher: Yeah, I do actually.
[00:16:23] Scott Galloway: Yeah.
[00:16:24] Scott Galloway: So you don't think Facebook is a monopoly.
[00:16:25] Kara Swisher: You don't think Facebook should have this in an Instagram.
[00:16:27] Kara Swisher: I think they were.
[00:16:28] Scott Galloway: And I think they leveraged it.
[00:16:29] Scott Galloway: But no, I don't.
[00:16:30] Scott Galloway: I don't.
[00:16:30] Scott Galloway: I don't.
[00:16:31] Scott Galloway: I've said that over and over again.
[00:16:32] Scott Galloway: I think they are abusive of the power they have.
[00:16:35] Scott Galloway: But I don't, I think there's, they have plenty of competition.
[00:16:39] Scott Galloway: I think TikTok is an entertainment platform.
[00:16:41] Scott Galloway: And I think it takes up people's, however you extract money from people,
[00:16:44] Scott Galloway: whether it's through advertising or subscription,
[00:16:46] Scott Galloway: it's the same difference to me.
[00:16:48] Scott Galloway: And so I think that they, what's interesting is where Disney is on this.
[00:16:53] Scott Galloway: You know, and you know, I suspect they're sitting on the sidelines going
[00:16:56] Scott Galloway: over for Fox a, I actually know this.
[00:16:59] Scott Galloway: That they, where did they go?
[00:17:01] Scott Galloway: Like, it seems to me you're going to see a lot.
[00:17:04] Scott Galloway: Look, look, if Netflix does get Warner, Paramount's got to do a deal with someone,
[00:17:09] Scott Galloway: whatever, unless they just want to spend dad's money,
[00:17:11] Scott Galloway: which he certainly can do, but they're too small, right?
[00:17:14] Scott Galloway: And this was something many years ago.
[00:17:15] Scott Galloway: I said, I was like, I can't believe I'm saying this,
[00:17:17] Scott Galloway: but Disney's too small.
[00:17:19] Scott Galloway: And so where does Disney go?
[00:17:21] Scott Galloway: To me is really interesting.
[00:17:23] Scott Galloway: This is what's going to happen for the next couple of years,
[00:17:25] Scott Galloway: these consolidations, whether you like it or not.
[00:17:28] Scott Galloway: And look, I really think they're,
[00:17:31] Scott Galloway: this bringing in the Qataris and the Saudis and Jared Kushner says,
[00:17:35] Scott Galloway: tells me everything I need to know here.
[00:17:37] Scott Galloway: Like kind of thing.
[00:17:38] Scott Galloway: It's really quite grotesque.
[00:17:39] Scott Galloway: I don't think the Saudis should be owning any of our news organizations.
[00:17:43] Scott Galloway: I'm sorry, they shouldn't.
[00:17:44] Scott Galloway: And neither should the French neither should, you know,
[00:17:48] Scott Galloway: Saudis more than the French, but in any case,
[00:17:51] Scott Galloway: it just doesn't create, you know, talk about global news.
[00:17:54] Scott Galloway: Like, why aren't we discussing what's going to happen to CNN with its merge with C.
[00:17:58] Scott Galloway: Why isn't that as important as the streaming market?
[00:18:01] Scott Galloway: And so I just feel like it's none of these choices are great,
[00:18:04] Scott Galloway: but they're, it's inevitable that consolidation is going to happen,
[00:18:08] Scott Galloway: whether Hollywood likes it or not.
[00:18:09] Scott Galloway: I don't mean to be hostile, Hollywood,
[00:18:11] Scott Galloway: but they sat on their fucking hands.
[00:18:13] Scott Galloway: Well, this, this is not a new, fresh thing.
[00:18:15] Scott Galloway: And what would you, I can't believe I'm defending Hollywood,
[00:18:18] Kara Swisher: but what would, what would you have had Hollywood do,
[00:18:21] Kara Swisher: quote unquote?
[00:18:22] Kara Swisher: I assume you mean the creative community.
[00:18:23] Kara Swisher: The creative community has watched this slow moving,
[00:18:26] Scott Galloway: like growth of net, first of all, they disdained it.
[00:18:29] Scott Galloway: Try, try to be covering it at the time.
[00:18:31] Scott Galloway: I was at, I had death threats from like the writers of the unbuck square fence.
[00:18:37] Kara Swisher: Well, you had the same thing.
[00:18:38] Scott Galloway: It's like, you know, with the writers, we need 19 people in the,
[00:18:42] Scott Galloway: like even as I do stuff today for CNN and another thing,
[00:18:45] Scott Galloway: I'm always like, what are you here for?
[00:18:47] Scott Galloway: What are all these people doing here?
[00:18:48] Scott Galloway: What are all these people doing here?
[00:18:50] Scott Galloway: Every time I go on a show.
[00:18:51] Scott Galloway: Good, but today's show and do a six-minute segment,
[00:18:53] Kara Swisher: and there's 14 people in the world.
[00:18:54] Kara Swisher: Like, and I'm sorry, I, I agree,
[00:18:56] Scott Galloway: everyone should have jobs, but they have they really sat there and thought about.
[00:19:00] Scott Galloway: And the other thing is, this is where I go to ultimately is like,
[00:19:04] Scott Galloway: who's making the things that consumers like?
[00:19:06] Scott Galloway: Guess which grew?
[00:19:08] Scott Galloway: By the way, the kid, like one of the things I think that is affecting
[00:19:10] Scott Galloway: Trump here is his son and wife like Netflix, right?
[00:19:14] Scott Galloway: Like they use it.
[00:19:15] Scott Galloway: What do consumers like?
[00:19:16] Scott Galloway: What has been better for consumers?
[00:19:19] Scott Galloway: Probably Netflix, right?
[00:19:21] Scott Galloway: Like what precisely?
[00:19:22] Scott Galloway: I just, I just mean, it's just a time that this is,
[00:19:25] Scott Galloway: I'm so sorry to tell you, but you had a chance to change yourself two decades ago
[00:19:30] Scott Galloway: when this started to happen.
[00:19:31] Scott Galloway: Instead of insulting Netflix, maybe you could have copied it.
[00:19:34] Scott Galloway: Maybe you could have done more mergers or more technology stuff.
[00:19:37] Scott Galloway: Maybe you should have said, maybe our economics are insane.
[00:19:42] Scott Galloway: Like, why are we paying, I'm sorry to say,
[00:19:44] Scott Galloway: I have a lot of friends who are anchors and get these millions of dollars to these anchors.
[00:19:48] Scott Galloway: And this isn't, when the audience was declining.
[00:19:50] Scott Galloway: Like to me, it's not their own fault, but it really is from an economic point.
[00:19:54] Scott Galloway: And then why do you let David Zazzle have these massive salaries?
[00:19:57] Scott Galloway: Like, why does this go on?
[00:19:59] Scott Galloway: Like essentially?
[00:20:00] Scott Galloway: Yeah, it's fair all those things.
[00:20:01] Kara Swisher: You know, and the other, it looks like, I'm happy to have tech people actually get in here a little bit
[00:20:07] Scott Galloway: in some ways, but one of the things that drive, I'll tell you, it drives me crazy about
[00:20:11] Scott Galloway: the cellosum bit is, I was at that meeting where they were, where they introduced it.
[00:20:16] Scott Galloway: And they kept saying, we're going to take tech and change things.
[00:20:19] Scott Galloway: And I was like, aha, specifically.
[00:20:20] Scott Galloway: And they're like, tech, change things.
[00:20:22] Scott Galloway: AI, I was like, aha, right.
[00:20:25] Scott Galloway: How?
[00:20:25] Scott Galloway: Right.
[00:20:26] Scott Galloway: And so I would like some, if they put out a very clear, this is our plan.
[00:20:30] Scott Galloway: We're very transparent.
[00:20:31] Scott Galloway: All of them.
[00:20:33] Scott Galloway: I'd like to see it, like what their plans are.
[00:20:35] Scott Galloway: Still, I think Comcast should have it all.
[00:20:37] Scott Galloway: That's my feeling, because I think they're, I think they have the right things.
[00:20:41] Scott Galloway: And you spin off CNN.
[00:20:43] Scott Galloway: Maybe they merge with Versaunt.
[00:20:44] Scott Galloway: But they, let me just tell you, the news organizations
[00:20:46] Scott Galloway: to get as much consideration here as very
[00:20:50] Scott Galloway: Ellison and the Saudi should not control CNN, CBS and TikTok.
[00:20:54] Scott Galloway: Sorry, that's just as bad as the string, it's worse than the streaming business.
[00:20:58] Scott Galloway: So anyway, that's where I am on this.
[00:21:00] Scott Galloway: The, so it's, it's, it's interesting.
[00:21:04] Kara Swisher: It's usually you and I are in different positions.
[00:21:07] Kara Swisher: I mean, I usually am on your position as kind of the capitalist argument.
[00:21:11] And I would argue I'm taking kind of the antitrust or the, the labor slash.
[00:21:16] Kara Swisher: Consumer argument here.
[00:21:18] Kara Swisher: But I think at the end of the day, the decision should be
[00:21:20] Kara Swisher: based on an analysis of what has happened in terms of pricing power.
[00:21:24] Kara Swisher: And typically, actually the courts, while they've made decisions around
[00:21:28] Kara Swisher: alphabet and meta, basically letting them go ahead or, or, or,
[00:21:32] Kara Swisher: are having the feckless remedies in terms of after they find them guilty,
[00:21:35] Kara Swisher: monopoly power and saying, okay, here, you have to pay $10.
[00:21:39] Kara Swisher: The, the primary typically court cases lose in antitrust when they go from four to three.
[00:21:45] Kara Swisher: And that's what's going to happen here.
[00:21:46] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:21:47] Kara Swisher: They don't like the consolidation going to this level.
[00:21:49] Kara Swisher: Also, I think at the end of the day, the ultimate litmus test
[00:21:52] Kara Swisher: for whether the concentration has gone overboard here is in pricing.
[00:21:57] And in the last, in the last year, you've seen on average, among the big five, I guess, streamers,
[00:22:04] their prices, they've raised their prices 12.6%, which is vastly outpacing inflation.
[00:22:10] Kara Swisher: So what I would like to see is good economists say, what is going to happen here
[00:22:14] Kara Swisher: over the next five or 10 years with three players instead of saying, no, we don't want
[00:22:19] Kara Swisher: just three players in this market. Your, your argument will be the big one.
[00:22:24] Kara Swisher: And that is what defines this market and who is included in that.
[00:22:28] Kara Swisher: But I do think there's a pretty big distinction
[00:22:31] Kara Swisher: psychologically in terms of consumption, in terms of business model and revenue,
[00:22:36] Kara Swisher: and why people go to each of these platforms between.
[00:22:39] Kara Swisher: I get that everyone's competing for eyeballs at some point.
[00:22:41] Kara Swisher: I get that.
[00:22:42] Kara Swisher: But I do think these are different markets.
[00:22:45] Yeah, I don't. I don't. I just, I watch people as they're shifting and the time spent,
[00:22:49] Scott Galloway: that's to me, it is. By the way, these, these markets have to consolidate.
[00:22:53] Scott Galloway: I'm sorry to say they're too many costs and they have to consolidate.
[00:22:57] Scott Galloway: It's not something, it's going to consolidate.
[00:23:01] Scott Galloway: It doesn't really matter. And one of the things that's interesting is the Trump
[00:23:04] Scott Galloway: administration through its lawyer, Macindale Rahim, who now works for Paramount.
[00:23:08] Scott Galloway: This is one of his moves. It feels making all over the place here.
[00:23:12] Scott Galloway: Is was to say AT&T couldn't buy a Warner, right?
[00:23:16] Scott Galloway: Which set off this whole thing, by the way, which is kind of thing about it.
[00:23:20] Scott Galloway: So they lost and all the things that they said were going to happen, never happened.
[00:23:25] Scott Galloway: Like all these. Well, they were trying to bulk up against the digital guys.
[00:23:27] Kara Swisher: That's right. That, that, that, I mean, I, I was on record as saying,
[00:23:30] Kara Swisher: it's ridiculous to get in the way of that. Can I just go through the pricing here?
[00:23:33] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:23:34] Kara Swisher: So let's look at the big five Apple TV HBO Hulu Disney.
[00:23:39] Kara Swisher: And I'm going to do 2019 prices versus 2025 six years, right?
[00:23:44] Kara Swisher: In 2019 Netflix was $12.99. Now it's $18.
[00:23:48] Kara Swisher: Disney, add free in 2019 when it launches seven bucks.
[00:23:52] Kara Swisher: Now it's 19. Hulu with ads has gone from six bucks to 10 bucks.
[00:23:57] Kara Swisher: HBO Max, standard ad free has gone from 15 bucks to 1850.
[00:24:01] Kara Swisher: And Apple TV plus has gone from five bucks to 13 bucks.
[00:24:05] Kara Swisher: So it appears even with just five players who aren't bulked up.
[00:24:09] Kara Swisher: Their pricing power has been extraordinary.
[00:24:12] And again, I, I, I want to see economists go, okay, at some point,
[00:24:17] Kara Swisher: there's too much transfer of power from consumers and labor to shareholders
[00:24:22] Kara Swisher: in a concentrated oligopilot oligopolistic environment.
[00:24:27] Yes, except that these prices are going up because this costs too much, right?
[00:24:32] Scott Galloway: They're selling ice cream that costs a dollar for 50 cents, right?
[00:24:37] Scott Galloway: The price they had to get into just like, aren't you
[00:24:39] Scott Galloway: having the same with AI right now, the amount of money they're spending
[00:24:42] Scott Galloway: from their revenue streams.
[00:24:44] Scott Galloway: And eventually they're going to charge us more.
[00:24:47] Scott Galloway: That's obvious, but they are overs, they had to overspend.
[00:24:50] Scott Galloway: The reason Hollywood overspend so much is because they were,
[00:24:53] Scott Galloway: they waited so long to compete with Netflix.
[00:24:55] Scott Galloway: I kept going, you need to pay attention on Netflix.
[00:24:58] Scott Galloway: Yeah, hey, over here.
[00:24:59] Scott Galloway: And they didn't because they like their town cars and their flowers
[00:25:03] Scott Galloway: and their first-class tickets and their
[00:25:06] Scott Galloway: entourage and their staffs.
[00:25:08] Scott Galloway: Like, it was so exhausting to deal with Hollywood.
[00:25:11] Scott Galloway: And in some ways, tech was a relief to deal with not now, but they were for sure.
[00:25:17] Scott Galloway: And so I just feel like these prices, we're going to go up anyway.
[00:25:20] Scott Galloway: And there's still, even if there are five, they're going to go up
[00:25:22] Scott Galloway: until everything settles and what it costs and what they spend, right?
[00:25:26] Scott Galloway: And that's, and where people are going.
[00:25:28] Scott Galloway: And I think leaving, I think they're greatest argument here for Netflix,
[00:25:32] Scott Galloway: is YouTube and, and again, that's the argument.
[00:25:36] Scott Galloway: You need to watch what Apple and Amazon and Disney are going to do.
[00:25:42] Scott Galloway: Like what, you have to think of what's next.
[00:25:44] Scott Galloway: And there's going to be, you know, handing it over to Netbo,
[00:25:48] Scott Galloway: Mogul, fine, whatever if you want to do that.
[00:25:51] Scott Galloway: But next is going to be another one of these and another one.
[00:25:55] Scott Galloway: So we have to figure out what that means and then what we can extract
[00:25:58] Scott Galloway: from these companies like Netflix in order to help consumers.
[00:26:02] Scott Galloway: Right? What can we actually get?
[00:26:04] Scott Galloway: But I don't think the Trump administration is interested in any of that,
[00:26:07] Scott Galloway: like helping consumers whatsoever.
[00:26:08] Scott Galloway: I don't think they're interested.
[00:26:10] Scott Galloway: And honestly, all people to argue for antitrust,
[00:26:14] Scott Galloway: the elephants really aren't the ones to be doing it.
[00:26:16] Scott Galloway: It's sort of like, it's laughable on some level of fine.
[00:26:20] Scott Galloway: They can, they can do whatever they want to do.
[00:26:22] Scott Galloway: It's just, I don't think the Trump administration is even slightly
[00:26:25] Scott Galloway: interested in consumer pricing whatsoever.
[00:26:27] Scott Galloway: No, I think he's positioning it such that they both get so close to the finished line
[00:26:31] Kara Swisher: and get so hot and bothered that he says,
[00:26:32] Kara Swisher: I need whoever gives me a quarter of a billion dollars
[00:26:34] Kara Swisher: for the Trump presidential disco.
[00:26:37] Kara Swisher: Yeah, he gets this.
[00:26:38] Kara Swisher: I like that.
[00:26:39] Kara Swisher: I give it a nod to the DOJ or the FDC.
[00:26:41] Kara Swisher: Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:42] Scott Galloway: The whole thing is so fucked up because it's so corrupt.
[00:26:44] Scott Galloway: And Jared Kushner should not be in this.
[00:26:47] Scott Galloway: I mean, what a ridiculous.
[00:26:48] Scott Galloway: This guy can't keep his finger out of any fucking pie.
[00:26:51] Scott Galloway: It's really kind of like rotask in some ways.
[00:26:53] Scott Galloway: And of course, that makes this even,
[00:26:55] Scott Galloway: that's why I'm like, are you kidding me?
[00:26:57] Scott Galloway: You're adding the Saudis and Jared Kushner.
[00:26:59] Scott Galloway: Who have you not entered into?
[00:27:01] Scott Galloway: Like, you want to give some to see banan?
[00:27:02] Scott Galloway: Like, who do you want to, like, I'm just like,
[00:27:05] Scott Galloway: what loads some crony do you want to track?
[00:27:07] Scott Galloway: Well, it's just when you have, when you have an 85 billion dollar check,
[00:27:11] Kara Swisher: there are very few people domestic just that you need to bring in a lot of checkbooks
[00:27:16] Kara Swisher: without knowing why that checkbook.
[00:27:18] Scott Galloway: There's plenty of checker.
[00:27:19] Scott Galloway: They have a Apollo, that guy's smart.
[00:27:20] Scott Galloway: So I don't know.
[00:27:22] Scott Galloway: We'll see.
[00:27:22] Scott Galloway: It'll be a really interesting battle royale.
[00:27:24] Scott Galloway: And of course, I don't think they care about consumers.
[00:27:27] Scott Galloway: What do you think is going to end up happening here?
[00:27:33] Kara Swisher: Well, one of the things that I think someone told me,
[00:27:35] Scott Galloway: and I was that I think
[00:27:39] Scott Galloway: Cerandos has frozen his competition for a little while.
[00:27:42] Scott Galloway: Like, everybody's frozen now, which I think is brilliant.
[00:27:45] Scott Galloway: Right?
[00:27:46] Scott Galloway: He's ahead and he's, look, the stock is suffering, obviously.
[00:27:50] Scott Galloway: But I think he's frozen.
[00:27:52] Scott Galloway: I'm always on, I always am like, what did Netflix do?
[00:27:56] Scott Galloway: And then it turns out to be the smart thing.
[00:27:58] Scott Galloway: I like their ballsiness.
[00:28:00] Scott Galloway: I like they take risks when they did the discs to streaming.
[00:28:02] Scott Galloway: Boy, was that a fucking existential moment?
[00:28:05] Scott Galloway: And then they said, no advertising.
[00:28:07] Scott Galloway: Okay, we're going to do advertising.
[00:28:08] Scott Galloway: We're not really going to do deals, which was a fucking head fake.
[00:28:11] Scott Galloway: A fantastic head fake.
[00:28:12] Scott Galloway: Oh, we're doing the job.
[00:28:13] Scott Galloway: I think they believed it at the time.
[00:28:14] Kara Swisher: No, I don't know.
[00:28:15] Kara Swisher: It was a, it's been reported.
[00:28:16] Scott Galloway: It was a head fake.
[00:28:17] Scott Galloway: They were.
[00:28:18] Scott Galloway: No, no, I mean, I mean over the last 10 years,
[00:28:19] Kara Swisher: they have not been a quisitive.
[00:28:21] Kara Swisher: No, they have.
[00:28:22] Kara Swisher: They build a build versus buy.
[00:28:23] Kara Swisher: But the reason it's not only the head fake.
[00:28:24] Kara Swisher: But I think, I think he's frozen the situation in place beautifully.
[00:28:30] Scott Galloway: And we'll see where it goes.
[00:28:32] Scott Galloway: I think this is going to take forever.
[00:28:36] Scott Galloway: Like it's going to take a couple years.
[00:28:37] Scott Galloway: Yes.
[00:28:37] Scott Galloway: And so that's smart.
[00:28:39] Scott Galloway: In and of itself, that's smart.
[00:28:41] Scott Galloway: But let me tell you, Hollywood,
[00:28:43] Scott Galloway: buckle the fuck up because this is not the,
[00:28:45] Scott Galloway: this is the beginning of what is a massive change in how Hollywood is made.
[00:28:50] Scott Galloway: And, and it has to happen.
[00:28:52] Scott Galloway: I'm sorry.
[00:28:52] Scott Galloway: I know you're all going to now hate me.
[00:28:54] Scott Galloway: Like you hate Scott.
[00:28:54] Scott Galloway: But I'm sorry to tell you you had the chance to change it long time ago
[00:28:59] Scott Galloway: and didn't take that chance.
[00:29:00] Scott Galloway: And you know, they'll talk about creativity.
[00:29:02] Scott Galloway: And I agree with that.
[00:29:03] Scott Galloway: But I don't think creativity goes away.
[00:29:07] Scott Galloway: Just it's just this is what's going to happen
[00:29:09] Scott Galloway: because this is the industry that has not
[00:29:12] Scott Galloway: innovated nearly enough as a group of people.
[00:29:15] Scott Galloway: Anyway, I think actually press has
[00:29:17] Scott Galloway: innovated more than Hollywood has.
[00:29:19] Scott Galloway: I would say media certainly has.
[00:29:21] Scott Galloway: Anyway, not enough either.
[00:29:23] Scott Galloway: Anyway, let's go on a quick break.
[00:29:24] Scott Galloway: We come back.
[00:29:25] Scott Galloway: Elon calls for the EU to be polished.
[00:29:29] Support for the show comes from Framer.
[00:29:32] If you're in a business, you need a website.
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_03: Ensure you could pay for one of those cookie cutter site builders.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_03: But you'll end up with a website that looks like everyone else's.
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_03: If you want to go step further and get into true design,
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_03: you could dry Framer.
[00:29:43] SPEAKER_03: Framer already built the fastest way to publish
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_03: beautiful production ready websites.
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_03: And it's now redefining how we designed for the web.
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_03: With the recent launch of design pages, a free canvas-based design tool,
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_03: Framer is more than a site builder.
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_03: It's a true all-in-one design platform.
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_03: From social assets to campaign visuals to vectors and icons,
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_03: all the way to a live site, Framer is where ideas go live start to finish.
[00:30:08] Framer can even help you design more than websites,
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_03: create social assets, campaign visuals,
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_03: icons, and even site resources all in one place.
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_03: Ready to design, iterate, and publish all in one tool?
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_03: Start creating for free at framer.com slash design and use the code pivot
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_03: for a free month of Framer Pro.
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_03: That's framer.com slash design and use promo code pivot.
[00:30:31] SPEAKER_03: Framer.com slash design promo code pivot.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_03: Rules and restrictions may apply.
[00:30:39] Scott, we're back.
[00:30:40] These meadle some kids.
[00:30:42] Scott Galloway: Elon Musk is denying reports that SpaceX is holding a share sale
[00:30:46] Scott Galloway: that would value the company at $800 billion.
[00:30:48] Scott Galloway: He posted on X over the weekend that SpaceX has been
[00:30:50] Scott Galloway: cash-low positive for years and only runs twice
[00:30:52] Scott Galloway: really stocked by Vax to give employees and investor liquidity.
[00:30:55] Scott Galloway: But the LAS valuation might be a sign of what's ahead for the company's future.
[00:30:58] Scott Galloway: SpaceX has informed investors that plans to pursue an IPO
[00:31:02] Scott Galloway: in 2026 according to the information.
[00:31:06] I don't believe anything Elon says.
[00:31:07] Scott Galloway: So whatever, Elon's also spending his time because this is an important thing.
[00:31:12] Scott Galloway: Calling for the European Union to be abolished,
[00:31:14] Scott Galloway: this comes after the EU affine X $140 million
[00:31:17] Scott Galloway: for violating its Digital Services Act.
[00:31:20] Scott Galloway: Regularly just called the Blue Check Verification System
[00:31:22] Scott Galloway: to accept it and also criticize the lack of transparency in X's ads.
[00:31:26] Scott Galloway: Secretary of State Marco Rubio called this EU find an attack
[00:31:29] Scott Galloway: on all American tech platforms and foreign and American people
[00:31:33] Scott Galloway: by foreign governments sit down Marco,
[00:31:35] Scott Galloway: Little Marco.
[00:31:35] Scott Galloway: Are we about to see an USEU showdown?
[00:31:38] Scott Galloway: I think people in Europe are quite nervous, I suspect, thoughts?
[00:31:42] Scott Galloway: I think the EU is just fine.
[00:31:46] Kara Swisher: I mean, first off,
[00:31:47] Kara Swisher: Musk wants them to break.
[00:31:48] Kara Swisher: Who the fuck cares?
[00:31:49] Kara Swisher: I mean, I don't think anyone's going to lose any sleep
[00:31:52] Kara Swisher: over what he thinks.
[00:31:53] Kara Swisher: I think there's going to be another Brexit
[00:31:55] Scott Galloway: or a foreign term.
[00:31:56] Scott Galloway: If I was your curious drummer, that's what I do.
[00:31:58] Scott Galloway: I'd say let's do Brexit again.
[00:32:01] Scott Galloway: I mean a reverse Brexit?
[00:32:03] Kara Swisher: Yeah, reverse Brexit.
[00:32:04] Scott Galloway: Let's bring it up for a vote.
[00:32:05] Scott Galloway: I think it could save his ass.
[00:32:06] Scott Galloway: Anyway, just mark what.
[00:32:07] Scott Galloway: Think about it.
[00:32:10] Kara Swisher: By the way, just to be clear,
[00:32:12] Kara Swisher: just in terms of fact checking,
[00:32:13] Kara Swisher: Netflix didn't merge with Warner Brothers.
[00:32:16] Kara Swisher: They basically slid into Warner's DMs at 3am.
[00:32:19] Kara Swisher: Like, you up?
[00:32:20] Kara Swisher: And Warner Brothers said yes before checking
[00:32:22] Kara Swisher: who else was in the room.
[00:32:23] Kara Swisher: Do I get to run the studio?
[00:32:24] Scott Galloway: Do I get to just want around, says Dave?
[00:32:27] By the way, Dave gets the prize here.
[00:32:29] Scott Galloway: Dave wins no matter what.
[00:32:31] Scott Galloway: It's ass off.
[00:32:32] Oh god, I hope the synch is stretched out,
[00:32:34] Kara Swisher: eight, 15 years, so he'll be 90 trying to spend that money.
[00:32:37] Kara Swisher: I actually think the EU is really stepped up.
[00:32:41] Kara Swisher: And I have a tendency to look at everything
[00:32:43] Kara Swisher: through the lens of Ukraine.
[00:32:45] Kara Swisher: And for too long,
[00:32:47] Kara Swisher: the EU didn't have his act together,
[00:32:49] Kara Swisher: expecting Big Brother to provide this military umbrella
[00:32:52] Kara Swisher: and didn't pay their fair share, especially Spain,
[00:32:55] Kara Swisher: in a couple other countries.
[00:32:56] And they are getting their act together.
[00:32:58] Kara Swisher: And they've basically said,
[00:32:59] Kara Swisher: America, I love America,
[00:33:00] Kara Swisher: it comes up with a peace plan
[00:33:02] Kara Swisher: that is basically parroting, you know,
[00:33:04] Kara Swisher: surged Lavrov's talking points.
[00:33:05] Kara Swisher: Like, this is what Russia wants.
[00:33:07] Kara Swisher: And this is a plan we want.
[00:33:08] Kara Swisher: And the nice thing about this is,
[00:33:09] Kara Swisher: it doesn't really fucking matter
[00:33:10] Kara Swisher: because America is still relevant
[00:33:13] Kara Swisher: in that it still has service to air defense systems
[00:33:18] that are really important.
[00:33:20] Kara Swisher: But the EU industrial base is actually pretty strong,
[00:33:24] Kara Swisher: revving up, producing really good weapons.
[00:33:26] Kara Swisher: They have stepped up in terms of financial support
[00:33:28] Kara Swisher: for Ukraine and quite frankly,
[00:33:30] Kara Swisher: the US has with drawn financial support
[00:33:33] Kara Swisher: and all they really do is sell weapons,
[00:33:35] Kara Swisher: bought purchase from the EU
[00:33:38] Kara Swisher: and deliver them to Ukraine.
[00:33:41] Kara Swisher: And a couple of times,
[00:33:42] Kara Swisher: they've stopped,
[00:33:43] Kara Swisher: Tadea Vance has gotten in the way
[00:33:44] Kara Swisher: of those armed shipments.
[00:33:46] Kara Swisher: But my point is,
[00:33:48] Kara Swisher: the US has become less and less relevant in Ukraine.
[00:33:52] Kara Swisher: And I think the EU is for the first time a union again.
[00:33:56] Kara Swisher: And that is, I think the Ukraine war
[00:33:59] Kara Swisher: one of the many benefits of this
[00:34:01] Kara Swisher: in terms of occupying the space they command
[00:34:03] Kara Swisher: is that the EU is trying to get along
[00:34:06] Kara Swisher: and being more coordinated.
[00:34:08] Kara Swisher: So I don't think musk saying,
[00:34:10] Kara Swisher: I think it's meaningless.
[00:34:12] Kara Swisher: I think it's him gasping for
[00:34:14] Kara Swisher: to control the news cycle on something that's meaningless.
[00:34:17] Kara Swisher: They're not going to respond.
[00:34:18] Kara Swisher: Why should they?
[00:34:19] Kara Swisher: Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:34:21] Scott Galloway: Now, the going public,
[00:34:22] Scott Galloway: they're obviously at some point going public.
[00:34:24] Scott Galloway: He likes the money
[00:34:26] Scott Galloway: and this is a good way for him to death liquidate,
[00:34:30] Scott Galloway: I suppose, to do other nefarious things.
[00:34:33] Scott Galloway: I think they're probably going public this year
[00:34:35] Scott Galloway: as many people think they are.
[00:34:37] Scott Galloway: With the EU stuff,
[00:34:39] Scott Galloway: I'm not kidding about rethinking Brexit.
[00:34:43] Scott Galloway: I think this is the time.
[00:34:45] Scott Galloway: Most people in England think it's a mistake,
[00:34:47] Scott Galloway: it was a mistake.
[00:34:49] Scott Galloway: So why not go and revisit it?
[00:34:51] Scott Galloway: It would give Starmer a lot of power.
[00:34:53] Scott Galloway: And defocus from his negatives,
[00:34:55] Scott Galloway: which are quite high from what I understand.
[00:34:58] Scott Galloway: The idea that Europe is a union should be
[00:35:01] Scott Galloway: without the US as its sugar daddy is a great idea,
[00:35:05] Scott Galloway: I think.
[00:35:07] Scott Galloway: I think it's just, you know,
[00:35:09] Scott Galloway: and also they'll always be across purposes over.
[00:35:11] Scott Galloway: I mean, Marco Rubio's statement could have been made by Obama
[00:35:15] Scott Galloway: made a similar statement a many years ago.
[00:35:17] Scott Galloway: Like how dare they regulate our tech platforms?
[00:35:21] Scott Galloway: And that's fine and good,
[00:35:23] Scott Galloway: except we never regulate them.
[00:35:25] Scott Galloway: We have a little more control over our tech moguls.
[00:35:29] Scott Galloway: Maybe they wouldn't have to do this and go so far as they tend to do.
[00:35:33] Scott Galloway: That's just my feeling.
[00:35:35] Kara Swisher: I mean, I agree the rejoin pathway,
[00:35:37] Kara Swisher: the UK would have to start from scratch,
[00:35:39] Kara Swisher: because every member nation would now have to approve it.
[00:35:43] Kara Swisher: And in some may hesitate,
[00:35:45] Kara Swisher: the UK would be expected to comply with the full body of EU laws
[00:35:49] Kara Swisher: and regulations.
[00:35:51] Kara Swisher: Already, the UK government, by the way,
[00:35:53] Kara Swisher: Starmor has probably ruled out a return to the EU.
[00:35:57] Kara Swisher: And so it's like,
[00:35:59] Kara Swisher: it just, it, it, I agree it makes sense at a 30,000 foot level,
[00:36:03] Kara Swisher: but I think the politics here are probably too much.
[00:36:05] Kara Swisher: Make it the unwinding was so complicated
[00:36:09] Kara Swisher: that is probably is probably not going to happen.
[00:36:13] Kara Swisher: In terms of space acts,
[00:36:15] Kara Swisher: like I don't, I think,
[00:36:17] you know, I'm going to do a predictions episode,
[00:36:19] but I think the new AI in terms of a frenzy around cheap capital
[00:36:23] Kara Swisher: and some stocks is going,
[00:36:25] Kara Swisher: Abe shit next year is in one word is going to be space.
[00:36:29] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:36:31] Kara Swisher: And if I were,
[00:36:33] Kara Swisher: if I were the IR,
[00:36:35] Kara Swisher: the head of IR for space acts,
[00:36:37] Kara Swisher: I would basically just have one talking point.
[00:36:39] Kara Swisher: And that is okay.
[00:36:41] Kara Swisher: Meta, you own two thirds of all social media on this thing called planet Earth.
[00:36:45] Kara Swisher: Alpha bet 90% of stars.
[00:36:47] Kara Swisher: Alpha bet 90% of searches on planet Earth.
[00:36:51] Kara Swisher: Amazon 50% of e-commerce in a small piece of planet Earth called e-commerce.
[00:36:57] Kara Swisher: We at space acts have 90% share of fucking everything else.
[00:37:01] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:37:03] Kara Swisher: The universe, the 100,000 galaxies,
[00:37:05] Kara Swisher: the 10 million universes.
[00:37:07] Kara Swisher: We have 90% of launch capability.
[00:37:09] Kara Swisher: We control two thirds of the satellites.
[00:37:11] Kara Swisher: And space is transitioning from narcissism
[00:37:13] Kara Swisher: and Katy Perry going into space.
[00:37:15] Kara Swisher: And, you know, billionaires and space tourism,
[00:37:19] Kara Swisher: which was just fucking stupid,
[00:37:21] Kara Swisher: and it's moving to connectivity,
[00:37:23] Kara Swisher: which will be, you know,
[00:37:25] Kara Swisher: we need satellites.
[00:37:27] Kara Swisher: And then the next run tier where I would invest,
[00:37:29] Kara Swisher: if I could find the right companies,
[00:37:31] Kara Swisher: the next huge space,
[00:37:33] Kara Swisher: I think is going to be space defense.
[00:37:35] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:37:37] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:37:39] Kara Swisher: Anyways, my point is that
[00:37:41] Kara Swisher: in space, in space acts,
[00:37:43] Kara Swisher: look at what happened in terms of the plummeting price and processing power,
[00:37:47] Kara Swisher: the increase in bandwidth,
[00:37:49] Kara Swisher: all of these things,
[00:37:51] Kara Swisher: the next seminal figure we're all going to talk about
[00:37:53] Kara Swisher: and have some sort of musk law or Moore's law,
[00:37:55] Kara Swisher: is it essentially the cost to get a kilogram of material into space
[00:37:59] Kara Swisher: because of the Falcon Heavy or whatever they call it,
[00:38:01] Kara Swisher: is declined by 90%.
[00:38:03] Scott Galloway: Yeah. No. Let me pay Elon Musk.
[00:38:05] Scott Galloway: I remember when he started talking about putting up all those
[00:38:09] Scott Galloway: low orbit satellites at the time.
[00:38:12] Scott Galloway: I remember having a conversation,
[00:38:14] Scott Galloway: and there were two people who were doing this oddly enough.
[00:38:16] Scott Galloway: It was Elon, who I talked to about quite a bit,
[00:38:18] Scott Galloway: and Jerry Yang had a company like this,
[00:38:22] Scott Galloway: interestingly, after he left Yahoo,
[00:38:24] Scott Galloway: and I was really riveted to this idea,
[00:38:26] Scott Galloway: and it was such,
[00:38:28] Scott Galloway: I can't underscore how much of a risk it was at the time,
[00:38:30] Scott Galloway: by the way, everybody.
[00:38:32] Scott Galloway: This was, I know you all hate Elon,
[00:38:34] Scott Galloway: but I have to tell you,
[00:38:36] Scott Galloway: this was a great move,
[00:38:38] Scott Galloway: like really in terms of thinking ahead,
[00:38:40] Scott Galloway: like nine steps,
[00:38:42] Scott Galloway: wanting to have his mind not so fucked up.
[00:38:44] Scott Galloway: No missionary, bold, risky.
[00:38:46] Kara Swisher: I think it's decrepit now,
[00:38:48] Scott Galloway: but at the time it was really something unusual,
[00:38:52] Scott Galloway: and there were only a few people talking about it,
[00:38:54] Scott Galloway: and Jeff Bezos was sort of talking about rockets,
[00:38:56] Scott Galloway: but not really, not like this,
[00:38:58] Scott Galloway: not on this very... Well, they have Kuiper,
[00:39:00] Scott Galloway: but... Yeah, well, they do now,
[00:39:02] Scott Galloway: but I'm just saying it wasn't this,
[00:39:04] Scott Galloway: it wasn't this sort of systemic,
[00:39:06] Scott Galloway: put these low orbit satellites,
[00:39:08] Scott Galloway: and again, Jerry Yang had a company too,
[00:39:10] Scott Galloway: and I don't know what happened to it,
[00:39:12] Scott Galloway: but those are the two people I discussed it with,
[00:39:14] Scott Galloway: and this was a long... Anyway,
[00:39:16] Scott Galloway: I think it has to go public.
[00:39:18] Scott Galloway: I think he's got to continue his lead
[00:39:20] Scott Galloway: and continue pushing forward.
[00:39:22] Scott Galloway: He lost his lead in Tesla,
[00:39:24] Scott Galloway: despite the stock going up.
[00:39:26] Scott Galloway: He's definitely lost his lead.
[00:39:28] Scott Galloway: He shouldn't lose his lead here.
[00:39:30] Scott Galloway: Anyway, let's go on a quick break.
[00:39:32] Scott Galloway: When we come back,
[00:39:34] Scott Galloway: Meta makes cuts to the Metaverse.
[00:39:36] Scott Galloway: Considering cutting up to 30% of employees
[00:39:38] Scott Galloway: in his Metaverse unit, which work on BR headsets since 2020,
[00:39:42] Scott Galloway: the division has lost more than 70 billion dollars.
[00:39:44] Scott Galloway: Metal reportedly shifts savings
[00:39:46] Scott Galloway: from the cuts to its augmented reality glasses,
[00:39:48] Scott Galloway: which are a very fun thing,
[00:39:50] Scott Galloway: but kind of, I think, minor.
[00:39:52] Scott Galloway: Meanwhile, in the other latest meta-AI moves,
[00:39:54] Scott Galloway: meta-as-acquiring,
[00:39:56] Scott Galloway: AI wearable startup limitless,
[00:39:58] Scott Galloway: which makes a small AI pendant
[00:40:00] Scott Galloway: that can record conversations and generate summaries.
[00:40:02] Scott Galloway: And the company has struck several commercial AI data agreements
[00:40:04] Scott Galloway: with news publishers like CNN Fox,
[00:40:06] Scott Galloway: and USA Today to provide real-time answers to queries
[00:40:09] Scott Galloway: while compensating publishers, I guess.
[00:40:12] Scott Galloway: The 70 billion dollar loss,
[00:40:14] Scott Galloway: I mean, you, in particular,
[00:40:16] Scott Galloway: and me too, thought the Metaverse was idiotic.
[00:40:18] Scott Galloway: I love that you can make a mistake like this.
[00:40:20] Scott Galloway: Mark Zuckerberg can afford to make these 70 billion dollar mistakes
[00:40:24] Scott Galloway: and not suffer a second for it.
[00:40:26] Scott Galloway: It was a stupid idea,
[00:40:28] Scott Galloway: but he did move from it, I guess.
[00:40:30] Scott Galloway: I think he just wanted to change the name of the company
[00:40:32] Scott Galloway: because he was so sucked up into social media disasters.
[00:40:36] Scott Galloway: But at the time,
[00:40:38] Scott Galloway: I don't get these pendants and anything else.
[00:40:42] Scott Galloway: I'm not on board with those at all,
[00:40:44] Scott Galloway: including open AI.
[00:40:46] Scott Galloway: That's the right thing to do, I guess, right?
[00:40:50] Scott Galloway: You should focus on AI and advertising and AI offerings, presumably, right?
[00:40:56] Yeah, look, you know, easy to pat ourselves.
[00:40:59] Kara Swisher: I was the original hater of headsets and Metaverse.
[00:41:02] Kara Swisher: I said it when it wasn't cool,
[00:41:04] Kara Swisher: where everyone was talking about spatial computing.
[00:41:07] Kara Swisher: And then I said, the Apple one was just as fucking stupid.
[00:41:11] Kara Swisher: We have an instinct.
[00:41:13] Kara Swisher: We, the things we can eat
[00:41:15] Kara Swisher: and the things can eat us,
[00:41:17] Kara Swisher: don't come directly at us.
[00:41:19] Kara Swisher: They come at us from the side or behind us.
[00:41:21] Kara Swisher: And so we are very...
[00:41:23] Kara Swisher: Have someone walk behind you in Manhattan just for a block?
[00:41:25] Kara Swisher: Yeah, I'm very uncomfortable.
[00:41:27] Kara Swisher: And no one did any goddamn consumer research.
[00:41:30] Kara Swisher: And what they found when they did research was that 40% of people
[00:41:33] Kara Swisher: within like 20 minutes were nauseous.
[00:41:35] Kara Swisher: Because you're not supposed to have your peripheral vision cut off like that.
[00:41:39] And the idea of a bunch of cyborgs rocking around in their own world,
[00:41:43] Kara Swisher: even when they were outside,
[00:41:45] Kara Swisher: it was sort of a nathema to like everything we should know.
[00:41:47] Kara Swisher: I never liked the outside stuff.
[00:41:48] Scott Galloway: I liked the inside movie watching work stuff.
[00:41:50] Scott Galloway: But go...
[00:41:51] Scott Galloway: It was also fucking stupid.
[00:41:53] Kara Swisher: A legless...
[00:41:54] Kara Swisher: I mean, I...
[00:41:55] Kara Swisher: Also the legless, yeah.
[00:41:56] Scott Galloway: Didn't have legs as it turned on.
[00:41:58] Scott Galloway: The whole thing was ridiculous.
[00:42:02] Kara Swisher: But when you're a meta,
[00:42:04] Kara Swisher: you can burn 70 billion.
[00:42:06] Kara Swisher: So this was like a...
[00:42:08] Kara Swisher: I don't wanna say a speed bump form.
[00:42:10] Kara Swisher: It was definitely a pothole.
[00:42:12] He does move fast when he bucks out.
[00:42:14] Scott Galloway: Well, I don't know how to say it really.
[00:42:16] Kara Swisher: I mean, this has been a good five years, right?
[00:42:18] Kara Swisher: No, I've sexually been a while.
[00:42:20] Scott Galloway: He kind of loves...
[00:42:22] Scott Galloway: He loved this thing.
[00:42:23] Scott Galloway: He really did.
[00:42:24] Scott Galloway: Remember the dressing thing?
[00:42:25] Scott Galloway: And then the legs.
[00:42:26] Scott Galloway: But remember, he's like,
[00:42:27] Scott Galloway: I think I'll try.
[00:42:28] Scott Galloway: I think I'll dance with like Rihanna or whatever the hell.
[00:42:31] Scott Galloway: He's so stupid.
[00:42:32] Scott Galloway: Yeah, I don't...
[00:42:33] Kara Swisher: Like, I don't...
[00:42:35] Kara Swisher: I do think the place where all of this R&D will pay off
[00:42:40] Kara Swisher: isn't smart classes.
[00:42:41] Kara Swisher: I do think meta's kind of a very strong offering there.
[00:42:44] You think it's a big market tone?
[00:42:45] Scott Galloway: I don't think so.
[00:42:46] Scott Galloway: I think that at some point,
[00:42:48] Kara Swisher: where a lot of us are gonna have kind of whatever you wanna call
[00:42:51] Kara Swisher: it, virtual VR, AR enabled glasses.
[00:42:54] Kara Swisher: Not glasses.
[00:42:55] Kara Swisher: They're gonna be the AirPods with video.
[00:42:57] Scott Galloway: I'm still not into these pendants either.
[00:43:00] Scott Galloway: I think it has...
[00:43:01] Scott Galloway: I never said those.
[00:43:02] Scott Galloway: I think it has to be in your ear.
[00:43:05] Scott Galloway: I feel like in your ears.
[00:43:06] Scott Galloway: Well, what you're saying is the most practical vision
[00:43:09] Kara Swisher: is that the AirPods get more harmonious with your iPhone.
[00:43:13] Kara Swisher: Right.
[00:43:14] And your iPhone becomes your headset.
[00:43:15] Kara Swisher: And you're walking by.
[00:43:16] Kara Swisher: You're looking for an...
[00:43:17] Kara Swisher: You're in Soho and you think,
[00:43:18] Kara Swisher: Oh, I love Crosby.
[00:43:19] Kara Swisher: What I love this street.
[00:43:21] Kara Swisher: What apartments are...
[00:43:22] Kara Swisher: You know, hey Siri, what apartments are available here?
[00:43:24] Kara Swisher: And you hold up your phone and as you scan around,
[00:43:26] Kara Swisher: it tells you what apartments are available
[00:43:28] Kara Swisher: on the building you're looking at.
[00:43:29] Kara Swisher: Right.
[00:43:30] And what they're going for and click here to speak to a broker.
[00:43:32] Kara Swisher: I mean, there's just a lot of stuff.
[00:43:33] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:43:34] Kara Swisher: I feel like that's how it's gonna go.
[00:43:35] Scott Galloway: But these...
[00:43:36] Scott Galloway: You might...
[00:43:37] Scott Galloway: Would you wear a pendant?
[00:43:38] Scott Galloway: I feel like an old person.
[00:43:39] Scott Galloway: I've fallen and I can't get up.
[00:43:40] Scott Galloway: I don't know.
[00:43:41] Scott Galloway: No, I mean, I've been forgetting about my diapers.
[00:43:43] Kara Swisher: I'm not going to wear a pendant.
[00:43:44] Kara Swisher: She falls every five minutes.
[00:43:45] Scott Galloway: Yeah.
[00:43:46] No, I wouldn't wear a pendant.
[00:43:48] Kara Swisher: I wear a bunch of crazy bracelets on my wrist, though.
[00:43:51] Kara Swisher: I still have a lot of talk to you.
[00:43:52] Kara Swisher: Yes, I wear this because I find it useful.
[00:43:54] Scott Galloway: I wear this because it's a watch too.
[00:43:56] Scott Galloway: And I'm...
[00:43:57] Scott Galloway: You're used to it.
[00:43:58] Kara Swisher: I wear this because it makes random sexual encounter more likely
[00:44:00] Kara Swisher: if I have a camera eye.
[00:44:01] Kara Swisher: Okay.
[00:44:02] Scott Galloway: But let me just say the one thing is on Star Trek.
[00:44:03] Scott Galloway: It's a skirky watch right over that.
[00:44:04] Scott Galloway: I did.
[00:44:05] Scott Galloway: I'm ignoring.
[00:44:06] Scott Galloway: On Star Trek, they all had those things that they hit.
[00:44:09] Scott Galloway: I think that's where this is coming from.
[00:44:10] Scott Galloway: Remember, they always hit it and talk to it.
[00:44:13] Scott Galloway: The little thing.
[00:44:14] Scott Galloway: They're a little chest thing.
[00:44:15] Scott Galloway: I don't remember that.
[00:44:16] Kara Swisher: Captain Kirk always hit this little metal on his chest.
[00:44:20] Scott Galloway: I just want to know who was hit in Lieutenant O'Hurl.
[00:44:23] Kara Swisher: He was.
[00:44:24] Scott Galloway: They had a watch on the show, do you remember?
[00:44:27] Scott Galloway: Really?
[00:44:28] Scott Galloway: Anyway, speaking of which, the New York Times is suing
[00:44:30] Scott Galloway: from PlexiDI claiming...
[00:44:32] Scott Galloway: Speaking of which, good stuff.
[00:44:34] Scott Galloway: Speaking of which, Blue Hero and Captain Kirk getting it on.
[00:44:37] Kara Swisher: No, I was just thinking more AI stuff.
[00:44:39] Scott Galloway: I've moved on from that.
[00:44:40] Scott Galloway: By the way, New York Times did two ballers.
[00:44:43] Scott Galloway: Lawsuits, once against the Trump administration for the Pentagon,
[00:44:45] Scott Galloway: crap, they're pull.
[00:44:46] Scott Galloway: But the New York Times, they're suing PlexiDI claiming that the AI
[00:44:50] Scott Galloway: startup copying strip millions of articles.
[00:44:52] Scott Galloway: Lawsuit also alleges that PlexiDI use pay world stories.
[00:44:55] Scott Galloway: Sometimes attribute and hallucinated content of the Times.
[00:44:58] Scott Galloway: The Times says Plexi ignored multiple requests to stop for nearly two years.
[00:45:02] Scott Galloway: I mean, oh, yeah, yeah, PlexiDI.
[00:45:05] Scott Galloway: They're always in the middle of this.
[00:45:07] Scott Galloway: They feel like they're the bad guys.
[00:45:10] Scott Galloway: I don't know.
[00:45:11] Scott Galloway: What is happening over there?
[00:45:12] Yeah, but you hear less and less about PlexiDI.
[00:45:15] Kara Swisher: Yeah, I know.
[00:45:16] Kara Swisher: It feels like it's kind of fading away.
[00:45:18] Kara Swisher: Some of the research analysts here are propped to use it and they like it.
[00:45:22] Kara Swisher: But, yeah, look, I've said for a long time,
[00:45:26] Kara Swisher: I thought the old school guy should band together.
[00:45:29] Kara Swisher: And basically are very dillard to be their tag dog and go after these guys
[00:45:34] Kara Swisher: and say, look, if you're going to...
[00:45:38] Kara Swisher: I mean, I really enjoyed actually your, I think it was your interview with Jessica Yellen.
[00:45:43] Kara Swisher: And she said something, I love insight that's obvious.
[00:45:46] Kara Swisher: This is news that noise Jessica Yellen.
[00:45:48] Scott Galloway: Yeah, Jessica Yellen.
[00:45:49] Scott Galloway: She's great.
[00:45:50] You know, not Fed share Janet Yellen.
[00:45:52] Kara Swisher: Yeah, Jessica Yellen.
[00:45:54] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:45:55] Kara Swisher: Anyways, she said something that was so, I love obvious insight.
[00:45:59] Kara Swisher: She knows she's smart.
[00:46:00] Kara Swisher: I didn't think about that way.
[00:46:01] Kara Swisher: And she said that traditional media still shapes the narrative.
[00:46:06] Kara Swisher: All these platforms, they're all inspired.
[00:46:09] Kara Swisher: It's like they provide the coal.
[00:46:11] Kara Swisher: And you may burn it and offer different means of electricity on different platforms.
[00:46:15] Kara Swisher: But the coal, the raw content that shapes all of this, comes from the NYT,
[00:46:21] Kara Swisher: the Washington Post, CBS.
[00:46:23] Kara Swisher: I mean, it starts on traditional media.
[00:46:26] Kara Swisher: And the problem is, is that these guys need to get more aggressive
[00:46:30] Kara Swisher: about recognizing that value from the downstream people who are making all the money.
[00:46:35] Because then I said this when I first went on the board of the New York Times,
[00:46:39] Kara Swisher: like we got to turn off the Google crawlers.
[00:46:41] Kara Swisher: Right. Right.
[00:46:42] Scott Galloway: And we got to consolidate with the Murdox, the guys at the FT,
[00:46:48] Kara Swisher: the new houses at Condon Ass.
[00:46:50] Kara Swisher: And we got to license it all and create a bidding war
[00:46:53] Kara Swisher: because being was still a thing back then.
[00:46:55] Kara Swisher: And I remember the lawyers were like, that would be antitrust.
[00:46:58] Kara Swisher: I'm like, we're dying here.
[00:47:00] Kara Swisher: We're dying.
[00:47:02] And you're worried about antitrust that if we bind together and try and license our content.
[00:47:06] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:47:07] Kara Swisher: We're very nervous people.
[00:47:08] Scott Galloway: Anyways, this is, if you really, if you think about,
[00:47:13] Kara Swisher: there's value add and then influence,
[00:47:16] Kara Swisher: and then there's ability to monetize it.
[00:47:18] Kara Swisher: And the real tragedy of old media is that its influence is winning from a viewership standpoint.
[00:47:23] Kara Swisher: But in terms of the actual stories that get circulated online,
[00:47:27] Kara Swisher: they're still shaped by traditional media.
[00:47:29] Kara Swisher: And I hadn't thought about it that way.
[00:47:31] Kara Swisher: I think it was really insightful.
[00:47:32] Kara Swisher: Yeah, absolutely. That's where they get to think.
[00:47:33] Scott Galloway: Especially in New York Times.
[00:47:35] Scott Galloway: Like there's certain ones they get it from and others.
[00:47:37] Scott Galloway: I mean, no one's quoting very much from Los Angeles Times anymore.
[00:47:40] Scott Galloway: They a little bit.
[00:47:41] Scott Galloway: They do it every now and then a good story.
[00:47:43] Scott Galloway: But it's a very small number of Wall Street Journal,
[00:47:46] Scott Galloway: Washington Post still to an extent,
[00:47:48] Scott Galloway: although, again, although as much as it's,
[00:47:51] Scott Galloway: it's news editor is trying hard to do it.
[00:47:54] Scott Galloway: It's, you know, it's a declining asset.
[00:47:56] Scott Galloway: But, but you're right.
[00:47:57] Scott Galloway: Absolutely.
[00:47:58] Scott Galloway: I like the New York Times did it anyway.
[00:48:00] Scott Galloway: And I like that they sued the Pentagon.
[00:48:01] Scott Galloway: You know, I like that the cost goes to the government about tariffs.
[00:48:04] Scott Galloway: I kind of, you're seeing as I said a little bit of a backbone here.
[00:48:07] Scott Galloway: And I think Meredith Levin is really sharp in terms of,
[00:48:10] Scott Galloway: they got to do this.
[00:48:11] Scott Galloway: I got to put it on record.
[00:48:12] Scott Galloway: So.
[00:48:13] Scott Galloway: But I don't get to again,
[00:48:14] Kara Swisher: why wouldn't the NYT bind together with every other media organization
[00:48:17] Kara Swisher: and go after proplacity?
[00:48:18] Kara Swisher: I think they do.
[00:48:19] Kara Swisher: I think they kind of do.
[00:48:20] Scott Galloway: They talk to me.
[00:48:21] Scott Galloway: I think they coordinate.
[00:48:22] Scott Galloway: I mean, maybe they don't,
[00:48:23] Scott Galloway: but I think they probably do.
[00:48:24] Scott Galloway: I don't know.
[00:48:25] Scott Galloway: Anyway, propexity stops stealing our shit.
[00:48:27] Scott Galloway: Okay.
[00:48:28] Scott Galloway: Thank you.
[00:48:29] Scott Galloway: All right.
[00:48:30] Scott Galloway: Scott, one more quick break.
[00:48:31] Scott Galloway: We'll be back for wins and fails.
[00:48:32] Scott Galloway: Okay.
[00:48:33] Scott Galloway: Scott, let's hear some wins and fails.
[00:48:35] Scott Galloway: Do you, would you like to start?
[00:48:37] Scott Galloway: You go first, huh?
[00:48:39] Scott Galloway: Well, I want to say congratulations, you know, we aren't one of them
[00:48:42] Scott Galloway: for the Golden Globes best podcast.
[00:48:44] Scott Galloway: Lots of people tried to get it like Ben Chaviro was like paying a lot of money
[00:48:49] Scott Galloway: for marketing together.
[00:48:50] Scott Galloway: I didn't even know they had that.
[00:48:51] Kara Swisher: They know it is.
[00:48:52] Kara Swisher: Yeah, no, no.
[00:48:53] Kara Swisher: This was a big thing happening.
[00:48:54] Scott Galloway: So, so they're armchair expert with Dak Shepherd.
[00:48:57] Scott Galloway: It's not us just so you know, call her daddy.
[00:49:00] Scott Galloway: Good hang with Amy Poler, the Mel Robbins podcast smart list.
[00:49:03] Scott Galloway: I love those guys and up first from NPR.
[00:49:06] Scott Galloway: No, Joe Rogan, no Megan Kelly, no Ben Chaviro those guys.
[00:49:10] Scott Galloway: Those are all great.
[00:49:11] Kara Swisher: Those are all great podcasts.
[00:49:12] Scott Galloway: Taxes create.
[00:49:13] Scott Galloway: I think Mel Robbins is great.
[00:49:14] Scott Galloway: And they're all great.
[00:49:15] Kara Swisher: Oh my god.
[00:49:16] Kara Swisher: Probably the smart list guys.
[00:49:17] Scott Galloway: I like them so much.
[00:49:18] Scott Galloway: The smart list.
[00:49:19] Kara Swisher: Although I like the NPR people.
[00:49:21] Scott Galloway: I say the NPR people.
[00:49:23] Anyway, congratulations.
[00:49:24] Scott Galloway: Of course it should have been us.
[00:49:25] Scott Galloway: But yeah, next year.
[00:49:26] But congratulations.
[00:49:27] Scott Galloway: And my fail is.
[00:49:28] Scott Galloway: Well, you know what's soon enough you're going to be so old.
[00:49:29] Scott Galloway: They're going to be a lifetime achievement award.
[00:49:30] Kara Swisher: So they're going to go that way.
[00:49:31] Kara Swisher: Oh, you think I've already getting those.
[00:49:32] Kara Swisher: I'm already getting those.
[00:49:33] Kara Swisher: I'm really already getting those.
[00:49:34] Kara Swisher: It's kind of crazy.
[00:49:35] Scott Galloway: My fail is, you know, sticking with this deal.
[00:49:37] Scott Galloway: This is happening.
[00:49:38] Scott Galloway: Hollywood really has failed to understea.
[00:49:48] Scott Galloway: They're still fighting previous fights.
[00:49:50] Scott Galloway: And I think they have to start thinking about what entertainment is and how things have changed.
[00:49:55] Scott Galloway: And they're always.
[00:49:57] Scott Galloway: They're always just talking about the last turn of the screw.
[00:50:00] Scott Galloway: And it's it's kind of over in a lot of ways.
[00:50:03] Scott Galloway: And so therefore how do you like I still get struck by the two most popular movies with consumers.
[00:50:09] Scott Galloway: Where weapons and centers very creative.
[00:50:12] Scott Galloway: One person things.
[00:50:14] Scott Galloway: And I get their inclination to fight for theater.
[00:50:18] Scott Galloway: You know, they want to be in the theaters for longer.
[00:50:21] Scott Galloway: There's just this fight with Netflix over 14 days over 45 days.
[00:50:25] Scott Galloway: And they want to be in the theater.
[00:50:26] Scott Galloway: Well, if you want to do that, then make yourselves an economic world where you can do that.
[00:50:30] Scott Galloway: Like it doesn't mean you can't do it.
[00:50:32] Scott Galloway: It means that you can't just blame Netflix for doing its business.
[00:50:37] Scott Galloway: You have to figure out how it is.
[00:50:39] Scott Galloway: If that's what you want, figure out an economic way to do it instead of bitching and moaning about Netflix.
[00:50:45] Scott Galloway: Like I'm sorry they made a product people want to buy and they have a theory.
[00:50:49] Scott Galloway: So have your own theory.
[00:50:51] Scott Galloway: And I really wish Hollywood would take that if you want to be in theaters, figure out a business where theaters work economically, even if it just breaks even instead of blaming everybody for your woes, most of which are due to.
[00:51:04] Scott Galloway: Economics that don't work anymore.
[00:51:06] Scott Galloway: And that's that's for everyone across every industry.
[00:51:09] Scott Galloway: Everyone else doesn't mow in this much.
[00:51:11] Scott Galloway: All it would like to know.
[00:51:12] Scott Galloway: Thank you.
[00:51:13] Scott Galloway: I can't wait to see if an extra from Star Trek decides you're the devil like they did with me two years ago.
[00:51:19] Kara Swisher: Yeah, they will.
[00:51:20] Scott Galloway: I sorry, I just can't like I don't want to hear it.
[00:51:23] Scott Galloway: I like do something about it.
[00:51:24] Scott Galloway: Thank you.
[00:51:25] Well, I can.
[00:51:27] Kara Swisher: So I didn't.
[00:51:29] Kara Swisher: I both kind of fails with opposition one is a win.
[00:51:32] Kara Swisher: It's traditionally American armed services when a combatant is disabled and no longer presents a lethal threat.
[00:51:39] We offer them quarter, which is essentially mercy.
[00:51:42] Kara Swisher: And I had Admiral James DeBritus former Supreme Allied commander of NATO, which by the way is the coolest title.
[00:51:49] Kara Swisher: Yeah, I know.
[00:51:50] Scott Galloway: Supreme.
[00:51:51] Kara Swisher: I just, you know what, ladies, don't or guys, I mean at a bar, don't go up and say, may I meet you say hi, I'm the Supreme Allied commander of NATO.
[00:51:59] Kara Swisher: Just take it from there.
[00:52:00] Kara Swisher: Your name is Supreme Allied commander, Pivot.
[00:52:03] Scott Galloway: 100%.
[00:52:04] Kara Swisher: I'm getting in trouble for suggesting certain people have sacks and propagate.
[00:52:08] Kara Swisher: One guy called me and said he filled objectified.
[00:52:11] Kara Swisher: I'm Michael dude.
[00:52:12] Kara Swisher: We've been objectifying women for thousands of years.
[00:52:14] Kara Swisher: Why can't I objectify you?
[00:52:15] Kara Swisher: Anyway, was that Jake Tapper?
[00:52:18] Scott Galloway: By the way, I still think Michael Boberos probably just fucking a crazy weirdo on the sack.
[00:52:23] Kara Swisher: What do you think?
[00:52:24] Kara Swisher: What do you think?
[00:52:25] Kara Swisher: Not speaking to me because of our last.
[00:52:27] Scott Galloway: Because of us.
[00:52:28] Scott Galloway: I agree.
[00:52:29] Scott Galloway: I you can glow up.
[00:52:30] Scott Galloway: Yes, they're client all you want.
[00:52:31] Scott Galloway: But Michael Barbarrow wins hands down over there.
[00:52:34] Kara Swisher: As their clients had a glow up.
[00:52:35] Kara Swisher: Oh my god.
[00:52:36] Scott Galloway: I got to tell you he's like, hello, ladies.
[00:52:38] Scott Galloway: I told you mine.
[00:52:39] Kara Swisher: Safe word with Ezra.
[00:52:40] Kara Swisher: What?
[00:52:41] Maybe.
[00:52:42] All right.
[00:52:43] Move along.
[00:52:44] Move along.
[00:52:45] Scott Galloway: Call us Ezra.
[00:52:46] Scott Galloway: All right.
[00:52:47] Scott Galloway: So that is well.
[00:52:48] Kara Swisher: A bond that's build more housing.
[00:52:49] Kara Swisher: Don't shoot people out of the water after they're floating.
[00:52:52] Scott Galloway: Okay.
[00:52:53] Kara Swisher: Okay.
[00:52:54] Kara Swisher: So, but listen.
[00:52:55] Scott Galloway: There's actually, I just want to break down why we offer quarter to enemy combatants
[00:53:02] Kara Swisher: when they are no longer a threat to us.
[00:53:05] Kara Swisher: One, it's just the right thing to do.
[00:53:09] Kara Swisher: We're human beings.
[00:53:11] Kara Swisher: We treat people better.
[00:53:13] Kara Swisher: We have a certain decorum around humanity.
[00:53:15] Kara Swisher: And we set a strong example of the rest of the world.
[00:53:17] Kara Swisher: The Imperial Navy in World War II.
[00:53:20] Kara Swisher: Machine guns, sailors who were in the water.
[00:53:23] Kara Swisher: So did the, so did the, so did you boats and the Nazi from the third Reich.
[00:53:29] Kara Swisher: Nazis did the same thing.
[00:53:30] Kara Swisher: We did not.
[00:53:31] Kara Swisher: If enemy combatants were in the water, we scooped them up and we put them in a prisoner of war camp.
[00:53:36] Kara Swisher: It's the right thing to do.
[00:53:37] Kara Swisher: Number two, it gives you tactical advantage on the field because if people think they're going to die anyways,
[00:53:44] Kara Swisher: they're less likely to surrender.
[00:53:46] Kara Swisher: If they believe you will give them quarter, they're more likely to say, I surrender.
[00:53:50] Kara Swisher: And also you get incredible intelligence from the people who do surrender.
[00:53:54] Kara Swisher: So you can interrogate them.
[00:53:56] Kara Swisher: And then third and finally, when you blow and murder, these are war crimes.
[00:54:01] Kara Swisher: These are murders.
[00:54:02] Kara Swisher: Because this isn't a war.
[00:54:03] Kara Swisher: These are murders.
[00:54:04] Kara Swisher: And when you murder two people clinging to a capsized boat, what you're doing is you're putting our own Navy seals in harm's way.
[00:54:12] Kara Swisher: Because other nations do, in fact, cooperate and have a certain decorum here.
[00:54:17] Kara Swisher: There are even rules and more.
[00:54:18] Kara Swisher: We decided at the end of World War I that poison gasing was probably not the way to go.
[00:54:23] Kara Swisher: And everyone respected that.
[00:54:25] Kara Swisher: We now have laws.
[00:54:26] Kara Swisher: We have laser technology where we could blind everyone on the field.
[00:54:29] Kara Swisher: We have bio weapons.
[00:54:32] Kara Swisher: And all nations have decided, no, let's leave that out of our toolkit.
[00:54:36] Kara Swisher: It could get really ugly, really fast and gently speaking.
[00:54:39] Kara Swisher: And generally speaking, when combatant enemy forces have captured or overrun American forces,
[00:54:46] Kara Swisher: they oftentimes take them prisoner one because they think they'll get money for them and they're worth a lot.
[00:54:52] Kara Swisher: But two, we have traditionally offered quarter to them.
[00:54:56] Kara Swisher: So this is morally wrong.
[00:54:58] Kara Swisher: It's tactically stupid.
[00:55:00] Kara Swisher: And it puts our servicemen and service women in harm's way.
[00:55:04] Kara Swisher: Well said.
[00:55:05] Scott Galloway: Well said.
[00:55:06] Kara Swisher: My Supreme Allied commander pivot.
[00:55:08] Scott Galloway: Well said.
[00:55:09] My loss here is I'm just sick of these ridiculous conversations around affordability with no substance.
[00:55:15] Kara Swisher: And that is everyone talks about affordability and expect a magic fucking wand to take egg prices down.
[00:55:21] Kara Swisher: It's pretty basic.
[00:55:22] Kara Swisher: If you want more affordability, there's there's actually common sense solutions that are hard and take time and take investment.
[00:55:29] Kara Swisher: One, we need to build five to 10 million more homes.
[00:55:32] Kara Swisher: We need to weaponize the private sector.
[00:55:34] Kara Swisher: Eight, eight million.
[00:55:35] Scott Galloway: Sorry, I've been saying eight million.
[00:55:37] Scott Galloway: Go ahead.
[00:55:38] Kara Swisher: We need to weaponize the private sector.
[00:55:39] Kara Swisher: It's 40% of the consumer price index.
[00:55:41] Kara Swisher: So housing and housing has become too expensive.
[00:55:43] Kara Swisher: So we need rent freezes.
[00:55:46] Kara Swisher: Don't work.
[00:55:47] Kara Swisher: Rent control does not work.
[00:55:48] Kara Swisher: What works is providing incentives to the developer community and getting rid of these nimbly laws and committing to building.
[00:55:54] Kara Swisher: Yeah.
[00:55:55] Kara Swisher: As you said, eight million houses over 10 years manufactured homes, which on site are 50% less expensive and bring down the cost of housing.
[00:56:02] Kara Swisher: Folks, it's time universal health care.
[00:56:04] Kara Swisher: And play at using new business new building methods they have.
[00:56:08] Scott Galloway: There's all these really creative new.
[00:56:10] Scott Galloway: And by the way, take down tariffs and some of these manufactured homes had a China incredible.
[00:56:16] Kara Swisher: It's time universal health care.
[00:56:18] Kara Swisher: We spent $13,000 per person, the rest of the G7s spent $6,500.
[00:56:23] Kara Swisher: We need a national system that introduces real bargaining power into the system.
[00:56:27] Kara Swisher: And a Medicare-like public option available to everyone under 65.
[00:56:32] Kara Swisher: You lower it by two or three years every year for 10 years to give the private sector time to adjust.
[00:56:36] Kara Swisher: It is time.
[00:56:37] Kara Swisher: And you would.
[00:56:38] Kara Swisher: And you would.
[00:56:39] Kara Swisher: By most analysis, you would reduce health care spending by 15 to 25%.
[00:56:43] Kara Swisher: That's about a quarter of our deficit.
[00:56:45] Kara Swisher: And then we need a 10 fold expansion of public higher ed income linked tuition caps.
[00:56:50] Kara Swisher: Basically, your tuition is based on the income of your parents.
[00:56:53] Kara Swisher: And also, if you have over a billion dollars in endowment, Dartmouth, Harvard, everyone else, it's not growing your freshman class,
[00:57:00] Kara Swisher: fat, it's in population growth, you risk losing your tax-free status.
[00:57:03] Kara Swisher: We're not fucking Chanel bags for public servants.
[00:57:06] Kara Swisher: And then finally, and this goes back to my statement on Netflix, Massive Annie Trust,
[00:57:11] Kara Swisher: our industry's are becoming way too concentrated.
[00:57:14] Kara Swisher: And when they become this concentrated, there is a big pharma, big tax.
[00:57:19] Kara Swisher: I mean, go through all the big ag, go through all this shit.
[00:57:23] Kara Swisher: If you didn't do it and drink it with Amy Klobuchar, that's what's happening.
[00:57:26] Scott Galloway: I love Senator Kay.
[00:57:27] Kara Swisher: She's a lot of fun.
[00:57:28] Scott Galloway: Love Senator Kay.
[00:57:29] Kara Swisher: Let me say.
[00:57:30] Kara Swisher: But the problem is, we think that, oh, if we tear off people and give money to farmers,
[00:57:35] Kara Swisher: that's going to bring down prices.
[00:57:37] Kara Swisher: I mean, folks, do basic fucking math around what actually works around bringing down come.
[00:57:42] Kara Swisher: By the way, Kiss and Makeup with China.
[00:57:45] Kara Swisher: Kiss and some people get hurt.
[00:57:47] Kara Swisher: Yeah, they make shit really cheap.
[00:57:49] Kara Swisher: You want to listen to this headline.
[00:57:51] Scott Galloway: Trade surplus with China just rose to a trillion dollars, whatever.
[00:57:55] Scott Galloway: Trade circle, you know, it doesn't, they haven't been stopped by this people.
[00:57:59] Scott Galloway: Sorry, they've been.
[00:58:00] Scott Galloway: Okay, here's some stats about.
[00:58:01] Kara Swisher: I have a China podcast now.
[00:58:03] Kara Swisher: It's called China decode.
[00:58:06] Kara Swisher: The percentage of exports going to the US from China has gone from 17% of their exports to 10%.
[00:58:12] Kara Swisher: Meanwhile, since pre-COVID, since 2019, they have increased their exports 40%.
[00:58:18] Kara Swisher: So folks, people all around the world are bringing down inflation by buying China shit.
[00:58:23] Kara Swisher: 82% of the gifts under the Christmas tree this year are guests are from wait for it.
[00:58:28] Kara Swisher: China.
[00:58:29] Kara Swisher: You, you want to be able to buy your kids seven gifts, not five.
[00:58:33] Kara Swisher: Kiss and Makeup with China.
[00:58:34] Kara Swisher: They are better and making cheap low IP shit than us.
[00:58:37] Kara Swisher: Should we have trade agreements that recognize in all items, the stealer IP that they have
[00:58:41] Kara Swisher: to let our stuff in the markets?
[00:58:43] Kara Swisher: Yes.
[00:58:44] Kara Swisher: Get rid of all these trade restrictions, zero tariffs, zero free trade agreements, all fucking.
[00:58:49] Kara Swisher: There's a breaking story.
[00:58:50] Scott Galloway: The White House plans $12 billion for farmers facing trade war fallout.
[00:58:54] Scott Galloway: Why don't you just not do the trade war in the first place, Donald?
[00:58:59] Scott Galloway: Thank you.
[00:59:00] Kara Swisher: You want to talk about socialism and taxing some people and then redistributing it to farmers who are no longer competitive
[00:59:05] Kara Swisher: and quite frankly, China's not coming back.
[00:59:08] Kara Swisher: Oh, but let's give a bunch of money to the Argentinians who the Chinese are now buying soybeans.
[00:59:13] Kara Swisher: Anyway, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:59:16] Kara Swisher: But if you want to talk about affordability, we won.
[00:59:19] Kara Swisher: We need to bring down the cost of housing, 8 million homes in 10 years.
[00:59:23] Kara Swisher: There's a clear blue line path to doing that.
[00:59:25] Kara Swisher: To tuition price caps, expand your freshman class, three, we need national, absolutely need nationalized socialized medicine,
[00:59:35] Kara Swisher: bring it down eligibility for Medicare option two to three years age, age eligibility over a decade.
[00:59:42] Kara Swisher: And finally, massive antitrust.
[00:59:44] Kara Swisher: Concentration equals a leakage of power and economic viability from the labor force and from consumers to shareholders.
[00:59:53] Kara Swisher: And there's always a healthy tension between shareholders and or between capital and labor.
[00:59:57] Kara Swisher: Capital has been kicking the shit out of labor for 40 years and it's starting to hurt the economy
[01:00:02] Kara Swisher: because the top 10% that owes all the shares owns all the shares is now responsible for 50% of the fucking consumer economy.
[01:00:07] Kara Swisher: Yeah, all right.
[01:00:08] Kara Swisher: I like it.
[01:00:09] Scott Galloway: I like you becoming a communist and allied commander of pivot.
[01:00:13] Scott Galloway: It's a chaos capitalism.
[01:00:14] Scott Galloway: I know.
[01:00:15] Scott Galloway: Just Trump just promised executive order to block state AI regulations.
[01:00:19] Scott Galloway: Also get out of there.
[01:00:21] Scott Galloway: Trump.
[01:00:22] Scott Galloway: Anyway, we want to hear from you.

[01:00:26] Scott Galloway: Go to nymag.com slash pivitt.
[01:00:28] Scott Galloway: Just a minute question for the show.
[01:00:29] Scott Galloway: I call 85551 pivitt.
[01:00:31] Scott Galloway: Elsewhere in the Karen Scott universe this weekend on with Kara Spisscher.
[01:00:34] Scott Galloway: I spoke with prolific author Margaret Atwood, she of the handmaid's tail.
[01:00:39] We talked about how women are bearing a lot of the cost of Trump administration's policies and the parallelist to season handmaid's health.
[01:00:44] Scott Galloway: That's a central clip.
[01:00:45] Scott Galloway: Old dictatorships do this.
[01:00:47] SPEAKER_01: I can't think of one that has not.
[01:00:50] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes they have nice slogans at the beginning women hold up out of the sky, etc.
[01:00:56] SPEAKER_01: But it doesn't usually play out.
[01:00:59] SPEAKER_01: It sometimes plays out that a select group of women get fairly high profile positions.
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_01: And you can see that in the Trump government.
[01:01:08] SPEAKER_01: There are a number of cabinet people and certainly the White House spokesperson.
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_01: They're all women.
[01:01:15] SPEAKER_01: But that doesn't translate any more than it did with the Duchess's into the lives of ordinary women.
[01:01:23] SPEAKER_01: Anyway, she was great.
[01:01:24] Scott Galloway: She was really interesting and very long interview.
