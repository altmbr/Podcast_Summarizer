[00:00:00] Luca: Remember the stretch levels with working or as-off for three years in the startup which failed.
[00:00:04] Luca: Having this little money to try to make the dream come true.
[00:00:07] Luca: I had a real breakdown.
[00:00:09] Luca: 10 years go by and you look back and you're like,
[00:00:11] Luca: Oh wow, I remember we were making half a million a year now, we're making a billion.
[00:00:14] Luca: There is no shortcut and I've seen nobody try because they just understand it's just too painful.
[00:00:30] Patrick: Luca, this is going to be very fun.
[00:00:32] Patrick: We first met a couple years ago and I've followed the Benning Spoon story ever since with great interest.
[00:00:37] Patrick: For those that don't know about it since we're in Milan today,
[00:00:41] Patrick: to not, you know, in New York City, not everyone yet knows about Benning Spoon soon they will.
[00:00:45] Patrick: Can you just tell us what it is and then we'll go from there?
[00:00:49] Luca: Right. We are a pretty unusual beast.
[00:00:52] Patrick: Yeah, unique almost I think as far as I can tell.
[00:00:56] Luca: I think a good representation will be 25% product equity, 75% tech company,
[00:01:01] Luca: meaning we acquire companies as a key engine of growth,
[00:01:06] Luca: 100% acquisitions, no minorities like.
[00:01:09] Luca: And then unlike a product equity which would typically look to sell them three, five, seven years
[00:01:15] Luca: down the line, we buy off our balance sheet to own and operate forever.
[00:01:19] Luca: And unlike a product equity which typically would make relatively shallow interventions,
[00:01:24] Luca: maybe change the management team, rethink the entire company, try to come up with a vision for
[00:01:31] Luca: the most successful version of that company and then work as hard as we can to close the gap
[00:01:35] Luca: between the sales and that vision and it could be rewrite the software, re-architectic cloud
[00:01:40] Luca: infrastructure, launch lots of features, redesign the UI, optimize monetization and marketing,
[00:01:45] Luca: rebuild big chunks, sometimes the entirety of the organization. So it's very extensive, deep time
[00:01:50] Luca: consuming work, sometimes radical work. And if we do it right, that creates a lot of value,
[00:01:55] Luca: we can reinvest in making our quality of our platform more powerful, so build better proprietary
[00:02:01] Luca: technologies, better access to talent, more knowledge and go after new bigger acquisitions.
[00:02:06] Patrick: Can you say a little bit about the vision you have for the business, not in terms of how big it
[00:02:11] Patrick: will be here, the number of acquisitions or anything, but five years hence I know you care very
[00:02:15] Patrick: deeply about the culture of the people here and kind of what the home office looks like and feels
[00:02:21] Patrick: what you have a huge ambition for what you're building, maybe describe that ambition in that
[00:02:26] Patrick: vision a little bit.
[00:02:33] Luca: We felt inspired at the prospect of building the company being our product,
[00:02:33] Luca: building an institution in a brochure hot away, that sort of company that people look at and think
[00:02:38] Luca: was a defining company of its generation. And so to do that scale is important, I think it's
[00:02:46] Luca: unlikely that you can be in that conversation unless the company is large and dominant, but also
[00:02:50] Luca: there needs to be some level of excellence along certain dimensions where the company really
[00:02:56] Luca: stands out vis-a-vis the others. And for us, it's always been, besides being absolutely
[00:03:02] Luca: exceptional at the functional things like being incredible at running these businesses,
[00:03:06] Luca: one part that we really want to be awesome at is spotting some of the best inexperienced
[00:03:12] Luca: talent in the world and being the ideal place for that talent to just skyrocket toward the
[00:03:18] Luca: maximum realization of their potential as quickly as possible. So we want to be the ultimate
[00:03:23] Luca: testing and training ground for incredibly talented and motivated people. And so the company
[00:03:27] Luca: 5 or 10 years out, I think will still be a conglomerate of very interesting digital technology
[00:03:32] Luca: businesses, hopefully much more and generally the company would be bigger. And I hope we can be
[00:03:37] Luca: much stronger at everything we do and have even higher levels of talent density and hopefully
[00:03:42] Luca: inspire others to try to raise the bar in how they run their businesses. And by the way, we started
[00:03:47] Luca: in Europe, we like the idea that Europe should have. It's fascinating that if you think about most
[00:03:53] Luca: of the very large super successful companies globally, you think about almost entirely US or Chinese
[00:03:59] Luca: companies, historically US now China has more. Europe has very little to offer in that regard,
[00:04:04] Luca: but it's 700 million person continent, very good education. I'm not saying we should have
[00:04:13] Luca: 10 trillion dollar companies, but we don't have a single one pretty much. I think last time I
[00:04:18] Luca: checked. And so we hope we can be part of that movement showing that you can actually build
[00:04:23] Luca: such a company from, I mean, we're an international company with operations in the US too, but we're
[00:04:27] Luca: like the deeper roots, the original roots can be here too. We're not a periphery of the empire.
[00:04:31] Patrick: It was actually Daniel at Spotify who introduced us originally. And obviously he's built one of the
[00:04:37] Patrick: great European origin businesses. Why do you think there are not more of them? Like you're obviously
[00:04:42] Patrick: you're seeking to change this, but there's not that many. What do you think the deep reasons are?
[00:04:46] Luca: I think the main reason is a matter of default. Why does California have so much, has had so much
[00:04:56] Luca: success over the decades? One of the reason is you have seen incredible companies being created and
[00:05:02] Luca: grown in California. You just assume that's where you go and do it, especially as a founder, you
[00:05:09] Luca: don't know much like you are ultimately, at least I was, I think that's true of many founders. You are
[00:05:15] Luca: a passionate, determined, maybe talented, idiot essentially. And so you don't have, you don't know
[00:05:21] Luca: the world enough to actually determine what the ideal location will be. If you even think about it
[00:05:27] Luca: because typically how many times have you heard of founders doing a kind of a location study,
[00:05:32] Luca: where should I start my company? It tends to be kind of momentum like I happen to study here. I
[00:05:37] Luca: know people are there. I should probably just do it. And so a lot of talented Europeans, many of
[00:05:43] Luca: the most talented Europeans who have an entrepreneurial streak, I think they just default to building in the
[00:05:47] Luca: US, which is being fantastic for the US of course. But there is a gap I think. And if we have more
[00:05:57] Luca: virtuous examples of people who have built incredible businesses again, we're seeding Europe. I
[00:06:02] Luca: think more people will not default to that and think I actually actually build such a business
[00:06:08] Luca: from France or Portugal or Italy.
[00:06:13] Patrick: Was that a key part of the original vision that you wanted it to
[00:06:13] Patrick: be a beacon for European talent and to show the world that a company like this could exist here?
[00:06:19] Patrick: And so why? Why did you care so much? Why not just go to California?
[00:06:22] Luca: I mean it's difficult when
[00:06:22] Luca: you talk about what the sense of purpose, what inspires you. I think we can try to rationalize it,
[00:06:28] Luca: but there's something comes from the gut. We just felt that there was a mission there that was
[00:06:33] Luca: worth pursuing and that turned on our drive, our passion. And ultimately we figured we love to
[00:06:40] Luca: build a business because it's we love learning, we love challenge. And I think the business arena
[00:06:45] Luca: is arguably the most competitive field in which you can test yourself of any field, even more
[00:06:50] Luca: than sports academia. So we liked it to start with. Why do we fail in Italy, Denmark, Canada, the US,
[00:06:57] Luca: nobody cares. But if we build something remarkable from a country that doesn't see as many successes,
[00:07:02] Luca: that means something extra. It can be an inspiration like I just said, it can help local businesses aim
[00:07:07] Luca: a little bit higher, raise their standards. It can create competencies locally that can have a
[00:07:13] Luca: positive effect. And so we just chose to do it that way. We don't regret it. But yeah, there were
[00:07:19] Luca: very good arguments for us to maybe start in California for sure. Like that was a very reasonable
[00:07:24] Luca: point to make.
[00:07:24] Patrick: You said this idea of test yourself. If you think back on Benning Spoon's history,
[00:07:30] Patrick: what was the first example of you really testing your own limits?
[00:07:36] Luca: At the very beginning, we actually
[00:07:36] Luca: had another startup called Evertail. And that was a failure. We learned a lot and actually the strategy
[00:07:41] Luca: for Benning Spoon's we came up with it through the failure of Evertail. At the time with Evertail,
[00:07:45] Luca: we raised about a million euros, all in all, and VC money. And ultimately the company was about
[00:07:51] Luca: to go bankrupt. We had about 40,000 euros left. That money belonged to the VC because of
[00:07:58] Luca: liquidation preferences. But it was too little for the size of that fund. And they told us, look,
[00:08:03] Luca: it's just too much hassle and legal costs for us to go through this administrative process of
[00:08:07] Luca: liquidation. You guys worked, you were honest, worked as hard as anyone could demand of you.
[00:08:12] Luca: You keep the money. We'll sell our shares to you for a nominal one-year-old. And you know, go,
[00:08:18] Luca: you probably got something after taxes from it and just go and get a nice vacation. But we're
[00:08:25] Luca: sick in the brain and so rather than going on vacation, we took whatever we could. And that was a
[00:08:29] Luca: seed capital for Benning Spoon's this 2013. And so it wasn't a lot of money for us as you were.
[00:08:35] Luca: We lived all of us lived in the same apartment. Very low burn rate, very low. As low as you get still,
[00:08:41] Luca: 40,000 euros you don't do much. Particularly as our vision was to acquire a company. So that
[00:08:46] Luca: capex intensity, particularly at the beginning, while you can use that because you are nobody and
[00:08:50] Luca: you don't track track or the cache flow. And so we figured we need a source of cache to
[00:08:55] Luca: kind of kickstart our acquisitive strategy. We figured certainly the easiest way is to just write
[00:09:02] Luca: software build products for third parties. We are decent at programming and design. We should be
[00:09:10] Luca: able to do that. It seems like an easy business to start. Maybe not to scale to gigantic
[00:09:14] Luca: just to get to cache. And so especially a co-founder of mine and I spent a good three,
[00:09:21] Luca: four months, like 12, 16 hours a day just emailing anyone on the planet and cold calling people.
[00:09:29] Luca: We offered discounts, we're like just hires to do something. And I swear to God we couldn't get
[00:09:35] Luca: anybody. I mean, not a single soul hired us to do anything. Only contract we got was for about
[00:09:43] Luca: 10,000 euros from essentially a friend of one of my co-founders who I think took Ption Asnes.
[00:09:49] Luca: They are we need an app for our small chain of burger places. You know, we'll give you 10,000
[00:09:53] Luca: euros to build it. So that was an after failure. I remember the stress levels with after
[00:09:59] Luca: working or as off for three years from the startup, which failed. Having this little money to try to
[00:10:04] Luca: make the dream come true and failing miserably at this sales effort. I had a real breakdown.
[00:10:13] Luca: I remember I don't cry much. I cry maybe once a decade. I cried. I had a moment where I cried
[00:10:20] Luca: at that point. I remember I left the office. I just had to cry because I was like goodness,
[00:10:24] Luca: it's been like three and a half or almost four years where we've been working like a hundred hours
[00:10:28] Luca: a week and we have nothing to show for it. So that was a massive challenge to my resilience.
[00:10:34] Luca: And I owe it to one of my co-founders who I think is naturally more optimistic and has better
[00:10:40] Luca: perseverance than I do. Any kind of comforted me and we said okay, at least we're in this together
[00:10:46] Luca: and just keep going. So we did and of course I'm happy we did. That was a pretty low point.
[00:10:52] Patrick: Didn't you have to get a job at McKinsey at some point to fund everybody else?
[00:10:55] Luca: That was the previous startup. It's a cool store. At least I think it's cool. We basically
[00:11:00] Luca: we graduate two friends of mine from Jessica
[00:27:18] Patrick: of other acquisitions and maybe turn into 40 but again similar nature so small product
[00:27:25] Patrick: amateurishly built certainly no you know institutional investors no investors of any sort definitely
[00:27:34] Patrick: no professional management teams typically one person

[00:27:34] Luca: I got that yeah exactly in parallel we also
[00:27:39] Luca: launched a handful of products from scratch again to try to complement learn things come because if
[00:27:46] Luca: you don't acquire almost anything because you've got no money you're also not learning so we were
[00:27:49] Luca: trying to learn hopefully make some revenue we had a couple of mild successes like enough that
[00:27:54] Luca: extended our runway so many small things like that and we kept adding and compounding but slowly
[00:27:59] Luca: but steadily 10 10 10 K turns into 20 K and 40 and 80 and we've been compounding at a pretty fast
[00:28:06] Luca: rate I mean that if you look at our per share revenue or EBITDA growth over the past four years
[00:28:11] Luca: where we are at a decent scale I guess like it's about 1.3 billion this year it's still about 75% per
[00:28:17] Luca: year we're still compounding pretty fast 10 years go by and you look back and you know wow I remember
[00:28:22] Luca: we were making half a million a year now we're making a billion

[00:28:22] Patrick: so in those early days what were the
[00:28:26] Patrick: key lessons that you were learning like what did you start to realize were the right attributes
[00:28:31] Patrick: of an app a piece of software a company that you might acquire what were the what were the things
[00:28:36] Patrick: that you were after

[00:28:36] Luca: it's always been the same things on a high level and that would be number one
[00:28:41] Luca: so far we've always focused on digital technology we haven't bought supermarket chains nor do we plan
[00:28:46] Luca: it because you've got to be I feel we want to stay reasonably within your circle of competence
[00:28:53] Luca: ideally here and there you want to take a step kind of half outside of it you need to kind of
[00:28:57] Luca: keep pushing the boundaries because that will keep your circle expanding as you expand within the
[00:29:02] Luca: circle but but I don't think it would be wise especially as long as the model works well it's
[00:29:08] Luca: efficient to take massive leaps outside of the circle of competence just because so digital
[00:29:13] Luca: technology scale scale is relative but we because our approach is so hands-on so time consuming
[00:29:20] Luca: I mentioned we can sometimes we radically rethink a business or at least several components of it
[00:29:25] Luca: we will do maybe five acquisitions a year could be one could be ten max I mean if it's really a
[00:29:30] Luca: stretch and each some more than others will really go super deep and rethink the details
[00:29:36] Luca: and the time investment and the effort does not scale linearly with revenue so for us to do an
[00:29:40] Luca: acquisition that will bring in half a billion in revenue is not five times as time consuming as
[00:29:46] Luca: one that will bring a hundred million now maybe it's on average a little bit more time consuming
[00:29:49] Luca: because it tends to be more complicated but nowhere near linearly and so we want to do fewer acquisitions
[00:29:54] Luca: but bigger so first core criteria is scale and again at the time 10k looked like a big bet now
[00:29:59] Luca: we feel like it's a lot today we're actually hoping to invest easily a billion plus but conceptually
[00:30:05] Luca: the same thing the second thing is we need to be able to predict the future performance of that
[00:30:08] Luca: business otherwise there's no way we can make a confident investment we've gotten very sophisticated
[00:30:14] Luca: in time with you know statistical models and lots of assumptions and the probability distributions
[00:30:19] Luca: at the essence of it we need to buy stuff where we know where it's going at least you know with
[00:30:24] Luca: sufficient confidence and the last one is we need to believe we can make meaningful substantial
[00:30:29] Luca: improvements to that business now that it's a necessity but it's difficult for us to imagine
[00:30:33] Luca: being able to make an offer that's super exciting for the seller and then being okay this is perfect
[00:30:39] Luca: buy you know like probably they wouldn't sell it to us for that price these are the criteria
[00:30:43] Luca: the criteria and they have remained the same but the level of sophistication our understanding
[00:30:48] Luca: of these criteria over time is I mean it's it's incomparable

[00:30:48] Patrick: maybe we could talk about
[00:30:54] Patrick: Evernote as a great case study because it's a I used to use it all the time it was my like
[00:30:58] Patrick: place of record for keeping my notes and book highlights and all these things and people have
[00:31:01] Patrick: heard of the brand and it it was a big acquisition for you I'm curious what you think of as like
[00:31:05] Patrick: the milestone acquisitions in the history of Bending Spoons but I'd love to dive into that one
[00:31:10] Patrick: especially just to hear an example of like the whole story soup to nuts of how you found it what
[00:31:15] Patrick: you saw what you did how you thought about price what your team did what's happened since

[00:31:15] Luca: I mentioned
[00:31:20] Luca: earlier at the beginning it was all what you could what you would call asset deals individual apps
[00:31:25] Luca: and whatnot and the and then we had a period of maybe three four years where we saw that that very
[00:31:32] Luca: basic small scale model work was going to saturate at some point in the not too distant future we
[00:31:37] Luca: should do this at a bigger scale with structured companies with management teams and large teams
[00:31:42] Luca: with professionals and institutional investors I think we lacked confidence to take the leap
[00:31:46] Luca: immediately and so we started losing a bit of focus and and looking at alternative
[00:31:52] Luca: strategies while taking tentative baby steps into that next level of the same thing really but just
[00:31:58] Luca: yeah I guess it's a bit like I played locally now when I do an international tennis tournament to go
[00:32:04] Luca: back to the tennis metaphor you know will I be able to compete and probably as if you're doing
[00:32:07] Luca: super well locally yeah of course you'll not be the best at that yet but but I think it's you can
[00:32:12] Luca: empathize with there being a little bit of hesitation insecurity right and I think Evernote was the
[00:32:19] Luca: first such company like clearly you know within that definition my guess is that we paid
[00:32:26] Luca: like 50% more than the next best offer so it was really a win-win which is the way I believe you
[00:32:32] Luca: should try to any any good strategy needs to be somewhat win-win otherwise it will not go far
[00:32:37] Luca: we were invited to that process at the time it wasn't something we took for granted because we were
[00:32:42] Luca: not so well known so many times we missed out on process and sale processes that happened and
[00:32:47] Luca: took a look at it I think we were very fast in making a what turned out to be the winning bid
[00:32:51] Luca: and we just saw a very good brand although certainly it's lightly tarnished but still a quarter of a
[00:32:58] Luca: billion people had used Evernote a strong brand an important use case a lot of customers with
[00:33:06] Luca: thousands or tens of thousands of notes using Evernote to run their lives really and the product had
[00:33:11] Luca: not probably kept up with the times as well as you as a customer with a lot of love would like to see
[00:33:18] Luca: and of course you can only realize that fully once you're on the inside and really open the hood
[00:33:25] Luca: and but you can you get a sense of that as a user and so we bid we won it and then yeah we began
[00:33:32] Luca: our usual transformation process on a different scale but essentially a team of some of our best
[00:33:39] Luca: experts functional experts you know growth product design and engineering and going and we met
[00:33:45] Luca: everybody we spent a lot of time with everybody on the team and worked on projects and really got
[00:33:50] Luca: acquainted with the nitty gritty the details of the of the business broadly speaking and then
[00:33:55] Luca: started you know developed a roadmap for how to to make Evernote more successful and got to work and
[00:34:02] Luca: it's it's a completely different business today I think in two and a half years we have released
[00:34:06] Luca: by now probably about 250 significant product improvements it's difficult to be 100%
[00:34:11] Luca: quantitative of product improvements because you know there's no perfect definition but in my
[00:34:15] Luca: in my estimation we have been improving and innovating probably three to five times three to five
[00:34:21] Luca: times faster than before we've been able to do this with a smaller team really working on keeping
[00:34:27] Luca: all the positions that were critical getting rid of projects and initiatives that we thought were
[00:34:30] Luca: tangential and building out adding a lot of value working on talent density the culture of
[00:34:36] Luca: impact orientation and rationality really trying to make sure that what we do moves the needle
[00:34:40] Luca: then it's a lot it's a million things that you you bring in as a business with with our platform
[00:34:45] Luca: but we rebuilt almost entirely the code base the cloud infrastructure there's almost nothing at
[00:34:49] Luca: least nothing of the core components it's now far higher performance notes sync up in less than
[00:34:56] Luca: 10% of the time in some cases one percent of the time

[00:34:56] Patrick: I remember that being a problem when I was
[00:35:02] Patrick: using it that's why I stopped

[00:35:02] Luca: it is super fast you would not tell the difference at all compared to
[00:35:09] Luca: the products you can see you probably consider the best in the broader space like maybe you think
[00:35:14] Luca: Notion is top notch in the broader productivity

[00:35:14] Patrick: yeah

[00:35:14] Luca: I think if you've tried Evernote today you would
[00:35:19] Luca: consider they do different things but the quality of the experience you consider probably on par

[00:35:19] Patrick: yeah
[00:35:25] Patrick: so

[00:35:25] Luca: we had to close a big gap there retention is at an all-time high despite prices being higher
[00:35:32] Luca: because now Evernote is substantially more it varies by country and but it's probably average say 60%
[00:35:38] Luca: more expensive so it's especially more expensive than before but surely retention is better because
[00:35:41] Luca: yeah we did lose say 10% of customers who were already not so sure and once the price goes up I'm out of
[00:35:48] Luca: here yeah but the more engaged loyal customers are still on board and a customer satisfaction by
[00:35:55] Luca: any quantitative metric is better than it's ever been before so we but it was a very time consuming
[00:36:01] Luca: effort not something I think completely beyond what say a private equity could do without having
[00:36:07] Luca: its own R&D team yeah and and having to maybe be ready to sell within a few years and again we
[00:36:14] Luca: can't do a hundred companies each year but we could do three or five or six

[00:36:14] Patrick: how do you know when
[00:36:19] Patrick: there's pricing power like prices are 60 percent higher you've made you made it a better product
[00:36:23] Patrick: so maybe that's why the price can go higher but how do you think about pricing and users
[00:36:28] Patrick: across your universe of of applications that you own

[00:36:28] Luca: it really depends on on each case I'll give
[00:36:35] Luca: you another case that's quite different from Evernote and I would be Meetup Meetup historically
[00:36:40] Luca: you could only use it as an organizer you could only use it if you paid for it we introduced a
[00:36:45] Luca: free tier so you could organize quite we actually do quite a lot for free which it kind of qualifies
[00:36:50] Luca: as a price decrease in a way like we we gave away more for free and we actually increased the price
[00:36:55] Luca: for the more advanced use cases for the truly kind of dedicated based on my observation the room
[00:37:01] Luca: for being more sophisticated about pricing yeah which is different from increasing prices being
[00:37:05] Luca: better at segmentation what's paid what's given away for free personalization communications
[00:37:12] Luca: experiences that ultimately all blend into monetization and the optimization of user LTV
[00:37:18] Luca: our direct experience is that there's a wide range of levels of sophistication in the market
[00:37:24] Luca: I'd like to think Bending Spoons is at the very top of that sophistication spectrum
[00:37:30] Luca: whether that translates into higher prices or lower prices or same prices I don't know
[00:37:35] Luca: but it certainly translates into a very different overall approach to monetization

[00:37:35] Patrick: just as a quick
[00:37:41] Patrick: aside why is it called Bending Spoons

[00:37:41] Luca: so when we started we knew that we weren't going
[00:37:47] Luca: to be a one product company we still wanted the name to connect to something for us a lot of
[00:37:53] Luca: companies are named after somehow after the problem they're trying to solve not all of them
[00:37:58] Luca: but or the problem they're trying to or the product they're trying to deliver and so we figured okay
[00:38:02] Luca: why don't we look for a name that connects to some principles or values that we find
[00:38:07] Luca: inspiring one of my co-founders Matteo is a big fan of the Matrix movie yeah I think he watched
[00:38:14] Luca: the movie that night before I'm not sure but anyway he told us why
[00:54:45] Patrick: more resilient a better feature set and part of it is we've really focused on while these customers needed you know painfully needed that helps you do more with less essentially how do you think about taking capital from a fund that's a 10 year VC fund or something or private equity fund versus a valley gifford that's you know got capital that lasts forever when you're when you're thinking about the right partners

[00:55:08] Luca: all else equal we do prefer a permanent capital and it's not so much because you even permanent capital could ask you to to liquidate yeah it's just that it don't have to yeah anything the fact that it don't have to reduces the probability that you find yourself in a situation where it's it's just an unnatural complicated moment to do it but you still have to do it incentives can be come a little bit perverse we haven't experienced that before but I know stories of others having done that if you know there's an evergreen source of capital I think you're less likely to find yourself in that unpleasant situation however I will add I cite more with investors on these than entrepreneurs well doing away I'm more of an entrepreneur yeah certainly I think a lot of entrepreneurs take take money from investors and have a level of entitlement that they should never be asked to provide a return it's like oh but why do you ask me to sell now it's only be four years five years I think that's either naive or intellectually dishonest regardless of the particular bylaws that investor is subjected to or maybe they could stay forever ultimately an investor is trying to achieve some form of IRR yeah with some time for him so you should remain very respectful of the fact that when you take anybodies money if you ask me about certainly institutional money you can't find it shocking or disappointing or that bitch about it in the entrepreneurs circles that they're asking putting some level pressure we do to sell

[00:56:42] Patrick: you're in such an interesting seat because you're you're both investor and operator and so you have the shared perspective that you you're often buying things as an investor but then running them as an operator if you think across all the investors pure investors that have come and study bending spoons some of them have made equity investments secondary investments etc what distinguishes the best investors that what what do they do that's most different from those that are let's say average

[00:57:08] Luca: I'd say most good investors are they recognize patterns so I've seen a certain business model work and I use that to select their investments if done right this is a very successful investing and then there are the bad investors and the amazing investors none of which is a pattern recognizer so they actually assess each business in an ad hoc manner on its own deep fundamental merit but it's much more difficult and that what that's what divides the truly outlier investors from the bad ones those in the middle maybe even leaning toward good are pattern recognizers but in the truly incredible ones you sit with them and they're not saying oh you are you know the uber of bicycles yeah you're the Berkshire for this they they understand the almost the laws of physics to make a metaphor that makes so that the apple falls yeah and that gives them certainly a lot of confidence but also the ability to see what others don't because ultimately a lot of the time good investment is not determining that something is good like a lot of companies most of us could tell they're good but if everybody or even not quite a lot of people think they're good probably the price embeds that goodness and it's not a great deal it is what it is it's like a lot of companies today in AI again I'm not gonna name names but some probably deserve the the valuation some will easter will prove or even cheap but but most even the good ones are probably too expensive simply because everybody wants to invest so in a way it's the same thing they truly else outstanding investors will be able to find something that's really good but few people think is good and the only way to do that is not to apply pattern because by definition if it were if it fit a pattern then everybody it's either bad by the pattern or good by the pattern everybody is on board it has to not fit the pattern and you have to find ways of determining it's good it's very difficult intellectually it needs creativity imagination lots of logic rationality it cognitively is next level

[00:59:04] Patrick: in that specific effort for bending spoons specifically where have the best investors really dug in to get that that physics understanding of your business that's different than how other things work like we're the best again

[00:59:19] Luca: but since some of the best are I really good at understanding people at this surning was really smart and not promotional from those who are not so smart but very good promoters and so when you see a business as a strong track record and someone explains to you in a way that makes sense it's not just a good story but it makes logical sense that's a huge indication that probably there's something there first of all you now know why things have worked out and you can determine whether they're likely to continue working out and secondly if you're investing in someone who's made good decisions for the right reasons not just out of luck there's just more likely to navigate the future variables that will be thrown at them better than most I know investors who invested for example in Amazon everyday days who told me one particularly who told me that the main reason why he did and he made a big bet on it and it was a huge success was not because he did believe you know in the e-commerce model and all that but he believed that nobody very few people he had ever met had the clarity of thought the rationality of just basis and so a model he believed could you know had legs coupled with a person he thought was a brilliant leader a very bright problem solver that alone set that opportunity apart from a lot of other stuff yes it would be difficult to have wide margins for a long time but it was confident the company would be much better than at least it was it was priced at at the time so so I think understanding people and their cognitive abilities is quite difficult requires in and of itself great cognitive abilities I find that if someone is eight of the tenths smart they can only discern the sevens from the sixes from the fives but the eight and a half the nines the tenths for them look like the same like a big batch of oh they're so smart yeah and so to be able to distinguish the tenths from the nines and the eighths you need to be probably close to and then yourself I know of course of course experience and other elements to which make it very difficult they're not just brilliant for a point of view of logic logic and analysis but also rationality trying to really ignore this person is really pleasant or charismatic yes pocket what's really beneath that it's difficult I mean we assume us have been evolution has made us animals of of of got of emotion but emotion investing they're not good friends I think or at least good investing

[01:01:39] Patrick: another thing that you have to deal with in a unique way is this cocktail of incentives and motivation for different parts of the business you have business units where a team is running an ever-note for example that's different than a spooner that's in the home office that's being moved around and doing lots of different things what if you learned about setting incentives for people to get the outcomes that you want in a fairly complex structure

[01:02:03] Luca: I don't know if this will disappoint you but we don't everybody is paid a fixed salary no variable pay no stock grants nothing they can choose to invest part of their cash pay at a discount not a crazy but a pretty generous discount at the top-core level and that's it the way we maximize alignment of effort is by hiring people we believe our high integrity they have great professional pride and then just treating them with the utmost respect and I think most people will try to do what's right and do what's right for the business along the lines of the Monday to give you gave them so you see ultimately your optimizer for bending spools not ever-node nine out of 10 people if you're hard well in the culture is right will take it to heart and do that in fact I believe sometimes setting financial incentives of course if people do well they they're likely to get more responsibility higher salary it's not that it's certainly there's that but it's not as immediately tied to a you know results next quarter or something very measurable is up through observation in time if you're a great to your job you you probably get more do more but I I think I think that sometimes when you set typically incentive plans with KPIs and what not first of all it's very costly takes a lot of time so for that to be ROI positive it's not enough to add value didn't add more value than the cost that's implied it's absolutely guaranteed to create at least some perverse incentives because nobody can set perfect incentives the board is too complicated it changes too fast for sure so even if you are a genius whatever you set as incentives would be imperfect so there is an additional inefficiency that whatever extra efficiency needs to overcome before it's we're you're even into black territories opposed to red territory I think also those kind of incentives tend to hinder relationships they tend to make things more transactional it's more difficult to have a proper problem solving session where all we're thinking about is how do we win together I think most people will have it in the back of their minds like okay how do I get the better bonus I get it's difficult to be entirely resistant to that feeling and so I'm sure it could be done better but we chose the simple way which is we just try to hire well treat people respectfully and just get rid of all that stuff and assume you'll do the best you can

[01:04:13] Patrick: I'm sure you're always dissatisfied with the state of things and what things to get better all the time what about bending spoons today are you most dissatisfied with

[01:04:23] Luca: yeah I'm that kind of person by the way I'm apparently unhappy which I think sounds awful because in a way I feel I feel very fortunate it's just I feel very fortunate I'm I'm and I'm apparently unhappy which is a huge superpower and a curse of the saint I mean I'm not alone I mean many people in this world I like that what is not good or at least not as good as you could be well one of the things that a critical for our growth is hiring and coaching I am absolutely positive we offer literally you know one of a kind level jobs some of the best in the planet I'm absolutely certain incredible talent and city you learn faster than anyone else anywhere else you get an opportunity to take on responsibility that's crazy most of our general managers run businesses on average 50 100 million in revenue so if there were a scale up they would be considered a large scale up many of these people like 27 28 most of them are I think very few are about 30 so unique opportunities excellent financial opportunities to whether it's very good salaries and investment opportunity in a company that's growing fast I feel very privileged of getting a ton of great applications like I said a huge number I think we should be getting more better we should be better at identifying the raw talent I know we're rejecting a lot of great applicants who are actually better of some of the people we hire because we're just not good enough at spotting that talent in someone who has such a short track record maybe out students you graduate that's an area of massive frustration in a way I'm at the same time very proud of what the team has done there and frustrated we can't yet do better and I know that's one of the the keys to growing fast and achieving what we start to achieve so it's certainly a major area I'm always frustrated with that I think our our society is there's too much regulation we're really working on the wrong stuff as at the institutional level people try to create economic growth and prosperity through more rules just telling you yeah if we tell them exactly where to go with lots of rules surely will be prosperous they don't understand that it's quite the opposite you get you got to get out of the way and create as free and open a playground as you can we keep adding rules even mask one set something that I thought was brilliant and I fully subscribed to it he said we should have a rule that every new law is automatically removed say three years later unless someone can make a really good case that's created a lot of value yeah so we wouldn't have 10,000 page long civil codes or whatever like it to be where it's basically trying to prevent rare corner cases unpleasant sometimes tragic corner cases while making 99.99% of the normal cases less efficient more more painful some utterly impossible but because they're not as newsworthy because they're typically widespread and normal those inefficiencies are not as interesting to talk about we aggregate that just a massive tragedy I much bigger tragedy than the one individual tragedy of one corner case ultimately we cast a regulation the corner case wins and we regulate it away but we make life much worse for everybody else 99% of the time so this for straits me because I think we're just shooting ourselves in the foot of society essentially

[01:07:26] Patrick: what's your balance of time of like what I'll call maintenance hours of the business you know things that are repetitive meetings with teams internal stuff you know keeping the trains running versus space that you create to tinker with the business trying new things stretch that comfort zone that you were talking about earlier I guess the bigger the question behind the question is like what is your weak look like like how do you spend your time

[01:07:54] Luca: well it varies by by period a lot so for example if we are when we close a large transaction most often there with the task force in the trenches meeting the new team and for weeks or even months and times that will take up 50% of my time if we're working on a big fundraise which has raised the largest that round of any private company in Italy in history and like we said we raised 700 million dollars at an 11 billion dollar valuation inequity these two initiatives certainly took a substantial paramount time and when we're not in fundraising mode the dad goes down to a trickle maybe I have some calls with investors but much less so it varies but I would say probably a first plate would be 50% of my time talent I check each candidate before we extend an offer I extend the offer I talk to many of the new hires I help with talent density I help trying to push for being demanding so that's probably 50% of my time 50% of my time is on every time probably financing an external relations I would say 50% of my time is these transformations of companies we newly acquire and 50% of my time would be other colliet long tail platform work which is probably where I would put that thinking creatively about improve the strategy and that work all the time so I probably work as two fts like I think most people in my position would but it's probably these four categories are comparable in investment

[01:09:27] Patrick: what did you learn during this biggest ever debt race most of the people that I talk to for this are raising equity capital I haven't had a lot of conversations with people that have raised lots of debt capital for something like an acquisition so I'm curious about the whole process and how you would compare and contrast equity versus debt capital markets from a raising perspective

[01:09:47] Luca: yeah the mindset is quite different because an equity investor tolerates the risk of losing money vastly better because they have an upside that's essentially uncapped within reason a lender is almost entirely intolerant to the possibility of losing because their upside is that 3% spread 5% spread depending depending on the exact financial instrument it's still a limited and generally fixed upside they have so they it's all about not losing it so a lot of the questions are more oriented toward understanding the potential worst case scenario and the risks equity investors are more oriented toward the 10 how big could this be how quickly could we get there the surprising part is a lot of banks a lot of lenders are actually quite visionary I heard people say well they're probably more boring because they actually know a lot of them are brilliant and and visionary so they're quite curious about the model and where could how far it could go and and understand very quickly white works so I thought I enjoyed my conversations with lenders at least as much as those with equity investors perhaps because they have this they have to be so paranoid about the downside this breeds them a thoroughness a thoughtfulness that's not always the case with equity investors for whom maybe that intuition of all these team this thing could go far is more important like catching the big wins is more important than and so they can be wrong more often so there may be a little bit more they are a bit quicker in their judgment a bit a bit more but but I think lenders are quite an interesting type of investor to talk to and generally it works that you talk to a couple of encore lenders some of the biggest banks typically those with a strong investment banking arm too they help you figure out not kind of shape around they they commit some of the money immediately so you know you've got some of it covered and you know where you're going and then you start bringing under the tent more players with other important roles and then lesser roles and at some point it's quote unquote just providing capital and typically some of these capital is basically it's with that lender it will be a param will say with you until maturity five seven years down the line some of these capital you may want to syndicate so you the lender tells you okay I'll give you a billion dollars but we agree that in the short term we'll be going out to sell away essentially this billion dollar to many providers each with one ten fifty billion each and they'll hold it for for five years or seven years but I'm just giving you a bridge to that moment you need the money now you're doing M&A for example and we don't have time to talk to twenty parties plus it would certainly leak that your mind that target so I help you get there but then we agree contractually that will be transferring that credit for me to this other this other lender so that that phase is also interesting and it's quite optimized because that that markets are huge it's gigantic and vastly more efficient probably than the actually much smaller say VC capital markets and so the the process of how you take that credit from the point of view of a lender and and syndicate it out is super standardized by
[01:22:35] Luca: So many private tech firms ultimately you just need to do well enough that you don't look bad. You're around average and many will die but some even statistically will do well enough. So the barriers to entry are low and so you have a proliferation of wannabes. Some will prove to be great, some will be great out of luck. And so again you have more competition. But trying to build a Bending Spoons, if you understand what you're doing, which is a prerequisite we've never changed, it's dauntingly painful. I mean it takes many years from the ground up cultivating the little garden. There's no shortcut to it. So I think it's just not a model that when people see it, a lot of people have known about it for years, I talk to investors, and I've seen nobody try because they just understand it's just too painful.

[01:23:15] Patrick: I have loved doing this with you. It's so fun to hear you be so transparent about what you've done to build this thing. It's such a unique business in a unique place. It's fun to do it here with you here in Milan. When I do these interviews, I ask everyone the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you?

[01:23:34] Luca: So when I was a little kid I was almost pathologically shy to the point that I was, let's say, diagnosed with autism. I think the diagnosis was not necessarily particularly scientific, but that's to say I was so introverted and shy. I spent years in elementary school talking to nobody pretty much. So I go to middle school in Italy, where middle school is between the age of 10 and 13 I think, and it's the first year. A school year goes by and I have talked to essentially nobody in my class, literally. And we're late in the year, I think it's probably May, and we're on a school trip in the hills, just taking a stroll with our teacher, probably seeing some ruins from some Roman thing. It's a pretty common thing to do in Italy, a bunch of ruins. And all of a sudden two classmates of mine come over, just hug me, and just started talking to me. And they were the two outgoing popular guys in the class. They started talking to me and on the bus they just drag me with them in the back and we start singing. And I'm terrified and happy at the same time because I did want to socialize, I just didn't know how. And they keep investing in this relationship for a long time, and they were 10 or 11, so little kids. Until months later I felt confident in myself and I had turned into a reasonably social person. Not the most social, not the most outgoing, but you wouldn't tell that I had been almost pathologically shy to the point that my mom brought me to a doctor. And I owed it to those two.

[01:25:10] Luca: What I learned during the third and last year of middle school was that one of them got mad at me for something stupid, like a girl kissed me not him, a stupid thing, 12 years old. And it lasted five minutes, but in those five minutes he was furious and he told me, "You remember two years ago when Alberto and I did this and that and helped you and involved you and got you out of your shell? Well we didn't do it because we thought you were cool but because this teacher told us that you needed help." And he did it to hurt me to say that, but actually I'd never felt more grateful in my life. Because it's very difficult if you think about it for someone 10 years old to actually implement that request from a teacher to go with the uncool guy, go through this slog of months where the guy barely talks, inviting him after classes to go to his place to play video games or play football. And they literally changed my life. It's probably the single thing that has ever happened to me that I'm most grateful for.

[01:26:16] Patrick: Incredible closing story. I absolutely love it. Thank you so much for your time.

[01:26:20] Luca: Thank you Patrick, my pleasure.
