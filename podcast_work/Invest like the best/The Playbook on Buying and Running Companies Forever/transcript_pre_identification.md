[00:00:00] Remember the stretch levels with working or as-off for three years in the startup which failed.
[00:00:04] Having this little money to try to make the dream come true.
[00:00:07] I had a real breakdown.
[00:00:09] 10 years go by and you look back and you're like,
[00:00:11] Oh wow, I remember we were making half a million a year now, we're making a billion.
[00:00:14] There is no shortcut and I've seen nobody try because they just understand it's just too painful.
[00:00:30] Luca, this is going to be very fun.
[00:00:32] We first met a couple years ago and I've followed the Benning Spoon story ever since with great interest.
[00:00:37] For those that don't know about it since we're in Milan today,
[00:00:41] to not, you know, in New York City, not everyone yet knows about Benning Spoon soon they will.
[00:00:45] Can you just tell us what it is and then we'll go from there?
[00:00:49] Right. We are a pretty unusual beast.
[00:00:52] Yeah, unique almost I think as far as I can tell.
[00:00:56] I think a good representation will be 25% product equity, 75% tech company,
[00:01:01] meaning we acquire companies as a key engine of growth,
[00:01:06] 100% acquisitions, no minorities like.
[00:01:09] And then unlike a product equity which would typically look to sell them three, five, seven years
[00:01:15] down the line, we buy off our balance sheet to own and operate forever.
[00:01:19] And unlike a product equity which typically would make relatively shallow interventions,
[00:01:24] maybe change the management team, rethink the entire company, try to come up with a vision for
[00:01:31] the most successful version of that company and then work as hard as we can to close the gap
[00:01:35] between the sales and that vision and it could be rewrite the software, re-architectic cloud
[00:01:40] infrastructure, launch lots of features, redesign the UI, optimize monetization and marketing,
[00:01:45] rebuild big chunks, sometimes the entirety of the organization. So it's very extensive, deep time
[00:01:50] consuming work, sometimes radical work. And if we do it right, that creates a lot of value,
[00:01:55] we can reinvest in making our quality of our platform more powerful, so build better proprietary
[00:02:01] technologies, better access to talent, more knowledge and go after new bigger acquisitions.
[00:02:06] Can you say a little bit about the vision you have for the business, not in terms of how big it
[00:02:11] will be here, the number of acquisitions or anything, but five years hence I know you care very
[00:02:15] deeply about the culture of the people here and kind of what the home office looks like and feels
[00:02:21] what you have a huge ambition for what you're building, maybe describe that ambition in that
[00:02:26] vision a little bit. We felt inspired at the prospect of building the company being our product,
[00:02:33] building an institution in a brochure hot away, that sort of company that people look at and think
[00:02:38] was a defining company of its generation. And so to do that scale is important, I think it's
[00:02:46] unlikely that you can be in that conversation unless the company is large and dominant, but also
[00:02:50] there needs to be some level of excellence along certain dimensions where the company really
[00:02:56] stands out vis-a-vis the others. And for us, it's always been, besides being absolutely
[00:03:02] exceptional at the functional things like being incredible at running these businesses,
[00:03:06] one part that we really want to be awesome at is spotting some of the best inexperienced
[00:03:12] talent in the world and being the ideal place for that talent to just skyrocket toward the
[00:03:18] maximum realization of their potential as quickly as possible. So we want to be the ultimate
[00:03:23] testing and training ground for incredibly talented and motivated people. And so the company
[00:03:27] 5 or 10 years out, I think will still be a conglomerate of very interesting digital technology
[00:03:32] businesses, hopefully much more and generally the company would be bigger. And I hope we can be
[00:03:37] much stronger at everything we do and have even higher levels of talent density and hopefully
[00:03:42] inspire others to try to raise the bar in how they run their businesses. And by the way, we started
[00:03:47] in Europe, we like the idea that Europe should have. It's fascinating that if you think about most
[00:03:53] of the very large super successful companies globally, you think about almost entirely US or Chinese
[00:03:59] companies, historically US now China has more. Europe has very little to offer in that regard,
[00:04:04] but it's 700 million person continent, very good education. I'm not saying we should have
[00:04:13] 10 trillion dollar companies, but we don't have a single one pretty much. I think last time I
[00:04:18] checked. And so we hope we can be part of that movement showing that you can actually build
[00:04:23] such a company from, I mean, we're an international company with operations in the US too, but we're
[00:04:27] like the deeper roots, the original roots can be here too. We're not a periphery of the empire.
[00:04:31] It was actually Daniel at Spotify who introduced us originally. And obviously he's built one of the
[00:04:37] great European origin businesses. Why do you think there are not more of them? Like you're obviously
[00:04:42] you're seeking to change this, but there's not that many. What do you think the deep reasons are?
[00:04:46] I think the main reason is a matter of default. Why does California have so much, has had so much
[00:04:56] success over the decades? One of the reason is you have seen incredible companies being created and
[00:05:02] grown in California. You just assume that's where you go and do it, especially as a founder, you
[00:05:09] don't know much like you are ultimately, at least I was, I think that's true of many founders. You are
[00:05:15] a passionate, determined, maybe talented, idiot essentially. And so you don't have, you don't know
[00:05:21] the world enough to actually determine what the ideal location will be. If you even think about it
[00:05:27] because typically how many times have you heard of founders doing a kind of a location study,
[00:05:32] where should I start my company? It tends to be kind of momentum like I happen to study here. I
[00:05:37] know people are there. I should probably just do it. And so a lot of talented Europeans, many of
[00:05:43] the most talented Europeans who have an entrepreneurial streak, I think they just default to building in the
[00:05:47] US, which is being fantastic for the US of course. But there is a gap I think. And if we have more
[00:05:57] virtuous examples of people who have built incredible businesses again, we're seeding Europe. I
[00:06:02] think more people will not default to that and think I actually actually build such a business
[00:06:08] from France or Portugal or Italy. Was that a key part of the original vision that you wanted it to
[00:06:13] be a beacon for European talent and to show the world that a company like this could exist here?
[00:06:19] And so why? Why did you care so much? Why not just go to California? I mean it's difficult when
[00:06:22] you talk about what the sense of purpose, what inspires you. I think we can try to rationalize it,
[00:06:28] but there's something comes from the gut. We just felt that there was a mission there that was
[00:06:33] worth pursuing and that turned on our drive, our passion. And ultimately we figured we love to
[00:06:40] build a business because it's we love learning, we love challenge. And I think the business arena
[00:06:45] is arguably the most competitive field in which you can test yourself of any field, even more
[00:06:50] than sports academia. So we liked it to start with. Why do we fail in Italy, Denmark, Canada, the US,
[00:06:57] nobody cares. But if we build something remarkable from a country that doesn't see as many successes,
[00:07:02] that means something extra. It can be an inspiration like I just said, it can help local businesses aim
[00:07:07] a little bit higher, raise their standards. It can create competencies locally that can have a
[00:07:13] positive effect. And so we just chose to do it that way. We don't regret it. But yeah, there were
[00:07:19] very good arguments for us to maybe start in California for sure. Like that was a very reasonable
[00:07:24] point to make. You said this idea of test yourself. If you think back on Benning Spoon's history,
[00:07:30] what was the first example of you really testing your own limits? At the very beginning, we actually
[00:07:36] had another startup called Evertail. And that was a failure. We learned a lot and actually the strategy
[00:07:41] for Benning Spoon's we came up with it through the failure of Evertail. At the time with Evertail,
[00:07:45] we raised about a million euros, all in all, and VC money. And ultimately the company was about
[00:07:51] to go bankrupt. We had about 40,000 euros left. That money belonged to the VC because of
[00:07:58] liquidation preferences. But it was too little for the size of that fund. And they told us, look,
[00:08:03] it's just too much hassle and legal costs for us to go through this administrative process of
[00:08:07] liquidation. You guys worked, you were honest, worked as hard as anyone could demand of you.
[00:08:12] You keep the money. We'll sell our shares to you for a nominal one-year-old. And you know, go,
[00:08:18] you probably got something after taxes from it and just go and get a nice vacation. But we're
[00:08:25] sick in the brain and so rather than going on vacation, we took whatever we could. And that was a
[00:08:29] seed capital for Benning Spoon's this 2013. And so it wasn't a lot of money for us as you were.
[00:08:35] We lived all of us lived in the same apartment. Very low burn rate, very low. As low as you get still,
[00:08:41] 40,000 euros you don't do much. Particularly as our vision was to acquire a company. So that
[00:08:46] capex intensity, particularly at the beginning, while you can use that because you are nobody and
[00:08:50] you don't track track or the cache flow. And so we figured we need a source of cache to
[00:08:55] kind of kickstart our acquisitive strategy. We figured certainly the easiest way is to just write
[00:09:02] software build products for third parties. We are decent at programming and design. We should be
[00:09:10] able to do that. It seems like an easy business to start. Maybe not to scale to gigantic
[00:09:14] just to get to cache. And so especially a co-founder of mine and I spent a good three,
[00:09:21] four months, like 12, 16 hours a day just emailing anyone on the planet and cold calling people.
[00:09:29] We offered discounts, we're like just hires to do something. And I swear to God we couldn't get
[00:09:35] anybody. I mean, not a single soul hired us to do anything. Only contract we got was for about
[00:09:43] 10,000 euros from essentially a friend of one of my co-founders who I think took Ption Asnes.
[00:09:49] They are we need an app for our small chain of burger places. You know, we'll give you 10,000
[00:09:53] euros to build it. So that was an after failure. I remember the stress levels with after
[00:09:59] working or as off for three years from the startup, which failed. Having this little money to try to
[00:10:04] make the dream come true and failing miserably at this sales effort. I had a real breakdown.
[00:10:13] I remember I don't cry much. I cry maybe once a decade. I cried. I had a moment where I cried
[00:10:20] at that point. I remember I left the office. I just had to cry because I was like goodness,
[00:10:24] it's been like three and a half or almost four years where we've been working like a hundred hours
[00:10:28] a week and we have nothing to show for it. So that was a massive challenge to my resilience.
[00:10:34] And I owe it to one of my co-founders who I think is naturally more optimistic and has better
[00:10:40] perseverance than I do. Any kind of comforted me and we said okay, at least we're in this together
[00:10:46] and just keep going. So we did and of course I'm happy we did. That was a pretty low point.
[00:10:52] Didn't you have to get a job at McKinsey at some point to fund everybody else?
[00:10:55] That was the previous startup. It's a cool store. At least I think it's cool. We basically
[00:11:00] we graduate two friends of mine from Jessica Mateo who are happening to be co-founders that Ben is
[00:11:04] supposed to and we have this idea of building this Evertail company that it was to create a
[00:11:11] self-rising diary of a user's life with AI. This is 2010. So AI was nobody was talking about AI
[00:11:17] in 2010. And interesting you were very early in AI too early in fact because the product just
[00:11:23] didn't work well because you didn't have machine learning at least not in a way that you could scale
[00:11:27] for users. We had no money whatsoever because all of us essentially come from
[00:11:31] pretty low class families whatever you want to call it like we don't have a lot of money.
[00:11:38] As much as we didn't have an idea for a business that would require a billion dollars in
[00:11:42] CapEx like a lot of startups today we certainly needed some money at least to eat and pay for rent.
[00:11:48] So we decided okay the three of us were going to look for a job. Whoever gets the most lucrative
[00:11:52] offer goes to work and pays for rent and food for the other two. Once we raise a seed capital VC
[00:11:59] money some out then this person would resign and join full time and then we go and conquer the
[00:12:04] world. So we all look for a job and I get an offer from McKinsey by our standards at the time
[00:12:11] very lucrative and so I said okay this is perfect I'll be the one paying for rent and food. I was
[00:12:17] terrified that once I told so I'm incapable of not being transparent let alone lying so I had to
[00:12:24] tell the partner and McKinsey that I would be working on this startup on the side. I thought it was
[00:12:29] on wise in many ways because I was absolutely certain that we'd throw the offer but I'm like I
[00:12:32] just can't like I feel dishonest and actually it was enthusiastic and encouraged me and said
[00:12:37] absolutely we'd love to have you and you know if even when the startup takes off you know I wish
[00:12:42] you the best and thank you so I was very grateful I still have a very fond memory of McKinsey
[00:12:48] for that reason like a lot of gratitude and I worked there for about a year then we managed to
[00:12:53] raise initially half a million euros then another half a million later from a VC and I completely
[00:12:59] did my project and I resigned. Willing missed to do anything to get going. I've never heard that
[00:13:04] before one person funds the other two to be building and then you turn them on the weekends. There
[00:13:08] was no contract nothing. I'm a percent just trust which I don't know I just think it's it's
[00:13:14] probably a good way to live life sometimes you get some some some sour moments because of it but
[00:13:19] it makes 99% of it so much more enjoyable if you don't have to be too transactional. And so
[00:13:25] between Evertail and Benning Spoon's what was the where did the insight come from to be sort of
[00:13:30] an M&A driven acquire of businesses rather than building them. Evertail was your startup by the
[00:13:37] book meaning this idea that probably won't work but if it works could be huge and the very
[00:13:42] innovative like nobody had attempted as far as we could tell anything like that before. And so we
[00:13:46] worked super hard on that project for about three years and naturally as you are a startup or
[00:13:52] when you do something I think you tend to network with people in a similar situation for a bunch of
[00:13:57] reasons. And so over time we got to observe probably a couple of those in teams go through similar
[00:14:04] journeys as we did and through that observation we saw that of course most failed which you would
[00:14:09] expect and maybe three or four had levels of success and we saw almost no correlation between
[00:14:15] the teams we considered more more talented and more hardworking and those who came out on top.
[00:14:21] And so we concluded probably I mean it's not a huge sample but probably to go from zero to one
[00:14:28] luck plays a huge role. There are so many factors and variables that if you're a genius and
[00:14:34] you work or ask of you're still likely not to you know the stars will probably not align for you
[00:14:40] anyway. Whereas at the same time we also found that our skills at all the functional things like
[00:14:44] software engineering well AI at the time for what it's worth a product design product management
[00:14:51] marketing although they were still pretty crude three years later they were you know night and day
[00:14:58] relatively when we started we had we were in a clearer path to I'd like to think excellence.
[00:15:04] And so we thought being really good at the functional knowledge and skills necessary to run a
[00:15:09] digital business really well as probably a matter of if you're assuming you're reasonably talented
[00:15:14] a matter of perseverance effort discipline. We know we can bet on that. We don't want to bet our
[00:15:21] entrepreneurial life so I'm getting lucky. So why don't we try to be excellent at the functional
[00:15:26] things and then buy businesses from people who either you know maybe got lucky or they actually
[00:15:31] they're very good but they also the passions changed a change between going from zero to one to
[00:15:36] one to two to ten like it's a different job and so maybe there are very talented people who have
[00:15:40] gotten far they're just a little bit fed up with it they it's not not interested in running the
[00:15:45] next phase of it we should be able to find situations where it's a great deal for both parties because
[00:15:50] of these factors that turned out to be true and now in in hindsight all 12 years later there is a lot
[00:15:56] more to it there are structural advantages in integrating different businesses under the same roof
[00:16:01] but at the time we didn't have that insight which today is probably more important than what I just
[00:16:05] described but what we had identified was enough to drive some level of success for the first maybe
[00:16:12] five or six years I'm going to come back to the beginning and the early acquisitions but since you
[00:16:16] mentioned it now describe what you've learned those advantages are that exist you know and having
[00:16:21] a I'll call it a home office that sits on top of a lot of different business units I'll give you an
[00:16:25] obvious one and two not so obvious ones the obvious one is of course you get to say you you can
[00:16:31] negotiate with a vendor for cloud infrastructure advertising partner better scale so that adds
[00:16:36] probably a couple percentage points in EB-DUM margins it's good it's useful it's not transformative
[00:16:41] but it's it's or you can make an R&D investment in a general purpose technology that many businesses
[00:16:47] can leverage and or although that investment would be prohibitively expensive irrational to make
[00:16:52] for any one of those businesses individually it's actually a very appealing if you can deploy
[00:16:57] it across the two more important ones are at least equally important but I think more important
[00:17:01] ones are one we can move R&D and also marketing resources fluidly across businesses so in my
[00:17:08] experience the R&D opportunity when you run a business is quite fleeting it changes quite
[00:17:13] rapidly over time and so you maybe your new in a certain field or that field evolves and there
[00:17:18] is an opening to expand the feature set upgrade your technology in time that's going to be table stakes
[00:17:25] there's a window when to do that actually yields substantial returns but hiring people coaching
[00:17:31] people training people organizing people is very slow unless you so you really have two choices
[00:17:35] either you do you make it happen in a few months but you're gonna do massive damage to your team
[00:17:40] your culture talent is gonna be low if you're gonna do right it's gonna take years at the same time
[00:17:45] as you go after an R&D opportunity basically you build the features every business has a kind of
[00:17:50] saturation point where there's nothing more at least nothing more very substantial to build
[00:17:55] but then you are stuck with a larger team and of course it's costly emotionally taxing for all
[00:18:00] involved to shrink that team it's difficult and so because of all these factors in my estimation
[00:18:05] most companies are ears behind in terms of the optimal staffing the actual ears behind what they
[00:18:12] should be could they control the people factor perfectly instantaneously some management teams
[00:18:19] are better than others but it's it's really just an inherent inefficiency of a single product model
[00:18:24] but because we can pull at least part of our R&D resources and we really work on hiring people are
[00:18:29] super flexible adaptable with there's a whole batch of things you need to do for this to be feasible
[00:18:33] in pride we can move them very quickly and attack these opportunities and we throw as the
[00:18:37] opportunities are not there in the lamer this makes us super efficient both on the offensive and on
[00:18:41] the defense another major advantage of our model is that take ever note it's a very nice business
[00:18:46] nice product beloved product most people would consider the prospect of working at ever note
[00:18:53] just average appealing like it's a nice probably nice company but it's also not my
[00:18:57] and not as excited as I would be thinking about open AI or you know like the the next big thing
[00:19:03] so on average a business like ever note no matter how charismatic intelligent its leaders are
[00:19:09] will attract somewhat average talent there will be a Gaussian function and some people better
[00:19:14] than others but bend your spoon says a model that's very appealing to people first of all it's
[00:19:19] growing fast so it feels like we're going places yeah you have variety so you know that you can test
[00:19:25] your skills and fine tune and expand your skills at across a variety of challenges and businesses
[00:19:30] and technologies it's more and in a way from the talent attraction perspective much better than
[00:19:34] an ever note stand alone and so all that's been equal we cannot attract stronger talent
[00:19:40] layer on top of that the ability to make massive investments in all the processes knowledge and
[00:19:46] the tools required to attract and and predict talent so we have a massive investment in AI applied
[00:19:52] to predict future performance based on CVs Cabo Ladder test results it's a very expensive investment
[00:19:58] to make it's difficult to justify for a company that maybe only hires 20 people a year smaller
[00:20:02] and we can build on top of that inherent advantage by doing even better on like we're basically we
[00:20:08] have access to better talent plus we'll be better at selecting within that talent pool than most
[00:20:13] companies would so that gives us a major talent edge that's just not attainable for for companies
[00:20:20] for more I'm sure again opening I probably has access to many of the best times but like 99%
[00:20:26] of companies cannot say that and we're better off this year alone this 2025 with almost at the end
[00:20:33] of the year we'll be receiving about 800,000 unique job applications will be hiring 250 people
[00:20:39] wow that's one in 3,000 4,000 super selective and it's not because I'm smart or anything it's just
[00:20:46] inherent advantages of the bending sprues model and of course an employer brand built over a decade
[00:20:50] of investment and people work here saying it's amazing talent is great so you can't shortcut it
[00:20:55] it takes forever but you couldn't as a standalone company even if you had the patience I heard
[00:21:01] somewhere that for a long time on Slack your label was recruiter which is pretty cool
[00:21:06] it's still it's still it's I think it's recruiting is it still there
[00:21:13] you mentioned the idea of building an employer brand for a decade plus talk about those two
[00:21:17] things how they go hand in hand and and what you've done that's been most successful at building
[00:21:22] the employer brand by far talent and city we think about the jobs we offer as our most important
[00:21:28] product so you need to know where your customer is what you're offering how you're
[00:21:33] differentiated and at the core edge of really focusing on that sharply I find a lot of companies
[00:21:39] are almost afraid of someone not liking them some team member getting offended by some practices
[00:21:47] and they are I think they are unappealing in general because they're too vanilla to boring
[00:21:52] they're nothing in a way they're everything and nothing and certainly they're not appealing for
[00:21:56] the you know the most brilliant and driven people who want very clear
[00:22:01] exciseing opportunity so we have focused pretty much from the beginning of getting better over time
[00:22:06] at it on being the ideal place for incredibly talented and hungry determined professionals
[00:22:15] and we try to we we make a promise to them to surround them with incredibly high talent density
[00:22:21] you know I just mentioned how selective we are at the entry point we continue to be selective
[00:22:25] throughout that certainly brings to you know forces us about difficult conversations and our
[00:22:29] moments of stress but overall it's a clear net positive and yes it's a more intense challenging
[00:22:36] workplace but for people who want to be the most you know the best version of themselves professionally
[00:22:43] as quickly as possible it's almost a unique opportunity so that's our customer that's the person
[00:22:50] surround ourselves with why is testing yourself so addictive like what is it about it as a function
[00:22:56] that you and the team so enjoy it's difficult to tell I suspect though it's a common trait of a lot
[00:23:02] of people who have achieved greatness in their vertical I'm thinking for some reason tennis comes
[00:23:09] to mind and when I look at Novak Djokovic Rafanadal I don't know them personally they both
[00:23:15] strike me as people who are absolutely turned on by the idea of testing their limits and pushing
[00:23:20] against those limits and and I don't think they wanted to win for the sake of saying oh I want
[00:23:24] 23 grams grams lamb tournaments they love the idea that I was supposed to be impossible
[00:23:29] and you know why I'm gonna I want to prove it's not it's one of the ways some humans are wired
[00:23:34] but the truth is a lot of human a good enough number of humans is wired that way and those humans
[00:23:39] are those who tend to have breakthroughs excelling their fields whether it's academia sports or
[00:23:45] business and so if you want to if you feel that way yourself if you want to win an excel in an area
[00:23:51] like we want to do with our with our approach that's a kind of person I think you want to start
[00:23:55] on yourself with have you learned anything surprising about yourself or about how the world works
[00:24:01] in all these years of testing yourself one thing I've learned
[00:24:05] um it's caused me a lot of the sanity and and caused me some sleepless nice is that consensus
[00:24:14] is overrated and even dangerous at least when you're trying to achieve something
[00:24:20] are we clear I I don't believe I don't like the model of the you know the bright
[00:24:24] brilliant asshole or anything like that I think you can be you can not be a consensus seeker
[00:24:30] while being a perfectly respectful nice human being I would prefer I think you know that that's
[00:24:35] the model I would espouse but in general if you're striving to stand out in your field if you're
[00:24:44] very concerned about aligning everybody around that particular vision approach not causing anybody
[00:24:50] to dislike you criticize you I think you're absolutely doomed to fail unfortunately I'm naturally
[00:24:56] wired to enjoy consensus I quite struggle with with friction and criticism by nature and I think
[00:25:03] at least personally and certainly my capacity the company that's uh that slowed me down caused me
[00:25:08] some pain that in hindsight was a net unwarranted and you know didn't bring any good to anybody
[00:25:14] time I was feel felt pain and others benefited as a consequence and and instead when you have a
[00:25:20] clear idea you believe that's a right approach and of course you have listened to input with
[00:25:24] intellectual honesty openness so it's not a matter of pride just a matter of intellectual conviction
[00:25:29] that I think being able to just uh accept disagreement pissing some people off and just going very
[00:25:37] you know straight toward that goal is a superpower I at least it took I'm not perfect at that for sure
[00:25:43] but I'm much better today than I was when I started but maybe at least the first seven or eight
[00:25:47] year I years I think I was absolutely terrible at it thankfully artists on the team were better
[00:25:52] and so as usual in a team you complement each other I think a lot of management teams are too worried
[00:25:56] about having eight percentage for example of their of of their team disagreeing with them criticizing
[00:26:02] them instead I think they they should really try to if they believe they have they've got the solution
[00:26:07] the path ahead I think they should be willing to they should be uncompromising in that regard so if
[00:26:12] we rewind time now to the early days where you've got this core insight that zero to one is really hard
[00:26:17] and maybe somewhat random you have this skill set that probably is really valuable and one to end
[00:26:22] and you're going to go acquire businesses and apply the talent and skill set to make the products
[00:26:26] way better bigger faster everything what is the first couple years of that process like like how are
[00:26:33] you looking for companies how do you have enough money I'm sure you must have started small what
[00:26:37] were some of the first acquisitions like talk us through the early lessons and early activity in the
[00:26:41] M&A markets oh yeah I mean the beginning again we had those 40,000 so we were trying to to get
[00:26:48] you know do some consulting like I said which never worked I mean basically brought
[00:26:51] over Avenue pretty much we made the first acquisition I think we closed it within the year so pretty
[00:26:57] quickly and we paid 10,000 for it and it will I don't remember what it was called but it was a
[00:27:04] an iOS app to personalize your keyboard okay ultimately made 20,000 off it like a very good
[00:27:11] return in a short period of time by a tiny scale and then you know that 20 went into a couple
[00:27:18] of other acquisitions and maybe turn into 40 but again similar nature so small product
[00:27:25] amateurishly built certainly no you know institutional investors no investors of any sort definitely
[00:27:34] no professional management teams typically one person I got that yeah exactly in parallel we also
[00:27:39] launched a handful of products from scratch again to try to complement learn things come because if
[00:27:46] you don't acquire almost anything because you've got no money you're also not learning so we were
[00:27:49] trying to learn hopefully make some revenue we had a couple of mile successes like enough that
[00:27:54] extended our runway so many small things like that and we kept adding and compounding but slowly
[00:27:59] but steadily 10 10 10 K turns into 20 K and 40 and 80 and we've been complying a pretty fast
[00:28:06] rate I mean that if you look at our per share revenue or EBDA growth over the past four years
[00:28:11] where we are a decent scale I guess like it's about 1.3 billion this year it's still about 75% per
[00:28:17] year we're still complying pretty fast 10 years go by and you look back and you know wow I remember
[00:28:22] we were making half a million a year now we're making a billion so in those early days what were the
[00:28:26] key lessons that you were learning like what did you start to realize were the right attributes
[00:28:31] of an app a piece of software a company that you might acquire what were the what were the things
[00:28:36] that you were after it's always been the same things on a high level and that would be number one
[00:28:41] so far we've always focused on digital technology we haven't bought supermarket chains nor do we plan
[00:28:46] it because you've got to be I feel we want to stay reasonably within your circle of competence
[00:28:53] ideally here and there you want to take a step kind of half outside of it you need to kind of
[00:28:57] keep pushing the boundaries because that will keep your time expanding as you expand within the
[00:29:02] time but but I don't think it would be wise especially as long as the model is works well it's
[00:29:08] efficient to take massive leaps outside of the circle of competence just because so digital
[00:29:13] technology scale scale is relative but we because our approach is so hands-on so time consuming
[00:29:20] I mentioned we can sometimes we radically rethink a business or at least several components of it
[00:29:25] we will do maybe five acquisitions a year could be one could be ten max I mean if it's really a
[00:29:30] stretch and each some more than others will will really go super deep and rethink the details
[00:29:36] and the time investment and the effort does not scale linearly with revenue so for us to do an
[00:29:40] acquisition that will bring in half a building in revenue is not five times as time consuming as
[00:29:46] one that will bring a hundred million now maybe it's on average a little bit more time consuming
[00:29:49] because it tends to be more complicated but nowhere near linearly and so we want to do fewer acquisitions
[00:29:54] but bigger so first create criteria in scale and again at the time 10k looked like a big bet how do
[00:29:59] we feel like it's a lot today we're actually hoping to invest easily a billion plus but conceptually
[00:30:05] the same thing the second thing is we need to be able to predict the future performance of that
[00:30:08] business otherwise there's no way we can make a confident investment we've gotten very sophisticated
[00:30:14] in times with you know statistical models and lots of assumptions and the probability distributions
[00:30:19] at the essence of it we need to buy stuff where we know where it's going at least you know with
[00:30:24] sufficient confidence and the last one is we need to believe we can make meaningful substantial
[00:30:29] improvements to that business now that it's a necessity but it's difficult for us to imagine
[00:30:33] being able to make an offer that's super exciting for the seller and then being okay this is perfect
[00:30:39] buy you know like probably they wouldn't sell it to us for that price these are the criteria
[00:30:43] the criteria and they have remained the same but the level of sophistication are understanding
[00:30:48] of these criteria over time is I mean it's it's incomparable maybe we could talk about
[00:30:54] evernote as a great case study because it's a I used to use it all the time it was my like
[00:30:58] place of record for keeping my notes and book highlights and all these things and people have
[00:31:01] heard of the brand and it it was a big acquisition for you I'm curious what you think of it's like
[00:31:05] the milestone acquisitions in the history of bending spoons but I'd love to dive into that one
[00:31:10] especially just to hear an example of like the whole story soup to nuts of how you found it what
[00:31:15] you saw what you did how you thought about price what your team did what's happened since I mentioned
[00:31:20] earlier at the beginning it was all what you could what you would call asset deals individual apps
[00:31:25] and whatnot and the and then we had a period of maybe three four years where we saw that that very
[00:31:32] basic small scale model work was going to saturate at some point in the not to distant future we
[00:31:37] should do this at a bigger scale with structure companies with management teams and large teams
[00:31:42] with professionals and social investors I think we lacked confidence to take the leap
[00:31:46] immediately and so we started losing a bit of focus and and looking at alternative
[00:31:52] strategies while taking tentative baby steps into that next level of the same thing really but just
[00:31:58] yeah I guess it's a bit like I played locally now when I do an international tennis tournament to go
[00:32:04] back to the tennis metaphor you know well I'll be able to compete and probably as if you're doing
[00:32:07] super well locally yeah of course you'll not be the best at that yet but but I think it's you can
[00:32:12] empathize with there being a little bit of hesitation and security right and I think ever not was the
[00:32:19] first such company like I'm clearly you know within that definition my guess is that we paid
[00:32:26] like 50% more than the next best offer so it was really a win-win which is the way I believe you
[00:32:32] should try to any any good strategy needs to be somewhat win-win otherwise it will not go far
[00:32:37] we were invited to that process at the time it wasn't something we took for granted because we were
[00:32:42] not so well known so many times we missed out on process and say processes that happened and
[00:32:47] took a look at it I think we were very fast in making a what turned out to be the winning bit
[00:32:51] and we just saw a very good brand although certainly it's lightly tarnished but still a quarter of a
[00:32:58] billion people had used every note a strong brand an important use case a lot of customers with
[00:33:06] thousands or tens of thousands of notes using ever-no to run their lives really and the product had
[00:33:11] not probably kept up with the times as well as you use a customer with a lot of love to see
[00:33:18] and of course you can only realize that fully once you're on the inside and really open the hood
[00:33:25] and but you can you get a sense of that as a user and so we bid we won it and then yeah we began
[00:33:32] our usual transformation process on a different scale but essentially at a team of some of our best
[00:33:39] experts functional experts you know growth product design and engineering and going and we met
[00:33:45] everybody we spent a lot of time with everybody on the team and worked on projects and really got
[00:33:50] acquainted with the needy degree the details of the of the business broadly speaking and then
[00:33:55] started you know developed a roadmap for how to to make ever-no more successful and got to work and
[00:34:02] it's it's a completely different business today I think in two and a half years we have released
[00:34:06] by not probably about 250 significant product improvements it's difficult to be 100%
[00:34:11] quantitative of product improvements because you know there's no perfect definition but my
[00:34:15] in my estimation we have been improving and innovating probably three to five times three to five
[00:34:21] times faster than before we've been able to do this with a smaller team really working on keeping
[00:34:27] all the positions that were critical getting rid of projects and initiatives that we thought were
[00:34:30] tangential and building out adding a lot of value working on talent density the culture of
[00:34:36] impact orientation and rationality really trying to make sure that what we do moves the needy
[00:34:40] then it's a lot it's a million things that you you bring in as a business with with our platform
[00:34:45] but we rebuilt almost entirely the code base the cloud infrastructure there's almost nothing at
[00:34:49] least nothing of the core components it's now far higher performance notes sync up in less than
[00:34:56] 10% of the time in some cases one percent of the time I remember that being a problem when I was
[00:35:02] using it that's why I stopped it is super fast you would not tell the difference at all compared to
[00:35:09] the products you can see you probably consider the best in the broader project like maybe you think
[00:35:14] notion is top notch in the broader productivity yeah I think you've tried ever know today you would
[00:35:19] consider they do different things but the quality of the experience you consider probably on par yeah
[00:35:25] so we had to close a big gap there retention is at an all-time high despite prices being higher
[00:35:32] because now ever not substantially more it varies by country and but it's probably average say 60%
[00:35:38] more expensive so it's especially more expensive than before but surely retention is better because
[00:35:41] yeah we did lose say 10% of customers were already not so sure and once the price goes up I'm out of
[00:35:48] here yeah but only more engaged loyal customers still still in board and a customer satisfaction by
[00:35:55] any quantitative metric is better than it's ever been before so we but it was a very time consuming
[00:36:01] effort not something I think completely beyond what say a private equity could do without having
[00:36:07] its own R&D team yeah and and having to maybe be ready to sell within a few years and again we
[00:36:14] can do it a hundred companies each year but we could do three or five or six how do you know when
[00:36:19] there's pricing power like prices are six percent higher you've made you made it a better product
[00:36:23] so maybe that's why the price can go higher but how do you think about price chart two and users
[00:36:28] across your universe of of applications that you own it really depends on on each case I'll give
[00:36:35] you another case that's quite different from ever note and I would be meet up meet up historically
[00:36:40] you could only use it as an organizer you could only use it if you paid for it we introduced a
[00:36:45] free tier so you could organize quite we actually do quite a lot for free which it kind of qualifies
[00:36:50] as a price decrease in a way like we we gave away more for free and we actually increase the price
[00:36:55] for the more advanced use cases for the truly kind of dedicated based on my observation the room
[00:37:01] for being more sophisticated about pricing yeah which is different from increasing prices being
[00:37:05] better at segmentation what's paid what's given away for free personalization communications
[00:37:12] experiences that ultimately old blend into monetization and the optimization of user LTV
[00:37:18] our direct experience is that there's a wide range of levels of sophistication in the market
[00:37:24] I'd like to think Ben is supposed to be at the very top of that sophistication spectrum
[00:37:30] whether that translates into higher prices or lower prices or same prices I don't know
[00:37:35] but it certainly translates into a very different overall approach to monetization just as a quick
[00:37:41] aside why is it called bending spins so when we started we knew that we want to we weren't going
[00:37:47] to be a one product company we still wanted the name to connect to something for us a lot of
[00:37:53] companies are named after somehow after the problem they're trying to solve their problem all of them
[00:37:58] but or the problem they're trying to or the product they're trying to deliver and so we figured okay
[00:38:02] why don't we look for a name that's not connects to some principles or values that we find
[00:38:07] inspiring one of my co-founders Matteo is a big fan of the matrix movie yeah I think he watched
[00:38:14] the movie that night before I'm not sure but anyway he told us why don't we call why don't we
[00:38:18] call it bending spins you know I watch the movie and there's this little bold guy who
[00:38:24] uh Benz Spoon with his mind and I think it's cool and we initially initially we didn't like it I
[00:38:31] still have a spreadsheet with different names and and Benz Spoon say I think we give it like four
[00:38:37] out of five stars there were a couple others there got more stars the one I remembered in the
[00:38:41] hindsight I thank God we didn't pick it appeal because we we were doing only apps initially now we
[00:38:46] do all sorts of technology and software and so you know app appeal I think it's awful for some reason
[00:38:53] you know the look up from 2013 thought it was brilliant yeah so it got five stars at a five but we
[00:38:58] picked Benz Spoon send the reason why we liked it was it connected to two principle sort of values
[00:39:02] that we they're still very dear to us one is call it the power of the mind the deal of Benz Spoon's
[00:39:08] somehow at least to me inspires this vision of a powerful mind that can do things that appear
[00:39:15] impossible and we're big believers that the you know the human brain has incredible potential if
[00:39:19] you work on it and edit and try to really give it the tools and the second reason why we loved it
[00:39:25] was that even if you have that brain it again it just intuitively feels like to to get to the point
[00:39:31] where it can Benz Spoon's you've probably worked really hard at your craft and we like the idea of
[00:39:38] almost anything in life that has value you got to work at it I think it's true with a family
[00:39:43] romantic relationships your craft is a professional your ability as an athlete I think almost
[00:39:51] anything that's that will really give you satisfaction requires work so it's and plus it was
[00:39:56] kind of a unique name we hadn't heard of any company called the Benz Spoon since we figured it's
[00:40:01] partly memorable let's go for it I love it and I love that and I love that movie so now knowing
[00:40:05] the reference it's great going back to the Everton Red acquisition you mentioned you paid 50%
[00:40:09] more than maybe the next highest bidder how do you know the right price to pay like how do you
[00:40:14] think about pricing assets as you buy bigger and bigger ones we can talk about Vimeo we can talk about
[00:40:19] AOL you know the these bites at the apple are going to get bigger and bigger price matters of course
[00:40:24] you have the ability to do a lot after buying it so maybe that allows you to pay a higher price but
[00:40:28] still I'm sure you want to pay a good fair responsible price how do you think about it one is how do
[00:40:33] you determine your function returns as a function of price paid the second one is how do we
[00:40:41] uh stay disciplined so we will really not pay more than we believe is right based or expected
[00:40:48] returns you know opportunity cost what else we could be doing with that capital and what returns
[00:40:53] so the first one is a matter of sophistication and the second one is a matter of psychology really
[00:40:57] think you know discipline patience and the third one is how well do we negotiate so how efficient
[00:41:03] are we at positioning the ultimate price on that curve because the fastest but stupidest
[00:41:08] approach would be to immediately offer the very most you can pay you know and the opposite of
[00:41:13] offering at ridiculous low price is probably equally stupid so we want to find the right balance
[00:41:18] interestingly actually are much closer to the former we believe it's better to have a reputation
[00:41:23] for someone who offers a very fair price immediately but who's not going to be very willing to
[00:41:27] negotiate much the first one like how do you determine that uh return as a function of price curve
[00:41:35] you've got to be very sophisticated at knowing what you're doing uh having first-party data for
[00:41:40] benchmarking asking the right questions having good models the output of the model is only as good
[00:41:45] as the assumption is put in it assuming at least the model is mathematically sound and we certainly
[00:41:51] have very sophisticated co-horated models and whatnot but main competitors advantages in being
[00:41:55] able to run this business is a lot better I mean it's we don't win because we're good at predictions
[00:41:59] we win because we can run them better so we can offer a good price but it certainly helps it's
[00:42:04] certainly marginally important to to making good predictions and so you want to 12 years of experience
[00:42:09] running many businesses running businesses from the trenches in the details unlike a private equity
[00:42:15] I think teaches you a lot more so you understand why things went a certain way with a certain business
[00:42:20] wiser when you set the assumptions for your next acquisition in a way that I think if you stay
[00:42:23] on the financial layer or kind of or I talk to management every week you think you understand I
[00:42:28] don't think you really do there's a cost to pay it takes time but then on the on the bright side you
[00:42:34] you can you're basically smarter and then predicting the future when you find yourself in a similar
[00:42:38] situation again so we assumption setting is critical for us we have you know many assumptions each
[00:42:42] as a probability distribution and we debate assumptions extensively without ever looking at what the
[00:42:49] model will spit out as a consequence that's forbidden because we think that if you see the P&L
[00:42:53] basically the the business plan as you do it there are also some biases or no it doesn't look
[00:42:59] good enough and you're like oh maybe this is conservative let me put you show we we it's we do not
[00:43:04] look at the output only at the inputs we debate analyze dig for more data once we're happy that
[00:43:09] that's the best we can do at this stage we run a Monte Carlo simulation and then we look at this
[00:43:16] distribution of IRR MPV and that's the truth nobody can say well but you know now that I see
[00:43:21] the thing maybe we were a bit pessimistic with the assumptions no too late I mean this is now the truth
[00:43:26] this is what will guide our negotiation so that's phase one and then you make an offer as I said we
[00:43:31] try to make an offer that's sometimes the maximum world to pay or close to it because we think
[00:43:35] although we could probably get a better deal in the moment if we started lower then we don't want
[00:43:39] to establish a reputation for people you can push around and and get more out of we're more like
[00:43:45] the Warren Buffett model of I'll give you up what I think is actually a very good offer yeah
[00:43:50] and you know I'm okay if I hear no but don't think you can get 25% more out of me just just asking
[00:43:56] and then you've got to be disciplined when they ask for more than you're willing to pay
[00:44:00] you absolutely need to not have fallen in love with that particular business and say okay you know
[00:44:05] what it's not to start to be move on to the next what's your walk away rate like for every AOL
[00:44:10] Vimeo ever note that you buy how many did you want to buy that you ultimately didn't oh well
[00:44:15] we need to define this because we look at actually thousands of businesses each year
[00:44:21] we don't make an offer to thousands of businesses I'd say we probably make an offer to maybe
[00:44:26] yeah maybe twice as many as we buy and you know what we have never lost a bid before there is never
[00:44:32] been a business we made an offer for and someone else got it those we didn't buy were ultimately
[00:44:37] the seller just chose not to sell to anybody so that tells me our offer is a typically super
[00:44:42] competitive that's we probably not very good at negotiating because I think a some level of
[00:44:47] failure rate would indicate a more optimal strategy right I guess you you you you you fail you learn
[00:44:52] you got better can we talk about the history of the financing of the business because like you said
[00:44:56] you've done very little direct equity capital raising before you've done some debt as most of
[00:45:01] this just been build up of free cash flow from earlier businesses until you have enough to buy
[00:45:06] the next thing and just rinse and repeat yeah in short the the most sophisticated version is
[00:45:13] completely true what you just said for the first five years then we started using that pretty
[00:45:21] basic that from commercial banks not very high leverage ratios 3.5 times CB down a good day
[00:45:28] um generally lower trailing EBDA in the last 12 months that helped accelerate before we couldn't
[00:45:38] use that because you need to be having established track record because before they take you
[00:45:43] to the code I would do the same before them since then it's been essentially you know that
[00:45:48] and invested earnings and that we have raised a bunch of equity but mostly to fuel secondary
[00:45:53] transactions because if you're in business for a long time you start to getting to a good scale people
[00:45:58] are are saying okay I invested in this company and I'm talking really just team members because
[00:46:03] from the beginning we enabled people we pay just cash no variable pay of any kind and people can
[00:46:09] choose though to receive some of their cash pay in equity at a discount it's very unusual by the way
[00:46:15] and so in time people have accumulated positions and that equity is worth nothing if there's
[00:46:19] never any liquidity yeah so we started organizing secondary transaction every 18 months one year
[00:46:26] two years we've had maybe five four probably since 2019 as a mostly equity has been raised to
[00:46:34] finance those transactions but occasionally the first capital increase of any significance was in
[00:46:39] 2022 I think so yes we have dilution from capital increases very modest off the top of my head I'd
[00:46:47] say maybe 10% we could also not have done any of those at all we still did them because we figured
[00:46:55] in a couple of cases it helped us get over the hump to close deal with couldn't without that a little
[00:47:00] extra with that we were maxed out but also we figured if we bring in a little bit more in terms of
[00:47:05] high quality international investors that would be helpful credibility far power if we need to go
[00:47:13] after a huge acquisition quickly yeah just optionality yeah but we're generally very cautious in
[00:47:19] we account for dilution I think if you really believe what you're doing you should be should be
[00:47:23] painful to increase your capital days I don't know if it was ever known or some other one we talked
[00:47:28] about ever notes and maybe pick a different one I'm curious for another acquisition whether it's
[00:47:32] we transfer or commute or anything else what's the what's the AI photo sharing one remedy remedy
[00:47:39] which I was just looking at out before we started this morning are there other acquisitions that
[00:47:43] have taught you personally the most about your own process about doing this well let's stand
[00:47:50] out in memory there was one time where let's say we bought a product at the peak of it's called
[00:47:57] a viral moment this is really not applicable to the type of businesses we buy today but at the time
[00:48:02] it was a thing it's many years ago now and and then as soon as we bought it the basically that
[00:48:09] viral wave it was reaching and that reached the peak and and that completely changed we thought
[00:48:14] we had been conservatively completely changed our assumptions and led to drastically inferior returns
[00:48:22] versus what we expected and that taught us to be absolutely paranoid when it comes to the sources
[00:48:28] of user acquisition so basically either we buy a business where almost all the value lies in
[00:48:33] existing customers or users like people okay these have been acquired it's just about now managing
[00:48:38] them as well as possible or if a lot of the value is predicated on substantial additional user
[00:48:45] acquisition or customer acquisition then we need to really clearly understand the drivers of that
[00:48:50] expected acquisition and make sure that these drivers are things we can predict for example we
[00:48:55] can make pretty accurate predictions of word of mouth rate under normal circumstances but not
[00:49:01] under sudden viral moments we don't feel very confident making predictions of the future rates of
[00:49:06] user acquisition through paid advertising for example so that was a big lesson learned another
[00:49:12] one that we learned we actually went after a grinder the LGBTQ plus dating app in 2019 so the app
[00:49:21] was owned by a Chinese firm and the CFUS was forced into sale it was a big bite for us at the time
[00:49:27] we're much smaller it would have quadrupled the company we didn't have an equally substantial
[00:49:35] track record as we do today so we went above and beyond raised the capital almost won the deal
[00:49:44] ultimately we lost it because someone has offered a bit more and we would have offered more
[00:49:49] still but we just had capped out on available sources of funds so that was a failure we worked
[00:49:54] like it took us about nine months of it was my main thing and the main thing for several colleagues
[00:50:01] at the time we were so very small we had an M18 of one person so it really paused our growth
[00:50:10] had we bought it it would have been an incredible acceleration afterward but it taught us to be very
[00:50:16] careful to put all our eggs in one basket and so in hindsight I think we could have still tried to
[00:50:21] get it but maybe not obsessed so much over it considering how unlikely it was to make it happen and
[00:50:25] try to place another few bets so that that year if you look at our growth those couple of years
[00:50:32] it's way slower than almost any other year and that's the key reason like we put all we had into
[00:50:38] making that one thing happen it didn't happen we hadn't done anything else I've done some things
[00:50:43] but nothing that would really move the needle so I'd say we've gotten almost obsessive I've seen
[00:50:48] the world in terms of statistics and with that model of the world act accordingly can you talk
[00:50:54] about AOL a little bit obviously that's a name that literally everyone will have heard of and I'm
[00:50:58] fascinated to hear the story of you acquiring the business so people know AOL as the way to
[00:51:03] reconnect to the internet back in the day in the 90s even the 80s I think actually I think they started
[00:51:08] very you know pioneers at some point AOL was what Google was in the 20 in the 2000s you know I
[00:51:14] was the hot new thing so they had this I guess based I mean outside in it seems like a failed merger
[00:51:20] you know at the time Warner and whatnot and then they had different homes it's actually a very good
[00:51:25] business it lost all the customers that they had to lose over the decades and today it's a
[00:51:30] it's an email inbox and a web portal with the aggregator of news and other content it's a very
[00:51:36] good business with tens of millions of active users very loyal users again there's a lot of
[00:51:39] selection bias people who want a Gmail have at decades to go for example like you know people
[00:51:45] who really love that particular experience they have lots of stuff there although the team is
[00:51:49] on a pretty good job I think at managing this business there's there's you know a next level
[00:51:52] to be unlocked in terms of the publishing the product optimizing the offering optimizing monetization
[00:52:00] it's just a very good business that I think superficially people think oh it's probably a legacy
[00:52:04] old it's probably worth nothing but actually it's a wonderful business and in fact again I
[00:52:08] own name names for a lot of our companies in the broader messaging or email the
[00:52:15] industry or segment and that if you just read the news you would think are doing super well
[00:52:20] and they're much larger but actually if you had access to the user count P&L including in time
[00:52:28] looking at trends they are just not nearly as good like it doesn't even begin to compare
[00:52:32] AOL is actually I believe at top five the fifth most used email inbox in the Western world
[00:52:38] and crazy which is you know it's something I mean it's a pretty competitive category is it Gmail
[00:52:44] no if Google ever wants to divest it we'll be happy to take a look but it's a very it's a very good
[00:52:51] business that will be even better I hope that's in time as we pour our hearts and souls into improving
[00:52:58] faster than one of my mentors who's done a lot of investing and building of of software businesses
[00:53:03] over a long period of time said that one of the ways that he made the most money or was the
[00:53:07] most successful would be that he would enter in product situations where there were 12 things
[00:53:11] going on and there should only be three that there was always is like too much stuff too many
[00:53:15] features too many products in the company have you found that to be true at all that there's
[00:53:20] especially with companies that are a bit older that there's been this creep of stuff that gets added
[00:53:24] that's not necessary is that like a common element of your playbook to take 12 down to three
[00:53:29] I don't know it's necessarily common because not all companies do that but we have seen it
[00:53:34] that it's why true I thought it was a contrarium view but not that I know your friend thinks the same
[00:53:38] maybe not as contrarians I thought it was but yes I think people in general overestimate the value
[00:53:44] of R&D let me qualify they think that generously pouring money into building staff pays pays off
[00:53:52] it's really not true at all what we find is that there's a very small number of things that pay
[00:53:58] off and some and most things are waste of money and while there is an element of you don't know
[00:54:04] before you do it so for sure a lot of it you do for example if you start from what your customers
[00:54:09] need really focus on that rather than maybe what your engineers think is cool or offensive
[00:54:16] visions that are very little to do with the core problems or solving they're probably actually already
[00:54:22] taking big strides in the in a direction of greater efficiency so and by the way it's not just about
[00:54:27] keeping costs more under control but it's also doing the thing that matters better
[00:54:32] ever know today as a lower cost based than before but I promise you if you if you take 10 users at
[00:54:39] random power customers power users nine will tell you that it's actually higher performance
[00:54:45] more resilient a better feature set and part of it is we've really focused on while these customers
[00:54:52] needed you know painfully needed that helps you do more with less essentially how do you think about
[00:54:58] taking capital from a fund that's a 10 year VC fund or something or private equity fund versus
[00:55:04] a valley gifford that's you know got capital that lasts forever when you're when you're thinking
[00:55:08] about the right partners all else equal we do prefer a permanent capital and it's not so much because
[00:55:14] you even permanent capital could ask you to to liquidate yeah it's just that it don't have to
[00:55:19] yeah anything the fact that it don't have to reduces the probability that you find yourself in
[00:55:24] a situation where it's it's just an unnatural complicated moment to do it but you still have to
[00:55:29] do it incentives can be come a little bit perverse we haven't experienced that before but I know
[00:55:36] stories of others having done that if you know there's an evergreen source of capital I think
[00:55:43] you're less likely to find yourself in that unpleasant situation however I will add I cite more
[00:55:48] with investors on these than entrepreneurs well doing away I'm more of an entrepreneur yeah certainly
[00:55:55] I think a lot of entrepreneurs take take money from investors and have a level of
[00:56:00] entitlement that they should never be asked to provide a return it's like oh but why do you ask
[00:56:08] me to sell now it's only be four years five years I think that's either naive or intellectually
[00:56:14] dishonest regardless of the particular bylaws that investor is subjected to or maybe they could
[00:56:19] stay forever ultimately an investor is trying to achieve some form of IRR yeah with some time for
[00:56:26] him so you should remain very respectful of the fact that when you take anybodies money if you
[00:56:31] ask me about certainly institutional money you can't find it shocking or disappointing or that
[00:56:38] bitch about it in the entrepreneurs circles that they're asking putting some level pressure we do
[00:56:42] to sell you're in such an interesting seat because you're you're both investor and operator and so
[00:56:47] you have the shared perspective that you you're often buying things as an investor but then running
[00:56:51] them as an operator if you think across all the investors pure investors that have come and study
[00:56:57] bending spoons some of them have made equity investments secondary investments etc what
[00:57:01] distinguishes the best investors that what what do they do that's most different from those that
[00:57:08] are let's say average I'd say most good investors are they recognize patterns so I've seen a certain
[00:57:15] business model work and I use that to select their investments if done right this is a very
[00:57:21] successful investing and then there are the bad investors and the amazing investors none of
[00:57:27] which is a pattern recognizer so they actually assess each business in an ad hoc manner on its own
[00:57:35] deep fundamental merit but it's much more difficult and that what that's what divides the truly
[00:57:41] outlier investors from the bad ones those in the middle maybe even leaning toward good are
[00:57:47] pattern recognizers but in the truly incredible ones you sit with them and they're not saying oh you
[00:57:53] are you know the uber of bicycles yeah you're the Berkshire for this they they understand the almost
[00:57:59] the laws of physics to make a metaphor that makes so that the apple falls yeah and that gives them
[00:58:06] certainly a lot of confidence but also the ability to see what others don't because ultimately a lot
[00:58:11] of the time good investment is not determining that something is good like a lot of companies most of us
[00:58:19] could tell they're good but if everybody or even not quite a lot of people think they're good probably
[00:58:23] the price embeds that goodness and it's not a great deal it is what it is it's like a lot of
[00:58:28] companies today in AI again I'm not gonna name names but some probably deserve the the
[00:58:32] the valuation some will easter will prove or even cheap but but most even the good ones are probably
[00:58:37] too expensive simply because everybody wants to invest so in a way it's the same thing they truly
[00:58:41] else outstanding investors will be able to find something that's really good but few people think
[00:58:45] is good and the only way to do that is not to apply pattern because by definition if it were if
[00:58:49] it fit a pattern then everybody it's either bad by the pattern or good by the pattern everybody is
[00:58:54] on board it has to not fit the pattern and you have to find ways of determining it's good it's very
[00:58:58] difficult intellectually it needs creativity imagination lots of logic rationality it
[00:59:04] cognitively is next level in that specific effort for bending spoons specifically
[00:59:10] where have the best investors really dug in to get that that physics understanding
[00:59:16] of your business that's different than how other things work like we're the best again
[00:59:19] but since some of the best are I really good at understanding people at this
[00:59:24] surning was really smart and not promotional from those who are not so smart but very good
[00:59:31] promoters and so when you see a business as a strong track record and someone explains to you in a
[00:59:36] way that makes sense it's not just a good story but it makes logical sense that's a huge indication
[00:59:41] that probably there's something there first of all you now know why things have worked out and you
[00:59:47] can determine whether they're likely to continue working out and secondly if you're investing in
[00:59:50] someone who's made good decisions for the right reasons not just out of luck there's just more
[00:59:54] likely to navigate the future variables that will be thrown at them better than most I know investors
[01:00:00] who invested for example in Amazon everyday days who told me one particularly who told me that
[01:00:04] the main reason why he did and he made a big bet on it and it was a huge success was not because he
[01:00:11] did believe you know in the e-commerce model and all that but he believed that nobody very few
[01:00:16] people he had ever met had the clarity of thought the rationality of just basis and so a model
[01:00:22] he believed could you know had legs coupled with a person he thought was a brilliant leader a very
[01:00:28] bright problem solver that alone set that opportunity apart from a lot of other stuff yes it would
[01:00:34] be difficult to have wide margins for a long time but it was confident the company would be much
[01:00:40] better than at least it was it was priced at at the time so so I think understanding people and
[01:00:46] their cognitive abilities is quite difficult requires in and of itself great cognitive abilities I
[01:00:51] find that if someone is eight of the tenths smart they can only discern the sevens from the sixes
[01:00:58] from the fives but the eight and a half the nines the tenths for them look like the same like a big
[01:01:02] batch of oh they're so smart yeah and so to be able to distinguish the tenths from the nines and
[01:01:07] the eighths you need to be probably close to and then yourself I know of course of course experience
[01:01:11] and other elements to which make it very difficult they're not just brilliant for a point of view
[01:01:15] of logic logic and analysis but also rationality trying to really ignore this person is really pleasant
[01:01:23] or charismatic yes pocket what's really beneath that it's difficult I mean we assume us have been
[01:01:30] evolution has made us animals of of of got of emotion but emotion investing they're not good friends
[01:01:39] I think or at least good investing another thing that you have to deal with in a unique way is this
[01:01:44] cocktail of incentives and motivation for different parts of the business you have business
[01:01:48] units where a team is running an ever-node for example that's different than a spooner that's in
[01:01:52] the home office that's being moved around and doing lots of different things what if you learned
[01:01:56] about setting incentives for people to get the outcomes that you want in a fairly complex structure
[01:02:03] I don't know if this will disappoint you but we don't everybody is paid a fixed salary no variable
[01:02:11] pay no stock grants nothing they can choose to invest part of their cash pay at a discount not
[01:02:17] a crazy but a pretty generous discount at the top-core level and that's it the way we maximize
[01:02:24] alignment of effort is by hiring people we believe our high integrity they have great professional
[01:02:28] pride and then just treating them with the utmost respect and I think most people will try to do
[01:02:33] what's right and do what's right for the business along the lines of the Monday to give you gave
[01:02:38] them so you see ultimately your optimizer for bending spools not ever-node nine out of 10 people
[01:02:43] if you're hard well in the culture is right will take it to heart and do that in fact I believe
[01:02:48] sometimes setting financial incentives of course if people do well they they're likely to get
[01:02:52] more responsibility higher salary it's not that it's certainly there's that but it's not as
[01:02:57] immediately tied to a you know results next quarter or something very measurable is up
[01:03:03] through observation in time if you're a great to your job you you probably get more do more but I
[01:03:08] I think I think that sometimes when you set typically incentive plans with KPIs and what not
[01:03:13] first of all it's very costly takes a lot of time so for that to be ROI positive it's not enough
[01:03:19] to add value didn't add more value than the cost that's implied it's absolutely guaranteed
[01:03:24] to create at least some perverse incentives because nobody can set perfect incentives the
[01:03:28] board is too complicated it changes too fast for sure so even if you are a genius whatever you
[01:03:35] set as incentives would be imperfect so there is an additional inefficiency that whatever extra
[01:03:39] efficiency needs to overcome before it's we're you're even into black territories opposed to red
[01:03:45] territory I think also those kind of incentives tend to hinder relationships they tend to make
[01:03:51] things more transactional it's more difficult to have a proper problem solving session where all
[01:03:55] we're thinking about is how do we win together I think most people will have it in the back of their
[01:04:00] minds like okay how do I get the better bonus I get it's difficult to be entirely resistant to
[01:04:04] that feeling and so I'm sure it could be done better but we chose the simple way which is we
[01:04:08] just try to hire well treat people respectfully and just get rid of all that stuff and assume you'll
[01:04:13] do the best you can I'm sure you're always dissatisfied with the state of things and what things
[01:04:17] to get better all the time what about bending spoons today are you most dissatisfied with yeah I'm
[01:04:23] that kind of person by the way I'm apparently unhappy which I think sounds awful because in a way
[01:04:28] I feel I feel very fortunate it's just I feel very fortunate I'm I'm and I'm apparently unhappy which
[01:04:34] is a huge superpower and a curse of the saint I mean I'm not alone I mean many people in this
[01:04:40] world I like that what is not good or at least not as good as you could be well one of the things that
[01:04:46] a critical for our growth is hiring and coaching I am absolutely positive we offer literally you know
[01:04:54] one of a kind level jobs some of the best in the planet I'm absolutely certain incredible talent
[01:04:59] and city you learn faster than anyone else anywhere else you get an opportunity to take on
[01:05:03] responsibility that's crazy most of our general managers run businesses on average 50 100 million
[01:05:08] in revenue so if there were a scale up they would be considered a large scale up many of these people
[01:05:13] like 27 28 most of them are I think very few are about 30 so unique opportunities excellent financial
[01:05:21] opportunities to whether it's very good salaries and investment opportunity in a company that's
[01:05:26] growing fast I feel very privileged of getting a ton of great applications like I said a huge
[01:05:30] number I think we should be getting more better we should be better at identifying the raw talent
[01:05:36] I know we're rejecting a lot of great applicants who are actually better of some of the people
[01:05:40] we hire because we're just not good enough at spotting that talent in someone who has such a short
[01:05:45] track record maybe out students you graduate that's an area of massive frustration in a way I'm
[01:05:50] at the same time very proud of what the team has done there and frustrated we can't yet do better
[01:05:54] and I know that's one of the the keys to growing fast and achieving what we start to achieve
[01:06:01] so it's certainly a major area I'm always frustrated with that I think our our society is there's
[01:06:07] too much regulation we're really working on the wrong stuff as at the institutional level
[01:06:11] people try to create economic growth and prosperity through more rules just telling you yeah if
[01:06:16] we tell them exactly where to go with lots of rules surely will be prosperous they don't understand
[01:06:21] that it's quite the opposite you get you got to get out of the way and create as free and open a
[01:06:26] playground as you can we keep adding rules even mask one set something that I thought was brilliant
[01:06:32] and I fully subscribed to it he said we should have a rule that every new law is automatically
[01:06:38] removed say three years later unless someone can make a really good case that's created a lot of
[01:06:43] value yeah so we wouldn't have 10,000 page long civil codes or whatever like it to be where it's
[01:06:49] basically trying to prevent rare corner cases unpleasant sometimes tragic corner cases while
[01:06:56] making 99.99% of the normal cases less efficient more more painful some utterly impossible
[01:07:04] but because they're not as newsworthy because they're typically widespread and normal those
[01:07:10] inefficiencies are not as interesting to talk about we aggregate that just a massive tragedy I
[01:07:15] much bigger tragedy than the one individual tragedy of one corner case ultimately we cast a
[01:07:20] regulation the corner case wins and we regulate it away but we make life much worse for everybody else
[01:07:26] 99% of the time so this for straights me because I think we're just shooting ourselves in the
[01:07:31] foot of society essentially what's your balance of time of like what I'll call maintenance hours of
[01:07:36] the business you know things that are repetitive meetings with teams internal stuff you know keeping
[01:07:40] the trains running versus space that you create to tinker with the business trying new things stretch
[01:07:46] that comfort zone that you were talking about earlier I guess the bigger the question behind the
[01:07:50] question is like what is your weak look like like how do you spend your time well it varies by
[01:07:54] by period a lot so for example if we are when we close a large transaction most often there with
[01:08:01] the task force in the trenches meeting the new team and for weeks or even months and times that
[01:08:07] will take up 50% of my time if we're working on a big fundraise which has raised the largest
[01:08:13] that round of any private company in Italy in history and like we said we raised 700 million
[01:08:19] dollars at an 11 billion dollar valuation inequity these two initiatives certainly took a
[01:08:27] substantial paramount time and when we're not in fundraising mode the dad goes down to a trickle
[01:08:32] maybe I have some calls with investors but much less so it varies but I would say probably
[01:08:39] a first plate would be 50% of my time talent I check each candidate before we extend an offer I
[01:08:47] extend the offer I talk to many of the new hires I help with talent density I help trying to push
[01:08:54] for being demanding so that's probably 50% of my time 50% of my time is on every time probably
[01:09:01] financing an external relations I would say 50% of my time is these transformations of companies
[01:09:08] we newly acquire and 50% of my time would be other colliet long tail platform work which is probably
[01:09:15] where I would put that thinking creatively about improve the strategy and that work all the time
[01:09:21] so I probably work as two fts like I think most people in my position would but it's probably
[01:09:27] these four categories are comparable in investment what did you learn during this biggest ever debt
[01:09:32] race most of the people that I talk to for this are raising equity capital I haven't had a lot of
[01:09:37] conversations with people that have raised lots of debt capital for something like an acquisition so
[01:09:42] I'm curious about the whole process and how you would compare and contrast equity versus debt
[01:09:47] capital markets from a raising perspective yeah the mindset is quite different because an equity
[01:09:51] investor tolerates the risk of losing money vastly better because they have an upside that's
[01:09:58] essentially uncapped within reason a lender is almost entirely intolerant to the possibility of
[01:10:05] losing because their upside is that 3% spread 5% spread depending depending on the exact
[01:10:12] financial instrument it's still a limited and generally fixed upside they have so they it's all
[01:10:18] about not losing it so a lot of the questions are more oriented toward understanding the potential
[01:10:24] worst case scenario and the risks equity investors are more oriented toward the 10 how big could
[01:10:30] this be how quickly could we get there the surprising part is a lot of banks a lot of lenders are
[01:10:35] actually quite visionary I heard people say well they're probably more boring because they actually
[01:10:39] know a lot of them are brilliant and and visionary so they're quite curious about the model and where
[01:10:45] could how far it could go and and understand very quickly white works so I thought I enjoyed my
[01:10:52] conversations with lenders at least as much as those with equity investors perhaps because they
[01:10:58] have this they have to be so paranoid about the downside this breeds them a thoroughness a
[01:11:04] thoughtfulness that's not always the case with equity investors for whom maybe that intuition of
[01:11:09] all these team this thing could go far is more important like catching the big wins is more
[01:11:14] important than and so they can be wrong more often so there may be a little bit more
[01:11:18] they are a bit quicker in their judgment a bit a bit more but but I think lenders are quite an
[01:11:22] interesting type of investor to talk to and generally it works that you talk to a couple of
[01:11:27] encore lenders some of the biggest banks typically those with a strong investment banking arm too
[01:11:34] they help you figure out not kind of shape around they they commit some of the money immediately so
[01:11:41] you know you've got some of it covered and you know where you're going and then you start bringing
[01:11:46] under the tent more players with other important roles and then lesser roles and at some point it's
[01:11:51] quote unquote just providing capital and typically some of these capital is basically it's with that
[01:11:57] lender it will be a param will say with you until maturity five seven years down the line some
[01:12:03] of these capital you may want to syndicate so you the lender tells you okay I'll give you a billion
[01:12:08] dollars but we agree that in the short term we'll be going out to sell away essentially this
[01:12:14] billion dollar to many providers each with one ten fifty billion each and they'll hold it for
[01:12:21] for five years or seven years but I'm just giving you a bridge to that moment you need the money
[01:12:24] now you're doing M&A for example and we don't have time to talk to twenty parties plus it would
[01:12:29] certainly leak that your mind that target so I help you get there but then we agree contractually
[01:12:33] that will be transferring that credit for me to this other this other lender so that that phase
[01:12:39] is also interesting and it's quite optimized because that that markets are huge it's gigantic and
[01:12:45] vastly more efficient probably than the actually much smaller say VC capital markets and so
[01:12:52] the the process of how you take that credit from the point of view of a lender and and syndicate
[01:12:57] it out is super standardized by now you can create a deck you record a presentation it's
[01:13:03] distributed yeah yeah you shop for one hour maybe three times with batches of lenders like it's
[01:13:09] super super standardized very efficient I'm so curious what you think about what I would call
[01:13:14] almost like a religious debate right now in the world of software which is how AI will affect
[01:13:20] the sorts of businesses that you've bought historically will it enhance them will it hurt them
[01:13:25] because it's easier to create replicas or copies or new versions we talked about revenue earlier
[01:13:31] which is an app that you bought before Chatchy BTO that I'm sure has benefited tremendously from
[01:13:36] from the advent of AI how does this new tidal wave of technology impact your old businesses how
[01:13:43] you think about new businesses just you're taken on it in general yeah it's a complex discussion and
[01:13:48] I think you're asking maybe a time frame of five years because AI changes the very fabric of our
[01:13:54] society 50 years out or something like a long time frame in ways that are both exciting and
[01:14:00] scary but in the medium term I think for many sports specifically I think it's mostly good thing
[01:14:05] because we don't care too much about the risk to each individual piece of our business basically
[01:14:10] most of our business units are 20% of our revenue or less so even a dramatic decrease in one of them
[01:14:16] is still in the classical things kind of a minor percentage yeah we've been growing at 75%
[01:14:22] a year you know like I'd rather not have them decline but some do some will maybe one or two will
[01:14:27] decline fast it's undesirable but not existential so for our model it's highly diversified a lot of
[01:14:33] what we do is being better functionally better at running this company meaning having a higher quality
[01:14:40] output at lower cost across the functions engineering design product growth AI is an accelerator
[01:14:47] of both quality and efficiency if used properly but it doesn't do it by itself maybe it will in
[01:14:53] 10 years but today we've seen it clearly as we have invested internally in excellence through AI
[01:14:58] in our operations a lot of it is custom integrations proprietary technology a lot of culture work on
[01:15:06] getting people to use it the right way so like with every innovation in the past we'll see a small
[01:15:10] percentage of companies being at the forefront of leveraging that most companies being laggards
[01:15:16] and I'm pretty confident Ben is supposed to be at the very cutting edge of using it and we're already
[01:15:20] making strides there that if anything will the gap in an ability between us and most companies
[01:15:28] will even what widen for four years but again I think it's likely to mostly benefit an aggregator
[01:15:35] and constiple data like Ben is supposed assuming we stay disciplined with pricing while being
[01:15:40] very disruptive for certain verticals and some will be disrupted much earlier so I think we as a
[01:15:46] society and investment community will be able to start seeing things and an update our model of
[01:15:51] reality and predictions based on that can it be disruptive for many SaaS businesses absolutely I
[01:15:57] think the time where we open up chat GPTN we tell it okay build me Gira or as far away yeah as far
[01:16:05] I like it's not months away it's not even a couple of years away AI today can't do a lot for you
[01:16:10] beyond say research copywriting and maybe some basic kind of production but it'll do more and more
[01:16:15] and fast like I said before we were working with AI in 2010 so we're very early I'm a big believer in
[01:16:20] AI very big however even if it could build Gira today it's not that easy to explain to it what you
[01:16:26] want when it's so complex so I would not underestimate the inability of the of the user to get out
[01:16:33] of it what they need these products being honed to customer needs for a long time you're already
[01:16:40] using them there is you know an investment in them in terms of data so not only does the tool
[01:16:46] need to get to a point where we can replicate that and with the same guarantee of performance
[01:16:50] very difficult like getting to something that works the same 95% of the time still like we're
[01:16:55] super far from it but that's an infinitely easier challenge than something that works essentially
[01:17:00] on a present time infinitely easier but also you need to be able to guide it to build it the way
[01:17:05] and as long as software is ultimately a relatively small share of wallet like if you think about it
[01:17:11] it's not an expense people will optimize first it's not like a car that literally you plan your
[01:17:16] finances finances around before that truly eats into the overall size of the market I think we're
[01:17:23] talking a lot of stars need to align I think it's probably many ourselves you mentioned earlier that
[01:17:28] ultimately your main product is your company and the people that work here are the key people to
[01:17:32] attract the jobs or products themselves what are some of your favorite ways of making sure once
[01:17:38] you get these amazing people we talked a lot about data science and recruiting and the pipeline
[01:17:42] and the crazy number of applicants and so on once they're here making sure that they get the most
[01:17:47] out of it and you get the most out of them which is a mutually beneficial one of the sorts of
[01:17:51] traditions and things that you do that you think have most contributed to it being the kind of place
[01:17:56] you want to work ultimately most important things to be very clear and what kind of company want to
[01:18:00] be your principal your values and then hire people who embrace those and and then you yourself
[01:18:09] as a person who's maybe more visible than others try as hard as you can to be the best
[01:18:13] paradigm of those values as you can be because that that's most more important than any
[01:18:17] you know manifesto or initiative or big proclamation there are certainly things you can do that
[01:18:25] help on the margins help foster those values a little bit further a few things we do that are
[01:18:30] I think our unusual where we love are one is called state of the spoon so I say here we have some
[01:18:37] of the equivalent of an apple keynote but it's just internal and most of our teams take turns on
[01:18:44] stage presenting their most proud achievement and also failures and lessons learned of the past
[01:18:50] six months what they're planning for the future and it's always there is an element of comedy and
[01:18:56] self-deprecation which makes it I think quite entertaining you laugh a lot I always it's like three
[01:19:02] four hours and at the end of it I have like my my jaw is painful because I laugh too much it's just
[01:19:07] fun the we're gonna have all sorts of kind of almost cabarei things and it's a great tradition and
[01:19:13] it just helps us it'll be proud of the things you do well remember not to take ourselves too seriously
[01:19:19] we're not saving lives you you meet and learn about colleagues you maybe hadn't necessarily been
[01:19:26] close to before and another one we do is a yearly retreat where we bring everybody to a remote
[01:19:35] exciting typically exotic destination for seven eight nine days on the company's time and time
[01:19:41] just a vacation but with colleagues the last one so I don't remember in which order what we went to
[01:19:46] say shells more issues that I mean it can republic in the past we went to Japan or straight we think
[01:19:50] it helps establish a level of trust bonds with colleagues and ultimately a company as people
[01:19:56] so if you're if you bond with colleagues or bonding with the abstract concept of the of the company
[01:20:00] to an extent it's not the same thing it's not enough but it's part of it um we believe that it pays
[01:20:06] dividends in terms of again uh we'll lose to sacrifice to be honest about problems to do your best
[01:20:14] why do you think there are not more bending sprints i mean it's kind of like asking why are
[01:20:18] they're not more birchers like there's only one buffet um but why do you think there haven't been more
[01:20:23] people that have taken advantage of this ecosystem this huge tam of companies that are more mature
[01:20:27] now that are you can acquire that have installed user bases and low growth lower growth there's
[01:20:32] all is a first uh private equity wasn't a thing until it was a thing and today you have
[01:20:37] truly lots of dollars in private equity so someone try you could have done private equity before
[01:20:42] kkr did private equity nothing prevented you from doing private equity in the 1930s but to my
[01:20:48] knowledge nobody was doing private equity so at some point someone come up and comes up with an idea
[01:20:52] it makes sense it's efficient it works others flock to compete sometimes that ruins the opportunity
[01:20:59] regardless you have a market um this may be the case we'll see i think we have far superior
[01:21:06] competitive advantage advantage than a private equity because essentially a private equity
[01:21:11] everything every acquisition is as almost a we start a fresh in a way in our case we do well because
[01:21:18] of the platform and the structure and so you would it would take many years for someone to build
[01:21:23] the employer brand the talent pool the culture the technologies to get to really compete so i'm
[01:21:29] actually not at all which is one of the reasons why you see me being pretty transparent about some
[01:21:33] of the principles because i i think i thought about it and i figured if if i started over knowing all i
[01:21:39] do which i knew someone else typically wouldn't at all but also because what i say here yeah it's the
[01:21:44] tip of the iceberg but then from there to actually today to make it work but but even if i if i
[01:21:50] started over with all i know and even if someone said oh i trust you do super well here's a billion
[01:21:54] dollars to get to where we are now say 12 years after the foundation of bendisprus it would take me
[01:22:00] maybe not 12 years but easily seven or eight like it's a huge slog you hired two people you spent
[01:22:05] a year coaching them and then you hire four and they coach them and you help you
[01:22:10] and you build the technologies slowly you know it takes time to write software and polish it but
[01:22:14] presumably more will try i would say that's to be expected and it's being painful again a private
[01:22:22] tech which is very difficult but if you're bright you understand business finding someone who will
[01:22:26] give you you know not a hundred billion dollars that's the best of the best over a decade but
[01:22:31] enough that's that you can have a business and it's worth trying is not that difficult there's
[01:22:35] so many private tech reforms ultimately you just need to do well enough that you don't look bad like
[01:22:39] you're around average and many will die but some even statistically will do well enough so it's
[01:22:44] the very first century are low and so you have a proliferation out of proliferation of
[01:22:49] wannabees some will prove to be great some will be great out of luck and so again you have more
[01:22:53] competition but trying to build a bendisprus is if you understand what you're doing which is a
[01:22:58] perexecutive prerequisite we've never changed it's dauntingly painful i mean i gain many years
[01:23:04] from the ground up cultivating the little garden there's no shortcut to it so i think it's just not
[01:23:09] a model that when people see it a lot of people have known about it for years as a talk to investors
[01:23:15] and i've seen nobody try because they just understand it's just too painful i have loved doing this
[01:23:21] with you it's so fun to hear you be so transparent about what you've done to build this thing it's
[01:23:25] such a unique business in a unique place it's fun to do it here with you here in Milan when i do
[01:23:30] these interviews i ask everyone the same traditional closing question what is the kindest thing
[01:23:34] that anyone's ever done for you so when i was a little kid i i was almost pathologically shy to
[01:23:41] the point that i was let's say diagnosed with autism i think the diagnosis was not necessarily
[01:23:47] particularly scientific but that's to say i was so introverted and shy i spent years in
[01:23:53] elementary school talking to nobody pretty much so i go to middle school in Italy where middle
[01:23:57] school between the age of 10 and 13 i think and it's the first year a school year goes by and i
[01:24:03] have talked essentially nobody in my class literally and we're late in the year i think it's probably
[01:24:08] May and we're we're on a school trip in the hills just taking us troll with our teacher and
[01:24:17] probably seeing some ruins from some roman thing it's pretty common thing to do in Italy a bunch of
[01:24:22] ruins and all of a sudden two classmates of mine come over just hug me and and this just started
[01:24:30] and they were the two outgoing popular guys in the class it's just talking to me and they on the
[01:24:37] bus they just drag me with them in in in the back and we start singing and i'm terrified and happy
[01:24:42] at the same time because i did want to socialize is i just i just i didn't know how and they keep
[01:24:47] investing in this relationship for a long time and they were 10 or 11 so little kids until
[01:24:54] months later i felt confident in myself and i had turned into a reasonably social person i could
[01:25:00] not the most social not the most outgoing but you wouldn't tell that i had been almost pathologically
[01:25:05] shy to the point that my mom brought me to a doctor you know like and i owed it to those two
[01:25:10] do-gah and what i learned during third third and last year of middle school was that so one of
[01:25:15] them got mad at me for something stupid like a girl i don't know kiss me not him like i get
[01:25:21] a stupid thing 12 years old and it lasted five minutes but in those five minutes it was furious
[01:25:26] and it told me you remember two years ago when Alberto and i did this and that and helped you
[01:25:33] and involved you and got you out of your shell well we didn't do it because we thought you were
[01:25:38] cool but because this teacher told us that you needed help and he did it to hurt me to say that
[01:25:45] but actually i'd never felt more grateful in my life because it's very difficult if you think
[01:25:50] about it for someone 10 years old to actually implement that request from a teacher to go with the
[01:25:58] with uncool guy go through this log of months where the guy barely talks inviting him
[01:26:05] after classes to go to his place to play video games or play football and and they literally
[01:26:11] change my life it's probably the single thing that had ever happened to me that i'm most grateful for
[01:26:16] incredible closing story i absolutely love it thank you so much for your time thank you Patrick my pleasure
